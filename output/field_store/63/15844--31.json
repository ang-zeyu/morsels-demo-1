The  most notable finding was Janet's facial expression when  confronted by some of her incongruities of behavior.  Then she  assumed a most peculiar, open-eyed, wondering, dumb expression.  When flatly told a certain part of her story was falsehood, she  looked one straight in the eyes and said in a wonderfully demure  and semi-sorrowful manner, ``I am sorry you think so.''  Her  expression was sincere enough to make even experienced observers  half think they must themselves be wrong.    On the mental side she demonstrated good ability in many ways.  She had been through two years of high school and showed  evidences of her training.  We tested her for a number of  different capacities and, with one exception, we found all  through that she did fairly satisfactory work, showing herself to  have normal mental capabilities and control.    This exception was in the ``Aussage'' or testimony test.  Here in  reporting on our standard picture she gave in free recital 17  items, which is a fair result, but she added several incorrect  details.  On questioning she gave 12 more items, but invented  still more details.  Of the seven standard suggestions offered  she very curiously accepted only one, and that not important.  As  an example of how she would supply details from her fancy is the  following:  The picture represents a little girl standing by the  side of an older person.  Janet said it was a little boy, that he  had his hands in his pockets, a muffler on his neck, a stocking  cap on his head, and black shoes and stockings.  All of these  were voluntarily offered and all were incorrect.    Beyond this curious performance, and her peculiar lack of  foresight and shrewdness, or whatever it is that causes her so  readily to falsify and fabricate, we found not the slightest  evidence of aberration.  Her conversation was coherent and to the  point.    In the information obtained from the intelligent parents the  following points stand out clearly.  The heredity is of interest.  There has been no known case of feeblemindedness, insanity, or  epilepsy on either side, but there is a great admixture of very  good with quite unstable qualities.  This is true of both sides.  Some members of the family have taken high positions in the  community, and been exceptionally endowed mentally.  Others have  been notoriously lacking in stability.  We are informed that on  one side some have shown a marked inclination for tampering with  the truth, and it is suggested that Janet's tendency is the  result of early influence.  The care of an incompetent  grandmother, whose word was notoriously untrustworthy, devolved  upon the family and it was impossible to prevent Janet from being  much with her.  All of the children were aware of the old lady's  untruthfulness.  One of Janet's parents had been addicted to  narcotics, but had managed to shake off the habit.  The other  parent has had a severe attack of ``nervous prostration,''  largely induced, it is maintained, by worry over family affairs.  It is most interesting to note that the other children, two boys  and one girl, have turned out remarkably well; two being  university graduates, and all being very stable in character.  Both parents are people of good moral ideals, and in spite of  their own nervous defects have given their children very good  care.    The pregnancy with Janet was not entirely healthy, but no worse  than with the other children.  Her birth and infancy were normal.  Walked and talked early.  Started to school at 6.  Menstruated  first at 13; not irregular.  She never had any severe illnesses  of any kind.  As a child she once fell down some steps and was  unconscious for a few minutes, but the accident was not known to  have left any bad effects.  Janet's own stories of fainting are  much exaggerated.  In fact, the mother has never really seen her  faint, nor is there any evidence of any minor lapses of  consciousness.  At times the girl would feel faint and ask that  water be poured on her forehead--that was all there was to it.  She was removed in the middle of her high school course on  account of general nervousness.  The doctor felt she was working  too hard.  Her parents are sure she was never a great sufferer  from headaches.  Nothing else of importance could be found in her  physical history.    The story of this girl's falsifications and fabrications as  obtained from her people is exceedingly long.  As a young child  she was not over-indulged in fairy stories, and the parents  noticed nothing peculiar about her then.  She was not regarded as  a child who had any unusual powers of imagination.  Somewhere  about 12 years of age, her parents cannot be certain just when,  they noticed she began the exaggeration and lying which has  continued more or less ever since.  In the past two or three  years this has grown upon her and she has been making not only  untrue statements, but has been concocting peculiarly long and  intricate fabrications.  The curious thing to the family is that  Janet seems to have little shrewdness in lying; of normal ability  in other things, she seems to have the mind of a child in this.  Very many deceptions are discovered in short order, but even then  the girl will sometimes argue at length that what she has said  was really the truth.  The parents insist she must know that she  is lying, but her anomalous behavior has been so excessive that  they have long felt she should be studied by a psychiatrist.  Her  mother asserts there is some periodicity in Janet's tendencies.  She maintains she has noticed that most of her lies are told in  the two or three days preceding menstruation.  (This was  certainly not true during the period we observed the girl.)  The  parents are sure there has never been any particular mental  shock, and the mother has always felt that Janet was particularly  free from contamination by bad children.  At times she seems to  realize her own bad behavior, and not long ago said she would  become a nun, for in the tranquil life of the convent her  tendency to lying would not be stimulated.    Further inquiry brought out the fact that it was true, as Janet  stated, that in her high school course she became nervous to the  extent of jerking and twitching, and that also for a time she  stuttered.  Their physician said, however, that there was no  definite nervous disease.    As a young child the parents never thought this girl in any way  different from the rest of the family.  As she grew older she has  been regarded as physically the most robust, but, as she stated  to us, she has done the poorest intellectual work and that has  often been a matter of family comment.  The other children are  careful truth tellers.    The type of Janet's lying has been not only in the form of  falsifications about matters which directly concerned herself,  but also involved extensive manufacture of long stories,  phantasies.  Meeting people she might give them extensive  accounts of the wealth and importance of her own family.  She  once spread the report that her sister was married and living in  a fine home close by, giving many elaborate details of the new  household.  Such stories naturally caused much family  embarrassment.  Then she worked up an imaginary entertainment and  gave invitations to her brothers and sister at the request of a  pretended hostess.  Just before the event she, simulating the  hostess, telephoned that an accident had taken place and the  party would not be given.  An extremely delicate situation arose  because she alleged a certain young man wanted to marry her.  The  truth of her assertions in this matter never was investigated.  The parents felt it quite impossible to go to the young man about  the facts on account of the danger of exposing their daughter.  They were long embarrassed by the extent to which she kept this  affair going, but it finally was dropped without any social  scandal occurring.  In this and other affairs the family  situation was at times unbearable because of the possibility that  there might be some truth underlying the girl's statements.  As  the years went on Janet, of course, suffered from her loss of  reputation, but still continued her practices of lying.  In the  two years before she left home she worked as a clerk.  Previously  she had held two or three situations and was reported to give  good satisfaction in her work, but something would always come up  about money matters, or other things, which would finally give  rise to trouble.  It is not known that she ever really took any  money except the last time when she ran away and took a  considerable sum from her parents.    A period of extensive untruthfulness and deception occurred  before she left home.  Janet represented to her parents that she  was working at a certain place after she had left.  She got into  some mix-up about money matters, the rights of which never were  straightened out.  As usual, the affair was too complicated to be  understood by anything short of a prolonged investigation.  After  things had come to this pass and her parents hardly knew what to  do with her, she took money from them and ran away.  She was  readily traced because the ticket agent in her home town could  give a description of her.  She had bought a ticket to an  intermediate point and there stopped over night.  Her father  followed her thus far.  It seems when she finally got to New York  she hunted up the distant relatives who took her in and informed  the mother.  The girl intended to earn her own living and soon  found a good place.  She was always able to make a good  presentation of herself, being a quiet and convincing  conversationalist.    Out of the mess of lies surrounding her New York experience, it  was finally found that she had met a young man in a  boarding-house and had become infatuated with him.

The works of man are  merely made to be acted upon; are short lived, temporary, perishable  things. Man, however, bears the impress of Jehovah, is made after his  image, in his likeness, and possesses the principles of intelligence  within himself, and the medium of conveying it to others. He possesses  also, power to perpetuate his species, as also to communicate his  thoughts, his intelligence, genius, and power to others, that are  formed like him. He received his intelligence, his spirit, from God, he  is a part of himself,        A spark of Deity      Struck from the fire of his eternal blaze;    he came from God as his son, he bears the impress of Jehovah, even  in his fallen degenerate corrupted state. His powerful intellect,  his stately genius, his grasping ambition, his soaring, and in many  instances, exalted hopes, display, though he be fallen, the mark of  greatness; he bears the impress of Deity and shows that he is of divine  origin.    Unlike the works of man, the work of God in relation to this earth was  destined to be eternal, not subject to be controlled by any little  contingences; nor was it dependent upon fluctuation, or change. Man's  works might fluctuate, change, or be destroyed, but not so with God's,  they were, and are eternal; eternal mind, and eternal matter; organized  and created according to the unsearchable intelligence of that eternal  unfathomable mind; that fountain of intelligence, forethought, wisdom,  and energy, that dwells with God. And this earth, and man in their  destination, and all the works of this creation, are as unchangeable  as the sun, moon, or stars, and as unalterable as the throne of God.  Satan may deceive men, for a season; their minds may be blinded by the  god of this world, but God's purposes will be unchanged. Who is Satan?  A being powerful, energetic, deceptive, insinuating; and yet necessary  to develop the evil, as there are bitters, to make us appreciate the  sweet; darkness, to make us appreciate light; evil and its sorrows,  that we may appreciate the good; error that we may be enabled to  appreciate truth; misery, in order that we may appreciate happiness.  And as there are in the works of creation opposing, mineralogical  substances which in chemical processes are necessary to develop certain  properties of matter, and produce certain effects; as fire is necessary  to purify silver, gold, and the precious metals, so it is necessary to  instruct, and prepare man for his ultimate destiny--to test his virtue,  develop his folly, exhibit his weakness and prove his incompetency  without God to rule himself or the earth; or to make himself happy or  exalt himself in time, or in eternity. But again, who is Satan? He is a  being of God's own make, under his control, subject to his will, cast  out of Heaven for rebellion; and when his services can be dispensed  with, an angel will cast him into the bottomless pit. Can he fight  against and overcome God? Verily, No! Can he alter the designs of God?  Verily, No! Satan may rage; but the Lord can confine him within proper  limits. He may instigate rebellion against God, but the Lord can bind  him in chains.    Shall the purposes of the Lord be frustrated? Verily, No! The nations  of the earth may be drunken, and rush against each other like  inebriates; but the Lord's purposes are unchanged. Thrones may be cast  down, kingdoms depopulated; and blood, sword, and famine may prevail,  yet the Lord lives, and will accomplish his own designs. Man may  forget God, but God does not forget man: man may be ignorant of his  calling, but not so with God. Man may not reflect upon the designs of  God, in relation to this earth, but God must and does; and if in man's  madness, his infidelity, his hypocrisy, or his ignorance, he cannot  find time here to reflect upon these things, he will find ample leisure  hereafter, and the purposes of God will roll on; and perhaps when he  shall be preached to, as the rebellious Antediluvians, after receiving  the punishment of his deeds, he may know something more of the power,  justice, and purposes of God, and be glad to hear the Gospel in prison  which he rejected on this earth. But to suppose that the purposes of  God will be frustrated in relation to his designs in the formation of  this earth, is altogether folly. They will roll on as steadily as the  sun or moon in their courses. And as surely as we look in the east for  the rising of the sun in the morning to display his gorgeous glory,  light up the beauties of creation, and waken sleepy man; so surely  will \"the sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings,\" so  surely will the sleeping dead burst from their tombs, and the glorified  bodies with their spirits re-unite, so surely will a reign of justice,  truth, equity, and happiness--the reign of God, supersede the barbarous  oppression, and corrupt governments of this world, so surely will that  long night of darkness, ignorance, crime, and error be superseded  by the glorious day of righteousness; and so surely will this earth  become as the Garden of the Lord, the kingdom and reign of God be  established, and the Saints of the Most High take the kingdom and  possess it for ever and ever. The time of the restitution of all things  will be ushered in; the earth resume its paradisiacal glory, and the  dead and the living Saints possess the full fruition of those things  for which they lived, and suffered, and died. These are the hopes that  the ancient Saints enjoyed; they possessed hopes that bloomed with  immortality and eternal life; hopes planted there by the Spirit of  God, and conferred by the ministering of Angels, the visions of the  Almighty, the opening of the Heavens, and the promises of God. They  lived and died in hopes of a better resurrection. How different to the  narrow, conceited, grovelling views of would-be philosophers, of sickly  religionists, and dreaming philanthropists!    Therefore, as we have said, anything short of this would render inutile  the hopes of the Saints; would fail to accomplish the expectation of  millions of spirits; and cause Satan to triumph, and frustrate the  designs of God. This earth, after wading through all the corruptions  of men, being cursed for his sake, and not permitted to shed forth  its full lustre and glory, must yet take its proper place in God's  creations; be purified from that corruption under which it has groaned  for ages, and become a fit place for redeemed men, angels, and God to  dwell upon. The Lord Jesus will come and dispossess the usurper; take  possession of his own kingdom; introduce a rule of righteousness; and  reign there with his Saints, who, together with him, are the rightful  proprietors.        Chapter X.  ------------------    Will God's Kingdom Be a Literal or a Spiritual Kingdom?    It would be almost unnecessary to answer such a question as the  above, were it not for the opinions that are entertained in the world  concerning a purely spiritual kingdom, particularly as in a preceding  chapter I have clearly pointed out a literal kingdom, rule, and reign.  But I have introduced this merely to meet some questions that exist  in the minds of many, relative to a spiritual kingdom, arising from  certain remarks of our Saviour's, where he says, \"My kingdom is not of  this world;\" and again, the \"kingdom of heaven is not meat and drink,  but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost;\" and again,  \"the kingdom of God is within (or among) you.\"    The kingdom of God, as I have already stated, is the government of  God, whether in the heavens, or on the earth. Hence Jesus taught his  disciples to pray, \"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth, as  it is done in heaven.\" And when the kingdom of God is established on  the earth, and prevails universally, then will the will of God be done  on earth, and not till then; then will the reign of God exist on the  earth, as it now does in heaven. It is this reign we are speaking of,  a reign of righteousness. But whenever God's laws are established,  or his kingdom is organized, and officers selected, and men yield  obedience to the laws of the kingdom of God; to such an extent does  God's kingdom prevail. John preached the kingdom of God, or, heaven  nigh at hand. Jesus said, the kingdom of heaven is within you. Jesus  compared the kingdom of heaven to a husbandman who sowed wheat, and  when he went to his field, he found tares also. Matt. xiii. Now what  was this field? The field was the world, or in other words, God's  rightful possession, where he ought to govern; the good seed are the  children of the kingdom, or those who receive and obey the laws of the  kingdom of heaven. The tares are the children of the wicked one; or  those who rebel against God and his laws. The tares are to be gathered  out of his kingdom, and burned; and then are the righteous to shine as  the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Again, the kingdom of Heaven  is likened unto a treasure that a man found in a field, and sold all  his possessions, in order that he might possess himself of that field  and treasure; and a pearl of great price, for which a man did likewise;  thus Abraham, Noah, Lot, Moses, and many of the Prophets purchased this  treasure at the sacrifice of all things. And why? They discovered the  pearl, the treasure, and had respect unto the recompense of reward;  enduring as seeing him who is invisible. And what was it all for? For  the purpose of obtaining present blessings, earthly enjoyments, the  pleasures of sense? No! they all died in faith _not having_ received  the promises; but having seen them afar off; they knew of the treasure,  and sold all for it; they \"looked for a city which hath foundations,  whose builder and maker is God.\" Wherefore it is said, God is not  ashamed to be called their God, for he hath prepared for them a city.  They looked for a reign of righteousness--the government of God--they"]]]
