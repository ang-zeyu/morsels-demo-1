An ancient dishcloth, succulent with active service,  was considered a treat to be bolted whole; and when in due course  the cloth was returned to earth, it was intact, bleached, purged, and  purified as by chemic fires and ready for a new round of benevolences.    In some seasons the dogs catch Rabbits enough to keep them up. But  this year the Rabbits were gone. They are very clever at robbing  fish-nets at times, but these were far from the fort. Reduced  to such desperate straits for food, what wonder that cannibalism  should be common! Not only the dead, but the sick or disabled of  their own kind are torn to pieces and devoured. I was told of one  case where a brutal driver disabled one of his dogs with heavy blows;  its companions did not wait till it was dead before they feasted.  It is hard to raise pups because the mothers so often devour their  own young; and this is a charge I never heard laid to the Wolf,  the ancestor of these dogs, which shows how sadly the creature has  been deteriorated by contact with man. There seems no length to  which they will not go for food. Politeness forbids my mentioning  the final diet for which they scramble around the camp. Never in my  life before have I seen such utter degradation by the power of the  endless hunger pinch. Nevertheless--and here I expect the reader to  doubt, even as I did when first I heard it, no matter how desperate  their straits-these gormandisers of unmentionable filth, these  starvelings, in their dire extremity will turn away in disgust from  duck or any other web-footed water-fowl.    Billy Loutit had shot a Pelican; the skin was carefully preserved  and the body guarded for the dogs, thinking that this big thing,  weighing 6 or 7 pounds, would furnish a feast for one or two. The  dogs knew me, and rushed like a pack of Wolves at sight of coming  food. The bigger ones fought back the smaller. I threw the prize,  but, famished though they were, they turned away as a man might  turn from a roasted human hand. One miserable creature, a mere  skeleton, sneaked forward when the stronger ones were gone, pulled  out the entrails at last, and devoured them as though he hated  them.    I can offer no explanation. But the Hudson's Bay men tell me it is  always so, and I am afraid the remembrance of the reception accorded  my bounty that day hardened my heart somewhat in the days that  followed.    On the Nyarling we were too far from mankind to be bothered  with dogs, but at Fort Resolution we reentered their country. The  following from my journal records the impression after our enforced  three days' stay:    \"Tuesday, July 16, 1907.--Fine day for the first time since July  3. At last we pulled out of Fort Resolution (9.40 A. M.). I never  was so thankful to leave a place where every one was kind. I think  the maddest cynophile would find a cure here. It is the worst  dog-cursed spot I ever saw; not a square yard but is polluted  by them; no article can be left on the ground but will be carried  off, torn up, or defiled; the four corners of our tent have become  regular stopping places for the countless canines, and are disfigured  and made abominable, so that after our escape there will be needed  many days of kindly rain for their purification.  There certainly  are several hundred dogs in the village; there are about 50 teepees  and houses with 5 to 15 dogs at each, and 25 each at the mission  and H. B. Co. In a short walk, about 200 yards, I passed 86 dogs.    \"There is not an hour or ten minutes of day or night that is not  made hideous with a dog-fight or chorus of yelps. There are about  six different clans of dogs, divided as their owners are, and a  Dogrib dog entering the Yellow-knife or Chipewyan part of the camp  is immediately set upon by all the residents. Now the clansmen of  the one in trouble rush to the rescue and there is a battle. Indians  of both sides join in with clubs to belabour the fighters, and the  yowling and yelping of those discomfited is painful to hear for  long after the fight is over. It was a battle like this, I have  been told, which caused the original split of the tribe, one part  of which went south to become the Apaches of Arizona. The scenes  go on all day and all night in different forms. A number of dogs  are being broken in by being tied up to stakes. These keep up  a heart-rending and peculiar crying, beginning with a short bark  which melts into a yowl and dies away in a nerve-racking wail.  This ceases not day or night, and half a dozen of these prisoners  are within a stone's throw of our camp.    \"The favourite place for the clan fights seems to be among  the guy-ropes of our tent; at least half a dozen of these general  engagements take place every night while we try to sleep.    \"Everything must be put on the high racks eight feet up to be safe  from them; even empty tins are carried off, boots, hats, soap, etc.,  are esteemed most toothsome morsels, and what they can neither eat,  carry off, nor destroy, they defile with elaborate persistency and  precision.\"    A common trick of the Indians when canoe season arrives is, to put  all the family and one or two of the best dogs in the canoes, then  push away from the shore, leaving the rest behind. Those so abandoned  come howling after the canoes, and in unmistakable pleadings beg  the heartless owners to take them in. But the canoes push off toward  the open sea, aiming to get out of sight. The dogs howl sadly on  the shore, or swim after them till exhausted, then drift back to  the nearest land to begin the summer of hardship.    If Rabbits are plentiful they get along; failing these they catch  mice or fish; when the berry season comes they eat fruit; the weaker  ones are devoured by their brethren; and when the autumn arrives  their insensate owners generally manage to come back and pick up  the survivors, feeding them so that they are ready for travel when  dog-time begins, and the poor faithful brutes, bearing no grudge,  resume at once the service of their unfeeling masters.    All through our voyage up Great Slave Lake we daily heard the sad  howling of abandoned dogs, and nightly, we had to take steps to  prevent them stealing our food and leathers. More than once in the  dim light, I was awakened by a rustle, to see sneaking from my tent  the gray, wolfish form of some prowling dog, and the resentment I  felt at the loss inflicted, was never more than to make me shout  or throw a pebble at him.    One day, as we voyaged eastward (July 23) in the Tal-thel-lay  narrows of Great Slave Lake, we met 5 canoes and 2 York boats of  Indians going west. A few hours afterward as, we were nooning on  an island (we were driven to the islands now) there came a long  howling from the rugged main shore, a mile away to the east of  us; then it increased to a chorus of wailing, and we knew that the  Indians had that morning abandoned their dogs there. The wailing  continued, then we saw a tiny black speck coming from the far  shore. When it was half-way across the ice-cold bay we could hear  the gasps of a tired swimmer. He got along fairly, dodging the cakes  of ice, until within about 200 yards, when his course was barred  by a long, thin, drifting floe. He tried to climb on it, but was  too weak, then he raised his voice in melancholy howls of despair.  I could not get to him, but he plucked up heart at length, and  feebly paddling went around till he found an opening, swam through  and came on, the slowest dog swimmer I ever saw. At last he struck  bottom and crawled out. But he was too weak and ill to eat the meat  that I had ready prepared for him. We left him with food for many  days and sailed away.    Another of the dogs that tried to follow him across was lost in the  ice; we heard his miserable wailing moans as he was carried away,  but could not help him. My Indians thought nothing of it and were  amused at my solicitude.    A couple of hours later we landed on the rugged east coast to study  our course through the ice. At once., we were met by four dogs that  trotted along the shore to where we landed. They did not seem very  gaunt; one, an old yellow female, carried something in her mouth;  this she never laid down, and growled savagely when any of the others  came near. It proved to be the blood-stained leg of a new-killed  dog, yellow like herself.    As we pulled out a big black-and-white fellow looked at us  wistfully from a rocky ledge; memories of Bingo, whom he resembled  not a little, touched me. I threw him a large piece of dried meat.  He ate it, but not ravenously. He seemed in need, not of food, but  of company.    A few miles farther on we again landed to study the lake; as we  came near we saw the dogs, not four but six, now racing to meet  us. I said to Preble: \"It seems to me it would be the part of mercy  to shoot them all.\" He answered: \"They are worth nothing now, but  you shoot one and its value would at once jump up to one hundred  dollars. Every one knows everything that is done in this country.  You would have six hundred dollars' damages to pay when you got  back to Fort Resolution.\"    I got out our stock of fresh fish. The Indians, seeing my purpose,  said: \"Throw it in the water and see them dive.\" I did so and found  that they would dive into several feet of water and bring up the  fish without fail. The yellow female was not here, so I suppose  she had stayed to finish her bone.    When we came away, heading for the open lake, the dogs followed us  as far as they could, then gathering on a flat rock, the end of a  long point, they sat down, some with their backs to us; all raised  their muzzles and howled to the sky a heart-rending dirge.    I was thankful to lose them in the distance.

I didn't  grasp that at first, for no one had explained the rules. So she stopped  in the middle of a sentence and waited till I had finished. Then she  went on again, precisely where she had left off. Then when we came into  the drawing room, the whiskered ladies and I, there a little woman like  a mouse sitting there, and nobody introduced her. So naturally I went  to talk to her, before which the great parrot said, 'Will you kindly  fetch my wool-work, Miss Lyall?' and Miss Lyall took a sack out of the  corner, and inside was the sacred carpet. And then I waited for some  coffee and cigarettes, and I waited, and I waited, and I am waiting  still. The Parrot said that coffee always kept her awake, and that was  why. And then Georgie came in with the others, and I could see by his  face that he hadn't had a cigarette either. It was then half-past nine.  And then each man sat down between two women, and Pug sat in the middle  and looked for fleas. Then Lady Ambermere got up, and came across the  charmed circle to me. She said: 'I hope you have brought your music,  Mrs Shuttleworth. Kindly open the piano, Miss Lyall. It was always  considered a remarkably fine instrument.'\"    Olga waved the fork on which was impaled a piece of the pineapple which  Georgie had purchased that morning at the fruiterer's.    \"The stupendous cheek!\" she said. \"I thought it must be a joke, and  laughed with the greatest politeness. But it wasn't! You'll hardly  believe it, but it wasn't! One of the whiskered ones said, That will be  a great treat,' and another put on the face that everyone wears at  concerts. And I was so stunned that I sang, and Lady Ambermere beat  time, and Pug barked.\"    She pointed a finger at Georgie.    \"Never till the day of judgment,\" she said, \"when Lady Ambermere  gnashes her beautiful teeth for ever and ever, will I set foot in that  house again. Nor she in my house. I will set fire to it sooner. There!  My dear, what a good lunch you have given me. May we play croquet at  once?\"    Lucia's garden-parties were scheduled from four to seven and  half-an-hour before the earliest guest might be expected, she was  casting an eagle eye over the preparations which today were on a very  sumptuous scale. The bowls were laid out in the bowling alley, not  because anybody in Hightums dresses was the least likely to risk the  stooping down and the strong movements that the game entailed, but  because bowls were Elizabethan. Between the alley and the lawn nearer  to the house was a large marquee, where the commoner crowd--though no  crowd could be really common in Riseholme--would refresh itself. But  even where none are common there may still be degrees in rarity, and by  the side of this general refreshment room was a smaller tent carpeted  with Oriental rugs, and having inside it some half-dozen chairs, and two  seats which can only be described as thrones, for Lady Ambermere or Olga  Bracely, while Lucia's Guru, though throneworthy, would very kindly sit  in one of his most interesting attitudes on the floor. This tent was  designed only for high converse, and common guests (if they were good)  would be led into it and introduced to the great presences, while for  the refreshment of the presences, in intervals of audience, a more  elaborate meal, with peaches and four sorts of sandwiches was laid in  the smoking-parlour. Thus those guests for whom audiences were not  provided, could have the felicity of seeing the great ones pass across  the lawn on their excursions for food, and possibly trip over the  croquet hoops, which had been left up to give an air of naturalness to  the lawn. In the smoking-parlour an Elzevir or two were left  negligently open, as if Mr and Mrs Lucas had been reading the works of  Persius and Juvenal when the first guests arrived. In the music-room,  finally, which was not usually open on these occasions, there were  fresh flowers: the piano, too, was open, and if you had not seen the  Elzevirs in the smoking-parlour, it would have been reasonable for the  early guests, if they penetrated here, to imagine that Mrs Lucas had  been running over the last act of Siegfried a minute before.    In this visit of final inspection Lucia was accompanied by her Guru,  for he was part of the domestic _dramatis personae_, and she  wanted him to be \"discovered\" in the special tent. She pointed out the  site of his proposed \"discovery\" to him.    \"Probably the first person I shall bring in here,\" she said, \"will be  Lady Ambermere, for she is noted for her punctuality. She is so anxious  to see you, and would it not be exciting if you found you had met  before? Her husband was Governor of Madras, and she spent many years in  India.\"    \"Madras, gracious lady?\" asked the Guru. \"I, too, know Madras: there  are many dark spirits in Madras. And she was at English Residency?\"    \"Yes. She says Mr Kipling knows nothing about India. You and she will  have much to talk about. I wish I could sit on the floor, too, and  listen to what you say to each other.\"    \"It will be great treat,\" said the Guru thoughtfully, \"I love all who  love my wonderful country.\"    Suddenly he stopped, and put his hands up to his head, palms outward.    \"There are wonderful vibrations today,\" he said. \"All day I feel that  some word is on way from the Guides, some great message of light.\"    \"Oh, wouldn't it be wonderful if it came to you in the middle of my  garden party?\" said Lucia enthusiastically.    \"Ah, gracious lady, the great word comes not so. It comes always in  solitude and quiet. Gracious lady knows that as well as Guru.\"    Pure Guruism and social pre-eminence struggled together in Lucia.  Guruism told her that she ought to be ecstatic at the idea of a great  message coming and should instantly smile on his desire for solitude  and quiet, while social pre-eminence whispered to her that she had  already dangled the presence of a high-caste mystic from Benares before  the eyes of Lady Ambermere, who only came from Madras. On the other  hand Olga Bracely was to be an even more resplendent guest than either  Lady Ambermere or the Guru; surely Olga Bracely was enough to set this  particular garden-party on the giddiest of pinnacles. And an awful  consequence lurked as a possibility if she attempted to force her Guru  not to immune himself in solitude and quiet, which was that conceivably  he might choose to go back to the pit whence he was digged, namely the  house of poor Daisy Quantock. The thought was intolerable, for with him  in her house, she had seen herself as dispenser of Eastern Mysteries,  and Mistress of Omism to Riseholme. In fact the Guru was her August  stunt; it would never do to lose him before the end of July, and rage  to see all Riseholme making pilgrimages to Daisy. There was a  thin-lipped firmness, too, about him at this moment: she felt that  under provocation he might easily defy or desert her. She felt she had  to yield, and so decided to do so in the most complete manner.    \"Ah, yes,\" she said. \"I know how true that is. Dear Guru, go up to  Hamlet: no one will disturb you there. But if the message comes through  before Lady Ambermere goes away, promise me you will come back.\"    He went back to the house, where the front door was already open to  admit Lady Ambermere, who was telling \"her people\" when to come back  for her, and fled with the heels of his slippers tapping on the oak  stairs up to Hamlet. Softly he shut out the dark spirits from Madras,  and made himself even more secure by turning the key in his door. It  would never do to appear as a high caste Brahmin from Benares before  anyone who knew India with such fatal intimacy, for he might not  entirely correspond with her preconceived notions of such a person.    Lady Ambermere's arrival was soon followed by that of other guests, and  instead of going into the special tent reserved for the lions, she took  up a commanding position in the middle of the lawn, where she could  examine everybody through her tortoiseshell handled lorgnette. She kept  Peppino by her, who darted forward to shake hands with his wife's  guests, and then darted back again to her. Poor Miss Lyall stood behind  her chair, and from time to time as ordered, gave her a cape, or put up  her parasol, or adjusted her footstool for her, or took up Pug or put  him down as her patroness required. Most of the time Lady Ambermere  kept up a majestic monologue.    \"You have a pretty little garden here, Mr Lucas,\" she said, \"though  perhaps inconveniently small. Your croquet lawn does not look to me the  full size, and then there is no tennis-court. But I think you have a  little strip of grass somewhere, which you use for bowls, have you not?  Presently I will walk around with you and see your domain. Put Pug down  again, please, Miss Lyall, and let him run about. See, he wants to play  with one of those croquet balls. Put it in motion for him, and he will  run with it. Bless me, who is that coming up the path at such a  tremendous speed in a bath-chair? Oh, I see, it is Mrs Weston. She  should not go as fast as that. If Pug was to stray on to the path he  would be run over. Better pick up Pug again, Miss Lyall, till she has  gone by. And here is Colonel Boucher. If he had brought his bull-dogs,  I should have asked him to take them away again. I should like a cup of  tea, Miss Lyall, with plenty of milk in it, and not too strong. You  know how I like my tea. And a biscuit or something for Pug, with a  little cream in a saucer or anything that's handy.\"    \"Won't you come into the smoking-parlour, and have tea there, Lady  Ambermere?\" asked Peppino.    \"The smoking-parlour?\" asked she. \"How very strange to lay tea in a  smoking-room.\"    Peppino explained that nobody had in all probability used the  smoking-parlour to smoke in for five or six years.    \"Oh, if that is so, I will come,\" said she. \"Better bring Pug along,  too, Miss Lyall.
