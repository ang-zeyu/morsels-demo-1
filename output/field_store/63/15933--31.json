Presently some one called out \"There's the sea,\"  and so it was, as distinct as though it were not fifty miles off; none  of us had seen it since we landed; to all of us it is associated with  the idea of going home some day: whilst we were feasting our eyes on it  a golden line seemed drawn on its horizon; it spread and spread, and as  all the water became flooded with a light and glory which hardly seemed  to belong to this world, the blessed sun came up to restore us all  to life and warmth again. In a moment, in less than a moment, all our  little privations and sufferings vanished as if they had never existed,  or existed only to be laughed at. Who could think of their \"Ego\" in such  a glorious presence, and with such a panorama before them? I did not  know which side to turn to first. Behind me rose a giant forest in the  far hills to the west--a deep shadow for miles, till the dark outline  of the pines stood out against the dazzling snow of the mountains behind  it; here the sky was still sheltering the flying night, and the white  outlines looked ghostly against the dull neutral tints, though every  peak was sharply and clearly defined; then I turned round to see before  me such a glow of light and beauty! For an immense distance I could see  the vast Canterbury plains; to the left the Waimakiriri river, flowing  in many streams, \"like a tangled bunch of silver ribbons\" (as Mr. Butler  calls it in his charming book on New Zealand), down to the sea; beyond  its banks the sun shone on the windows of the houses at Oxford, thirty  miles off as the crow would fly, and threw its dense bush into strong  relief against the yellow plains. The Port Hills took the most lovely  lights and shadows as we gazed on them; beyond them lay the hills of  Akaroa, beautiful beyond the power of words to describe. Christchurch  looked quite a large place from the great extent of ground it appeared  to cover. We looked onto the south: there was a slight haze over the  great Ellesmere Lake, the water of which is quite fresh, though only  separated from the sea by a slight bar of sand; the high banks of the  Rakaia made a deep dark line extending right back into the mountains,  and beyond it we could see the Rangitata faintly gleaming in the  distance; between us and the coast were green patches and tiny  homesteads, but still few and far between; close under our feet, and  looking like a thread beneath the shadow of the mountain, ran the Selwyn  in a narrow gorge, and on its bank stood the shepherd's hut that I have  told you once afforded us such a good luncheon; it looked a mere toy, as  if it came out of a child's box of playthings, and yet so snug for all  its lonely position. On the other hand lay our own little home, with the  faint wreath of smoke stealing up through the calm air (for the wind had  dropped at sunrise). Here and there we saw strings of sheep going down  from their high camping-grounds to feed on the sunny slopes and in  the warm valleys. Every moment added to our delight and enjoyment; but  unfortunately it was a sort of happiness which one can neither speak of  at the time, nor write about afterwards: silence is its most expressive  language. Whilst I was drinking in all the glory and beauty before me,  some of the others had been busy striking the tent, repacking the loads,  very much lighter without the provisions; and we had one more excellent  cup of tea before abandoning the encampment to the wekas, who must have  breakfasted splendidly that morning. Our last act was to collect all  the stones we could move into a huge cairn, which was built round a tall  pole of totara; on the summit of this we tied securely, with flax, the  largest and strongest pocket-handkerchief, and then, after one look  round to the west--now as glowing and bright as the radiant east--we set  off homewards about seven o'clock; but it was long before we reached  the place where we left the horses, for the gentlemen began rolling  huge rocks down the sides of the hills and watching them crashing and  thundering into the valleys, sometimes striking another rock and then  bounding high into the air. They were all as eager and excited as  schoolboys, and I could not go on and leave them, lest I should get  below them and be crushed under a small stone of twenty tons or so. I  was therefore forced to keep well _above_ them all the time. At last we  reached the spur where the horses were tethered, re-saddled and loaded  them, and arrived quite safely at home, just in time for baths and  breakfast. I was amused to see that no one seemed to remember or allude  to the miseries and aches of that long cold night; all were full of  professions of enjoyment. But I noticed that the day was unusually  quiet; the gentlemen preferred a bask in the verandah to any other  amusement, and I have reason to believe they indulged in a good many  naps.          Letter XVIII: A journey \"down south.\"      Waimate, May 1867. In one of my early letters from Heathstock I told you  that the Hurunui, which is the boundary of that run, marks the extreme  north of the Province of Canterbury; and now I am writing to you from  the extreme south. I hope you do not forget to reverse in your own mind  the ordinary ideas of heat and cold, as connected with those points of  the compass. The distance from our house to this is about 160 miles, and  we actually took two days and a half to get here!--besides, into these  miles was compressed the fatigue of a dozen English railway journeys  of the same length. But, I suppose, as usual, you will not be satisfied  unless I begin at the very beginning. The first difficulty was to reach  the point where we were to join the coach on the Great South Road. It  was less than thirty miles, so we could easily have ridden the distance;  but the difficulty was to get our clothes all that way. They could not  be carried on horseback, and just then the station-dray was particularly  employed; besides which it would have taken three days to come and  go,--rather a useless expenditure of the man's time, as well as of  the horses' legs, where only two little portmanteaus were concerned.  Fortunately for us, however, this is a country where each man is ready  and willing to help his neighbour, without any inquiry as to who he is;  so the moment our dilemma was known various plans were suggested for our  assistance, of which this was the one selected:--    On a certain bright but cold Wednesday afternoon, F---- and I and our  modest luggage started in a neighbour's \"trap\" for the station I have  already mentioned on the Horarata, where Mr. C. H---- and I stopped  on our way to Lake Coleridge. It is on the plains at the foot of a low  range of downs, and about twelve miles from us. You cannot imagine  a more charming little cottage _ornee_ than the house is, capable of  holding, apparently, an indefinite number of people, and with owners  whose hospitality always prompts them to try its capabilities to the  utmost. A creek runs near the house, and on its banks, sloping to the  sun, lies a lovely garden, as trim as any English parterre, and a mass  of fruit and flowers. Nothing can be more picturesque than the mixture  of both. For instance, on the wall of the house is a peach-tree  laden every autumn with rosy, velvet-cheeked fruit; and jasmine and  passion-flowers growing luxuriantly near it. Inside all is bright  neatness and such a welcome! As for our supper, on this particular  day it comprised every dainty you can imagine, and made me think of  my housekeeping with shame and confusion of face. We had a very merry  evening, with round games; but there was a strong prejudice in favour of  going to bed early, as we all had to be up by three o'clock: and so  we were, to find a delicious breakfast prepared for us, which our kind  hostess was quite disappointed to see we could not eat much of. Coffee  and toast was all I could manage at that hour. We started in the dark,  and the first thing we had to cross was a dry river-bed, in which one of  the horses lay deliberately down, and refused to move. This eccentricity  delayed us very much; but we got him into a better frame of mind, and  accomplished our early drive of sixteen miles in safety, reaching the  accommodation-house, or inn, where the coach from Christchurch to Timaru  changes horses for its first stage, by six o'clock. There we had a good  breakfast, and were in great \"form\" by the time the coach was ready  to start. These conveyances have a world-wide celebrity as \"Cobb's  coaches,\" both in America and Australia, where they are invariably the  pioneers of all wheeled vehicles, being better adapted to travel on a  bad road, or no road at all, than any other four-wheeled \"trap.\" They  are both strong and light, with leathern springs and a powerful break;  but I cannot conscientiously say they are at all handsome carriages;  indeed I think them extremely ugly and not very comfortable except on  the box-seat next the driver. Fortunately, this is made to hold three,  so F---- and I scrambled up, and off we started with four good strong  horses, bearing less harness about them than any quadrupeds I ever saw;  a small collar, slender traces, and very thin reins comprised all their  accoutrements. The first half of the journey was slow, but there was no  jolting. The road was level, though it had not been made at all,  only the tussocks removed from it; but it was naturally good--a great  exception to New Zealand roads. The driver was a steady, respectable  man, very intelligent; and when F----cou"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/611"],[0,"Prester John (#20)"],[1,"we came out into a gleam of moonlight, and I saw that we were  inside the gorge and far above the slab.  We followed a narrow shelf on  its left side (or 'true right', as mountaineers would call it) until we  could go no farther.  Then we did a terrible thing.  Across the gorge,  which here was at its narrowest, stretched a slab of stone.  Far, far  below I caught the moonlight on a mass of hurrying waters. This was our  bridge, and though I have a good head for crags, I confess I grew dizzy  as we turned to cross it.  Perhaps it was broader than it looked; at  any rate my guides seemed to have no fear, and strode across it as if  it was a highway, while I followed in a sweat of fright.  Once on the  other side, I was handed over to a second pair of guides, who led me  down a high passage running into the heart of the mountain.    The boom of the river sank and rose as the passage twined. Soon I saw a  gleam of light ahead which was not the moon.  It grew larger, until  suddenly the roof rose and I found myself in a gigantic chamber.  So  high it was that I could not make out anything of the roof, though the  place was brightly lit with torches stuck round the wall, and a great  fire which burned at the farther end.  But the wonder was on the left  side, where the floor ceased in a chasm.  The left wall was one sheet  of water, where the river fell from the heights into the infinite  depth, below.  The torches and the fire made the sheer stream glow and  sparkle like the battlements of the Heavenly City.  I have never seen  any sight so beautiful or so strange, and for a second my breath  stopped in admiration.    There were two hundred men or more in the chamber, but so huge was the  place that they seemed only a little company. They sat on the ground in  a circle, with their eyes fixed on the fire and on a figure which stood  before it.  The glow revealed the old man I had seen on that morning a  month before moving towards the cave.  He stood as if in a trance,  straight as a tree, with his arms crossed on his breast.  A robe of  some shining white stuff fell from his shoulders, and was clasped round  his middle by a broad circle of gold.  His head was shaven, and on his  forehead was bound a disc of carved gold.  I saw from his gaze that his  old eyes were blind.    'Who comes?' he asked as I entered.    'A messenger from the Inkulu,' I spoke up boldly.  'He follows soon  with the white man, Henriques.'    Then I sat down in the back row of the circle to await events.  I  noticed that my neighbour was the fellow 'Mwanga whom I had kicked out  of the store.  Happily I was so dusty that he could scarcely recognize  me, but I kept my face turned away from him.  What with the light and  the warmth, the drone of the water, the silence of the folk, and my  mental and physical stress, I grew drowsy and all but slept.      [1] The Communion Sabbath.    [2] A title applied only to the greatest chiefs.        CHAPTER XI    THE CAVE OF THE ROOIRAND    I was roused by a sudden movement.  The whole assembly stood up, and  each man clapped his right hand to his brow and then raised it high.  A  low murmur of 'Inkulu' rose above the din of the water.  Laputa strode  down the hall, with Henriques limping behind him.  They certainly did  not suspect my presence in the cave, nor did Laputa show any ruffling  of his calm.  Only Henriques looked weary and cross.  I guessed he had  had to ride my pony.    The old man whom I took to be the priest advanced towards Laputa with  his hands raised over his head.  A pace before they met he halted, and  Laputa went on his knees before him.  He placed his hands on his head,  and spoke some words which I could not understand.  It reminded me, so  queer are the tricks of memory, of an old Sabbath-school book I used to  have which had a picture of Samuel ordaining Saul as king of Israel.  I  think I had forgotten my own peril and was enthralled by the majesty of  the place--the wavering torches, the dropping wall of green water,  above all, the figures of Laputa and the Keeper of the Snake, who  seemed to have stepped out of an antique world.    Laputa stripped off his leopard skin till he stood stark, a noble form  of a man.  Then the priest sprinkled some herbs on the fire, and a thin  smoke rose to the roof.  The smell was that I had smelled on the  Kirkcaple shore, sweet, sharp, and strange enough to chill the marrow.  And round the fire went the priest in widening and contracting circles,  just as on that Sabbath evening in spring.    Once more we were sitting on the ground, all except Laputa and the  Keeper.  Henriques was squatting in the front row, a tiny creature  among so many burly savages.  Laputa stood with bent head in the centre.    Then a song began, a wild incantation in which all joined. The old  priest would speak some words, and the reply came in barbaric music.  The words meant nothing to me; they must have been in some tongue long  since dead.  But the music told its own tale.  It spoke of old kings  and great battles, of splendid palaces and strong battlements, of  queens white as ivory, of death and life, love and hate, joy and  sorrow.  It spoke, too, of desperate things, mysteries of horror long  shut to the world. No Kaffir ever forged that ritual.  It must have  come straight from Prester John or Sheba's queen, or whoever ruled in  Africa when time was young.    I was horribly impressed.  Devouring curiosity and a lurking nameless  fear filled my mind.  My old dread had gone.  I was not afraid now of  Kaffir guns, but of the black magic of which Laputa had the key.    The incantation died away, but still herbs were flung on the fire, till  the smoke rose in a great cloud, through which the priest loomed misty  and huge.  Out of the smoke-wreaths his voice came high and strange.  It was as if some treble stop had been opened in a great organ, as  against the bass drone of the cataract.    He was asking Laputa questions, to which came answers in that rich  voice which on board the liner had preached the gospel of Christ.  The  tongue I did not know, and I doubt if my neighbours were in better  case.  It must have been some old sacred language--Phoenician, Sabaean,  I know not what--which had survived in the rite of the Snake.    Then came silence while the fire died down and the smoke eddied away in  wreaths towards the river.  The priest's lips moved as if in prayer: of  Laputa I saw only the back, and his head was bowed.    Suddenly a rapt cry broke from the Keeper.  'God has spoken,' he cried.  'The path is clear.  The Snake returns to the House of its Birth.'    An attendant led forward a black goat, which bleated feebly. With a  huge antique knife the old man slit its throat, catching the blood in a  stone ewer.  Some was flung on the fire, which had burned small and low.    'Even so,' cried the priest, 'will the king quench in blood the  hearth-fires of his foes.'    Then on Laputa's forehead and bare breast he drew a bloody cross. 'I  seal thee,' said the voice, 'priest and king of God's people.' The ewer  was carried round the assembly, and each dipped his finger in it and  marked his forehead.  I got a dab to add to the other marks on my face.    'Priest and king of God's people,' said the voice again, 'I call thee  to the inheritance of John.  Priest and king was he, king of kings,  lord of hosts, master of the earth.  When he ascended on high he left  to his son the sacred Snake, the ark of his valour, to be God's dower  and pledge to the people whom He has chosen.'    I could not make out what followed.  It seemed to be a long roll of the  kings who had borne the Snake.  None of them I knew, but at the end I  thought I caught the name of Tchaka the Terrible, and I remembered  Arcoll's tale.    The Keeper held in his arms a box of curiously wrought ivory, about two  feet long and one broad.  He was standing beyond the ashes, from which,  in spite of the blood, thin streams of smoke still ascended.  He opened  it, and drew out something which swung from his hand like a cascade of  red fire.    'Behold the Snake,' cried the Keeper, and every man in the assembly,  excepting Laputa and including me, bowed his head to the ground and  cried 'Ow.'    'Ye who have seen the Snake,' came the voice, 'on you is the vow of  silence and peace.  No blood shall ye shed of man or beast, no flesh  shall ye eat till the vow is taken from you.  From the hour of midnight  till sunrise on the second day ye are bound to God.  Whoever shall  break the vow, on him shall the curse fall.  His blood shall dry in his  veins, and his flesh shrink on his bones.  He shall be an outlaw and  accursed, and there shall follow him through life and death the  Avengers of the Snake.  Choose ye, my people; upon you is the vow.'    By this time we were all flat on our faces, and a great cry of assent  went up.  I lifted my head as much as I dared to see what would happen  next.    The priest raised the necklace till it shone above his head like a halo  of blood.  I have never seen such a jewel, and I think there has never  been another such on earth.  Later I was to have the handling of it,  and could examine it closely, though now I had only a glimpse.  There  were fifty-five rubies in it, the largest as big as a pigeon's egg, and  the least not smaller than my thumbnail.  In shape they were oval, cut  on both sides en cabochon, and on each certain characters were  engraved. No doubt this detracted from their value as gems, yet the  characters might have been removed and the stones cut in facets, and  these rubies would still have been the noblest in the world.  I was no  jewel merchant to guess their value, but I knew enough to see that here  was wealth beyond human computation.  At each end of the string was a  great pearl and a golden clasp.  The sight absorbed me to the exclusion  of all fear.  I, David Crawfurd, nineteen years of age, an  assistant-storekeeper in a back-veld dorp,"]]]
