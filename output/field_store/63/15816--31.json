That suggestion hurt the Glass Cat more than anything else.  The Pink  Kitten always quarreled with the Glass Cat and insisted that flesh was  superior to glass, while the Glass Cat would jeer at the Pink Kitten,  because it had no pink brains.  But the pink brains were all daubed  with blue mud, just now, and if the Pink Kitten should see the Glass  Cat in such a condition, it would be dreadfully humiliating.    For several hours the Glass Cat walked along very meekly, but toward  noon it seized an opportunity when no one was looking and darted away  through the long grass.  It remembered that there was a tiny lake of  pure water near by, and to this lake the Cat sped as fast as it could  go.    The others never missed her until they stopped for lunch, and then it  was too late to hunt for her.    \"I s'pect she's gone somewhere to clean herself,\" said Dorothy.    \"Never mind,\" replied the Wizard.  \"Perhaps this glass creature has  been punished enough, and we must not forget she saved both Trot and  Cap'n Bill.\"    \"After first leading 'em onto an enchanted island,\" added Dorothy.  \"But I think, as you do, that the Glass Cat is punished enough, and  p'raps she won't try to pull the monkeys' tails again.\"    The Glass Cat did not rejoin the party of travelers.  She was still  resentful, and they moved too slowly to suit her, besides.  When they  arrived at the Royal Palace, one of the first things they saw was the  Glass Cat curled up on a bench as bright and clean and transparent as  ever.  But she pretended not to notice them, and they passed her by  without remark.          21.  The College of Athletic Arts      Dorothy and her friends arrived at the Royal Palace at an opportune  time, for Ozma was holding high court in her Throne Room, where  Professor H. M. Wogglebug, T.E., was appealing to her to punish some of  the students of the Royal Athletic College, of which he was the  Principal.    This College is located in the Munchkin Country, but not far from the  Emerald City.  To enable the students to devote their entire time to  athletic exercises, such as boating, foot-ball, and the like, Professor  Wogglebug had invented an assortment of Tablets of Learning.  One of  these tablets, eaten by a scholar after breakfast, would instantly  enable him to understand arithmetic or algebra or any other branch of  mathematics.  Another tablet eaten after lunch gave a student a  complete knowledge of geography.  Another tablet made it possible for  the eater to spell the most difficult words, and still another enabled  him to write a beautiful hand.  There were tablets for history,  mechanics, home cooking and agriculture, and it mattered not whether a  boy or a girl was stupid or bright, for the tablets taught them  everything in the twinkling of an eye.    This method, which is patented in the Land of Oz by Professor  Wogglebug, saves paper and books, as well as the tedious hours devoted  to study in some of our less favored schools, and it also allows the  students to devote all their time to racing, base-ball, tennis and  other manly and womanly sports, which are greatly interfered with by  study in those Temples of Learning where Tablets of Learning are  unknown.    But it so happened that Professor Wogglebug (who had invented so much  that he had acquired the habit) carelessly invented a Square-Meal  Tablet, which was no bigger than your little finger-nail but contained,  in condensed form, the equal of a bowl of soup, a portion of fried  fish, a roast, a salad and a dessert, all of which gave the same  nourishment as a square meal.    The Professor was so proud of these Square-Meal Tablets that he began  to feed them to the students at his college, instead of other food, but  the boys and girls objected because they wanted food that they could  enjoy the taste of.  It was no fun at all to swallow a tablet, with a  glass of water, and call it a dinner; so they refused to eat the  Square-Meal Tablets.  Professor Wogglebug insisted, and the result was  that the Senior Class seized the learned Professor one day and threw  him into the river--clothes and all.  Everyone knows that a wogglebug  cannot swim, and so the inventor of the wonderful Square-Meal Tablets  lay helpless on the bottom of the river for three days before a  fisherman caught one of his legs on a fishhook and dragged him out upon  the bank.    The learned Professor was naturally indignant at such treatment, and so  he brought the entire Senior Class to the Emerald City and appealed to  Ozma of Oz to punish them for their rebellion.    I do not suppose the girl Ruler was very severe with the rebellious  boys and girls, because she had herself refused to eat the Square-Meal  Tablets in place of food, but while she was listening to the  interesting case in her Throne Room, Cap'n Bill managed to carry the  golden flower-pot containing the Magic Flower up to Trot's room without  it being seen by anyone except Jellia Jamb, Ozma's chief Maid of Honor,  and Jellia promised not to tell.    Also the Wizard was able to carry the cage of monkeys up to one of the  top towers of the palace, where he had a room of his own, to which no  one came unless invited.  So Trot and Dorothy and Cap'n Bill and the  Wizard were all delighted at the successful end of their adventure.  The Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger went to the marble stables  behind the Royal Palace, where they lived while at home, and they too  kept the secret, even refusing to tell the Wooden Sawhorse, and Hank  the Mule, and the Yellow Hen, and the Pink Kitten where they had been.    Trot watered the Magic Flower every day and allowed no one in her room  to see the beautiful blossoms except her friends, Betsy Bobbin and  Dorothy.  The wonderful plant did not seem to lose any of its magic by  being removed from its island, and Trot was sure that Ozma would prize  it as one of her most delightful treasures.    Up in his tower the little Wizard of Oz began training his twelve tiny  monkeys, and the little creatures were so intelligent that they learned  every trick the Wizard tried to teach them.  The Wizard treated them  with great kindness and gentleness and gave them the food that monkeys  love best, so they promised to do their best on the great occasion of  Ozma's birthday.          22.  Ozma's Birthday Party      It seems odd that a fairy should have a birthday, for fairies, they  say, were born at the beginning of time and live forever.  Yet, on the  other hand, it would be a shame to deprive a fairy, who has so many  other good things, of the delights of a birthday.  So we need not  wonder that the fairies keep their birthdays just as other folks do,  and consider them occasions for feasting and rejoicing.    Ozma, the beautiful girl Ruler of the Fairyland of Oz, was a real  fairy, and so sweet and gentle in caring for her people that she was  greatly beloved by them all.  She lived in the most magnificent palace  in the most magnificent city in the world, but that did not prevent her  from being the friend of the most humble person in her dominions.  She  would mount her Wooden Sawhorse, and ride out to a farm house and sit  in the kitchen to talk with the good wife of the farmer while she did  her family baking; or she would play with the children and give them  rides on her famous wooden steed; or she would stop in a forest to  speak to a charcoal burner and ask if he was happy or desired anything  to make him more content; or she would teach young girls how to sew and  plan pretty dresses, or enter the shops where the jewelers and  craftsmen were busy and watch them at their work, giving to each and  all a cheering word or sunny smile.    And then Ozma would sit in her jeweled throne, with her chosen  courtiers all about her, and listen patiently to any complaint brought  to her by her subjects, striving to accord equal justice to all.  Knowing she was fair in her decisions, the Oz people never murmured at  her judgments, but agreed, if Ozma decided against them, she was right  and they wrong.    When Dorothy and Trot and Betsy Bobbin and Ozma were together, one  would think they were all about of an age, and the fairy Ruler no older  and no more \"grown up\" than the other three.  She would laugh and romp  with them in regular girlish fashion, yet there was an air of quiet  dignity about Ozma, even in her merriest moods, that, in a manner,  distinguished her from the others.  The three girls loved her  devotedly, but they were never able to quite forget that Ozma was the  Royal Ruler of the wonderful Fairyland of Oz, and by birth belonged to  a powerful race.    Ozma's palace stood in the center of a delightful and extensive garden,  where splendid trees and flowering shrubs and statuary and fountains  abounded.  One could walk for hours in this fascinating park and see  something interesting at every step.  In one place was an aquarium,  where strange and beautiful fish swam; at another spot all the birds of  the air gathered daily to a great feast which Ozma's servants provided  for them, and were so fearless of harm that they would alight upon  one's shoulders and eat from one's hand.  There was also the Fountain  of the Water of Oblivion, but it was dangerous to drink of this water,  because it made one forget everything he had ever before known, even to  his own name, and therefore Ozma had placed a sign of warning upon the  fountain.  But there were also fountains that were delightfully  perfumed, and fountains of delicious nectar, cool and richly flavored, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41934"],[0,"Idling in Italy: Studies of literature and of life (#20)"],[1,"  the hero are too successful to be veristic, and the eventuations of his  daily existence so far transcend ordinary experience that the reader  feels the profound improbability of it all and loses interest. One  pursues a novel that he may see the revelations of his own experiences  or what he might wish his experiences to be under certain circumstances.  When these circumstances get out of hand or when the events that  transpire are so improbable, or so antipathic, that the reader cannot  from his experience or imagination consider them likely or probable,  then the novel does not interest him. Moreover, the Anglo-Saxon reader,  unless he has lived in Italy, finds the flavor of many passages \"too  high\"--certain experiences are related in unnecessary detail. Like a  Cubist picture the charm and the beauty disappear in proportion with the  nearness with which it is viewed and the closeness with which it is  examined.    In reality, Pirandello did not get his stride until he began to concern  himself with social and domestic problems, such as those depicted under  the title of \"Maschere Nude\" (\"Naked Masks\"). In the play \"Il Piacere  dell' Onesta\" (\"The Pleasure of Honesty\"), he pictures a new type of  menage a trois: the \"unhappy\" husband in love with the mature daughter  of an aristocratic Philistine mother, who, when she must needs have a  husband for conventional satisfaction, appeals to a facile male cousin  who finds in a ne'er-do-well disciple of Descartes one who is willing to  act the part vicariously, the apparent quid pro quo being the payment of  his gambling debts. The hypocritical, bombastic lover; the sentimental  mother with a \"family complex\"; the anguishing, passionate daughter; the  suave, aristocratic male procurer, and finally he who was to be the  victim of the machinations of these experienced persons, but who proves  to be the victor because he plays the game in a way new to them--that  is, straight--each in turn delivers herself or himself of sentiments and  convictions that reveal the social hypocrisies and conventional lies  which form the scaffolding and supports of what is called \"every-day  life,\" and give Pirandello an opportunity to display his irony, his  sarcasm, and his humor. The art of Pirandello is a subtle play of  paradoxes and analyses of motives which are second nature to persons  called complex, the result of inherited and acquired artificialities. To  get the full effect of these paradoxes and analyses the closest  attention of the reader and of the auditor is required, and as a matter  of fact Pirandello's comedies read much better than they play. Those who  know maintain that he has little capacity for stage technic, that he  knows nothing of the art of the stage. Hence his comedies have not had  the success of Giacosa and of Bracco.    As human documents they depend upon their humor and veiled irony more  than upon any other qualities. The humor, which seems to be obtained by  simple means, is nearly always the result of an analysis so fine, so  subtle, that sometimes one loses track of the premises on which it is  founded. He compels the attention of his reader and he makes him think.  Without such attention and thought the subtleties of Pirandello often  escape the reader. Sometimes he labors a point almost to a tiresome  degree, for instance, in the play \"Cosi e se vi pare\" (\"It's so if You  Think It's so\"). The central point is the identity of a woman, which  would seem, to the average individual, could be established readily  beyond peradventure, but the point is--is there anything that can be  established beyond peradventure? Is there any such thing as literal  truth? Is not truth in reality synonymous with belief, individual or  collective, or both? Discussion of questions of this sort may become  very tiresome, but Pirandello has the art of mixing them up with human  weaknesses and human virtues which makes the mixture not only palatable  but appetizing. In his last comedies--\"Il Giuoco delle Parti\" (\"Each One  Plays His Own Role\") and \"Ma non e una Cosa Seria\" (\"But It isn't a  Serious Matter\")--he reverts to matrimonial tangles and attempts at  disentanglement, depicting in the former the \"temperamental\" woman who  gets what she wants, but who finds when she gets it she does not want  it, and the long-suffering husband who is discerning enough to know how  to handle her by conceding what she demands that he may get what he  should have.    The man who usurps the conjugal privileges of the husband must also  discharge his obligations. So it transpires when his temperamental wife  has been insulted by some intoxicated gilded youths who by their conduct  in her house provoke a scandal in the neighborhood, it is necessary for  the _de facto_ husband to challenge the most aggressive of them to a  duel. During the excitement of the preparation the happy thought comes  to him to have the vicarious husband fight the duel. He does so and is  killed. The cause of all the trouble, the lady, is quite ignorant of  this arrangement and thinks the _de facto_ husband is battling with the  most invincible sword of the city and that he will get killed, which is  her desire. On returning to her house she finds her husband lunching as  if nothing unusual had happened. The dramatic climax soon comes when she  scornfully taunts him with having some one fight a duel for him and he  replies: \"Not for me but for you.\"    The play gives Pirandello the opportunity to display his knowledge of  the sentiments and passions of the modern \"high life\" individual.  Although they talk and act and express familiar sentiment in a way that  makes one think they are real people, in reality they are unreal. They  are taken from the author's imagination rather than from real life.    The second comedy in this volume is much more meritorious than the  first. The author portrays characters who well might have existed in the  flesh. Gasparina, who has put twenty-seven years of continency behind  her and had achieved the direction of a second-class boarding-house, is  derided and maltreated by her \"guests.\" The most swagger of her  boarders, who has been miraculously saved in a duel which followed a  broken engagement, has an original idea. He will make a mock marriage  with her and thus establish freedom from further love, annoyance, and  duels. She sees in the proposal escape from the boarding-house. In the  little villa of the country to which he sends her, under promise that  she is not to make herself evident and where he is not to visit her, she  blooms like a flower. In due course of time he falls in love again, and  in order that he may accomplish matrimony he must free himself from  Gasparina. This could be accomplished, as it never was consummated, but  the messenger, an old aspirant to her favor, is on the point of having  his aspirations realized when the husband in name only sees in Gasparina  the woman he really loves. The curtain falls at an opportune moment  before any hearts are broken or any blood is shed.    It is one of the plays of Pirandello that has had considerable success  on the stage.    He is in reality a finished workman, an accomplished stylist, a happy  colorist, and fecund withal. His most important of the stories are \"Erma  bifronte\" (\"Deceitful Hermes\"), \"La Vita Nuda\" (\"Naked Life\"), \"La  Trappola\" (\"The Snare\"), \"E Domani ... lunedi\" (\"And  To-morrow--Monday\"), \"Un Cavallo Nella Luna\" (\"A Horse in the Moon\"),  \"Quand ero matto\" (\"When I was Crazy\"), \"Bianche e Nere\" (\"Blacks and  Whites\"); his romances, in addition to the ones already mentioned, are  \"I Vecchi e I Giovani\" (\"The Old and the Young\"), and \"Si Gira\" (\"One  Turns\"), the most recent and poorest of them.    It would be a mistake to convey the impression that Pirandello is  universally admired in Italy. His stories and romances have an  adventuresome quality that transcend ordinary experience, and his plays  attempt to dispense with theatricalness and to substitute for it a  subtle analysis of life with corrosive comment, both of which are very  much resented.    It is strange that the Freudians have never explained the popularity of  plays and novels concerned wholly or largely with sexual relations that  infract convention and law as dominancy of the unconscious mind, a \"wish  fulfilment\" of the waking state. It may be assumed that three-fourths of  those who see and read them never have, and never contemplate (with  their conscious minds) having, similar experiences. They would be  scandalized were any one to assume that they approved such conduct.  Perhaps the explanation of the hold such literature has upon the public  is the same as the interest we have in the accounts of criminals seeking  to evade apprehension. It is not that we sympathize in any way with the  malefactor. We are lawmaking, law-abiding, law-upholding citizens, and  we know he ought not to escape, and, naturally, we hope he will be  caught. However, we cannot help thinking what we would do confronted  with his predicament. We feel that in his place we could circumvent the  sleuths and overcome what would be to the ordinary person insuperable  obstacles. Thus we divert ourselves imagining what we would do if we  were adulterous husbands, lecherous wives, lubricitous wooers, vicarious  spouses, while assuring ourselves we are not and could never be, and  plume ourselves that we could conduct ourselves even in nefariousness in  such a way as to escape detection or, if detected, to disarm criticism.  Meanwhile we enjoy being virtue-rewarded and vice-punished, for it is  only upon the stage or in books that it happens, save in exceptional  instances.          CHAPTER VII    IMPROVISIONAL ITALIAN LITERATURE OF TO-DAY AND YESTERDAY      I never fully appreciated how hazardous it is to speak of the literature  of a foreign country until I read an article in the _Tribuna_ of Rome,  signed Mario Vinciguerra, on Michaud's \"Mystiques"]]]
