Train'd by nice art each flexile limb to wind,    Their twinkling feet the measured maze entwined,    Fleet as the wheel whose use the potter tries,    When, twirl'd beneath his hand, its axle flies.    Now all at once their graceful ranks combine,    Each rang'd against the other, line with line.      The crowd flock'd round, and, wondering as they view'd,    Thro' every change the varying dance pursued;    The while two tumblers, as they led the song,    Turned in the midst and rolled themselves along.    Then, last, the god the force of Ocean bound,    And poured its waves the buckler's orb around.      --B. XVIII. SOTHEBY'S Trans.      Achilles Engages in the Fight.    Desire to avenge the death of Patroclus proves more powerful  in the breast of Achilles than anger against Agamemnon, and,  clad in his new armor, he is with difficulty restrained from  rushing alone into the fight while his comrades are resting.  Turning and addressing his horses, he reproaches them with the  death of Patroclus. One of them is represented as being  Miraculously endowed with voice, and, replying to Achilles,  prophesies his death in the near future; but, with unabated rage,  the intrepid chief replies:                                \"So let it be!    Portents and prodigies are lost on me.    I know my fate: to die, to see no more    My much-loved parents and my native shore.    Enough--when Heaven ordains I sink in night.    Now perish Troy!\" he said, and rushed to fight.    Jupiter now assembles the gods in council, and permits them to  assist either party. The poet vividly describes the terrors of  the combat and the tumult that arose when \"the powers descending  swelled the fight.\" Achilles first encounters AEne'as, who is  preserved by Neptune; he then meets Hector, whom he is on the  point of killing, when Apollo rescues him and carries him away  in a cloud. The Trojans, defeated with terrible slaughter, are  driven into the river Scamander, where Achilles receives the aid  of Neptune and Pallas.      This Death of Hector.    Vulcan having dried up the Scamander in aid of the Trojans, all  those who survive, save Hector, seek refuge in Troy. This hero  alone remains without the walls to oppose Achilles. At the  latter's advance, however, Hector's resolution and courage fail  him, and he flees, pursued by Achilles three times around the  city; At length he turns upon his pursuer, determined to meet  his fate; and the account of the meeting and contest with Achilles,  as translated by BRYANT, is as follows:      He spake, and drew the keen-edged sword that hung,    Massive and finely tempered, at his side,    And sprang--as when an eagle high in heaven    Through the thick cloud darts downward to the plain,    To clutch some tender lamb or timid hare.    So Hector, brandishing that keen-edged sword,    Sprang forward, while Achilles opposite    Leaped toward him, all on fire with savage hate,    And holding his bright buckler, nobly wrought,    Before him. As in the still hours of night    Hesper goes forth among the host of stars,    The fairest light of heaven, so brightly shone,    Brandished in the right hand of Pe'leus' son,    The spear's keen blade, as, confident to slay    The noble Hector, o'er his glorious form    His quick eye ran, exploring where to plant    The surest wound. The glittering mail of brass    Won from the slain Patroclus guarded well    Each part, save only where the collar-bones    Divide the shoulder from the neck, and there    Appeared the throat, the spot where life is most    In peril. Through that part the noble son    Of Peleus drave his spear; it went quite through    The tender neck, and yet the brazen blade    Cleft not the windpipe, and the power to speak    Remained.      And then the crested Hector faintly said:    \"I pray thee, by thy life, and by thy knees,    And by thy parents, suffer not the dogs    To tear me at the galleys of the Greeks.    Accept abundant store of brass and gold,    Which gladly will my father and the queen,    My mother, give in ransom. Send to them    My body, that the warriors and the dames    Of Troy may light for me the funeral pile.\"      The swift Achilles answered, with a frown:    \"Nay, by my knees entreat me not, thou cur,    Nor by my parents. I could even wish    My fury prompted me to cut thy flesh    In fragments and devour it, such the wrong    That I have had from thee. There will be none    To drive away the dogs about thy head,    Not though thy Trojan friends should bring to me    Tenfold and twentyfold the offered gifts,    And promise others--not though Priam, sprung    From Dar'danus, should send thy weight in gold.    Thy mother shall not lay thee on thy bier,    To sorrow over thee whom she brought forth;    But dogs and birds of prey shall mangle thee.\"      And then the crested Hector, dying, said:    \"I know thee, and too clearly I foresaw    I should not move thee, for thou hast a heart    Of iron. Yet reflect that for my sake    The anger of the gods may fall on thee    When Paris and Apollo strike thee down,    Strong as thou art, before the Scae'an gates.\"      Thus Hector spake, and straightway o'er him closed    The light of death; the soul forsook his limbs,    And flew to Hades, grieving for its fate,    So soon divorced from youth and youthful might.    The great achievement of Achilles was followed by funeral games  in honor of Patroclus, and by the institution of various other  festivities. At their close Jupiter sends The'tis to Achilles to  influence him to restore the dead body of Hector to his family,  and sends Iris to Priam to encourage him to go in person to treat  for it. Priam thereupon sets out upon his journey, and, having  arrived at the camp of Achilles, thus appeals to his compassion:      Priam Begging for the Body of Hector.      \"Think, O Achilles, semblance of the gods,    On thine own father, full of days like me,    And trembling on the gloomy verge of life.    Some neighbor chief, it may be, even now    Oppresses him, and there is none at hand,    No friend, to succor him in his distress.    Yet, doubtless, hearing that Achilles lives,    He still rejoices, hoping day by day    That one day he shall see the face again    Of his own son, from distant Troy returned.    But me no comfort cheers, whose bravest sons,    So late the flowers of Ilium, are all slain.      \"When, Greece came hither I had fifty sons;    But fiery Mars hath thinned them. One I had--    One, more than all my sons, the strength of Troy,    Whom, standing for his country, thou hast slain--    Hector. His body to redeem I come    Into Achaia's fleet, bringing, myself,    Ransom inestimable to thy tent.    Rev'rence the gods, Achilles! recollect    Thy father; for his sake compassion show    To me, more pitiable still, who draw    Home to my lips (humiliation yet    Unseen on earth) his hand who slew my son!\"      --COWPER'S Trans.    Achilles, moved with compassion, granted the request of the  grief-stricken father, and sent him home with the body of his  son. First to the corse the weeping Androm'ache flew, and thus  spoke:      Lamentation of Andromache.      \"And oh, my Hector! Oh, my lord! (she cries)    Snatched in thy bloom from these desiring eyes!    Thou to the dismal realms forever gone!    And I abandoned, desolate, alone!    An only son, once comfort of our pains,    Sad product now of hapless love, remains!    Never to manly age that son shall rise,    Or with increasing graces glad my eyes;    For Ilion now (her great defender slain)    Shall sink a smoking ruin on the plain.      \"Who now protects her wives with guardian care?    Who saves her infants from the rage of war?    Now hostile fleets must waft those infants o'er    (Those wives must wait them) to a foreign shore:    Thou too, my son, to barbarous climes shalt go,    The sad companion of thy mother's woe;    Or else some Greek whose father pressed the plain,    Or son, or brother, by great Hector slain,    In Hector's blood his vengeance shall enjoy,    And hurl thee headlong from the towers of Troy.\"    [Footnote: Such was the fate of Astyanax, Hector's    son, when Troy was taken:        \"Here, from the tower by stem Ulysses thrown,      Andromache bewailed her infant son.\"        --MERRICK'S Tryphiodo'rus.]    The death of Hector was also lamented by Helen, and her  lamentation is thus spoken of by COLERIDGE: \"I have always  thought the following speech, in which Helen laments Hector, and  hints at her own invidious and unprotected situation in Troy, as  almost the sweetest passage in the poem. It is another striking  instance of that refinement of feeling and softness of tone which  so generally distinguish the last book of the Iliad from the rest.\"      Helen's Lamentation.      \"Ah, dearest friend! in whom the gods had joined    The mildest manners with the bravest mind,    Now twice ten years (unhappy years) are o'er    Since Paris brought me to the Trojan shore;    (Oh, had I perished ere that form divine    Seduced this soft, this easy heart of mine!)    Yet was it ne'er my fate from thee to find    A deed ungentle, or a word unkind:    When others cursed the authoress of their woe,    Thy pity checked my sorrows in their flow:    If some proud brother eyed me with disdain,    Or scornful sister, with her sweeping train,    Thy gentle accents softened all my pain.    For thee I mourn; and mourn myself in thee,    The wretched source of all this misery.    The fate I caused forever I bemoan;    Sad Helen has no friend, now thou art gone!    Through Troy's wide streets abandoned shall I roam!    In Troy deserted, as abhorred at home!\"      --POPE'S Trans.      THE FATE OF TROY.    Homer's Iliad ends with the burial of Hector, and gives no  account of the result of the war and the fate of the chief actors  in the conflict. But in VIRGIL'S AEne'id, which gives an account  of the escape of AEne'as, from the flames of Troy, and of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6852"],[0,"Venus in Furs (#20)"],[1,"Yes--\" he moaned--    Wanda left the room for a moment, and returned with ropes.    \"Well--are you still brave enough to put yourself into the power of  Venus in Furs, the beautiful despot, for better or worse?\" she began  ironically.    \"Yes, tie me,\" the painter replied dully. Wanda tied his hands on  his back and drew a rope through his arms and a second one around his  body, and fettered him to the cross-bars of the window. Then she  rolled back the fur, seized the whip, and stepped in front of him.    The scene had a grim attraction for me, which I cannot describe. I  felt my heart beat, when, with a smile, she drew back her arm for the  first blow, and the whip hissed through the air. He winced slightly  under the blow. Then she let blow after blow rain upon him, with her  mouth half-opened and her teeth flashing between her red lips, until  he finally seemed to ask for mercy with his piteous, blue eyes. It  was indescribable.           *       *       *       *       *    She is sitting for him now, alone. He is working on her head.    She has posted me in the adjoining room behind a heavy curtain,  where I can't be seen, but can see everything.    What does she intend now?    Is she afraid of him? She has driven him insane enough to be sure,  or is she hatching a new torment for me? My knees tremble.    They are talking. He has lowered his voice so that I cannot  understand a word, and she replies in the same way. What is the  meaning of this? Is there an understanding between them?    I suffer frightful torments; my heart seems about to burst.    He kneels down before her, embraces her, and presses his head  against her breast, and she--in her heartlessness--laughs--and now  I hear her saying aloud:    \"Ah! You need another application of the whip.\"    \"Woman! Goddess! Are you without a heart--can't you love,\" exclaimed  the German, \"don't you even know, what it means to love, to be  consumed with desire and passion, can't you even imagine what I  suffer? Have you no pity for me?\"    \"No!\" she replied proudly and mockingly, \"but I have the whip.\"    She drew it quickly from the pocket of her fur-coat, and struck him  in the face with the handle. He rose, and drew back a couple of paces.    \"Now, are you ready to paint again?\" she asked indifferently. He did  not reply, but again went to the easel and took up his brush and  palette.    The painting is marvellously successful. It is a portrait which as  far as the likeness goes couldn't be better, and at the same time it  seems to have an ideal quality. The colors glow, are supernatural;  almost diabolical, I would call them.    The painter has put all his sufferings, his adoration, and all his  execration into the picture.           *       *       *       *       *    Now he is painting me; we are alone together for several hours every  day. To-day he suddenly turned to me with his vibrant voice and said:    \"You love this woman?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I also love her.\" His eyes were bathed in tears. He remained silent  for a while, and continued painting.    \"We have a mountain at home in Germany within which she dwells,\" he  murmured to himself. \"She is a demon.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The picture is finished. She insisted on paying him for it,  munificently, in the manner of queens.    \"Oh, you have already paid me,\" he said, with a tormented smile,  refusing her offer.    Before he left, he secretly opened his portfolio, and let me look  inside. I was startled. Her head looked at me as if out of a mirror  and seemed actually to be alive.    \"I shall take it along,\" he said, \"it is mine; she can't take it  away from me. I have earned it with my heart's blood.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"I am really rather sorry for the poor painter,\" she said to me to-day,  \"it is absurd to be as virtuous as I am. Don't you think so too?\"    I did not dare to reply to her.    \"Oh, I forgot that I am talking with a slave; I need some fresh air,  I want to be diverted, I want to forget.    \"The carriage, quick!\"    Her new dress is extravagant: Russian half-boots of violet-blue  velvet trimmed with ermine, and a skirt of the same material,  decorated with narrow stripes and rosettes of furs. Above it is an  appropriate, close-fitting jacket, also richly trimmed and lined with  ermine. The headdress is a tall cap of ermine of the style of  Catherine the Second, with a small aigrette, held in place by a  diamond-agraffe; her red hair falls loose down her back. She ascends  on the driver's seat, and holds the reins herself; I take my seat  behind. How she lashes on the horses! The carriage flies along like  mad.    Apparently it is her intention to attract attention to-day, to make  conquests, and she succeeds completely. She is the lioness of the  Cascine. People nod to her from carriages; on the footpath people  gather in groups to discuss her. She pays no attention to anyone,  except now and then acknowledging the greetings of elderly gentlemen  with a slight nod.    Suddenly a young man on a lithe black horse dashes up at full speed.  As soon as he sees Wanda, he stops his horse and makes it walk. When  he is quite close, he stops entirely and lets her pass. And she too  sees him--the lioness, the lion. Their eyes meet. She madly drives  past him, but she cannot tear herself free from the magic power of  his look, and she turns her head after him.    My heart stops when I see the half-surprised, half-enraptured look  with which she devours him, but he is worthy of it.    For he is, indeed, a magnificent specimen of man, No, rather, he is  a man whose like I have never yet seen among the living. He is in the  Belvedere, graven in marble, with the same slender, yet steely  musculature, with the same face and the same waving curls. What makes  him particularly beautiful is that he is beardless. If his hips were  less narrow, one might take him for a woman in disguise. The curious  expression about the mouth, the lion's lip which slightly discloses  the teeth beneath, lends a flashing tinge of cruelty to the beautiful  face--    Apollo flaying Marsyas.    He wears high black boots, closely fitting breeches of white  leather, short fur coat of black cloth, of the kind worn by Italian  cavalry officers, trimmed with astrakhan and many rich loops; on his  black locks is a red fez.    I now understand the masculine Eros, and I marvel at Socrates for  having remained virtuous in view of an Alcibiades like this.           *       *       *       *       *    I have never seen my lioness so excited. Her cheeks flamed when she  left from the carriage at her villa. She hurried upstairs, and with  an imperious gesture ordered me to follow.    Walking up and down her room with long strides, she began to talk so  rapidly, that I was frightened.    \"You are to find out who the man in the Cascine was, immediately--    \"Oh, what a man! Did you see him? What do you think of him? Tell me.\"    \"The man is beautiful,\" I replied dully.    \"He is so beautiful,\" she paused, supporting herself on the arm of  a chair, \"that he has taken my breath away.\"    \"I can understand the impression he has made on you,\" I replied, my  imagination carrying me away in a mad whirl. \"I am quite lost in  admiration myself, and I can imagine--\"    \"You may imagine,\" she laughed aloud, \"that this man is my lover,  and that he will apply the lash to you, and that you will enjoy being  punished by him.    \"But now go, go.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Before evening fell, I had the desired information.    Wanda was still fully dressed when I returned. She reclined on the  ottoman, her face buried in her hands, her hair in a wild tangle,  like the red mane of a lioness.    \"What is his name?\" she asked, uncanny calm.    \"Alexis Papadopolis.\"    \"A Greek, then,\"    I nodded.    \"He is very young?\"    \"Scarcely older than you. They say he was educated in Paris, and  that he is an atheist. He fought against the Turks in Candia, and is  said to have distinguished himself there no less by his race-hatred  and cruelty, than by his bravery.\"    \"All in all, then, a man,\" she cried with sparkling eyes.    \"At present he is living in Florence,\" I continued, \"he is said to  be tremendously rich--\"    \"I didn't ask you about that,\" she interrupted quickly and sharply.  \"The man is dangerous. Aren't you afraid of him? I am afraid of him.  Has he a wife?\"    \"No.\"    \"A mistress?\"    \"No.\"    \"What theaters does he attend?\"    \"To-night he will be at the Nicolini Theater, where Virginia Marini  and Salvini are acting; they are the greatest living artists in  Italy, perhaps in Europe.    \"See that you get a box--and be quick about it!\" she commanded.    \"But, mistress--\"    \"Do you want a taste of the whip?\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"You can wait down in the lobby,\" she said when I had placed the  opera-glasses and the programme on the edge of her box and adjusted  the footstool.    I am standing there and had to lean against the wall for support so  as not to fall down with envy and rage--no, rage isn't the right  word; it was a mortal fear.    I saw her in her box dressed in blue moire, with a huge ermine cloak  about her bare shoulders; he sat opposite. I saw them devour each  other with their eyes. For both of them the stage, Goldoni's _Pamela,_  Salvini, Marini, the public, even the entire world, were non-existant  to-night. And I--what was I at that moment?--           *       *       *       *       *    To-day she is attending the ball at the Greek ambassador's. Does she  know, that she will meet him there?    At any rate she dressed, as if she did. A heavy sea-green silk dress  plastically encloses her divine form, leaving the bust and arms bare. In  her hair, which is done into a single flaming knot, a white water-lily  blossoms; from it the leaves of reeds interwoven with a few loose  strands fall down toward her neck. There no longer"]]]
