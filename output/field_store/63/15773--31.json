She withdraws the lance from the wound, which is then closed  and dressed with herbs.    \"During the ceremony a torch is always burning, and the old woman who  pierced the pig takes and puts it out with her mouth; the other old  woman dips the end of her trumpet in the pig's blood, and with it marks  with blood the forehead of her husband and of her companion, and then of  the rest of the people. But they did not come and do this to us.    \"That done the old women took off their robes and ate what was in the  two dishes, inviting only women to join them. After that they get the  hair off the pig with fire. Only old women are able to consecrate the  boar, and this animal is never eaten unless it is killed in this  manner.\"    Pigafetta saw wonderful things in Borneo, among them a wild boar whose  head was two and a half spans long, and oysters as large as turtles. He  says that the flesh of one of these oysters weighed forty-five pounds.    But the thing there which probably must have most greatly excited his  curiosity was the _walking leaves_. There were certain trees on the  islands that had very animated leaves. When one of these leaves fell  from the tree, it did not lie where it fell, to rot or to be shuffled by  the winds, but it lifted itself up and walked away.    Here was a sight indeed to make the young Italian fly to his memoranda  book, which he did.    Other travelers later saw the same curious thing, but they examined the  miracle more closely than the credulous Chevalier. They found that the  leaves were moved by an insect that lived inside of them, like the  Mexican bean, which is used as a toy, and will jump about a table.    The islands of the Indian Ocean abound in sandalwood. Of the sandal  trees Pigafetta heard other curious legends. One of them tells us that  when the people of the Timor went out to cut sandalwood, the devil  appeared to them, and demanded them to bargain with him for the wood.  This they did, for those who cut the wood are otherwise likely to fall  sick; a poisonous miasma is exhaled from the wounded wood.    Pigafetta heard also marvelous tales of the Emperor of China, who seemed  to live amid human walls. There may be some truths in these incidents;  if so, what a remarkable condition must have been that of the Chinese  court four hundred years ago!    He says:    \"The kingdom of Cocchi lies next; its sovereign is named Raja Seri  Bummipala. After that follows Great China, the king of which is the  greatest sovereign of the world, and is called Santoa Raja. He has  seventy crowned kings under his dependence; and some of these kings have  ten or fifteen lesser kings dependent on them. The port of this kingdom  is named Guantan, and among the many cities of this Empire, two are the  most important, namely, Nankin and Comlaha, where the King usually  resides.    \"He has four of his principal ministers close to his palace, at the four  sides looking to the four cardinal winds; that is, one to the west, one  to the east, to the south, and to the north. Each of these gives  audience to those that come from his quarter. All the kings and lords of  India major and superior obey this King, and in token of their  vassalage, each is obliged to have in the middle of the principal palace  of his city the marble figure of a certain animal named Chinga, an  animal more valuable than the lion; the figure of this animal is also  engraved on the King's seal, and all who wish to enter his port must  carry the same emblem in wax or ivory.    \"If any lord is disobedient to him, he is flayed, and his skin, dried in  the sun, salted, and stuffed, is placed in an eminent part of the public  place, with the head inclined and the hands on the head in the attitude  of doing zongu; that is obeisance to the King.    \"He is never visible to anybody; and if he wishes to see his people he  is carried about the palace on a peacock most skillfully manufactured  and very richly adorned, with six ladies dressed exactly like himself,  so that he can not be distinguished from them. He afterward passes into  a richly adorned figure of a serpent called Naga, which has a large  glass in the breast, through which he and the ladies are seen, but it is  not possible to distinguish which is the King. He marries his sisters in  order that his blood should not mix with that of others.    \"His palace has seven walls around it, and in each circle there are  daily ten thousand men on guard, who are changed every twelve hours at  the sound of a bell. Each wall has its gate, with a guard at each gate.  At the first stands a man with a great scourge in his hand, named  Satuhoran with satubagan; at the second, a dog called Satuhain; at the  third, a man with an iron mace, called Satuhoran with pocumbecin; at the  fourth, a man with a bow in his hand, called Saturhoran with anatpanan;  at the fifth, a man with a lance, called Satuhoran with tumach; at the  sixth, a lion, called Saturhorimau; at the seventh, two white elephants,  called Gagiapute.    \"The palace contains seventy-nine halls, in which dwell only the ladies  destined to serve the King; there are always torches burning there. It  is not possible to go round the palace in less than a day. In the upper  part of it are four halls where the ministers go to speak to the King;  one is ornamented with metal, both the pavement and the walls; another  is all of silver, another all of gold, and the other is set with pearls  and precious stones. The gold and other valuable things which are  brought as tribute to the King are placed in these rooms; and when they  are there deposited, they say, 'Let this be for the honor and glory of  our Santoa Raja.' All these things and many others relating to this  King, were narrated to us by a Moor, who said that he had seen them.\"    A palace of seven walls, seventy-nine halls, and ten thousand men on  guard! A hall of silver, another of gold, and one of precious stones! It  took a day to encompass it. We may well wonder how much of truth there  was in this brief Oriental story!    When the adventurers came to Java they heard some tales that were  marvelous, and that quite equaled those which Queen Scheherezade of the  Arabian Nights told of Sinbad the Sailor.    One of these fabulous stories, told them by a pilot, had an Oriental  charm and coloring. It was of a giant bird, like the roc of the Arabian  Nights.    According to this fanciful legend which we give with some freedom, there  was a land called Java Major on the north of the Gulf of China, where  grew an enormous tree, seemingly as big as a mountain--one of the  greatest trees in all the world. In this tree, which might have shaded a  hill, lived a colony of birds, with wings like clouds, so broad and  powerful that they could lift an elephant or a buffalo into the air and  bear him away to the mountainous tree. The fruit of this tree was larger  than the largest melons.    There were Moors on the ship where this story of the great tree and the  great bird was told. One of them said:    \"I have _seen_ the great bird with my own eyes!\"    Another Moor said:    \"One of the birds was once captured, and sent as a present to the King  of Siam!\"    An account of the capture of such a bird would have been very  interesting!    There were great whirlpools around the mountainous tree. So that no ship  could approach within three or four leagues of it.    But once, according to the legend, some adventurous sailors sailed near  the great tree. They had a little boy on board their boat, and he must  have surveyed the giant of the forest with wonder.    They sailed too near, for presently their boat began to go round and  round, and they found themselves in the power of the whirlpool.    Round and round went the junk until it struck against a rock, and all  on board perished, except the little boy, who was supple.    This child caught a plank and held on to it. He was carried hither and  thither among the eddies and breakers, but he found himself drawing  nearer and nearer the great tree. At last he was cast on shore at the  foot of the tree.    \"Here must be my home,\" said he, for he thought he never could get away  again. No boat could come to him, and _he_ could not fly.    The tree had great masses of bark, so that he could climb up into it. He  mounted up to its high limbs. He could not starve, for the fruit of such  a tree must have been sufficient to have supplied a colony.    So cast away on the tree, he here expected to live and to die.    Toward sunset great wings like clouds darkened the shining air. The  birds were coming home to-night in the tree. Their nests were there as  big as houses.    They settled down, causing a great wind, and put their great heads under  their wings and went to sleep.    The boy was bright, and a plan of getting away from the tree came to  him. He reasoned that if he could not fly the bird could, and what would  be the weight of a little boy to a bird who could carry away an  elephant?    So he marked the largest and most powerful bird with his eye, and crept  up to it and got under his wing, and into his great feathers.    The bird was asleep and did not wake!    Morning came, and with the first red dawn, as we may fancy, the bird  threw up his head and begun to stir. He lifted himself up and shook  himself, but he did not shake off the boy, who was safely nestled among  the little forest of its feathers.    The sun was brightening the islands, and the bird mounted up and flew  away in search of food, carrying the little boy under his wing.    After traversing the sunrise air for a long time, the bird flew over a  land of buffaloes.    He here descended to capture a buffalo, to bear him away to the  mountainous tree for food.

The nasals are moderate in size;  because of the anterior angularity of the lateral margins, the long axes  of the nasals lie parallel to the maxillary. The nasals are only  slightly pointed anteriorly, and posteriorly they bear short, blunt  palatine processes and medial processes in contact with the lateral  corners of the ethmoid. The ethmoid is fully ossified, but does not  extend anteriorly between the nasals. The squamosals are moderate in  size and extend one-fourth the distance from the dorsal end of the  quadrate to the maxillary. The tegmen tympani are relatively large, but  proportionately short.    The cranial characters utilized in the analysis of species groups  (general shape, nature of the nasals, ethmoid, squamosals, and tegmen  tympani), together with other characters, such as the relative height  and shape of the prenasal processes, the extent of the internasal  septum, and the nature of the vomers, frontoparietals, maxillaries and  pterygoids are useful in distinguishing the various species (Table 4,  Fig. 8), as well as in establishing relationships within the  species-groups.    Within the _sordida_ group, _S. sordida_ and _S. puma_ can be  distinguished by the following characters: The bony part of the ethmoid  terminates posterior to the anterior edge of the orbit and is thus  widely separated from the nasals by cartilage in _S. puma_. In _S.  sordida_ the bony part of the ethmoid always terminates at a level equal  to, or slightly in front of the anterior edge of the orbit; therefore,  less cartilage exists between the ethmoid and nasals in _S. sordida_  than in _S. puma_. The width of the premaxillary comprises about 30 per  cent of the width of the skull in _S. sordida_ and 20 per cent in _S.  puma_. The proportion of the length of the skull anterior to the bony  part of the ethmoid in _S. sordida_ is approximately 21 per cent, as  compared with about 29 per cent in _S. puma_. The prenasal processes are  convex in _S. sordida_ and straight in _S. puma_.    The marked ontogenetic variation in _S. sordida_ is considered in more  detail in the account of that species, but it is pertinent to the  present discussion to note that with respect to some features of the  skull some young breeding specimens of _S. sordida_ are intermediate in  appearance between large females of _S. sordida_ and adults of _S.  puma_. In some breeding males (usually the smaller individuals) of _S.  sordida_ the bony part of the ethmoid terminates at the anterior edge of  the orbit and is widely separated from the nasals by cartilage. In small  individuals _S. sordida_, especially in males, and in adults of _S.  puma_ the tegmen tympani are relatively short, whereas in adult females  of _S. sordida_ these elements are long and slender. In the smaller  specimens of _S. sordida_ and in _S. puma_ the squamosal is small; it  extends only about one-fourth of the distance to the maxillary in the  smaller _S. sordida_ and about one-half the distance in _S. puma_. The  more massive squamosal in large adult females of _S. sordida_ extends at  least two-thirds of the distance to the maxillary.
