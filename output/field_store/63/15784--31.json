She told me it was the note  of a little bird, something like a wren, called Durrooee, in whose  shape the spirits of dead women revisited the earth. It seems that  Numbardee, the first woman, was, like Milton's Eve, a caterer; she  acquired art in beating the roots of plants into flat cakes much  esteemed; she was never to be met without some, carrying them always in  a bag across her shoulders.    And Byamee was so pleased with her for always having food for the  hungry that, when at length she died, he allowed her to revisit her old  gahreemai, or camp, her spirit returning in the form of the little  honey-eater bird, Durrooee; and all women after her had a like  privilege if they had done their duty in life. These birds are sacred;  no one must harm them, nor even imitate their cry. It would be hard to  hurt them, for the spirit in them is so strong. If any one even takes  up a stick or stone to throw at them, hardly is it raised from the  ground when the would-be assailant is forcibly knocked over, though he  sees nothing but the little bird he was about to attack. Then he knows  the bird must be a spirit bird, and perhaps seeing him look at her, the  bird calls a woman's name, then he knows whose spirit it is.    A black boy on the station was badly hurt by a fall from a tree. It had  seemed strange that such a good climber should fall. The blacks said it  was because there was a Durrooee's nest in that tree, the spirit had  knocked him down, and for a time so paralysed the man with him that he  could not move to his assistance. Needless to say, they have avoided  that tree since.    In the distance we heard the sound of the grave being dug. None of the  same totem as the dead person must dig the grave. The coffin was put  down beside the grave, the daughter and other nearest women relations  stayed with it, the other women went away into the bush in one  direction, some of the men in another.    Old Hippi heaped up some Budtha twigs he had gathered, I noticed as we  came along; these he set fire to, and made a dense smoke which hung low  over the open grave and spread over the old graves.    Hippi smoked himself in this smoke. The women came back with arms full  of small branches of the sacred Dheal tree, these they laid beside the  grave, then sat down and broke them into small twigs; the old women had  twigs put through the bored hole in their noses.    The men came back with some pine saplings; two of these they laid at  the bottom of the grave, which was about five feet deep. On these pines  they spread strips of bark, then a thick bed of Dheal twigs; then a  woman handed a bag containing the belongings of the dead woman--boogurr  they were called--to the oldest male relative, who was standing in the  grave; he placed it as a pillow at one end. Then Hippi and the  daughter's husband took each an end of the coffin and lowered it into  the grave; the daughter cried loudly as they did so. Over the coffin  they laid a rug, and on the rug they placed Beemunny's yam stick. Hippi  signalled to the daughter, who then came with the other women close to  the edge of the grave. She sat at one end, looked over into the grave,  and called out: 'My mother! Oh, my mother! Come back to me, my mother!  My mother that I have been with always, why did you leave me?' Then she  wailed the death-wait, which the other women caught up. As the wail  died away, Hippi said:      'She has gone from us; never as she was will she return.    Never more as she once did will she chop honey.    Never more with her gunnai dig yams.    She has gone from us; never as she was to return.'    As he finished all the women wailed again, and loudest of all the  daughter. Then the old man in the grave said:      'Mussels there are in the creek and plenty,    But she who lies here will dig no more.    We shall fish as of old for cod-fish,    But she who lies here will beg no more oil,    Oil for her hair, she will want no more.'    Then again the women wailed.    Old Hippi said, as the other man, in a sort of recitative      'Never again will she use a fire.    Where she goes fires are not.    For she goes to the women, the dead women,    And women can make no fires.    Fruit is there in plenty and grass seed,    But no birds nor beasts in the heaven of woman.'    Again the women wailed, wail after wail. Then they handed the remaining  twigs of Dheal to the men, who laid them on the top of the coffin, then  bark again over the twigs, and pine saplings on them, on top some old  rugs.    While this was being done the old, old gins danced slowly a corroboree  step round the edge of the grave, crooning a Goohnai-wurrai or dirge.    Then the men began to throw in the earth, the oldest male relative of  the deceased standing in the grave to guard the body until the earth  covered the coffin. As thud after thud went the earth in, the daughter  shrieked and swayed over as if to fall into the grave, but her friend  drew her back. She called 'Mother! mother!' took a sharp stone which  was beside her and hit it against her head until the blood gushed out.  They took the stone from her. There she sat rocking her body to and  fro, wailing all the time, the other women wailing too, until the grave  was quite covered in.    When it was filled in Hippi made another big smoke, thoroughly smoked  himself, calling to all the men to do the same.    An old woman made a big smoke behind where the women were sitting; she  called them one by one and made them stand in the thick of it for a  while.    Hippi said something to her. I caught the word 'Innerah'--they called  me Innerah, which meant literally a woman with a camp of her own. The  old woman gave the smoke fire a stir, and out at once came a thick  column of smoke circling round my guest and myself.    They covered the grave with logs and boughs and then swept round it.    All was over, we turned homewards. As we did so a flock of screeching  gilahs flew over, their bright rose colouring lighting up the sombre  scene where the only colour was that of the dark pines silhouetted  against a sky from which the blue had now faded. Going home Bootha told  me that the smoking process was to keep the spirits away, and to  disinfect us from any disease the dead might have; and she said had we  not been smoked the spirits might have followed us back to the house.    They would at once change their camp; the old one would be gummarl--a  tabooed place; but before they left it they would burn smoke fires  there to scare away the spirits.    I asked her why they swept round the grave. She said, in case the dead  person had been poisoned or killed by magic; and, indeed, so little do  they allow the possibility of death from natural causes, they even said  old Beemunny had been given poison in her honey by an old-time rejected  lover. Well, by sweeping round the grave they would see what track was  on the swept place next morning, and according to that they would know  to what totem the murderer belonged. If the track should be an  iguana's, then one of the Beewee, or iguana totem, was guilty; if an  emu, then one of the Dinewan, or emu totem, and so on.    Old Hippi joined me a little further on. He explained that the service  was not as it would have been some years ago. That I knew, because when  I first went to the station I had seen them going to funerals all  decorated as if for corroborees. Round their waists, wrists, knees and  ankles had been twigs of Dheal, the sacred tree, and the rest of their  bodies had been painted.    Hippi said a great deal more would have been spoken and sung at the  grave if the dead person had been a man. His spirit would have in a  short sort of prayer been commended to Byamee, who would have been  intreated to let the dead enter Bullimah (heaven), as he had kept the  Boorah laws--that is, of course, if he had been initiated: the spirits  of the uninitiated wander until they are reincarnated, and never enter  Bullimah. One curious coincidence occurred in connection with this  burial.    Seeing the droughty desolation of the country, as we walked to the  grave, I asked old Bootha when she thought it would rain again. Coming  very close to me she half whispered:    'In three days I think it; old woman dead tell me when she dying that  \"'sposin\" she can send 'em rain, she send 'im three days when her Yowee  bulleerul--spirit breath--go long Oobi Oobi.'    Beemunny died on Wednesday night. On Saturday when we went to bed the  skies were as cloudless as they had been for weeks. In the middle of  the night we were awakened by the patter of rain-drops on the iron  roof. All night it rained, and all the next day.    It is said that a dead person always sends rain within a week of his  death to wash out his tracks on earth.    One little black girl told me she always felt sad when she saw  thunderclouds, because she thought some dead person had sent them.    As a rule, there is a good deal more shedding of blood over a grave  than I saw. This blood offering is said to please the dead, being a  proof to them of the affection of the living. It is funeral etiquette  to prepare yourself with a weapon with which to shed this blood, but  likewise etiquette for a friend to intervene and stop your  self-mutilation.    On emerging from the grave the spirit finds the spirits of his dead  relations waiting to go with him to Oobi Oobi, that is, a sacred  mountain whose top towers into the sky, nearly touching Bullimah. The  new spirit recognises his relations at once; they had, many of them,  been round the death-bed visible at the last to the dying, though not  to any of the watchers with him, though these are said sometimes to  hear the spirit voices.    The spirit from the grave carried with him the twigs of the sacred  Dheal tree which were placed over and under his body; he follows his  spirit relations, dropping these twigs as he goes along, leaving thus a  trail that those who follow"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38233"],[0,"Birds Every Child Should Know (#20)"],[1,"waits,\" he  firmly believes.    None of the family is musically gifted, but all make a more or less  pleasing noise. Flycatchers are solitary, sedentary birds, never being  found in flocks; but when mated, they are devoted home lovers.    We are apt to think of tropical birds as very gaily feathered, but  certainly many that come from warmer climes to spend the summer with  us are less conspicuous than Quakers.      [Illustration]    The dashing, great crested flycatcher      [Illustration]    Baby kingbirds in an apple tree      {163}    KINGBIRD    _Called also: Bee Martin_      In spite of his scientific name, which has branded him the tyrant of  tyrants, the kingbird is by no means a bully. See him high in air in  hot pursuit of that big, black, villainous crow, who dared try to rob  his nest, darting about the rascal's head and pecking at his eyes  until he is glad to leave the neighbourhood! There seems to be an  eternal feud between them. Even the marauding hawk, that strikes  terror to every other feathered breast, will be driven off by the  plucky little kingbird. But surely a courageous home defender is no  tyrant. A kingbird doesn't like the scolding catbird for a neighbour,  or the teasing blue jay, or the meddlesome English sparrow, but he  simply gives them a wide berth. He is no Don Quixote ready to fight  from mere bravado. _Tyrannus tyrannus_ is a libel.    For years he has been called the bee martin and some scientific men in  Washington determined to learn if that name, also, is deserved. So  they collected over two hundred kingbirds from different parts of the  country, examined their stomachs and found bees--mostly drones--in  only fourteen. The bird is too keen sighted and clever to snap up  knowingly a bee with a {164} sting attached, you may be sure; but  occasionally he makes a mistake when, don't you believe, he is more  sorry for it than the beekeeper? He destroys so many robber flies--a  pest of the hives--that the intelligent apiarist, who keeps bees in  his orchard to fertilise the blossoms, always likes to see a pair of  kingbirds nesting in one of his fruit trees. The gardener welcomes the  bird that eats rose chafers; the farmer approves of him because he  catches the gadfly that torments his horses and cattle, as well as the  grasshoppers, katydids and crickets that would destroy his field crops  if left unchecked.    From a favourite lookout on a tall mullein stalk, a kingbird neighbour  of mine would detect an insect over one hundred and seventy feet away,  where no human eye could see it, dash off, snap it safely within his  bill, flutter uncertainly an instant, then return to his perch ready  to \"loop the loop\" again any moment. The curved clasp at the tip of  his bill and the stiff hairs at the base helped hold every insect his  prisoner. While waiting for food to fly into sight the watcher did a  good deal of calling. His harsh, chattering note, _ching, ching_,  which penetrated to a surprising distance, did not express alarm, but  rather the exultant joy of victory.      [Illustration]    Four crested flycatchers who need to have their hair brushed      [Illustration]    Time for these young phoebes to leave the nest      [Illustration]    Young phoebes on a bridge trestle      {165}    He and his mate were certainly frantic with fear, however, when I  climbed into their apple tree one June morning, determined to have a  peep at the five creamy-white eggs, speckled with brown and pale  lilac, that had just been laid in the nest in a crotch near the end of  a stout limb. Whirling and dashing about my head, the pair made me  lose my balance, and I tumbled ten feet or more to the ground. As the  intruder fell, they might well have exclaimed--perhaps they did--_\"Sic  semper tyrannis!\"_      CRESTED FLYCATCHER    Far more tyrannical than the kingbird is this \"wild Irishman,\" as John  Burroughs calls the large flycatcher with the tousled head and harsh,  uncanny voice, who prowls around the woods and orchards startling most  feathered friends and foes with a loud, piercing exclamation that  sounds like _What!_ Unlike good children, he is more often heard than  seen.    That the solitary, unpopular bird takes a mischievous delight in  scaring its enemies, you may know when I tell you that it likes better  than any other lining for its nest, a cast snake skin. Is it any  wonder that the baby flycatchers' hair stands on end? If the  great-crest cannot find the skin of a snake to coil {166} around her  eggs, or to hang out of the nest, she may use onion skins, or oiled  paper, or even fish scales; for what was once a protective custom,  sometimes becomes degraded into a cheap imitation of the imitation in  the furnishing of her house. Into an abandoned woodpeckers' hole or a  bluebirds' cavity after the babies of these early nesters have flown,  or into some unappropriated hollow in a tree, this flycatcher carries  enough grasses, weeds and feathers to keep her nestlings cozy during  those rare days of June beloved by Lowell, but which Dr. Holmes  observed are often so rare they are raw.      PHOEBE    _Called also: Bridge Pewee; Dusky Flycatcher;  Water Pewee_      The first of its family to come North, as well as the last to leave us  for the winter, the phoebe appears toward the end of March to snap up  the first insects warmed into life by the spring sunshine. Grackles in  the evergreens, red-wings in the swampy meadows, bluebirds in the  orchard may assure us that summer is on the way; but the homely,  confiding phoebe, who comes close about our houses and barns, brings  the good news home to us every hour.    {167}    _Pewit--phoebe, pewit--phoebe_, he calls continually. As he perches on  the peak of a building or other point of vantage, notice how  vigorously he wags his tail when he calls, and turns his head this way  and that, to keep an eye in all directions lest a bite should fly by  him unawares.    Presently a mate comes from somewhere south of the Carolinas where she  has passed the winter; for phoebes are more hardy than the rest of the  family and do not travel all the way to the tropics. With unfailing  accuracy she finds the region where she built her nest the previous  season or where she herself was hatched. This instinct of returned  direction is marvellous, is it not? Sometimes it is hard enough for us  humans to find the way home when not ten miles away. Did you ever get  lost? Birds almost never do.    Phoebes like a covering over their heads to protect their nests from  spring rains, so you will see a domesticated couple going about the  place like a pair of wrens, investigating niches under the piazza  roof, beams in an empty barn loft and projections under bridges and  trestles. By the middle of April a neat nest of moss and lichen,  plastered together with mud and lined with long hair or wool, if sheep  are near, is made in the vicinity of their home of the year before.  {168} The nursery is exquisitely fashioned--one of the best pieces of  bird architecture you are likely to find.    Some over-thrifty housekeepers, nevertheless, tear down nests from  their piazzas, because the poor little phoebes are so afflicted with  lice that they are considered objectionable neighbours. Many wild  birds, like chickens, have their life-blood drawn by these minute  pests. But a thorough dusting of the phoebe's nest with Persian powder  would bring relief to the tormented birds, save their babies, perhaps,  from death and keep the piazza free from vermin. No birds enjoy a bath  in your fountain or water pan more than these tormented ones.    From purely selfish motives it pays to cultivate neighbours ever on  the lookout for flies, wasps, May beetles, click beetles, elm  destroyers and the moth of the cutworm. The first nest is usually so  infested that the phoebes either tear it down in July, and build a new  one on its site, or else make the second nest at a little distance  from the first. The parents of two broods of from four to six  ravenously hungry, insectivorous young, with an instinctive desire to  return to their old home year after year, should surely meet no  discouragement from thinking farmers' wives.    Shouldn't you think that baby phoebes, reared in nests under railroad  bridges, would {169} be fearfully frightened whenever a train  thundered overhead?      WOOD PEWEE    When you have been wandering through the summer woods did you ever,  like Trowbridge, sit down      \"Beside the brook, irresolute,    And watch a little bird in suit    Of sombre olive, soft and brown,    Perched in the maple branches, mute?    With greenish gold its vest was fringed,    Its tiny cap was ebon-tinged,    With ivory pale its wings were barred,    And its dark eyes were tender starred.    'Dear bird,' I said, 'what is thy name?'    And thrice the mournful answer came.    So faint and far, and yet so near--    'Pewee! pe-wee! peer!'\"    Doubtless this demure, gentle little cousin of the noisy, aggressive,  crested flycatcher has no secret sorrow preying at its heart, but the  tender pathos of its long-drawn notes would seem to indicate that it  is rather melancholy. And it sings (in spite of the books which teach  us that the flycatchers are \"songless, perching birds\") from the time  of its arrival from Central America in May until only the tireless  indigo bunting and the red-eyed vireo are left in the choir in August.    But how suddenly its melancholy languor {170} departs the instant an  insect flies within sight! With a cheerful, sudden sally in mid-air,  it snaps up the luscious bite, for it can be quite as active as any of  the family. While not so ready to be neighbourly as the phoebe, the  pewee condescends to visit our orchards and shade trees.    When nesting time comes, it looks for a partly decayed, lichen-covered  branch, and on to this saddles a compact, exquisite cradle of fine  grass, moss and shreds of bark, binding bits of lichen with spiders'"]]]
