[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6167"],[0,"Business Hints for Men and Women (#20)"],[1,"   The enforcement of this rule will depend altogether on the  character of the person with whom you are dealing.    Never, if you can help it, buy a past due note, especially if it  is not secured by a mortgage.    If a note, which a third party has endorsed, becomes due, never  agree to an extension of time without getting the written consent  of the endorser.    Many men have lost through their ignorance of this essential  transaction.          CHAPTER XXVI    LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP        We are not quite through with the note.    When making a payment of principal or interest on a note, be sure  to take a receipt for the amount, stating specifically what the  payment is to be credited to. In addition, if it be possible, see  that the sum paid be endorsed on the back of the note itself.    The endorsement of the sum paid on the back of the note bars its  being negotiated for more than the amount actually due.    Sometimes the owner and the maker of a note live at points some  distance apart. If you were the maker of the note, and wanted to  make a payment, but wished to avoid the expense and annoyance of a  trip, what should be done?    In this case a good plan would be to write to the owner of the  note, asking him to send it by a certain bank in your neighborhood  where you can pay. The bank will receive the cash, make the  endorsement in your presence, and then send its check for the  amount with the note to the owner.    You must pay the cost of this transaction.    Or you may send the amount to be credited on your note, through a  bank draft, as already indicated.    Never destroy a cancelled note.    NOTES IN BANK    If you have money at a bank your note will form the chief evidence  of indebtedness and be the paper for which the security is  pledged.    Keep careful track of the date of payment and the amount. There  must be no neglect or carelessness.    Never permit your note to go to protest.    If for any reason payment cannot be made at the time fixed, then  the better way is to go, as soon as this is learned, to the bank  or other holder of the note, and frankly explain the situation.    Bankers are not shylocks. They realize that good and responsible  men are often disappointed in their collections, or in the payment  of a sum on which they depended for the settlement of their  account with the bank, and in such a case they are usually willing  to grant an extension.    Private individuals, as note holders, should be treated in just  the same way.    WELL TO KNOW    When calling at a bank for your note, always give the exact date  on which the note falls due.    If the note belongs to another party, and is held by the bank for  collection, then mention the name of the person to whom it was  originally given.    If the bank has sent you a written notice about the note, take the  notice with you. It will be found to contain all the desired  facts.    Banks keep their own notes in one place and those of their  customers in another.    Banks keep each date by itself, and can so find required notes  more readily if the owner's names and the dates are given.    DISCHARGING LIENS    Remember a mortgage is a lien or security given for the payment of  a note.    If you get a mortgage, have it recorded at once.    If you pay off a mortgage, take it at once to the office of record  and have the discharge of the instrument properly entered on the  folio in which the mortgage is recorded.    Many lawsuits have resulted from the temporary neglect of this  important duty.    BE PROMPT, BUT NOT TOO PROMPT    Sometimes a man will give a number of notes and secure them by one  mortgage.    The notes may pass into the hands of a number of people.    Let us suppose that you hold one note and the mortgage, and that  the mortgagee comes to you and tenders the amount of your note,  should you then surrender the mortgage to him?    By no means, until the last note is paid that mortgage remains as  security, and the holder of it is responsible for its safety to  the holders of the other notes.    In such a case it is better to have the mortgage held by one party  for the protection of all.    BE IN NO HASTE TO INVEST    When a person not accustomed to managing money comes into the  possession of a sum that it is not safe to carry about in the  pocket, what should he do with it?    Obviously the first answer to this question must be \"He should put  it in the bank.\"    We have already given hints as to investments, and to these it is  not necessary to refer again, we are now considering another and  not an unusual phase of such a case.    Young men and women of all ages are very apt to be inexperienced  in these matters. As soon as it becomes known that such people  have come into the possession of a goodly amount of cash, which  they are not considered competent to manage, it is surprising how  past acquaintances suddenly pose as old and unselfish friends,  each with a scheme for doubling the money while the owner is  looking at it.    Now, there may be good, honest friends who are eager to advise and  help in a case of this kind, but they are sure to be outnumbered  by advisers who have their own little axes to grind.    Our advice is \"Don't be in a hurry to invest. Your cash is quite  safe while in bank.\"    But no matter how promising, do not invest your money in a  business you know nothing about, even if it does carry with it a  position and a salary.    Find a good honest lawyer, despite sneers to the contrary, we  believe most men in the profession are of this character, and ask  his advice, and pay for his help if papers are to be drawn.    Buying rentable real estate is usually a good investment, provided  always that the price is reasonable, the title clear, and the  chances of its advancement pretty certain.    MEET YOUR DUES PROMPTLY    It is estimated that every man and woman in the United States  belongs to one or more societies of some character, and this is  not an overstatement.    Every member of such an organization is such by reason of election  and the payment of dues.    If you are a member of, or a pledged contributor to, a church,  lodge, grange, or other society, you should regard the prompt  payment of your dues as sacred as any other form of obligation.    The expenses of a properly conducted church are always  considerable, even in small communities. It is a disgrace to the  Christian organization that, after forcing down the pastor's  compensation to the barest cost of life's necessities, then force  him to run into debt if he and his family would live, or to be  forced continually to remind the trustees that his salary is far  in arrears.    If you belong to a lodge or other society, leave it if you  honestly feel that you cannot afford the dues. Neglect to do this  and your name will be dropped from the rolls on which it never  should have been placed.    COUNTING MONEY    Never receive money from any one without counting it. Count it at  once and in the presence of the giver.    Let it make no difference, banker, merchant, kinsman or friend, do  not fear to give offence, but right then and there, count the  money he gave you.    Of course, these people are honest, but did it ever occur to you  that honest people often make mistakes?    Whenever you pay another money, if he does not do so himself, you  should insist that he count it in your presence.    If you do this you won't lose a friend, but if you do not do it  you may make an enemy, should the man come back to say you made a  mistake and underpaid him, and you very properly refuse to honor  his claim.    READY MONEY    Do not, if you can possibly avoid it, keep money around your  house, in your place of business, or on your person.    The professional thief is ever on the watch for chances to take  unto himself all the money in sight.    Pickpockets reap their harvest from money carriers.    The burglar may steal or fire may destroy money left in the house.    A bank, if not near one then a safe, is the best place for money,  though safes have been broken into and robbed.    Do not make a display of money at any time, but particularly in a  public place.    If you are drawing money from a bank, count it quickly and  quietly, then secure it in an inside pocket that cannot be reached  without unbuttoning.    Never cash a check for a man whom you do not know to be square.    The same applies to the endorsement of checks.    IN TRAVELLING    Always be courteous in travelling, but never take the chance  acquaintance of the steamboat or car into your confidence.    Keep an eye on the man who \"fortunately is going just your way.\"    Watch out for the fellow who knows the leading men of your town  and is a cousin of Judge Smith.    Do not respond if such men ask you to cash a small check or make a  slight advance till his draft arrives.    Do not accept the invitation of strangers to visit any place.    Avoid the confidence of the over-dressed, but slightly intoxicated  young fellow who \"has been out with college chums.\" He is not a  college man, nor has he been drinking.

After partaking of my evening meal of cheese-like food and vegetable  milk I sought out Sola, whom I found working by the light of a torch  upon some of Tars Tarkas' trappings.  She looked up at my approach, her  face lighting with pleasure and with welcome.    \"I am glad you came,\" she said; \"Dejah Thoris sleeps and I am lonely.  Mine own people do not care for me, John Carter; I am too unlike them.  It is a sad fate, since I must live my life amongst them, and I often  wish that I were a true green Martian woman, without love and without  hope; but I have known love and so I am lost.    \"I promised to tell you my story, or rather the story of my parents.  From what I have learned of you and the ways of your people I am sure  that the tale will not seem strange to you, but among green Martians it  has no parallel within the memory of the oldest living Thark, nor do  our legends hold many similar tales.    \"My mother was rather small, in fact too small to be allowed the  responsibilities of maternity, as our chieftains breed principally for  size.  She was also less cold and cruel than most green Martian women,  and caring little for their society, she often roamed the deserted  avenues of Thark alone, or went and sat among the wild flowers that  deck the nearby hills, thinking thoughts and wishing wishes which I  believe I alone among Tharkian women today may understand, for am I not  the child of my mother?    \"And there among the hills she met a young warrior, whose duty it was  to guard the feeding zitidars and thoats and see that they roamed not  beyond the hills.  They spoke at first only of such things as interest  a community of Tharks, but gradually, as they came to meet more often,  and, as was now quite evident to both, no longer by chance, they talked  about themselves, their likes, their ambitions and their hopes.  She  trusted him and told him of the awful repugnance she felt for the  cruelties of their kind, for the hideous, loveless lives they must ever  lead, and then she waited for the storm of denunciation to break from  his cold, hard lips; but instead he took her in his arms and kissed her.    \"They kept their love a secret for six long years.  She, my mother, was  of the retinue of the great Tal Hajus, while her lover was a simple  warrior, wearing only his own metal.  Had their defection from the  traditions of the Tharks been discovered both would have paid the  penalty in the great arena before Tal Hajus and the assembled hordes.    \"The egg from which I came was hidden beneath a great glass vessel upon  the highest and most inaccessible of the partially ruined towers of  ancient Thark.  Once each year my mother visited it for the five long  years it lay there in the process of incubation.  She dared not come  oftener, for in the mighty guilt of her conscience she feared that her  every move was watched.  During this period my father gained great  distinction as a warrior and had taken the metal from several  chieftains.  His love for my mother had never diminished, and his own  ambition in life was to reach a point where he might wrest the metal  from Tal Hajus himself, and thus, as ruler of the Tharks, be free to  claim her as his own, as well as, by the might of his power, protect  the child which otherwise would be quickly dispatched should the truth  become known.    \"It was a wild dream, that of wresting the metal from Tal Hajus in five  short years, but his advance was rapid, and he soon stood high in the  councils of Thark.  But one day the chance was lost forever, in so far  as it could come in time to save his loved ones, for he was ordered  away upon a long expedition to the ice-clad south, to make war upon the  natives there and despoil them of their furs, for such is the manner of  the green Barsoomian; he does not labor for what he can wrest in battle  from others.    \"He was gone for four years, and when he returned all had been over for  three; for about a year after his departure, and shortly before the  time for the return of an expedition which had gone forth to fetch the  fruits of a community incubator, the egg had hatched.  Thereafter my  mother continued to keep me in the old tower, visiting me nightly and  lavishing upon me the love the community life would have robbed us both  of.  She hoped, upon the return of the expedition from the incubator,  to mix me with the other young assigned to the quarters of Tal Hajus,  and thus escape the fate which would surely follow discovery of her sin  against the ancient traditions of the green men.    \"She taught me rapidly the language and customs of my kind, and one  night she told me the story I have told to you up to this point,  impressing upon me the necessity for absolute secrecy and the great  caution I must exercise after she had placed me with the other young  Tharks to permit no one to guess that I was further advanced in  education than they, nor by any sign to divulge in the presence of  others my affection for her, or my knowledge of my parentage; and then  drawing me close to her she whispered in my ear the name of my father.    \"And then a light flashed out upon the darkness of the tower chamber,  and there stood Sarkoja, her gleaming, baleful eyes fixed in a frenzy  of loathing and contempt upon my mother.  The torrent of hatred and  abuse she poured out upon her turned my young heart cold in terror.  That she had heard the entire story was apparent, and that she had  suspected something wrong from my mother's long nightly absences from  her quarters accounted for her presence there on that fateful night.    \"One thing she had not heard, nor did she know, the whispered name of  my father.  This was apparent from her repeated demands upon my mother  to disclose the name of her partner in sin, but no amount of abuse or  threats could wring this from her, and to save me from needless torture  she lied, for she told Sarkoja that she alone knew nor would she ever  tell her child.    \"With final imprecations, Sarkoja hastened away to Tal Hajus to report  her discovery, and while she was gone my mother, wrapping me in the  silks and furs of her night coverings, so that I was scarcely  noticeable, descended to the streets and ran wildly away toward the  outskirts of the city, in the direction which led to the far south, out  toward the man whose protection she might not claim, but on whose face  she wished to look once more before she died.    \"As we neared the city's southern extremity a sound came to us from  across the mossy flat, from the direction of the only pass through the  hills which led to the gates, the pass by which caravans from either  north or south or east or west would enter the city.  The sounds we  heard were the squealing of thoats and the grumbling of zitidars, with  the occasional clank of arms which announced the approach of a body of  warriors.  The thought uppermost in her mind was that it was my father  returned from his expedition, but the cunning of the Thark held her  from headlong and precipitate flight to greet him.    \"Retreating into the shadows of a doorway she awaited the coming of the  cavalcade which shortly entered the avenue, breaking its formation and  thronging the thoroughfare from wall to wall.  As the head of the  procession passed us the lesser moon swung clear of the overhanging  roofs and lit up the scene with all the brilliancy of her wondrous  light.  My mother shrank further back into the friendly shadows, and  from her hiding place saw that the expedition was not that of my  father, but the returning caravan bearing the young Tharks.  Instantly  her plan was formed, and as a great chariot swung close to our hiding  place she slipped stealthily in upon the trailing tailboard, crouching  low in the shadow of the high side, straining me to her bosom in a  frenzy of love.    \"She knew, what I did not, that never again after that night would she  hold me to her breast, nor was it likely we would ever look upon each  other's face again.  In the confusion of the plaza she mixed me with  the other children, whose guardians during the journey were now free to  relinquish their responsibility.  We were herded together into a great  room, fed by women who had not accompanied the expedition, and the next  day we were parceled out among the retinues of the chieftains.    \"I never saw my mother after that night.  She was imprisoned by Tal  Hajus, and every effort, including the most horrible and shameful  torture, was brought to bear upon her to wring from her lips the name  of my father; but she remained steadfast and loyal, dying at last  amidst the laughter of Tal Hajus and his chieftains during some awful  torture she was undergoing.    \"I learned afterwards that she told them that she had killed me to save  me from a like fate at their hands, and that she had thrown my body to  the white apes.  Sarkoja alone disbelieved her, and I feel to this day  that she suspects my true origin, but does not dare expose me, at the  present, at all events, because she also guesses, I am sure, the  identity of my father.    \"When he returned from his expedition and learned the story of my  mother's fate I was present as Tal Hajus told him; but never by the  quiver of a muscle did he betray the slightest emotion; only he did not  laugh as Tal Hajus gleefully described her death struggles.  From that  moment on he was the cruelest of the cruel, and I am awaiting the day  when he shall win the goal of his ambition, and feel the carcass of Tal  Hajus beneath his foot, for I am as sure that he but waits the  opportunity to wreak a terrible vengeance, and that his great love is  as strong in his breast as when it first transfigured him nearly forty  years ago, as I am that we sit here upon the edge of a world-old ocean  while sensible people sleep, John Carter.\"    \"And"]]]
