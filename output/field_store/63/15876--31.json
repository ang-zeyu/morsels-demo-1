Among other things, you will  observe that the elders are to make themselves acquainted with \"things  which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to  pass; with things which are at home, and things which are abroad.\" I  see in that a commandment to keep informed as to current events; and,  in my opinion, this commandment can be made to apply not only to the  elders in Ohio, to whom it was directly given, but to all those who may  be called upon to perform a similar labor, that of representing the  work of God to the inhabitants of the earth. That responsibility rests  upon the young men who hold the priesthood in the Church today, and  hence, this commandment applies to them. It applies to the members of  the Mutual Improvement Associations; for one of the chief objects in  view, when the organization of Improvement Associations was effected,  was the preparation of our young men to become exponents of the gospel  of Jesus Christ, especially as revealed in the dispensation of that  gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith. No knowledge can be of more  importance to the young man who expects to engage in this work than  the knowledge of current events, and prevailing ideas in the world on  religion; especially those current events which have a more or less  direct relation to the great work of the last days--to Mormonism, in  other words.    Of late, there have been a number of important things taking place that  have a direct relation to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints, among which is the passing of resolutions antagonistic to  Mormonism, by the Presbyterian General Assembly, convened during the  past week in Los Angeles, California. The ministers of the Presbyterian  Church met in solemn conclave to consider the interests of their  own church, and, incidentally, I suppose, to look a little after  the welfare of ours. One proposition before those assembled divines  was very extraordinary. So extraordinary, in fact, that it may be  considered astonishing. It was nothing more nor less than a plan to  \"crush Mormonism.\" I think we are interested in a proposition of that  kind. Intensely interested; and hence my text of one word, \"How?\" That  is, how is the \"Crushing of Mormonism\" to be effected? What means are  to be invoked? What process followed? Fortunately for us, who naturally  have so much anxiety respecting the matter, one of the speakers before  the Presbyterian assembly brought forward a plan through which the  \"crushing\" is to be accomplished. This was Doctor-that is, Doctor  of Divinity, you will understand--Charles L. Thompson, of New York.  We are informed by the dispatches which reported in part \"his great  discourse,\" that he was the speaker who aroused the most enthusiasm in  the assembly, and that his references to Mormonism were \"especially  bitter,\" and brought out great applause from his audience. He is  reported to have said that \"Mormonism is not to be educated, not to be  civilized, not to be reformed. It must be crushed.\" This the climax of  what is called his \"great discourse;\" surely it must have been a great  discourse to have such a climax as that, and to receive such applause  from such a body of divines!    But how do you suppose the crushing is to be accomplished? Now listen!  The Revelation Mr. Thompson compares the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints to a great octopus. The octopus, as you know, is an  animal very difficult to kill; but the gentleman remembered that Victor  Hugo, in his \"Toilers of the Sea,\" had said that even the octopus had  a vulnerable point. \"There is one moment in which to seize it--it  is when it thrusts forth its head. Then is the time to strike.\" The  reverend gentleman then concludes that the Mormon octopus has thrust  forth its head. \"Its high priest,\" said he, \"claims a senator's chair  in Washington. Now is the time to strike. Perhaps to miss it now, is to  be lost.\"    Wonderful wisdom! worthy of a great divine! a mighty climax to a great  sermon! Seriously, however, a most perfect example of an anti-climax;  \"a most lame and impotent conclusion,\" more ridiculous than the  fable of the mountain laboring, to bring forth a mouse! If my voice  could reach the reverend gentleman, I would inform him that there  is not even the charm of novelty in what he recommended. We have  heard something like this before. Why, within my own recollection,  I can remember something like that having been proposed as a means  of crushing Mormonism. Way down deep in the innermost recesses of my  sub-consciousness, I have a recollection of suggestions made in like  spirit, about the year 1898. This Doctor of Divinity's thundering  fulmination against Mormonism, when I hear him pronounce it, has  something familiar about it. In fact it has all the monotony of the  refrain of some old familiar song. Much was said about an octopus,  too, and about it thrusting forth its head, at the time to which I  refer, 1898. Then its \"High Priest,\" it was said, claimed a seat in  the lower house of Congress, when a certain gentleman by the name of  Roberts was elected to Congress from the State of Utah. They said,  then, that the octopus was putting forth its head; then was the time  to strike; to fail then would be to be lost; so they induced the House  of Representatives to strike, by excluding the gentleman from the seat  to which he had been legally elected, and for which he possessed, as  was admitted, every constitutional qualification. But I have never  heard that the achievement, which was accomplished at the cost of an  outrageous violation of the constitution of our country, affected the  Mormon Church. What effect did that illegal act of Congress have on  Mormonism? About as much effect as a mosquito alighting on the moon  would have on that sphere. The \"Mormon\" octopus survived that awful  blow! And even the gentleman who was denied his seat, I am informed,  survived also; and I have not heard that his shadow has grown less  because of that experience. And should the agitation against Senator  Reed Smoot result in his expulsion from the Senate of the United  States--a thing which is as unlikely as it is unjust--I verily believe  that Mormonism would survive even that blow. The trouble with our  reverend friends is, that they persist in mistaking always the head of  the octopus, and hence never strike it.    It is not my purpose to discuss the issues raised between the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and this Los Angeles Presbyterian  Assembly, in a spirit of retaliation. I do not intend to answer railing  with railing, nor do I wish to revile those by whom we are reviled. I  understand the law of the gospel of Christ to be that we should not  be overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. Besides, patience  is one of Mormonism's chief virtues. But all this does not mean that  we shall not have an appreciation of our own rights and liberties  under the constitution and institutions of our country; nor does it  prevent us from pointing out the unjust conduct of our assailants; nor  debar us from making protest, in proper spirit, against their proposed  invasions of our rights; nor blind us to the absurdity of their plans  for our destruction. But we will not abuse our traducers, nor revile  them because they revile us. Thank God, the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints occupies a position so exalted that it may smile at  the efforts of men who propose to \"crush\" it. Especially by such means  as those proposed by the Reverend Doctor Thompson. The resolutions of  the Presbyterian Assembly, at Los Angeles, its fulminations against  the Church of Christ, are all shafts that fall broken and harmless at  the feet of the people of God. There is one passage of Byron's \"Childe  Harold\" with which I have always been deeply impressed, as setting  forth the dignity and exaltation of God in his relation to those who  doubt the reality of his revelations, seek to prove them myths, and  blaspheme his name. It is where the poet refers to the character and  works of Voltaire and Gibbon. Concluding his reflections upon these two  really great men, he says:      They were gigantic minds, and their steep aim    Was, Titan-like, on daring doubts to pile    Thoughts which should call down thunder, and the flame    Of heaven, again assailed, if heaven the while    On man and man's research could deign do more than smile.    In like exalted station stands the Church of Christ today. The Bride,  the Lamb's Wife, has no fear of her enemies. She stands too near the  Bridegroom, too near his glorious coming, too near the holy, visible  union with him, which is to be eternal, to fear the vain ravings of  modern priests of Baal.    Let us examine more thoroughly, however, the proposition of this  Reverend Doctor Thompson, and find out, if we can, how the Christian  gentleman really proposes to proceed with his crushing process. Be  it remembered he lays down the doctrine that \"Mormonism is not to be  educated, not to be civilized, not to be reformed!\" Then how will  he proceed? He decides to eliminate educational methods, civilizing  methods, and reform methods. After eliminating these, what method has  he left for crushing Mormonism? None but force--brute force; and force  in the last analysis means either mobs or armies. Can it be that a body  of \"divines,\" \"ministers of Jesus Christ,\" living in the twentieth  century of the Christian era, are ready to recommend the throwing aside  of all legitimate methods of dealing with a body of people supposed to  be in error on matters of religion, and leave it to be justly inferred  that they favor the employment of force to accomplish that which only  love and goodwill toward men should undertake? Have we been correctly  informed by the dispatches which say that the man who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/479"],[0,"Little Lord Fauntleroy (#20)"],[1,"able. And then  Fauntleroy came; and when the Earl saw him, fortunately for the little  fellow, the secret pride of the grandfather was gratified at the outset.  If Cedric had been a less handsome little fellow, the old man might have  taken so strong a dislike to him that he would not have given himself  the chance to see his grandson's finer qualities. But he chose to  think that Cedric's beauty and fearless spirit were the results of the  Dorincourt blood and a credit to the Dorincourt rank. And then when  he heard the lad talk, and saw what a well-bred little fellow he was,  notwithstanding his boyish ignorance of all that his new position meant,  the old Earl liked his grandson more, and actually began to find himself  rather entertained. It had amused him to give into those childish hands  the power to bestow a benefit on poor Higgins. My lord cared nothing  for poor Higgins, but it pleased him a little to think that his grandson  would be talked about by the country people and would begin to be  popular with the tenantry, even in his childhood. Then it had gratified  him to drive to church with Cedric and to see the excitement and  interest caused by the arrival. He knew how the people would speak of  the beauty of the little lad; of his fine, strong, straight body; of  his erect bearing, his handsome face, and his bright hair, and how they  would say (as the Earl had heard one woman exclaim to another) that the  boy was \"every inch a lord.\" My lord of Dorincourt was an arrogant old  man, proud of his name, proud of his rank, and therefore proud to show  the world that at last the House of Dorincourt had an heir who was  worthy of the position he was to fill.    The morning the new pony had been tried, the Earl had been so pleased  that he had almost forgotten his gout. When the groom had brought out  the pretty creature, which arched its brown, glossy neck and tossed its  fine head in the sun, the Earl had sat at the open window of the library  and had looked on while Fauntleroy took his first riding lesson. He  wondered if the boy would show signs of timidity. It was not a very  small pony, and he had often seen children lose courage in making their  first essay at riding.    Fauntleroy mounted in great delight. He had never been on a pony before,  and he was in the highest spirits. Wilkins, the groom, led the animal by  the bridle up and down before the library window.    \"He's a well plucked un, he is,\" Wilkins remarked in the stable  afterward with many grins. \"It weren't no trouble to put HIM up. An' a  old un wouldn't ha' sat any straighter when he WERE up. He ses--ses  he to me, 'Wilkins,' he ses, 'am I sitting up straight? They sit up  straight at the circus,' ses he. An' I ses, 'As straight as a arrer,  your lordship!'--an' he laughs, as pleased as could be, an' he ses,  'That's right,' he ses, 'you tell me if I don't sit up straight,  Wilkins!'\"    But sitting up straight and being led at a walk were not altogether and  completely satisfactory. After a few minutes, Fauntleroy spoke to his  grandfather--watching him from the window:    \"Can't I go by myself?\" he asked; \"and can't I go faster? The boy on  Fifth Avenue used to trot and canter!\"    \"Do you think you could trot and canter?\" said the Earl.    \"I should like to try,\" answered Fauntleroy.    His lordship made a sign to Wilkins, who at the signal brought up his  own horse and mounted it and took Fauntleroy's pony by the leading-rein.    \"Now,\" said the Earl, \"let him trot.\"    The next few minutes were rather exciting to the small equestrian. He  found that trotting was not so easy as walking, and the faster the pony  trotted, the less easy it was.    \"It j-jolts a g-goo-good deal--do-doesn't it?\" he said to Wilkins.  \"D-does it j-jolt y-you?\"    \"No, my lord,\" answered Wilkins. \"You'll get used to it in time. Rise in  your stirrups.\"    \"I'm ri-rising all the t-time,\" said Fauntleroy.    He was both rising and falling rather uncomfortably and with many shakes  and bounces. He was out of breath and his face grew red, but he held on  with all his might, and sat as straight as he could. The Earl could  see that from his window. When the riders came back within speaking  distance, after they had been hidden by the trees a few minutes,  Fauntleroy's hat was off, his cheeks were like poppies, and his lips  were set, but he was still trotting manfully.    \"Stop a minute!\" said his grandfather. \"Where's your hat?\"    Wilkins touched his. \"It fell off, your lordship,\" he said, with evident  enjoyment. \"Wouldn't let me stop to pick it up, my lord.\"    \"Not much afraid, is he?\" asked the Earl dryly.    \"Him, your lordship!\" exclaimed Wilkins. \"I shouldn't say as he knowed  what it meant. I've taught young gen'lemen to ride afore, an' I never  see one stick on more determinder.\"    \"Tired?\" said the Earl to Fauntleroy. \"Want to get off?\"    \"It jolts you more than you think it will,\" admitted his young lordship  frankly. \"And it tires you a little, too; but I don't want to get off.  I want to learn how. As soon as I've got my breath I want to go back for  the hat.\"    The cleverest person in the world, if he had undertaken to teach  Fauntleroy how to please the old man who watched him, could not have  taught him anything which would have succeeded better. As the pony  trotted off again toward the avenue, a faint color crept up in the  fierce old face, and the eyes, under the shaggy brows, gleamed with a  pleasure such as his lordship had scarcely expected to know again. And  he sat and watched quite eagerly until the sound of the horses' hoofs  returned. When they did come, which was after some time, they came at a  faster pace. Fauntleroy's hat was still off; Wilkins was carrying it for  him; his cheeks were redder than before, and his hair was flying about  his ears, but he came at quite a brisk canter.    \"There!\" he panted, as they drew up, \"I c-cantered. I didn't do it as  well as the boy on Fifth Avenue, but I did it, and I staid on!\"    He and Wilkins and the pony were close friends after that. Scarcely a  day passed in which the country people did not see them out together,  cantering gayly on the highroad or through the green lanes. The children  in the cottages would run to the door to look at the proud little brown  pony with the gallant little figure sitting so straight in the saddle,  and the young lord would snatch off his cap and swing it at them, and  shout, \"Hullo! Good-morning!\" in a very unlordly manner, though with  great heartiness. Sometimes he would stop and talk with the children,  and once Wilkins came back to the castle with a story of how Fauntleroy  had insisted on dismounting near the village school, so that a boy who  was lame and tired might ride home on his pony.    \"An' I'm blessed,\" said Wilkins, in telling the story at the  stables,--\"I'm blessed if he'd hear of anything else! He wouldn't let  me get down, because he said the boy mightn't feel comfortable on a big  horse. An' ses he, 'Wilkins,' ses he, 'that boy's lame and I'm not,  and I want to talk to him, too.' And up the lad has to get, and my lord  trudges alongside of him with his hands in his pockets, and his cap on  the back of his head, a-whistling and talking as easy as you please!  And when we come to the cottage, an' the boy's mother come out all in a  taking to see what's up, he whips off his cap an' ses he, 'I've brought  your son home, ma'am,' ses he, 'because his leg hurt him, and I don't  think that stick is enough for him to lean on; and I'm going to ask my  grandfather to have a pair of crutches made for him.' An' I'm blessed if  the woman wasn't struck all of a heap, as well she might be! I thought I  should 'a' hex-plodid, myself!\"    When the Earl heard the story he was not angry, as Wilkins had been  half afraid that he would be; on the contrary, he laughed outright, and  called Fauntleroy up to him, and made him tell all about the matter from  beginning to end, and then he laughed again. And actually, a few days  later, the Dorincourt carriage stopped in the green lane before the  cottage where the lame boy lived, and Fauntleroy jumped out and  walked up to the door, carrying a pair of strong, light, new crutches  shouldered like a gun, and presented them to Mrs. Hartle (the lame boy's  name was Hartle) with these words: \"My grandfather's compliments, and if  you please, these are for your boy, and we hope he will get better.\"    \"I said your compliments,\" he explained to the Earl when he returned to  the carriage. \"You didn't tell me to, but I thought perhaps you forgot.  That was right, wasn't it?\"    And the Earl laughed again, and did not say it was not. In fact, the two  were becoming more intimate every day, and every day Fauntleroy's faith  in his lordship's benevolence and virtue increased. He had no doubt  whatever that his grandfather was the most amiable and generous of  elderly gentlemen. Certainly, he himself found his wishes gratified  almost before they were uttered; and such gifts and pleasures were  lavished upon him, that he was sometimes almost bewildered by his own  possessions. Apparently, he was to have everything he wanted, and to  do everything he wished to do. And though this would certainly not have  been a very wise plan to pursue with all small boys, his young lordship  bore it amazingly well. Perhaps, notwithstanding his sweet nature, he  might have been somewhat spoiled by it, if it had not been for the  hours he spent with his mother at Court Lodge. That \"best friend\" of his  watched over him ever closely and tenderly. The two had many long talks  together, and he never went back to the Castle with her kisses on his  cheeks without carrying in his heart some simple, pure words worth  remembering.    There was one thing, it is true, which puzzled the little fellow very  much. He thought over the mystery of it much oftener than any one  supposed; even his mother did not know how often he pondered on it;"]]]
