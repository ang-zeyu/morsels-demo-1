No sense of loss or sadness oppresses the soul of the ardent sportsman  as he ranges the unroofed aisles alert for the wary grouse, the skulking  woodcock, full-grown and strong of wing and keen-eyed for every enemy,  or the hare flashing his half-donned winter coat among the gray  underbrush as he bounds away before the merry chiding of the beagles.  The brown monotony of the marshes is pleasant to him as green fields,  while the wild duck tarries in the dark pools and the snipe probes the  unfrozen patches of ooze. To him all seasons are kind, all days  pleasant, wherein he may pursue his sport, though the rain pelt him,  chill winds assail him, or the summer sun shower upon him its most  fervent rays, and in these changeful days of November he finds his full  measure of content.          XLI    THE MUSKRAT      A little turning of nature from her own courses banishes the beaver from  his primal haunts, but his less renowned and lesser cousin, the muskrat,  philosophically accommodates himself to the changed conditions of their  common foster mother and still clings fondly to her altered breast.    The ancient forests may be swept away and their successors disappear,  till there is scarcely left him a watersoaked log to use as an  intermediate port in his coastwise voyages; continual shadow may give  place to diurnal sunshine, woodland to meadow and pasture, the plough  tear the roof of his underground home, and cattle graze where once only  the cloven hoofs of the deer and the moose trod the virgin mould, yet he  holds his old place.    In the springtides of present years as in those of centuries past his  whining call echoes along the changed shores, his wake seams with  silver the dark garment of the water, and his comically grim visage  confronts you now as it did the Waubanakee bowmen in the old days when  the otter and the beaver were his familiars.    Unlike the beaver's slowly maturing crops, his food supply is constantly  provided in the annual growth of the marshes. Here in banks contiguous  to endless store of succulent sedge and lily roots and shell-cased  tidbits of mussels, he tunnels his stable water-portaled home, and out  there, by the channel's edge, builds his sedge-thatched hut before the  earliest frost falls upon the marshes. In its height, some find prophecy  of high or low water, and in the thickness of its walls the forecast of  a mild or severe winter, but the prophet himself is sometimes flooded  out of his house, sometimes starved and frozen in it.    In the still, sunny days between the nights of its unseen building, the  blue spikes of the pickerel-weed and the white trinities of the  arrow-head yet bloom beside it. Then in the golden and scarlet  brightness of autumn the departing wood drake rests on the roof to preen  his plumage, and later the dusky duck swims on its watery lawn. Above it  the wild geese harrow the low, cold arch of the sky, the last fleet of  sere leaves drifts past it in the bleak wind, and then ice and snow draw  the veil of the long winter twilight over the muskrat's homes and  haunts.    These may be gloomy days he spends groping in the dark chambers of his  hut and burrow, or gathering food in the dimly lighted icy water, with  never a sight of the upper world nor ever a sunbeam to warm him.    But there are more woful days when the sun and the sky are again opened  to him, and he breathes the warm air of spring, hears the blackbirds  sing and the bittern boom. For, amid all the gladness of nature's  reawakened life, danger lurks in all his paths; the cruel, hungry trap  gapes for him on every jutting log, on every feeding-bed, even in the  doorway of his burrow and by the side of his house.    The trapper's skiff invades all his pleasant waters; on every hand he  hears the splash of its paddles, the clank of its setting pole, and he  can scarcely show his head above water but a deadly shower of lead  bursts upon it. He hears the simulated call of his beloved, and voyaging  hot-hearted to the cheating tryst meets only death.    At last comes the summer truce and happy days of peace in the tangled  jungle of the marsh, with the wild duck and bittern nesting beside his  watery path, the marsh wren weaving her rushy bower above it.    So the days of his life go on, and the days of his race continue in the  land of his unnumbered generations. Long may he endure to enliven the  drear tameness of civilization with a memory of the world's old  wildness.          XLII    NOVEMBER VOICES      With flowers and leaves, the bird songs have faded out, and the hum and  chirp of insect life, the low and bleat of herds and flocks afield, and  the busy sounds of husbandry have grown infrequent. There are lapses of  such silence that the ear aches for some audible signal of life; and  then to appease it there comes with the rising breeze the solemn murmur  of the pines like the song of the sea on distant shores, the sibilant  whisper of the dead herbage, the clatter of dry pods, and the fitful  stir of fallen leaves, like a scurry of ghostly feet fleeing in affright  at the sound of their own passage.    The breeze puffs itself into a fury of wind, and the writhing branches  shriek and moan and clash as if the lances of phantom armies were  crossed in wild melee.    The woods are full of unlipped voices speaking one with another in  pleading, in anger, in soft tones of endearment; and one hears his name  called so distinctly that he answers and calls again, but no answer is  vouchsafed him, only moans and shrieks and mocking laughter, till one  has enough of wild voices and longs for a relapse of silence.    More softly it is broken when through the still air comes the cheery  note of the chickadee and the little trumpet of his comrade the nuthatch  and far away the muffled beat of the grouse's drum, or from a distance  the mellow baying of a hound and its answering echoes, swelling and  dying on hilltop or glen, or mingling in melodious confusion.    From skyward comes the clangor of clarions, wild and musical,  proclaiming the march of gray cohorts of geese advancing southward  through the hills and dales of cloudland. There come, too, the quick  whistling beat of wild ducks' pinions, the cry of a belated plover, and  the creaking voice of a snipe. Then the bawling of a ploughman in a  far-off field--and farther away the rumble and shriek of a railroad  train--brings the listening ear to earth again and its plodding busy  life.          XLIII    THANKSGIVING      Doubtless many a sportsman has bethought him that his Thanksgiving  turkey will have a finer flavor if the feast is prefaced by a few hours  in the woods, with dog and gun. Meaner fare than this day of bounty  furnishes forth is made delicious by such an appetizer, and the  Thanksgiving feast will be none the worse for it.    What can be sweeter than the wholesome fragrance of the fallen leaves?  What more invigorating than the breath of the two seasons that we catch:  here in the northward shade of a wooded hill the nipping air of winter,  there where the southern slope meets the sun the genial warmth of an  October day. Here one's footsteps crunch sharply the frozen herbage and  the ice-bearded border of a spring's overflow; there splash in thawed  pools and rustle softly among the dead leaves.    The flowers are gone, but they were not brighter than the winter berries  and bittersweet that glow around one. The deciduous leaves are fallen  and withered, but they were not more beautiful than the delicate tracery  of their forsaken branches, and the steadfast foliage of the evergreens  was never brighter. The song-birds are singing in southern woods, but  chickadee, nuthatch, and woodpecker are chatty and companionable and  keep the woods in heart with a stir of life.    Then from overhead or underfoot a ruffed grouse booms away into the gray  haze of branches, and one hears the whirr and crash of his headlong  flight long after he is lost to sight, perchance long after the echo of  a futile shot has died away. Far off one hears the intermittent  discharge of rifles where the shooters are burning powder for their  Thanksgiving turkey, and faintly from far away comes the melancholy  music of a hound. Then nearer and clearer, then a rustle of velvet-clad  feet, and lo, reynard himself, the wildest spirit of the woods,  materializes out of the russet indistinctness and flashes past, with  every sense alert. Then the hound goes by, and footstep, voice, and echo  sink into silence. For silence it is, though the silver tinkle of the  brook is in it, and the stir of the last leaf shivering forsaken on its  bough.    In such quietude one may hold heartfelt thanksgiving, feasting full upon  a crust and a draught from the icy rivulet, and leave rich viands and  costly wines for the thankless surfeiting of poorer men.          XLIV    DECEMBER DAYS      Fewer and more chill have become the hours of sunlight, and longer  stretch the noontide shadows of the desolate trees athwart the tawny  fields and the dead leaves that mat the floor of the woods.    The brook braids its shrunken strands of brown water with a hushed  murmur over a bed of sodden leaves between borders of spiny ice  crystals, or in the pools swirl in slow circles the imprisoned fleets of  bubbles beneath a steadfast roof of glass. Dark and sullen the river  sulks its cheerless way, enlivened but by the sheldrake that still  courses his prey in the icy water, and the mink that like a fleet black  shadow steals along the silent banks. Gaudy wood duck and swift-winged  teal have long since departed and left stream and shore to these  marauders and to the trapper, who now gathers here his latest harvest.    The marshes are silent and make no sign of life, though beneath the  domes of many a sedge-built roof the unseen muskrats are astir, and  under the icy cover of the channels fare to and fro on their affairs of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36866"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 3 (of 8) (#20)"],[1,"atisfying. Indeed a most       peculiar thing about the whole affair was the great amount       of work we managed to do on a very small amount of food. The       shadows of the evening were falling as we finished our meal,       sent out the necessary pickets, and prepared for rest.\"    Later came the death of poor Macleod the Queenslander, whose wound had  been mortal. As the Queenslanders had early moved on to Rooi Pan (a  farmhouse across the veldt where rebels were suspected to be in hiding),  the Canadians took upon themselves the duty of conducting the sad  ceremonies of burial. A grave was dug and a New Testament found. Then  the Canadians slowly bore to its last resting-place the remains of the  heroic young Colonial who had lost his life in the service of the mother  country. Major Bayly, the Staff Officer of the expedition, read a few  selections from Corinthians over the body, after which it was consigned  to the heart of the veldt. A rude cross bearing his name and corps was  placed to mark the spot, and written thereon was also the intimation  that it was \"Erected by his Queensland and Canadian comrades.\" The noble  young fellow Victor Jones secured less formal burial, though his loss  was as deeply regretted. On the following day two of his comrades from  Rooi Pan started off in search of his body, and having found it, buried  it without ceremony or rite, but with the keenest feelings of sorrow.    On this day, the 2nd of January, the work of destruction of Boer effects  was begun. Soon after dawn a huge bonfire was made under such waggons  and ammunition of the foe as could not be utilised, and as the troops  marched out they were saluted by the appalling uproar of the exploding  cartridges. The procession, as it moved on its way to Rooi Pan, a  distance of some four or six miles, presented a somewhat mediaeval aspect  in spite of symbols of modernity--magazine rifles and machine guns. In  front was the wide expanse of grassy veldt; behind, the curling blue  smoke from the burning wreckage of the camp. Along the road came the  heavy springless waggons piled high with booty, their negro drivers  flourishing their long whips and repeating their vociferous bark of  \"Eigh\" to encourage the small, contumacious mules. With them marched the  bronzed, picturesque-looking army with its train of captives in the  rear, an unkempt, dilapidated crew--a strange contrast to the lively and  robust Canadians, who, rejoiced at their yesterday's feat, were singing  as they tramped along. Very curious was it to hear, instead of the  familiar British airs our soldiers love, the Niagara camp-song with its  Hallelujah chorus, and the popular \"The Maple Leaf\" proceeding from the  brawny throats of these brother soldiers of the Queen. Their joy and  their triumph was complete, and with a good night's rest and the  beautiful morning air to refresh them, their spirits were effervescent  in the extreme.    At Rooi Pan there was a halt for half-an-hour, during which Colonel  Pilcher took the opportunity to address his force, and convey to them  congratulations on the recent fight which had been forwarded by General  Wood, commanding at the Orange River. Water-bottles were then filled  from the clear pond in the farm of one of the prisoners, and soon, the  sun growing momentarily hotter, the party advanced. This time their  route lay over dust ankle-deep in places, dust which rose up in clouds  and came down into eyes and ears and throats, and settled itself in hot  cakes and rings on hair and beards and necks. But presently, after a few  miles, the state of things was improved. Government roads stretched a  smooth highway in front, and kopjes--the dangerous kopjes that afforded  such comfortable hiding-places for the wily foe--grew fewer and farther  between. There was now comparative comfort, for there was little fear of  encounter with the enemy in the open.    The journey was continued without event. There was no sign of  opposition, and about three o'clock in the afternoon, as they neared  their destination, a message came in, \"Nothing to be seen in Douglas but  Union Jacks and red ensigns.\" This was a fact, and Colonel Pilcher and  his troops very soon occupied the town. Never was there a more  enthusiastic demonstration: the loyal inhabitants cheered to the echo;  some almost wept at the arrival of their deliverers.    This town is situated below the junction of the Modder and Vaal Rivers,  and is of some importance. Here the long-suffering loyalists had  remained, ever since the commencement of hostilities, in anxious  expectation, awaiting the arrival of the British troops. Naturally the  frenzy of their delight knew no bounds, particularly when it was found  how completely the rebels had dispersed. Fourteen tents, three waggons,  an immense store of rifles and ammunition, saddles, forage, equipment,  and many incriminating letters were seized. On some of the envelopes  were stamped \"On Her Majesty's Service,\" showing that these had been  used by the newly appointed Landrost of Douglas in the absence of an  official Free State superscription.    The joy of the loyalists was of short duration. In the afternoon Colonel  Pilcher broke to them the terrible news. He stated that, for military  reasons, his force would be obliged to leave on the morrow.  Consternation prevailed. The leading members of the community explained  that, if deserted, their lives would not be worth a moment's purchase.  It was impossible to remain where they were and await the return of the  enemy, consequently Colonel Pilcher ordered all who wished to leave to  be ready by six the next morning, and promised them safe conduct to  Belmont. Thereupon a scene of great animation ensued. An immense exodus  was actively arranged. Vehicles of all kinds, sizes, and shapes were got  ready, while the women and babies--such as overflowed the transport  accommodation--were taken charge of by the gallant Canadians. These  marched forth singing, to keep up the spirits of the community, and  finally, when the wearisome end of the journey seemed never to be  reached, some of the noble fellows, although worn out with a long spell  of active work, and suffering from sore feet, carried the babies, and  thus relieved the women of the fatigue of the march. The cortege left  Douglas at eight o'clock on the morning of the 3rd, and reached Dover  Farm at two o'clock. With the refugees were sent forward the captured  rebels. These before their departure were paraded, and Colonel Pilcher  enjoined those who were Free Staters or Transvaalers to step from the  ranks, as they would be treated as prisoners of war. The rebels who had  taken up arms against their Queen would suffer different treatment. No  one stepped forward, and it was evident that either there were no Boers  among the number, or they mistrusted the assurances of Colonel Pilcher,  and preferred to meet their fate _en bloc_. (They were subsequently sent  to the Cape for trial.) Colonel Pilcher's \"slim\" arrangement for the  confusing of the natives prior to making his advance was eminently  successful, for the Boers, so a prisoner said, considered themselves  deeply aggrieved that they had not received information regarding the  proposed movements. On the 5th Colonel Pilcher's column arrived at  Belmont. The night's march from Cook's Farm was splendidly managed. News  had reached him to the effect that some 600 or 800 Boers intended to  effect a junction, and attack the column. At eight o'clock, therefore,  the whole force started quietly forth, stealing off in the jetty  obscurity like a band of conspirators. A halt was made during the night  to allow the troops a short spell of repose: after this they continued  their journey without mishap. Two companies of Canadians were employed  to hold a pass some six miles off Belmont, in order to prevent the  incoming force being cut off by the enemy.    So ended, happily, a most successful raid. The Colonial troops had more  than acted up to the expectation of every one; and, though it was  somewhat disappointing that Douglas had to be instantly evacuated, the  expedition had helped to demonstrate to the loyalists that the British  could and would come to their aid, and that faith in the end has its  reward.    The following table of their march is interesting as showing the wear  and tear to which the troops were subjected:--                                                            Miles.

Telegrams poured in from all parts of the Queen's dominions  congratulating Colonel Pilcher and the Colonials on the excellent work  they had accomplished. The following from G.O.C., Cape Town, read:--         \"Congratulate Colonel Pilcher on brilliant exploit, which will       have far-reaching effect.\"    From Military Secretary, Government House:--         \"Please send following message to Colonial troops employed in       action at Sunnyside: 'His Excellency Sir Alfred Milner sends       you his heartiest congratulations on your success, and hopes it       is only the forerunner of many more. While regretting the loss       of some of your brave comrades, he feels sure that your friends       in the colonies over the sea will feel proud of the success of       their representatives, as he himself does.'\"    From Sir Redvers Buller the following was received:-"]]]
