The pendulous  forms owe their peculiarity to a lengthening of the branches and a loss  of their habit of growing upwards; they are too weak to retain a  vertical position and the response to gravity, which is ordinarily the  cause of the upright growth, is lacking in them. As far as we know, the  cause of this weeping habit is the same in all instances. The fastigiate  trees and shrubs are a counterpart of the weeping forms. Here the  tendency to grow in a horizontal direction is lacking, and with it the  bilateral and symmetric structure of the branches has disappeared. In  the ordinary yew-tree the upright stem bears its needles equally  distributed around its circumference, but on the branches the needles  are inserted in two rows, one to the left and one to the right. All the  needles turn their upper surfaces upwards, [137] and their lower  surfaces downwards, and all of them are by this means placed in a single  horizontal plane, and branching takes place in the same plane. Evidently  this general arrangement is another response to gravity, and it is the  failure of this reaction which induces the branches to grow upwards and  to behave like stems.    Both weeping and fastigiate characters are therefore to be regarded as  steps in a negative direction, and it is highly important that even such  marked departures occur without transitions or intermediate forms. If  these should occur, though ever so rarely, they would probably have been  brought to notice, on account of the great prospect the numerous  instances would offer. The fact that they are lacking, proves that the  steps, though apparently great, are in reality to be considered as  covering single units, that cannot be divided into smaller parts.  Unfortunately we are still in the dark as to the question of the  inheritance of these forms, since in most cases it is difficult to  obtain pure seed.    We now consider the cases of the loss of superficial organs, of which  the nectarines are example. These are smooth peaches, lacking the soft  hairy down, that is a marked peculiarity of the true peaches. They occur  in different [138] races of the peach. As early as the beginning of the  past century, Gallesio described no less than eight subvarieties of  nectarines, each related to a definite race of peach. Most of them  reproduce themselves truly from seed, as is well known in this country  concerning the clingstones, freestones and some other types. Nectarines  have often varied, giving rise to new sorts, as in the case of the white  nectarine and many others differing greatly in appearance and flavor. On  the other hand it is to be remarked, that the trees do not differ in  other respects and cannot be distinguished while young, the varietal  mark being limited to the loss of the down on the fruit. Peaches have  been known to produce nectarines, and nectarines to yield true peaches.  Here we have another instance of positive and negative steps with  reference to the same character, but I cannot withhold an expression of  some doubt as to the possibility of crossing and subsequently splitting  up of the hybrids as a more probable explanation of at least some of the  cases quoted by various writers.    Smooth or glabrous varieties often occur, and some of them have already  been cited as instances of the multiplication of varietal names.  Positive aberrations are rather rare, and are mostly restricted to a  greater density of the [139] pubescence in some hairy species, as in  _Galeopsis Ladanum canescens_, _Lotus corniculatus hirsutus_ and so on.  But _Veronica scutellata_ is smooth and has a pubescent variety, and  Cytisus prostratus and _C. spinescens_ are each recorded to have a  ciliate form.    Comparable with the occurrence and the lack of hairs, is the existence  or deficiency of the glaucous effect in leaves, as is well known in the  common _Ricinus_. Here the glaucous appearance is due to wax distributed  in fine particles over the surface of the leaves, and in the green  variety this wax is lacking. Other instances could be given as in the  green varieties of _Papaver alpinum_ and _Rumex scutatus_. No positive  instances are recorded in this case.    Spines and prickles may often disappear and give rise to unarmed and  defenceless types. Of the thorn-apples both species, the whiteflowered  _Datura Stramonium_ and the purple _D. Tatula_ have such varieties.  Spinach has a variety called the \"Dutch,\" which lacks the prickles of  the fruit; it is a very old form and absolutely constant, as are also  the thornless thorn-apples. Last year a very curious instance of a  partial loss of prickles was discovered by Mr. Cockerell of East Las  Vegas in New Mexico. It is a variety of the American cocklebur, often  called sea-burdock, or the [140] hedgehog-burweed, a stout and common  weed of the western states. Its Latin name is _Xanthium canadense_ or  _X. commune_ and the form referred to is named by Mr. Cockerell, _X.  Wootoni_, in honor of Professor E.o. Wooton who described the first  collected specimens.    The burs of the common species are densely covered with long prickles,  which are slightly hooked at the apex. In the new form, which is similar  in all other respects to the common cocklebur, the burs are more slender  and the prickles much less numerous, about 25 to the bur and mostly  stouter at the base. It occurs abundantly in New Mexico, always growing  with the common species, and seems to be quite constant from seed. Mr.  Cockerell kindly sent me some burs of both forms, and from these I  raised in my garden last year a nice lot of the common, as well as of  the _Wootoni_ plants.    Spineless varieties are recorded for the bastard-acacia, the holly and  the garden gooseberry (_Ribes Grossularia_, or _R. Uva-crispa_). A  spineless sport of the prickly Broom (_Ulex europaeus_) has been seen  from time to time, but it has not been propagated.    Summarizing the foregoing facts, we have excellent evidence of varieties  being produced either by the loss of some marked peculiarity or by the  acquisition of others that are already [141] present in allied species.  There are a great many cases however, in which the morphologic cause of  the dissimilarity is not so easily discerned. But there is no reason to  doubt that most of them will be found to conform to the rule on closer  investigation. Therefore we can consider the following as the principal  difference between elementary species and varieties; that the first  arise by the acquisition of entirely new characters, and the latter by  the loss of existing qualities or by the gain of such peculiarities as  may already be seen in other allied species.    If we suppose elementary species and varieties originated by sudden  leaps or mutations, then the elementary species have mutated in the line  of progression, some varieties have mutated in the line of  retrogression, while others have diverged from their parental types in a  line of depression, or in the way of repetition. This conception agrees  quite well with the current idea that in the building up of the  vegetable kingdom according to the theory of descent, it is species that  form the links of the chain from the lower forms to the more highly  organized later derivatives. Otherwise expressed, the system is built up  of species, and varieties are only local and lateral, but never of real  importance for the whole structure.    [142] Heretofore we have generally assumed, that varieties differ from  the parent-species in a single character only, or at least that only one  need be considered. We now come to the study of those varieties, which  differ in more than one character. Of these there are two types. In the  first the points of dissimilarity are intimately connected with one  another, in the second they are more or less independent.    The mutually related peculiarities may be termed correlative, and we  therefore speak, in such cases, of correlative variability. This  phenomenon is of the highest importance and is of general occurrence.  But before describing some examples, it is as well to note that in the  lecture on fluctuating variability, cases of a totally different nature  will be dealt with, which unfortunately are designated by the same term.  Such merely fluctuating variations are therefore to be left out of the  present discussion.    The purple thorn-apple, which is considered by some writers as a variety  of the white-flowered species or _Datura Stramonium_, and by others as a  separate species, _D. Tatula_, will serve as an illustration. But as its  distinguishing attributes, as far as we are concerned with them here,  are of the nature described above as characteristic of varietal  peculiarities no objection [143] can be made to our using them as a case  of correlative variability.    The essential character of the purple thornapple lies in the color of  the flowers, which are of a very beautiful pale blue. But this color is  not limited to the corolla. It is also to be seen in the stems and in  the stalks and veins of the leaves, which are stained with a deep  purple, the blue color being added to the original green. Even on the  surface of the leaves it may spread into a purplish hue. On the stems it  is to be met with everywhere, and even the young seedlings show it. This  is of some importance, as the young plants when unfolding their  cotyledons and primary leaves, may be distinguished by this means from  the seedlings of the white flowered species.    In crossing experiments it is therefore possible to distinguish the  whites and the blues, even in young seedlings, and experience shows that  the correlation is quite constant. The color can always be relied upon;  if lacking in the seedlings, it will be lacking in the stems and flowers  also; but if the axis of the young plant is ever so slightly tinged, the  color will show itself in its beauty in the later stages of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7238"],[0,"My Four Years in Germany (#20)"],[1," that proper  protection could be provided at the railway station.    On one occasion a number of Japanese were waiting in the Embassy  in order to take the night train for Munich. I sent a servant  to take them out in order that they might get something to eat  in a restaurant, but as no restaurant in Berlin would sell them  food, arrangements were made to give them meals in the Embassy.    The members of the Siamese Legation, who in appearance greatly  resemble the Japanese, were often subjected to indignities, and  for a long time did not dare move about freely in Berlin, or  even leave their houses.    The Japanese were marvels of courtesy. After I visited some of  them at the civilian camp of Ruhleben, they wrote me a letter  thanking me for the visit. Nearly every Japanese leaving Germany  on his arrival in Switzerland wrote me a grateful letter.    When I finally left Germany, as I stepped from the special train  at Zürich, a Japanese woman, who had been imprisoned in Germany  and whose husband I had visited in a prison, came forward to thank  me. A Japanese man was waiting in the hotel office in Berne when  I arrived there, for a similar purpose, and the next morning  early the Japanese Minister called and left a beautiful clock for  Mrs. Gerard as an expression of his gratitude for the attention  shown to his countrymen. It was really a pleasure to be able to  do something for these polite and charming people.    On August twentieth I paid my first visit to a German prison  camp. This was to the camp at Doeberitz situated about eight  miles west of Berlin, a sort of military camp with permanent  barracks. Some of these barracks were used for the confinement  of such British civilians as the Germans had arrested in the  first days of the war. There were only a few British among the  prisoners, with a number of Russian and French. I was allowed  to converse freely with the prisoners and found that they had  no complaints. As the war went on, however, a number of British  prisoners of war were taken by the Germans during the course of  the great retreat of the British in Northern France. Then officers  and privates began to come into Germany and were distributed  in various camps. Finally, in the autumn of 1914, the British  Government decided on interning a great number of Germans in  Great Britain; and the German government immediately, and as  a reprisal, interned all the British civilian men who, up to  this time, had enjoyed comparative freedom in Berlin and other  cities of the Empire. The British civilians were shut up in a  race track about five miles from the centre of Berlin, called  Ruhleben. This race track in peace times was used for contests  of trotting horses and on it were the usual grandstands and brick  stable buildings containing box stalls with hay lofts above,  where the race horses were kept.    On August twentieth I paid my first visit to the police presidency  in Berlin where political prisoners, when arrested, were confined. A  small number of British prisoners subject to especial investigation  were there interned. This prison, which I often subsequently  visited, was clean and well kept, and I never had any particular  complaints from the prisoners confined there, except, of course,  as the war progressed, concerning the inadequacy of the food.    I had organised a special department immediately on the breaking  out of the war to care for the interests of the British. At first  Mr. Boylston Beal, a lawyer of Boston, assisted by Mr. Rivington  Pyne of New York, was at the head of this department, of which  later the Honourable John B. Jackson, formerly our Minister to  the Balkan States, Greece and Cuba, took charge. He volunteered  to give his assistance at the commencement of the war and I was  glad of his help, especially as he had been twelve years secretary  in the Berlin Embassy and, therefore, was well acquainted not  only with Germany but with German official life and customs. Mr.  Jackson was most ably assisted by Charles H. Russell, Jr., of  New York, and Lithgow Osborne. Of course, others in the Embassy  had much to do with this department.    The first privates, prisoners of war, came to the camp of Doeberitz  near Berlin. Early in the war Mr. Grew, our First Secretary, and  Consul General Lay visited the camp for officers at Torgau. The  question of the inspection of prisoners of the camps and the rights  of Ambassadors charged with the interests of hostile powers was  quite in the clouds. So many reports came to Germany about the  bad treatment in England of German prisoners of war that I finally  arranged to have Mr. Jackson visit them and report. This was arranged  by my colleague, our Ambassador to Great Britain, and in the first  winter Mr. Jackson made his trip there. His report of conditions  there did much to allay the German belief as to the ill-treatment  of their subjects who were prisoners in Great Britain and helped  me greatly in bringing about better conditions in Germany. After  vainly endeavouring to get the German government to agree to some  definite plan for the inspection of the prisoners, after my notes  to the Foreign Office had remained unanswered for a long period of  time, and after sending a personal letter to von Jagow calling his  attention to the fact that the delay was injuring German prisoners  in other countries, I finally called on von Bethmann-Hollweg  and told him that my notes concerning prisoners were sent by  the Foreign Office to the military authorities: that, while I  could talk with officials of the Foreign Office, I never came into  contact with the people who really passed upon the notes sent by  me, and who made the decisions as to the treatment of prisoners  of war and inspection of their camps; and I begged the Chancellor  to break down diplomatic precedent and allow me to speak with  the military authorities who decided these questions. I said,  \"If I cannot get an answer to my proposition about prisoners, I  will take a chair and sit in front of your palace in the street  until I receive an answer.\"    The result was a meeting in my office.    I discussed the question involved with two representatives from  the Foreign Office, two from the General Staff, two from the War  Department and with Count Schwerin who commanded the civilian camp  at the Ruhleben race track. In twenty minutes we managed to reach  an agreement which I then and there drew up: the substance of  which, as between Great Britain and Germany, was that the American  Ambassador and his representatives in Germany and the American  Ambassador and his representatives in Great Britain should have  the right to visit the prison camps on giving reasonable notice,  which was to be twenty-four hours where possible, and should have  the right to converse with the prisoners, within sight but out  of hearing, of the camp officials; that an endeavour should be  made to adjust matters complained of with the camp authorities  before bringing them to the notice of higher authorities; that  ten representatives should be named by our Ambassador and that  these should receive passes enabling them to visit the camps  under the conditions above stated. This agreement was ratified  by the British and German Governments and thereafter for a long  time we worked under its provisions and in most questions dealt  direct with the War Department.    Of course, before this meeting I had managed to get permission  to visit the camps of Ruhleben and Doeberitz near Berlin; and  Mr. Michaelson, our consul at Cologne, and Mr. Jackson and others  at the Embassy had been permitted to visit certain camps. But  immediately preceding the meeting on the fourth of March and  while matters were still being discussed we were compelled to  a certain extent to suspend our visits.    In the first days of the war it was undoubtedly and unfortunately  true that prisoners of war taken by the Germans, both at the time  of their capture and in transit to the prison camps, were often  badly treated by the soldiers, guards or the civil population.    The instances were too numerous, the evidence too overwhelming,  to be denied. In the prison camps themselves, owing to the peculiar  system of military government in Germany, the treatment of the  prisoners varied greatly. As I have, I think, stated in another  place, Germany is divided into army corps districts. Over each  of these districts is, in time of war, a representative corps  commander who is clothed with absolute power in that district,  his orders superseding those of all civilian officials. These  corps commanders do not report to the war department but are  in a measure independent and very jealous of their rights. For  instance, to show the difficulty of dealing with these corps  commanders, after my arrangements concerning the inspection of  prisoners of war had been ratified by both the Imperial and British  governments, I went to Halle to inspect the place of detention  for officers there. Halle is some hours from Berlin and when  I had driven out to the camp, I was met by the commander who  told me that I might visit the camp but that I could not speak  to the prisoners out of hearing. I told him that our arrangement  was otherwise, but, as he remained firm I returned to Berlin.  I complained to the Foreign Office and was told there that the  matter would be arranged and so I again, some days later, returned  to Halle. My experience on the second trip was exactly the same  as the first. I spoke to von Jagow who explained the situation to  me, and advised me to visit first the corps commander at Magdeburg  and try and arrange the matter with him. I did so and was finally  permitted to visit this camp and to talk to the officers out of  ear-shot.    This camp of Halle was continued during the war, although not at  all a fit place for the detention of officers, who were lodged in  the old factory buildings surrounded by a sort"]]]
