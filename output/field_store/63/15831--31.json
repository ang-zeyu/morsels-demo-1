We  say \"a Tartuffe,\" but we should never say \"a Phedre\" or \"a Polyeucte.\"    Above all, a tragic poet will never think of grouping around the chief  character in his play secondary characters to serve as simplified  copies, so to speak, of the former. The hero of a tragedy represents an  individuality unique of its kind. It may be possible to imitate him,  but then we shall be passing, whether consciously or not, from the  tragic to the comic. No one is like him, because he is like no one. But  a remarkable instinct, on the contrary, impels the comic poet, once he  has elaborated his central character, to cause other characters,  displaying the same general traits, to revolve as satellites round him.  Many comedies have either a plural noun or some collective term as  their title. \"Les Femmes savantes,\" \"Les Precieuses ridicules,\" \"Le  Monde ou l'on s'ennuie,\" etc., represent so many rallying points on the  stage adopted by different groups of characters, all belonging to one  identical type. It would be interesting to analyse this tendency in  comedy. Maybe dramatists have caught a glimpse of a fact recently  brought forward by mental pathology, viz. that cranks of the same kind  are drawn, by a secret attraction, to seek each other's company.  Without precisely coming within the province of medicine, the comic  individual, as we have shown, is in some way absentminded, and the  transition from absent-mindedness to crankiness is continuous. But  there is also another reason. If the comic poet's object is to offer us  types, that is to say, characters capable of self-repetition, how can  he set about it better than by showing us, in each instance, several  different copies of the same model? That is just what the naturalist  does in order to define a species. He enumerates and describes its main  varieties.    This essential difference between tragedy and comedy, the former being  concerned with individuals and the latter with classes, is revealed in  yet another way. It appears in the first draft of the work. From the  outset it is manifested by two radically different methods of  observation.    Though the assertion may seem paradoxical, a study of other men is  probably not necessary to the tragic poet. We find some of the great  poets have lived a retiring, homely sort of life, without having a  chance of witnessing around them an outburst of the passions they have  so faithfully depicted. But, supposing even they had witnessed such a  spectacle, it is doubtful whether they would have found it of much use.  For what interests us in the work of the poet is the glimpse we get of  certain profound moods or inner struggles. Now, this glimpse cannot be  obtained from without. Our souls are impenetrable to one another.  Certain signs of passion are all that we ever apperceive externally.  These we interpret--though always, by the way, defectively--only by  analogy with what we have ourselves experienced. So what we experience  is the main point, and we cannot become thoroughly acquainted with  anything but our own heart--supposing we ever get so far. Does this  mean that the poet has experienced what he depicts, that he has gone  through the various situations he makes his characters traverse, and  lived the whole of their inner life? Here, too, the biographies of  poets would contradict such a supposition. How, indeed, could the same  man have been Macbeth, Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and many others? But  then a distinction should perhaps here be made between the personality  WE HAVE and all those we might have had. Our character is the result of  a choice that is continually being renewed. There are points--at all  events there seem to be--all along the way, where we may branch off,  and we perceive many possible directions though we are unable to take  more than one. To retrace one's steps, and follow to the end the  faintly distinguishable directions, appears to be the essential element  in poetic imagination. Of course, Shakespeare was neither Macbeth, nor  Hamlet, nor Othello; still, he MIGHT HAVE BEEN these several characters  if the circumstances of the case on the one hand, and the consent of  his will on the other, had caused to break out into explosive action  what was nothing more than an inner prompting. We are strangely  mistaken as to the part played by poetic imagination, if we think it  pieces together its heroes out of fragments filched from right and  left, as though it were patching together a harlequin's motley. Nothing  living would result from that. Life cannot be recomposed; it can only  be looked at and reproduced. Poetic imagination is but a fuller view of  reality. If the characters created by a poet give us the impression of  life, it is only because they are the poet himself,--multiplication or  division of the poet,--the poet plumbing the depths of his own nature  in so powerful an effort of inner observation that he lays hold of the  potential in the real, and takes up what nature has left as a mere  outline or sketch in his soul in order to make of it a finished work of  art.    Altogether different is the kind of observation from which comedy  springs. It is directed outwards. However interested a dramatist may be  in the comic features of human nature, he will hardly go, I imagine, to  the extent of trying to discover his own. Besides, he would not find  them, for we are never ridiculous except in some point that remains  hidden from our own consciousness. It is on others, then, that such  observation must perforce be practised. But it; will, for this very  reason, assume a character of generality that it cannot have when we  apply it to ourselves. Settling on the surface, it will not be more  than skin-deep, dealing with persons at the point at which they come  into contact and become capable of resembling one another. It will go  no farther. Even if it could, it would not desire to do so, for it  would have nothing to gain in the process.    To penetrate too far into the personality, to couple the outer effect  with causes that are too deep-seated, would mean to endanger and in the  end to sacrifice all that was laughable in the effect. In order that we  may be tempted to laugh at it, we must localise its cause in some  intermediate region of the soul. Consequently, the effect must appear  to us as an average effect, as expressing an average of mankind. And,  like all averages, this one is obtained by bringing together scattered  data, by comparing analogous cases and extracting their essence, in  short by a process of abstraction and generalisation similar to that  which the physicist brings to bear upon facts with the object of  grouping them under laws. In a word, method and object are here of the  same nature as in the inductive sciences, in that observation is always  external and the result always general.    And so we come back, by a roundabout way, to the double conclusion we  reached in the course of our investigations. On the one hand, a person  is never ridiculous except through some mental attribute resembling  absent-mindedness, through something that lives upon him without  forming part of his organism, after the fashion of a parasite; that is  the reason this state of mind is observable from without and capable of  being corrected. But, on the other hand, just because laughter aims at  correcting, it is expedient that the correction should reach as great a  number of persons as possible. This is the reason comic observation  instinctively proceeds to what is general. It chooses such  peculiarities as admit of being reproduced and consequently are not  indissolubly bound up with the individuality of a single person,--a  possibly common sort of uncommonness, so to say,--peculiarities that  are held in common. By transferring them to the stage, it creates works  which doubtless belong to art in that their only visible aim is to  please, but which will be found to contrast with other works of art by  reason of their generality and also of their scarcely confessed or  scarcely conscious intention to correct and instruct. So we were  probably right in saying that comedy lies midway between art and life.  It is not disinterested as genuine art is. By organising laughter,  comedy accepts social life as a natural environment, it even obeys an  impulse of social life. And in this respect it turns its back upon art,  which is a breaking away from society and a return to pure nature.      II    Now let us see, in the light of what has gone before, the line to take  for creating an ideally comic type of character, comic in itself, in  its origin, and in all its manifestations. It must be deep-rooted, so  as to supply comedy with inexhaustible matter, and yet superficial, in  order that it may remain within the scope of comedy; invisible to its  actual owner, for the comic ever partakes of the unconscious, but  visible to everybody else, so that it may call forth general laughter,  extremely considerate to its own self, so that it may be displayed  without scruple, but troublesome to others, so that they may repress it  without pity; immediately repressible, so that our laughter may not  have been wasted, but sure of reappearing under fresh aspects, so that  laughter may always find something to do; inseparable from social life,  although insufferable to society; capable--in order that it may assume  the greatest imaginable variety of forms--of being tacked on to all the  vices and even to a good many virtues. Truly a goodly number of  elements to fuse together! But a chemist of the soul, entrusted with  this elaborate preparation, would be somewhat disappointed when pouring  out the contents of his retort. He would find he had taken a vast deal  of trouble"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4358"],[0,"The Sea Fairies (#20)"],[1,"   Sacho whistled a little tune and seemed thoughtful. \"Zog is  foolish,\" said he. \"How often have I told him that vengeance is a  waste of time. He is worried to know how to destroy you, and that is  wasting more time. You are worried for fear he will injure you, and  so you also are wasting time. My, my! What a waste of time is going  on in this castle!\"    \"Seems to me that we have so much time it doesn't matter,\" said  Trot. \"What's time for, anyhow?\"    \"Time is given us to be happy, and for no other reason,\" replied the  boy soberly. \"When we waste time, we waste happiness. But there is  no time for preaching, so I'll go.\"    \"Please wait a moment, Sacho,\" said the Queen.    \"Can I do anything to make you happy?\" he asked, smiling again.    \"Yes,\" answered Aquareine. \"We are curious to know who does all this  beautiful gold work and ornamentation.\"    \"Some of the slaves here are goldsmiths, having been taught by Zog  to forge and work metal under water,\" explained Sacho. \"In parts of  the ocean lie many rocks filled with veins of pure gold and golden  nuggets, and we get large supplies from sunken ships as well. There  is no lack of gold here, but it is not as precious as it is upon the  earth because here we have no need of money.\"    \"We would like to see the goldsmiths at work,\" announced the Queen.    The boy hesitated a moment. Then he said, \"I will take you to their  room, where you may watch them for a time. I will not ask Zog's  permission to do this, for he might refuse. But my orders were to  allow you the liberty of the castle, and so I will let you see the  goldsmiths' shop.\"    \"Thank you,\" replied Aquareine quietly, and then the four followed  Sacho along various corridors until they came to a large room where  a dozen men were busily at work. Lying here and there were heaps of  virgin gold, some in its natural state and some already fashioned  into ornaments and furniture of various sorts. Each man worked at a  bench where there was a curious iron furnace in which glowed a  vivid, white light. Although this workshop was all under water and  the workmen were all obliged to breathe as fishes do, the furnaces  glowed so hot that the water touching them was turned into steam.  Gold or other metal held over a furnace quickly softened or melted,  when it could be forged or molded into any shape desired.    \"The furnaces are electric,\" explained Sacho, \"and heat as well  under water as they would in the open air. Let me introduce you to  the foreman, who will tell you of his work better than I can.\"    The foreman was a slave named Agga-Groo, who was lean and lank and  had an expression more surly and unhappy than any slave they had yet  seen. Yet he seemed willing to leave his work and explain to the  visitors how he made so many beautiful things out of gold, for he  took much pride in this labor and knew its artistic worth. Moreover,  since he had been in Zog's castle these were the first strangers to  enter his workshop, so he welcomed them in his own gruff way.    The queen asked him if he was happy, and he shook his head and  replied, \"It isn't like Calcutta, where I used to work in gold  before I was wrecked at sea and nearly drowned. Zog rescued me and  brought me here a slave. It is a stupid life we lead, doing the same  things over and over every day, but perhaps it is better than being  dead. I'm not sure. The only pleasure I get in life is in creating  pretty things out of gold.\"    \"Could you forge me a golden sword?\" asked the Queen, smiling  sweetly upon the goldsmith.    \"I could, madam, but I won't unless Zog orders me to do it.\"    \"Do you like Zog better than you do me?\" inquired Aquareine.    \"No,\" was the answer. \"I hate Zog.\"    \"Then won't you make the sword to please me and to show your skill?\"  pleaded the pretty mermaid.    \"I'm afraid of my master. He might not like it,\" the man replied.    \"But he will never know,\" said Princess Clia.    \"You cannot say what Zog knows or what he doesn't know,\" growled the  man. \"I can't take chances of offending Zog, for I must live with  him always as a slave.\" With this he turned away and resumed his  work, hammering the leaf of a golden ship.    Cap'n Bill had listened carefully to this conversation, and being a  wise old sailor in his way, he thought he understood the nature of  old Agga-Groo better than the mermaids did. So he went close to the  goldsmith, and feeling in the pockets of his coat drew out a silver  compass shaped like a watch. \"I'll give you this if you'll make the  queen the golden sword,\" he said.    Agga-Groo looked at the compass with interest and tested its power  of pointing north. Then he shook his head and handed it back to  Cap'n Bill. The sailor dived into his pocket again and pulled out a  pair of scissors, which he placed beside the compass on the palm of  his big hand. \"You may have them both,\" he said.    Agga-Groo hesitated, for he wanted the scissors badly, but finally  he shook his head again. Cap'n Bill added a piece of cord, an iron  thimble, some fishhooks, four buttons and a safety pin, but still  the goldsmith would not be tempted. So with a sigh the sailor  brought out his fine, big jackknife, and at sight of this  Agga-Groo's eyes began to sparkle. Steel was not to be had at the  bottom of the sea, although gold was so plentiful. \"All right,  friend,\" he said. \"Give me that lot of trinkets and I'll make you a  pretty gold sword. But it won't be any good except to look at, for  our gold is so pure that it is very soft.\"    \"Never mind that,\" replied Cap'n Bill. \"All we want is the sword.\"    The goldsmith set to work at once, and so skillful was he that in a  few minutes he had forged a fine sword of yellow gold with an  ornamental handle. The shape was graceful and the blade keen and  slender. It was evident to them all that the golden sword would not  stand hard use, for the edge of the blade would nick and curl like  lead, but the queen was delighted with the prize and took it eagerly  in her hand.    Just then Sacho returned to say that they must go back to their  rooms, and after thanking the goldsmith, who was so busy examining  his newly acquired treasure that he made no response, they joyfully  followed the boy back to the Rose Chamber. Sacho told them that he  had just come from Zog, who was still wasting time in plotting  vengeance. \"You must be careful,\" he advised them, \"for my cruel  master intends to stop you from living, and he may succeed. Don't be  unhappy, but be careful. Zog is angry because you escaped his  Yell-Maker and the falling stones and the hot water. While he is  angry he is wasting time, but that will not help you. Take care not  to waste any time yourselves.\"    \"Do you know what Zog intends to do to us next?\" asked Princess  Clia.    \"No,\" said Sacho, \"but it is reasonable to guess that, being evil,  he intends evil. He never intends to do good, I assure you.\" Then  the boy went away.    \"I am no longer afraid,\" declared the Mermaid Queen when they were  alone. \"When I have bestowed certain fairy powers upon this golden  sword, it will fight its way against any who dare oppose us, and  even Zog himself will not care to face so powerful a weapon. I am  now able to promise you that we shall make our escape.\"    \"Good!\" cried Trot joyfully. \"Shall we start now?\"    \"Not yet, my dear. It will take me a little while to charm this  golden blade so that it will obey my commands and do my work. There  is no need of undue haste, so I propose we all sleep for a time and  obtain what rest we can. We must be fresh and ready for our great  adventure.\"    As their former nap had been interrupted, they readily agreed to  Aquareine's proposal and at once went to their couches and composed  themselves to slumber. When they were asleep, the fairy mermaid  charmed her golden sword and then she also lay down to rest herself.          CHAPTER 18    A DASH FOR LIBERTY      Trot dreamed that she was at home in her own bed, but the night  seemed chilly and she wanted to draw the coverlet up to her chin.  She was not wide awake, but realized that she was cold and unable to  move her arms to cover herself up. She tried, but could not stir.  Then she roused herself a little more and tried again. Yes, it was  cold, very cold! Really, she MUST do something to get warm, she  thought. She opened her eyes and stared at a great wall of ice in  front of her.    She was awake now, and frightened, too. But she could not move  because the ice was all around her. She was frozen inside of it, and  the air space around her was not big enough to allow her to turn  over.    At once the little girl realized what had happened. Their wicked  enemy Zog had by his magic art frozen all the water in their room  while they slept, and now they were all imprisoned and helpless.  Trot and Cap'n Bill were sure to freeze to death in a short time,  for only a tiny air space remained between their bodies and the ice,  and this air was like that of a winter day when the thermometer is  below zero.    Across the room Trot could see the mermaid queen lying on her couch,  for the solid ice was clear as crystal. Aquareine was imprisoned  just as Trot was, and although she held her fairy wand in one hand  and the golden sword in the other, she seemed unable to move either  of them, and the girl remembered that the queen always waved her  magic wand to accomplish anything. Princess Clia's couch was behind  that of Trot, so the child could not see her, and Cap'n Bill was in  his own room, probably frozen fast in the ice as the others were.    The terrible Zog has surely been very clever in this last attempt to  destroy them. Trot thought it all over, and she decided that  inasmuch as the queen was unable to wave her fairy wand, she could  do nothing to release herself or her friends.    But in this the girl was mistaken. The fairy mermaid was even now at  work trying to save them, and in a few minutes Trot was"]]]
