[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6877"],[0,"The Head of Kay's (#20)"],[1,", near the Town Hall, and Fenn continued on  his way alone. The window of the grocer's shop, with its tins of  preserved apricots and pots of jam, recalled to his mind what he had  forgotten, that the food at Kay's, though it might be wholesome (which  he doubted), was undeniably plain, and, secondly, that he had run out  of jam. Now that he was here he might as well supply that deficiency.    Now it chanced that Master Wren, of Kay's, was down town--without  leave, as was his habit--on an errand of a very similar nature. Walton  had found that he, like Fenn, lacked those luxuries of life which are  so much more necessary than necessities, and, being unable to go  himself, owing to the unfortunate accident of being kept in by his  form-master, had asked Wren to go for him. Wren's visit to the  grocer's was just ending when Fenn's began.    They met in the doorway.    Wren looked embarrassed, and nearly dropped a pot of honey, which he  secured low down after the manner of a catch in the slips. Fenn, on  the other hand, took no notice of his fellow-Kayite, but walked on  into the shop and began to inspect the tins of biscuits which were  stacked on the floor by the counter.          XIX    THE GUILE OF WREN      Wren did not quite know what to make of this. Why had not Fenn said a  word to him? There were one or two prefects in the school whom he  might have met even at such close quarters and yet have cherished a  hope that they had not seen him. Once he had run right into Drew, of  the School House, and escaped unrecognised. But with Fenn it was  different. Compared to Fenn, lynxes were astigmatic. He must have  spotted him.    There was a vein of philosophy in Wren's composition. He felt that he  might just as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb. In other words,  having been caught down town without leave, he might as well stay  there and enjoy himself a little while longer before going back to be  executed. So he strolled off down the High Street, bought a few things  at a stationer's, and wound up with an excellent tea at the  confectioner's by the post-office.    It was as he was going to this meal that Kennedy caught sight of him.  Kennedy had come down town to visit the local photographer, to whom he  had entrusted a fortnight before the pleasant task of taking his  photograph. As he had heard nothing from him since, he was now coming  to investigate. He entered the High Street as Wren was turning into  the confectioner's, saw him, and made a note of it for future  reference.    When Wren returned to the house just before lock-up, he sought counsel  of Walton.    \"I say,\" he said, as he handed over the honey he had saved so neatly  from destruction, \"what would you do? Just as I was coming out of the  shop, I barged into Fenn. He must have twigged me.\"    \"Didn't he say anything?\"    \"Not a word. I couldn't make it out, because he must have seen me. We  weren't a yard away from one another.\"    \"It's dark in the shop,\" suggested Walton.    \"Not at the door; which is where we met.\"    Before Walton could find anything to say in reply to this, their  conversation was interrupted by Spencer.    \"Kennedy wants you, Wren,\" said Spencer. \"You'd better buck up; he's  in an awful wax.\"    Next to Walton, the vindictive Spencer objected most to Wren, and he  did not attempt to conceal the pleasure he felt in being the bearer of  this ominous summons.    The group broke up. Wren went disconsolately upstairs to Kennedy's  study; Walton smacked Spencer's head--more as a matter of form than  because he had done anything special to annoy him--and retired to the  senior dayroom; while Spencer, muttering darkly to himself, avoided a  second smack and took cover in the junior room, where he consoled  himself by toasting a piece of india-rubber in the gas till it made  the atmosphere painful to breathe in, and recalling with pleasure the  condition Walton's face had been in for the day or two following his  encounter with Kennedy in the dormitory.    Kennedy was working when Wren knocked at his door.    He had not much time to spare on a bounds-breaking fag; and his manner  was curt.    \"I saw you going into Rose's, in the High Street, this afternoon,  Wren,\" he said, looking up from his Greek prose. \"I didn't give you  leave. Come up here after prayers tonight. Shut the door.\"    Wren went down to consult Walton again. His attitude with regard to a  licking from the head of the house was much like that of the other  fags. Custom had, to a certain extent, inured him to these painful  interviews, but still, if it was possible, he preferred to keep out of  them. Under Fenn's rule he had often found a tolerably thin excuse  serve his need. Fenn had so many other things to do that he was not  unwilling to forego an occasional licking, if the excuse was good  enough. And he never took the trouble to find out whether the  ingenious stories Wren was wont to serve up to him were true or not.  Kennedy, Wren reflected uncomfortably, had given signs that this  easy-going method would not do for him. Still, it might be possible to  hunt up some story that would meet the case. Walton had a gift in that  direction.    \"He says I'm to go to his study after prayers,\" reported Wren. \"Can't  you think of any excuse that would do?\"    \"Can't understand Fenn running you in,\" said Walton. \"I thought he  never spoke to Kennedy.\"    Wren explained.    \"It wasn't Fenn who ran me in. Kennedy was down town, too, and twigged  me going into Rose's. I went there and had tea after I got your things  at the grocer's.\"    \"Oh, he spotted you himself, did he?\" said Walton. \"And he doesn't  know Fenn saw you?\"    \"I don't think so.\"    \"Then I've got a ripping idea. When he has you up tonight, swear that  you got leave from Fenn to go down town.\"    \"But he'll ask him.\"    \"The odds are that he won't. He and Fenn had a row at the beginning of  term, and never speak to one another if they can help it. It's ten to  one that he will prefer taking your yarn to going and asking Fenn if  it's true or not. Then he's bound to let you off.\"    Wren admitted that the scheme was sound.    At the conclusion of prayers, therefore, he went up again to Kennedy's  study, with a more hopeful air than he had worn on his previous visit.    \"Come in,\" said Kennedy, reaching for the swagger-stick which he was  accustomed to use at these ceremonies.    \"Please, Kennedy,\" said Wren, glibly. \"I did get leave to go down town  this afternoon.\"    \"What!\"    Wren repeated the assertion.    \"Who gave you leave?\"    \"Fenn.\"    The thing did not seem to be working properly. When he said the word  \"Fenn\", Wren expected to see Kennedy retire baffled, conscious that  there was nothing more to be said or done. Instead of this, the remark  appeared to infuriate him.    \"It's just like your beastly cheek,\" he said, glaring at the  red-headed delinquent, \"to ask Fenn for leave instead of me. You know  perfectly well that only the head of the house can give leave to go  down town. I don't know how often you and the rest of the junior  dayroom have played this game, but it's going to stop now. You'd  better remember another time when you want to go to Rose's that I've  got to be consulted first.\"    With which he proceeded to ensure to the best of his ability that the  memory of Master Wren should not again prove treacherous in this  respect.    \"How did it work?\" asked Walton, when Wren returned.    \"It didn't,\" said Wren, briefly.    Walton expressed an opinion that Kennedy was a cad; which, however  sound in itself, did little to improve the condition of Wren.    Having disposed of Wren, Kennedy sat down seriously to consider this  new development of a difficult situation. Hitherto he had imagined  Fenn to be merely a sort of passive resister who confined himself to  the Achilles-in-his-tent business, and was only a nuisance because he  refused to back him up. To find him actually aiding and abetting the  house in its opposition to its head was something of a shock. And yet,  if he had given Wren leave to go down town, he had probably done the  same kind office by others. It irritated Kennedy more than the most  overt act of enmity would have done. It was not good form. It was  hitting below the belt. There was, of course, the chance that Wren's  story had not been true. But he did not build much on that. He did not  yet know his Wren well, and believed that such an audacious lie would  be beyond the daring of a fag. But it would be worth while to make  inquiries. He went down the passage to Fenn's study. Fenn, however,  had gone to bed, so he resolved to approach him on the subject next  day. There was no hurry.    He went to his dormitory, feeling very bitter towards Fenn, and  rehearsing home truths with which to confound him on the morrow.          XX    JIMMY THE PEACEMAKER      In these hustling times it is not always easy to get ten minutes'  conversation with an acquaintance in private. There was drill in the  dinner hour next day for the corps, to which Kennedy had to go  directly after lunch. It did not end till afternoon school began. When  afternoon school was over, he had to turn out and practise scrummaging  with the first fifteen, in view of an important school match which was  coming off on the following Saturday. Kennedy had not yet received his  cap, but he was playing regularly for the first fifteen, and was  generally looked upon as a certainty for one of the last places in the  team. Fenn, being a three-quarter, had not to participate in this  practice. While the forwards were scrummaging on the second fifteen  ground, the outsides ran and passed on the first fifteen ground over  at the other end of the field. Fenn's training for the day finished  earlier than Kennedy's, the captain of the Eckleton fifteen, who led  the scrum, not being satisfied with the way in which the forwards  wheeled. He kept them for a quarter of an hour after the outsides had  done their day'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6879"],[0,"The Gold Bat (#20)"],[1,"deleterious, and, indeed,  absolutely fatal.\"    Trevor was not at all sure how the headmaster would take it. But Clowes  had seemed so cut up at his suggestion that it had better be omitted,  that he had allowed it to stand.    He was putting the final polish on this gem of English literature at  half-past five, when Milton came in.    \"Busy?\" said Milton.    Trevor said he would be through in a minute.    Milton took a chair, and waited.    Trevor scratched out two words and substituted two others, made a  couple of picturesque blots, and, laying down his pen, announced that  he had finished.    \"What's up?\" he said.    \"It's about the League,\" said Milton.    \"Found out anything?\"    \"Not anything much. But I've been making inquiries. You remember I  asked you to let me look at those letters of yours?\"    Trevor nodded. This had happened on the Sunday of that week.    \"Well, I wanted to look at the post-marks.\"    \"By Jove, I never thought of that.\"    Milton continued with the business-like air of the detective who  explains in the last chapter of the book how he did it.    \"I found, as I thought, that both letters came from the same place.\"    Trevor pulled out the letters in question.  \"So they do,\" he said,  \"Chesterton.\"    \"Do you know Chesterton?\" asked Milton.    \"Only by name.\"    \"It's a small hamlet about two miles from here across the downs.  There's only one shop in the place, which acts as post-office and  tobacconist and everything else. I thought that if I went there and  asked about those letters, they might remember who it was that sent  them, if I showed them a photograph.\"    \"By Jove,\" said Trevor, \"of course! Did you? What happened?\"    \"I went there yesterday afternoon. I took about half-a-dozen  photographs of various chaps, including Rand-Brown.\"    \"But wait a bit. If Chesterton's two miles off, Rand-Brown couldn't  have sent the letters. He wouldn't have the time after school. He was  on the grounds both the afternoons before I got the letters.\"    \"I know,\" said Milton; \"I didn't think of that at the time.\"    \"Well?\"    \"One of the points about the Chesterton post-office is that there's no  letter-box outside. You have to go into the shop and hand anything you  want to post across the counter. I thought this was a tremendous score  for me. I thought they would be bound to remember who handed in the  letters. There can't be many at a place like that.\"    \"Did they remember?\"    \"They remembered the letters being given in distinctly, but as for  knowing anything beyond that, they were simply futile. There was an  old woman in the shop, aged about three hundred and ten, I should  think. I shouldn't say she had ever been very intelligent, but now  she simply gibbered. I started off by laying out a shilling on some  poisonous-looking sweets. I gave the lot to a village kid when I got  out. I hope they didn't kill him. Then, having scattered ground-bait  in that way, I lugged out the photographs, mentioned the letters and  the date they had been sent, and asked her to weigh in and identify  the sender.\"    \"Did she?\"    \"My dear chap, she identified them all, one after the other. The first  was one of Clowes. She was prepared to swear on oath that that was the  chap who had sent the letters. Then I shot a photograph of you across  the counter, and doubts began to creep in. She said she was certain it  was one of those two 'la-ads', but couldn't quite say which. To keep  her amused I fired in photograph number three--Allardyce's. She  identified that, too. At the end of ten minutes she was pretty sure  that it was one of the six--the other three were Paget, Clephane, and  Rand-Brown--but she was not going to bind herself down to any  particular one. As I had come to the end of my stock of photographs,  and was getting a bit sick of the game, I got up to go, when in came  another ornament of Chesterton from a room at the back of the shop. He  was quite a kid, not more than a hundred and fifty at the outside, so,  as a last chance, I tackled him on the subject. He looked at the  photographs for about half an hour, mumbling something about it not  being 'thiccy 'un' or 'that 'un', or 'that 'ere tother 'un', until I  began to feel I'd had enough of it. Then it came out that the real chap  who had sent the letters was a 'la-ad' with light hair, not so big as  me--\"    \"That doesn't help us much,\" said Trevor.    \"--And a 'prarper little gennlemun'. So all we've got to do is to look  for some young duke of polished manners and exterior, with a thatch of  light hair.\"    \"There are three hundred and sixty-seven fellows with light hair in the  school,\" said Trevor, calmly.    \"Thought it was three hundred and sixty-eight myself,\" said Milton,  \"but I may be wrong. Anyhow, there you have the results of my  investigations. If you can make anything out of them, you're welcome to  it. Good-bye.\"    \"Half a second,\" said Trevor, as he got up; \"had the fellow a cap of  any sort?\"    \"No. Bareheaded. You wouldn't expect him to give himself away by  wearing a house-cap?\"    Trevor went over to the headmaster's revolving this discovery in his  mind. It was not much of a clue, but the smallest clue is better than  nothing. To find out that the sender of the League letters had fair hair  narrowed the search down a little. It cleared the more raven-locked  members of the school, at any rate. Besides, by combining his information  with Milton's, the search might be still further narrowed down. He knew  that the polite letter-writer must be either in Seymour's or in  Donaldson's. The number of fair-haired youths in the two houses was  not excessive. Indeed, at the moment he could not recall any; which  rather complicated matters.    He arrived at the headmaster's door, and knocked. He was shown into a  room at the side of the hall, near the door. The butler informed him  that the headmaster was engaged at present. Trevor, who knew the butler  slightly through having constantly been to see the headmaster on  business _via_ the front door, asked who was there.    \"Sir Eustace Briggs,\" said the butler, and disappeared in the direction  of his lair beyond the green baize partition at the end of the hall.    Trevor went into the room, which was a sort of spare study, and sat  down, wondering what had brought the mayor of Wrykyn to see the  headmaster at this advanced hour.    A quarter of an hour later the sound of voices broke in upon his peace.  The headmaster was coming down the hall with the intention of showing  his visitor out. The door of Trevor's room was ajar, and he could hear  distinctly what was being said. He had no particular desire to play the  eavesdropper, but the part was forced upon him.    Sir Eustace seemed excited.    \"It is far from being my habit,\" he was saying, \"to make unnecessary  complaints respecting the conduct of the lads under your care.\" (Sir  Eustace Briggs had a distaste for the shorter and more colloquial forms  of speech. He would have perished sooner than have substituted  \"complain of your boys\" for the majestic formula he had used. He spoke  as if he enjoyed choosing his words. He seemed to pause and think  before each word. Unkind people--who were jealous of his distinguished  career--used to say that he did this because he was afraid of dropping  an aitch if he relaxed his vigilance.)    \"But,\" continued he, \"I am reluctantly forced to the unpleasant  conclusion that the dastardly outrage to which both I and the Press of  the town have called your attention is to be attributed to one of the  lads to whom I 'ave--_have_ (this with a jerk) referred.\"    \"I will make a thorough inquiry, Sir Eustace,\" said the bass voice of  the headmaster.    \"I thank you,\" said the mayor. \"It would, under the circumstances, be  nothing more, I think, than what is distinctly advisable. The man  Samuel Wapshott, of whose narrative I have recently afforded you a  brief synopsis, stated in no uncertain terms that he found at the foot  of the statue on which the dastardly outrage was perpetrated a  diminutive ornament, in shape like the bats that are used in the game  of cricket. This ornament, he avers (with what truth I know not), was  handed by him to a youth of an age coeval with that of the lads in the  upper division of this school. The youth claimed it as his property, I  was given to understand.\"    \"A thorough inquiry shall be made, Sir Eustace.\"    \"I thank you.\"    And then the door shut, and the conversation ceased.          XX    THE FINDING OF THE BAT      Trevor waited till the headmaster had gone back to his library, gave  him five minutes to settle down, and then went in.    The headmaster looked up inquiringly.    \"My essay, sir,\" said Trevor.    \"Ah, yes. I had forgotten.\"    Trevor opened the notebook and began to read what he had written. He  finished the paragraph which owed its insertion to Clowes, and raced  hurriedly on to the next. To his surprise the flippancy passed  unnoticed, at any rate, verbally. As a rule the headmaster preferred  that quotations from back numbers of _Punch_ should be kept out of  the prefects' English Essays. And he generally said as much. But today  he seemed strangely preoccupied. A split infinitive in paragraph five,  which at other times would have made him sit up in his chair stiff with  horror, elicited no remark. The same immunity was accorded to the  insertion (inspired by Clowes, as usual) of a popular catch phrase in  the last few lines. Trevor finished with the feeling that luck had  favoured him nobly.    \"Yes,\" said the headmaster, seemingly roused by the silence following  on the conclusion of the essay. \"Yes.\" Then, after a long pause, \"Yes,\"  again.    Trevor said nothing, but waited for further comment.    \"Yes,\" said the headmaster once more, \"I think that is a very  fair essay. Very fair. It wants a little more--er--not quite so  much--um--yes.\"    Trevor made a note in his mind to effect these improvements"]]]
