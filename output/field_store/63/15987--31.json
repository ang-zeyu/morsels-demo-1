Phronsie stood a moment quite still  where he left her, then she ran up to him and slipped her hand within  his.    \"Oh, I do so wish I might,\" she said, \"there's so much for a little girl  like me. It would be so nice to have Charlotte have some with me.\"    Still no answer. So Phronsie went up and down silently by his side for a  few more turns. Then she spoke again. \"Does it make you sorry, Grandpapa  dear, to have me want Charlotte to have the money with me?\" she asked  timidly.    \"No, no, child,\" answered Mr. King hastily, \"and yet I don't know what  to say. I don't feel that it would be right for you to give any of your  money to her.\"    \"Right?\" cried Phronsie, opening her brown eyes very wide. \"Why, isn't  the money my very own, Grandpapa?\"    \"Yes, yes, of course; but you are too young to judge of such things,\"  said the old gentleman decidedly, \"as the giving away of property and  all that.\"    \"Oh, Grandpapa!\" exclaimed Phronsie, in gentle reproach, and standing  very tall. \"Why, I am thirteen.\"    \"And when you get to be ten years older, you might blame me,\" said Mr.  King, \"and I can't say but what you'd have reason if I let you do such a  thing as to give away any money to Charlotte.\"    \"Blame you? Why, Grandpapa, I couldn't.\" Phronsie drew a long breath,  then threw herself convulsively into his arms, her face working hard in  her efforts not to cry. But it was no use, and Mr. King caught her in  time to see the quick drops roll down Phronsie's cheek and to feel them  fall on his hand.    \"Oh, dear me!\" he cried in great distress, \"there, there, child, you  shall give away the whole if you wish; I've enough for you without  it--only don't cry, Phronsie. You may do anything you like, dear.  There,\" mopping up her wet little face with his handkerchief, \"now  that's a good child; Phronsie, you are not going to cry, of course not.  There, do smile a bit; that's my girl now,\" as a faint light stole into  Phronsie's eyes. \"I didn't mean you'd really blame me, only\"--    \"I couldn't,\" still said Phronsie, and it looked as if the shower were  about to fall again.    \"I know, child; you think your old Grandpapa does just about right,\"  said Mr. King soothingly, and highly gratified.    \"He's ever and always right,\" said Phronsie, still not moving.    \"Bless you, child,\" cried the old gentleman, much moved, \"I wish I could  say I believed what you say. But many things in my life might have been  bettered.\"    \"Oh, no, Grandpapa,\" protested Phronsie in a tone of horror, \"they  couldn't have been better. Don't, Grandpapa, don't!\" she caught him  around the neck imploringly.    \"Well, I won't, child,\" promised Mr. King, holding her close. \"And now,  Phronsie, I'll tell you; I'll think of all this that you and I have  talked over, and I'll let you know by and by what you ought to do about  it, and you mustn't say anything about it to anybody, not to a single  soul, child. It shall be just a secret between you and me.\"    \"I won't, Grandpapa,\" said Phronsie obediently, and patting his broad  back with her soft hand.    \"And, meantime,\" said Mr. King, quite satisfied, \"why, Charlotte is  having pretty good times, I think. Polly is looking out for that.\"    \"Polly is making her have beautiful times,\" said Phronsie happily, \"oh,  very beautiful times indeed, Grandpapa.\"    \"I expect she's an awful nuisance,\" the old gentleman broke out  suddenly.    \"Oh, Grandpapa!\" exclaimed Phronsie, breaking away from him to look into  his face.    \"Well, well, perhaps I shouldn't say quite that,\" said Mr. King,  correcting himself. \"But, well, now, Phronsie, you run back to your  play, child, and I'll set to work at once to think out this matter.\"    \"I was writing a note to Mrs. Fargo,\" said Phronsie, putting up her lips  for a kiss. \"You are sure you won't make your head ache thinking about  it, Grandpapa?\" she asked anxiously.    \"Sure as I can be, Phronsie,\" said old Mr. King, smiling. \"Good-by,  dear.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"See here, Pickering,\" Mr. Cabot threw wide the door of his private  office with a nervous hand. \"It is time I had a good talk with you. Come  in; I never get one nowadays.\"    \"Can't stop, Uncle,\" said Pickering hastily. \"Besides, what would be the  use, you never see anything encouraging about me or my career. And I  believe I am going to the dogs.\"    \"Indeed you are not, Pickering,\" cried Mr. Cabot quickly, the color  rising to his cheek. \"There, there, my sister's boy shall never say  that. But come in, come in.\" He laid hold of Pickering's arm and gently  forced him into the little room.    Not to be ungracious, the young man threw himself into a chair. \"Well,  what is it, Uncle? Do out with it; I'm in no mood for a lecture, though,  this morning.\"    \"I'm not going to lecture you, my boy,\" said Mr. Cabot, closing the  door, then going to the mantel to lean one elbow on it, a favorite  attitude of his, while he scanned his nephew. \"But something worse than  common has come to you. Can I help in any way?\"    \"No, no, don't ask me,\" ejaculated Pickering, striking his knee with one  glove, and turning apprehensively in his chair. \"Oh, hang it, Uncle, why  can't you let me alone?\"    \"I've seen this thing, whatever it is, coming upon you for sometime,\"  said Mr. Cabot, too nervous to notice the entreaty in Pickering's voice  and manner, \"and I cannot wait any longer to find out the trouble. It's  my right, Pickering; you have no father to see to you, and I've always  wanted to have the best success be yours.\" He turned away his head now,  a break coming in his voice.    [Illustration: \"I'M NOT GOING TO LECTURE YOU.\"]    \"You have, Uncle, you have,\" assented Pickering, brought out a trifle  from his distress, \"but then I'm not equal to the strain my relatives  put upon me. Not worth it, either,\" he added, relapsing into his gloom.  Then he shoved his chair so that he could not look his uncle in the  face, and bent a steady glance out of the window.    Mr. Cabot gave a nervous start that carried him away from the mantel a  step or two. But when he was there, he felt so much worse, that he soon  got back into the old position.    \"I don't see, Pickering,\" he resumed, \"why you shouldn't get along.  You're through college.\"    \"Which is a wonder,\" interpolated Pickering.    \"Well, I can't say but that I was a good deal disturbed at one time,\"  said Mr. Cabot frankly; \"but never mind that now, you are through,\" and  he heaved a sigh of relief, \"and nicely established with Van Metre and  Cartwright. It's the best law firm in the town, Pickering.\" Mr. Cabot  brought his elbow off from the mantel enough to smite his palms together  smartly in enthusiasm. \"I got you in there.\"    \"I know you did, Uncle,\" said Pickering; \"you've done everything that's  good. Only I repeat I'm not worth it,\" and he drummed on the chair-arm.    \"For Heaven's sake, Pickering!\" cried his uncle, darting in front of the  chair and its restless occupant, \"don't say that again. It's enough to  make a man go to the bad, to lose hope. What have you been doing lately?  Do you gamble?\"    \"What do you take me for?\" demanded Pickering, starting to his feet with  flashing eyes, and throwing open his top-coat as if the weight oppressed  him. \"I've been a lazy dog all my life, and a good-for-naught; but I  hope I've not sunk to that.\"    \"Oh, nothing, nothing--I'm sure I didn't mean,\" cried Mr. Cabot,  starting back suddenly in astonishment. \"Dear me, Pickering,\" taking off  his eyeglasses to blow his nose, \"you needn't pick me up so violently.  I've been much worried about you,\" settling his glasses again for  another look at his nephew. \"And I can't tolerate any thoughts I cannot  speak.\"    \"I should think not,\" retorted Pickering shortly; \"the trouble is in  having the thoughts.\"    \"And I am very much relieved to find that my fears  are groundless--that you've been about nothing that my sister or I  should be ashamed of,\" and he picked up courage to step forward gingerly  and pat the young man on the shoulder. \"You are in trouble, though, and  I insist on knowing what it is.\"    Pickering dropped suddenly beneath his uncle's hand, into the nearest  chair.          CHAPTER XI.    THINGS ARE GETTING MIXED.      \"How can you ask me, Uncle?\" cried Pickering passionately.    \"Because I will know.\" Mr. Cabot was quite determined.    \"Well, then, if you must have it, it's--it's Polly Pepper.\" Pickering  could get no further.    \"It's Polly Pepper!\" ejaculated Mr. Cabot. Then a light broke over his  face, and he laughed aloud, he was so pleased. \"You mean, you are in  love with Polly Pepper?\"    \"As if everybody didn't know it?\" cried Pickering hotly. \"Don't pretend,  Uncle, that you are surprised;\" he was really disrespectful now in  manner. \"Oh, beg pardon, sir,\" recovering himself.    \"Never mind,\" said Mr. Cabot indulgently, \"you are over-wrought this  morning. My boy,\" and he came over and clapped his nephew on the back  approvingly, \"that's the best thing you ever told me; you make me very  happy, and\"--    \"Hold, Uncle,\" cried Pickering, darting away from the hand, \"don't go so  fast. You are taking too much for granted.\"    Mr. Cabot for answer, bestowed another rap, this time on Pickering's  arm, indulging all the while in the broadest of smiles.    Just then some one knocked at the door, and in response to Mr. Cabot's  unwilling \"Come in,\" Ben's head appeared. \"Beg pardon, Mr. Cabot, but  Mr. Van Metre wants you out here.\"    Pickering lunged past Ben. \"Don't stop me,\" he cried crossly, in  response to Ben's \"Well, old fellow.\"    Ben stared after him with puzzled eyes as he shot down the long store;  and all that afternoon he could not get Pickering and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7499"],[0,"Through Five Republics on Horseback, Being an Account of Many Wanderings in (#20)"],[1,"plague had broken out farther down the country, steamboats  were at a standstill, so we had to wait a passage down the river.  Piedra Blanca is an interesting little spot. One evening a tired mule  brought in the postman from the next town, Holy Joseph. He had been  eight days on the journey. Another evening a string of dusty mules  arrived, bringing loads of rubber and cocoa. They had been five months  on the way.    When the Chiquitana women go down to the bay for water, with their  pitchers poised on their heads, the sight is very picturesque.  Sometimes a little boy will step into one of the giant, traylike leaves  of the Victoria Regia, which, thus transformed into a fairy boat, he  will paddle about the quiet bay.    The village is built on the edge of the virgin forest, where the red  man, with his stone hatchet, wanders in wild freedom. It contains,  perhaps, a hundred inhabitants, chiefly civilized Chiquitanos Indians.  There is here a customs house, and a regular trade in rubber, which is  brought in from the interior on mule-back, a journey which often takes  from three to four months.    One evening during our stay two men were forcibly brought into the  village, having been caught in the act of killing a cow which they had  stolen. These men were immediately thrown into the prison, a small,  dark, palm-built hut. Next morning, ere the sun arose, their feet were  thrust into the stocks, and a man armed with a long hide whip thrashed  them until the blood flowed in streamlets down their bare backs! What  struck us as being delicately thoughtful was that while the whipping  proceeded another official tried his best to drown their piercing  shrieks by blowing an old trumpet at its highest pitch!    The women, although boasting only one loose white garment, walk with  the air and grace of queens, or as though pure Inca blood ran in their  veins. Their only adornment is a necklace of red corals and a few  inches of red or blue ribbon entwined in their long raven-black hair,  which hangs down to the waist in two plaits. Their houses are  palm-walled, with a roof of palm-leaves, through which the rain pours  and the sun shines. Their chairs are logs of wood, and their beds are  string hammocks. Their wants are few, as there are no electric-lighted  store windows to tempt them. Let us leave them in their primitive  simplicity. Their little, delicately-shaped feet are prettier without  shoes and stockings, and their plaited hair without Parisian hats and  European tinsel. They neither read nor write, and therefore cannot  discuss politics. Women's rights they have never heard of. Their  bright-eyed, naked little children play in the mud or dust round the  house, and the sun turns their already bronze-colored bodies into a  darker tint; but the Chiquitana woman has never seen a white baby, and  knows nothing of its beauty, so is more than satisfied with her own.  The Indian child does not suffer from teething, for all have a small  wooden image tied round the neck, and the little one, because of this,  is supposed to be saved from all baby ailments! Their husbands and sons  leave them for months while they go into the interior for rubber or  cocoa, and when one comes back, riding on his bullock or mule, he is  affectionately but silently received. The Chiquitano seldom speaks, and  in this respect he is utterly unlike the Brazilian. The women differ  from our mothers and sisters and wives, for they (the Chiquitanas) have  nothing to say. After all, ours are best, and a headache is often  preferable to companioning with the dumb. I unhesitatingly say, give me  the music, even if I have to suffer the consequences.    The waiting-time was employed by our hunter in his favorite sport. One  day he shot a huge alligator which was disporting itself in the water  some five hundred yards from the shore. Taking a strong rope, we went  out in an Indian dug-out to tow it to land. As my friend was the more  dexterous in the use of the paddle, he managed the canoe, and I, with  much difficulty, fixed the rope by a noose to the monster's tail. When  the towing, however, commenced, the beast seemed to regain his life. He  dived and struggled for freedom until the water was lashed into foam.  He thrust his mighty head out of the water and opened his jaws as  though warning us he could crush the frail dug-out with one snap. Being  anxious to obtain his hide, and momentarily expecting his death, for he  was mortally wounded, I held on to the rope with grim persistency. He  dived under the boat and lifted it high, but as his ugly nose came out  on the other side the canoe regained its position in the water. He then  commenced to tow us, but, refusing to obey the helm, took us to all  points of the compass. After an exciting cruise the alligator gave a  deep dive and the rope broke, giving him his liberty again. On leaving  us he gave what Waterton describes as \"a long-suppressed, shuddering  sigh, so loud and so peculiar that it can be heard a mile.\" The bullet  had entered the alligator's head, but next morning we saw he was still  alive and able to \"paddle his own canoe.\" The reader may be surprised  to learn that these repulsive reptiles lay an egg with a pure white  shell, fair to look upon, and that the egg is no larger than a hen's.    One day I was called to see a dead man for whom a kind of wake was  being held. He was lying in state in a grass-built hovel, and raised up  from the mud floor on two packing-cases of suspiciously British origin.  His hard Indian face was softened in death, but the observant eye could  trace a stoical resignation in the features. Several men and women were  sitting around the corpse counting their beads and drinking native  spirits, with a dim, hazy belief that that was the right thing to do.  They had given up their own heathen customs, and, being civilized,  must, of course, be Roman Catholics. They were \"reduced,\" as Holy  Mother Church calls it, long ago, and, of course, believe that  civilization and Roman Catholicism are synonymous terms. Poor souls!  How they stared and wondered when they that morning heard for the first  time the story of Jesus, who tasted death for us that we might live. To  those in the home lands this is an old story, but do they who preach it  or listen to it realize that to millions it is still the newest thing  under the sun?    Next day the man was quietly carried away to the little forest clearing  reserved for the departed, where a few wooden crosses lift their heads  among the tangled growth. Some of these crosses have four rudely carved  letters on them, which you decipher as I. N. R. I. The Indian cannot  tell you their meaning, but he knows they have something to do with his  new religion.    As far as I could ascertain, the departed had no relatives. One after  another had been taken from him, and now he had gone, for \"when he is  forsaken, withered and shaken, what can an old man do but die?\"--it is  the end of all flesh. Poor man! Had he been able to retain even a spark  of life until Holy Week, he might then have been saved from purgatory.  Rome teaches that on two days in the year--Holy Thursday and Corpus  Christi--the gates of heaven are unguarded, because, they say, _God is  dead_. All people who die on those days go straight to heaven, however  bad they may have been! At no other time is that gate open, and every  soul must pass through the torments of purgatory.    A missionary in Oruru wrote: \"The Thursday and Friday of so-called Holy  Week, when Christ's image lay in a coffin and was carried through the  streets, _God being dead_, was the time for robberies, and some one  came to steal from us, but only got about fifty dollars' worth of  building material. Holy Week terminates with the 'Saturday of Glory,'  when spirits are drunk till there is not a dram left in the  drink-shops, which frequently bear such names as 'The Saviour of the  World,' 'The Grace of God,' 'The Fountain of Our Lady,' etc. The poor  deluded Romanists have a holiday on that day over the tragic end of  Judas. A life-size representation of the betrayer is suspended high in  the air in front of the cafes. At ten a.m. the church bells begin to  ring, and this is the signal for lighting the fuse. Then, with a flash  and a bang, every vestige of the effigy has disappeared! At night, if  the town is large enough to afford a theatre, the crowds wend their way  thither. This place of very questionable amusement will often bear the  high-sounding name, _Theatre of the Holy Ghost!_\"    There is no church or priest in the village of Piedra Blanca. Down on  the beach there is a church bell, which the visitor concludes is a  start in that direction, but he is told that it is destined for the  town of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, three hundred miles inland. The bell  was a present to the church by some pious devotee, but the money  donated did not provide for its removal inland. This cost the priests  refuse to pay, and the Chiquitanos equally refuse to transport it free.  There is no resident priest to make them, so there it stays. In the  meantime the bell is slung up on three poles. It was solemnly beaten  with a stick on Christmas Eve to commemorate the time when the \"Mother  of Heaven\" gave birth to her child Jesus. In one of the principal  houses of the village the scene was most vividly reproduced. A small  arbor was screened off by palm leaves, in which were hung little  colored candles. Angels of paper were suspended from the roof, that  they might appear to be bending over the Virgin, which was a  highly-colored fashion-plate cut from a Parisian journal that somehow  had found its way there. The child Jesus appeared to be a Mellin's  Food-fed infant. Round this fairy scene the youth and beauty of the  place danced and drank liberal potations of chicha, the Bolivian  spirits, until far on into morning, when all retired to their hammocks  to dream of their goddess and"]]]
