Philology discovered, at last, that the Sanskrit language is,  if not the forefather, at least--to use the language of Max Muller--\"the  elder brother\" of all classical languages. Thanks to the extraordinary  zeal of Alexander Csoma de Koros, Tibet yielded a language the  literature of which was totally unknown. He partly translated it and  partly analyzed and explained it. His translations have shown the  scientific world that (1) the originals of the Zend-Avesta, the sacred  scriptures of the sun-worshippers, of Tripitaka, that of the Buddhists,  and of Aytareya-Brahmanam, that of the Brahmans, were written in one and  the same Sanskrit language; (2) that all these three languages--Zend,  Nepalese, and the modern Brahman Sanskrit--are more or less dialects of  the first; (3) that old Sanskrit is the origin of all the less ancient  Indo-European languages, as well as of the modern European  tongues and dialects; (4) that the three chief religions of  heathendom--Zoroastrianism, Buddhism and Brahmanism--are mere heresies  of the monotheistic teachings of the Vedas, which does not prevent them  from being real ancient religions and not modern falsifications.    The moral of all this is evident. A poor traveler, without either money  or protection, succeeded in gaining admittance to the Lamaseries of  Tibet and to the sacred literature of the isolated tribe which inhabits  it, probably because he treated the Mongolians and the Tibetans as  his brothers and not as an inferior race--a feat which has never been  accomplished by generations of scientists. One cannot help feeling  ashamed of humanity and science when one thinks that he whose labors  first gave to science such precious results, he who was the first sower  of such an abundant harvest, remained, almost until the day of his  death, a poor and obscure worker. On his way from Tibet he walked to  Calcutta without a penny in his pocket. At last Csoma de Koros became  known, and his name began to be pronounced with honor and praise whilst  he was dying in one of the poorest parts of Calcutta. Being already very  ill, he wanted to get back to Tibet, and started on foot again through  Sikkhim. He succumbed to his illness on the road and was buried in  Darhjeeling.    It is needless to say we are fully aware that what we have undertaken is  simply impossible within the limits of ordinary newspaper articles.  All we hope to accomplish is to lay the foundation stone of an edifice,  whose further progress must be entrusted to future generations. In order  to combat successfully the theories worked out by two generations of  Orientalists, half a century of diligent labor would be required. And,  in order to replace these theories with new ones, we must get new facts,  facts founded not on the chronology and false evidence of scheming  Brahmans, whose interest is to feed the ignorance of European  Sanskritists (as, unfortunately, was the experience of Lieutenant  Wilford and Louis Jacolliot), but on indubitable proofs that are to  be found in inscriptions as yet undeciphered. The clue to these  inscriptions Europeans do not possess, because, as I have already  stated, it is guarded in MSS. which are as old as the inscriptions and  which are almost out of reach. Even in case our hopes are realized and  we obtain this clue, a new difficulty will arise before us. We shall  have to begin a systematic refutation, page by page, of many a volume  of hypotheses published by the Royal Asiatic Society. A work like  this might be accomplished by dozens of tireless, never-resting  Sanskritists--a class which, even in India, is almost as rare as white  elephants.    Thanks to private contributions and the zeal of some educated Hindu  patriots, two free classes of Sanskrit and Pali had already been  opened--one in Bombay by the Theosophical Society, the other in Benares  under the presidency of the learned Rama-Misra-Shastri. In the present  year, 1882, the Theosophical Society has, altogether, fourteen schools  in Ceylon and India.    Our heads full of thoughts and plans of this kind, we, that is to say,  one American, three Europeans, and three natives, occupied a whole  carriage of the Great Indian Peninsular Railroad on our way to Nassik,  one of the oldest towns in India, as I have already mentioned, and  the most sacred of all in the eyes of the inhabitants of the Western  Presidency. Nassik borrowed its name from the Sanskrit word \"Nasika,\"  which means nose. An epic legend assures us that on this very spot  Lakshman, the eldest brother of the deified King Rama, cut off the nose  of the giantess Sarpnaka, sister of Ravana, who stole Sita, the \"Helen  of Troy\" of the Hindus.    The train stops six miles from the town, so that we had to finish our  journey in six two-wheeled, gilded chariots, called ekkas, and drawn by  bullocks. It was one o'clock A.M., but, in spite of the darkness of the  hour, the horns of the animals were gilded and adorned with flowers,  and brass bangles tinkled on their legs. Our waylay through ravines  overgrown with jungle, where, as our drivers hastened to inform  us, tigers and other four-footed misanthropes of the forest played  hide-and-seek. However, we had no opportunity of making the acquaintance  of the tigers, but enjoyed instead a concert of a whole community of  jackals. They followed us step by step, piercing our ears with shrieks,  wild laughter and barking. These animals are annoying, but so cowardly  that, though numerous enough to devour, not only all of us, but our  gold-horned bullocks too, none of them dared to come nearer than the  distance of a few steps. Every time the long whip, our weapon against  snakes, alighted on the back of one of them, the whole horde disappeared  with unimaginable noise. Nevertheless, the drivers did not dispense with  a single one of their superstitious precautions against tigers. They  chanted mantrams in unison, spread betel over the road as a token of  their respect to the Rajas of the forest, and, after every couplet,  made the bullocks kneel and bow their heads in honor of the great gods.  Needless to say, the ekka, as light as a nutshell, threatened each time  to fall with its passenger over the horns of the bullocks. We had to  endure this agreeable way of traveling for five hours under a very dark  sky. We reached the Inn of the Pilgrims in the morning at about six  o'clock.    The real cause of Nassik's sacredness, however, is not the mutilated  trunk of the giantess, but the situation of the town on the banks of  the Godavari, quite close to the sources of this river which, for some  reason or other, are called by the natives Ganga (Ganges). It is to  this magic name, probably, that the town owes its numerous magnificent  temples, and the selectness of the Brahmans who inhabit the banks of  the river. Twice a year pilgrims flock here to pray, and on these solemn  occasions the number of the visitors exceeds that of the inhabitants,  which is only 35,000. Very picturesque, but equally dirty, are the  houses of the rich Brahmans built on both sides of the way from the  centre of the town to the Godavari. A whole forest of narrow pyramidal  temples spreads on both sides of the river. All these new pagodas  are built on the ruins of those destroyed by the fanaticism of the  Mussulmans. A legend informs us that most of them rose from the ashes  of the tail of the monkey god Hanuman. Retreating from Lanka, where  the wicked Ravana, having anointed the brave hero's tail with some  combustible stuff set it on fire, Hanuman, with a single leap through  the air, reached Nassik, his fatherland. And here the noble adornment  of the monkey's back, burned almost entirely during the voyage, crumbled  into ashes, and from every sacred atom of these ashes, fallen to  the ground, there rose a temple.... And, indeed, when seen from  the mountain, these numberless pagodas, scattered in a most curious  disorderly way, look as if they had really been thrown down by handfuls  from the sky. Not only the river banks and the surrounding country, but  every little island, every rock peeping from the water is covered  with temples. And not one of them is destitute of a legend of its  own, different versions of which are told by every individual of the  Brahmanical community according to his own taste--of course in the hope  of a suitable reward.    Here, as everywhere else in India, Brahmans are divided into two  sects--worshippers of Shiva and worshippers of Vishnu--and between the  two there is rivalry and warfare centuries old. Though the neighborhood  of the Godavari shines with a twofold fame derived from its being the  birthplace of Hanuman and the theatre of the first great deeds of Rama,  the incarnation of Vishnu, it possesses as many temples dedicated to  Shiva as to Vishnu. The material of which the pagodas consecrated to  Shiva are constructed is black basalt. And it is, exactly, the color  of the material which is the apple of discord in this case. The black  material is claimed by the Vaishnavas as their own, it being of the  same color as the burned tail of Rama's ally. They try to prove that  the Shivaites have no right to it. From the first days of their rule  the English inherited endless lawsuits between the fighting sectarians,  cases decided in one law-court only to be transferred on appeal to  another, and always having their origin in this ill-omened tail and its  pretensions. This tail is a mysterious deus ex machina that directs all  the thoughts of the Nassik Brahmans pro and contra.    On the subject of this tail were written more reams of paper and  petitions than in the quarrel about the goose between Ivan Ivanitch and  Ivan Nikiphoritch; and more ink and bile were spilt than there was mud  in Mirgorod, since the creation of the universe. The pig that so happily  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6702"],[0,"Life of Harriet Beecher Stowe (#20)"],[1,"of Mrs. Stowe's third daughter was followed by a protracted  illness and a struggle with great poverty, of which Mrs. Stowe writes  in October, 1843:--    \"Our straits for money this year are unparalleled even in our annals.  Even our bright and cheery neighbor Allen begins to look blue, and  says $600 is the very most we can hope to collect of our salary,  once $1,200. We have a flock of entirely destitute young men in the  seminary, as poor in money as they are rich in mental and spiritual  resources. They promise to be as fine a band as those we have just sent  off. We have two from Iowa and Wisconsin who were actually crowded from  secular pursuits into the ministry by the wants of the people about  them. Revivals began, and the people came to them saying, 'We have no  minister, and you must preach to us, for you know more than we do.'\"    In the spring of 1844 Professor Stowe visited the East to arouse  an interest in the struggling seminary and raise funds for its  maintenance. While he was there he received the following letter from  Mrs. Stowe:--    \"I am already half sick with confinement to the house and overwork.  If I should sew every day for a month to come I should not be able to  accomplish a half of what is to be done, and should be only more unfit  for my other duties.\"    This struggle against ill-health and poverty was continued through  that year and well into the next, when, during her husband's absence to  attend a ministerial convention at Detroit, Mrs. Stowe writes to him:--                                            _June 16, 1845._        MY DEAR HUSBAND,--It is a dark, sloppy, rainy, muddy,      disagreeable day, and I have been working hard (for      me) all day in the kitchen, washing dishes, looking      into closets, and seeing a great deal of that dark      side of domestic life which a housekeeper may who will      investigate too curiously into minutiae in warm, damp      weather, especially after a girl who keeps all clean      on the _outside_ of cup and platter, and is very apt      to make good the rest of the text in the _inside_ of      things.        I am sick of the smell of sour milk, and sour meat, and      sour everything, and then the clothes _will_ not dry,      and no wet thing does, and everything smells mouldy;      and altogether I feel as if I never wanted to eat again.        Your letter, which was neither sour nor mouldy, formed      a very agreeable contrast to all these things; the      more so for being unexpected. I am much obliged to      you for it. As to my health, it gives me very little      solicitude, although I am bad enough and daily growing      worse. I feel no life, no energy, no appetite, or      rather a growing distaste for food; in fact, I am      becoming quite ethereal. Upon reflection I perceive      that it pleases my Father to keep me in the fire,      for my whole situation is excessively harassing and      painful. I suffer with sensible distress in the brain,      as I have done more or less since my sickness last      winter, a distress which some days takes from me all      power of planning or executing anything; and you know      that, except this poor head, my unfortunate household      has no mainspring, for nobody feels any kind of      responsibility to do a thing in time, place, or manner,      except as I oversee it.        Georgiana is so excessively weak, nervous, cross, and      fretful, night and day, that she takes all Anna's      strength and time with her; and then the children are,      like other little sons and daughters of Adam, full of      all kinds of absurdity and folly.        When the brain gives out, as mine often does, and one      cannot think or remember anything, then what is to be      done? All common fatigue, sickness, and exhaustion is      nothing to this distress. Yet do I rejoice in my God      and know in whom I believe, and only pray that the      fire may consume the dross; as to the gold, that is      imperishable. No real evil can happen to me, so I fear      nothing for the future, and only suffer in the present      tense.        God, the mighty God, is mine, of that I am sure, and I      know He knows that though flesh and heart fail, I am      all the while desiring and trying for his will alone.      As to a journey, I need not ask a physician to see that      it is needful to me as far as health is concerned, that      is to say, all human appearances are that way, but I      feel no particular choice about it. If God wills I      go. He can easily find means. Money, I suppose, is as      plenty with Him now as it always has been, and if He      sees it is really best He will doubtless help me.    That the necessary funds were provided is evident from the fact that  the journey was undertaken and the invalid spent the summer of 1845 in  Hartford, in Natick, and in Boston. She was not, however, permanently  benefited by the change, and in the following spring it was deemed  necessary to take more radical measures to arrest the progress of her  increasing debility. After many consultations and much correspondence  it was finally decided that she should go to Dr. Wesselhoeft's  watercure establishment at Brattleboro', Vt.    At this time, under date of March, 1846, she writes:    \"For all I have had trouble I can think of nothing but the greatness  and richness of God's mercy to me in giving me such friends, and in  always caring for us in every strait. There has been no day this winter  when I have not had abundant reason to see this. Some friend has always  stepped in to cheer and help, so that I have wanted for nothing. My  husband has developed wonderfully as house-father and nurse. You would  laugh to see him in his spectacles gravely marching the little troop in  their nightgowns up to bed, tagging after them, as he says, like an old  hen after a flock of ducks. The money for my journey has been sent in  from an unknown hand in a wonderful manner. All this shows the care of  our Father, and encourages me to rejoice and to hope in Him.\"    A few days after her departure Professor Stowe wrote to his wife:--    \"I was greatly comforted by your brief letter from Pittsburgh. When  I returned from the steamer the morning you left I found in the  post-office a letter from Mrs. G. W. Bull of New York, inclosing $50 on  account of the sickness in my family. There was another inclosing $50  more from a Mrs. Devereaux of Raleigh, N. C., besides some smaller sums  from others. My heart went out to God in aspiration and gratitude.  None of the donors, so far as I know, have I ever seen or heard of  before.    \"Henry and I have been living in a Robinson Crusoe and man Friday sort  of style, greatly to our satisfaction, ever since you went away.\"    Mrs. Stowe was accompanied to Brattleboro' by her sisters, Catherine  and Mary, who were also suffering from troubles that they felt might be  relieved by hydropathic treatment.    From May, 1846, until March, 1847, she remained at Brattleboro' without  seeing her husband or children. During these weary months her happiest  days were those upon which she received letters from home.    The following extracts, taken from letters written by her during this  period, are of value, as revealing what it is possible to know of her  habits of thought and mode of life at this time.                             BRATTLEBORO', _September, 1846._        MY DEAR HUSBAND,--I have been thinking of all your      trials, and I really pity you in having such a wife. I      feel as if I had been only a hindrance to you instead      of a help, and most earnestly and daily do I pray to      God to restore my health that I may do something for      you and my family. I think if I were only at home I      could at least sweep and dust, and wash potatoes, and      cook a little, and talk some to my children, and should      be doing something for my family. But the hope of      getting better buoys me up. I go through these tedious      and wearisome baths and bear that terrible douche      thinking of my children. They never will know how I      love them....        There is great truth and good sense in your analysis      of the cause of our past failures. We have now come      to a sort of crisis. If you and I do as we should for      _five years_ to come the character of our three oldest      children will be established. This is why I am willing      to spend so much time and make such efforts to have      health. Oh, that God would give me these five years in      full possession of mind and body, that I may train my      children as they should be trained. I am fully aware      of the importance of system and order in a family. I      know that nothing can be done without it; it is the      keystone, the _sine qua non_, and in regard to my      children I place it next to piety. At the same time it      is true that both Anna[4] and I labor under serious      natural disadvantages on this subject. It is not all      that is necessary to feel the importance of order and      system, but it requires a particular kind of talent to      carry it through a family. Very much the same kind of      talent, as Uncle Samuel said, which is necessary to      make a good prime minister....        I think you might make an excellent sermon to      Christians on the care of health, in consideration      of the various infirmities and impediments to the      developing the results of religion, that result from      bodily ill health, and I wish you would make one that      your own mind may be more vividly impressed with it.      The world is too much in a hurry. Ministers think there      is no way to serve Christ but to overdraw on their      physical capital for four or five years for Christ and      then have nothing to give, but become a mere burden on      his hands for the next five....          _November 18._ \"The daily course I go through      presupposes a degree"]]]
