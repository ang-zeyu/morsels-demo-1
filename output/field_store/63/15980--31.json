One  thought went through the chaos of his brain at the time.  He wondered  if he had fallen because he had been shot.  But the suspicion flew away  at once.  He did not think more of it.    He had taken up a first position behind the little tree, with a direct  determination to hold it against the world.  He had not deemed it  possible that his army could that day succeed, and from this he felt  the ability to fight harder.  But the throng had surged in all ways,  until he lost directions and locations, save that he knew where lay the  enemy.    The flames bit him, and the hot smoke broiled his skin.  His rifle  barrel grew so hot that ordinarily he could not have borne it upon his  palms; but he kept on stuffing cartridges into it, and pounding them  with his clanking, bending ramrod.  If he aimed at some changing form  through the smoke, he pulled the trigger with a fierce grunt, as if he  were dealing a blow of the fist with all his strength.    When the enemy seemed falling back before him and his fellows, he went  instantly forward, like a dog who, seeing his foes lagging, turns and  insists upon being pursued.  And when he was compelled to retire again,  he did it slowly, sullenly, taking steps of wrathful despair.    Once he, in his intent hate, was almost alone, and was firing, when all  those near him had ceased.  He was so engrossed in his occupation that  he was not aware of a lull.    He was recalled by a hoarse laugh and a sentence that came to his ears  in a voice of contempt and amazement.  \"Yeh infernal fool, don't yeh  know enough t' quit when there ain't anything t' shoot at?  Good Gawd!\"    He turned then and, pausing with his rifle thrown half into position,  looked at the blue line of his comrades.  During this moment of leisure  they seemed all to be engaged in staring with astonishment at him.  They had become spectators.  Turning to the front again he saw, under  the lifted smoke, a deserted ground.    He looked bewildered for a moment.  Then there appeared upon the glazed  vacancy of his eyes a diamond point of intelligence.  \"Oh,\" he said,  comprehending.    He returned to his comrades and threw himself upon the ground.  He  sprawled like a man who had been thrashed.  His flesh seemed strangely  on fire, and the sounds of the battle continued in his ears.  He groped  blindly for his canteen.    The lieutenant was crowing.  He seemed drunk with fighting.  He called  out to the youth:  \"By heavens, if I had ten thousand wild cats like  you I could tear th' stomach outa this war in less'n a week!\" He puffed  out his chest with large dignity as he said it.    Some of the men muttered and looked at the youth in awestruck ways.  It  was plain that as he had gone on loading and firing and cursing without  proper intermission, they had found time to regard him.  And they now  looked upon him as a war devil.    The friend came staggering to him.  There was some fright and dismay in  his voice.  \"Are yeh all right, Fleming?  Do yeh feel all right?  There  ain't nothin' th' matter with yeh, Henry, is there?\"    \"No,\" said the youth with difficulty.  His throat seemed full of knobs  and burrs.    These incidents made the youth ponder.  It was revealed to him that he  had been a barbarian, a beast.  He had fought like a pagan who defends  his religion.  Regarding it, he saw that it was fine, wild, and, in  some ways, easy.  He had been a tremendous figure, no doubt.  By this  struggle he had overcome obstacles which he had admitted to be  mountains.  They had fallen like paper peaks, and he was now what he  called a hero.  And he had not been aware of the process.  He had  slept, and, awakening, found himself a knight.    He lay and basked in the occasional stares of his comrades.  Their  faces were varied in degrees of blackness from the burned powder.  Some  were utterly smudged.  They were reeking with perspiration, and their  breaths came hard and wheezing.  And from these soiled expanses they  peered at him.    \"Hot work!  Hot work!\" cried the lieutenant deliriously.  He walked up  and down, restless and eager.  Sometimes his voice could be heard in a  wild, incomprehensible laugh.    When he had a particularly profound thought upon the science of war he  always unconsciously addressed himself to the youth.    There was some grim rejoicing by the men.  \"By thunder, I bet this  army'll never see another new reg'ment like us!\"    \"You bet!\"        \"A dog, a woman, an' a walnut tree    Th' more yeh beat 'em, th' better they be!      That's like us.\"    \"Lost a piler men, they did.  If an ol' woman swep' up th' woods she'd  git a dustpanful.\"    \"Yes, an' if she'll come around ag'in in 'bout an hour she'll get a  pile more.\"    The forest still bore its burden of clamor.  From off under the trees  came the rolling clatter of the musketry.  Each distant thicket seemed  a strange porcupine with quills of flame.  A cloud of dark smoke, as  from smoldering ruins, went up toward the sun now bright and gay in the  blue, enameled sky.          Chapter 18      The ragged line had respite for some minutes, but during its pause the  struggle in the forest became magnified until the trees seemed to  quiver from the firing and the ground to shake from the rushing of men.  The voices of the cannon were mingled in a long and interminable row.  It seemed difficult to live in such an atmosphere.  The chests of the  men strained for a bit of freshness, and their throats craved water.    There was one shot through the body, who raised a cry of bitter  lamentation when came this lull.  Perhaps he had been calling out  during the fighting also, but at that time no one had heard him.  But  now the men turned at the woeful complaints of him upon the ground.    \"Who is it?  Who is it?\"    \"Its Jimmie Rogers.  Jimmie Rogers.\"    When their eyes first encountered him there was a sudden halt, as if  they feared to go near.  He was thrashing about in the grass, twisting  his shuddering body into many strange postures.  He was screaming  loudly.  This instant's hesitation seemed to fill him with a  tremendous, fantastic contempt, and he damned them in shrieked  sentences.    The youth's friend had a geographical illusion concerning a stream, and  he obtained permission to go for some water.  Immediately canteens were  showered upon him.  \"Fill mine, will yeh?\"  \"Bring me some, too.\" \"And  me, too.\"  He departed, ladened.  The youth went with his friend,  feeling a desire to throw his heated body into the stream and, soaking  there, drink quarts.    They made a hurried search for the supposed stream, but did not find  it.  \"No water here,\" said the youth.  They turned without delay and  began to retrace their steps.    From their position as they again faced toward the place of the  fighting, they could comprehend a greater amount of the battle than  when their visions had been blurred by the hurling smoke of the line.  They could see dark stretches winding along the land, and on one  cleared space there was a row of guns making gray clouds, which were  filled with large flashes of orange-colored flame.  Over some foliage  they could see the roof of a house.  One window, glowing a deep murder  red, shone squarely through the leaves.  From the edifice a tall  leaning tower of smoke went far into the sky.    Looking over their own troops, they saw mixed masses slowly getting  into regular form.  The sunlight made twinkling points of the bright  steel.  To the rear there was a glimpse of a distant roadway as it  curved over a slope.  It was crowded with retreating infantry.  From  all the interwoven forest arose the smoke and bluster of the battle.  The air was always occupied by a blaring.    Near where they stood shells were flip-flapping and hooting.  Occasional bullets buzzed in the air and spanged into tree trunks.  Wounded men and other stragglers were slinking through the woods.    Looking down an aisle of the grove, the youth and his companion saw a  jangling general and his staff almost ride upon a wounded man, who was  crawling on his hands and knees.  The general reined strongly at his  charger's opened and foamy mouth and guided it with dexterous  horsemanship past the man.  The latter scrambled in wild and torturing  haste.  His strength evidently failed him as he reached a place of  safety.  One of his arms suddenly weakened, and he fell, sliding over  upon his back.  He lay stretched out, breathing gently.    A moment later the small, creaking cavalcade was directly in front of  the two soldiers.  Another officer, riding with the skillful abandon of  a cowboy, galloped his horse to a position directly before the general.  The two unnoticed foot soldiers made a little show of going on, but  they lingered near in the desire to overhear the conversation.  Perhaps, they thought, some great inner historical things would be said.    The general, whom the boys knew as the commander of their division,  looked at the other officer and spoke coolly, as if he were criticising  his clothes.  \"Th' enemy's formin' over there for another charge,\" he  said.  \"It'll be directed against Whiterside, an' I fear they'll break  through unless we work like thunder t' stop them.\"    The other swore at his restive horse, and then cleared his throat.  He  made a gesture toward his cap.  \"It'll be hell t' pay stoppin' them,\"  he said shortly.    \"I presume so,\" remarked the general.  Then he began to talk rapidly  and in a lower tone.  He frequently illustrated his words with a  pointing finger.  The two infantrymen could hear nothing until finally  he asked:  \"What troops can you spare?\"    The officer who rode like a cowboy reflected for an instant.  \"Well,\"  he said, \"I had to order in th' 12th to help th' 76th, an' I haven't  really got any.  But there's th' 304th.  They fight like a lot 'a mule  drivers.  I can spare them best of any.\"    The youth and his friend exchanged glances"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7300"],[0,"Woman and the Republic (#20)"],[1,"of a new heaven on an old earth, established his foul community at Oneida.  There and then the Millerite madness sent whole congregations into the  cemeteries, in white gowns, to await the sounding of the trump of Gabriel.  There and then arose the great spiritualistic movement that began in Wayne  County with the Fox family, became famous as the Rochester Knockings, and  blossomed into communities in which \"Free Love\" grew out of \"Individual  Sovereignty.\" Then and there, in Wayne County, Joseph Smith pretended that  the Angel Maroni had shown him, the Book of Mormon. Many of these  movements were in sympathy with Woman Suffrage, and workers in them early  found their way into its ranks.    In the midst of the Anti-slavery excitement, secret temperance  organizations were formed among the women in New York State, known as the  \"Daughters of Temperance.\" \"Finding,\" as they said, \"that there was no law  nor gospel in the land,\" they became a law unto themselves, and visited  saloons, where they broke windows, glasses, and bottles, and threw kegs  and barrels of liquor into the streets. A few were arrested, but they were  soon discharged. As time went on, these secret organizations began to form  themselves into regular bodies, and in January, 1852, they assembled their  delegates at Albany to claim admission to the State Temperance  organization, with no invitation or authority but their own. Susan B.  Anthony was the first speaker, and when the convention decided not to hear  her, it was announced that they would withdraw and hold a meeting where  \"men and women would be equal,\" which they accordingly did. The movement  continued, until, three months later, Miss Anthony called \"The New York  State Temperance Convention,\" of which Mrs. Stanton was elected President.  Among the resolutions that she introduced in her opening speech, were  these: that \"no woman remain in the relation of wife to a confirmed  drunkard;\" that the State should be petitioned so to \"modify its laws  affecting marriage and the custody of children, that the drunkard shall  have no claims on either wife or child;\" that \"no liquor should be used  for culinary purposes;\" and that \"as charity begins at home, let us  withdraw from all associations for sending the gospel to the heathen  across the ocean, for the education of young men for the ministry, for the  building up of a theological aristocracy and gorgeous temples to the  unknown God, and devote ourselves to the poor and suffering about us. Let  us feed and clothe the naked and hungry, gather children into schools, and  provide reading-rooms and decent homes for young men and women thrown  alone upon the world.\" The organization of \"The Woman's New York State  Temperance Society\" was formed, and Mrs. Stanton was elected its  President. She issued an appeal to the women of the State, and sent a  letter to the Convention at Albany which \"was so radical, that its friends  feared to read it,\" but Susan B. Anthony finally did so. They elected as  delegates to the \"Men's New York State Temperance Convention,\" to be held  in Syracuse in June, Susan B. Anthony, Mrs. Amelia Bloomer, and Gerrit  Smith. When they arrived they were met by the Rev. Samuel J. May, who told  them that the men were shocked at the idea of admitting them, and said  that he was commissioned to beg them to withdraw. They decided to present  their credentials, and of course the stormy scene which they had invited  followed their action. This scene was repeated in every part of the State,  the agitators figuring upon their own platforms as martyrs to the noble  causes of Anti-slavery, Temperance, and Woman's Rights. A single quotation  from a letter of Miss Anthony's, written at this time to the league, shows  that then, as now, the radical woman workers for Prohibition were nothing  if not political. She says: \"And it is for woman now, in the present  presidential campaign, to say to her father, husband, or brother, 'If you  vote for any candidate for any office whatever, who is not pledged to  total abstinence and the Maine law, we shall hold you alike guilty with  the rum-seller.'\"    In January, 1853, a great mass-meeting was held in Albany of all the State  temperance organizations. The Woman's society met in a Baptist church,  which was crowded at every session. Miss Anthony presided. Twenty-eight  thousand women had signed petitions for prohibitory legislation. The rules  of the House were suspended, and the women were invited to present them at  the speaker's desk. They were then invited to New York, and, in  Metropolitan Hall, addressed a large audience, as well as in the Broadway  Tabernacle and Knickerbocker Hall, Brooklyn. In the next two months they  made successful tours of many cities of the State. But, like Mr. Garrison,  and Stephen Foster, and H. C. Wright, the women thought that if they were  not attacking and being attacked there could be no \"progress\" or \"reform.\"  They demanded divorce for drunkenness, they denounced wine at private  tables, and called on the women to leave all church organizations where  \"clergymen and bishops, liquor-dealers, and wine-bibbers, were dignified  and honored as deacons and elders.\" They denounced the church for its  \"apathy,\" and the clergy for their \"hostility to the public action of  women,\" and they soon began to turn the kindly feeling that was  endeavoring to work with them into enmity, and were of course denounced in  their turn.    The Society decided to invite men into their organization, but not to  allow them to hold office or to vote. This they did for a year, after  which men were admitted to full membership. The first annual meeting of  the Woman's State Temperance Society was held in Rochester, June 1, 1853,  Mrs. Stanton presiding, and the attendance was larger than they had had at  any time. In the course of the meetings a heated debate on the subject of  divorce took place. Mrs. Stanton and Lucy Stone took the ground that it  was \"not only woman's right, but her duty, to withdraw from all such  unholy relations,\" and Mrs. Nichols and Antoinette Brown opposed them.    The men were admitted to this convention, and, to use the words of the  women, \"it was the policy of these worldly-wise men to restrict the debate  on Temperance to such narrow limits as to disturb none of the existing  conditions of society.\" This farce in reform soon came to an end, and the  following is the epitaph pronounced over it by its founders: \"The society,  with its guns silenced on the popular foes, lingered a year or two, and  was heard of no more.\" On May 12, the friends of Temperance met in Dr.  Spring's Old Brick Church, New York City. A motion was made that all  gentlemen present be admitted as delegates. Dr. Trall, of New York, moved  an amendment, that the words \"and ladies\" be added, as there were  delegates present from the \"Woman's State Temperance Society.\" The motion  was carried, and the credentials were received. A motion was then made  that Susan B. Anthony be added to the business committee, and all was in  an uproar at once. \"Mayor Barstow twice asked that another chairman be  appointed, as he would not preside over a meeting where woman's rights was  introduced, or women were allowed to speak.\" Some of the gentlemen present  said that \"the ladies were there expressly to disturb.\" The ministers  present, like the laymen, were divided in opinion in regard to the  admission of the delegates; but the credentials were withdrawn, and in due  time the bearers of them withdrew also. The writers of the \"History\" say:  \"Most of the liberal men and women now withdrew from all temperance  organizations, leaving the movement in the hands of time-serving priests  and politicians, who, being in the majority, effectually blocked the  progress of the reform for the time--destroying, as they did, the  enthusiasm of the women in trying to press it as a political measure.\"  Comparing this work with their Anti-slavery campaign, they say: \"When  Garrison's forces had been thoroughly sifted, and only the picked men and  women remained, he soon made political parties and church organizations  feel the power of his burning words.\" It was the men and women from whom  he and his were sifted who spoke the burning words that ended in burning  deeds for the extinction of slavery; and thus it was with Temperance.  There remained after the \"sifting\" many societies, of one of which William  E. Dodge and President Mark Hopkins were chief officers, and John B. Gough  was principal orator.    The writers of the \"History\" further say, in regard to the death of their  organization: \"Henceforward women took no active part in temperance until  the Ohio Crusade revived them all over the nation, and gathered the  scattered forces into the Woman's National Christian Temperance Union, of  which Frances E. Willard is President.\" This is a mistake, for women were  very active in connection with Temperance societies of which men were  officers, and in organizations of their own, before and after the W. C. T.  U. was founded. The history of that great body furnishes another proof of  the injurious effect of the Suffrage movement upon the cause of  Temperance. In 1872 a political Temperance party was formed in Columbus,  Ohio, which, four years later, at Cleveland, became the Prohibition Party.  From the first, this party inserted a plank in its platform favoring  universal suffrage, and mentioning especially the extension of suffrage to  women. The W. C. T. U. was founded as a non-denominational and non-  partisan body, and was divided and sub-divided into committees, each  having charge of a distinct branch of philanthropic work, which was by no  means confined solely to Temperance measures. This has given the body  great working strength, and its efforts are well known. Everything except  its Suffrage labor has had rich reward.
