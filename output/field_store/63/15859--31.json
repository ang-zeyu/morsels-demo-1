Roberts, wounded; Lieutenant C. G. Lyall, unwounded.         At Kaalboschfontein: Royal Scots Greys--Captain C. J. Mitchell,       severely wounded.    Owing to the disaster at Nitral's Nek, it now became evident that all the  British movements within the capital were reported to the Boers--that, in  fact, they had organised an elaborate intelligence department, some of  their spies attending the markets as innocent farmers, while others  figured in khaki in the guise of British officers. Steps were taken to  identify _soi-disant_ soldiers attempting to pass through the lines, and  to clear out the natives who, either from fear or for pecuniary  advantage, were assisting in the transmission of information. Things in  Johannesburg were no better. It needed all the acumen of Colonel  Mackenzie, Director of Military Intelligence, to cope with the  duplicities of the rogues and vagabonds of all nationalities that spent  their time in hatching conspiracies. Three hundred and eighty of these  were put in prison, while their respective Consuls were communicated with  and held responsible for their good behaviour. In the course of these  proceedings the whole of a dramatic plot came to light, and the following  despatch, concisely describing the nature of the conspiracy, was  forwarded by Lord Roberts to the Secretary of State for War:--         \"The police and the Military Governor received information       that, on the 14th July, the anniversary of the taking of       Bastille, an attempt would be made to overpower garrison and       murder British officers.         \"A race meeting was to take place on that day, and it was       assumed that a large proportion of officers would attend it       unarmed.         \"Bolder spirits among plotters were to go to the races armed,       and murder officers, while an ostensibly French national       gathering was to be the rallying point for the low class who       were to murder all the police, and then take possession of the       Government Offices, &c.         \"A Boer commander at Zwart Kop, to the north of the town, was       in direct communication with the plotters.         \"By the 13th July the police were in possession of sufficient       evidence to justify numerous arrests, which were accordingly       carried out during the night of 13th to 14th.         \"At noon, 14th July, the Consuls of Germany, France, Sweden,       and America, of which nations some subjects had been arrested,       met the Commissioner of Police and discussed the question.         \"Each Consul concerned was furnished with a statement of the       facts of the case.         \"The interview passed off most satisfactorily, and the Consuls       expressed entire concurrence with action taken, and promised to       render every assistance.         \"Between four hundred and five hundred arrests were made, but       of these seventy-five were subsequently released on being       vouched for by their respective Consuls.\"    The rest were deported, and none too soon, as will be seen.    On the 16th a new brigade, consisting of the Border Regiment, the King's  Own Scottish Borderers, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and the  Berkshires, under Colonel Cunningham, together with Colonel Hickman's  force of 1800 Mounted Infantry, various details, an Elswick battery, and  a Canadian battery attached to Colonel Cunningham's force, the whole  under General Ian Hamilton, was despatched to clear out the Boers from a  chain of hills on the north and north-west, in which they were  congregating. But their discretion prompted them, on receiving  information of the movement, to evacuate their position, and General  Hamilton moved unchallenged to Watervall, and from thence, on the 17th,  to Hamanskraal. Thus far the sweeping back of the northern portion of  the Boer crescent was satisfactorily accomplished, and the Boers were  forced towards their original position in the east, where Lord Roberts  eventually intended to drive them before him.    The fact was the Dutchmen, having found the right flank well guarded on  the 16th, had made a ferocious lunge at the left of General Pole-Carew's  position, and simultaneously all along the left. A tremendous day's  fighting followed, during which the posts held by the Royal Irish  Fusiliers, under Major Munn, the New Zealanders under Captain Vaughan,  the Canadians under Colonel Alderson, were defended with amazing valour  and persistence. So many officers distinguished themselves that it was  almost impossible to record their names. Colonel Clowes, who temporarily  commanded the 1st Cavalry Brigade on the extreme right of the line, was  commended by the Chief for his handling of his men. The gallantry of  Captain Barnes (R. A.), Major Hill, Lieutenants Knight and Hughes, Royal  Irish Fusiliers, was especially remarkable, the Irish officers having  defended their post against an onslaught at so close quarters that it was  possible to hear the raucous shouts of the enemy inviting the Fusiliers  to surrender! Heroic qualities were also displayed by two young Canadian  officers, Lieutenants Borden and Birch, 1st Canadian Mounted Rifles, who  were killed while leading their men in a counter-attack on the enemy's  flank at a critical juncture of the attack on the position. The loss of  young Borden was especially deplored. A soldier to the marrow, he had  been twice mentioned in despatches \"for gallant and intrepid conduct.\" He  was the only son of the Canadian Minister of Militia, and was popular as  he was plucky. Among the wounded were Lieutenant C. Battye, Shropshire  Light Infantry; Civil Surgeon J. C. Willes, who was detained by the  Boers; Lieutenant J. Findlay, New Zealand Mounted Rifles; Captain Bourn  and Lieutenant J. Cameron, New Zealand Contingent (third), were missing.  Of the rank and file five men were killed (one Shropshire Light Infantry,  and four Royal Irish Fusiliers), twenty-six wounded and twenty-one  missing.    General Ian Hamilton and Colonel Mahon from Hamanskraal continued to  march eastward over country that was full of ruggedness, presenting  obstacles at every turn. The enemy, however, offered no opposition. Their  destination was Eerstefabrieken Station, where they joined hands with  General Pole-Carew's Division.    [Illustration: MAP ILLUSTRATING THE EASTWARD MOVE FROM EERSTEFABRIEKEN TO  MIDDELBURG.]    Lord Roberts now decided to advance, with a view to pushing back the  enemy, taking possession of the line to the Portuguese frontier, and  occupying the towns fringing thereon, thus diminishing the Boer  resources, breaking up their commandos, and reducing them rather to  guerilla bands than organised armies. The move was fraught with  difficulties, for every step gained implied so much loss to the bulk of  the main army, every point of the railway demanded its special guard--the  result being that, large as was Lord Roberts's force in theory, in action  it was daily thinning to an almost attenuated degree. It was impossible  to remain stationary, however. In the advance the same principles were  adopted as in the march from Bloemfontein to Pretoria, only now, while  General Pole-Carew continued to proceed along the railway, Generals  French and Hutton were to co-operate on his _right_, and General Ian  Hamilton to form the _left_ wing, and menace such Boers as hoped to  retreat to the north.    [Illustration: ALGOA BAY AND PORT ELIZABETH, FROM THE LIGHTHOUSE    Photo by Wilson, Aberdeen]    On the 23rd General Ian Hamilton took possession of Doornkraal (while  General Stephenson's Brigade occupied Elands River), and proceeded due  north of Bronkhers Spruit, thus so completely threatening the enemy's  line of retreat that they were forced to abandon the strong position  which they had hitherto been holding in face of General Pole-Carew's  Division. It was possible now to make an appreciable advance to the east.  The right was protected by the 1st and 4th Brigades of Cavalry (French)  and Hutton's Mounted Infantry, the former crossing to east of Wilge  River. There they came upon a huge body of the enemy, and succeeded in  driving them still farther back, and in taking many prisoners. One  officer, Lieutenant Ebsworth, 1st Australian Horse, was mortally wounded  during the encounter. The Boers, seeing the trend of affairs, quickly  scudded towards Lydenburg, whither Mr. Kruger was said to be travelling.  A certain number of the burly gang remained ensconced in the bush veldt,  where they hoped a few bridges might yet be destroyable, and unguarded  gaps of the line would offer invitation for the exercise of mischievous  ingenuity. Neither their position nor that of their hunters was to be  envied, for the rainy season had set in with roar and rampage, the wind,  blowing through the poorts that clave the ridges with which the landscape  was studded, roared like a giant through a fog-horn. At night the  freezing atmosphere nipped nose, toes, and eyelids, rain deluged, and  converted the whole surroundings into a vast universe of slime, till the  duties of the camp had to be executed in a series of ploughings and  plungings which were exhausting to man and beast.    On the 24th the Boers engaged French's Cavalry and Hutton's Mounted  Infantry about six miles south of Balmoral. Alderson's Mounted Infantry  attacked their right, while French made a wide turning movement to their  left, which proved entirely discomfiting, for the enemy rapidly \"broke  and fled,\" followed by both forces. One officer, Lieutenant Wilson of the  Imperial Yeomanry, was wounded.    On the 25th Generals French and Hutton continued their pursuit of the  Dutchmen, and the former, having crossed Olifant's River, could view,  from the east bank, the enemy about seven miles off retiring in disorder  towards Middelburg.

Sick, or hurt?\"    Philip laughed as the little man hopped to the stove and began rubbing  his hands.    \"Hurt,\" he said. \"If you weren't four hundred miles from nowhere I'd say  that you were a doctor.\"    \"So I am,\" said the other. \"Edward Wallace Boffin, M.D., 900 North  Wabash Avenue, Chicago.\"        Chapter XIII. The Great Love Experiment    For a full half minute after the other's words Philip stared in  astonishment. Then, with a joyful shout, he suddenly reached out his  hand across the stove.    \"By thunder,\" he cried, \"you're from home!\"    \"Home!\" exclaimed the other. There was a startled note in his voice.  \"You're--you're a Chicago man?\" he asked, staring strangely at Philip  and gripping his hand at the same time.    \"Ever hear of Steele--Philip Egbert Steele? I'm his son.\"    \"Good Heavens!\" drawled the doctor, gazing still harder at him and  pinching the ice from his beard, \"what are you doing up here?\"    \"Prodigal son,\" grinned Philip. \"Waiting for the calf to get good and  fat. What are you doing?\"    \"Making a fool of myself,\" replied the doctor, looking at the top of the  stove and rubbing his hands until his fingers snapped.    At the North Pole, if they had met there, Philip would have known him  for a professional man. His heavy woolen suit was tailor made. He wore a  collar and a fashionable tie. A lodge signet dangled at his watch  chain. He was clean-shaven and his blond Van Dyke beard was immaculately  trimmed. Everything about him, from the top of his head to the bottom of  his laced boots, shouted profession, even in the Arctic snow. He might  have gone farther and guessed that he was a physician--a surgeon,  perhaps--from his hands, and from the supple manner in which he twisted  his long white fingers about one another over the stove. He was a man  of about forty, with a thin sensitive face, strong rather than handsome,  and remarkable eyes. They were not large, nor far apart, but were like  twin dynamos, reflecting the life of the man within. They were the sort  of eyes which Philip had always associated with great mental power.    The doctor had now finished rubbing his hands, and, unbuttoning his  under coat, he drew a small silver cigarette case from his waistcoat  pocket.    \"They're not poison,\" he smiled, opening it and offering the cigarettes  to Philip. \"I have them made especially for myself.\" A sound outside the  door made him pause with a lighted match between his fingers. \"How about  dogs and Indian?\" he asked. \"May they come in?\"    Philip began hobbling toward the door.    \"So exciting to meet a man from home that I forgot all about 'em,\" he  exclaimed.    With three or four quick steps the doctor overtook him and caught him by  the arm.    \"Just a moment,\" he said quickly. \"How far is Fort Smith from here?\"    \"About sixty miles.\"    \"Do you suppose I could get there without--his assistance?\"    \"If you're willing to bunk here for a few days--yes,\" said Philip. \"I'm  going on to Fort Smith myself as soon as I am able to walk.\"    An expression of deep relief came into the doctor's eyes.    \"That's just what I want, Steele,\" he exclaimed, unfeignedly delighted  at Philip's suggestion. \"I'm not well, and I require a little rest. Call  him in.\"    No sooner had the Indian entered than to Philip's astonishment the  little doctor began talking rapidly to him in Cree. The guide's eyes  lighted up intelligently, and at the end he replied with a single word,  nodded, and grinned. Philip noticed that as he talked a slight flush  gathered in the doctor's smooth cheeks, and that not only by his voice  but by the use of his hands as well he seemed anxious to impress upon  his listener the importance of what he was saying.    \"He'll start back for Chippewayan this afternoon,\" he explained to  Philip a moment later. \"The dogs and sledge are mine, and he says that  he can make it easily on snow-shoes.\" Then he lighted his cigarette and  added suggestively, \"He can't understand English.\"    The Indian had caught a glimpse of Philip's belt and holster, and now  muttered a few low words, as though he were grumbling at the stove. The  doctor poised his cigarette midway to his lips and looked quickly across  at Philip.    \"Possibly you belong to the Northwest Mounted Police,\" he suggested.    \"Yes.\"    \"Heavens,\" drawled the doctor again, \"and you the son of a millionaire  banker! What you doing it for?\"    \"Fun,\" answered Philip, half laughing. \"And I'm not getting it in  sugar-coated pellet form either. Doctor. I came up here to get a  man, found him, and was gloriously walloped for my trouble. I'm not  particularly sorry, either. Rather glad he got away.\"    \"Why?\" asked the doctor.    In spite of their short acquaintance Philip began to feel a sort of  comradeship for the man opposite him.    \"Well,\" he said hesitatingly, \"you see, he was one of those criminals  who are made criminals. Some one else was responsible--a case of one man  suffering because of another man's sins.\"    If the doctor had received the thrust of a pin he could not have jumped  from his chair with more startling suddenness than he did at Philip's  words.    \"That's it!\" he cried excitedly, beginning to pace back and forth across  the cabin floor. \"It's more than a theory--it's a truth--that people  suffer more because of other people than on account of themselves.  We're born to it and we keep it up, inflicting a thousand pricks and a  thousand sorrows to gain one selfish end and it isn't once in a hundred  times that the boomerang comes home and strikes the right one down. But  when it does--when it does, sir--\"    As suddenly as he had begun, the doctor stopped, and he laughed a  little unnaturally. \"Bosh!\" he exclaimed. \"Let's see that head of yours,  Steele. Speaking of pains and pricks reminds me that, being a surgeon, I  may be of some assistance to you.\"    Philip knew that he had checked himself with an effort, and as his new  acquaintance began to loosen the bandage he found himself wondering what  mysterious mission could have sent a Chicago surgeon up to Fort Smith.  The doctor interrupted his thoughts.    \"Queer place for a blow,\" he said briskly. \"Nothing serious--slight  abrasion--trifle feverish. We'll set you to rights immediately.\" He  bustled to his greatcoat and from one of the deep pockets drew forth  a leather medicine case. \"Queer place, queer place,\" he chuckled,  returning with a vial in his hand. \"Were you running when it happened?\"    Philip laughed with him, and by the time the doctor had finished he had  given him an account of his affair with DeBar. Not until hours later,  when the Cree had left on his return trip and they sat smoking before a  roaring fire after supper, did it occur to him how confidential he had  become. Seldom had Philip met a man who impressed him as did the little  surgeon. He liked him immensely. He felt that he had known him for  years instead of hours, and chatted freely of his adventures and asked a  thousand questions about home. He found that the doctor was even better  acquainted with his home city than himself, and that he knew many people  whom he knew, and lived in a fashionable quarter. He was puzzled even  as they talked and laughed and smoked their cigarettes and pipes. The  doctor said nothing about himself or his personal affairs, and cleverly  changed the conversation whenever it threatened to drift in that  direction.    It was late when Philip rose from his chair, suggesting that they go to  bed. He laughed frankly across into the other's face.    \"Boffin--Boffin--Boffin,\" he mused.    \"Strange I've never heard of you down south, Doctor. Now what the deuce  can you be doing up here?\"    There was a point-blank challenge in his eyes. The doctor leaned a  little toward him, as if about to speak, but caught himself. For several  moments his keen eyes gazed squarely into Philip's, and when he broke  the silence the same nervous flush that Philip had noticed before rose  into his cheeks.  \"To go roughing it down in South America. I believe  you're honest--on the square.\"    Philip stared at him in amazement.    \"If I didn't,\" he went on, rubbing his hands again over the stove, \"I'd  follow your suggestion, and go to bed. As it is, I'm going to tell you  why I'm up here, on your word of honor to maintain secrecy. I've got a  selfish end in view, for you may be able to assist me. But nothing must  go beyond yourself. What do you say to the condition?\"    \"I will not break your confidence--unless you have murdered some one,\"  laughed Philip, stooping to light a fresh pipe. \"In that event you'd  better keep quiet, as I'd have to haul you back to headquarters.\"    He did not see the deepening of the flush in the other's face.    \"Good,\" said the doctor. \"Sit down, Steele. I take it for granted that  you will help me--if you can. First I suppose I ought to confess that  my name is not Boffin, but McGill--Dudley McGill, professor of neurology  and diseases of the brain--\"    Philip almost dropped his pipe. \"Great Scott, and it was you who  wrote--\" He stopped, staring in amazement.    \"Yes, it was I who wrote Freda, if that's what you refer to,\" finished  the doctor. \"It caused a little sensation, as you may know, and nearly  got me ousted from the college. But it sold up to two hundred thousand  copies, so it wasn't a bad turn,\" he added.    \"It was published while I was away,\" said Philip. \"I got a copy in Rio  Janeiro, and it haunted me for weeks after I read it. Great Heaven, you  can't believe--\"    \"I did,\" interrupted the doctor sharply. \"I believed everything that I  wrote--and more. It was my theory of life.\" He sprang from his chair and  began walking back and forth in his quick, excited way. The flush had  gone from his face now and was replaced by a strange paleness. His lips  were tense, the fingers of his hands tightly clenched, his"]]]
