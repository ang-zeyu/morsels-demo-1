Prior to my travels, the Caribs were  mentioned in many geographical works as an extinct race. Writers  unacquainted with the interior of the Spanish colonies of the  continent supposed that the small islands of Dominica, Guadaloupe, and  St. Vincent had been the principal abodes of that nation of which the  only vestiges now remaining throughout the whole of the eastern West  India Islands are skeletons petrified, or rather enveloped in a  limestone containing madrepores.* (* These skeletons were discovered  in 1805 by M. Cortez. They are encased in a formation of madrepore  breccia, which the negroes call God's masonry, and which, like the  travertin of Italy, envelops fragments of vases and other objects  created by human skill. M. Dauxion Lavaysse and Dr. Koenig first made  known in Europe this phenomenon which has greatly interested  geologists.)    The name of Caribs, which I find for the first time in a letter of  Peter Martyr d'Anghiera is derived from Calina and Caripuna, the l and  p being transferred into r and b. It is very remarkable that this  name, which Columbus heard pronounced by the people of Hayti, was  known to exist at the same time among the Caribs of the islands and  those of the continent. From the word Carina, or Calina, has been  formed Galibi (Caribi). This is the distinctive denomination of a  tribe in French Guiana,* who are of much more diminutive stature than  the inhabitants of Cari, but speaking one of the numerous dialects of  the Carib tongue. (* The Galibis (Calibitis), the Palicours, and the  Acoquouas, also cut their hair in the style of the monks; and apply  bandages to the legs of their children for the purpose of swelling the  muscles. They have the same predilection for green stones (saussurite)  which we observed among the Carib nations of the Orinoco. There exist,  besides, in French Guiana, twenty Indian tribes which are  distinguished from the Galibis though their language proves that they  have a common origin.) The inhabitants of the islands are called  Calinago in the language of the men; and in that of the women,  Callipinan. The difference in the language of the two sexes is more  striking among the people of the Carib race than among other American  nations (the Omaguas, the Guaranis, and the Chiquitos) where it  applies only to a limited number of ideas; for instance, the words  mother and child. It may be conceived that women, from their separate  way of life, frame particular terms which men do not adopt. Cicero  observes* that old forms of language are best preserved by women  because by their position in society they are less exposed to those  vicissitudes of life, changes of place and occupation which tend to  corrupt the primitive purity of language among men. (* Cicero, de  Orat. lib. 3 cap. 12 paragraph 45 ed. Verburg. Facilius enim mulieres  incorruptam antiquitatem conservant, quod multorum sermonis expertes  ea tenent semper, quae prima didicerunt.) But in the Carib nations the  contrast between the dialect of the two sexes is so great that to  explain it satisfactorily we must refer to another cause; and this may  perhaps be found in the barbarous custom, practised by those nations,  of killing their male prisoners, and carrying the wives of the  vanquished into captivity. When the Caribs made an irruption into the  archipelago of the West India Islands, they arrived there as a band of  warriors, not as colonists accompanied by their families. The language  of the female sex was formed by degrees, as the conquerors contracted  alliances with the foreign women; it was composed of new elements,  words distinct from the Carib words,* which in the interior of the  gynaeceums were transmitted from generation to generation, but on  which the structure, the combinations, the grammatical forms of the  language of the men exercised an influence. (* The following are  examples of the difference between the language of the men (m), and  the women (w); isle, oubao (m), acaera (w); man, ouekelli (m), eyeri  (w); but, irhen (m), atica (w).) There was then manifested in a small  community the peculiarity which we now find in the whole group of the  nations of the New Continent. The American languages, from Hudson's  Bay to the Straits of Magellan, are in general characterized by a  total disparity of words combined with a great analogy in their  structure. They are like different substances invested with analogous  forms. If we recollect that this phenomenon extends over one-half of  our planet, almost from pole to pole; if we consider the shades in the  grammatical forms (the genders applied to the three persons of the  verb, the reduplications, the frequentatives, the duals); it appears  highly astonishing to find a uniform tendency in the development of  intelligence and language among so considerable a portion of the human  race.    We have just seen that the dialect of the Carib women in the West  India Islands contains the vestiges of a language that was extinct.  Some writers have imagined that this extinct language might be that of  the Ygneris, or primitive inhabitants of the Caribbee Islands; others  have traced in it some resemblance to the ancient idiom of Cuba, or to  those of the Arowaks, and the Apalachites in Florida: but these  hypotheses are all founded on a very imperfect knowledge of the idioms  which it has been attempted to compare one with another.    The Spanish writers of the sixteenth century inform us that the Carib  nations then extended over eighteen or nineteen degrees of latitude,  from the Virgin Islands east of Porto Rico, to the mouths of the  Amazon. Another prolongation toward the west, along the coast-chain of  Santa Marta and Venezuela, appears less certain. Gomara, however, and  the most ancient historians, give the name of Caribana, not, as it has  since been applied, to the country between the sources of the Orinoco  and the mountains of French Guiana,* (* This name is found in the map  of Hondius, of 1599, which accompanies the Latin edition of the  narrative of Raleigh's voyage. In the Dutch edition Nieuwe Caerte van  het goudrycke landt Guiana, the Llanos of Caracas, between the  mountains of Merida and the Rio Pao, bear the name of Caribana. We may  remark here, what we observe so often in the history of geography,  that the same denomination has spread by degrees from west to east.)  but to the marshy plains between the mouths of the Rio Atrato and the  Rio Sinu. I have visited those coasts in going from the Havannah to  Porto Bello; and I there learned that the cape which bounds the gulf  of Darien or Uraba on the east, still bears the name of Punta  Caribana. An opinion heretofore prevailed pretty generally that the  Caribs of the West India Islands derived their origin, and even their  name, from these warlike people of Darien. \"From the eastern shore  springs Cape Uraba, which the natives call Caribana, whence the Caribs  of the island are said to have received their present name.\"* (* Inde  Vrabam ab orientali prehendit ora, quam appellant indigenae Caribana,  unde Caribes insulares originem habere nomenque retinere dicuntur.)  Thus Anghiera expresses himself in his Oceanica. He had been told by a  nephew of Amerigo Vespucci that thence, as far as the snowy mountains  of St. Marta, all the natives were e genere Caribium, vel Canibalium.  I do not deny that Caribs may have had a settlement near the gulf of  Darien, and that they may have been driven thither by the easterly  currents; but it also may have happened that the Spanish navigators,  little attentive to languages, gave the names Carib and Cannibal to  every race of people of tall stature and ferocious character. Still it  is by no means probable that the Caribs of the islands and of Parima  took to themselves the name of the region which they had originally  inhabited. On the east of the Andes and wherever civilization has not  yet penetrated, it is the people who have given names to the places  where they have settled.* (* These names of places can be perpetuated  only where the nations succeed immediately to each other, and where  the tradition is interrupted. Thus in the province of Quito many of  the summits of the Andes bear names which belong neither to the  Quichua (the language of Inca) nor to the ancient language of the  Paruays, governed by the Conchocando of Lican.) The words Caribs and  Cannibals appear significant; they are epithets referring to valour,  strength and even superior intelligence.* (* Vespucci says: Charaibi  magnae sapientiae viri.) It is worthy of remark that, at the arrival  of the Portuguese, the Brazilians gave to their magicians the name of  caraibes. We know that the Caribs of Parima were the most wandering  people of America; possibly some wily individuals of that nation  played the same part as the Chaldeans of the ancient continent. The  names of nations readily become affixed to particular professions; and  when, in the time of the Caesars, the superstitions of the East were  introduced into Italy, the Chaldeans no more came from the banks of  the Euphrates than our Gypsies (Egyptians or Bohemians) came from the  banks of the Nile or the Elbe.    When a continent and its adjacent islands are peopled by one and the  same race, we may choose between two hypotheses; supposing the  emigration to have taken place either from the islands to the  continent, or from the continent to the islands. The Iberians  (Basques) who were settled at the same time in Spain and in the  islands of the Mediterranean, afford an instance of this problem; as  do also the Malays who appear to be indigenous in the peninsula of  Malacca, and in the district of Menangkabao in the island of Sumatra.*  (* Crawfurd,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7297"],[0,"The Vedanta-Sutras with the Commentary (#20)"],[1,"is filled by him; all auspicious qualities  constitute his nature. The whole creation of beings is taken out of a  small part of his power. Assuming at will whatever form he desires he  bestows benefits on the whole world effected by him. Glory, strength,  dominion, wisdom, energy, power and other attributes are collected in  him, Supreme of the supreme in whom no troubles abide, ruler over high  and low, lord in collective and distributive form, non-manifest and  manifest, universal lord, all-seeing, all-knowing, all-powerful, highest  Lord. The knowledge by which that perfect, pure, highest, stainless  homogeneous (Brahman) is known or perceived or comprehended--that is  knowledge: all else is ignorance' (Vishnu Purâna VI, 5, 82-87).--'To  that pure one of mighty power, the highest Brahman to which no term is  applicable, the cause of all causes, the name \"Bhagavat\" is suitable.  The letter bha implies both the cherisher and supporter; the letter ga  the leader, mover and creator. The two syllables bhaga indicate the six  attributes--dominion, strength, glory, splendour, wisdom, dispassion.  That in him--the universal Self, the Self of the beings--all beings  dwell and that he dwells in all, this is the meaning of the letter va.  Wisdom, might, strength, dominion, glory, without any evil qualities,  are all denoted by the word bhagavat. This great word bhagavat is the  name of Vâsudeva who is the highest Brahman--and of no one else. This  word which denotes persons worthy of reverence in general is used in its  primary sense with reference to Vâsudeva only; in a derived sense with  regard to other persons' (Vi. Pu. VI, 5, 72 ff.); 'Where all these  powers abide, that is the form of him who is the universal form: that is  the great form of Hari. That form produces in its sport forms endowed  with all powers, whether of gods or men or animals. For the purpose of  benefiting the worlds, not springing from work (karman) is this action  of the unfathomable one; all-pervading, irresistible' (Vi. Pu. VI, 7, 69-  71); 'Him who is of this kind, stainless, eternal, all-pervading,  imperishable, free from all evil, named Vishnu, the highest abode' (Vi.  Pu. I, 22,53); 'He who is the highest of the high, the Person, the  highest Self, founded on himself; who is devoid of all the  distinguishing characteristics of colour, caste and the like; who is  exempt from birth, change, increase, decay and death; of whom it can  only be said that he ever is. He is everywhere and in him everything  abides; hence he is called Vâsudeva by those who know. He is Brahman,  eternal, supreme, imperishable, undecaying; of one essential nature and  ever pure, as free from all defects. This whole world is Brahman,  comprising within its nature the Evolved and the Unevolved; and also  existing in the form of the Person and in that of time' (Vi. Pu. I, 2,  10-14); 'The Prakriti about which I told and which is Evolved as well as  Unevolved, and the Person--both these are merged in the highest Self.  The highest Self is the support of all, the highest Lord; as Vishnu he  is praised in the Vedas and the Vedânta-texts' (Vi. Pu. VI, 4, 38, 39).  'Two forms are there of that Brahman, one material, the other immaterial.  These two forms, perishable and imperishable, are within all things: the  imperishable one is the highest Brahman, the perishable one this whole  world. As the light of a fire burning in one place spreads all around,  so the energy of the highest Brahman constitutes this entire world' (Vi.  Pu. I, 23,53-55). 'The energy of Vishnu is the highest, that which is  called the embodied soul is inferior; and there is another third energy  called karman or Nescience, actuated by which the omnipresent energy of  the embodied soul perpetually undergoes the afflictions of worldly  existence. Obscured by Nescience the energy of the embodied soul is  characterised in the different beings by different degrees of  perfection' (Vi. Pu. VI, 7, 61-63).    These and other texts teach that the highest Brahman is essentially free  from all imperfection whatsoever, comprises within itself all auspicious  qualities, and finds its pastime in originating, preserving, reabsorbing,  pervading, and ruling the universe; that the entire complex of  intelligent and non-intelligent beings (souls and matter) in all their  different estates is real, and constitutes the form, i.e. the body of  the highest Brahman, as appears from those passages which co-ordinate it  with Brahman by means of terms such as sarîra (body), rûpa (form), tanu  (body), amsa (part), sakti (power), vibhûti (manifestation of power),  and so on;--that the souls which are a manifestation of Brahman's power  exist in their own essential nature, and also, through their connexion  with matter, in the form of embodied souls (kshetrajña);--and that the  embodied souls, being engrossed by Nescience in the form of good and  evil works, do not recognise their essential nature, which is knowledge,  but view themselves as having the character of material things.--The  outcome of all this is that we have to cognise Brahman as carrying  plurality within itself, and the world, which is the manifestation of  his power, as something real.    When now the text, in the sloka 'where all difference has vanished' (Vi.  Pu. VI, 7, 53), declares that the Self, although connected with the  different effects of Prakriti, such as divine, human bodies, and so on,  yet is essentially free from all such distinctions, and therefore not  the object of the words denoting those different classes of beings, but  to be defined as mere knowledge and Being; to be known by the Self and  not to be reached by the mind of the practitioner of Yoga (yogayuj);  this must in no way be understood as denying the reality of the world.--  But how is this known?--As follows, we reply. The chapter of the Purâna  in which that sloka occurs at first declares concentration (Yoga) to be  the remedy of all the afflictions of the Samsâra; thereupon explains the  different stages of Yoga up to the so-called pratyâhâra (complete  restraining of the senses from receiving external impressions); then, in  order to teach the attainment of the 'perfect object' (subhâsraya)  required for dhâranâ, declares that the highest Brahman, i. e. Vishnu,  possesses two forms, called powers (sakti), viz. a denned one (mûrta)  and an undefined one (amûrta); and then teaches that a portion of the  'defined' form, viz. the embodied soul (kshetrajña), which is  distinguished by its connexion with matter and involved in Nescience--  that is termed 'action,' and constitutes a third power--is not perfect.  The chapter further teaches that a portion of the undefined form which  is free from Nescience called action, separated from all matter, and  possessing the character of pure knowledge, is also not the 'perfect  object,' since it is destitute of essential purity; and, finally,  declares that the 'perfect object' is to be found in that defined form  which is special to Bhagavat, and which is the abode of the three powers,  viz. that non-defined form which is the highest power, that non-defined  form which is termed embodied soul, and constitutes the secondary  (apara) power, and Nescience in the form of work--which is called the  third power, and is the cause of the Self, which is of the essence of  the highest power, passing into the state of embodied soul. This defined  form (which is the 'perfect object') is proved by certain Vedânta-texts,  such as 'that great person of sun-like lustre' (Svet. Up. III, 8). We  hence must take the sloka, 'in which all differences vanish,' &c., to  mean that the pure Self (the Self in so far as knowledge only) is not  capable of constituting the 'perfect object.' Analogously two other  passages declare 'Because this cannot be reflected upon by the beginner  in Yoga, the second (form) of Vishnu is to be meditated upon by Yogins-  the highest abode.' 'That in which all these powers have their abode,  that is the other great form of Hari, different from the (material)  Visva form.'    In an analogous manner, Parâsara declares that Brahmâ, Katurmukha,  Sanaka, and similar mighty beings which dwell within this world, cannot  constitute the 'perfect object' because they are involved in Nescience;  after that goes on to say that the beings found in the Samsâra are in  the same condition--for they are essentially devoid of purity since they  reach their true nature, only later on, when through Yoga knowledge has  arisen in them--; and finally teaches that the essential individual  nature of the highest Brahman, i.e. Vishnu, constitutes the 'perfect  object.' 'From Brahmâ down to a blade of grass, all living beings that  dwell within this world are in the power of the Samsâra due to works,  and hence no profit can be derived by the devout from making them  objects of their meditation. They are all implicated in Nescience, and  stand within the sphere of the Samsâra; knowledge arises in them only  later on, and they are thus of no use in meditation. Their knowledge  does not belong to them by essential nature, for it comes to them  through something else. Therefore the stainless Brahman which possesses  essential knowledge,' &c. &c.--All this proves that the passage 'in  which all difference vanishes' does not mean to deny the reality of the  world.    Nor, again, does the passage 'that which has knowledge for its essential  nature' (Vi. Pu. 1,2,6) imply that the whole complex of things different  from knowledge is false; for it declares only that the appearance of the  Self--the essential nature of which is knowledge--as gods, men, and so  on, is erroneous. A declaration that the appearance of mother o' pearl  as silver is founded on error surely does not imply that all the silver  in the world is unreal!--But if, on the ground of an insight into the  oneness of Brahman and the world--as expressed in texts where the two  appear in co-ordinatio"]]]
