This method of ferrying over rivers, though tedious, is the  most expeditious way these poor people can contrive; for they are  sometimes obliged to carry their canoes one hundred and fifty, or two  hundred miles, without having occasion to make use of them; yet at times  they cannot do without them; and were they not very small and portable,  it would be impossible for one man to carry them, which they are often  obliged to do, not only the distance above mentioned, but even the whole  Summer.    [Sidenote: 1770. August. 6th.]    [Sidenote: 8th.]    [Sidenote: 1770. August.]    The person I engaged at Cathawhachaga to carry my canoe proving too weak  for the task, another of my crew was obliged to exchange loads with him,  which seemed perfectly agreeable to all parties; and as we walked but  short days' journies, and deer were very plentiful, all things went on  very smoothly. Nothing material happened till the eighth, when we were  near losing the quadrant and all our powder from the following  circumstance: the fellow who had been released from carrying the canoe  proving too weak, as hath been already observed, had, after the  exchange, nothing to carry but my powder and his own trifles; the latter  were indeed very inconsiderable, not equal in size and weight to a  soldier's knapsack. As I intended to have a little sport with the deer,  and knowing his load to be much lighter than mine, I gave him the  quadrant {42} and stand to carry, which he took without the least  hesitation, or seeming ill-will. Having thus eased myself for the  present of a heavy and cumbersome part of my load, I set out early in  the morning with some of the Indian men; and after walking about eight  or nine miles, saw, from the top of a high hill, a great number of deer  feeding in a neighbouring valley; on which we laid down our loads and  erected a flag, as a signal for the others to pitch their tents there  for the night. We then pursued our hunting, which proved very  successful. At night, however, when we came to the hill where we had  left our baggage, I found that only part of the Indians had arrived, and  that the man who had been entrusted with my powder and quadrant, had set  off another way, with a small party of Indians that had been in our  company that morning. The evening being far advanced, we were obliged to  defer going in search of him till the morning, and as his track could  not be easily discovered in the Summer, the Southern Indians, as well as  myself, were very uneasy, fearing we had lost the powder, which was to  provide us with food and raiment the remainder of our journey. The very  uncourteous behaviour of the Northern Indians then in company, gave me  little hopes of receiving assistance from them, any longer than I had  wherewithal to reward them for their trouble and expense; for during the  whole time I had been with them, not one of them had offered to give me  the least morsel of victuals, without asking something in exchange,  which, in general, was three times the value of {43} what they could  have got for the same articles, had they carried them to the Factory,  though several hundred miles distant.    So inconsiderate were those people, that wherever they met me, they  always expected that I had a great assortment of goods to relieve their  necessities; as if I had brought the Company's warehouse with me. Some  of them wanted guns; all wanted ammunition, iron-work, and tobacco; many  were solicitous for medicine; and others pressed me for different  articles of clothing; but when they found I had nothing to spare, except  a few nick-nacks and gewgaws, they made no scruple of pronouncing me a  \"poor servant, noways like the Governor at the Factory, who, they said,  they never saw, but he gave them something useful.\" It is scarcely  possible to conceive any people so void of common understanding, as to  think that the sole intent of my undertaking this fatiguing journey, was  to carry a large assortment of useful and heavy implements, to give to  all that stood in need of them; but many of them would ask me for what  they wanted with the same freedom, and apparently with the same hopes of  success, as if they had been at one of the Company's Factories. Others,  with an air of more generosity, offered me furs to trade with at the  same standard as at the Factory; without considering how unlikely it was  that I should increase the enormous weight of my load with articles  which could be of no more use to me in my present situation than they  were to themselves.    [Sidenote: 1770. August.]    {44} This unaccountable behaviour of the Indians occasioned much serious  reflection on my part; as it showed plainly how little I had to expect  if I should, by any accident, be reduced to the necessity of depending  upon them for support; so that, though I laid me down to rest, sleep was  a stranger to me that night. The following beautiful lines of Dr. Young  I repeated above an hundred times:        \"Tired Nature's sweet restorer, balmy Sleep;      He, like the world, his ready visit pays      Where fortune smiles; the wretched he forsakes:      Swift on his downy pinions flies from woe,      And lights on lids unsully'd with a tear.\"        --NIGHT THOUGHTS.    [Sidenote: 9th.]    [Sidenote: 1770. August.]    After passing the night in this melancholy manner, I got up at daybreak,  and, with the two Southern Indians, set out in quest of our deserter.  Many hours elapsed in fruitless search after him, as we could not  discover a single track in the direction which we were informed he had  taken. The day being almost spent without the least appearance of  success, I proposed repairing to the place where I had delivered the  quadrant to him, in hopes of seeing some track in the moss that might  lead to the way the Indians were gone whom our deserter had accompanied.  On our arrival at that place, we found they had struck down toward a  little river which they had crossed the morning before; and there, to  our great joy, we found the quadrant and the bag of powder lying on the  top of a high stone, but not a human being was to be seen. On {45}  examining the powder, we found that the bag had been opened, and part of  it taken out; but, notwithstanding our loss was very considerable, we  returned with light hearts to the place at which we had been the night  before, where we found our baggage safe, but all the Indians gone; they  had, however, been so considerate as to set up marks to direct us what  course to steer. By the time we had adjusted our bundles, the day was  quite spent; seeing, however, a smoke, or rather a fire, in the  direction we were ordered to steer, we bent our way towards it; and a  little after ten o'clock at night came up with the main body of the  Indians; when, after refreshing ourselves with a plentiful supper, the  first morsel we had tasted that day, we retired to rest, which I at  least enjoyed with better success than the preceding night.    [Sidenote: 11th.]    In the morning of the eleventh we proceeded on to the West, and West by  South; but on the twelfth did not move. This gave us an opportunity of  endeavouring to ascertain the latitude by a meridian altitude, when we  found the place to be in 63 deg. 10' North nearly. It proving rather cloudy  about noon, though exceeding fine weather, I let the quadrant stand, in  order to obtain the latitude more exactly by two altitudes; but, to my  great mortification, while I was eating my dinner, a sudden gust of wind  blew it down; and as the ground where it stood was {46} very stoney, the  bubble, the sight-vane, and vernier, were entirely broke to pieces,  which rendered the instrument useless. In consequence of this misfortune  I resolved to return again to the Fort, though we were then in the  latitude of 63 deg. 10' North, and about 10 deg. 40' West longitude from  Churchill River.[43]      FOOTNOTES:    [R] This was a proposal of the Governor's, though he well knew we could  not do without their assistance, both for hauling our baggage, as well  as dressing skins for clothing, pitching our tent, getting firing, &c.

The better to  harmonize, I proposed to reinforce his column by three of my brigades, to  be sent under General Wilcox, to lead or follow his division, as he might  order. Under this arrangement it seemed that concert of action was  assured. I gave especial orders to General Wilcox to have care that the  head of his column was abreast the battle when it opened, and rode forward  to join General Hill, my other three brigades advancing along the  Williamsburg road.    Opposing and in the immediate front of General Hill was the division of  General Casey, of the Fourth (Keyes's) Corps. The division stood in an  intrenched camp across the Williamsburg road, with a pentagonal redoubt  (unfinished) on the left of his line. Half a mile in rear of Casey's  division was that of Couch, of the same corps, behind a second trenched  line, at its junction of the Nine Miles road, part of Couch's extending  along the latter road to Fair Oaks Station of the York River Railroad, and  intrenched; farther forward he had a guarded picket station. Between Couch  and Casey a skirt of wood stretched from the swamp on their left across  the Williamsburg and Nine Miles roads and the railroad. Between the  stretch of forest and Couch was an open; spreading across the roads, and  at Casey's front, was another open, though more limited, some abatis being  arranged along their front lines. These were the only cleared fields on  the south side of the railroad within two miles of Casey's picket line,  our line of march and attack.    General D. H. Hill stood ready for battle at an early hour, waiting for  his brigade on the Charles City road. Under the delay to relieve that  brigade by one of Huger's divisions, I sent orders to General Wilcox to  pull off from column on that road and march for the position assigned him  near the head of White Oak Swamp.    The detailed instructions for battle were that the advance should be made  in columns of brigades two on each side the Williamsburg road, preceded by  strong lines of skirmishers; the advance, approaching an open or abatis or  trench line, should reinforce the skirmish line to strong engagement,  while the lines of battle turned those obstacles by flank or oblique march  when the general advance should be resumed. As the wooded field was not  convenient for artillery use, we only held the batteries of Bondurant and  Carter ready for call. At eleven o'clock, weary of delay, General Hill  asked to let loose his signal-gun and engage, but was ordered to wait for  his absent brigade.    The reports of the hour of opening battle are more conflicting in this  than in most battles, owing possibly to the fact that many are fixed by  the beginning of the hot battle about the trenched camp, while others are  based on the actual firing of the signal-guns. The weight of evidence  seems conclusive of the former attack at one P.M., and this would place  the firing of the signal-guns back to noon or a little after. As events  occurred, however, the hour is not of especial interest, as it is shown  that the battle was in time for a finish before night if it had been  promptly followed up. I will say, therefore, that General Hill's second  appeal to open the signal-gun was made a little before noon, and that he  stated in this appeal that his brigade from the Charles City road was  approaching, and would be with him. He was then authorized to march, but  to give instructions that the advance should be carefully conducted until  all the troops were in place, to give full force to his battle. He had  four brigades, and was ordered to advance in columns of brigades, two on  each side of the road. Garland's and G. B. Anderson's brigades in columns,  preceded by skirmishers, advanced on the left of the road at the sound of  the guns, and engaged after a short march from the starting. As Rodes's  brigade was not yet in position, some little time elapsed before the  columns on the right moved, so that Garland's column encountered more than  its share of early fight, but Rodes, supported by Rains's brigade, came  promptly to his relief, which steadied the advance. The enemy's front was  reinforced and arrested progress of our skirmishers, but a way was found  by which the enemy was turned out of position, and by and by the open  before the intrenched camp was reached. In the redoubt was a six-gun  battery, and on the right another section of two pieces. General Hill  ordered Bondurant's battery to the open into action, and presently the  battery of Captain Carter.    Garland and G. B. Anderson had severe contention at one o'clock, but by  pushing front and flank movements got to the enemy's strong line. R. H.  Anderson's brigade was pushed up in support of their left, when a bold  move gave us the section of artillery and that end of the line. At the  same time Carter's battery was in close practice with five guns within  four hundred yards of the redoubt, and the enemy was seriously disturbed;  but General Hill was disposed to wait a little for Huger, thought to be  between him and the swamp, to get farther in; then, fearing that longer  wait might be hazardous of his opportunity, he ordered Rains's brigade  past the enemy's left, when Rodes seized the moment, rushed in, and gained  the redoubt and the battery. The officers at the battery made a brave  effort to spike their guns, but were killed in the act. So Rodes, who had  some artillerists acting as infantry, turned them with some effect upon  the troops as they retired.    When General Hill reported that he must use Rains's brigade to march  around the redoubt, other orders were sent General Wilcox to leave General  Huger's column and march to his position on the right of General Hill's  battle, directing, in case there were serious obstacles to his march by  the Charles City road, to march over to and down the Williamsburg road. A  slip of paper was sent General Johnston reporting progress and asking  co-operation on our left.    The battle moved bravely on. R. H. Anderson's brigade was ordered to  support its left at Fair Oaks, and Pickett's, on the railroad, was drawn  near. Hill met Casey's troops rallying, and reinforcements with them  coming to recover the lost ground, but they were forced back to the second  intrenched line (Couch's), where severe fighting ensued, but the line was  carried at two o'clock, cutting Couch with four regiments and two  companies of infantry, and Brady's six-gun battery, off at Fair Oaks  Station. Finding that he could not cut his way back to his command, Couch  stood back from the railroad and presently opened his battery fire across  our advancing lines. As he was standing directly in front of Smith's  division, we thought that he would soon be attacked and driven off.  Nevertheless, it was not prudent to leave that point on our flank  unguarded until we found Smith's division in action. The force was shut  off from our view by the thick pine wood, so that we could know nothing of  its strength, and only knew of its position from its artillery fire. We  could not attack it lest we should fall under the fire of the division in  position for that attack. Anderson's other regiments, under the gallant  Colonel M. Jenkins, were ordered into Hill's forward battle, as his troops  were worn. Jenkins soon found himself in the van, and so swiftly led on  that the discomfited troops found no opportunity to rally. Reinforcements  from the Third Corps came, but in the swampy wood Jenkins was prompt  enough to strike their heads as their retreating comrades passed. Right  and left and front he applied his beautiful tactics and pushed his battle.    General Kearny, finding that he could not arrest the march, put Berry's  brigade off to the swamp to flank and strike it, and took part of  Jamison's brigade to follow. They got into the swamp and followed it up to  the open near the Couch intrenchment,[16] but Jenkins knew that there was  some one there to meet them, and pushed his onward battle. General Hill  ordered Rains's brigade to turn this new force, while Rodes attacked, but  the latter's men were worn, and some of them were with the advance.  Kemper's brigade was sent to support the forward battle, but General Hill  directed it to his right against Berry, in front of Rains, and it seems  that the heavy, swampy ground so obstructed operations on both sides as to  limit their work to infantry fusillades until six o'clock.    Our battle on the Williamsburg road was in a sack. We were strong enough  to guard our flanks and push straight on, but the front was growing heavy.  It was time for Wilcox's brigades under his last order, but nothing was  heard of them. I asked General Stuart, who had joined me, if there were  obstacles to Wilcox's march between the Charles City and Williamsburg  roads. He reported that there was nothing more than swamp lands, hardly  knee-deep. He was asked for a guide, who was sent with a courier bearing  orders for them to remain with General Wilcox until he reported at my  head-quarters.    Again I reported the cramped condition of our work, owing to the artillery  practice from beyond the railroad, and asked General Johnston to have the  division that was with him drive that force away and loose our left. This  note was ordered to be put into General Johnston's hands. He gave  peremptory commands to that effect, but the movements were so slow that he  lost patience and rode with Hood's leading brigade, pulled it on, and  ordered communication opened with my left.
