The road for the first  mile led over reddish ground, and was drained by gentle slopes falling  east and west; but, leaving the cover of the friendly woods, on whose  eastern margin we had been delayed so long, we emerged into one of the  savannahs, whose soil during the rain is as soft as slush and tenacious  as thick mortar, where we were all threatened with the fate of the  famous Arkansas traveller, who had sunk so low in one of the many  quagmires in Arkansas county, that nothing but his tall \"stove-pipe\" hat  was left visible.    Shaw was sick, and the whole duty of driving the foundering caravan  devolved upon myself. The Wanyamwezi donkeys stuck in the mire as if  they were rooted to it. As fast as one was flogged from his stubborn  position, prone to the depths fell another, giving me a Sisyphean  labour, which was maddening trader pelting rain, assisted by such men  as Bombay and Uledi, who could not for a whole skin's sake stomach the  storm and mire. Two hours of such a task enabled me to drag my caravan  over a savannah one mile and a half broad; and barely had I finished  congratulating myself over my success before I was halted by a deep  ditch, which, filled with rain-water from the inundated savannahs, had  become a considerable stream, breast-deep, flowing swiftly into the  Makata. Donkeys had to be unloaded, led through a torrent, and loaded  again on the other bank--an operation which consumed a full hour.    Presently, after straggling through a wood clump, barring our progress  was another stream, swollen into a river. The bridge being swept away,  we were obliged to swim and float our baggage over, which delayed us  two hours more. Leaving this second river-bank, we splashed, waded,  occasionally half-swimming, and reeled through mire, water-dripping  grass and matama stalks, along the left bank of the Makata proper, until  farther progress was effectually prevented for that day by a deep bend  of the river, which we should be obliged to cross the next day.    Though but six miles were traversed during that miserable day, the march  occupied ten hours.    Half dead with fatigue, I yet could feel thankful that it was not  accompanied by fever, which it seemed a miracle to avoid; for if ever a  district was cursed with the ague, the Makata wilderness ranks foremost  of those afflicted. Surely the sight of the dripping woods enveloped  in opaque mist, of the inundated country with lengthy swathes of  tiger-grass laid low by the turbid flood, of mounds of decaying trees  and canes, of the swollen river and the weeping sky, was enough to  engender the mukunguru! The well-used khambi, and the heaps of filth  surrounding it, were enough to create a cholera!    The Makata, a river whose breadth during the dry season is but forty  feet, in the Masika season assumes the breadth, depth, and force of an  important river. Should it happen to be an unusually rainy season, it  inundates the great plain which stretches on either side, and converts  it into a great lake. It is the main feeder of the Wami river, which  empties into the sea between the ports of Saadani and Whinde. About ten  miles north-east of the Makata crossing, the Great Makata, the Little  Makata, a nameless creek, and the Rudewa river unite; and the river thus  formed becomes known as the Wami. Throughout Usagara the Wami is known  as the Mukondokwa. Three of these streams take their rise from the  crescent-like Usagara range, which bounds the Makata plain south and  south-westerly; while the Rudewa rises in the northern horn of the same  range.    So swift was the flow of the Makata, and so much did its unsteady  bridge, half buried in the water, imperil the safety of the property,  that its transfer from bank to bank occupied fully five hours. No sooner  had we landed every article on the other side, undamaged by the water,  than the rain poured down in torrents that drenched them all, as if they  had been dragged through the river. To proceed through the swamp which  an hour's rain had formed was utterly out of the question. We were  accordingly compelled to camp in a place where every hour furnished its  quota of annoyance. One of the Wangwana soldiers engaged at Bagamoyo,  named Kingaru, improved an opportunity to desert with another Mgwana's  kit. My two detectives, Uledi (Grant's valet), and Sarmean, were  immediately despatched in pursuit, both being armed with American  breech-loaders. They went about their task with an adroitness and  celerity which augured well for their success. In an hour they returned  with the runaway, having found him hidden in the house of a Mseguhha  chief called Kigondo, who lived about a mile from the eastern bank of  the river, and who had accompanied Uledi and Sarmean to receive his  reward, and render an account of the incident.    Kigondo said, when he had been seated, \"I saw this man carrying a  bundle, and running hard, by which I knew that he was deserting you. We  (my wife and 1) were sitting in our little watch-hut, watching our corn;  and, as the road runs close by, this man was obliged to come close to  us. We called to him when he was near, saying, 'Master, where are you  going so fast? Are you deserting the Musungu, for we know you belong to  him, since you bought from us yesterday two doti worth of meat?' 'Yes,'  said he, 'I am running away; I want to get to Simbamwenni. If you will  take me there, I will give you a doti.' We said to him then, 'Come into  our house, and we will talk it over quietly. When he was in our house  in an inner room, we locked him up, and went out again to the watch; but  leaving word with the women to look out for him. We knew that, if you  wanted him, you would send askari (soldiers) after him. We had but  lit our pipes when we saw two men armed with short guns, and having no  loads, coming along the road, looking now and then on the ground, as  if they were looking at footmarks. We knew them to be the men we were  expecting; so we hailed them, and said, 'Masters, what are ye looking  for?' \\ They said, 'We are looking for a man who has deserted our  master. Here are his footsteps. If you have been long in your hut you  must have seen him, Can you tell us where he is?' We said, 'yes; he is  in our house. If you will come with us, we will give him up to you; but  your master must give us something for catching him.'\"    As Kigondo had promised to deliver Kingaru up, there remained nothing  further to do for Uledi and Sarmean but to take charge of their  prisoner, and bring him and his captors to my camp on the western bank  of the Makata. Kingaru received two dozen lashes, and was chained; his  captor a doti, besides five khete of red coral beads for his wife.    That down-pour of rain which visited us the day we crossed the Makata  proved the last of the Masika season. As the first rainfall which we had  experienced occurred on the 23rd March, and the last on the 30th April,  its duration was thirty-nine days. The seers of Bagamoyo had delivered  their vaticinations concerning this same Masika with solemnity. \"For  forty days,\" said they, \"rain would fall incessantly;\" whereas we had  but experienced eighteen days' rain. Nevertheless, we were glad that it  was over, for we were tired of stopping day after day to dry the bales  and grease the tools and ironware, and of seeing all things of cloth and  leather rot visibly before our eyes.    The 1st of May found us struggling through the mire and water of the  Makata with a caravan bodily sick, from the exertion and fatigue of  crossing so many rivers and wading through marshes. Shaw was still  suffering from his first mukunguru; Zaidi, a soldier, was critically  ill with the small-pox; the kichuma-chuma, \"little irons,\" had hold  of Bombay across the chest, rendering him the most useless of the  unserviceables; Mabruk Saleem, a youth of lusty frame, following the  example of Bombay, laid himself down on the marshy ground, professing  his total inability to breast the Makata swamp; Abdul Kader, the Hindi  tailor and adventurer--the weakliest of mortal bodies--was ever ailing  for lack of \"force,\" as he expressed it in French, i.e. \"strength,\" ever  indisposed to work, shiftless, mock-sick, but ever hungry. \"Oh! God,\"  was the cry of my tired soul, \"were all the men of my Expedition like  this man I should be compelled to return.\" Solomon was wise perhaps  from inspiration, perhaps from observation; I was becoming wise by  experience, and I was compelled to observe that when mud and wet sapped  the physical energy of the lazily-inclined, a dog-whip became their  backs, restoring them to a sound--some-times to an extravagant activity.    For thirty miles from our camp was the Makata plain an extensive swamp.  The water was on an average one foot in depth; in some places we plunged  into holes three, four, and even five feet deep. Plash, splash, plash,  splash, were the only sounds we heard from the commencement of the march  until we found the bomas occupying the only dry spots along the line of  march. This kind of work continued for two days, until we came in sight  of the Rudewa river, another powerful stream with banks brimful of  rushing rain-water. Crossing a branch of the Rudewa, and emerging from  the dank reedy grass crowding the western bank, the view consisted of  an immense sheet of water topped by clumps of grass tufts and foliage of  thinly scattered trees, bounded ten or twelve miles off by the eastern  front of the Usagara mountain range. The acme of discomfort and vexation  was realized on the five-mile march from the Rudewa branch. As myself  and the Wangwana appeared with the loaded donkeys, the pagazis were  observed huddled on a mound. When asked if the mound was the camp, they  replied \"No.\" \"Why, then, do you stop here?\"--"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/517"],[0,"The Emerald City of Oz (#20)"],[1,"piano, but none of my family can play on it,\" he  said, reflectively.  \"Suppose you eat that.\"    \"All right,\" said Dorothy; \"I don't mind.  Anything to be  accommodating.\"    So Mr. Over led her into the house, where she ate the piano, which was  of an excellent flavor.    \"Is there anything to drink here?\" she asked.    \"Yes; I've a milk pump and a water pump; which will you have?\" he asked.    \"I guess I'll try 'em both,\" said Dorothy.    So Mr. Over called to his wife, who brought into the yard a pail made  of some kind of baked dough, and Dorothy pumped the pail full of cool,  sweet milk and drank it eagerly.    The wife of Pop Over was several shades darker than her husband.    \"Aren't you overdone?\" the little girl asked her.    \"No indeed,\" answered the woman.  \"I'm neither overdone nor done over;  I'm just Mrs. Over, and I'm the President of the Bunbury Breakfast  Band.\"    Dorothy thanked them for their hospitality and went away.  At the gate  Mr. Cinnamon Bunn met her and said he would show her around the town.  \"We have some very interesting inhabitants,\" he remarked, walking  stiffly beside her on his stick-cinnamon legs; \"and all of us who are  in good health are well bred.  If you are no longer hungry we will call  upon a few of the most important citizens.\"    Toto and Billina followed behind them, behaving very well, and a little  way down the street they came to a handsome residence where Aunt Sally  Lunn lived.  The old lady was glad to meet the little girl and gave her  a slice of white bread and butter which had been used as a door-mat.  It was almost fresh and tasted better than anything Dorothy had eaten  in the town.    \"Where do you get the butter?\" she inquired.    \"We dig it out of the ground, which, as you may have observed, is all  flour and meal,\" replied Mr. Bunn.  \"There is a butter mine just at the  opposite side of the village.  The trees which you see here are all  doughleanders and doughderas, and in the season we get quite a crop of  dough-nuts off them.\"    \"I should think the flour would blow around and get into your eyes,\"  said Dorothy.    \"No,\" said he; \"we are bothered with cracker dust sometimes, but never  with flour.\"    Then he took her to see Johnny Cake, a cheerful old gentleman who lived  near by.    \"I suppose you've heard of me,\" said old Johnny, with an air of pride.  \"I'm a great favorite all over the world.\"    \"Aren't you rather yellow?\" asked Dorothy, looking at him critically.    \"Maybe, child.  But don't think I'm bilious, for I was never in better  health in my life,\" replied the old gentleman.  \"If anything ailed me,  I'd willingly acknowledge the corn.\"    \"Johnny's a trifle stale,\" said Mr. Bunn, as they went away; \"but he's  a good mixer and never gets cross-grained.  I will now take you to call  upon some of my own relatives.\"  They visited the Sugar Bunns, the  Currant Bunns and the Spanish Bunns, the latter having a decidedly  foreign appearance.  Then they saw the French Rolls, who were very  polite to them, and made a brief call upon the Parker H. Rolls, who  seemed a bit proud and overbearing.    \"But they're not as stuck up as the Frosted Jumbles,\" declared Mr.  Bunn, \"who are people I really can't abide.  I don't like to be  suspicious or talk scandal, but sometimes I think the Jumbles have too  much baking powder in them.\"    Just then a dreadful scream was heard, and Dorothy turned hastily  around to find a scene of great excitement a little way down the  street.  The people were crowding around Toto and throwing at him  everything they could find at hand.  They pelted the little dog with  hard-tack, crackers, and even articles of furniture which were hard  baked and heavy enough for missiles.    Toto howeled a little as the assortment of bake stuff struck him; but  he stood still, with head bowed and tail between his legs, until  Dorothy ran up and inquired what the matter was.    \"Matter!\" cried a rye loafer, indignantly, \"why the horrid beast has  eaten three of our dear Crumpets, and is now devouring a Salt-rising  Biscuit!\"    \"Oh, Toto!  How could you?\" exclaimed Dorothy, much distressed.    Toto's mouth was full of his salt-rising victim; so he only whined and  wagged his tail.  But Billina, who had flown to the top of a cracker  house to be in a safe place, called out:    \"Don't blame him, Dorothy; the Crumpets dared him to do it.\"    \"Yes, and you pecked out the eyes of a Raisin Bunn--one of our best  citizens!\" shouted a bread pudding, shaking its fist at the Yellow Hen.    \"What's that!  What's that?\" wailed Mr. Cinnamon Bunn, who had now  joined them.  \"Oh, what a misfortune--what a terrible misfortune!\"    \"See here,\" said Dorothy, determined to defend her pets, \"I think we've  treated you all pretty well, seeing you're eatables an' reg'lar food  for us.  I've been kind to you and eaten your old wheelbarrows and  pianos and rubbish, an' not said a word.  But Toto and Billina can't be  'spected to go hungry when the town's full of good things they like to  eat, 'cause they can't understand your stingy ways as I do.\"    \"You must leave here at once!\" said Mr. Bunn, sternly.    \"Suppose we won't go?\" said Dorothy, who was now much provoked.    \"Then,\" said he, \"we will put you into the great ovens where we are  made, and bake you.\"    Dorothy gazed around and saw threatening looks upon the faces of all.  She had not noticed any ovens in the town, but they might be there,  nevertheless, for some of the inhabitants seemed very fresh.  So she  decided to go, and calling to Toto and Billina to follow her she  marched up the street with as much dignity as possible, considering  that she was followed by the hoots and cries of the buns and biscuits  and other bake stuff.        18.  How Ozma Looked into the Magic Picture    Princess Ozma was a very busy little ruler, for she looked carefully  after the comfort and welfare of her people and tried to make them  happy.  If any quarrels arose she decided them justly; if any one  needed counsel or advice she was ready and willing to listen to them.    For a day or two after Dorothy and her companions had started on their  trip, Ozma was occupied with the affairs of her kingdom.  Then she  began to think of some manner of occupation for Uncle Henry and Aunt Em  that would be light and easy and yet give the old people something to  do.    She soon decided to make Uncle Henry the Keeper of the Jewels, for some  one really was needed to count and look after the bins and barrels of  emeralds, diamonds, rubies and other precious stones that were in the  Royal Storehouses.  That would keep Uncle Henry busy enough, but it was  harder to find something for Aunt Em to do.  The palace was full of  servants, so there was no detail of housework that Aunt Em could look  after.    While Ozma sat in her pretty room engaged in thought she happened to  glance at her Magic Picture.    This was one of the most important treasures in all the Land of Oz.  It  was a large picture, set in a beautiful gold frame, and it hung in a  prominent place upon a wall of Ozma's private room.    Usually this picture seemed merely a country scene, but whenever Ozma  looked at it and wished to know what any of her friends or  acquaintances were doing, the magic of this wonderful picture was  straightway disclosed.  For the country scene would gradually fade away  and in its place would appear the likeness of the person or persons  Ozma might wish to see, surrounded by the actual scenes in which they  were then placed.  In this way the Princess could view any part of the  world she wished, and watch the actions of any one in whom she was  interested.    Ozma had often seen Dorothy in her Kansas home by this means, and now,  having a little leisure, she expressed a desire to see her little  friend again.  It was while the travelers were at Fuddlecumjig, and  Ozma laughed merrily as she watched in the picture her friends trying  to match the pieces of Grandmother Gnit.    \"They seem happy and are doubtless having a good time,\" the girl Ruler  said to herself; and then she began to think of the many adventures she  herself had encountered with Dorothy.    The image of her friends now faded from the Magic Picture and the old  landscape slowly reappeared.    Ozma was thinking of the time when with Dorothy and her army she  marched to the Nome King's underground cavern, beyond the Land of Ev,  and forced the old monarch to liberate his captives, who belonged to  the Royal Family of Ev.  That was the time when the Scarecrow nearly  frightened the Nome King into fits by throwing one of Billina's eggs at  him, and Dorothy had captured King Roquat's Magic Belt and brought it  away with her to the Land of Oz.    The pretty Princess smiled at the recollection of this adventure, and  then she wondered what had become of the Nome King since then.  Merely  because she was curious and had nothing better to do, Ozma glanced at  the Magic Picture and wished to see in it the King of the Nomes.    Roquat the Red went every day into his tunnel to see how the work was  getting along and to hurry his workmen as much as possible.  He was  there now, and Ozma saw him plainly in the Magic Picture.    She saw the underground tunnel, reaching far underneath the Deadly  Desert which separated the Land of Oz from the mountains beneath which  the Nome King had his extensive caverns.  She saw that the tunnel was  being made in the direction of the Emerald City, and knew at once it  was being dug so that the army of Nomes could march through it and  attack her own beautiful and peaceful country.    \"I suppose King Roquat is planning revenge against us,\" she said,  musingly, \"and thinks he can surprise us and make us his captives and  slaves.  How sad it is that any one can have such wicked thoughts!  But  I must not blame King Roquat too severely, for he is a Nome, and his  nature is not so gentle as my own.\"    Then she dismissed from her mind"]]]
