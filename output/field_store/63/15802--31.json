The  Caracci themselves had been only scantily remunerated. Count Malvasia  admits this fact, not omitting to point out the small dwelling, and to  describe the narrow circumstances in which Lodovico died, while his two  relatives left the world still more impoverished than himself. The Caracci,  moreover, did not, like other painters, leave legitimate sons to perpetuate  their school; they never married, and were accustomed to observe that the  art was sole partner of their thoughts. And this beloved mistress they  adored and served with a love so passionate, as to abandon almost all  worldly care for themselves. Even while sitting at their meals they had the  implements of their art before them; and wherever they observed an action  or gesture adapted to adorn it, they took instant note of it. And to this  their free estate, more than to any other cause, were they indebted for  their noble progress and improvement. Had they \"taken to themselves a  wife,\" how easily would their agreeable friendship and attachment, from  which each of the three derived light and knowledge from the rest, have  been broken in upon by tattling and trifles beneath their care. Most  probably, too, it might have occasioned too great rapidity of hand, at the  expense of study; such at least having been the result with regard to many,  who, to indulge a woman's taste, or to provide for the wants of a family,  have addicted themselves to carelessness and despatch. At the period, then,  of the decease of the two cousins, and the advanced age of Lodovico, there  remained of the family only two youths, one, named Francesco, at Bologna,  the other, Antonio, in Rome.    Francesco was a younger brother of Agostino and Annibal. Confiding in his  connexions and in his own talent, excellent in point of design, and  reasonably good in colouring, he ventured to oppose a school of his own to  that of Lodovico, his master, inscribing upon the door: \"This is the true  school of the Caracci.\" He enjoyed no reputation at Bologna, but was rather  held in dislike, on account of his opposition to and detraction of  Lodovico, to whom he owed what little he executed at that place, namely, an  altar-piece, with various saints, at S. Maria Maggiore, the whole of which  had been retouched by his kind and able cousin. Having gone to Rome, he was  first received with applause, but becoming better known he was soon  despised; and, without leaving a single specimen of his pencil, he died  there in his twenty-seventh year, in the hospital. Antonio Caracci, a  natural son of Agostino, and pupil to Annibal, was of a totally different  disposition. Prudent, affectionate, and grateful to his relatives, he  received Annibal's last sighs at Rome, bestowed upon him a splendid funeral  in the same church of the Rotonda, where Raffaello's remains had been  exhibited, and deposited his ashes at the side of that great artist. He  survived, a valetudinarian, during some years, and died at the age of  thirty-five, in Rome, where he left some works in the pontifical palace,  and at S. Bartolommeo. They are rarely met with in cabinets, though I saw  one in Genoa, a Veronica, in possession of the Brignole family. Bellori Had  written his life, which, although now lost, leads to the supposition that  he possessed great merit, inasmuch as that writer confined himself to the  commemoration of only first rate artists. Baldassare Aloisi, called  Galanino, a kinsman and scholar of the Caracci, yielded to few of his  fellow-pupils in his compositions. His picture of the Visitation, at the  church of the Carita in Bologna, so much extolled by Malvasia, to say  nothing of various other pictures, executed at Rome, and favourably  recorded by Baglione, affords ample proofs of it. His fortune, however, was  not equal to his merit; so that he wholly devoted himself to portraiture,  and as we have stated, in the Roman School, he there for some period  boasted the chief sway in the branch of portraits, which were uniformly  characterized by great power and strong relief.    Other Bolognese artists, educated in the same academy, took up their  residence also at Rome, or in its state; nor were they few in number,  since, as was observed in the fourth epoch of that school, they were  received there with distinguished favour. We shall commence with the least  celebrated. Lattanzio Mainardi, called by Baglione Lattanzio Bolognese, had  visited Rome previous to Annibal, and in the pontificate of Sixtus V.,  conducted several works for the Vatican, which augured well of his genius,  had he not died there very young; as well as one Gianpaolo Bonconti, at an  age still more immature, having vainly followed his master to Rome, where  he had only time to make a few designs, but conceived in the best taste.  Innocenzio Tacconi was kinsman, according to some, and assuredly enjoyed  the confidence of Annibale. From him he received designs and retouches,  tending to make him appear a more considerable artist than he really was.  To judge from some of his histories of St. Andrew, painted for S. Maria del  Popolo, and S. Angiolo, in the fish-market, he may be said to have rivalled  his best fellow-pupils. But abusing his master's goodness, and alienating  his regard from Agostino, from Albano, and from Guido, by  misrepresentations, he received the usual recompence of slanderers. Annibal  withdrew his support, deprived of which he gradually became more and more  insignificant. Anton Maria Panico early left Rome, and, entering the  service of Mario Farnese, resided upon his estates, being employed in  painting at Castro, at Latera, and at Farnese, in whose cathedral he placed  his picture of the mass, to which Annibal also put his hand, even  conducting some of the figures. Baldassare Croce is an artist enumerated by  Orlandi among the pupils of Annibal; by Malvasia, among the imitators of  Guido. Baglione describes him as superior in age to all three of the  Caracci, introducing him into Rome as early as the times of Gregory.  Towards reconciling the accounts of these writers, it might be observed,  that continuing to reside at Rome, he may have taken advantage, as he  advanced in age, of the examples afforded by his noble fellow-citizens. His  style, from what we gather of it in the public palace of Viterbo, and a  cupola of the Gesu, as well as from his large histories of S. Susanna, and  other places in Rome, is easy, natural, and entitling him to the name of a  good mechanist and painter of frescos, but not so easily to that of a  follower of the Caracci. Gio. Luigi Valesio entered, though late, into the  same school, and chiefly attached himself to engraving and to miniature.  Proceeding to Rome, he was there employed by the Lodovisi under the  pontificate of Gregory XV., and obtained great honours. We find him  commended in the works of Marini and other poets, though less for the art,  in which he only moderately excelled, than for his assiduity and his  fortune. He was one of those wits, who in the want of sound merit know how  to substitute easier methods to advance themselves; seasonably to regale  such as can assist them, to affect joy amidst utter humiliation, to  accommodate themselves to men's tempers, to flatter, to insinuate, and to  canvass interest, until they attain their object. By means like these he  maintained his equipage in Rome, where Annibal, during many years, obtained  no other stipend for his honourable toils, than a bare roof for his head,  daily pittance for himself and his servant, with annual payment of a  hundred and twenty crowns.[28] In the few pieces executed by Valesio at  Bologna, such as his Nunziata of the Mendicants, we perceive a dry  composition of small relief, yet exact according to the method of the  miniaturists. He appears to have somewhat improved at Rome, where he left a  few works in fresco and in oil, exhibiting his whole power, perhaps, in a  figure of Religion, in the cloister of the Minerva. To these artists of the  Caracci school it will be sufficient only to have alluded. They were indeed  no more than gregarious followers of those elevated standards of their age.         Footnote 28: See _Malvasia_, vol. i. p. 574.    The five, however, who next follow, deserve a nearer view, and more  accurate acquaintance with their merits. These, remaining indeed at Rome,  became leaders of new ranks, which from them assumed their name and device;  and hence we have alternately been compelled to record the disciples of  Albano, of Guido, and so of the rest. This repetition, however, in other  places, will now permit us to treat of them in a more cursory view.    Domenico Zampieri, otherwise Domenichino, is at this day universally  esteemed the most distinguished pupil of the Caracci; and has even been  preferred by Count Algarotti to the Caracci themselves. What is still more,  Poussin ranked him directly next to Raffaello; and in the introduction to  the life of Camassei, almost the same opinion is given by Passeri. During  the early part of his career his genius appeared slow, because it was  profound and accurate; and Passeri attributes his grand progress more to  his amazing study than to his genius. From his acting as a continual censor  of his own productions, he became among his fellow pupils the most exact  and expressive designer, his colours most true to nature, and of the best  _impasto_, the most universal master in the theory of his art, the sole  painter amongst them all in whom Mengs found nothing to desire, except a  somewhat larger proportion of elegance. That he might devote his whole  being to the art, he shunned all society, or if he occasionally sought it  in the public theatres and markets, it was in order better to observe the  play of nature's passions in the features of the people;--those of joy,  anger, grief, terror, and every affection of the mind, and to commit it  living to his tablets; and thus,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4011"],[0,"Epicoene; Or, The Silent Woman (#20)"],[1," unjust thou art presently. Clerimont, say     it was Dauphine's plot.     [EXIT CLERIMONT.]     Trust me not, if the whole drift be not for thy good. There is a     carpet in the next room, put it on, with this scarf over thy face,     and a cushion on thy head, and be ready when I call Amorous.     Away!     [EXIT DAUP.]     John Daw!     [GOES TO DAW'S CLOSET AND BRINGS HIM OUT.]       DAW: What good news, sir?       TRUE: Faith, I have followed and argued with him hard for you. I     told him you were a knight, and a scholar, and that you knew     fortitude did consist magis patiendo quam faciendo, magis ferendo     quam feriendo.       DAW: It doth so indeed, sir.       TRUE: And that you would suffer, I told him: so at first he     demanded by my troth, in my conceit, too much.       DAW: What was it, sir.       TRUE: Your upper lip, and six of your fore-teeth.       DAW: 'Twas unreasonable.       TRUE: Nay, I told him plainly, you could not spare them all.     So after long argument pro et con as you know, I brought him     down to your two butter-teeth, and them he would have.       DAW: O, did you so? Why, he shall have them.       TRUE: But he shall not, sir, by your leave. The conclusion is this,     sir: because you shall be very good friends hereafter, and this     never to be remembered or upbraided; besides, that he may not     boast he has done any such thing to you in his own person: he is     to come here in disguise, give you five kicks in private, sir, take     your sword from you, and lock you up in that study during pleasure:     which will be but a little while, we'll get it released presently.       DAW: Five kicks! he shall have six, sir, to be friends.       TRUE: Believe me, you shall not over-shoot yourself, to send him     that word by me.       DAW: Deliver it, sir: he shall have it with all my heart, to be     friends.       TRUE: Friends! Nay, an he should not be so, and heartily too, upon     these terms, he shall have me to enemy while I live. Come, sir, bear     it bravely.       DAW: O lord, sir, 'tis nothing.       TRUE: True: what's six kicks to a man that reads Seneca?       DAW: I have had a hundred, sir.       TRUE: Sir Amorous!     [RE-ENTER DAUPHINE, DISGUISED.]     No speaking one to another, or rehearsing old matters.       DAW [AS DAUPHINE KICKS HIM.]: One, two, three, four, five. I     protest, sir Amorous, you shall have six.       TRUE: Nay, I told you, you should not talk. Come give him six,     an he will needs.     [DAUPHINE KICKS HIM AGAIN.]     --Your sword.     [TAKES HIS SWORD.]     Now return to your safe custody: you shall presently meet     afore the ladies, and be the dearest friends one to another.     [PUTS DAW INTO THE STUDY.]     --Give me the scarf now, thou shalt beat the other bare-faced.     Stand by:     [DAUPHINE RETIRES, AND TRUEWIT GOES TO THE OTHER CLOSET, AND     RELEASES LA-FOOLE.]     --Sir Amorous!       LA-F: What's here? A sword?       TRUE: I cannot help it, without I should take the quarrel upon     myself. Here he has sent you his sword--       LA-F: I will receive none on't.       TRUE: And he wills you to fasten it against a wall, and break     your head in some few several places against the hilts.       LA-F: I will not: tell him roundly. I cannot endure to shed my     own blood.       TRUE: Will you not?       LA-F: No. I'll beat it against a fair flat wall, if that will     satisfy him: if not, he shall beat it himself, for Amorous.       TRUE: Why, this is strange starting off, when a man undertakes     for you! I offer'd him another condition; will you stand to that?       LA-F: Ay, what is't.       TRUE: That you will be beaten in private.       LA-F: Yes, I am content, at the blunt.       [ENTER, ABOVE, HAUGHTY, CENTAURE, MAVIS, MISTRESS OTTER,     EPICOENE, AND TRUSTY.]       TRUE: Then you must submit yourself to be hoodwinked in this     scarf, and be led to him, where he will take your sword from     you, and make you bear a blow over the mouth, gules, and tweaks     by the nose, sans nombre.       LA-F: I am content. But why must I be blinded?       TRUE: That's for your good, sir: because, if he should grow     insolent upon this, and publish it hereafter to your disgrace,     (which I hope he will not do,) you might swear safely, and     protest, he never beat you, to your knowledge.       LA-F: O, I conceive.       TRUE: I do not doubt but you will be perfect good friends upon't,     and not dare to utter an ill thought one of another in future.       LA-F: Not I, as God help me, of him.       TRUE: Nor he of you, sir. If he should     [BLINDS HIS EYES.]     --Come, sir.     [LEADS HIM FORWARD.]     --All hid, sir John.       [ENTER DAUPHINE, AND TWEAKS HIM BY THE NOSE.]       LA-F: O, sir John, sir John! Oh, o--o--o--o--o--Oh--       TRUE: Good, sir John, leave tweaking, you'll blow his nose off.     'Tis sir John's pleasure, you should retire into the study.     [PUTS HIM UP AGAIN.]     --Why, now you are friends. All bitterness between you, I hope,     is buried; you shall come forth by and by, Damon and Pythias     upon't, and embrace with all the rankness of friendship that can     be. I trust, we shall have them tamer in their language hereafter.     Dauphine, I worship thee.--Gods will the ladies have surprised us!       [ENTER HAUGHTY, CENTAURE, MAVIS, MISTRESS OTTER, EPICOENE,     AND TRUSTY, BEHIND.]       HAU: Centaure, how our judgments were imposed on by these     adulterate knights!       Nay, madam, Mavis was more deceived than we, 'twas her     commendation utter'd them in the college.       MAV: I commended but their wits, madam, and their braveries.     I never look'd toward their valours.       HAU: Sir Dauphine is valiant, and a wit too, it seems.       MAV: And a bravery too.       HAU: Was this his project?       MRS. OTT: So master Clerimont intimates, madam.       HAU: Good Morose, when you come to the college, will you bring     him with you? he seems a very perfect gentleman.       EPI: He is so, madam, believe it.       CEN: But when will you come, Morose?       EPI: Three or four days hence, madam, when I have got me a coach     and horses.       HAU: No, to-morrow, good Morose; Centaure shall send you her coach.       MAV: Yes faith, do, and bring sir Dauphine with you.       HAU: She has promised that, Mavis.       MAV: He is a very worthy gentleman in his exteriors, madam.       HAU: Ay, he shews he is judicial in his clothes.       CEN: And yet not so superlatively neat as some, madam, that have     their faces set in a brake.       HAU: Ay, and have every hair in form!       MAV: That wear purer linen then ourselves, and profess more     neatness than the French hermaphrodite!       EPI: Ay, ladies, they, what they tell one of us, have told a     thousand; and are the only thieves of our fame: that think to     take us with that perfume, or with that lace, and laugh at us     unconscionably when they have done.       HAU: But, sir Dauphine's carelessness becomes him.       CEN: I could love a man for such a nose.       MAV: Or such a leg!       CEN: He has an exceeding good eye, madam.       MAV: And a very good lock.       CEN: Good Morose, bring him to my chamber first.       MRS. OTT: Please your honours to meet at my house, madam.       TRUE: See how they eye thee, man! they are taken, I warrant thee.       [HAUGHTY COMES FORWARD.]       HAU: You have unbraced our brace of knights here, master Truewit.       TRUE: Not I, madam; it was sir Dauphine's ingine: who, if he have     disfurnish'd your ladyship of any guard or service by it, is able     to make the place good again, in himself.       HAU: There is no suspicion of that, sir.       CEN: God so, Mavis, Haughty is kissing.       MAV: Let us go too, and take part.       [THEY COME FORWARD.]       HAU: But I am glad of the fortune (beside the discovery of two     such empty caskets) to gain the knowledge of so rich a mine of     virtue as sir Dauphine.       CEN: We would be all glad to style him of our friendship, and see     him at the college.       MAV: He cannot mix with a sweeter society, I'll prophesy; and     I hope he himself will think so.       DAUP: I should be rude to imagine otherwise, lady.       TRUE: Did not I tell thee, Dauphine? Why, all their actions are     governed by crude opinion, without reason or cause; they know not     why they do any thing: but, as they are inform'd, believe, judge,     praise, condemn, love, hate, and in emulation one of another, do     all these things alike. Only they have a natural inclination sways     them generally to the worst, when they are left to themselves.     But pursue it, now thou hast them.       HAU: Shall we go in again, Morose?       EPI: Yes, madam.       CEN: We'll entreat sir Dauphine's company.       TRUE: Stay, good madam, the interview of the two friends, Pylades     and Orestes: I'll fetch them out to you straight.       HAU: Will you, master Truewit?       DAUP: Ay, but noble ladies, do not confess in your countenance,     or outward bearing to them, any discovery of their follies, that     we may see how they will bear up again, with what assurance and     erection.       HAU: We will not, sir Dauphine.       CEN. MAV: Upon our honours, sir Dauphine.       TRUE [GOES TO THE FIRST CLOSET.]: Sir Amorous, sir Amorous!     The ladies are here.       LA-F [WITHIN.]: Are they?       TRUE: Yes; but slip out by and by, as their backs are turn'd,     and meet sir John here, as by chance, when I call you.     [goes to the other.]     --Jack Daw.       DAW: What say you, sir?       TRUE: Whip out behind me suddenly, and no anger in your looks to     your adversary. Now, now!
