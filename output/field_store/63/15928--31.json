Mrs. Orr  but stands as a type illustrating far too many mortally wearisome,  social pretenders, prominent only through the tireless tiresomeness of  their much speaking.    The wreckage which may follow a single unthought crudity, in a home  otherwise exceptional, is signally illustrated in the life of Mrs.  Orr's only child, Hortense, born two years after their marriage. From  the first she was sensitive and high-strung, nervously damaged  probably in her early years by her mother's restless, unwise overcare.  When Hortense was five she was sharply ill for several weeks with  scarlatina. During these days she was isolated with Mrs. Place, her  nurse, in a wing of the home. As fortune would have it, Mrs. Place was  the daughter of a rural English clergyman. After the death of her  husband, who left her limited in means, she came to America, where she  trained. Her wholesome influence over Hortense, her general demeanor  in the home, and her many excellent qualifications as nurse and woman  attracted Mr. Orr's discerning attention, and he induced her to remain  as governess to his daughter. Mrs. Place proved a most excellent  addition to the Orr household. Always deferential, she was never  servile; always reserved, she ever faced duties large and small,  promptly, quietly and efficiently. Never, through her nearly ten years  as daily companion of Hortense, did her speech or conduct betoken  aught but refinement. More and more Hortense retreated to her  wholesome companionship in face of the assaults of her mother's trying  volubility. In many ways this most unusual nurse protected her charge  from the greater damage of poor mothering than actually occurred. The  differences between these two women were reflected in the sensitive  child's life. Unconsciously at first, later in certain details,  ultimately without reserve, she approved the standards of the one and  repudiated those of the other. In contrast to her mother she grew into  an abnormal reserve.    Hortense never attended the public schools but was regularly taught by  Mrs. Place until she was fifteen, when she went East and entered her  mother's old school, in Washington. The years of her careful tutoring  had failed to accustom her to competition of any kind, and this first  year of school work was taxing and but indifferently successful.  During the spring term she had measles which left her with a hacking  cough, and she did not regain her lost weight. The school-doctor sent  her home, \"for the southern climate,\" where she remained for a year,  rather frail and the object of much detailed, maternal solicitude. It  was probably this same solicitude which finally became so wearying  that she returned to school for relief. Hortense was now a year  behind, but resented the rather superior airs of some of her old  classmates so effectively that she got down to business, made up her  back work, and graduated reasonably well up in her entrance class. Of  light build, and always frail in appearance, she did commendable work  in school athletics. She took private instruction in hockey, for she  was determined \"to make the team,\" and her success in accomplishing  this is significant of her ability to do, when she willed. At one of  the later inter-scholastic games she met a handsome, manly, George  Washington University student. She was nineteen, he twenty-three, and  on his commencement day he honored her by offering his hand. Her  southern love was aglow. Her lover was practically making his own way,  but his prospects were excellent, his character superior, and they  both cared very much.    Unhappily, Mrs. Place had returned to England, or Hortense would have  confided in her and some futures might have been different. But the  warmth of the new love seemed at the time to dissipate the chilliness  toward her mother, which, unexpressed to herself, had through the  years been increasing in the daughter's heart. So she wrote a long  letter full of the beautiful story of the growing happiness, with  pages of fervid descriptions of a certain fine young fellow, and  importuned her mother to come East at once and to bring her blessing.  No such filial warmth had Mrs. Orr ever before known. No such  opportunity for a beneficent expression of the high privilege of  motherhood had ever been entrusted to her. She responded without  hesitation. She did not even wait to read their daughter's letter to  her husband. When she reached Washington she summoned the young suitor  to her hotel, and succeeded in one masterful quarter of an hour in  arousing his violent dislike and lasting contempt. Through diplomacy  she got Hortense on the Memphis-bound train. She was determined that  her \"darling child\" should never marry beneath her station, and she  talked and talked, drowning her daughter's protests, appeals and  objections, in her merciless flow of words. Night after night she  would stay with her till after twelve, leaving the poor girl tense,  distracted and sleepless. And the habit of sleeplessness developed and  with it a painfully abnormal sensitiveness to noises. The cruelly  disappointed girl rapidly went to pieces. She craved a woman's  sympathy, she longed for a mother's comprehending love, but she soon  came to dread even her mother's presence, and formed the habit of  burying her ears in the pillows to shut out the sound of that voice  which could have meant the sweetest music of all, yet which to her  distraught nerves had become an irritating, repelling, hated noise.  Then special nurses came; the hot months were spent in the Rockies;  several sea-trips were made; twice patient and nurse went East to  forget it all in weeks of concerts and theaters in New York. But her  inability to sleep was but temporarily relieved, while her antagonism  to noises increased. She was then in Philadelphia for six months under  the care of a noted neurologist, where she slowly gained considerably,  physically, and was sufficiently well to spend a short, social \"coming  out season\" with her parents. Yet the \"at homes\" and tea-parties and  functions in which her mother reveled, never more than superficially  interested her.    Rather strangely, father and daughter had not been as close as their  similar natures and needs would suggest. While Mrs. Orr may not have  been jealous, she preempted her husband's home hours mercilessly; but  in her father's death Hortense came to know that one of the few props  of her stability had been removed. Moreover, her mother's incessant  reiteration of her loneliness and sorrow, and the endless discussion  of the details of her depressing widow's weeds, and of her taxing,  exhausting widow's responsibilities, brought on a return of the old  symptoms, with the antipathy to noises even intensified. We may think  of Hortense Orr as inherently weak. This is not so. Save as influenced  in her girlhood by Mrs. Place, and while stimulated during her last  three years at school by personal ambition, she had known no duties  nor responsibilities. There had never been any necessity for specific  effort or sacrifice. After her great disappointment she had  surrendered to depression of spirit, and she reacted in the same way  after her father's death. And this surrender was early followed by  weakness of her disused body. She also surrendered to the weakness of  self-pity, that craven mocker of self-respect. She was not a will-less  girl, but life had brought her small chance to develop that will which  masters, while wilfulness, that will which demands selfishly for self,  grew out of the soil so largely of her mother's preparing. This  wilfulness, first asserted in small things, grew and grew.    The family doctor saw more than tongue and liver and thin blood and  bodily weakness. He realized the helplessness of Hortense in finding  her stronger self in the home atmosphere, and advised a year in  Europe--to get away from her sorrow, he said, to get away from her  mother's wearying discussion of details, he knew. For nearly a year  she was treated in Germany at different cures without benefit. It was  always the \"noise\" that kept her from sleeping. It was the \"noise\"  which she had learned to hate and to revile. To get away from noise  became her fixed determination. And to this end a small mountain-  cottage was secured, secluded from the haunts and industries of man,  in the remoteness of the Tyrolean Alps. Here with her nurse and a  servant she remained three years. For the first months she seemed  happier, and took some interest in the inspiring views and rich flora  of her surroundings. But the night did not bring the silence she  willed. She sensed the heavy breathing of her nurse, the movements of  the servant as she turned in her bed, and sometimes even snored, she  knew it! She would spend hours of strained, sleepless attention, alert  to detect another instance of the heartless repetition of this  incriminating sound. She must be alone. She feared nothing so much as  the hated sounds of human activity. So a one-room shack was built a  hundred yards away from her companions, in the deeper solitude of the  forest. Here she slept alone, month after month. But the winters, even  in the Tyrolean foot-hills, are severe at times, and the deadly  monotony of this useless life, and the improvement which she \"knew\"  would come with the perfection of her sleeping arrangements, combined  to decide her to return home, though still an enemy to the unbearable  sounds of the night. Twenty-eight years she had lived with no true  interest in life; neither home, attractions in New York or in Europe,  nor treatment offered by competent and kind specialists had influenced  her one thought away from her willingness to be ill. The nurse, who  had buried herself so long with this poor girl in Europe, was quite  appalled at Mrs. Orr's inconsideration of her daughter's \"sensitive,  nervous state.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59951"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 3 of 3) (#20)"],[1,"6.    42. Pre-Historic America, pp. 5, 6.    43. The remark of Mr. Wilson against the probability of colonies from  different European nations at different times having established  colonies in America may raise the question for a moment, \"Is not  such a contention against the Book of Mormon theory of the origin of  American peoples, since that book distinctly accounts for the peopling  of America by migration of colonies, from the eastern hemisphere?\" The  seeming difficulty is overcome at once when it is remembered that the  several colonies of the Book of Mormon migrations are all of one race.  Lehi's colony was made up of two families and the man Zoram, servant  of Laban. Lehi, it is well know, was an Israelite of the tribe of  Manasseh; Ishmael, the head of the other family, was an Israelite of  the tribe of Ephraim. Zoram was an Israelite, but his tribe is unknown.  Mulek's colony were undoubtedly Jews. So that from the repeopling of  America after the destruction of the Jaredites early in the sixth  century B. C.--so far as Book of Mormon migrations are concerned--the  colonies were all of one race. And we have also seen that even the  Jaredites were an earlier branch of the same race.    44. History of the United States (Marcus Wilson) Book I chapter iii.        CHAPTER XXXV    EXTERNAL EVIDENCES (CONTINUED.)--EVIDENCE OF THE BIBLE.    I.    _The Place of the Patriarch Joseph in Israel.--The Promises to Him_  and His Seed.    It is no part of my purpose to deal at length with any argument that  may be based upon Bible evidences to the truth of the Book of Mormon.  That field is already occupied by others. Indeed from the commencement  it has been one of the chief sources drawn upon by the Elders of the  Church in proof of the claims of the Book of Mormon. [1] I shall treat  that evidence, however, in merely an incidental way, and as deriving  its importance chiefly from the circumstances of its blending in with  the enlarged and general scheme of things pertaining to Israel, and the  work of Messiah brought to light by the Book of Mormon.    In pursuance of this treatment I call attention to the blessing of  Jacob upon the head of his grand sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. It should  be remembered that to Joseph, the son of Jacob, a double portion of  honor was granted in Israel. While no tribe is especially called by  his name, yet two tribes are his through his sons, viz., the tribe of  Ephraim and the tribe of Manasseh. This came about in the following  manner: Reuben, the first born of Jacob, defiled his father's wife,  Bilhah. For which awful crime he lost his place as a prince in the  house of Israel, which place was given indirectly to Joseph. Why I say  indirectly, is because Ephraim, Joseph's younger son, was the one who  received the blessing of the first born, and was placed as the first of  the tribes of Israel. It is for this reason that the Lord was wont to  say, \"I am a Father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first born.\" [2] In  proof of the things here set forth I quote the following:        Now the sons of Reuben, the first born of Israel, (for he was the      firstborn; but, forasmuch as he defiled his father's bed, his      birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph, the son of Israel:      and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright. For      Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief      ruler, but the birthright was Joseph's. [3]    That is, not after the natural birthright, but after the birthright  appointment made by the patriarch Jacob to Ephraim. Ephraim, then, will  take the place of Reuben--the place of the firstborn. But there was  also a tribe of Manasseh in Israel, as well as of Ephraim, and thus  was a double portion given unto Joseph in that from him are two tribes  in Israel. And now as to further blessings conferred upon Joseph and  his sons. When Jacob and his son Joseph were restored to each other  in Egypt, the old patriarch rejoiced to see the two sons of Joseph,  Ephraim and Manasseh--and now the Bible narrative:        And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed      himself with his face to the earth. And Joseph took them both,      Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh      in his left hand towards Israel's right hand, and brought them near      unto him. And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it      upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon      Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the      firstborn.        And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers      Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long      unto this day, the angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the      lads and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers      Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst      of the earth. And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right      hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him; and he held up      his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's      head. And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father; for      this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head. And his      father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it; he also      shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his      younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become      a multitude of nations. And he blessed them that day, saying, In      thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as      Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh. [4]    Again when the patriarch Jacob gave his final blessing to his sons, of  Joseph he said:        Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose      branches run over the wall: The archers have sorely grieved him,      and shot at him, and hated him: but his bow abode in strength, and      the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mightily      God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel):      Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the      Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,      blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts,      and of the womb; the blessings of thy father have prevailed above      the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bounds of the      everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the      crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren. [5]    Moses also seems to have been impressed with the idea that Joseph was  to receive a portion above his brethren; for in blessing the tribes of  Israel, when coming to Joseph, he said:        Blessed of the Lord be his land, for the precious things of heaven,      for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath, and for the      precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious      things put forth by the moon, and for the chief things of the      ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting      hills, and for the precious things of the earth and fullness      thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let      the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the      head of him that was separated from his brethren. His glory is like      the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of      unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends      of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they      are the thousands of Manasseh. [6]    A comparison of the blessings of the other tribes with the blessings of  Joseph's will convince him who makes it how much greater are to be the  blessings of Joseph than those of his brethren, especially in respect  of the extent and the fruitfulness of the lands that his descendants  shall occupy. Furthermore, in view of all that is said in these  prophetic utterances, there can be no question but what the descendants  of Joseph, the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, are to be very prominent  in the affairs of Israel and take an important part in God's great  drama in which he will work out the restoration of his people, Israel,  and the redemption of the world.    Summarizing these prophetic blessings we may say, that to the tribe of  Ephraim is given the place and honor of the first born in Israel; that  to him pertains the \"pushing of the people together\"--Ephraim's part  in the gathering of Israel in the last days; that the seed of Manasseh  is to become a great people, while Ephraim is to become a multitude  of nations--greater than Manasseh, as is becoming to the tribe of the  first born--\"they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the  thousands of Manasseh;\" that the land possessed by Joseph's posterity  is to be peculiarly great and fruitful, blessed with the precious  things of heaven, with the precious fruits brought forth by the sun,  for the chief things of the ancient mountains, for the precious things  of the lasting hills, and for the precious things of the earth and the  fullness thereof; that Joseph is as a fruitful bough whose branches run  over the wall (i. e., his possessions extend in some way beyond the  recognized boundaries of Israel's Palestine inheritance); that Joseph's  arms and hands shall be made strong by the hands of the mighty God of  Jacob; that the God of Israel shall help Joseph and bless him with the  blessings of heaven above, of the deep, of the breasts, and of the womb  (i. e., he shall be blessed in his posterity); that the blessings of  Jacob had prevailed above the blessings of his progenitors, \"unto the  utmost bounds of the everlasting hills,\" (perhaps a greater territorial  inheritance); that these blessings of Jacob which had \"prevailed\" above  (i. e., exceeded) the blessings of his progenitors, should be "]]]
