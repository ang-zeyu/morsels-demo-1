Don't forget to be on hand when the train  stops, however. I never saw your equal as a luggage carrier.\"    One by one the five girls leaned against the comfortable backs of their  seats and closed their eyes. Mrs. Gibson became absorbed in the pages of  a new book.    Grace dozed for a brief space and then opening her eyes gazed idly about  her. The seat on which she sat had been reversed in order that she and  Nora might face Mrs. Gibson and Miriam. Their seats being near to the  middle of the car, she could obtain a good view of a number of the other  passengers. She noticed that the car was very full, every seat being  occupied.    Her eye rested for a second upon a portly, well-dressed old gentleman in  the last seat of the car, who was leaning back with closed eyes, then  traveled on to the man who shared the seat.    \"What a remarkable face that man has,\" she thought. \"He looks like a  combination of a snake and a fox. I never before saw such tricky eyes.  He is rather good looking, but there is something about him that  frightens one.\"    Grace found herself watching, with a kind of fascination, every move  that the stranger made. Once her eyes met his and she shuddered  slightly, there was a world of refined cruelty in their depths. She  looked out of the window as the train rushed on through the darkness,  then almost against her will turned her eyes again in the direction of  the repellent stranger.    But what she saw this time caused her to stare in amazement. The  stranger under cover of a newspaper was bent on extracting the handsome  watch and chain that the elderly gentleman's open coat displayed.  Although the paper hid the movement of his hands, Grace divined by the  expression of the man's face what was taking place behind the paper  screen.    Like a flash she was out of her seat and down the aisle. But quick as  had been her movement, the thief was quicker. He straightened up, coolly  turned to his paper, looking up at her with an air of bored inquiry as  she paused before him.    Ignoring him completely, she touched the old man on the shoulder and  said in a low tone, \"Please pardon me, but if you value your watch you  had better look to it. I just saw this man attempting to steal it.\"    The old gentleman bounded up like a rubber ball, saying excitedly, \"What  do you mean, young woman?\"    \"Just what I say,\" replied Grace.    The thief gave Grace a contemptuous look, then without stirring, said  lazily, \"The young lady is entirely mistaken. She must have been  dreaming.\"    \"I repeat my accusation,\" said Grace firmly. \"I have been watching you  for some time, and I saw you attempt it.\"    The old gentleman put his hand to his vest and drew out a particularly  fine old-fashioned gold watch.    \"My watch is safe enough,\" he growled testily, \"and so is my chain. Any  one who steals from me will have to be pretty smart. I guess if this man  had laid hands on my watch I'd have known it. Can't fool me.\"    \"Certainly not,\" responded the tricky stranger. \"If I were a thief you  would be the last person I should attempt to practice upon.\"    \"I should say so,\" grumbled the old gentleman. \"Young woman, you have  let your imagination run away with you. Be careful in the future or you  may get yourself into serious trouble. This gentleman has taken your  nonsense very good-naturedly.\"    As the two men were occupying the seat nearest the door, save for the  old gentleman's first bounce, the little scene had been so quietly  enacted that the other passengers were paying little attention to the  trio.    \"You had better go back to your friends,\" said the man whom Grace had  accused, looking at her with cold hatred in his eyes. \"That is, unless  you wish to make yourself ridiculous.\"    Grace turned away without speaking. There were tears of mortification in  her eyes. She had attempted to render a service and had been rudely  rebuffed. She slipped into her place beside Nora, who was dozing, and  had not missed her. Mrs. Gibson, too, had not marked her absence.    \"Where were you, Grace?\" said Miriam curiously. \"I opened my eyes and  you were gone. What's the matter? You look ready to cry.\"    \"I am,\" replied Grace. \"I could cry with sheer vexation.\" Then she  briefly recounted what had occurred.    \"What a crusty old man,\" sympathized Miriam. \"It would serve him right  if he did lose his old watch. Where are they sitting?\"    \"Down the aisle on the other side at the end,\" directed Grace.    Miriam turned around in her seat. \"He looks capable of most anything,\"  she remarked after a prolonged stare at the stranger, who was apparently  absorbed in his paper. \"Are you sure, however, that you were not  mistaken, Grace? You can't always judge a man by his looks.\"    \"You can this man,\" asserted Grace. \"He is a polite villain of the  deepest dye, and I know it.\"    It was after eleven o'clock when the train pulled into Oakdale. Mrs.  Gibson's chauffeur awaited them with the big touring car, in which there  was ample room for all of them.    \"Keep a sharp lookout for that man,\" whispered Grace to Miriam. \"I want  to see if Oakdale is his destination.\"    The two girls lagged behind the others, eagerly scanning the platform.    \"I think he must have gone on,\" said Miriam. \"I don't see him. Don't  worry any more about him, Grace.\"    Then she walked on ahead.    But Grace lingered. \"That looks like him now,\" she thought. \"He is just  leaving the train. He seems to be waiting for some one.\"    She stood in the shadow of the station watching the man. Then she saw  another man rapidly approaching. The newcomer walked straight up to the  stranger and shook hands with him. Then the two men turned and she  obtained a full-face view of them both.    Grace gave a little gasp of surprise, for the newcomer who had shaken  the hand of the crook was Henry Hammond.          CHAPTER XX    MARIAN'S CONFESSION      Grace reached home that night with her head in a whirl. She could think  of nothing save the fact that she had seen Henry Hammond warmly welcome  a man whom she knew in her heart to be a professional crook. It formed  the first link in the chain of evidence she hoped to forge against him.  She had become so strongly imbued with the idea that Hammond was an  impostor that the incident at the station only served to confirm her  belief.    The Phi Sigma Tau were besieged with questions the next day, and at  recess the five members held forth separately to groups of eager and  admiring girls on the glories of the visit.    \"Where is Marian Barber?\" asked Grace of Ruth Deane, as they were  leaving the senior locker-room at the close of the noon recess.    \"She hasn't been in school to-day,\" replied Ruth. \"I suppose what  happened Friday was too much for her.\"    \"What happened Friday?\" repeated Grace. \"Well, what did happen?\"    \"Oh, Eleanor Savelli and Marian had a quarrel in the locker-room. I was  the only one who heard it, and I shouldn't have stayed but I know  Eleanor of old, and I made up my mind that I had better stay and see  that Marian had fair play. But I might as well have stayed away, for I  wasn't of any use to either side. In fact, I doubt if either one  realized I was there, they were so absorbed in their own troubles.\"    \"It's a wonder that I wasn't around,\" remarked Grace. \"I am really glad,  however, that I wasn't. The Phi Sigma Tau were all in Miss Tebbs'  classroom at recess last Friday. Miss Tebbs is a dear friend of the  Southards, you know. She was invited to go with us, but had made a  previous engagement that she could not break. We were talking things  over with her. After school we all went straight home and I saw neither  Eleanor nor Marian. Have you any idea what it was about?\"    \"I don't know,\" returned Ruth bluntly. \"Marian and Eleanor came into the  locker-room together. I heard Marian say something about telling Eleanor  what she had in confidence. Then Eleanor just laughed scornfully and  told Marian that she had told her secrets to the wrong person. Marian  grew very angry, and called Eleanor treacherous and revengeful, and  Eleanor said that Marian's opinion was a matter of indifference to her.    \"Then she told Marian that she intended to call a class meeting for  Thursday of this week and entertain them with the very interesting  little story that Marian had told her the previous week.    \"Marian wilted at that and cried like a baby, but Eleanor kept on  laughing at her, and said that she would know better another time, and  perhaps would think twice before she spoke once. She said that no one  could trample upon her with impunity.\"    \"Oh, pshaw,\" exclaimed Grace impatiently. \"She always says that when she  is angry. She said that last year.\"    \"Well, Marian cried some more,\" continued Ruth, \"and Eleanor made a  number of other spiteful remarks and walked out with a perfectly hateful  look of triumph on her face.\"    \"And what about Marian?\" asked Grace.    \"She didn't go back to the study hall. She told Miss Thompson that she  was ill and went home.\"    \"Poor Marian,\" said Grace. \"She certainly has been very foolish to leave  her real friends and put her faith in people like Eleanor and that Henry  Hammond. I have been afraid all along that she would be bitterly  disillusioned. I think I'd better go to see her to-night.\"    \"Why, I thought she wasn't on speaking terms with the Phi Sigma Tau!\"  exclaimed Ruth.    \"Speaking terms or not, I'm going to find out what the trouble is and  straighten it out if I can. Please don't tell that to any one, Ruth. I  don't imagine it's anything serious. Eleanor always goes to extremes.\"    \"Trust me, Grace, not to say a word,\" was the response.    \"I wish Anne were here,\" mused Grace, as she took her seat and drew out  her text-book on second year French.

The moon breaks          through the clouds, and lights up the funeral          procession with increasing clearness as it reaches          the top of the hill. A mist has risen from the          Rhine which gradually fills the whole stage, on          which the funeral procession has become invisible.
