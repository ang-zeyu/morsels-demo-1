[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3721"],[0,"France and England in North America, Part I: Pioneers of France in the New World (#20)"],[1,"    Again Menendez returned triumphant to St. Augustine, and behind him  marched his band of butchers, steeped in blood to the elbows, but still  unsated. Great as had been his success, he still had cause for anxiety.  There was ill news of his fleet. Some of the ships were lost, others  scattered, or lagging tardily on their way. Of his whole force, less  than a half had reached Florida, and of these a large part were still at  Fort Caroline. Ribaut could not be far off; and, whatever might be the  condition of his shipwrecked company, their numbers would make them  formidable, unless taken at advantage. Urged by fear and fortified by  fanaticism, Menendez had well begun his work of slaughter; but rest for  him there was none,--a darker deed was behind.    On the tenth of October, Indians came with the tidings that, at the spot  where the first party of the shipwrecked French had been found, there  was now another party still larger. This murder-loving race looked  with great respect on Menendez for his wholesale butchery of the night  before,--an exploit rarely equalled in their own annals of massacre.  On his part, he doubted not that Ribaut was at hand. Marching with a  hundred and fifty men, he crossed the bush-covered sands of Anastasia  Island, followed the strand between the thickets and the sea, reached  the inlet at midnight, and again, like a savage, ambushed himself on  the bank. Day broke, and he could plainly see the French on the farther  side. They had made a raft, which lay in the water ready for crossing.  Menendez and his men showed themselves, when, forthwith, the French  displayed their banners, sounded drums and trumpets, and set their sick  and starving ranks in array of battle. But the Adelantado, regardless  of this warlike show, ordered his men to seat themselves at breakfast,  while he with three officers walked unconcernedly along the shore. His  coolness had its effect. The French blew a trumpet of parley, and showed  a white flag. The Spaniards replied. A Frenchman came out upon the raft,  and, shouting across the water, asked that a Spanish envoy should be  sent over.    \"You have a raft,\" was the reply; \"come yourselves.\"    An Indian canoe lay under the bank on the Spanish side. A French sailor  swam to it, paddled back unmolested, and presently returned, bringing  with him La Caille, Ribaut's sergeant-major. He told Menendez that the  French were three hundred and fifty in all, and were on their way to  Fort Caroline; and, like the officers of the former party, he begged for  boats to aid them in crossing the river.    \"My brother,\" said Menendez, \"go and tell your general, that, if he  wishes to speak with me, he may come with four or six companions, and  that I pledge my word he shall go back safe.\"    La Caille returned; and Ribaut, with eight gentlemen, soon came over  in the canoe. Menendez met them courteously, caused wine and preserved  fruits to be placed before them,--he had come well provisioned on his  errand of blood,--and next led Ribaut to the reeking Golgotha, where,  in heaps upon the sand, lay the corpses of his slaughtered followers.  Ribaut was prepared for the spectacle,--La Caille had already seen  it,--but he would not believe that Fort Caroline was taken till a part  of the plunder was shown him. Then, mastering his despair, he turned  to the conqueror. \"What has befallen us,\" he said, \"may one day befall  you.\" And, urging that the kings of France and Spain were brothers  and close friends, he begged, in the name of that friendship, that the  Spaniard would aid him in conveying his followers home. Menendez gave  him the same equivocal answer that he had given the former party, and  Ribaut returned to consult with his officers. After three hours of  absence, he came back in the canoe, and told the Adelantado that some of  his people were ready to surrender at discretion, but that many refused.    \"They can do as they please,\" was the reply. In behalf of those who  surrendered, Ribaut offered a ransom of a hundred thousand ducats. \"It  would much grieve me,\" said Menendez, \"not to accept it; for I have  great need of it.\"    Ribaut was much encouraged. Menendez could scarcely forego such a  prize, and he thought, says the Spanish narrator, that the lives of  his followers would now be safe. He asked to be allowed the night for  deliberation, and at sunset recrossed the river. In the morning he  reappeared among the Spaniards, and reported that two hundred of his men  had retreated from the spot, but that the remaining hundred and fifty  would surrender. At the same time he gave into the hands of Menendez the  royal standard and other flags, with his sword, dagger, helmet, buckler,  and the official seal given him by Coligny. Menendez directed an officer  to enter the boat and bring over the French by tens. He next led Ribaut  among the bushes behind the neighboring sand-hill, and ordered his hands  to be bound fast. Then the scales fell from the prisoner's eyes. Face  to face his fate rose up before him. He saw his followers and himself  entrapped,--the dupes of words artfully framed to lure them to their  ruin. The day wore on; and, as band after band of prisoners was brought  over, they were led behind the sand-hill out of sight from the farther  shore, and bound like their general. At length the transit was finished.  With bloodshot eyes and weapons bared, the Spaniards closed around their  victims.    \"Are you Catholics or Lutherans? and is there any one among you who will  go to confession?\"    Ribaut answered, \"I and all here are of the Reformed Faith.\"    And he recited the Psalm, \"Domine, memento mei.\"    \"We are of earth,\" he continued, \"and to earth we must return; twenty  years more or less can matter little;\" and, turning to the Adelantado,  he bade him do his will.    The stony-hearted bigot gave the signal; and those who will may paint to  themselves the horrors of the scene.    A few, however, were spared. \"I saved,\" writes Menendez, \"the lives of  two young gentlemen of about eighteen years of age, as well as of three  others, the fifer, the drummer, and the trumpeter; and I caused Juan  Ribao [Ribaut] with all the rest to be put to the knife, judging this to  be necessary for the service of God our Lord and of your Majesty. And I  consider it great good fortune that he [Juan Ribao] should be dead, for  the King of France could effect more with him and five hundred ducats  than with other men and five thousand; and he would do more in one year  than another in ten, for he was the most experienced sailor and naval  commander known, and of great skill in this navigation of the Indies  and the coast of Florida. He was, besides, greatly liked in England,  in which kingdom his reputation was such that he was appointed  Captain-General of all the English fleet against the French Catholics in  the war between England and France some years ago.\"    Such is the sum of the Spanish accounts,--the self-damning testimony  of the author and abettors of the crime; a picture of lurid and awful  coloring; and yet there is reason to believe that the truth was darker  still. Among those who were spared was one Christophe le Breton, who  was carried to Spain, escaped to France, and told his story to Challeux.  Among those struck down in the butchery was a sailor of Dieppe, stunned  and left for dead under a heap of corpses. In the night he revived,  contrived to draw his knife, cut the cords that bound his hands, and  made his way to an Indian village. The Indians, not without reluctance,  abandoned him to the Spaniards, who sold him as a slave; but, on his way  in fetters to Portugal, the ship was taken by the Huguenots, the sailor  set free, and his story published in the narrative of Le Moyne. When the  massacre was known in France, the friends and relatives of the victims  sent to the King, Charles the Ninth, a vehement petition for redress;  and their memorial recounts many incidents of the tragedy. From these  three sources is to be drawn the French version of the story. The  following is its substance.    Famished and desperate, the followers of Ribaut were toiling northward  to seek refuge at Fort Caroline, when they found the Spaniards in their  path. Some were filled with dismay; others, in their misery, almost  hailed them as deliverers. La Caille, the sergeant-major, crossed the  river. Menendez met him with a face of friendship, and protested that he  would spare the lives of the shipwrecked men, sealing the promise  with an oath, a kiss, and many signs of the cross. He even gave it in  writing, under seal. Still, there were many among the French who would  not place themselves in his power. The most credulous crossed the river  in a boat. As each successive party landed, their hands were bound fast  at their backs; and thus, except a few who were set apart, they were all  driven towards the fort, like cattle to the shambles, with curses and  scurrilous abuse. Then, at sound of drums and trumpets, the Spaniards  fell upon them, striking them down with swords, pikes, and halberds.  Ribaut vainly called on the Adelantado to remember his oath. By his  order, a soldier plunged a dagger into the French commander's heart; and  Ottigny, who stood near, met a similar fate. Ribaut's beard was cut off,  and portions of it sent in a letter to Philip the Second. His head was  hewn into four parts, one of which was displayed on the point of a lance  at each corner of Fort St. Augustine. Great fires were kindled, and the  bodies of the murdered burned to ashes.    Such is the sum of the French accounts. The charge of breach of faith  contained in them was believed by Catholics as well as Protestants;  and it was as a defence against this charge that the narrative of the  Adelantado's brother-in-law was published. That Ribaut, a man whose good  sense and courage were both reputed high, should have submitted himself  and his men to Menendez without"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37215"],[0,"The Argus Pheasant (#20)"],[1,"Van Slyck, I am sure of that. You will find him a good man--a  little proud, perhaps, and headstrong, like all these soldiers, but an  experienced officer.\" Muller nodded sagely.    \"I am glad to hear that,\" Peter Gross replied. \"The work is a little new  to me--I presume you know that?\"    \"So I heard, _mynheer_. This is your first post as resident?\"    Peter Gross's eyelids quivered a trifle. Muller's admission revealed  that he had had correspondence with Ah Sing, for from no other source  could the news have leaked out.    \"This is my first post,\" he acknowledged.    \"Possibly you have served as _controlleur_?\" Muller suggested.    \"I am a sailor,\" Peter Gross replied. \"This is my first state  appointment.\"    \"Then my experience may be of value to you, _mynheer_,\" Muller declared  happily. \"You understand accounts, of course?\"    \"In a measure. But I am more a sailor than a supercargo, _mynheer_.\"    \"To be sure, to be sure,\" Muller acquiesced heartily. \"A sailor to the  sea and to fighting in the bush, and a penman to his books. Leave the  accounts to me; I will take care of them for you, _mynheer_. You will  have plenty to do, keeping the tribes in order. It was more than I could  do. These Dyaks and Malays are good fighters.\"    \"So I have been told,\" Peter Gross assented dryly.    \"They told you correctly, _mynheer_. But they will get a stern master  now--we have heard of your work at Lombock, _mynheer_.\"    The broad compliment was accompanied by an even broader smile. Muller  was very much pleased with himself, and thought he was handling a  delicate situation in a manner that Van Slyck himself could not have  improved upon.    Peter Gross's gravity did not relax. \"How are the natives? Do you have  much difficulty?\" he inquired.    Muller assumed a wobegone expression. \"_Ach, mynheer_,\" he exclaimed  dolorously, \"those hill Dyaks are devils. It is one raid after another;  they will not let us alone. The rice-fields are swept bare. What the  Dyaks do not get, the floods and typhoons get, and the weevils eat the  stubble. We have not had a crop in two years. The rice we gathered for  taxes from those villages where there was a little blessing on the  harvest we had to distribute among the villages where the crop failed to  keep our people from starving. That is why we could not ship to Batavia.  I wish his excellency would come here himself and see how things are; he  would not be so critical about the taxes that are not paid.\"    \"Do the coast Dyaks ever make trouble?\" Peter Gross asked.    Muller glanced at him shrewdly.    \"It is the hill Dyaks who begin it, _mynheer_. Sometimes my coast Dyaks  lose their heads when their crops are burned and their wives and  children are stolen, but that is not often. We can control them better  than we can the hill people, for they are nearer us. Of course a man  runs amuck occasionally, but that you find everywhere.\"    \"I hear there is a half-white woman who wields a great influence over  them,\" Peter Gross remarked. \"Who is she?\"    \"You mean Koyala, _mynheer_. A wonderful woman with a great influence  over her people; they would follow her to death. That was a wise act,  _mynheer_, to persuade his excellency to cancel the offer he made for  her person. Bulungan will not forget it. You could not have done  anything that pleases the people more.\"    \"She is very beautiful, I have heard,\" Peter Gross remarked pensively.    Muller glanced at him sharply, and a quick spasm of jealousy contracted  his features. The resident might like a pretty face, too, was his  instant thought; it was an angle he had not bargained for. This Mynheer  Gross was strong and handsome, young--altogether a dangerous rival. His  mellow good nature vanished.    \"That depends on what you call beauty,\" he said surlily. \"She is a  witch-woman, and half Dyak.\"    Peter Gross looked up in pretended surprise.    \"Well, _mynheer_, I am astonished. They told me in Batavia--\" He checked  himself abruptly.    \"What did they tell you in Batavia?\" Muller demanded eagerly.    Peter Gross shook his head. \"I should not have spoken, _mynheer_. It was  only idle gossip.\"    \"Tell me, _mynheer_,\" Muller pleaded. \"_Lieve hemel_, this is the first  time in months that some one has told me that Batavia still remembers  Muller of Bulungan.\"    \"It was only idle rumor,\" Peter Gross deprecated. \"I was told you were  going to marry--naturally I believed--but of course as you say it's  impossible--\"    \"I to marry?\" Muller exclaimed. \"Who? Koyala?\"    Peter Gross's silence was all the confirmation the _controlleur_ needed.  A gratified smile spread over his face; he was satisfied now that the  resident had no intention of being his rival.    \"They say that in Batavia?\" he asked. \"Well, between you and me,  _mynheer_, I would have to look far for a fairer bride.\"    \"Let me congratulate you,\" Peter Gross began, but Muller stayed him.    \"No, not yet, _mynheer_. What I have said is for your ears alone.  Remember, you know nothing.\"    \"Your confidence is safe with me,\" Peter Gross assured him.    Muller suddenly recollected his duties as host.    \"Ho, _mynheer_, you must have some Hollands with me,\" he cried  hospitably. \"A toast to our good fellowship.\" He clapped his hands and  Cho Seng appeared in the doorway.    \"A glass of lemonade or iced tea, if you please,\" Peter Gross stated.    \"You are a teetotaler?\" Muller cried in dismay.    \"As resident of Bulungan, yes, _mynheer_. A servant of the state cannot  be too careful.\"    Muller laughed. \"Lemonade and _jenever_, Cho Seng,\" he directed. \"Well,  _mynheer_, I'll wager you are the only resident in all the colonies that  will not take his glass of Hollands. If it were not for _jenever_ many  of us could not live in this inferno. Sometimes it is well to be able to  forget for a short time.\"    \"If one has a burdened conscience,\" Peter Gross conditioned quietly.    Muller started. He intuitively felt the words were not idle observation,  and he glanced at Peter Gross doubtfully. The resident was looking over  the broad expanse of sea, and presently remarked:    \"You have a splendid view here, _mynheer_. I hope the outlook from my  house is half so good.\"    Muller roused himself. \"That is so, _mynheer_,\" he said. \"I had almost  forgotten; we will have to put your house in order at once. It has not  been occupied for two years, and will need a thorough cleaning.  Meanwhile you must be my guest.\"    \"I thank you, _mynheer_,\" Peter Gross replied quietly.    \"You will have an establishment, _mynheer_?\" Muller asked curiously.  \"Have you brought servants? If not, I shall be glad to loan you Cho  Seng.\"    \"Thank you, I am well provided,\" Peter Gross assured.    Cho Seng padded out on the porch and served them. Being a well-trained  servant, he scarcely glanced at his employer's guest, but Peter Gross  favored him with a thoughtful stare.    \"Your servant has been with you a long time, _mynheer_?\" he inquired  carelessly.    \"A year, _mynheer_. I got him from Batavia. He was recommended by--a  friend.\" The pause was perceptible.    \"His face seems familiar,\" Peter Gross remarked in an offhand manner.  \"But that's probably imagination. It is hard to tell these Chinese  apart.\"    Conscious of having said too much again, Muller made no reply. They  sipped their drinks in silence, Peter Gross thinking deeply the while  why Ah Sing should make a former waiter in his _rumah makan_ Muller's  servant. Presently he said:    \"If it is not too much trouble, _mynheer_, could you show me my house?\"    \"Gladly, _mynheer_,\" Muller exclaimed, rising with alacrity. \"It is only  a few steps. We will go at once.\"    For the next half hour Peter Gross and he rambled through the dwelling.  It was modeled closely after the _controlleur's_ own, with a similar  green and white facade facing the sea. The atmosphere within was damp  and musty, vermin scurried at their approach, but Peter Gross saw that  the building could be made tenable in a few days. At last they came to a  sequestered room on the north side, facing the hills. An almost level  expanse of garden lay back of it.    \"This was Mynheer de Jonge's own apartment,\" Muller explained. \"Here he  did most of his work.\" He sighed heavily. \"He was a fine old man. It is  too bad the good God had to take him away from us.\"    Peter Gross's lips pressed together tightly.    \"Mynheer de Jonge was careless of his health, I hear,\" he remarked. \"One  cannot be too careful in Bulungan. Therefore, _mynheer_, I must ask you  to get me a crew of men busy at once erecting two long houses, after  these plans.\" He took a drawing from his pocket and showed it to Muller.  The _controlleur_ blinked at it with a puzzled frown.    \"These buildings will ruin the view, _mynheer_,\" he expostulated. \"Such  long huts--they are big enough for thirty men. What are they for?\"    \"Protection against the fevers, _mynheer_,\" Peter Gross said dryly. \"The  fevers that killed Mynheer de Jonge.\"           *       *       *       *       *    That evening, when Peter Gross had returned to the ship, Muller and Van  Slyck met to compare notes. The captain was still boiling with anger;  the resident's visit to Fort Wilhelmina had not soothed his ruffled  temper.    \"He told me he brought twenty-five irregulars with him for work in the  bush,\" Van Slyck related. \"They are a separate command, and won't be  quartered in the fort. If this Yankee thinks he can meddle in the  military affairs of the residency he will find he is greatly mistaken.\"    \"Where will they be quartered?\" Muller asked.    \"I don't know.\"    \"Maybe he will place them in the huts he has ordered me to build back of  the residency,\" Muller remarked, rubbing his bald pate thoughtfully.    \"He told you to build some huts?\" Van Slyck asked.    \"Yes, some long huts. Big enough for thirty men. He said they were to be  a protection against the fevers.\"    \"The fevers?\" Van Slyck exclaimed in amazement.    \"Yes,"]]]
