The richness  of the language always permits the choice of the mode, but this very  richness may become a difficulty. It is not impossible that the general  use of foreign tongues in Poland may be attributed to indolence of  mind or want of application; may be traced to a desire to escape the  necessary labor of acquiring that mastery of diction indispensable in  a language so full of sudden depths, of laconic energy, that it is very  difficult, if not quite impossible, to support in it the commonplace.  The vague agreements of badly defined ideas cannot be compressed in the  nervous strength of its grammatical forms; the thought, if it be really  low, cannot be elevated from its debasement or poverty; if it really  soar above the commonplace, it requires a rare precision of terms not  to appear uncouth or fantastic. In consequence of this, in proportion  to the works published, the Polish literature should be able to show a  greater number of chefs-d'oeuvre than can be done in any other language.  He who ventures to use this tongue, must feel himself already master.    [Footnote: It cannot be reproached with a want of harmony or musical  charm. The harshness of a language does not always and absolutely depend  upon the number of consonants, but rather upon the manner of their  association. We might even assert, that in consequence of the absence of  well-determined and strongly marked sounds, some languages have a dull  and cold coloring. It is the frequent repetition of certain consonants  which gives shadow, rhythm, and vigor to a tongue; the vowels imparting  only a kind of light clear hue, which requires to be brought out by  deeper shades. It is the sharp, uncouth, or unharmonious clashing of  heterogeneous consonants which strikes the ear painfully. It is true the  Sclavic languages make use of many consonants, but their connection is  generally sonorous, sometimes pleasant to the ear, and scarcely ever  entirely discordant, even when the combinations are more striking than  agreeable. The quality of the sounds is rich, full, and varied. They  are not straitened and contracted as if produced in a narrow medium, but  extending through a considerable register, range through a variety of  intonations. The letter L, almost impossible for those to pronounce, who  have not acquired the pronunciation in their infancy, has nothing harsh  in its sound. The ear receives from it an impression similar to that  which is made upon the fingers by the touch of a thick woolen velvet,  rough, but at the same time, yielding. The union of jarring consonants  being rare, and the assonances easily multiplied, the same comparison  might be employed to the ensemble of the effect produced by these idioms  upon foreigners. Many words occur in Polish which imitate the sound  of the thing designated by them. The frequent repetition of CH, (h  aspirated,) of SZ, (CH in French,) of RZ, of CZ, so frightful to a  profane eye, have however nothing barbaric in their sounds, being  pronounced nearly like GEAI, and TCHE, and greatly facilitate imitations  of the sense by the sound. The word DZWIEK, (read DZWIINQUE,) meaning  sound, offers a characteristic example of this; it would be difficult to  find a word which would reproduce more accurately the sensation which a  diapason makes upon the ear. Among the consonants accumulated in groups,  producing very different sounds, sometimes metallic, sometimes buzzing,  hissing or rumbling, many diphthongs and vowels are mingled, which  sometimes become slightly nasal, the A and E being sounded as ON and IN,  (in French,) when they are accompanied by a cedilla. In juxtaposition  with the E, (TSE,) which is pronounced with great softness, sometimes C,  (TSIE,) the accented S is almost warbled. The Z has three sounds: the  Z, (JAIS,) the Z, (ZED,) and the Z, (ZIED). The Y forms a vowel of a  muffled tone, which, as the L, cannot be represented by any equivalent  sound in French, and which like it gives a variety of ineffable shades  to the language. These fine and light elements enable the Polish women  to assume a lingering and singing accent, which they usually transport  into other tongues. When the subjects are serious or melancholy, after  such recitatives or improvised lamentations, they have a sort of lisping  infantile manner of speaking, which they vary by light silvery laughs,  little interjectional cries, short musical pauses upon the higher notes,  from which they descend by one knows not what chromatic scale of demi  and quarter tones to rest upon some low note; and again pursue the  varied, brusque and original modulations which astonish the ear not  accustomed to such lovely warblings, to which they sometimes give that  air of caressing irony, of cunning mockery, peculiar to the song of some  birds. They love to ZINZILYLER, and charming changes, piquant intervals,  unexpected cadences naturally find place in this fondling prattle,  making the language far more sweet and caressing when spoken by the  women, than it is in the mouths of the men. The men indeed pride  themselves upon speaking it with elegance, impressing upon it a  masculine sonorousness, which is peculiarly adapted to the energetic  movements of manly eloquence, formerly so much cultivated in Poland.  Poetry commands such a diversity of prosodies, of rhymes, of rhythms,  such an abundance of assonances from these rich and varied materials,  that it is almost possible to follow MUSICALLY the feelings and scenes  which it depicts, not only in mere expressions in which the sound  repeats the sense, but also in long declamations. The analogy between  the Polish and Russian, has been compared to that which obtains between  the Latin and Italian. The Russian language is indeed more mellifluous,  more lingering, more caressing, fuller of sighs than the Polish. Its  cadencing is peculiarly fitted for song. The finer poems, such as those  of Zukowski and Pouchkin, seem to contain a melody already designated in  the metre of the verses; for example, it would appear quite possible  to detach an ARIOSO or a sweet CANTIABLE from some of the stanzas of  LE CHALE NOIR, or the TALISMAN. The ancient Sclavonic, which is the  language of the Eastern Church, possesses great majesty. More guttural  than the idioms which have arisen from it, it is severe and monotonous  yet of great dignity, like the Byzantine paintings preserved in  the worship to which it is consecrated. It has throughout the  characteristics of a sacred language which has only been used for the  expression of one feeling and has never been modulated or fashioned by  profane wants.]    Chopin mingled a charming grace with all the intercourse which he held  with his relatives. Not satisfied with limiting his whole correspondence  to them alone, he profited by his stay in Paris to procure for them the  thousand agreeable surprises given by the novelties, the bagatelles, the  little gifts which charm through their beauty, or attract as being  the first seen of their kind. He sought for all that he had reason to  believe would please his friends in Warsaw, adding constant presents to  his many letters. It was his wish that his gifts should be preserved,  that through the memories linked with them he might be often remembered  by those to whom they were sent. He attached the greatest importance,  on his side, to all the evidences of their affection for him. To receive  news or some mark of their remembrance, was always a festival for him.  He never shared this pleasure with any one, but it was plainly visible  in his conduct. He took the greatest care of every thing that came from  his distant friends, the least of their gifts was precious to him, he  never allowed others to make use of them, indeed he was visibly uneasy  if they touched them.    Material elegance was as natural to him as mental; this was evinced  in the objects with which he surrounded himself, as well as in the  aristocratic grace of his manners. He was passionately fond of flowers.  Without aiming at the brilliant luxury with which, at that epoch, some  of the celebrities in Paris decorated their apartments, he knew how to  keep upon this point, as well as in his style of dress, the instinctive  line of perfect propriety.    Not wishing the course of his life, his thoughts, his time, to be  associated or shackled in any way by the pursuits of others, he  preferred the society of ladies, as less apt to force him into  subsequent relations. He willingly spent whole evenings in playing blind  man's buff with the young people, telling them little stories to make  them break into the silvery laughs of youth, sweeter than the song of  the nightingale. He was fond of a life in the country, or the life of  the chateau. He was ingenious in varying its amusements, in multiplying  its enjoyments. He also loved to compose there. Many of his best works  written in such moments, perhaps embalm and hallow the memories of his  happiest days.        CHAPTER VI.    Birth and Early Life of Chopin--National Artists--Chopin embodies in  himself the poetic sense of his whole nation--Opinion of Beethoven.        CHOPIN was born in 1810, at Zelazowa-Wola, near Warsaw. Unlike most  other children, he could not, during his childhood, remember his own  age, and the date of his birth was only fixed in his memory by a  watch given him in 1820 by Madame Catalani, which bore the following  inscription: \"Madame Catalani to Frederic Chopin, aged ten years.\"  Perhaps the presentiments of the artist gave to the child a foresight of  his future! Nothing extraordinary marked the course of his boyhood;  his internal development traversed but few phases, and gave but few  manifestations. As he was fragile and sickly, the attention of his  family was concentrated upon his health. Doubtless it was from this  cause that he acquired his habits of affability, his patience under  suffering, his endurance"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4389"],[0,"Roughing It in the Bush (#20)"],[1,"words out of his mouth, when a horrible apparition  presented itself to his view. Slowly rising from his bed, and  putting on the fictitious nose, while he drew his white nightcap  over his ghastly and livid brow, Tom thrust his face through the  aperture, and uttered a diabolical cry; then sank down upon his  unseen couch as noiselessly as he had arisen. The cry was like  nothing human, and it was echoed by an involuntary scream from the  lips of our maid-servant and myself.    \"Good God! what's that?\" cried Satan, falling back in his chair, and  pointing to the vacant aperture. \"Did you hear it? did you see it?  It beats the universe. I never saw a ghost or the devil before!\"    Moodie, who had recognised the ghost, and greatly enjoyed the fun,  pretended profound ignorance, and coolly insinuated that Old Satan  had lost his senses. The man was bewildered; he stared at the vacant  aperture, then at us in turn, as if he doubted the accuracy of his  own vision. \"'Tis tarnation odd,\" he said; \"but the women heard it  too.\"    \"I heard a sound,\" I said, \"a dreadful sound, but I saw no ghost.\"    \"Sure an' 'twas himsel',\" said my lowland Scotch girl, who now  perceived the joke; \"he was a-seeken' to gie us puir bodies a wee  fricht.\"    \"How long have you been subject to these sort of fits?\" said I. \"You  had better speak to the doctor about them. Such fancies, if they are  not attended to, often end in madness.\"    \"Mad!\" (very indignantly) \"I guess I'm not mad, but as wide awake as  you are. Did I not see it with my own eyes? And then the noise--I  could not make such a tarnation outcry to save my life. But be it  man or devil, I don't care, I'm not afear'd,\" doubling his fist very  undecidedly at the hole. Again the ghastly head was protruded--the  dreadful eyes rolled wildly in their hollow sockets, and a yell more  appalling than the former rang through the room. The man sprang from  his chair, which he overturned in his fright, and stood for an  instant with his one-eyeball starting from his head, and glaring  upon the spectre; his cheeks deadly pale; the cold perspiration  streaming from his face; his lips dissevered, and his teeth  chattering in his head.    \"There--there--there. Look--look, it comes again!--the devil!--the  devil!\"    Here Tom, who still kept his eyes fixed upon his victim, gave a  knowing wink, and thrust his tongue out of his mouth.    \"He is coming!--he is coming!\" cried the affrighted wretch; and  clearing the open doorway with one leap, he fled across the field at  full speed. The stream intercepted his path--he passed it at a bound,  plunged into the forest, and was out of sight.    \"Ha, ha, ha!\" chuckled poor Tom, sinking down exhausted on his bed.  \"Oh that I had strength to follow up my advantage, I would lead Old  Satan such a chase that he should think his namesake was in truth  behind him.\"    During the six weeks that we inhabited that wretched cabin, we never  were troubled by Old Satan again.    As Tom slowly recovered, and began to regain his appetite, his soul  sickened over the salt beef and pork, which, owing to our distance  from ----, formed our principal fare. He positively refused to touch  the sad bread, as my Yankee neighbours very appropriately termed the  unleavened cakes in the pan; and it was no easy matter to send a man  on horseback eight miles to fetch a loaf of bread.    \"Do, my dear Mrs. Moodie, like a good Christian as you are, give me  a morsel of the baby's biscuit, and try and make us some decent  bread. The stuff your servant gives us is uneatable,\" said Wilson to  me, in most imploring accents.    \"Most willingly. But I have no yeast; and I never baked in one of  those strange kettles in my life.\"    \"I'll go to old Joe's wife and borrow some,\" said he; \"they are  always borrowing of you.\" Away he went across the field, but soon  returned. I looked into his jug--it was empty. \"No luck,\" said he;  \"those stingy wretches had just baked a fine batch of bread, and  they would neither lend nor sell a loaf; but they told me how to  make their milk-emptyings.\"    \"Well, discuss the same;\" but I much doubted if he could remember  the recipe.    \"You are to take an old tin pan,\" said he, sitting down on the  stool, and poking the fire with a stick.    \"Must it be an old one?\" said I, laughing.    \"Of course; they said so.\"    \"And what am I to put into it?\"    \"Patience; let me begin at the beginning. Some flour and some  milk--but, by George! I've forgot all about it. I was wondering as  I came across the field why they called the yeast _milk_-emptyings,  and that put the way to make it quite out of my head. But never  mind; it is only ten o'clock by my watch. I having nothing to do;  I will go again.\"    He went. Would I had been there to hear the colloquy between him and  Mrs. Joe; he described it something to this effect:--    Mrs. Joe: \"Well, stranger, what do you want now?\"    Tom: \"I have forgotten the way you told me how to make the bread.\"    Mrs. Joe: \"I never told you how to make bread. I guess you are a  fool. People have to raise bread before they can bake it. Pray who  sent you to make game of me? I guess somebody as wise as yourself.\"    Tom: \"The lady at whose house I am staying.\"    Mrs. Joe: \"Lady! I can tell you that we have no ladies here. So the  old woman who lives in the old log shanty in the hollow don't know  how to make bread. A clever wife that! Are you her husband?\" (Tom  shakes his head.)--\"Her brother?\"--(Another shake.)--\"Her son? Do  you hear? or are you deaf?\" (Going quite close up to him.)    Tom (moving back): \"Mistress, I'm not deaf; and who or what I am is  nothing to you. Will you oblige me by telling me how to make the  mill-emptyings; and this time I'll put it down in my pocket-book.\"    Mrs. Joe (with a strong sneer): \"Mill-emptyings! Milk, I told you.  So you expect me to answer your questions, and give back nothing in  return. Get you gone; I'll tell you no more about it.\"    Tom (bowing very low): \"Thank you for your civility. Is the old  woman who lives in the little shanty near the apple-trees more  obliging?\"    Mrs. Joe: \"That's my husband's mother. You may try. I guess she'll  give you an answer.\" (Exit, slamming the door in his face.)    \"And what did you do then ?\" said I.    \"Oh, went of course. The door was open, and I reconnoitred the  premises before I ventured in. I liked the phiz of the old woman  a deal better than that of her daughter-in-law, although it was  cunning and inquisitive, and as sharp as a needle. She was busy  shelling cobs of Indian corn into a barrel. I rapped at the door.  She told me to come in, and in I stepped. She asked me if I wanted  her. I told her my errand, at which she laughed heartily.\"    Old woman: \"You are from the old country, I guess, or you would know  how to make milk-emptyings. Now, I always prefer bran-emptyings.  They make the best bread. The milk, I opine, gives it a sourish  taste, and the bran is the least trouble.\"    Tom: \"Then let us have the bran, by all means. How do you make it?\"    Old woman: \"I put a double handful of bran into a small pot, or  kettle, but a jug will do, and a teaspoonful of salt; but mind you  don't kill it with salt, for if you do, it won't rise. I then add as  much warm water, at blood-heat, as will mix it into a stiff batter.  I then put the jug into a pan of warm water, and set it on the  hearth near the fire, and keep it at the same heat until it rises,  which it generally will do, if you attend to it, in two or three  hours' time. When the bran cracks at the top, and you see white  bubbles rising through it, you may strain it into your flour, and  lay your bread. It makes good bread.\"    Tom: \"My good woman, I am greatly obliged to you. We have no bran;  can you give me a small quantity?\"    Old woman: \"I never give anything. You Englishers, who come out with  stacks of money, can afford to buy.\"    Tom: \"Sell me a small quantity.\"    Old woman: \"I guess I will.\" (Edging quite close, and fixing her  sharp eyes on him.) \"You must be very rich to buy bran.\"    Tom (quizzically): \"Oh, very rich.\"    Old woman: \"How do you get your money?\"    Tom (sarcastically): \"I don't steal it.\"    Old woman: \"Pr'aps not. I guess you'll soon let others do that  for you, if you don't take care. Are the people you live with  related to you?\"    Tom (hardly able to keep his gravity): \"On Eve's side. They are my  friends.\"    Old woman (in surprise): \"And do they keep you for nothing, or do you  work for your meat?\"    Tom (impatiently): \"Is that bran ready?\" (The old woman goes to the  binn, and measures out a quart of bran.) \"What am I to pay you?\"    Old woman: \"A York shilling.\"    Tom (wishing to test her honesty): \"Is there any difference between  a York shilling and a shilling of British currency?\"    Old woman (evasively): \"I guess not. Is there not a place in England  called York?\" (Looking up and leering knowingly in his face.)    Tom (laughing): \"You are not going to come York over me in that way,  or Yankee either. There is threepence for your pound of bran; you are  enormously paid.\"    Old woman (calling after him): \"But the recipe; do you allow nothing  for the recipe?\"    Tom: \"It is included in the price of the bran.\"    \"And so,\" said he, \"I came laughing away, rejoicing in my sleeve  that I had disappointed the avaricious old cheat.\"    The next thing to be done was to set the bran rising. By the help of  Tom's recipe, it was duly mixed in the coffee-pot, and placed within  a tin pan, full of hot water, by the side of the fire. I have often  heard it said that a watched pot never boils; and there certainly  was no lack of watchers in this case. Tom sat for hours regarding it  with his large heavy eyes, the maid inspected it from time to time,  and scarce ten minutes were suffered to elapse without my testing  the heat of the water, and the state of the emptyings; but the day  slipped slowly away, and night drew on, and"]]]
