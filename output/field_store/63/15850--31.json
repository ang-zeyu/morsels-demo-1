She did not step very straight, and she could feel the  cold prick of her face under the mask. It was not shame, but fear that  gripped her. She would rather die than have Jim Cleve recognize her  in that bold disguise. A line of dusty saddled horses stood heads and  bridles down before the cabin, and a number of lounging men ceased  talking when she appeared. It was a crowd that smelled of dust and  horses and leather and whisky and tobacco. Joan did not recognize any  one there, which fact aided her in a quick recovery of her composure.  Then she found amusement in the absolute sensation she made upon these  loungers. They stared, open-mouthed and motionless. One old fellow  dropped his pipe from bearded lips and did not seem to note the loss. A  dark young man, dissipated and wild-looking, with years of lawlessness  stamped upon his face, was the first to move; and he, with awkward  gallantry, but with amiable disposition. Joan wanted to run, yet she  forced herself to stand there, apparently unconcerned before this  battery of bold and curious eyes. That, once done, made the rest  easier. She was grateful for the mask. And with her first low, almost  incoherent, words in reply Joan entered upon the second phase of her  experience with these bandits. Naturalness did not come soon, but it did  come, and with it her wit and courage.    Used as she had become to the villainous countenances of the border  ruffians, she yet upon closer study discovered wilder and more abandoned  ones. Yet despite that, and a brazen, unconcealed admiration, there  was not lacking kindliness and sympathy and good nature. Presently Joan  sauntered away, and she went among the tired, shaggy horses and made  friends with them. An occasional rider swung up the trail to dismount  before Kells's cabin, and once two riders rode in, both staring--all  eyes--at her. The meaning of her intent alertness dawned upon her then.  Always, whatever she was doing or thinking or saying, behind it all hid  the driving watchfulness for Jim Cleve. And the consciousness of this  fixed her mind upon him. Where was he? What was he doing? Was he drunk  or gambling or fighting or sleeping? Was he still honest? When she did  meet him what would happen? How could she make herself and circumstances  known to him before he killed somebody? A new fear had birth and  grew--Cleve would recognize her in that disguise, mask and all.    She walked up and down for a while, absorbed with this new idea. Then  an unusual commotion among the loungers drew her attention to a group of  men on foot surrounding and evidently escorting several horsemen. Joan  recognized Red Pearce and Frenchy, and then, with a start, Jim Cleve.  They were riding up the trail. Joan's heart began to pound. She could  not meet Jim; she dared not trust this disguise; all her plans were as  if they had never been. She forgot Kells. She even forgot her fear of  what Cleve might do. The meeting--the inevitable recognition--the pain  Jim Cleve must suffer when the fact and apparent significance of her  presence there burst upon him, these drove all else from Joan's mind.  Mask or no mask, she could not face his piercing eyes, and like a little  coward she turned to enter the cabin.    Before she got in, however, it was forced upon her that something  unusual had roused the loungers. They had arisen and were interested in  the approaching group. Loud talk dinned in Joan's ears. Then she went  in the door as Kells stalked by, eyes agleam, without even noticing her.  Once inside her cabin, with the curtain drawn, Joan's fear gave place to  anxiety and curiosity.    There was no one in the large cabin. Through the outer door she caught  sight of a part of the crowd, close together, heads up, all noisy. Then  she heard Kells's authoritative voice, but she could understand nothing.  The babel of hoarse voices grew louder. Kells appeared, entering the  door with Pearce. Jim Cleve came next, and, once the three were inside,  the crowd spilled itself after them like angry bees. Kells was talking,  Pearce was talking, but their voices were lost. Suddenly Kells vented  his temper.    \"Shut up--the lot of you!\" he yelled, and his power and position might  have been measured by the menace he showed.    The gang became suddenly quiet.    \"Now--what's up?\" demanded Kells.    \"Keep your shirt on, boss,\" replied Pearce, with good humor. \"There  ain't much wrong.... Cleve, here, throwed a gun on Gulden, that's all.\"    Kells gave a slight start, barely perceptible, but the intensity of it,  and a fleeting tigerish gleam across his face, impressed Joan with the  idea that he felt a fiendish joy. Her own heart clamped in a cold amaze.    \"Gulden!\" Kells's exclamation was likewise a passionate query.    \"No, he ain't cashed,\" replied Pearce. \"You can't kill that bull so  easy. But he's shot up some. He's layin' over at Beard's. Reckon you'd  better go over an' dress them shots.\"    \"He can rot before I doctor him,\" replied Kells. \"Where's Bate Wood?...  Bate, you can take my kit and go fix Gulden up. And now, Red, what was  all the roar about?\"    \"Reckon that was Gulden's particular pards tryin' to mix it with Cleve  an' Cleve tryin' to mix it with them--an' ME in between!... I'm here to  say, boss, that I had a time stavin' off a scrap.\"    During this rapid exchange between Kells and his lieutenant, Jim Cleve  sat on the edge of the table, one dusty boot swinging so that his spur  jangled, a wisp of a cigarette in his lips. His face was white except  where there seemed to be bruises under his eyes. Joan had never seen him  look like this. She guessed that he had been drunk--perhaps was still  drunk. That utterly abandoned face Joan was so keen to read made her  bite her tongue to keep from crying out. Yes, Jim was lost.    \"What'd they fight about?\" queried Kells.    \"Ask Cleve,\" replied Pearce. \"Reckon I'd just as lief not talk any more  about him.\"    Then Kells turned to Cleve and stepped before him. Somehow these two men  face to face thrilled Joan to her depths. They presented such contrasts.  Kells was keen, imperious, vital, strong, and complex, with an  unmistakable friendly regard for this young outcast. Cleve seemed aloof,  detached, indifferent to everything, with a white, weary, reckless  scorn. Both men were far above the gaping ruffians around them.    \"Cleve, why'd you draw on Gulden?\" asked Kells, sharply.    \"That's my business,\" replied Cleve, slowly, and with his piercing eyes  on Kells he blew a long, thin, blue stream of smoke upward.    \"Sure.... But I remember what you asked me the other day--about Gulden.  Was that why?\"    \"Nope,\" replied Cleve. \"This was my affair.\"    \"All right. But I'd like to know. Pearce says you're in bad with  Gulden's friends. If I can't make peace between you I'll have to take  sides.\"    \"Kells, I don't need any one on my side,\" said Cleve, and he flung the  cigarette away.    \"Yes, you do,\" replied Kells, persuasively. \"Every man on this border  needs that. And he's lucky when he gets it.\"    \"Well, I don't ask for it; I don't want it.\"    \"That's your own business, too. I'm not insisting or advising.\"    Kells's force and ability to control men manifested itself in his  speech and attitude. Nothing could have been easier than to rouse the  antagonism of Jim Cleve, abnormally responding as he was to the wild  conditions of this border environment.    \"Then you're not calling my hand?\" queried Cleve, with his dark,  piercing glance on Kells.    \"I pass, Jim,\" replied the bandit, easily.    Cleve began to roll another cigarette. Joan saw his strong, brown hands  tremble, and she realized that this came from his nervous condition, not  from agitation. Her heart ached for him. What a white, somber face, so  terribly expressive of the overthrow of his soul! He had fled to the  border in reckless fury at her--at himself. There in its wildness he  had, perhaps, lost thought of himself and memory of her. He had plunged  into the unrestrained border life. Its changing, raw, and fateful  excitement might have made him forget, but behind all was the terrible  seeking to destroy and be destroyed. Joan shuddered when she remembered  how she had mocked this boy's wounded vanity--how scathingly she had  said he did not possess manhood and nerve enough even to be bad.    \"See here, Red,\" said Kells to Pearce, \"tell me what happened--what you  saw. Jim can't object to that.\"    \"Sure,\" replied Pearce, thus admonished. \"We was all over at Beard's  an' several games was on. Gulden rode into camp last night. He's always  sore, but last night it seemed more'n usual. But he didn't say much an'  nothin' happened. We all reckoned his trip fell through. Today he was  restless. He walked an' walked just like a cougar in a pen. You know how  Gulden has to be on the move. Well, we let him alone, you can bet. But  suddenlike he comes up to our table--me an' Cleve an' Beard an' Texas  was playin' cards--an' he nearly kicks the table over. I grabbed the  gold an' Cleve he saved the whisky. We'd been drinkin' an' Cleve most of  all. Beard was white at the gills with rage an' Texas was soffocatin'.  But we all was afraid of Gulden, except Cleve, as it turned out. But he  didn't move or look mean. An' Gulden pounded on the table an' addressed  himself to Cleve.    \"'I've a job you'll like. Come on.'    \"'Job? Say, man, you couldn't have a job I'd like,' replied Cleve, slow  an' cool.    \"You know how Gulden gets when them spells come over him. It's just  plain cussedness. I've seen gunfighters lookin' for trouble--for someone  to kill. But Gulden was worse than that. You all take my hunch--he's got  a screw loose in his nut.    \"'Cleve,' he said, 'I located the Brander gold-diggin's--an' the girl  was there.'    \"Some kind of a white flash went over Cleve.

The beams  (_transtra_), made of pieces of timber a foot thick, were fixed with  iron nails, an inch in bigness; and the anchors were held by iron chains  instead of cables; soft skins, made very thin, served for sails, either  because those peoples were nearly or entirely unacquainted with linen,  or because they regarded the ordinary sails as insufficient to support,  with such heavy ships, the impetuosity of the winds of the ocean. The  Roman ships were superior to them only in agility and the impulse of the  oars. In everything else, those of the Veneti were better adapted to the  nature of the localities and to the heavy seas. By the solidity of their  construction they resisted the ships' beaks, and by their elevation they  were secure from the missiles, and were difficult to seize with the  grappling-irons (_copulae_).[282]      [Sidenote: Naval Combat against the Veneti.]    III. The Roman fleet, thanks to a wind from the east or north-east, was  at length enabled to set sail.[283] It quitted the Loire, and directed  its course towards the Bay of Quiberon and Point Saint-Jaques. (_See  Plate 12._) As soon as the Veneti perceived it, they sent out from the  port formed by the river Auray 220 ships well armed and well equipped,  which advanced to encounter it. During this time, the Roman fleet  reached Point Saint-Jaques, where it formed in order of battle near the  shore. That of the Veneti drew up in front of it. The battle took place  under the very eyes of Caesar and his troops, who occupied the heights on  the shore.    It was the first time that a Roman fleet appeared on the ocean.  Everything conspired to disconcert Brutus, as well as the tribunes of  the soldiers and the centurions who commanded each vessel: the impotence  of the beaks against the Gaulish ships; the height of the enemy's poops,  which overlooked even the high towers of the Roman vessels; and lastly,  the inefficiency of the missiles thrown upwards. The military chiefs  were hesitating, and had already experienced some loss,[284] when, to  remedy this disadvantage, they imagined a method having some analogy  with that to which Duillius owed his victory over the Carthaginians in  492: they tried to disable the Gaulish vessels by the aid of hooks  (_falces_) similar to those which were used in attacks on fortresses  (_non absimili forma muralium falcium_).[285] The _falx_ was an iron  with a point and sharpened hook, fixed at the end of long poles, which,  suspended to the masts by ropes, received an impulsion similar to that  of the ram. One or more ships approached a Gaulish vessel, and, as soon  as the crew had succeeded in catching with one of these hooks the ropes  which attached the yards to the masts, the sailors rowed away with all  their strength, so as to break or cut the cords. The yards fell; the  disabled vessel was immediately surrounded by the Romans, who boarded  it; and then all depended on mere valour. This manoeuvre was  completely successful. The soldiers of the fleet, knowing that no act of  courage could pass unperceived by Caesar and the land troops, emulated  one another in zeal, and captured several of the enemy's vessels. The  Gauls prepared to seek their safety in flight. They had already swerved  their ships to the wind, when suddenly there came on a dead calm. This  unexpected occurrence decided the victory. Left without the possibility  of moving, the heavy Gaulish vessels were captured one after another; a  very small number succeeded in gaining the coast under favour of the  night.    The battle, which began at ten o'clock in the morning, had lasted till  sunset. It terminated the war with the Veneti and the other maritime  peoples of the ocean. They lost in it, at one blow, all their youth, all  their principal citizens, and all their fleet; without refuge, without  the means of defending any longer their _oppida_, they surrendered  themselves, bodies and goods. Caesar, wishing to compel the Gauls in  future to respect the rights of nations, caused the whole Senate to be  put to death and the rest of the inhabitants to be sold for slaves.    Caesar has been justly reproached with this cruel chastisement; yet this  great man gave such frequent proofs of his clemency towards the  vanquished, that he must have yielded to very powerful political motives  to order an execution so contrary to his habits and temper. Moreover, it  was a sad effect of the war to expose incessantly the chiefs of the  Gallic states to the resentments of the conquerors and the fury of the  mob. While the Roman general punished the Senate of the Veneti for its  revolt and obstinate resistance, the Aulerci-Eburovices and the Lexovii  slaughtered theirs because it laboured to prevent them from joining the  insurrection.[286]      [Sidenote: Victory of Sabinus over the Unelli.]    IV. While these events were taking place among the Veneti, Q. Titurius  Sabinus gained a decisive victory over the Unelli. At the head of this  nation, and other states in revolt, was Viridovix, who had been joined,  a few days before, by the Aulerci-Eburovices and the Lexovii. A  multitude of men of no account, who had joined him from all parts of  Gaul, in the hope of pillage, came to increase the number of his troops.  Sabinus, starting, we believe, from the neighbourhood of Angers with his  three legions, arrived in the country of the Unelli, and chose there for  his camp a position which was advantageous in all respects. He  established himself on a hill belonging to the line of heights which  separates the basin of the See from that of the Celune, where we now  find the vestiges of a camp called Du Chastellier.[287] (_See Plate  13._) This hill is defended on the west by escarpments; to the north,  the ground descends from the summit by a gentle slope of about 1,000  paces (1,500 metres) to the banks of the See. Viridovix came and took a  position in face of the Roman camp, at a distance of two miles, on the  heights of the right bank of the stream. Every day he deployed his  troops and offered battle in vain. As Sabinus remained prudently shut up  in his camp, his inaction drew upon him the sarcasms of his own  soldiers, and to such a degree the contempt of the enemy, that the  latter advanced to the foot of his entrenchments. He considered that, in  face of so great a number of troops, it was not the duty of a  lieutenant, in the absence of his general-in-chief, to give battle,  without at least having in his favour all the chances of success. But,  not satisfied with having convinced the enemies of his weakness, he  determined further to make use of a stratagem; he persuaded a clever and  cunning Gaul to repair to Viridovix, under pretence of being a  deserter, and to spread the report that the Romans, during the following  night, would quit secretly their camp, in order to go to the succour of  Caesar. At this news, the barbarians cried out that they must seize the  favourable opportunity to march against the Romans, and let none of them  escape. Full of ardour, they compelled Viridovix to give the order for  arming. Already confident of victory, they loaded themselves with  branches and brushwood to fill up the fosses, and rushed to attack the  retrenchments. In the hope of not giving time to the Romans to assemble  and arm, they advance with rapidity, and arrive out of breath. But  Sabinus was prepared, and, at the opportune moment, he gives the order  to issue suddenly by the two gates, and to fall upon the enemies while  they were encumbered with their burdens. The advantage of the locality,  the unskilfulness and fatigue of the Gauls, and the valour of the  Romans, all contributed to their success. The barbarians, pursued by the  cavalry, were cut to pieces. The neighbouring peoples immediately  submitted.    Caesar and Sabinius received intelligence at the same time, one of the  victory over the Unelli, the other of the result of the combat against  the Veneti.[288]      [Sidenote: Conquest of Aquitaine by P. Crassus.]    V. Almost at the same time, P. Crassus, detached, as we have seen, with  twelve cohorts and a body of cavalry, arrived in Aquitaine, which,  according to the \"Commentaries,\" formed the third part of Gaul.[289] He  believed that he could not display too much prudence in a country  where, a few years before, the lieutenant L. Valerius Praeconinus had  lost his army and his life, and the proconsul L. Mallius had experienced  a great defeat. Having provided for supplies, assembled the auxiliaries,  and chosen by name the most courageous men of Toulouse and Narbonne, he  led his army into the lands of the Sotiates, who, very numerous, and  strong especially in excellent cavalry, attacked the Roman army during  its march. Their horsemen were at first repulsed and pursued; but,  suddenly unmasking their infantry, which lay in ambush in a defile (_in  convalle_), they charge the Romans as they were dispersed, and the  battle re-commenced with fury.    Proud of their ancient victories, the Sotiates expected by their valour  to save Aquitaine; on their side, the troops of Crassus sought to show  what they could do under a young chief, at a distance from their general  and the other legions. The victory in the end remained with the Romans.  Crassus pursued his march, and having arrived before the _oppidum_ of  the Sotiates (the town of _Sos_), attempted to carry it by assault; but  the vigorous resistance he met with obliged him to have recourse to  covered galleries and towers. The enemies had recourse sometimes to  sallies, sometimes to subterranean galleries, carried so far that they  went under the works of the besiegers (a labour familiar to the  Aquitanians on account of the numerous mines they worked); yet, all  their efforts failing against the activity of the Roman soldiers, they  made offers to surrender. Crassus accepted their submission, and the  Sotiates delivered up their arms. During the capitulation,"]]]
