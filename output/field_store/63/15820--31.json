Once the disinclination to move is overcome, the effort  required is less each time, and ultimately the will gains a distinct  mastery.    When the muscles are put into action, what is termed their  contractility is called into play--that is, the force which was  dormant before is roused into activity. This is effected through the  nervous system, and it is the will which emanates from the brain and is  carried along certain nerves to accomplish definite actions. During the  contraction of a muscle its individual fibres change in form, producing  an alteration in the shape of the whole muscle; thus it becomes shorter  and thicker. At the same time, while it is in action more blood flows  through it, hence we see that one of the beneficial effects of exercise  is to stimulate the circulation through the muscular system. It has  also been ascertained by experiments, that the venous blood which comes  from a muscle in action is darker in colour than that from a muscle in  repose. When the circulation is quickened by movement, and the blood  stream hastened, the vigour of the body is increased, because the used  up material is all the quicker taken away, and a freshly created supply  of nutrition brought to every part.    The rate of breathing is accelerated whenever the body is engaged in  muscular exertion, and with this quickened breathing there is an  increased amount of oxygen drawn in, and an increased amount of  carbonic acid gas and water exhaled by the breath. The oxygen which is  absorbed from the air into the blood is stored in the red corpuscles of  the latter, by which it is carried to every part of the body. The  venous blood which returns from every portion of the system comes back  as a dark crimson, instead of being bright scarlet like the arterial  blood. It contains carbonic acid, and returns it to the lungs, where it  is exhaled by the breath. The oxygen is necessary to existence, while  the carbonic acid is injurious. The effect of exercise, then, in any  form, is thus to distribute healthy blood more rapidly through the  system, while it removes the injurious matters quite as speedily. The  effect of active exercise on the heart, as it is well known, is to make  it beat faster; by this the blood is driven through the body at a  quicker rate than usual. Sometimes, when the effort is unusually  severe, there is a disturbance of the regular balance between the heart  and the lungs. There is thus produced an irregular or unequal action of  the former, causing what is known as \"loss of wind,\" which is, however,  soon restored by resting.    There is an excessive flow of blood to the surface of the body, causing  it to redden, and at the same time the perspiration is greatly  increased. It is on account of this latter moisture opening up the  pores of the skin that the good effects of exercise are chiefly due.  The perspiration consists mainly of water containing different salts  and organic matters. It is found by experiment that the amount  of water passing through the lungs and skin is usually doubled even  with moderate exertion.    The result of moderate exercise in benefiting the nervous system is  well known, and the effect of a gentle walk in making the ideas flow  through the brain is a matter of common observation. At the same time,  it must be borne in mind that exercise, when carried to the verge of  fatigue, compels inactivity of the brain for a time, since Nature must  have repose. But when carried out in moderation with a view of  improving the condition of the body, it conduces to the salubrity of  the brain as well, for the latter organ shares in the health of the  former. The only thing to guard against is irregular and fitful doses;  thus it is far better to take a little in moderation daily, than to  attempt to make one day's exercise suffice for the rest of the week.    It follows from the foregoing, therefore, that without exercise a  perfect state of health is an impossibility. There can be no proper  bodily health unless there be daily exercise. It is the same with  everybody, no matter what the condition of life may be. Exercise is  quite as necessary for the well-to-do man as it is for him who is not  so circumstanced. The laws of health cannot be violated, and all the  money in the world will not atone for neglect in this respect. Exercise  is not a matter that can be carried out by proxy. No; each one must  take his own exercise, and he derives all the benefit for himself.    It is a fortunate thing, then, that most people have to earn their own  living, for the exertion thereby entailed is actually necessary for  health. Yet, while this is the case with those who live by their bodily  labour, it hardly applies to those who are more dependent upon mental  work. For instance, the latter include literary men and journalists,  the members of the professions, and those of the vast commercial  world--all, indeed, who have brain strain and clerical occupations. In  their case the great fault is that they use their heads too much and  their limbs too little. For them walking is one of the very best means  of obtaining health, and it should be regularly and systematically  practised.    It has been said that no man under sixty, unless he be kept walking  while at his work, should walk less than six or eight miles a day, if  he wishes to keep well and have healthy children. In the cooler weather  in Australia these are certainly suitable distances, but in the hot  months half these amounts will be found sufficient, and they had better  be carried out in the cool of the evening. Then again, for those over  sixty it has been well observed that a daily walk is still the best  means of promoting health. But the walk must always be proportionate to  the strength, and should be done at nothing more than a moderate pace,  if a man wishes to take care of his blood vessels.    There is another matter which calls for notice, and it is that of early  morning exercise. Now, I am quite willing to admit that there are many  who derive great benefit from their early morning swim, their matutinal  walk, or their tennis before breakfast. But it should be distinctly  borne in mind that there are others with whom such early morning  exercise does not agree. They get as a result a weary, languid feeling  which lasts throughout the entire day. Now, they are apt to imagine it  is the exercise in itself which produces this effect. But the truth is,  it arises from the time of day at which the exercise is taken, and is  not due to the exertion at all. It must not be forgotten, therefore,  that while many people derive the greatest advantage from early morning  exercise, yet there are others for whom it is altogether unsuitable.  But, on the other hand, the latter will obtain every possible benefit  by taking their allowance of exercise at some other period of  the twenty-four hours.    There are other forms of exercise besides walking, and these have their  good points. Riding is, of course, invaluable, especially in cases of  sluggish liver. As it has been wittily observed, the outside of a horse  is the best thing for the inside of a man. In the cool months in  Australia riding is a real pleasure, but in the hot season it is hardly  so agreeable. Then again, rowing is a magnificent exercise, and has  much to recommend it in early adult life. There is no harm whatever in  rowing as an exercise, but when it comes to racing that is a different  matter. It is the great strain on the heart, together with the  excitement which constitute the sources of risk. The other varieties of  exercise, namely, gardening, the different games, cricket, football,  tennis, &c., need not be particularized as they all subserve the same  purposes, and are in consequence very desirable.    In all the preceding I have endeavoured to show that daily exercise is  absolutely necessary for the proper maintenance of health. But there is  something even more than this. It is that a long life itself is to be  ensured by exercise. It is only by exercise, and by exercise alone,  that the various organs of the body, the heart, the lungs, the stomach,  the liver, &c., are maintained in their normal state of health. Their  condition, moreover, is only to be improved by the muscular movements  belonging to exercise. The heart itself is intended for action, not for  inaction. By action it thrives, and by disuse it becomes weakened. It  is so with all the other organs. In conclusion, therefore, it must be  said that the whole system can only be kept in perfect health by  muscular movements, and that in addition to keeping the body in health  exercise actually increases the chances of living to a good old age.          CHAPTER VIII.        ON SCHOOL COOKERY AND ITS INFLUENCE ON THE AUSTRALIAN DAILY LIFE.      \"BAD COOKERY DIMINISHES HAPPINESS, AND SHORTENS LIFE.\"--WISDOM OF AGES.      In all probability there are but few who have ever had their attention  called to certain figures duly set forth within the pages of that mine  of information, namely, Mr. T. A. Coghlan's WEALTH AND PROGRESS OF NEW  SOUTH WALES. Nevertheless, the facts associated with these statistics  so directly concern our Australian daily life that they deserve to be  widely known. That portion of the work in which our food supply is  considered, therefore, is well worth referring to. It will he found  that the consumption of butcher's meat by each inhabitant is greater  than in any other country in the world. Thus the amount of meat  required for each member of the community every year in New South Wales  is 201 lbs.; in Victoria 275 lbs.; whilst in Queensland 370 lbs. are  called for. On the other hand, in the United Kingdom only 109 lbs. are  similarly needed; in the United States of America 150 lbs. while the  figures for the different European countries show an average of no more  than 70 lbs.    Another article of commerce which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42238"],[0,"The Articles of Faith (#20)"],[1,"imbued throughout with the doctrine of  salvation through the work of atonement wrought by the Savior; and yet  the word atonement, occurs but once in the whole record; and in that  single instance, according to the opinion of most biblical  authorities, it is confessedly misused. The instance referred to is  found in the words of Paul addressed to the saints at Rome:--\"But we  also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now  received the atonement.\"[192] The marginal rendering gives, instead of  atonement, reconciliation, and of this word a related form is used in  the preceding verse. A consistent translation, giving a full  agreement between the English and the Greek, would make the verse  quoted, and that immediately preceding it, read in this way:--\"For if,  when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his  Son; much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. And  not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by  whom we have now received the reconciliation.\"[193] The term atonement  occurs repeatedly in the Old Testament, and with marked frequency in  three of the books of the Pentateuch, viz.: Exodus, Leviticus, and  Numbers; and the sense in which it is employed is invariably that of a  sacrifice of propitiation, usually associated with the death of an  acceptable victim, whereby reconciliation was to be effected between  God and His creatures.      [192] Romans v, 11.      [193] Romans v, 10-11.    =3.= The structure of the word in its present form is suggestive of  this, the true meaning; it is literally _at-one-ment_, \"denoting  reconciliation, or the bringing into agreement of those who have been  estranged.\"[194] And such is the significance of the saving sacrifice  of the Redeemer, whereby He expiated the transgression of the Fall,  through which came death into the world, and provided ready and  efficient means for man's attainment of immortality through  reconciliation with God.      [194] Standard Dictionary, under _propitiation_.    =4. Nature of the Atonement.=--The atonement wrought by Jesus Christ  is a necessary sequence of the transgression of Adam; and, as the  infinite foreknowledge of God made clear to Him the one even before  Adam was placed on earth, so the Father's boundless mercy prepared a  Savior for mankind before the world was framed. Through the Fall, Adam  and Eve have entailed the conditions of mortality upon their  descendants; therefore all beings born of earthly parents are subject  to bodily death. The sentence of banishment from the presence of God  was in the nature of a spiritual death; and that penalty, which was  visited upon our first parents in the day of their transgression, has  likewise followed as the common heritage of humanity. As this penalty  came into the world through an individual act, it would be manifestly  unjust to cause all to eternally suffer therefrom, without a chance of  deliverance. Therefore was the promised sacrifice of Jesus Christ  ordained as a propitiation for broken law, whereby Justice could be  fully satisfied, and Mercy be left free to exercise her beneficent  influence over the souls of mankind.[195] All the details of the  glorious plan, by which the salvation of the human family is assured,  may not lie within the understanding of man; but surely man has  learned, from his futile attempts to fathom the primary cause of the  phenomena of nature, that his powers of comprehension are limited; and  he will admit, that to deny an effect because of his inability to  elucidate its cause, would be to forfeit his claims as an observing  and reasoning being.      [195] See Note 1.    =5.= Simple as is the plan of redemption in its general features, it  is confessedly a mystery to the finite mind in detail. President John  Taylor has written in this wise:--\"In some mysterious, incomprehensible  way, Jesus assumed the responsibility which naturally would have  devolved upon Adam; but which could only be accomplished through the  mediation of Himself; and by taking upon Himself their sorrows,  assuming their responsibilities, and bearing their transgressions or  sins. In a manner to us incomprehensible and inexplicable, He bore the  weight of the sins of the whole world, not only of Adam, but of his  posterity; and in doing that, opened the kingdom of heaven, not only  to all believers and all who obeyed the law of God, but to more than  one half of the human family who die before they come to years of  maturity, as well as to the heathen, who, having died without law,  will through His mediation be resurrected without law, and be judged  without law, and thus participate, according to their capacity, works,  and worth, in the blessings of His atonement.\"[196]      [196] Pres. John Taylor, Mediation and Atonement, pp. 148-149.    =6.= But, however incomplete may be our comprehension of the scheme of  redemption through Christ's vicarious sacrifice in all its parts, we  cannot reject it without becoming infidel; for it stands as the  fundamental doctrine of all scripture, the very essence of the spirit  of prophecy and revelation, the most prominent of all the declarations  of God unto man.    =7. The Atonement a Vicarious Sacrifice.=--It is to many a matter of  surpassing wonder that the voluntary sacrifice of a single being could  be made to operate as a means of ransom for the rest of mankind. In  this, as in other things, the scriptures are explicable only by the  spirit of scriptural interpretation. The sacred writings of ancient  times, the words of modern prophets, the traditions of mankind, the  rites of sacrifice, and even the sacrileges of heathen idolatries,  involve the idea of vicarious atonement. God has never refused to  accept an offering made by one who is authorized on behalf of those  who are in any way incapable of doing the required service themselves.  The scape-goat,[197] and the altar victim[198] of ancient Israel, if  offered with repentance and contrition, were accepted by the Lord in  mitigation of the sins of the people. It is interesting to note, that  while the ceremonies of sacrifice formed so large and so essential a  part of the Mosaic requirements, these rites long ante-dated the  establishment of Israel as a distinct people; for, as already shown,  altar sacrifice was rendered by Adam.[199] The symbolism of the  sacrificing of animals as a prototype of the great sacrifice to follow  on Calvary was thus instituted with the beginning of human history.      [197] Lev. xvi, 20-22.      [198] Lev. iv.      [199] See page 70.    =8.= The many kinds of sacrifice prescribed by the Mosaic law are  clearly classified under the headings bloody and bloodless. Offerings  of the first order only, involving the infliction of death, were  acceptable in propitiation or atonement for sin, and the victim had to  be clean, healthy, and without spot or blemish. And so for the great  sacrifice, the effects of which were to be infinite, only an innocent  subject could be accepted. It was Christ's right, as the only sinless  Being on earth, and as the Only Begotten of the Father, and above all  as the One ordained to this mission in the heavens, to be the Redeemer  of mankind; and though the exercise of this right involved a  sacrifice, the extent of which man cannot comprehend, yet Christ made  that sacrifice willingly and voluntarily. To the last He had the means  of terminating the tortures of His persecutors, by a simple exercise  of His powers as one of the Godhead.[200] In some way, though that way  may be inexplicable to us, Christ took upon Himself the sins of  mankind. The means may be to our finite minds a mystery, yet the  results are our salvation.      [200] Matt. xxvi, 53-54; John x, 17-18.    =9.= Something of the Savior's agony as He groaned under this load of  guilt, which to Him, as a type of purity, must have been in itself  repulsive, He has told us through the prophet's words in this day:  \"For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they  might not suffer if they would repent; but if they would not repent  they must suffer even as I, which suffering caused myself, even God,  the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every  pore, and to suffer both body and spirit; and would that I might not  drink the bitter cup, and shrink:--Nevertheless, glory be to the  Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children  of men.\"[201] Further instances of the validity of vicarious service  are found in the ordinances of baptism for the dead[202] as taught in  apostolic and modern times, and in the institution of other temple  ceremonies[203] in the present dispensation.      [201] Doc. and Cov. xix, 16-19. See \"Jesus the Christ,\" pp.    610-614.      [202] I Cor. xv, 29. See Lectures vi and vii.      [203] Doc. and Cov. cxxvii, 4-9; cxxviii.    =10. Christ's Sacrifice was Voluntary and Love-inspired.=--We have  noted in passing that Christ gave His life willingly and voluntarily  for the redemption of mankind. He offered Himself, in the great  Council of the Gods, as the subject of the atoning sacrifice made  necessary by the fore-seen transgression of the first man; and the  free agency shown and exercised in this, the early stage of His saving  mission, was retained to the very last of the agonizing fulfillment of  the accepted plan. Though He lived on earth a man in every particular  that concerns us in our regard for Him as an example of Godliness in  humanity, yet it is to be remembered that, though born of a mortal  mother, he was begotten by an immortal Sire; and so had combined  within His being the capacity to die, and the power to set death at  defiance. He gave His life; it was not taken from Him. Note the  significance of His own declaration:--\"Therefore doth my Father love  me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again. No man  taketh it from me, but I lay it down"]]]
