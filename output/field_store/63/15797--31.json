[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39205"],[0,"Sheep, Swine, and Poultry (#20)"],[1,"is out of the question where half a dozen or more  rams are running promiscuously with two or three hundred ewes.    Before the rams are let out, the breeding ewes should all be brought  together in one yard; the form of each noted, together with the length,  thickness, quality and style of her wool--ascertained by opening the  wool on the shoulder, thigh, and belly. When every point is thus  determined, that ram should be selected which, on the whole, is best  calculated to perpetuate the excellencies of each, both of fleece and  carcass, and to best counterbalance defects in the mutual offspring.  Every ewe, when turned in with the ram, should be given a distinct mark,  which will continue visible until the next shearing. For this purpose,  nothing is better than Venetian red and hog's lard, well incorporated,  and marked on with a cob. The ewes for each ram require a differently  shaped mark, and the mark should also be made on the ram, as noted in  the sheep-book. Thus it can be determined at a glance by what ram the  ewe was tapped, any time before the next shearing. The ewes selected for  each ram are placed in different enclosures, and the chosen ram placed  with them. Rams require but little preparation on being put among ewes.  If their skin is red in the flanks when the sheep are turned up, they  are ready for the ewes, for the natural desire is then upon them. Most  of the ewes will be served during the second week the ram is among them,  and in the third, all. It is better, however, not to withdraw the rams  until the expiration of four weeks, when the flocks can be doubled, or  otherwise re-arranged for winter, as may be necessary. The trouble thus  taken is, in reality, slight--nothing, indeed, when the beneficial  results are considered. With two assistants, several hundred ewes may be  properly classified and divided in a single day.    Where choice rams are scarce, so that it is desirable to make the  services of one go a great way, or where it is impossible to have  separate enclosures--as on farms where there are a great number of  breeding ewes, or where the shepherd system is adopted, to the exclusion  of fences--resort may be had to another method. A hut should be built,  containing as many apartments as the ram is desired to be used, with an  alley between them, each apartment to be furnished with a feeding-box  and trough in one corner, and gates or bars opening from each into the  alley, and at each end of the alley. Adjoining these apartments, a yard  should be inclosed, of size just sufficient to hold the flock of  breeding ewes.    A couple of strong rams, of any quality, for about every hundred ewes,  are then aproned, their briskets rubbed with Venetian red and hog's  lard, and let loose among the ewes. _Aproning_ is performed by sewing a  belt of coarse sacking, broad enough to extend from the fore to the hind  legs, loosely but strongly around the body. To prevent its slipping  forward or back, straps are carried round the breast and back of the  breech. It should be made _perfectly secure_, or all the labor of this  method of coupling will be far worse than thrown away. The pigment on  the brisket should be renewed every two or three days; and it will be  necessary to change the \"teasers\"--as these aproned rams are  called--about once a week, as they do not long retain their courage  under such unnatural circumstances. Twice a day the ewes are brought  into the yard in front of the hut. Those marked on their rumps by the  teasers are taken into the alley. Each is admitted _once_ to the ram for  which she is marked, and then goes out _at the opposite end of the  alley_ from which they entered, into a field separate from that  containing the flock from which she was taken. A powerful and vigorous  ram, from three to seven years old, and properly fed, can thus be made  to serve from one hundred and fifty to even two hundred ewes, with no  greater injury than from running loose with fifty or sixty. The labor  here required is likewise more apparent than real, when the operation is  conducted in a systematic manner.    Rams will do better, accomplish more, and last two or three years  longer, if daily fed with grain, when on service, and it is better to  continue it. In all cases, they should, after serving, be put on good  pasture, as they will have lost a good deal of condition, being  indisposed to settle during the tapping season. A ram should receive  the equivalent of from half a pint to a pint of oats daily, when worked  hard. They are much more conveniently fed when kept in huts. If suffered  to run at large, they should be so thoroughly tamed that they will eat  from a measure held by the shepherd. Careful breeders thus train their  stock-rams, from the time they are lambs. It is very convenient, also,  to have them halter-broke, so that they can be led about without  dragging or lifting them. An iron ring attached to one of the horns,  near the point, to which a cord can be fastened for leading, confining,  etc., is very useful and convenient. If rams are wild, it is a matter of  considerable difficulty to feed them separately, and it can only be  effected by yarding the flock and catching them out. Some breeders, in  addition to extra feeding, take the rams out of the flocks each night,  shutting them up in a barn or stable by themselves. To this practice  there is no objection, and it greatly saves their strength.    Rams should not be suffered to run with the ewes over a month, at least  in the Northern States. It is much better that a ewe go dry than that  she have a lamb later than the first of June. Besides, after the rutting  season is over, the rams grow cross, frequently striking the pregnant  ewes dangerous blows with their heavy horns, at the racks and troughs.    It is reasonably enough conjectured, that if procreation and the first  period of gestation take place in cold weather, the f[oe]tus will be  fitted for the climate which rules during the early stages of its  existence. If this be so--and it is certainly in accordance with the  laws of Nature--fine-woolled sheep are most likely to maintain their  excellence by deferring the connection of the male till the commencement  of cold weather; and, in the Northern States, this is done about the  first of December, thus bringing the yeaning time in the last of April,  or the first of May, when the early grass affords a large supply and  good quality of food.      LAMBING.    [Illustration: EWE AND LAMBS.]    The ewe goes with young about five months, varying from one hundred and  forty-five to one hundred and sixty-two days. Pregnant ewes require the  same food as at all other times. Until two or three weeks preceding  lambing, it is only necessary that they, like other store-sheep, be kept  in good, plump, ordinary condition; nor are any separate arrangements  necessary for them after that period, in a climate where they obtain  sufficient succulent food to provide for a proper secretion of milk. In  backward seasons in the North, where the grass does not start prior to  the lambing-time, careful farmers feed their ewes on chopped roots, or  roots mixed with oat and pea-meal, which is excellent economy. Caution  is, however, necessary to prevent injury or abortion, which is often  the result of excessive fat, feebleness, or disease. The first may be  remedied by blood-letting and spare diet; and both the last by restored  health and generous food. Sudden frights, as from dogs or strange  objects; long or severe journeys, great exertions, unwholesome food,  blows in the region of the f[oe]tus, and some other causes, produce  abortion.    Lambs are usually dropped, in the North, from the first to the fifteenth  of May; in the South, they can safely come earlier. It is not expedient  to have them dropped when the weather is cold or boisterous, as they  require too much care; but the sooner the better, after the weather has  become mild, and the herbage has started sufficiently to give the ewes  that green food which is required to produce a plentiful secretion of  milk. It is customary, in the North, to have fields of clover, or the  earliest grasses, reserved for the early spring-feed of the  breeding-ewes; and, if these can be contiguous to their stables, it is a  great convenience--for the ewes should be confined in the latter, on  cold and stormy nights, during the lambing season.    If the weather be warm and pleasant, and the nights moderately warm, it  is better to have the lambing take place in the pasture; since sheep are  then more disposed to own their lambs, and take kindly to them, than in  the confusion of a small inclosure. In the latter, sheep, unless  particularly docile, crowd from one side to another when any one enters,  running over young lambs, pressing them severely, etc.; ewes become  separated from their lambs, and then run violently round from one to  another, jostling and knocking them about; young and timid ewes, when so  separated, will frequently neglect their lambs for an hour or more  before they will again approach them, while, if the weather is severely  cold, the lamb, if it has never sucked, is in danger of perishing.  Lambs, too, when first dropped in a _dirty_ inclosure, tumble about, in  their first efforts to rise, and the membrane which adheres to them  becomes smeared with dirt and dung; and the ewe's refusing to lick them  dry much increases the hazard of freezing.    In cold storms, however, and in sudden and severe weather, all this must  be encountered; and, therefore, every shepherd should teach his sheep  docility. It requires but a very moderately cold night to destroy the  new-born Saxon lamb, which--the pure blood--is dropped nearly as naked  as a child. During a severely cold period, of several days continuance,  it is almost impossible to rear them, even in the best shelter.
