A CENSUS    While this census ignores several birds of the island as to the identity  of which doubt exists in the mind of the compiler, it acknowledges the  presence of all permanent residents familiar to him, as well as casual  visitors, and those which stay for a few hours or days, as the case may  be, for rest or refreshment during migratory flights. Chastened by the  half-averted face of irresponsive science, the glowing desire to inflate  the list gave way to the crisper sort of satisfaction which is like the  joy that cometh in the morning.

Why have we no residential parrot, though cockatoos are plentiful; no  scrub turkey though the megapode scampers in all directions in the  jungle; no common black crow, nor butcher bird, though other shrikes (the  magpie for instance) come and go; no wren, no finch, no lark? Scrub  turkeys (TALLEGALLA LATHAMI), mound builders like the megapode, are  plentiful all along the coast, at certain seasons visiting the scrub  which margins the opposite beach, but they are not found on these  islands. The blue mountain parrot (red-collared lorikeet), the red-winged  lory, the black cockatoo (Leach's), and other well-known species, fleet  and venturesome, to whom two miles and a half of \"salt, estranging sea\"  cannot be any check, certainly do not use the island for nesting as birds  of \"innocent and quiet minds\" might. Gauze-winged butterflies flit across  the channel, occasionally in great numbers. What law restrains virile  birds from the venture?    The absence among the residents of swimming birds, save the beach  frequenters, is due to the lack of open fresh water, though there are  indications of the past existence of at least one swamp, and also that it  was drained naturally by the fretting away of a sand ridge by the sea.    How is it, that though we have echidna in three different colours--black,  grey and straw--there is no typical marsupial, large or small, no iguana  (rather, monitor lizard), though a fair variety of other reptiles, from  white, house-haunting geckoes to carpet snakes? Though the CYCAS MEDIA is  plentiful on the seaward slopes of the adjacent mainland, no trace of  that interesting old-world plant has been discovered here. and but one  casual representative has been found of the graceful fan palm (LICUALA  MUELLERI), another relic of the far beginning of Australia. No doubt the  seed whence the single fan palm sprung would be brought hither by a  nutmeg pigeon; but there is no bird-carrier for the CYCAD, and the set of  the current is opposed to its transport by the sea.    In birds and in mammals and in plants, wide-spread Australian groups are  unrepresented.    THE DAYBREAK FUGUE    Before there is any visible sign of the break of day, some keener and  finer perception than man possesses reveals it to the noisy pitta, or  dragoon bird,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/512"],[0,"Mosses from an Old Manse, and Other Stories (#20)"],[1," and  confused, inasmuch as a singular drowsiness here overcame me, owing to  the fact that we were passing over the enchanted ground, the air of  which encourages a disposition to sleep. I awoke, however, as soon as  we crossed the borders of the pleasant land of Beulah. All the  passengers were rubbing their eyes, comparing watches, and  congratulating one another on the prospect of arriving so seasonably at  the journey's end. The sweet breezes of this happy clime came  refreshingly to our nostrils; we beheld the glimmering gush of silver  fountains, overhung by trees of beautiful foliage and delicious fruit,  which were propagated by grafts from the celestial gardens. Once, as we  dashed onward like a hurricane, there was a flutter of wings and the  bright appearance of an angel in the air, speeding forth on some  heavenly mission. The engine now announced the close vicinity of the  final station-house by one last and horrible scream, in which there  seemed to be distinguishable every kind of wailing and woe, and bitter  fierceness of wrath, all mixed up with the wild laughter of a devil or  a madman. Throughout our journey, at every stopping-place, Apollyon had  exercised his ingenuity in screwing the most abominable sounds out of  the whistle of the steam-engine; but in this closing effort he outdid  himself and created an infernal uproar, which, besides disturbing the  peaceful inhabitants of Beulah, must have sent its discord even through  the celestial gates.    While the horrid clamor was still ringing in our ears we heard an  exulting strain, as if a thousand instruments of music, with height and  depth and sweetness in their tones, at once tender and triumphant, were  struck in unison, to greet the approach of some illustrious hero, who  had fought the good fight and won a glorious victory, and was come to  lay aside his battered arms forever. Looking to ascertain what might be  the occasion of this glad harmony, I perceived, on alighting from the  cars, that a multitude of shining ones had assembled on the other side  of the river, to welcome two poor pilgrims, who were just emerging from  its depths. They were the same whom Apollyon and ourselves had  persecuted with taunts, and gibes, and scalding steam, at the  commencement of our journey--the same whose unworldly aspect and  impressive words had stirred my conscience amid the wild revellers of  Vanity Fair.    \"How amazingly well those men have got on,\" cried I to Mr.  Smoothit--away. \"I wish we were secure of as good a reception.\"    \"Never fear, never fear!\" answered my friend. \"Come, make haste; the  ferry boat will be off directly, and in three minutes you will be on  the other side of the river. No doubt you will find coaches to carry  you up to the city gates.\"    A steam ferry boat, the last improvement on this important route, lay  at the river side, puffing, snorting, and emitting all those other  disagreeable utterances which betoken the departure to be immediate. I  hurried on board with the rest of the passengers, most of whom were in  great perturbation: some bawling out for their baggage; some tearing  their hair and exclaiming that the boat would explode or sink; some  already pale with the heaving of the stream; some gazing affrighted at  the ugly aspect of the steersman; and some still dizzy with the  slumberous influences of the Enchanted Ground. Looking back to the  shore, I was amazed to discern Mr. Smooth-it-away waving his hand in  token of farewell.    \"Don't you go over to the Celestial City?\" exclaimed I.    \"Oh, no!\" answered he with a queer smile, and that same disagreeable  contortion of visage which I had remarked in the inhabitants of the  Dark Valley. \"Oh, no! I have come thus far only for the sake of your  pleasant company. Good-by! We shall meet again.\"    And then did my excellent friend Mr. Smooth-it-away laugh outright, in  the midst of which cachinnation a smoke-wreath issued from his mouth  and nostrils, while a twinkle of lurid flame darted out of either eye,  proving indubitably that his heart was all of a red blaze. The impudent  fiend! To deny the existence of Tophet, when he felt its fiery tortures  raging within his breast. I rushed to the side of the boat, intending  to fling myself on shore; but the wheels, as they began their  revolutions, threw a dash of spray over me so cold--so deadly cold,  with the chill that will never leave those waters until Death be  drowned in his own river--that with a shiver and a heartquake I awoke.  Thank Heaven it was a Dream!        THE PROCESSION OF LIFE    Life figures itself to me as a festal or funereal procession. All of us  have our places, and are to move onward under the direction of the  Chief Marshal. The grand difficulty results from the invariably  mistaken principles on which the deputy marshals seek to arrange this  immense concourse of people, so much more numerous than those that  train their interminable length through streets and highways in times  of political excitement. Their scheme is ancient, far beyond the memory  of man or even the record of history, and has hitherto been very little  modified by the innate sense of something wrong, and the dim perception  of better methods, that have disquieted all the ages through which the  procession has taken its march. Its members are classified by the  merest external circumstances, and thus are more certain to be thrown  out of their true positions than if no principle of arrangement were  attempted. In one part of the procession we see men of landed estate or  moneyed capital gravely keeping each other company, for the  preposterous reason that they chance to have a similar standing in the  tax-gatherer's book. Trades and professions march together with  scarcely a more real bond of union. In this manner, it cannot be  denied, people are disentangled from the mass and separated into  various classes according to certain apparent relations; all have some  artificial badge which the world, and themselves among the first, learn  to consider as a genuine characteristic. Fixing our attention on such  outside shows of similarity or difference, we lose sight of those  realities by which nature, fortune, fate, or Providence has constituted  for every man a brotherhood, wherein it is one great office of human  wisdom to classify him. When the mind has once accustomed itself to a  proper arrangement of the Procession of Life, or a true classification  of society, even though merely speculative, there is thenceforth a  satisfaction which pretty well suffices for itself without the aid of  any actual reformation in the order of march.    For instance, assuming to myself the power of marshalling the aforesaid  procession, I direct a trumpeter to send forth a blast loud enough to  be heard from hence to China; and a herald, with world-pervading voice,  to make proclamation for a certain class of mortals to take their  places. What shall be their principle of union? After all, an external  one, in comparison with many that might be found, yet far more real  than those which the world has selected for a similar purpose. Let all  who are afflicted with like physical diseases form themselves into  ranks.    Our first attempt at classification is not very successful. It may  gratify the pride of aristocracy to reflect that disease, more than any  other circumstance of human life, pays due observance to the  distinctions which rank and wealth, and poverty and lowliness, have  established among mankind. Some maladies are rich and precious, and  only to be acquired by the right of inheritance or purchased with gold.  Of this kind is the gout, which serves as a bond of brotherhood to the  purple-visaged gentry, who obey the herald's voice, and painfully  hobble from all civilized regions of the globe to take their post in  the grand procession. In mercy to their toes, let us hope that the  march may not be long. The Dyspeptics, too, are people of good standing  in the world. For them the earliest salmon is caught in our eastern  rivers, and the shy woodcock stains the dry leaves with his blood in  his remotest haunts, and the turtle comes from the far Pacific Islands  to be gobbled up in soup. They can afford to flavor all their dishes  with indolence, which, in spite of the general opinion, is a sauce more  exquisitely piquant than appetite won by exercise. Apoplexy is another  highly respectable disease. We will rank together all who have the  symptom of dizziness in the brain, and as fast as any drop by the way  supply their places with new members of the board of aldermen.    On the other hand, here come whole tribes of people whose physical  lives are but a deteriorated variety of life, and themselves a meaner  species of mankind; so sad an effect has been wrought by the tainted  breath of cities, scanty and unwholesome food, destructive modes of  labor, and the lack of those moral supports that might partially have  counteracted such bad influences. Behold here a train of house  painters, all afflicted with a peculiar sort of colic. Next in place we  will marshal those workmen in cutlery, who have breathed a fatal  disorder into their lungs with the impalpable dust of steel. Tailors  and shoemakers, being sedentary men, will chiefly congregate into one  part of the procession and march under similar banners of disease; but  among them we may observe here and there a sickly student, who has left  his health between the leaves of classic volumes; and clerks, likewise,  who have caught their deaths on high official stools; and men of genius  too, who have written sheet after sheet with pens dipped in their  heart's blood. These are a wretched quaking, short-breathed set. But  what is this cloud of pale-cheeked, slender girls, who disturb the ear  with the multiplicity of their short, dry coughs? They are  seamstresses, who have plied the daily and nightly needle in the  service of master tailors and close-fisted"]]]
