When a year had passed a beautiful son was born to her, and she thought  no more of the little man, till all of a sudden one day he stepped into  her room and said: \"Now give me what you promised.\" The Queen was in a  great state, and offered the little man all the riches in her kingdom if  he would only leave her the child. But the manikin said: \"No, a living  creature is dearer to me than all the treasures in the world.\" Then the  Queen began to cry and sob so bitterly that the little man was sorry for  her, and said: \"I'll give you three days to guess my name, and if you  find it out in that time you may keep your child.\"    Then the Queen pondered the whole night over all the names she had ever  heard, and sent a messenger to scour the land, and to pick up far and  near any names he could come across. When the little man arrived on the  following day she began with Kasper, Melchior, Belshazzar, and all the  other names she knew, in a string, but at each one the manikin called  out: \"That's not my name.\" The next day she sent to inquire the names  of all the people in the neighborhood, and had a long list of the  most uncommon and extraordinary for the little man when he made  his appearance. \"Is your name, perhaps, Sheepshanks Cruickshanks,  Spindleshanks?\" but he always replied: \"That's not my name.\" On the  third day the messenger returned and announced: \"I have not been able to  find any new names, but as I came upon a high hill round the corner of  the wood, where the foxes and hares bid each other good-night, I saw  a little house, and in front of the house burned a fire, and round  the fire sprang the most grotesque little man, hopping on one leg and  crying:      \"To-morrow I brew, to-day I bake,      And then the child away I'll take;      For little deems my royal dame      That Rumpelstiltzkin is my name!\"      You can imagine the Queen's delight at hearing the name, and when the  little man stepped in shortly afterward and asked: \"Now, my lady Queen,  what's my name?\" she asked first: \"Is your name Conrad?\" \"No.\" \"Is your  name Harry?\" \"No.\" \"Is your name perhaps, Rumpelstiltzkin?\" \"Some demon  has told you that! some demon has told you that!\" screamed the little  man, and in his rage drove his right foot so far into the ground that it  sank in up to his waist; then in a passion he seized the left foot with  both hands and tore himself in two.(1)      (1) Grimm.          BEAUTY AND THE BEAST      Once upon a time, in a very far-off country, there lived a merchant who  had been so fortunate in all his undertakings that he was enormously  rich. As he had, however, six sons and six daughters, he found that his  money was not too much to let them all have everything they fancied, as  they were accustomed to do.    But one day a most unexpected misfortune befell them. Their house  caught fire and was speedily burnt to the ground, with all the splendid  furniture, the books, pictures, gold, silver, and precious goods it  contained; and this was only the beginning of their troubles. Their  father, who had until this moment prospered in all ways, suddenly lost  every ship he had upon the sea, either by dint of pirates, shipwreck,  or fire. Then he heard that his clerks in distant countries, whom he  trusted entirely, had proved unfaithful; and at last from great wealth  he fell into the direst poverty.    All that he had left was a little house in a desolate place at least a  hundred leagues from the town in which he had lived, and to this he was  forced to retreat with his children, who were in despair at the idea of  leading such a different life. Indeed, the daughters at first hoped  that their friends, who had been so numerous while they were rich, would  insist on their staying in their houses now they no longer possessed  one. But they soon found that they were left alone, and that their  former friends even attributed their misfortunes to their own  extravagance, and showed no intention of offering them any help. So  nothing was left for them but to take their departure to the cottage,  which stood in the midst of a dark forest, and seemed to be the most  dismal place upon the face of the earth. As they were too poor to have  any servants, the girls had to work hard, like peasants, and the sons,  for their part, cultivated the fields to earn their living. Roughly  clothed, and living in the simplest way, the girls regretted unceasingly  the luxuries and amusements of their former life; only the youngest  tried to be brave and cheerful. She had been as sad as anyone when  misfortune overtook her father, but, soon recovering her natural gaiety,  she set to work to make the best of things, to amuse her father and  brothers as well as she could, and to try to persuade her sisters to  join her in dancing and singing. But they would do nothing of the sort,  and, because she was not as doleful as themselves, they declared that  this miserable life was all she was fit for. But she was really far  prettier and cleverer than they were; indeed, she was so lovely that she  was always called Beauty. After two years, when they were all beginning  to get used to their new life, something happened to disturb their  tranquillity. Their father received the news that one of his ships,  which he had believed to be lost, had come safely into port with a rich  cargo. All the sons and daughters at once thought that their poverty  was at an end, and wanted to set out directly for the town; but their  father, who was more prudent, begged them to wait a little, and, though  it was harvest time, and he could ill be spared, determined to go  himself first, to make inquiries. Only the youngest daughter had any  doubt but that they would soon again be as rich as they were before, or  at least rich enough to live comfortably in some town where they would  find amusement and gay companions once more. So they all loaded their  father with commissions for jewels and dresses which it would have taken  a fortune to buy; only Beauty, feeling sure that it was of no use, did  not ask for anything. Her father, noticing her silence, said: \"And what  shall I bring for you, Beauty?\"    \"The only thing I wish for is to see you come home safely,\" she  answered.    But this only vexed her sisters, who fancied she was blaming them for  having asked for such costly things. Her father, however, was pleased,  but as he thought that at her age she certainly ought to like pretty  presents, he told her to choose something.    \"Well, dear father,\" she said, \"as you insist upon it, I beg that you  will bring me a rose. I have not seen one since we came here, and I love  them so much.\"    So the merchant set out and reached the town as quickly as possible, but  only to find that his former companions, believing him to be dead, had  divided between them the goods which the ship had brought; and after  six months of trouble and expense he found himself as poor as when he  started, having been able to recover only just enough to pay the cost of  his journey. To make matters worse, he was obliged to leave the town  in the most terrible weather, so that by the time he was within a few  leagues of his home he was almost exhausted with cold and fatigue.  Though he knew it would take some hours to get through the forest, he  was so anxious to be at his journey's end that he resolved to go on;  but night overtook him, and the deep snow and bitter frost made it  impossible for his horse to carry him any further. Not a house was to  be seen; the only shelter he could get was the hollow trunk of a great  tree, and there he crouched all the night which seemed to him the  longest he had ever known. In spite of his weariness the howling of the  wolves kept him awake, and even when at last the day broke he was not  much better off, for the falling snow had covered up every path, and he  did not know which way to turn.    At length he made out some sort of track, and though at the beginning it  was so rough and slippery that he fell down more than once, it presently  became easier, and led him into an avenue of trees which ended in a  splendid castle. It seemed to the merchant very strange that no snow  had fallen in the avenue, which was entirely composed of orange trees,  covered with flowers and fruit. When he reached the first court of the  castle he saw before him a flight of agate steps, and went up them, and  passed through several splendidly furnished rooms. The pleasant warmth  of the air revived him, and he felt very hungry; but there seemed to be  nobody in all this vast and splendid palace whom he could ask to give  him something to eat. Deep silence reigned everywhere, and at last,  tired of roaming through empty rooms and galleries, he stopped in a room  smaller than the rest, where a clear fire was burning and a couch was  drawn up closely to it. Thinking that this must be prepared for someone  who was expected, he sat down to wait till he should come, and very soon  fell into a sweet sleep.    When his extreme hunger wakened him after several hours, he was still  alone; but a little table, upon which was a good dinner, had been drawn  up close to him, and, as he had eaten nothing for twenty-four hours, he  lost no time in beginning his meal, hoping that he might soon have an  opportunity of thanking his considerate entertainer, whoever it might  be. But no one appeared, and even after another long sleep, from which  he awoke completely refreshed, there was no sign of anybody, though a  fresh meal of dainty cakes and fruit was prepared upon the little table  at his elbow. Being naturally timid, the silence began to terrify him,  and he resolved to search once more through all the rooms; but it was of  no use. Not even a servant was to be seen; there was no sign of life in  the palace! He began to wonder what he should do, and to amuse  himself"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50302"],[0,"The Rise and Fall of Nauvoo (#20)"],[1,"be stated--and it is  evident from the written revelation itself, which bears the date of  July 12th, 1843, [3]--that the doctrine was revealed and the practice  of it began before the partial [4] revelation now in the Doctrine and  Covenants was written. As early as 1831 the rightfulness of a plurality  of wives under certain conditions was made known to Joseph Smith.  In the latter part of that year, especially from November 1831, and  through the early months of 1832, the Prophet with Sidney Rigdon as his  assistant was earnestly engaged at Hiram, a village in Portage County,  near Kirtland, Ohio, in translating the Jewish scripture. [5] It must  have been while engaged in that work that the evident approval of God  to the plural marriage system of the ancient patriarchs attracted the  Prophet's attention and led him to make those inquiries of the Lord to  which the opening paragraphs of the written revelation refer, viz:--        Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Joseph, that      inasmuch as you have inquired of my hand, to know and understand      wherein I, the Lord, justified my servants Abraham, Isaac and      Jacob; as also Moses, David and Solomon, my servants, as touching      the principle and doctrine of their having many wives and      concubines: behold! and lo, I am the Lord thy God, and will answer      thee as touching this matter.    The doctrine revealed at that time to the Prophet, however, was not  to be made known to the world; but Joseph did make known what had  been revealed to him to a few trusted friends, among whom were Oliver  Cowdery and Lyman E. Johnson, the latter confiding what the Prophet  had taught him to Orson Pratt, his missionary companion. With these  and a few other exceptions, perhaps, the knowledge of the truth and  righteousness of this principle of the future marriage system of The  Church was locked up in the bosom of the Prophet of God.    About 1840, however, the Prophet began to be moved upon to make known  the doctrine to others. He taught the principle to Joseph Bates Noble  for one, as early as the fall of 1840. According to the affidavit of  Noble, given before James Jack, a notary public, in and for the county  of Salt Lake, Utah, in June, 1869, Joseph Smith declared to Noble  that \"he had received a revelation from God on the subject, and that  an angel of the Lord had commanded him (Joseph Smith) to move forward  in the said order of marriage; and further, that the said Joseph  Smith requested him (Joseph B. Noble) to step forward and assist him  in carrying out the said principle.\" This same man Noble gives the  following affidavit with reference to the introduction of the practice  of this principle by Joseph Smith, the Prophet:        Territory of Utah, County of Salt Lake, ss        Be it remembered that on this 26th day of June, A. D. 1869,      personally appeared before me, James Jack, a Notary Public in and      for said county, Joseph Bates Noble, who was by me sworn in due      form of law, and upon his oath saith, that on the fifth day of      April, A. D., 1841, at the City of Nauvoo, County of Hancock, State      of Illinois, he married or sealed Louisa Beaman, to Joseph Smith,      President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,      according to the order of celestial marriage revealed to the said      Joseph Smith.                                                 (Signed) JOSEPH B. NOBLE.        Subscribed and sworn to by the said Joseph Bates Noble the day and      year first above written.                                                JAMES JACK, Notary Public.    The introduction of the practice of plural marriage by the Prophet  then began even before the return of the Twelve from England. On their  return Joseph soon began to teach the principle to them, and urged upon  them the importance of putting it into practice. The dread with which  the doctrine was regarded, the prejudices against it in the hearts of  those faithful men who accepted it as a revelation from God through  the Prophet, are all illustrated in the reflections and testimony of  Elder John Taylor, one of the Twelve at that time, and subsequently  the President of the Church. And here let me repeat what I said in his  biography some years ago: \"The world never made a greater mistake than  when it supposed that plural marriage was hailed with delight by the  Elders who were commanded of the Lord to introduce its practice in this  generation. They saw clearly that it would bring additional reproach  upon them from the world; that it would run counter to the traditions  and prejudices of society, as, indeed, it was contrary to their own  traditions; that their motives would be misunderstood or misconstrued.  All this they saw, and naturally shrunk from the undertaking required  of them by the revelation of God.\" And now Elder Taylor:--        Joseph Smith told the Twelve that if this law was not practiced, if      they would not enter into this covenant, then the Kingdom of God      could not go one step further. Now, we did not feel like preventing      the Kingdom of God from going forward. We professed to be the      Apostles of the Lord, and did not feel like putting ourselves      in a position to retard the progress of the Kingdom of God. The      revelation says that \"All those who have this law revealed unto      them must obey the same.\" Now, that is not my word. I did not make      it. It was the Prophet of God who revealed that to us in Nauvoo,      and I bear witness of this solemn fact before God, that he did      reveal this sacred principle to me and others of the Twelve, and      in this revelation it is stated that it is the will and law of God      that \"all those who have this law revealed unto them must obey the      same.\"        I had always entertained strict ideas of virtue, and I felt as a      married man that this was to me, outside of this principle, an      appalling thing to do. The idea of going and asking a young lady      to be married to me when I had already a wife! It was a thing      calculated to stir up feelings from the innermost depths of the      human soul. I had always entertained the strictest regard of      chastity. I had never in my life seen the time when I have known of      a man deceiving a woman--and it is often done in the world, where,      notwithstanding the crime, the man is received into society and the      poor woman is looked upon as a pariah and an outcast--I have always      looked upon such a thing as infamous, and upon such a man as a      villain. * * * Hence, with the feelings I had entertained, nothing      but a knowledge of God, and the revelations of God, and the truth      of them, could have induced me to embrace such a principle as this.        We [the Twelve] seemed to put off, as far as we could, what might      be termed the evil day.        Some time after these things were made known unto us, I was riding      out of Nauvoo on horseback, and met Joseph Smith coming in, he,      too, being on horseback. * * * I bowed to Joseph, and having done      the same to me, he said: \"Stop;\" and he looked at me very intently.      \"Look here,\" said he, \"those things that have been spoken of must      be fulfilled, and if they are not entered into right away the keys      will be turned.\"        Well, what did I do? Did I feel to stand in the way of this great,      eternal principle, and treat lightly the things of God? No. I      replied: \"Brother Joseph, I will try and carry these things out.\"    So indeed he did, for within two years, in Nauvoo, he married Elizabeth  Haigham, Jane Ballantyne and Mary A. Oakley.    After this the testimony is abundant that plural marriage as well as  marriage for eternity was abundantly practiced in Nauvoo, [6] though  the revelation which made its rightfulness known was not written until  July 12th, 1843.    I have remarked in the opening of this chapter that the consideration  of this subject at this period of Nauvoo's history would aid the reader  to understand more clearly many things in the subsequent events we  have to relate. It is to be observed first of all that this principle  of plural marriage had to be introduced secretly; first, because of  the traditions and prejudices of the Saints themselves; and, secondly,  because of the advantage that their enemies surrounding them would have  when once the doctrine was publicly proclaimed. This enforced secrecy,  then, which a reasonable prudence demanded, gave rise to apparent  contradictions between the public utterances of leading brethren in The  Church and their practice. Wicked men took advantage of the situation  and brought sorrow to the hearts of the innocent and reproach upon  The Church. Some, possessed of a zeal without wisdom, knowing of this  doctrine, hastened without authority to make public proclamation of it  and had to be silenced, as, for instance, a number of Elders who were  reproved by Hyrum Smith for preaching this doctrine at a branch of  The Church at China Creek, near Nauvoo; [7] and later one Hiram Brown  who did the same thing in Lapeer County, Michigan; for which he was  disfellowshiped from The Church and notified by Joseph and Hyrum to  attend the conference in April of that year to give a further account  of his proceedings. [8]    Then again there were others who falsely taught that the Prophet  approved of promiscuous intercourse between the sexes, and that there  was no sin in such relations so long as they were kept secret and  brought no scandal upon the community. This afforded villains their  opportunity, and such men as John C. Bennett; the Laws, Wilson and  William; Dr. Foster; the young Higbees, Chancy L., and Francis M.; and  others, to reap their harvest of wickedness. There was necessarily  enough of mystery in the movements of the Prophet and his faithful  brethren connected with the matter of plural marriage to give something"]]]
