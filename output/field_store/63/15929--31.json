In this revelation instruction was given that no one was to preach  or to build up the Church of Christ without being properly ordained  by one having authority; the Elders were taught the principles which  they should declare, and they were particularly enjoined to teach by  the Spirit of the Lord; and if they received it not, they were told  not to teach; the moral law was plainly declared and the dreadful  consequence of unchastity was strongly emphasized; he that sinned  and repented not was to be cast out; consecration of property to  sustain the poor was enforced; home manufacture was encouraged by the  requirements that dress should be plain and its beauty the beauty  which the Saints' own labor gave it; cleanliness was commanded and  idleness was condemned; the proper treatment of the sick and the  mourning for the dead were made known: that glorious promise--the  complete fulfillment of which has been a solace and a source of  unbounded joy to the Latter-day Saints through all the years which  have intervened since it was given--was made, \"that those that die in  me [Jesus Christ] shall not taste of death, for it shall be sweet unto  them;\" to those who had various infirmities and had faith, miraculous  healing was promised; honesty of dealing was enjoined; instructions  concerning the new translation of the Scriptures were given; when asked  for, revelation upon revelation and knowledge upon knowledge were  promised; the converts in the east were to be taught by the Elders to  flee to the west to escape future trouble: the Saints were to receive  Church covenants sufficient to establish them in Ohio and in the New  Jerusalem; he that lacked wisdom was encouraged to ask and he should  be given liberally and without upbraiding; commandments were given  respecting fornicators, adulterers, and other transgressors, and the  manner they should be dealt with.    Altogether this was a most important revelation. It threw a flood of  light upon a great variety of subjects and settled many important  questions. Faithful men and women were greatly delighted at being  members of a Church which the Lord acknowledged as His own, and to  which He communicated His word through his inspired Prophet as he did  at this time.    While Joseph was thus administering among the people, in the same month  of February, 1831, the Lord commanded him to call the Elders of the  Church together from the east and the west, and from the north and  south, to receive in solemn assemblage the pouring out of His Spirit  upon them. Pursuant to this requirement a General Conference of the  Church was appointed to be held in Kirtland on the 6th day of June,  1831.    At no time during the Prophet's career did the care of the poor escape  his attention or become a matter of indifference to him. He was a  man of large benevolence, and his sympathies were quickly aroused  by any tale of sorrow or appeal for relief. In the most busy and  trying periods of his life those who went to him for counsel in their  troubles, always found him willing to listen, and they were sure to  receive encouragement and assistance. To extend comfort to the bruised  spirit, and to help the needy and distressed appeared a constant  pleasure to him. His hospitality, also, was a marked feature in his  character. His house was always open to entertain the stranger. One  of the most cherished recollections of many of the old members of  the Church is the kindness with which they were treated by \"Brother  Joseph,\" and the warm welcome he gave them to his house upon their  arrival at Kirtland and other places where he lived.    In the revelation above referred to the Lord said:        Ye must visit the poor and the needy and administer to their      relief, that they may be kept until all things may be done      according to my law which ye have received.    In other revelations which the Lord gave to Joseph, frequent mention  was made of the poor and the provisions which should be made for  their sustenance. Before leaving Fayette, New York, the Church was  commanded to appoint certain men to look to the poor and the needy and  administer to their relief that they should not suffer. Directly after  reaching Kirtland, Joseph received a revelation in which the Church  was told by the Lord to remember the poor and consecrate properties  for their support, that every man who had need might be amply supplied  and receive according to his wants. Again, the command was given to  \"remember in all things the poor and the needy, the sick and the  afflicted, for,\" the Lord said, \"he that doeth not these things the  same is not my disciple.\"    A clear exposition of the duty laid upon every believer in the gospel  as revealed in this last dispensation, if he had been blessed with  abundance, to share of his wealth with the poor, was given in a  subsequent revelation in the following striking language:        Wo unto you rich men, that will not give your substance to the      poor, for your riches will canker your souls; and this shall be      your lamentation in the day of visitation, and of judgment, and of      indignation--the harvest is past, the summer is ended, and my soul      is not saved!    In this way the duty of the Saints towards the poor--this practical and  essential part of true religion--was deeply impressed upon them and  kept constantly before them. In numerous paragraphs of the revelations  given to the Church during those early days, were the members taught  that the Lord intended His people to be equal in temporal things--that  class distinctions should not exist among them because of the riches of  some and the poverty of others. The effect of those early revelations  and teachings upon this subject has been visible upon the people from  the time they were given to the present. There has been a continual  yearning for such a higher life--such a blessed and heavenly condition  of society--as the practical adaptation and realization of the truths  of the revelations will bring about. Amid the dangers with which many  of the faithful members have thought the Church has been menaced  through the increase of wealth of some of their number, they have  always been cheered by the assurance that the day was not far distant  when the injunction would be carried out, which the Lord gave in the  days of which we write: \"Let every man deal honestly, and be alike  among this people, and receive alike, that ye may be one, even as I  have commanded you.\"    This has been the ideal condition to which all have lifted their  eyes. The effect has been that the wide difference which exists in  the world between the rich and the poor--with the one class wealthy  beyond all safety and reason, and the other class wretchedly poor even  to starvation--has always been felt to be terribly wrong and contrary  to the will of God. It was this bond of union and mutual help in a  temporal sense, established by the command of Jehovah, and constantly  taught by the Prophet Joseph and his co-laborers, which enabled the  Saints through all the succeeding persecutions to move and endure as  one family, all suffering measurably alike. Since the days of the  Savior there has never been until Joseph Smith's time, a system of  social life in which honorable poverty received such consideration and  such help. Concerning the poor at this early day the Lord said:        They shall see the Kingdom of God coming in power and great glory      unto their deliverance; for the fatness of the earth shall be      theirs.        For behold, the Lord shall come and his recompense shall be with      him, and he shall reward every man, and the poor shall rejoice;      and their generations shall inherit the earth from generation to      generation forever and ever.    The Church at Kirtland soon began to assume an importance which alarmed  its opponents. Previous to this time falsehood and persecution had been  directed almost entirely against the Prophet himself. But as the work  extended and the Church increased in its membership, the father of lies  did not confine his attacks to Joseph; he sent forth his countless  emissaries to provoke hatred and wrath against the Church itself. Yet  nothing tangible up to this time could be alleged against the Prophet  Joseph or the Church which God organized through his instrumentality.  Here at Kirtland, and at this time, however, the foes of truth united  in formulating and publishing to the world all the calumnies which  their wicked imaginations could devise. None were more active in this  infamous business than certain fearful and lying priests and their  bigoted adherents; and it is from this fruitful source of accusation  and slander that subsequent defamers of the Prophet's early life have  drawn many of their falsehoods.    To the Saints, however, there was compensation for these attacks in the  word of the Lord which they received in plainness and power at this  time through the Prophet. He was inspired to write many revelations  which were of priceless value to the Church. Principles and doctrines,  instructions and warnings, promises and prophecies, were given with  a simplicity and clearness suited to the capacity of the humblest  understanding, and yet the truths they contained are so sublime as to  furnish instruction and food for profound thought to men of the highest  attainments and the most extensive cultivation.    Among several revelations given during this month of March, 1831,  there was one of more than ordinary interest to the Saints then, and  the lapse of time has only added to its importance in the minds of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5999"],[0,"Guy Mannering; or, The Astrologer — Complete (#20)"],[1," Laird was clearing his voice to speak, and  thrusting his hand in his pocket to find a half-crown; the gipsy waited  neither for his reply nor his donation, but strode down the hill to  overtake the caravan.    Ellangowan rode pensively home; and it was remarkable that he did not  mention this interview to any of his family. The groom was not so  reserved; he told the story at great length to a full audience in the  kitchen, and concluded by swearing, that 'if ever the devil spoke by the  mouth of a woman, he had spoken by that of Meg Merrilies that blessed  day.'              CHAPTER  IX       Paint Scotland greeting ower her thrissle,       Her mutchkin stoup as toom's a whistle,       And d--n'd excisemen in a bustle,       Seizing a stell,       Triumphant crushin't like a mussel,       Or lampit shell             BURNS.      During the period of Mr. Bertram's active magistracy, he did not forget  the affairs of the revenue. Smuggling, for which the Isle of Man then  afforded peculiar facilities, was general, or rather universal, all along  the southwestern coast of Scotland. Almost all the common people were  engaged in these practices; the gentry connived at them, and the officers  of the revenue were frequently discountenanced in the exercise of their  duty by those who should have protected them.    There was at this period, employed as a riding-officer or supervisor, in  that part of the country a certain Francis Kennedy, already named in our  narrative--a stout, resolute, and active man, who had made seizures to a  great amount, and was proportionally hated by those who had an interest  in the fair trade, as they called the pursuit of these contraband  adventurers. This person was natural son to a gentleman of good family,  owing to which circumstance, and to his being of a jolly, convivial  disposition, and singing a good song, he was admitted to the occasional  society of the gentlemen of the country, and was a member of several of  their clubs for practising athletic games, at which he was particularly  expert.    At Ellangowan Kennedy was a frequent and always an acceptable guest. His  vivacity relieved Mr. Bertram of the trouble of thought, and the labour  which it cost him to support a detailed communication of ideas; while the  daring and dangerous exploits which he had undertaken in the discharge of  his office formed excellent conversation. To all these revenue adventures  did the Laird of Ellangowan seriously incline, and the amusement which he  derived from Kennedy's society formed an excellent reason for  countenancing and assisting the narrator in the execution of his  invidious and hazardous duty.    'Frank Kennedy,' he said, 'was a gentleman, though on the wrang side of  the blanket; he was connected with the family of Ellangowan through the  house of Glengubble. The last Laird of Glengubble would have brought the  estate into the Ellangowan line; but, happening to go to Harrigate, he  there met with Miss Jean Hadaway--by the by, the Green Dragon at  Harrigate is the best house of the twa--but for Frank Kennedy, he's in  one sense a gentleman born, and it's a shame not to support him against  these blackguard smugglers.'    After this league had taken place between judgment and execution, it  chanced that Captain Dirk Hatteraick had landed a cargo of spirits and  other contraband goods upon the beach not far from Ellangowan, and,  confiding in the indifference with which the Laird had formerly regarded  similar infractions of the law, he was neither very anxious to conceal  nor to expedite the transaction. The consequence was that Mr. Frank  Kennedy, armed with a warrant from Ellangowan, and supported by some of  the Laird's people who knew the country, and by a party of military,  poured down upon the kegs, bales, and bags, and after a desperate affray,  in which severe wounds were given and received, succeeded in clapping the  broad arrow upon the articles, and bearing them off in triumph to the  next custom-house. Dirk Hatteraick vowed, in Dutch, German, and English,  a deep and full revenge, both against the gauger and his abettors; and  all who knew him thought it likely he would keep his word.    A few days after the departure of the gipsy tribe, Mr. Bertram asked his  lady one morning at breakfast whether this was not little Harry's  birthday.    'Five years auld exactly, this blessed day,' answered the lady; 'so we  may look into the English gentleman's paper.'    Mr. Bertram liked to show his authority in trifles. 'No, my dear, not  till to-morrow. The last time I was at quarter-sessions the sheriff told  us that DIES--that dies inceptus--in short, you don't understand Latin,  but it means that a term-day is not begun till it's ended.'    'That sounds like nonsense, my dear.'    'May be so, my dear; but it may be very good law for all that. I am sure,  speaking of term-days, I wish, as Frank Kennedy says, that Whitsunday  would kill Martinmas and be hanged for the murder; for there I have got a  letter about that interest of Jenny Cairns's, and deil a tenant's been at  the Place yet wi' a boddle of rent, nor will not till Candlemas. But,  speaking of Frank Kennedy, I daresay he'll be here the day, for he was  away round to Wigton to warn a king's ship that's lying in the bay about  Dirk Hatteraick's lugger being on the coast again, and he'll be back this  day; so we'll have a bottle of claret and drink little Harry's health.'    'I wish,' replied the lady, 'Frank Kennedy would let Dirk Hatteraick  alane. What needs he make himself mair busy than other folk? Cannot he  sing his sang, and take his drink, and draw his salary, like Collector  Snail, honest man, that never fashes ony body? And I wonder at you,  Laird, for meddling and making. Did we ever want to send for tea or  brandy frae the borough-town when Dirk Hatteraick used to come quietly  into the bay?'    'Mrs. Bertram, you know nothing of these matters. Do you think it becomes  a magistrate to let his own house be made a receptacle for smuggled  goods? Frank Kennedy will show you the penalties in the act, and ye ken  yoursell they used to put their run goods into the Auld Place of  Ellangowan up by there.'    'Oh dear, Mr. Bertram, and what the waur were the wa's and the vault o'  the auld castle for having a whin kegs o' brandy in them at an orra time?  I am sure ye were not obliged to ken ony thing about it; and what the  waur was the King that the lairds here got a soup o' drink and the ladies  their drap o' tea at a reasonable rate?--it's a shame to them to pit such  taxes on them!--and was na I much the better of these Flanders head and  pinners that Dirk Hatteraick sent me a' the way from Antwerp? It will be  lang or the King sends me ony thing, or Frank Kennedy either. And then ye  would quarrel with these gipsies too! I expect every day to hear the  barnyard's in a low.'    'I tell you once more, my dear, you don't understand these things--and  there's Frank Kennedy coming galloping up the avenue.'    'Aweel! aweel! Ellangowan,' said the lady, raising her voice as the Laird  left the room, 'I wish ye may understand them yoursell, that's a'!'    From this nuptial dialogue the Laird joyfully escaped to meet his  faithful friend, Mr. Kennedy, who arrived in high spirits. 'For the love  of life, Ellangowan,' he said, 'get up to the castle! you'll see that old  fox Dirk Hatteraick, and his Majesty's hounds in full cry after him.' So  saying, he flung his horse's bridle to a boy, and ran up the ascent to  the old castle, followed by the Laird, and indeed by several others of  the family, alarmed by the sound of guns from the sea, now distinctly  heard.    On gaining that part of the ruins which commanded the most extensive  outlook, they saw a lugger, with all her canvass crowded, standing across  the bay, closely pursued by a sloop of war, that kept firing upon the  chase from her bows, which the lugger returned with her stern-chasers.  'They're but at long bowls yet,' cried Kennedy, in great exultation, 'but  they will be closer by and by. D--n him, he's starting his cargo! I see  the good Nantz pitching overboard, keg after keg! That's a d--d ungenteel  thing of Mr. Hatteraick, as I shall let him know by and by. Now, now!  they've got the wind of him! that's it, that's it! Hark to him! hark to  him! Now, my dogs! now, my dogs! Hark to Ranger, hark!'    'I think,' said the old gardener to one of the maids, 'the ganger's fie,'  by which word the common people express those violent spirits which they  think a presage of death.    Meantime the chase continued. The lugger, being piloted with great  ability, and using every nautical shift to make her escape, had now  reached, and was about to double, the headland which formed the extreme  point of land on the left side of the bay, when a ball having hit the  yard in the slings, the mainsail fell upon the deck. The consequence of  this accident appeared inevitable, but could not be seen by the  spectators; for the vessel, which had just doubled the headland, lost  steerage, and fell out of their sight behind the promontory. The sloop of  war crowded all sail to pursue, but she had stood too close upon the  cape, so that they were obliged to wear the vessel for fear of going  ashore, and to make a large tack back into the bay, in order to recover  sea-room enough to double the headland.    'They 'll lose her, by--, cargo and lugger, one or both,' said Kennedy;  'I must gallop away to the Point of Warroch (this was the headland so  often mentioned), and make them a signal where she has drifted to on the  other side. Good-bye for an hour, Ellangowan; get out the gallon  punch-bowl and plenty of lemons. I'll stand for the French article by the  time I come back, and we'll drink the young Laird's health in a bowl that  would swim the collector's yawl.' So saying, he mounted his horse and  galloped off.    About a mile from the house, and upon the verge of the woods, which, "]]]
