In this way I made a  reasonable profit. I brought away money of all denominations from the  island, and nearly all there was, so far as I could find out.    [Illustration: The house of the king.]    Juan Fernandez, as a place of call, is a lovely spot. The hills are  well wooded, the valleys fertile, and pouring down through many  ravines are streams of pure water. There are no serpents on the  island, and no wild beasts other than pigs and goats, of which I saw a  number, with possibly a dog or two. The people lived without the use  of rum or beer of any sort. There was not a police officer or a lawyer  among them. The domestic economy of the island was simplicity itself.  The fashions of Paris did not affect the inhabitants; each dressed  according to his own taste. Although there was no doctor, the people  were all healthy, and the children were all beautiful. There were  about forty-five souls on the island all told. The adults were mostly  from the mainland of South America. One lady there, from Chile, who  made a flying-jib for the _Spray_, taking her pay in tallow, would be  called a belle at Newport. Blessed island of Juan Fernandez! Why  Alexander Selkirk ever left you was more than I could make out.    [Illustration: Robinson Crusoe's cave.]    A large ship which had arrived some time before, on fire, had been  stranded at the head of the bay, and as the sea smashed her to pieces  on the rocks, after the fire was drowned, the islanders picked up the  timbers and utilized them in the construction of houses, which  naturally presented a ship-like appearance. The house of the king of  Juan Fernandez, Manuel Carroza by name, besides resembling the ark,  wore a polished brass knocker on its only door, which was painted  green. In front of this gorgeous entrance was a flag-mast all ataunto,  and near it a smart whale-boat painted red and blue, the delight of  the king's old age.    I of course made a pilgrimage to the old lookout place at the top of  the mountain, where Selkirk spent many days peering into the distance  for the ship which came at last. From a tablet fixed into the face of  the rock I copied these words, inscribed in Arabic capitals:    /*[4]         IN MEMORY             OF      ALEXANDER SELKIRK,           MARINER,  */    /#       A native of Largo, in the county of Fife, Scotland, who lived on       this island in complete solitude for four years and four months. He       was landed from the <i>Cinque Ports</i> galley, 96 tons, 18 guns, A. D.       1704, and was taken off in the <i>Duke</i>, privateer, 12th February,       1709. He died Lieutenant of H. M. S. <i>Weymouth</i>, A. D. 1723,[A]       aged 47. This tablet is erected near Selkirk's lookout, by       Commodore Powell and the officers of H. M. S. <i>Topaze</i>, A. D. 1868.  #/    [A] Mr. J. Cuthbert Hadden, in the \"Century Magazine\" for July, 1899,  shows that the tablet is in error as to Selkirk's death. It should be  1721    The cave in which Selkirk dwelt while on the island is at the head of  the bay now called Robinson Crusoe Bay. It is around a bold headland  west of the present anchorage and landing. Ships have anchored there,  but it affords a very indifferent berth. Both of these anchorages are  exposed to north winds, which, however, do not reach home with much  violence. The holding-ground being good in the first-named bay to the  eastward, the anchorage there may be considered safe, although the  undertow at times makes it wild riding.    I visited Robinson Crusoe Bay in a boat, and with some difficulty  landed through the surf near the cave, which I entered. I found it dry  and inhabitable. It is located in a beautiful nook sheltered by high  mountains from all the severe storms that sweep over the island, which  are not many; for it lies near the limits of the trade-wind regions,  being in latitude 35 1/2 degrees. The island is about fourteen miles  in length, east and west, and eight miles in width; its height is over  three thousand feet. Its distance from Chile, to which country it  belongs, is about three hundred and forty miles.    Juan Fernandez was once a convict station. A number of caves in which  the prisoners were kept, damp, unwholesome dens, are no longer in use,  and no more prisoners are sent to the island.    The pleasantest day I spent on the island, if not the pleasantest on  my whole voyage, was my last day on shore,--but by no means because it  was the last,--when the children of the little community, one and all,  went out with me to gather wild fruits for the voyage. We found  quinces, peaches, and figs, and the children gathered a basket of  each. It takes very little to please children, and these little ones,  never hearing a word in their lives except Spanish, made the hills  ring with mirth at the sound of words in English. They asked me the  names of all manner of things on the island. We came to a wild  fig-tree loaded with fruit, of which I gave them the English name.  \"Figgies, figgies!\" they cried, while they picked till their baskets  were full. But when I told them that the _cabra_ they pointed out was  only a goat, they screamed with laughter, and rolled on the grass in  wild delight to think that a man had come to their island who would  call a cabra a goat.    [Illustration: The man who called a cabra a goat.]    The first child born on Juan Fernandez, I was told, had become a  beautiful woman and was now a mother. Manuel Carroza and the good soul  who followed him here from Brazil had laid away their only child, a  girl, at the age of seven, in the little churchyard on the point. In  the same half-acre were other mounds among the rough lava rocks, some  marking the burial-place of native-born children, some the  resting-places of seamen from passing ships, landed here to end days  of sickness and get into a sailors' heaven.    The greatest drawback I saw in the island was the want of a school. A  class there would necessarily be small, but to some kind soul who  loved teaching and quietude life on Juan Fernandez would, for a  limited time, be one of delight.    On the morning of May 5, 1896, I sailed from Juan Fernandez, having  feasted on many things, but on nothing sweeter than the adventure  itself of a visit to the home and to the very cave of Robinson Crusoe.  From the island the _Spray_ bore away to the north, passing the island  of St. Felix before she gained the trade-winds, which seemed slow in  reaching their limits.    If the trades were tardy, however, when they did come they came with a  bang, and made up for lost time; and the _Spray_, under reefs,  sometimes one, sometimes two, flew before a gale for a great many  days, with a bone in her mouth, toward the Marquesas, in the west,  which, she made on the forty-third day out, and still kept on sailing.  My time was all taken up those days--not by standing at the helm; no  man, I think, could stand or sit and steer a vessel round the world: I  did better than that; for I sat and read my books, mended my clothes,  or cooked my meals and ate them in peace. I had already found that it  was not good to be alone, and so I made companionship with what there  was around me, sometimes with the universe and sometimes with my own  insignificant self; but my books were always my friends, let fail all  else. Nothing could be easier or more restful than my voyage in the  trade-winds.    I sailed with a free wind day after day, marking the position of my  ship on the chart with considerable precision; but this was done by  intuition, I think, more than by slavish calculations. For one whole  month my vessel held her course true; I had not, the while, so much as  a light in the binnacle. The Southern Cross I saw every night abeam.  The sun every morning came up astern; every evening it went down  ahead. I wished for no other compass to guide me, for these were true.  If I doubted my reckoning after a long time at sea I verified it by  reading the clock aloft made by the Great Architect, and it was right.    There was no denying that the comical side of the strange life  appeared. I awoke, sometimes, to find the sun already shining into my  cabin. I heard water rushing by, with only a thin plank between me and  the depths, and I said, \"How is this?\" But it was all right; it was my  ship on her course, sailing as no other ship had ever sailed before in  the world. The rushing water along her side told me that she was  sailing at full speed. I knew that no human hand was at the helm; I  knew that all was well with \"the hands\" forward, and that there was no  mutiny on board.    The phenomena of ocean meteorology were interesting studies even here  in the trade-winds. I observed that about every seven days the wind  freshened and drew several points farther than usual from the  direction of the pole; that is, it went round from east-southeast to  south-southeast, while at the same time a heavy swell rolled up from  the southwest. All this indicated that gales were going on in the  anti-trades. The wind then hauled day after day as it moderated, till  it stood again at the normal point, east-southeast. This is more or  less the constant state of the winter trades in latitude 12 degrees  S., where I \"ran down the longitude\" for weeks. The sun, we all know,  is the creator of the trade-winds and of the wind system over all the  earth. But ocean meteorology is, I think, the most fascinating of all.  From Juan Fernandez to the Marquesas I experienced six changes of  these great palpitations of sea-winds and of the sea itself, the  effect of far-off gales. To know the laws that govern the winds, and  to know that you know them, will give you an easy mind on your voyage  round the world; otherwise you may tremble at the appearance of every  cloud. What is true of this in the trade-winds is much more so in the  variables, where changes run more to extremes.

Persons who are passionately fond of nature and the  arts feel the same sensations, when they travel through Switzerland  and Italy. Enabled to see but a small portion of the objects which  allure them, they are disturbed in their enjoyments by the  restraints they impose on themselves at every step.    On the morning of the 21st of June, we were on our way to the  summit of the volcano. M. Le Gros, whose attentions were unwearied,  M. Lalande, secretary to the French Consulate at Santa Cruz, and  the English gardener at Durasno, joined us on this excursion. The  day was not very fine, and the summit of the peak, which is  generally visible at Orotava from sunrise till ten o'clock, was  covered with thick clouds.    We were agreeably surprised by the contrast between the vegetation  of this part of Teneriffe, and that of the environs of Santa Cruz.  Under the influence of a cool and humid climate, the ground was  covered with beautiful verdure; while on the road from Santa Cruz  to Laguna the plants exhibited nothing but capsules emptied of  their seeds. Near the port of Santa Cruz, the strength of the  vegetation is an obstacle to geological research. We passed along  the base of two small hills, which rise in the form of bells.  Observations made at Vesuvius and in Auvergne lead us to think that  these hills owe their origin to lateral eruptions of the great  volcano. The hill called Montanita de la Villa seems indeed to have  emitted lavas; and according to the tradition of the Guanches, an  eruption took place in 1430. Colonel Franqui assured Borda, that  the place is still to be seen whence the melted matter issued; and  that the ashes which covered the ground adjacent, were not yet  fertilized. Whenever the rock appeared, we discovered basaltic  amygdaloid* (* Basaltartiger Mandelstein. Werner.) covered with  hardened clay,* (* Bimstein-Conglomerat. W.) which contains  rapilli, or fragments of pumice-stone. This last formation  resembles the tufas of Pausilippo, and the strata of puzzolana,  which I found in the valley of Quito, at the foot of the volcano of  Pichincha. The amygdaloid has very long pores, like the superior  strata of the lavas of Vesuvius, arising probably from the action  of an elastic fluid forcing its way through the matter in fusion.  Notwithstanding these analogies, I must here repeat, that in all  the low region of the peak of Teneriffe, on the side of Orotava, I  have met with no flow of lava, nor any current, the limits of which  are strongly marked. Torrents and inundations change the surface of  the globe, and when a great number of currents of lava meet and  spread over a plain, as I have seen at Vesuvius, in the Atrio dei  Cavalli, they seem to be confounded together, and wear the  appearance of real strata.    The villa de Orotava has a pleasant aspect at a distance, from the  great abundance of water which runs through the principal streets.  The spring of Agua Mansa, collected in two large reservoirs, turns  several mills, and is afterward discharged among the vineyards of  the adjacent hills. The climate is still more refreshing at the  villa than at the port of La Cruz, from the influence of the  breeze, which blows strong after ten in the morning. The water,  which has been dissolved in the air at a higher temperature,  frequently precipitates itself; and renders the climate very foggy.  The villa is nearly 160 toises (312 metres) above the level of the  sea, consequently 200 toises lower than the site on which Laguna is  built: it is observed also, that the same kind of plants flower a  month later in this latter place.    Orotava, the ancient Taoro of the Guanches, is situated on a very  steep declivity. The streets seem deserted; the houses are solidly  built, and of a gloomy appearance. We passed along a lofty  aqueduct, lined with a great number of fine ferns; and visited  several gardens, in which the fruit trees of the north of Europe  are mingled with orange trees, pomegranate, and date trees. We were  assured, that these last were as little productive here as on the  coast of Cumana. Although we had been made acquainted, from the  narratives of many travellers, with the dragon-tree of the garden  of M. Franqui, we were not the less struck with its enormous  magnitude. We were told, that the trunk of this tree, which is  mentioned in several very ancient documents as marking the  boundaries of a field, was as gigantic in the fifteenth century as  it is at the present time. Its height appeared to us to be about 50  or 60 feet; its circumference near the roots is 45 feet. We could  not measure higher, but Sir George Staunton found that, 10 feet  from the ground, the diameter of the trunk is still 12 English  feet; which corresponds perfectly with the statement of Borda, who  found its mean circumference 33 feet 8 inches, French measure. The  trunk is divided into a great number of branches, which rise in the  form of a candelabrum, and are terminated by tufts of leaves, like  the yucca which adorns the valley of Mexico. This division gives it  a very different appearance from that of the palm-tree.    Among organic creations, this tree is undoubtedly, together with  the Adansonia or baobab of Senegal, one of the oldest inhabitants  of our globe. The baobabs are of still greater dimensions than the  dragon-tree of Orotava. There are some which near the root measure  34 feet in diameter, though their total height is only from 50 to  60 feet. But we should observe, that the Adansonia, like the  ochroma, and all the plants of the family of bombax, grow much more  rapidly* than the dracaena, the vegetation of which is very slow.  (* It is the same with the plane-tree (Platanus occidentalis) which  M. Michaux measured at Marietta, on the banks of the Ohio, and  which, at twenty feet from the ground, was 15.7 feet in diameter.  --\"Voyage a l'Ouest des Monts Alleghany\" 1804 page 93. The yew,  chestnut, oak, plane-tree, deciduous cypress, bombax, mimosa,  caesalpina, hymenaea, and dracaena, appear to me to be the plants  which, in different climates, present specimens of the most  extraordinary growth. An oak, discovered together with some Gallic  helmets in 1809, in the turf pits of the department of the Somme,  near the village of Yseux, seven leagues from Abbeville, was about  the same size as the dragon-tree of Orotava. According to a memoir  by M. Traullee, the trunk of this oak was 14 feet in diameter.)  That in M. Franqui's garden still bears every year both flowers and  fruit. Its aspect forcibly exemplifies \"that eternal youth of  nature,\" which is an inexhaustible source of motion and of life.    The dracaena, which is seen only in cultivated spots in the Canary  Islands, at Madeira, and Porto Santo, presents a curious phenomenon  with respect to the migration of plants. It has never been found in  a wild state on the continent of Africa. The East Indies is its  real country. How has this tree been transplanted to Teneriffe,  where it is by no means common? Does its existence prove, that, at  some very distant period, the Guanches had connexions with other  nations originally from Asia?* (* The form of the dragon-tree is  exhibited in several species of the genus Dracaena, at the Cape of  Good Hope, in China, and in New Zealand. But in New Zealand it is  superseded by the form of the yucca; for the Dracaena borealis of  Aiton is a Convallaria, of which it has all the appearance. The  astringent juice, known in commerce by the name of dragon's blood,  is, according to the inquiries we made on the spot, the produce of  several American plants, which do not belong to the same genus and  of which some are lianas. At Laguna, toothpicks steeped in the  juice of the dragon-tree are made in the nunneries, and are much  extolled as highly useful for keeping the gums in a healthy state.)    On leaving Orotava, a narrow and stony pathway led us through a  beautiful forest of chestnut trees (el monte de Castanos), to a  site covered with brambles, some species of laurels, and  arborescent heaths. The trunks of the latter grow to an  extraordinary size; and the flowers with which they are loaded form  an agreeable contrast, during a great part of the year, to the  Hypericum canariense, which is very abundant at this height. We  stopped to take in our provision of water under a solitary  fir-tree. This station is known in the country by the name of Pino  del Dornajito. Its height, according to the barometrical  measurement of M. de Borda, is 522 toises; and it commands a  magnificent prospect of the sea, and the whole of the northern part  of the island. Near Pino del Dornajito, a little on the right of  the pathway, is a copious spring of water, into which we plunged  the thermometer, which fell to 15.4 degrees. At a hundred toises  distance from this spring is another equally limpid. If we admit  that these waters indicate nearly the mean heat of the place whence  they issue, we may fix the absolute elevation of the station at 520  toises, supposing the mean temperature of the coast to be 21  degrees, and allowing one degree for the decrement of caloric  corresponding under this zone to 93 toises. We should not be  surprised if this spring remained a little below the heat of the  air, since it probably takes its source in some more elevated part  of the peak, and possibly communicates with the small subterranean  glaciers of which we shall speak hereafter. The accordance just  observed between the barometrical and thermometrical measures is so  much more striking, because in mountainous countries, with steep  declivities, the springs generally indicate too great a decrement  of caloric, for they unite small currents of water, which filtrate  at different heights, and their temperature is consequently the  mean between the temperature of these currents. The spring of  Dornajito has considerable "]]]
