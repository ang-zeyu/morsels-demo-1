If your aerial is not very  high or long you can use loading coils, but to get anything like  efficient results with them you must have an aerial of large  capacitance and the only way to get this is to put up a high and long  one with two or more parallel wires spaced a goodly distance apart.    The Parts and How to Connect Them Up.--Get (1) _two honeycomb or other  coils_ of the greatest wave length you want to receive, for in order  to properly balance the aerial, or primary oscillation circuit, and  the closed, or secondary oscillation circuit, you have to tune them to  the same wave length; (2) two _.001 mfd. variable condensers_, though  fixed condensers will do, and (3) two small _single-throw double-pole  knife switches_ mounted on porcelain bases.    To use the loading coils all you have to do is to connect one of them  in the aerial above the primary coil of the loose coupler, or  variocoupler as shown in the wiring diagram in Fig. 57, then shunt one  of the condensers around it and connect one of the switches around  this; this switch enables you to cut in or out the loading coil at  will. Likewise connect the other loading coil in one side of the  closed, or secondary circuit between the variable .0007 mfd. condenser  and the secondary coil of the loose coupler or variocoupler as shown  in Fig. 53. The other connections are exactly the same as shown in  Figs. 44 and 45.    [Illustration: Fig. 57.--Wiring Diagram Showing Fixed Loading Coils  for Intermediate Wave Set.]    An Intermediate Wave Set With Variocoupler Inductance Coils.--By using  the coil wound on the rotor of the variocoupler as the tickler the  coupling between the detector tube circuits and the aerial wire system  increases as the set is tuned for greater wave lengths. This scheme  makes the control of the regenerative circuit far more stable than it  is where an ordinary loose coupled tuning coil is used.    When the variocoupler is adjusted for receiving very long waves the  rotor sets at right angles to the stator and, since when it is in this  position there is no mutual induction between them, the tickler coil  serves as a loading coil for the detector plate oscillation circuit.  Inductance coils for short wave lengths are usually wound in single  layers but _bank-wound coils_, as they are called are necessary to get  compactness where long wave lengths are to be received. By winding  inductance coils with two or more layers the highest inductance values  can be obtained with the least resistance. A wiring diagram of a  multipoint inductance coil is shown in Fig. 58. You can buy this  intermediate wave set assembled and ready to use or get the parts and  connect them up yourself.    [Illustration: Fig. 58.--Wiring Diagram for Intermediate Wave Receptor  with one Variocoupler and 12 section Bank-wound Inductance Coil.]    The Parts and How to Connect Them Up.--For this regenerative  intermediate wave set get: (1) one _12 section triple bank-wound  inductance coil_, (2) one _variometer_, and (3) all the other parts  shown in the diagram Fig. 58 except the variocoupler. First connect  the free end of the condenser in the aerial to one of the terminals of  the stator of the variocoupler; then connect the other terminal of the  stator with one of the ends of the bank-wound inductance coil and  connect the movable contact of this with the ground.    Next connect a wire to the aerial between the variable condenser and  the stator and connect this to one post of a .0005 microfarad fixed  condenser, then connect the other post of this with the grid of the  detector and shunt a 2 megohm grid leak around it. Connect a wire to  the ground wire between the bank-wound inductance coil and the ground  proper, i.e., the radiator or water pipe, connect the other end of  this to the + electrode of the A battery and connect this end also to  one of the terminals of the filament. This done connect the other  terminal of the filament to one post of the rheostat and the other  post of this to the - or negative side of the A battery.    To the + electrode of the A battery connect the - or zinc pole of the  B battery and connect the + or carbon pole of the latter with one post  of the fixed .001 microfarad condenser. This done connect one terminal  of the tickler coil which is on the rotor of the variometer to the  plate of the detector and the other terminal of the tickler to the  other post of the .001 condenser and around this shunt your  headphones. Or if you want to use one or more amplifying tubes connect  the circuit of the first one, see Fig. 45, to the posts on either side  of the fixed condenser instead of the headphones.    A Long Wave Receiving Set.--The vivid imagination of Jules Verne never  conceived anything so fascinating as the reception of messages without  wires sent out by stations half way round the world; and in these days  of high power cableless stations on the five continents you can  listen-in to the messages and hear what is being sent out by the  Lyons, Paris and other French stations, by Great Britain, Italy,  Germany and even far off Russia and Japan.    A long wave set for receiving these stations must be able to tune to  wave lengths up to 20,000 meters. Differing from the way in which the  regenerative action of the short wave sets described in the preceding  chapter is secured and which depends on a tickler coil and the  coupling action of the detector in this long wave set, [Footnote: All  of the short wave and intermediate wave receivers described, are  connected up according to the wiring diagram used by the A. H. Grebe  Company, Richmond Hill, Long Island, N. Y.] this action is obtained by  the use of a tickler coil in the plate circuit which is inductively  coupled to the grid circuit and this feeds back the necessary amount  of current. This is a very good way to connect up the circuits for the  reason that: (1) the wiring is simplified, and (2) it gives a single  variable adjustment for the entire range of wave lengths the receptor  is intended to cover.    The Parts and How to Connect Them Up.--The two chief features as far  as the parts are concerned of this long wave length receiving set are  (1) the _variable condensers_, and (2) the _tuning inductance coils_.  The variable condenser used in series with the aerial wire system has  26 plates and is equal to a capacitance of _.0008 mfd._ which is the  normal aerial capacitance. The condenser used in the secondary coil  circuit has 14 plates and this is equal to a capacitance of _.0004  mfd_.    There are a number of inductance coils and these are arranged so that  they can be connected in or cut out and combinations are thus formed  which give a high efficiency and yet allow them to be compactly  mounted. The inductance coils of the aerial wire system and those of  the secondary coil circuit are practically alike. For wave lengths up  to 2,200 meters _bank litz-wound coils_ are used and these are  wound up in 2, 4 and 6 banks in order to give the proper degree of  coupling and inductance values.    Where wave lengths of more than 2,200 meters are to be received  _coto-coils_ are used as these are the \"last word\" in inductance coil  design, and are especially adapted for medium as well as long wave  lengths. [Footnote: Can be had of the Coto Coil Co., Providence, R. I.]  These various coils are cut in and out by means of two five-point  switches which are provided with auxiliary levers and contactors for  _dead-ending_ the right amount of the coils. In cutting in coils for  increased wave lengths, that is from 10,000 to 20,000 meters, all of  the coils of the aerial are connected in series as well as all of the  coils of the secondary circuit. The connections for a long wave  receptor are shown in the wiring diagram in Fig. 59.

According to instructions, I presented myself early next morning at  the residence of Herr von Kinderlen-Waechter.  It was in the  Thiergartenstrasse.  Without delay I was shown into his Excellency's  room.  He was seated at his desk, and while we exchanged a few  perfunctory words I permitted myself a moment's brief conjecture.    Judging from appearances, you would never have taken this portly,  rubicund, iron-gray, bushy-browed gentleman for a statesman.  But a  statesman he was for all that, and the Emperor and Germany miss him  sorely.  I would have taken him for a Boer Dopper or an English  yeoman.  This suggestion was supported by his atrocious taste in fancy  waistcoats.  The one he had on still sticks in my memory.  It was a  lurid peach-blossom creation, spotted with green.  But once his  steel-gray, deerhound eyes looked you up and down you forgot all about  the fancy waistcoat and got right down to business.  I told his  Excellency I had come for his personal instructions.    Besides telling me to \"halt my maul\" (a German military expression  literally meaning to keep your mouth shut, but implying the need for  utmost secrecy) he gave me certain general instructions.  But from  them I could gain no idea of just what was going to happen.  I could  only guess.  How big was the gathering storm he never even hinted.    Remembering von Wedel's suggestion about the hunting party, I procured  some guns and reached the station in time to catch the 12.30 express  for Schlangenbad.    It was early in October when I went to the Kur Hotel and registered as  Herr Bamberger from Berlin.  If you ever go to Schlangenbad, look up  the register.  Schlangenbad is a mineral watering place in Prussia,  near the Black Forest, and within easy distance of our ultimate  meeting place, the hunting lodge that von Wedel had mentioned.    I was alone at the hotel for several days.  Then, traveling incognito,  the dignitaries be,,an to drift in.  First came the Austrian, General  Moritz Ritter von Auffenberg.  A distinguished, quiet, unassuming  gentleman, he is known to be high in the confidence of Francis Joseph.  I found the War Minister very fond of salmon fishing, and got quite  into his good graces by enthusiastic tales of fly fishing in New  Zealand.    Admiral von Tirpitz and General von Heeringen came next.  The Admiral  is typical of the German sailor, a big man, six feet, wide of  shoulder, blue-eyed, and full bearded.  His manner I found genial and  courteous.  His exact opposite was von Heeringen, thin, almost crooked  of body, stoop shouldered, unusually taciturn, and possessing  deep-sunken, smoldering black eyes.  He struck me as an animated mummy  of the Rameses dynasty--come to think of it, he much resembles Rameses  II.    The exact date of the meeting, as I recall it, was October 12, and the  place a shooting lodge, named Ehrenkrug.  On the morning of the  twelfth I hired a vehicle and, loading provisions, wine, and other  necessaries aboard, drove to the lodge, sixteen miles into the forest.    No farmhouse or other human habitation was within a radius of several  miles.  It was a large stone and brick building, somewhat similar to  your colonial style.  It had five or six guest rooms, a large general  meeting hall, and a morning room.  It being the property of the royal  family, I found two old pensioners of the Imperial Forest Service in  charge.  They had a good fire going in the grate, which was welcome,  for it was still a little damp and chilly, especially in this wet  mountain forest.    Patroling both ends of the road were a number of gendarmes.  They were  scattered through the woods, too, forming a cordon through which no  one could come.  Indeed, they had challenged me.  About three o'clock  in the afternoon the German and Austrian envoys came out from the  hotel, and at a quarter to four (I remember Waechter remarking  \"They're three-quarters of an hour late!\") the chug of a motor  announced the others, Lord Haldane and Winston Churchill.    I had never happened to meet Haldane before, and I found him the  English gentleman personified--polished and reserved.  Yet his  reserve, tempered by age, blended into a genial mellowness.  The usual  English arrogance had evidently been subdued by reason of his training  and cosmopolitan knowledge.  In speech and action he was a  Chesterfield, but in appearance he was not unlike a canon or a bishop,  a little ascetic looking, and rather bald.    Quite the other type of Anglo-Saxon, still boyish in looks,  high-strung and nervous, erratic in speech and action, just a bit  self-conscious, Winston Churchill was the youngest member of this  remarkable gathering.  I had met him during the Boer War, and as he  took off his motoring coat he looked at me closely.    \"I believe I've seen you before,\" he said.    \"I met the right honorable gentleman in the Bloemfontein Field  Hospital during the war.\"    \"Ah, yes,\" said Churchill, his face lighting up.    He had had his wound dressed there; his recognition showed his  remarkable memory.    After refreshments the envoys immediately adjourned to the big morning  room, and I was posted outside to see that no gendarme or forest  pensioner carne within earshot.  I was not present at the beginning of  the conference, but after an hour had passed I was summoned.  My first  impression as I opened the door was of an air of tenseness.  It was  obvious in the way Churchill was staring across the table at Haldane.  It was an ordinary large German oak dining-room table, and in the  middle were two big shaded lamps.  It was growing dusk, and after  lighting the lamps, I backed away to a corner of the room.  I had a  distinct impression of the features of the six men who were making  history round that table.  There were writing materials, stacks of  paper, and documents at every place.  Sheets and sheets of paper were  covered with their handwriting.  Only in front of von Heeringen were  the sheets blank, for he never makes a note of anything, carrying  everything in his marvelous memory.    Obviously what were the last words of a speech came from Moritz, the  Austrian, as I entered: \"And to make this all possible,\" he was  saving, \"we must break the Russian Federation in the Balkans.\"    From his place at the head of the table the iron-gray-haired  Kinderlen-Waechter rose slowly.  I noticed he wore another of those  atrocious vests.  Turning on his left he gazed at Churchill and  Tirpitz; his careful measuring eyes then met Moritz, an expectant,  slightly nervous figure at the other end of the table awaiting the  reply to the point he had raised.  And Waechter's eyes turned from him  to Heeringen, to Haldane; then he spoke.  I recall distinctly the  import of his remarks.    \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"the point raised by General Moritz must stand,  and, of course, it needs the sanction of our respective heads.  As  Lord Haldane has pointed out, it does complicate matters to some  extent.  The Balkans concern Austria most; to my way of thinking it is  quite within reason to accede this point.  [As I write I recall  vividly how grave they had all become.  They knew what this meant--war  in the Balkans.] On all main points,\" said Kinderlen-Waechter, \"we are  agreed.  As indicated by his Imperial Majesty, the primary reason of  our meeting is to come to a tacit understanding in regard to technical  details.  This we have done.  It is unfortunate, however, that this  possible phase, the Balkan point, has not been gone into before.  I  suggest that we adjourn, to inform our respective Governments of this  point.  If necessary, we will meet again on Wednesday.\"    This second meeting, by the way, was not necessary, all the  Governments represented tentatively agreeing with Austria.  The  treaty, however, was subject to signatures and if it was officially  closed, I cannot tell.    Apparently the conference was at an end.  But what had they  accomplished?  From the general tenor of their conversation it was  obvious that they all agreed.  But what were the terms of their  bargain?  Presently I was to know.    \"Bamberger,\" said Kinderlen-Waechter, addressing me by the name I had  taken, \"gather up any pieces of paper on the table and consign them to  the fire.\"    I replied: \"Yes sir.\"  Then turning to the others, he continued:    \"Gentlemen, select the memoranda you wish to keep.  The rest is going  to be destroyed immediately.\"    While they ran over their papers, saving necessary scraps, I stood  back from the table.  It was characteristic of the men that Winston  Churchill should have taken the most voluminous notes, while Heeringen  had not put down a line.  I then gathered up every scrap of paper left  on the table--blotters, little note pads, foolscap--used or unused.  Everything was to go into the fire.    I went about this slowly and deliberately, taking care to glance at  everything before I carried it over to the grate.  I wanted to make  sure that nothing of value was destroyed.  Here and there came a good  chance to read some of the contents.  Piece by piece from the  memoranda the different men had made, always being careful not to  confuse individual notes, thus learning one by one their train of  thought, the thing began to piece itself together for me.  There were  extensive notes on army and navy matters.  Churchill, for instance,  had carefully noted the full strength that Austria and Germany could  muster in case of war.  Kinderlen-Waechter had recorded the full  strength of England and Austria as given by Churchill and Moritz.  So  had Moritz taken down German and English statistics.  Obviously it was  a triangular alliance, each noting to what extent dependence could be  placed upon the other.  Then there were data on the French and Russian  armies and navies.  The significance of that was apparent.  What  puzzled me, hovrever,"]]]
