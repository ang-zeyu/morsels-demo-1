Dey had plenty of niggers an' dey was log cabins in de quarters jes' as  far as your eyes could see. Marsa Frank an' Miss Sarah was good to de  black folks, too. Dey son, young marsa Frank, fit in de big war. Atter  de war was over I stayed on de Lines' place 'twell atter I ma'ied, an'  Ol' Miss gin me my weddin' dress an' a long veil down to my foots.    \"When us was chillun in de quarters we did a mighty lot of playin'. Us  useta play 'Sail away Rauley' a whole lot. Us would hol' han's an' go  'roun' in a ring, gittin' faster an' faster an' dem what fell down was  outa de game.    \"My mammy wukked in de Big House, aspinnin' an' anussin' de white  chillun. All of dem called her 'mammy.' Ah 'members one thing jes' lack  it was yestiddy. Miss Sarah went to 'Mospolis (Demopolis) to visit wid  her sister, an' whilst she were gone de oberseer, what go by de name of  Allen, whupped my Mammy crost her back 'twell de blood runned out.    \"When Miss Sarah comed back an' foun' it out, she was de maddes white  lady I eber seed. She sont for de oberseer, an' she say: 'Allen, what  you mean by whupping Mammy? You know I don't allow you to tech my house  servants.' She jerk her dress down an' stan' dere lookin' like a sojer  wid her white shoulders shinin' lack a snow bank, an' she say: 'I  'druther see dem marks on my own shoulders dan to see 'em on Mammy's.  Dey wouldn't hurt me no wuss.' Den she say: 'Allen, teck your fambly an'  git offen my place. Don't you let sundown ketch you here. 'So he lef'.  He wasn't nothin' but white trash nohow.\"    \"Ma\" Eppes sat silent for a time as she recalled the vision of Miss  Sarah standing straight and regal in her dismissal of the overseer.  Finally she turned with an abrupt change of subject.    \"Honey, is you a Christian?\" she asked earnestly. \"I hopes you is, ca'se  you is too fine lookin' for to go to Hell. I b'longs to de Baptis'  Church, an' dey calls me Ma Eppes 'ca'se I's de mother of de church. I  loves to sing de gospel Hymns.\"    She began to sing in a high, cracked voice, her body swaying with the  rhythm. The song rose until her neighbors had gathered to form quite an  audience. With much moaning between every line, she sang:        \"I am a sojer of de Cross,        A follerer of de Lam'.      I'm not afeard to own His name,        Nor to 'fen' His cause.\"        (Chorus)        \"I wan' you to come,        I wan' you to come,      I wan' you to come        An' be saved.\"    She was still singing as I left her, the neighbors joining in the  choruses. Suppers would be late in the row of weatherbeaten cabins,  because the spirit of song was on the gathering.

He says:    \"My Marster was Mister Gholson frum Bullock county. He had lots uv  slaves 'cause he was a rich man. I was jes' a boy ten years ole an' he  was a squire dat tried cases, so he rode all over de country to dif'funt  places. I rode wid him to hole his horse. He wore a high top black hat  and had a buggy wid a top dat let back. When we went we was gone a long  time an' when night come he would fix it fer me to sleep wid some uv de  niggers in de quarters where we stopped. I sho' lacked to go 'bout wid  him.    \"My mother was de cook. She had rule over all the cookin'. She spinned  thread an' reeled it off too.    \"When de Yankees come through de country I seed 'em all runnin' so I  thought it was jedgment day an' I runned an' hid under de chimney an'  stayed dere 'tel night. Dey didn't tarry long, but dey drove de horses  right up on de piazza, and throwed ever' thing out de houses, eben  knocked down de smoke 'ouse doors. Dat's de trufe'.    \"One time I was taken to the slave market and I was screwed on the block  and Mr. Martin bought me and my Mamma. The man that was selling us would  holler, \"Who'll bid? Who'll bid?\" We was supposed to be spry and fidgety  so as to make the men want to buy us. My fust Marster was Wash Jones. He  wan't good to us. He would hit us wid his cane jes' as if it had been a  switch. Ben Jones didn't like the way Marse Wash treated us niggers. He  bought us for his son.    \"We didn't have no doctors much in dem days, but us had a horn us use  when we got sick. If us had the headache that horn would go right over  the spot and it wouldn't be no time 'fore the pain'd be gone. We'd use  that horn anytime we was ailing an' it'd sho' do the work. I used to  have the horn but I don't know jes' where it is now.\"          Heywood Ford          *Interview with Heywood Ford*      --_Susie R. O'Brien, Uniontown, Alabama_    _HEYWOOD FORD TELLS A STORY_    \"White folks,\" said Heywood Ford, \"I'se gonna tell you a story 'bout a  mean oberseer an' whut happened to him durin' de slabery days. It all  commenced when a nigger named Jake Williams got a whuppin' for stayin'  out atter de time on his pass done gib out. All de niggers on de place  hated de oberseer wuss dan pizen, 'caze he was so mean an' useta try to  think up things to whup us for.    \"One mornin' de slaves was lined up ready to eat dere breakfas' an' Jake  Williams was a pettin' his ole red-bone houn'. 'Bout dat time de  oberseer come up an' seed Jake a pettin' his houn' an' he say: 'Nigger  you ain't got time to be a-foolin' 'long dat dog. Now make him git.'  Jake tried to make de dog go home, but de dog didn't want to leave Jake.  Den de oberseer pick up a rock an' slam de dog in de back. De dog he den  went a-howlin' off.    \"Dat night Jake he come to my cabin an' he say to me: 'Heywood, I is  gonna run away to a free State. I ain't a-gonna put up wid dis treatment  no longer. I can't stand much mo'. I gibs him my han' an' I say: 'Jake,  I hopes you gits dere. Maybe I'll see you ag'in sometime.'    \"'Heywood,' he says, 'I wish you'd look atter my houn', Belle. Feed her  an' keep her de bes' you kin. She a mighty good possum an' coon dog. I  hates to part wid her, but I knows dat you is de bes' pusson I could  leave her wid.' An' wid dat Jake slip out de do' an' I seed him  a-walkin' toward de swamp down de long furrows of cawn.    \"It didn't take dat oberseer long to fin' out dat Jake done run away,  an', when he did, he got out de blood houn's an' started off atter him.  It warn't long afore Jake heered dem houn's a-howlin' in de distance.  Jake he was too tired to go any further. He circled 'roun' an' doubled  on his tracks so as to confuse de houn's an' den he clumb a tree.  T'warn't long afore he seed de light of de oberseer comin' th'ough de  woods and de dogs was a-gittin' closer an' closer. Finally dey smelled  de tree dat Jake was in an' dey started barkin' 'roun' it. De oberseer  lif' his lighted pine knot in de air so's he could see Jake. He say:  'Nigger, come on down fum dere. You done wasted 'nuff of our time.' But  Jake, he neber move nor make a sound an' all de time de dogs keppa  howlin' an' de oberseer keppa swearin'. 'Come on down,' he say ag'in;  'iffen you don't I'se comin' up an' knock you outen de tree wid a  stick.' Jake still he neber moved an' de oberseer den began to climb de  tree. When he got where he could almos' reach Jake he swung dat stick  an' it come down on Jake's leg an' hurt him tur'ble. Jake, he raised his  foot an' kicked de oberseer raght in de mouf, an' dat white man went a  tumblin' to de groun'. When he hit de earth dem houn's pounced on him.  Jake he den lowered hisself to de bottom limbs so's he could see what  had happened. He saw de dogs a-tearin' at de man an' he holla: 'Hol'  'im, Belle! Hol' 'im, gal!' De leader of dat pack of houn's, white  folks, warn't no blood houn'. She was a plain old red-bone possum an'  coon dog, an' de res' done jus' lak she done, tearin' at de oberseer's  th'oat. All de while, Jake he a-hollerin' f'um de tree fer dem dogs to  git 'im. 'Twarn't long afore dem dogs to' dat man all to pieces. He died  raght under dat maple tree dat he run Jake up. Jake he an' dat coon  houn' struck off through de woods. De res' of de pack come home.    \"I seed Jake atter us niggers was freed. Dat's how come I knowed all  'bout it. It musta been six years atter dey killed de oberseer. It was  in Kentucky dat I run across Jake. He was a-sittin' on some steps of a  nigger cabin. A houn' dog was a-sittin' at his side. I tells him how  glad I is to see him, an' den I look at de dog. 'Dat ain't Belle,' I  says. 'Naw,' Jake answers, 'Dis her puppy.' Den he tol' me de whole  story.

He  would pour water over it den.    \"Some of Marse Buchanan's boys went to war, and some of dem got killed.  Dey had patrollers den, and if dey caught you off de place dey would  have twelve men to whip you.    \"We never worked at night except sometimes when it rained and we had to  get de corn shucked or de fodder hauled to de barn. Sometimes we picked  cotton by de light of de moon. We worked on Saturday afternoons but not  on Sundays. On Christmas we had a good time and good things to eat. De  men would drink beer and whiskey. Beer was made from locusts and  persimmons, and everybody would drink some of it.    \"De slaves never learned to read and write. Dey never had any churches,  but dey had to go to church and so dey went to de white folks' church  and set in de back or de gallery. Niggers had lots of dancing and  frolics. Dey danced de 'flat-foot'. Dat was when a nigger would slam his  foot flat down on de floor. De wooden bottom shoes sho would make a loud  noise. At weddings everybody would eat and frolic.    \"We had our own leather made and tanned at home; den it was tacked to de  wood soles to make shoes.    \"When anybody got sick, de old folks made hot teas from herbs dat dey  got out of de woods. One was a bitter herb called 'rhu'. It was put in  whiskey and drunk to prevent sickness. Marse always give it to de nigger  children, and to de grown ups, too. Dey hung asafetida bags around de  necks of de kids to keep down sickness.    \"When freedom come, Marse said we was free, but he kept us till dat crop  was finished, and some of de niggers stayed on for several years and  worked for wages.    \"De yankees come through our section, and Marse hid his meat and things  in deep holes dat he dug in de cemetery. He built a fence around de  cemetery. De yankees took good horses and left poor ones. Dey made  niggers cook for dem all night. De Ku Klux wore white clothes and white  caps. Dey made out dey was ghosts from de cemetery, and dey would get a  man and carry him off, and we never would see him again. De Red Shirts  come in '76. I 'member my husband voted once or twice. He was a  Republican; but dey soon put a stop to dat.    \"I think Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson must have been all right; just  heard about them. Dey said dat Jeff Davis surrendered under a June apple  tree. Just heard about Booker Washington and dat is all I know. Reckon  he is doing good work.    \"I joined de church when I was quite young, because meningitis was in de  neighborhood killing so many folks and I got scared.    \"Atter de war de niggers started up hill; den went back. Since dat time  up to now, dey has been working most on farms. Some rent small farms and  some work as wage hands or share-croppers. Dem dat went to town have  worked as carpenters and other such work.    \"I can't 'member anything more, except dat marse had a still-house on  his place, and other farmers did, too. Dey made brandy and whiskey from  peaches, apples and grapes dat dey raised; den sold it to other farmers  in de neighborhood who didn't have as much as dey did.\"          Amie Lumpkin          *Interview with Amie Lumpkin, 88 years old*      *1411 Pine St. Columbia, S.C.*      --_Stiles M. Scruggs, Columbia, S.C._    \"I was born on de plantation of Master John Mobley, in Fairfield County,  South Carolina, in 1849. Both my parents was slaves on that plantation  at that time. Master Mobley had a big farm and he had many slaves and  chillun when I began to understand things there. My daddy worked in de  field, but my mammy worked in de big house, helpin' to cook.    \"There was pretty good order on de plantation, generally at de time in  1856, when I was 'bout seven years old. Most of de slaves go right along  doin' their chores, as expected of them, but a few was restless, and  they break de rules, by runnin' 'bout without askin', and always there  was one or two who tried to escape slavery by goin' far away to the  North.    \"I 'member seein' one big black man, who tried to steal a boat ride from  Charleston. He stole away one night from Master Mobley's place and got  to Charleston, befo' he was caught up with. He tell the overseer who  questioned him after he was brought back: 'Sho', I try to git away from  this sort of thing. I was goin' to Massachusetts, and hire out 'til I  git 'nough to carry me to my home in Africa.'    \"It was de rule when a trial was bein' held lak this, for all de bosses  and sometimes de missus to be there to listen and to ask the run'way  slave some questions. After this one talked, it was Missus Mobley  herself who said; 'Put yourself in this slave's shoes, and what would  you do? Just such as he has. The best way to treat such a slave is to be  so kind and patient with him, that he will forget his old home.'    \"He was led away and I never did hear if he was whipped. He lak a  Cherokee Indian, he never whimper if he should be whipped 'til de blood  stream from him; but I do know he never got away again. He was de first  one to pick up his hat and laugh loud, when President Lincoln set all  slaves free in January, 1863. He say: 'Now I go, thank de Lord, and he  strike right out, but he not git much beyond de barn, when he turn and  come back. He walked in de yard of de big house, and he see Missus  Mobley lookin' out at him. He take off his hat and bow low and say:    \"Missus, I so happy to be free, that I forgits myself but I not go 'til  you say so. I not leave you when you needs a hand, 'less de master and  all de white folks gits home to look after you.    \"De missus look down at her feet end she see de black man, so big and  strong, sheddin' tears. She say to him: 'You is a good nigger and you  has suffered much; make yourself at home, just as you have been doin'  and when you want to go far away, come to me and I'll see that you git  'nough money to pay your way to Boston and maybe to Africa.' And that is  what happen' a year or two later.    \"My daddy go 'way to de war 'bout this time, and my mammy and me stay in  our cabin alone. She cry and wonder where he be, if he is well, or he be  killed, and one day we hear he is dead. My mammy, too, pass in a short  time. I was sixteen when Sherman's army come through Fairfield County. I  see them ridin' by for hours, some of them laughin' and many of them has  big balls in their hands, which they throw against de house and it  explode and burn de house.    \"I have always 'spected that am just de way they set de houses when  Columbia was burned in a single night. Some of de houses in Fairfield  was burned, some in Winnsboro, and others in de country, but Columbia  was de only place that was wiped out. As de army pass, we all stand by  de side of de road and cry and ask them not to burn our white folks'  house, and they didn't.    \"I came to Columbia in 1868, and for a time I cooked in one or two of de  hotels, then running in Columbia. About 1878, I was employed as cook in  de home of de late W.A. Clark, and I stayed there, in de servant's  quarters, on de place 'til I became too feeble to continue.    \"It has been one of de big pleasures of my life that I has so many fine  white friends, and so far as I knows, de good will of all de black folks  as well. While workin' at Mr. Clark's home, which stood in a fine grove  of magnolias at the corner of Elmwood Avenue and Park Street I never  thought I should live to see it fade away. But you know it did, since de  big stone mansion was torn away and de Junior High School now stands in  that grove.    \"While there, I think it was about thirty years service, I saw many of  de leading white folks of de city and state, as guests there; they, at  least many of them, still befriend me. De remnants of de Clark family  treat me fine when they see me, and sometimes they drive by to see me.  Of course, I had a pretty nice little roll of money when I got too old  to work reg'larly but it has all been spent since. One day I's thinkin'  'bout it and I recalls de sayin' of my Missus Mobley. She say: 'Money  has wings and it soon fly away.'    \"For de last twelve years now, I has been de guest of Missus Ruth Neal,  a fine Christian woman and a teacher in de public schools. She always  treat me just as though I be her mother. My white friends have not  forgot me to date and they enable me to live, without too much aid from  my present benefactor. Her chillun, all in school now, call me 'Auntie.'  Lookin' over my life it seems to me, I has done de best I could to live  right and I have a hope that when de summons comes my Lord will say:  'Well done, Amie.'\"          Ballam Lyles          *Interview with \"Uncle\" Ballam Lyles (74)*      *Carlisle, S.C.*      --_Caldwell Sims, Union, S.C._    \"Likker puts de wrong ideas in people's haids.

It'll sho' ruin 'em.  And de niggers, it does dem de same way, 'cept dey don't have as far  down to come as de white folks does. And dat's de reason I ain't got no  use fer no likker.    \"When I was a lil shirt-tail boy, I recollects our soldiers gwine from  house to house wid packs on dere backs. Dey was de awfullest looking  white folks dat us had ever seed. Dat picture still stay right clear in  my mind, even if I is a old man wid everything a growing dim. Dey sot up  a camp at Marse's Bill Oxner's place--dat in Goshen Hill and ain't  nothing much left dar fer you to see now. Dem soldiers never had nothing  in dere packs but a few old rags and maybe a lil keepsake from de women  folks back home what dey loved. Dere hair was dat long and stringy dat  it was all matted "]]]
