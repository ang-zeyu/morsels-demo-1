Wars, though petty, were numerous and cruel. The  vanquished suffered death or slavery. Piracy, flourishing upon the  unprotected seas, ranked as an honorable occupation. It was no insult to  inquire of a seafaring stranger whether he was pirate or merchant. Murders  were frequent. The murderer had to dread, not a public trial and  punishment, but rather the personal vengeance of the kinsmen of his  victim. The Homeric Greeks, in fact, exhibited the usual defects and vices  of barbarous peoples.    HOMERIC GEOGRAPHY    The _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ disclose a considerable acquaintance with  peninsular Greece and the coasts of Asia Minor. Cyprus, Egypt, and Sicily  are also known in part. The poet imagines the earth as a sort of flat  shield, with Greece lying in the center. [9] The Mediterranean, \"The Sea,\"  as it is called by Homer, and its continuation, the Euxine, [10] divided  the world into two equal parts. Surrounding the earth was \"the great  strength of the Stream of Ocean,\" [11] a river, broad and deep, beyond  which lay the dark and misty realm of the mythical Cimmerians. The  underworld of Hades, home of the dead, was beneath the surface of the  earth.    [Illustration: Map, THE WORLD according to HOMER (900 B.C.)]    [Illustration: Map, GREEK CONQUESTS AND MIGRATIONS]      24. EARLY GREEK RELIGION    THE OLYMPIAN COUNCIL    We may learn from the Homeric poems what were the religious ideas held by  the early Greeks. The greater gods and goddesses were not numerous. Less  than a score everywhere received worship under the same names and in all  the temples. Twelve of the chief deities formed a select council, which  was supposed to meet on the top of snow-crowned Olympus. The Greeks,  however, did not agree as to what gods and goddesses should be included in  this august assemblage.    ATTRIBUTES OF THE DEITIES    Many of the Olympian deities appear to have been simply personifications  of natural phenomena. Zeus, \"father of gods and men,\" as Homer calls him,  was a heaven god, who gathered the clouds in storms and hurled the  lightning bolt. Apollo, a mighty god of light, who warded off darkness and  evil, became the ideal of manly beauty and the patron of music, poetry,  and healing. Dionysus was worshiped as the god of sprouting and budding  vegetation. Poseidon, brother of Zeus, ruled the sea. Hera, the wife of  Zeus, represented the female principle in nature. Hence she presided over  the life of women and especially over the sacred rites of marriage.  Athena, who sprang full-grown from the forehead of Zeus, embodied the idea  of wisdom and all womanly virtues. Aphrodite, who arose from the foam of  the sea, was the goddess of love and beauty. Demeter, the great earth-  mother, watched over seed-time and harvest. Each deity thus had a kingdom  and a function of its own.

It consists of two principal pieces  joined together across the folds of the drapery. Most art critics date  this work about 100 B.C. The strong serene figure of the goddess sets  forth the Greek ideal of female loveliness.]    CONCEPTIONS OF THE DEITIES    The Greeks made their gods and goddesses after themselves. The Olympian  divinities are really magnified men and women, subject to all human  passions and appetites, but possessed of more than human power and endowed  with immortality. They enjoy the banquet, where they feast on nectar and  ambrosia; they take part in the struggles of the battle field; they marry  and are given in marriage. The gods, morally, were no better than their  worshipers. They might be represented as deceitful, dissolute, and cruel,  but they could also be regarded as upholders of truth and virtue. Even  Homer could say, \"Verily the blessed gods love not evil deeds, but they  reverence justice and the righteous acts of men.\" [12]    [Illustration: THE FRANÃ‡OIS VASE (Archaeological Museum, Florence)  Found in an Etruscan grave in 1844 A.D.

The after-life  in Hades was believed to be a shadowy, joyless copy of the earthly  existence. In Hades the shade of great Achilles exclaims sorrowfully,  \"Nay, speak not comfortably to me of death. Rather would I live on earth  as the hireling of another, even with a landless man who had no great  livelihood, than bear sway among all the dead.\" [13] It was not until  several centuries after Homer that happier notions of the future life were  taught, or at least suggested, in the Eleusinian mysteries. [14]      25. RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS: ORACLES AND GAMES    ORACLE OF APOLLO AT DELPHI    The Greeks believed that communications from the gods were received from  certain inspired persons at places called oracles. The oracle of Apollo at  Delphi in Phocis enjoyed the utmost veneration. It lay within a deep cave  on the rocky side of Mount Parnassus. Out of a chasm rose a volcanic vapor  which had a certain intoxicating power. The Pythia, or prophetess of  Apollo, sat on a tripod over the steaming cleft and inhaled the gas. The  words she uttered in delirium were supposed to come from the god. They  were taken down by the attendant priests, written out in verse, and  delivered to the suppliants.    INQUIRIES AT THE ORACLE    The fame of Apollo as the patron of inspiration and prophecy spread  throughout Greece and penetrated to foreign lands. Every year thousands of  visitors made their way to Apollo's shrine. Sick men prayed for health,  childless men prayed for offspring. Statesmen wished to learn the fate of  their political schemes; ambassadors sent by kings and cities sought  advice as to weighty matters of peace and war. Above all, colonists came  to Delphi in order to obtain directions as to the best country in which to  settle. Some of the noblest cities of the Greek world, Cyrene and  Byzantium, for example, [15] had their sites fixed by Apollo's guidance.    [Illustration: CONSULTING THE ORACLE AT DELPHI]    CHARACTER OF THE RESPONSES    The priests who managed the oracle and its responses were usually able to  give good advice to their inquirers, because news of every sort streamed  into Delphi. When the priests were doubtful what answer to give, the  prophecy of the god was sometimes expressed in such ambiguous fashion  that, whatever the outcome, neither Apollo nor his servants could be  charged with deceit. For instance, when Croesus, the Lydian king, was  about to attack Cyrus, he learned from the oracle that \"if he warred with  the Persians he would overthrow a mighty empire\" [16]--but the mighty  empire proved to be his own. [17]    THE OLYMPIAN GAMES    Athletic games were held in different parts of Greece from a remote  period. The most famous games were those in honor of Zeus at Olympia in  Elis. They took place every fourth year, in midsummer. [18] A sacred truce  was proclaimed for an entire month, in order that the thousands of  spectators from every part of Greece might arrive and depart in safety. No  one not of Greek blood and no one convicted of crime or of the sin of  impiety might participate in the contests. The candidates had also to  prove that they were qualified for the severe tests by a long and hard  training. Once accepted as competitors, they could not withdraw. The man  who shrank back when the hour of trial arrived was considered a coward and  was punished with a heavy fine.    THE CONTESTS    The games occupied five days, beginning with the contests in running.  There was a short-distance dash through the length of the stadium, a  quarter-mile race, and also a longer race, probably for two or three  miles. Then followed a contest consisting of five events: the long jump,  hurling the discus, throwing the javelin, running, and wrestling. It is  not known how victory in these five events taken together was decided. In  the long jump, weights like dumb-bells were held in the hands, the swing  of the weights being used to assist the spring. The discus, which weighed  about twelve pounds, was sometimes hurled more than one hundred feet. The  javelin was thrown either by the hand alone or with the help of a thong  wound about the shaft and held in the fingers. In wrestling, three falls  were necessary for a victory. The contestants were free to get their grip  as best they could. Other contests included boxing, horse races, and  chariot races. Women were apparently excluded from the games, yet they  were allowed to enter horses for the races and to set up statues in honor  of the victors.

O rise up, I was only trying thee. I know all thy purpose, as  also those of the son of Dharma (Yudhisthira). But, O best of the  Bharata race, as long as there is a descendant of king Nila's line, so  long should this town be protected by me. I will, however O son of  Pandu, gratify the desires of thy heart.' And at these words of Agni, O  bull of the Bharata race, the son of Madri rose up with a cheerful  heart, and joining his hands and bending his head worshipped that god  of fire, sanctifier of all beings. And at last, after Agni had  disappeared, king Nila came there, and at the command of that deity,  worshipped with due rites Sahadeva, that tiger among men--that master  of battle. And Sahadeva accepted that worship and made him pay tribute.  And having brought king Nila under his sway thus, the victorious son of  Madri then went further towards the south. The long-armed hero then  brought the king of Tripura of immeasurable energy under his sway. And  next turning his forces against the Paurava kingdom, he vanquished and  reduced to subjection the monarch thereof. And the prince, after this,  with great efforts brought Akriti, the king of Saurashtra and preceptor  of the Kausikas under his sway. The virtuous prince, while staying in  the kingdom of Saurashtra sent an ambassador unto king Rukmin of  Bhishmaka within the territories of Bhojakata, who, rich in possessions  and intelligence, was the friend of Indra himself. And the monarch  along with his son, remembering their relationship with Krishna,  cheerfully accepted, O king, the sway of the son of Pandu. And the  master of battle then, having exacted jewels and wealth from king  Rukmin, marched further to the south. And, endued with great energy and  great strength, the hero then reduced to subjection, Surparaka and  Talakata, and the Dandakas also. The Kuru warrior then vanquished and  brought under his subjection numberless kings of the Mlechchha tribe  living on the sea coast, and the Nishadas and the cannibals and even  the Karnapravarnas, and those tribes also called the Kalamukhas who  were a cross between human beings and Rakshasas, and the whole of the  Cole mountains, and also Surabhipatna, and the island called the Copper  island, and the mountain called Ramaka. The high-souled warrior, having  brought under subjection king Timingila, conquered a wild tribe known  by the name of the Kerakas who were men with one leg. The son of Pandu  also conquered the town of Sanjayanti and the country of the Pashandas  and the Karahatakas by means of his messengers alone, and made all of  them pay tributes to him. The hero brought under his subjection and  exacted tributes from the Paundrayas and the Dravidas along with the  Udrakeralas and the Andhras and the Talavanas, the Kalingas and the  Ushtrakarnikas, and also the delightful city of Atavi and that of the  Yavanas. And, O king of kings, that slayer of all foes, the virtuous  and intelligent son of Madri having arrived at the sea-shore, then  despatched with great assurance messengers unto the illustrious  Vibhishana, the grandson of Pulastya. And the monarch willingly  accepted the sway of the son of Pandu, for that intelligent and exalted  king regarded it all as the act of Time. And he sent unto the son of  Pandu diverse kinds of jewels and gems, and sandal and also wood, and  many celestial ornaments, and much costly apparel, and many valuable  pearls. And the intelligent Sahadeva, accepting them all, returned to  his own kingdom.    \"Thus it was, O king, that slayer of all foes, having vanquished by  conciliation and war numerous kings and having also made them pay  tribute, came back to his own city. The bull of the Bharata race,  having presented the whole of that wealth unto king Yudhisthira the  just regarded himself, O Janamejaya, as crowned with success and  continued to live happily.\"      SECTION XXXI    Vaisampayana said,--\"I shall now recite to you the deeds and triumphs  of Nakula, and how that exalted one conquered the direction that had  once been subjugated by Vasudeva. The intelligent Nakula, surrounded by  a large host, set out from Khandavaprastha for the west, making this  earth tremble with the shouts and the leonine roars of the warriors and  the deep rattle of chariot wheels. And the hero first assailed the  mountainous country called Rohitaka that was dear unto (the celestial  generalissimo) Kartikeya and which was delightful and prosperous and  full of kine and every kind of wealth and produce. And the encounter  the son of Pandu had with the Mattamyurakas of that country was fierce.  And the illustrious Nakula after this, subjugated the whole of the  desert country and the region known as Sairishaka full of plenty, as  also that other one called Mahetta. And the hero had a fierce encounter  with the royal sage Akrosa. And the son of Pandu left that part of the  country having subjugated the Dasarnas, the Sivis, the Trigartas, the  Amvashtas, the Malavas, the five tribes of the Karnatas, and those  twice born classes that were called the Madhyamakeyas and Vattadhanas.  And making circuitous journey that bull among men then conquered the  (Mlechcha) tribes called the Utsava-sanketas. And the illustrious hero  soon brought under subjection the mighty Gramaniya that dwelt on the  shore of the sea, and the Sudras and the Abhiras that dwelt on the  banks of the Saraswati, and all those tribes that lived upon fisheries,  and those also that dwelt on the mountains, and the whole of the  country called after the five rivers, and the mountains called Amara,  and the country called Uttarayotisha and the city of Divyakutta and the  tribe called Dwarapala. And the son of Pandu, by sheer force, reduced  to subjection the Ramathas, the Harahunas, and various kings of the  west. And while staying there Nakula sent, O Bharata, messengers unto  Vasudeva. And Vasudeva with all the Yadavas accepted his sway. And the  mighty hero, proceeding thence to Sakala, the city of the Madras, made  his uncle Salya accept from affection the sway of the Pandavas. And, O  monarch, the illustrious prince deserving the hospitality and  entertainment at his uncle's hands, was well entertained by his uncle.  And skilled in war, the prince, taking from Salya a large quantity of  jewels and gems, left his kingdom. And the son of Pandu then reduced to  subjection the fierce Mlechchas residing on the sea coast, as also the  wild tribes of the Palhavas, the Kiratas, the Yavanas, and the Sakas.  And having subjugated various monarchs, and making all of them pay  tributes, Nakula that foremost of the Kurus, full of resources,  retraced his way towards his own city. And, O king, so great was the  treasure which Nakula brought that ten thousand camels could carry it  with difficulty on their backs. And arriving at Indraprastha, the  heroic and fortunate son of Madri presented the whole of that wealth  unto Yudhishthira.    \"Thus, O king, did Nakula subjugate the countries that lay to the  west--the direction that is presided over by the god Varuna, and that  had once before been subjugated by Vasudeva himself!\"      SECTION XXXII    (Rajasuyika Parva)    Vaisampayana said,--\"in consequence of the protection afforded by  Yudhisthira the just, and of the truth which he ever cherished in his  behaviour, as also of the check under which he kept all foes, the  subjects of that virtuous monarch were all engaged in their respective  avocations. And by reason of the equitable taxation and the virtuous  rule of the monarch, clouds in his kingdom poured as much rain as the  people desired, and the cities and the town became highly prosperous.  Indeed as a consequence of the monarch's acts every affair of the  kingdom, especially cattle breeding, agriculture and trade prospered  highly. O king, during those days even robbers and cheats never spoke  lies amongst themselves, nor they that were the favourites of the  monarch. There were no droughts and floods and plagues and fires and  premature deaths in those days of Yudhishthira devoted to virtue. And  it was only for doing agreeable services, or for worshipping, or for  offering tributes that would not impoverish, that other kings used to  approach Yudhisthira (and not for hostility or battle.) The large  treasure room of the king became so much filled with hoards of wealth  virtuously obtained that it could not be emptied even in a hundred  years. And the son of Kunti, ascertaining the state of his treasury and  the extent of his possessions, fixed his heart upon the celebration of  a sacrifice. His friends and officers, each separately and all  together, approaching him said,--'The time hath come, O exalted one,  for thy sacrifice. Let arrangements, therefore, be made without loss of  time.' While they were thus talking, Hari (Krishna), that omniscient  and ancient one, that soul of the Vedas, that invincible one as  described by those that have knowledge, that foremost of all lasting  existences in the universe, that origin of all things, as also that in  which all things come to be dissolved, that lord of the past, the  future, and the present Kesava--the slayer of Kesi, and the bulwark of  all Vrishnis and the dispeller of all fear in times of distress and the  smiter of all foes, having appointed Vasudeva to the command of the  (Yadava) army, and bringing with him for the king Yudhishthira just a  large mass of treasure; entered that excellent city of cities.  Khandava, himself surrounded by a mighty host and filling the  atmosphere with the rattle of his chariot-wheels. And Madhava, that  tiger among men enhancing that limitless mass of wealth the Pandavas  had by that inexhaustible ocean of gems he had brought, enhanced the  sorrows of the enemies of the Pandavas. The capital of the Bharata was  gladdened by Krishna's presence just as a dark region is rendered  joyful by the sun or a region of "]]]
