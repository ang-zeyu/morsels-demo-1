A  casual remark, a reported saying, or a confused recollection of some  obscure person, of whose character we have no knowledge, nor any  means of testing it, find their way into some one or other of the  hundred anti-Mormon books published, and then are published by such  controversialists as Mr. Schroeder. Citations are made of them in  marginal notes, and in time they come to be regarded, by the ordinary  reader, as of equal authority with any other witness; and thus the  unworthy, unreliable and, in some cases, a positively vicious and false  witness is given equal--and sometimes even more than equal--credence  with witnesses of unimpeachable probity, and high character, and who  have back of their testimony perhaps a life time of toil, suffering,  sacrifice, and sometimes martyrdom.    Of this class of witnesses let me here add one further remark. I know  that Arch-deacon Paley and his \"View of the Evidences of Christianity\"  are scoffed at by a certain school of latter-day critics, as being  somewhat out of date and insipid; but there is one statement he makes  that I cannot help but believe has great force in it. He holds in his  argument that because the early Christians in support of the Christian  miracles of which they were eye witnesses, and which so called miracles  could not be resolved into delusion or mistake, passed their lives in  labors, dangers, and sufferings, voluntarily undertaken, in attestation  of the accounts which they delivered,--therefore, they are worthy of  credence. To illustrate the point forcefully, he says:        \"If the reformers in the time of Wickliffe, or of Luther; or those      of England, in the time of Henry the Eighth, or of Queen Mary;      or the founders of our religious sects since, such as were Mr.      Whitfield and Mr. Wesley in our own times; had undergone the life      of toil and exertion, of danger and suffering, which we know that      many of them did undergo, for a miraculous story; that is to say,      if they had founded their public ministry upon the allegation of      miracles wrought within their own knowledge, and upon narratives      which could not be resolved into delusion or mistake; and if it      had appeared, that their conduct really had its origin in these      accounts, _I should have believed them.\"_ [12]    [Footnote 12: Paley's \"Evidences,\" proposition II, chap. I.]    I mention this matter here for two reasons; first because many of those  witnesses who accepted the Book of Mormon as true, are of the class of  witnesses here spoken of by Dr. Paley. They were men who voluntarily  passed their lives in labors, dangers, and sufferings, voluntarily  undertaken, in attestation of the accounts they delivered to the world  of the Book of Mormon's origin; and second, because having conceded  that men should cautiously receive the testimony to the so-called  miraculous, I desire to say that when the events to which the testimony  relates are of such character that they may not be resolved into  delusion or mistake, and the testimony is backed up by a life of toil,  danger and suffering, not only voluntarily undertaken but persisted  in--then, I say, their testimony is such that it commands respect and  acceptance; and at the very lowest valuation possible to be put upon  it, should out-rank in credibility whole hecatombs of such witnesses to  the contrary as are quoted by Mr. Schroeder--witnesses imbued, in many  cases, with personal hatred of Joseph Smith and the Mormon system, and  all influenced by sectarian zeal to uphold the orthodox view of such  Christianity as existed at the time and place in which they lived.    But returning now to the point at which the foregoing digression  began, let me say it is the promiscuous mingling and equalizing of  witnesses; and the failure to take into account the unreliability of  witnesses of the orthodox party when resisting and seeking to overthrow  what they regard as an innovation upon their most cherished ideas  and institutions, that I charge against Mr. Schroeder's treatment of  the origin of the Book of Mormon. The witnesses must be weighed as  well as counted in this controversy; and the liability recognized of  the anti-Mormon witnesses, in the supposed interests of orthodoxy,  resorting to the invention and promulgation of falsehood.    CONFLICTING THEORIES OF ORIGIN.    It must not be supposed by the reader of Mr. Schroeder's articles that  his theory of the origin of the Book of Mormon is the only anti-Mormon  theory of its origin advanced. Of course Mr. Schroeder does not claim  that it is, but points out quite the contrary in his first article. Why  the matter is referred to in these preliminary remarks, is because I  want to assure my readers that we \"Mormons\" get considerable amusement  out of the conflicting theories advanced to account for the origin  of our Book of Mormon. The necessity for a counter-theory for the  origin of the book, other than that advanced by Joseph Smith, was  early recognized. Christendom felt that Joseph Smith's story of the  book's origin must be overthrown, else what would come of this new  revelation, this new dispensation of God's work? Joseph Smith's account  of the origin of the book was a direct challenge to the teachings of  modern Christendom that revelation had ceased; that the awful voice  of prophecy would no more be heard; that the volume of scripture was  completed and forever closed, and that the Bible was the only volume of  scripture. Hence Christendom must find some other origin for this book  than that given by Joseph Smith.    The first to respond to this immediately \"felt want\" of Christendom was  Alexander Campbell, founder of the sect of the Disciples. He assigned  the book's origin to Joseph Smith, point blank, and charged ignorance  and conscious fraud upon its author. [13]    [Footnote 13: Campbell's critique on the Book of Mormon, appeared  in the _Millennial Harbinger,_ Vol. II, 1831, under the title  \"Mormonites.\" The criticism is exhaustive and bitter. It is, in fact,  a fine example of the bitterness of religious controversialists, in  defense of orthodox views.]    Next came the \"Spaulding Theory\" of origin, which Campbell accepted in  place of his own, and of which more later. Then came Miss Dougall's  theory of the prophet's self-delusion, \"by the automatic freaks of a  vigorous but undisciplined brain, and yielding to these, he became  confirmed in the hysterical temperament which always adds to delusion  self-deception, and to self-deception half-conscious fraud.\" [14] Next  came Mr. I Woodbridge Riley's theory (1902) of pure hallucination  honestly mistaken for inspired visions \"with partly conscious and  partly unconscious hypnotic powers over others.\"    Mr. Schroeder, however, will have none of these theories, but turns  back to the theory of the Spaulding manuscript origin. To him \"the  conclusions\" of Mr. Riley, because so many material considerations were  overlooked by that author, are very unsatisfactory, though admittedly  Mr. Riley's effort is the best along this line. [15] On his part,  Mr. Riley, speaking of previous theories, especially including the  Spaulding theory, says:    [Footnote 15: See Mr. Schroeder's note, 2.]        \"In spite of a continuous stream of conjectural literature, it is      as yet impossible to pick out any special document as an original      source of the Book of Mormon. In particular the commonly accepted      Spaulding theory is insoluble from external evidence and disproved      by internal evidence. Joseph Smith's record of the Indians 'is a      product indigenous to the New York wilderness,' and the authentic      work of its author and proprietor. Outwardly, it reflects the local      color of Palmyra and Manchester, inwardly, its complex of thought      is a replica of Smith's muddled brain. This monument of misplaced      energy was possible to the impressionable youth constituted and      circumstanced as he was.\" [16]    [Footnote 16: \"The Founder of Mormonism,\" 1902. This is a psychological  study of Joseph Smith, the Prophet. \"The aim of this work is to examine  Joseph Smith's character and achievements from the standpoint of recent  psychology. Sectarians and phrenologists, spiritualists and mesmerists  have variously interpreted his more or less abnormal performance--it  remains for the psychologist to have a try at them.\" The quotation  of the text is from the Preface. A review of Mr. Riley's book by the  present writer is found in \"Defense of the Faith and the Saints,\" Vol.  I, pp. 41-55.]    Mr. Riley's phrase \"conjectural literature\" is good. It admirably  describes the Spaulding theory literature at which it is particularly  aimed. That theory being \"insoluble from external evidence,\" is also  good; but \"disproved by internal evidence,\" is better. I shall not  forget that either, later on. But if these variant theorizers can't  convert each other, how can they hope to convert us Mormons? \"When  rogues fall out, honest men\"--but there, the proverb is somewhat trite  and I do not wish to be offensive. But let the merry disagreement of  anti-Mormon theorizers go on! Meanwhile new translations of the Book of  Mormon multiply, new editions are struck off, and more people are made  acquainted with its contents; the Church to which it may be said to  have given existence, enlarges her borders and strengthens her stakes.  She is gaining a victory over her traducers, and winning her place in  the world's history and in the world's religious thought.    MR. SCHROEDER'S STATEMENT OF HIS CASE.    These preliminary remarks ended, I proceed now with the consideration  of Mr. Schroeder's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/529"],[0,"Knights of Art: Stories of the Italian Painters (#20)"],[1,"nothing about what they were talking! But the critic  was satisfied, and did not notice the smile.    It would fill a book to tell of all the work which Michelangelo did;  but although he began so much, a great deal of it was left unfinished.  If he had lived in quieter times, his work would have been more  complete; but one after another his patrons died, or changed their  minds, and set him to work at something else before he had finished  what he was doing.    The great tomb which Pope Julius had ordered him to make was never  finished, although Michelangelo drew out all the designs for it, and  for forty years was constantly trying to complete it. The Pope began to  think it was an evil omen to build his own tomb, so he made up his mind  that Michelangelo should instead set to work to fresco the ceiling of  the Sistine Chapel. In vain did the great sculptor repeat that he knew  but little of the art of painting.    'Didst thou not learn to mix colours in the studio of Master  Ghirlandaio?' said Julius. 'Thou hast but to remember the lessons he  taught thee. And, besides, I have heard of a great drawing of a  battle-scene which thou didst make for the Florentines, and have seen  many drawings of thine, one especially: a terrible head of a furious  old man, shrieking in his rage, such as no other hand than thine could  have drawn. Is there aught that thou canst not do if thou hast but the  will?'    And the Pope was right; for as soon as Michelangelo really made up his  mind to do the work, all difficulties seemed to vanish.    It was no easy task he had undertaken. To stand upright and cover vast  walls with painting is difficult enough, but Michelangelo was obliged  to lie flat upon a scaffolding and paint the ceiling above him. Even to  look up at that ceiling for ten minutes makes the head and neck ache  with pain, and we wonder how such a piece of work could ever have been  done.    No help would the master accept, and he had no pupils. Alone he worked,  and he could not bear to have any one near him looking on. In silence  and solitude he lay there painting those marvellous frescoes of the  story of the Creation to the time of Noah. Only Pope Julius himself  dared to disturb the master, and he alone climbed the scaffolding and  watched the work.    'When wilt thou have finished?' was his constant cry. 'I long to show  thy work to the world.'    'Patience, patience,' said Michelangelo. 'Nothing is ready yet.'    'But when wilt thou make an end?' asked the impatient old man.    'When I can,' answered the painter.    Then the Pope lost his temper, for he was not accustomed to be answered  like this.    'Dost thou want to be thrown head first from the scaffold?' he asked  angrily. 'I tell thee that will happen if the work is not finished at  once.'    So, incomplete as they were, Michelangelo was obliged to uncover the  frescoes that all Rome might see them. It was many years before the  ceiling was finished or the final fresco of the Last Judgment painted  upon the end wall.    Michelangelo lived to be a very old man, and his life was lonely and  solitary to the end. The one woman he loved, Vittoria Colonna, had  died, and with her death all brightness for him had faded. Although he  worked so much in Rome, it was always Florence that he loved. There it  was that he began the statues for the Chapel of the Medici, and there,  too, he helped to build the defences of San Miniato when the Medici  family made war upon the City of Flowers.    So when the great man died in Rome it seemed but fit that his body  should be carried back to his beloved Florence. There it now rests in  the Church of Santa Croce, while his giant works, his great and  terrible thoughts breathed out into marble or flashed upon the walls of  the Sistine Chapel, live on for ever, filling the minds of men with a  great awe and wonder as they gaze upon them.        ANDREA DEL SARTO    Nowhere in Florence could a more honest man or a better worker be found  than Agnolo the tailor. True, there were once evil tales whispered  about him when he first opened his shop in the little street. It was  said that he was no Italian, but a foreigner who had been obliged to  flee from his own land because of a quarrel he had had with one of his  customers. People shook their heads and talked mysteriously of how the  tailor's scissors had been used as a deadly weapon in the fight. But  ere long these stories died away, and the tailor, with his wife  Constanza, lived a happy, busy life, and brought up their six children  carefully and well.    Now out of those six children five were just the ordinary commonplace  little ones such as one would expect to meet in a tailor's household,  but the sixth was like the ugly duckling in the fairy tale--a little,  strange bird, unlike all the rest, who learned to swim far away and  soon left the old commonplace home behind him.    The boy's name was Andrea. He was such a quick, sharp little boy that  he was sent very early to school, and had learned to read and write  before he was seven years old. As that was considered quite enough  education, his father then took him away from school and put him to  work with a goldsmith.    It is early days to begin work at seven years old, but Andrea thought  it was quite as good as play. He was always perfectly happy if he could  have a pencil and paper, and his drawings and designs were really so  wonderfully good that his master grew to be quite proud of the child  and showed the work to all his customers.    Next door to the goldsmith's shop there lived an old artist called  Barile, who began to take a great interest in little Andrea. Barile was  not a great painter, but still there was much that he could teach the  boy, and he was anxious to have him as a pupil. So it was arranged that  Andrea should enter the studio and learn to be an artist instead of a  goldsmith.    For three years the boy worked steadily with his new master, but by  that time Barile saw that better teaching was needed than he could  give. So after much thought the old man went to the great Florentine  artist Piero di Cosimo, and asked him if he would agree to receive  Andrea as his pupil. 'You will find the boy no trouble,' he urged. 'He  has wonderful talent, and already he has learnt to mix his colours so  marvellously that to my mind there is no artist in Florence who knows  more about colour than little Andrea' Cosimo shook his head in  unbelief. The boy was but a child, and this praise seemed absurd.  However, the drawings were certainly extraordinary, and he was glad to  receive so clever a pupil.    But little by little, as Cosimo watched the boy at work, his unbelief  vanished and his wonder grew, until he was as fond and proud of his  pupil as the old master had been. 'He handles his colours as if he had  had fifty years of experience,' he would say proudly, as he showed off  the boy's work to some new patron.    And truly the knowledge of drawing and colouring seemed to come to the  boy without any effort. Not that he was idle or trusted to chance. He  was never tired of work, and his greatest joy on holidays was to go of  and study the drawings of the great Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci.  Often he would spend the whole day copying these drawings with the  greatest care, never tired of learning more and more.    As Andrea grew older, all Florence began to take note of the young  painter--'Andrea del Sarto,' as he was called, or 'the tailor's  Andrew,' for sarto is the Italian word for tailor.    What a splendid new star this was rising in the heaven of Art! Who  could tell how bright it would shine ere long? Perhaps the tailor's son  would yet eclipse the magic name of Raphael. His colour was perfect,  his drawing absolutely correct. They called him in their admiration  'the faultless painter.' But had he, indeed, the artist soul? That was  the question. For, perfect as his pictures were, they still lacked  something. Perhaps time would teach him to supply that want.    Meanwhile there was plenty of work for the young artist, and when he  set up his own studio with another young painter, he was at once  invited to fresco the walls of the cloister of the Scalzo, or  bare-footed friars.    This was the happiest time of all Andrea's life. The two friends worked  happily together, and spent many a merry day with their companions.  Every day Andrea learned to add more softness and delicacy to his  colouring until his pictures seemed verily to glow with life. Every day  he dreamed fresh dreams of the fame and honour that awaited him. And  when work was over, the two young painters would go off to meet their  friends and make merry over their supper as they told all the latest  jokes and wittiest stories, and forgot for a while the serious art of  painting pictures.    There were twelve of these young men who met together, and each of them  was bound to bring some particular dish for the general supper. Every  one tried to think of something especially nice and uncommon, but no  one managed such surprising delicacies as Andrea. There was one special  dish which no one ever forgot. It was in the shape of a temple, with  its pillars made of sausages. The pavement was formed of little squares  of different coloured jelly, the tops of the pillars were cheese, and  the roof was of sugar, with a frieze of sweets running round it. Inside  the temple there was a choir of roast birds with their mouths wide  open, and the priests were two fat pigeons. It was the most splendid  supper-dish that ever was seen.    Every one was fond of the clever young painter. He was so kind and  courteous to all, and so simple-hearted that it was impossible for the  others to feel jealous or to grudge him the fame and praise that was  showered upon him more and more as each fresh picture was finished.    Then just when all gave promise of sunshine and happiness, a little  cloud rose in his blue sky, which grew and grew "]]]
