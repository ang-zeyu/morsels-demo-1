But for  the protection which he enjoys, and which enables him to wax rich, he  only contributes to the expenses of Government his hut-tax of ten  shillings. An increase in his hut-tax might induce him to work for a few  weeks in the year. If nothing will overcome his deep-rooted indolence,  other labour must be imported. Arabs from Aden are already working in  some of the mines.    The pay of the skilled white miner is 30s. a day. Throughout Rhodesia  the artisan earns good wages, the blacksmith and the bricklayer, for  example, receiving respectively 30s. and 35s. a day in Salisbury.  Detractors of Rhodesia are constantly asserting that the white  population is outrageously taxed, each settler, they state, having to  pay £40 per annum to the Chartered Company in the shape of taxes; and a  well-known politician, beloved of Little Englanders, has publicly  declared that this is the case. It appears that these ingenious people  arrived at this conclusion by dividing the amount of the Company's  revenue, £440,000, by the number of Europeans in the country, namely,  12,000, which certainly does give a result of nearly £40 per head. It is  thus assumed that all the Company's revenue is derived from the taxation  of the settlers. Now, in the first place, out of this £440,000 of  revenue, £113,000 represents the amount of the native hut-tax, and is  therefore not contributed by white people at all. Another £23,000 is  derived from the sales and rent of land, the Company's property; and  another £58,000 from the telegraph and postal services, which up till  now have been worked at a loss. No one can maintain that these items  fall under the head of taxation. To go further, another £86,000 of the  Company's revenue is paid directly by the mining companies that have  been floated--that is, by the shareholders in England, not by the people  of Rhodesia. These figures added up amount to £280,000, which leaves a  balance of £160,000--the taxation laid on the settlers, that is, about  £13 per head. To go still further, of this £160,000, £73,000 is derived  from the duties on wines, spirits, and tobacco. Therefore if one puts  these luxuries out of the calculation the taxation amounts to only £7  a head per year, which is anything but high when one bears in mind that  there are no paupers in Rhodesia, that women and children are few, and  that the large bulk of the population are adult males in the prime of  life earning high wages.    [Illustration: RHODESIAN MINING. THE DOBIE MILL]    The climate of the Rhodesian plateau is undoubtedly healthy and well  suited to British colonists. It is a land where the white man can work  in the fields. The British children reared here are as rosy of cheek and  as sturdy of limb as those at home. There is, of course, malaria in the  lowlands, but that will disappear before occupation and civilisation,  even as it has done in once unhealthy districts of the Transvaal and the  Cape Colony. It is the same with the diseases that affect domestic  animals: thus horse-sickness once prevailed far to the south, and  gradually has been driven north before advancing civilisation. The  dreaded tsetse fly too, fatal to horses and cattle, can only exist where  the larger wild beasts abound, and vanishes with the latter wherever the  white man establishes himself. The rinderpest, in killing off the wild  buffalo, did one good service: the tsetse disappeared with the buffalo,  and now only frequents remote and unfrequented regions.    From every point of view the future of Rhodesia now looks hopeful. The  young State suffered from every calamity that can befall a new country,  but was too vigorous to succumb. The Company and the Rhodesian community  have displayed pluck, energy, and patriotism in the hour of Britain's  danger, and every loyal Englishman must sincerely wish Rhodesia  prosperity. As regards the prospects of the Chartered Company itself, I  will conclude by calling attention to one point. Up till now the Company  has been compelled to maintain a large and expensive military force,  costing £276,000 a year. Now that the Boer war has been brought to a  conclusion, the necessity for so large a force has ceased to exist, and  Mr. W. H. Milton, the Senior Administrator of Southern Rhodesia, has  recommended, as sufficient to meet the requirements of the country, the  maintenance of a force of 400 Europeans and 400 natives, with a simple  organisation on the lines of the Cape Police. The cost of this, he  maintains, should not exceed £100,000 per annum. If his proposal is  accepted, the revenue of the Chartered Company should balance its  expenditure, and the corner will be turned.          PROBLEMS AND POSSIBILITIES    BY JAMES STANLEY LITTLE    _Author of \"South Africa,\" \"The Progress of the British Empire in the  Nineteenth Century,\" \"The United States of Britain,\" &c. &c._      The magnificent vagueness of the subject the editor of this volume has,  in his wisdom, thought fit to apportion to me might have its  conveniences, were it not that such pregnant matters as emigration,  federation, education, irrigation, and half-a-dozen subjects besides,  all of which bristle with problems and possibilities of the most clamant  kind, are ruled out of this paper, in that their consideration has been  entrusted to highly competent and patriotic writers, upon whose  preserves it would be unbecoming to poach. Nevertheless, it must be  obvious to everybody that it will not be possible to attempt a  comprehensive analysis of the problems and possibilities of the future,  and to keep entirely clear of these all-important factors in the case;  seeing that every political, ethnical, financial, and economic problem  impinges on these special subjects of which one and all are a part.    [Illustration: THE RESETTLEMENT OF THE TRANSVAAL A BOER FAMILY RETURNING  TO THEIR FARM.    Drawing by Chas. M. Sheldon.]    As to the political situation to-day, it seems scarcely to be  apprehended in this country that the lines of cleavage between parties  and factions at the Cape, and indeed in the new colonies, are by no  means simple ones. In South Africa generally it is not merely a case of  Briton _versus_ Boer; it is not in Cape Colony simply a case of Dutch  Africander _versus_ British loyalist. In the Transvaal the problem is  not solely how to bring the Boers and English together, or how to  conciliate and retain the loyalty of those men, largely of British  origin, formerly known as Uitlanders. A labour party, championing a  programme practically identical with that with which all students of  later-day politico-social questions are familiar, is coming into  existence, and is, I think, certain to make itself a power in the land  as time advances. It has been frequently, if somewhat hastily, assumed  that in South Africa generally parties will follow the lines of division  common to most civilised communities, and range themselves in camps, the  composition of which will be determined respectively by the place of  residence and occupation of the units of the people; the interests,  sentiments, and aspirations of the town dwellers being at variance with  those of the rural inhabitants. In a sense, we may take the people of  Johannesburg to represent what passes for the urban population of  old-settled countries. Roughly speaking, the citizens of the older  established and smaller towns were dependent for their existence, and  are likely to continue to be so dependent, on the agriculturists, since  outside the Rand the Transvaal had no industries, no manufactures worth  considering: for some time to come she is not likely to have any. So the  Rand stood and stands for the towns, and the Uitlanders for the  townsmen. The rest of the State stood and stands for the country, and,  the agriculturists being mainly Dutch, the Boers stand for the  countrymen. In the future, however, the race question, which has  practically overruled any dividing lines drawn on the basis of townsmen  and countrymen in Cape Colony, should cease to govern, in quite the old  way, the political antagonisms of the inhabitants of the Transvaal; in  any case, if the various schemes for settling British farmers in the  land are crowned with reasonable success, it will no longer be possible  to regard the rural Transvaalers as simply Boers, and the townsmen as  simply Britishers. At present in the Transvaal there exists, of course,  the great and principal division of its people, the British and  philo-British _versus_ the Dutch and philo-Dutch. But the interests of  the great mining companies are not now, and never can be, on all-fours  with those of the operatives; while the traders are likely to find their  ideals at variance with those of the mining magnates and operatives  alike. Obviously there will be no immediate community of interest and  aim between the old Boer farmers and the new British elements introduced  on to the land. The differences of the townsmen are likely to be more  strictly economic than political; but they must necessarily take a  political complexion in the process of their devolution. It would be  rash to attempt anything in the shape of a precise forecast; but it  certainly seems to me quite unlikely that the future divisions into  parties of the citizens of the Transvaal can take the simple form of  Briton _versus_ Boer. No doubt the existence of the two races, living  side by side, with the remembrance of a century's differences between  them, will continue to give a decided tincture to the parties to be  formed in the future. It depends entirely on the kind of statecraft  Great Britain brings to bear on the settlement of the new colonies and  on its results, whether the progressive elements in the existing  population--the population waiting for the gates to be opened to it may,  for the purposes of this argument, be considered as entirely  progressive--r"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4747"],[0,"The River's End (#20)"],[1," memories  to him, and he told them to Mary Josephine as they went slowly from  room to room, until John Keith was living there before her again, the  John Keith whom Derwent Conniston had run to his death. It was this  thing that gripped her, and at last what was in her mind found voice.    \"It wasn't YOU who made him die, was it, Derry? It wasn't you?\"    \"No. It was the law. He died, as I told you, of a frosted lung. At the  last I would have shared my life with him had it been possible.  McDowell must never know that. You must never speak of John Keith  before him.\"    \"I--I understand, Derry.\"    \"And he must not know that we came here. To him John Keith was a  murderer whom it was his duty to hang.\"    She was looking at him strangely. Never had he seen her look at him in  that way.    \"Derry,\" she whispered.    \"Yes?\"    \"Derry, IS JOHN KEITH ALIVE?\"    He started. The shock of the question was in his face. He caught  himself, but it was too late. And in an instant her hand was at his  mouth, and she was whispering eagerly, almost fiercely:    \"No, no, no--don't answer me, Derry! DON'T ANSWER ME! I know, and I  understand, and I'm glad, glad, GLAD! He's alive, and it was you who  let him live, the big, glorious brother I'm proud of! And everyone else  thinks he's dead. But don't answer me, Derry, don't answer me!\"    She was trembling against him. His arms closed about her, and he held  her nearer to his heart, and longer, than he had ever held her before.  He kissed her hair many times, and her lips once, and up about his neck  her arms twined softly, and a great brightness was in her eyes.    \"I understand,\" she whispered again. \"I understand.\"    \"And I--I must answer you,\" he said. \"I must answer you, because I love  you, and because you must know. Yes, John Keith is alive!\"          XVI      An hour later, alone and heading for the inspector's office, Keith felt  in battle trim. His head was fairly singing with the success of the  morning. Since the opening of Conniston's chest many things had  happened, and he was no longer facing a blank wall of mystery. His  chief cause of exhilaration was Mary Josephine. She wanted to go away  with him. She wanted to go with him anywhere, everywhere, as long as  they were together. When she had learned that his term of enlistment  was about to expire and that if he remained in the Service he would be  away from her a great deal, she had pleaded with him not to reenlist.  She did not question him when he told her that it might be necessary to  go away very suddenly, without letting another soul know of their  movements, not even Wallie. Intuitively she guessed that the reason had  something to do with John Keith, for he had let the fear grow in her  that McDowell might discover he had been a traitor to the Service, in  which event the Law itself would take him away from her for a  considerable number of years. And with that fear she was more than ever  eager for the adventure, and planned with him for its consummation.    Another thing cheered Keith. He was no longer the absolute liar of  yesterday, for by a fortunate chance he had been able to tell her that  John Keith was alive. This most important of all truths he had confided  to her, and the confession had roused in her a comradeship that had  proclaimed itself ready to fight for him or run away with him. Not for  an instant had she regretted the action he had taken in giving Keith  his freedom. He was peculiarly happy because of that. She was glad John  Keith was alive.    And now that she knew the story of the old home down in the clump of  timber and of the man who had lived there, she was anxious to meet  Miriam Kirkstone, daughter of the man he had killed. Keith had promised  her they would go up that afternoon. Within himself he knew that he was  not sure of keeping the promise. There was much to do in the next few  hours, and much might happen. In fact there was but little speculation  about it. This was the big day. Just what it held for him he could not  be sure until he saw Shan Tung. Any instant might see him put to the  final test.    Cruze was pacing slowly up and down the hall when Keith entered the  building in which McDowell had his offices. The young secretary's face  bore a perplexed and rather anxious expression. His hands were buried  deep in his trousers pockets, and he was puffing a cigarette. At  Keith's appearance he brightened up a bit.    \"Don't know what to make of the governor this morning, by Jove I  don't!\" he explained, nodding toward the closed doors. \"I've got  instructions to let no one near him except you. You may go in.\"    \"What seems to be the matter?\" Keith felt out cautiously.    Cruze shrugged his thin shoulders, nipped the ash from his cigarette,  and with a grimace said, \"Shan Tung.\"    \"Shan Tung?\" Keith spoke the name in a sibilant whisper. Every nerve in  him had jumped, and for an instant he thought he had betrayed himself.  Shan Tung had been there early. And now McDowell was waiting for him  and had given instructions that no other should be admitted. If the  Chinaman had exposed him, why hadn't McDowell sent officers up to the  Shack? That was the first question that jumped into his head. The  answer came as quickly--McDowell had not sent officers because, hating  Shan Tung, he had not believed his story. But he was waiting there to  investigate. A chill crept over Keith.    Cruze was looking at him intently.    \"There's something to this Shan Tung business,\" he said. \"It's even  getting on the old man's nerves. And he's very anxious to see you, Mr.  Conniston. I've called you up half a dozen times in the last hour.\"    He nipped away his cigarette, turned alertly, and moved toward the  inspector's door. Keith wanted to call him back, to leap upon him, if  necessary, and drag him away from that deadly door. But he neither  moved nor spoke until it was too late. The door opened, he heard Cruze  announce his presence, and it seemed to him the words were scarcely out  of the secretary's mouth when McDowell himself stood in the door.    \"Come in, Conniston,\" he said quietly. \"Come in.\"    It was not McDowell's voice. It was restrained, terrible. It was the  voice of a man speaking softly to cover a terrific fire raging within.  Keith felt himself doomed. Even as he entered, his mind was swiftly  gathering itself for the last play, the play he had set for himself if  the crisis came. He would cover McDowell, bind and gag him even as  Cruze sauntered in the hall, escape through a window, and with Mary  Josephine bury himself in the forests before pursuit could overtake  them. Therefore his amazement was unbounded when McDowell, closing the  door, seized his hand in a grip that made him wince, and shook it with  unfeigned gladness and relief.    \"I'm not condemning you, of course,\" he said. \"It was rather beastly of  me to annoy your sister before you were up this morning. She flatly  refused to rouse you, and by George, the way she said it made me turn  the business of getting into touch with you over to Cruze. Sit down,  Conniston. I'm going to explode a mine under you.\"    He flung himself into his swivel chair and twisted one of his fierce  mustaches, while his eyes blazed at Keith. Keith waited. He saw the  other was like an animal ready to spring and anxious to spring, the one  evident stricture on his desire being that there was nothing to spring  at unless it was himself.    \"What happened last night?\" he asked.    Keith's mind was already working swiftly. McDowell's question gave him  the opportunity of making the first play against Shan Tung.    \"Enough to convince me that I am going to see Shan Tung today,\" he said.    He noticed the slow clenching and unclenching of McDowell's fingers  about the arms of his chair.    \"Then--I was right?\"    \"I have every reason to believe you were--up to a certain point. I  shall know positively when I have talked with Shan Tung.\"    He smiled grimly. McDowell's eyes were no harder than his own. The iron  man drew a deep breath and relaxed a bit in his chair.    \"If anything should happen,\" he said, looking away from Keith, as  though the speech were merely casual, \"if he attacks you--\"    \"It might be necessary to kill him in self-defense,\" finished Keith.    McDowell made no sign to show that he had heard, yet Keith thrilled  with the conviction that he had struck home. He went on telling briefly  what had happened at Miriam Kirkstone's house the preceding night.  McDowell's face was purple when he described the evidences of Shan  Tung's presence at the house on the hill, but with a mighty effort he  restrained his passion.    \"That's it, that's it,\" he exclaimed, choking back his wrath. \"I knew  he was there! And this morning both of them lie about it--both of them,  do you understand! She lied, looking me straight in the eyes. And he  lied, and for the first time in his life he laughed at me, curse me if  he didn't! It was like the gurgle of oil. I didn't know a human could  laugh that way. And on top of that he told me something that I WON'T  believe, so help me God, I won't!\"    He jumped to his feet and began pacing back and forth, his hands  clenched behind him. Suddenly he whirled on Keith.    \"Why in heaven's name didn't you bring Keith back with you, or, if not  Keith, at least a written confession, signed by him?\" he demanded.    This was a blow from behind for Keith. \"What--what has Keith got to do  with this?\" he stumbled.    \"More than I dare tell you, Conniston. But WHY didn't you bring back a  signed confession from him? A dying man is usually willing to make  that.\"    \"If he is guilty, yes,\" agreed Keith. \"But this man was a different  sort. If he killed Judge Kirkstone, he had no regret. He did not  consider himself a criminal. He felt that he had dealt out justice in  his own way, and therefore, even when he was dying, he would not sign  anything or state anything definitely.\"    McDowell subsided "]]]
