I remember coming away crying; you see it  was so dark and solitary in the great gallery, and I felt so mean and  insignificant.\" And she laughed.    He was listening with earnest interest. Every word she said had a charm  for him; he had never met any girl--any woman--like her, so frank and  open-minded. Listening to her was like looking into a crystal lake, in  which everything is revealed and all is bright and pure.    \"And are you wiser now?\" he asked.    \"Not one whit!\" she replied. \"I should like now, less than then,  to be shut up in a dark gallery and look on at others enjoying  themselves. Isn't that a confession of an envious and altogether wicked  disposition?\"    \"Yes,\" he assented, with a strange smile barely escaping from under  his tawny mustache. \"I should be right in prophesying all sorts of bad  endings to you.\"    As he spoke he opened the gate for her, driving the dogs back with a  crack of his whip so that she might pass first--a small thing, but  characteristic of him.    The painter looked up.    \"Keep those dogs off my back, Leycester,\" he said. \"Well, Stella, have  you concocted your poison?\"    Stella went and looked over his shoulder.    \"Yes, uncle,\" she said.    \"You have been long enough to make twenty indigestible compounds,\" he  said, gazing at the view he was sketching.    Stella bent her head, to hide the blush which rose as she remembered  how slowly they had walked across the meadows.    \"How are you getting on?\" said Lord Leycester.    The old man grunted.    \"Pretty well; better than I shall now you have come to fidget about.\"    Lord Leycester laughed.    \"A pretty plain hint that our room is desired more than our company,  Miss Etheridge. Can we not vanish into space?\"    Stella laughed and sank down on the grass.    \"It is uncle's way of begging us to stay,\" she said.    Lord Leycester laughed, and sending the dogs off, flung himself down  almost at her feet.    \"Did I exaggerate?\" he said, pointing his whip at the view.    \"Not an atom,\" replied Stella. \"It is beautiful--beautiful, and that is  all that one can find to say.\"    \"I wish you would be content to say it and not insist upon my painting  it,\" replied Mr. Etheridge.    Lord Leycester sprang to his feet.    \"That is the last straw. We will not remain to be abused, Miss  Etheridge,\" he said.    Stella remained immovable. He came and stood over her, looking down at  her with wistful eagerness in silence.    \"What lovely woods,\" she said. \"You were right; they are carpeted with  primroses. We have none in our meadow.\"    \"Would you like to go and get some?\" he asked.    Stella turned her face up to him.    \"Yes, but I don't care to swim across.\"    He smiled, and went down to the bank, unfastened a boat, and leaping  into it, called to her.    Stella sprang to her feet with the impulsive delight of a girl at the  sight of a boat, when she had expected nothing better than rushes.    \"Is it a boat--really?\" she exclaimed.    \"Come and see,\" he said.    She went down to the water's edge and looked at it.    \"How did it come there?\" she asked.    \"I pay a fairy to drop a boat from the skies whenever I want it.\"    \"I see,\" said Stella, gravely.    He laughed.    \"How did you think I came across? Did you think I swam?\" and he  arranged a cushion.    She laughed.    \"I forgot that; how stupid of me.\"    \"Will you step in?\" he said.    Stella looked back at her uncle, and hesitated a moment.    \"He will assure you that I shall not drown you,\" he said.    \"I am not afraid--do you think I am afraid?\" she said, scornfully.    \"Yes, I think that at this moment you are trembling with nervousness  and dread.\"    She put her foot--he could not help seeing how small and shapely it  was--on the gunwale, and he held out his hand and took hers; it was  well he did so, for the boat was only a small, lightly built gig, and  her sudden movement had made it rock.    As it was, she staggered slightly, and he had to take her by the arm.  So, with one hand grasping her hand and the other her arm, he held  her for a moment--for longer than a moment. Then he placed her on the  cushion, and seating himself, took up the sculls and pushed off.    Stella leant back, and of course dropped one hand in the water. Not one  woman out of twenty who ever sat in a boat can resist that impulse to  have closer communion with the water; and he pulled slowly across the  stream.    The sun shone full upon them, making their way a path of rippling gold,  and turning Stella's hair into a rich brown.    Little wonder that, as he sat opposite her, his eyes should rest on her  face, and less that, thus resting, its exquisite beauty and freshness  and purity should sink into the soul of him to whom beauty was the one  thing worth living for.    Unconscious of his rapt gaze, Stella leant back, her eyes fixed on the  water, her whole attention absorbed by its musical ripple as it ran  through her fingers.    In silence he pulled the sculls, slowly and noiselessly; he would not  have spoken and broken the spell for worlds. Before him, as he looked  upon her, rose the picture of which he had spoken to his sister last  night.    \"But more beautiful,\" he mused--\"more beautiful! How lost she is! She  has forgotten me--forgotten everything. Oh, Heaven! if one were to  waken her into love!\"    For an instant, at the thought, the color came into his face and the  fire to his eyes; then a half guilty, half repentful feeling struck  through him.    \"No, it would be cruel--cruel: and yet to see the azure light shining  in those eyes--to see those lips half parted with the breath of a great  passion, would be worth--what? It would make amends for all that a man  might suffer, though he died the next moment, if those eyes smiled, if  those lips were upturned, for love of him!\"    So lost were they that the touching of the boat and the bank made them  start.    \"So soon,\" murmured Stella. \"How beautiful it is! I think I was  dreaming.\"    \"And I know that I was,\" he said, with a subtle significance, as he  rose and held out his hand. But Stella sprang lightly on shore without  accepting it. He tied up the boat and followed her; she was already on  her knee, picking the yellow primroses.    Without a word, he followed her example. Sometimes they were so near  together that she could feel his breath stirring her hair--so near that  their hands almost met.    At last she sank on to the mossy ground with a laugh, and, pointing to  her hat, which was full of the spring earth-stars, said laughingly:    \"What ruthless pillage! Do not pick any more; it is wanton waste!\"    \"Are you sure you have plenty?\" he said. \"Why hesitate when there are  such millions?\"    \"No, no more!\" she said. \"I feel guilty already!\"    He glanced at the handful he had gathered, and she saw the glance and  laughed.    \"You do not know what to do with those you have, and still want more.  See, you must tie them in bundles.    \"Show me,\" he said, and he threw himself down beside her.    She gathered them up into bundles, and tied them with a long stem of  fern, and he tried to do the same, but his hands, white and slender as  they were, were not so deft as hers, and he held the huge bundle to her.    \"You must tie it,\" he said.    She laughed and put the fern round, but it broke, and the primroses  fell in a golden shower over their hands. They both made a grasp at  them, and their hands met.    For a moment Stella laughed, then the laugh died away, for he still  held her hand, and the warmth of his grasp seemed stealing upward to  her heart. With something like an effort she drew her hand away, and  sprang to her feet.    \"I--I must go,\" she said. \"Uncle will wonder where I have gone,\" and  she looked down at the water with almost frightened eagerness.    \"He will know you are here, quite safe,\" he said. \"Wait, do not go this  moment. Up there, above our heads, we can see the river stretching away  for miles. It is not a step; will you come?\"    She hesitated a moment, then she turned and walked beside him between  the trees.    A step or two, as he said, and they reached a sort of plateau, crowned  by a moss-grown rock, in which some rough steps were hewn. He sprang up  the steps and reached the top, then bent down and held out his hand.    Stella hesitated a moment.    \"It will repay your trouble; come,\" he said, and she put her hand in  his and her foot on the first step, and he drew her up beside him.    \"Look!\" he said.    An exclamation of delight broke from Stella's lips.    \"You are not sorry you came?\"    \"I did not think it would be so lovely,\" she said.    He stood beside her, not looking at the view, but at her dark eyes  dilating with dreamy rapture--at her half-parted lips, and the sweet,  clear-cut profile presented to him.    She turned suddenly, and to hide the look of admiration he raised his  hand and pointed out the objects in the view.    \"And what is that little house there?\" asked Stella.    \"That is one of the lodges,\" he said.    \"One of the lodges--one of your own lodges, you mean?\" she asked.    He nodded lightly, \"Yes.\"    \"And all this between here and that lodge belongs to you?\"    \"No, not an inch,\" he said, laughing. \"To my father.\"    \"It is a great deal,\" she said.    \"Too much for one man, you think?\" he said, with a smile. \"A great many  other people think so too. I don't know what you would think if you  knew how much we Wyndwards have managed at one time or the other to lay  our acquiring grasp on. This is one of our smallest estates,\" he said,  simply.    Stella looked at the view dreamily.    \"One of the smallest? Yes, I have heard that you are very rich. It must  be very nice.\"    \"I don't know,\" he said. \"You see one cannot tell until one has been  poor. I don't think there is anything in it. I don't think one is any  the happier.

She stroked the purring Paddy, and  read steadily on, with maddening indifference to all our pleadings.    Even Cecily, the meek and mild, was snappish, and complained of  headache. Peter had gone home to see his mother, and Uncle Roger had  gone to Markdale on business. Sara Ray came up, but was so snubbed by  Felicity that she went home, crying. Felicity got the dinner by herself,  disdaining to ask or command assistance. She banged things about and  rattled the stove covers until even Cecily protested from her sofa. Dan  sat on the floor and whittled, his sole aim and object being to make a  mess and annoy Felicity, in which noble ambition he succeeded perfectly.    \"I wish Aunt Janet and Uncle Alec were home,\" said Felix. \"It's not half  so much fun having the grown-ups away as I thought it would be.\"    \"I wish I was back in Toronto,\" I said sulkily. The mince pie was to  blame for THAT wish.    \"I wish you were, I'm sure,\" said Felicity, riddling the fire noisily.    \"Any one who lives with you, Felicity King, will always be wishing he  was somewhere else,\" said Dan.    \"I wasn't talking to you, Dan King,\" retorted Felicity, \"'Speak when  you're spoken to, come when you're called.'\"    \"Oh, oh, oh,\" wailed Cecily on the sofa. \"I WISH it would stop raining.  I WISH my head would stop aching. I WISH ma had never gone away. I WISH  you'd leave Felicity alone, Dan.\"    \"I wish girls had some sense,\" said Dan--which brought the orgy of  wishing to an end for the time. A wishing fairy might have had the time  of her life in the King kitchen that morning--particularly if she were a  cynically inclined fairy.    But even the effects of unholy snacks wear away at length. By tea-time  things had brightened up. The rain had ceased, and the old, low-raftered  room was full of sunshine which danced on the shining dishes of the  dresser, made mosaics on the floor, and flickered over the table whereon  a delicious meal was spread. Felicity had put on her blue muslin, and  looked so beautiful in it that her good humour was quite restored.  Cecily's headache was better, and the Story Girl, refreshed by an  afternoon siesta, came down with smiles and sparkling eyes. Dan alone  continued to nurse his grievances, and would not even laugh when the  Story Girl told us a tale brought to mind by some of the \"Rev. Mr.  Scott's plums\" which were on the table.    \"The Rev. Mr. Scott was the man who thought the pulpit door must be made  for speerits, you know,\" she said. \"I heard Uncle Edward telling ever  so many stories about him. He was called to this congregation, and he  laboured here long and faithfully, and was much beloved, though he was  very eccentric.\"    \"What does that mean?\" asked Peter.    \"Hush! It just means queer,\" said Cecily, nudging him with her elbow. \"A  common man would be queer, but when it's a minister, it's eccentric.\"    \"When he gets very old,\" continued the Story Girl, \"the Presbytery  thought it was time he was retired. HE didn't think so; but the  Presbytery had their way, because there were so many of them to one of  him. He was retired, and a young man was called to Carlisle. Mr. Scott  went to live in town, but he came out to Carlisle very often, and  visited all the people regularly, just the same as when he was their  minister. The young minister was a very good young man, and tried to do  his duty; but he was dreadfully afraid of meeting old Mr. Scott, because  he had been told that the old minister was very angry at being set  aside, and would likely give him a sound drubbing, if he ever met him.  One day the young minister was visiting the Crawfords in Markdale, when  they suddenly heard old Mr. Scott's voice in the kitchen. The young  minister turned pale as the dead, and implored Mrs. Crawford to hid him.  But she couldn't get him out of the room, and all she could do was to  hide him in the china closet. The young minister slipped into the china  closet, and old Mr. Scott came into the room. He talked very nicely, and  read, and prayed. They made very long prayers in those days, you know;  and at the end of his prayer he said, 'Oh Lord, bless the poor young man  hiding in the closet. Give him courage not to fear the face of man. Make  him a burning and a shining light to this sadly abused congregation.'  Just imagine the feelings of the young minister in the china closet! But  he came right out like a man, though his face was very red, as soon as  Mr. Scott had done praying. And Mr. Scott was lovely to him, and shook  hands, and never mentioned the china closet. And they were the best of  friends ever afterwards.\"    \"How did old Mr. Scott find out the young minister was in the closet?\"  asked Felix.    \"Nobody ever knew. They supposed he had seen him through the  window before he came into the house, and guessed he must be in the  closet--because there was no way for him to get out of the room.\"    \"Mr. Scott planted the yellow plum tree in Grandfather's time,\" said  Cecily, peeling one of the plums, \"and when he did it he said it was  as Christian an act as he ever did. I wonder what he meant. I don't see  anything very Christian about planting a tree.\"    \"I do,\" said the Story Girl sagely.    When next we assembled ourselves together, it was after milking, and the  cares of the day were done with. We foregathered in the balsam-fragrant  aisles of the fir wood, and ate early August apples to such an extent  that the Story Girl said we made her think of the Irishman's pig.    \"An Irishman who lived at Markdale had a little pig,\" she said, \"and he  gave it a pailful of mush. The pig ate the whole pailful, and then the  Irishman put the pig IN the pail, and it didn't fill more than half the  pail. Now, how was that, when it held a whole pailful of mush?\"    This seemed to be a rather unanswerable kind of conundrum. We discussed  the problem as we roamed the wood, and Dan and Peter almost quarrelled  over it, Dan maintaining that the thing was impossible, and Peter being  of the opinion that the mush was somehow \"made thicker\" in the process  of being eaten, and so took up less room. During the discussion we came  out to the fence of the hill pasture where grew the \"bad berry\" bushes.    Just what these \"bad berries\" were I cannot tell. We never knew their  real name. They were small, red-clustered berries of a glossy, seductive  appearance, and we were forbidden to eat them, because it was thought  they might be poisonous. Dan picked a cluster and held it up.    \"Dan King, don't you DARE eat those berries,\" said Felicity in her  \"bossiest\" tone. \"They're poison. Drop them right away.\"    Now, Dan had not had the slightest intention of eating the berries. But  at Felicity's prohibition the rebellion which had smouldered in him all  day broke into sudden flame. He would show her!    \"I'll eat them if I please, Felicity King,\" he said in a fury: \"I don't  believe they're poison. Look here!\"    Dan crammed the whole bunch into his capacious mouth and chewed it up.    \"They taste great,\" he said, smacking; and he ate two more clusters,  regardless of our horror-stricken protestations and Felicity's  pleadings.    We feared that Dan would drop dead on the spot. But nothing occurred  immediately. When an hour had passed we concluded that the bad berries  were not poison after all, and we looked upon Dan as quite a hero for  daring to eat them.    \"I knew they wouldn't hurt me,\" he said loftily. \"Felicity's so fond of  making a fuss over everything.\"    Nevertheless, when it grew dark and we returned to the house, I noticed  that Dan was rather pale and quiet. He lay down on the kitchen sofa.    \"Don't you feel all right, Dan?\" I whispered anxiously.    \"Shut up,\" he said.    I shut up.    Felicity and Cecily were setting out a lunch in the pantry when we were  all startled by a loud groan from the sofa.    \"Oh, I'm sick--I'm awful sick,\" said Dan abjectly, all the defiance and  bravado gone out of him.    We all went to pieces, except Cecily, who alone retained her presence of  mind.    \"Have you got a pain in your stomach?\" she demanded.    \"I've got an awful pain here, if that's where my stomach is,\" moaned  Dan, putting his hand on a portion of his anatomy considerably below his  stomach. \"Oh--oh--oh!\"    \"Go for Uncle Roger,\" commanded Cecily, pale but composed. \"Felicity,  put on the kettle. Dan, I'm going to give you mustard and warm water.\"    The mustard and warm water produced its proper effect promptly, but gave  Dan no relief. He continued to writhe and groan. Uncle Roger, who had  been summoned from his own place, went at once for the doctor, telling  Peter to go down the hill for Mrs. Ray. Peter went, but returned  accompanied by Sara only. Mrs. Ray and Judy Pineau were both away. Sara  might better have stayed home; she was of no use, and could only add to  the general confusion, wandering aimlessly about, crying and asking if  Dan was going to die.    Cecily took charge of things. Felicity might charm the palate, and the  Story Girl bind captive the soul; but when pain and sickness wrung the  brow it was Cecily who was the ministering angel. She made the writhing  Dan go to bed. She made him swallow every available antidote which was  recommended in \"the doctor's book;\" and she applied hot cloths to him  until her faithful little hands were half scalded off.    There was no doubt Dan was suffering intense pain. He moaned and  writhed, and cried for his mother.    \"Oh, isn't it dreadful!\" said Felicity, wringing her hands as she walked  the kitchen floor. \"Oh, why doesn't the doctor come? I TOLD Dan the bad  berries were poison. But surely they can't kill people ALTOGETHER.\"    \"Pa's cousin died of eating something forty years ago,\" sobbed Sara Ray.    \"Hold your tongue,\" said Peter in a fierce whisper. \"You oughter have  more sense than to say such things to the girls. They don't want to be  any worse scared than they are."]]]
