He  was of martial feeling, and took a prominent part in quelling the local  disturbance incident on Wat Tyler's rebellion, 1381. He was employed by  Urban VI. against his rival, Pope Clement VII.; was arrested for treason  in 1399, and pardoned by Henry IV. He died 1406.    #Alexander de Totington# (1407-13), prior of Norwich, was elected by the  monks in September 1406. This election found no favour at the Court, and  he was imprisoned at Windsor for nearly a year. He was then released,  and consecrated at Gloucester by the Archbishop October 23, 1407. He  died April 28, 1413, and was buried in the Lady Chapel.    #Richard Courtenay# (1412-15) was nominated by Henry V., and consecrated  by the Archbishop at Windsor 17th September 1413. He was Chancellor of  the University of Oxford in 1407-11-13. He died at Harfleur in 1415,  while on attendance to the king during the siege of that town. His body  was brought to England, and buried in Westminster Abbey.    #John Wakering# (1416-25), who was elected by the monks, had become  keeper of the privy seal in 1415. He was consecrated at St. Paul's by  the Archbishop May 31, 1416. He persecuted the Lollards strongly, and  during his episcopate many were burned at the stake. Yet his character  apparently was far from being harsh. He died at Thorpe in 1435, and was  buried in the presbytery.    #Alnwick# (1426-36) was confessor to Henry VI., and in 1420 archdeacon  of Salisbury. He was appointed by a papal bull, and consecrated August  18, 1426. He was translated by papal bull in 1436 to Lincoln.    #Thomas Browne's# (1436-45) appointment was contained in the same bull  that translated Alnwick. He had been previously Dean of Salisbury in  1431, and Bishop of Rochester in 1435. During his episcopate the  citizens again laid the priory under siege over a question of dues due  to them, and the liberties of the city were, as a consequence, seized by  the king. Browne died in 1445, and was buried in the nave, in the front  and to the west side of rood.    #Walter Lyhart# (1446-72) was nominated by the Pope, and consecrated  February 1446, at Lambeth, by the Archbishop Stafford. He had been  confessor to Henry VI.'s wife, Margaret of Anjou. He died May 17, 1472.    #James Goldwell# (1472-99) had been ambassador of Edward IV. at Rome. He  was nominated by the Pope, and consecrated at Rome, October 4, 1472. He  died February 15, 1499.    #Thomas Jane# (1499-1500) had been Canon of Windsor and Dean of Chapel  Royal in 1497; was consecrated on October 20, 1499. He died in September  1500.    #Richard Nykke# was consecrated in 1501. He was of infamous character,  and no doubt stimulated the zeal of the reformers, who may well have  contended that the Church which had such prelates surely needed  reformation. He persecuted those opposed to him, and burned many at the  stake. He was imprisoned in 1535, for appealing to Rome touching the  king's prerogative. He died January 14, 1536.    #William Rugg# (1536-50) was the last Bishop of Norwich before the  dissolution of the monasteries. Wolsey's downfall had occurred in 1529,  and in 1536 the smaller monasteries were dissolved, and in 1538 the  larger ones shared the same fate, Norwich being among the number, the  last prior, #William Castleton#, becoming dean. William Rugg resigned  the see in 1550.    [Illustration: Monument of Bishop Goldwell.]    On the foundation of the cathedral after the Dissolution the  establishment was as follows:--        One dean.                                 Six poor men or bedesmen.      Six prebendaries.                         One sacrist.      Six minor canons.                         Two sub-sacrists.      One deacon reader of the Gospel.          One beadle of the poor men.      One deacon reader of the Epistle.         One high steward.      Eight lay clerks to be expert in singing. And clerks, porters,      One organist, eight choristers.             auditors, and a coroner.      One precentor.    And such constitution, with but few changes, has held down to this day,  the prebendaries have become resident canons, and the precentor is also  a minor canon.    #Thomas Thirley# (1550-54) owed his preferment to Norwich from  Westminster to Edward VI. Queen Mary, in September 1554, promoted him to  Ely. He was the first and only bishop Westminster has had.    #John Hopton# (1554-58) was chaplain to Queen Mary, and aided in the  persecution of the Protestants.    #John Parkhurst# (1560-75) is credited with having \"beautified and  repaired\" the bishop's palace.    #Edmund Freke# (1575-78) was translated from Rochester, and again to  Worcester in 1578.    #Edmund Scambler# (1585-94) was translated to Norwich from Peterborough.    #William Redman# (1594-1602).    #John Jegon# (1602-1617) was master of Benedict College for twelve  years.    #John Overall# (1618-19) was translated from Lichfield and Coventry; he  enjoyed the reputation of being the \"best scholastic divine in the  English nation.\"    #Samuel Harsnet# (1619-28); translated to York in 1628.    #Francis White# (1628-31); translated to Ely in 1631.    #Richard Corbet# (1632) was translated from Oxford. Of him it was said  \"he was a distinguished wit in an age of wits, and a liberal man amongst  a race of intolerant partisans.\"    #Matthew Wren# (1635-38); translated to Ely in 1638.    #Richard Montague# (1638-41); translated from Chichester.    #Joseph Hall# (1641-56); translated from Exeter. We have quoted in the  notes on nave from his \"Hard Measure.\"    #Edward Reynolds# (1661-76).    #Antony Sparrow# (1676-85); translated from Exeter. He was the author of  a \"Rationale upon the Book of Common Prayer,\" 1657.    #William Lloyd #(1685-91); translated from Llandaff to Peterborough, and  from thence to Norwich. He was deposed in 1690 for refusing to take the  oath of allegiance to William III.    #John Moore# (1691-1707); translated to Ely in 1707.    #Charles Trimmell# (1708-1721); translated to Winchester in 1721.    #Thomas Green# (1721-23); translated to Ely 1723.    #John Lang# (1723-27).    #William Baker# (1727-32); translated from Bangor.    #Robert Butts# (1733-38); translated to Ely 1738.    #Sir Thomas Gooch, Bart.# (1738-48); translated from Bristol.    #Samuel Lisle# (1748-49); translated from St. Asaph.    #Thomas Hayter# (1749-61); translated to London in 1761.    #Philip Yonge# (1761-83); translated from Bristol.    #Lewis Bagot# (1783-90); translated from Bristol.    #George Horne# (1791-92).    #Charles Manners Sutton# (1792-1805); translated to Canterbury in 1805.    #Henry Bathurst# (1805-37).    #Edward Stanley# (1837-49), father of the late Dean of Westminster.    #Samuel Hinds# (1849-57).    #John Thomas Pelham# (1857-93).    #J. Sheepshanks# (1893).    [Illustration: The Pelican Lectern in the Choir.]          CHAPTER V    THE CITY      The visitor to this ancient city will by no means wish to confine his  attention to the Cathedral and its precincts; but the space at our  disposal will not permit more than a list of other monuments which are  worthy of attention. Among these the #Castle# naturally comes first.  Occupying the site of a very ancient--probably British--stronghold, the  first building was erected in early Norman times. For many years it was  the principal fortress of the Bigods, Earls of Norfolk, and under them  experienced many vicissitudes of fortune at the hands of both Flemings  and French. The last event of importance connected with it was the  hanging of Kett in 1549. The keep is in dimensions 96 x 92 feet, its  height being 72 feet (see p. 99).    The #Guildhall# contains many interesting relics of the civil life of  Norwich during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, including those  of the famous Guild of S. George, established in 1385 and dissolved in  1731 (see p. 103).    #St. Andrew's Hall#, a fifteenth-century building, was formerly the nave  of the Church of the Blackfriars. It contains some good pictures of the  English School.    Among the Churches, that of St. Peter, Mancroft (fifteenth century),  is well worth a visit. Its tower, 98 feet in height, contains one of the  most famous peals of bells in England, and has always been the  headquarters of a notable band of change-ringers. Of the others, St.  Gregory, Pottergate, has some interesting antiquities; St. Giles', St.  Helen's, and St. John the Baptist are all of importance: the latter has  some good mural painting and monumental brasses, which should also be  examined. St. Michael's, Coslaney, is a well-known type of the Norfolk  flint construction.    At #Pull's Ferry# the water-gate to the precincts is still standing. It  is an interesting piece of flint work. The ferry itself, of which a view  is given here, is a favourite sketching place.

Words and phrases which were italicized in the original have been    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19719"],[0,"The Art Of Writing & Speaking The English Language (#15)"],[1,"above paragraphs?  What silent  letters?  What principle or rule applies to _condition? having?  distress? getting? committed? eleven?_  What is peculiar about _thought?  lives? laid? mercy? blew? pieces? mountain? league? half? could?_ Compare  _ei_ in height and _i_ alone in _high_.  Think of _nothing_ as _no thing._  To remember the _ie_ in _piece,_ remember that _pie_ and _piece_ are  spelled in the same way.  _Separate_ has an _a_ in the second syllable--  like _part,_ since _separate_ means to \"_part_ in two.\"  You easily the  word PART in SEPARATE, Observe that _ful_ in _dreadful_ has but one _l_.     III.    4.  That wave carried me a vast way on toward shore, and having spent  itself went back, leaving me upon the land almost dry, but half dead  with the water I had taken into my lungs and stomach.  Seeing myself  nearer the mainland than I had expected, with what breath I had left I  got upon my feet and endeavored with all my strength to make toward land  as fast as I could.    5.  I was wholly buried by the next wave that came upon me,  but again I was carried a great way toward shore.  I was ready to burst  with holding my breath, when to my relief I found my head and hands  shoot above the surface of the water.  I was covered again with water,  and dashed against a rock.  The blow, taking my breast and side,  beat the breath quite out of my body.  I held fast by the piece of rock,  however, and then, although very weak, I fetched another run,  so that I succeeded in getting to the mainland, where I sat me down,  quite out of reach of the water.    Questions and Notes.  In what words in the preceding paragraphs has  silent _a_ been dropped on adding a syllable?  In what words do you find  the digraph _ea,_ and what sound does it have in each?  How many  different sounds of _ea_ do you find?  What is the difference between  _breath_ and _breathe---all_ the differences?  How many l's in _almost?_    In what other compounds does _all_ drop one _l_?  Why do we not have two  _r_'s in _covered_?  (Answer. The syllable containing _er_ is not accented.  Only accented syllables double a final single consonant on adding a  syllable.) What rule applies in the formation of _carried? having?  endeavored? buried? taking? although? getting?_  What is peculiar in  _toward? half? water? stomach? wholly? again? body? succeeded? of?_    To remember whether _relief, belief,_ etc., have the digraph _ie_ or  _ei,_ notice that _e_ just precedes _f_ in the alphabet and in the word,  while the _i_ is nearer the _l_; besides, the words contain the word  _lie_.  In _receive, receipt,_ the _e_ is placed nearest the _c_, which  it is nearest in the alphabet.  Or, think of _lice: i_ follows _l_ and  _e_ follows _a,_ as in the words _believe_ and _receive_.    Observe the two _l_'s in _wholly,---_ one in _whole_; we do not have  _wholely,_ as we might expect.  Also observe that in _again_ and _against  ai_ has the sound of _e_ short, as _a_ has that sound in _any_ and _many_.     IV.    6.  I believe it is impossible truly to express what the ecstasies of  the soul are when it is so saved, as I may say, out of the grave.  \"For sudden joys, like sudden griefs, confound at first.\"    7.  I walked about on the shore, my whole being wrapped up in thinking  of what I had been through, and thanking God for my deliverance.  Not one soul had been saved but myself.  Nor did I afterward see any  sign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes.    8.  I soon began to look about me.  I had no change of clothes,  nor anything either to eat or drink; nor did I see anything before me  but dying of hunger or being eaten by wild beasts.    (Crusoe afterward cast up a sort of ledger account of the good and evil  in his lot.  On the side of evil he placed, first, the fact that he had  been thrown upon a bare and barren island, with no hope of escape.  Against this he set the item that he alone had been saved.  On the side of evil he noted that he had no clothes; but on the other  hand, this was a warm climate, where he could hardly wear clothes if he  had them.  Twenty-five years later he thought he would be perfectly  happy if he were not in terror of men coming to his island--who,  he feared, might eat him.)    Questions and Notes.  How do you remember the _ie_ in _believe, grief,_  etc.?  Give several illustrations from the above paragraphs of the  principle that we have a double consonant (in an accented penultimate  syllable) after a short vowel.  Give illustrations of the single consonant  after a long vowel.  Make a list of the words containing silent letters,  including all digraphs.  What letter does _true_ have which _truly_ does  not?  Is _whole_ pronounced like _hole? wholly_ like _holy?_  What is the  difference between _clothes_ and _cloths?_  What sound has _a_ in _any_?  How do you remember that _i_ follows _e_ in _their?_  What rule applies in  the formation of _dying_?  Point out two words or more in the above in  which we have a silent _a_ following two consonants to indicate a  preceding long vowel.  Give cases of a digraph followed by a silent _e_.  (Note.  Add silent _e_ to _past_ and make _paste_---long _a_.)  Is the _i_  in _evil_ sounded?  There were no _bears_ upon this island.  Mention  another kind of _bear_.  Observe the difference between _hardware_--  iron goods--and _hard wear,_ meaning tough usage.  What is peculiar about  _soul? impossible? ecstasies? wrapped? deliverance? sign? except? shoes?  hunger? thrown? terror? island?_     V.    9.  I decided to climb into a tree and sit there until the next day,  to think what death I should die.  As night came on my heart was heavy,  since at night beasts come abroad for their prey.  Having cut a short  stick for my defense, I took up my lodging on a bough, and fell fast  asleep.  I afterward found I had no reason to fear wild beasts,  for never did I meet any harmful animal.    10.  When I awoke it was broad day, the weather was clear and I saw the  ship driven almost to the rock where I had been so bruised.  The ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself aboard,  that I might save some necessary things for my use.    (Crusoe shows his good judgment in thinking at once of saving something  from the ship for his after use.  While others would have been bemoaning  their fate, he took from the vessel what he knew would prove useful,  and in his very labors he at last found happiness.  Not only while his  home-building was new, but even years after, we find him still hard at  work and still inventing new things.)    Questions and Notes.  There are two _l_'s in _till_; why not in _until?_    What other words ending in two _l_'s drop one _l_ in compounds?  What two sounds do you find given to _oa_ in the preceding paragraphs?  What is peculiar about _climb? death? dies? night? heart? heavy? since?  beasts? prey? defense? lodging? bough? never? harmful? weather? driven?  bruised? necessary? judgment? others? happiness? build?_    Use the following words in appropriate sentences:  _clime, dye, pray,  bow, write, would_.  What two pronunciations may _bow_ have,  and what is the difference in meaning?  What two sounds may _s_ have in  _use,_ and what difference do they mark?    What two rules are violated in _judgment?_  What other words are similar  exceptions?     VI.    11.  As I found the water very calm and the ship but a quarter of a mile  out, I made up my mind to swim out and get on board her.  I at once  proceeded to the task.  My first work was to search out the provisions,  since I was very well disposed to eat.  I went to the bread-room and  filled my pockets with biscuit.  I saw that I wanted nothing but a boat  to supply myself with many things which would be necessary to me,  and I glanced about me to see how I might meet this need.    12.  I found two or three large spars and a spare mast or two,  which I threw overboard, tying every one with a rope that it might  not drift away.  Climbing down the ship's side, I pulled them toward  me and tied four of them fast together in the form of a raft,  laying two or three pieces of plank upon them crosswise.    13.  I now had a raft strong enough to bear any reasonable weight.  My next care was to load it.  I got three of the seamen's chests,  which I managed to break open and empty.  These I filled with bread,  rice, five pieces of dried goat's flesh, and a little remainder of  European grain.  There had been some barley and wheat together;  but the rats had eaten or spoiled it.    Questions and Notes.  In _calm_ you have a silent _l_; what other words  can you mention with this silent _l_?  Note the double _e_ in _proceed_  and _succeed; precede_ has one _e_ with the silent _e_ at the end.  Note that _u_ is inserted into _biscuit_ simply to make the _c_ hard  before _i_;  with this allowance, this word is spelled regularly.  What is the difference between _spar_ and _spare?_  What other word have  we had pronounced like _threw_?  Explain _tying_ and _tied_.  Did any change take place when _ed_ was added to _tie_?  Note that  _four_ is spelled with _ou_ for the long _o_ sound; _forty_ with a  simple _o_.  How is _14_ spelled?  How do you remember _ie_ in _piece_?  What sound has _ei_ in _weight_?  Mention another word in which _ei_ has  the same sound.  What other word is pronounced like _bear_?  How do you  spell the word like this which is the name of a kind of animal?  In what  three ways do you find the long sound of _a_ represented in the above  paragraphs?  Make a list of the words with silent consonants?     VII.    14.  My next care was for arms.  There were two very good fowling-pieces  in the great cabin, and two pistols.  And now I thought myself pretty well  freighted, and began to think how I should get to shore, having neither  sail, oar, nor rudder; and the least capful of wind would have overset me.    15.  I made many other journeys to the ship, and took away among other "]]]
