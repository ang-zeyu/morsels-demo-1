He could not say it better; but he felt a sympathy for the  little girl, and asked her where she was going all alone. The word  \"alone\" Gerda understood quite well, and felt how much was expressed  by it; so she told the Raven her whole history, and asked if he had not  seen Kay.    The Raven nodded very gravely, and said, \"It may be--it may be!\"    \"What, do you really think so?\" cried the little girl; and she nearly  squeezed the Raven to death, so much did she kiss him.    \"Gently, gently,\" said the Raven. \"I think I know; I think that it may  be little Kay. But now he has forgotten you for the Princess.\"    \"Does he live with a Princess?\" asked Gerda.    \"Yes--listen,\" said the Raven; \"but it will be difficult for me to  speak your language. If you understand the Raven language I can tell you  better.\"    \"No, I have not learnt it,\" said Gerda; \"but my grandmother understands  it, and she can speak gibberish too. I wish I had learnt it.\"    \"No matter,\" said the Raven; \"I will tell you as well as I can; however,  it will be bad enough.\" And then he told all he knew.    \"In the kingdom where we now are there lives a Princess, who is  extraordinarily clever; for she has read all the newspapers in the whole  world, and has forgotten them again--so clever is she. She was lately,  it is said, sitting on her throne--which is not very amusing after  all--when she began humming an old tune, and it was just, 'Oh, why  should I not be married?' 'That song is not without its meaning,' said  she, and so then she was determined to marry; but she would have a  husband who knew how to give an answer when he was spoken to--not  one who looked only as if he were a great personage, for that is so  tiresome. She then had all the ladies of the court drummed together; and  when they heard her intention, all were very pleased, and said, 'We are  very glad to hear it; it is the very thing we were thinking of.' You may  believe every word I say,\" said the Raven; \"for I have a tame sweetheart  that hops about in the palace quite free, and it was she who told me all  this.    \"The newspapers appeared forthwith with a border of hearts and the  initials of the Princess; and therein you might read that every  good-looking young man was at liberty to come to the palace and speak to  the Princess; and he who spoke in such wise as showed he felt himself at  home there, that one the Princess would choose for her husband.    \"Yes, Yes,\" said the Raven, \"you may believe it; it is as true as I am  sitting here. People came in crowds; there was a crush and a hurry, but  no one was successful either on the first or second day. They could all  talk well enough when they were out in the street; but as soon as  they came inside the palace gates, and saw the guard richly dressed  in silver, and the lackeys in gold on the staircase, and the large  illuminated saloons, then they were abashed; and when they stood before  the throne on which the Princess was sitting, all they could do was  to repeat the last word they had uttered, and to hear it again did not  interest her very much. It was just as if the people within were under  a charm, and had fallen into a trance till they came out again into the  street; for then--oh, then--they could chatter enough. There was a whole  row of them standing from the town-gates to the palace. I was there  myself to look,\" said the Raven. \"They grew hungry and thirsty; but from  the palace they got nothing whatever, not even a glass of water. Some  of the cleverest, it is true, had taken bread and butter with them:  but none shared it with his neighbor, for each thought, 'Let him look  hungry, and then the Princess won't have him.'\"    \"But Kay--little Kay,\" said Gerda, \"when did he come? Was he among the  number?\"    \"Patience, patience; we are just come to him. It was on the third day  when a little personage without horse or equipage, came marching right  boldly up to the palace; his eyes shone like yours, he had beautiful  long hair, but his clothes were very shabby.\"    \"That was Kay,\" cried Gerda, with a voice of delight. \"Oh, now I've  found him!\" and she clapped her hands for joy.    \"He had a little knapsack at his back,\" said the Raven.    \"No, that was certainly his sledge,\" said Gerda; \"for when he went away  he took his sledge with him.\"    \"That may be,\" said the Raven; \"I did not examine him so minutely; but  I know from my tame sweetheart, that when he came into the court-yard  of the palace, and saw the body-guard in silver, the lackeys on the  staircase, he was not the least abashed; he nodded, and said to them,  'It must be very tiresome to stand on the stairs; for my part, I shall  go in.' The saloons were gleaming with lustres--privy councillors and  excellencies were walking about barefooted, and wore gold keys; it was  enough to make any one feel uncomfortable. His boots creaked, too, so  loudly, but still he was not at all afraid.\"    \"That's Kay for certain,\" said Gerda. \"I know he had on new boots; I  have heard them creaking in grandmama's room.\"    \"Yes, they creaked,\" said the Raven. \"And on he went boldly up to the  Princess, who was sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning-wheel.  All the ladies of the court, with their attendants and attendants'  attendants, and all the cavaliers, with their gentlemen and gentlemen's  gentlemen, stood round; and the nearer they stood to the door, the  prouder they looked. It was hardly possible to look at the gentleman's  gentleman, so very haughtily did he stand in the doorway.\"    \"It must have been terrible,\" said little Gerda. \"And did Kay get the  Princess?\"    \"Were I not a Raven, I should have taken the Princess myself, although  I am promised. It is said he spoke as well as I speak when I talk Raven  language; this I learned from my tame sweetheart. He was bold and nicely  behaved; he had not come to woo the Princess, but only to hear her  wisdom. She pleased him, and he pleased her.\"    \"Yes, yes; for certain that was Kay,\" said Gerda. \"He was so clever;  he could reckon fractions in his head. Oh, won't you take me to the  palace?\"    \"That is very easily said,\" answered the Raven. \"But how are we to  manage it? I'll speak to my tame sweetheart about it: she must advise  us; for so much I must tell you, such a little girl as you are will  never get permission to enter.\"    \"Oh, yes I shall,\" said Gerda; \"when Kay hears that I am here, he will  come out directly to fetch me.\"    \"Wait for me here on these steps,\" said the Raven. He moved his head  backwards and forwards and flew away.    The evening was closing in when the Raven returned. \"Caw--caw!\" said he.  \"She sends you her compliments; and here is a roll for you. She took  it out of the kitchen, where there is bread enough. You are hungry,  no doubt. It is not possible for you to enter the palace, for you are  barefooted: the guards in silver, and the lackeys in gold, would not  allow it; but do not cry, you shall come in still. My sweetheart knows a  little back stair that leads to the bedchamber, and she knows where she  can get the key of it.\"    And they went into the garden in the large avenue, where one leaf was  falling after the other; and when the lights in the palace had all  gradually disappeared, the Raven led little Gerda to the back door,  which stood half open.    Oh, how Gerda's heart beat with anxiety and longing! It was just as if  she had been about to do something wrong; and yet she only wanted to  know if little Kay was there. Yes, he must be there. She called to mind  his intelligent eyes, and his long hair, so vividly, she could quite see  him as he used to laugh when they were sitting under the roses at home.  \"He will, no doubt, be glad to see you--to hear what a long way you have  come for his sake; to know how unhappy all at home were when he did not  come back.\"    Oh, what a fright and a joy it was!    They were now on the stairs. A single lamp was burning there; and on the  floor stood the tame Raven, turning her head on every side and looking  at Gerda, who bowed as her grandmother had taught her to do.    \"My intended has told me so much good of you, my dear young lady,\" said  the tame Raven. \"Your tale is very affecting. If you will take the lamp,  I will go before. We will go straight on, for we shall meet no one.\"    \"I think there is somebody just behind us,\" said Gerda; and something  rushed past: it was like shadowy figures on the wall; horses with  flowing manes and thin legs, huntsmen, ladies and gentlemen on  horseback.    \"They are only dreams,\" said the Raven. \"They come to fetch the thoughts  of the high personages to the chase; 'tis well, for now you can observe  them in bed all the better. But let me find, when you enjoy honor and  distinction, that you possess a grateful heart.\"    \"Tut! That's not worth talking about,\" said the Raven of the woods.    They now entered the first saloon, which was of rose-colored satin, with  artificial flowers on the wall. Here the dreams were rushing past,  but they hastened by so quickly that Gerda could not see the high  personages. One hall was more magnificent than the other; one might  indeed well be abashed; and at last they came into the bedchamber. The  ceiling of the room resembled a large palm-tree with leaves of glass,  of costly glass; and in the middle, from a thick golden stem, hung two  beds, each of which resembled a lily. One was white, and in this lay the  Princess; the other was red, and it was here that Gerda was to look for  little Kay. She bent back one of the red leaves, and saw a brown neck.  Oh! that was Kay! She called him quite loud by name, held the lamp  towards him--the dreams rushed back again into the chamber--he awoke,  turned his head, and--it was not little Kay!    The Prince was only like him about the neck; but he was young and  handsome. And out of the white lily leaves the Princess peeped, too,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16042"],[0,"The Wonder Book of Bible Stories (#15)"],[1,"answered King Saul:    \"I am only a shepherd, but I have fought with lions and bears, when they  have tried to steal my sheep. And I am not afraid to fight with this  Philistine.\"    Then Saul put his own armor on David--a helmet on his head, and a coat  of mail on his body, and a sword at his waist. But Saul was almost a  giant, and his armor was far too large for David. David said:    \"I am not used to fighting with such weapons as these. Let me fight in  my own way.\"    So David took off Saul's armor. While everybody in the army had been  looking on the giant with fear, David had been thinking out the best way  for fighting him; and God had given to David a plan. It was to throw the  giant off his guard, by appearing weak and helpless; and while so far  away that the giant could not reach him with sword or spear, to strike  him down with a weapon which the giant would not expect and would not  be prepared for.    David took his shepherd's staff in his hand, as though that were to be  his weapon. But out of sight, in a bag under his mantle, he had five  smooth stones carefully chosen, and a sling,--the weapon that he knew  how to use. Then he came out to meet the Philistine.    The giant looked down on the youth and despised him, and laughed.    [Illustration: _The giant looked down on the youth and despised  him_]    \"Am I a dog?\" he said, \"that this boy comes to me with a staff? I will  give his body to the birds of the air, and the beasts of the field.\"    And the Philistine cursed David by the gods of his people. And David  answered him:    \"You come against me with a sword, and a spear, and a dart; but I come  to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of  Israel. This day will the Lord give you into my hand. I will strike you  down, and take off your head, and the host of the Philistines shall be  dead bodies, to be eaten by the birds and the beasts; so that all may  know that there is a God in Israel, and that He can save in other ways  besides with sword and spear.\"    [Illustration: _David drew out the giant's own sword_]    And David ran toward the Philistine, as if to fight him with his  shepherd's staff. But when he was just near enough for a good aim, he  took out his sling, and hurled a stone aimed at the giant's forehead.  David's aim was good; the stone struck the Philistine in his forehead.  It stunned him, and he fell to the ground.    While the two armies stood wondering, and scarcely knowing what had  caused the giant to fall so suddenly, David ran forward, drew out the  giant's own sword, and cut off his head. Then the Philistines knew that  their great warrior in whom they trusted was dead. They turned to flee  to their own land; and the Israelites followed after them, and killed  them by the hundred and the thousand, even to the gates of their own  city of Gath.    So in that day David won a great victory and stood before all the land  as the one who had saved his people from their enemies.          THE STORY OF THE CAVE OF ADULLAM      Now Saul had a son, Jonathan, near David's own age. He and David became  fast friends and loved one another as brothers. Saul the king became  very jealous of David because the people praised him after his fight  with Goliath. He even threatened to take David's life. He tried to catch  him in his own house, but David's wife let him down from a window by a  rope and he escaped. He met his friend Jonathan, who told him that he  should flee. They renewed their promises of friendship, which they kept  ever afterward.    From his meeting with Jonathan, David went forth to be a wanderer,  having no home as long as Saul lived. He found a great cave, called the  cave of Adullam, and hid in it. Soon people heard where he was, and from  all parts of the land, especially from his own tribe of Judah, men who  were not satisfied with the rule of King Saul gathered around David.    Saul soon heard that David, with a band of men, was hiding among the  mountains of Judah, and that among those who aided him were certain  priests.    This enraged King Saul, and he ordered his guards to kill all the  priests. The guards would not obey him, for they felt that it was a  wicked thing to lay hands upon the priests of the Lord.    But he found one man whose name was Doeg, an Edomite, who was willing to  obey the king. And Doeg, the Edomite, killed eighty-five men who wore  the priestly garments.    All through the land went the news of Saul's dreadful deed, and  everywhere the people began to turn from Saul, and to look toward David  as the only hope of the nation.    When Saul died he was followed by David, the shepherd boy, now grown to  manhood and greatly loved by the people. He had many battles to fight  with the Philistines and was nearly always victorious. He was a warrior  king; but he was more than a warrior. He played on his harp and composed  many beautiful hymns and songs, which are collected in the book of  Psalms. He was a good king and tried to obey God's command. He had a  long reign and his people were happy and prosperous. He had many sons  and daughters and beautiful palaces for them to live in.          THE STORY OF SOLOMON AND HIS TEMPLE      During the later years of David's reign, he laid up great treasure of  gold and silver, and brass, and iron, for the building of a house to the  Lord on Mount Moriah. This house was to be called \"The Temple\"; and it  was to be made very beautiful, the most beautiful building, and the  richest in all the land. David had greatly desired to build this house  while he was king of Israel, but God said to him:    \"You have been a man of war, and have fought many battles, and shed much  blood. My house shall be built by a man of peace. When you die, your son  Solomon shall reign, and he shall have peace, and shall build my house.\"    So David made ready great store of precious things for the temple; also  stone and cedar to be used in the building. And David said to Solomon,  his son: \"God has promised that there shall be rest and peace to the  land while you are king; and the Lord will be with you, and you shall  build a house, where God shall live among His people.\"    But David had other sons who were older than Solomon; and one of these  sons, whose name was Adonijah, formed a plan to make himself king.  David was now very old; and he was no longer able to go out of his  palace, and to be seen among the people.    Adonijah gathered his friends; and among them were Joab, the general of  the army, and Abiathar, one of the two high-priests. They met at a place  outside the wall, and had a great feast, and were about to crown  Adonijah as king, when word came to David in the palace. David, though  old and feeble, was still wise. He said:    \"Let us make Solomon king at once, and thus put an end to the plans of  these men.\"    So at David's command they brought out the mule on which no one but the  king was allowed to ride; and they placed Solomon upon it; and with the  king's guards, and the nobles, and the great men, they brought the young  Solomon down to the valley of Gihon, south of the city.    And Zadok, the priest, took from the Tabernacle the horn filled with  holy oil, that was used for anointing or pouring oil on the head of the  priests when they were set apart for their work. He poured oil from this  horn on the head of Solomon, and then the priests blew the trumpets, and  all the people cried aloud, \"God save King Solomon.\"    All this time Adonijah and Joab, and their friends were not far away,  almost in the same valley, feasting and making merry, intending to make  Adonijah king. They heard the sound of the trumpets, and the shouting of  the people. Joab said: \"What is the cause of all this noise and uproar?\"    A moment later, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar, came running in. Jonathan  said to the men who were feasting:    \"Our lord King David has made Solomon king, and he has just been  anointed in Gihon; and all the princes, and the heads of the army, are  with him, and the people are shouting, 'God save King Solomon!' And  David has sent from his bed a message to Solomon, saying, 'May the Lord  make your name greater than mine has been! Blessed be the Lord, who has  given me a son to sit this day on my throne!'\"    When Adonijah and his friends heard this they were filled with fear.  Every man went at once to his house, except Adonijah. He hastened to the  altar of the Lord, and knelt before it, and took hold of the horns that  were on its corners in front. This was a holy place, and he hoped that  there Solomon might have mercy on him. And Solomon said:    \"If Adonijah will do right, and be faithful to me as the king of Israel,  no harm shall come to him; but if he does wrong, he shall die.\"    Then Adonijah came and bowed down before King Solomon, and promised to  obey him, and Solomon said, \"Go to your own house.\"    [Illustration: _Solomon on his throne_]    Not long after this David sent for Solomon, and from his bed he gave his  last advice to Solomon. And soon after that David died, an old man,  having reigned in all forty years, seven years over the tribe of Judah,  at Hebron, and thirty-three years over all Israel, in Jerusalem. He was  buried in great honor on Mount Zion, and his tomb remained standing for  many years.    The great work of Solomon's reign was the building of the House of God.  It was generally called the Temple. It was built on Mount Moriah, one of  the hills of Jerusalem. King David had prepared for it by gathering  great stores of silver, stone and cedar-wood. The walls were made of  stone and the roof of cedar. Solomon had great ships which visited other  lands and brought precious stones and fine woods for the building.  Seven years were spent in building the Temple, and it was set apart to  the worship of God with beautiful ceremonies in which Solomon, in his  robes of state, took part.
