This is the heading to the \"Belman's Cry\":         Men and Children, Maides and Wives,       'Tis not late to mend your lives:                *       *       *       *       *         When you heare this ringing Bell,       Think it is your latest knell:       When I cry, Maide in your Smocke,       Doe not take it for a mocke:       Well I meane, if well 'tis taken,       I would have you still awaken:       Foure a Clocke, the Cock is crowing       I must to my home be going:       When all other men doe rise,       Then must I shut up mine eyes.    He was a person of such importance, that in 1716 Vincent Bourne  composed a long Latin poem in praise of one of the fraternity: \"Ad  Davidem Cook, Westmonasterii Custodem Nocturnum et Vigilantissimum,\"  a translation of which runs thus, in the last few lines:         Should you and your dog ever call at my door,       You'll be welcome, I promise you, nobody more.       May you call at a thousand each year that you live,       A shilling, at least, may each householder give;       May the \"Merry Old Christmas\" you wish us, befal,       And your self, and your dog, be the merriest of all!    At Christ-tide it was their custom to leave a copy of verses, mostly  of Scriptural character, and generally very sorry stuff, at every  house on their beat, with a view to receiving a Christmas box; and  this was an old custom, for Gay notices it in his _Trivia_ (book ii.)  written in 1715:         Behold that narrow street which steep descends,       Whose building to the slimy shore extends;       Here Arundel's fam'd structure rear'd its frame,       The street, alone, retains the empty name;       Where Titian's glowing paint the canvass warm'd,       And Raphael's fair design, with judgment, charm'd,       Now hangs the _bellman's song_, and pasted here       The coloured prints of Overton appear.    Another ante-Christmas custom now falling into desuetude is the waits,  who originally were musical watchmen, who had to give practical  evidence of their vigilance by playing on the hautboy, or flageolet,  at stated times during the night. In the household of Edward IV. there  is mentioned in the _Liber niger Domus Regis_, \"A Wayte, that nightely  from Mychelmas to Shreve Thorsdaye, _pipe the watch_ within this  courte fowere tymes; in the Somere nightes three tymes, and maketh  _bon gayte_ at every chambre doare and offyce, as well for feare of  pyckeres and pillers.\"[25]    [Footnote 25: Pickers and stealers.]    These waits afterwards became bands of musicians, who were ready to  play at any festivities, such as weddings, etc., and almost every city  and town had its band of waits; the City of London had its Corporation  Waits, which played before the Lord Mayor in his inaugural procession,  and at banquets and other festivities. They wore blue gowns, red  sleeves and caps, and every one had a silver collar about his neck.  Ned Ward thus describes them in his _London Spy_ (1703).    \"At last bolted out from the corner of a street, with an _ignis  fatuus_ dancing before them, a parcel of strange hobgoblins, covered  with long frieze rugs and blankets, hooped round with leather girdles  from their cruppers to their shoulders, and their noddles buttoned up  into caps of martial figure, like a Knight Errant at tilt and  tournament, with his wooden head locked in an iron helmet; one, armed,  as I thought with a lusty faggot-bat, and the rest with strange wooden  weapons in their hands, in the shape of clyster pipes, but as long  almost as speaking trumpets. Of a sudden they clapped them to their  mouths, and made such a frightful yelling that I thought _he_ would  have been dissolving, and the terrible sound of the last trumpet to be  within an inch of my ears.... 'Why, what,' says he, 'don't you love  musick? These are the topping tooters of the town, and have gowns,  silver chains and salaries for playing _Lilli-borlero_ to my Lord  Mayor's horse through the City.'\"    That these Corporation Waits were no mean musicians we have the  authority of Morley, who, in dedicating his _Consort Lessons_ to the  Lord Mayor and Aldermen in 1599, says:    \"As the ancient custom of this most honourable and renowned city hath  been ever to retain and maintain excellent and expert musicians to  adorn your Honours' favours, feasts and solemn meetings--to these,  your Lordships' Wayts, I recommend the same--to your servants' careful  and skilful handling.\"    These concert lessons were arranged for six instruments--viz. two  viols (treble and bass), a flute, a cittern (a kind of guitar, strung  with wire), a treble lute, and a pandora, which was a large  instrument, similar to a lute, but strung with wire in lieu of catgut.    The following is a description of the York Waits, end of seventeenth  century:         In a Winter's morning,       Long before the dawning,       'Ere the cock did crow,       Or stars their light withdraw,       Wak'd by a hornpipe pretty,       Play'd along York City,       By th' help of o'er night's bottle       Damon made this ditty....       In a winter's night,       By moon or lanthorn light,       Through hail, rain, frost, or snow       Their rounds the music go;       Clad each in frieze or blanket       (For either, heav'n be thanked),       Lin'd with wine a quart,       Or ale a double tankard.       Burglars send away,       And, bar guests dare not stay;       Of claret, snoring sots       Dream o'er their pipes and pots,                *       *       *       *       *         Candles, four in the pound,       Lead up the jolly Round,       While Cornet shrill i' th' middle       Marches, and merry fiddle,       Curtal with deep hum, hum,       Cries we come, come,       And theorbo loudly answers,       Thrum, thrum, thrum, thrum, thrum.       But, their fingers frost-nipt,       So many notes are o'erslipt,       That you'd take sometimes       The Waits for the Minster chimes:       Then, Sirs, to hear their musick       Would make both me and you sick,       And much more to hear a roopy fiddler call       (With voice, as Moll would cry,       \"Come, shrimps, or cockles buy\").       \"Past three, fair frosty morn,       Good morrow, my masters all.\"    With regard to their modern practice of playing during the night-tide,  we find the following explanation in an _Essay on the Musical Waits at  Christmas_, by John Cleland, 1766. Speaking of the Druids, he says:  \"But, whatever were their reasons for this preference, it is out of  doubt that they generally chose the dead of night for the celebration  of their greatest solemnities and festivals. Such assemblies, then,  whether of religion, of ceremony, or of mere merriment, were  promiscuously called _Wakes_, from their being nocturnal. The master  of the _Revels_ (_Reveils_) would, in good old English, be termed the  Master of the _Wakes_. In short, such nocturnal meetings are the  _Wakes_ of the Britons; the _Reveillons_ of the French; the  _Medianoche_ of the Spaniards; and the _Pervigilia_ of the Romans. The  Custom of _Wakes_ at burials (_les vigiles des morts_) is at this  moment, in many parts, not discontinued.    \"But, at the antient _Yule_ (or Christmas time, especially), the  dreariness of the weather, the length of the night, would naturally  require something extraordinary, to wake and rouse men from their  natural inclination to rest, and to a warm bed, at that hour. The  summons, then, to the _Wakes_ of that season were given by music,  going the rounds of invitation to the mirth or festivals which were  awaiting them. In this there was some propriety, some object; but  where is there any in such a solemn piece of banter as that of music  going the rounds and disturbing people in vain? For, surely, any  meditation to be thereby excited on the holiness of the ensuing day  could hardly be of great avail, in a bed, between sleeping and waking.  But such is the power of custom to perpetuate absurdities.    \"However, the music was called _The Wakeths_, and, by the usual  tendency of language to euphony, softened into _Waits_, as _workth_  into _wort_, or _checkths_ into _chess_, etc.\"    Another authority, Jones, in his _Welsh Bards_, 1794, says: \"Waits are  musicians of the lower order, who commonly perform on Wind  instruments, and they play in most towns under the windows of the  chief inhabitants, at midnight, a short time before Christmas; for  which they collect a Christmas box, from house to house. They are said  to derive their name of _Waits_, for being always in waiting to  celebrate weddings and other joyous events happening within their  district. There is a building at Newcastle called _Waits' Tower_,  which was, formerly, the meeting-house of the town band of musicians.\"    The town waits certainly existed in Westminster as late as 1822, and  they were elected by the Court of Burgesses of that city--_vide_ a  magazine cutting of that date: \"_Christmas Waits_.--Charles Clapp,  Benjamin Jackson, Denis Jelks, and Robert Prinset, were brought to Bow  Street Office by O. Bond, the constable, charged with performing on  several musical instruments in St. Martin's Lane, at half-past twelve  o'clock this morning, by Mr. Munroe, the authorized principal Wait,  appointed by the Court of Burgesses for the City and Liberty of  Westminster, who alone considers himself entitled, by his appointment,  to apply for Christmas boxes. He also urged that the prisoners, acting  as Minstrels, came under the meaning of the Vagrant Act, alluded to in  the 17th Geo. II.; however, on reference to the last Vagrant Act of  the present king, the word 'minstrels' is omitted; consequently, they  are no longer cognizable under that Act of Parliament; and, in  addition to that, Mr. Charles Clapp, one of the prisoners, produced  his indenture of having served seven years as an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19980"],[0,"A Joy For Ever (and Its Price in the Market) (#15)"],[1,"led to dwell on this worldly and wealthy eminence as the main  thing to be reached by his art; if he finds that he is not gradually  rising towards it, he thinks there is something wrong in his work; or,  if he is too proud to think that, still the bribe of wealth and honour  warps him from his honest labour into efforts to attract attention; and  he gradually loses both his power of mind and his rectitude of purpose.  This, according to the degree of avarice or ambition which exists in any  painter's mind, is the necessary influence upon him of the hope of great  wealth and reputation. But the harm is still greater, in so far as the  possibility of attaining fortune of this kind tempts people continually  to become painters who have no real gift for the work; and on whom these  motives of mere worldly interest have exclusive influence;--men who  torment and abuse the patient workers, eclipse or thrust aside all  delicate and good pictures by their own gaudy and coarse ones, corrupt  the taste of the public, and do the greatest amount of mischief to the  schools of art in their day which it is possible for their capacities to  effect; and it is quite wonderful how much mischief may be done even by  small capacity. If you could by any means succeed in keeping the prices  of pictures down, you would throw all these disturbers out of the way at  once.      98. You may perhaps think that this severe treatment would do more harm  than good, by withdrawing the wholesome element of emulation, and giving  no stimulus to exertion; but I am sorry to say that artists will always  be sufficiently jealous of one another, whether you pay them large or  low prices; and as for stimulus to exertion, believe me, no good work in  this world was ever done for money, nor while the slightest thought of  money affected the painter's mind. Whatever idea of pecuniary value  enters into his thoughts as he works, will, in proportion to the  distinctness of its presence, shorten his power. A real painter will  work for you exquisitely, if you give him, as I told you a little while  ago, bread and water and salt; and a bad painter will work badly and  hastily, though you give him a palace to live in, and a princedom to  live upon. Turner got, in his earlier years, half a crown a day and his  supper (not bad pay, neither); and he learned to paint upon that. And I  believe that there is no chance of art's truly flourishing in any  country, until you make it a simple and plain business, providing its  masters with an easy competence, but rarely with anything more. And I  say this, not because I despise the great painter, but because I honour  him; and I should no more think of adding to his respectability or  happiness by giving him riches, than, if Shakespeare or Milton were  alive, I should think we added to _their_ respectability, or were likely  to get better work from them, by making them millionaires.      99. But, observe, it is not only the painter himself whom you injure, by  giving him too high prices; you injure all the inferior painters of the  day. If they are modest, they will be discouraged and depressed by the  feeling that their doings are worth so little, comparatively, in your  eyes;--if proud, all their worst passions will be aroused, and the  insult or opprobrium which they will try to cast on their successful  rival will not only afflict and wound him, but at last sour and harden  him: he cannot pass through such a trial without grievous harm.      100. That, then, is the effect you produce on the painter of mark, and  on the inferior ones of his own standing. But you do worse than this;  you deprive yourselves, by what you give for the fashionable picture, of  the power of helping the younger men who are coming forward. Be it  admitted, for argument's sake, if you are not convinced by what I have  said, that you do no harm to the great man by paying him well; yet  certainly you do him no special good. His reputation is established, and  his fortune made; he does not care whether you buy or not; he thinks he  is rather doing you a favour than otherwise by letting you have one of  his pictures at all. All the good you do him is to help him to buy a new  pair of carriage horses; whereas, with that same sum which thus you cast  away, you might have relieved the hearts and preserved the health of  twenty young painters; and if, among those twenty, you but chanced on  one in whom a true latent power had been hindered by his poverty, just  consider what a far-branching, far-embracing good you have wrought with  that lucky expenditure of yours. I say, \"Consider it,\" in vain; you  cannot consider it, for you cannot conceive the sickness of heart with  which a young painter of deep feeling toils through his first  obscurity;--his sense of the strong voice within him, which you will not  hear;--his vain, fond, wondering witness to the things you will not  see;--his far-away perception of things that he could accomplish if he  had but peace, and time, all unapproachable and vanishing from him,  because no one will leave him peace or grant him time: all his friends  falling back from him; those whom he would most reverently obey rebuking  and paralysing him; and, last and worst of all, those who believe in him  the most faithfully suffering by him the most bitterly;--the wife's  eyes, in their sweet ambition, shining brighter as the cheek wastes  away; and the little lips at his side parched and pale, which one day,  he knows, though he may never see it, will quiver so proudly when they  call his name, calling him \"our father.\" You deprive yourselves, by your  large expenditure for pictures of mark, of the power of relieving and  redeeming _this_ distress; you injure the painter whom you pay so  largely;--and what, after all, have you done for yourselves or got for  yourselves? It does not in the least follow that the hurried work of a  fashionable painter will contain more for your money than the quiet work  of some unknown man. In all probability, you will find, if you rashly  purchase what is popular at a high price, that you have got one picture  you don't care for, for a sum which would have bought twenty you would  have delighted in.      101. For remember always, that the price of a picture by a living artist  never represents, never _can_ represent, the quantity of labour or value  in it. Its price represents, for the most part, the degree of desire  which the rich people of the country have to possess it. Once get the  wealthy classes to imagine that the possession of pictures by a given  artist adds to their \"gentility,\" and there is no price which his work  may not immediately reach, and for years maintain; and in buying at that  price, you are not getting value for your money, but merely disputing  for victory in a contest of ostentation. And it is hardly possible to  spend your money in a worse or more wasteful way; for though you may not  be doing it for ostentation yourself, you are, by your pertinacity,  nourishing the ostentation of others; you meet them in their game of  wealth, and continue it for them; if they had not found an opposite  player, the game would have been done; for a proud man can find no  enjoyment in possessing himself of what nobody disputes with him. So  that by every farthing you give for a picture beyond its fair  price--that is to say, the price which will pay the painter for his  time--you are not only cheating yourself and buying vanity, but you are  stimulating the vanity of others; paying, literally, for the cultivation  of pride. You may consider every pound that you spend above the just  price of a work of art, as an investment in a cargo of mental quick-lime  or guano, which, being laid on the fields of human nature, is to grow a  harvest of pride. You are in fact ploughing and harrowing, in a most  valuable part of your land, in order to reap the whirlwind; you are  setting your hand stoutly to Job's agriculture--\"Let thistles grow  instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley.\"      102. Well, but you will say, there is one advantage in high prices,  which more than counter-balances all this mischief, namely, that by  great reward we both urge and enable a painter to produce rather one  perfect picture than many inferior ones: and one perfect picture (so you  tell us, and we believe it) is worth a great number of inferior ones.    It is so; but you cannot get it by paying for it. A great work is only  done when the painter gets into the humour for it, likes his subject,  and determines to paint it as well as he can, whether he is paid for it  or not; but bad work, and generally the worst sort of bad work, is done  when he is trying to produce a showy picture, or one that shall appear  to have as much labour in it as shall be worth a high price.[13]    [Note 13: When this lecture was delivered, I gave here some data for  approximate estimates of the average value of good modern pictures of  different classes; but the subject is too complicated to be adequately  treated in writing, without introducing more detail than the reader will  have patience for. But I may state, roughly, that prices above a hundred  guineas are in general extravagant for water-colours, and above five  hundred for oils. An artist almost always does wrong who puts more work  than these prices will remunerate him for into any single canvas--his  talent would be better employed in painting two pictures than one so  elaborate. The water-colour painters also are getting into the habit of  making their drawings too large, and in a measure attaching their price  rather to breadth and extent of touch than to thoughtful labour. Of  course marked exceptions occur here and there, as in the case of John  Lewis, whose drawings are wrought with unfailing precision throughout,  whatever their scale. Hardly any price can be remunerative for such  work.]      103. There is, however, another point, and a still more"]]]
