Therefore We restrained the Pen for a  considerable lapse of time in accordance with divine wisdom and for the  sake of protecting the faithful from those who have bartered away heavenly  blessings for disbelief and have chosen for their people the abode of  perdition.(31)    O thou seeker who art gifted with keen insight. I swear by Him Who  attracted the Concourse on High through the potency of His most sublime  Word! Verily, the birds abiding within the domains of My Kingdom and the  doves dwelling in the rose-garden of My wisdom utter such melodies and  warblings as are inscrutable to all but God, the Lord of the kingdoms of  earth and heaven; and were these melodies to be revealed even to an extent  smaller than a needle's eye, the people of tyranny would utter such  calumnies as none among former generations hath ever uttered, and would  commit such deeds as no one in past ages and centuries hath ever  committed. They have rejected the bounty of God and His proofs and have  repudiated the testimony of God and His signs. They have gone astray and  have caused the people to go astray, yet perceive it not. They worship  vain imaginings but know it not. They have taken idle fancies for their  lords and have neglected God, yet understand not. They have abandoned the  most great Ocean and are hastening towards the pool, but comprehend not.  They follow their own idle fancies while turning aside from God, the Help  in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.    Say, by the righteousness of God! The All-Merciful is come invested with  power and sovereignty. Through His power the foundations of religions have  quaked and the Nightingale of Utterance hath warbled its melody upon the  highest branch of true understanding. Verily, He Who was hidden in the  knowledge of God and is mentioned in the Holy Scriptures hath appeared.  Say, this is the Day when the Speaker on Sinai hath mounted the throne of  Revelation and the people have stood before the Lord of the worlds. This  is the Day wherein the earth hath told out her tidings and hath laid bare  her treasures; when the oceans have brought forth their pearls and the  divine Lote-Tree its fruit; when the Sun hath shed its radiance and the  Moons have diffused their lights, and the Heavens have revealed their  stars, and the Hour its signs, and the Resurrection its dreadful majesty;  when the pens have unloosed their outpourings and the spirits have laid  bare their mysteries. Blessed is the man who recognizeth Him and attaineth  His presence, and woe betide such as deny Him and turn aside from Him. I  beseech God to aid His servants to return unto Him. Verily He is the  Pardoner, the Forgiving, the Merciful.    O thou who hast set thy face towards the Realm on High and hast quaffed My  sealed wine from the hand of bounteousness! Know thou that the term  'Infallibility' hath numerous meanings and divers stations. In one sense  it is applicable to the One Whom God hath made immune from error.  Similarly it is applied to every soul whom God hath guarded against sin,  transgression, rebellion, impiety, disbelief and the like. However, the  Most Great Infallibility is confined to the One Whose station is  immeasurably exalted beyond ordinances or prohibitions and is sanctified  from errors and omissions. Indeed He is a Light which is not followed by  darkness and a Truth not overtaken by error. Were He to pronounce water to  be wine or heaven to be earth or light to be fire, He speaketh the truth  and no doubt would there be about it; and unto no one is given the right  to question His authority or to say why or wherefore. Whosoever raiseth  objections will be numbered with the froward in the Book of God, the Lord  of the worlds. 'Verily He shall not be asked of His doings but all others  shall be asked of their doings.'(32) He is come from the invisible heaven,  bearing the banner 'He doeth whatsoever He willeth' and is accompanied by  hosts of power and authority while it is the duty of all besides Him to  strictly observe whatever laws and ordinances have been enjoined upon  them, and should anyone deviate therefrom, even to the extent of a hair's  breadth, his work would be brought to naught.    Consider thou and call to mind the time when Muhammad appeared. He said,  and His word is the truth: 'Pilgrimage to the House(33) is a service due  to God.'(34) And likewise are the daily prayer, fasting, and the laws  which shone forth above the horizon of the Book of God, the Lord of the  World and the true Educator of the peoples and kindreds of the earth. It  is incumbent upon everyone to obey Him in whatsoever God hath ordained;  and whosoever denieth Him hath disbelieved in God, in His verses, in His  Messengers and in His Books. Were He to pronounce right to be wrong or  denial to be belief, He speaketh the truth as bidden by God. This is a  station wherein sins or trespasses neither exist nor are mentioned.  Consider thou the blessed, the divinely-revealed verse in which pilgrimage  to the House is enjoined upon everyone. It devolved upon those invested  with authority after Him(35) to observe whatever had been prescribed unto  them in the Book. Unto no one is given the right to deviate from the laws  and ordinances of God. Whoso deviateth therefrom is reckoned with the  trespassers in the Book of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.    O thou who hast fixed thy gaze upon the Dawning-Place of the Cause of God!  Know thou for a certainty that the Will of God is not limited by the  standards of the people, and God doth not tread in their ways. Rather is  it incumbent upon everyone to firmly adhere to God's straight Path. Were  He to pronounce the right to be the left or the south to be the north, He  speaketh the truth and there is no doubt of it. Verily He is to be praised  in His acts and to be obeyed in His behests. He hath no associate in His  judgement nor any helper in His sovereignty. He doeth whatsoever He  willeth and ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth. Know thou moreover that all  else besides Him have been created through the potency of a word from His  presence, while of themselves they have no motion nor stillness, except at  His bidding and by His leave.    O thou who soarest in the atmosphere of love and fellowship and hast fixed  thy gaze upon the light of the countenance of thy Lord, the King of  creation! Render thanks unto God, inasmuch as He hath unravelled for thee  that which was hidden and enshrined in His knowledge so that everyone may  become aware that within His realm of supreme infallibility He hath not  taken a partner nor a counsellor unto Himself. He is in truth the  Dayspring of divine precepts and commandments and the Fountainhead of  knowledge and wisdom, while all else besides Him are but His subjects and  under His rule, and He is the supreme Ruler, the Ordainer, the  All-Knowing, the All-Informed.    As to thyself, whenever thou art enraptured by the vitalizing breaths of  the revealed verses and art carried away by the pure, life-giving water  proffered by the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the sovereign Ruler of  the Day of Resurrection, lift up thy voice and say:    O my God! O my God! I yield Thee thanks that Thou hast directed me towards  Thyself, hast guided me unto Thy horizon, hast clearly set forth for me  Thy Path, hast revealed to me Thy testimony and enabled me to set my face  towards Thee, while most of the doctors and divines among Thy servants  together with such as follow them have, without the least proof or  evidence from Thee, turned away from Thee. Blessing be unto Thee, O Lord  of Names, and glory be unto Thee, O Creator of the heavens, inasmuch as  Thou hast, through the power of Thy Name, the Self-Subsisting, given me to  drink of Thy sealed wine, hast caused me to draw nigh unto Thee and hast  enabled me to recognize the Dayspring of Thine utterance, the  Manifestation of Thy signs, the Fountainhead of Thy laws and commandments  and the Source of Thy wisdom and bestowals. Blessed is the land that hath  been ennobled by Thy footsteps, wherein the throne of Thy sovereignty is  established and the fragrance of Thy raiment is diffused. By Thy glory and  majesty, by Thy might and power, I desire not my sight save to behold Thy  beauty, nor my hearing save to hearken to Thy call and Thy verses.    O my God! O my God! Debar not the eyes from that for which Thou hast  created them, nor the faces from turning to Thy horizon, or from paying  homage at the portals of Thy majesty, or from appearing in the presence of  Thy throne, or from bowing down before the splendours of the Day-Star of  Thy bounty.    I am the one, O Lord, whose heart and soul, whose limbs, whose inner and  outer tongue testify to Thy unity and Thy oneness, and bear witness that  Thou art God and that there is no God but Thee. Thou didst bring mankind  into being to know Thee and to serve Thy Cause, that their station might  thereby be elevated upon Thine earth and their souls be uplifted by virtue  of the things Thou hast revealed in Thy Scriptures, Thy Books and Thy  Tablets. Yet no sooner didst Thou manifest Thyself and reveal Thy signs  than they turned away from Thee and repudiated Thee and rejected that  which Thou didst unveil before their eyes through the potency of Thy might  and Thy power. They rose up to inflict harm upon Thee, to extinguish Thy  light and to put out the flame that blazeth in Thy Burning Bush. Their  iniquity waxed so grievous that they conspired to shed Thy blood and to  violate Thy honour. And likewise acted he(36) whom Thou hadst nurtured  with the hand of Thy loving-kindness, hadst protected from the mischief of  the rebellious among Thy creatures and the froward amidst Thy servants,  and whom Thou hadst set the task of writing Thy holy verses before Thy  throne.    Alas! Alas! for the things he perpetrated in Thy days to such an extent  that he violated Thy Covenant and Thy Testament, rejected Thy holy Writ,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17314"],[0,"Five Children and It (#15)"],[1," The shadow of the church-tower fell across the churchyard, and across  the Vicarage, and across the field beyond; and presently there were no  more shadows, and the sun had set, and the wings were gone. And still  the children slept. But not for long. Twilight is very beautiful, but it  is chilly; and you know, however sleepy you are, you wake up soon enough  if your brother or sister happens to be up first and pulls your blankets  off you. The four wingless children shivered and woke. And there they  were,--on the top of a church-tower in the dusky twilight, with blue  stars coming out by ones and twos and tens and twenties over their  heads,--miles away from home, with three shillings and three-halfpence  in their pockets, and a doubtful act about the necessities of life to  be accounted for if anyone found them with the soda-water syphon.    They looked at each other. Cyril spoke first, picking up the syphon--    \"We'd better get along down and get rid of this beastly thing. It's dark  enough to leave it on the clergyman's doorstep, I should think. Come  on.\"    There was a little turret at the corner of the tower, and the little  turret had a door in it. They had noticed this when they were eating,  but had not explored it, as you would have done in their place. Because,  of course, when you have wings and can explore the whole sky, doors seem  hardly worth exploring.    Now they turned towards it.    \"Of course,\" said Cyril \"this is the way down.\"    It was. But the door was locked on the inside!    And the world was growing darker and darker. And they were miles from  home. And there was the soda-water syphon.    I shall not tell you whether anyone cried, nor, if so, how many cried,  nor who cried. You will be better employed in making up your minds what  you would have done if you had been in their place.          CHAPTER V    NO WINGS      Whether anyone cried or not, there was certainly an interval during  which none of the party was quite itself. When they grew calmer, Anthea  put her handkerchief in her pocket and her arm round Jane, and said--    \"It can't be for more than one night. We can signal with our  handkerchiefs in the morning. They'll be dry then. And someone will come  up and let us out\"--    \"And find the syphon,\" said Cyril gloomily; \"and we shall be sent to  prison for stealing\"--    \"You said it wasn't stealing. You said you were sure it wasn't.\"    \"I'm not sure _now_\" said Cyril shortly.    \"Let's throw the thing away among the trees,\" said Robert, \"then no one  can do anything to us.\"    \"Oh yes,\"--Cyril's laugh was not a light-hearted one,--\"and hit some  chap on the head, and be murderers as well as--as the other thing.\"    \"But we can't stay up here all night,\" said Jane; \"and I want my tea.\"    \"You _can't_ want your tea,\" said Robert; \"you've only just had your  dinner.\"    \"But I _do_ want it,\" she said; \"especially when you begin talking about  stopping up here all night. Oh, Panther--I want to go home! I want to go  home!\"    \"Hush, hush,\" Anthea said. \"Don't, dear. It'll be all right, somehow.  Don't, don't\"--    \"Let her cry,\" said Robert desperately; \"if she howls loud enough,  someone may hear and come and let us out.\"    \"And see the soda-water thing,\" said Anthea swiftly. \"Robert, don't be a  brute. Oh, Jane, do try to be a man! It's just the same for all of us.\"    Jane did try to \"be a man\"--and reduced her howls to sniffs.    There was a pause. Then Cyril said slowly, \"Look here. We must risk that  syphon. I'll button it up inside my jacket--perhaps no one will notice  it. You others keep well in front of me. There are lights in the  clergyman's house. They've not gone to bed yet. We must just yell as  loud as ever we can. Now all scream when I say three. Robert, you do the  yell like a railway engine, and I'll do the coo-ee like father's. The  girls can do as they please. One, two, three!\"    A four-fold yell rent the silent peace of the evening, and a maid at one  of the Vicarage windows paused with her hand on the blind-cord.    \"One, two, three!\" Another yell, piercing and complex, startled the owls  and starlings to a flutter of feathers in the belfry below. The maid  flew from the Vicarage window and ran down the Vicarage stairs and into  the Vicarage kitchen, and fainted as soon as she had explained to the  man-servant and the cook and the cook's cousin that she had seen a  ghost. It was quite untrue, of course, but I suppose the girl's nerves  were a little upset by the yelling.    \"One, two, three!\" The Vicar was on his doorstep by this time, and there  was no mistaking the yell that greeted him.    \"Goodness me,\" he said to his wife, \"my dear, someone's being murdered  in the church! Give me my hat and a thick stick, and tell Andrew to come  after me. I expect it's the lunatic who stole the tongue.\"    The children had seen the flash of light when the Vicar opened his front  door. They had seen his dark form on his doorstep, and they had paused  for breath, and also to see what he would do.    When he turned back for his hat, Cyril said hastily--    \"He thinks he only fancied he heard something. You don't half yell! Now!  One, two, three!\"    It was certainly a whole yell this time, and the Vicar's wife flung her  arms round her husband and screamed a feeble echo of it.    \"You shan't go!\" she said, \"not alone. Jessie!\"--the maid unfainted and  came out of the kitchen,--\"send Andrew at once. There's a dangerous  lunatic in the church, and he must go immediately and catch him.\"    \"I expect he _will_ catch it too,\" said Jessie to herself as she went  through the kitchen door. \"Here, Andrew,\" she said, \"there's someone  screaming like mad in the church, and the missus says you're to go along  and catch it.\"    \"Not alone, I don't,\" said Andrew in low firm tones. To his master he  merely said, \"Yis sir.\"    \"You heard those screams?\"    \"I did think I noticed a sort of something,\" said Andrew.    \"Well, come on, then,\" said the Vicar. \"My dear, I _must_ go!\" He pushed  her gently into the sitting-room, banged the door, and rushed out,  dragging Andrew by the arm.    A volley of yells greeted them. Then as it died into silence Andrew  shouted, \"Hullo, you there! Did you call?\"    \"Yes,\" shouted four far-away voices.    \"They seem to be in the air,\" said the Vicar. \"Very remarkable.\"    \"Where are you?\" shouted Andrew; and Cyril replied in his deepest  voice, very slow and loud--    \"CHURCH! TOWER! TOP!\"    \"Come down, then!\" said Andrew; and the same voice replied--    \"_Can't! Door locked!_\"    \"My goodness!\" said the Vicar. \"Andrew, fetch the stable lantern.  Perhaps it would be as well to fetch another man from the village.\"    \"With the rest of the gang about, very likely. No, sir; if this 'ere  ain't a trap--well, may I never! There's cook's cousin at the back door  now. He's a keeper, sir, and used to dealing with vicious characters.  And he's got his gun, sir.\"    \"Hullo there!\" shouted Cyril from the church-tower; \"come up and let us  out.\"    \"We're a-coming,\" said Andrew. \"I'm a-going to get a policeman and a  gun.\"    \"Andrew, Andrew,\" said the Vicar, \"that's not the truth.\"    \"It's near enough, sir, for the likes of them.\"    So Andrew fetched the lantern and the cook's cousin; and the Vicar's  wife begged them all to be very careful.    They went across the churchyard--it was quite dark now--and as they went  they talked. The Vicar was certain a lunatic was on the  church-tower--the one who had written the mad letter, and taken the cold  tongue and things. Andrew thought it was a \"trap\"; the cook's cousin  alone was calm. \"Great cry, little wool,\" said he; \"dangerous chaps is  quieter.\" He was not at all afraid. But then he had a gun. That was why  he was asked to lead the way up the worn, steep, dark steps of the  church-tower. He did lead the way, with the lantern in one hand and the  gun in the other. Andrew went next. He pretended afterwards that this  was because he was braver than his master, but really it was because he  thought of traps and he did not like the idea of being behind the others  for fear someone should come softly up behind him and catch hold of his  legs in the dark. They went on and on, and round and round the little  corkscrew staircase--then through the bell-ringers' loft, where the  bell-ropes hung with soft furry ends like giant caterpillars--then up  another stair into the belfry, where the big quiet bells are--and then  on up a ladder with broad steps--and then up a little stone stair. And  at the top of that there was a little door. And the door was bolted on  the stair side.    The cook's cousin, who was a gamekeeper, kicked at the door, and said--    \"Hullo, you there!\"    The children were holding on to each other on the other side of the  door, and trembling with anxiousness--and very hoarse with their howls.  They could hardly speak, but Cyril managed to reply huskily--    \"Hullo, you there!\"    \"How did you get up there?\"    It was no use saying \"We flew up,\" so Cyril said--    \"We got up--and then we found the door was locked and we couldn't get  down. Let us out--do.\"    \"How many of you are there?\" asked the keeper.    \"Only four,\" said Cyril.    \"Are you armed?\"    \"Are we what?\"    \"I've got my gun handy--so you'd best not try any tricks,\" said the  keeper. \"If we open the door, will you promise to come quietly down, and  no nonsense?\"    \"Yes--oh YES!\" said all the children together.    \"Bless me,\" said the Vicar, \"surely that was a female voice?\"    \"Shall I open the door, sir?\" said the keeper. Andrew went down a few  steps, \"to leave room for the others\" he said afterwards.    \"Yes,\" said the Vicar, \"open the door. Remember,\" he said through the  keyhole, \"we have come to release you. You will keep your promise to  refrain from violence?\"    \"How this bolt do stick,\" said the keeper; \"anyone 'ud think it hadn't  been drawed for half a year.\" As a matter of fact it hadn't.    When all the bolts"]]]
