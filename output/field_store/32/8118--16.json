[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18613"],[0,"The Golden Scorpion (#15)"],[1,"! it was a very fragile thread, but by following such a thread as  this we are sometimes led to the heart of a labyrinth.    Beyond wondering if some sinister chain bound together this series of  apparently natural deaths I might have made no move in the matter, but  something occurred which spurred me to action. Sir Frank Narcombe, the  great English surgeon, collapsed in the foyer of a London theatre and  died shortly afterwards. Here again I perceived a case of a notable  man succumbing unexpectedly in a public place--a case parallel to that  of the Grand Duke, of Ericksen, of Van Rembold! it seemed as though  some strange epidemic had attacked men of science--yes! they were all  men of science, even including the Grand Duke, who was said to be the  most scientific soldier in Europe, and the admiral, who had perfected  the science of submarine warfare.    \"The Scorpion!\" ... that name haunted me persistently. So much so that  at last I determined to find out for myself if Sir Frank Narcombe had  ever spoken about a scorpion or if there was any evidence to show that  he had been interested in the subject.    I could not fail to remember, too, that Zara el-Khala had last been  reported as crossing to England.          CHAPTER IV    THE FIGHT IN THE CAFE      New Scotland Yard had been advised that any reference to a scorpion,  in whatever form it occurred, should be noted and followed up, but  nothing had resulted and as a matter of fact I was not surprised in  the least. All that I had learned--and this was little enough--I had  learned more or less by accident. But I came to the conclusion that a  visit to London might be advisable.    I had caused a watch to be kept upon the man Miguel, whose  establishment seemed to be a recognized resort of shady characters.  I had no absolute proof, remember, that he knew anything of the  private affairs of the Hindu, and no further reference to a scorpion  had been made by anyone using the cafe telephone. Nevertheless I  determined to give him a courtesy call before leaving for London ...   and to this determination I cannot doubt that once again I was led  by providence.    Attired in a manner calculated to enable me to pass unnoticed among  the patrons of the establishment, I entered the place and ordered  cognac. Miguel having placed it before me, I lighted a cigarette and  surveyed my surroundings.    Eight or nine men were in the cafe, and two women. Four of the men  were playing cards at a corner table, and the others were distributed  about the place, drinking and smoking. The women, who were flashily  dressed but who belonged to that order of society which breeds the  Apache, were deep in conversation with a handsome Algerian. I  recognized only one face in the cafe--that of a dangerous character,  Jean Sach, who had narrowly escaped the electric chair in the United  States and who was well known to the Bureau. He was smiling at one of  the two women--the woman to whom the Algerian seemed to be more  particularly addressing himself.    Another there was in the cafe who interested me as a student of  physiognomy--a dark, bearded man, one of the card-players. His face  was disfigured by a purple scar extending from his brow to the left  corner of his mouth, which it had drawn up into a permanent snarl,  so that he resembled an enraged and dangerous wild animal. Mentally  I classified this person as \"Le Balafre.\"    I had just made up my mind to depart when the man Sach arose, crossed  the cafe and seated himself insolently between the Algerian and the  woman to whom the latter was talking. Turning his back upon the brown  man, he addressed some remark to the woman, at the same time leering  in her face.    Women of this class are difficult, you understand? Sach received from  the lady a violent blow upon the face which rolled him on the floor!  As he fell, the Algerian sprang up and drew a knife. Sach rolled away   from him and also reached for the knife which he carried in a  hip-pocket.    Before he could draw it, Miguel, the quadroon proprietor, threw  himself upon him and tried to pitch him into the street. But Sach,  although a small man, was both agile and ferocious. He twisted out of  the grasp of the huge quadroon and turned, raising the knife. As he  did so, the Algerian deftly kicked it from his grasp and left Sach to  face Miguel unarmed. Screaming with rage, he sprang at Miguel's throat,  and the tow fell writhing upon the floor.    There could only be one end to such a struggle, of course, as the  Algerian recognized by replacing his knife in his pocket and resuming  his seat. Miguel obtained a firm hold upon Sacah and raised him bodily  above his head, as one has seen a professional weight-lifter raise a  heavy dumb-bell. Thus he carried him, kicking and foaming at the mouth  with passion, to the open door. From the step he threw him into the  middle of the street.    At this moment I observed something glittering upon the floor close to  the chair occupied by the Algerian. Standing up--for I had determined  to depart--I crossed in that direction, stooped and picked  up this  object which glittered. As my fingers touched it, so did my heart give  a great leap.    The object was a _golden scorpion!_    Forgetful of my dangerous surroundings I stood looking at the golden  ornament in my hand ... when suddenly and violently it was snatched  from me! The Algerian, his brown face convulsed with rage,  confronted me.    \"Where did you find that charm?\" he cried. \"It belongs to me.\"    \"Very well,\" I replied--\"you have it.\"    He glared at me with a ferocity which the incident scarcely seemed to  merit and exchanged a significant glance with someone who had  approached and who now stood behind me. Turning, I met a second black  gaze--that of the quadroon who having restored order had returned from  the cafe door and now stood regarding me. \"Did you find it on the  floor?\" asked Miguel suspiciously.    \"I did.\"    He turned to the Algerian.    \"It fell when you kicked the knife from the hand of that pig,\" he  said. \"You should be more careful.\"    Again they exchanged significant glances, but the Algerian resumed  his seat and Miguel went behind the counter. I left the cafe  conscious of the fact that black looks pursued me.    The night was very dark, and as I came out on to the pavement someone  touched me on the arm. I turned in a flash.    \"Walk on, friend,\" said the voice of Jean Sach. \"What was it that you  picked up from the floor?\"    \"A golden scorpion,\" I answered quickly.    \"Ah!\" he whispered--\"I thought so! It is enough. They shall pay for  what they have done to me--those two. Hurry, friend, as I do.\"    Before I could say another word or strive to detain him, he turned  and ran off along a narrow courtway which at this point branched from  the street.    I stood for a moment, nonplussed, staring after him. By good fortune  I had learned more in ten minutes than by the exercise of all my  ingenuity and the resources of the Service I could have learned in  ten months! _Par al barbe du prophete_ the Kismet which dogs the  footsteps of malefactors assisted me!    Recollecting the advice of Jean Sach, I set off at a brisk pace along  the street, which was dark and deserted and which passed through a  district marked red on the Paris crimes-map. Arriving at the corner,  above which projected a lamp, I paused and glanced back into the  darkness. I could see no one, but I thought I could detect the sound  of stealthy footsteps following me.    The suspicion was enough. I quickened my pace, anxious to reach the  crowded boulevard upon which this second street opened. I reached it  unmolested, but intending to throw any pursuer off the track, I dodged  and doubled repeatedly on the way to my flat and arrived there about  midnight, convinced that I had eluded pursuit--if indeed I had been  pursued.    All my arrangements were made for leaving Paris, and now I telephoned  to the assistant on duty in my office, instructing him to take certain  steps in regard to the proprietor of the cafe and the Algerian and to  find the hiding-place of the man Jean-Sach. I counted it more than  ever important that I should go to London at once.    In this belief I was confirmed at the very moment that I boarded the  Channel steamer at Boulogne: for as I stepped upon the deck I found  myself face to face with a man who was leaning upon the rail and  apparently watching the passengers coming on board. He was a man of  heavy build, dark and bearded, and his face was strangely familiar.    Turning, as I lighted a cigarette, I glanced back at him in order to  obtain a view of his profile. I knew him instantly--for now the scar  was visible. It was \"Le Balafre\" who had been playing cards in  Miguel's cafe on the previous night!    I have sometimes been criticised, especially by my English confreres,  for my faith in disguise. I have been told that no disguise is  impenetrable to the trained eye. I reply that there are many disguises  but few trained eyes! To my faith in disguise I owed the knowledge  that a golden scorpion was the token of some sort of gang, society, or  criminal group, and to this same faith which an English inspector of  police once assured me to be a misplaced one I owed, on boarding the  steamer, my escape from detection by this big bearded fellow who was  possibly looking out for me!    Yet, I began to wonder if after all I had escaped the shadowy pursuer  whose presence I had suspected in the dark street outside the cafe or  if he had tracked me and learned my real identity. In any event, the  roles were about to be reversed! \"Le Balafre\" at Folkestone took a seat  in a third-class carriage of the London train. I took one in the next  compartment.    Arrived at Charing Cross, he stood for a time in the booking-hall,  glanced at his watch, and then took up the handbag which he carried  and walked out into the station yard. I walked out also.    \"Le"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18637"],[0,"The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation (#15)"],[1," have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the  Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have  directed.
