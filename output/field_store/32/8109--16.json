One of these occurs where it is important to draw attention to  the condition, as something doubtful or especially requiring  examination. _If there is a resisting medium in space, the earth will  fall into the sun; If the Corn Laws are to be re-enacted, we had better  sell railways and buy land_: here the hypothetical form draws attention  to the questions whether there is a resisting medium in space, whether  the Corn Laws are likely to be re-enacted; but as to methods of  inference and proof, the hypothetical form has nothing to do with them.  The propositions predicate causation: _A resisting medium in space is a  condition of the earth's falling into the sun; A Corn Law is a condition  of the rise of rents, and of the fall of railway profits_.    A second case in which the hypothetical is a specially appropriate form  of statement occurs where a proposition relates to a particular matter  and to future time, as _If there be a storm to-morrow, we shall miss our  picnic_. Such cases are of very slight logical interest. It is as  exercises in formal thinking that hypotheticals are of most value;  inasmuch as many people find them more difficult than categoricals to  manipulate.    In discussing Conditional Propositions, the conditional sentence of a  Hypothetical, or the first alternative of a Disjunctive, is called the  Antecedent; the indicative sentence of a Hypothetical, or the second  alternative of a Disjunctive, is called the Consequent.    Hypotheticals, like Categoricals, have been classed according to  Quantity and Quality. Premising that the quantity of a Hypothetical  depends on the quantity of its Antecedent (which determines its  limitation), whilst its quality depends on the quality of its consequent  (which makes the predication), we may exhibit four forms:        A. _If A is B, C is D;_      I. _Sometimes when A is B, C is D;_      E. _If A is B, C is not D;_      O. _Sometimes when A is B, C is not D._    But I. and O. are rarely used.    As for Disjunctives, it is easy to distinguish the two quantities thus:        A. _Either A is B, or C is D;_      I. _Sometimes either A is B or C is D._    But I. is rarely used. The distinction of quality, however, cannot be  made: there are no true negative forms; for if we write--        _Neither is A B, nor C D,_    there is here no alternative predication, but only an Exponible  equivalent to _No A is B, and No C is D_. And if we write--        _Either A is not B, or C is not D,_    this is affirmative as to the alternation, and is for all methods of  treatment equivalent to A.    Logicians are divided in opinion as to the interpretation of the  conjunction 'either, or'; some holding that it means 'not both,' others  that it means 'it may be both.' Grammatical usage, upon which the  question is sometimes argued, does not seem to be established in favour  of either view. If we say _A man so precise in his walk and conversation  is either a saint or a consummate hypocrite_; or, again, _One who is  happy in a solitary life is either more or less than man_; we cannot in  such cases mean that the subject may be both. On the other hand, if it  be said that _the author of 'A Tale of a Tub' is either a misanthrope or  a dyspeptic_, the alternatives are not incompatible. Or, again, given  that _X. is a lunatic, or a lover, or a poet_, the three predicates have  much congruity.    It has been urged that in Logic, language should be made as exact and  definite as possible, and that this requires the exclusive  interpretation 'not both.' But it seems a better argument, that Logic  (1) should be able to express all meanings, and (2), as the science of  evidence, must not assume more than is given; to be on the safe side, it  must in doubtful cases assume the least, just as it generally assumes a  preindesignate term to be of particular quantity; and, therefore  'either, or' means 'one, or the other, or both.'    However, when both the alternative propositions have the same subject,  as _Either A is B, or A is C_, if the two predicates are contrary or  contradictory terms (as 'saint' and 'hypocrite,' or 'saint' and  'not-saint'), they cannot in their nature be predicable in the same way  of the same subject; and, therefore, in such a case 'either, or' means  one or the other, but not both in the same relation. Hence it seems  necessary to admit that the conjunction 'either, or' may sometimes  require one interpretation, sometimes the other; and the rule is that it  implies the further possibility 'or both,' except when both alternatives  have the same subject whilst the predicates are contrary or  contradictory terms.    If, then, the disjunctive _A is either B or C_ (_B_ and _C_ being  contraries) implies that both alternatives cannot be true, it can only  be adequately rendered in hypotheticals by the two forms--(1) _If A is  B, it is not C_, and (2)_If A is not B, it is C_. But if the disjunctive  _A is either B or C_ (_B_ and _C_ not being contraries) implies that  both may be true, it will be adequately translated into a hypothetical  by the single form, _If A is not B, it is C_. We cannot translate it  into--_If A is B, it is not C_, for, by our supposition, if '_A is B_'  is true, it does not follow that '_A is C_' must be false.    Logicians are also divided in opinion as to the function of the  hypothetical form. Some think it expresses doubt; for the consequent  depends on the antecedent, and the antecedent, introduced by 'if,' may  or may not be realised, as in _If the sky is clear, the night is cold_:  whether the sky is, or is not, clear being supposed to be uncertain. And  we have seen that some hypothetical propositions seem designed to draw  attention to such uncertainty, as--_If there is a resisting medium in  space_, etc. But other Logicians lay stress upon the connection of the  clauses as the important matter: the statement is, they say, that the  consequent may be inferred from the antecedent. Some even declare that  it is given as a necessary inference; and on this ground Sigwart rejects  particular hypotheticals, such as _Sometimes when A is B, C is D_; for  if it happens only sometimes the connexion cannot be necessary. Indeed,  it cannot even be probably inferred without further grounds. But this is  also true whenever the antecedent and consequent are concerned with  different matter. For example, _If the soul is simple, it is  indestructible_. How do you know that? Because _Every simple substance  is indestructible_. Without this further ground there can be no  inference. The fact is that conditional forms often cover assertions  that are not true complex propositions but a sort of euthymemes (chap.  xi. Sec. 2), arguments abbreviated and rhetorically disguised. Thus: _If  patience is a virtue there are painful virtues_--an example from Dr.  Keynes. Expanding this we have--          Patience is painful;        Patience is a virtue:      .'. Some virtue is painful.    And then we see the equivocation of the inference; for though patience  be painful _to learn_, it is not painful _as a virtue_ to the patient  man.    The hypothetical, '_If Plato was not mistaken poets are dangerous  citizens_,' may be considered as an argument against the laureateship,  and may be expanded (informally) thus: 'All Plato's opinions deserve  respect; one of them was that poets are bad citizens; therefore it  behoves us to be chary of encouraging poetry.' Or take this  disjunctive, '_Either Bacon wrote the works ascribed to Shakespeare, or  there were two men of the highest genius in the same age and country_.'  This means that it is not likely there should be two such men, that we  are sure of Bacon, and therefore ought to give him all the glory. Now,  if it is the part of Logic 'to make explicit in language all that is  implicit in thought,' or to put arguments into the form in which they  can best be examined, such propositions as the above ought to be  analysed in the way suggested, and confirmed or refuted according to  their real intention.    We may conclude that no single function can be assigned to all  hypothetical propositions: each must be treated according to its own  meaning in its own context.    Sec. 5. As to Modality, propositions are divided into Pure and Modal. A  Modal proposition is one in which the predicate is affirmed or denied,  not simply but _cum modo_, with a qualification. And some Logicians have  considered any adverb occurring in the predicate, or any sign of past or  future tense, enough to constitute a modal: as 'Petroleum is  _dangerously_ inflammable'; 'English _will be_ the universal language.'  But far the most important kind of modality, and the only one we need  consider, is that which is signified by some qualification of the  predicate as to the degree of certainty with which it is affirmed or  denied. Thus, 'The bite of the cobra is _probably_ mortal,' is called a  Contingent or Problematic Modal: 'Water is _certainly_ composed of  oxygen and hydrogen' is an Assertory or Certain Modal: 'Two straight  lines _cannot_ enclose a space' is a Necessary or Apodeictic Modal (the  opposite being inconceivable). Propositions not thus qualified are  called Pure.    Modal propositions have had a long and eventful history, but they have  not been found tractable by the resources of ordinary Logic, and are now  generally neglected by the authors of text-books. No doubt such  propositions are the commonest in ordinary discourse, and in some rough  way we combine them and draw inferences from them. It is understood  that a combination of assertory or of apodeictic premises may warrant an  assertory or an apodeictic conclusion; but that if we combine either of  these with a problematic premise our conclusion becomes problematic;  whilst the combination of two problematic premises gives a conclusion  less certain than either. But if we ask 'How much less certain?' there  is no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18444"],[0,"The Story of the Hymns and Tunes (#15)"],[1,"mn--the latter, perhaps, generally  preferred, being less plaintive and speaking with a surer and more  restful emphasis.      ROBERT SEAGRAVE.    \"Rise, My Soul, and Stretch Thy Wings.\"    This hymn was written early in the 18th century, by the Rev. Robert  Seagrave, born at Twyford, Leicestershire, Eng., Nov. 22, 1693. Educated  at Cambridge, he took holy orders in the Established Church, but  espoused the cause of the great evangelistic movement, and became a  hearty co-worker with the Wesleys. Judging by the lyric fire he could  evidently put into his verses, one involuntarily asks if he would not  have written more, and been in fact the song-leader of the spiritual  reformation if there had been no Charles Wesley. There is not a hymn of  Wesley's in use on the same subject equal to the one immortal hymn of  Seagrave, and the only other near its time that approaches it in vigor  and appealing power is Doddridge's \"Awake my soul, stretch every nerve.\"    But Providence gave Wesley the harp and appointed to the elder poet a  branch of possibly equal usefulness, where he was kept too busy to enter  the singers' ranks.    For eleven years he was the Sunday-evening lecturer at Lorimer's Hall,  London, and often preached in Whitefield's Tabernacle. His hymn is one  of the most soul-stirring in the English language:    [Illustration: S. Huntingdon]        Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings;        Thy better portion trace;      Rise from transitory things        Toward Heaven, thy native place;      Sun and moon and stars decay,        Time shall soon this earth remove;      Rise, my soul and haste away        To seats prepared above.        Rivers to the ocean run,        Nor stay in all their course;      Fire ascending seeks the sun;        Both speed them to their source:      So a soul that's born of God        Pants to view His glorious face,      Upward tends to His abode        To rest in His embrace.           *       *       *       *       *        Cease, ye pilgrims, cease to mourn,        Press onward to the prize;      Soon your Saviour will return        Triumphant in the skies.      Yet a season, and you know        Happy entrance will be given;      All our sorrows left below,        And earth exchanged for heaven.    This hymn must have found its predestinated organ when it found--      _THE TUNE._    \"Amsterdam,\" the work of James Nares, had its birth and baptism soon  after the work of Seagrave; and they have been breath and bugle to the  church of God ever since they became one song. In _The Great Musicians_,  edited by Francis Huffer, is found this account of James Nares:    \"He was born at Hanwell, Middlesex, in 1715; was admitted chorister at  the Chapel Royal, under Bernard Gates, and when he was able to play the  organ was appointed deputy for Pigott, of St. George's Chapel, Windsor,  and became organist at York Minster in 1734. He succeeded Greene as  organist and composer to the Chapel Royal in 1756, and in the same year  was made Doctor of Music at Cambridge. He was appointed master of the  children of the Chapel Royal in 1757, on the death of Gates. This post  he resigned in 1780, and he died in 1783, (February 10,) and was buried  in St. Margaret's Church, Westminster.    \"He had the reputation of being an excellent trainer of boy's voices,  many of his anthems having been written to exhibit the accomplishments  of his young pupils. The degree of excellence the boys attained was not  won in those days without the infliction of much corporal punishment.\"    Judging from the high pulse and action in the music of \"Amsterdam,\" one  would guess the energy of the man who made boy choirs--and made good  ones. In the old time the rule was, \"Birds that can sing and won't sing,  must be made to sing\"; and the rule was sometimes enforced with the  master's time-stick.    A tune entitled \"Excelsius,\" written a hundred years later by John Henry  Cornell, so nearly resembles \"Amsterdam\" as to suggest an intention to  amend it. It changes the modal note from G to A, but while it marches  at the same pace it lacks the jubilant modulations and the choral glory  of the 18th-century piece.      SIR JOHN BOWRING.    \"In the Cross of Christ I Glory.\"    In this hymn we see, sitting humbly at the feet of the great author of  our religion, a man who impressed himself perhaps more than any other  save Napoleon Bonaparte upon his own generation, and who was the wonder  of Europe for his immense attainments and the versatility of his powers.  Statesman, philanthropist, biographer, publicist, linguist, historian,  financier, naturalist, poet, political economist--there is hardly a  branch of knowledge or a field of research from which he did not enrich  himself and others, or a human condition that he did not study and  influence.    Sir John Bowring was born in 1792. When a youth he was Jeremy Bentham's  political pupil, but gained his first fame by his vast knowledge of  European literature, becoming acquainted with no less than thirteen[9]  continental languages and dialects. He served in consular appointments  at seven different capitals, carried important reform measures in  Parliament, was Minister Plenipotentiary to China and Governor of Hong  Kong, and concluded a commercial treaty with Siam, where every previous  commissioner had failed. But in all his crowded years the pen of this  tireless and successful man was busy. Besides his political, economic  and religious essays, which made him a member of nearly every learned  society in Europe, his translations were countless, and poems and hymns  of his own composing found their way to the public, among them the  tender spiritual song,--        How sweetly flowed the Gospel sound        From lips of gentleness and grace      When listening thousands gathered round,        And joy and gladness filled the place,    --and the more famous hymn indicated at the head of this sketch.  Knowledge of all religions only qualified him to worship the Crucified  with both faith and reason. Though nominally a Unitarian, to him, as to  Channing and Martineau and Edmund Sears, Christ was \"all we know of  God.\"    [Footnote 9: Exaggerated in some accounts to _forty_.]    Bowring died Nov. 23, 1872. But his hymn to the Cross will never die:        In the cross of Christ I glory,        Towering o'er the wrecks of time;      All the light of sacred story        Gathers round its head sublime.        When the woes of life o'ertake me        Hopes deceive, and fears annoy,      Never shall the cross forsake me;        Lo! it glows with peace and joy.        When the sun of bliss is beaming        Light and love upon my way,      From the cross the radiance streaming        Adds new lustre to the day.        Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure        By the cross are sanctified,      Peace is there that knows no measure,        Joys that through all time abide.      _THE TUNE._    Ithamar Conkey's \"Rathbun\" fits the adoring words as if they had waited  for it. Its air, swelling through diatonic fourth and third to the  supreme syllable, bears on its waves the homage of the lines from bar to  bar till the four voices come home to rest full and satisfied in the  final chord--        Gathers round its head sublime.    Ithamar Conkey, was born of Scotch ancestry, in Shutesbury, Mass., May  5th, 1815. He was a noted bass singer, and was for a long time connected  with the choir of the Calvary church, New York City, and sang the  oratorio solos. His tune of \"Rathbun\" was composed in 1847, and  published in Greatorex's collection in 1851. He died in Elizabeth, N.J.,  April 30, 1867.          CHAPTER III.    HYMNS OF CHRISTIAN DEVOTION AND EXPERIENCE.      \"JESU DULCIS MEMORIA.\"    \"Jesus the Very Thought of Thee.\"    The original of this delightful hymn is one of the devout meditations of  Bernard of Clairvaux, a Cistercian monk (1091-1153). He was born of a  noble family in or near Dijon, Burgundy, and when only twenty-three  years old established a monastery at Clairvaux, France, over which he  presided as its first abbot. Educated in the University of Paris, and  possessing great natural abilities, he soon made himself felt in both  the religious and political affairs of Europe. For more than thirty  years he was the personal power that directed belief, quieted  turbulence, and arbitrated disputes, and kings and even popes sought his  counsel. It was his eloquent preaching that inspired the second crusade.    His fine poem of feeling, in fifty Latin stanzas, has been a source of  pious song in several languages:            Jesu, dulcis memoria          Dans vera cordi gaudia,          Sed super mel et omnium          Ejus dulcis presentia.    Literally--        Jesus! a sweet memory      Giving true joys to the heart,      But sweet above honey and all things      His _presence_ [is].    The five stanzas (of Caswall's free translation) now in use are familiar  and dear to all English-speaking believers:        Jesus, the very thought of Thee        With sweetness fills my breast,      But sweeter far Thy face to see,        And in Thy presence rest.        Nor voice can sing nor heart can frame        Nor can the memory find,      A sweeter sound than Thy blest name,        O Saviour of mankind.    The Rev. Edward Caswall was born in Hampshire, Eng., July 15, 1814, the  son of a clergyman. He graduated with honors at Brazenose College,  Oxford, and after ten years of service in the ministry of the Church of  England joined Henry Newman's Oratory at Birmingham, was confirmed in  the Church of Rome, and devoted the rest of his life to works of piety  and charity. He died Jan. 2, 1878.      _THE TUNE._    No single melody has attached itself to this hymn, the scope of  selection being as large as the supply of appropriate common-metre  tunes. Barnby's \"Holy Trinity,\" Wade's \"Holy Cross\" and Griggs' tune (of  his own name) are all good, but many, on the giving out of the hymn,"]]]
