The thing that Tarzan saw charging him when the warning bellow  attracted his surprised eyes loomed terrifically monstrous before  him--monstrous and awe-inspiring; but it did not terrify Tarzan, it  only angered him, for he saw that it was beyond even his powers to  combat and that meant that it might cause him to lose his kill, and  Tarzan was hungry. There was but a single alternative to remaining for  annihilation and that was flight--swift and immediate. And Tarzan fled,  but he carried the carcass of Bara, the deer, with him. He had not more  than a dozen paces start, but on the other hand the nearest tree was  almost as close. His greatest danger lay, he imagined, in the great,  towering height of the creature pursuing him, for even though he  reached the tree he would have to climb high in an incredibly short  time as, unless appearances were deceiving, the thing could reach up  and pluck him down from any branch under thirty feet above the ground,  and possibly from those up to fifty feet, if it reared up on its hind  legs.    But Tarzan was no sluggard and though the GRYF was incredibly fast  despite its great bulk, it was no match for Tarzan, and when it comes  to climbing, the little monkeys gaze with envy upon the feats of the  ape-man. And so it was that the bellowing GRYF came to a baffled stop  at the foot of the tree and even though he reared up and sought to  seize his prey among the branches, as Tarzan had guessed he might, he  failed in this also. And then, well out of reach, Tarzan came to a stop  and there, just above him, he saw Pan-at-lee sitting, wide-eyed and  trembling.    \"How came you here?\" he asked.    She told him. \"You came to warn me!\" he said. \"It was very brave and  unselfish of you. I am chagrined that I should have been thus  surprised. The creature was up wind from me and yet I did not sense its  near presence until it charged. I cannot understand it.\"    \"It is not strange,\" said Pan-at-lee. \"That is one of the peculiarities  of the GRYF--it is said that man never knows of its presence until it  is upon him--so silently does it move despite its great size.\"    \"But I should have smelled it,\" cried Tarzan, disgustedly.    \"Smelled it!\" ejaculated Pan-at-lee. \"Smelled it?\"    \"Certainly. How do you suppose I found this deer so quickly? And I  sensed the GRYF, too, but faintly as at a great distance.\" Tarzan  suddenly ceased speaking and looked down at the bellowing creature  below them--his nostrils quivered as though searching for a scent.  \"Ah!\" he exclaimed. \"I have it!\"    \"What?\" asked Pan-at-lee.    \"I was deceived because the creature gives off practically no odor,\"  explained the ape-man. \"What I smelled was the faint aroma that  doubtless permeates the entire jungle because of the long presence of  many of the creatures--it is the sort of odor that would remain for a  long time, faint as it is.    \"Pan-at-lee, did you ever hear of a triceratops? No? Well this thing  that you call a GRYF is a triceratops and it has been extinct for  hundreds of thousands of years. I have seen its skeleton in the museum  in London and a figure of one restored. I always thought that the  scientists who did such work depended principally upon an overwrought  imagination, but I see that I was wrong. This living thing is not an  exact counterpart of the restoration that I saw; but it is so similar  as to be easily recognizable, and then, too, we must remember that  during the ages that have elapsed since the paleontologist's specimen  lived many changes might have been wrought by evolution in the living  line that has quite evidently persisted in Pal-ul-don.\"    \"Triceratops, London, paleo--I don't know what you are talking about,\"  cried Pan-at-lee.    Tarzan smiled and threw a piece of dead wood at the face of the angry  creature below them. Instantly the great bony hood over the neck was  erected and a mad bellow rolled upward from the gigantic body. Full  twenty feet at the shoulder the thing stood, a dirty slate-blue in  color except for its yellow face with the blue bands encircling the  eyes, the red hood with the yellow lining and the yellow belly. The  three parallel lines of bony protuberances down the back gave a further  touch of color to the body, those following the line of the spine being  red, while those on either side are yellow. The five- and three-toed  hoofs of the ancient horned dinosaurs had become talons in the GRYF,  but the three horns, two large ones above the eyes and a median horn on  the nose, had persisted through all the ages. Weird and terrible as was  its appearance Tarzan could not but admire the mighty creature looming  big below him, its seventy-five feet of length majestically typifying  those things which all his life the ape-man had admired--courage and  strength. In that massive tail alone was the strength of an elephant.    The wicked little eyes looked up at him and the horny beak opened to  disclose a full set of powerful teeth.    \"Herbivorous!\" murmured the ape-man. \"Your ancestors may have been, but  not you,\" and then to Pan-at-lee: \"Let us go now. At the cave we will  have deer meat and then--back to Kor-ul-JA and Om-at.\"    The girl shuddered. \"Go?\" she repeated. \"We will never go from here.\"    \"Why not?\" asked Tarzan.    For answer she but pointed to the GRYF.    \"Nonsense!\" exclaimed the man. \"It cannot climb. We can reach the cliff  through the trees and be back in the cave before it knows what has  become of us.\"    \"You do not know the GRYF,\" replied Pan-at-lee gloomily.    \"Wherever we go it will follow and always it will be ready at the foot  of each tree when we would descend. It will never give us up.\"    \"We can live in the trees for a long time if necessary,\" replied  Tarzan, \"and sometime the thing will leave.\"    The girl shook her head. \"Never,\" she said, \"and then there are the  Tor-o-don. They will come and kill us and after eating a little will  throw the balance to the GRYF--the GRYF and Tor-o-don are friends,  because the Tor-o-don shares his food with the GRYF.\"    \"You may be right,\" said Tarzan; \"but even so I don't intend waiting  here for someone to come along and eat part of me and then feed the  balance to that beast below. If I don't get out of this place whole it  won't be my fault. Come along now and we'll make a try at it,\" and so  saying he moved off through the tree tops with Pan-at-lee close behind.  Below them, on the ground, moved the horned dinosaur and when they  reached the edge of the forest where there lay fifty yards of open  ground to cross to the foot of the cliff he was there with them, at the  bottom of the tree, waiting.    Tarzan looked ruefully down and scratched his head.        7    Jungle Craft    Presently he looked up and at Pan-at-lee. \"Can you cross the gorge  through the trees very rapidly?\" he questioned.    \"Alone?\" she asked.    \"No,\" replied Tarzan.    \"I can follow wherever you can lead,\" she said then.    \"Across and back again?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then come, and do exactly as I bid.\" He started back again through the  trees, swiftly, swinging monkey-like from limb to limb, following a  zigzag course that he tried to select with an eye for the difficulties  of the trail beneath. Where the underbrush was heaviest, where fallen  trees blocked the way, he led the footsteps of the creature below them;  but all to no avail. When they reached the opposite side of the gorge  the GRYF was with them.    \"Back again,\" said Tarzan, and, turning, the two retraced their  high-flung way through the upper terraces of the ancient forest of  Kor-ul-GRYF. But the result was the same--no, not quite; it was worse,  for another GRYF had joined the first and now two waited beneath the  tree in which they stopped.    The cliff looming high above them with its innumerable cave mouths  seemed to beckon and to taunt them. It was so near, yet eternity yawned  between. The body of the Tor-o-don lay at the cliff's foot where it had  fallen. It was in plain view of the two in the tree. One of the gryfs  walked over and sniffed about it, but did not offer to devour it.  Tarzan had examined it casually as he had passed earlier in the  morning. He guessed that it represented either a very high order of ape  or a very low order of man--something akin to the Java man, perhaps; a  truer example of the pithecanthropi than either the Ho-don or the  Waz-don; possibly the precursor of them both. As his eyes wandered idly  over the scene below his active brain was working out the details of  the plan that he had made to permit Pan-at-lee's escape from the gorge.  His thoughts were interrupted by a strange cry from above them in the  gorge.    \"Whee-oo! Whee-oo!\" it sounded, coming closer.    The gryfs below raised their heads and looked in the direction of the  interruption. One of them made a low, rumbling sound in its throat. It  was not a bellow and it did not indicate anger.  Immediately the  \"Whee-oo!\" responded. The gryfs repeated the rumbling and at intervals  the \"Whee-oo!\" was repeated, coming ever closer.    Tarzan looked at Pan-at-lee. \"What is it?\" he asked.    \"I do not know,\" she replied. \"Perhaps a strange bird, or another  horrid beast that dwells in this frightful place.\"    \"Ah,\" exclaimed Tarzan; \"there it is. Look!\"    Pan-at-lee voiced a cry of despair. \"A Tor-o-don!\"    The creature, walking erect and carrying a stick in one hand, advanced  at a slow, lumbering gait. It walked directly toward the gryfs who  moved aside, as though afraid. Tarzan watched intently. The Tor-o-don  was now quite close to one of the triceratops. It swung its head and  snapped at him viciously. Instantly the Tor-o-don sprang in and  commenced to belabor the huge beast across the face with his stick. To  the ape-man's amazement the GRYF, that might have annihilated the  comparatively puny Tor-o-don instantly in any of a dozen ways, cringed  like a whipped cur.    \"Whee-oo! Whee-oo!\" shouted the Tor-o-don and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20203"],[0,"Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (#15)"],[1," Welsh Pennsylvanian, thirty years of age, bred  to country work; honest, sensible, had a great deal of solid  observation, was something of a reader, but given to drink. Stephen  Potts, a young countryman of full age, bred to the same, of uncommon  natural parts, and great wit and humor, but a little idle. These he  had agreed with at extream low wages per week to be rais'd a shilling  every three months, as they would deserve by improving in their  business; and the expectation of these high wages, to come on  hereafter, was what he had drawn them in with. Meredith was to work at  press, Potts at book-binding, which he, by agreement, was to teach  them, though he knew neither one nor t'other. John----, a wild  Irishman, brought up to no business, whose service, for four  years, Keimer had purchased from the captain of a ship; he, too, was  to be made a pressman. George Webb, an Oxford scholar, whose time for  four years he had likewise bought, intending him for a compositor, of  whom more presently; and David Harry, a country boy, whom he had taken  apprentice.    I soon perceiv'd that the intention of engaging me at wages so much  higher than he had been us'd to give, was, to have these raw, cheap  hands form'd thro' me; and, as soon as I had instructed them, then  they being all articled to him, he should be able to do without me. I  went on, however, very chearfully, put his printing-house in order,  which had been in great confusion, and brought his hands by degrees to  mind their business and to do it better.    It was an odd thing to find an Oxford scholar in the situation of a  bought servant. He was not more than eighteen years of age, and gave  me this account of himself; that he was born in Gloucester, educated  at a grammar-school there, had been distinguish'd among the scholars  for some apparent superiority in performing his part, when they  exhibited plays; belong'd to the Witty Club there, and had written  some pieces in prose and verse, which were printed in the Gloucester  newspapers; thence he was sent to Oxford; where he continued about a  year, but not well satisfi'd, wishing of all things to see London, and  become a player. At length, receiving his quarterly allowance of  fifteen guineas, instead of discharging his debts he walk'd out of  town, hid his gown in a furze bush, and footed it to London, where,  having no friend to advise him, he fell into bad company, soon spent  his guineas, found no means of being introduc'd among the players,  grew necessitous, pawn'd his cloaths, and wanted bread. Walking the  street very hungry, and not knowing what to do with himself, a crimp's  bill[51] was put into his hand, offering immediate entertainment and  encouragement to such as would bind themselves to serve in America. He  went directly, sign'd the indentures, was put into the ship, and came  over, never writing a line to acquaint his friends what was become of  him. He was lively, witty, good-natur'd, and a pleasant companion, but  idle, thoughtless, and imprudent to the last degree.        [51] A crimp was the agent of a shipping company. Crimps      were sometimes employed to decoy men into such service      as is here mentioned.    John, the Irishman, soon ran away; with the rest I began to live very  agreeably, for they all respected me the more, as they found Keimer  incapable of instructing them, and that from me they learned something  daily. We never worked on Saturday, that being Keimer's Sabbath, so I  had two days for reading. My acquaintance with ingenious people in the  town increased. Keimer himself treated me with great civility and  apparent regard, and nothing now made me uneasy but my debt to Vernon,  which I was yet unable to pay, being hitherto but a poor aeconomist.  He, however, kindly made no demand of it.    Our printing-house often wanted sorts, and there was no letter-founder  in America; I had seen types cast at James's in London, but without  much attention to the manner; however, I now contrived a mould, made  use of the letters we had as puncheons, struck the mattrices in lead,  and thus supply'd in a pretty tolerable way all deficiencies. I also  engrav'd several things on occasion; I made the ink; I was  warehouseman, and everything, and, in short, quite a fac-totum.    But, however serviceable I might be, I found that my services became  every day of less importance, as the other hands improv'd in the  business; and, when Keimer paid my second quarter's wages, he let me  know that he felt them too heavy, and thought I should make an  abatement. He grew by degrees less civil, put on more of the master,  frequently found fault, was captious, and seem'd ready for an  outbreaking. I went on, nevertheless, with a good deal of patience,  thinking that his encumber'd circumstances were partly the cause. At  length a trifle snapt our connections; for, a great noise happening  near the court-house, I put my head out of the window to see what was  the matter. Keimer, being in the street, look'd up and saw me, call'd  out to me in a loud voice and angry tone to mind my business, adding  some reproachful words, that nettled me the more for their publicity,  all the neighbours who were looking out on the same occasion being  witnesses how I was treated. He came up immediately into the  printing-house, continu'd the quarrel, high words pass'd on both  sides, he gave me the quarter's warning we had stipulated, expressing  a wish that he had not been oblig'd to so long a warning. I told him  his wish was unnecessary, for I would leave him that instant; and so,  taking my hat, walk'd out of doors, desiring Meredith, whom I saw  below, to take care of some things I left, and bring them to my  lodgings.    Meredith came accordingly in the evening, when we talked my affair  over. He had conceiv'd a great regard for me, and was very unwilling  that I should leave the house while he remain'd in it. He dissuaded me  from returning to my native country, which I began to think of; he  reminded me that Keimer was in debt for all he possess'd; that his  creditors began to be uneasy; that he kept his shop miserably, sold  often without profit for ready money, and often trusted without  keeping accounts; that he must therefore fail, which would make a  vacancy I might profit of. I objected my want of money. He then let me  know that his father had a high opinion of me, and, from some  discourse that had pass'd between them, he was sure would advance  money to set us up, if I would enter into partnership with him. \"My  time,\" says he, \"will be out with Keimer in the spring; by that time  we may have our press and types in from London. I am sensible I am no  workman; if you like it, your skill in the business shall be set  against the stock I furnish, and we will share the profits equally.\"    The proposal was agreeable, and I consented; his father was in town  and approv'd of it; the more as he saw I had great influence with his  son, had prevailed on him to abstain long from dram-drinking, and he  hop'd might break him of that wretched habit entirely, when we came to  be so closely connected. I gave an inventory to the father, who  carry'd it to a merchant; the things were sent for, the secret was to  be kept till they should arrive, and in the meantime I was to get  work, if I could, at the other printing-house. But I found no vacancy  there, and so remained idle a few days, when Keimer, on a prospect of  being employ'd to print some paper money in New Jersey, which would  require cuts and various types that I only could supply, and  apprehending Bradford might engage me and get the jobb from him, sent  me a very civil message, that old friends should not part for a few  words, the effect of sudden passion, and wishing me to return.  Meredith persuaded me to comply, as it would give more opportunity for  his improvement under my daily instructions; so I return'd, and we  went on more smoothly than for some time before. The New Jersey jobb  was obtained, I contriv'd a copperplate press for it, the first that  had been seen in the country; I cut several ornaments and checks for  the bills. We went together to Burlington, where I executed the whole  to satisfaction; and he received so large a sum for the work as to be  enabled thereby to keep his head much longer above water.    At Burlington I made an acquaintance with many principal people of the  province. Several of them had been appointed by the Assembly a  committee to attend the press, and take care that no more bills were  printed than the law directed. They were therefore, by turns,  constantly with us, and generally he who attended, brought with him a  friend or two for company. My mind having been much more improv'd by  reading than Keimer's, I suppose it was for that reason my  conversation seem'd to be more valu'd. They had me to their houses,  introduced me to their friends, and show'd me much civility; while he,  tho' the master, was a little neglected. In truth, he was an odd fish;  ignorant of common life, fond of rudely opposing receiv'd opinions,  slovenly to extream dirtiness, enthusiastic in some points of  religion, and a little knavish withal.    We continu'd there near three months; and by that time I could reckon  among my acquired friends, Judge Allen, Samuel Bustill, the secretary  of the Province, Isaac Pearson, Joseph Cooper, and several of the  Smiths, members of Assembly, and Isaac Decow, the surveyor-general.  The latter was a shrewd, sagacious old man, who told me that he began  for himself, when young, by wheeling clay for brick-makers, learned to  write after he was of age, carri'd the chain for surveyors, who taught  him surveying, and he had now by his industry, acquir'd a good  estate; and says he, \"I foresee that you will soon work this man out  of his business, and make a fortune in it at Philadelphia.\" He had not  then the least intimation of my intention to set up there or anywhere.
