Were  the whole power in one hand, we should certainly lose Surat, and  probably Bassein and Salsette, and have to fight hard to hold  Bombay.    \"I shall be very glad to receive any reports you can supply me  with, for it is next to impossible to obtain anything like  trustworthy information here. We only hear what it is desired that  we should know, and all these late changes have come as a complete  surprise to me; for what news I do obtain is, more often than not,  false. Unfortunately, truth is a virtue almost unknown among the  Mahrattas. They have a perfect genius for intrigue, and consider it  perfectly justifiable to deceive not only enemies, but friends.    \"And when do you think of declaring yourself Mr. Lindsay?\"    \"I shall remain with Nana, so long as there is the slightest chance  of his success; unless, indeed, the course of affairs should lead  to the English intervening in these troubles; then, in case they  declare against Nana, I should feel it my duty to leave him at  once.\"    \"I do not think there is any probability of that. Our policy has  been to support him, as the Peishwa's minister, against either  Scindia or Holkar. I shall, of course, report your appearance to  the authorities at Bombay; and I am sure there will be a  disposition to advance your views, for the sake of your father; and  moreover, your knowledge of the language of the Mahrattas--which  is, of course, perfect, or you could not have maintained your  deception so long--will of itself be a strong recommendation in  your favour.\"    After thanking Mr. Malet for his kindness, Harry returned to  Sufder's camp, and gave him an account of his interview with the  Resident.    \"That is satisfactory, indeed, Puntojee. It shows the wisdom of the  step you took. Now, as to our affairs here, I have mentioned the  names of five captains of troops; all of whom can, I think, be  relied upon. However, I am now going out to see them, and have only  been waiting for your return. Six hundred men is but a small body;  but it is a beginning, and I have no doubt that others will join  Nana, later on. But I am not sufficiently sure of their sentiments  to open the matter to them, and it is essential that no suspicion  of Nana's intention to leave the town should get about. There might  be a riot in the city and, possibly, some of the captains, who have  not received the promotion which they regard as their due, might  try to gain Scindia's favour by arresting him.\"    On the following day a messenger arrived from Nana, requesting  Sufder to place himself with his troop, and such other captains as  he could rely upon, on the road a mile west of Poona. He himself  would leave the town quietly, with a small body of his friends, and  join them there. Sufder at once sent off five of his men, with  orders to the captains whom he had seen on the previous afternoon  and, within an hour, six hundred men were gathered at the point  indicated. Half an hour later a party of horsemen were seen coming  along, and Furnuwees soon rode up, accompanied by several of his  strongest adherents.    The officers were gathered at the head of their troops. Nana,  drawing rein, said to them:    \"Thanks for your fidelity. I shall not forget it; and hope, when  the time comes, to reward it as it deserves.\"    He motioned to Harry to join him.    \"Scindia's army was to march this morning,\" he said, \"and his  horsemen will be here by tomorrow evening, at latest.\"    They rode to Satara, where Nana had arranged to stop until he  received news, from Purseram Bhow, as to the course of events at  Poona; and two days later a messenger rode in, with news that  Scindia had arrived near Poona, and had had a friendly interview  with Bajee Rao. Balloba had seen Purseram, and had pretended great  friendship for him; but the old soldier was by no means deceived by  his protestations.    \"If we had only to do with Scindia,\" Nana said, \"matters could be  easily arranged; but the young rajah is only a puppet in his  minister's hands.\"    Several days passed, and then another letter came from Purseram. It  said that Balloba had resolved to oppose Bajee Rao, and to have  both a minister and a Peishwa of his own nomination; and that he  proposed to him that Mahdoo Rao's widow should adopt Chimnajee as  her son, that Bajee should be placed in confinement, and that he,  Purseram Bhow, should be his minister. He asked Nana's advice as to  what course he should take. He stated that Balloba had said he was  greatly influenced, in the methods he proposed, by the hope of  rendering them in some degree acceptable to Nana.    As the latter had only placed Bajee Rao on the musnud as a means of  checkmating Scindia, he advised Purseram to accept the offer; but  pointed out the absolute necessity for his retaining Bajee in his  own custody. Purseram omitted to follow this portion of the advice,  and a formal reconciliation took place, by letter, between Balloba  and Nana. The latter was invited to proceed at once to Poona; but  on finding that Purseram had allowed Balloba to retain Bajee in his  hands, he suspected that the whole was a scheme to entice him into  the power of his enemy, and he therefore made excuses for not  going.    Bajee, ignorant of the plot that had been planned, went to  Scindia's camp to remonstrate against a heavy demand for money, on  account of the expenses to which Scindia had been put; and to his  astonishment he was, then and there, made a prisoner. Chimnajee  positively refused to become a party to the usurpation of his  brother's rights; but he was compelled, by threats, to ascend the  musnud. On the day after his installation, Purseram Bhow wrote,  proposing that Nana should come to Poona to meet Balloba, and to  assume the civil administration of the new Peishwa's government;  while the command of the troops, and all military arrangements,  should remain as they stood.    In reply, Nana requested that Purseram should send his son, Hurry  Punt, to settle the preliminaries; but instead of coming as an  envoy, Hurry Punt left Poona with over five thousand chosen horse.  This naturally excited Nana's suspicions, which were strengthened  by a letter from Rao Phurkay, who was in command of the Peishwa's  household troops, warning him to seek safety without a moment's  delay.    Now that he saw that half measures were no longer possible, Nana  ceased to be irresolute and, when his fortunes seemed to all men to  be desperate, commenced a series of successful intrigues that  astonished all India. He had quietly increased his force, during  the weeks of waiting since he had left Poona. He had ample funds,  having carried away with him an immense treasure, accumulated  during his long years of government. There was no time to be lost  and, as soon as he received the letter of warning, he left the town  of Waee and made for the Concan.    As soon as he reached the Ghauts, he set the whole of his force to  block the passes, by rolling great stones down into the roads. In  addition, strong barricades were constructed, and a force of two  hundred men left, at each point, to defend them. The infantry he  had recruited he threw into the fort of Raygurh, and added strongly  to its defences.    Balloba had proposed that Nana should be followed without delay,  and offered some of Scindia's best troops for the purpose; but  Purseram, acting in accordance with the advice of some of Nana's  friends, raised an objection. He had now, however, resolved to  break altogether with the minister, whose timidity at the critical  moment was considered, by him, as a proof that he could never again  be formidable; and he accordingly gave up Nana's estates to  Scindia, and took possession of his houses and property in Poona,  for his own use. After remaining for a few days, waiting events and  sending off many messengers, Nana sent for Harry.    \"I have a mission for you,\" he said. \"It is one that requires  daring and great intelligence, and I know no one to whom it could  be better committed than to you. You see that, owing to the turn  events have taken, Bajee Rao and myself are natural allies. We have  both suffered at the hands of Balloba. He is a prisoner in  Scindia's camp; though, as I understand, free to move about in it.  I privately received a hint that Bajee, himself, recognizes this;  but doubtless he believes that I am powerless to help either myself  or him.    \"In this he is mistaken. I have been in communication with Holkar,  who is alarmed at the ever-increasing power of Scindia; and he will  throw his whole power into the scale, to aid me. The Rajahs of  Berar and Kolapoore have engaged to aid me, for the same reason;  and the Nizam will sign the treaty that was agreed upon between us,  some time since. Rao Phurkay has engaged to bring the Peishwa's  household troops over, when the signal is given.    \"More than that I have, through Ryajee, a patal, who is an enemy of  Balloba, opened negotiations with Scindia himself; offering him the  estates of Purseram Bhow, and the fort of Surrenuggar, with  territory yielding ten lakhs, on condition of his placing Balloba  in confinement, re-establishing Bajee Rao on the musnud, and  returning with his troops to his own territory.    \"I have no doubt that, when Bajee Rao hears this, he will be glad  enough to throw himself heartily into the cause. I may tell you  that he is apparently a guest, rather than a prisoner; and that he  has a camp of his own, in the centre of that of Scindia; and  therefore, when you have once made your way into his encampment,  you will have no difficulty in obtaining a private interview with  him. It is necessary that he should have money, and silver would be  too heavy for you to carry; but I will give you bags containing a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20730"],[0,"For the Sake of the School (#15)"],[1,"force of the reality that she managed to throw into her part.  Covered with glory, she gave place to her successor, who, while  bewailing the hardness of her luck in having to follow so smart a  performance, recited a humorous ballad which won peals of applause. Mrs.  Arnold again dipped her hand into the bag and unfolded a twist of paper.    \"Corona M. Mitchell,\" she read.    \"Not me, surely! I can't do anything,\" objected Rona hastily.    \"You'll have to,\" laughed the girls. \"No one's let off.\"    \"I can't, I tell you. I've no parlour tricks.\"    \"Give us a story, Rona,\" suggested Ulyth. \"One of those New Zealand  adventures you used to tell to Peter and Dorothy. They loved them.\"    \"Yes, yes! A camp-fire story. That would be spiffing!\" clamoured the  girls. \"Sit on the floor, near the fire, and we'll all squat near you.  We haven't had a story for ages and ages!\"    \"Tell it just as you did at home,\" urged Ulyth.    \"I'll try my best,\" sighed Rona, taking a small stool near the fire, so  as to be slightly above the audience clustered round the hearthrug.    \"It happened about a year ago,\" she began; \"that's summer-time in New  Zealand, you know, because the seasons are just opposite. It was Pamela  Higson's birthday, and I'd been asked to go over for the day. I saddled  Brownie, my best pony, and started at seven, because it's a twelve-mile  ride to the Higsons' farm, and I wanted to be early so as to have time  for plenty of fun. Brownie was fresh, and he wasn't tired when I got  there, so we decided to give him an hour's rest and then ride up into  the bush and have a picnic. Pamela showed me her birthday presents while  we waited. She'd had a box sent her by the mail, and she was very  delighted about it.    \"Well, at perhaps eleven o'clock I set off with Pamela and the rest of  the Higson children. There was Jake, just my own age, and Billy, a  little younger, and Connie and Minnie, the two smallest. Oh yes, we each  had our own horse or pony: Everybody rides out there. We slung baskets  and tin cans over our saddles and then started up by the dry bed of the  river towards the head of the gully. It was very hot (January's like  July here), but we all had big hats and we didn't care. It was such fun  to be together. When your nearest neighbours are twelve miles off you  don't see them often enough to get tired of them. Billy was always  making jokes, and Jake was jolly too in a quiet kind of way. Sometimes  we could all ride abreast, and sometimes we had to go in single file,  and our horses seemed to enjoy it as much as we did. Brownie loved  company, so it was a treat for him as well as for me. The place we were  going to was a piece of high land that lay at the top of the valley  above the Higsons' block. There were generally plenty of berries up  there, and we thought they'd just be ripe. It took us a fairly long time  to do the climb, because there was no proper road, only a rough track.  It was lovely, though, when we got up; we had a splendid view down the  gully, and the air was so much cooler and fresher than it had been at  the farm. We tethered our horses and gathered scrub to make a fire and  boil our kettle. In New Zealand no one thinks of having a meal without  drinking tea with it. We'd the jolliest picnic. The Higsons were famous  for their cakes, and they'd brought plenty with them. I can tell you we  didn't leave very many in the baskets.    \"'Best put out our camp-fire,' Jake said when we'd finished; so we all  set to work and stamped it out carefully. Everything was so dry with the  heat that a spark might easily have set fire to the bush. Then we took  our cans and went off to find berries. There were heaps of them; so we  just picked and picked and picked for ever so long. Suddenly, when we  were talking, we heard a noise and looked round. There was a stampede  among the horses, and two of them, Billy's and Connie's, had broken  loose and were careering down the gully. We ran as quick as lightning to  the others for fear they might also free themselves and follow. I caught  Brownie by the bridle and soothed him as well as I could; but he was  very excited and trembling, and kept sniffing. Then I saw what had  frightened him, for a puff of wind brought a puff of smoke with it, and  ahead of us I saw a dark column whirl up towards the sky. Even the  youngest child who's lived in the bush knows what that means. When all  the grass and everything is so dry, the least thing will start a fire.  Sometimes campers-out are careless, and the wind blows sparks; sometimes  even a piece of an old bottle left lying about will act as a  burning-glass. We didn't inquire the reason; all we knew was that we  must tear back to the farm as rapidly as we could. Bush fires spread  fearfully fast, and this one would probably sweep straight down the  gorge.    \"With two animals gone, luck was against us. Billy took Minnie's pony,  Connie mounted behind Jake, and I made Minnie come with me on Brownie,  because he was so strong, and better able to bear the double burden than  Pamela's horse. It was well for us we were good riders, for we pelted  down that gully fit to break our necks. Brownie was a sure-footed little  beast, but the way he went slithering over rocks would have scared me  if I hadn't been more afraid of the fire behind. We knew it would be  touch and go whether we could save the farm or not. If the men were all  far away there would be very little chance, though we meant to do our  level best.    \"Well, as I was saying, we just stampeded down the gully, and our horses  kept their feet somehow. I guess we arrived at the house like a tornado.  We yelled out our news, and coo-eed to some of the men we could see  working in the distance. They came running at once, and Mrs. Higson sent  up the rocket that was used on the farm as a danger-signal. Fortunately  the rest of the men had only gone a short way. They were back almost  directly, and everybody set to work to make a wide ring of bare land  round the farm. They cut down trees, and threw up earth, and burnt a  great patch of grass, and we children helped too for all we were worth.  We were only just in time. We could see the great cloud of smoke coming  down the valley, and as it grew nearer we heard the roaring or the fire.  It seemed to bear down on us suddenly in a great burning sheet. For a  moment or two the air was so hot that we could scarcely breathe, then  the flame struck our ring of bare land, and parted in two and passed on  either side of us, leaving the farm as an island. We watched it go  crackling farther down the valley, till at last it spent itself in a  rocky creek where it had nothing to feed on. All the place it had passed  over was burnt to cinders, a horrible black mass. Only the house and  the buildings and a few fields round them were untouched. It was an  awful birthday for poor Pamela.\"    \"Was your own farm hurt?\" asked the girls breathlessly, as Rona paused  in her story.    \"Not at all. You see it was in quite a different valley, and the fire  hadn't been near. Jake rode home with me, to make sure I was safe. Dad  hadn't even seen the smoke.\"    \"Suppose you hadn't noticed the fire when you were up in the hills?\"    \"Then we should have been burnt to cinders, farm and all.\"    \"I think Rona's most thrilling adventure will have to end our Stunt,\"  said Mrs. Arnold. \"It's nearly eight o'clock. Time to wind up and get  ready for supper. Attention, please! Each girl take her candle. Where's  our pianist? Torch-bearer Catherine, will you start the Good-night  Song?\"    \"I'm a candidate now, thanks to you!\" exulted Rona to Ulyth; \"perhaps by  Easter I may be a Wood-gatherer!\"    \"It's something to work for, isn't it?\" said Mrs. Arnold, who happened  to overhear.          CHAPTER IX    A January Picnic      Winter in the Craigwen Valley, instead of proving a dreary season of  frost or fog, was apt to be as variable as April. Sheltered by the tall  mountains, the climate was mild, and though snow would lie on the peaks  of Penllwyd and Cwm Dinas it rarely rested on the lower levels. Very  early in January the garden at The Woodlands could boast brave clumps of  snowdrops and polyanthus, a venturous wallflower or two, and quite a  show of yellow jessamine over the south porch. The glade by the stream  never seemed to feel the touch of winter. Many of the oak-trees kept  their brown leaves till the new ones came to replace them, honeysuckle  trails and brambles continually put out verdant shoots, the lastrea  ferns that grew near the brink of the water showed tall green fronds  untouched by frost, and the moss was never more vivid. The glen, indeed,  had a special beauty in winter-time, for the bare boughs of the alders  took exquisite tender shades of purples and greys, warming into amber in  the sunshine, and defying the cunningest brush which artist could wield  to do them justice. By the middle of January the tightly rolled lambs'  tails on the hazels were unfolding themselves and beginning to scatter  pollen, and a few stray specimens of last summer's flowers, a belated  campion or hawkweed, would struggle out from the rough grass under a  protecting gorse-bush. The days varied: rain, the penalty for living  near mountains, often swept down the valley, bringing glorious  cloud-effects, and sending the stream swirling over its boulders with a  boom of myriad voices. Sometimes the sudden swelling of its tributaries  made the Craigwen River overtop its banks, flooding the low-lying  meadows till, augmented by the high tide, its waters filled the valley  from end to end like a lake. This occasional flooding of the marsh was  good for the fields, and ensured a rich hay-crop next summer, so the  school felt it could enjoy the picturesque aspect without needing to  deplore loss to the farmers.    On the 21st of January Miss Teddington had a birthday. She would have  suppressed the fact altogether if possible, or treated "]]]
