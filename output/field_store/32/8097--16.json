In the next moment his fancy rioted in the pleasure of  being at Moscow. That city was eight hundred leagues from him, and  already he was collecting information with respect to it, as if he was  on the eve of occupying it. A French physician having recently arrived  from that capital, he sent for, and interrogated him as to the diseases  there prevalent; he even went back to the plague which had formerly  desolated it; he was anxious to learn its origin, progress, and  termination. The answers of this physician were so satisfactory, that  he immediately attached him to his service.    Fully impressed, however, with a sense of the peril in which he was  about to embark, he sought to surround himself with all his friends.  Even Talleyrand was recalled; he was to have been sent to Warsaw, but  the jealousy of a rival and an intrigue again involved him in disgrace;  Napoleon, deluded by a calumny, adroitly circulated, believed that he  had been betrayed by him. His anger was extreme; its expression  terrible. Savary made vain efforts to undeceive him, which were  prolonged up to the epoch of our entry into Wilna; there that minister  again sent a letter of Talleyrand to the emperor; it depicted the  influence of Turkey and Sweden on the Russian war, and made an offer of  employing his most zealous efforts in negotiating with those two powers.    But Napoleon only replied to it by an exclamation of contempt: \"Does  that man believe himself to be so necessary? Does he expect to teach  me?\" He then compelled his secretary to send that letter to the very  minister who stood most in dread of Talleyrand's influence.    It would not be correct to say, that all those about Napoleon beheld the  war with an anxious eye. Inside the palace, as well as without it, many  military men were found who entered with ardour into the policy of their  chief. The greater part agreed as to the possibility of the conquest of  Russia, either because their hopes discerned in it a means of acquiring  something, according to their position, from the lowest distinction up  to a throne; or that they suffered themselves to participate in the  enthusiasm of the Poles; or that the expedition, if conducted with  prudence, might fairly look to success; or, to sum up all, because they  conceived every thing possible to Napoleon.    Among the ministers of the emperor, several disapproved it; the greater  number preserved silence: one alone was accused of flattery, and that  without any ground. It is true he was heard to repeat, \"That the emperor  was not sufficiently great; that it was necessary for him to become  greater still, in order to be able to stop.\" But that minister was, in  reality, what so many courtiers wished to appear; he had a real and  absolute faith in the genius and fortune of his sovereign.    In other respects, it is wrong to impute to his counsels a large portion  of our misfortunes. Napoleon was not a man to be influenced. So soon as  his object was marked out, and he had made advances towards its  acquisition, he admitted of no farther contradiction. He then appeared  as if he would hear nothing but what flattered his determination; he  repelled with ill-humour, and even with apparent incredulity, all  disagreeable intelligence, as if he feared to be shaken by it. This mode  of acting changed its name according to his fortune; when fortunate, it  was called force of character; when unfortunate, it was designated as  infatuation.    The knowledge of such a disposition induced some subalterns to make  false reports to him. Even a minister himself felt occasionally  compelled to maintain a dangerous silence. The former inflated his hopes  of success, in order to imitate the proud confidence of their chief, and  in order, by their countenance, to stamp upon his mind the impression of  a happy omen; the second sometimes declined communicating bad news, in  order, as he said, to avoid the harsh rebuffs which he had then to  encounter.    But this fear, which did not restrain Caulaincourt and several others,  had as little influence upon Duroc, Daru, Lobau, Rapp, Lauriston, and  sometimes even Berthier. These ministers and generals, each in his  sphere, did not spare the emperor when the truth was to be told. If it  so happened that he was enraged by it, Duroc, without yielding, assumed  an air of indifference; Lobau resisted with roughness; Berthier sighed,  and retired with tears in his eyes; Caulaincourt and Daru, the one  turning pale, the other reddening with anger, repelled the vehement  contradictions of the emperor; the first with impetuous obstinacy, and  the second with short and dry determination.    It should, however, be added here, that these warm discussions were  never productive of bad consequences; good temper was restored  immediately after, apparently without leaving any other impression than  redoubled esteem on the part of Napoleon, for the noble frankness which  they had displayed.    I have entered into these details, because they are either not known, or  imperfectly known; because Napoleon in his closet was quite different  from the emperor in public; and because this portion of the palace has  hitherto remained secret; for, in that new and serious court, there was  little conversation: all were rigorously classed, so that one _salon_  knew not what passed in another; finally, because it is difficult to  comprehend the great events of history, without a perfect knowledge of  the character and manners of the principal personages.    Meantime a famine threatened France. The universal panic quickly  aggravated the evil, by the precautions which it suggested. Avarice,  always prompt in seizing the means of enriching itself, monopolized the  corn while at a low price, and waited till hunger should repurchase it  at an exorbitant rate. The alarm then became general. Napoleon was  compelled to suspend his departure; he impatiently urged his council;  but the steps to be taken were important, his presence necessary; and  that war, in which the loss of every hour was irreparable, was delayed  for two months longer.    The emperor did not give way to this obstacle; the delay, besides, gave  the new harvests of the Russians time to grow. These would supply his  cavalry; his army would require fewer transports in its train: its  progress being lightened, would be more rapid; he would sooner reach the  enemy; and this great expedition, like so many others, would be  terminated by a battle.    Such were his anticipations; for, without deceiving himself as to his  good fortune, he reckoned on its influence upon others; it entered into  his estimate of his forces. It was for this reason that he always  pushed it forward where other things failed, making up by that whatever  was deficient in his means, without fearing to wear it out by constant  use, in the conviction that his enemies would place even more faith in  it than himself. However, it will be seen in the sequel of this  expedition, that he placed too much reliance on its power, and that  Alexander was able to evade it.    Such was Napoleon! Superior to the passions of men by his native  greatness, and also by the circumstance of being controlled by a still  greater passion! for when, indeed, are these masters of the world ever  entirely masters of themselves? Meantime blood was again about to flow;  and thus, in their great career, the founders of empires press forward  to their object, like Fate, whose ministers they seem, (and whose march  neither wars nor earthquakes, nor all the scourges which Providence  permits, ever arrest,) without deigning to make the utility of their  purposes comprehensible to their victims.          BOOK III.          CHAP. I.      The time for deliberation had passed, and that for action at last  arrived. On the 9th of May, 1812, Napoleon, hitherto always triumphant,  quitted a palace which he was destined never again to enter victorious.    From Paris to Dresden his march was a continued triumph. The east of  France, which he first traversed, was a part of the empire entirely  devoted to him; very different from the west and the south, she was only  acquainted with him by means of benefits and victories. Numerous and  brilliant armies, attracted by the fertility of Germany, and which  imagined themselves marching to a prompt and certain glory, proudly  traversed those countries, scattering their money among them, and  consuming their productions. War, in that quarter, always bore the  semblance of justice.    At a later period, when our victorious bulletins reached them, the  imagination, astonished to see itself surpassed by the reality, caught  fire; enthusiasm possessed these people, as in the times of Austerlitz  and Jena; numerous groups collected round the couriers, whose tidings  were listened to with avidity; and the inhabitants, in a transport of  joy, never separated without exclamations of \"Long live the emperor!  Long live our brave army!\"    It is, besides, well known, that this portion of France has been warlike  from time immemorial. It is frontier ground; its inhabitants are nursed  amidst the din of arms; and arms are, consequently, held there in  honour. It was the common conversation in that quarter, that this war  would liberate Poland, so much attached to France; that the barbarians  of Asia, with whom Europe was threatened, would be driven back into  their native deserts; that Napoleon would once more return, loaded with  all the fruits of victory. Would not the eastern departments profit most  by that event? Up to that time, were they not indebted for their wealth  to war, which caused all the commerce of France with Europe to pass  through their hands?

They  complained of this to him, and gave him to understand that if he did  not make his paper to please them, they would stop taking it or  advertising in it.    Franklin heard what they had to say, and then invited them all to  come and have supper with him. They went, expecting a feast, but they  found nothing on the table but two dishes of corn-meal mush and a  big pitcher of cold water. That kind of mush was then eaten only by  very poor people; and because it was yellow and coarse, it was  nicknamed \"sawdust pudding.\"    [Illustration: FRANKLIN EATING \"SAWDUST PUDDING.\"]    Franklin gave everybody a heaping plateful, and then, filling his  own, he made a hearty supper of it. The others tried to eat, but could  not. After Franklin had finished his supper, he looked up, and said  quietly, \"My friends, any one who can live on 'sawdust pudding' and  cold water, as I can, does not need much help from others.\" After  that, no one went to the young printer with complaints about his paper.  Franklin, as we have seen,[15] had learned to stoop; but he certainly  did not mean to go stooping through life.    [Footnote 15: See paragraph 114.]      117. Franklin's plan of life; what he did for Philadelphia.--Not many  young men can see their own faults, but Franklin could. More than  that, he tried hard to get rid of them. He kept a little book in which  he wrote down his faults. If he wasted half an hour of time or a  shilling of money, or said anything that he had better not have said,  he wrote it down in his book. He carried that book in his pocket all  his life, and he studied it as a boy at school studies a hard lesson.  By it he learned three things,--first, to do the right thing; next,  to do it at the right time; last of all, to do it in the right way.    As he was never tired of helping himself to get upward and onward,  so, too, he was never tired of helping others. He started the first  public library in Philadelphia, which was also the first in America.  He set on foot the first fire-engine company and the first military  company in that city. He got the people to pave the muddy streets  with stone; he helped to build the first academy,--now called the  University of Pennsylvania,--and he also helped to build the first  hospital.      118. Franklin's experiments[16] with electricity; the wonderful  bottle; the picture of the king of England.--While doing these things  and publishing his paper besides, Franklin found time to make  experiments with electricity. Very little was then known about this  wonderful power, but a Dutchman, living in the city of Leyden[17]  in Holland, had discovered a way of bottling it up in what is called  a Leyden Jar. Franklin had one of these jars, and he was never tired  of seeing what new and strange thing he could do with it.    He contrived a picture of the king of England with a movable gilt  crown on his head. Then he connected the crown by a long wire with  the Leyden Jar. When he wanted some fun he would dare any one to go  up to the picture and take off the king's crown. Why that's easy  enough, a man would say, and would walk up and seize the crown. But  no sooner had he touched it than he would get an electric shock which  would make his fingers tingle as they never tingled before. With a  loud Oh! Oh! he would let go of the crown, and start back in utter  astonishment, not knowing what had hurt him.    [Illustration: FRANKLIN PLAYING A JOKE WITH THE KING'S CROWN.]    [Footnote 16: Experiments: here an experiment is a trial made to  discover something unknown. Franklin made these experiments or  trials with electricity and with thunder clouds in order to find out  what he could about them.]    [Footnote 17: Leyden: see map in paragraph 62.]      119. The electrical kite.--But Franklin's greatest experiment was  made one day in sober earnest with a kite. He believed that the  electricity in the bottle, or Leyden Jar, was the same thing as the  lightning we see in a thunder-storm. He knew well enough how to get  an electric spark from the jar, for he had once killed a turkey with  it for dinner; but how could he get a spark from a cloud in the sky?    He thought about it for a long time; then he made a kite out of a  silk handkerchief, and fastened a sharp iron point to the upright  stick of the kite. One day, when a thunder-storm was seen coming up,  Franklin and his son went out to the fields. The kite was raised;  then Franklin tied an iron key to the lower end of the string. After  waiting some time, he saw the little hair-like threads of the string  begin to stand up like the bristles of a brush. He felt certain that  the electricity was coming down the string. He put his knuckle close  to the key, and a spark flew out. Next, he took his Leyden Jar and  collected the electricity in that. He had made two great discoveries,  for he had found out that electricity and lightning are the same thing  and he had also found how to fill his bottle directly from the clouds:  that was something that no one had ever done before.    [Illustration: FRANKLIN FLYING A KITE.]      120. Franklin invents the lightning-rod; _Doctor_ Franklin.--But  Franklin did not stop at that. He said, If I can draw down electricity  from the sky with a kite-string, I can draw it still better with a  tall, sharp-pointed iron rod. He put up such a rod on his house in  Philadelphia; it was the first lightning-rod in the world. Soon other  people began to put them up: so this was another gift of his to the  city which he loved. Every good lightning-rod which has since been  erected to protect buildings has been a copy of that invented by  Franklin.    People now began to talk, not only in this country but in Europe,  about his electrical experiments and discoveries. The oldest college  in Scotland[18] gave him a title of honor and called him Doctor--a  word which means a learned man. From this time, Franklin the printer  was no longer plain Mr. Franklin, but Dr. Franklin.    Dr. Franklin did not think that he had found out all that could be  found out about electricity; he believed that he had simply made a  beginning, and that other men would discover still greater things  that could be done with it. Do you think he was mistaken about that?    [Footnote 18: The University of St. Andrews.]      121. Franklin in the Revolutionary War; Franklin and the map of the  United States.--When the war of the Revolution broke out, Dr.  Franklin did a great work for his country. He did not fight battles  like Washington, but he did something just as useful. First, he  helped write the Declaration of Independence, by which we declared  ourselves free from the rule of the king of England; next, he went  to France to get aid for us. We were then too poor to pay our soldiers;  he got the king of France to let us have money to give them.    [Illustration: FRANKLIN'S CANE AND WASHINGTON'S REVOLUTIONARY SWORD.  (Preserved in the Patent Office, Washington.)]    Franklin lived to see the Revolution ended and America free. When  he died, full of years and of honors, he was buried in Philadelphia.  Twenty thousand people went to his funeral.    [Illustration: FRANKLIN'S GRAVE IN CHRIST CHURCH BURIAL-GROUND,  PHILADELPHIA.]    If you wish to see what the country thinks of him, you have only to  look at a large map of the United States, and count up how many times  you find his name on it. You will find that more than two hundred  counties and towns are called FRANKLIN.      122. Summary.--Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston nearly two  hundred years ago. He went to Philadelphia when he was seventeen.  He started a newspaper there, opened the first public library, and  did many other things to help the city. He discovered that lightning  and electricity are the same thing, and he invented the lightning-rod  to protect buildings. In the Revolution, he got large sums of money  from the king of France to pay our soldiers and to help Washington  fight the battles which ended in making America free.

A Virginia boy; what he became; what he learned at school; his  writing-books.--In 1732, when Franklin was at work on his newspaper,  a boy was born on a plantation[1] in Virginia who was one day to stand  higher even than the Philadelphia printer.
