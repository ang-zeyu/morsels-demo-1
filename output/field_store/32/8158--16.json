The night  preceding a Holy day is therefore included in the day, and consequently  work during that period is forbidden.    The Guardian is most delighted to hear of the activities initiated  recently by various local Assemblies in India, and wishes you to convey to  these dear friends, and particularly to Prof. Abdu'l-Aziz of Hyderabad and  the members of his teaching group, the expression of his keenest  appreciation of their labours for the spread of the Cause. He would urge  them each and all to lend every effort to assist your N.S.A. in its  nation-wide teaching endeavours, and is most ardently praying that they  may be assisted and guided by the confirmations from on high.    [From the Guardian:]    I am deeply touched by the varied and compelling evidences of the vigour  and loyalty which characterize the National Assembly's conduct of Baha'i  affairs in both India and    Burma. The Cause, as a result of their self-sacrificing endeavours and  inflexible resolve, is being firmly consolidated and widely propagated in  those regions. Perseverance will enable you to attain your goal and to lay  an unassailable foundation for your future work in both the teaching and  administrative spheres of Baha'i service. I will continue to pray for you  from the depths of my heart.    July 17, 1937          Martha Root's Teaching Trip      Shoghi Effendi has been most pleased to receive your letter of October  25th and to learn of the very warm reception you have accorded Miss Martha  L. Root upon her arrival in India. He has every reason to hope that with  the program the N.S.A. has so carefully arranged for her she will be able  to do an extensive teaching work, and to contact as many classes and  sections of the population as her time and energies permit.    The Guardian would call upon you specially to make every effort possible  to render Miss Root's teaching trip successful in every way, and wishes  you to continually urge the friends to make her visit an occasion for  giving the Faith a widespread publicity throughout India and Burma.    [From the Guardian:]    I am so glad to hear of the plans that have been conceived and the  activity that is being displayed by the friends in connexion with dear  Martha's visit to India.    November 7, 1937    He was particularly delighted to know of the warm hospitality and  wholehearted assistance which the friends have so kindly extended to dear  Miss Root all through her travels throughout India and Burma.    This truly memorable visit of Miss Root to the friends in that vast  continent is indeed a God-sent opportunity, of which the believers should  fully avail themselves in order to give the Faith the widest possible  publicity, and also to attract to it the attention and sympathy of  responsible leaders throughout India and Burma.    The Guardian will continue to pray that at the termination of this year  the results of this historic teaching trip undertaken by our beloved Miss  Root may prove to be such as to ensure for many years to come the  uninterrupted extension of the teaching work in all parts of India.    March 20, 1938          Resting Place of Holy Mother      It will surely please and interest the believers to know that the Holy  Mother's remains have been laid to rest in a spot in the vicinity of, and  overshadowed by the resting-place of the Greatest Holy Leaf on Mt. Carmel.          L.S.A. & Summer School in Simla      The Guardian was delighted to hear of the formation of a Spiritual  Assembly in Simla, and wishes that body to apply soon for official  registration. He would very much appreciate receiving two copies of the  Certificate of Incorporation of the Assembly, as soon as they are obtained  from the authorities.    The news of the projected holding of the first Indian Baha'i Summer School  in Simla has also considerably rejoiced the heart of our beloved Guardian.  He will pray that this excellent and indeed historic project may be  satisfactorily carried out, and receive the whole-hearted, generous and  sustained support of the entire body of the believers throughout India and  Burma.          Six-Year Plan      The Six-Year Plan which your N.S.A. has resolved to initiate with the  purpose of furthering the teaching work has met with the full approval of  the Guardian. He wishes your Assembly every success in this remarkable and  nation-wide undertaking which you have decided to launch.    [From the Guardian:]    Your letter of June 19, enclosing reports of great interest and value, has  also reached me and I am filled with a sense of happiness and gratitude  for these incessant evidences of your zeal and united endeavours. I am  truly impressed by the sound progress and expansion of the activities in  which the believers of India and Burma are so earnestly and devotedly  engaged. The institutions you have recently initiated, the plan of  teaching you have launched, the degree of unity, of consecration and  solidarity you have attained, the measures for internal consolidation you  have devised, the support you have consistently and cordially extended to  our dear Martha, all proclaim the depth of your devotion and attest the  nobility and staunchness of your faith. The utmost care is now required to  nurse, foster, multiply and coordinate these nascent institutions and  activities. Every nerve should be strained, every sacrifice should be made  to enable them to fructify and prosper.    July 4, 1938          First Indian Baha'i Summer School      I am instructed by our beloved Guardian to acknowledge with thanks the  receipt of your communication dated October 17th, together with the  enclosed report on the first Indian Baha'i Summer School held in Simla  during last September.    And as to the photographs of the Summer School you had submitted under  separate cover, these will be placed in the Mansion of Baha'u'llah at  Bahji, and will also appear in the \"Baha'i World\" Vol. VIII.    The Guardian wishes me in this connection to express his profound  satisfaction at the success that has attended the N.S.A.'s efforts for the  formation of this first Baha'i Summer School in India--a step which, he  strongly feels, is bound to accelerate the extension of the teaching  activities of the believers in that land.    He is truly delighted to know that the attendance at the school has been  satisfactory, and that the young believers, in particular, have been most  enthusiastic about it. What he feels now is most essential for the N.S.A.  is to make arrangements to have this school held regularly every year, so  that it may develop into an effective, and increasingly vital, instrument  for the propagation of the Faith, and also for the education and training  of Baha'i teachers.    It is the Guardian's fervent hope that as this Institution expands, and  fulfils the high hopes you all set upon it, it will be felt advisable by  the N.S.A. to consider the possibilities of establishing, in due time, one  or two more of such schools, thus permitting those friends, who in view of  their limited means are not in a position to travel over large distances,  to avail themselves of the benefits derived from these nascent Baha'i  institutions of learning.          Task Immense--Time Short      [From the Guardian:]    The Six-Year Plan, initiated by the National Assembly of India and Burma  with such spontaneous devotion, admirable zeal and unflinching resolve,  marks a milestone on the road of progress trodden by them and their  fellow-workers in both of those countries. The task is immense, the time  is short, the hour critical but the faith that animates and sustains them  is strong enough to surmount all obstacles, however formidable, that may  stand in their way. That they may persevere, redouble their efforts and  win signal success in their mighty enterprise is the dearest wish of my  heart and the object of my constant and earnest prayers.    December 1, 1938          Splendid Work Accomplished by Miss Root      The Guardian was most pleased to receive your letter of the 3rd inst. and  has noted with genuine satisfaction the farewell meeting which the N.S.A.  had arranged in Bombay in honour of our indefatigable and distinguished  Baha'i sister Miss Martha L. Root on the occasion of her departure to  Australia.    The feelings of unbounded joy with which you all unanimously acclaimed her  arrival in India, and the expressions of deep and sorrowful regret which  your National Assembly, as the official mouthpiece of all the Indian and  Burmese believers, had been moved to convey to her upon her leaving your  shores, all attest the high value which the friends have attached to her  presence in India and the splendid work accomplished by her throughout her  travels in that country. The cooperation she had received from the  Assemblies and individual believers in every centre she visited, and the  effective support, both moral and material, so lovingly and continually  extended to her by the N.S.A. in the execution of her teaching plans, have  contributed to a marked degree to the success of her journey, which has  been indeed the longest and most fruitful she had ever undertaken to your  shores.    The Guardian hopes that the friends, and in particular the N.S.A., will  now endeavour to follow up, with united and unflinching resolve, the  splendid work accomplished by Miss Root. The contacts she has formed with  leading personalities in social, religious and university circles should  be maintained, nay extended and consolidated, and every effort exerted in  order to speed up the progress of the teaching work which has received  such a fresh impetus as a result of her uninterrupted teaching activity  during this past year.    January 25, 1939    He has noted with profound appreciation, in particular, the account of the  farewell meeting held in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19274"],[0,"Letters from the Guardian to Australia and New Zealand (#15)"],[1,"and bold teaching campaigns, and it is a great pity that  Australasia, where the Cause is now firmly established and boasts an  active National Assembly, should not have a definite plan, with fixed  goals, of its own.    When the believers are embarked on a definite teaching schedule there will  be less time for them to constantly occupy themselves with purely  secondary administrative points of procedure. Teaching is their need, and  the solution to any problems they may feel they have.    He was delighted over the report of the work in Brisbane; this is a step  in the right direction, and should be followed through vigorously. Please  convey to those who have devotedly served there and brought this group  into being his warm thanks and his admiration for their services.    You may be sure he deeply values the loyal and persevering efforts of your  Assembly to promote the Faith in all its aspects in Australia and New  Zealand. His loving prayers are offered on your behalf and for the success  of your labours.    With Baha'i greetings,  R. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    I wish to appeal, through you, to the members of the entire community in  both Australia and New Zealand, to arise, in these opening years of the  Second Baha'i century, and lend, through their concerted, their sustained,  and determined efforts, an unprecedented impetus to the growth of the  Faith, the multiplication of its administrative centers, and the  consolidation of its nascent institutions. The initiation of a Plan,  carefully devised, universally supported, and designed to promote  effectively the vital interests of the Faith, and attain a definite  objective within a specified number of years, would seem, at the present  hour, highly desirable and opportune, and will, as a magnet, attract, to  an unprecedented degree, the blessings of Baha'u'llah on the members of  both communities, both individually and collectively.    Now that the structural basis of the Baha'i Administrative Order has been  firmly and definitely laid in those far-away lands, and the National  Headquarters of that Order established, a systematic effort must be  exerted to widen the basis of that Order, by multiplying the  Administrative institutions and forming the necessary nucleii, which, as  they develop and are consolidated, will have to be utilized as the  divinely ordained and most effectual instruments for the proclamation of  the Faith to the masses.    I fully realize how small are your numbers, how circumscribed are your  means, how vast the distances that separate the centres already  established. But I firmly believe that the initiation of a Plan to remedy  the very deficiencies from which the infant Administrative Order is now  suffering, and a firm resolve to carry out its provisions, as well as a  sustained effort to make the necessary sacrifices for its consummation,  will set in motion forces of such magnitude, and draw upon both  communities blessings of such potency, as shall excite the wonder of the  believers themselves, and cause their Faith to enter an era of  unprecedented expansion and marvellous and fruitful development.    The concluding years of the first Baha'i century have witnessed a notable  progress in the development and consolidation of both communities. The  first decade of the succeeding century must synchronize with a no less  remarkable extension of that essential administrative foundation on which  the future institutions of a flourishing Faith must repose, and on which  its destinies and security must ultimately depend.    May the Spirit of Baha'u'llah guide, sustain and inspire you in the  discharge of the noble and formidable tasks which will face you in the  years to come.    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF APRIL 7TH, 1947      Haifa, April 7th, 1947.    Dear Baha'i Sister:    Our beloved Guardian has instructed me to write and ask you to please  forward to him copies of the letters of acknowledgement written by the  Bishops who received copies of \"God Passes By\".    He read in the British News Letter that such letters had been received by  your Assembly, and he feels that such material should always be forwarded  (in copy) to Haifa, as it is of more than mere local importance.    He hopes the N.S.A. is progressing with its teaching plans, and assures  you all of his loving prayers.    With Baha'i greetings,  R. Rabbani.            LETTER OF JULY 22ND, 1947      Haifa, July 22nd, 1947.    Dear Baha'i Brother:    The letters from the N.S.A. (some written by the former Secretary) dated  Sep. 2nd, 1946, Feb. 10th, March 9th, April 27th (two of this date), June  13th and July 10th have been received, as well as their enclosures, and  the beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer them on his behalf.    He is very anxious that your Assembly should devote its energies and  resources to prosecuting the teaching work and stimulating and encouraging  the believers to devote their thoughts and time to it. This is really the  solution to all the small problems and differences of opinion that arise  in Australia. It is the sacred duty of the believers to teach, and one of  the reasons for so painstakingly building up Assemblies is for them to  promulgate the Cause of God, and not to lose their time in discussing  details, settling disputes which should not have arisen between Baha'is,  and generally losing themselves in personalities.    He urges your Assembly to try and create as many local assemblies as  possible; large suburbs, if outside the city limits and possessing their  own administration should--if 9 Baha'is reside in them, form separate  assemblies. This may at first seem to weaken the larger communities; but  it will also challenge all concerned to renew their labours to expand the  local communities and increase their numbers.    Enclosed is a letter to Mr. Featherstone in connection with his letter  sent to the Guardian by your Assembly.    Regarding Mr. ...'s appeal: the Guardian feels the best course of action  in this matter is to ask both of the believers concerned to forgive and  forget the entire matter.    He does not want the friends to form the habit of taking up a kind of  Baha'i litigation against each other. Their duties to humanity are too  sacred and urgent in these days, when the Cause is struggling to spread  and assert its independence, for them to spend their precious time, and  his precious time, in this way. Ask them, therefore, to unite, forget the  past, and serve as never before.    His loving prayers are offered for you and the other members of the  Assembly, for your guidance and success.    With warm greetings,  R. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    The Plan, on which the National elected representatives of the Baha'i  communities of Australia and New Zealand have spontaneously embarked marks  a turning-point, of great spiritual significance, in the evolution of the  Faith in those far-off lands, and is an evidence of the truly remarkable  spirit that animates them as well as the communities they represent. I  welcome this mighty step they have taken with joy, pride and gratitude,  and have hastened to transmit to them my contribution as a token of my  keen appreciation of their high endeavours, of my confidence in their  ability, and of my admiration for their zeal and noble determination in  the service of the Faith. The attention of the members of both communities  must henceforth be focused on the Plan, its progress, its requirements,  its significance and immediate objectives. All must participate without  exception without reserve, without delay. The Administrative Order which  they have laboured to establish must henceforth, through its organs and  agencies be utilized for the promotion of this vital purpose, this supreme  end. For no other purpose was it created. That it may serve this end, that  the Plan may speedily develop and yield its destined fruit and demonstrate  through its consummation the worthiness, the capacity and high-mindedness  of the organized body of the followers of Baha'u'llah in those distant  lands are the objects of my fervent and constant prayers at the Holy  Shrines.    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF MAY 11TH, 1948      The National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Australia and New  Zealand,    Mr. James Heggie, sec.    Haifa, May 11th, 1948.    Dear Baha'i Brother:    Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated Dec. 11th, 1947, has been  received, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.    The devotion and perseverance of the believers in seeking to meet the  requirements of their Plan pleases and touches him immensely, and although  he fully realizes that the fewness of their numbers and the great  distances involved in such a vast country as Australia, form serious  handicaps in the progress of their teaching work, he, nevertheless, feels  confidant that they can achieve their goals in time, and raise their heads  proudly in the galaxy of their fellow-pioneers the world over.    We can truly say that this Cause is a cause that enables people to achieve  the impossible! For the Baha'is, everywhere, for the most part, are people  with no great distinguishments of either wealth or fame, and yet once they  make the effort and go forth in the name of Baha'u'llah to spread His  Faith, they become, each one, as efficacious as a host! Witness what  Mustafa Raumie accomplished in Burma, and a handful of pioneers achieved,  in a decade, in Latin America! It is the quality of devotion and  self-sacrifice that brings rewards in the service of this Faith rather  than means, ability or financial backing.    This has again, during the last few years, been demonstrated even more  remarkably by the British Baha'is, who have not only had to contend with  very limited means and a small community to draw from, but have"]]]
