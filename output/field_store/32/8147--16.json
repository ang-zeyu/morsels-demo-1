FOOTNOTE:    [35] _Lay Sermons_, p. 347.      _Rev. Walter Mitchell, M. A., Vice-President of the Victoria Institute._    The Victoria Institute, or Philosophical Society of Great Britain, under  the presidency of the Earl of Shaftesbury, includes among its members  many of the dignitaries of the Church of England, and a large number of  distinguished men of different professions and denominations. Its  principal object is, \"To investigate fully and impartially the most  important questions of philosophy and science, but more especially those  that bear on the great truths revealed in Holy Scripture, with the view  of defending these truths against the opposition of Science, falsely so  called.\" The Institute holds bi-monthly meetings, at which papers are  read on some important topic, and then submitted to criticism and  discussion. These papers, many of which are very elaborate, are  published in the Transactions of the Institute, together with a full  report of the discussions to which they gave rise. Six volumes, replete  with valuable and varied information, have already been published.    Very considerable latitude of opinion is allowed. Hence we find in the  Transactions, papers for and against evolution,--for and against  Darwinism. It would be easy to quote extracts, pertinent to our subject,  more than enough to fill a volume much larger than the present. We must  content ourselves with a few citations from the discussion on a paper in  favor of the credibility of Darwinism,[36] and another in favor of the  doctrine of evolution.[37] In summing up the debates on these two  topics, the chairman, Rev. Walter Mitchell, presented with great  clearness and force his reasons for regarding Darwinism as incredible  and impossible. In his protracted remarks he contrasts the Scriptural  doctrine, that of the Vestiges of Creation, and that of Darwin on the  origin of species. He thus states the doctrine of the Bible on the  subject: \"If,\" he says, \"science be another name for real knowledge; if  science be the pursuit of sound wisdom; if science be the pursuit of  truth itself; I say that man has no right to reject anything that is  true because it savors of God. Well, what is this hypothesis--older than  that of Darwin--which does, and does alone, account for all the observed  facts, or all that which we can read, recorded in the book of Nature? It  is, that God created all things very good; that He made every vegetable  after its own kind; that He made every animal after its own kind; that  He allowed certain laws of variation, but that He has ordained strict,  though invisible and invincible barriers, which prevent that variation  from running riot, and which includes it within strict and well defined  limits. This is a hypothesis which will account for all that we have  learnt from the works of Nature. It admits an intelligent Being as the  Author of all the works of creation, animate as well as inanimate; it  leaves no mysteries in the animate world unaccounted for. There is one  thing which the animate, as well as the inanimate world declares to  man, one thing everywhere plainly recorded, if we will only read it, and  that is the impress of design, the design of infinite wisdom. Any theory  which comes in with an attempt to ignore design as manifested in God's  creation, is a theory, I say, which attempts to dethrone God. This the  theory of Darwin does endeavor to do. If asked how our old theory  accounts for such uniformity of design in the midst of such perplexing  variety as we find in nature, we reply, that this can only be accounted  for on one admission, that the whole is the work of one Author, built  according, as it were, to one style; that it represents the unity of one  mind with the infinite power of adapting all its works in the most  perfect manner for the uses for which they were created.\" \"Whewell has  boldly maintained, and he has never been controverted, that all real  advances in the sciences of physiology and comparative anatomy,--such as  that made by Harvey in discovering the circulation of the blood,--have  been made by those who not only believed in the existence of design  everywhere manifested in the animate world, but were led by that belief  to make their discoveries.\"    When discussing the paper of Mr. Henslow on evolution, he says: \"In  speaking of this paper I must commend the exceeding reverent tone in  which the author has discussed the subject, and I should like to see all  such subjects discussed in a similar tone. The view which Mr. Henslow  brings forward, however, does not appear to be a very original one. It  was the first view ever brought forward on the doctrine of evolution,  and I was the first one to point out that the whole doctrine was one of  retrograde character. The whole tone and character of this paper, except  that which relates to the attributes and moral government of God,[38] is  nothing more or less than the same view of the doctrine of evolution  which created such a sensation in this country when that famous book  came out, 'The Vestiges of Creation.' So far as I can understand the  arguments of Mr. Darwin, they have simply been an endeavor to eject out  of the idea of evolution the personal work of the Deity. His whole  endeavor has been to push the Creator farther and farther back out of  view. The most laborious part of Darwin's attempt at reasoning,--for it  is not true reasoning,--the most laborious part of his logic and  reasoning, is intended to eliminate, as perfectly as any of the  atheistical authors have endeavored to do, the idea of design. Now,  setting revelation aside, the manner in which the unknown author of the  'Vestiges of Creation' treated this subject, satisfactorily showed that  the doctrine of evolution was not in itself an atheistical doctrine, nor  did it deny the existence of design. So far as I could understand and  make out, having carefully read the book at the time it came out and  afterwards, and having carefully analyzed and compared it and Mr.  Darwin's book with each other, so far as I could understand it, the  doctrine of the author of the 'Vestiges of Creation' was simply, that  God created all things, and that when He created matter He impressed on  it certain laws; that matter, being evolved according to those laws,  should produce beings and organs mutually adapted to one another and to  the world; and that every successive development which should be  produced was essentially foreseen, foreknown, and predetermined by the  Deity. His idea, for instance, of the evolution of an eye from a more  simple organ was that the ultimate eye--man's eye, for instance--was to  be a perfect optical instrument, and that its perfection depended on the  previous design by the Creator, that at a certain period it should  appear in a body quite adapted for its purposes. There is one  question,--and not the only one, but we must consider it as an important  question,--whether you can maintain a doctrine of evolution which shall  not be atheistical, and which shall admit the great argument of design?  That is one thing; but the next thing is, does such a doctrine as that  accord either with revelation or with the facts of science? I do not  believe that it can be made to agree with what we believe to be the  revealed Word of God, and I do not believe that it has in the least  degree been proved that the doctrine is consistent with sound science.\"    As to Mr. Darwin's theory, it is obvious from the passages already  quoted that he considers its characteristic feature is not evolution,  nor even natural selection, but the denial of teleology, or of  intelligent control. Mr. Darwin admits the original creation of one or a  few forms of life; and Mr. Mitchell, in his comments on Mr. Warington's  defence of his theory, asks, \"Why am I to limit the work of the Creator  to the simultaneous or successive creations of ten or twelve  commencements of the animate creation? Why, simply for the purpose of  evading the evidence of design as manifested in the adaptation of all  the organs of every animate creature to its wants, which can only be  done by so incredible an hypothesis as that of Mr. Darwin. I say  fearlessly, that any hypothesis which requires us to admit that the  formation of such complex organs as the eye, the ear, the heart, the  brain, with all their marvellous structures and mechanical adaptations  to the wants of the creatures possessing them, so perfectly in harmony,  too, with the laws of inorganic matter, affords no evidence of design;  that such structures could be built up by gradual chance improvements,  perpetuated by the law of transmission, and perfected by the destruction  of creatures less favorably endowed, is so incredible, that I marvel to  find any thinking man capable of adopting it for a single moment.\" It is  useless to multiply quotations. Darwinism is never brought up either  formally or incidentally, that its exclusion of design in the formation  of living organisms is not urged as the main objection against the whole  theory.

Penetrating the bosoms of the governments       encountered on the way, this snake has undermined and eaten away       (overthrowing) all governments, non-Jewish forces according to       their growth.         \"This it should also do in the future, carefully following the       outlined plan, until the cycle of the road travelled by it is       completed by the return of the head of the snake to Zion, and until       the snake will thus include and concentrate in the sphere of its       circle the whole of Europe, and through Europe the rest of the       world, utilizing all forces of conquest and by economic means in       order to subject also the other continents to its influence, to the       influence of its cycle. The return of the head of the snake could       be accomplished only over the razed plains of the governmental       power of all the European countries,--that is through economic       disorganization and ruin, introduced by Zion everywhere by means of       spiritual decadence and moral turpitude, chiefly, with the aid of       Jewish women under the guise of French, Italian and Spanish women,       the best introducers of immorality into the conduct of the rulers       of nations. Women in the hands of Zion serve as bait for those, who       owing to them are always in need of money, and therefore barter       their conscience in order to get money at any cost. This money, in       fact, is only loaned to them, for it quickly comes back to the       hands of bribing Zion through these very women, and at the same       time they have secured slaves for Zion.\"    A comparison of these pages shows that Nilus merely added to  Lutostansky's version the statement to be found in Butmi's version that  the political plan for the peaceful conquest of the world for Zion, was  devised in theory by Solomon and other sages _929 years before the birth  of Christ_. Lutostansky said in 1907 that \"the head of the snake  represents the sages of Zion, and the body--the Judean nation,\" while  Nilus said that the \"head should constitute the government of the Jews  initiated in the plans of the sages (always masked even from their own  people) and the body--the Judean nation.\" Thus the sages of Zion were  transformed by Nilus into \"the government of the Jews\" in order to  connect the \"political plan\" all the more closely with the \"protocols.\"  The American editors have omitted this part of the Nilus epilogue,  evidently because it seemed even to them too absurd for American  consumption.    All of the literature about the \"protocols\" that appeared in various  parts of the world in 1920 is based on the \"documents\" vouched for by  the mysterious Sergius Nilus, and fortified by the irresponsible  Jew-baiter and intellectual pervert Ippolit Lutostansky.    That the Nilus-Lutostansky-Butmi campaign was just what the Tsarist  government desired may be seen from the photographic reproduction of  the letter sent to Lutostansky by Grand Duke Michael, who was regarded  as the most liberal among the Russian Grand Dukes. The letter appears  together with other letters of congratulation from members of the  Imperial family in the volume containing the passages quoted above.

On pages 279, 282 and 283 of volume six of \"The Talmud and the Jews,\"  after outlining the alleged Jewish plot to gain world dominion,  Lutostansky wrote, in 1907:         \"The English are typical pure-blooded Israelites. In ancient times       they were all red-headed, as we see from the descriptions in the       Bible and the New Testament. The characteristic of the Israelites       is known to the whole world under the sun. The characteristic of       the English, if we follow it closely, does not differ from the       Jewish in the slightest degree. Who are the English? This question       has long occupied the minds of many people in Europe, as well as in       England itself. The universal trading traits of the sons of Albion,       their looting politics, based on unfair business, and many other       characteristic traits of the nation which are not peculiar to any       of the other European nations that are even less cultured and       civilized that the English--all these have long seemed very       suspicious and have drawn attention to a certain kinship between       the Anglo-Saxons and the Jews. During the past two decades, in       England and America, also on the European continent, particularly       in France, a whole literature has been created, proving on the       basis of many facts, suppositions and historical references, that       the origin of the Anglo-Saxon race is not Germanic, but Semitic,       that the English are the direct descendants of the Israelites,       thrown by historic fate to the shores of the distant Albion....         \"Indeed, the lion of Judah, has become the British lion and adorns       the coat of arms of the King of England. The harp of King David to       this day represents the coat of arms of Ireland....         \"But not only are the kings of England the direct descendants of       Jewish Kings, they are even seated on the throne of David, on which       the ancient Jewish kings were married. This throne, on which Jacob       fell asleep on that night when he dreamt of the ladder and when the       Lord promised the kingdom to his posterity. This stone, called 'the       Stone of Fate,' which served for the weddings of Jewish Kings, was       brought to Ireland by the prophet Jeremiah. Tergus (?) transferred       it to Scotland, whence it was taken to London.         \"It is curious to note that many prophecies about this fate of       Israel fit England absolutely, as for instance, the prophesy that       Israel will become a great nation, a kingdom on islands, ruling       over large colonies.         \"North America is inhabited by the tribe of Menasseh of whom it was       said in ancient prophesy that he will become a 'separate great       nation.' The very word _saxon_ is derived from _Isaacson_, that is       the son of Israel....         \"As one of the signs of kinship between the population of England       and ancient Israel, we cannot help pointing out the close       similarity between the English and Jewish tribes, the similarity in       their manner of speech, and above all, trading as the fundamental       characteristic of both nations....         \"The particular reverence in which the English hold the Bible       smacks of the Old Testament of the Jews. Even the preference on the       part of the English for long clothes indicates something       Asiatic....         \"Arousing of late the unanimous indignation of the whole civilized       world, the English at the same time call forth amazement at their       traits, instincts and aspirations which positively make them a       monster in the family of cultured and civilized European nations.       As the proverb says, there is no family without a black sheep.       Every monstrosity, however, is to be explained--Jews come from       Jews.\"           *       *       *       *       *    This interesting information is taken from Lutostansky's book. Nilus and  other writers of the Black Hundred camp pictured England in the same  manner immediately after 1905. It was then the Russian governmental  policy to discredit England and the Jews in the eyes of the Russian  people, and the Black Hundreds were employed by the Tsar as the medium  through which to carry on this agitation.    The \"Black Hundreds\" started their campaign in 1905, but their work was  so venomous, so absurd and so steeped in ignorance that there were few  people even in Russia who paid any attention to it.    That the Nilus protocols which were published by the Black Hundreds were  not taken seriously in Russia by the reactionaries or even by the Black  Hundreds who sought every means of discrediting the Jews, may be  gathered from the fact that in the most stupendous anti-Jewish plot ever  devised by the Russian government to justify Jewish massacres,--the  notorious Beilis case,--the protocols published eight years previously  were never used by the prosecution, even though it resorted to every  foul means that could be conjured up of slandering and vilifying the  Jewish people. The very persons who were instrumental in spreading the  \"protocols\" in Russia in 1905 seemed to have realized that the false  accusations which they contained were too transparent"]]]
