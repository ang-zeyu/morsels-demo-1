WATER BEECH.    =Habitat and Range.=--Low, wet woods, and margins of swamps.         Province of Quebec to Georgian bay.    Rather common throughout New England, less frequent towards the coast.         South to Florida; west to Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, Indian       territory, and Texas.    =Habit.=--A low, spreading tree, 10-30 feet high, with a trunk diameter  of 6-12 inches, rarely reaching 2 feet; trunk short, often given a  fluted appearance by projecting ridges running down from the lower  branches to the ground; in color and smoothness resembling the beech;  lower branches often much declined, upper going out at various angles,  often zigzag but keeping the same general direction; head wide, close,  flat-topped to rounded, with fine, slender spray.    =Bark.=--Trunk smooth, close, dark bluish-gray; branchlets grayish;  season's shoots light green turning brown, more or less hairy.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Leaf-buds small, oval or ovoid, acute to  obtuse. Leaves simple, alternate, 2-3 inches long, dull green above,  lighter beneath, turning to scarlet or crimson in autumn; outline ovate  or slightly obovate oblong or broadly oval, irregularly and sharply  doubly serrate; veins prominent and pubescent beneath, at least when  young; apex acuminate to acute; base rounded, truncate, acute, or  slightly and unevenly heart-shaped; leafstalk rather short, slender,  hairy; stipules pubescent, falling early.    =Inflorescence.=--May. Sterile flowers from growth of the preceding  season in short, stunted-looking, lateral catkins, mostly single; scales  ovate or rounded, obtuse, each subtending several stamens; filaments  very short, mostly 2-forked; anthers bearded at the tip: fertile flowers  at the ends of leafy shoots of the season, in loose catkins; bractlets  foliaceous, each subtending a green, ovate, acute, ciliate, deciduous  scale, each scale subtending two pistils with long reddish styles.    =Fruit.=--In terminal catkins made conspicuous by the pale green, much  enlarged, and leaf-like 3-lobed bracts, each bract subtending a  dark-colored, sessile, striate nutlet.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England; prefers moist,  rich soil, near running water, on the edges of wet land or on rocky  slopes in shade. Its irregular outline and curiously ridged trunk make  it an interesting object in landscape plantations. It is not often used,  however, because it is seldom grown in nurseries, and collected plants  do not bear removal well. Propagated from the seed.

CHERRY BIRCH. SWEET BIRCH.    =Habitat and Range.=--Moist grounds; rich woods, old pastures, fertile  hill-slopes, banks of rivers.         Newfoundland and Nova Scotia to the Lake Superior region.    Maine,--frequent; New Hampshire,--in the highlands of the southern  section, and along the Connecticut river valley to a short distance  north of Windsor; Vermont,--frequent in the western part of the state,  and in the southern Connecticut valley (_Flora of Vermont_, 1900);  Massachusetts and Rhode Island,--frequent throughout, especially in the  highlands, less often near the coast; Connecticut,--widely distributed,  especially in the Connecticut river valley, but not common.         South to Delaware, along the mountains to Florida; west to       Minnesota and Kansas.    =Habit.=--A medium-sized or rather large tree, 50-75 feet high, with a  trunk diameter of 1-4 feet, often conspicuous along precipitous ledges,  springing out of crevices in the rocks and assuming a variety of  picturesque forms. In open ground the dark trunk develops a symmetrical,  wide-spreading, hemispherical head broadest at its base, the lower limbs  horizontal or drooping sometimes nearly to the ground. The limbs are  long and slender, often more or less tortuous, and separated ultimately  into a delicate, polished spray. Distinguished by its long  purplish-yellow, pendulous catkins in spring, and in summer by its  glossy, bright green, and abundant foliage, which becomes yellow in  autumn.    =Bark.=--Bark of trunk on old trees very dark, separating and cleaving  off in large, thickish plates; on young trees and on branches a dark  reddish-brown, not separating into thin layers, smooth, with numerous  horizontal lines 1-3 inches long; branchlets reddish-brown, shining,  with shorter lateral lines; season's shoots with small, pale dots. Inner  bark very aromatic, having a strong checkerberry flavor,--hence the  common name, \"checkerberry birch\"; called also \"cherry birch,\" from the  resemblance of its bark to that of the garden cherry.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds reddish-brown, oblong or conical,  pointed, inner scales whitish, elongating as the bud opens. Leaves  simple, in alternate pairs, 3-4 inches long and one-half as wide,  shining green above and downy when young, paler beneath and  silvery-downy along the prominent, straight veins; outline ovate-oval,  ovate-oblong, or oval; sharply serrate to doubly serrate; apex acute to  acuminate; base heart-shaped to obtuse; leafstalk short, often curved,  hairy when young; stipules soon falling.    =Inflorescence.=--April to May. Sterile catkins 3-4 inches long,  slender, purplish-yellow; scales fringed: fertile catkins erect or  suberect, sessile or nearly so, 1/2-1 inch long, oblong-cylindrical;  bracts pubescent; lateral lobes wider than in _B. lutea._    =Fruit.=--Fruiting catkins oblong-cylindrical, nearly erect; bracts with  3 short, nearly equal diverging lobes: nut obovate-oblong, wider than  its wings; upper part of seed-body usually appressed-pubescent.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England; grows everywhere  from swamps to hilltops, but prefers moist rocky slopes and a loamy or  gravelly soil; occasionally offered by nurserymen; both nursery and  collected plants are moved without serious difficulty; apt to grow  rather unevenly.

Newfoundland and Nova Scotia to Rainy river.    New England,--abundant northward; common throughout, from borders of  lowland swamps to 1000 feet above the sea level; more common at  considerable altitudes, where it often occurs in extensive patches or  belts.         South to the middle states, and along the mountains to Tennessee       and North Carolina; west to Minnesota.    =Habit.=--A large tree, at its maximum in northern New England 60-90  feet high and 2-4 feet in diameter at the base. In the forest the main  trunk separates at a considerable height into a few large branches which  rise at a sharp angle, curving slightly, forming a rather small,  irregular head, widest near the top; while in open ground the head is  broad-spreading, hemispherical, with numerous rather equal, long and  slender branches, and a fine spray with drooping tendencies. In the  sunlight the silvery-yellow feathering and the metallic sheen of trunk  and branches make the yellow birch one of the most attractive trees of  the New England forest.    =Bark.=--Bark of trunks and large limbs in old trees gray or blackish,  lustreless, deep-seamed, split into thick plates, standing out at all  sorts of angles; in trees 6-8 inches in diameter, scarf-bark lustrous,  parted in ribbon-like strips, detached at one end and running up the  trunk in delicate, tattered fringes; season's shoots light  yellowish-green, minutely buff-dotted, woolly-pubescent, becoming in  successive seasons darker and more lustrous, the dots elongating into  horizontal lines. Aromatic but less so than the bark of the black birch;  not readily detachable like the bark of the canoe birch.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds conical, 1/4 inch long, mostly  appressed, tips of scales brownish. Leaves simple, in alternate pairs or  scattered singly along the stem; 3-5 inches long, 1/2-2 inches wide,  dull green on both sides, paler beneath and more or less pubescent on  the straight veins; outline oval to oblong, for the most part doubly  serrate; apex acuminate or acute; base heart-shaped, obtuse or truncate;  leafstalk short, grooved, often pubescent or woolly; stipules soon  falling.    =Inflore"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20470"],[0,"Etiquette (#15)"],[1,"K. Jerome, may agreeably fill the mid-day hour of rest which the  guest takes in her room before dressing for the afternoon.  The only  trouble is that the guest who is made so thoroughly comfortable may  forget to go home.  At all events, she will no doubt hail with delight  a second invitation to come.    It may be objected that to keep the guest-room supplied to this extent  would involve a considerable expense; but that would depend on the  character of the guest.  No well-bred woman would depend on these  \"supplies\" for the entire period of a long visit.  They are there to  meet the emergency of a belated trunk, of something forgotten or  overlooked, or the delays in making necessary purchases after her  arrival.  She will gratefully accept the cologne until her own flask is  unpacked, but she leaves the guest-room supply but little diminished  when she departs.    The hostess who has been embittered by seeing only a train of empty  bottles in the wake of a departing guest may naturally feel discouraged  about offering unlimited hospitality in the matter of druggists'  sundries.  But it is merely that she has been unfortunate in her  guests.  She should revise her visiting list.  In entertaining the  right sort of people, she will have no such experience.  She will be  fully rewarded for every care she bestows to make her house a home-like  resort, and she will find that the cost amounts to very little compared  with the large return it brings in the way of social appreciation, to  say nothing of the satisfaction afforded to her own benevolent  impulses.  \"It is more blessed to give than to receive,\" as the ideal  hostess can testify.          \"MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME\"    The responsibilities of a visit are not all on the shoulders of a  hostess.  The guest has also a duty in the matter.    The phrase of welcome quoted above is variously interpreted, if we may  judge by the various ways in which the injunction is obeyed.  To some  people, \"make yourself at home\" is a free permit to take possession of  everything on the premises; to cut the choicest roses in the garden, to  call for the carriage at capricious will, to consult no one's comfort  but their own, and to impose upon the polite forbearance of every one  else, regardless--in short, to behave as no one can behave at home for  any length of time without disrupting that home.    To _make one's self_ at home is to _adapt one's self_ to one's  environment.  If things are different from what we are accustomed to,  we must try to accustom ourselves to _them_, and the mannerly guest  will strive to do this, not as a cross, but as a pleasure.  She will  meet cordially the friends of her hostess who are introduced to her,  however little they attract her; she will cheerfully accompany the  family to their church, even though it be of a different faith from her  own; and she will listen respectfully to the sermon, and refrain from  ungracious criticism of the choir or the minister.  She will take an  interest in any local happenings that are of vital interest to her  entertainers; she will show lively appreciation of everything done for  her entertainment, even though it may be but a commonplace and dull  affair, in her private judgment.  She will measure her grateful duty to  them, not so much by the degree of pleasure which they actually give  her, as by the amount of effort which they obviously make.  It is very  ungracious for a guest of wide social experience to be apathetic when  some unsophisticated little hostess offers what to her seems a novel  treat, but which to her worldly-wise guest is a threadbare device.  No  matter if the device is threadbare; the spirit of kindness which  prompts the effort is immortal; and though we have seen \"rainbow teas\"  until we are weary of them, we will enter cheerfully into the spirit of  this one, because our little hostess in the innocence of her heart has  worked so hard to make it ready in our honor.    The guest should avoid giving extra trouble to the hostess, or to the  servants.  She may offer assistance when circumstances warrant her  doing so, but must refrain from meddling with household matters when  her help is evidently not desired.  She should entertain herself easily  when the hostess is otherwise busy, yet never seem to have any  absorbing occupation that would prevent her from being ready at once to  join the family in any project.  If there are children in the house,  she should be cordial and affectionate with them, without gushing  insincerity or indiscreet petting, and she should not betray any  annoyance if they are noisy and occasionally troublesome--as the best  of children will be at times.  She should aim to feel and act as though  the interests and pleasures of the family were her own, and not make  remarks that are tacit comparisons to their disadvantage.  If there are  glaring faults in the domestic management, it is not her province to  correct them, except so far as a quiet example may be subtly  influential, as it will be, if at heart she makes herself a part of the  circle of sympathy.  After her return to her own home, she should write  a letter to her hostess, expressing the pleasure which the memory of  her visit gives her, and gracefully thanking her friend for all that  made the sojourn so restful and happy.    There is something singularly inspiring in the idea of \"making one's  self at home,\" in the sense of finding the _value_ in every environment  which fate, or chance, or Providence may place us in.  And when, as  welcome guests, we listen to this hearty greeting, we resolve that in  all ways consistent with our duty to our entertainers, and with all  grateful appreciation of their kindness to us, we will \"make ourselves  at home.\"          \"AS THE TWIG IS BENT\"    Every one theoretically admits the importance of early training.  It is  demonstrated in the animal and the vegetable kingdoms, wherever organic  life unfolds and grows; and that the human child is no exception is  promptly recognized in theory, however fatally practice ignores it.    Not that parents mean to ignore it; but there is a \"happy-go-lucky\"  impression that somehow \"he will come out all right;\" that \"as he gets  older, his own good sense will assert itself,\" and so on.  Happily,  this is partly true.  A native good disposition and good sense saves  many a child from the ruin which an unwise course of training has done  its best to precipitate.  The wonder is that they \"turn out\" as well as  they do.  Perhaps Providence, in visiting its judgments, is lenient to  the young and inexperienced parents, themselves undisciplined; to the  helpless child, at the mercy of his blind guides.    There is too much negative, too little positive, in child-training; too  much querulous reiteration of \"don't,\" too little intelligent teaching  how to _do_.  Little children like to be \"shown how;\" they are  fascinated with the games and gifts of the kindergarten, which aims to  _teach something_, not to _repress everything_.  Children are delighted  to learn little polite phrases; to make a bow; to hold a fork daintily;  to offer little courtesies, and to receive a smiling approbation.  They  would rather do things prettily than not.  They are _not \"contrary,\"_  exceptional cases of hereditary ugliness aside.  They are apt pupils,  whether their tutor be a philosopher or a fool.  And if a faulty  example be a child's most constant and influential teacher, what wonder  that the lessons, well-learned, are put in practice?  And just then, if  you listen, you will hear some one issue the emphatic but vacuous  command, \"Don't!\"  And the baby _doesn't_, for the space of a few  seconds; after which, unable to get any new suggestions out of the  idea-less instructions given him, he proceeds to do the same thing  over, only to be again commanded to desist, a spanking for  \"disobedience\" this time varying the monotony of the universal  prohibition.    The profane poll-parrot is not a more startling witness to the  character of its surroundings than the \"terrible infant,\" whose rude  snatchings, pert contradictions, and glib slang phrases are sure to be  most effectively \"shown off\" in the presence of visitors.  It is of  little use to affect grieved surprise, or stern reprobation, when one's  children are merely exhibiting their daily discipline.  Most parents  feel keenly the embarrassment of having the infant misbehave so  inopportunely, and they are apt to offer a tacit apology and a vague  self-defense by sharply reprimanding the child in words that are meant  to give the visitor the idea that they--the parents--never _heard_ or  _saw_ such conduct before, and are now frozen with amazement.  The  nonchalant or incredulous or impish way in which the children receive  these reproofs only confirms the suspicion that such scenes have been  frequent, and the discipline attending them has been inconsequent.    One parent I have heard acknowledge the truth of the matter.  An  elderly clergyman was his guest, and the four-year-old daughter of the  house was entertaining the \"grandpa\" with a toy puzzle, which he  fumbled with in vain, unable to put it together or to take it apart.  Impatient at last, the little girl hastily snatched it from his hand  with a childish growl of contempt, and proceeded to show him the trick,  saying, with an airy mingling of criticism and condescension, \"By Jove!  your name is Dennis; _you_ are not in it!\"  The old gentleman paused,  instinctively prepared to hear the usual \"Why, daughter! papa is  _astonished_ to hear his little girl,\" etc, etc., after the fashion of  the parental hypocrite.  But this candid young father met the dignified  eyes squarely, and said promptly, \"I'm sorry, Doctor, but there's no  use denying it; she is just giving _me_ away.\"  He had the sense to  recognize his own teaching, the honesty to admit it.  Whether he has  the discretion to reform his methods remains to be seen.  "]]]
