Anthony, on the Charge of (#15)"],[1,"the jury to be asked if any of  them disagreed to the verdict which had been recorded by the clerk. No  juror expressed his dissent; but by a nod which appeared to be made by  each juror, expressed their unanimous assent. The innovation is, that  instead of permitting the jury to give their verdict, the Court allows a  verdict to be entered for them, such as it is to be presumed the Court  thinks they ought to render, and then they are asked if any of them  disagree to it; thus making a verdict for them, unless they are bold  enough to stand out against a plain intimation of the opinion of the  Court.\" A _venire de novo_ was ordered. The principal difference between  this case and the one under consideration is, that in the latter the  Court directed the clerk to enter the verdict, and in the former he was  allowed to do so, and in the latter the Court denied liberty to the  jurors to dissent from the verdict, and in the former the Court allowed  such dissent.    With what jealous care the right of trial by jury in criminal cases has  been guarded by every English speaking people from the days of King  John, indeed from the days of King Alfred, is known to every lawyer and  to every intelligent layman, and it does not seem to me that such a  limitation of that right as is presented by the proceedings in this  case, can be reconciled either with constitutional provisions, with the  practice of courts, with public sentiment on the subject, or with safety  in the administration of justice. How the question would be regarded by  the highest Court of this State may fairly be gathered from its decision  in the case of _Cancemi, 18 N.Y., 128_, where, on a trial for murder,  one juror, some time after the trial commenced, being necessarily  withdrawn, a stipulation was entered into, signed by the  District-Attorney, and by the defendant and his counsel, to the effect  that the trial should proceed before the remaining eleven jurors, and  that their verdict should have the same effect as the verdict of a full  panel would have. A verdict of guilty having been rendered by the eleven  jurors, was set aside and a new trial ordered by the Court of Appeals,  on the ground that the defendant could not, even by his own consent, be  lawfully tried, by a less number of jurors than twelve. It would seem to  follow that he could not waive the entire panel, and effectually consent  to be tried by the Court alone, and still less could the Court, against  his protest, assume the duties of the jury, and effectually pronounce  the verdict of guilty or not guilty in their stead.    It will doubtless be insisted that there was no disputed question of  fact upon which the jury were required to pass. In regard to that, I  insist that however clear and conclusive the proof of the facts might  appear to be, the response to the question, guilty or not guilty, must  under the Constitution come from the jury and could not be supplied by  the judgment of the Court, unless, indeed, the jury should see fit to  render a special verdict, which they always may, but can never be  required, to do.    It was the province of the Court to instruct the jury as to the law, and  to point out to them how clearly the law, on its view of the  established facts, made out the offence; but it has no authority to  instruct them positively on any question of fact, or to order them to  find any particular verdict. That must be their spontaneous work.    But there was a question of fact, which constituted the very essence of  the offence, and one on which the jury were not only entitled to  exercise, but were in duty bound to exercise, their independent  judgment. That question of fact was, whether the defendant, at the time  when she voted, knew that she had not a right to vote. The statute makes  this knowledge the very gist of the offence, without the existence of  which, in the mind of the voter, at the time of voting, there is no  crime. There is none by the statute and none in morals. The existence of  this knowledge, in the mind of the voter, at the time of voting, is  under the statute, necessarily a fact and nothing but a fact, and one  which the jury was bound to find as a fact, before they could, without  violating the statute, find the defendant guilty. The ruling which took  that question away from the jury, on the ground that it was a question  of law and not of fact, and which declared that as a question of law,  the knowledge existed, was, I respectfully submit, a most palpable  error, both in law and justice. It was an error in law, because its  effect was to deny any force whatever to the most important word which  the statute uses in defining the offense--the word \"knowingly.\" It was  also unjust, because it makes the law declare a known falsehood as a  truth, and then by force of that judicial falsehood condemns the  defendant to such punishment as she could only lawfully be subject to,  if the falsehood were a truth.    I admit that it is an established legal maxim that every person  (judicial officers excepted) is bound, and must be presumed, to know the  law. The soundness of this maxim, in all the cases to which it can  properly be applied, I have no desire to question; but it has no  applicability whatever to this case. It applies in every case where a  party does an act which the law pronounces criminal, whether the party  knows or does not know that the law has made the act a crime. That maxim  would have applied to this case, if the defendant had voted, knowing  that she had no legal right to vote; without knowing that the law had  made the act of knowingly voting without a right, a crime. In that case  she would have done the act which the law made a crime, and could not  have shielded herself from the penalty by pleading ignorance of the law.  But in the present case the defendant has not done the act which the law  pronounces a crime. The law has not made the act of voting without a  lawful right to vote, a crime, where it is done by mistake, and in the  belief by the party voting that he has the lawful right to vote. The  crime consists in voting \"knowingly,\" without lawful right. Unless the  knowledge exists in fact, is the very gist of the offence is wanting. To  hold that the law presumes conclusively that such knowledge exists in  all cases where the legal right is wanting, and to reject all evidence  to the contrary, or to deny to such evidence any effect, as has been  done on this trial, is to strike the word \"knowingly\" out of the  statute--and to condemn the defendant on the legal fiction that she was  acting in bad faith, it being all the while conceded that she was in  fact acting in good faith. I admit that there are precedents to sustain  such ruling, but they cannot be reconciled with the fundamental  principles of criminal law, nor with the most ordinary rules of justice.  Such a ruling cannot but shock the moral sense of all right-minded,  unprejudiced men.    No doubt the assumption by the defendant of a belief of her right to  vote might be made use of by her as a mere cover to secure the privilege  of giving a known illegal vote, and of course that false assumption  would constitute no defence to the charge of illegal voting. If the  defendant had dressed herself in male attire, and had voted as John  Anthony, instead of Susan, she would not be able to protect herself  against a charge of voting with a knowledge that she had no right to  vote, by asserting her belief that she had a right to vote as a woman.  The artifice would no doubt effectually overthrow the assertion of good  faith. No such question, however, is made here. The decision of which I  complain concedes that the defendant voted in good faith, in the most  implicit belief that she had a right to vote, and condemns her on the  strength of the legal fiction, conceded to be in fact a mere fiction,  that she knew the contrary.    But if the facts admitted of a doubt of the defendant's good faith, that  was a question for the jury, and it was clear error for the court to  assume the decision of it.    Again. The denial of the right to poll the jury was most clearly an  error. Under the provisions of the constitution which have been cited,  the defendant could only be convicted on the verdict of a jury. The case  of Cancemi shows that such jury must consist of twelve men; and it will  not be claimed that anything less than the unanimous voice of the jury  can be received as their verdict. How then could the defendant be  lawfully deprived of the right to ask every juror if the verdict had his  assent? I believe this is a right which was never before denied to a  party against whom a verdict was rendered in any case, either civil or  criminal. The following cases show, and many others might be cited to  the same effect, that the right to poll the jury is an absolute right in  all cases, civil and criminal. (The People vs. Perkins, 1 Wend. 91.  Jackson vs. Hawks, 2 Wend. 619. Fox vs. Smith. 3 Cowen, 23.)    The ground on which the right of the defendant to vote has been denied,  is, as I understand the decision of the court, \"that the rights of the  citizens of the state as such were not under consideration in the  fourteenth amendment; that they stand as they did before that  amendment.... The right of voting or the privilege of voting is a right  or privilege arising under the constitution of the state, and not of the  United States. If the right belongs to any particular person, it is  because such person is entitled to it as a citizen of the state where he  offers to exercise it, and not because of citizenship of the United  States.... The regulation of the suffrage is conceded to the states as a  state right.\"    If this position be correct, which I am not now disposed to question, I  respectfully insist that the congress of the United States had no power  to pass the act in question, that by doing so it has attempted to usurp  the rights of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18284"],[0,"For Every Music Lover (#15)"],[1,"of Chopin, in his delightful and inspiring book, \"Chopin,  the Man and His Music,\" calls the studies Titanic experiments; the  preludes, moods in miniature; the nocturnes, night and its melancholy  mysteries; the ballades, faery dramas; the polonaises, heroic hymns of  battle; the valses and mazurkas, dances of the soul; the scherzos, the  work of Chopin the conqueror. In the sonatas and concertos he sees the  princely Pole bravely carrying his banner amid classical currents. For  the impromptus alone he has found no name and says of them: \"To write of  the four impromptus in their own key of unrestrained feeling and  pondered intention would not be as easy as recapturing the first  'careless rapture of the lark.'\"    Unquestionably the poetry of Chopin is of the most exquisite lyric  character, his leadership is supreme. So original was his conception, so  finished his workmanship, so sublime his purpose, that we may well  exclaim with Schumann, \"He is the boldest, proudest poetic spirit of the  time.\" \"His greatness is his aristocracy,\" says Oscar Bie. \"He stands  among musicians in his faultless vesture, a noble from head to foot.\"    [Illustration: PAGANINI]          VIII    Violins and Violinists--Fact and Fable      That fine old bard who shaped the character of Volker the Fiddler in the  Nibelungen Lay, had a glowing vision of the power of music and of the  violin. Players on the videl, or fiddle, abounded in the days of  chivalry, but Volker, glorified by genius, rises superior to his fellow  minstrels. The inspiring force of his martial strains renewed the  courage of way-worn heroes. His gentle measures, pure and melodious as a  prayer, lulled them to sorely-needed rest.    And what a wonderful bow he wielded! It was mighty and long, fashioned  like a sword, with a keen-edged outer blade, and in his good right hand  could deal a deft blow on either side. Ever ready for action was he, and  his friendship for Hagen of Tronje furnished the main elements of that  grim warrior's power. Together they were long invincible, smiting the  foe with giant strokes, accompanied by music.    The modern German poet, Wilhelm Jordan, in his Sigfridsage, clothes  Volker with the attributes of a violin king he loved, and represents him  tenderly handling the violin. His noble portrayal of a violinist  testifies no more fully to the mission of the musician than the creation  of the Nibelungen bard. In August Wilhelmj, once hailed by Henrietta  Sontag as the coming Paganini, Richard Wagner saw \"Volker the Fiddler  living anew, until death a warrior true.\" So he wrote in a dedicatory  verse beneath a portrait of himself, presented to \"Volker-Wilhelmj as a  souvenir of the first Baireuth festival.\"    The idea of a magic fiddle and a wonderworking fiddler was strongly  rooted in the popular imagination of many peoples, through many ages.  Typical illustrations are the Wonderful Musician of Grimm's Fairy Tales,  whose fiddling attracted man and beast, and the lad of Norse folk-lore  who won a fiddle that could make people dance to any tune he chose. In  Norway the traditional violin teacher is the cascade-haunting musical  genius Fossegrim, who, when suitably propitiated, seizes the right hand  of one that seeks his aid and moves it across the strings until blood  gushes from the finger-tips. Thenceforth the pupil becomes a master, and  can make trees leap, rivers stay their course and people bow to his  will.    Those of us who were brought up on English nursery rhymes early loved  the fiddle. Old King Cole, that merry old soul, was a prime favorite,  notwithstanding his fondness for pipe and bowl, because when he called  for them he called for his fiddlers three and their very fine fiddles.  According to Robert of Gloucester, the real King Cole, a popular monarch  of Britain in the third century, was the father of St. Helena, the  zealous friend of church music. The nursery satire of doubtful  antiquity is our sole evidence of his devotion to the art.    That John who stoutly refused to sell his fiddle in order to buy his  wife a gown placed the ideal above the material. It is to be hoped Mrs.  John enjoyed music more than gay attire. Certainly the dame who was  forced to dance without her shoe until the master found his  fiddling-stick knew the worth of the fiddler's art.    It may have been from a play on the word catgut that so many of these  ditties represent pussy in relation with the fiddle. True fiddler's  magic belonged to the cat whose fiddling made the cow jump over the  moon, the little dog laugh and the dish run away with the spoon. Rarely  accomplished too was the cat that came fiddling out of the barn with a  pair of bagpipes under her arm, singing \"Fiddle cum fee, the mouse has  married the humble bee.\"    Scientists tell us that crickets, grasshoppers, locusts and the like are  fiddlers. Their hind legs are their fiddle-bows, and by drawing these  briskly up and down the projecting veins of their wing-covers they  produce the sounds that characterize them. Was it in imitation of these  small winged creatures that man first experimented with the friction of  bow and strings as a means of making music? Scarcely. It was the result  of similar instinct on a larger human scale.    String instruments played with a bow may be traced to a remote period  among various Oriental peoples. An example of their simplest form exists  in the ravanastron, or banjo-fiddle, supposed to have been invented by  King Ravana, who reigned in Ceylon some 5,000 years ago. It is formed of  a small cylindrical sounding-body, with a stick running through it for a  neck, a bridge, and a single string of silk, or at most two strings. Its  primitive bow was a long hairless cane rod which produced sound when  drawn across the silk. Better tone was derived from strings plucked with  fingers or plectrum, and so the rude contrivance remained long  undeveloped.    The European violin is the logical outcome of the appliance of the bow  to those progenitors of the pianoforte, the Greek monochord and lyre,  precisely as our music is the outgrowth of the diatonic scale developed  by the Greeks from those instruments. Numerous obstacles stand in the  way of defining its story, but it is known that from the ninth century  to the thirteenth bow instruments gained in importance. They divided  into two classes--the viol proper, with flat back and breast and  indented sides, to which belonged the veille, videl, or as it has been  called, guitar-fiddle, and the pear-shaped type, such as the gigue and  rebec. The latter is what Chaucer calls the rubible.    Possibly an impulse was given the fiddle by the Moorish rebab, brought  into Spain in the eighth century, but ancient Celtic bards had long  before this used a bow instrument--the chrotta or crwth, derived from  the lyre, which was introduced by the Romans in their colonizing  expeditions. As early as 560 A. D., Venantius Fortunatus, Bishop of  Poitiers, wrote to the Duke of Champagne:        _\"Let the barbarians praise thee with the harp,      Let the British crwth sing.\"_    This instrument, whose name signifies bulging box, was common in  Britain, and was used in Wales until a comparatively recent period. One  of its distinguishing features was an opening in the lower part for the  admission of the fingers while playing. A fine specimen is preserved in  the South Kensington Museum, corresponding well to the following  description by a Welsh poet of the fifteenth century: \"A fair coffer  with a bow, a girdle, a finger-board and a bridge; its value is a pound;  it has a frontlet formed like a wheel with the short-nosed bow across.  In its centre are the circled sounding-holes, and the bulging of its  back is somewhat like an old man, but on its breast harmony reigns, from  the sycamore melodious music is obtained. Six pegs, if we screw them,  will tighten all its chords; six advantageous strings are found, which,  in a skilful hand, produce a varied sound.\"    In this same museum is a curious wedge-shaped boxwood fiddle, decorated  with allegorical scenes, and dated 1578. Dr. Burney states that it has  no more tone than a violin with a sordine. It is said to have been  presented by Queen Elizabeth to the Earl of Leicester, and bears both of  their coats-of-arms in silver on the sounding-board. Besides her other  accomplishments, the Virgin Queen, we are told, was a violinist. During  her reign we find the violin mentioned among instruments accompanying  the drama and various festivities, and viols of diverse kinds were  freely used. Shakespeare, in Twelfth Night, has Sir Toby enumerate among  Sir Andrew Aguecheek's attractions skill on the viol-de-gamboys, Sir  Toby's blunder for the viola da gamba, a fashionable bass viol held  between the knees. A part was written for this instrument in Bach's St.  Matthew Passion, and a number of celebrated performers on it are  recorded in the eighteenth century. Two of these were ladies, Mrs. Sarah  Ottey and Miss Ford.    Violers and fiddlers formed an essential part of the retinue of many  monarchs in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Charles II., of  England, had twenty-four at his court, with red bonnets and flaunting  livery, who played for him while he was dining according to the custom  he had known at the French court during his exile. Place was grudgingly  yielded to the violin by friends of the less insistent viol. Butler, in  Hudibras, styled it \"a squeaking engine.\" Earlier writers mention \"the  scolding violin,\" and describing the Maypole dance tell of not hearing  the \"minstrelsie for the fiddling.\" Thus all along its course it has had  its opponents and deriders as well as its friends.    The soft-toned viol had deeply indented sides to permit a free use of  the bow, was mostly supplied with frets like a guitar, and had usually  from five to seven strings. Its different sizes corresponded with the  soprano, contralto, tenor and bass of the "]]]
