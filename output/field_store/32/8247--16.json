He did not attempt to touch or read them, but sat looking moodily  at his blotting-pad, preoccupied and absent.    Presently he rose with a little grunt, and, crossing the room, unlocked a  very commonplace and old-fashioned cupboard, the top of which served as a  sideboard. From the cupboard he took a dozen little books and carried  them to the table. They were of uniform size and each bore the figures of  a year. They appeared to be, and indeed were, diaries, but they were not  Mr. Milburgh's diaries. One day he chanced to go into Thornton Lyne's  room at the Stores and had seen these books arrayed on a steel shelf of  Lyne's private safe. The proprietor's room overlooked the ground floor of  the Stores, and Thornton Lyne at the time was visible to his manager, and  could not under any circumstances surprise him, so Mr. Milburgh had taken  out one volume and read, with more than ordinary interest, the somewhat  frank and expansive diary which Thornton Lyne had kept.    He had only read a few pages on that occasion, but later he had an  opportunity of perusing the whole year's record, and had absorbed a great  deal of information which might have been useful to him in the future,  had not Thornton Lyne met his untimely end at the hands of an unknown  murderer.    On the day when Thornton Lyne's body was discovered in Hyde Park with a  woman's night-dress wrapped around the wound in his breast, Mr. Milburgh  had, for reasons of expediency and assisted by a duplicate key of Lyne's  safe, removed those diaries to a safer place. They contained a great deal  that was unpleasant for Mr. Milburgh, particularly the current diary, for  Thornton Lyne had set down not only his experiences, but his daily  happenings, his thoughts, poetical and otherwise, and had stated very  exactly and in libellous terms his suspicions of his manager.    The diary provided Mr. Milburgh with a great deal of very interesting  reading matter, and now he turned to the page where he had left off the  night before and continued his study. It was a page easy to find, because  he had thrust between the leaves a thin envelope of foreign make  containing certain slips of paper, and as he took out his improvised  book mark a thought seemed to strike him, and he felt carefully in his  pocket. He did not discover the thing for which he was searching, and  with a smile he laid the envelope carefully on the table, and went on at  the point where his studies had been interrupted.         \"Lunched at the London Hotel and dozed away the afternoon. Weather       fearfully hot. Had arranged to make a call upon a distant cousin--a       man named Tarling--who is in the police force at Shanghai, but too       much of a fag. Spent evening at Chu Han's dancing hall. Got very       friendly with a pretty little Chinese girl who spoke pigeon English.       Am seeing her to-morrow at Ling Foo's. She is called 'The Little       Narcissus.' I called her 'My Little Daffodil'--\"    Mr. Milburgh stopped in his reading.    \"Little Daffodil!\" he repeated, then looked at the ceiling and pinched  his thick lips. \"Little Daffodil!\" he said again, and a big smile dawned  on his face.    He was still engaged in reading when a bell shrilled in the hall. He rose  to his feet and stood listening and the bell rang again. He switched off  the light, pulled aside the thick curtain which hid the window, and  peered out through the fog. He could just distinguish in the light of the  street lamp two or three men standing at the gate. He replaced the  curtain, turned up the light again, took the books in his arms and  disappeared with them into the corridor. The room at the back was his  bedroom, and into this he went, making no response to the repeated jingle  of the bell for fully five minutes.    At the end of that time he reappeared, but now he was in his pyjamas,  over which he wore a heavy dressing-gown. He unlocked the door, and  shuffled in his slippers down the stone pathway to the gate.    \"Who's that?\" he asked.    \"Tarling. You know me,\" said a voice.    \"Mr. Tarling?\" said Milburgh in surprise. \"Really this is an unexpected  pleasure. Come in, come in, gentlemen.\"    \"Open the gate,\" said Tarling briefly.    \"Excuse me while I go and get the key,\" said Milburgh. \"I didn't expect  visitors at this hour of the night.\"    He went into the house, took a good look round his room, and then  reappeared, taking the key from the pocket of his dressing-gown. It had  been there all the time, if the truth be told, but Mr. Milburgh was a  cautious man and took few risks.    Tarling was accompanied by Inspector Whiteside and another man, whom  Milburgh rightly supposed was a detective. Only Tarling and the Inspector  accepted his invitation to step inside, the third man remaining on guard  at the gate.    Milburgh led the way to his cosy sitting-room.    \"I have been in bed some hours, and I'm sorry to have kept you so long.\"    \"Your radiator is still warm,\" said Tarling quietly, stooping to feel the  little stove.    Mr. Milburgh chuckled.    \"Isn't that clever of you to discover that?\" he said admiringly. \"The  fact is, I was so sleepy when I went to bed, several hours ago, that I  forgot to turn the radiator off, and it was only when I came down to  answer the bell that I discovered I had left it switched on.\"    Tarling stooped and picked the butt end of a cigar out of the hearth. It  was still alight.    \"You've been smoking in your sleep, Mr. Milburgh,\" he said dryly.    \"No, no,\" said the airy Mr. Milburgh. \"I was smoking that when I came  downstairs to let you in. I instinctively put a cigar in my mouth the  moment I wake up in the morning. It is a disgraceful habit, and really is  one of my few vices,\" he admitted. \"I threw it down when I turned out the  radiator.\"    Tarling smiled.    \"Won't you sit down?\" said Milburgh, seating himself in the least  comfortable of the chairs. \"You see,\" his smile was apologetic as he  waved his hand to the table, \"the work is frightfully heavy now that poor  Mr. Lyne is dead. I am obliged to bring it home, and I can assure you,  Mr. Tarling, that there are some nights when I work till daylight,  getting things ready for the auditor.\"    \"Do you ever take exercise?\" asked Tarling innocently. \"Little night  walks in the fog for the benefit of your health?\"    A puzzled frown gathered on Milburgh's face.    \"Exercise, Mr. Tarling?\" he said with an air of mystification. \"I don't  quite understand you. Naturally I shouldn't walk out on a night like  this. What an extraordinary fog for this time of the year!\"    \"Do you know Paddington at all?\"    \"No,\" said Mr. Milburgh, \"except that there is a station there which I  sometimes use. But perhaps you will explain to me the meaning of this  visit?\"    \"The meaning is,\" said Tarling shortly, \"that I have been attacked  to-night by a man of your build and height, who fired twice at me at  close quarters. I have a warrant--\" Mr. Milburgh's eyes narrowed--\"I  have a warrant to search this house.\"    \"For what?\" demanded Milburgh boldly.    \"For a revolver or an automatic pistol and anything else I can find.\"    Milburgh rose.    \"You're at liberty to search the house from end to end,\" he said.  \"Happily, it is a small one, as my salary does not allow of an expensive  establishment.\"    \"Do you live here alone?\" asked Tarling.    \"Quite,\" replied Milburgh. \"A woman comes in at eight o'clock to-morrow  morning to cook my breakfast and make the place tidy, but I sleep here  by myself. I am very much hurt,\" he was going on.    \"You will be hurt much worse,\" said Tarling dryly and proceeded to the  search.    It proved to be a disappointing one, for there was no trace of any  weapon, and certainly no trace of the little red slips which he had  expected to find in Milburgh's possession. For he was not searching for  the man who had assailed him, but for the man who had killed Thornton  Lyne.    He came back to the little sitting-room where Milburgh had been left with  the Inspector and apparently he was unruffled by his failure.    \"Now, Mr. Milburgh,\" he said brusquely, \"I want to ask you: Have you ever  seen a piece of paper like this before?\"    He took a slip from his pocket and spread it on the table. Milburgh  looked hard at the Chinese characters on the crimson square, and then  nodded.    \"You have?\" said Tarling in surprise.    \"Yes, sir,\" said Mr. Milburgh complacently. \"I should be telling an  untruth if I said I had not. Nothing is more repugnant to me than to  deceive anybody.\"    \"That I can imagine,\" said Tarling.    \"I am sorry you are sarcastic, Mr. Tarling,\" said the reproachful  Milburgh, \"but I assure you that I hate and loathe an untruth.\"    \"Where have you seen these papers?\"    \"On Mr. Lyne's desk,\" was the surprising answer    \"On Lyne's desk?\"    Milburgh nodded.    \"The late Mr. Thornton Lyne,\" he said, \"came back from the East with a  great number of curios, and amongst them were a number of slips of paper  covered with Chinese characters similar to this. I do not understand  Chinese,\" he said, \"because I have never had occasion to go to China. The  characters may have been different one from the other, but to my  unsophisticated eye they all look alike.\"    \"You've seen these slips on Lyne's desk?\" said Tarling. \"Then why did you  not tell the police before? You know that the police attach a great deal  of importance to the discovery of one of these things in the dead man's  pocket?\"    Mr. Milburgh nodded.    \"It is perfectly true that I did not mention the fact to the police,\" he  said, \"but you understand Mr. Tarling that I was very much upset by the  sad occurrence, which drove everything else out of my mind. It would have  been quite possible that you would have found one or two of these strange  inscriptions in this very house.\" He smiled in the detective's face. \"Mr.  Lyne was very fond of distributing the curios he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20915"],[0,"Field's Chromatography (#15)"],[1,"of arsenic, which  is produced artificially, there are two distinct varieties; one of a  bright pure yellow tint, in which the sulphur predominates, and one of  an orange hue, in which the arsenic is in excess. The former is the most  lasting, but it is not durable in water, and still less so in oil,  although not discoloured by impure air. Compounded with white lead it is  soon destroyed, nor can it be mixed with any colours into which lead  enters, such as chrome yellow, the old Naples yellow, &c. The sulphur in  combination with the arsenic, having less affinity for that metal than  for lead, lets it go, and forms a sulphuret of lead of a dark greyish  hue. Moreover, as orpiment is apt to deprive other pigments of their  oxygen, and therefore to change and be changed by all pigments whose  colour depends on that element--metallic pigments especially--it is  probable that the orpiment after some time withdraws the oxygen from the  lead; and this would be an additional cause for the darkening of the  tint composed of the two colours. With sulphides or pigments containing  sulphur, orpiment may be used with less danger. If employed at all,  however, it had better be in a pure and unmixed state. We are far from  recommending orpiment as an eligible colour, and it is highly  poisonous.    Brick dust and yellow ochre are sometimes found as adulterants.    50. RAW SIENNA,    Known likewise as _Raw Sienna Earth_, _Terra di Sienna_, &c., is a  ferruginous native pigment, firm in substance, of a glossy fracture, and  very absorbent. It is of rather an impure yellow colour, and much used  in landscape, being very serviceable both in distance and foreground.  Unless proper skill is exercised in its preparation, the sienna has the  objection of being somewhat pasty in working. Being little liable to  change by the action of either light, time, or impure air, it may safely  be employed according to its powers, in oil, water, and other modes of  practice. It possesses more body and transparency than the ochres; and  by burning becomes deeper, orange-russet, as well as more transparent  and drying.    Raw sienna compounded with cobalt, indigo, or Prussian blue, and a very  little bistre, yields good sea greens, that with indigo being the most  fugitive. Alone, it is adapted for shipping, sails, baskets, decayed  leaves, brooks and running streams.    51. STRONTIAN YELLOW,    To justify its name, should be a chromate of strontia, a compound very  slightly soluble in water, and not more stable than the zinc chromate.  The pigment, however, now sold as strontian yellow is usually formed by  admixture, and contains no strontia whatever. Its absence cannot be  considered a disadvantage, for the substitute possesses a durability to  which the original could lay no claim. Other things being equal, we  prefer an original pigment to one compounded, but a good mixture is  decidedly better than a bad original. A light primrose, clear and  delicate.           *       *       *       *       *    The foregoing comprise those yellows more generally employed, advisedly  or not, as the case may be. The following are for the most part not  commercially obtainable, a remark that will apply in ensuing chapters to  all numbered colours printed in italics. As a rule, these have become  obsolete as pigments, or have never been introduced as such. The former  could not well be omitted in a work of this kind, and the latter deserve  notice as being at least suggestive. At present, many of them must be  regarded as mere curiosities, being obtainable only from materials of  excessive rarity. In time, however, the sources whence they are derived  may possibly be found in greater abundance, and these now fancy products  prove of value to the palette. The new metal indium, for instance,  furnishes a bright yellow sulphide, like that of cadmium. The colour  could not be affected by foul air, and might possess other advantages  which would render indium yellow a desirable pigment. With regard to  those compounds available for artistic use, but which have not to our  knowledge been adopted, several are quite ineligible. It may be thought  that they are needlessly referred to, but they are mentioned as a  warning and a guide. Strange preparations have been offered as pigments,  and sometimes accepted, witness turbith mineral, iodine yellow, &c. In  these days of chemistry there is less chance for them, but they are  continually submitted to one's notice, their merits being enlarged upon  in proportion to their worthlessness. Through an exceptional ignorance  they may still gain a place, and it has been deemed, therefore, not  superfluous to allude to them. At the same time we do not pretend to  exhaust the list, any more than we claim to note all substances  possessing colour, but yet not admissible as pigments. Some there are  which do not retain that colour on drying; others, whose preparation  involves processes too nice, complicated, or expensive, for  manufacturing purposes. There are many colours, again, which exist only  on paper. We have too often found the imaginations of chemical writers  far more vivid than the colours they describe. Gorgeous yellows turn  out dingy drabs; dazzling scarlets dirty reds; and brilliant blues dusky  slates. As respects colours, most books of science need revising.    52. _Arsenic Yellow_,    Called also _Mineral Yellow_, has improperly been classed as an  orpiment, from which it differs in not being a sulphide, and in  containing lead. It is prepared from arsenic fluxed with litharge, and  reduced to powder. It is much like orpiment in colour, dries better, and  not being affected by lead, is less liable to change in tint. The  presence of the litharge, however, renders it subject to be blackened by  sulphuretted hydrogen. Of course it is poisonous.    53. _Bismuth Yellow_,    Or chromate of bismuth, may be obtained either as a lemon or an orange  yellow, sparingly soluble in water. The colour is not permanent, and  turns greenish-brown even when excluded from light and air.    54. _Copper Yellow_,    Or chromate of copper-potassa, is of a bright yellow tint, not insoluble  in water. It is discoloured both by foul gas and exposure.    55. _Gelbin's Yellow_,    Or chromate of lime, is a pale whitish yellow, poor in colour, partly  soluble, and not at all to be depended on.    56. _Indium Yellow._    Whether the new metal indium will ever be found in sufficient quantity  to render it practically useful remains to be seen. The most abundant  source at present known is the Freiberg blende, 100,000 parts of which  only yield from twenty-five to forty parts of indium. The metal is  chiefly interesting in an artistic sense on account of its sulphide, a  fine bright yellow resembling cadmium, and best obtained by  precipitating an acetic acid solution with sulphuretted hydrogen, or  sulphide of ammonium. In the latter, the yellow dissolves on being  heated, but deposits again on cooling of a rather paler tint. With one  modification, what was said in a former edition of this Treatise  concerning cadmium yellow may be repeated of indium yellow. \"The metal  from which it is prepared being hitherto scarce, it has not been  employed as a pigment, and its habits are not therefore ascertained.\"  All we can tell is, that the colour does not suffer from impure air.    Indium is likewise distinguished by a straw-yellow oxide.    57. _Iodine Yellow_,    Or iodide of lead, is one of those compounds whose presence on the  palette should never have been allowed. Exceedingly brilliant, it is  also utterly fugitive, destroyed by exposure or foul gas, and useless in  admixture. We may state here that, whatever its colour, no pigment  containing iodine can in the slightest degree be relied upon. One of the  most unstable of substances, being slowly volatile even at common  temperatures, iodine is or ought to be quite inadmissible as a  constituent. Combined with lead, which is in itself objectionable, it  forms a yellow possessing every bad quality.    58. _Iron Yellow_,    Or oxalate of protoxide of iron, has very unadvisedly been recommended  as a pigment. It is a bright pale yellow, but soon loses the beauty of  its tint when submitted to air and light, becoming, by peroxidation, red  and buffy. Even in a book the colour changes.    59. _Madder Yellow._    As our (the Editor's) experience of this product is somewhat at variance  with that of the author, we subjoin his original statement. \"Madder  yellow is a preparation from the madder-root. The best is of a bright  colour, resembling Indian yellow, but more powerful and transparent,  though hardly equal to it in durability of hue; metallic, terrene, and  alkaline substances acting on and reddening it as they do gamboge: even  alone it has by time a natural tendency to become orange and foxy. We  have produced it of various hues and tints, from an opaque and ochrous  yellow, to a colour the most brilliant, transparent, and deep. Upon the  whole, however, after an experience of many years, we do not consider  them eligible pigments.\"    While agreeing with Mr. Field as to the character given of these  yellows, we must confess that we have never been able to obtain, nor  have we ever seen, a \"most brilliant\" madder yellow. Colours bearing  that name have come under our notice, but if their hue was pure and  vivid, they have always proved to be falsely so called, the madder being  conspicuous by its absence. What we have succeeded in producing, and the  genuine samples we have met with, have been fawns, buffs, drabs, &c.,  decidedly \"ochrous\" yellows, and wanting in stability. It is certain  that no true madder yellow, brilliant and pure, ranks as a pigment at  the present day. A variety known as Cory's Yellow Madder may be briefly  described as Cory's _Brown_ Madder.    60. _Massicot_,    Or _Masticot_, is a protoxide of lead, varying from the purest and most  tender straw colour to a "]]]
