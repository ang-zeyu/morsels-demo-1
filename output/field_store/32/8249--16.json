Staten Island, too, was swept with fire and sword. One hundred  people were slain, 150 more taken captive, 300 made homeless. Peace was  again effected and maintained for three years, when fresh quarrels  began. It was not until 1660 that a more general and lasting treaty was  brought about, on which occasion a Mohawk and a Minqua chief gave  pledges in behalf of the Indians, and acted as mediators between the  contending parties.        PERIOD II.    ENGLISH AMERICA TILL THE END OF THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR    1660--1763    CHAPTER I.    NEW ENGLAND UNDER THE LAST STUARTS    [1660]    The Commonwealth in England went to pieces at the death of Oliver  Cromwell, its founder. The Stuart dynasty came back, but, alas!  unimproved. Charles II. was a much meaner man than his father, and James  II. was more detestable still. The rule of such kings was destined to  work sad changes in the hitherto free condition of Massachusetts. This  colony had sympathized with the Commonwealth more heartily than any of  the others. Hither had fled for refuge Goffe and Whalley, two of the  accomplices in the death of Charles I. Congregational church polity was  here established by law, to the exclusion of all others, even of  episcopacy, for whose sake Charles was harrying poor Covenanters to  death on every hillside in Scotland. Nor would his lawyers let the king  forget Charles I.'s attack on the Massachusetts charter, begun so early  as 1635, or the grounds therefor, such as the unwarranted transfer of it  to Boston, or the likelihood that but for the outbreak of the Civil War  it would have been annulled by the Long Parliament itself. Obviously  Massachusetts could not hope to be let alone by the home government  which had just come in.    At first the king, graciously responding to the colony's humble  petition, confirmed the charter granted by his father; but no sooner had  he done so than the hot royalists about him began plotting to overthrow  the same, and their purpose never slumbered till it was accomplished.  Massachusetts was too prosperous and too visibly destined for great  power in America to be suffered longer to go its independent way as  hitherto.    [Illustration: King Charles II.]    [1661]    The province--as yet, of course, excluding Plymouth with its twelve  towns and five thousand inhabitants--contained at this time, 1660, about  twenty-five thousand souls, living in fifty-two towns. These were nearly  all on the coast; Dedham, Concord, Brookfield, Lancaster, Marlborough,  and the Connecticut Valley hamlets of Springfield, Hadley, and  Northampton being the most noteworthy exceptions. Though agriculture was  the principal business, fishing was a staple industry, its product going  to France, Spain, and the Straits. Pipe-staves, fir-boards, much  material for ships, as masts, pitch and tar, also pork and beef, horses  and corn, were shipped from this colony to Virginia, in return for  tobacco and sugar either for home consumption or for export to England.  Some iron was manufactured. The province enjoyed great prosperity.  Boston stood forth as a lively and growing centre, and an English  traveller about this time declared some of its merchants to be \"damnable  rich.\"    As their most precious possession the colonists prized their liberties,  which they claimed in virtue of their original patent. In a paper which  it put forth on June 10, 1661, the General Court asserted for the colony  the right to elect and empower its own officers, both high and low, to  make its laws, to execute the same without appeal so long as they were  not repugnant to those of England, and to defend itself by force and  arms when necessary, against every infringement of its rights, even from  acts of Parliament or of the king, if prejudicial to the country or  contrary to just colonial legislation. In a word Massachusetts, even so  early, regarded itself to all intents and purposes an independent State,  and would have proclaimed accordingly had it felt sufficiently strong.    [1664]    Manifestly the king would not grant so much. On the occasion of his  confirming the charter he demanded that the oath of allegiance be taken  by the people of the colony; that justice be administered there in his  name; and that the franchise be extended to all freemen of sufficient  substance, with the liberty to use in worship, public and private, the  forms of the English Church. The people obeyed but in part, for they  would not even appear to admit the king's will to be their law.  The  franchise was slightly extended, in a grudging way, but no new religious  privileges were at this time conceded. Unfortunately political and  religious liberty were now in conflict. It was worse for the Baptists  and Quakers that the king favored them, and the treatment which they  received in the colony inclined them to the royalist side in the  controversy.    In July, 1664, commissioners arrived in Boston with full authority to  investigate the administration of the New England charters. Such a  procedure not being provided for in the Massachusetts document, the  General Court, backed by the citizens almost to a man, successfully  prevented complainants from appearing before the commission. The  commissioners having summoned the colony as defendant in a certain case,  a herald trumpeted proclamation through the streets, on the morning set  for the trial, inhibiting all from aiding their designs. The trial  collapsed, and the gentlemen who had ordered it, baffled and disgusted,  moved on to New Hampshire, there also to be balked by a decree of the  Massachusetts Governor and Council forbidding the towns so much as to  meet at their behest.    [1668]    Vengeance for such defiance was delayed by Charles II.'s very vices.  Clarendon's fall had left him surrounded by profligate aides, too timid  and too indolent to face the resolute men of Massachusetts. They often  discussed the contumacy of the colony, but went no further than words.  Massachusetts was even encouraged, in 1668, forcibly to reassert its  authority in Maine, against rule either by the king or by Sir Ferdinanda  Gorges's heir as proprietary.    Its charter had assigned to the colony land to a point three miles north  of the Merrimac. Bold in the favor of the Commonwealth, the authorities  measured from the head-waters of that river. But Plymouth had originally  claimed all the territory west of the Kennebec, and had sold it to  Gorges. Charles II. favored the Gorges heirs against Massachusetts, and  for some years previous to 1668 Massachusetts' power over Maine had been  in abeyance. Ten years later, in 1678, to make assurance doubly sure,  Massachusetts bought off the Gorges claimants, at the round price of  twelve hundred and fifty pounds sterling.    [1673]    From 1641 Massachusetts had borne sway in New Hampshire as well,  ignoring John Mason's claim under Charles I.'s charters of 1629 and  1635, still urged by one of Mason's grandsons, backed by Charles II.  Here Massachusetts was beaten. In July, 1679, New Hampshire was  permanently separated from her, and erected into a royal province, of a  nature to be explained in a subsequent chapter, being the earliest  government of this kind in New England.    [1662]    These territorial assumptions on the part of Massachusetts much  increased the king's hostility. This probably would not have proved  fatal had it not been re-enforced by the determination of the merchants  and manufacturers of the mother-country to crush what they feared was  becoming a rival power beyond seas. They insisted upon full enforcement  of the Navigation Laws, which made America's foreign trade in a cruel  degree subservient to English interest. So incorrigible was the colony,  it was found that this end could be compassed only by the abrogation of  the charter, so that English law might become immediately valid in  Massachusetts, colonial laws to the contrary notwithstanding.  Accordingly, in 1684, the charter was vacated and the colonists ceased  to be free, their old government with its popular representation giving  way to an arbitrary commission.    The other New England colonies--Plymouth, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and  New Haven--had made haste to proclaim Charles II. so soon as restored to  the throne, and to begin carrying on their governments in his name. That  beautiful and able man, the younger Winthrop, sped to London on  Connecticut's behalf, and, aided by his colony's friends at court, the  Earls of Clarendon and Manchester and Viscount Say and Seal, in 1662  secured to Connecticut, now made to include New Haven, a charter so  liberal that it continued till October 5, 1818, the ground law of the  State, then to be supplanted only by a close vote. Under this paper,  which declared all lands between the Narragansett River and the Pacific  Ocean Connecticut territory, Connecticut received every whit of that  right to govern itself which Charles was so sternly challenging in the  case of Massachusetts.    [Illustration: John Winthrop the Younger.]    From this time on, as indeed earlier, Connecticut was for many years  perhaps the most delightful example of popular government in all  history. Connecticut and New Haven together had about ten thousand  inhabitants. Their rulers were just, wise, and of a mind truly to serve  the people. Here none were persecuted for their faith. Education was  universal. Few were poor, none very rich. Nearly all supplies were of  domestic production, nothing as yet being exported but a few cattle.    Under the second Charles Rhode Island fared quite as well as  Connecticut. This was remarkable, inasmuch as the little colony of three  thousand souls, in their four towns of Providence, Newport, Portsmouth,  and Warwick, insisted on \"holding forth the lively experiment\"--and it  proved lively indeed--\"of full liberty in religious concernments.\"  Charles did"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20927"],[0,"A Critical Exposition of the Popular 'Jihád' (#15)"],[1,"-relished vices, the  demand for producing practical effect on the will and character, and the  reaping of material fruits from holy and religious life--were barriers  insurmountable for the speedy progress of Islam.    Notwithstanding these impediments Mohammad succeeded, by the influence  of his religion, in combining into one nation the wild and independent  tribes, and putting a stop to their internecine wars; in abolishing the  custom which had the sanction of immemorial usage; and in rooting out  the national idolatry of indigenous growth, without compromising his  inflexible principles of truth and sincerity and honesty; and without  adopting the superstitions and vices of the people.         Dr. Mosheim thinks that, \"the causes of this new religion's rapid       progress are not difficult to be discovered: Mahomet's law itself       was admirably fitted to the natural disposition of man, but       especially to the manners, opinions and vices prevalent among the       people of the East; for it was extremely simple proposing few       things to be believed; nor did it enjoin many and difficult duties       to be performed, or such as laid severe restraints on the       propensities.\"[128]    It is manifest from the history of religions that the people generally  try their best to obtain religion's sanction for the vices prevalent  among them. But there is no doubt in this that Mohammad never sanctioned  the idolatries and superstitions of the Arabs, nor he framed his  doctrines according to the opinions and fancies of the people. He  preached vehemently against everything he found blamable in the people;  he spared not their dear idols and beloved gods and the dreaded genii,  nor accommodated his preaching and reform to indulge them in their evil  practices; nor did he adopt any of the vices current among the people  into his system.    Mohammad certainly did lay stress on the propensities of the mind and  made the actions of the heart answerable to God, and preferred inward  holiness to outside form.         53. \"The heart is prone to evils.\"--Sura XII.         38. \"The hearing and the sight and the heart, each of these shall       be inquired of.\"--Sura XVI.         225. \"God will not punish you for a mistake in your oaths; but He       will punish you for that which your hearts have assented to. God is       gracious, merciful.\"         284. \"Whatever is in the Heavens and in the Earth is God's, and       whether ye disclose what is in your minds or conceal it, God will       reckon with you for it; and whom He pleaseth will He forgive, and       whom he pleaseth will He punish; for God is All-powerful.\"--Sura       II.         5. \"And unless made with intent of heart, mistakes in this matter       shall be no crimes in you.\"--Sura XXXIII.    The teachings of the Koran make our natural inclination subject to  regulation. It lays stress upon the heart of men. Note the following  injunctions regarding internal purity:         120. \"Abandon the outside iniquity and its inside.\"--Sura VI.         152. \"Come not near the pollutions outside or inward.\"--_Ibid._         31. \"Say: Truly my Lord hath forbidden filthy actions whether open       or secret, and iniquity and unjust violence.\"--Sura VIII.    Referring to Dr. Mosheim's cause of the spread of Islam, I will quote  Henry Hallam's opinion regarding the causes of the success of Islam.    Henry Hallam, after enumerating the three important causes of the  success of Islam, the first of which is \"those just and elevated notions  of the divine nature and of moral duties, the gold-ore that pervades the  dross of the Koran, which were calculated to strike a serious and  reflecting people,\" and explaining the two others which are not against  us, he says:--         \"It may be expected that I should add to this what is commonly       considered as a distinguishing mark of Mohammedanism,--its       indulgence to voluptuousness. But this appears to be greatly       exaggerated. Although the character of its founder may have been       tainted by sensuality as ferociousness, I do not think that he       relied upon inducements of the former kind for the diffusion of his       system. We are not to judge of this by rules of Christian purity,       or of European practice. If polygamy was a prevailing usage in       Arabia, as is not questioned, its permission gave no additional       license to the proselytes of Mohammed, who will be found rather to       have narrowed the unbounded liberty of oriental manners in this       respect; while his decided condemnation of adultery and of       incestuous connections, so frequent among barbarous nations, does       not argue a very lax and accommodating morality. A devout Mussulman       exhibits much more of the stoical than the epicurean character. Nor       can any one read the Koran without being sensible that it breathes       an austere and scrupulous spirit. And in fact, the founder of a new       religion or sect is little likely to obtain permanent success by       indulging the vices or luxuries of mankind. I should rather be       disposed to reckon the severity of Mohammed's discipline among the       causes of its influence. Precepts of ritual observance, being       always definite and unequivocal, are less likely to be neglected,       after their obligation has been acknowledged than those of moral       virtue. Thus the long fasting, the pilgrimages, and regular prayers       and ablutions, the constant almsgiving, the abstinence from       stimulating liquors, enjoined by the Koran, created a visible       standard of practice among its followers, and preserved a continual       recollection of their law.         \"But the prevalence of Islam in the lifetime of its Prophet, and       during the first ages of its existence, was chiefly owing to the       spirit of martial energy that he infused into it. The religion of       Mohammed is as essentially a military system as the institution of       chivalry in the west of Europe. The people of Arabia, a race of       strong passions and sanguinary temper, inured to habits of pillage       and murder, found in the law of their native prophet not a license,       but a command, to desolate the world, and the promise of all that       their glowing imaginations could anticipate of Paradise annexed to       all in which they most delighted upon earth.\"[129]    This is sufficient to refute the opinion of Dr. Mosheim. But what  Hallam says regarding the prevalence of Islam in the lifetime of the  Prophet, and during the first ages of its existence, that \"the people of  Arabia, a race of strong passions and sanguinary temper, inured to  habits of pillage and murder, found in the law of their native prophet  not a license, but a command, to desolate the world,\" is untenable.  There was neither a command nor a license to desolate the world, nor was  any person or tribe converted to Islam with that object in view. All the  teachings of the Koran and the history of the early spread of Islam  falsify such an idea.    [Footnote 127: Mohammed, Buddha and Christ, by Marcus Dods, D.D., page  83.]    [Footnote 128: Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History, Book II, Chap. III,  page 73.]    [Footnote 129: Hallam's Middle Ages, Vol. II, pp. 118-9.]      [Sidenote: Mohammad's unwavering belief in his own mission and his  success show him to be a true prophet.]    34. I will pause here for a while, and ask the indulgence of the reader  to reflect upon the circumstances of the persecutions, insults and  injuries, expulsion and attack suffered by Mohammad and his early  followers,[130] and his unwavering adherence to preach against the  gross idolatry and immorality of his people, which all show his sincere  belief in his own mission, and his possession of an irresistible inward  impulse to publish the Divine Truth of his Revelations regarding the  unity in the Godhead and other moral reforms. His preachings of  monotheism, and his enjoining righteousness, and forbidding evil deeds,  were not attended to for many years with material success. In proportion  as he preached against the gross idolatry and superstition of his  people, he was subjected to ridicule and scorn, and finally to an  inveterate persecution which ruined his and his follower's fortune. But  he unflinchingly kept his path; no threats and no injuries hindered him  from still preaching to the ungodly people a purer and higher theology  and better morality than had ever been set before them. He claimed no  temporal power, no spiritual domination; he asked but for simple  toleration, for free permission to win men by persuasion into the way of  truth. He declared he was sent neither to compel conviction by  miracles, nor to constrain outward profession by the sword.[131] Does  this leave any doubt of the strong conviction in his mind, as well as in  the truth of his claim, to be a man sent by God to preach the Divine  Perfection, and to teach mankind the ways of righteousness? He honestly  and sincerely conveyed the message which he had received or which he  conscientiously or intuitively believed to have received from his God  and which had all the signs and marks of truth in itself. What is meant  by a True Prophet or a Revelation is not more than what we find in the  case of Mohammad.[132]    The general office and main business of a prophet is to proclaim to  mankind the Divine Perfection, to teach publicly purer theology and  higher morality, to enjoin the people to do what is right and just, and  to forbid what is wrong and bad. It is neither a part of the prophet to  predict future events, nor to show supernatural miracles. And further, a  prophet is neither immaculate nor infallible. The Revelation is a  natural product of human faculties. A prophet feels that his mind is  illumined by God, and the thoughts which are expressed by him and spoken  or written under this influence are to be regarded as the words of"]]]
