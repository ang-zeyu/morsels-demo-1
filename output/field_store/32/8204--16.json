It were well if writers on the origin of typography would obey the  injunction of Sir Thomas Browne, who thought it not inexpedient for those  who seek to enlighten mankind on any particular subject, first to acquire  some knowledge thereof themselves, so that the labor of readers should not  so generally be profitless. In an article by Bishop McIlvaine, and another  in Frazer's Magazine, by an anonymous contributor, the exercise of  _necromancy_ is imputed to Fust, the inventor or supposed inventor of  printing. Nine of every ten persons who write any thing on the subject  fall into the same error; they have something always to say of Fust and  the devil; curious anecdotes to rehearse of the multiplication of copies  of the Scriptures in Paris and elsewhere; spells and incantations by the  inventor of the \"black\" art to describe, &c. But this is all induced by  ignorance of the facts. John Fust, the putative inventor of printing, was  a shrewd silversmith, and we suspect a knavish one, for without having any  thing to do with the _invention_ of the \"art preservative of arts,\" he  managed to rob another of the credit and profit of it. He was, however,  never in Paris; he was never in his lifetime accused of the exercise of  magical arts; he simply endeavored to make as much money as he could in  Germany by underselling the copyists in the book market. All stories in  which necromancy is attributed to him or to any other printer; all  accounts of the opposition of the priests to typography as an infernal  invention; in fine, the whole popular idea of Faust and the devil, is a  modern contrivance, and originated in this manner: Some bookmaker, about  the year 1580, undertook to write a history of printing; he had an  indistinct recollection of Professor Faustus of the University of  Wittenberg, and in his book blended as many of his adventures as he could  remember with the memoirs of John Fust the printer; and from that day a  succession of ignorant chroniclers have considered two men, of totally  different characters, living at different times, as one individual.    Faust, the necromancer, was born in the duchy of Weimer in 1491,  twenty-five years after the printer is understood to have died. He is  mentioned by Melancthon, Wierus, and many other cotemporary writers, and  was probably in his time not less distinguished as a magician than Agrippa  or Albertus Magnus. It is related of him by Godwin, that he was in his  youth adopted by an uncle, dwelling in the city of Wittenberg, who had no  children. Here he was sent to college, and was soon distinguished by the  greatness of his talents, and the rapid progress he made in every species  of learning that was put before him. He was destined by his relative to  the profession of theology. But he is said ungraciously to have set at  naught his uncle's pious intentions. He went through his examinations with  applause, and carried off all the first prizes among sixteen competitors;  he therefore obtained the degree of doctor in divinity; but his success  only made him proud and headstrong. He disdained his theological eminence,  and sighed for distinction as a man of the world. He took his degree as a  doctor of medicine, and aspired to celebrity as a practitioner of physic.  About the same time he fell in with certain cotemporaries, of tastes  similar to his own, and associated with them in the study of Chaldean,  Greek, and Arabic science, of strange incantations and supernatural  influences, in short, of all the arts of a sorcerer.    Having made such progress as he could by dint of study and intense  application, he at length resolved to prosecute his purposes still further  by actually raising the devil. He happened one evening to walk in a thick,  dark wood, within a short distance from Wittenberg, when it occurred to  him that that was a fit place for executing his design. He stopped at a  solitary spot where four roads met, and made use of his wand to mark out a  large circle, and then two small ones within the larger. In one of these  he fixed himself, appropriating the other for the use of his expected  visitor. He went over the precise range of charms and incantations,  omitting nothing. It was now dark night, between the ninth and tenth  hours. The devil manifested himself by the usual signs of his appearance.  \"Wherefore am I called?\" said he, \"and what is it that you demand?\" \"I  require,\" rejoined Faustus, \"that you should sedulously attend unto me,  answer my inquiries, and fulfil my behests.\"    Immediately upon Faustus pronouncing these words, there followed a tumult  overhead, as if heaven and earth were coming together. The trees in their  topmost branches bended to their very roots. It seemed as if the whole  forest were peopled with devils, making a crash like a thousand wagons,  hurrying to the right and left, before and behind, in every possible  direction, with thunder and lightning, and the continual discharge of  great cannon. Hell appeared to have emptied itself to have furnished the  din. There succeeded the most charming music from all sorts of  instruments, and sounds of hilarity and dancing. Next came a report as of  a tournament, and the clashing of innumerable lances. This lasted so long,  that Faustus was many times about to rush out of the circle in which he  had inclosed himself, and to abandon his preparations. His courage and  resolution, however, got the better; and he remained immovable. He pursued  his incantations without intermission. Then came to the very edge of the  circle a griffin first, and next a dragon, which in the midst of his  enchantments grinned at him horribly with his teeth, but finally fell down  at his feet, and extended his length to many a rood. Faustus persisted.  Then succeeded a sort of fireworks, a pillar of fire, and a man on fire at  the top, who leaped down; and there immediately appeared a number of  globes here and there red-hot, while the man on fire went and came to  every part of the circle for a quarter of an hour. At length the devil  came forward in the shape of a gray monk, and asked Faustus what he  wanted. Faustus adjourned their further conference, and appointed the  devil to comes to him at his lodging.    He in the mean time busied himself in the necessary preparations. He  entered his study at the appointed time, and found the devil waiting for  him. Faustus told him that he had prepared certain articles, to which it  was necessary that the demon should fully accord,--that he should attend  him at all times, when required, for all the days of his life; that he  should bring him every thing he wanted; that he should come to him in any  shape that Faustus required, or be invisible, and Faustus should be  invisible too whenever he desired it; that he should deny him nothing, and  answer him with perfect veracity to every thing he demanded. To some of  these requisitions the spirit could not consent, without authority from  his master, the chief of devils. At length all these concessions were  adjusted. The devil on his part also prescribed his conditions. That  Faustus should abjure the Christian religion and all reverence for the  supreme God; that he should enjoy the entire command of his attendant  demon for a certain term of years; and that at the end of that period the  devil should dispose of him, body and soul, at his pleasure [the term was  fixed for twenty-four years]; that he should at all times steadfastly  refuse to listen to any one who should desire to convert him, or convince  him of the error of his ways, and lead him to repentance; that Faustus  should draw up a writing containing these particulars, and sign it with  his blood; that he should deliver this writing to the devil, and keep a  duplicate of it himself, that so there might be no misunderstanding. It  was further appointed by Faustus, that the devil should usually attend him  in the habit of a cordelier, with a pleasing countenance and an  insinuating demeanor. Faustus also asked the devil his name, who answered  that he was usually called Mephistophiles.    Numerous adventures of Faustus are related in the German histories. It is  said that the emperor Charles V. was at Inspruck, at a time when Faustus  also resided there. His courtiers informed the emperor that Faustus was in  the town, and Charles expressed a desire to see him. He was introduced.  Charles asked him whether he could really perform such wondrous feats as  were reported of him. Faustus modestly replied, inviting the emperor to  make trial of his skill. \"Then,\" said Charles, \"of all the eminent  personages I have ever read of, Alexander the Great is the man who most  excites my curiosity, and whom it would most gratify my wishes to see in  the very form in which he lived.\" Faustus rejoined that it was out of his  power truly to raise the dead, but that he had spirits at his command who  had often seen that great conqueror, and that Faustus would willingly  place him before the emperor as he required. He conditioned that Charles  should not speak to him, nor attempt to touch him. The emperor promised  compliance. After a few ceremonies, therefore, Faustus opened a door, and  brought in Alexander exactly in the form in which he had lived, with the  same garments, and every circumstance corresponding. Alexander made his  obeisance to the emperor, and walked several times round him. The queen of  Alexander was then introduced in the same manner."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20116"],[0,"The Belief in Immortality and the Worship of the Dead, Volume 1 (of 3) (#15)"],[1,"an  effect of sorcery. Thus in regard to the Narrinyeri tribe of South  Australia the Rev. George Taplin, who knew them intimately for years,  says that \"no native regards death as natural, but always as the result  of sorcery.\"[24] Again, to quote Mr. R. Brough Smyth, who has collected  much information on the tribes of Victoria: \"Mr. Daniel Bunce, an  intelligent observer, and a gentleman well acquainted with the habits of  the blacks, says that no tribe that he has ever met with believes in the  possibility of a man dying a natural death. If a man is taken ill, it is  at once assumed that some member of a hostile tribe has stolen some of  his hair. This is quite enough to cause serious illness. If the man  continues sick and gets worse, it is assumed that the hair has been  burnt by his enemy. Such an act, they say, is sufficient to imperil his  life. If the man dies, it is assumed that the thief has choked his  victim and taken away his kidney-fat. When the grave is being dug, one  or more of the older men--generally doctors or conjurors  (_Buk-na-look_)--stand by and attentively watch the laborers; and if an  insect is thrown out of the ground, these old men observe the direction  which it takes, and having determined the line, two of the young men,  relations of the deceased, are despatched in the path indicated, with  instructions to kill the first native they meet, who they are assured  and believe is the person directly chargeable with the crime of causing  the death of their relative. Mr. John Green says that the men of the  Yarra tribe firmly believe that no one ever dies a natural death. A man  or a woman dies because of the wicked arts practised by some member of a  hostile tribe; and they discover the direction in which to search for  the slayer by the movements of a lizard which is seen immediately after  the corpse is interred.\"[25] Again, speaking of the aborigines of  Victoria, another writer observes: \"All deaths from natural causes are  attributed to the machinations of enemies, who are supposed to have  sought for and burned the excrement of the intended victim, which,  according to the general belief, causes a gradual wasting away. The  relatives, therefore, watch the struggling feet of the dying person, as  they point in the direction whence the injury is thought to come, and  serve as a guide to the spot where it should be avenged. This is the  duty of the nearest male relative; should he fail in its execution, it  will ever be to him a reproach, although other relatives may have  avenged the death. If the deceased were a chief, then the duty devolves  upon the tribe. Chosen men are sent in the direction indicated, who kill  the first persons they meet, whether men, women, or children; and the  more lives that are sacrificed, the greater is the honour to the  dead.\"[26] Again, in his account of the Kurnai tribe of Victoria the  late Dr. A. W. Howitt remarks: \"It is not difficult to see how, among  savages, who have no knowledge of the real causes of diseases which are  the common lot of humanity, the very suspicion even of such a thing as  death from disease should be unknown. Death by accident they can  imagine; death by violence they can imagine; but I question if they can,  in their savage condition, imagine death by mere disease. Rheumatism is  believed to be produced by the machinations of some enemy. Seeing a  Tatungolung very lame, I asked him what was the matter? He said, 'Some  fellow has put _bottle_ in my foot.' I asked him to let me see it. I  found he was probably suffering from acute rheumatism. He explained that  some enemy must have found his foot track, and have buried in it a piece  of broken bottle. The magic influence, he believed, caused it to enter  his foot.... Phthisis, pneumonia, bowel complaints, and insanity are  supposed to be produced by an evil spirit--Brewin--'who is like the  wind,' and who, entering his victims, can only be expelled by suitable  incantations.... Thus the belief arises that death occurs only from  accident, open violence, or secret magic; and, naturally, that the  latter can only be met by counter-charms.\"[27]    [Sidenote: Belief of the aborigines of New South Wales in sorcery as the  cause of sickness and death.]    The beliefs and practices of the aborigines of New South Wales in  respect of death were similar. Thus we are told by a well-informed  writer that \"the natives do not believe in death from natural causes;  therefore all sickness is attributed to the agency of sorcery, and  counter charms are used to destroy its effect.... As a man's death is  never supposed to have occurred naturally, except as the result of  accident, or from a wound in battle, the first thing to be done when a  death occurs is to endeavour to find out the person whose spells have  brought about the calamity. In the Wathi-Wathi tribe the corpse is asked  by each relative in succession to signify by some sign the person who  has caused his death. Not receiving an answer, they watch in which  direction a bird flies, after having passed over the deceased. This is  considered an indication that the sorcerer is to be found in that  direction. Sometimes the nearest relative sleeps with his head on the  corpse, which causes him, they think, to dream of the murderer. There  is, however, a good deal of uncertainty about the proceedings, which  seldom result in more than a great display of wrath, and of vowing of  vengeance against some member of a neighbouring tribe. Unfortunately  this is not always the case, the man who is supposed to have exercised  the death-spell being sometimes waylaid and murdered in a most cruel  manner.\"[28] With regard to the great Kamilaroi tribe of New South Wales  we read that \"in some parts of the country a belief prevails that death,  through disease, is, in many, if not in all cases, the result of an  enemy's malice. It is a common saying, when illness or death comes, that  some one has thrown his belt (_boor_) at the victim. There are various  modes of fixing upon the murderer. One is to let an insect fly from the  body of the deceased and see towards whom it goes. The person thus  singled out is doomed.\"[29]    [Sidenote: Belief of the aborigines of Central Australia in sorcery as  the cause of death.]    Speaking of the tribes of Central Australia, Messrs. Spencer and Gillen  observe that \"in the matter of morality their code differs radically  from ours, but it cannot be denied that their conduct is governed by it,  and that any known breaches are dealt with both surely and severely. In  very many cases there takes place what the white man, not seeing beneath  the surface, not unnaturally describes as secret murder, but, in  reality, revolting though such slaughter may be to our minds at the  present day, it is simply exactly on a par with the treatment accorded  to witches not so very long ago in European countries. Every case of  such secret murder, when one or more men stealthily stalk their prey  with the object of killing him, is in reality the exacting of a life for  a life, the accused person being indicated by the so-called medicine-man  as one who has brought about the death of another man by magic, and  whose life must therefore be forfeited. It need hardly be pointed out  what a potent element this custom has been in keeping down the numbers  of the tribe; no such thing as natural death is realised by the native;  a man who dies has of necessity been killed by some other man, or  perhaps even by a woman, and sooner or later that man or woman will be  attacked. In the normal condition of the tribe every death meant the  killing of another individual.\"[30]    [Sidenote: Belief of the natives of the Torres Straits Islands and New  Guinea in sorcery as the cause of death.]    Passing from Australia to other savage lands we learn that according to  the belief of the Torres Straits Islanders all sickness and death were  due to sorcery.[31] The natives of Mowat or Mawatta in British New  Guinea \"do not believe in a natural death, but attribute even the  decease of an old man to the agency of some enemy known or unknown.\"[32]  In the opinion of the tribes about Hood Peninsula in British New Guinea  no one dies a natural death. Every such death is caused by the evil  magic either of a living sorcerer or of a dead relation.[33] Of the  Roro-speaking tribes of British New Guinea Dr. Seligmann writes that  \"except in the case of old folk, death is not admitted to occur without  some obvious cause such as a spear-thrust. Therefore when vigorous and  active members of the community die, it becomes necessary to explain  their fate, and such deaths are firmly believed to be produced by  sorcery. Indeed, as far as I have been able to ascertain, the Papuasian  of this district regards the existence of sorcery, not, as has been  alleged, as a particularly terrifying and horrible affair, but as a  necessary and inevitable condition of existence in the world as he knows  it.\"[34] Amongst the Yabim of German New Guinea \"every case of death,  even though it should happen accidentally, as by the fall of a tree or  the bite of a shark, is laid at the door of the sorcerers. They are  blamed even for the death of a child. If it is said that a little child  never hurt anybody and therefore cannot have an enemy, the reply is that  the intention was to injure the mother, and that the malady had been  transferred to the infant through its mother's milk.\"[35]    [Sidenote: Belief of the Melanesians in sorcery as the cause of sickness  and death.]    Again, in the island of Malo, one of the New Hebrides, a Catholic  missionary reports that according to a belief deeply implanted in the  native mind every disease is the effect of witchcraft, and that nobody  dies a natural death but only as a consequence of violence, poison, or  sorcery.[36] Similarly in New Georgia, one of the Solomon Islands, when  a person is sick, the natives think that he must"]]]
