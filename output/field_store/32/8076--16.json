RICE    Rice is extensively cultivated in the Orient and supplies the  principal food to nearly one-half the population of the entire world.  There is every reason why rice should be a daily article of diet  in planning the menu. It is more nutritious than the potato and it  digests more readily. When properly cooked and served it is an ideal  starchy food.    Unpolished rice contains all the nutritions of the grains, which  is approximately 6 per cent. fat, 8 per cent. protein, 79 per cent.  carbohydrates. The polished variety contains an average of 88  per cent. nutrition. Polished rice has been robbed of its vital  life-giving elements.    Rice is graded for size and condition and then prepared for the trade.  It is known as fancy head rice, choice, prime, good, medium, common  and screenings. Patna rice, the small slender, well-rounded grain, is  in great demand in the East, with the Japan, Siam, Java, Rangoon, and  Passein varieties closely following. In this country the Carolina,  Japan and Honduras are popularly in demand.    The Carolina rice is a large sweet-flavored grain of good color and  appearance. Japanese rice is a thick-bodied, soft-grained variety."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17451"],[0,"Sign Language Among North American Indians Compared With That Among Other (#15)"],[1,"attempted to learn each other's  language; but the husband having taken kindly to the language of  signs, they conversed together by that means with great contentment.  It is also often resorted to in mere laziness, one gesture saving  many words. The gracefulness, ingenuity, and apparent spontaneity of  the greater part of the signs can never be realized until actually  witnessed, and their beauty is much heightened by the free play to  which the arms of these people are accustomed, and the small and  well-shaped hands for which they are remarkable. Among them can seldom  be noticed in literal fact--      The graceless action of a heavy hand--    which the Bastard metaphorically condemns in King John.    The conditions upon which the survival of sign language among  the Indians has depended is well shown by those attending its  discontinuance among certain tribes.    Many instances are known of the discontinuance of gesture speech with  no development in the native language of the gesturers, but from the  invention for intercommunication of one used in common. The Kalapuyas  of Southern Oregon until recently used a sign language, but have  gradually adopted for foreign intercourse the composite tongue,  commonly called the Tsinuk or Chinook jargon, which probably arose for  trade purposes on the Columbia River before the advent of Europeans,  founded on the Tsinuk, Tsihali, Nutka, &c., but now enriched by  English and French terms, and have nearly forgotten their old signs.  The prevalence of this mongrel speech, originating in the same causes  that produced the pigeon-English or _lingua-franca_ of the Orient,  explains the marked scantiness of sign language among the tribes of  the Northwest coast.    Where the Chinook jargon has not extended on the coast to the North,  the Russian language commences, used in the same manner, but it  has not reached so deeply into the interior of the continent as the  Chinook, which has been largely adopted within the region bounded by  the eastern line of Oregon and Washington, and has become known even  to the Pai-Utes of Nevada. The latter, however, while using it with  the Oregonian tribes to their west and north, still keep up sign  language for communication with the Banaks, who have not become so  familiar with the Chinook. The Alaskan tribes on the coast also used  signs not more than a generation ago, as is proved by the fact that  some of the older men can yet converse by this means with the natives  of the interior, whom they occasionally meet. Before the advent of  the Russians the coast tribes traded their dried fish and oil for the  skins and paints of the eastern tribes by visiting the latter, whom  they did not allow to come to the coast, and this trade was conducted  mainly in sign language. The Russians brought a better market, so  the travel to the interior ceased, and with it the necessity for the  signs, which therefore gradually died out, and are little known to  the present generation on the coast, though still continuing in the  interior, where the inhabitants are divided by dialects.    No explanation is needed for the disuse of a language of signs for  the special purpose now in question when the speech of surrounding  civilization is recognized as necessary or important to be acquired,  and gradually becomes known as the best common medium, even before it  is actually spoken by many individuals of the several tribes. When  it has become general, signs, as systematically employed before,  gradually fade away.          THEORIES ENTERTAINED RESPECTING INDIAN SIGNS.      In this paper it is not designed to pronounce upon theories, and  certainly none will be advocated in a spirit of dogmatism. The writer  recognizes that the subject in its novelty specially requires an  objective and not a subjective consideration. His duty is to collect  the facts as they are, and this as soon as possible, since every  year will add to the confusion and difficulty. After the facts are  established the theories will take care of themselves, and their final  enunciation will be in the hands of men more competent than the writer  will ever pretend to be, although his knowledge, after careful study  of all data attainable, may be considerably increased. The mere  collection of facts, however, cannot be prosecuted to advantage  without predetermined rules of judgment, nor can they be classified at  all without the adoption of some principle which involves a tentative  theory. More than a generation ago Baader noticed that scientific  observers only accumulated great masses of separate facts without  establishing more connection between them than an arbitrary and  imperfect classification; and before him Goethe complained of the  indisposition of students of nature to look upon the universe as a  whole. But since the great theory of evolution has been brought to  general notice no one will be satisfied at knowing a fact without also  trying to establish its relation to other facts. Therefore a working  hypothesis, which shall not be held to with tenacity, is not only  allowable but necessary. It is also important to examine with proper  respect the theories advanced by others. Some of these, suggested in  the few publications on the subject and also by correspondents, will  be mentioned.        _NOT CORRELATED WITH MEAGERNESS OF LANGUAGE._    The story has been told by travelers in many parts of the world that  various languages cannot be clearly understood in the dark by their  possessors, using their mother tongue between themselves. The evidence  for this anywhere is suspicious; and when it is asserted, as it  often has been, in reference to some of the tribes of North American  Indians, it is absolutely false, and must be attributed to the error  of travelers who, ignorant of the dialect, never see the natives  except when trying to make themselves intelligible to their visitors  by a practice which they have found by experience to have been  successful with strangers to their tongue, or perhaps when they are  guarding against being overheard by others. Captain Burton, in his  _City of the Saints_, specially states that the Arapahos possess a  very scanty vocabulary, pronounced in a quasi-unintelligible way, and  can hardly converse with one another in the dark. The truth is that  their vocabulary is by no means scanty, and they do converse with each  other with perfect freedom without any gestures when they so please.  The difficulty in speaking or understanding their language is in the  large number of guttural and interrupted sounds which are not helped  by external motions of the mouth and lips in articulation, and the  light gives little advantage to its comprehension so far as concerns  the vocal apparatus, which, in many languages, can be seen as well  as heard, as is proved by the modern deaf-mute practice of artificial  speech. The corresponding story that no white man ever learned Arapaho  is also false. A member of Fremont's party so long ago as 1842 spoke  the language. Burton in the same connection gives a story \"of a  man who, being sent among the Cheyennes to qualify himself for  interpreting, returned in a week and proved his competency; all he  did, however, was to go through the usual pantomime with a running  accompaniment of grunts.\" And he might as well have omitted the  grunts, for he obviously only used sign language. Lieutenant Abert, in  1846-'47, made much more sensible remarks from his actual observation  than Captain Burton repeated at second-hand from a Mormon met by  him at Salt Lake. He said: \"Some persons think that it [the Cheyenne  language] would be incomplete without gesture, because the Indians use  gestures constantly. But I have been assured that the language is in  itself capable of bodying forth any idea to which one may wish to give  utterance.\"    In fact, individuals of those American tribes specially instanced in  these reports as unable to converse without gesture, often, in their  domestic _abandon_, wrap themselves up in robes or blankets with only  breathing holes before the nose, so that no part of the body is seen,  and chatter away for hours, telling long stories. If in daylight  they thus voluntarily deprive themselves of the possibility of making  signs, it is clear that their preference for talks around the fire at  night is explicable by very natural reasons wholly distinct from the  one attributed. The inference, once carelessly made from the free use  of gesture by some of the Shoshonian stock, that their tongue was too  meager for use without signs, is refuted by the now ascertained fact  that their vocabulary is remarkably copious and their parts of speech  better differentiated than those of many people on whom no such  stigma has been affixed. The proof of this was seen in the writer's  experience, when Ouray, the head chief of the Utes, was at Washington,  in the early part of 1880, and after an interview with the Secretary  of the Interior made report of it to the rest of the delegation who  had not been present. He spoke without pause in his own language for  nearly an hour, in a monotone and without a single gesture. The reason  for this depressed manner was undoubtedly because he was very sad at  the result, involving loss of land and change of home; but the fact  remains that full information was communicated on a complicated  subject without the aid of a manual sign, and also without even  such change of inflection of voice as is common among Europeans. All  theories based upon the supposed poverty of American languages must be  abandoned.    The grievous accusation against foreign people that they have no  intelligible language is venerable and general. With the Greeks  the term [Greek: aglossos], \"tongueless,\" was used synonymous with  [Greek: barbaros], \"barbarian\" of all who were not Greek. The name  \"Slav,\" assumed by a grand division of the Aryan family, means \"the  speaker,\" and is"]]]
