Later a  Catholic party was organized in Germany to bring political pressure on the  German Chancellor. All, however, was in vain. The mighty process already  referred to had to pursue inexorably its course. Even now, after the lapse  of above half a century, the so-called restoration of temporal sovereignty  has but served to throw into greater relief the helplessness of this  erstwhile potent Prince, at whose name kings trembled and to whose dual  sovereignty they willingly submitted. This temporal sovereignty,  practically confined to the miniscule City of the Vatican, and leaving  Rome the undisputed possession of a secular monarchy, has been obtained at  the price of unreserved recognition, so long withheld, of the Kingdom of  Italy. The Treaty of the Lateran, claiming to have resolved once and for  all the Roman Question, has indeed assured to a secular Power, in respect  of the Enclaved City, a liberty of action which is fraught with  uncertainty and peril. \"The two souls of the Eternal City,\" a Catholic  writer has observed, \"have been separated from each other, only to collide  more severely than ever before.\"    Well might the Sovereign Pontiff recall the reign of the most powerful  among his predecessors, Innocent III who, during the eighteen years of his  pontificate, raised and deposed the kings and the emperors, whose  interdicts deprived nations of the exercise of Christian worship, at the  feet of whose legate the King of England surrendered his crown, and at  whose voice the fourth and the fifth crusades were both undertaken.    Might not the process, to which reference has already been made, manifest,  in the course of its operation, during the tumultuous years in store for  mankind, and in this same domain, a commotion still more devastating than  it has yet produced?    The dramatic collapse of both the Third Empire and the Napoleonic dynasty,  the virtual extinction of the temporal sovereignty of the Supreme Pontiff,  in the lifetime of Baha'u'llah, were but the precursors of still greater  catastrophes that may be said to have marked the ministry of 'Abdu'l-Baha.  The forces unleashed by a conflict, the full significance of which still  remains unfathomed, and which may be considered as a prelude to this, the  most devastating of all wars, can well be regarded as the occasion of  these dreadful catastrophes. The progress of the War of 1914-18 dethroned  the House of Romanov, while its termination precipitated the downfall of  both the Hapsburg and Hohenzollern dynasties.            THE RISE OF BOLSHEVISM      The rise of Bolshevism, born amidst the fires of that inconclusive  struggle, shook the throne of the Czars and overthrew it. Alexander II  Nicolaevich, whom Baha'u'llah had commanded in His Tablet to \"arise ...  and summon the nations unto God,\" who had been thrice warned: \"beware lest  thy desire deter thee from turning towards the face of thy Lord,\" \"beware  lest thou barter away this sublime station,\" \"beware lest thy sovereignty  withhold thee from Him Who is the Supreme Sovereign,\" was not indeed the  last of the Czars to rule his country, but rather the inaugurator of a  retrogressive policy which in the end proved fatal to both himself and his  dynasty.    In the latter part of his reign he initiated a reactionary policy which,  causing widespread disillusionment, gave rise to Nihilism, which, as it  spread, ushered in a period of terrorism of unexampled violence, leading  in its turn to several attempts on his life, and culminating in his  assassination. Stern repression guided the policy of his successor,  Alexander III, who \"assumed an attitude of defiant hostility to innovators  and liberals.\" The tradition of unqualified absolutism, of extreme  religious orthodoxy was maintained by the still more severe Nicolas II,  the last of the Czars, who, guided by the counsels of a man who was \"the  very incarnation of a narrow-minded, stiff-necked despotism,\" and aided by  a corrupt bureaucracy, and humiliated by the disastrous effects of a  foreign war, increased the general discontent of the masses, both  intellectuals and peasants. Driven for a time into subterranean channels,  and intensified by military reverses, it exploded at last in the midst of  the Great War, in the form of a Revolution which, in the principles it  challenged, the institutions it subverted, and the havoc it wrought, has  scarcely a parallel in modern history.    A great trembling seized and rocked the foundations of that country. The  light of religion was dimmed. Ecclesiastical institutions of every  denomination were swept away. The state religion was disendowed,  persecuted, and abolished. A far-flung empire was dismembered. A militant,  triumphant proletariat exiled the intellectuals, and plundered and  massacred the nobility. Civil war and disease decimated a population,  already in the throes of agony and despair. And, finally, the Chief  Magistrate of a mighty dominion, together with his consort, and his  family, and his dynasty, were swept into the vortex of this great  convulsion, and perished.    The very ordeal that heaped such dire misfortunes on the empire of the  Czars brought about, in its concluding stages, the fall of the almighty  German Kaiser as well as that of the inheritor of the once famed Holy  Roman Empire. It shattered the whole fabric of Imperial Germany, which  arose out of the disaster that engulfed the Napoleonic dynasty, and dealt  the Dual Monarchy its death blow.    Almost half a century before, Baha'u'llah, Who had predicted, in clear and  resounding terms, the ignominious fall of the successor of the great  Napoleon, had, in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, addressed to Kaiser William I, the  newly acclaimed victor, a no less significant warning, and prophesied, in  His apostrophe to the banks of the Rhine, in words equally unambiguous,  the mourning that would afflict the capital of the newly federated empire.    \"Do thou remember,\" Baha'u'llah thus addressed him, \"the one [Napoleon]  whose power transcended thy power, and whose station excelled thy  station.... Think deeply, O king, concerning him, and concerning them who,  like unto thee, have conquered cities and ruled over men.\" And again: \"O  banks of the Rhine! We have seen you covered with gore, inasmuch as the  swords of retribution were drawn against you; and you shall have another  turn. And We hear the lamentations of Berlin, though she be today in  conspicuous glory.\"    On him who, in his old age, sustained two attempts upon his life by the  advocates of the rising tide of socialism; on his son Frederick III, whose  three months' reign was overshadowed by mortal disease; and finally on his  grandson, William II, the self-willed and overweening monarch and wrecker  of his own empire--on these fell, in varying degrees, the full weight of  the responsibilities consequent to these dire pronouncements.    William I, first German Emperor and seventh king of Prussia, whose entire  lifetime had, up to the date of his accession, been spent in the army, was  a militaristic, autocratic ruler, imbued with antiquated ideas, who  initiated, with the aid of a statesman rightly regarded as \"one of the  geniuses of his century,\" a policy which may be said to have inaugurated a  new era not only for Prussia but for the world. This policy was pursued  with characteristic thoroughness and perfected through the repressive  measures that were taken to safeguard and uphold it, through the wars that  were waged for its realization, and the political combinations that were  subsequently formed to exalt and consolidate it, combinations that were  fraught with such dreadful consequences to the European continent.    William II, temperamentally dictatorial, politically inexperienced,  militarily aggressive, religiously insincere, posed as the apostle of  European peace, yet actually insisted on \"the mailed fist\" and \"the  shining armor.\" Irresponsible, indiscreet, inordinately ambitious, his  first act was to dismiss that sagacious statesman, the true founder of his  empire, to whose sagacity Baha'u'llah had paid tribute, and to the  unwisdom of whose imperial and ungrateful master 'Abdu'l-Baha had  testified. War indeed became a religion of his country, and by enlarging  the scope of his multifarious activities, he proceeded to prepare the way  for that final catastrophe that was to dethrone him and his dynasty. And  when the war broke out, and the might of his armies seemed to have  overpowered his adversaries, and the news of his triumphs was noised  abroad, reverberating as far as Persia, voices were raised ridiculing  those passages of the Kitab-i-Aqdas which so clearly foreshadowed the  misfortunes that were to befall his capital. Suddenly, however, swift and  unforeseen reverses fatally overtook him. Revolution broke out. William  II, deserting his armies, fled ignominiously to Holland, followed by the  Crown Prince. The princes of the German states abdicated. A period of  chaos ensued. The communist flag was hoisted in the capital, which became  a caldron of confusion and civil strife. The Kaiser signed his abdication.  The Constitution of Weimar established the Republic, bringing the  tremendous structure, so elaborately reared through a policy of blood and  iron, crashing to the ground. All the efforts to that end, which through  internal legislation and foreign wars had, ever since the accession of  William I to the Prussian throne, been assiduously exerted, came to  naught. \"The lamentations of Berlin,\" tortured by the terms of a treaty  monstrous in its severity, were raised, contrasting with the hilarious  shouts of victory that rang, half a century before, in the Hall of Mirrors  of the Palace of Versailles.    The Hapsburg monarch, heir of centuries of glorious history,  simultaneously toppled from his throne. It was Francis Joseph, whom  Baha'u'llah chided in the Kitab-i-Aqdas for having failed in his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19284"],[0,"Paris Talks (#15)"],[1," blessings upon us, and to choose rather to be slaves of matter?    God in His infinite goodness has exalted us to so much honour, and has  made us masters over the material world. Shall we then become her slaves?  Nay, rather let us claim our birthright, and strive to live the life of  the spiritual sons of God. The glorious Sun of Truth has once again risen  in the East. From the far horizon of Persia its radiance is spreading far  and wide, dispersing the dense clouds of superstition. The light of the  unity of mankind is beginning to illumine the world, and soon the banner  of Divine harmony and the solidarity of nations will be flying high in the  Heavens. Yea, the breezes of the Holy Spirit will inspire the whole world!    Oh, peoples and nations! Arise and work and be happy! Gather together  under the tent of the unity of mankind!          PAIN AND SORROW      November 22nd    In this world we are influenced by two sentiments, Joy and Pain.    Joy gives us wings! In times of joy our strength is more vital, our  intellect keener, and our understanding less clouded. We seem better able  to cope with the world and to find our sphere of usefulness. But when  sadness visits us we become weak, our strength leaves us, our  comprehension is dim and our intelligence veiled. The actualities of life  seem to elude our grasp, the eyes of our spirits fail to discover the  sacred mysteries, and we become even as dead beings.    There is no human being untouched by these two influences; but all the  sorrow and the grief that exist come from the world of matter--the  spiritual world bestows only the joy!    If we suffer it is the outcome of material things, and all the trials and  troubles come from this world of illusion.    For instance, a merchant may lose his trade and depression ensues. A  workman is dismissed and starvation stares him in the face. A farmer has a  bad harvest, anxiety fills his mind. A man builds a house which is burnt  to the ground and he is straightway homeless, ruined, and in despair.    All these examples are to show you that the trials which beset our every  step, all our sorrow, pain, shame and grief, are born in the world of  matter; whereas the spiritual Kingdom never causes sadness. A man living  with his thoughts in this Kingdom knows perpetual joy. The ills all flesh  is heir to do not pass him by, but they only touch the surface of his  life, the depths are calm and serene.    Today, humanity is bowed down with trouble, sorrow and grief, no one  escapes; the world is wet with tears; but, thank God, the remedy is at our  doors. Let us turn our hearts away from the world of matter and live in  the spiritual world! It alone can give us freedom! If we are hemmed in by  difficulties we have only to call upon God, and by His great Mercy we  shall be helped.    If sorrow and adversity visit us, let us turn our faces to the Kingdom and  heavenly consolation will be outpoured.    If we are sick and in distress let us implore God's healing, and He will  answer our prayer.    When our thoughts are filled with the bitterness of this world, let us  turn our eyes to the sweetness of God's compassion and He will send us  heavenly calm! If we are imprisoned in the material world, our spirit can  soar into the Heavens and we shall be free indeed!    When our days are drawing to a close let us think of the eternal worlds,  and we shall be full of joy!    You see all round you proofs of the inadequacy of material things--how joy,  comfort, peace and consolation are not to be found in the transitory  things of the world. Is it not then foolishness to refuse to seek these  treasures where they may be found? The doors of the spiritual Kingdom are  open to all, and without is absolute darkness.    Thank God that you in this assembly have this knowledge, for in all the  sorrows of life you can obtain supreme consolation. If your days on earth  are numbered, you know that everlasting life awaits you. If material  anxiety envelops you in a dark cloud, spiritual radiance lightens your  path. Verily, those whose minds are illumined by the Spirit of the Most  High have supreme consolation.    I myself was in prison forty years--one year alone would have been  impossible to bear--nobody survived that imprisonment more than a year!  But, thank God, during all those forty years I was supremely happy! Every  day, on waking, it was like hearing good tidings, and every night infinite  joy was mine. Spirituality was my comfort, and turning to God was my  greatest joy. If this had not been so, do you think it possible that I  could have lived through those forty years in prison?    Thus, spirituality is the greatest of God's gifts, and 'Life Everlasting'  means 'Turning to God'. May you, one and all, increase daily in  spirituality, may you be strengthened in all goodness, may you be helped  more and more by the Divine consolation, be made free by the Holy Spirit  of God, and may the power of the Heavenly Kingdom live and work among you.    This is my earnest desire, and I pray to God to grant you this favour.          THE PERFECT HUMAN SENTIMENTS AND VIRTUES      November 23rd    'Abdu'l-Baha said:    You should all be very happy and thankful to God for the great privilege  that is yours.    This is purely a spiritual meeting! Praise be to God, your hearts are  turned to Him, your souls are attracted to the Kingdom, you have spiritual  aspirations, and your thoughts soar above the world of dust.    You belong to the world of purity, and are not content to live the life of  the animal, spending your days in eating, drinking, and sleeping. You are  indeed men! Your thoughts and ambitions are set to acquire human  perfection. You live to do good and to bring happiness to others. Your  greatest longing is to comfort those who mourn, to strengthen the weak,  and to be the cause of hope to the despairing soul. Day and night your  thoughts are turned to the Kingdom, and your hearts are full of the Love  of God.    Thus you know neither opposition, dislike, nor hatred, for every living  creature is dear to you and the good of each is sought.    These are perfect human sentiments and virtues. If a man has none of  these, he had better cease to exist. If a lamp has ceased to give light,  it had better be destroyed. If a tree bear no fruit, it had better be cut  down, for it only cumbereth the ground.    Verily, it is better a thousand times for a man to die than to continue  living without virtue.    We have eyes wherewith to see, but if we do not use them how do they  profit us? We have ears wherewith to hear, but if we are deaf of what use  are they?    We have a tongue wherewith to praise God and proclaim the good tidings,  but if we are dumb how useless it is!    The All-loving God created man to radiate the Divine light and to illumine  the world by his words, action and life. If he is without virtue he  becomes no better than a mere animal, and an animal devoid of intelligence  is a vile thing.    The Heavenly Father gave the priceless gift of intelligence to man so that  he might become a spiritual light, piercing the darkness of materiality,  and bringing goodness and truth into the world. If ye will follow  earnestly the teachings of Baha'u'llah, ye shall indeed become the light  of the world, the soul for the body of the world, the comfort and help for  humanity, and the source of salvation for the whole universe. Strive  therefore, with heart and soul, to follow the precepts of the Blessed  Perfection, and rest assured that if ye succeed in living the life he  marks out for you, Eternal Life and everlasting joy in the Heavenly  Kingdom will be yours, and celestial sustenance will be sent to strengthen  you all your days.    It is my heartfelt prayer that each one of you may attain to this perfect  joy!          THE CRUEL INDIFFERENCE OF PEOPLE TOWARDS THE SUFFERING OF FOREIGN RACES      November 24th    'Abdu'l-Baha said:    I have just been told that there has been a terrible accident in this  country. A train has fallen into the river and at least twenty people have  been killed. This is going to be a matter for discussion in the French  Parliament today, and the Director of the State Railway will be called  upon to speak. He will be cross-examined as to the condition of the  railroad and as to what caused the accident, and there will be a heated  argument. I am filled with wonder and surprise to notice what interest and  excitement has been aroused throughout the whole country on account of the  death of twenty people, while they remain cold and indifferent to the fact  that thousands of Italians, Turks, and Arabs are killed in Tripoli! The  horror of this wholesale slaughter has not disturbed the Government at  all! Yet these unfortunate people are human beings too.    Why is there so much interest and eager sympathy shown towards these  twenty individuals, while for five thousand persons there is none? They  are all men, they all belong to the family of mankind, but they are of  other lands and races. It is no concern of the disinterested countries if  these men are cut to pieces, this wholesale slaughter does not affect  them! How unjust, how cruel is this, how utterly devoid of any good and  true feeling! The people of these other lands have children and wives,  mothers, daughters, and little sons! In these countries today there is  hardly a house free from the sound of bitter weeping, scarcely can one  find a home untouched by the cruel hand of war.    Alas! we see on all sides how cruel, prejudiced and unjust is man, and how  slow he is to believe in God and follow His commandments.    If these people would love and help one another instead of being so eager  to destroy with sword and cannon, how much nobler would it be! How much  better if they would live like a flock of doves in peace and harmony,  instead of being like wolves and tearing each other to pieces.    Why is man so hard of heart? It is because"]]]
