All but one of the visiting brethren were  also locked in, and he had a narrow escape from the mob outside who soon  collected and made all kinds of threats against the prisoners.    The visitors now thought that they also were in great danger, but Joseph  told them not to fear, as not a hair of their heads would be injured. This  promise came true, because at a trial they had next day they were all set  free and nothing was taken from them.    April 6, 1839, the prisoners were ordered to Gallatin, Daviess county.  After their long confinement the brethren were weak, and it was hard to  stand the long journey. On the 9th they had another trial or hearing. The  jury consisted mainly of men who had taken part in the Haun's Mill  massacre, and most of the time during the trial they were drunk. The  presiding officer, Judge King, was also as bad as the jury. This mock trial  continued for several days. Men who sat on the jury during the day acted as  guards at night, where they boasted of their murders, thefts, etc., to the  prisoners. This trial resulted in the brethren being held for \"murder,  treason, burglary, arson, larceny, theft, and stealing.\"    The prisoners now asked for a change of venue, that is, a change of place  of trial. This was granted, and on April 15 they started for Boone county  under guard of the sheriff and four men. On the night of the 16th the  sheriff told them he was going to take a drink of grog before going to bed  and they could do as they pleased. The sheriff and three of the guards went  to bed drunk, and the other guard helped the brethren saddle the horses and  get away. They traveled day and night, and after much suffering Joseph  arrived at the city of Quincy, Illinois, April 22, 1839, where he was  gladly welcomed by his family and friends.    Topics.--1.

From his prison in Missouri, Joseph had advised his brethren to buy land in  the state of Illinois and Iowa. Towards these states, therefore, the Saints  had fled, leaving merciless, blood-stained Missouri to the judgment of God.    Twenty years afterwards when the great war broke out between the North and  the South, Missouri was one of the fiercest battle grounds, and its people  suffered terribly for the misery and bloodshed they had brought upon the  Saints.    The people of Illinois received the homeless Saints kindly, and sold them  land upon which to live. At a small place called Commerce, situated on the  east bank of the Mississippi river, Joseph bought land, and there he  decided to locate the headquarters of the Church. The place was beautifully  situated in a bend of the river. Here a city was laid out and called  Nauvoo, meaning beauty and rest, and Joseph invited the Saints to settle  and build up the place. It was no small task to gather the scattered Saints  into one body again, but early in the summer of 1839 a number of houses  were erected in the new city.    [Illustration: THE NAUVOO HOUSE.]    Now came another trouble. Commerce was not a healthful place, but the  Saints were promised that that would be changed; however, it was not long  before a great many of the Saints became sick. Nearly every house was  afflicted, and Joseph himself also took the fever. On the morning of July  22nd, Joseph arose from his bed and commenced administering to the sick. He  began with those in his own house, then went to some camping in his yard.  The Prophet commanded the sick in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to  arise from their beds and be made whole, and the sick were healed on ever  side. He then went from house to house and from tent to tent upon the bank  of the river, healing the people. Many wonderful healings were performed.  Joseph would take the sick person by the hand, or stand in the door of the  tent and command the afflicted person to arise and be made whole. The  Prophet with some of the brethren who were now with him crossed the river  to the place where Brigham Young was lying ill. President Young was soon  healed and followed with the rest. As there were many whom the Prophet  could not reach, the Twelve were sent to administer to them. Joseph gave  Wilford Woodruff a silk handkerchief which he was to use in healing some  children. President Woodruff kept the handkerchief to the day of his death.    After this, there was very little sickness in Nauvoo. During the summer and  fall of 1839 the city grew rapidly. About this time seven of the Twelve  left for their mission to England, of which you have been told, and the  English Saints soon began to gather to Nauvoo.    Late in October, 1839, Joseph went to the city of Washington to lay the  troubles of the Church before the authorities of the nation. Joseph made  the acquaintance of many leading men, among them John C. Calhoun, and  Henry Clay. Martin Van Buren was president, and to him Joseph told of the  wrongs they had suffered from the people of Missouri. It was then that the  president made the famous remark: \"Your cause is just, but I can do nothing  for you.\" His meaning, no doubt, was that the president of the United  States had no right to interfere with the affairs of a state; but that all  such troubles should be settled by the state itself.    [Illustration: THE NAUVOO MANSION.]    So Joseph returned without any help. Meanwhile, Nauvoo grew into a large  city. Ten wards were laid off and organized. April 6, 1841, the corner  stone of the temple was laid. Many public buildings were erected. Good  houses were built, and beautiful gardens soon bloomed around them. On the  outskirts of the city, fields of grain stretched as far as the eye could  reach. In 1842 there were 20,000 people in the city, and Nauvoo promised to  be one of the largest cities in the West.    The fame of Joseph and the \"Mormon\" city spread, and many people came to  see the wonder. Missionaries were sent out to preach, the _Times and  Seasons_ published by the Church, printed many Gospel truths and much  important history. The militia was organized and the city had a  well-drilled body of men called the Nauvoo Legion. Peace and prosperity  smiled upon them for a season, and it seemed that at last there would be a  permanent stake of Zion established.    But it was not to be. The hate that burned in the hearts of evil men had  not grown less, but was only waiting for a chance to show itself. Trouble  again arose. It would not be easy to understand the many causes that led to  these troubles, but a few may be noted.    The Saints now had great power at the polls, the same as in Missouri. The  \"Mormons\" would not vote for men who would not give them their rights, and  so many of these politicians became their enemies and stirred up the people  against the Saints by their many lies. Then, there were the jealousies of  the sectarian preachers; and perhaps worse than all, the evil work of  apostates. Then it happened that a band of thieves troubled the  neighborhood, and of course the \"Mormons\" were blamed. It was not a hard  matter to find excuses for a further persecution of the Latter-day Saints.    And now came again Governor Boggs, of Missouri. He, it seems, had not had  enough, so he asked Governor Carlin to deliver to him Joseph and the other  brethren who had escaped from Missouri. Governor Carlin of Illinois, made  out the papers for the brethren's arrest, but the officer could not find  them when he went to Nauvoo. He therefore returned without his prisoners,  and nothing more was done in the matter until nearly a year later, when  Joseph was visiting the governor at Quincy. Governor Carlin treated Joseph  kindly, but as soon as the Prophet had left, some of the officers were sent  after him. They overtook Joseph and arrested him on the old charge from  Missouri. However, they went on to Nauvoo, where the sheriff, being sick,  was taken good care of by his prisoner. As it was Joseph's right by law to  be tried in Illinois, he was permitted to have a hearing before Judge  Stephen A. Douglas, in Monmouth, Illinois. There was great excitement at  the trial, some of his enemies trying to excite a mob against him. At the  close of the hearing Joseph was set free by the judge.    Dr. J.C. Bennett was the mayor of Nauvoo, and held other high positions;  but he proved to be a very wicked man. At one time, when the Legion was  having a sham fight, Bennett tried to get Joseph into a position that he  might be shot without anyone knowing who did it. This did not succeed. Then  he began to commit sin, and say that Joseph upheld him in it. Bennett was  of course cut off from the Church, after which he wrote many false things  against Joseph and the Saints and was the means of bringing much  persecution on them.    In May, 1842, Ex-Governor Boggs of Missouri was shot at and wounded by some  person in Independence. Although at this time they were hundreds of miles  from Independence, Joseph Smith and O.P. Rockwell were charged with this  crime, and again papers were issued for their arrest. They were tried in  Nauvoo and acquitted. As the Missourians were trying many schemes to take  Joseph to Missouri and there kill him, he went in hiding for a time. Every  effort was made to take Joseph, and rewards were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16545"],[0,"King Alfred of England (#15)"],[1," care of theirs; and that he would have done very wrong to sacrifice  the property and lives of his own immediate subjects to a mere point  of honor, when it was utterly out of his power to protect them and his  neighbors too.    However this may be, Buthred, finding that he could not have Alfred's  aid, and that he could not protect his kingdom by any force which he  could himself bring into the field, tried negotiations too, and he  succeeded in buying off the Danes with money. He paid them a large  sum, on condition of their leaving his dominions finally and forever,  and not coming to molest him any more. Such a measure as this is  always a very desperate and hopeless one. Buying off robbers, or  beggars, or false accusers, or oppressors of any kind, is only to  encourage them to come again, after a brief interval, under some  frivolous pretext, with fresh demands or new oppressions, that they  may be bought off again with higher pay. At least Buthred found it so  in this case. Hubba went northward for a time, into the kingdom of  Northumberland, and, after various conquests and plunderings there, he  came back again into Mercia, on the plea that there was a scarcity of  provisions in the northern kingdom, and he was _obliged_ to come  back. Buthred bought him off again with a larger sum of money. Hubba  scarcely left the kingdom this time, but spent the money with his  army, in carousings and excesses, and then went to robbing and  plundering as before. Buthred, at last, reduced to despair, and seeing  no hope of escape from the terrible pest with which his kingdom was  infested, abandoned the country and escaped to Rome. They received him  as an exiled monarch, in the Saxon school, where he soon after died a  prey to grief and despair.    The Danes overturned what remained of Buthred's government. They  destroyed a famous mausoleum, the ancient burial place of the Mercian  kings. This devastation of the abodes of the dead was a sort of  recreation--a savage amusement, to vary the more serious and dangerous  excitements attending their contests with the living. They found an  officer of Buthred's government named Ceolwulf, who, though a Saxon,  was willing, through his love of place and power, to accept of the  office of king in subordination to the Danes, and hold it at their  disposal, paying an annual tribute to them. Ceolwulf was execrated  by his countrymen, who considered him a traitor. He, in his turn,  oppressed and tyrannized over them.    In the mean time, a new leader, with a fresh horde of Danes, had  landed in England. His name was Halfden. Halfden came with a  considerable fleet of ships, and, after landing his men, and  performing various exploits and encountering various adventures in  other parts of England, he began to turn his thoughts toward Alfred's  dominions. Alfred did not pay particular attention to Halfden's  movements at first, as he supposed that his treaty with Hubba had  bound the whole nation of the Danes not to encroach upon _his_ realm,  whatever they might do in respect to the other Saxon kingdoms. Alfred  had a famous castle at Wareham, on the southern coast of the island.  It was situated on a bay which lies in what is now Dorsetshire. This  castle was the strongest place in his dominions. It was garrisoned and  guarded, but not with any special vigilance, as no one expected an  attack upon it. Halfden brought his fleet to the southern shore of the  island, and, organizing an expedition there, he put to sea, and before  any one suspected his design, he entered the bay, surprised and  attacked Wareham Castle, and took it. Alfred and the people of his  realm were not only astonished and alarmed at the loss of the castle,  but they were filled with indignation at the treachery of the Danes in  violating their treaty by attacking it. Halfden said, however, that  he was an independent chieftain, acting in his own name, and was not  bound at all by any obligations entered into by Hubba!    There followed after this a series of contests and truces, during  which treacherous wars alternated with still more treacherous and  illusive periods of peace, neither party, on the whole, gaining  any decided victory. The Danes, at one time, after agreeing upon a  cessation of hostilities, suddenly fell upon a large squadron of  Alfred's horse, who, relying on the truce, were moving across the  country too much off their guard. The Danes dismounted and drove off  the men, and seized the horses, and thus provided themselves with  cavalry, a species of force which it is obvious they could not easily  bring, in any ships which they could then construct, across the German  Ocean. Without waiting for Alfred to recover from the surprise  and consternation which this unexpected treachery occasioned, the  newly-mounted troop of Danes rode rapidly along the southern coast of  England till they came to the town of Exeter. Its name was in those  days Exancester. It was then, as it is now, a very important town. It  has since acquired a mournful celebrity as the place of refuge, and  the scene of suffering of Queen Henrietta Maria, the mother of Charles  the Second.[1] The loss of this place was a new and heavy cloud over  Alfred's prospects. It placed the whole southern coast of his realm in  the hands of his enemies, and seemed to portend for the whole interior  of the country a period of hopeless and irremediable calamity.    It seems, too, from various unequivocal statements and allusions  contained in the narratives of the times, that Alfred did not possess,  during this period of his reign, the respect and affection of his  subjects. He is accused, or, rather, not directly accused, but spoken  of as generally known to be guilty of many faults which alienated the  hearts of his countrymen from him, and prepared them to consider his  calamities as the judgments of Heaven. He was young and ardent, full  of youthful impetuosity and fire, and was elated at his elevation to  the throne; and, during the period while the Danes left him in peace,  under the treaties he had made with Hubba, he gave himself up to  pleasure, and not always to innocent pleasure. They charged him, too,  with being tyrannical and oppressive in his government, being so  devoted to gratifying his own ambition and love of personal indulgence  that he neglected his government, sacrificed the interests and the  welfare of his subjects, and exercised his regal powers in a very  despotic and arbitrary manner.    It is very difficult to decide, at this late day how far this  disposition to find fault with Alfred's early administration of his  government arose from, or was aggravated by, the misfortunes and  calamities which befell him. On the one hand, it would not be  surprising if, young, and arduous, and impetuous as he was at this  period of his life, he should have fallen into the errors and faults  which youthful monarchs are very prone to commit on being suddenly  raised to power. But then, on the other hand, men are prone, in all  ages of the world, and most especially in such rude and uncultivated  times as these were, to judge military and governmental action by  the sole criterion of success. Thus, when they found that Alfred's  measures, one after another, failed in protecting his country, that  the impending calamities burst successively upon them, notwithstanding  all Alfred's efforts to avert them, it was natural that they should  look at and exaggerate his faults, and charge all their national  misfortunes to the influence of them.    There was a certain Saint Neot, a kinsman and religious counselor of  Alfred, the history of whose life was afterward written by the  Abbot of Crowland, the monastery whose destruction by the Danes was  described in a former chapter. In this narrative it is said that Neot  often rebuked Alfred in the severest terms for his sinful course of  life, predicting the most fatal consequences if he did not reform, and  using language which only a very culpable degree of remissness and  irregularity could justify. \"You glory,\" said he, one day, when  addressing the king, \"in your pride and power, and are determined and  obdurate in your iniquity. But there is a terrible retribution in  store for you. I entreat you to listen to my counsels, amend your  life, and govern your people with moderation and justice, instead of  tyranny and oppression, and thus avert if you can, before it is too  late, the impending judgments of Heaven.\"    Such language as this it is obvious that only a very serious  dereliction of duty on Alfred's part could call for or justify; but,  whatever he may have done to deserve it, his offenses were so fully  expiated by his subsequent sufferings, and he atoned for them so  nobly, too, by the wisdom, the prudence, the faithful and devoted  patriotism of his later career, that mankind have been disposed to  pass by the faults of his early years without attempting to scrutinize  them too closely. The noblest human spirits are always, in some  periods of their existence, or in some aspects of their characters,  strangely weakened by infirmities and frailties, and deformed by sin.  This is human nature. We like to imagine that we find exceptions,  and to see specimens of moral perfection in our friends or in the  historical characters whose general course of action we admire; but  there are no exceptions. To err and to sin, at some times and in some  ways, is the common, universal, and inevitable lot of humanity.    At the time when Halfden and his followers seized Wareham Castle and  Exeter, Alfred had been several years upon the throne, during which  time these derelictions from duty took place, so far as they existed  at all. But now, alarmed at the imminence of the impending danger,  which threatened not only the welfare of his people, but his own  kingdom and even his life--for one Saxon monarch had been driven from  his dominions, as we have seen, and had died a miserable"]]]
