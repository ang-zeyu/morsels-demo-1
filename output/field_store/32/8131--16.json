I show you a  sample rather above the average, and the retail price for this  inferior article was 22s. per gross. All at once the Americans deluged  the English market with the pulley which I now show to you, and it  needs no explanation of mine to satisfy the mechanical minds present  of the superiority of the transatlantic article; but when we also bear  in mind that the price of the American was from 25 to 33 per cent less  than the English pulley, you can understand how the builders exulted,  and how the Volscians of the Birmingham district were fluttered. Then,  and not till then, would the English maker condescend to believe that  it was possible to improve upon the wretched things which he had  foisted upon his customers, and he at once commenced to copy the  American pulley. He has not yet succeeded in producing such a  beautiful casting, but I venture to say that he has improved the  quality more in the last eighteen months than in the previous eighteen  years.    Now take the ordinary door furniture. For generations the English  builder and householder has had to be content with the stereotyped,  with all its aggravating propensities. First, the little screw (so  small as to be scarcely perceptible to touch or to sight) shakes loose  from its countersunk depression in the spindle, gets lost, and lets  the knob go adrift; or next, the knob itself, formed of a bit of sheet  brass, turns round on its shank and the door cannot be opened, or the  shank, not having a sufficient bearing on the spindle, works loose,  and the whole thing is out of repair. It is the same thing to-day as  it was when it tormented my grandfather; for, of course, no  improvement could be made until Uncle Sam sent us his cheap, strong,  serviceable, and sensible \"Mineral Knob.\"    The English maker says: \"But look at the many devices which we have  invented for door furniture.\" Granted, and some of them very good, but  none of them so good as this--for the money. Plenty of them well  adapted for extraordinary use, but none of them cheap enough and  strong enough to be placed in competition with this in fitting up the  dwelling of the ordinary Englishman. The spindle and furniture of a  lock is the portion which is liable to and receives the most rough  usage.    I have here an ordinary cheap set of china furniture of English make,  which I dare not drop lest I should break it, but as you see, I dare  throw its Yankee competitor the whole length of this room. The retail  price of this English set is ninepence--the price of the American is  less than sixpence. The English spindle is fitted with the usual  little screw, the knob is loose, the roses are china, and liable to  break with the least strain or blow. The American set, as you see, has  a long shank; the form of the knob is a very oblate spheroid, giving a  good grip and free play for the fingers between the knob and the door.  The rose is japanned iron, and has small studs or teeth projecting on  its inner side effectually preventing it from turning round with the  spindle; the screw is strong, and is tapped through the spindle  itself, insuring both security and perfect steadiness. Several small  washers are supplied with each spindle, enabling the slack to be taken  up perfectly, and at the same time preventing the spindle from  sticking with any ordinary amount of friction.    I will now show you a cheap American rim lock. First, you will notice  that both sides are alike. Next, that by pulling the latch forward it  can be turned half round, and is thereby converted from a right hand  to a left hand, or _vice versa_, in an instant. This is an important  point to a builder, but our lockmakers do not seem to know it. Several  attempts have been made to introduce locks of this kind, but the fancy  prices put upon every article which departs, in ever so slight a  measure, from the antediluvian patterns mostly used, practically  prohibits their adoption. The carcass of the lock is of cast iron; the  casting, like all the small American castings, is simply perfect;  bosses are cast round the follower and keyholes; the box staple is one  piece of metal, neat and strong.    But there is another point, and, to my mind, the most important one.  Whatever opinions may be held as to the relative quality of this lock,  whether it is better or worse than an English one, it is at least an  honest article. It makes no pretensions to be any better than it is.  It does not entrap the unwary purchaser by pretending to be a  first-class article, when at the same time it may be a swindle.    I will now show you an ordinary 6 inch rim-lock of English  manufacture. At a short distance it looks like a superior article; the  follower and keyhole appear as if they were bushed with brass. But let  us take it to pieces, and see what we can find. The follower is a  rough casting, not turned at the bearings, and is in no sense a fit.  The screw holes are not countersunk, but merely punched in; the key is  of the roughest and worst fitting description; the inside is as rough  and cheap as possible; the key is cut so as to deceive the purchaser  into the belief that there are twice as many wards in the lock as is  really the case, and the bushes prove to be thin plates of brass  riveted on, and not bushes at all. In short, the whole article is a  vile fraud, and the maker was a swindler. This is strong language, but  I think you will agree with me when I maintain that it is not stronger  than the circumstances warrant.    But there are still its defects of bad design and useless workmanship.  The lock is of the usual form given to the English rim-lock, that is,  it has a flange which requires to be let into the edge of the door. I  have fixed hundreds of them, and have never yet been able to see a use  for this flange. It is one great obstacle to the general introduction  of a reversible lock; it adds to the labor of fixing without adding to  the security of the door, for if the door is to be forced from the  outside, the box staples give way first; if from the inside, the  unscrewing of the box staple is all that is necessary to give egress;  if the door requires easing, it effectually prevents it being done--in  fact, it is a nuisance, and nothing but a nuisance. But our lockmakers  do not appear to give these things a thought; their doctrine seems to  be, \"As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be.\"    Again, notice that the edges of the iron which lie against the door  and the sham bushes are ground bright. Here is labor wasted, for as  soon as the lock is fixed these polished portions are hidden for  ever. Next, take the box staple. As is usual, it is fearfully and  wonderfully made up of sheet iron, square iron, and brass; the outcome  of which is that the showy brass striking piece comes unriveted, the  door comes unfastened, and the tenant's temper comes unhinged. Why, in  the name of common sense, could they not substitute a neat malleable  casting? In our own houses I have long since discarded the ordinary  box staple for draw-back locks, and find it cheaper to buy a cast iron  staple, and throw away the one supplied by the English lockmaker.    Bear in mind that I have shown neither of these locks as samples of  high-class goods, but as samples of the furniture fixed in the houses  of the working and middle classes of this country; and when I tell you  that the American lock, fitted with the mineral furniture, is at least  25 per cent cheaper than the English abortion I have shown to you, you  will begin to realize what our English markets have to fear from the  Americans.    Here is a common, cheap English mortise lock, and you will naturally  ask why the outside of this lock is ground bright, when it is buried  in the door and never seen except it has to be taken out for repairs.  I have asked the same question, and for 20 years have paused for a  reply. This lock is not reversible, the follower is not bushed, and  the inside is rough and cheap. Contrast it with this neat American  lock, and notice again the bosses to receive the wear; notice also  that the bolts are brass; the latch-bolt is, of course, reversible--I  never saw an American lock which was not. The body of the lock is cast  iron; and, seeing that there are no strains upon a mortise lock, it is  quite as good as if it was of wrought iron. There is no unnecessary  grinding, but the iron is japanned, and the japan is as much superior  to the English compound as is the lacquer ware of the Japanese to that  which is executed in Birmingham and palmed upon the ignorant buyer as  Japanese work. In fact, as you can see for yourselves, the English  japan looks almost like gas tar beside the American. This American  lock is a two-lever, and there is no sham about the key, which is made  of some kind of white metal and is small and neat. This lock is only  21/2 per cent higher in price than the English.    Before leaving these locks, let me say a word or two upon the  relative wear upon their different portions, and their relative  safety. The English maker appears to ignore the fact that  nineteen-twentieths of the wear of a lock is upon the latch, spindle,  and follower; the amount of actual wear upon the rest of the lock is  comparatively slight. Let any of you consider the number of times you  open and close a door, compared with the times you lock it. Our  drawbacks and large rim locks are used about once a day; the great  bulk of our mortise locks are not used, except as latches, once a  week. One argument used by our manufacturers against the American lock  is that, being made by machinery, there is necessarily a great  duplication of parts, and a consequent lowering of the standard of  security; while their own locks, being made by hand, are not alike,  and therefore cannot be so easily opened.    Let any of you put this argument to proof, by trying how many front  doors you can open with one key in a row"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18880"],[0,"The New York Times Current History: the European War, February, 1915 (#15)"],[1,"at a time when they were not the order of the day, and only very few  shared my sentiments. I pronounced this feeling long ago, but it had  slight effect in drawing the attention of the Poles to my writings about  them or in winning their thanks. The Poles did not discover my book  about them till ten years after it had appeared, and when it had been by  chance translated into German. To write in Danish is as a rule to write  in water.    It would be very ungrateful of me, on this occasion, when I am obliged  to use sharp words to the Poles, not to remember the indescribable  affection and kindness they have shown me in Russian Poland as well as  in Austrian Poland. Among them I have found quite incomparable friends.    For a long time I have therefore refused to say an unkind, not to  mention an offensive word. As far back as in 1898 I refused so  absolutely to make myself the advocate of the Ruthenians against them  that the Ruthenian leaders became my bitter enemies, who never tired of  attacking me, and I was mute as a fish when Bjoernstjerne Bjoernson, not  long before his death, upon application of the Ruthenians, attacked the  Poles, fortunately for them with such unreasonable exaggerations that  the attacks did no harm. (Bjoernson maintained that the Pole as such was  the devil himself as the Middle Ages had imagined him.) I knew better  than Bjoernson what might be said against electioneering and pressure on  electors in Galicia, but I remained silent because I considered it  unworthy to attack a people which was in such a difficult position and  which was able to defend many minor injustices committed by it as  self-defense. I considered it especially impossible for me to attack the  Poles to whom I was bound by honor and toward whom I bore the warmest,  most sincere sympathy.    It is therefore with no light heart that I write these lines.    Denial of the rights of man to Jewish subjects belongs to the nature of  Russia. Now and then Europe has been startled when an uncommon massacre  of innocent Jews has taken place, as in Kishineff, but all have known  and know that Russia stows her Jewish population together in the Polish  outskirts of the realm, stows them together so tightly that they can  neither live nor die, denies them the liberty of moving, the liberty of  studying, even the right of school--and university--education beyond a  certain (too small) percentage. Only such Jews who hold a university  degree are allowed to live in the capitals of the Empire. No young  Jewish woman is allowed to take up her abode near the universities in  Petrograd or Moscow, unless she has been enrolled as a prostitute, and  it has happened that the police have made their appearance and accused  her of forgery, complaining that she did not carry on her profession,  but was reading scientific books instead. If a man is, for instance, a  doctor of medicine, he may take up his abode in Moscow; in case he is  married his wife may live there with him. But if the couple has a  two-year-old child, the mother is not allowed to take it with her into  the railway carriage and let it live with her in the capital. For the  child has no right to live there. If this right is wanted a detailed  petition must be sent in to the Governor General, in whose power it is  to grant or refuse it.    In a few of the cases where plunder and murder of a Jewish population in  Russia have taken place, the outrages have partly been excused, or at  any rate explained, through the almost incomprehensible ignorance of the  peasants. Russia's most famous political economist, who at the same time  is a great estate owner, has told me himself that when the elections to  the First Duma took place he was informed that each of the peasants on  his estate had voted for himself. He asked them, surprised, what they  meant, and explained to them that in this way none of them could be  elected; but they answered with the question, \"Does not each Deputy get  so many rubles a day? Yes. And do you think that we should let so much  money go to another if we, perhaps, might get it ourselves?\"    The same prominent estate owner told me that one day he asked some of  his peasants if they really had partaken in a Pogrom which had taken  place in the neighboring parish--he could not believe it, as they looked  so good-natured. To his astonishment they answered yes, and when he  asked them about the reason they replied: \"You know it very well.\" They  then explained that they had killed these Jews because the Jews had  killed their Saviour. He: \"But that was so long ago and it was not they  who did it and it did not happen in this country.\" To which they, again  astonished, exclaimed: \"Was it long ago? We thought it was last week.\"  It appeared that they had understood from the priest's explanation that  the crucifixion had taken place then and there.    Under such conditions one is not surprised by any outrage. But to see  the hatred of the Jews spread in Russian Poland, where people understand  how to read and write, that must surely fill one with wonder. The great  number of Jews in the old Polish Kingdom originated in the days of  Casimir the Great (1309-1370), who out of love for his concubine,  Esther, opened his country to the Jews and made conditions favorable for  them. Since then the number has increased, as the Czars locked up all  their Jewish subjects there. So they have been living separated and with  a special dress like the Jews of Denmark at the time of Holberg. They  have, however, felt and suffered as Polish patriots. As early as 1794 a  regiment of Jewish volunteers fought under Kosciusko; their Colonel fell  in 1809. In 1830 the shallow Polish national Government refused the  Jews' petition to be allowed to enter the army. As they then ventured to  apply for admission to the Polish public schools Nicholas I. punished  them, allowing 36,000 families to be carried away to the steppes of  South Russia, where the regulation for the enlistment of children  overtook them. All their small boys from the age of 6 years were sent to  Archangel in Cossack custody to be trained as sailors. They died in  multitudes on the way.    The evils which befell all the inhabitants of Poland regardless of their  creed for some time suppressed the hatred of the Jews which is always  lurking in the masses. The great men of Poland checked its development.  Adam Mickiewicz, Poland's greatest author, went so far that in his chief  work, Poland's national epic, \"Pan Tadeusz\" (1834) he makes a Jewish  innkeeper one of the most sympathetic leading characters. He is  introduced in the fourth canto as a genius in music, the great master of  the national instrument, the cymbal; and Mickiewicz makes the  culmination of his poem the moment when Jankiel before Dombrowski  himself plays the Dombrowski marche, symbolical of the whole history of  Poland from 1791-1812, the year in which the poem takes place, the  Napoleon year.    In the year 1860 the equalization of the Jews with the Catholics was a  reality in Warsaw, and when, in February, 1861, at two large public  places in Warsaw, the Russians had shot on the kneeling masses singing  the national anthem, (\"Zdymem pozarow,\") the Jews felt impelled to show  their national feeling through an unmistakable manifestation.    In masses they accompanied their rabbis into the Catholic churches just  as the Christians in crowds entered the synagogues to sing the same  hymn.    This last feature, the processions of the two creeds into each other's  churches singing the same song, made such an impression on Henrik Ibsen,  the great Scandinavian poet, that again and again he returned in his  conversations to this as one of the greatest and most beautiful  experiences he had ever had.    And now under the whirlstorm of madness which nationalism has driven  across Europe, all this is lost; nay, from a religious reconciliation it  has been turned into flaming hatred between the races.      II.    In 1912 the election of a Deputy to the Duma was to take place in  Warsaw. The population of the town consists of between seven and eight  hundred thousand. As among them there are 300,000 Jews, the majority of  the electors, it was in the power of that majority to elect a Jewish  Deputy. Because of their Polish national feeling, however, they gave up  this right, as they wanted Warsaw, as the capital of the Kingdom of  Poland, to be represented by a man who not only in spirit, but also by  race, was a Pole. Of the Polish committee they only demanded that the  party concerned be no enemy to the Jews. It proved, however, that the  committee in its arrogance would not deal with them at all and proposed  Kucharschewski, a pronounced anti-Semitic candidate and a man who  publicly declared that he desired the election to the Duma only to work  for the extermination of the Jews of Poland. By the way, it is strange  to notice how the word \"exterminate,\" which thirty years ago in the days  of Bismarck and Eduard von Hartmann as _Ausrotten_ was subject to the  curse and condemnation of the Poles, has now come to honor, and how  easily it passes their lips.    As the Jews, of course, could not vote on such a man, they urgently  asked the committee to propose another candidate not inimical to them.  This reasonable request was refused with coarseness and Kucharschewski's  candidacy maintained. Because of that the Jews were obliged to look  about for another candidate of Polish family who was fit for the  position and was not hostile to them. In spite of numerous applications,  they did not succeed in finding such a man; at the last moment, when all  attempts had failed, Jagello, the Social Democrat, declared himself  willing to accept the candidacy of the Jews.    The only thing in his favor was the fact that he was of pure Polish  blood. As their leading men all belong to the higher middle class, they  did not share his views. But the state of"]]]
