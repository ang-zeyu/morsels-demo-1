Working as a now well-rehearsed team, the men set up a shelter of  saplings and brush, the back to the slit through which wind was still  able to tear a way. Walled in by stone and knowing that no Throg flyer  would attempt to fly in the face of the coming storm, they dared make a  fire. The warmth was a comfort to their bodies, just as the light of the  flames, men's age-old hearth companion, was a comfort to the fugitives'  spirits. Those dancing spears of red, for Shann at least, burned away  that veil of other-worldliness which had enwrapped the beach, providing  in the night an illusion of the home he had never really known.    But the wind and the weather did not keep truce very long. A wailing  blast around the upper peaks produced a caterwauling to equal the voices  of half a dozen Throg hounds. And in their poor shelter the Terrans not  only heard the thunderous boom of surf, but felt the vibration of that  beat pounding through the very ground on which they lay. The sea must  have long since covered the beach over which they had come and was now  trying its strength against the rock of the cliff barrier. They could  not talk to each other over that din, although shoulder touched  shoulder.    The last flush of amber vanished from the sky with the speed of a  dropped curtain. Tonight no period of twilight divided night from day,  but their portion of Warlock was plunged abruptly into darkness. The  wolverines crowded into their small haven, whining deep in their  throats. Shann ran his hands along their furred bodies, trying to give  them a reassurance he himself did not feel. Never before when on stable  land had he been so aware of the unleashed terrors nature could exert,  the forces against which all mankind's controls were as nothing.    Time could no longer be measured by any set of minutes or hours. There  was only darkness, the howling winds, and the salty rain which must be  in part the breath of the sea driven in upon them. The comforting fire  vanished, chill and dankness crept up to cramp their bodies, so that now  and again they were forced to their feet, to swing arms, stamp, drive  the blood into faster circulation.    Later came a time when the wind died, no longer driving the rain  bullet-hard against and through their flimsy shelter. Then they slept in  the thick unconsciousness of exhaustion.    A red-purple skull--and from its eye sockets the flying things--kept  coming ... going.... Shann trod on an unsteady foundation which dipped  under his weight as had the raft of the river voyage. He was drawing  nearer to that great head, could see now how waves curled about the  angle of the lower jaw, slapping inward between gaps of missing  teeth--which were really broken fangs of rock--as if the skull now and  then sucked reviving moisture from the water. The aperture marking the  nose was closer to a snout, and the hole was dark, dark as the empty eye  sockets. Yet that darkness was drawing him past any effort to escape he  could summon. And then that on which he rode so perilously was carried  forward by the waves, grated against the jawbone, while against his own  fighting will his hands arose above his head, reaching for a hold to  draw his shrinking body up the stark surface to that snout-passage.    \"Lantee!\" A hand jerked him back, broke that compulsion--and the dream.  Shann opened his eyes with difficulty, his lashes seemed glued to his  cheeks.    He might have been surveying a submerged world. Thin streamers of fog  twined up from the earth as if they grew from seeds planted by the  storm. But there was no wind, no sound from the peaks. Only under his  stiff body Shann could still feel that vibration which was the sea  battering against the cliff wall.    Thorvald was crouched beside him, his hand still urgent on the younger  man's shoulder. The officer's face was drawn so finely that his  features, sharp under the tanned skin, were akin to the skull Shann  still half saw among the ascending pillars of fog.    \"Storm's over.\"    Shann shivered as he sat up, hugging his arms to his chest, his tattered  uniform soggy under that pressure. He felt as if he would never be warm  again. When he moved sluggishly to the pit where they had kindled their  handful of fire the night before he realized that the wolverines were  missing.    \"Taggi----?\" His voice sounded rusty in his own ears, as if some of the  moisture thick in the air about them had affected his vocal cords.    \"Hunting.\" Thorvald's answer was clipped. He was gathering a handful of  sticks from the back of their lean-to, where the protection of their own  bodies had kept that kindling dry. Shann snapped a length between his  hands, dropped it into the pit.    When they did coax a blaze into being they stripped, wringing out their  clothing, propping it piece by steaming piece on sticks by the warmth of  the flames. The moist air bit at their bodies and they moved briskly,  striving to keep warm by exercise. Still the fog curled, undisturbed by  any shaft of sun.    \"Did you dream?\" Thorvald asked abruptly.    \"Yes.\" Shann did not elaborate. Disturbing as his dream had been, the  feeling that it was not to be shared was also strong, as strong as some  order.    \"And so did I,\" Thorvald said bleakly. \"You saw your skull-mountain?\"    \"I was climbing it when you awoke me,\" Shann returned unwillingly.    \"And I was going through my green veil when Taggi took off and wakened  me. You are sure your skull exists?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And so am I that the cavern of the veil is somewhere on this world. But  why?\" Thorvald stood up, the firelight marking plainly the lines between  his tanned arms, his brown face and throat, and the paleness of his lean  body. \"Why do we dream those particular dreams?\"    Shann tested the dryness of a shirt. He had no reason to try and explain  the wherefore of those dreams, only was he certain that he would  sometime, somewhere, find that skull, and that when he did he would  climb to the doorway of the snout, pass behind to depths where the  flying things might nest--not because he wanted to make such an  expedition, but because he must.    He drew his hands across his ribs, where pressure still brought an  aching reminder of the crushing force of the energy whip the Throgs had  wielded. There was no extra flesh on his body, yet muscles slid easily  under the skin, a darker skin than Thorvald's, deepening to a warm brown  where it had been weathered. His hair, unclipped now for a month, was  beginning to curl about his head in tight dark rings. Since he had  always been the youngest or the smallest or the weakest in the world of  the Dumps, of the Service, of the Team, Shann had very little personal  vanity. He did possess a different type of pride, born of his own  stubborn achievement in winning out over a long roster of  discouragements, failures, and adverse odds.    \"Why do we dream?\" he repeated Thorvald's question. \"No answer, sir.\" He  gave the traditional reply of the Service recruit. And a little to his  surprise Thorvald laughed with a tinge of real amusement.    \"Where do you come from, Lantee?\" He asked as if he were honestly  interested.    \"Tyr.\"    \"Caldon mines.\" The Survey officer automatically matched planet to  product. \"How did you come into Survey?\"    Shann drew on his shirt. \"Signed on as casual labor,\" he returned with a  spark of defiance. Thorvald had joined the Service the right way as a  cadet, then a Team man, finally an officer, climbing that nice even  ladder with every rung ready for him when he was prepared to mount it.  What did his kind know about the labor Barracks where the dull-minded,  the failures, the petty criminals on the run, lived hard under a secret  social system of their own? It had taken every bit of physical endurance  and energy, every fraction of stubborn will Shann could summon, for him  to survive his first three months in those barracks--unbroken and still  eager to be Survey. He could still wonder at the unbelievable chance  which had rescued him from that merely because Training Center had  needed another odd hand to clean cages and feed troughs for the  experimental animals.    And from the center he made a Team, because when working in a smaller  group his push and attention to duty had been noticed and had paid off.  Three years it had taken, but he _had_ made Team stature. Not that that  meant anything now. Shann pulled his boots on over the legs of rough  dried coveralls and glanced up, to find Thorvald watching him with a  new, questioning directness the younger man could not understand.    Shann sealed his blouse and stood up, knowing the bite of hunger, dull  but persistent. It was a feeling he had had so many times in the past  that now he hardly gave it a second thought.    \"Supplies?\" He brought the subject back to the present and the  practical. What did it matter why or how one Shann Lantee had come to  Warlock in the first place?    \"What we have left of the concentrates we had better keep for  emergencies.\" Thorvald made no move to open the very shrunken bag he had  brought from the scoutship.    He walked over to a rocky outcrop and tugged loose a yellowish tuft of  plant, neither moss nor fungi but sharing attributes of both. Shann  recognized it without enthusiasm as one of the varieties of native  produce which could be safely digested by Terran stomachs. The stuff was  almost tasteless and possessed a rather unpleasant odor. Consumed in  bulk it would satisfy hunger for a time. Shann hoped that with the  wolverines to aid they could go back to hunting soon.    However, Thorvald showed no desire to head inland where they might  expect to locate game. He disagreed with Shann's suggestion for tracking  Taggi and Togi when those two emerged from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20796"],[0,"The Colors of Space (#15)"],[1,"third day, the biologist reported air, water and  gravity well within tolerable limits, and Captain Vorongil issued  permission for anyone who liked, to go outside and have a look around.    Bart had a sort of ship-induced claustrophobia. It was good to feel  solid ground under his feet and the rays of a sun, even a green sun, on  his back. Even more, it was good to get away from the constant presence  of his shipmates. During this enforced idleness, their presence  oppressed him unendurably--so many tall forms, gray skins, feathery  crests. He was always alone; for a change, he felt that he'd like to be  alone without Lhari all around him.    But as he moved away from the ship, Ringg dropped out of the hatchway  and hailed him. \"Where are you going?\"    \"Just for a walk.\"    Ringg drew a deep breath of weariness. \"That sounds good. Mind if I come  along?\"    Bart did, but all he could say was, \"If you like.\"    \"How about let's get some food from the rations clerk, and do some  exploring?\"    The sun overhead was a clear greenish-gold, the sky strewn with soft  pale clouds that cast racing shadows on the soft grass underfoot,  fragrant pinkish-yellow stuff strewn with bright vermilion puff-balls.  Bart wished he were alone to enjoy it.    \"How are the repairs coming?\"    \"Pretty well. But Karol got his hand half scorched off, poor fellow.  Just luck the same thing didn't happen to me.\" Ringg added. \"You know  that Mentorian--the young one, the medic's assistant?\"    \"I've seen her. Her name's Meta, I think.\" Suddenly, Bart wished the  Mentorian girl were with him here. It would be nice to hear a human  voice.    \"Oh, is it a female? Mentorians all look alike to me,\" Ringg said, while  Bart controlled his face with an effort. \"Be that as it may, she saved  me from having the same thing happen. I was just going to lean against a  strip of sheet metal when she _screamed_ at me. Do you think they can  really _see_ heat vibrations? She called it _red_-hot.\"    They had reached a line of tall cliffs, where a steep rock-fall divided  off the plain from the edge of the mountains. A few slender, drooping,  gold-leaved trees bent graceful branches over a pool. Bart stood  fascinated by the play of green sunlight on the emerald ripples, but  Ringg flung himself down full length on the soft grass and sighed  comfortably. \"Feels good.\"    \"Too comfortable to eat?\"    They munched in companionable silence. \"Look,\" said Ringg at last,  pointing toward the cliffs, \"Holes in the rocks. Caves. I'd like to  explore them, wouldn't you?\"    \"They look pretty gloomy to me. Probably full of monsters.\"    Ringg patted the hilt of his energon-ray. \"This will handle anything  short of an armor-plated saurian.\"    Bart shuddered. As part of uniform, he, too, had been issued one of the  energon-rays; but he had never used it and didn't intend to. \"Just the  same, I'd rather stay out here in the sun.\"    \"It's better than vitamin lamps,\" Ringg admitted, \"even if it's not very  bright.\"    Bart wondered, suddenly and worriedly, about the effects of green  sunburn on his chemically altered skin tone.    \"Well, let's enjoy it while we can,\" Ringg said, \"because it seems to be  clouding over. I wouldn't be surprised if it rained.\" He yawned. \"I'm  getting bored with this voyage. And yet I don't want it to end, because  then I'll have to fight it out all over again with my family. My father  owns a hotel, and he wants me in the family business, not five hundred  light-years away. None of our family have ever been spacemen before,\" he  explained, \"and they don't understand that living on one planet would  drive me out of my mind.\" He sighed. \"How did you explain it to your  people--that you couldn't be happy in the mud? Or are you a career man?\"    \"I guess so. I never thought about doing anything else,\" Bart said  slowly, Ringg's story had touched him; he had never realized quite so  fully how much alike the two races were, how human the Lhari problems  and dreams could seem. _Why, of course, the Lhari aren't all spacemen.  They have hotel keepers and garbage men and dentists just as we do.  Funny, you never think of them except in space._    \"My mother died when I was very young,\" Bart said, choosing his words  very carefully. \"My father owned a fleet of interplanetary ships.\"    \"But you wanted the real thing, deep space, the stars,\" Ringg said. \"How  did he feel about that?\"    \"He would have understood,\" Bart said, unable to keep emotion out of his  voice, \"but he's dead now. He died, not long ago.\"    Ringg's eyes were bright with sympathy. \"While you were off on the  drift? Bad luck,\" he said gently. He was silent, and when he spoke again  it was in a very different tone.    \"But some of the older generation--I had a professor in training school,  funny old chap, bald as the hull of the _Swiftwing_. Taught us  cosmic-ray analysis, and what he didn't know about spiral nebulae could  be engraved on my fifth toe-claw, and he'd never been off the face of  the planet. Not even to one of the moons! He was the supervisor of my  student lodge, and oh, was he a--\" The phrase Ringg used meant,  literally, _a soft piece of cake_.    \"His feet may have been buried in mud, but his head was off in the Great  Nebula. We had some wild times,\" Ringg reminisced. \"We'd slip away to  the city--strictly against rules, it was an old-style school--and draw  lots for one of us to stay home and sign in for all twelve. You see,  he'd sit there reading, and when one of us came in, just shove the wax  at us, with his nose in a text on cosmic dust, never looking up. So the  one who stayed home would scrawl a name on it, walk out the back door,  come around and sign in again. When there were twelve signed in, of  course, the old chap would go up to bed, and late that night the one who  stayed in would sneak down and let us in.\"    Ringg sat up suddenly, touching his cheek. \"Was that a drop of rain? And  the sun's gone. I suppose we ought to start back, though I hate to leave  those caves unexplored.\"    Bart bent to gather up the debris of their meal. He flinched as  something hard struck his arm. \"Ouch! What was that?\"    Ringg cried out in pain. \"It's hail!\"    Sharp pieces of ice were suddenly pelting, raining down all around them,  splattering the ground with a harsh, bouncing clatter. Ringg yelled,  \"Come on--it's big enough to _flatten_ you!\"    It looked to Bart as if it were at least golf-ball size, and seemed to  be getting bigger by the moment. Lightning flashed around them in sudden  glare. They ducked their heads and ran.    \"Get in under the lee of the cliffs. We couldn't possibly make it back  to the _Swift_--\" Ringg's voice broke off in a cry of pain; he slumped  forward, pitched to his knees, then slid down and lay still.    \"What's the matter?\" Bart, arm curved to protect his skull, bent over  the fallen Lhari, but Ringg, his forehead bleeding, lay insensible. Bart  felt sharp pain in his arm, felt the hail hard as thrown stones raining  on his head. Ringg was out cold. _If they stayed in this_, Bart thought  despairingly, _they'd both be dead!_    Crouching, trying to duck his head between his shoulders, Bart got his  arms under Ringg's armpits and half-carried, half-dragged him under the  lee of the cliffs. He slipped and slid on the thickening layer of ice  underfoot, lost his footing, and came down, hard, one arm twisted  between himself and the cliff. He cried out in pain, uncontrollably, and  let Ringg slip from his grasp. The Lhari boy lay like the dead.    Bart bent over him, breathing hard, trying to get his breath back. The  hail was still pelting down, showing no signs of lessening. About five  feet away, one of the dark gaps in the cliff showed wide and menacing,  but at least, Bart thought, the hail couldn't come in there. He stooped  and got hold of Ringg again. A pain like fire went through the wrist he  had smashed against the rock. He set his teeth, wondering if it had  broken. The effort made him see stars, but he managed somehow to hoist  Ringg up again and haul him through the pelting hail toward the yawning  gap. It darkened around them, and, blessedly, the battering, bruising  hail could not reach them. Only an occasional light splinter of ice blew  with the bitter wind into the mouth of the cave.    Bart laid Ringg down on the floor, under the shelter of the rock  ceiling. He knelt beside him, and spoke his name, but Ringg just moaned.  His forehead was covered with blood.    Bart took one of the paper napkins from the lunch sack and carefully  wiped some of it away. His stomach turned at the deep, ugly cut, which  immediately started oozing fresh blood. He pressed the edges of the cut  together with the napkin, wondering helplessly how much blood Ringg  could lose without danger, and if he had concussion. If he tried to go  back to the ship and fetch the medic for Ringg, he'd be struck by hail  himself. From where he stood, it seemed that the hailstones were getting  bigger by the minute.    Ringg moaned, but when Bart knelt beside him again he did not answer.  Bart could hear only the rushing of wind, the noise of the splattering  hail and a sound of water somewhere--_or was that a rustle of scales, a  dragging of strange feet?_ He looked through the darkness into the  depths of the cave, his hand on his shock-beam. He was afraid to turn  his back on it.    _This is nonsense,_ he told himself firmly, _I'll just walk back there  and see what there is._    At his belt he had the small flashlamp, excessively bright, that was,  like the energon-beam shocker, a part of regulation equipment. He took  it out, shining it on the back wall of the cave; then drew a long breath  of startlement and for a moment forgot Ringg and his own pain.    For the back wall of the cave was an exquisite fall of crystal! Minerals  glowed there, giant crystals, like jewels, crusted with strange  lichen-like growths and colors. There were pale blues "]]]
