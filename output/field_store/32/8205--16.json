In the Homeric version, Dionysos, in the guise of a           fair youth with dark locks and purple mantle, appears by the           seashore, when he is espied by Tyrrhenian pirates, who seize           him and hale him on board their ship, hoping to obtain a rich           ransom. But when they proceed to bind him the fetters fall from           his limbs, whereupon the pilot, recognizing his divinity,           vainly endeavors to dissuade his comrades from their purpose.           Soon the ship flows with wine; then a vine with hanging           clusters stretches along the sail-top, and the mast is entwined           with ivy. Too late the marauders perceive their error and try           to head for the shore; but straightway the god assumes the form           of a lion and drives them, all save the pious pilot,           terror-stricken into the sea, where they become dolphins.             [Footnote 79: WACHSMUTH, _Die Stadt Athen_, I, p. 757.]             [Footnote 80: _Mitth. Athen._, I, p. 113.]             [Footnote 81: LABORDE, I, pp. 249 f.]             [Footnote 82: SPON, II, p. 175.]             [Footnote 83: I, p. 27.]             In the principal post-Homeric versions, the Tyrrhenians           endeavor to kidnap Dionysos under pretext of conveying him to           Naxos, the circumstances being variously related. Thus in the           [Greek: Naxiaca] of Aglaosthenes (_apud_ HYGIN. Poet. Astronom.           II. 17),           the child Dionysos and his companions are to be taken to the           nymphs, his nurses. According to Ovid,[84] the pirates find the           god on the shore of Chios, stupid with sleep and wine, and           bring him on board their vessel. On awaking he desires to be           conveyed to Naxos, but the pirates turn to the left, whereupon,           as they give no heed to his remonstrances, they are changed to           dolphins and leap into the sea. Similarly Servius, _Ad. Verg.           Aen._, I. 67. In the _Fabulæ_ of Hyginus (CXXXIV), and in           Pseudo-Apollodorus,[85] Dionysos engages passage with the           Tyrrhenians. Nonnus, however, returns to the Homeric story,           which he has modified, extended, and embellished in his own           peculiar way.[86] These versions, to which may be added that of           Seneca,[87] all agree in making the scene take place on           shipboard, and, if we except the \"comites\" of Aglaosthenes, in           none of them is the god accompanied by a retinue of satyrs. But           Philostratus[88] pretends to describe a painting, in which two  Page 46  ships are portrayed, the pirate-craft lying in ambush for the           other, which bears Dionysos and his rout.             [Footnote 84: _Met._, III. 605 ff.]             [Footnote 85: _Bibliotheca_, III. 5. 3.]             [Footnote 86: _Dionys._, XLV. 119 ff.]             [Footnote 87: _Oedipus_, VV. 455-473.]             [Footnote 88: _Imag._, I. 19.]             In our frieze, however, the myth is represented in an entirely           different manner. The scene is not laid on shipboard, but near           the shore of the sea, where, as the action shows, Dionysos and           his attendant satyrs are enjoying the contents of two large           craters, when they are attacked by pirates. The satyrs who are           characterized as such by their tails, and in most cases (9 +           2:7) by the panther-skin, forthwith take summary vengeance upon           their assailants, of whom some are bound, others beaten and           burned, while others take refuge in the sea, only to be changed           into dolphins by the invisible power of the god.             These modifications of the traditional form of the story have           usually[89] been accounted for by the necessities of plastic           art; and this view has in its favor that the representation in           sculpture of any of the other versions which are known to us,           would be attended by great difficulties of composition, and           would certainly be much less effective. Reisch, however, has           suggested[90] that this frieze illustrates the dithyrambus           which won the prize on this occasion, and that the variations           in the details of the story are due to this. There is no           evidence for this hypothesis, inasmuch as we have no basis upon           which to found an analogy, and know nothing whatever of the           nature of the piece in which the chorus had figured.             [Footnote 89: _E.g._ OVERBECK, _Plastik³_, II. p. 92;           Friedrichs-Wolters, _Bausteine_, p. 488.]             [Footnote 90: _Griech. Weihgeschenke_, p. 102.]             The general arrangement and technic of this relief, the skill           with which unity of design is preserved despite the circular           form, the energy of the action, and the variety of the           grouping, have often been pointed out. More particularly, the           harmony and symmetry, which the composition exhibits, have been           noticed by most of the later writers who have had occasion to           describe the frieze. It is here, however, that we find the           divergencies and inaccuracies which have been alluded to above,           and these are such as to merit a closer examination.             To begin with the central scene, which is characterized as such           by the symmetrical grouping of two pairs of satyrs about the  Page 47  god Dionysos and his panther and is externally defined by a           crater at either side, we observe that, while the two satyrs           immediately to the right (I¹) and left (I) of Dionysos (0),           correspond in youth and in their attitude toward him, the satyr           at the left (I) has a thyrsus and a mantle which the other does           not possess. These figures have unfortunately suffered much;           the central group is throughout badly damaged, the upper part           of the body and the head of Dionysos especially so. Of the tail           of the panther as drawn in Stuart's work, no trace exists. The           faces of the two satyrs and the head of the thyrsus are also           much mutilated. The other two satyrs (II: II¹), whose faces           are also mutilated, correspond very closely in youth, action,           and nudity. In these two pairs of figures it is also to be           noticed that the heads of I and II at the left face the central           group, while the heads of I¹ and II¹ at the right are           turned away from the centre, toward the right. By this device           the sculptor has obviated any awkwardness which might arise           from the necessity of placing Dionysos in profile.             Passing now to the scenes outside of the vases, we observe           that, of the first pair of satyrs, the bearded figure at the           left (III), leans upon a tree-stump, over which is thrown his           panther-skin, as he contemplates the contest between his           fellows and the pirates, while against his right side rests a           thyrsus. The corresponding satyr on the right (III¹), also           bearded, but with his head now nearly effaced, wears his mantle           slung over the left shoulder as he advances to the right,           offering with his right hand the freshly filled wine-cup to a           youthful companion (IV¹). The latter, with panther-skin over           left shoulder and arm, and club (partially effaced) in           outstretched right hand, is moving rapidly to the right, as if           to join in the battle; his face (also somewhat mutilated) is           partly turned to the left, and despite his attitude of refusal           he forms a sort of group with his neighbor on that side           (III¹), and has no connection, as has been wrongly           assumed,[91] with the following group to the right (V¹).           Corresponding with this youthful satyr, we have on the left           (IV) a nude bearded satyr (face somewhat damaged,) armed with a           torch instead of a club, moving swiftly to the left to take  Page 48  part in the contest. He has no group-relation with his neighbor           on the right (III), although he maybe supposed to have just           left him. The relation is not sufficiently marked in the case           of the corresponding figures on the other side (III¹,           IV¹) to injure the symmetry.             [Footnote 91: _British Museum Marbles,_ IX, p. 114.]             These two pairs of satyrs serve to express the transition from           the untroubled ease of Dionysos and his immediate attendants,           to the violence and confusion of the struggle. Thus the first           pair (III: III¹) seem to feel that their active participation           is unnecessary, and so belong rather to the central scene;           while the second pair (iv: iv¹), hurrying to the combat, are           to be reckoned rather with those who are actively engaged. This           is also emphasized by the symmetrical alternation of young and           old satyrs, _i.e._:              old   young   old   young   old   young "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2016"],[0,"The 1998 CIA World Factbook (#15)"],[1,"$820 million (of which $75 million to Russia) (1997  est.)

In addition, the reopening of the country's oil refinery in  1993, a major source of employment and foreign exchange earnings, has  further spurred growth.
