In the  other colonies where Andros had been operating, the old course of  affairs was resumed.    =The Indifference of the First Two Georges.=--On the death in 1714 of  Queen Anne, the successor of King William, the throne passed to a  Hanoverian prince who, though grateful for English honors and revenues,  was more interested in Hanover than in England. George I and George II,  whose combined reigns extended from 1714 to 1760, never even learned to  speak the English language, at least without an accent. The necessity of  taking thought about colonial affairs bored both of them so that the  stoutest defender of popular privileges in Boston or Charleston had no  ground to complain of the exercise of personal prerogatives by the king.  Moreover, during a large part of this period, the direction of affairs  was in the hands of an astute leader, Sir Robert Walpole, who betrayed  his somewhat cynical view of politics by adopting as his motto: \"Let  sleeping dogs lie.\" He revealed his appreciation of popular sentiment  by exclaiming: \"I will not be the minister to enforce taxes at the  expense of blood.\" Such kings and such ministers were not likely to  arouse the slumbering resistance of the thirteen colonies across the  sea.    =Control of the Crown over the Colonies.=--While no English ruler from  James II to George III ventured to interfere with colonial matters  personally, constant control over the colonies was exercised by royal  officers acting under the authority of the crown. Systematic supervision  began in 1660, when there was created by royal order a committee of the  king's council to meet on Mondays and Thursdays of each week to consider  petitions, memorials, and addresses respecting the plantations. In 1696  a regular board was established, known as the \"Lords of Trade and  Plantations,\" which continued, until the American Revolution, to  scrutinize closely colonial business. The chief duties of the board were  to examine acts of colonial legislatures, to recommend measures to those  assemblies for adoption, and to hear memorials and petitions from the  colonies relative to their affairs.    The methods employed by this board were varied. All laws passed by  American legislatures came before it for review as a matter of routine.  If it found an act unsatisfactory, it recommended to the king the  exercise of his veto power, known as the royal disallowance. Any person  who believed his personal or property rights injured by a colonial law  could be heard by the board in person or by attorney; in such cases it  was the practice to hear at the same time the agent of the colony so  involved. The royal veto power over colonial legislation was not,  therefore, a formal affair, but was constantly employed on the  suggestion of a highly efficient agency of the crown. All this was in  addition to the powers exercised by the governors in the royal  provinces.    =Judicial Control.=--Supplementing this administrative control over the  colonies was a constant supervision by the English courts of law. The  king, by virtue of his inherent authority, claimed and exercised high  appellate powers over all judicial tribunals in the empire. The right  of appeal from local courts, expressly set forth in some charters, was,  on the eve of the Revolution, maintained in every colony. Any subject in  England or America, who, in the regular legal course, was aggrieved by  any act of a colonial legislature or any decision of a colonial court,  had the right, subject to certain regulations, to carry his case to the  king in council, forcing his opponent to follow him across the sea. In  the exercise of appellate power, the king in council acting as a court  could, and frequently did, declare acts of colonial legislatures duly  enacted and approved, null and void, on the ground that they were  contrary to English law.    =Imperial Control in Operation.=--Day after day, week after week, year  after year, the machinery for political and judicial control over  colonial affairs was in operation. At one time the British governors in  the colonies were ordered not to approve any colonial law imposing a  duty on European goods imported in English vessels. Again, when North  Carolina laid a tax on peddlers, the council objected to it as  \"restrictive upon the trade and dispersion of English manufactures  throughout the continent.\" At other times, Indian trade was regulated in  the interests of the whole empire or grants of lands by a colonial  legislature were set aside. Virginia was forbidden to close her ports to  North Carolina lest there should be retaliation.    In short, foreign and intercolonial trade were subjected to a control  higher than that of the colony, foreshadowing a day when the  Constitution of the United States was to commit to Congress the power to  regulate interstate and foreign commerce and commerce with the Indians.  A superior judicial power, towering above that of the colonies, as the  Supreme Court at Washington now towers above the states, kept the  colonial legislatures within the metes and bounds of established law. In  the thousands of appeals, memorials, petitions, and complaints, and the  rulings and decisions upon them, were written the real history of  British imperial control over the American colonies.    So great was the business before the Lords of Trade that the colonies  had to keep skilled agents in London to protect their interests. As  common grievances against the operation of this machinery of control  arose, there appeared in each colony a considerable body of men, with  the merchants in the lead, who chafed at the restraints imposed on their  enterprise. Only a powerful blow was needed to weld these bodies into a  common mass nourishing the spirit of colonial nationalism. When to the  repeated minor irritations were added general and sweeping measures of  Parliament applying to every colony, the rebound came in the Revolution.    =Parliamentary Control over Colonial Affairs.=--As soon as Parliament  gained in power at the expense of the king, it reached out to bring the  American colonies under its sway as well. Between the execution of  Charles I and the accession of George III, there was enacted an immense  body of legislation regulating the shipping, trade, and manufactures of  America. All of it, based on the \"mercantile\" theory then prevalent in  all countries of Europe, was designed to control the overseas  plantations in such a way as to foster the commercial and business  interests of the mother country, where merchants and men of finance had  got the upper hand. According to this theory, the colonies of the  British empire should be confined to agriculture and the production of  raw materials, and forced to buy their manufactured goods of England.    _The Navigation Acts._--In the first rank among these measures of  British colonial policy must be placed the navigation laws framed for  the purpose of building up the British merchant marine and navy--arms so  essential in defending the colonies against the Spanish, Dutch, and  French. The beginning of this type of legislation was made in 1651 and  it was worked out into a system early in the reign of Charles II  (1660-85).    The Navigation Acts, in effect, gave a monopoly of colonial commerce to  British ships. No trade could be carried on between Great Britain and  her dominions save in vessels built and manned by British subjects. No  European goods could be brought to America save in the ships of the  country that produced them or in English ships. These laws, which were  almost fatal to Dutch shipping in America, fell with severity upon the  colonists, compelling them to pay higher freight rates. The adverse  effect, however, was short-lived, for the measures stimulated  shipbuilding in the colonies, where the abundance of raw materials gave  the master builders of America an advantage over those of the mother  country. Thus the colonists in the end profited from the restrictive  policy written into the Navigation Acts.    _The Acts against Manufactures._--The second group of laws was  deliberately aimed to prevent colonial industries from competing too  sharply with those of England. Among the earliest of these measures may  be counted the Woolen Act of 1699, forbidding the exportation of woolen  goods from the colonies and even the woolen trade between towns and  colonies. When Parliament learned, as the result of an inquiry, that New  England and New York were making thousands of hats a year and sending  large numbers annually to the Southern colonies and to Ireland, Spain,  and Portugal, it enacted in 1732 a law declaring that \"no hats or felts,  dyed or undyed, finished or unfinished\" should be \"put upon any vessel  or laden upon any horse or cart with intent to export to any place  whatever.\" The effect of this measure upon the hat industry was almost  ruinous. A few years later a similar blow was given to the iron  industry. By an act of 1750, pig and bar iron from the colonies were  given free entry to England to encourage the production of the raw  material; but at the same time the law provided that \"no mill or other  engine for slitting or rolling of iron, no plating forge to work with a  tilt hammer, and no furnace for making steel\" should be built in the  colonies. As for those already built, they were declared public  nuisances and ordered closed. Thus three important economic interests of  the colonists, the woolen, hat, and iron industries, were laid under the  ban.    _The Trade Laws._--The third group of restrictive measures passed by the  British Parliament related to the sale of colonial produce. An act of  1663 required the colonies to export certain articles to Great Britain  or to her dominions alone; while sugar, tobacco, and ginger consigned to  the continent of Europe had to pass through a British port paying custom  duties and through a British merchant's hands"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16965"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#15)"],[1," position at the time when the young  Queen came to the throne was a unique one. Victoria was just eighteen  years of age--that is to say, if she had been a little younger it  would have been necessary to appoint a Regent until such time as she  came of age. For many years it had not been a matter of certainty  that she would succeed to the throne, and the late King's unreliable  temper had been the means of preventing the matter from being  properly arranged as regards certain advantages which might have  been given to the Princess during his life-time. In many ways,  however, it was fortunate that the Queen came to the throne at such  an early age: if her knowledge of State politics was small, she  possessed, at any rate, a well-trained mind, a sense of duty, and  a clear idea as to the responsibilities of her position as ruler of  a great nation.    There had been four reigning queens in this country before Victoria,  but all of them had had some previous training for their duties. The  two Tudor queens came of a ruling stock, and were older in years and  experience. The times, too, were very different. Queen Elizabeth,  for example, before coming to the throne possessed an intimate  knowledge of political affairs, and experience--she had been  confined in the Tower of London and narrowly escaped losing her  head--had endowed her with the wisdom of the serpent. The two Stuart  queens were no longer young, and both were married.    The circumstances in the case of the young Victoria were thus totally  different. She stood alone, and it was clear that some one must help  her to grapple with the thousand and one difficulties which  surrounded her. It was for some time uncertain who would undertake  the duty, until, almost before he had realized it himself, Lord  Melbourne found himself in the position of 'guide, philosopher, and  friend.'    How he devoted himself to this work can be judged from the fact that  no one--not even any of his opponents--regarded him with the  slightest mistrust or jealousy.    Melbourne was at this time fifty-eight years of age, an honourable,  honest-hearted Englishman. He was sympathetic by nature, fond of  female society, and, in addition, was devoted to the Queen. His  manner toward her was always charming, and he was in constant  attendance upon her.    Nor was the training which the Queen received from him limited to  politics, but matters of private interest were often discussed.  Every morning he brought dispatches with him to be read and answered;  after the midday meal he went out riding with her, and, whenever his  parliamentary duties allowed, he was to be found at her side at the  dinner-table. When he retired from office he was able to state with  pride that he had seen his Sovereign every day during the past four  years.    The news of her engagement to Prince Albert was received by him with  the keenest pleasure, and the Queen in writing to her uncle says:  \"Lord Melbourne, whom I of course have consulted about the whole  affair, quite approves my choice, and expresses great satisfaction  at the event, which he thinks in every way highly desirable. Lord  Melbourne has acted in this business, as he has always done toward  me, with the greatest kindness and affection.\"    It was a real wrench to the Queen when the time for parting came.  Melbourne, with his easy-going nature and somewhat free and easy  language, had schooled himself as well as his young pupil, and had  become a friend as well as an adviser. Some words of Greville's might  aptly serve for this great statesman's epitaph:    \"It has become his providence to educate, instruct, and form the most  interesting mind and character in the world. No occupation was ever  more engrossing or involved greater responsibility . . . it is  fortunate that she has fallen into his hands, and that he discharges  this great duty wisely, honourably, and conscientiously.\"    The Queen was equally fortunate in his successor, Sir Robert Peel,  a statesman for whom she had every confidence and respect, \"a man  who thinks but little of party and never of himself.\"    Peel was never afraid of making up his mind and then sticking to his  plan of action, although, as often happened, it brought him into  opposition with members of his own party. In his hands both the Queen  and her husband felt that the interests of the Crown were secure.    Peel naturally felt considerable embarrassment on first taking up  office, as he had given support in the previous year to a motion which  proposed cutting down the Prince's income. But the Prince felt no  resentment, and so frank and cordial was his manner that Peel,  following Lord Melbourne's lead, continued to keep him, from day to  day, thoroughly in touch with the course of public affairs.    The relations between the Queen and her Minister were cordial in the  extreme. Peel appreciated very fully her simple domestic tastes, and  he was able at a later date to bring before her notice Osborne, which  might serve as a \"loophole of retreat\" from the \"noise and strife  and questions wearisome.\"    The Queen was delighted with the estate. \"It is impossible to see  a prettier place, with woods and valleys and _points de vue_, which  would be beautiful anywhere; but when these are combined with the  sea (to which the woods grow down), and a beach which is quite private,  it is really everything one could wish.\"    In 1845 the Queen asked Lord Aberdeen if she could not show in some  way her appreciation of the courage with which Sir Robert Peel had  brought forward and supported two great measures, in the face of  tremendous opposition. She suggested that he should be offered the  Order of the Garter, the highest distinction possible.    Sir Robert Peel's reply was that he would much prefer not to accept  any reward at all; he sprang, he said, from the people, and such a  great honour in his case was out of the question. The only reward  he asked for was Her Majesty's confidence, and so long as he possessed  that he was content.    When his ministry came to an end the Prince wrote to him, begging  that their relations should not on that account cease. Sir Robert  replied, thanking him for \"the considerate kindness and indulgence\"  he had received at their hands, and regretting that he should no  longer be able to correspond so frequently as before. The Prince and  he were in the fullest sympathy in matters of politics, art, and  literature, and Peel had supported the Prince loyally through all  the anxieties connected with the arrangements for the Great  Exhibition.    His death in 1850 was a calamity. Prince Albert, in a letter, speaks  of Peel as \"the best of men, our truest friend, the strongest bulwark  of the throne, the greatest statesman of his time.\"    The Duke of Wellington said in the Upper House: \"In all the course  of my acquaintance with Sir Robert Peel I never knew a man in whose  truth and justice I had a more lively confidence, or in whom I saw  a more invariable desire to promote the public service. In the whole  course of my communications with him I never knew an instance in which  he did not show the strongest attachment to truth; and I never saw  in the whole course of my life the slightest reason for suspecting  that he stated anything which he did not believe to be the fact.\"  The Queen writing to her uncle said that \"Albert . . . felt and feels  Sir Robert's loss dreadfully. He feels he has lost a second father.\"    As a statesman it was said of him that \"for concocting, producing,  explaining and defending measures, he had no equal, or anything like  an equal.\"    By far the most interesting person who acted as both friend and  adviser to the Queen and her husband was the Baron Christian  Friedrich von Stockmar, who had been private physician to Prince  Leopold, and afterward private secretary and controller of his  household. He took an active part in the negotiations which led to  his master becoming King of the Belgians. Long residence in this  country had given him a thorough knowledge of England and the English,  and he claimed friendship with the leading diplomatists both at home  and on the European continent.    In 1834 he retired to Coburg, but later was chosen, as we have seen,  to lend his valuable advice toward bringing about a union between  Prince Albert and Queen Victoria, both of whom he knew and admired.    Immediately before Victoria's accession King Leopold had sent him  to England, where his counsel, judgment, and thorough knowledge of  the English Constitution were placed at the service of the young  Princess. He accompanied Prince Albert on a tour in Italy, and again  returned to England to make arrangements for the Prince's future  household.    All that he did during this period was done quietly and behind the  scenes, and though he was a foreigner by birth, he worked to bring  about the marriage for the sake of the country he loved so well. He  looked upon England as the home of political freedom. \"Out of its  bosom,\" he stated, \"singly and solely has sprung America's free  Constitution, in all its present power and importance, in its  incalculable influence upon the social condition of the whole human  race; and in my eyes the English Constitution is the foundation-,  corner-, and cope-stone of the entire political civilization of the  human race, present and to come.\"    He soon became the Prince's confidential adviser, and his unrivalled  knowledge and strict sense of truth and duty proved of the utmost  value.    He endeared himself to both the Queen and the Prince, and successive  statesmen trusted him absolutely for his freedom from prejudice and  for his sincerity.    In 1842 he drew up for the Queen some rules for the education of her  children. \"A man's education begins the first day of his life,\" was  one of his maxims. He insisted that \"the education of the royal  infants ought to be from its earliest beginning _a truly moral and  a"]]]
