[13] Juan de Cuellar was mentioned in the Letter of Instruction given  by Philip II to Gomez Perez Dasmarinas on August 9, 1589, as among  those \"who are men of worth and account\" in the Philippines and who  should be provided for and rewarded accordingly, B. & R., VII, p. 151,  translated from the original MS. in the A. of I. (105-2-11), Torres,  III, no. 3567, p. 17. Cuellar received a commission from Dasmarinas  and signed various documents during his administration as secretary  and notary. Antonio de Morga, _Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas_, Mexico,  1609, f. 13v, reports that Cuellar was one of two survivors of the ship  on which Dasmarinas sailed in October 1593 as part of an expedition  to conquer the fort of Terrenate in Maluco. On the second day out,  while the ship was weather-bound at Punta del Acufre, the Chinese  rowers mutinied, and only Cuellar, there described as the governor's  secretary, and the Franciscan father, Francisco de Montilla, survived  the ensuing massacre. They were set ashore on the coast of Ylocos, and  made their way back to Manila. A similar account appears in Chapter XVI  of Leonardo de Argensola's, _Conqvista delas Islas Malvcas_, Madrid,  1609. We have been able to find no subsequent record of Cuellar.    [14] Colin, I, pp. 501, 507-14, 561-6.    [15] Pedro Chirino, _Primera parte de la Historia de la provincia  de Philipinas de la Compania de Ihs_, unpublished MS. of 1610,  from which the present passage was quoted by Retana, col. 25. For an  account of the MS. see Santiago Vela, VI, p. 435n. Schilling, p. 214,  demonstrates that according to the original punctuation the meaning  is that the first printers were Villanueva and Blancas de San Jose,  but with the shifting of a semi-colon it could be read to mean that the  first printers were of the Order of St. Augustine. We can see no reason  to shift the semi-colon, and have retained it in its original place.    [16] Retana, col. 26, said that he was able to find no information  regarding Villanueva except for the listing of his name by Cano,  p. 43, as having arrived in the Philippines at an unknown date. The  destruction of the early records of the Augustinians when the English  sacked Manila in 1762 accounts for the paucity of information, but  there are a few references which throw some little light on the two  Villanuevas. San Agustin, p. 212, says that when Herrara sailed for  Mexico in 1569 he left in Cebu only \"P. Fr. Martin de Rada and two  virtuous clerics, the one named Juan de Vivero, and the other Juan  de Villanueva, who had come with Felipe de Salcedo.\" Salcedo had  come back to Cebu in 1566. Francisco Moreno, _Historia de la Santa  Iglesia Metropolitana de Filipinas hasta 1650_, Manila, 1877, p. 226,  states that Villanueva came in 1566, and died shortly after 1569. San  Antonio, I, p. 173, writes, \"Another cleric was the Licentiate Don  Juan de Villanueva, of whom the only thing known is that he was a  churchman and lived but a short time--and that after the erection of  the church.\" This refers to the foundation of the church in Manila in  1571. Of the other Villanueva our information comes from Perez, p. 63.    [17] Alonso Fernandez, _Historia Eclesiastica de Nvestros Tiempos_,  Toledo, 1611, pp. 303-4.

[26] A fairly complete biography is given by Vinaza, pp. 112-7,  where he points out that several of the major Jesuit biographers have  erroneously stated that Hervas went to America some time before 1767.

Although Schilling, p. 208,  says that Hervas had a copy of the 1593 Doctrina before him, which  \"had been lent or given\" by Bernardo de la Fuente, Hervas merely says  that he took his information \"from the best documents, which showed  the grammar; and the Tagalog and Visayan dictionary were given me by  Messrs. D. Antonio Tornos and D. Bernardo de la Fuente.\" There is no  doubt, however, but that Hervas had a copy of the Doctrina, or accurate  and extensive transcripts from a copy known to one of his friends.    [29] Franz Carl Alter, _Ueber die Tagalische Sprache_, Vienna,  1803, p. vii. Alter speaks of having had extensive correspondence  with Hervas.

I am referring here to the flight briefing documents of       First Officer Cassin.... (He) had left his briefing documents at       home. They were recovered from his home on the day after the       disaster by an employee of the airline. As I say, they have never       been seen since.\"    In the following paragraph 53 he observed--\"If the explanation of the  chief executive is to be accepted, then in the opinion of someone the  briefing documents of First Officer Cassin, the co-pilot, were thought  to be irrelevant to the disaster\"; and in paragraph 54--\"it follows that  this direction on the part of the chief executive for the destruction of  'irrelevant documents' was one of the most remarkable executive  decisions ever to have been made in the corporation affairs of a large  New Zealand company\".    Those remarks require some brief comment. It must be explained that the  \"employee of the airline\" mentioned at the end of paragraph 52 was  Captain Crosbie. It is true that he was \"an employee of the airline\" but  he did not go to the home of First Officer Cassin in that capacity. He  had been asked by the Airline Pilots Association, the group which  throughout the inquiry had very properly been concerned to protect the  interests of the two deceased pilots, to act on their behalf for the  purpose of bringing immediate aid and comfort to the two widows. His  evidence was to the effect that he had gone to each of the homes for  that purpose; that sometime later a member of Mrs Cassin's family had  invited him to take away a box containing such items as flight manuals;  and he said he had done no more than that. He flatly denied taking any  flight documents. But even if he had, the alleged conspiracy has always  been limited in the Royal Commission Report to the executive pilots and  other officers in the management area. It has never been suggested that  it had extended as well to the airline pilots. As may be expected,  throughout both investigations they have done their conscientious best  to protect the valued reputations of their deceased colleagues.    There was documentary evidence before the Inquiry to the effect that on  30th November 1979 an in-house committee of Air New Zealand met on the  instruction of Mr Davis for the purpose of deciding how to collect  together all available information relevant to the accident. It seems  that it began its practical work on Monday 3rd December. In that regard  and as an example of the way in which the applicants say the cover-up  allegation could have been answered by those affected they placed  material before this Court which would suggest that the formation of  such a committee is a conventional step taken by an airline when  confronted with any serious disaster, that it was required by this  company's Accident Investigation Procedures Manual, and that this  committee was appointed accordingly. If it had been before the Inquiry  it would have supported the view that Mr Davis had decided the chairman  should not be associated with the flight operations side of Air New  Zealand and for that reason he appointed Mr Watson who had charge of  certain related companies. There is also an affidavit sworn by Captain  Priest who was appointed by the Airline Pilots Association to sit as its  representative on the committee. Taken at its face value it is to the  effect that he took part in the committee's work from the meeting on 3rd  December. In the affidavit he has explained: \"My position on that  Committee was an ALPA watchdog--there were two other independent  members\"; that as the inquiry progressed \"it became apparent that the  committee was amassing a large amount of papers\"; and that Mr Watson  then announced that he had been directed by the chief executive to get  all the information onto one file and any surplus disposed of to avoid  information getting into the wrong hands. The affidavit indicates that  it was then agreed by the committee itself that this should be done on  the basis that the master file was to be available to the committee  members at any time and it appears that Captain Priest joined in that  decision. It is not for us to decide what would have been the effect or  significance of all this material if it had been placed before the Royal  Commission but since the conspiracy to deceive theory that is developed  in the Royal Commission Report apparently stems from the instruction  given by Mr Davis clearly the officers so gravely affected were entitled  to be warned in advance and so be given the opportunity to have such  information fairly and properly considered.      Search at Mt. Erebus    The issue of documentary evidence is given extended attention in a  section of the Report headed, \"Post-accident conduct of Air New Zealand\"  which is exclusively concerned with suggestions of possible items that  might have been withheld from the Inquiry. The discussion is introduced  at paragraph 342 by a statement that \"This instruction by the chief  executive for the collection of all Antarctica documents had some  unfortunate repercussions\". The observation is then developed by  reference in particular to the work of Captain Gemmell, the technical  flight manager for Air New Zealand, while assisting Mr Chippindale at  the crash site.    Captain Gemmell had received instructions in the early hours of the  morning of 29th November 1979 to travel to McMurdo in order to assist Mr  Chippindale's investigation into the cause of the accident at the scene.  However, by reason of weather conditions it was not possible for him to  be taken by helicopter to the ice slope until 3 p.m. on 2nd December.  Then, clad in protective clothing and roped to mountaineers, he assisted  in a search for the in-flight recording equipment (consisting of the  cockpit voice recorder and the \"black box\") and the recovery of any  other equipment or documents which might indicate how the accident had  happened.    Three days earlier, at about 8.30 a.m. on the very morning after the  accident, three mountaineer staff members at Scott Base had managed to  get there in order to search for survivors. And Mr Woodford, who was one  of them, has described the scene in a letter received by the Royal  Commissioner during the public hearings. The letter, which is amplified  in a affidavit put before this Court, is set out later in this judgment.  Mr Woodford explained that when he got to the scene he found a black  flight bag with Captain Collins' name printed on it. It was lying open  on the snow and it was empty. Already material in the form of books and  papers that had not been destroyed when the aircraft disintegrated on  impact had been blown by winds over the ice-slope or into crevasses or  covered by drifting snow. He pointed out that although the cockpit voice  recorder had been located quite quickly when he was back at the crash  site with the party from New Zealand on 2nd December the \"black box\"  could not be found until later that evening after it had been decided to  begin digging systematically for it. It was found buried under snow at a  depth, he said, of 20 to 30 cms.    But although the bag was empty it was suggested at the hearing that  while at McMurdo Captain Gemmell might have \"collected a quantity of  documents from the crash site and brought them back to Auckland\"; that  only three of the flight documents carried on the aircraft had been  produced to the Royal Commission; that it was \"curious\" to find that  each favoured the case \"which the airline was now attempting to  advance\"; and all this against counsel's theory that before Captain  Gemmell had left Auckland on 29th November he was aware of possible  problems associated with the amendment to the destination point  co-ordinates. Captain Gemmell flatly denied having that knowledge while  in the Antarctic; and he rejected totally any suggestion that he had  recovered anything from the site which had not been passed across in  terms of Mr Chippindale's instructions. In that regard he answered two  propositions put to him by the Commissioner (at page 1834) in the  following way:         \"Well the suggestion may be made to me in due course that because       of the discovery that Capt Collins did not know of the alteration       in the nav track consequently someone in the co. would have been       instructed to locate whatever documents there were on the crash       site and elsewhere that might throw light on that question. You say       that no such instruction was given to you.... Certainly not.         But it would have been a reasonable instruction would it not.... No       it would not have.\"      Intimidation of a Witness    At this point it is necessary to mention a different suggestion which  was also rejected by Captain Gemmell. It was put to him during  cross-examination that he had carried back from McMurdo a blue plastic  envelope containing personal property recovered from the accident site.  In evidence given later by First Officer Rhodes the envelope was  supposed to have been entrusted to Captain Gemmell by Mr Chippindale for  delivery in New Zealand since Captain Gemmell was about to depart from  the base several days before the others. First Officer Rhodes had  himself been in Antarctica as a member of Mr Chippindale's investigation  team, representing there the Airline Pilots Association. He appeared as  a witness before the Royal Commission on two occasions. During his first  appearance he was called by the Association. He did not refer then to a  blue envelope; but because it was thought that the material may have  been mentioned by him to the Association's counsel he was recalled to  give evidence, this time by counsel for the airline.
