[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17306"],[0,"The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 (#15)"],[1," who turns in thither gets  into a filth and disgusting grime, the equal of which is not to be  found--especially in the courts which lead down to the Irk, and which  contain unqualifiedly the most horrible dwellings which I have yet  beheld.  In one of these courts there stands directly at the entrance, at  the end of the covered passage, a privy without a door, so dirty that the  inhabitants can pass into and out of the court only by passing through  foul pools of stagnant urine and excrement.  This is the first court on  the Irk above Ducie Bridge--in case any one should care to look into it.  Below it on the river there are several tanneries which fill the whole  neighbourhood with the stench of animal putrefaction.  Below Ducie Bridge  the only entrance to most of the houses is by means of narrow, dirty  stairs and over heaps of refuse and filth.  The first court below Ducie  Bridge, known as Allen's Court, was in such a state at the time of the  cholera that the sanitary police ordered it evacuated, swept, and  disinfected with chloride of lime.  Dr. Kay gives a terrible description  of the state of this court at that time. {49}  Since then, it seems to  have been partially torn away and rebuilt; at least looking down from  Ducie Bridge, the passer-by sees several ruined walls and heaps of debris  with some newer houses.  The view from this bridge, mercifully concealed  from mortals of small stature by a parapet as high as a man, is  characteristic for the whole district.  At the bottom flows, or rather  stagnates, the Irk, a narrow, coal-black, foul-smelling stream, full of  debris and refuse, which it deposits on the shallower right bank.  In dry  weather, a long string of the most disgusting, blackish-green, slime  pools are left standing on this bank, from the depths of which bubbles of  miasmatic gas constantly arise and give forth a stench unendurable even  on the bridge forty or fifty feet above the surface of the stream.  But  besides this, the stream itself is checked every few paces by high weirs,  behind which slime and refuse accumulate and rot in thick masses.  Above  the bridge are tanneries, bonemills, and gasworks, from which all drains  and refuse find their way into the Irk, which receives further the  contents of all the neighbouring sewers and privies.  It may be easily  imagined, therefore, what sort of residue the stream deposits.  Below the  bridge you look upon the piles of debris, the refuse, filth, and offal  from the courts on the steep left bank; here each house is packed close  behind its neighbour and a piece of each is visible, all black, smoky,  crumbling, ancient, with broken panes and window frames.  The background  is furnished by old barrack-like factory buildings.  On the lower right  bank stands a long row of houses and mills; the second house being a ruin  without a roof, piled with debris; the third stands so low that the  lowest floor is uninhabitable, and therefore without windows or doors.  Here the background embraces the pauper burial-ground, the station of the  Liverpool and Leeds railway, and, in the rear of this, the Workhouse, the  \"Poor-Law Bastille\" of Manchester, which, like a citadel, looks  threateningly down from behind its high walls and parapets on the  hilltop, upon the working-people's quarter below.    Above Ducie Bridge, the left bank grows more flat and the right bank  steeper, but the condition of the dwellings on both banks grows worse  rather than better.  He who turns to the left here from the main street,  Long Millgate, is lost; he wanders from one court to another, turns  countless corners, passes nothing but narrow, filthy nooks and alleys,  until after a few minutes he has lost all clue, and knows not whither to  turn.  Everywhere half or wholly ruined buildings, some of them actually  uninhabited, which means a great deal here; rarely a wooden or stone  floor to be seen in the houses, almost uniformly broken, ill-fitting  windows and doors, and a state of filth!  Everywhere heaps of debris,  refuse, and offal; standing pools for gutters, and a stench which alone  would make it impossible for a human being in any degree civilised to  live in such a district.  The newly-built extension of the Leeds railway,  which crosses the Irk here, has swept away some of these courts and  lanes, laying others completely open to view.  Immediately under the  railway bridge there stands a court, the filth and horrors of which  surpass all the others by far, just because it was hitherto so shut off,  so secluded that the way to it could not be found without a good deal of  trouble.  I should never have discovered it myself, without the breaks  made by the railway, though I thought I knew this whole region  thoroughly.  Passing along a rough bank, among stakes and washing-lines,  one penetrates into this chaos of small one-storied, one-roomed huts, in  most of which there is no artificial floor; kitchen, living and sleeping-  room all in one.  In such a hole, scarcely five feet long by six broad, I  found two beds--and such bedsteads and beds!--which, with a staircase and  chimney-place, exactly filled the room.  In several others I found  absolutely nothing, while the door stood open, and the inhabitants leaned  against it.  Everywhere before the doors refuse and offal; that any sort  of pavement lay underneath could not be seen but only felt, here and  there, with the feet.  This whole collection of cattle-sheds for human  beings was surrounded on two sides by houses and a factory, and on the  third by the river, and besides the narrow stair up the bank, a narrow  doorway alone led out into another almost equally ill-built, ill-kept  labyrinth of dwellings.    Enough!  The whole side of the Irk is built in this way, a planless,  knotted chaos of houses, more or less on the verge of uninhabitableness,  whose unclean interiors fully correspond with their filthy external  surroundings.  And how could the people be clean with no proper  opportunity for satisfying the most natural and ordinary wants?  Privies  are so rare here that they are either filled up every day, or are too  remote for most of the inhabitants to use.  How can people wash when they  have only the dirty Irk water at hand, while pumps and water pipes can be  found in decent parts of the city alone?  In truth, it cannot be charged  to the account of these helots of modern society if their dwellings are  not more cleanly than the pig-sties which are here and there to be seen  among them.  The landlords are not ashamed to let dwellings like the six  or seven cellars on the quay directly below Scotland Bridge, the floors  of which stand at least two feet below the low-water level of the Irk  that flows not six feet away from them; or like the upper floor of the  corner-house on the opposite shore directly above the bridge, where the  ground floor, utterly uninhabitable, stands deprived of all fittings for  doors and windows, a case by no means rare in this region, when this open  ground floor is used as a privy by the whole neighbourhood for want of  other facilities!    If we leave the Irk and penetrate once more on the opposite side from  Long Millgate into the midst of the working-men's dwellings, we shall  come into a somewhat newer quarter, which stretches from St. Michael's  Church to Withy Grove and Shude Hill.  Here there is somewhat better  order.  In place of the chaos of buildings, we find at least long  straight lanes and alleys or courts, built according to a plan and  usually square.  But if, in the former case, every house was built  according to caprice, here each lane and court is so built, without  reference to the situation of the adjoining ones.  The lanes run now in  this direction, now in that, while every two minutes the wanderer gets  into a blind alley, or, on turning a corner, finds himself back where he  started from; certainly no one who has not lived a considerable time in  this labyrinth can find his way through it.    If I may use the word at all in speaking of this district, the  ventilation of these streets and courts is, in consequence of this  confusion, quite as imperfect as in the Irk region; and if this quarter  may, nevertheless, be said to have some advantage over that of the Irk,  the houses being newer and the streets occasionally having gutters,  nearly every house has, on the other hand, a cellar dwelling, which is  rarely found in the Irk district, by reason of the greater age and more  careless construction of the houses.  As for the rest, the filth, debris,  and offal heaps, and the pools in the streets are common to both  quarters, and in the district now under discussion, another feature most  injurious to the cleanliness of the inhabitants, is the multitude of pigs  walking about in all the alleys, rooting into the offal heaps, or kept  imprisoned in small pens.  Here, as in most of the working-men's quarters  of Manchester, the pork-raisers rent the courts and build pig-pens in  them.  In almost every court one or even several such pens may be found,  into which the inhabitants of the court throw all refuse and offal,  whence the swine grow fat; and the atmosphere, confined on all four  sides, is utterly corrupted by putrefying animal and vegetable  substances.  Through this quarter, a broad and measurably decent street  has been cut, Millers Street, and the background has been pretty  successfully concealed.  But if any one should be led by curiosity to  pass through one of the numerous passages which lead into the courts, he  will find this piggery repeated at every twenty paces.    Such is the Old Town of Manchester, and on re-reading my description, I  am forced to admit that instead of being exaggerated, it is far from  black enough to convey a true impression of the filth, ruin, and  uninhabitableness, the defiance of all considerations of cleanliness,  ventilation, and health which characterise the construction of this  single"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17309"],[0,"The Summons of the Lord of Hosts (#15)"],[1,"of self and  desire and turn unto the Kingdom of God, the Possessor of the Throne on  high and of earth below, that ye may behold that which ye were promised  aforetime by your Lord, the All-Knowing.    168 Think ye that the things ye possess shall profit you? Soon others will  possess them and ye will return unto the dust with none to help or succour  you. What advantage is there in a life that can be overtaken by death, or  in an existence that is doomed to extinction, or in a prosperity that is  subject to change? Cast away the things that ye possess and set your faces  toward the favours of God which have been sent down in this wondrous Name.    169 Thus doth the Pen of the Most High warble unto thee its melodies by  the leave of thy Lord, the All-Glorious. When thou hast heard and recited  them, say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all the worlds, inasmuch as  Thou hast made mention of me through the tongue of Him Who is the  Manifestation of Thy Self at a time when He was confined in the Most Great  Prison, that the whole world might attain unto true liberty.\"    170 Blessed be the king whose sovereignty hath withheld him not from his  Sovereign, and who hath turned unto God with his heart. He, verily, is  accounted of those that have attained unto that which God, the Mighty, the  All-Wise, hath willed. Erelong will such a one find himself numbered with  the monarchs of the realms of the Kingdom. Thy Lord is, in truth, potent  over all things. He giveth what He willeth to whomsoever He willeth, and  withholdeth what He pleaseth from whomsoever He willeth. He, verily, is  the All-Powerful, the Almighty.          Queen Victoria      171 O Queen in London! Incline thine ear unto the voice of thy Lord, the  Lord of all mankind, calling from the Divine Lote-Tree: Verily, no God is  there but Me, the Almighty, the All-Wise! Cast away all that is on earth,  and attire the head of thy kingdom with the crown of the remembrance of  thy Lord, the All-Glorious. He, in truth, hath come unto the world in His  most great glory, and all that hath been mentioned in the Gospel hath been  fulfilled. The land of Syria hath been honoured by the footsteps of its  Lord, the Lord of all men, and north and south are both inebriated with  the wine of His presence. Blessed is the man that hath inhaled the  fragrance of the Most Merciful, and turned unto the Dawning-Place of His  Beauty, in this resplendent Dawn. The Mosque of Aqsa vibrateth through the  breezes of its Lord, the All-Glorious, whilst Batha(21) trembleth at the  voice of God, the Exalted, the Most High. Whereupon every single stone of  them celebrateth the praise of the Lord, through this Great Name.    172 Lay aside thy desire, and set then thine heart towards thy Lord, the  Ancient of Days. We make mention of thee for the sake of God, and desire  that thy name may be exalted through thy remembrance of God, the Creator  of earth and heaven. He, verily, is witness unto that which I say. We have  been informed that thou hast forbidden the trading in slaves, both men and  women. This, verily, is what God hath enjoined in this wondrous  Revelation. God hath, truly, destined a reward for thee, because of this.  He, verily, will pay the doer of good his due recompense, wert thou to  follow what hath been sent unto thee by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the  All-Informed. As to him who turneth aside, and swelleth with pride, after  the clear tokens have come unto him from the Revealer of signs, his work  shall God bring to naught. He, in truth, hath power over all things. Man's  actions are acceptable after his having recognized (the Manifestation). He  that turneth aside from the True One is indeed the most veiled amongst His  creatures. Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the Almighty, the Most  Powerful.    173 We have also heard that thou hast entrusted the reins of counsel into  the hands of the representatives of the people. Thou, indeed, hast done  well, for thereby the foundations of the edifice of thine affairs will be  strengthened, and the hearts of all that are beneath thy shadow, whether  high or low, will be tranquillized. It behoveth them, however, to be  trustworthy among His servants, and to regard themselves as the  representatives of all that dwell on earth. This is what counselleth them,  in this Tablet, He Who is the Ruler, the All-Wise. And if any one of them  directeth himself towards the Assembly, let him turn his eyes unto the  Supreme Horizon, and say: \"O my God! I ask Thee, by Thy most glorious  Name, to aid me in that which will cause the affairs of Thy servants to  prosper, and Thy cities to flourish. Thou, indeed, hast power over all  things!\" Blessed is he that entereth the Assembly for the sake of God, and  judgeth between men with pure justice. He, indeed, is of the blissful.    174 O ye the elected representatives of the people in every land! Take ye  counsel together, and let your concern be only for that which profiteth  mankind and bettereth the condition thereof, if ye be of them that scan  heedfully. Regard the world as the human body which, though at its  creation whole and perfect, hath been afflicted, through various causes,  with grave disorders and maladies. Not for one day did it gain ease, nay  its sickness waxed more severe, as it fell under the treatment of ignorant  physicians, who gave full rein to their personal desires and have erred  grievously. And if, at one time, through the care of an able physician, a  member of that body was healed, the rest remained afflicted as before.  Thus informeth you the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.    175 We behold it, in this day, at the mercy of rulers so drunk with pride  that they cannot discern clearly their own best advantage, much less  recognize a Revelation so bewildering and challenging as this. And  whenever any one of them hath striven to improve its condition, his motive  hath been his own gain, whether confessedly so or not; and the  unworthiness of this motive hath limited his power to heal or cure.    176 That which the Lord hath ordained as the sovereign remedy and  mightiest instrument for the healing of all the world is the union of all  its peoples in one universal Cause, one common Faith. This can in no wise  be achieved except through the power of a skilled, an all-powerful and  inspired Physician. This, verily, is the truth, and all else naught but  error. Each time that Most Mighty Instrument hath come, and that Light  shone forth from the Ancient Dayspring, He was withheld by ignorant  physicians who, even as clouds, interposed themselves between Him and the  world. It failed, therefore, to recover, and its sickness hath persisted  until this day. They indeed were powerless to protect it, or to effect a  cure, whilst He Who hath been the Manifestation of Power amongst men was  withheld from achieving His purpose, by reason of what the hands of the  ignorant physicians have wrought.    177 Consider these days in which He Who is the Ancient Beauty hath come in  the Most Great Name, that He may quicken the world and unite its peoples.  They, however, rose up against Him with sharpened swords, and committed  that which caused the Faithful Spirit to lament, until in the end they  imprisoned Him in the most desolate of cities, and broke the grasp of the  faithful upon the hem of His robe. Were anyone to tell them: \"The World  Reformer is come\", they would answer and say: \"Indeed it is proven that He  is a fomenter of discord!\", and this notwithstanding that they have never  associated with Him, and have perceived that He did not seek, for one  moment, to protect Himself. At all times He was at the mercy of the wicked  doers. At one time they cast Him into prison, at another they banished  Him, and at yet another hurried Him from land to land. Thus have they  pronounced judgement against Us, and God, truly, is aware of what I say.  Such men are reckoned by God among the most ignorant of His creatures.  They cut off their own limbs and perceive it not; they deprive themselves  of that which is best for them, and know it not. They are even as a young  child who can distinguish neither the mischief-maker from the reformer nor  the wicked from the righteous. We behold them in this Day wrapt in a  palpable veil.    178 O ye rulers of the earth! Wherefore have ye clouded the radiance of  the Sun, and caused it to cease from shining? Hearken unto the counsel  given you by the Pen of the Most High, that haply both ye and the poor may  attain unto tranquillity and peace. We beseech God to assist the kings of  the earth to establish peace on earth. He, verily, doth what He willeth.    179 O kings of the earth! We see you increasing every year your  expenditures, and laying the burden thereof on your subjects. This,  verily, is wholly and grossly unjust. Fear the sighs and tears of this  Wronged One, and lay not excessive burdens on your peoples. Do not rob  them to rear palaces for yourselves; nay rather choose for them that which  ye choose for yourselves. Thus We unfold to your eyes that which profiteth  you, if ye but perceive. Your people are your treasures. Beware lest your  rule violate the commandments of God, and ye deliver your wards to the  hands of the robber. By them ye rule, by their means ye subsist, by their  aid ye conquer. Yet, how disdainfully ye look upon them! How strange, how  very strange!    180 Now that ye have refused the Most Great Peace, hold ye fast unto this,  the Lesser Peace, that haply ye may in some degree better your own  condition and that of your dependents.    181 O rulers of the earth! Be reconciled among yourselves, that ye may  need no more armaments save in a measure to safeguard your territories and  dominions. Beware lest ye disregard the counsel of the All-Knowing, the  Faithful.    182 Be united, O kings of the earth, for thereby will the tempest of  discord be stilled amongst you, and your peoples find rest, if ye be of  them that "]]]
