You must go away at once, and lie completely lost for a time until this  blows over. Indeed, until my uncle can bring influence to bear to obtain  your pardon, you must keep in hiding.\"    \"That will be a long time, then,\" said Andre-Louis. \"M. de Kercadiou has  never cultivated friends at court.\"    \"There is M. de La Tour d'Azyr,\" she reminded him, to his astonishment.    \"That man!\" he cried, and then he laughed. \"But it was chiefly against  him that I aroused the resentment of the people of Rennes. I should have  known that all my speech was not reported to you.\"    \"It was, and that part of it among the rest.\"    \"Ah! And yet you are concerned to save me, the man who seeks the life of  your future husband at the hands either of the law or of the people? Or  is it, perhaps, that since you have seen his true nature revealed in the  murder of poor Philippe, you have changed your views on the subject of  becoming Marquise de La Tour d'Azyr?\"    \"You often show yourself without any faculty of deductive reasoning.\"    \"Perhaps. But hardly to the extent of imagining that M. de La Tour  d'Azyr will ever lift a finger to do as you suggest.\"    \"In which, as usual, you are wrong. He will certainly do so if I ask  him.\"    \"If you ask him?\" Sheer horror rang in his voice.    \"Why, yes. You see, I have not yet said that I will be Marquise de  La Tour d'Azyr. I am still considering. It is a position that has  its advantages. One of them is that it ensures a suitor's complete  obedience.\"    \"So, so. I see the crooked logic of your mind. You might go so far as  to say to him: 'Refuse me this, and I shall refuse to be your marquise.'  You would go so far as that?\"    \"At need, I might.\"    \"And do you not see the converse implication? Do you not see that  your hands would then be tied, that you would be wanting in honour if  afterwards you refused him? And do you think that I would consent to  anything that could so tie your hands? Do you think I want to see you  damned, Aline?\"    Her hand fell away from his arm.    \"Oh, you are mad!\" she exclaimed, quite out of patience.    \"Possibly. But I like my madness. There is a thrill in it unknown to  such sanity as yours. By your leave, Aline, I think I will ride on to  Gavrillac.\"    \"Andre, you must not! It is death to you!\" In her alarm she backed her  horse, and pulled it across the road to bar his way.    It was almost completely night by now; but from behind the wrack of  clouds overhead a crescent moon sailed out to alleviate the darkness.    \"Come, now,\" she enjoined him. \"Be reasonable. Do as I bid you. See,  there is a carriage coming up behind you. Do not let us be found here  together thus.\"    He made up his mind quickly. He was not the man to be actuated by false  heroics about dying, and he had no fancy whatever for the gallows of M.  de Lesdiguieres' providing. The immediate task that he had set himself  might be accomplished. He had made heard--and ringingly--the voice that  M. de La Tour d'Azyr imagined he had silenced. But he was very far from  having done with life.    \"Aline, on one condition only.\"    \"And that?\"    \"That you swear to me you will never seek the aid of M. de La Tour  d'Azyr on my behalf.\"    \"Since you insist, and as time presses, I consent. And now ride on with  me as far as the lane. There is that carriage coming up.\"    The lane to which she referred was one that branched off the road some  three hundred yards nearer the village and led straight up the hill  to the chateau itself. In silence they rode together towards it, and  together they turned into that thickly hedged and narrow bypath. At a  depth of fifty yards she halted him.    \"Now!\" she bade him.    Obediently he swung down from his horse, and surrendered the reins to  her.    \"Aline,\" he said, \"I haven't words in which to thank you.\"    \"It isn't necessary,\" said she.    \"But I shall hope to repay you some day.\"    \"Nor is that necessary. Could I do less than I am doing? I do not want  to hear of you hanged, Andre; nor does my uncle, though he is very angry  with you.\"    \"I suppose he is.\"    \"And you can hardly be surprised. You were his delegate, his  representative. He depended upon you, and you have turned your coat. He  is rightly indignant, calls you a traitor, and swears that he will never  speak to you again. But he doesn't want you hanged, Andre.\"    \"Then we are agreed on that at least, for I don't want it myself.\"    \"I'll make your peace with him. And now--good-bye, Andre. Send me a word  when you are safe.\"    She held out a hand that looked ghostly in the faint light. He took it  and bore it to his lips.    \"God bless you, Aline.\"    She was gone, and he stood listening to the receding clopper-clop of  hooves until it grew faint in the distance. Then slowly, with shoulders  hunched and head sunk on his breast, he retraced his steps to the  main road, cogitating whither he should go. Quite suddenly he checked,  remembering with dismay that he was almost entirely without money. In  Brittany itself he knew of no dependable hiding-place, and as long as  he was in Brittany his peril must remain imminent. Yet to leave the  province, and to leave it as quickly as prudence dictated, horses would  be necessary. And how was he to procure horses, having no money beyond a  single louis d'or and a few pieces of silver?    There was also the fact that he was very weary. He had had little sleep  since Tuesday night, and not very much then; and much of the time had  been spent in the saddle, a wearing thing to one so little accustomed  to long rides. Worn as he was, it was unthinkable that he should go far  to-night. He might get as far as Chavagne, perhaps. But there he must  sup and sleep; and what, then, of to-morrow?    Had he but thought of it before, perhaps Aline might have been able to  assist him with the loan of a few louis. His first impulse now was to  follow her to the chateau. But prudence dismissed the notion. Before he  could reach her, he must be seen by servants, and word of his presence  would go forth.    There was no choice for him; he must tramp as far as Chavagne, find a  bed there, and leave to-morrow until it dawned. On the resolve he set  his face in the direction whence he had come. But again he paused.  Chavagne lay on the road to Rennes. To go that way was to plunge further  into danger. He would strike south again. At the foot of some meadows on  this side of the village there was a ferry that would put him across the  river. Thus he would avoid the village; and by placing the river between  himself and the immediate danger, he would obtain an added sense of  security.    A lane, turning out of the highroad, a quarter of a mile this side of  Gavrillac, led down to that ferry. By this lane some twenty minutes  later came Andre-Louis with dragging feet. He avoided the little cottage  of the ferryman, whose window was alight, and in the dark crept down to  the boat, intending if possible to put himself across. He felt for the  chain by which the boat was moored, and ran his fingers along this to  the point where it was fastened. Here to his dismay he found a padlock.    He stood up in the gloom and laughed silently. Of course he might have  known it. The ferry was the property of M. de La Tour d'Azyr, and not  likely to be left unfastened so that poor devils might cheat him of  seigneurial dues.    There being no possible alternative, he walked back to the cottage, and  rapped on the door. When it opened, he stood well back, and aside, out  of the shaft of light that issued thence.    \"Ferry!\" he rapped out, laconically.    The ferryman, a burly scoundrel well known to him, turned aside to pick  up a lantern, and came forth as he was bidden. As he stepped from the  little porch, he levelled the lantern so that its light fell on the face  of this traveller.    \"My God!\" he ejaculated.    \"You realize, I see, that I am pressed,\" said Andre-Louis, his eyes on  the fellow's startled countenance.    \"And well you may be with the gallows waiting for you at Rennes,\"  growled the ferryman. \"Since you've been so foolish as to come back to  Gavrillac, you had better go again as quickly as you can. I will say  nothing of having seen you.\"    \"I thank you, Fresnel. Your advice accords with my intention. That is  why I need the boat.\"    \"Ah, that, no,\" said Fresnel, with determination. \"I'll hold my peace,  but it's as much as my skin is worth to help you.    \"You need not have seen my face. Forget that you have seen it.\"    \"I'll do that, monsieur. But that is all I will do. I cannot put you  across the river.\"    \"Then give me the key of the boat, and I will put myself across.\"    \"That is the same thing. I cannot. I'll hold my tongue, but I will not--I  dare not--help you.\"    Andre-Louis looked a moment into that sullen, resolute face, and  understood. This man, living under the shadow of La Tour d'Azyr, dared  exercise no will that might be in conflict with the will of his dread  lord.    \"Fresnel,\" he said, quietly, \"if, as you say, the gallows claim me, the  thing that has brought me to this extremity arises out of the shooting  of Mabey. Had not Mabey been murdered there would have been no need  for me to have raised my voice as I have done. Mabey was your friend, I  think. Will you for his sake lend me the little help I need to save my  neck?\"    The man kept his glance averted, and the cloud of sullenness deepened on  his face.    \"I would if I dared, but I dare not.\" Then, quite suddenly he became  angry. It was as if in anger he sought support. \"Don't you understand  that I dare not? Would you have a poor man risk his life for you? What  have you or yours ever done for me that you should ask that? You do not  cross to-night in my ferry. Understand that, monsieur, and go at once--go  before I remember that it may be dangerous even to have talked to you  and not give"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19487"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Hereford (#15)"],[1,"cost of the Dean and Chapter, Oct.  1864. It is a fairly good specimen of fourteenth century work. For many  years it was hidden away in old boxes, and was formerly fixed in some of  the windows on the south side of the nave.    The figures represent--1. St. Katherine; 2. St. Michael; 3. St. Gregory; 4.  St. Thomas of Canterbury.    In the south-east transept, again, is a window of ancient glass, erected  under the same circumstances. The figures in this case represent--1. St.  Mary Magdalene; 2. St. Ethelbert; 3. St. Augustine; 4. St. George.    In the north aisle of the nave is a two-light window by Warrington. It was  erected in 1862 by Archdeacon Lane Freer to the memory of Canon and Mrs.  Clutton. The subjects are from the life of St. John the Baptist.    In the north transept is a very fine memorial window to Archdeacon Lane  Freer, erected at a cost of L1316. The window is one of the largest of the  Geometric period (_temp._ Edward I.) in England, the glass being 48 feet 6  inches in height by 21 feet 6 inches in breadth. About five or six shades  each of ruby and Canterbury blue are the dominating colours. Plain white  glass has also been wisely used in the upper part of the window. It was  designed and erected by Messrs. Hardman.    There is a small window by Clayton and Bell in the north aisle of the  choir to the memory of John Hunt, organist of the cathedral. The subjects,  in eight medallions, are:--1, 2. King David; 3, 4. Jubal; 5, 6. Zachariah  the Jewish Priest; 7. St. Cecilia; 8. Aldhelm. In Bishop Stanbury's Chapel  is a memorial window to Archdeacon Musgrave, of which the subjects are:--1.  St. Paul present at the Martyrdom of S. Stephen; 2. Conversion of St.  Paul; 3. The Apostle consecrating Presbyters; 4. Elymas smitten with  Blindness. In the lower part of the window, 5. Sacrifices to Paul and  Barnabas at Lystra; 6. St. Paul before the Elders at Jerusalem; 7. His  Trial before Agrippa; 8. His Martyrdom.                       [Illustration: MONUMENTAL CROCKET.]                               MONUMENTAL CROCKET.                   [Illustration: EARLY ENGLISH BASEMENT MOULDING.]                         EARLY ENGLISH BASEMENT MOULDING.      The five eastern windows in the Lady Chapel were designed by Mr.  Cottingham, junior, and executed by Gibbs, to the memory of Dean  Merewether.    A series of twenty-one subjects, in medallions, connected with the life of  our Lord. These windows were erected in 1852.    In the south-east transept is a memorial window to Bishop Huntingford,  1816 to 1832. It was designed and manufactured by Warrington at the sole  cost of Lord Saye and Sele.    The upper part of the tracery is filled with the arms of George III.,  those of the See of Gloucester, the See of Hereford, Winchester College,  and of the bishop's family.    The subjects, relating to St. Peter, are:--    1. His Call; 2. Walking on the Sea; 3. Receiving the Keys; 4. Denial of  our Lord; 5. S. Peter and S. John at the Gate of the Temple; 6. Baptism of  Cornelius; 7. Raising of Dorcas; 8. Deliverance from Prison by an Angel.    In the north and south side of the clerestory of the choir are simple  stained glass windows, consisting of various patterns. They were  manufactured by Messrs. Castell of Whitechapel.    The eastern central window of the choir was an anonymous gift in 1851,  executed by Hardman.    Its beauties are entirely lost at its present height from the ground. The  circular medallions are 3 feet in diameter, the subjects being:--    1. The Ascension; 2. The Resurrection; 3. The Crucifixion.    The upper semi-circles represent Christ healing lepers and demoniacs; the  lower, His being taken down from the Cross, and Mary with the box of  precious ointment.            CHAPTER IV. - HISTORY OF THE SEE.      The true origin of the See of Hereford is lost in remote antiquity.  However, it seems probable from the researches of many antiquarians that  when Putta came to preside here in the seventh century the see was  re-established.    The Rev. Francis Havergal writes on this matter in the beginning of his  _Fasti Herefordenses_.    \"The Welsh claim a high antiquity for Hereford as the recognised centre of  Christianity in this district. Archbishop Usher asserts that it was the  seat of an Episcopal See in the sixth century, when one of its bishops  attended a synod convened by the Archbishop of Caerleon (A.D. 544). In the  _Lives of the British Saints_ (Rev. W. J. Reeves, 1853), we learn that  Geraint ab Erbin, cousin of King Arthur, who died A.D. 542, is said to  have founded a church at Caerffawydd, the ancient British name for  Hereford. In Wilkin's _Concilia_, I. 24, it is recorded that beyond all  doubt a Bishop of Hereford was present at the conference with St.  Augustine, A.D. 601. Full particulars are given of the supposed time and  place of this conference. It is also stated--'_In secunda affuisse  perhibentur septem hi Britannici episcopi Herefordensis, Tavensis alias  Llantavensis, Paternensis, Banchoriensis, Chirensis alias Elinensis,  Uniacensis alias Wiccensis, Morganensis._' It is styled '_Synodus  Wigornensis_,' or according to Spelman, '_Pambritannicam_.' Nothing  whatever is known of the names or of the number of British bishops who  presided over the earliest church at Hereford.\"    The boundaries of this diocese in the tenth century are defined in  Anglo-Saxon in an ancient volume known as the _Mundy Gospels_, now in the  library of Pembroke College, Cambridge.    \"The condition of the Church of Hereford (_circa_ 1290 A.D.) gave clear  testimony to the liberal piety of its founders by the extensiveness of its  lands. The diocese itself was richly endowed by nature, and enviably  situated. Those of St. Asaph, Lichfield, Worcester, Llandaff, and St.  David's, were its neighbours. On the north it stretched from where the  Severn enters Shropshire to where that river is joined on the south by the  influx of the Wye. From the west to the east perhaps its greatest width  might have been found from a point where the latter river, near Hay,  leaves the counties of Radnor and Brecon, by a line drawn to the bridge at  Gloucester. It embraced portions of the counties of Radnor, Montgomery,  Salop, Worcester, and Gloucester, and touched upon that of Brecon. It  included the town of Monmouth, with four parishes, in its neighbourhood.  The Severn environed its upper part. Almost midway it was traversed by the  Teme, and the Wye pursued its endless windings through the lower  district,--a region altogether remarkable for its variety, fertility, and  beauty, abounding in woods and streams, rich pastures, extensive forests,  and noble mountains. In several of the finest parts of it Episcopal manors  had been allotted, furnishing abundant supplies to the occupiers of the  see.\"(8)    In the early history of British dioceses, territorial boundaries were so  vague as to be scarcely definable, but one of the earliest of the bishops  holding office prior to the landing of Augustine was one Dubric, son of  Brychan, who established a sort of college at Hentland, near Ross, and  later on removed to another spot on the Wye, near Madley, his birthplace,  being guided thither by the discovery of a white sow and litter of  piglings in a meadow; a sign similar to the one by which the site of Alba  Longa was pointed out to the pious son of Anchises.    Dubric probably became a bishop about 470, resigned his see in 512, and  died in Bardsey Island, A.D. 522.    It was this Dubric who is said to have crowned Arthur at Cirencester, A.D.  506. When he became bishop he moved to Caerleon, and was succeeded there  by Dewi, or David, who removed the see to Menevia (St. David's).    The Saxons were driving the British inhabitants more and more to the west,  and before the close of the sixth century they had founded the Mercian  kingdom, reaching beyond the Severn, and in some places beyond the Wye.    The See of Hereford properly owes its origin to that of Lichfield, as  Sexwulf, Bishop of that diocese, placed at Hereford Putta, Bishop of  Rochester, when his cathedral was destroyed by the Mercian King Ethelred.    From Bede we learn that in 668 A.D. Putta died, and that one Tyrhtel  succeeded him, and was followed by Torhtere.    Wahlstod, A.D. 731, the next Bishop, is referred to by both Florence of  Worcester and William of Malmsbury, as well as Bede. We also hear of him  in the writings of Cuthbert, who followed him in 736. Cuthbert relates in  some verses that Wahlstod began the building of a great and magnificent  cross, which he, Cuthbert, completed.    Cuthbert died, A.D. 758, and was followed by Podda, A.D. 746. The names of  these early Bishops cannot all be regarded as certain, and their dates  are, in many cases, only approximate. Some of them may have been merely  assistants or suffragans to other Bishops of Hereford.    The remaining Bishops of Hereford, prior to the Conquest, we give in the  same order as the Rev. H. W. Phillott in his valuable little _Diocesan  History_.    A.D. 758, Hecca.  777, Aldberht.  781, Esne.  793, Cedmand (doubtful).  796, Edulf.  798, Uttel.  803, Wulfheard.  824, Beonna.  825, Eadulf (doubtful).  833, Cedda.  836, Eadulf.  838, Cuthwulf.  866, Deorlaf.  868, Ethelbert.  888, Cynemund.  895, Athelstane I.  901, Edgar.  930, Tidhelm.  935, Wulfhelm.  941, Elfric.  966, Ethelwolf.  1016, Athelstane II.: he rebuilt the cathedral \"from the foundations\";(9)  but also saw it destroyed in a raid of the Welsh and Irish under Elfgar.  1056, Leofgar, slain in a fight with the Welsh.    *Walter of Lorraine*, A.D. 1061-1079. The diocese had been administered  for the last four years by the Bishop of Worcester, when Queen Edith's  chaplain, a foreigner by birth, Walter of Lorraine, was appointed. Beyond  a probably satirical reference by William of Malmsbury, all that is known  of Walter is an account of a discreditable death.    *Robert de Losinga*, A.D. 1079-1095. A man"]]]
