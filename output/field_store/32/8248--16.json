It was thy barbarous hand that brought the object of my fondness  into this lamentable condition; and thou hast the cruelty to come and  insult me.' 'Yes,' said I, in a rage, 'it was I who chastised that  monster, according to his desert; I ought to have treated thee in the  same manner; I now repent that I did not; thou hast too long abused my  goodness.' As I spoke these words, I drew out my cimeter, and lifted up  my hand to punish her; but regarding me steadfastly, she said with a  jeering smile, 'Moderate thine anger.' At the same time she pronounced  words I did not understand; and afterward added, 'By virtue of my  enchantments, I command thee to become half marble and half man.'  Immediately, my lord, I became what you see, a dead man among the  living, and a living man among the dead. After this cruel sorceress,  unworthy of the name of queen, had metamorphosed me thus, and brought me  into this hall, by another enchantment she destroyed my capital, which  was very flourishing and populous; she annihilated the houses, the  public places and markets, and reduced the site of the whole to the lake  and desert plain you have seen; the fishes of four colours in the waters  are the four kinds of inhabitants, of different religions, which the  city contained. The white are the Mussulmans; the red, the Persians, who  worship fire; the blue, the Christians; and the yellow, the Jews. The  four little hills were the four islands that gave name to this kingdom.  I learned all this from the enchantress, who, to add to my affliction,  related to me these effects of her rage. But this is not all; her  revenge not being satisfied with the destruction of my dominions, and  the metamorphosis of my person, she comes every day, and gives me over  my naked shoulders a hundred lashes with a whip until I am covered with  blood. When she has finished this part of my punishment, she throws over  me a coarse stuff of goat's hair, and over that this robe of brocade,  not to honour, but to mock me.\"    When he came to this part of his narrative, the young king could not  restrain his tears; and the sultan was himself so affected by the  relation, that he could not find utterance for any words of consolation.  Shortly after, the young king, lifting up his eyes to heaven, exclaimed,  \"Mighty creator of all things, I submit myself to Thy judgments, and to  the decrees of Thy providence: I endure my calamities with patience,  since it is Thy will that things should be as they are; but I hope that  Thy infinite goodness will ultimately reward me.\"    The sultan, greatly moved by the recital of this affecting story, and  anxious to avenge the sufferings of the unfortunate prince, said to him:  \"Inform me whither this perfidious sorceress retires, and where may be  found the vile wretch, who is entombed before his death.\" \"My lord,\"  replied the prince, \"the Indian, as I have already told you, is lodged  in the Palace of Tears, in a superb tomb constructed in the form of a  dome: this palace joins the castle on the side in which the gate is  placed. As to the queen, I cannot tell you precisely whither she  retires, but every day at sunrise she goes to visit her charge, after  having executed her bloody vengeance upon me; and you see I am not in a  condition to defend myself. She carries to him the potion with which she  has hitherto prevented his dying, and always complains of his never  having spoken to her since he was wounded.\"    \"Prince,\" said the sultan, \"your condition can never be sufficiently  deplored: no one can be more sensibly affected by your misfortune than I  am. Never did anything so extraordinary befall any man! One thing only  is wanting; the revenge to which you are entitled, and I will omit  nothing in my power to effect it.\"    In his subsequent conversation with the young prince the sultan told him  who he was, and for what purpose he had entered the castle; and  afterward informed him of a mode of revenge which he had devised. They  agreed upon the measures they were to take for accomplishing their  design, but deferred the execution of it till the following day. In the  meantime, the night being far spent, the sultan took some rest; but the  young prince passed the night as usual, without sleep, never having  slept since he was enchanted.    [Illustration]    _When he came to this part of his narrative the young king could not  restrain his tears._    Next morning the sultan arose with the dawn, and prepared to execute his  design, by proceeding to the Palace of Tears. He found it lighted up  with an infinite number of flambeaux of white wax, and perfumed by a  delicious scent issuing from several censers of fine gold of admirable  workmanship. As soon as he perceived the bed where the Indian lay, he  drew his cimeter and deprived him of his wretched life, dragged his  corpse into the court of the castle, and threw it into a well. After  this he went and lay down in the black's bed, placed his cimeter under  the covering, and waited to complete his design.    The queen arrived shortly after. She first went into the chamber of her  husband, the king of the Black Islands, stripped him, and with  unexampled barbarity gave him a hundred stripes. The unfortunate prince  filled the palace with his lamentations, and conjured her in the most  affecting tone to take pity on him; but the cruel wretch ceased not till  she had given the usual number of blows. \"You had no compassion,\" said  she, \"and you are to expect none from me.\"    After the enchantress had given her husband a hundred blows with the  whip, she put on again his covering of goat's hair, and his brocade gown  over all; she went afterward to the Palace of Tears, and as she entered  renewed her tears and lamentations; then approaching the bed, where she  thought the Indian lay: \"Alas!\" said she, addressing herself to the  sultan, conceiving him to be the black, \"My sun, my life, will you  always be silent? Are you resolved to let me die without affording me  the comfort of hearing your voice?\"    The sultan, as if he had awaked out of a deep sleep, and counterfeiting  the pronunciation of the blacks, answered the queen with a grave tone:  \"There is no strength or power but in God alone, who is almighty.\" At  these words the enchantress, who did not expect them, uttered a loud  exclamation of joy. \"My dear lord,\" cried she, \"do I not deceive myself;  is it certain that I hear you, and that you speak to me?\" \"Unhappy  woman,\" said the sultan, \"art thou worthy that I should answer thee?\"  \"Alas!\" replied the queen, \"why do you reproach me thus?\" \"The cries,\"  returned the sultan, \"the groans and tears of thy husband, whom thou  treatest every day with so much indignity and barbarity, prevent my  sleeping night or day. Hadst thou disenchanted him, I should long since  have been cured, and have recovered the use of my speech. This is the  cause of my silence, of which you complain.\" \"Well,\" said the  enchantress, \"to pacify you, I am ready to execute your commands; would  you have me restore him?\" \"Yes,\" replied the sultan; \"make haste to set  him at liberty, that I be no longer disturbed by his lamentations.\" The  enchantress went immediately out of the Palace of Tears; she took a cup  of water, and pronounced some words over it, which caused it to boil, as  if it had been on the fire. She afterward proceeded to the young king,  and threw the water upon him, saying: \"If the Creator of all things did  form thee as thou art at present, or if He be angry with thee, do not  change; but if thou art in that condition merely by virtue of my  enchantments, resume thy natural shape, and become what thou wast  before.\" She had scarcely spoken these words when the prince, finding  himself restored to his former condition, rose up and returned thanks to  God. The enchantress then said to him, \"Get thee from this castle, and  never return on pain of death.\" The young king, yielding to necessity,  went away without replying a word, and retired to a remote place, where  he patiently awaited the event of the design which the sultan had so  happily begun. Meanwhile the enchantress returned to the Palace of  Tears, and supposing that she still spoke to the black, said, \"Dear  love, I have done what you required; nothing now prevents your rising  and giving me the satisfaction of which I have so long been deprived.\"    The sultan, still counterfeiting the pronunciation of the black, said:  \"What you have now done is by no means sufficient for my cure; you have  only removed a part of the evil; you must cut it up by the root.\" \"My  lovely black,\" resumed the queen, \"what do you mean by the root?\"  \"Wretched woman,\" replied the sultan, \"understand you not that I allude  to the town and its inhabitants, and the four islands, destroyed by thy  enchantments? The fish every night at midnight raise their heads out of  the lake, and cry for vengeance against thee and me. This is the true  cause of the delay of my cure. Go speedily, restore things to their  former state, and at thy return I will give thee my hand, and thou shalt  help me to arise.\"    The enchantress, inspired with hope from these words, cried out in a  transport of joy, \"My heart, my soul, you shall soon be restored to your  health, for I will immediately do as you command me.\" Accordingly she  went that instant, and when she came to the brink of the lake she took a  little water in her hand, and sprinkling it, she pronounced some words  over the fish and the lake, and the city was immediately restored. The  fish became men, women, and children; Mohammedans, Christians, Persians,  or Jews; freemen or slaves, as they were before: every one having  recovered his natural form. The houses and shops were immediately filled  with their inhabitants, who found all things as they were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20924"],[0,"Ely Cathedral (#15)"],[1,"E.

The fronts of the stalls are generally of open work, shewing the  hinged seats, or misereres as they are usually called, behind; in both  series of stalls these are curiously and grotesquely carved beneath.

An elegant brass lectern the gift of the late Canon Sparke, has been  placed in the Choir, as a memorial of H.S. le Strange, Esq., who  painted the ceiling of the Tower and the western portion of the Nave  ceiling.    The organ is placed in a position differing from that of most others  in England, although not unusual in Continental Cathedrals. The pedal  and swell organs have been placed in the triforium on the north side,  and the great organ, with the choir organ beneath it, project in front  of the third bay, resting upon an over-hanging chamber behind the  stalls. The organ was reconstructed, with great additions, by Messrs.  Hill and Son, of London, when the removal took place in 1851, and  several important additions were made in 1867, by the same firm.[39]  The magnificent organ-case, with its sculptures, was executed by Mr.  Rattee; the pipes in front have been gilded and ornamented by Mr.  Castell, of London, and much of the woodwork having been left in its  natural colour forms an agreeable contrast, and the effect produced,  from almost every point of view, is rich and beautiful; while from its  unusual position it loses little of its power or sweetness of tone,  but sends forth its pealing sounds reverberating through the lofty  arches with fine effect. We know nothing more sublime than the voices  of a congregation, guided and supported by such an instrument,  praising and adoring the great Creator and Father of all, and are led  to exclaim with the poet Milton--         \"There let the pealing organ blow,       To the full voiced choir below,       In service high and anthems clear,       As may with sweetness through mine ear,       Dissolve me into ecstacies,       And bring all heaven before mine eyes.\"    [Footnote 39: See Appendix I.]    The division between the Early English work of Bishop Northwold and  that part generally spoken of as Hotham's work is marked by two steps  in the floor, and by two strong piers rising from the floor to the  vault, which were in fact the original Norman shafts near the  commencement of the apse or east end taken down by Hugh de Northwold,  eighth bishop, who added the six beautiful eastern bays at his own  expense; these form a pure and good example of Early English work, and  were completed A.D. 1252, and dedicated in the same year, in the  presence of King Henry III., and many nobles and prelates. This was  called the \"Presbytery,\" or \"Sanctuary,\" a common name at that time  for the east end of a church.    \"The character of the three western bays is singularly yet beautifully  arranged to harmonize, in point of elevation of its parts, with the  six eastern arches; this and the very great excellence of the details,  render this part of the edifice a most valuable study.\"[40] The  absolute contact here of the two styles, Early English and Decorated,  affords the spectator an opportunity of contrasting them, and of  judging of the comparative merits of each. By many, the eastern bays  are preferred for their chaste and elegant appearance, not being so  profusely ornamented as those of the western ones, but, as Mr. Millers  observes, \"everything seems in its proper place and fitly  proportioned: all harmonize, and taken altogether, give a general  character of lightness and elegance. This is nowhere more conspicuous  than in the roof; the plain ribs of which, diverging from their  imposts, instead of crossing each other and spreading into intricate  forms, go straight to a longitudinal midline running from west to  east, and decorated with coloured figures or flowers where the  springers meet it. There is a precise line of separation between this  and the more elaborate ceiling of Bishop Hotham's work; being thus  brought into contact the two may be compared with singular  advantage.\"[41]    [Footnote 40: Rickman.]    [Footnote 41: Millers' Description of Ely Cathedral, p. 74.]    The bases of the piers of the lower arches are octagonal, but the  shafts are cylindrical, surrounded by slenderer detached ringed shafts  with foliated capitals, all of Purbeck marble. The triforium (except  in the first and second bays on both sides,) extends over the aisles,  and is lighted by large windows with Decorated tracery in the outer  wall; and the arches are separated by a cluster of slender shafts into  two smaller ones with trefoil heads; and between the two is a  quatrefoil; all highly adorned with mouldings. Between each of these  lower arches is an enriched corbel of Purbeck marble, adorned with  foliage in high relief, from which rises the vaulting-shaft, in a  group of three, between the arches of the triforium to the base of the  clerestory, having a capital of leafage, and from the top of which  spring the ribs of the vaulting. The spandrils throughout are  relieved with trefoils and quatrefoils, deeply sunk and backed with  Purbeck marble; and, on the whole, the contrast of light and shade,  depth and projection, produces a very fine effect. The clerestory  arches are of the same span, but each is divided into three smaller  ones, the centre arch being higher than those on either side, in order  to admit light through the windows behind, which are three  lancet-shaped lights under one arch in the outer wall, and are, we  believe, original; these windows have been filled with stained glass,  which is another important step towards the general improvement.    The windows of the aisles and triforium were originally three  lancet-shaped lights under one arch, but were replaced in the  fourteenth and fifteenth centuries by larger windows of a flamboyant  character. In the first and second bays on both sides the triforium  windows are placed in the inner wall, probably to give more light to  the high altar, the position of which was indicated by a boss in the  ceiling with a figure of St. Peter; and also to give greater effect to  the rich and gorgeous shrine of St. Etheldreda, said to have been of  pure silver adorned with jewels, which at that period stood near the  altar and to her place of sepultre, indicated by a boss in the ceiling  with her effigy on it. The tracery in these windows bears a similarity  to those in the corresponding arches of Hotham's work, but is not so  ornamented. All have been filled with stained glass by Mr. Wailes, the  expense defrayed out of the east window fund:         The western window on the north side--The descent of the       Holy Ghost, with figures and emblems.         The eastern window--The Ascension, with figures, &c.         The western window on the south side--Incidents from the       history of Moses, with figures, &c.         The eastern window--Incidents from the history of Elijah,       with devices, &c.    \"The east end,\" says Mr. Millers, \"is eminently beautiful, and will  not by any means shrink from comparison with the more gorgeous  termination of any church built after great end windows came into  fashion. There are two tiers of lights; the lower consists of three  very high lancet-shaped lights, nearly all equal; the second of five,  the middle one being higher, and those on the sides gradually  lower.\"[42] They are enriched by slender columns, with leafy capitals,  and ornamented with toothed and other mouldings, presenting altogether  more gracefulness and elegance than one large window filling nearly  the whole end. In the last century Bishop Mawson had formed a design  of filling this window (for it is generally considered as one window  of eight lights,) with stained glass, and selected an artist to carry  it into effect; the work, however, was not then finished; a figure of  St. Peter, and the arms of the bishop and contemporary members of the  Chapter, are the only remains of it known to be in existence, and  these were lately removed from the centre lancet and placed in the  east window of the north triforium of the Nave. The window has at  length been completed by the liberality of Bishop Sparke, who gave in  his lifetime a large sum for that purpose.[43] The bishop died some  few years after making his munificent donation, and his two sons, Rev.  J.H. Sparke and Rev. E.B. Sparke, then Canons of the cathedral, as  Trustees of the fund, took steps to carry his wishes into effect.  Several designs were prepared, and one by Mr. Wailes was selected, but  the execution was deferred for some years in order that advantage  might be taken of further experience, and thus, if possible, to  realize some of those gorgeous effects which have made the thirteenth  century windows of Canterbury, Chartres, Bourges, and elsewhere, so  justly celebrated.    [Footnote 42: Millers' Description of Ely Cathedral, p. 76.]    [Footnote 43: See note p. 53.]    The eastern lancets were executed by Mr. Wailes in 1857, and the  representatives of the donor have good reason to be satisfied with the  result. The general effect produced is magnificent; the three lower  lancets in particular present that happy combination of sparkling  brilliancy with that somewhat mysterious"]]]
