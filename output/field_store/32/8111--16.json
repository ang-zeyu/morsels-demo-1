Now, as an additional  test, let him turn to the key at the end of this work, the key to  Hymenomycetes. He must have learned enough by this time to know that his  mushroom belongs to this class, namely, the one that has spores produced  upon the lower part of the cap, and, also, that it is an Agaric, from  its having gills on the under side. Let him begin with Section A, \"with  cap.\" 1. Mushrooms with radiating gills beneath caps (Agarics). The key  then follows: 1. Plants fleshy, soon decaying. 2. Turn to number 2.  There are two descriptions, juice milky and juice watery; he will choose  the second one, which is followed by the number 3. Then follows, stem  central or nearly so; this agrees with the plant, and leads to 4. The  first line reads \"white spores,\" which is correct; then comes 5. There  are four lines with descriptions, the last one, \"no ring and no volva,\"  is right, which leads to 7. There are here two lines belonging to 7, the  second one, \"gills in the form of folds, obtuse edge,\" is correct, and  points to 10. This reads, \"Gills decurrent, plant terrestrial,  Cantharellus.\" The Key gives the name of the _genus_ only. In the list  of descriptions an attempt is made to mention some of the commonest  species. These directions apply to all the keys alike.      DIVISION I.    Key to Hymenomycetes, Membrane Fungi.    Hymenomycetes or membrane fungi are divided into two sections:      Section A, with cap.    Section B, without cap.    Section A is divided into four classes:      I. Mushrooms with radiating gills beneath caps, gill-bearing       mushrooms (Agarics).     II. With pores or tubes beneath caps (Polyporei).    III. With spines or teeth beneath the cap or branches (Hydnei).     IV. Where the spore-bearing surface beneath the cap is even, smooth,       or slightly wrinkled (Thelephorei).    Section B is divided into two classes:      I. Plants club-shaped and simple, or bush-like and branched       (Clavariei).     II. Plants gelatinous and irregular (Tremellinei).      SECTION A.

Their head man can't  understand why it isn't necessary for us to do the same.\"    \"Has he suggested that his techneers want a look at our motors, sir?\"    Hobart unbent a little. It was as if in that question he had read  something which pleased him. \"So far we've managed not to understand  that. And if anyone tries it on his own, refer him to me--understand?\"    \"Yes, sir!\" Some of the relief in Raf's tone came through, and he saw  that the captain was watching him narrowly.    \"You don't like these people, Kurbi?\"    The pilot replied with the truth. \"I don't feel easy with them, sir.  Not that they've shown any unfriendliness. Maybe it's because they're  alien--\"    He had said the wrong thing and knew it immediately.    \"That sounds like prejudice, Kurbi!\" Hobart's voice carried the snap  of a reprimand.    \"Yes, sir,\" Raf said woodenly. That had done it as far as the captain  was concerned. The fierce racial and economical prejudices which had  been the keystones of the structure of Pax had left their shadow on  Terra's thinking. Nowadays a man would better be condemned for murder  than for prejudice against another--it was the unforgivable crime. And  in that unconsidered answer Raf had rendered unreliable in the eyes of  authority any future report on the aliens which he might be forced to  make.    Silently cursing his lack of judgment, Raf made a careful check of the  flyer, which might not be necessary but going through the motions of  doing his duty gave him some relief. Once the idea struck him of  claiming some trouble that would take them back to the spacer for  repairs. But Hobart was too good a mechanic himself not to see through  that.    They covered the second stage of their flight by evening, this time  putting down on an island where, by some ancient and titanic feat of  labor, the top had been sheared off a central mountain to make a base.  A ring of reefs cut off the land from the action of the waves. At once  a party of aliens left the main company and made their way down the  mountain to prowl along the shore. They made a discovery of sorts, for  Raf saw them ring in some object they had pulled up on the sand. What  it was and what meaning it had for them they did not try to explain to  the Terrans.    The party spent the night there, the four spacemen wrapped in their  sleeping rolls by the flitter, the aliens in their globe ship. The  Terrans did not miss the fact that the others had unobtrusively posted  guards at the only two places where the mountain could be climbed. And  each of those guards cradled in the crook of his arm one of the rifle  weapons.    They were aroused shortly after dawn. As far as Raf could see the  island was barren of life, or else any creature native to it kept  prudently out of the way while the flyers were there. They took off,  the globe rising like a balloon into the morning sky, the flitter  waiting until it was air-borne before scaling after it.    The mountainous island where they had based was the sea sentinel of an  archipelago, which they saw spread out below them as if someone had  flung a handful of pebbles into a shallow pool. Most of the islands  were merely rocky crags. But there were two which showed the green of  small open fields, and Raf thought he caught a glimpse of a dome house  on the last.    They were now over a region thick with islands, the first collection  giving way to a second and then a third. Raf, expecting no sudden move  on the part of the globe he trailed, was startled when the alien ship  made a downward swoop. At the same time the warrior seated beside him  tugged at the sleeve of his tunic and jabbed a finger toward the  ground, clearly an order to follow. Raf cut speed and cautiously lost  altitude, determined that he was not going to be rushed into any move  for which he did not know the reason.    The globe was hovering over a small island set a little apart from the  others. A moment later Soriki's excited voice drew Raf's attention  from his controls to what was going on below.    \"There's, people down there! Look at them run!\"    They were too far away to be sure of the nature of the brown-gray  things so close to the color of the sea-washed rock that they could  only be detected when they moved. But it was evident that they were  alive, and as Raf brought the flitter closer, he was also certain that  they ran on their two hind feet instead of on an animal's four pads.    From the under part of the globe ship licked a tongue of fire. With  the force of a whiplash it coursed across the rock and in its passing  embrace, the creatures below writhed and withered to charred heaps.  They had no chance under that methodical blasting. The alien beside  Raf signaled again for a drop. He patted the weapon that he held and  motioned for Raf to release the covering of the windshield. But the  pilot shook his head firmly.    This might be war. The aliens could have a very good reason for their  deadly attack on the creatures surprised below. But he wanted no part  of it, nor did he want to get any closer to the scene of slaughter.  And he made an emphatic gesture that the windshield could not be  opened while the flitter was air-borne.    But as he did so they glided down, and he caught a single good look at  what was going on on the rock--a look which remained to haunt his  dreams for long years to come. For now he saw clearly the creatures  who ran fruitlessly for safety. Some reached the edge of the cliff and  leaped to what was an easier death in the sea. But too many others  could not make it and died in flaming agony. And they were not all of  one size!    Children! There was no mistaking the infant in its mother's arms, the  two small ones who fled hand in hand until one stumbled and the  burning lash caught them both as the other strove to pull the fallen  to its feet. Raf gagged. He triggered the controls and soared up and  away, fighting the heaving in his middle, shaking off with one savage  jerk the insistent pawing hand of the alien who wanted to join in the  fun.    \"Did you see that?\" he demanded of Soriki.    For once the com-tech sounded subdued. \"Yes,\" he replied shortly.    \"Those were children,\" Raf hammered home the point.    \"Young ones anyway,\" the com-tech conceded. \"Maybe they aren't people.  They had fur all over them--\"    Raf grinned mirthlessly. Should he now accuse Soriki of prejudice?  What did it matter if a thinking creature was clothed in a space suit,  silken bandages, or natural fur--it was still a thinking creature. And  he was sure that those had been intelligent creatures he had just seen  blasted without a chance to fight back. If these were the enemy the  aliens feared, he could understand the vicious cruelty of the attack  which had killed the man he had been shown back in the city. Fire  against primitive spears was not equal, and when the spears got their  chance they must make up for much to balance the scales of justice.    He did not even wonder why his emotions were so wholeheartedly  enlisted upon the side of the furred people. Nor did he try to analyze  his feelings. He was only sure that more than ever he wanted to be  free of the aliens and out of this whole venture.    The warrior sharing his seat was sulking now, twisting about to look  back at the island as Raf circled in ever-widening glides to get away  from the site and yet not lose track of the globe when it would have  finished its dirty business and take once more to the air. But the  alien ship was in no hurry to leave.    \"They are making sure,\" Soriki reported. \"Giving the whole island a  fire bath. I wonder what that stuff is--\"    \"I'd just as soon not know,\" Raf returned from between set teeth. \"If  that is one of their pieces of precious knowledge, we're as well off  without it--\" he stopped short. Perhaps he had said too much. But  Terra had been racked by the torrid horror of atomic war, until all  his kind had been so revolted that it was bred into them not to meddle  again with such weapons. And war by fire aroused in them that old  horror. Surely Soriki must feel it too, and when the com-tech did not  comment, Raf was sure of that. He hoped that the slaughter had made  some impression on the captain and on Lablet into the bargain.    But when, as if sated with killing, the globe rose again from its  position over the island, moving almost sluggishly into the fresh sky,  he had to follow it on. More islands were below, and he feared that  each one might show some sign of life and tempt the killers to a  second hunting.    Luckily that did not happen. The chains of islands became a cape as  they had on the coast of the western continent. And now the globe  swung to the south, trailing the shore line. Forests made green  splotches with bluish overtones running from the sea cliffs back to  carpet the land. So far no signs of civilization were to be seen. This  land was as untouched as that where the spacer had landed.    Then they saw the bay, stretching out wide arms to engulf the sea. It  could have harbored a whole fleet. And marching down to its waters  were broad levels of buildings, a giant's staircase leading from sea  to cliff tops.    \"They had it here--!\"    Raf saw what Soriki meant by that outburst. Destruction had struck. He  had seen the atomic ruins of his own world, those which were free  enough from radiation to explore. But he had never seen anything like  these chilling scars. In long strips the very stone which provided  foundation for the tiered city had been churned and boiled, had run in  rivulets of lava down to the sea, enclosing narrow tongues of still  untouched structures. The fire whip the globe had used, magnified to  some infinitely greater extent--? It could be.    The alien at his side pressed tightly against the windshield gazing  down at the ruins. And now he mouthed a gabble of words which was  echoed by his fellow sitting "]]]
