HARRY ESMOND'S BOYHOOD           _Henry Esmond_, by William Makepeace Thackeray, is considered one       of the greatest, if not the greatest, of historical novels. It       describes life in England during the first years of the eighteenth       century, dealing chiefly with people of wealth and high position.       \"Harry Esmond's Boyhood\" narrates the early career of the hero, who       was a poor orphan and an inmate of the family of his kinsman, the       Viscount of Castlewood.    Harry Esmond had lived to be past fourteen years old; had never  possessed but two friends, and had a fond and affectionate heart that  would fain attach itself to somebody, and did not seem at rest until it  had found a friend who would take charge of it.    At last he found such a friend in his new mistress, the lady of  Castlewood. The instinct which led Harry Esmond to admire and love the  gracious person, the fair apparition whose beauty and kindness had so  moved him when he first beheld her, became soon a devoted affection and  passion of gratitude, which entirely filled his young heart that as yet  had had very little kindness for which to be thankful.    There seemed, as the boy thought, in every look or gesture of this fair  creature, an angelical softness and bright pity--in motion or repose she  seemed gracious alike; the tone of her voice, though she uttered words  ever so trivial, gave him a pleasure that amounted almost to anguish. It  cannot be called love, that a lad of fourteen years of age felt for an  exalted lady, his mistress, but it was worship. To catch her glance; to  divine her errand, and run on it before she had spoken it; to watch,  follow, adore her, became the business of his life. Meanwhile, as is the  way often, his idol had idols of her own, and never thought of or  suspected the admiration of her little adorer.    My Lady had on her side three idols: first and foremost, [v]Jove and  supreme ruler, was her lord, Harry's patron, the good [v]Viscount of  Castlewood. All wishes of his were laws with her. If he had a headache,  she was ill. If he frowned, she trembled. If he joked, she smiled and  was charmed. If he went a-hunting, she was always at the window to see  him ride away. She made dishes for his dinner; spiced his wine for him;  hushed the house when he slept in his chair, and watched for a look when  he woke. Her eyes were never tired of looking at his face and wondering  at its perfection. Her little son was his son, and had his father's look  and curly brown hair. Her daughter Beatrix was his daughter, and had his  eyes--were there ever such beautiful eyes in the world? All the house  was arranged so as to bring him ease and give him pleasure.    Harry Esmond was happy in this pleasant home. The happiest period of all  his life was this; and the young mother, with her daughter and son, and  the orphan lad whom she protected, read and worked and played, and were  children together. If the lady looked forward--as what fond woman does  not?--toward the future, she had no plans from which Harry Esmond was  left out; and a thousand and a thousand times, in his passionate and  impetuous way, he vowed that no power should separate him from his  mistress; and only asked for some chance to happen by which he might  show his [v]fidelity to her.    The second fight which Harry Esmond had was at fourteen years of age,  with Bryan Hawkshaw, Sir John Hawkshaw's son, who, advancing the opinion  that Lady Castlewood henpecked my Lord, put Harry in so great a fury  that Harry fell on him and with such rage that the other boy, who was  two years older and far bigger than he, had by far the worst of the  assault. It was interrupted by Doctor Tusher, the clergyman, who was  just walking out of the dinner-room.    Bryan Hawkshaw got up bleeding at the nose, having indeed been  surprised, as many a stronger man might have been, by the fury of the  attack on him.    \"You little beggar,\" he said, \"I'll murder you for this.\"    And indeed he was big enough.    \"Beggar or not,\" said Harry, grinding his teeth, \"I have a couple of  swords, and if you like to meet me, as man to man, on the terrace  to-night--\"    And here, the doctor coming up, the [v]colloquy of the young champions  ended. Very likely, big as he was, Hawkshaw did not care to continue a  fight with such a ferocious opponent as this had been.    One day, some time later, Doctor Tusher ran into Castlewood House, with  a face of consternation, saying that smallpox had made its appearance at  the blacksmith's house in the village, which was also an alehouse, and  that one of the maids there was down with it.    Now, there was a pretty girl at this inn, called Nancy Sievewright, a  bouncing, fresh-looking lass, whose face was as red as the hollyhocks  over the pales of the garden behind the inn. Somehow it often happened  that Harry Esmond fell in with Nance Sievewright's bonny face. When  Doctor Tusher brought the news that the smallpox was at the  blacksmith's, Harry Esmond's first thought was of alarm for poor Nancy,  and then of shame and disquiet for the Castlewood family, lest he might  have brought this infection; for the truth is that Mr. Harry had been  sitting in a back room for an hour that day, where Nancy Sievewright was  with a little brother who complained of headache, and was lying crying  in a chair by the corner of the fire or in Nancy's lap.    Little Beatrix screamed at the news; and my Lord cried out, \"God bless  me!\" He was a brave man, and not afraid of death in any shape but this.  \"We will take the children and ride away to Walcote,\" he said.    To love children and be gentle with them was an instinct rather than  merit in Harry Esmond; so much so that he thought almost with a feeling  of shame of his liking for them and of the softness into which it  betrayed him. On this day the poor fellow had not only had his young  friend, the milkmaid's brother, on his knee, but had been drawing  pictures and telling stories to the little Frank Castlewood, who was  never tired of Harry's tales and of his pictures of soldiers and horses.  As luck would have it, Beatrix had not on that evening taken her usual  place, which generally she was glad enough to have, on Harry's knee. For  Beatrix, from the earliest time, was jealous of every caress which was  given her little brother Frank. She would fling away even from the  [v]maternal arms, if she saw Frank had been there before her; insomuch  that Lady Esmond was obliged not to show her love for her son in  presence of the little girl, and embrace one or the other alone. Beatrix  would turn pale and red with rage if she caught signs of intelligence or  affection between Frank and his mother; would sit apart and not speak  for a whole night if she thought the boy had a better fruit or a larger  cake than hers; would fling away a ribbon if he had one, and would utter  [v]infantile sarcasms about the favor shown her brother.    So it chanced upon this very day, when poor Harry Esmond had had the  blacksmith's son and the [v]peer's son, alike upon his knee, little  Beatrix, who would come to him willingly enough with her book and  writing, had refused him, seeing the place occupied by her brother.  Luckily for her, she had sat at the farther end of the room, away from  him, playing with a spaniel dog which she had, and talking to Harry  Esmond over her shoulder, as she pretended to caress the dog, saying  that Fido would love her, and she would love Fido and nothing but Fido"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19723"],[0,"The Cliff Ruins of Canyon de Chelly, Arizona (#15)"],[1,"together and incorporated bodily. On the edge of the  rectangular space there is a drilled hole, 3 inches in diameter, shown  in the illustration. Three feet to the south there is another, 6 inches  in diameter.    If this structure was a dome-shape oven, and it is difficult to imagine  it anything else, its occurrence here is important. It is well known  that the dome-shape oven, which is very common in all the pueblos, in  some villages being numbered by hundreds, is not an aboriginal feature,  but was borrowed outright from the Mexicans. If the structure above  described was an oven, it is clear evidence of the occupancy of these  ruins within the historic period--it might almost be said within the  last century. No other structure of the kind was found in the canyon,  however, and it should be stated that the ovens of the pueblos are as  a rule rather larger in size than this and usually constructed of small  stones and mud--sometimes of regular masonry plastered. There is a  suggestion here, which is further borne out by the chimney-like  structures to be discussed later, that only the idea of these structures  was brought here, without detailed knowledge of how to carry it out--as  if, for example, they were built by novices from description only.    Figure 27 is the ground plan of a small village ruin situated at the  mouth of Del Muerto at the point marked 16 on the map. The site, which  is an excellent one, but rather difficult of access, overlooks the  bottom land at the junction of the canyons and a long strip on the  opposite side, together with a considerable area above. The approach is  over smooth sandstone inclined at such an angle as to make it difficult  to maintain a footing, but the ruin can be reached without artificial  aid.      [Illustration: Fig. 26--Plan of oven-like structure.]    The village was not of large extent and contained but one kiva, but the  walls were well constructed and the masonry throughout is exceptionally  good. The exterior wall of the western rooms was constructed of small  stones neatly laid. The eastern room of the two was built after the  other, and entrance was had by an almost square opening 2 feet from  the ground. To facilitate ingress, a notch was dug in the wall about  8 inches from the ground. There was no communication between the rooms,  the western room being entered by a small doorway on the western side,  about 8 inches from the ground, 3 feet high and 14 inches wide. There  was no plastering in the interior of these rooms.      [Illustration: Plate LI    Small Village, Ruin No. 16, Canyon De Chelly]    The kiva is 15 feet in diameter on the floor, and about 23 feet in its  exterior diameter. The walls are 3 feet thick above the bench level and  4 feet thick below it. The interior was plastered with a number of  successive coats, probably four or five in all; but although the wall is  still standing to a height of 4 feet or more above the bench, there are  gaps on the eastern and western sides which render it impossible to say  whether doorways were there or not. The eastern break exposes the  western side of the inclosing wall, which is smoothly finished as though  there were originally a recess here. There are rectangular inclosing  walls on the east and south; the northern side was formed by the cliff  against which the kiva rests, while on the west there are no traces of  an inclosing wall. The triangular spaces formed by the inclosing walls  on the northeast and southeast sides of the kiva were not filled up in  the customary manner, but appear to have been preserved as storerooms.  The southeastern space was connected with the kiva by a narrow doorway,  shown in the plan, and another doorway, completely sealed, led from this  space into the room adjoining on the east. The latter doorway had not  been used for a long time prior to the abandonment of the ruin, and its  opening into the rectangular room was carefully concealed from that side  by several successive coats of plaster.      [Illustration: Fig. 27--Ground plan of a small village, ruin No. 16.]    On the south side of the kiva and outside the rectangular wall is a  square buttress or chimney-like construction, 4 by 3 feet, inclosing a  shaft 10 by 5 inches. This feature will be discussed in another place.  It was added after the wall was completed, and embedded in it, about a  foot from the ground, is a heavy beam about 5 inches in diameter. Plate  LI, which shows the whole front of the village, will make this feature  clear. The beam projects from the kiva wall at or under the floor  level, and seems to have no reference to the shaft, which is, however,  shouldered to accommodate it. Similar beams project from the walls to  the east, about 8 inches above the bed rock.    In the room east of the kiva no doorway was found. The walls are still  intact to a minimum height of 6 feet from the floor, except in the  southeast corner, where they are 3 feet. The opening described, which  occurs in the southwest corner of the room, was 4 feet from the floor;  and in the southeast corner, where the wall is broken down, there now  are remains of one side of a similar opening on the same level. No  stains of smoke are found on the exterior coat of plaster in this room,  but the coats underneath were much blackened. The room north of the one  described, and adjoining the kiva, was also without a doorway, unless it  existed in the northeast corner, next the cliff, where no trace of walls  now remains. The walls of this room, now 6 feet high, were plastered and  show old smoke stains. The wall on the western side of the kiva is very  rough, as though at one time another wall existed outside of it. This is  shown in plate LII, which shows also the debris, consisting of ashes,  sheep dung, and refuse, well compacted, upon which the wall rests.      [Illustration: Fig. 28--Ruins on a large rock.]    West of the kiva and on the extreme edge of the cliff are the remains of  two small apartments, a trifle below the surface of the ledge and with a  3-foot wall on the south. These are too small for habitations, and were  used probably for the storage of corn. About 100 feet west of the group  described, on the same bench, there are remains of a large room, divided  into two, and of quite rough construction. It contains several Navaho  dead and may be of Navaho origin.      [Illustration: Plate LII    Walls Resting on Refuse in Ruin No. 16]    A type of site which is abundant in the San Juan country and is found in  other regions, but is very rare in this, is shown in figure 28. This  example, which occurs in the upper part of Del Muerto, is the only one  of its kind in the canyons. A large mass of rock, smoothed and rounded  by atmospheric erosion, but still connected with the cliff at one point,  juts out into the bottom, a large area of which is commanded by it. At  three different levels there are remains of rooms, the group on the  summit being the largest. It is doubtful whether any of these remains  represent permanent villages, but it is possible that the uppermost one  did. It is therefore included in this place.      [Illustration: Fig. 29--Ground plan of ruins No. 49]    At the point marked 49 on the map there is a ruin or group of ruins  which presents some anomalous features. Figure 29 shows in detail the  distribution of the remains. The rooms were located on narrow benches in  the cliff, the principal part on a high, narrow bench, 40 or 50 feet  above the top of the talus and over 300 feet above the canyon bottom.  Access to the upper ledge from the top of the talus is exceedingly  difficult, requiring a climb over almost vertical rock for 40 feet.  Above the ledge there is massive sandstone, but below it for 100 feet or  more there is an area of cross bedding, and the rock has an almost  vertical cleavage, apparently standing upright in thin slabs 2 to 6  inches thick. Access was had by aid of the rough projections of the  slabs, aided where necessary by hand and foot holes pecked in the rock.  At several places little platforms of masonry have been built.    At the northern end of the upper ledge there are five small cells  occupying its whole width, and whose front wall follows the winding  ledge. The walls are about 5 feet high, and their tops bear the marks of  the poles which carried the roof. There are no exterior openings, nor is  there any evidence of a means of communication between the rooms; but in  the second room from the south two stones project from the wall inside,  near the southeastern corner, forming rude steps, doubtless to a  trapdoor in the roof. These cells could hardly have been used as  habitations. The floors are covered with many lumps of clay, which  apparently formed part of the roof.    To the south of this cluster of cells there was a large room of  irregular shape on a level about 8 feet higher. The remainder of the  ledge, which is about on the same level as this large room, is almost  covered with large bowlders, but at several points on it other remains  of walls occur. The largest room of all was near its center. It was  built against the cliff, which formed one of its sides, and measured  about 16 by 6 feet. There are no evidences of any partitions or roof,  the latter probably being formed by the overhanging rock. As the room  was built partly on the sloping rock, the floor is very uneven. It could  hardly have been used as a habitation, but may have been employed for  the storage of water.    The southern end of the lower ledge merges into the head of the talus,  the northern part drops down by a sharply sloping and in places an  almost vertical wall of about 30 feet; thence it descends to the bottom  by a long slope of bare rock, generally passable on foot. The lower  ledge is about 50 feet above the upper. Upon it are scattered the  remains of a few rooms of the same general character as those above, but  smaller. Many of these have been"]]]
