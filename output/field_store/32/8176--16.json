SIZE.--Length, 5 to 5-1/2 inches; extent of wing, 18 to 20 inches.    More information is required regarding the habits of this bat.      _GENUS CYNOPTERUS_.    This genus has four molars less than the last, a shorter muzzle; the  cheek-bones or zygomatic arch more projecting; tongue rather longer  and more tapering, and slightly extensile.    Dental formula: Inc., 4/4 or 4/2; can., 1--1/1--1; premolars,  2--2/3--3; molars, 2--2/2--2.      NO. 33. CYNOPTERUS MARGINATUS.  _The Small Fox-Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 14_).    NATIVE NAME.--_Chamgadili_, Hindi; _Coteekan voulha_, Singhalese.    HABITAT.--India generally, and Ceylon.    [Figure: _Cynopterus marginatus_.]    DESCRIPTION.--General colour fulvous olivaceous, paler beneath and  with an ashy tinge; ears with a narrow margin of white (_Jerdon_.)  A reddish smear on neck and shoulders of most specimens; membranes  dusky brown. Females paler (_Kellaart_).    SIZE.--Length, 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 inches; extent of wing, 17 to 20  inches.    This bat is found all over India; it is frugivorous exclusively,  though some of this sub-order are insectivorous. Blyth says he kept  some for several weeks; they would take no notice of the buzz of an  insect held to them, but are ravenous eaters of fruit, each devouring  its own weight at a meal, voiding its food but little changed whilst  slowly munching away; of guava it swallows the juice only. Blyth's  prisoners were females, and after a time they attracted a male which  hovered about them for some days, roosting near them in a dark  staircase; he was also caught, with one of the females who had escaped  and joined him. Dr. Dobson writes that in three hours one of these  bats devoured twice its own weight. This species usually roosts in  trees.      NO. 34. MACROGLOSSUS (PTEROPUS) MINIMUS.  _The Tenasserim Fox-Bat_.    NATIVE NAME.--_Lowo-assu_ (dog-bat), Javanese.    HABITAT.--The Himalayas, Burmah, Tenasserim, and the Indian  Archipelago.    DESCRIPTION.--Ears half length of head, narrow and rounded at tip;  face abruptly narrowed in front of eyes; muzzle long, narrow,  cylindrical; lower jaw slightly projecting; eyes large; tongue very  long, last third attenuated, covered with brush-like papillae;  interfemoral membrane very narrow, especially at root of tail; fur  reddish brown, and very long.    SIZE.--Head and body, 2-3/10 inches.    Like other _Pteropi_ this bat feeds on fruit of every description,  but particularly attacks the various cultivated varieties of  _Eugenia_ (Jamoon).      _GENUS EONYCTERIS_.    Muzzle long and cylindrical; nostrils scarcely projecting; upper lip  with a shallow vertical groove in front; _index finger without a  claw_; thumb short; part of the terminal phalanx included in the wing  membrane; metacarpal bone of the second finger equal to the index  finger in length; tail short and distinct; the base contained in the  narrow interfemoral membrane; tongue long, as in _Macroglossus_.    Dentition: Inc., 4/4; can., 1--1/1--1; premolars, 2--2/2--2; molars,  3--3/3--3.      NO. 35. EONYCTERIS SPELAEA.    HABITAT.--Burmah.    DESCRIPTION.--Head long; muzzle narrow, cylindrical, abruptly  narrowed in front of the eyes; nostrils with an intervening  emargination, which also passes down to the lips; tongue very long  and pointed; ears conical, with rounded tips; body clothed with very  short and thinly-spread fur of a uniform dark brown colour; the fur  on the head extends only as far as the inner corners of the eye,  leaving the rest of the face naked; tail half an inch. On each side,  and a little behind the anal opening, are two small, kidney-shaped  subcutaneous glandular bodies.    SIZE.--Head and body, 4 inches; tail, 1/2 inch.    Found in Farm Caves, Moulmein. The absence of the claw on the index  finger is specially to be noted.      MICROCHIROPTERA.      SUB-FAMILY VAMPYRIDAE.      _GENUS MEGADERMA_.    Bats with simple or complicated nose-leaves or membranes. The conch  of the ear very large, and joined together on the top of the head;  tragus large and bifurcated; nasal membranes complicated; no tail;  wings remarkably ample. They have four incisors below but none above,  the intermaxillaries remaining cartilaginous.    Dental formula: Inc., 0/4; can., 1--1/1--1; pre-m., 2--2/2--2;  molars, 3--3/3--3.      NO. 36. MEGADERMA LYRA.  _The Large-eared Vampire Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 15_).    HABITAT.--India and Ceylon.    [Figure: _Megaderma lyra_.]    DESCRIPTION.--Above ashy blue, slaty or pale mouse colour; albescent  or yellowish ashy beneath; nasal appendage large, oblong, free at  the tip, reaching to the base of the ears with a fold down the centre;  tragus (_oreillon_) cordate, two-lobed, anterior long, narrow and  pointed, posterior lobe half the height and rounded; muzzle  truncated; under-lip cleft; wing membranes dark brown.    SIZE.--Head and body, 3 or 3-1/2 inches; wing extent, 14 to 19 inches.    Very abundant in old buildings. They are beyond doubt blood-suckers.  Blyth noticed one fly into his room one evening with a small  _vespertilio_, which it dropped on being chased. The smaller bat was  weak from loss of blood, and next morning (the Megaderm having been  caught), on both bats being put into the same cage, the little one  was again attacked and devoured; it was seized both times behind the  ear. McMaster writes that in Rangoon he had a tame canary killed by  a bat, and the bird's mate soon afterwards was destroyed in the same  way. The case was clearly proved.    Mr. Frith informed Mr. Blyth that these bats were in the habit of  resorting to the verandah of his house at Mymensing, and that every  morning the ground under them was strewed with the hind quarters of  frogs, and the wings of large grasshoppers and crickets. On one  occasion the remains of a small fish were observed; but frogs  appeared to be their chief diet--never toads; and of a quiet evening  these animals could be distinctly heard crunching the heads and  smaller bones of their victims.      NO. 37. MEGADERMA SPECTRUM.  _The Cashmere Vampire_ (_Jerdon's No. 16_).    HABITAT.--Cashmere.    DESCRIPTION.--Above slaty cinereous, whitish beneath; the vertical  nose-leaf of moderate size, oval; inner lobe of tragus ovate  (_Jerdon_).    SIZE.--Two and three-quarter inches.    Dobson makes this bat synonymous with the last.      NO. 38. MEGADERMA SPASMA.    HABITAT.--Tenasserim, Ceylon.    [Figure: _Megaderma spasma_.]    DESCRIPTION.--Muzzle, ear-conch, and tragus similar to those of _M.  lyra_; the posterior portion of the tragus, however, is longer and  more attenuated upwards, and more acutely pointed; the nose-leaf is  shorter, with convex sides; but the anterior concave disc is  considerably larger, and the base of the thickened process is  cordate; thumbs and wings as in _M. lyra_; interfemoral membrane  deeper; the calcaneum stronger; colour the same.    SIZE.--Head and body, about 3 inches. This bat is alluded to by Jerdon  as _M. Horsfieldii_.      RHINOLOPHINAE.    Nasal leaf complicated, and crests resting on the forehead,  presenting more or less the figure of a horse-shoe; tail long and  placed in the interfemoral membrane; ears large, but separate, and  not joined at the base, as in the last genus; without a tragus, but  often with a lobe at the base of the outer margin; wings large and  long; forefinger of a single joint.      _GENUS RHINOLOPHUS_.    Nose-leaf cordate, or semi-orbicular, bi-lobed in front of the  nostrils; a longitudinal crest along the nose and an erect frontal  leaf posteriorly more or less lanceolate.--_Jerdon_.    Dental formula: Inc., 2/4; can., 1--1/1--1; premolars, 2--2/2--2;  molars, 3--3/3--3.      NO. 39. RHINOLOPHUS PERNIGER _vel_ LUCTUS.  _The Large Leaf-Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 17_).

CHAPTER VIII    ATTACK AND DEFENSE        The European War has demonstrated more clearly than ever before two  points in attack and defense. First, no people, or group of people, can  claim a monopoly on bravery. They all move forward and give up their  lives with the same utter abandon. Courage being equal, the advantage  goes to him in the attack who possesses superior leaders, greater  training, and better equipment. Second, a man's training and courage,  his clear eye and steady nerve, his soul's blood and iron, constitute a  better defense than steel and concrete.    A soldier has little business attacking or defending anything in this  day unless he is an athlete, unless he is skilled in the technique of  manoeuver, unless he is a good shot, unless he knows the value of many  features of the terrain (which means the nature of the country--its  hills, rivers, mountains, depressions, etc.--considered from a military  point of view), unless he is disciplined to a splendid degree, and  unless his training has imbued him with an irresistible desire to push  forward, to get at his opponent. Assuming, at least, as much as this, we  are prepared to consider the subject of the attack (the offensive).    To have your troops superior in number, condition, training, equipment,  and morale to that of your enemy; to be at the right place, at the right  time, and there to deliver a smashing, terrific blow--this is the  greatest principle of the attack. And history shows that victory goes  more often to him who attacks.    Initiative in war is no less valuable than in business life. Become at  once imbued with the desire to put \"the other fellow\" on the defensive.  That makes him somewhat dependent upon your own actions. That gives you  opportunities to fool him that he does not so fully enjoy. Your  commander can elect to attack any point of the defensive line. Your dead  and wounded--always a demoralizing element--are left behind. Your target  is stationary. Your side is closing in. The enemy is straining every  nerve to fire faster and more effectively, and still your side is  closing in. There is the thrill of motion.    To attack, you will usually require a greater number of troops than the  defense. Why so? Because you will be more exposed. You will have to move  forward, however dangerous the ground. Your enemy, for his protection,  will be certain to utilize and improve every advantage of cover. Your  losses will be greater. You should have a greater number of reserves to  fill the depleted ranks. If the defensive can maintain a better  (superior) fire, that is to say, a fire that kills and wounds a greater  number than the opposing fire (this we call fire superiority), he will  stop the advance of the attacking force unless that force is so superior  in numbers that it can send forward reinforcements after reinforcements  as an ocean sends shoreward its series of waves.    Suppose that you were in command of a group of men and that you were  ordered to attack. Just what principal points should you weigh? First,  you should avail yourself of every opportunity to obtain all information  of military value, such as the enemy's strength, his position, and  intentions. For this you would have to send out groups of reconnoitering  patrols exceptionally skilled in woodcraft, or trained to gather  information. As soon as such information as is available is reported to  you, you should at once begin the consideration of all the important  elements that affect your problem. You must not lose sight of what you  were sent out to do (your mission). Consider how this and that fact bear  upon your course of action (estimate the situation). For instance: the  enemy's force is reported to be greatly inferior to your own. He is out  of supplies. He is greatly fatigued with forced marches. His morale is  shattered on account of recent and frequent reverses. His camp is  disorganized. It is poorly guarded. Certain roads are in fine condition.  Others are very poor. Your troops are in splendid shape and excellent  spirits. They believe that they can crush the enemy and want to attack.  As you easily see, all such points have great significance in sizing up  the case (estimating the situation).    Having estimated the situation, you should investigate and consider all  possible courses of attack that are open to you. Don't ask any advice  from any one. Select the course that appears to offer the greatest  chance of success. Make up your mind what you are going to do (come to a  decision).    Having come to a decision, stick to it, right or wrong. Your next and  final thing to do is to put your decision into action. To do that, give  your subordinates the information they should possess; tell them what  you are going to do and how you are going to do it; i.e., issue your  orders.    A study of the orders of successful generals in history teaches us that  we will be greatly aided in issuing them, if we will observe a system.  We understand an order more easily and quickly if it conforms to some  plan with which we are familiar.    In order to give your group an opportunity to act with a greater degree  of teamwork, and intelligence in case of an emergency, it is necessary  to give it data (information) concerning the enemy. Your men should know  where there are friendly troops. Now tell them what you are going to do  (your plan), whether it be to attack, retire, or assume the defensive.  And then order the execution of that plan by assigning to each group its  task. Next tell (direct) what is to be done with the wagons (trains),  and last, state where you may be found at any time in case of need or  where messages may be sent to you.    Having issued the order, let us now observe the progress of the attack.  You are probably three or four thousand yards from the enemy. His  position is invisible. His artillery has opened fire. Your artillery is  replying. The troops must advance cautiously over exposed ground. They  are not firing. They are not deployed for action (in battle line). They  are waiting to get within as short a distance of the enemy's line as  possible, for their ammunition is limited; and after troops are actually  launched in the attack, control over them, for ordinary purposes, is  practically lost. The farther from the enemy the attack is launched, the  longer the exposure to their fire and the greater the number of  casualties, so the leaders of the different groups are taking advantage  of all the accidents of the ground, of all cover in advancing. They are  using one formation here, another there, with a view to minimizing the  losses and reaching an advantageous position as soon as possible where  they can open an effective fire on the enemy.    Now the enemy's fire is severe. Casualties are becoming heavy. The men  are growing restless. It is necessary to return the fire. Fire  superiority should be gained at once. Don't move forward until you gain  it. If difficult to gain, use every means at your disposal. When you  have it, keep it. Part of your men can advance when your side has fire  superiority. The remainder of the firing line should fire faster to  maintain that superiority. If you lose fire superiority, regain it. If  necessary, troops from the rear will generally be sent forward.    Now you are approaching the point where the charge is to be made.  Bayonets are fixed; not all at one time, for that would affect the  advantage that you possess with your fire. Groups that have been held  back in support are advanced. These are to be used at decisive moments.  They are held well in hand. The firing line is lost in noise and  confusion. Not so the supports; control is exercised over them. If they  are not used in the attack they can be used to great advantage to  complete the discomfort of the enemy after the clash (shock).    There is at last, if the enemy remains in his position, the clash.  Bayonet against bayonet, man against man, nerve against nerve. Apply the  great principle of attack and decide for yourself who the victor will  be. If successful, then organize your men and prepare for the pursuit or  for the return (counter attack) of the enemy.    Now you are to handle groups on the defense. You must bear in mind that  there are two kinds of defense: first, where you do nothing but defend  (passive defense); second, where you defend, but temporarily, with the  idea of attacking the enemy as soon as a favorable opportunity arises  (active defense). Let us assume that you have been ordered by superior  authority to locate and prepare a definite position to check the advance  of an enemy. Just what main points should you bear in mind? Suppose you  have found an ideal position; what conditions should it fulfil? You  should be able to see the enemy long before he arrives at your position.  Intervening objects and trees would make that impossible. You should be  hidden from his view. The ends of your lines (your flanks) should rest,  if possible, on ground easy to defend; for instance, a high mountain, a  large body of water, or an impassable swamp. A few acres of ground will  not hold tens of thousands of men. Therefore the extent of the ground  must be suitable for the size of your group (force or command). It would  be of great advantage to have such cover that one group (for instance, a  support) could move from this position to that without danger of being  fired upon or observed. A wise general has plans for any contingency. He  is either going to win or he is not going to win. If he loses, he should  have a means of escape (retreat). In selecting his position he should  place it where the enemy must attack or give up his mission. Verdun had  to be attacked before the advance on Paris from the east was  practicable.    In defense there is a generous allowance of advantages. Usually you have  time to select and prepare your position."]]]
