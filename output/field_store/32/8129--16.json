[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18854"],[0,"The Gourmet's Guide to Europe (#15)"],[1," Arthur Collins of Drury Lane was in  Brussels about a couple of years ago, he asked me to take him one  evening, after leaving the Scala, to the local Romano's. \"We haven't  such a place,\" I explained, \"but we can go to the Helder.\" \"I dined  there this evening,\" said A.C., \"it was a very good dinner, but deadly  dull; show me something livelier.\" We resolved to try the Filet de Sole  thinking, as it was close to the Palais d'Ete, we were certain to meet  some people there, but the place was empty. The fact is, Brussels has  little night-life beyond the taverns and bars of low character, and the  only high-class supper-room is the Savoy. If a stranger came to pass a  week in Brussels, and wanted to be shown round the restaurants, I should  start him with lunch at the Savoy on Monday morning, and finish him off  with supper at the Savoy on the following Sunday night, for he would  then be sure of beginning and ending well. The grill is excellent, and  by no means dear. 1 franc 75 centimes is charged for a chop or steak,  including _pommes de terre_ well served. The _hors-d'oeuvre_ are a  speciality at luncheon. There is great variety, and the pickled shrimps  would tickle the most jaded appetite.    On Monday night I should send my friend to dinner at the Epaule de  Mouton.    On Tuesday, I should say, \"Lunch at the Faille Dechiree and dine at the  Lion d'Or.\"    On Wednesday, \"Lunch at the Regina and dine at the Helder.\"    On Thursday, \"Lunch at the Filet de Sole and dine at Wiltcher's.\"    On Friday, \"Lunch at Justine's and dine at L'Etoile.\"    On Saturday, \"Lunch at the Belveder and dine at the Cafe Riche.\"    On Sunday, \"Lunch at Duranton's, and, if it is summer time, dine at the  Laiterie.\"    He will then have sampled all the restaurants in Brussels that are worth  troubling about, and will be very unlucky if he has not alighted upon  some dish worth remembering.    The Savoy is situated in the Rue de l'Eveque, by the side of the General  Post Office. It was originally a kind of offshoot from the American bar  and grill-room of the Grand Hotel. Being done in good spirit and with  good taste, it soon acquired favour, and at certain times in the day the  premises are almost too small. There are private dining-rooms upstairs,  and a restaurant on the first floor has lately been added. Everything is  _a la carte_. The _cafe extra_, for which 75 centimes is charged, is a  speciality. The manager is M.A. Reynier who speaks English like an  Englishman.    The Epaule de Mouton is in the Rue des Harengs, one of the little  streets already alluded to, which run from the Grand Place to the Rue  Marche aux Herbes. In this street, which is barely five yards wide, are  some of the best restaurants of the town; but the stranger must be  particular and not enter the wrong door, as they are all huddled  together, and the names of some of the establishments are very similar.  There is, for instance, a Gigot de Mouton next door to the Epaule de  Mouton, and there is a Filet de Boeuf. It is at the Epaule, however,  where the best cuisine will be found. Behind the door on entering a snug  corner for a _tete-a-tete_ is to be found. Although the title of the  establishment suggests Simpson's and a cut off the joint, the cuisine  will be found thoroughly French, and everything is well and tastefully  done. In ordering, it must be remembered that one _plat_ is enough for  two persons, and this is the rule in most Belgian restaurants. The  Burgundy at L'Epaule de Mouton is renowned.    La Faille Dechiree is at a corner of another little street, the Rue  Chair et Pain, close by the Rue des Harengs. The construction and  decoration are quaint; one sits in a kind of tunnel and eats _Homard a  l'Americaine_ which is a speciality of the house. Woodcock, when in  season, is also a dish to be ordered here.    Le Lion d'Or is a small establishment in the Rue Gretry, and may safely  be called the \"chic\" restaurant of Brussels. The salon downstairs is a  perfect little _bonbonniere_, and the rooms above are extremely cosy and  comfy. The proprietor is Adolph Letellier (of course called simply  \"Adolph\" by _habitues_ of the house), and he is extremely popular among  the young sports of the town. The _vrai_ gourmet will appreciate _les  plats les plus raffines_ on which Adolph prides himself. Everything is  _a la carte_, prices being plainly marked. They are not cheap. The  restaurant and rooms upstairs are open till two in the morning.    The Regina is a new restaurant at the top of the town, near the Porte de  Namur. Although only opened in 1901, it has been found necessary to  enlarge the premises, and the alterations are in progress at the moment  of writing. When completed, the restaurant on the first floor will be  more commodious and comfortable than it is at present. It is the good  kitchen that has made the reputation of the place, and if this is  maintained, the Regina will become one of the best patronised  restaurants in Brussels. Some people prefer to feed in the cafe on the  ground-floor but it is best to go upstairs, and, if possible, to obtain  a table on the glass-covered balcony in the front, which has a pleasant  outlook on the boulevards. The proprietor is Jules; he may have a  surname but no one seems to know what it is; to one and all he is  \"Jules,\" a capital _patron_ who, having been a waiter himself, knows how  to look after the personal tastes of his customers. These include the  officers of the grenadiers, the crack Belgian regiment, whose barracks  are close by, judges and barristers from the Palais de Justice, members  of the King's household (the royal palace being nearly opposite), actors  from the Moliere Theatre, sportsmen who foregather here on race-days,  and the better-class Bohemians. Jules has also a good English  _clientele_, and makes a speciality of certain English dishes. This is  the only place on the Continent I know which serves a really well-made  Irish stew. The Flemish dishes are also safe to try here. The prices are  very moderate, and the _plats du jour_ range from 1 franc to 1 franc 75  centimes, each _plat_ being enough for two persons. Breakfast dishes,  such as _Oeufs Gratines aux Crevettes_ and _Oeufs Brouilles au foie  de Volaille_, are also well done here. _Ecrevisses Regina_ is a special  dish of the house. There are always two special _plats du soir_. The  Medoc de la Maison at 3 francs the bottle is a La Rose and is _very_  good. Although the prices are low, there is nothing of the cheap and  nasty order about the place. I have before me the bill of a little lunch  for two served in December, which can be taken as a fair specimen of the  fare and the charges:--        Huitres de Zelande, 1 douzaine    3    frs.      1 bottle Sauterne                 5     \"      Oeufs en Cocotte                  1     \"      Haricot de Mouton (plat du jour)  1     \"      Foie gras Hummel                  2.50  \"      Salade de Laitue                  1     \"      Laitance de Harengs               1.50  \"      1 bottle Medoc                    3     \"      Cafe et liqueurs                  2.50  \"                                       ----------                                       20.50 frs.    At the same time, if one likes to lunch off a _plat du jour_, with a  glass of Gruber's beer, it can easily be done at the Regina for less  than 5 francs for two persons.    The Helder is in the Rue de l'Ecuyer, near the Opera House. It is a  smart restaurant and one dines well there. It is frequented by a good  class of people, but it has no particular character of its own. The  proprietor is M. Dominique Courtade, formerly a _chef_, and he should be  personally consulted if a special dinner is wanted. The Pontet Canet  (only to be had in half bottles) should be sampled; it is very fine.    The Filet de Sole is in the neighbourhood of the markets and close by  the Palais d'Ete. The proprietor is Emile Beaud. An excellent lunch can  be obtained here at a fixed price, and one can also eat _a la carte_.  Prices are lower than at most of the first-class restaurants, but the  cuisine and wines are both safe and sound. The Cantenac at 4 francs is  to be specially recommended, and the Medoc de la Maison at about 2  francs is also good. There are private rooms upstairs.    Wiltcher's, on the Boulevard de Waterloo, provides the best and cheapest  _table-d'hote_ in Brussels. The price is only 3 francs, and is wonderful  value for the money. The following is the menu of a dinner in January:--              Consomme a la Reine.        Filet de Sole a la Normande.             Quartier d'Agneau.          Mint Sauce a l'Anglaise.            Epinards a la Creme.      Poularde de Bruxelles en Cocotte.       Croquettes de Pommes de Terre.        Gangas du Japon a la Broche.           Compote de Mirabelles.              Salade de Laitue.               Glace Arlequin.              Biscuits de Reims.                    Cafe.    In old Mr. Wiltcher's time a good many people came from outside for the  excellent food here provided, but now so many families reside all the  year round in the hotel, that it is difficult to get a table for dinner  when it is not ordered beforehand. No matter what time of the year it  is, there is always poultry and game on Wiltcher's _carte_, and one  sometimes meets a strange bird here. Gangas is a Japanese partridge. The  birds migrate to Northern Africa in winter and often cross to Spain,  where they are caught in large numbers. The plumage of the gangas is  very beautiful and the flesh is excellent eating. The outarde, or little  bustard, is often to be had at Wiltcher's, and it is the only place at  which I have eaten the great bustard, whose flesh is very much like a  turkey's. White pheasant is another bird I remember here. Excepting in  its plumage, it in no way differs from the ordinary pheasant. A feature  of Wiltcher's dinner is that no fruit is ever included in the menu,  although"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18857"],[0,"A Journey to the Centre of the Earth (#15)"],[1,"of lava and looked silently on. They clearly took my uncle for a  lunatic; and--waited the result.    Suddenly the Professor uttered a wild, unearthly cry. At first I  imagined he had lost his footing, and was falling headlong into one of  the yawning gulfs. Nothing of the kind. I saw him, his arms spread out  to their widest extent, his legs stretched apart, standing upright  before an enormous pedestal, high enough and black enough to bear a  gigantic statue of Pluto. His attitude and mien were that of a man  utterly stupefied. But his stupefaction was speedily changed to the  wildest joy.    \"Harry! Harry! come here!\" he cried; \"make haste--wonderful--wonderful!\"    Unable to understand what he meant, I turned to obey his commands.  Neither Hans nor the other Icelanders moved a step.    \"Look!\" said the Professor, in something of the manner of the French  general, pointing out the pyramids to his army.    And fully partaking his stupefaction, if not his joy, I read on the  eastern side of the huge block of stone, the same characters, half eaten  away by the corrosive action of time, the name, to me a thousand times  accursed--    [Illustration: Runic Glyphs]    \"Arne Saknussemm!\" cried my uncle, \"now, unbeliever, do you begin to  have faith?\"    It was totally impossible for me to answer a single word. I went back to  my pile of lava, in a state of silent awe. The evidence was  unanswerable, overwhelming!    In a few moments, however, my thoughts were far away, back in my German  home, with Gretchen and the old cook. What would I have given for one of  my cousin's smiles, for one of the ancient domestic's omelettes, and for  my own feather bed!    How long I remained in this state I know not. All I can say is, that  when at last I raised my head from between my hands, there remained at  the bottom of the crater only myself, my uncle and Hans. The Icelandic  porters had been dismissed and were now descending the exterior slopes  of Mount Sneffels, on their way to Stapi. How heartily did I wish myself  with them!    Hans slept tranquilly at the foot of a rock in a kind of rill of lava,  where he had made himself a rough and ready bed. MY uncle was walking  about the bottom of the crater like a wild beast in a cage. I had no  desire, neither had I the strength, to move from my recumbent position.  Taking example by the guide, I gave way to a kind of painful somnolency,  during which I seemed both to hear and feel continued heavings and  shudderings in the mountain.    In this way we passed our first night in the interior of a crater.    Next morning, a grey, cloudy, heavy sky hung like a funereal pall over  the summit of the volcanic cone. I did not notice it so much from the  obscurity that reigned around us, as from the rage with which my uncle  was devoured.    I fully understood the reason, and again a glimpse of hope made my heart  leap with joy. I will briefly explain the cause.    Of the three openings which yawned beneath our steps, only one could  have been followed by the adventurous Saknussemm. According to the words  of the learned Icelander, it was only to be known by that one particular  mentioned in the cryptograph, that the shadow of Scartaris fell upon it,  just touching its mouth in the last days of the month of June.    We were, in fact, to consider the pointed peak as the stylus of an  immense sun-dial, the shadow of which pointed on one given day, like the  inexorable finger of fate, to the yawning chasm which led into the  interior of the earth.    Now, as often happens in these regions, should the sun fail to burst  through the clouds, no shadow. Consequently, no chance of discovering  the right aperture. We had already reached the 25th June. If the kindly  heavens would only remain densely clouded for six more days, we should  have to put off our voyage of discovery for another year, when certainly  there would be one person fewer in the party. I already had sufficient  of the mad and monstrous enterprise.    It would be utterly impossible to depict the impotent rage of Professor  Hardwigg. The day passed away, and not the faintest outline of a shadow  could be seen at the bottom of the crater. Hans the guide never moved  from his place. He must have been curious to know what we were about, if  indeed he could believe we were about anything. As for my uncle, he  never addressed a word to me. He was nursing his wrath to keep it warm!  His eyes fixed on the black and foggy atmosphere, his complexion hideous  with suppressed passion. Never had his eyes appeared so fierce, his nose  so aquiline, his mouth so hard and firm.    On the 26th no change for the better. A mixture of rain and snow fell  during the whole day. Hans very quietly built himself a hut of lava into  which he retired like Diogenes into his tub. I took a malicious delight  in watching the thousand little cascades that flowed down the side of  the cone, carrying with them at times a stream of stones into the \"vasty  deep\" below.    My uncle was almost frantic: to be sure, it was enough to make even a  patient man angry. He had reached to a certain extent the goal of his  desires, and yet he was likely to be wrecked in port.    But if the heavens and the elements are capable of causing us much pain  and sorrow, there are two sides to a medal. And there was reserved for  Professor Hardwigg a brilliant and sudden surprise which was to  compensate him for all his sufferings.    Next day the sky was still overcast, but on Sunday, the 28th, the last  day but two of the month, with a sudden change of wind and a new moon  there came a change of weather. The sun poured its beaming rays to the  very bottom of the crater.    Each hillock, every rock, every stone, every asperity of the soil had  its share of the luminous effulgence, and its shadow fell heavily on the  soil. Among others, to his insane delight, the shadow of Scartaris was  marked and clear, and moved slowly with the radiant start of day.    My uncle moved with it in a state of mental ecstasy.    At twelve o'clock exactly, when the sun had attained its highest  altitude for the day, the shadow fell upon the edge of the central pit!    \"Here it is,\" gasped the Professor in an agony of joy, \"here it is--we  have found it. Forward, my friends, into the Interior of the Earth.\"    I looked curiously at Hans to see what reply he would make to this  terrific announcement.    \"Forut,\" said the guide tranquilly.    \"Forward it is,\" answered my uncle, who was now in the seventh heaven of  delight.    When we were quite ready, our watches indicated thirteen minutes past  one!          CHAPTER 14    THE REAL JOURNEY COMMENCES      Our real journey had now commenced. Hitherto our courage and  determination had overcome all difficulties. We were fatigued at times;  and that was all. Now we were about to encounter unknown and fearful  dangers.    I had not as yet ventured to take a glimpse down the horrible abyss into  which in a few minutes more I was about to plunge. The fatal moment had,  however, at last arrived. I had still the option of refusing or  accepting a share in this foolish and audacious enterprise. But I was  ashamed to show more fear than the eider-duck hunter. Hans seemed to  accept the difficulties of the journey so tranquilly, with such calm  indifference, with such perfect recklessness of all danger, that I  actually blushed to appear less of a man than he!    Had I been alone with my uncle, I should certainly have sat down and  argued the point fully; but in the presence of the guide I held my  tongue. I gave one moment to the thought of my charming cousin, and then  I advanced to the mouth of the central shaft.    It measured about a hundred feet in diameter, which made about three  hundred in circumference. I leaned over a rock which stood on its edge,  and looked down. My hair stood on end, my teeth chattered, my limbs  trembled. I seemed utterly to lose my centre of gravity, while my head  was in a sort of whirl, like that of a drunken man. There is nothing  more powerful than this attraction towards an abyss. I was about to fall  headlong into the gaping well, when I was drawn back by a firm and  powerful hand. It was that of Hans. I had not taken lessons enough at  the Frelser's-Kirk of Copenhagen in the art of looking down from lofty  eminences without blinking!    However, few as the minutes were during which I gazed down this  tremendous and even wondrous shaft, I had a sufficient glimpse of it to  give me some idea of its physical conformation. Its sides, which were  almost as perpendicular as those of a well, presented numerous  projections which doubtless would assist our descent.    It was a sort of wild and savage staircase, without bannister or fence.  A rope fastened above, near the surface, would certainly support our  weight and enable us to reach the bottom, but how, when we had arrived  at its utmost depth, were we to loosen it above? This was, I thought, a  question of some importance.    My uncle, however, was one of those men who are nearly always prepared  with expedients. He hit upon a very simple method of obviating this  difficulty. He unrolled a cord about as thick as my thumb, and at least  four hundred feet in length. He allowed about half of it to go down the  pit and catch in a hitch over a great block of lava which stood on the  edge of the precipice. This done, he threw the second half after the  first.    Each of us could now descend by catching the two cords in one hand. When  about two hundred feet below, all the explorer had to do was to let go  one end and pull away at the other, when the cord would come falling at  his feet. In order to go down farther, all that was necessary was to  continue the same operation.    This was a very excellent proposition, and no doubt, a correct one.  Going down appeared to me easy enough; it was the coming up again that  now occupied my thoughts.    \"Now,\" said my uncle, as soon as he"]]]
