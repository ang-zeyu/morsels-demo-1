It may be that a town of the Northerners existed here before the time of  the Southern Conquest, for Phtah, the local god of Memphis, has a very  marked character of his own, quite different from that of Khen-tamenti,  the Osiris of Abydos. He is always represented as a little bow-legged  hydrocephalous dwarf very like the Phoenician _Kabeiroi_. It may be  that here is another connection between the Northern Egyptians and the  Semites. The name \"Phtah,\" the \"Opener,\" is definitely Semitic. We may  then regard the dwarf Phtah as originally a non-Egyptian god of the  Northerners, probably Semitic in origin, and his town also as antedating  the conquest. But it evidently was to the Southerners that Memphis owed  its importance and its eventual promotion to the position of capital of  the united kingdom. Then the dwarf Phtah saw himself rivalled by another  Phtah of Southern Egyptian origin, who had been installed at Memphis by  the Southerners. This Phtah was a sort of modified edition of Osiris, in  mummy-form and holding crook and whip, but with a refined edition of  the Kabeiric head of the indigenous Phtah. The actual god of \"the White  Wall\" was undoubtedly confused vith the dead god of the necropolis,  whose name was Seker or Sekri (Sokari), \"the Coffined.\" The original  form of this deity was a mummied hawk upon a coffin, and it is very  probable that he was imported from the South, like the second Phtah, at  the time of the conquest, when the great Northern necropolis began  to grow up as a duplicate of that at Abydos. Later on we find Seker  confused with the ancient dwarf-god, and it is the latter who was  afterwards chiefly revered as Phtah-Socharis-Osiris, the protector of  the necropolis, the mummied Phtah being the generally recognized ruler  of the City of the White Wall.    It is from the name of Seker that the modern Sak-kara takes its title.  Sakkara marks the central point of the great Memphite necropolis, as it  is the nearest point of the western desert to Memphis. Northwards the  necropolis extended to Griza and Abu Roash, southwards, to Daslmr;  even the necropoles of Lisht and Medum may be regarded as appanages of  Sakkara. At Sakkara itself Tjeser of the IIId Dynasty had a pyramid,  which, as we have seen, was probably not his real tomb (which was  the great mastaba at Bet Khallaf), but a secondary or sham tomb  corresponding to the \"tombs\" of the earliest kings at Umm el-Ga'ab in  the necropolis of Abydos. Many later kings, however, especially of the  Vith Dynasty, were actually buried at Sakkara. Their tombs have all been  thoroughly described by their discoverer, Prof. Maspero, in his history.  The last king of the Hid Dynasty, Snefru, was buried away down south at  Medum, in splendid isolation, but he may also have had a second pyramid  at Sakkara or Abu Roash.    The kings of the IVth Dynasty were the greatest of the pyramid builders,  and to them belong the huge edifices of Griza. The Vth Dynasty favoured  Abusir, between Ciza and Sakkara; the Vith, as we have said, preferred  Sakkara itself. With them the end of the Old Kingdom and of Memphite  dominion was reached; the sceptre fell from the hands of the Memphite  kings and was taken up by the princes of Herakleopolis (Ahnasyet  el-Medina, near Beni Suef, south of the Eayyum) and Thebes. Where the  Herakleopolite kings were buried we do not know; probably somewhere in  the local necropolis of the Gebel es-Sedment, between Ahnasya and the  Fayyum. The first Thebans (the XIth Dynasty) were certainly buried at  Thebes, but when the Herakleopolites had finally disappeared, and all  Egypt was again united under one strong sceptre, the Theban kings seem  to have been drawn northwards. They removed to the seat of the dominion  of those whom they had supplanted, and they settled in the neighbourhood  of Herakleopolis, near the fertile province of the Fayyum, and between  it and Memphis. Here, in the royal fortress-palace of Itht-taui,  \"Controlling the Two Lands,\" the kings of the XIIth Dynasty lived,  and they were buried in the necropoles of Dashur, Lisht, and Illahun  (Hawara), in pyramids like those of the old Memphite kings. These facts,  of the situation of Itht-taui, of their burial in the southern an ex of  the old necropolis of Memphis, and of the fori of their tombs (the  true Upper Egyptian and Thebian form was a rock-cut gallery and chamber  driven deep into the hill), show how solicitous were the Amenemhats  and Senusrets of the suffrages of Lower Egypt, how anxious they were to  conciliate the ancient royal pride of Memphis.    Where the kings of the XIIIth Dynasty and the Hyksos or \"Shepherds\" were  buried, we do not know. The kings of the restored Theban empire were  all interred at Thebes. There are, in fact, no known royal sepulchres  between the Fayyum and Abydos. The great kings were mostly buried in  the neighbourhood of Memphis, Abydos, and Thebes. The sepulchres of the  \"Middle Empire\"--the XIth to XIIIth Dynasties--in the neighbourhood  of the Fayyum may fairly be grouped with those of the same period at  Dashur, which belongs to the necropolis of Memphis, since it is only a  mile or two south of Sakkara.    It is chiefly with regard to the sepulchres of the kings that the most  momentous discoveries of recent years have been made at Thebes, and at  Sakkara, Abusir, Dashur, and Lisht, as at Abydos. For this reason we  deal in succession with the finds in the necropoles of Abydos, Memphis,  and Thebes respectively. And with the sepulchres of the \"Old Kingdom,\"  in the Memphite necropolis proper, we have naturally grouped those of  the \"Middle Kingdom\" at Dashur, Lisht, Illahun, and Hawara.    Some of these modern discoveries have been commented on and illustrated  by Prof. Maspero in his great history. But the discoveries that have  been made since this publication have been very important,--those at  Abusir, indeed, of first-rate importance, though not so momentous as  those of the tombs of the Ist and IId Dynasties at Abydos, already  described. At Abu Roash and at Giza, at the northern end of the Memphite  necropolis, several expeditions have had considerable success, notably  those of the American Dr. Reisner, assisted by Mr. Mace, who excavated  the royal tombs at Umm el-Ga'ab for Prof. Petrie, those of the  German Drs. Steindorff and Borchardt,--the latter working for the  _Beutsch-Orient Gesellschaft_,--and those of other American excavators.  Until the full publication of the results of these excavations appears,  very little can be said about them. Many mastaba-tombs have, it is  understood, been found, with interesting remains. Nothing of great  historical importance seems to have been discovered, however. It is  otherwise when we come to the discoveries of Messrs. Borchardt and  Schafer at Abusir, south of Giza and north of Sakkara. At this place  results of first-rate historical importance have been attained.    The main group of pyramids at Abusir consists of the tombs of the kings  Sahura, Neferarikara, and Ne-user-Ra, of the Vth Dynasty. The pyramids  themselves are smaller than those of Giza, but larger than those of  Sakkara. In general appearance and effect they resemble those of Giza,  but they are not so imposing, as the desert here is low. Those of Giza,  Sakkara, and Dashur owe much of their impressiveness to the fact that  they are placed at some height above the cultivated land. The excavation  and planning of these pyramids were carried out by Messrs. Borchardt and  Schafer at the expense of Baron von Bissing, the well-known Egyptologist  of Munich, and of the _Deutsch-Orient Gesell-schaft_ of Berlin. The  antiquities found have been divided between the museums of Berlin and  Cairo.    One of the most noteworthy discoveries was that of the funerary temple  of Ne-user-Ra, which stood at the base of his pyramid. The plan is  interesting, and the granite lotus-bud columns found are the most  ancient yet discovered in Egypt. Much of the paving and the wainscoting  of the walls was of fine black marble, beautifully polished. An  interesting find was a basin and drain with lion's-head mouth, to  carry away the blood of the sacrifices. Some sculptures in relief were  discovered, including a gigantic representation of the king and the  goddess Isis, which shows that in the early days of the Vth Dynasty the  king and the gods were already depicted in exactly the same costume as  they wore in the days of the Ramses and the Ptolemies. The hieratic art  of Egypt had, in fact, now taken on itself the final outward appearance  which it retained to the very end. There is no more of the archaism  and absence of conventionality, which marks the art of the earliest  dynasties.    We can trace by successive steps the swift development of Egyptian art  from the rude archaism of the Ist Dynasty to its final consummation  under the Vth, when the conventions became fixed. In the time of  Khaesekhemui, at the beginning of the IId Dynasty, the archaic character  of the art has already begun to wear off. Under the same dynasty we  still have styles of unconventional naivete, such as the famous Statue  \"No. 1\" of the Cairo Museum, bearing the names of Kings Hetepahaui,  Neb-ra, and Neneter. But with the IVth Dynasty we no longer look for  unconventionality. Prof. Petrie discovered at Abydos a small ivory  statuette of Khufu or Cheops, the builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza.  The portrait is a good one and carefully executed. It was not till  the time of the XVIIIth Dynasty, indeed, that the Egyptians ceased  to portray their kings as they really were, and gave them a purely  conventional type of face. This convention, against which the heretical  King Amenhetep IV (Akhunaten) rebelled, in order to have himself  portrayed in all his real ungainliness and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17322"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 2 (of 12) (#15)"],[1,"one of his great nobles, could leave his work and his village when  he pleased, could pass from the domain in which he was born into a  different one, and could traverse the country from one end to the other,  as the Egyptians of to-day still do.    His absence entailed neither loss of goods, nor persecution of the  relatives he left behind, and he himself had punishment to fear only  when he left the Nile Valley without permission, to reside for some time  in a foreign land.* But although this independence and liberty were in  accordance with the laws and customs of the land, yet they gave rise to  inconveniences from which it was difficult to escape in practical life.  Every Egyptian, the King excepted, was obliged, in order to get on in  life, to depend on one more powerful than himself, whom he called his  master. The feudal lord was proud to recognize Pharaoh as his master,  and he himself was master of the soldiers and priests in his own petty  state.         * The treaty between Ramses and the Prince of Khiti contains       a formal extradition clause in reference to Egyptians or       Hittites, who had quitted their native country, of course       without the permission of their sovereign. The two       contracting parties expressly stipulate that persons       extradited on one side or the other shall not be punished       for having emigrated, that their property is not to be       confiscated, nor are their families to be held responsible       for their flight. From this clause it follows that in       ordinary times unauthorized emigration brought upon the       culprit corporal punishment and the confiscation of his       goods, as well as various penalties on his family. The way       in which Sinuhit makes excuses for his flight, the fact of       his asking pardon before returning to Egypt, the very terms       of the letter in which the king recalls him and assures him       of impunity, show us that the laws against emigration were       in full force under the XIIth dynasty.         ** The expressions which bear witness to this fact are very       numerous: Miri nibuf = \"He who loves his master;\" Aqu haiti       ni nibuf = \"He who enters into the heart of his master,\" etc.       They recur so frequently in the texts in the case of persons       of all ranks, that it was thought no importance ought to be       attached to them. But the constant repetition of the word       NIB, \"master,\" shows that we must alter this view, and give       these phrases their full meaning.    From the top to the bottom of the social scale every free man  acknowledged a master, who secured to him justice and protection in  exchange for his obedience and fealty. The moment an Egyptian tried to  withdraw himself from this subjection, the peace of his life was at  an end; he became a man without a master, and therefore without a  recognized protector.*         * The expression, \"a man without a master,\" occurs several       times in the _Berlin Papyrus_, No. ii. For instance, the       peasant who is the hero of the story, says of the lord       Miruitensi, that he is \"the rudder of heaven, the guide of       the earth, the balance which carries the offerings, the       buttress of tottering walls, the support of that which       falls, _the great master who takes whoever is without a       master_ to lavish on him the goods of his house, a jug of       beer and three loaves\" each day.    Any one might stop him on the way, steal his cattle, merchandise, or  property on the most trivial pretext, and if he attempted to protest,  might beat him with almost certain impunity.    [Illustration: 095.jpg WAR-DANCE PERFORMED BY EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS BEFORE A  BATTLE]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the tomb of Khiti at Beni-       Hasan. These are soldiers of the nome of Gazelle.    The only resource of the victim was to sit at the gate of the palace,  waiting to appeal for justice till the lord or the king should appear.  If by chance, after many rebuffs, his humble petition were granted, it  was only the beginning of fresh troubles. Even if the justice of the  cause were indisputable, the fact that he was a man without home or  master inspired his judges with an obstinate mistrust, and delayed the  satisfaction of his claims. In vain he followed his judges with his  complaints and flatteries, chanting their virtues in every key: \"Thou  art the father of the unfortunate, the husband of the widow, the brother  of the orphan, the clothing of the motherless: enable me to proclaim  thy name as a law throughout the land. Good lord, guide without caprice,  great without littleness, thou who destroyest falsehood and causest  truth to be, come at the words of my mouth; I speak, listen and do  justice. O generous one, generous of the generous, destroy the cause of  my trouble; here I am, uplift me; judge me, for behold me a suppliant  before thee.\" If he were an eloquent speaker and the judge were inclined  to listen, he was willingly heard, but his cause made no progress, and  delays, counted on by his adversary, effected his ruin. The religious  law, no doubt, prescribed equitable treatment for all devotees of  Osiris, and condemned the slightest departure from justice as one of the  gravest sins, even in the case of a great noble, or in that of the  king himself; but how could impartiality be shown when the one was the  recognized protector, the \"master\" of the culprit, while the plaintiff  was a vagabond, attached to no one, \"a man without a master\"!    The population of the towns included many privileged persons other than  the soldiers, priests, or those engaged in the service of the  temples. Those employed in royal or feudal administration, from the  \"superintendent of the storehouse\" to the humblest scribe, though  perhaps not entirely exempt from forced labour, had but a small part  of it to bear.* These _employes_ constituted a middle class of several  grades, and enjoyed a fixed income and regular employment: they were  fairly well educated, very self-satisfied, and always ready to declare  loudly their superiority over any who were obliged to gain their  living by manual labour. Each class of workmen recognized one or more  chiefs,--the shoemakers, their master-shoemakers, the masons, their  master-masons, the blacksmiths, their master-blacksmiths,--who  looked after their interests and represented them before the local  authorities.**         * This is a fair inference from the indirect testimony of       the Letters: the writer, in enumerating the liabilities of       the various professions, implies by contrast that the scribe       (i.e. the _employe_ in general) is not subject to them, or       is subject to a less onerous share of them than others. The       beginning and end of the instructions of Khiti would in       themselves be sufficient to show us the advantages which the       middle classes under the XIIth dynasty believed they could       derive from adopting the profession of scribe.         ** The stelae of Abydos are very useful to those who desire       to study the populations of a small town. They give us the       names of the head-men of trades of all kinds; the head-mason       Didiu, the master-mason Aa, the master-shoemaker Kahikhonti,       the head-smiths Usirtasen-Uati, Hotpu, Hot-purekhsu.    It was said among the Greeks, that even robbers were united in a  corporation like the others, and maintained an accredited superior as  their representative with the police, to discuss the somewhat delicate  questions which the practice of their trade gave occasion to. When the  members of the association had stolen any object of value, it was  to this superior that the person robbed resorted, in order to regain  possession of it: it was he who fixed the amount required for its  redemption, and returned it without fail, upon the payment of this sum.  Most of the workmen who formed a state corporation, lodged, or at least  all of them had their stalls, in the same quarter or street, under the  direction of their chief. Besides the poll and the house tax, they were  subject to a special toll, a trade licence which they paid in products  of their commerce or industry.*         * The registers (for the most part unpublished), which are       contained in European museums show us that fishermen paid in       fish, gardeners in flowers and vegetables, etc., the taxes       or tribute which they owed to their lords. In the great       inscription of Abydos the weavers attached to the temple of       Seti I. are stated to have paid their tribute in stuffs.

Their lot was a hard one, if we are to believe the description which  ancient writers have handed down to us: \"I have never seen a blacksmith  on an embassy--nor a smelter sent on a mission--but what I have seen  is the metal worker at his toil,--at the mouth of the furnace of his  forge,--his fingers as rugged as the crocodile,--and stinking more than  fish-spawn.--The artisan of any kind who handles the chisel,--does not  employ so much movement as he who handles the hoe;*         * The literal translation would be, \"The artisan of all       kinds who handles the chisel is more motionless than he who       handles the hoe.\" Both here, and in several other passages       of this little satiric poem, I have been obliged to       paraphrase the text in order to render it intelligible to       the modern reader.
