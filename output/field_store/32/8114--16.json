The Foursome League had not  yet earned distinction, chiefly owing to lapses on the part of Fil, and  Nora's incorrigible love of talking in season and out of season. One  week, however, after a really heroic series of efforts, they succeeded  in establishing a record, and sat perking themselves at dinner-time when  Mrs. Best read out the score.    \"We've not had you on the boards before,\" said Susie Wakefield, one of  the Sixth, as the girls filed from the room when the meal was over;  \"we're all expecting something extra tiptop and thrillsome, so play up!\"    \"Hope we shan't let you down!\" replied Ingred. \"Please don't expect too  much, or you mayn't get it!\"    Dormitory 2 held a hurried conclave before afternoon school.    \"It's a great stunt!\" rejoiced Nora.    \"What _are_ we to act?\" fluttered Fil.    \"Especially when we've to play up!\" twittered Verity.    \"What silly idiots we were not to plan it all out beforehand! But I  really never dreamt we'd ever get the chance!\"    \"No more did I,\" said Ingred, sitting with her head in her hands,  considering. \"On the whole, it doesn't matter. Sometimes a quite  impromptu thing goes off best. It's largely a question of what costumes  we can rake up out of nothing.    \"The cleverer those are, the more we'll get applauded. I've one or two  ideas simmering. Thank goodness it's drawing this afternoon, and I shall  have time to think them over.\"    \"We'll all think!\" agreed Verity. \"Then we'll compare notes at four  o'clock, and fix on what we're going to do. Great Minerva! It'll be a  hectic evening! I'm shivering in my shoes!\"    \"And I'm absolutely green with stage-fright! What a life!\" proclaimed  Fil.    If Miss Godwin, the drawing-mistress, noticed a slacking off in accuracy  on the part of four of her pupils, that afternoon, she perhaps set it  down to want of artistic feeling. It is difficult to copy with absolute  exactness when only your fingers are busy, and your brain is far away.  Ingred planned enough entertainments to supply a Pierrot troupe for a  month, but abandoned most of them as being quite impossible to act with  the very limited resources that were available at the hostel. At a  select Foursome Committee after school, however, she presented the pick  of the performances, and as nobody else had thought of anything better,  or indeed quite so good, her suggestions, with a few amendments and  alterations, were carried unanimously.    At eight o'clock that evening, when preparation was finished, the  boarders' room was rapidly transformed into an amateur theater. The  trestle tables were carried to one end to form the gallery, rows of  chairs represented the dress circle, and cushions in front either the  pit or the stalls, according to individual taste, or, as Mrs. Best said,  the behavior of the occupants.    There was no curtain, but, as the scenery preserved Shakespearian  methods of simplicity, that did not matter. Part of the charm of these  Thursday night entertainments was their absolutely spontaneous  character, and the fact that many details had to be left to the  imagination of the spectators only made things more amusing.    When the audience, after a slight struggle for gallery seats, had  settled itself, and Mrs. Best and Nurse Warner had taken possession of  the arm-chairs specially reserved for them, Dollie Ransome, who had been  requisitioned by the performers to act as Greek chorus, placed some  stools by the fire-place, and announced importantly:    \"King Alfred and the Cakes. A Historical Drama.\"    The little old woman who entered, carrying some sticks and a basin, was  difficult to identify as Fil. Her fair hair had been powdered, wrinkles  were painted on her smooth forehead, a handkerchief was knotted on her  head for a cap, and she wore an apron borrowed from the cook, and a  check table-cover arranged as a shawl. She bestowed the sticks in the  fender to represent a fire on the hearth, and taking some biscuits from  her basin, placed them amongst the supposed embers, indulging meanwhile  in a soliloquy about the hardness of the times for poor folk, and the  danger from the Danes.    A violent knocking on the door was followed by the entrance of such a  magnificent object that the spectators immediately applauded his advent.  Nora, with her large build, short-cut hair, and generally boyish  appearance, was the very one to act King Alfred. She had folded a plaid  traveling rug into a kilt which reached just to her bare knees, borrowed  a velvet coatee and a leather belt from Mrs. Best, and, by the aid of  bandages from the ambulance cupboard, had made quite a good imitation of  Saxon leg-gear. Armed with a bow and arrows, hastily constructed from  twigs cut in the garden, she advanced with a manly stride, begged for  hospitality, and was accommodated with a stool by the hearth, where she  sat whittling arrows in an abstracted fashion, and heaving gusty sighs.    The audience had hardly recovered from its astonishment when it was  thrilled again by the entrance of an ancient and elderly peasant man, so  disguised that it was almost impossible to recognize Ingred. A  water-proof with a broad leather belt served as coat, and, being padded  inside with a pillow, gave the effect of bent and bowed shoulders. Some  tow, supplied by Mrs. Best, was fastened as a long straggling beard, and  bushy eyebrows of the same material were fixed on with soap. Leaning  heavily upon a stick, he came limping in, complaining in a tremulous  voice of his rheumatism, started with amazement at the sight of the  handsome stranger seated by his hearth, and drew his wife aside for  explanations. The old couple, after conversing in audible whispers,  decided to go out for more firewood, and as a last charge the dame  commended her cakes to the care of their guest. King Alfred, on being  left alone by the hearth, whittled away at his arrows with more energy  than discrimination, and showed indeed a sad lack of practical skill for  so well seasoned a warrior. Perhaps, however, he was not accustomed to  have to make them for himself, and missed his chief archer. Throwing  them down at last, he sank his head in his hands in an absolute cinema  pose of despondency, and sighed to an extent which must have been  painful to his lungs. The dame returned to sniff burning cakes and fly  to the rescue of her cookery. Fil was quite a good little actress, and  produced what she considered her _piece de resistance_. She had spent  her summer holidays in Somerset, and had there picked up a local ballad  which dealt with the legend in dialect. She brought out a verse of it  now with great effect:        \"Cusn't ee zee the ca-akes, man?        And cusn't ee zee 'em burrn?      I'se warrant ee eat 'em fast enough,        Zoon as it be ee turn!\"    And catching up a biscuit, carefully blackened beforehand by toasting it  over the gas, she flaunted it in the face of the embarrassed monarch.    The dramatic situation was slightly spoilt by the delay in the entrance  of the courtier, who ought to have come in at that psychological moment,  and didn't. The fact was that Verity, finding it dull waiting in the  passage, had run upstairs to make some additions to her costume, and had  miscalculated the length, or rather shortness, of the act. It is  difficult for the most accomplished actor to go on looking embarrassed  for any length of time, and as Fil's eloquence in the scolding line  suddenly failed her, there was an awful pause while the peasant husband,  with wonderful agility considering his rheumatism, hopped to the door  and called agitatedly for the missing performer. The courtier flew  downstairs like a whirlwind, tripped into the room, and fell upon his  red-stockinged knees to do homage to his sovereign, who rose  majestically and extended a hand of pardon to the now grovelling  peasant.    The audience, particularly that portion seated in the gallery, clapped  and cheered to such an extent that one of the trestles, which had been  carelessly fixed, collapsed, and sent a whole row of girls sliding on to  the floor, whence they were rescued speechless with laughter, but  uninjured. They came crowding round the performers to admire the  costumes.    \"They're topping!\"    \"How _did_ you think of them?\"    \"I like King Alfred's legs!\"    \"Ingred, you look about a hundred!\"    \"Fil _could_ scold!\"    \"Verity, what was a courtier doing rambling about a forest in a blue  dressing-gown? It would get torn on the bushes!\"    \"I know. We told her so, but she _would_ wear it!\" declared Ingred. \"She  was just pig-headed over that dressing-gown!\"    \"Well, go and look at the Saxon pictures for yourself, in the history  book!\" retorted Verity, sticking to her point. \"You'll see the courtiers  in long flowing garments very like dressing-gowns. I think it was a  capital idea, and the best I could do. There wasn't another rug for the  kilt anyhow, and when other people have taken the best parts and the  nicest costumes, you've just got to put up with anything you can find  that's left.\"    \"You did it so well,\" Ingred assured her hastily, for Verity had gone  very pink, and her voice sounded distinctly offended. \"I thought the way  you dropped on one knee and cried: 'My liege lord! I am your humble  socman!' was most impressive. What made you think of 'socman'?\"    \"Got it out of the history book,\" said Verity, slightly mollified. \"It  means a man who owned land, but wasn't quite as high up as a thane. I  meant to bring in some more Saxon words, but I hadn't time.\"    \"You must win the dormitory score again, and give us another  performance,\" urged Mrs. Best. \"I'm afraid it's too late for any more  to-night, though we're all sorry to stop. Those juniors ought to be in  bed."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18525"],[0,"On the Trail: An Outdoor Book for Girls (#15)"],[1,"ndbreak, and in other ways after  reaching camp.      =What to Put in Your Pack=    Open out your pack-cloth flat on the floor, and place your folded  mattress-bag in the centre.    Fill the pillow-bag with your first-aid case and case of toilet  articles, and if there is space for other things pack them in. Lay the  pillow-bag on top of the mattress-bag, place clothing by the side and on  top of the pillow-bag, being careful to keep the contents of your pack  rectangular in shape and of size to fit well over your back.    [Illustration: 32    CAMP PACK    BLANKET PACK    33    PACK-HARNESS    MEAT SAFE    Some things to carry and how to carry them.]    If not adding too much to the weight, include many things from your  personal-belonging list; of these articles you can carry some in the  pockets of your camp suit. Everything being in the pack, fold over the  sides and ends, making a neat, compact bundle; tie it securely with a  piece of soft rope and across its top place the blankets with poncho  inside, which you have previously made into a roll to fit. Bind pack and  blankets together, attach the pack shoulder-strap and swing the pack on  your back.    Pack straps or harness can be obtained at any camp-outfitter's.    A different style of pack may be a bag with square corners, all seams  strongly stitched, then bound with strong tape. Cut two pieces of the  water-proof cloth, one about sixteen inches wide, and the other eighteen  inches; this last is for the front and allows more space. Let each piece  be twenty-one inches long or longer, unite them with a strip of the  cloth six inches wide and sufficiently long to allow of flaps extending  free at the top to fold over from both sides across the opening; you  will then have a box-like bag. Make one large flap of width to fit the  top of the back, and length to cross over on front, covering the smaller  flaps and fastening down on the outside of the front of the pack. All  three flaps may have pockets to hold small articles.    The shoulder-straps may be either of strong government webbing which  comes for the purpose, tube lamp-wick, or leather.    With this pack the blanket and poncho could be made into a thin roll and  fitted around the edges of the pack, or made into a short roll and  attached to top of pack.    When feasible it is a good plan to pack your smaller belongings in  wall-pockets with divisions protected by flaps securely fastened over  the open ends, the wall-pockets rolled, tied, and carried in the camp  pack. These pockets are useful at camp; they help to keep your things  where you can find them. Next best is to use small separate labelled  bags for different variety of duffel, and pack them in one or two duffel  tube-shaped bags, which may be bound together, constituting one pack.    From eighteen to twenty-four pounds is average weight for a girl to  carry; it all depends upon strength and endurance; some girls can carry  even heavier packs, while others must have lighter ones. Beware about  loading yourself down too heavily. Packs grow heavier and heavier, never  lighter on the trail.      =Blanket-Roll Pack=    Side-trips from camp for only one night's bivouac will not need a back  pack; the few articles required can be carried in your blanket-roll.  Spread the poncho out flat, rubber side down, then your blankets on top,  and group the things you intend to take into two separate oblong groups,  one on each side of the central space at one end of the blankets; push  the articles in each division closely together, leaving the space  between the divisions empty. Kneel in front of your blankets and begin  to roll all together tightly, taking care not to allow any of the duffel  to fall out. When the roll is complete, tie the centre with strong, soft  string, and also each end, and make a hoop of the roll by tying together  the hanging strings on the two ends. Wear the blanket-roll over left  shoulder, diagonally across back and chest to rest over right hip. If  you have forgotten a few items, tie the things to the bottom of the  blanket-roll and let them hang like tassels.      =Duffel-Bag=    Articles for general use while at camp can be packed together in one or  more duffel-bags; if but one bag is needed, provisions might go in the  same receptacle when space and weight permit. It is much better,  however, to have a separate bag for provisions.      =Packing Provisions=    You can make or buy separate tube bags of different heights, but all of  the same diameter, and pack flour in one, corn-meal in another, and so  on, having each bag labelled and all, when filled, fitted in one  duffel-bag; you will find these bags a great comfort. They should be of  water-proof canvas with draw-string at the top. You can purchase  friction-top cans for butter, etc., of varying depth to accommodate  different quantities which will fit well in the large provision bag.    A duffel-bag is usually made cylindrical in form with a disk of the  cloth sewed in tight at one end, and the other end closed with  draw-strings. It is well to have another cloth disk attached to one spot  at the top of the bag, to cover the contents before the draw-strings are  fastened.    A great variety of desirable camp packs, including duffel-bags,  pack-straps, harness, and tump-lines, may be purchased at the  camp-outfitter's; investigate before deciding upon home-made camp packs.  Pack-baskets can also be obtained, but all the good-sized pack-baskets I  have seen, while attractive in appearance, are too rigid, bulky,  sharp-edged, and heavy to be of use to girl campers.    Having decided that the wilderness is the place to locate, unless you  can manage to camp with very little in the way of extra packs, you will  be obliged to employ a guide to assist in the carry, possibly two  guides, as wilderness trails do not permit of a vehicle, or even a mule  or horse, being used to help in the portage.    Should your camp be on a more accessible site, the easy portage can be  taken advantage of and the problem readily solved; but the charm of the  real forest camp with all its possibilities for genuine life in the  wilderness more, far more, than compensates for the extra difficulties  in reaching camp. Really, though, the very difficulties are but part of  the sport; they give zest and add to the fun of the trail.          CHAPTER V    OUTDOOR HANDICRAFT    =Camp Furnishings--Dressing-Table, Seats, Dining-Table, Cupboard, Broom,  Chair, Racks, Birch-Bark Dishes, etc.=      Camp is the place where girls enjoy most proving their powers of  resourcefulness.    It is fun to supply a want with the mere natural raw materials found in  the open, and when you succeed in making a useful article of outdoor  things, the entire camp takes a pride in your work and the simple but  practical and usable production gives a hundred per cent more pleasure  than could a store article manufactured for the same purpose.    Be comfortable at camp. While it is good to live simply in the open, it  is also good to be comfortable in the open, and with experience you will  be surprised to find what a delightful life can be lived at camp with  but few belongings and the simplest of camp furnishings. These last can,  in a great measure, be made of tree branches and the various stuffs  found in the woods.    [Illustration: Handicraft in the woods.    Details of the outdoor dressing-table. Comb-racks of forked sticks and  of split sticks.]      =Dressing-Table=    A near-by tree will furnish the substantial foundation for your  dressing-table and wash-stand combined. If you can find a side-piece of  a wooden box, use it for the shelf and fasten this shelf on the trunk of  a tree about two and one-half feet or more above the ground. Cut two  rustic braces and nail the front of the shelf on the top ends of these  supports; then nail a strip of wood across the tree as a cleat on which  to rest the back of the shelf; fit the shelf on the cleat and nail the  lower ends of the braces to the tree; strengthen the work still more by  driving a strong, long nail on each side of the top centre of the back  of shelf, diagonally down through the shelf, cleat, and into the tree.    It is not essential that the straight shelf edge fit perfectly to the  rounded tree, but if you desire to have it so, mark a semicircle on the  wood of size to fit the tree and whittle it out.    Should there be no piece of box for your shelf, make the shelf of  strong, slender sticks lashed securely close together on two side  sticks. For cleats and braces use similar sticks described for board  shelf.    When the shelf is made in this way, cover the top with birch bark or  other bark to give a flat surface.    Hang your mirror on a nail in the tree at convenient distance above the  shelf, and your tooth-brush on another nail. The towel may hang over the  extending end of the cleat, and you can make a small bark dish for the  soap. Your comb can rest on two forked-stick supports tacked on the  tree, or two split-end sticks.      =Camp-Seats=    Stones, logs, stumps, raised outstanding roots of trees, and boxes, when  obtainable, must be your outdoor chairs, stools, and seats until others  can be made.    [Illustration: Outdoor dressing-table, camp-cupboard, hammock-frame,  seat, and pot-hook.]    Two trees standing near together may be used to advantage as uprights  for a camp seat. Cut a small horizontal kerf or notch at the same height  on opposite sides of both trees, get two strong poles (green wood), fit  them in the wedges and nail them to the trees; then lash them firmly in  place. Be absolutely certain that these poles are of strong wood,  firmly attached to the trees and not liable to slide or break.    Make the seat by lashing sticks across from pole to pole, placing them  close together. Two more long poles, fastened to the trees at a proper  distance above the seat, would give a straight back, if a back is  desired, but it is not"]]]
