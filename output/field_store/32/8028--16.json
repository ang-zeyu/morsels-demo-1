The  men retired to a lean-to room, where they slept, but not before Manuel  Pedro Felipe and Carlota had knelt before their altar for their  devotions. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy and myself and Jerrine, knowing the  rosary, surprised them by kneeling with them. It is good to meet with  kindred faith away off in the mountains. It seems there could not  possibly be a mistake when people so far away from creeds and doctrines  hold to the faith of their childhood and find the practice a pleasure  after so many years. The men bade us good-night, and we lost no time in  settling ourselves to rest. Luckily we had plenty of blankets.    Away in the night I was awakened by a noise that frightened me. All was  still, but instantly there flashed through my mind tales of murdered  travelers, and I was almost paralyzed with fear when again I heard that  stealthy, sliding noise, just like Carlota Juanita's old slippers. The  fire had burned down, but just then the moon came from behind a cloud  and shone through the window upon Carlota Juanita, who was asleep with  her mouth open. I could also see a pine bough which was scraping  against the wall outside, which was perhaps making the noise. I turned  over and saw the punk burning, which cast a dim light over the serene  face of the Blessed Virgin, so all fear vanished and I slept as long as  they would let me in the morning. After a breakfast of _tortillas_,  cheese, and rancid butter, and some more of the coffee, we started  again for the stocking-leg dinner. Carlota Juanita stood in the door,  waving to us as long as we could see her, and Manuel P.F. sat with Mr.  Stewart to guide us around the snow-slide. Under one arm he carried the  horn with which he had called us to him. It came from some long-horned  cow in Mexico, was beautifully polished, and had a fancy rim of silver.  I should like to own it, but I could not make it produce a sound. When  we were safe on our way our guide left us, and our spirits ran high  again. The horses were feeling good also, so it was a merry, laughing  party that drew up before Zebbie's two hours later.    Long before I had lent Gavotte a set of the Leather-Stocking Tales,  which he had read aloud to Zebbie. Together they had planned a  Leather-Stocking dinner, at which should be served as many of the  viands mentioned in the Tales as possible. We stayed two days and it  was one long feast. We had venison served in half a dozen different  ways. We had antelope; we had porcupine, or hedgehog, as Pathfinder  called it; and also we had beaver-tail, which he found toothsome, but  which I did _not_. We had grouse and sage hen. They broke the ice and  snared a lot of trout. In their cellar they had a barrel of trout  prepared exactly like mackerel, and they were more delicious than  mackerel because they were finer-grained. I had been a little  disappointed in Zebbie after his return from home. It seemed to me that  Pauline had spoiled him. I guess I was jealous. This time he was the  same little old Zebbie I had first seen. He seemed to thoroughly enjoy  our visit, and I am sure we each had the time of our lives. We made it  home without mishap the same day we started, all of us sure life held  something new and enjoyable after all.    If nothing happens there are some more good times in store for me this  summer. Gavotte once worked under Professor Marsden when he was out  here getting fossils for the Smithsonian Institution, and he is very  interesting to listen to. He has invited us to go with him out to the  Bad-Land hills in the summer to search for fossils. The hills are only  a few miles from here and I look forward to a splendid time.          XVI    THE HORSE-THIEVES           [No date.]    DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    ... I am so afraid that you will get an overdose of culture from your  visit to the Hub and am sending you an antidote of our sage, sand, and  sunshine.    Mrs. Louderer had come over to see our boy. Together we had prepared  supper and were waiting for Clyde, who had gone to the post-office.  Soon he came, and after the usual friendly wrangling between him and  Mrs. Louderer we had supper. Then they began their inevitable game of  cribbage, while I sat near the fire with Baby on my lap. Clyde was  telling us of a raid on a ranch about seventy-five miles away, in which  the thieves had driven off thirty head of fine horses. There were only  two of the thieves, and the sheriff with a large posse was pursuing  them and forcing every man they came across into the chase, and a  regular man-hunt was on. It was interesting only because one of the  thieves was a noted outlaw then out on parole and known to be  desperate. We were in no way alarmed; the trouble was all in the next  county, and somehow that always seems so far away. We knew if the men  ever came together there would be a pitched battle, with bloodshed and  death, but there seemed little chance that the sheriff would ever  overtake the men.    I remember I was feeling sorry for the poor fellows with a price on  their heads,--the little pink man on my lap had softened my heart  wonderfully. Jerrine was enjoying the pictures in a paper illustrating  early days on the range, wild scenes of roping and branding. I had  remarked that I didn't believe there were any more such times, when Mrs  Louderer replied, \"Dot yust shows how much it iss you do not know. You  shall come to mine house and when away you come it shall be wiser as  when you left.\" I had kept at home very closely all summer, and a  little trip seemed the most desirable thing I could think of,  particularly as the baby would be in no way endangered. But long ago I  learned that the quickest way to get what I want is not to want it,  outwardly, at least. So I assumed an indifference that was not very  real. The result was that next morning every one was in a hurry to get  me started,--Clyde greasing the little old wagon that looks like a twin  to Cora Belle's, and Mrs. Louderer, who thinks no baby can be properly  brought up without goose-grease, busy greasing the baby \"so as he shall  not some cold take yet.\" Mrs. Louderer had ridden over, so her saddle  was laid in the wagon and her pony, Bismarck, was hitched in with Chub,  the laziest horse in all Wyoming. I knew Clyde could manage very well  while I should be gone, and there wasn't a worry to interfere with the  pleasure of my outing.    We jogged along right merrily, Mrs. Louderer devoting her entire  attention to trying to make Chub pull even with Bismarck, Jerrine and  myself enjoying the ever-changing views. I wish I could lay it all  before you. Summer was departing with reluctant feet, unafraid of  Winter's messengers, the chill winds. That day was especially  beautiful. The gleaming snow peaks and heavy forest south and at our  back; west, north, and east, long, broken lines of the distant  mountains with their blue haze. Pilot Butte to the north, one hundred  miles away, stood out clear and distinct as though we could drive there  in an hour or two. The dull, neutral-colored \"Bad Land\" hills nearer us  are interesting only because we know they are full of the fossil  remains of strange creatures long since extinct.    For a distance our way lay up Henry's Fork valley; prosperous little  ranches dotted the view, ripening grain rustled pleasantly in the warm  morning sunshine, and closely cut alfalfa fields made bright spots of  emerald against the dun landscape. The quaking aspens were just  beginning to turn yellow; everywhere purple asters were a blaze of  glory except where the rabbit-bush grew in clumps, waving its feathery  plumes of gold. Over it all the sky was so deeply blue, with little,  airy, white clouds drifting lazily along. Every breeze brought scents  of cedar, pine, and sage. At this point the road wound along the base  of cedar hills; some magpies were holding a noisy caucus among the  trees, a pair of bluebirds twittered excitedly upon a fence, and high  overhead a great black eagle soared. All was so peaceful that  horse-thieves and desperate men seemed too remote to think about.    Presently we crossed the creek and headed our course due north toward  the desert and the buttes. I saw that we were not going right to reach  Mrs. Louderer's ranch, so I asked where we were supposed to be going.  \"We iss going to the mouth of Dry Creek by, where it goes Black's Fork  into. Dere mine punchers holdts five huntert steers. We shall de camp  visit and you shall come back wiser as when you went.\"    Well, we both came away wiser. I had thought we were going only to the  Louderer ranch, so I put up no lunch, and there was nothing for the  horses either. But it was too beautiful a time to let such things annoy  us. Anyway, we expected to reach camp just after noon, so a little  delay about dinner didn't seem so bad. We had entered the desert by  noon; the warm, red sands fell away from the wheels with soft, hissing  sounds. Occasionally a little horned toad sped panting along before us,  suddenly darting aside to watch with bright, cunning eyes as we passed.  Some one had placed a buffalo's skull beside a big bunch of sage and on  the sage a splendid pair of elk's antlers. We saw many such scattered  over the sands, grim reminders of a past forever gone.    About three o'clock we reached our destination, but no camp was there.  We were more disappointed than I can tell you, but Mrs. Louderer merely  went down to the river, a few yards away, and cut an armful of willow  sticks wherewith to coax Chub to a little brisker pace, and then we  took the trail of the departed mess-wagon. Shortly, we topped a low  range of hills, and beyond, in a cuplike valley, was the herd of sleek  beauties feeding contentedly on the lush green grass. I suppose it  sounds odd to hear desert and river in the same breath, but within a  few feet of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16643"],[0,"Essays (#15)"],[1,"exist, and afterwards see them as appearances in  nature, and forget that we have shared their cause. Here is the  fountain of action and of thought. Here are the lungs of that  inspiration which giveth man wisdom, and which cannot be denied  without impiety and atheism. We lie in the lap of immense  intelligence, which makes us receivers of its truth and organs of its  activity. When we discern justice, when we discern truth, we do  nothing of ourselves, but allow a passage to its beams. If we ask  whence this comes, if we seek to pry into the soul that causes, all  philosophy is at fault. Its presence or its absence is all we can  affirm. Every man discriminates between the voluntary acts of his  mind, and his involuntary perceptions, and knows that to his  involuntary perceptions a perfect faith is due. He may err in the  expression of them, but he knows that these things are so, like day  and night, not to be disputed. My willful actions and acquisitions are  but roving;--the idlest reverie, the faintest native emotion, command  my curiosity and respect. Thoughtless people contradict as readily the  statement of perceptions as of opinions, or rather much more readily;  for, they do not distinguish between perception and notion. They fancy  that I choose to see this or that thing. But perception is not  whimsical, it is fatal. If I see a trait, my children will see it  after me, and in course of time, all mankind,--although it may chance  that no one has seen it before me. For my perception of it is as much  a fact as the sun.    The relations of the soul to the divine spirit are so pure, that it is  profane to seek to interpose helps. It must be that when God speaketh  he should communicate, not one thing, but all things; should fill the  world with his voice; should scatter forth light, nature, time, souls,  from the center of the present thought; and new date and new create  the whole. Whenever a mind is simple, and receives a divine wisdom,  old things pass away,--means, teachers, texts, temples, fall; it lives  now, and absorbs past and future into the present hour. All things are  made sacred by relation to it,--one as much as another. All things  are dissolved to their center by their cause, and, in the universal  miracle, petty and particular miracles disappear. If, therefore, a man  claims to know and speak of God, and carries you backward to the  phraseology of some old moldered nation in another country, in another  world, believe him not. Is the acorn better than the oak which is its  fullness and completion? Is the parent better than the child into whom  he has cast his ripened being?[212] Whence, then, this worship of the  past?[213] The centuries are conspirators against the sanity and  authority of the soul. Time and space are but physiological colors  which the eye makes, but the soul is light; where it is, is day; where  it was, is night; and history is an impertinence and an injury, if it  be anything more than a cheerful apologue or parable of my being and  becoming.    Man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say  \"I think,\" \"I am,\" but quotes some saint or sage. He is ashamed before  the blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my window  make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what  they are; they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There  is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence.  Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown  flower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no less. Its  nature is satisfied, and it satisfies nature, in all moments alike.  But man postpones, or remembers; he does not live in the present, but  with a reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that  surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be  happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above  time.    This should be plain enough. Yet see what strong intellects dare not  yet hear God himself, unless he speak the phraseology of I know not  what David, or Jeremiah, or Paul. We shall not always set so great a  price on a few texts, on a few lives.[214] We are like children who  repeat by rote the sentences of grandames and tutors, and, as they  grow older, of the men and talents and characters they chance to  see,--painfully recollecting the exact words they spoke; afterwards,  when they come into the point of view which those had who uttered  those saying, they understand them, and are willing to let the words  go; for, at any time, they can use words as good when occasion comes.  If we live truly, we shall see truly. It is as easy for the strong man  to be strong, as it is for the weak to be weak. When we have new  perception, we shall gladly disburden the memory of its hoarded  treasures as old rubbish. When a man lives with God, his voice shall  be as sweet as the murmur of the brook and the rustle of the corn.    And now at last the highest truth on this subject remains unsaid;  probably cannot be said; for all that we say is the far-off  remembering of the intuition. That thought, by what I can now nearest  approach to say it, is this. When good is near you, when you have  life in yourself, it is not by any known or accustomed way; you shall  not discern the footprints of any other; you shall not see the face of  man; you shall not hear any name;--the way, the thought, the good,  shall be wholly strange and new. It shall exclude example and  experience. You take the way from man, not to man. All persons that  ever existed are its forgotten ministers. Fear and hope are alike  beneath it. There is somewhat low even in hope. In the hour of vision,  there is nothing that can be called gratitude, nor properly joy. The  soul raised over passion beholds identity and eternal causation,  perceives the self-existence of Truth and Right, and calms itself with  knowing that all things go well. Vast spaces of nature, the Atlantic  Ocean, the South Sea,--long intervals of time, years, centuries,--are  of no account. This which I think and feel underlay every former state  of life and circumstances, as it does underlie my present, and what is  called life, and what is called death.    Life only avails, not the having lived. Power ceases in the instant of  repose; it resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new  state, in the shooting of the gulf, in the darting to an aim. This one  fact the world hates, that the soul _becomes_; for that forever  degrades the past, turns all riches to poverty, all reputation to  shame, confounds the saint with the rogue, shoves Jesus and Judas[215]  equally aside. Why, then, do we prate of self-reliance? Inasmuch as  the soul is present, there will be power not confident but agent.[216]  To talk of reliance is a poor external way of speaking. Speak rather  of that which relies, because it works and is. Who has more obedience  than I masters me, though he should not raise his finger. Round him I  must revolve by the gravitation of spirits. We fancy it rhetoric, when  we speak of eminent virtue. We do not yet see that virtue is Height,  and that a man or a company of men, plastic and permeable to  principles, by the law of nature must overpower and ride all cities,  nations, kings, rich men, poets, who are not.    This is the ultimate fact which we so quickly reach on this, as on  every topic, the resolution of all into the ever-blessed ONE.  Self-existence is the attribute of the Supreme Cause, and it  constitutes the measure of good by the degree in which it enters into  all lower forms. All things real are so by so much virtue as they  contain. Commerce, husbandry, hunting, whaling, war eloquence,  personal weight, are somewhat, and engage my respect as examples of  its presence and impure action. I see the same law working in nature  for conservation and growth. Power is in nature the essential measure  of right. Nature suffers nothing to remain in her kingdoms which  cannot help itself. The genesis and maturation of a planet, its poise  and orbit, the bended tree recovering itself from the strong wind, the  vital resources of every animal and vegetable, are demonstrations of  the self-sufficing, and therefore self-relying soul.    Thus all concentrates: let us not rove; let us sit at home with the  cause. Let us stun and astonish the intruding rabble of men and books  and institutions, by a simple declaration of the divine fact. Bid the  invaders take the shoes from off their feet, for God is here  within.[217] Let our simplicity judge them, and our docility to our  own law demonstrate the poverty of nature and fortune beside our  native riches.    But now we are a mob. Man does not stand in awe of man, nor is his  genius admonished to stay at home to put itself in communication with  the internal ocean, but it goes abroad to beg a cup of water of the  urns of other men. We must go alone. I like the silent church before  the service begins, better than any preaching. How far off, how cool,  how chaste the persons look, begirt each one with a precinct or  sanctuary! So let us always sit. Why should we assume the faults of  our friend, or wife, or father, or child, because they sit around our  hearth, or are said to have the same blood? All men have my blood, and  I have all men's.[218] Not for that will I adopt their petulance or  folly, even to the extent of being ashamed of it. But your isolation  must not be mechanical, but spiritual, that is, must be elevation. At  times the whole world seems to be in conspiracy to importune you with  emphatic trifles. Friend, client, child, sickness, fear, want,  charity, all knock at once at thy closet door, and say, \"Come out unto  us.\" But keep thy state; come not into their confusion. The power men  possess to annoy men, I give them by a weak curiosity. No man can  come near me but through my act. \"What we love that we have, but by"]]]
