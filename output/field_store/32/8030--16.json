The Greek kingdom of Syracuse indeed still remained  as an ally of Rome, and Messina and a few other cities were allowed to  choose their own magistrates and govern themselves.    Soon after, Sardinia and Corsica were given up to the Romans by the  hired armies of the Carthaginians, and as the natives fought hard  against Rome, when they were conquered they were for the most part sold  as slaves. These two islands likewise had a propraetor.    The Romans now had all the peninsula south of themselves, and as far  north as Ariminim (now shortened into Rimini), but all beyond belonged  to the Gauls--the Cisalpine Gauls, or Gauls on this side the Alps, as  the Romans called them; while those on the other side were called  Transalpine Gauls, or Gauls across the Alps. These northern Gauls were  gathering again for an inroad on the south, and in the midst of the  rumors of this danger there was a great thunderstorm at Rome, and the  Capitol was struck by lightning. The Sybilline books were searched into  to see what this might mean, and a warning was found, \"Beware of the  Gauls.\" Moreover, there was a saying that the Greeks and Gauls should  one day enjoy the Forum; but the Romans fancied they could satisfy this  prophecy by burying a man and woman of each nation, slaves, in the  middle of the Forum, and then they prepared to attack the Gauls in their  own country before the inroad could be made. There was a great deal of  hard fighting, lasting for years; and in the course of it the consul,  Caius Flaminius, began the great road which has since been called after  him the Flaminian Way, and was the great northern road from Rome, as  the Appian Way was the southern.    [Illustration: THE WOUNDED GAUL.]    The great hero of the war was Marcus Claudius Marcellus, who had already  made himself known for his dauntless courage. As consul, he fought a  desperate battle on the banks of the Po with the Gauls of both sides the  Alps, and himself killed their king or chief, Viridomar. He brought the  spoils to Rome, and hung them in the Temple of Jupiter. It was only the  third time in the history of Rome that such a thing had been done.  Cisalpine Gaul was thus subdued, and another road was made to secure  it; while in the short peace that followed the gates of the Temple of  Janus were shut, having stood open ever since the reign of Numa.    The Romans were beginning to make their worship the same with that of  the Greeks. They sent offerings to Greek temples, said that their old  gods were the same as those of the Greeks, only under different names,  and sent an embassy to Epidaurus to ask for a statue of Esculapius, the  god of medicine and son of Phoebus Apollo. The emblem of Esculapius was  a serpent, and tame serpents were kept about his temple at Epidaurus.  One of these glided into the Roman galley that had come for the statue,  and it was treated with great respect by all the crew until they sailed  up the Tiber, when it made its way out of the vessel and swam to the  island which had been formed by the settling of the mud round the heap  of corn that had been thrown into the river when Porsena wasted the  country. This was supposed to mean that the god himself took possession  of the place, and a splendid temple there rose in his honor.    Another imitation of the Greeks which came into fashion at this time had  a sad effect on the Romans. The old funerals in Greek poems had ended  by games and struggles between swordsmen. Two brothers of the Brutus  family first showed off such a game at their father's funeral, and it  became a regular custom, not only at funerals, but whenever there was  need to entertain the people, to show off fights of swordsmen. The  soldier captives from conquered nations were used in this way; and some  persons kept schools of slaves, who were trained for these fights and  called gladiators. The battle was a real one, with sharp weapons, for  life or death; and when a man was struck down, he was allowed to live or  sentenced to death according as the spectators turned down or turned up  their thumbs. The Romans fancied that the sight trained them to be  brave, and to despise death and wounds; but the truth was that it only  made them hard-hearted, and taught them to despise other people's  pain--a very different thing from despising their own.    Another thing that did great harm was the making it lawful for a man to  put away a wife who had no children. This ended by making the Romans  much less careful to have one good wife, and the Roman ladies became  much less noble and excellent than they had been in the good old days.    [Illustration: HANNIBAL'S VOW.]    In the meantime, the Carthaginians, having lost the three islands,  began to spread their settlements further in Spain, where their chief  colony was New Carthage, or, as we call it, Carthagena. The mountains  were full of gold mines, and the Iberians, the nation who held them,  were brave and warlike, so that there was much fighting to train up  fresh armies. Hamilcar, the chief general in command there, had four  sons, whom he said were lion whelps being bred up against Rome. He took  them with him to Spain, and at a great sacrifice for the success of his  arms the youngest and most promising, Hannibal, a boy of nine years old,  was made to lay his hand on the altar of Baal and take an oath that he  would always be the enemy of the Romans. Hamilcar was killed in battle,  but Hannibal grew up to be all that he had hoped, and at twenty-six was  in command of the army. He threatened the Iberians of Saguntum, who sent  to ask help from Rome. A message was sent to him to forbid him to  disturb the ally of Rome; but he had made up his mind for war, and never  even asked the Senate of Carthage what was to be done, but went on with  the siege of Saguntum. Rome was busy with a war in Illyria, and could  send no help, and the Saguntines held out with the greatest bravery and  constancy, month after month, till they were all on the point of  starvation, then kindled a great fire, slew all their wives and  children, and let Hannibal win nothing but a pile of smoking ruins.    [Illustration: IN THE PYRENEES.]    Again the Romans sent to Carthage to complain, but the Senate there had  made up their minds that war there must be, and that it was a good time  when Rome had a war in Illyria on her hands, and Cisalpine Gaul hardly  subdued; and they had such a general as Hannibal, though they did not  know what a wonderful scheme he had in his mind, namely, to make his  way by land from Spain to Italy, gaining the help of the Gauls, and  stirring up all those nations of Italy who had fought so long against  Rome. His march, which marks the beginning of the Second Punic War,  started from the banks of the Ebro in the beginning of the summer of  219. His army was 20,000 foot and 12,000 horse, partly Carthaginian,  partly Gaul and Iberian. The horsemen were Moorish, and he had  thirty-seven elephants. He left his brother Hasdrubal with 10,000 men at  the foot of the Pyrenees and pushed on, but he could not reach the Alps  before the late autumn, and his passage is one of the greatest wonders  of history. Roads there were none, and he had to force his way up the  passes of the Little St. Bernard through snow and ice, terrible to the  men and animals of Africa, and fighting all the way, so that men and  horses perished in great numbers, and only seven of the elephants were  left when he at length descended into the plains of Northern Italy,  where he hoped the Cisalpine Gauls would welcome him.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER XIX.    THE SECOND PUNIC WAR.    219.      When the Romans heard that Hannibal had passed the Pyrenees, they had  two armies on foot, one under Publius Cornelius Scipio, which was to go  to Spain, and the other under Tiberius Sempronius Longus, to attack  Africa. They changed their plan, and kept Sempronius to defend Italy,  while Scipio went by sea to Marsala, a Greek colony in Gaul, to try to  stop Hannibal at the Rhone; but he was too late, and therefore, sending  on most of his army to Spain, he came back himself with his choicest  troops. With these he tried to stop the enemy from crossing the river  Ticinus, but he was defeated and so badly wounded that his life was only  saved by the bravery of his son, who led him out of the battle.    [Illustration: MEETING OF HANNIBAL AND SCIPIO AT ZAMA.]    Before he was able to join the army again, Sempronius had fought  another battle with Hannibal on the banks of the Trebia and suffered a  terrible defeat. But winter now came on, and the Carthaginians found it  very hard to bear in the marshes of the Arno. Hannibal himself was so  ill that he only owed his life to the last of his elephants, which  carried him safely through when he was almost blind, and in the end he  lost an eye. In the spring he went on ravaging the country in hopes to  make the two new consuls, Flaminius and Servilius, fight with him, but  they were too cautious, until at last Flaminius attacked him in a heavy  fog on the shore of Lake Trasimenus. It is said that an earthquake shook  the ground, and that the eager warriors never perceived it; but again  the Romans lost, Flaminius was killed, and there was a dreadful  slaughter, for Hannibal had sworn to give no quarter to a Roman. The  only thing that was hopeful for Rome was that neither Gauls, Etruscans,  nor Italians showed any desire to rise in favor of Hannibal; and though  he was now very near Rome, he durst not besiege it without the help of  the people around to bring him supplies, so he only marched southwards,  hoping to gain the support of the Greek colonies. A dictator was  appointed, Quintus Fabius Maximus, who saw that, by strengthening all  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16672"],[0,"The Last Journals of David Livingstone, in Central Africa, from 1865 to His (#15)"],[1,"rties. We slept at one garden; and as we  were told by Chenjewala's people to take what we liked, and my men had  no food, we gleaned what congo beans, bean leaves, and sorghum stalks  we could,--poor fare enough, but all we could get.    _29th June, 1866._--We came onto Machemba's brother, Chimseia, who  gave us food at once. The country is now covered with deeper soil, and  many large acacia-trees grow in the rich loam: the holms too are  large, and many islands afford convenient maize grounds. One of the  Nassiek lads came up and reported his bundle, containing 240 yards of  calico, had been stolen; he went aside, leaving it on the path  (probably fell asleep), and it was gone when he came back. I cannot  impress either on them or the sepoys that it is wrong to sleep on the  march.    Akosakone, whom we had liberated, now arrived at the residence of her  husband, who was another brother of Machemba. She behaved like a lady  all through, sleeping at a fire apart from the men. The ladies of the  different villages we passed condoled with her, and she related to  them the indignity that had been done to her. Besides this she did us  many services: she bought food for us, because, having a good address,  we saw that she could get double what any of our men could purchase  for the same cloth; she spoke up for us when any injustice was  attempted, and, when we were in want of carriers, volunteered to carry  a bag of beads on her head. On arriving at Machemba's brother,  Chimseia, she introduced me to him, and got him to be liberal to us in  food on account of the service we had rendered to her. She took leave  of us all with many expressions of thankfulness, and we were glad that  we had not mistaken her position or lavished kindness on the  undeserving.    One Johanna man was caught stealing maize, then another, after I had  paid for the first. I sent a request to the chief not to make much of  a grievance about it, as I was very much ashamed at my men stealing;  he replied that he had liked me from the first, and I was not to fear,  as whatever service he could do he would most willingly in order to  save me pain and trouble. A sepoy now came up having given his musket  to a man to carry, who therefore demanded payment. As it had become a  regular nuisance for the sepoys to employ people to carry for them,  telling them that I would pay, I demanded why he had promised in my  name. \"Oh, it was but a little way he carried the musket,\" said he.  Chimseia warned us next morning, 30th June, against allowing any one  to straggle or steal in front, for stabbing and plundering were the  rule. The same sepoy who had employed a man to carry his musket now  came forward, with his eyes fixed and shaking all over. This, I was to  understand, meant extreme weakness; but I had accidentally noticed him  walking quite smartly before this exhibition, so I ordered him to keep  close to the donkey that carried the havildar's luggage, and on no  account to remain behind the party. He told the havildar that he would  sit down only for a little while; and, I suppose, fell asleep, for he  came up to us in the evening as naked as a robin.    I saw another person bound to a tree and dead--a sad sight to see,  whoever was the perpetrator. So many slave-sticks lie along our path,  that I suspect the people here-about make a practice of liberating  what slaves they cian find abandoned on the march, to sell them again.    A large quantity of maize is cultivated at Chimsaka's, at whose place  we this day arrived. We got a supply, but being among thieves, we  thought it advisable to move on to the next place (Mtarika's). When  starting, we found that fork, kettle, pot, and shot-pouch had been  taken. The thieves, I observed, kept up a succession of jokes with  Chuma and Wikatani and when the latter was enjoying them, gaping to  the sky, they were busy putting the things of which he had charge  under their cloths! I spoke to the chief, and he got the three first  articles back for me.    A great deal if not all the lawlessness of this quarter is the result  of the slave-trade, for the Arabs buy whoever is brought to them and  in a country covered with forest as this is, kidnapping can be  prosecuted with the greatest ease; elsewhere the people are honest,  and have a regard for justice.    _1st July, 1866._--As we approach Mtarika's place, the country becomes  more mountainous and the land sloping for a mile down to the south  bank of the Rovuma supports a large population. Some were making new  gardens by cutting down trees and piling the branches for burning;  others had stored tip large quantities of grain and were moving it to  a new locality, but they were all so well supplied with calico  (Merikano) that they would not look at ours: the market was in fact  glutted by slavers from (Quiloa) Kilwa. On asking why people were seen  tied to trees to die as we had seen them, they gave the usual answer  that the Arabs tie them thus and leave them to perish, because they  are vexed, when the slaves can walk no further, that they have lost  their money by them. The path is almost strewed with slave-sticks, and  though the people denied it, I suspect that they make a practice of  following slave caravans and cutting off the sticks from those who  fall out in the march, and thus stealing them. By selling them again  they get the quantities of cloth we see. Some asked for gaudy prints,  of which we had none, because we knew that the general taste of the  Africans of the Interior is for strength rather than show in what they  buy.    The Rovuma here is about 100 yards broad, and still keeps up its  character of a rapid stream, with sandy banks and islands: the latter  are generally occupied, as being defensible when the river is in  flood.    _2nd July, 1866._--We rested at Mtarika's old place; and though we had  to pay dearly with our best table-cloths[14] for it, we got as much as  made one meal a day. At the same dear rate we could give occasionally  only two ears of maize to each man; and if the sepoys got their  comrades' corn into their hands, they eat it without shame. We had to  bear a vast amount of staring, for the people, who are Waiyau, have a  great deal of curiosity, and are occasionally rather rude. They have  all heard of our wish to stop the slave-trade, and are rather taken  aback when told that by selling they are part and part guilty of the  mortality of which we had been unwilling spectators. Some were  dumbfounded when shown that in the eye of their Maker they are parties  to the destruction of human life which accompanies this traffic both  by sea and land. If they did not sell, the Arabs would not come to  buy. Chuma and Wakatani render what is said very eloquently in Chiyau,  most of the people being of their tribe, with only a sprinkling of  slaves. Chimseia, Chimsaka, Mtarika, Mtende, Makanjela, Mataka, and  all the chiefs and people in our route to the Lake, are Waiyau, or  Waiau.[15]    On the southern slope down to the river there are many oozing springs  and damp spots where rice has been sown and reaped. The adjacent land  has yielded large crops of sorghum, congo-beans, and pumpkins.  Successive crowds of people came to gaze. My appearance and acts often  cause a burst of laughter; sudden standing up produces a flight of  women and children. To prevent peeping into the hut which I occupy,  and making the place quite dark, I do my writing in the verandah.  Chitane, the poodle dog, the buffalo-calf, and our only remaining  donkey are greeted with the same amount of curiosity and  laughter-exciting comment as myself.    Every evening a series of loud musket reports is heard from the  different villages along the river; these are imitation evening guns.  All copy the Arabs in dress and chewing tobacco with \"nora\" lime, made  from burnt river shells instead of betel-nut and lime. The women are  stout, well-built persons, with thick arms and legs; their heads  incline to the bullet shape; the lip-rings are small; the tattoo a  mixture of Makoa and Waiyau. Fine blue and black beads are in fashion,  and so are arm-coils of thick brass wire. Very nicely inlaid combs are  worn in the hair; the inlaying is accomplished by means of a gum got  from the root of an orchis called _Nangazu_.    _3rd July, 1866._--A short march brought us to Mtarika's new place.  The chief made his appearance only after he had ascertained all he  could about us. The population is immense; they are making new  gardens, and the land is laid out by straight lines about a foot  broad, cut with the hoe; one goes miles without getting beyond the  marked or surveyed fields.    Mtarika came at last; a big ugly man, with large mouth and receding  forehead. He asked to see all our curiosities, as the watch, revolver,  breech-loading rifle, sextant. I gave him a lecture on the evil of  selling his people, and he wished me to tell all the other chiefs the  same thing.    They dislike the idea of guilt being attached to them for having sold  many who have lost their lives on their way down to the sea-coast. We  had a long visit from Mtarika next day; he gave us meal, and meat of  wild hog, with a salad made of bean-leaves. A wretched Swaheli Arab,  ill with rheumatism, came for aid, and got a cloth. They all profess  to me to be buying ivory only.    _5th July, 1866._--We left for Mtende, who is the last chief before  we enter on a good eight days' march to Mataka's; we might have gone  to Kandulo's, who is near the Rovuma, and more to the north, but all  are so well supplied with everything by slave-traders that we have  difficulty in getting provisions at all. Mataka has plenty of all  kinds of food. On the way we passed the burnt bones of a person Avho  was accused of having eaten human flesh; he had been poisoned, or, as  they said, killed by poison (muave?), and then burned. His clothes  were hung, up on trees by the wayside as a warning to others. The"]]]
