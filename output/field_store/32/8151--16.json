In the frequent revolutions which had of late taken place, the right of  blood had still prevailed over religious prejudices; and the nation had  ever shown itself disposed rather to change its faith than the order of  succession. Even many Protestants declared themselves in favor of  Mary's claim of inheritance;[*] and nothing would occasion more general  disgust, than to see the queen, openly and without reserve, take part  against it.         * Keith, p. 322.    The Scottish princess also, finding herself injured in so sensible a  point, would thenceforth act as a declared enemy; and uniting together  her foreign and domestic friends, the partisans of her present title  and of her eventual succession, would soon bring matters to extremities  against the present establishment. The queen, weighing all these  inconveniences, which were great and urgent, was determined to keep  both parties in awe, by maintaining still an ambiguous conduct; and she  rather chose that the people should run the hazard of contingent events,  than that she herself should visibly endanger her throne, by employing  expedients, which, at best, would not bestow entire security on the  nation. She gave, therefore, an evasive answer to the applications of  the commons; and when the house, at the end of the session, desired, by  the mouth of their speaker, further satisfaction on that head, she could  not be prevailed on to make her reply more explicit. She only told them,  contrary to her declarations in the beginning of her reign, that she had  fixed no absolute resolution against marriage; and she added, that the  difficulties attending the question of the succession were so great that  she would be contented, for the sake of her people, to remain some  time longer in this vale of misery; and never should depart life with  satisfaction, till she had laid some solid foundation for their future  security.[*]    The most remarkable law passed this session, was that which bore the  title of \"Assurance of the queen's royal power over all states and  subjects within her dominions.\"[**] By this act, the asserting twice,  by writing, word, or deed, the pope's authority, was subjected to the  penalties of treason. All persons in holy orders were bound to take the  oath of supremacy; as also all who were advanced to any degree, either  in the universities or in common law; all schoolmasters, officers in  court, or members of parliament: and the penalty of their second  refusal was treason. The first offence, in both cases, was punished by  banishment and forfeiture. This rigorous statute was not extended to  any of the degree of a baron; because it was not supposed that the  queen could entertain any doubt with regard to the fidelity of persons  possessed of such high dignity. Lord Montacute made opposition to the  bill; and asserted, in favor of the Catholics, that they disputed not,  they preached not, they disobeyed not the queen, they caused no trouble,  no tumults among the people.[***] It is, however, probable, that  some suspicions of their secret conspiracies had made the queen and  parliament increase their rigor against them; though it is also more  than probable, that they were mistaken in the remedy.    There was likewise another point, in which the parliament, this session,  showed more the goodness of their intention than the soundness of their  judgment. They passed a law against fond and fantastical prophecies,  which had been observed to seduce the people into rebellion and  disorder:[****] but at the same time they enacted a statute, which  was most likely to increase these and such like superstitions: it was  levelled against conjurations, enchantments, and witchcraft.[v]         * Sir Simon D'Ewes's Journal, p. 75.         ** 5 Eliz. c. 1.         *** Strype, vol. i. p 260.         **** 5 Eliz. c. I         v 5 Eliz. c. 16.    Witchcraft and heresy are two crimes which commonly increase by  punishment, and never are so effectually suppressed as by being totally  neglected. After the parliament had granted the queen a supply of one  subsidy and two fifteenths, the session was finished by a prorogation.  The convocation likewise voted the queen a subsidy of six shillings in  the pound, payable in three years.    While the English parties exerted these calm efforts against each other  in parliamentary votes and debates, the French factions, inflamed to  the highest degree of animosity, continued that cruel war which their  intemperate zeal, actuated by the ambition of their leaders, had kindled  in the kingdom. The admiral was successful in reducing the towns of  Normandy which held for the king; but he frequently complained that  the numerous garrison of Havre remained totally inactive, and was not  employed in any military operation against the common enemy. The queen,  in taking possession of that place, had published a manifesto,[*] in  which she pretended that her concern for the interests of the French  king had engaged her in that measure, and that her sole intention was  to oppose her enemies of the house of Guise, who held their prince in  captivity, and employed his power to the destruction of his best  and most faithful subjects. It was chiefly her desire to preserve  appearances, joined to the great frugality of her temper, which made her  at this critical juncture keep her soldiers in garrison, and restrain  them from committing further hostilities upon the enemy.[**]         * Forbes, vol. ii.         ** Forbes, vol. ii. p. 276, 277.    The duke of Guise, meanwhile, was aiming a mortal blow at the power of  the Hugonots; and had commenced the siege of Orleans, of which Andelot  was governor, and where the constable was detained prisoner. He had the  prospect of speedy success in this undertaking; when he was assassinated  by Poltrot, a young gentleman whose zeal, instigated (as is pretended,  though without any certain foundation) by the admiral, and Beza, a  famous preacher, led him to attempt that criminal enterprise. The death  of this gallant prince was a sensible loss to the Catholic party;  and though the cardinal of Lorraine, his brother, still supported the  interests of the family, the danger of their progress appeared not so  imminent either to Elizabeth or to the French Protestants. The union,  therefore, between these allies, which had been cemented by their common  fears, began thenceforth to be less intimate; and the leaders of the  Hugonots were persuaded to hearken to terms of a separate accommodation.  Conde and Montmorency held conferences for settling the peace; and as  they were both of them impatient to relieve themselves from captivity,  they soon came to an agreement with regard to the conditions. The  character of the queen regent, whose ends were always violent, but who  endeavored by subtlety and policy, rather than force, to attain  them, led her to embrace any plausible terms; and in spite of the  protestations of the admiral, whose sagacity could easily discover the  treachery of the court, the articles of agreement were finally settled  between the parties. A toleration under some restrictions was anew  granted to the Protestants; a general amnesty was published; Conde was  reinstated in his offices and governments; and after money was advanced  for the payment of arrears due to the German troops, they were dismissed  the kingdom.    By the agreement between Elizabeth and the prince of Conde, it had been  stipulated,[*] that neither party should conclude peace without the  consent of the other; but this article was at present but little  regarded by the leaders of the French Protestants. They only  comprehended her so far in the treaty, as to obtain a promise that,  on her relinquishing Havre, her charges, and the money which she had  advanced them, should be repaid her by the king of France, and that  Calais, on the expiration of the term, should be restored to her. But  she disdained to accept of these conditions; and thinking the possession  of Havre a much better pledge for effecting her purpose, she sent  Warwick orders to prepare himself against an attack from the now united  power of the French monarchy.    The earl of Warwick, who commanded a garrison of six thousand men,  besides seven hundred pioneers, had no sooner got possession of Havre,  than he employed every means for putting it in a posture of defence;[**]  and after expelling the French from the town, he encouraged his soldiers  to make the most desperate defence against the enemy. The constable  commanded the French army; the queen regent herself and the king were  present in the camp; even the prince of Conde joined the king's forces,  and gave countenance to this enterprise; the admiral and Andelot  alone, anxious still to preserve the friendship of Elizabeth, kept at  a distance, and prudently refused to join their ancient enemies in an  attack upon their allies.         * Forbes, vol. ii. p. 79.         ** Forbes, vol. ii. p. 158.    From the force, and dispositions, and situation of both sides it was  expected that the siege would be attended with some memorable event; yet  did France make a much easier acquisition of this important place  than was at first apprehended. The plague crept in among the English  soldiers; and being increased by their fatigue and bad diet, (for they  were but ill supplied with provisions,[*]) it made such ravages, that  sometimes a hundred men a day died of it; and there remained not, at  last, fifteen hundred in a condition to do duty.[**] The French, meeting  with such feeble resistance, carried on their attacks successfully; and  having made two"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19215"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part E. (#15)"],[1,"king, deprived  of his most faithful friends, be obliged to abate those high claims of  prerogative on which at present he insisted.    But Charles, besides a view of the political consequences which must  result from a compliance with such pretensions, was strongly determined,  from principles of piety and conscience, to oppose them. Neither the  dissipation incident to youth, nor the pleasures attending a high  fortune, had been able to prevent this virtuous prince from embracing  the most sincere sentiments of religion: and that character, which in  that religious age should have been of infinite advantage to him, proved  in the end the chief cause of his ruin; merely because the religion  adopted by him was not of that precise mode and sect which began to  prevail among his subjects. His piety, though remote from Popery, had a  tincture of superstition in it; and, being averse to the gloomy  spirit of the Puritans, was represented by them as tending towards the  abominations of Antichrist. Laud also had unfortunately acquired a great  ascendant over him; and as all those prelates obnoxious to the commons,  were regarded as his chief friends and most favored courtiers, he was  resolved not to disarm and dishonor himself by abandoning them to the  resentment of his enemies. Being totally unprovided with military  force, and finding a refractory, independent spirit to prevail among the  people, the most solid basis of his authority, he thought consisted in  the support which he received from the hierarchy.    In the debates of the commons, which are transmitted to us, it is  easy to discern so early some sparks of that enthusiastic fire which  afterwards set the whole nation in combustion. One Rouse made use of  an allusion which, though familiar seems to have been borrowed from the  writings of Lord Bacon.[*] \"If a man meet a dog alone,\" said he, \"the  dog is fearful, though ever so fierce by nature: but if the dog have  his master with him, he will set upon that man from whom he fled before.  This shows, that lower natures, being backed by higher, increase in  courage and strength; and certainly man, being backed with Omnipotency,  is a kind of omnipotent creature. All things are possible to him  that believes; and where all things are possible, there is a kind of  omnipotency. Wherefore, let it be the unanimous consent and resolution  of us all, to make a vow and covenant henceforth to hold fast our God  and our religion; and then shall we henceforth expect with certainty  happiness in this world.\"[**]    Oliver Cromwell, at that time a young man of no account in the nation,  is mentioned in these debates, as complaining of one who, he was told,  preached flat Popery.[***] It is amusing to observe the first words of  this fanatical hypocrite correspond so exactly to his character.    The inquiries and debates concerning tonnage and poundage went hand in  hand with these theological or metaphysical controversies. The officers  of the custom-house were summoned before the commons, to give an account  by what authority they had seized the goods of merchants who had  refused to pay these duties: the barons of the exchequer were questioned  concerning their decrees on that head.[****] One of the sheriffs of  London was committed to the Tower for his activity in supporting the  officers of the custom-house: the goods of Rolles, a merchant, and  member of the house, being seized for his refusal to pay the duties,  complaints were made of this violence as if it were a breach of  privilege:[v] Charles supported his officers in all these measures;  and the quarrel grew every day higher between him and the commons.[v*]  Mention was made in the house of impeaching Sir Richard Weston the  treasurer;[v**] and the king began to entertain thoughts of finishing  the session by a dissolution.         * Essay of Atheism.         ** Rushworth, vol. i. p. 646.

Sir John Elliot framed a remonstrance against levying tonnage and  poundage without consent of parliament, and offered it to the clerk to  read. It was refused. He read it himself. The question being then called  for, the speaker, Sir John Finch, said, \"That he had a command from the  king to adjourn, and to put no question;\"[*] upon which he rose and left  the chair. The whole house was in an uproar. The speaker was pushed back  into the chair, and forcibly held in it by Hollis and Valentine, till a  short remonstrance was framed, and was passed by acclamation rather than  by vote. Papists and Arminians were there declared capital enemies to  the commonwealth. Those who levied tonnage and poundage were branded  with the same epithet. And even the merchant who should voluntarily pay  these duties, were denominated betrayers of English liberty, and public  enemies. The doom, being locked, the gentleman usher of the house of  lords, who was sent by the king, could not get admittance till this  remonstrance was finished. By the king's order, he took the mace from  the table, which ended their proceedings,[**] and a few days after the  parliament was dissolved.    The discontents of the nation ran high, on account of this violent  rupture between the king and parliament. These discontents Charles  inflamed by his affectation of a severity which he had not power, nor  probably inclination, to carry to extremities. Sir Miles Hobart, Sir  Peter Heyman, Selden, Coriton, Long, Strode, were committed to prison on  account of the last tumult in the house, which was called sedition.[***]         * The king's power of adjourning, as well as proroguing the       parliament, was and is never questioned. In the nineteenth       of the late king, the judges determined, that the       adjournment by the king kept the parliament in statu quo       until the next sitting, but that then no committees were to       meet; but if the adjournment be by the house then the       committees and other matters do continue.

Hist. vol. viii.       p. 354 May, p. 13    With great difficulty, and after several delays, they were released; and  the law was generally supposed to be wrested in order to prolong their  imprisonment. Sir John Elliot, Hollis, and Valentine, were summoned to  their trial in the king's bench, for seditious speeches and behavior in  parliament; but refusing to answer before an inferior court for their  conduct as members of a superior, they were condemned to be imprisoned  during the king's pleasure, to find sureties for their good behavior,  and to be fined, the two former a thousand pounds apiece, the latter  five hundred.[*] This sentence, procured by the influence of the  crown, served only to show the king's disregard to the privileges  of parliament, and to acquire an immense stock of popularity to the  sufferers who had so bravely, in opposition to arbitrary power, defended  the liberties of their native country. The commons of England, though  an immense body, and possessed of the greater part of national property,  were naturally somewhat defenceless, because of their personal  equality, and their want of leaders: but the king's severity, if these  prosecutions deserve the name, here pointed out leaders to them, whose  resentment was inflamed, and whose courage was nowise daunted, by the  hardships which they had undergone in so honorable a cause.    So much did these prisoners glory in their sufferings, that, though they  were promised liberty on that condition, they would not condescend even  to present a petition to the king, expressing their sorrow for having  offended him.[**] They unanimously refused to find sureties for their  good behavior, and disdained to accept of deliverance on such easy  terms. Nay, Hollis was so industrious to continue his meritorious  distress, that when one offered to bail him, he would not yield to the  rule of court, and be himself bound with his friend. Even Long, who  had actually found sureties in the chief justice's chamber, declared in  court that his sureties should no longer continue.[***] Yet because Sir  John Elliot Happened to die while in custody, a great clamor was raised  against the administration; and he was universally regarded as a martyr  to the liberties of England.[****]         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 684, 691.         ** Whitlocke, p. *13.         *** Kennet vol. iii. p. 49.         **** Rushworth, vol. v. p. 440.            CHAPTER LII          CHARLES I.    {1629.} There now opens to us a new scene. Charles naturally disgusted  with parliaments, who, he found, were determined to proceed against him  with unmitigated rigor, both in invading his prerogative and refusing  him all supply, resolved not to call any more, till he should see  greater indications of a compliant disposition in the nation. Having  lost his great favorite, Buckingham, he became his own minister and  never afterwards reposed in any one such unlimited confidence. As  he chiefly follows his own genius and disposition, his measures  are henceforth less rash and hasty; though the general tenor of his  administration still wants somewhat of being entirely legal, and perhaps  more of being entirely prudent.    We shall endeavor to exhibit a just idea of the events which followed  for some years, so far as they regard foreign affairs, the state of  the court, and the government of the nation. The incidents are neither  numerous nor illustrious; but the knowledge of them is necessary for  understanding the subsequent transactions which are so memorable.
