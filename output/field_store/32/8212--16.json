Armies fought, as a  rule, only in the five summer months; it was difficult enough to  victual them for even that time; and lack of commissariat or transport  crippled all the invasions of Scotland. Hertford sacked Edinburgh, (p. 069)  but he went by sea. No other capital except Rome saw an invading army.  Neither Henry nor Maximilian, Ferdinand nor Charles, ever penetrated  more than a few miles into France, and French armies got no further  into Spain, the Netherlands, or Germany. Machiavelli points out that  the chief safeguard of France against the Spaniards was that the latter  could not victual their army sufficiently to pass the Pyrenees.[148]  If in Italy it was different, it was because Italy herself invited the  invaders, and was mainly under foreign dominion. Henry knew that with  the means at his disposal he could never conquer France; his claims to  the crown were transparent conventions, and he was always ready for  peace in return for the _status quo_ and a money indemnity, with a  town or so for security.                       [Footnote 147: In 1520 he described his title \"King                     of France\" as a title given him by others which was                     \"good for nothing\" (_Ven. Cal._, iii., 45). Its                     value consisted in the pensions he received as a                     sort of commutation.]                       [Footnote 148: Machiavelli, _Opera_, iv., 139.]    The fact that he had only achieved a small part of the conquest he  professed to set out to accomplish was, therefore, no bar to  negotiations for peace. There were many reasons for ending the war;  the rapid diminution of his father's treasures; the accession to the  papal throne of the pacific Leo in place of the warlike Julius; the  absolution of Louis as a reward for renouncing the council of Pisa;  the interruption of the trade with Venice; the attention required by  Scotland now that her king was Henry's infant nephew; and lastly, his  betrayal first by Ferdinand and now by the Emperor. In October, 1513,  at Lille, a treaty had been drawn up binding Henry, Maximilian and  Ferdinand to a combined invasion of France before the following  June.[149] On 6th December, Ferdinand wrote to Henry to say he     (p. 070)  had signed the treaty. He pointed out the sacrifices he was making  in so doing; he was induced to make them by considering that the war  was to be waged in the interests of the Holy Church, of Maximilian,  Henry, and Catherine, and by his wish and hope to live and die in  friendship with the Emperor and the King of England. He thought,  however, that to make sure of the assistance of God, the allies ought  to bind themselves, if He gave them the victory, to undertake a  general war on the infidel.[150] Ferdinand seems to have imagined that  he could dupe the Almighty as easily as he hoped to cheat his allies,  by a pledge which he never meant to fulfil. A fortnight after this  despatch he ordered Carroz not to ratify the treaty he himself had  already signed.[151] The reason was not far to seek. He was deluding  himself with the hope, which Louis shrewdly encouraged, that the  French King would, after his recent reverses, fall in with the  Spaniard's Italian plans.[152] Louis might even, he thought, of his  own accord cede Milan and Genoa, which would annihilate the French  King's influence in Italy, and greatly facilitate the attack on  Venice.                       [Footnote 149: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 138, 143; _L. and                     P._, i., 4511, 4560.]                       [Footnote 150: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 132.]                       [Footnote 151: _Ibid._, ii., 159.]                       [Footnote 152: _Ibid._, ii., 158, 163.]    That design had occupied him throughout the summer, before Louis had  become so amenable; then he was urging Maximilian that the Pope must  be kept on their side and persuaded \"not to forgive the great sins  committed by the King of France\"; for if he removed his ecclesiastical  censures, Ferdinand and Maximilian \"would be deprived of a plausible  excuse for confiscating the territories they intended to conquer\".[153]  Providence was, as usual, to be bribed into assisting in the       (p. 071)  robbery of Venice by a promise to make war on the Turk. But now that  Louis was prepared to give his daughter Renee in marriage to young  Ferdinand and to endow the couple with Milan and Genoa and his claims  on Naples, his sins might be forgiven. The two monarchs would not be  justified in making war upon France in face of these offers. Venice  remained a difficulty, for Louis was not likely to help to despoil his  faithful ally; but Ferdinand had a suggestion. They could all make  peace publicly guaranteeing the Republic's possessions, but Maximilian  and he could make a \"mental reservation\" enabling them to partition  Venice, when France could no longer prevent it.[154]                       [Footnote 153: _Ibid._, ii., 131.]                       [Footnote 154: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 153.]    So on 13th March, 1514, Ferdinand renewed his truce with France, and  Maximilian joined it soon after.[155] The old excuses about the  reformation of the Church, his death-bed desire to make peace with his  enemies, could scarcely be used again; so Ferdinand instructed his  agent to say, if Henry asked for an explanation, that there was a  secret conspiracy in Italy.[156] If he had said no more, it would have  been literally true, for the conspiracy was his own; but he went on to  relate that the conspiracy was being hatched by the Italians to drive  him and the Emperor out of the peninsula. The two were alike in their  treachery; both secretly entered the truce with France and broke their  promise to Henry. Another engagement of longer standing was ruptured.  Since 1508, Henry's sister Mary had been betrothed to Maximilian's  grandson Charles. The marriage was to take place when Charles was  (p. 072)  fourteen; the pledge had been renewed at Lille, and the nuptials fixed  not later than 15th May, 1514.[157] Charles wrote to Mary signing  himself _votre mari_, while Mary was styled Princess of Castile,  carried about a bad portrait of Charles,[158] and diplomatically  sighed for his presence ten times a day. But winter wore on and turned  to spring; no sign was forthcoming of Maximilian's intention to keep  his grandson's engagement, and Charles was reported as having said  that he wanted a wife and not a mother.[159] All Henry's inquiries  were met by excuses; the Ides of May came and went, but they brought  no wedding between Mary and Charles.                       [Footnote 155: _Ibid._, ii., 164; _Ven. Cal._, ii.,                     389, 391, 401, 405.]                       [Footnote 156: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 167.]                       [Footnote 157: _L. and P._, i., 4560.]                       [Footnote 158: _Ibid._, i., 5203.]                       [Footnote 159: _Ven. Cal_., ii., 295. Charles was                     fourteen, Mary eighteen years of age.]    Henry was learning by bitter experience. Not only was he left to face  single-handed the might of Louis; but Ferdinand and Maximilian had  secretly bound themselves to make war on him, if he carried out the  treaty to which they had all three publicly agreed. The man whom he  said he loved as a natural father, and the titular sovereign of  Christendom, had combined to cheat the boy-king who had come to the  throne with youthful enthusiasms and natural, generous instincts. \"Nor  do I see,\" said Henry to Giustinian, \"any faith in the world save in  me, and therefore God Almighty, who knows this, prospers my affairs.\"[160]  This absorbing belief in himself and his righteousness led to strange  aberrations in later years, but in 1514 it had some justification. \"Je  vous assure,\" wrote Margaret of Savoy to her father, the Emperor,  (p. 073)  \"qu'en lui n'a nulle faintise.\" \"At any rate,\" said Pasqualigo, \"King  Henry has done himself great honour, and kept faith single-handed.\"[161]  A more striking testimony was forthcoming a year or two later. When  Charles succeeded Ferdinand, the Bishop of Badajos drew up for  Cardinal Ximenes a report on the state of the Prince's affairs. In it  he says: \"The King of England has been truer to his engagements  towards the House of Austria than any other prince. The marriage of  the Prince with the Princess Mary, it must be confessed, did not take  place, but it may be questioned whether it was the fault of the King  of England or of the Prince and his advisers. However that may be,  with the exception of the marriage, the King of England has generally  fulfilled his obligations towards the Prince, and has behaved as a  trusty friend. An alliance with the English can be trusted most of  all.\"[162]                       [Footnote 160: _L. and P._, ii., 3163.]                       [Footnote 161: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 406.]                       [Footnote 162: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 246.]    But the meekest and saintliest monarch could scarce pass unscathed  through the baptism of fraud practised on Henry; and Henry was at no  time saintly or meek. Ferdinand, he complained, induced him to enter  upon the war, and urged the Pope to use his influence with him for  that purpose; he had been at great expense, had assisted Maximilian,  taken Tournay, and reduced France to extremities; and now, when his  enemy was at his feet, Ferdinand talked of truce: he would never trust  any one again.[163] \"Had the King of Spain,\" wrote a Venetian attache,  \"kept his promise to the King of England, the latter would never have  made peace with France; and the promises of the Emperor were equally  false, for he had received many thousands of pounds from King      (p. 074)  Henry, on condition that he was to be in person at Calais in the month  of May, with a considerable force in the King's pay; but the Emperor"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20318"],[0,"Little Journeys to the Homes of the Great - Volume 14 (#15)"],[1," a dreamer, but he must also  be a mathematician, cold as chilled steel, and a philosopher who can  follow a reason to its lair and grapple it to the death. And that is why  Great Musicians are so rare, and that is also why, perhaps, there are no  great women composers. \"Women of genius are men,\" said the De Goncourts.  A Great Musician is a paradox, a miracle, a multiple-sided man--stern,  firm, selfish, proud and unyielding; yet sensuous as the ether, tender  as a woman, innocent as a child, and as plastic as potters' clay. And  with most of them, let us frankly admit it, the hand of the Potter  shook. When people write about musicians, they seldom write moderately.  The man is either a selfish rogue or an angel of light--it all depends  upon your point of view. And the curious part is, both sides are right.    Wieck was very fond of his daughters, and like good housewives who are  proud of their biscuit, he apologized for them. \"He never quite forgave  our mother because we were girls,\" said Clara once, to Kalkbrenner.  Wieck, the good man, was a philosopher, and he had a notion that the  blood of woman is thinner than that of man--that it contains more white  serum and fewer red corpuscles, and that Nature has designed the body of  a woman to nourish her offspring, but that man's energy goes to feed his  brain. Yet his girls were so much beyond average mortals that they would  set men a pace in spite of the handicap.    Fortunate it is for me that I do not have to act as the court of last  appeal on this genius business. The man who decides against woman will  forfeit his popularity, have his reputation ripped into carpet-rags, and  his good name worked up into crazy-quilts by a thousand Woman's Clubs.    But certain it is that women are the inspirers of music. As critics they  are more judicial and more appreciative. Without women there would be no  Symphony Concerts, any more than there would be churches.    Women take men to the Grand Opera and to Musical Festivals--and I am  glad.           *       *       *       *       *    Clara Wieck was only ten years old, with dresses that came to her knees,  when Robert Schumann first began to take lessons of her father. She was  tall for her age, and had a habit of brushing her hair from her eyes as  she played, that impressed the young man as very funny. She could not  remember a time when she did not play: and she showed such ease and  abandon that her father used to call her in and have her illustrate his  ideas on the keyboard.    Robert didn't like the child--she was needlessly talented. She could do,  just as a matter of course, the things that he could scarcely accomplish  with great effort. He didn't like her.    Already Clara had played in various concerts, and was a great favorite  with the local public. Soon her father planned little tours, when he  gave performances assisted by his two daughters, who could play both  violin and piano. Their fame grew and fortune smiled. Wieck took a  larger house and raised his prices for pupils.    Robert Schumann wandered over to Zwickau to visit his folks, then went  on down the Rhine to Heidelberg to see Rosen. It was nearly a year  before he got back to Leipzig, resolved to continue his music studies.  Wieck had a front room vacant, and so the young man took lodgings with  his teacher.    It was not so very long before Clara was wearing her dresses a little  longer. She now dressed her hair in two braids instead of one, and  these braids were tied with ribbons instead of a shoe-string. More  concerts were being arranged, and the attendance was larger--people were  saying that Clara Wieck was an Infant Phenomenon.    Robert was progressing, but not so rapidly as he wished. To aid matters  a bit, he invented a brace and extension to his middle finger. It gave  him a farther reach and a stronger stroke, he thought. In secret he  practised for hours with this \"corset\" on his finger; he didn't know  that a corset means weakness, not strength. After three straight hours  of practise one day, he took the machine from his hand and was  astonished to see the finger curl up like a pretzel. He hurried to a  physician and was told that the member was paralyzed. Various forms of  treatment were tried, but the tendons were injured, and at last the  doctors told him his brain could never again telegraph to that hand so  it would perfectly obey orders. He begged that they would cut the finger  off, but this they refused to do, claiming that, even though the finger  was in the way, piano-playing in any event was not the chief end of  man--he might try a pick and shovel.    Clara, who now wore her dress to her shoe-tops, sympathized with the  young man in his distress. She said, \"Never mind, I will play for  you--you write the music and I will play it!\"    Gradually he became resigned to this, and spent much of his time  composing music for Heine's songs and his own. Wieck didn't much like  these songs, and forbade his daughter playing such trashy things--only a  paraphrase of Schubert's work, anyway, goodness me!    The girl pouted and rebelled, and erelong Robert Schumann was requested  to take lodgings elsewhere. Moodily he obeyed, but he managed to keep up  a secret correspondence with Clara, through the help of her sister.  Whenever Clara played in public, Robert was sure to be there, even  though the distance were a hundred miles. He had given up playing, and  now swung between composing and literature, having assumed the  editorship of a musical magazine.    When Clara now played in concert, she wore a train, and her hair was  done up on the top of her head.    Schumann's musical magazine was winning its way--the young man had a  literary style. Mendelssohn commended the magazine, and its editor in  turn commended Mendelssohn. A new star had been discovered on the  horizon--a Pole, Chopin by name. And whenever Clara Wieck appeared,  there were extended notices, lavish in praise, profuse in prophecy.    Herz had written an article for a rival journal about Clara Wieck,  wherein the statement was made that no woman trained on, that her  playing was intuitive, and the limit quickly reached--marriage was death  to a woman's art, etc.    To this Schumann replied with needless heat, and his friends began to  joke him about his \"disinterestedness.\" He was getting moody, and there  were times when he was silent for days. His passion for Clara Wieck was  consuming his life. He resolved to go direct to Frederick Wieck and have  it out.           *       *       *       *       *    They are always called \"the Schumanns\"--Robert and Clara. You can not  separate them, any more than you can separate the great Robert Browning  and Elizabeth Barrett. \"Whomsoever God hath joined together, let no man  put asunder,\" seems rather a needless injunction, since we know that  man's efforts in the line of separation have ever but one result:  opposition fans the flame.    Just as Elizabeth Barrett's father forcibly opposed the mating of his  daughter, so did Frederick Wieck oppose the love of his daughter Clara  for Robert Schumann.    And one can not blame the man so very much--he knew the young man and he  knew the girl; and deducting fifty per cent for paternal pride, he saw  that the girl was much the stronger character of the two. Clara had  already a recognized reputation as a performer; her playing had made her  father rich, and he was sure that greater things were to come. Beside  that, she was only seventeen years old--a mere child.    Robert was twenty-six, with most of his future before him--he was  advised to win a name and place for himself before aspiring to the hand  of a great artist: and so he was bowed out.    He took the matter into the courts, and the decision was that, as she  was now eighteen years old, she had the right to wed, if she were so  minded.    And so they were married; but Frederick Wieck was not present at the  ceremony to give the bride away.           *       *       *       *       *    Schumann was essentially feminine in many ways, as the best men always  are. In spite of his mental independence, he did his best work when  shielded in the shadow of a stronger personality. Without Clara, Robert  would probably be unknown to us. She gave him the courage and the  confidence that he lacked; and she it was who interpreted his work to  the world.    Heine characterized Meyerbeer's \"Les Huguenots\" as \"like a Gothic  cathedral whose heaven-soaring spire and colossal cupolas seem to have  been planted there by the sure hand of a giant; whereas the innumerable  features, the rosettes and arabesques that are spread over it everywhere  like a lacework of stone, witness to the indefatigable patience of a  dwarf.\"    Very different is the work of Robert Schumann, who, like his master  Schubert, knew little of the architectonics of the Art Divine. But  Schubert seems to have been the first to give us the \"lyric cry\"--the  prayer of a heart bowed down, or the ecstasy of a soul enrapt.    Schumann built on Schubert. Music was to Schumann the expression of an  emotion. He saw in pictures, then he told in tones, what his inward eye  beheld. He even went so far as to give the names of persons, their  peculiarities and experiences on the keyboard. It is needless to say  that the tension of mind in such experiments is apt to reach the  breaking strain. We are under bonds for the moderate use of every  faculty, and he who misuses any of God's gifts may not hope to go  unscathed.    The exquisite quality of Robert Schumann's imagination served to make  him shun the society of vulgar people. The inability to grasp things  intuitively harassed him, and he acquired a habit of keeping silence,  except with the elect. He lived within himself, unless Clara were by,  and then he leaned on her.    And what a strong, brave and beautiful soul she was! In a sense she  sacrificed her own career for the man she loved. And by giving all,"]]]
