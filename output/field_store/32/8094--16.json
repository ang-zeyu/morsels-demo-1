The nodding of the head to a negative question, such  as \"Are you not well?\" signifies assent to the negative, that is,  that he is not well, and so vice-versa with the shaking of the head.                CHAPTER V    Community, Clan, and Village Systems and Chieftainship      Communities, Clans, and Villages.    The native populations of the Mafulu area are scattered about in  small groups or clusters of villages or hamlets; and, as each cluster  of villages is for many purposes a composite and connected whole,  I propose to call such a cluster a \"community.\" Friendships, based  on proximity and frequent intercourse and intermarriage, doubtless  arise between neighbouring communities, but otherwise there does  not appear to be any idea in the minds of the people of any general  relationship or common interest between these various communities of  the area. Each community regards the members of every other community  within the area as outsiders, just as much so as are, say, the Ambo  people to the north and the Kuni people to the west. If a community,  or group of communities together, were the subject of an attack from  either Ambo or Kuni natives, each of these being people whose language  is different--as regards the Kuni utterly different--from that of the  Mafulu, there would apparently be no thought of other Mafulu-speaking  communities, as such, coming to assist in repelling the attack. Hence  in dealing with the question of inter-village relationship, I have  to fix my mind mainly upon the community and its constituent parts.    Concerning the situation as between one community and another,  as they regard themselves as quite distinct and unrelated, the only  question which seems to arise is that of the ownership of, and rights  over, the intervening bush and other land. The boundaries between  what is regarded as the preserve of one community, within which its  members may hunt and fish, clear for garden purposes, cut timber, and  collect fruit, and that of an adjoining community are perfectly well  known. The longitudinal boundaries along the valleys are almost always  the rivers and streams, which form good boundary marks; but those  across the hills and ridges from stream to stream are, I was told,  equally defined in the minds of the natives, though no artificial  boundary marks are visible. These boundaries are mutually respected,  and trouble and fighting over boundary and trespass questions are,  I was told, practically unknown, the people in this respect differing  from those of Mekeo.    A community comprises several villages, the number of which may vary  from, say, two to eight. But the relationship between all the villages  is not identical. There is a clan system, and there is generally more  than one clan in a community. Often there are three or more of such  clans. Each clan, however, has its own villages, or sometimes one  village only, within the community, and two clans are never found  represented in any one village, [56] or any one clan spread over two  or more communities.    Fig. 3 is a diagrammatic illustration of a typical Mafulu community,  the circles representing villages of one clan, the squares those of  another clan, and the triangle being the sole village of a third clan.    I have said that the entire community is for many purposes a composite  whole. In many matters they act together as a community. This is  especially so as regards the big feast, which I shall describe  hereafter. It is so also to a large extent in some other ceremonies  and in the organisation of hunting and fishing parties and sometimes  in fighting. And the community as a whole has its boundaries, within  which are the general community rights of hunting, fishing, etc.,  as above stated.    But the relationship between a group of villages of any one clan  within the community is of a much closer and more intimate character  than is that of the community as a whole. These villages of one  clan have a common _amidi_ or chief, a common _emone_ or clubhouse,  and a practice of mutual support and help in fighting for redress  of injury to one or more of the individual members; and there is a  special social relationship between their members, and in particular  clan exogamy prevails with them, marriages between people of the same  clan, even though in different villages, being reprobated almost as  much as are marriages between people of the same village.    The Mafulu word for village is _emi_, but there are no words  signifying the idea of a community of villages and that of a group  of villages belonging to the same clan within that community. As  regards the latter there is the word _imbele_, but this word is used  to express the intimate social relationship existing between the  members of a clan, and not to express the idea of an actual group of  villages. Communities and villages have geographical names. The name  adopted for a community will probably be the name of some adjoining  river or ridge. That adopted for a village will probably be the name  of the exact crest or spot on which it is placed, the minuteness of  the geographical nomenclature here being remarkable. Clan-groups of  villages, forming part of a community, have, as such, no geographical  names, but a member of one such group will distinguish himself from  those of another group by saying that he is a man of----, giving the  name of the chief of the clan occupying the group.    I was assured that, when there are two or more villages of a clan with  a common chief and emone, they have originally been one village which  has split up, an event which undoubtedly does in fact take place;  while on the other hand the several villages of a clan, presumably  the outcome of a previous splitting-up of a single village, will  sometimes amalgamate together into one village, which thus becomes  the only village of the clan. But two villages of different clans  could never amalgamate in this way. The following are examples of  these village changes:--    Near to the Mafulu Mission station is a community called Sivu, which  includes seven villages occupied by three clans, as follows [57]:--          1. Voitele      Belonging to a clan whose chief, Jaria, lives                      at Amalala, where the clan _emone_ is.      2. Amalala      3. Kodo-Malabe      4. Motaligo      5. Malala       Belonging to a clan whose chief, Gito-iola, lived                      at Malala, where the clan _emone_ is. (He has                      recently retired in favour of his eldest son,                      Anum' Iva, who is the present chief, and also lives                      there.)      6. Gelva      7. Seluku       Being the only village of a clan whose chief, Baiva,                      has recently died. His eldest son, who has succeeded                      him, is an infant. There is no regency.      Also near the Mission station is a community called Alo, which includes  four villages occupied by two clans, as follows:--          1. Asida        Belonging to a clan whose chief, Amo-Kau, lives                      at Asida, where the _emone_ is.      2. Kotsi      3. Ingomaunda      4. Uvande       Being the only village of a clan whose chief                      is Iu-Baibe.      Referring to these villages, in the year 1899 the clan now occupying  the four villages Voitele, Amalala, Kodo-Malabe and Motaligo had only  a single village, Kaidiabe, the clan's chief being the above-mentioned  Jaria. Then there was a Government punitive expedition, following  the attack of the natives upon Monseigneur de Boismenu (the present  Bishop of the Mission of the Sacred Heart in British New Guinea) and  his friends, who were making their first exploration of the district,  in which expedition a number of natives, including the brother of  the chief, were killed. After that the village was abandoned, and  the three villages of Voitele, Amalala and Motaligo arose in its  place. Subsequently after a big feast, which was held at Amalala in  the year 1909, that village put out an offshoot, which is the present  village of Kodo-Malabe. Also in the year 1909 the village of Uvande  was represented by seven villages, all belonging to one clan under  the chieftainship of Iu-Baibe, the names of which were Ipolo, Olona,  Isisibei, Valamenga, Amada, Angasabe and Amambu; but after the feast  above mentioned the people of that clan all abandoned their villages,  and joined together in forming the present village of Uvande.    The chief, that is the true chief, of a clan has his house in one of  the villages of the clan, and if, as sometimes occurs, he has houses  in two or more of these villages, there is one village in which is  what is regarded as his usual residence, and this is the village in  which is the _emone_ of the clan.    As regards the relative predominance of the various clans of a  community and their respective chiefs in matters affecting the whole  community (_e.g.,_ the arranging and holding of a big feast), there  is no rule or system. The predominance will probably, unless there  be a great disparity in the actual size or importance of the clans,  and perhaps even to a certain extent notwithstanding such a disparity,  fall to the clan whose chief by his superior ability or courage or  force of character, or perhaps capacity for palavering, has succeeded  in securing for himself a predominating influence in the community.    The word _imbele_ and certain other words are used to designate the  closeness or otherwise of the connection between individuals. _Imbele_  signifies the close connection which exists between members of one  clan, and a man will say of another member of his clan that he is  his _imbele_. The word _bilage_ signifies a community connection,  which is recognised as being not so close as a clan connection;  and a man will say of another, who is outside his own clan, but is a  member of his own community, that he is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17928"],[0,"The Influence of India and Persia on the Poetry of Germany (#15)"],[1," pankajanyeva_ \"the moon wakes only the night lotuses, the sun  only the day lotuses.\"[193] It is the former kind, the nymphaea  esculenta, of which Heine sings, and his conception of the moon as its  lover is distinctively Indic and constantly recurring in Sanskrit  literature. Thus at the beginning of the first book of the _Hitopadesa_  the moon is called the lordly bridegroom of the lotuses.[194]    The splendor of an Indic landscape haunts the imagination of the poet.  On the wings of song he will carry his love to the banks of the Ganges  (vol. i. p. 98), to that moonlit garden where the lotus-flowers await  their sister, where the violets peep at the stars, the roses whisper  their perfumed tales into each other's ears and the gazelles listen,  while the waves of the sacred river make sweet music. And again in a  series of sonnets addressed to Friederike (_Neue Ged._ vol. ii. p. 65)  he invites her to come with him to India, to its palm-trees, its  ambra-blossoms and lotus-flowers, to see the gazelles leaping on the  banks of the Ganges, and the peacocks displaying their gaudy plumage, to  hear Kokila singing his impassioned lay. He sees Kama in the features of  his beloved, and Vasanta hovering on her lips; her smile moves the  Gandharvas in their golden, sunny halls to song.           *       *       *       *       *    Allusions to episodes from Sanskrit literature are not infrequent in  Heine's writings. The famous struggle between King Visvamitra with the  sage Vasistha for example is mockingly referred to in two stanzas (vol.  i. p. 146).[195] His own efforts to win the favor of a certain Emma  (_Neue Ged._ ii. 54) the poet likens to the great act of penance by  which King Bhagiratha brought down the Ganges from heaven.[196]           *       *       *       *       *    Heine's prose-writings also furnish abundant proofs of his interest in  and acquaintance with Sanskrit literature. In the opening chapters of  the _Buch Le Grand_ (c. 4, vol. v. p. 114) he brings before us another  vision of tropical Indic splendor. In his sketches from Italy (_Reiseb._  ii. vol. vi. p. 137) he draws a parallel between the priesthood of Italy  and that of India, which is anything but flattering to either. It is  also not correct; he notices, to be sure, that in the Sanskrit drama (of  which he knows only _Sakuntala_ and _Mrcchakatika_) the role of buffoon  is assigned invariably to a Brahman, but he is ignorant of the origin of  this singular custom.[197] In his essay on the Romantic School, when  speaking of Goethe's godlike repose, he introduces by way of  illustration the well-known episode from the Nala-story where Damayanti  distinguishes her lover from the gods who had assumed his form by the  blinking of his eyes (vol. ix. p. 52). In the same essay (ibid. pp. 49,  50), he bestows enthusiastic praise on Goethe's _Divan_, and this brings  us to the question of Persian influence upon Heine.           *       *       *       *       *    Starting as he did on his literary career at the time when Goethe's  _Divan_ and Rueckert's _Oestliche Rosen_ had inaugurated the Hafizian  movement in German literature, it would have been strange if he had  remained entirely outside of the sphere of its influence. As a matter of  fact, he took some interest in Persian poetry almost from the outset of  his poetical activity, as his letters clearly show. As early as 1821, he  mentions Sa'di with the epithet _herrlich_, calls him the Persian Goethe  and cites one of his couplets (_Gul._ ii. 48, _qit'ah_; K.S. p. 122) in  the version of Herder.[198] In April, 1823, he writes from Berlin that  during the preceding winter he has studied the non-Semitic part of  Asia,[199] and the following year in a letter to Moser[200] he speaks of  Persian as \"die suesse, rosige, leuchtende Bulbulsprache,\" and goes on to  imagine himself a Persian poet in exile among Germans. \"O Firdusi! O  Ischami! (sic for Jami) O Saadi! Wie elend ist euer Bruder! Ach wie  sehne ich mich nach den Rosen von Schiras.\" Such a rose he calls in one  of his _Nordsee_-poems \"die Hafisbesungene Nachtigallbraut\" (\"Im Hafen,\"  vol. i. p. 218).    Yet, judging from the familiar epigrams of Immermann, which Heine cites  at the end of _Norderney_ (_Reiseb._ i. vol. v. p. 101) as expressive of  his own sentiments, he seems to have held but a poor opinion of the  West-Eastern poetry that followed in the wake of Goethe's _Divan_. He  certainly never attempted anything like an imitation of this poetry, and  Oriental form appealed to him even less. In the famous, or rather  infamous, passage of the _Reisebilder_ (vol. vi. pp. 125-149), where he  makes his savage attack on Platen, he ridicules that poet's _Ghaselen_  and speaks derisively of their formal technique as \"schaukelnde  Balancierkuenste\" (ibid. p. 136). It is probable, however, that he judged  the _gazal_ form not so much on its own merits as on the demerits of his  adversary. It is certain at any rate that he has nowhere made use of  this form of versification.    Persian influence is not noticeable in his earlier poems;[201] his _Buch  der Lieder_ shows no distinctive traces of it. His later poems, _Neue  Gedichte_ (1844) and _Romanzero_ (1851), on the other hand, show it  unmistakably. The Persian image of the rose and the nightingale is of  frequent occurrence. In a poem on Spring (_Neue Ged._ vol. ii. p. 26) we  read:        Und mir selbst ist dann, als wuerd' ich      Eine Nachtigall und saenge      Diesen Rosen meine Liebe,      Traeumend sing' ich Wunderklaenge--.    The image recurs repeatedly in the _Neue Gedichte_, e.g. _Neuer  Fruehling_, Nos. 7, 9, 11, 20, 26; _Verschiedene_, No. 7, and in  _Romanzero_ (vol. iii.), pp. 42, 178, 253. Even in the prose-writings it  is found, e.g. _Florentinische Naechte_ (vol. iii. p. 43), _Gedanken und  Einfaelle_ (vol. xii. 309).    Again, when Heine speaks of pearls that are pierced and strung on a  silken thread (\"Kluge Sterne,\" _Neue Ged._ vol. ii. p. 106), he is  intensely Persian; still more so when he calls Jehuda ben Halevy's  verses (_Romanz._ vol. iii. p. 136):        Perlenthraenen, die, verbunden      Durch des Reimes goldnen Faden,      Aus der Dichtkunst gueldnen Schmiede      Als ein Lied hervorgegangen.    The Persian fancy of the moth and candle-flame seems to have been in his  mind when he wrote (\"Die Libelle,\" vol. ii. p. 288):        Knisternd verzehren die Flammen der Kerzen      Die Kaefer und ihre liebenden Herzen....    Still another Persian idea, familiar to us from a preceding chapter, is  the peacock ashamed of his ugly feet (\"Unvolkommenheit,\" _Romanz._ vol.  iii. p. 103).           *       *       *       *       *    The Persian manner is even employed, and very cleverly, for humorous  effect, for instance, in the poem \"Jehuda ben Halevy,\" cited before. In  this Heine asks Hitzig for the etymology of the name Schlemihl, but  meets with nothing but evasive replies until:        Endlich alle Knoepfe rissen      An der Hose der Geduld,    and the poet begins to swear so profanely that the pious Hitzig  surrenders unconditionally and hastens to supply the desired  information. This image of the \"trousers of patience\" reminds us  strikingly of such Persian phrases as [Arabic] \"the cowl of  meditation\" (_Gul._ ed. Platts, p. 4), [Arabic] \"the carpet of desire\"  (ib. p. 113), etc., which are a particular ornament of the highly  artificial rhymed prose, employed in works like the _Gulistan_ and  _Baharistan_. In the latter, for instance, we read of a youth whose  mental equilibrium had been impaired by the charms of a handsome girl:  [Arabic] \"he tore the garment of prudence and put on the rags of  disgrace.\"[202]    The description of a countess in words like those which Heine puts into  the mouth of a Berlin chamber-musician: \"Cypressenwuchs,  Hyacinthenlocken, der Mund ist Ros' und Nachtigall zu gleicher Zeit,\" ...  (_Briefe aus Berlin_. No. 3, vol. v. p. 205) furnishes another instance  in point.    And lastly, we must mention one of the best known of Heine's poems, the  trilogy \"Der Dichter Firdusi,\" the subject of which is the famous legend  of Mahmud's ingratitude to Persia's greatest singer and his tardy  repentance. We may add that scholars are not inclined to accept this  legend as historical in all its parts; certainly not in its artistic and  effective ending. This, of course, has nothing to do with the literary  merit of the poem, which is deservedly ranked as one of Heine's happiest  efforts.[203]           *       *       *       *       *    After all, however, it is clear that Heine is in no sense an  orientalizing poet or a follower of the Hafizian tendency which became  the vogue under the influence of Goethe, Rueckert and Platen. With him  the Oriental element never was more than an incidental feature, strictly  subordinated to his own poetic individuality, and never dominating or  effacing it, as is the case with most of the professedly \"Persian\"  singers,--those \"Perser von dem Main, der Elbe, von der Isar, von der  Pleisse\"--who thought, as has justly been remarked, that they had  penetrated into the Persian spirit by merely mentioning _guls_ and  _bulbuls_. Heine had no use for such trivial superficiality. The singer  of the \"Loreley\" sang as he felt, and in spite of so many apparently  un-German sentiments in his writings he had a right to say (_Die  Heimkehr_, vol. i. p. 131):        Ich bin ein deutscher Dichter,      Bekannt im deutschen Land;      Nennt man die besten Namen,      So wird auch der meine genannt.
