What would you have done?\"    Rattray said nothing. Santos shrugged as he lit a fresh cigarette. The  captain went on with his supper.    \"Ashamed to say!\" cried Eva Denison. \"So you have some shame left still!  Well, I will tell you. You would have murdered him, as you murdered all  the rest; you would have killed him in cold blood, as I wish and pray  that you would kill me!\"    The young fellow faced her, white to the lips. \"You have no right to  say that, Miss Denison!\" he cried. \"I may be bad, but, as I am ready to  answer for my sins, the crime of murder is not among them.\"    Well, it is still some satisfaction to remember that my love never  punished me with such a look as was the young squire's reward for this  protestation. The curl of the pink nostrils, the parting of the proud  lips, the gleam of the sound white teeth, before a word was spoken,  were more than I, for one, could have borne. For I did not see the grief  underlying the scorn, but actually found it in my heart to pity this  poor devil of a Rattray: so humbly fell those fine eyes of his, so like  a dog did he stand, waiting to be whipped.    \"Yes; you are very innocent!\" she began at last, so softly that I could  scarcely hear. \"You have not committed murder, so you say; let it stand  to your credit by all means. You have no blood upon your hands; you say  so; that is enough. No! you are comparatively innocent, I admit. All  you have done is to make murder easy for others; to get others to do the  dirty work, and then shelter them and share the gain; all you need have  on your conscience is every life that was lost with the Lady Jermyn, and  every soul that lost itself in losing them. You call that innocence?  Then give me honest guilt! Give me the man who set fire to the ship, and  who sits there eating his supper; he is more of a man than you. Give me  the wretch who has beaten men to death before my eyes; there's something  great about a monster like that, there's something to loathe. His  assistant is only little--mean--despicable!\" Loud and hurried in its  wrath, low and deliberate in its contempt, all this was uttered with a  furious and abnormal eloquence, which would have struck me, loving her,  to the ground. On Rattray it had a different effect. His head lifted as  she heaped abuse upon it, until he met her flashing eye with that of a  man very thankful to take his deserts and something more; and to mine he  was least despicable when that last word left her lips. When he saw that  it was her last, he took her candle (she had put it down on the ancient  settle against the door), and presented it to her with another bow. And  so without a word he led her to the door, opened it, and bowed yet lower  as she swept out, but still without a tinge of mockery in the obeisance.    He was closing the door after her when Joaquin Santos reached it.    \"Diablo!\" cried he. \"Why let her go? We have not done with her.\"    \"That doesn't matter; she is done with us,\" was the stern reply.    \"It does matter,\" retorted Santos; \"what is more, she is my  step-daughter, and back she shall come!\"    \"She is also my visitor, and I'm damned if you're going to make her!\"    An instant Santos stood, his back to me, his fingers working, his neck  brown with blood; then his coat went into creases across the shoulders,  and he was shrugging still as he turned away.    \"Your veesitor!\" said he. \"Your veesitor! Your veesitor!\"    Harris laughed outright as he raised his glass; the hot young squire  had him by the collar, and the wine was spilling on the cloth, as I rose  very cautiously and crept back to the path.    \"When rogues fall out!\" I was thinking to myself. \"I shall save her  yet--I shall save my darling!\"    Already I was accustomed to the thought that she still lived, and to the  big heart she had set beating in my feeble frame; already the continued  existence of these villains, with the first dim inkling of their  villainy, was ceasing to be a novelty in a brain now quickened and  prehensile beyond belief. And yet--but a few minutes had I knelt at the  window--but a few more was it since Rattray and I had shaken hands!    Not his visitor; his prisoner, without a doubt; but alive! alive! and,  neither guest nor prisoner for many hours more. O my love! O my heart's  delight! Now I knew why I was spared; to save her; to snatch her from  these rascals; to cherish and protect her evermore!    All the past shone clear behind me; the dark was lightness and the  crooked straight. All the future lay clear ahead it presented no  difficulties yet; a mad, ecstatic confidence was mine for the wildest,  happiest moments of my life.    I stood upright in the darkness. I saw her light!    It was ascending the tower at the building's end; now in this window it  glimmered, now in the one above. At last it was steady, high up near the  stars, and I stole below.    \"Eva! Eva!\"    There was no answer. Low as it was, my voice was alarming; it cooled  and cautioned me. I sought little stones. I crept back to throw them.  Ah God! her form eclipsed that lighted slit in the gray stone tower. I  heard her weeping high above me at her window.    \"Eva! Eva!\"    There was a pause, and then a little cry of gladness.    \"Is it Mr. Cole?\" came in an eager whisper through her tears.    \"Yes! yes! I was outside the window. I heard everything.\"    \"They will hear you!\" she cried softly, in a steadier voice.    \"No-listen!\" They were quarrelling. Rattray's voice was loud and angry.  \"They cannot hear,\" I continued, in more cautious tones; \"they think  I'm in bed and asleep half-a-mile away. Oh, thank God! I'll get you away  from them; trust me, my love, my darling!\"    In my madness I knew not what I said; it was my wild heart speaking.  Some moments passed before she replied.    \"Will you promise to do nothing I ask you not to do?\"    \"Of course.\"    \"My life might answer for it--\"    \"I promise--I promise.\"    \"Then wait--hide--watch my light. When you see it back in the window,  watch with all your eyes! I am going to write and then throw it out. Not  another syllable!\"    She was gone; there was a long yellow slit in the masonry once more; her  light burnt faint and far within.    I retreated among some bushes and kept watch.    The moon was skimming beneath the surface of a sea of clouds: now the  black billows had silver crests: now an incandescent buoy bobbed among  them. O for enough light, and no more!    In the hall the high voices were more subdued. I heard the captain's  tipsy laugh. My eyes fastened themselves upon that faint and lofty  light, and on my heels I crouched among the bushes.    The flame moved, flickered, and shone small but brilliant on the very  sill. I ran forward on tip-toe. A white flake fluttered to my feet. I  secured it and waited for one word; none came; but the window was softly  shut.    I stood in doubt, the treacherous moonlight all over me now, and once  more the window opened.    \"Go quickly!\"    And again it was shut; next moment I was stealing close by the spot  where I had knelt. I saw within once more.    Harris nodded in his chair. The nigger had disappeared. Rattray was  lighting a candle, and the Portuguese holding out his hand for the  match.    \"Did you lock the gate, senhor?\" asked Santos.    \"No; but I will now.\"    As I opened it I heard a door open within. I could hardly let the latch  down again for the sudden trembling of my fingers. The key turned behind  me ere I had twenty yards' start.    Thank God there was light enough now! I followed the beck. I found  my way. I stood in the open valley, between the oak-plantation and my  desolate cottage, and I kissed my tiny, twisted note again and again in  a paroxysm of passion and of insensate joy. Then I unfolded it and held  it to my eyes in the keen October moonshine.          CHAPTER XII. MY LADY'S BIDDING      Scribbled in sore haste, by a very tremulous little hand, with a pencil,  on the flyleaf of some book, my darling's message is still difficult to  read; it was doubly so in the moonlight, five-and-forty autumns ago. My  eyesight, however, was then perhaps the soundest thing about me, and in  a little I had deciphered enough to guess correctly (as it proved) at  the whole:--      \"You say you heard everything just now, and there is no time for further  explanations. I am in the hands of villains, but not ill-treated, though  they are one as bad as the other. You will not find it easy to rescue  me. I don't see how it is to be done. You have promised not to do  anything I ask you not to do, and I implore you not to tell a soul until  you have seen me again and heard more. You might just as well kill me as  come back now with help.    \"You see you know nothing, though I told them you knew all. And so you  shall as soon as I can see you for five minutes face to face. In the  meantime do nothing--know nothing when you see Mr. Rattray--unless you  wish to be my death.    \"It would have been possible last night, and it may be again to-morrow  night. They all go out every night when they can, except Jose, who is  left in charge. They are out from nine or ten till two or three; if they  are out to-morrow night my candle will be close to the window as I shall  put it when I have finished this. You can see my window from over the  wall. If the light is in front you must climb the wall, for they will  leave the gate locked. I shall see you and will bribe Jose to let me  out for a turn. He has done it before for a bottle of wine. I can manage  him. Can I trust to you? If you break your promise--but you will not?  One of them would as soon kill me as smoke a cigarette, and the rest are  under his thumb. I dare not write more. But my life is in your hands.    \"EVA DENISON.\"      \"Oh! beware of the woman Braithwaite; she is about the worst of the  gang.\"    I could have burst out crying in my bitter discomfiture,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17034"],[0,"English Fairy Tales (#15)"],[1,".\"    Then the lad said, \"It's no use of thee, thou pair of legs, standing  alone at the window, as thou hast no eye to see with, so go join thy  brother\"; and he cast the lower part of the giant after the top part.  Now when the bogles had gotten all the giant they were quiet.    Next night the lad went to sleep in the house again, and this time a  second giant came in at the door, and as he came in the lad cut him in  twain; but the legs walked on to the fire and went straight up the  chimney.    \"Go, get thee after thy legs,\" said the lad to the head, and he cast the  other half of the giant up the chimney.    Now the third night nothing happened, so the lad got into bed; but  before he went to sleep he heard the bogles striving under the bed, and  he wondered what they were at. So he peeped, and saw that they had the  ball there, and were playing with it, casting it to and fro.    Now after a time one of them thrust his leg out from under the bed, and  quick as anything the lad brings his sword down, and cuts it off. Then  another bogle thrust his arm out at t'other side of the bed, and in a  twinkling the lad cuts that off too. So it went on, till at last he had  maimed them all, and they all went off, crying and wailing, and forgot  the ball! Then the lad got out of bed, found the ball, and went off at  once to seek his true love.    [Illustration: He heard the bogles striving under the bed]    Now the lass had been taken to York to be hanged; she was brought out on  the scaffold, and the hangman said, \"Now, lass, thou must hang by the  neck till thou be'st dead.\" But she cried out:      \"Stop, stop, I think I see my mother coming!     O mother, hast thou brought my golden ball        And come to set me free?\"    And the mother answered:      \"I've neither brought thy golden ball       Nor come to set thee free,     But I have come to see thee hung       Upon this gallows-tree.\"    Then the hangman said, \"Now, lass, say thy prayers for thou must die.\"  But she said:      \"Stop, stop, I think I see my father coming!     O father, hast thou brought my golden ball        And come to set me free?\"    And the father answered:      \"I've neither brought thy golden ball       Nor come to set thee free,     But I have come to see thee hung       Upon this gallows-tree.\"    Then the hangman said, \"Hast thee done thy prayers? Now, lass, put thy  head into the noose.\"    But she answered, \"Stop, stop, I think I see my brother coming!\" And  again she sang her little verse, and the brother sang back the same  words. And so with her sister, her uncle, her aunt, and her cousin. But  they all said the same:      \"I've neither brought thy golden ball       Nor come to set thee free,     But I have come to see thee hung       Upon this gallows-tree.\"    Then the hangman said, \"I will stop no longer, thou'rt making game of  me. Thou must be hung at once.\"    But now, at long last, she saw her sweetheart coming through the crowd,  so she cried to him:      \"Stop, stop, I see my sweetheart coming!     Sweetheart, hast thou brought my golden ball        And come to set me free?\"    Then her sweetheart held up her golden ball and cried:      \"Aye, I have brought to thee thy golden ball       And come to set thee free;     I have not come to see thee hung       Upon this gallows-tree.\"    So he took her home, then and there, and they lived happy ever after.          THE TWO SISTERS      Once upon a time there were two sisters who were as like each other as  two peas in a pod; but one was good, and the other was bad-tempered. Now  their father had no work, so the girls began to think of going to  service.    \"I will go first and see what I can make of it,\" said the younger  sister, ever so cheerfully, \"then you, sis, can follow if I have good  luck.\"    So she packed up a bundle, said good-bye, and started to find a place;  but no one in the town wanted a girl, and she went farther afield into  the country. And as she journeyed she came upon an oven in which a lot  of loaves were baking. Now as she passed, the loaves cried out with one  voice:    \"Little girl! Little girl! Take us out! Please take us out! We have been  baking for seven years, and no one has come to take us out. Do take us  out or we shall soon be burnt!\"    Then, being a kind, obliging little girl, she stopped, put down her  bundle, took out the bread, and went on her way saying:    \"You will be more comfortable now.\"    After a time she came to a cow lowing beside an empty pail, and the cow  said to her:    \"Little girl! Little girl! Milk me! Please milk me! Seven years have I  been waiting, but no one has come to milk me!\"    So the kind girl stopped, put down her bundle, milked the cow into the  pail, and went on her way saying:    \"Now you will be more comfortable.\"    By and by she came to an apple tree so laden with fruit that its  branches were nigh to break, and the apple tree called to her:    \"Little girl! Little girl! Please shake my branches. The fruit is so  heavy I can't stand straight!\"    Then the kind girl stopped, put down her bundle, and shook the branches  so that the apples fell off, and the tree could stand straight. Then she  went on her way saying:    \"You will be more comfortable now.\"    So she journeyed on till she came to a house where an old witch-woman  lived. Now this witch-woman wanted a servant-maid, and promised good  wages. Therefore the girl agreed to stop with her and try how she liked  service. She had to sweep the floor, keep the house clean and tidy, the  fire bright and cheery. But there was one thing the witch-woman said she  must never do; and that was look up the chimney!    [Illustration: \"Tree of mine! O Tree of mine! Have you seen my naughty  little maid?\"]    \"If you do,\" said the witch-woman, \"something will fall down on you, and  you will come to a bad end.\" Well! the girl swept, and dusted, and  made up the fire; but ne'er a penny of wages did she see. Now the girl  wanted to go home as she did not like witch-service; for the witch used  to have boiled babies for supper, and bury the bones under some stones  in the garden. But she did not like to go home penniless; so she stayed  on, sweeping, and dusting, and doing her work, just as if she was  pleased. Then one day, as she was sweeping up the hearth, down tumbled  some soot, and, without remembering she was forbidden to look up the  chimney, she looked up to see where the soot came from. And, lo and  behold! a big bag of gold fell plump into her lap.    Now the witch happened to be out on one of her witch errands; so the  girl thought it a fine opportunity to be off home.    So she kilted up her petticoats and started to run home; but she had  only gone a little way when she heard the witch-woman coming after her  on her broomstick. Now the apple tree she had helped to stand straight  happened to be quite close; so she ran to it and cried:      \"Apple tree! Apple tree, hide me     So the old witch can't find me,     For if she does she'll pick my bones,     And bury me under the garden stones.\"    Then the apple tree said, \"Of course I will. You helped me to stand  straight, and one good turn deserves another.\"    So the apple tree hid her finely in its green branches; and when the  witch flew past saying:      \"Tree of mine! O Tree of mine!     Have you seen my naughty little maid     With a willy willy wag and a great big bag,     She's stolen my money--all I had?\"    The apple tree answered:      \"No, mother dear,     Not for seven year!\"    So the witch flew on the wrong way, and the girl got down, thanked the  tree politely, and started again. But just as she got to where the cow  was standing beside the pail, she heard the witch coming again, so she  ran to the cow and cried:      \"Cow! Cow, please hide me     So the witch can't find me;     If she does she'll pick my bones,     And bury me under the garden stones!\"    \"Certainly I will,\" answered the cow. \"Didn't you milk me and make me  comfortable? Hide yourself behind me and you'll be quite safe.\"    And when the witch flew by and called to the cow:      \"O Cow of mine! Cow of mine!     Have you seen my naughty little maid     With a willy willy wag and a great big bag,     Who stole my money--all that I had?\"    She just said politely:      \"No, mother dear,     Not for seven year!\"    Then the old witch went on in the wrong direction, and the girl started  afresh on her way home; but just as she got to where the oven stood, she  heard that horrid old witch coming behind her again; so she ran as fast  as she could to the oven and cried:      \"O Oven! Oven! hide me     So as the witch can't find me,     For if she does she'll pick my bones,     And bury them under the garden stones.\"    Then the oven said, \"I am afraid there is no room for you, as another  batch of bread is baking; but there is the baker--ask him.\"    So she asked the baker, and he said, \"Of course I will. You saved my  last batch from being burnt; so run into the bakehouse, you will be  quite safe there, and I will settle the witch for you.\"    So she hid in the bakehouse, only just in time, for there was the old  witch calling angrily:      \"O Man of mine! Man of mine!     Have you seen my naughty little maid     With a willy willy wag and a great big bag,     Who's stole my money--all I had?\"    Then the baker replied, \"Look in the oven. She may be there.\"    And the witch alighted from her broomstick and peered into the oven: but  she could see no one.    \"Creep in and look in the farthest corner,\" said the baker slyly, and  the witch crept in, when----                               Bang!----    he shut the door in her face, and there she was roasting. And when she  came out with the bread she was all crisp and brown, and had to go home  as best she could and put cold cream all over her!    But the kind, obliging little girl got safe home with her bag of money.    Now the ill-tempered elder sister was very jealous of this good"]]]
