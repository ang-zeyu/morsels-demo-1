And the  mail will be in, about noon--you'll want to wait for that.\"    She was standing just within the screen door, frankly watching him as  he came past the house with the horses, and she came out and halted him  when she spied the top of the pack.    \"You'd better leave those things here,\" she advised him eagerly. \"I'll  put them in the sitting-room by the piano. My goodness, you must be a  whole orchestra! If you can play, maybe you and I can furnish the music  for the dance, and save Uncle Dave hiring the Saunders boys. Anyway, we  can play together, and have real good times.\"    Bud had an odd feeling that Honey was talking one thing with her lips,  and thinking an entirely different set of thoughts. He eyed her covertly  while he untied the cases, and he could have sworn that he saw her  signal someone behind the lace curtains of the nearest window. He  glanced carelessly that way, but the curtains were motionless. Honey was  holding out her hands for the guitar and the mandolin when he turned, so  Bud surrendered them and went on to the corrals.    He did not return to the house. An old man was pottering around a  machine shed that stood backed against a thick fringe of brush, and when  Bud rode by he left his work and came after him, taking short steps and  walking with his back bent stiffly forward and his hands swinging limply  at his sides.    He had a long black beard streaked with gray, and sharp blue eyes set  deep under tufted white eyebrows. He seemed a friendly old man whose  interest in life remained keen as in his youth, despite the feebleness  of his body. He showed Bud where to turn the horses, and went to work  on the pack rope, his crooked old fingers moving with the sureness of  lifelong habit. He was eager to know all the news that Bud could tell  him, and when he discovered that Bud had just left the Muleshoe, and  that he had been fired because of a fight with Dirk Tracy, the old  fellow cackled gleefully,    \"Well, now, I guess you just about had yore hands full, young man,\" he  commented shrewdly. \"Dirk ain't so easy to lick.\"    Bud immediately wanted to know why it was taken for granted that he had  whipped Dirk, and grandpa chortled again. \"Now if you hadn't of licked  Dirk, you wouldn't of got fired,\" he retorted, and proceeded to relate  a good deal of harmless gossip which seemed to bear out the statement.  Dirk Tracy, according to grandpa, was the real boss of the Muleshoe, and  Bart was merely a figure-head.    All of this did not matter to Bud, but grandpa was garrulous. A good  deal of information Bud received while the two attended to the horses  and loitered at the corral gate.    Grandpa admired Smoky, and looked him over carefully, with those  caressing smoothings of mane and forelock which betray the lover of good  horseflesh.    \"I reckon he's purty fast,\" he said, peering shrewdly into Bud's face.  \"The boys has been talking about pulling off some horse races here next  Sunday--we got a good, straight, hard-packed creek-bed up here a piece  that has been cleaned of rocks fer a mile track, and they're goin' to  run a horse er two. Most generally they do, on Sunday, if work's slack.  You might git in on it, if you're around in these parts.\" He pushed his  back straight with his palms, turned his head sidewise and squinted at  Smoky through half-closed lids while he fumbled for cigarette material.    \"I dunno but what I might be willin' to put up a few dollars on that  horse myself,\" he observed, \"if you say he kin run. You wouldn't go an'  lie to an old feller like me, would yuh, son?\"    Bud offered him the cigarette he had just rolled. \"No, I won't lie to  you, dad,\" he grinned. \"You know horses too well.\"    \"Well, but kin he run? I want yore word on it.\"    \"Well-yes, he's always been able to turn a cow,\" Bud admitted  cautiously.    \"Ever run him fer money?\" The old man began teetering from his toes to  his heels, and to hitch his shoulders forward and back.    \"Well, no, not for money. I've run him once or twice for fun, just  trying to beat some of the boys to camp, maybe.\"    \"Sho! That's no way to do! No way at all!\" The old man spat angrily  into the dust of the corral. Then he thought of something. \"Did yuh BEAT  'em?\" he demanded sharply.    \"Why, sure, I beat them!\" Bud looked at him surprised, seemed about to  say more, and let the statement stand unqualified.    Grandpa stared at him for a minute, his blue eyes blinking with some  secret excitement. \"Young feller,\" he began abruptly, \"lemme tell yuh  something. Yuh never want to do a thing like that agin. If you got a  horse that can outrun the other feller's horse, figure to make him bring  yuh in something--if it ain't no more'n a quarter! Make him BRING yuh a  little something. That's the way to do with everything yuh turn a hand  to; make it bring yuh in something! It ain't what goes out that'll do  yuh any good--it's what comes in. You mind that. If you let a horse run  agin' another feller's horse, bet on him to come in ahead--and then,\"  he cried fiercely, pounding one fist into the other palm, \"by Christmas,  make 'im come in ahead!\" His voice cracked and went flat with emotion.    He stopped suddenly and let his arms fall slack, his shoulders sag  forward. He waggled his head and muttered into his beard, and glanced at  Bud with a crafty look.    \"If I'da took that to m'self, I wouldn't be chorin' around here now for  my own son,\" he lamented. \"I'd of saved the quarters, an' I'd of had a  few dollars now of my own. Uh course,\" he made haste to add, \"I git holt  of a little, now and agin. Too old to ride--too old to work--jest manage  to pick up a dollar er two now and agin--on a horse that kin run.\"    He went over to Smoky again and ran his hand down over the leg muscles  to the hocks, felt for imperfections and straightened painfully, slapped  the horse approvingly between the forelegs and laid a hand on his  shoulder while he turned slowly to Bud.    \"Young feller, there ain't a man on the place right now but you an'  me. What say you throw yore saddle on this horse and take 'im up to the  track? I'd like to see him run. Seems to me he'd ought to be a purty  good quarter-horse.\"    Bud hesitated. \"I wouldn't mind running him, grandpa, if I thought I  could make something on him. I've got my stake to make, and I want to  make it before all my teeth fall out so I can't chew anything but the  cud of reflection on my lost opportunities. If Smoky can run a few  dollars into my pocket, I'm with you.\"    Grandpa teetered forward and put out his hand. \"Shake on that, boy!\" he  cackled. \"Pop Truman ain't too old to have his little joke--and make it  bring him in something, by Christmas! You saddle up and we'll go try him  out on a quarter-mile--mebby a half, if he holds up good.\"    He poked a cigarette-stained forefinger against Bud's chest and  whispered slyly: \"My son Dave, he 's got a horse in the stable that's  been cleanin' everything in the valley. I'll slip him out and up the  creektrail to the track, and you run that horse of yourn agin him. Dave,  he can't git a race outa nobody around here, no more, so he won't run  next Sunday. We'll jest see how yore horse runs alongside Boise. I  kin tell purty well how you kin run agin the rest--Pop, he ain't s'  thick-headed they kin fool him much. What say we try it?\"    Bud stood back and looked him over. \"You shook hands with me on it,\" he  said gravely. \"Where I came from, that holds a man like taking oath on  a Bible in court. I'm a stranger here, but I'm going to expect the same  standard of honor, grandpa. You can back out now, and I'll run Smoky  without any tryout, and you can take your chance. I couldn't expect you  to stand by a stranger against your own folks--\"    \"Sho! Shucks a'mighty!\" Grandpa spat and wagged his head furiously. \"My  own forks'd beat me in a horse race if they could, and I wouldn't hold  it agin 'em! Runnin' horses is like playin' poker. Every feller fer  himself an' mercy to-ward none! I knowed what it meant when I shook with  yuh, young feller, and I hold ye to it. I hold ye to it! You lay low if  I tell ye to lay low, and we'll make us a few dollars, mebby. C'm on and  git that horse outa here b'fore somebuddy comes. It's mail day.\"    He waved Bud toward his saddle and took himself off in a shuffling kind  of trot. By the time Bud had saddled Smoky grandpa hailed him cautiously  from the brush-fringe beyond the corral. He motioned toward a small gate  and Bud led Smoky that way, closing the gate after him.    The old man was mounted on a clean-built bay whose coat shone with  little glints of gold in the dark red. With one sweeping look Bud  observed the points that told of speed, and his eyes went inquiringly to  meet the sharp blue ones, that sparkled under the tufted white eyebrows  of grandpa.    \"Do you expect Smoky to show up the same day that horse arrives?\" he  inquired mildly. \"Pop, you'll have to prove to me that he won't run  Sunday--\"    Pop snorted. \"Seems to me like you do know a speedy horse when you see  one, young feller. Beats me't you been overlookin' what you got under  yore saddle right now. Boise, he's the best runnin' horse in the  valley--and that's why he won't run next Sunday, ner no other Sunday  till somebuddy brings in a strange horse to put agin him. Dave, he won't  crowd ye fur a race, boy. You kin refuse to run yore horse agin him,  like the rest has done. I'll jest lope along t'day and see what yours  kin do.\"    \"Well, all right, then.\" Bud waited for the old man to ride ahead down  the obscure trail that wound through the brush for half a mile or so  before they emerged into the rough border of the creek bed. Pop reined  in close and explained garrulously to Bud how this particular stream  disappeared into the ground two miles above Little Lost, leaving the  wide, level river bottom bone dry.    Pop was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17249"],[0,"Added Upon (#15)"],[1,"looked in pity at his friend. Quite shabbily dressed he was, and  a careworn expression on his face made him look ten years older. He wore  glasses, which he pushed up on his forehead, and then took a good look  at Rupert.    \"Well, well, Rupe, and where have you been keeping yourself? An' I've  had luck, I tell you--you haven't heard, perhaps?\"    \"No; I haven't. What's it been, Volmer?\"    \"Was getting fifty dollars a week leading the orchestra at the Grand in  Chicago, when I got sick. Don't know what it was, Rupe--the doctors  didn't know. Got into my ears, and that knocked me--couldn't tell one  note from another; so, of course, that let me out. Hard luck, Rupe, hard  luck. Tough world this, Rupe. Why God Almighty crams a fellow's head  full of music, and then disables him so's he can't make use of it, I  don't know--I don't know.\"    Rupert sympathized with his friend, and then told him of his errand. A  ray of sunshine seemed to enter the musician's life. The property was  for sale, yes, and cheap, dirt cheap; so the transaction was partly  arranged, and Volmer Holm went home to his wife and four children with  quite a happy heart that day.    \"It's too bad about Volmer Holm,\" said Rupert to his sister. \"I had not  heard of his misfortune. Such a genius in music, too.\"    \"Well, I don't know,\" answered Nina, \"it may be all for the best. Rumor  had it that he was fast getting into bad ways in Chicago; and some men  are better off by being poor, anyway.\"    \"Yes, that's so,\" was all he said.           *       *       *       *       *    Rupert Ames was again the owner of Dry Bench farm, and the next spring  they moved into the old home. Mr. and Mrs. Janson came with them to  visit, but their interests in Chamogo would not allow of a protracted  stay. Signe was already in love with her new home. With her taste for  the artistic, she soon had the place comfortable, and Rupert was never  more satisfied than when he came in where his wife's adept fingers had  been at work to adorn. It was the dear old home to him with an added  beauty, lacking only his mother's presence to make it perfect.    Then they sent for Signe's family. It was hard for the father to make  ends meet in his native land, and Rupert needed just such help as Hr.  Dahl could give. In due time they arrived, and were installed in a  cottage near Rupert's farm.    In peace and prosperity, the days, months, and years went by; and  Rupert Ames became a light to the surrounding world, and a teacher of  righteousness to his brethren.           *       *       *       *       *    It was the sixth year after Rupert's return that the citizens of the  Bench decided to enlarge the reservoir in Dry Hollow. Rupert was given  the work to supervise, and he entered upon the task with his usual  energy.    That morning in September, when he gave his wife the usual departing  kiss, the children--four of them, were hanging about his legs and  clinging to his coat in great glee.    \"Now papa must go,\" said he, as he tried to shake them off.    \"A kiss, another kiss,\" \"A tiss, some more tisses,\" they shouted.    So he lifted them up, one by one, and kissed them again. Then his arm  went around his wife's neck, and he drew her face to his.    \"Goodbye, sweetheart,\" said he, \"take care of the children, and don't  forget me,\" and he tried to hum a song as he walked to the gate. Signe  stood watching him. The tune which floated back to her was, \"O, my  Father.\" Then a peculiar feeling came over her, and she sat down crying,  while the children climbed over her with questions and comforting words.           *       *       *       *       *    Terrible news from Dry Hollow! A blast, prematurely exploded, had  seriously injured some of the workmen, and Rupert Ames had been  killed--hurled down the ravine and nearly buried under falling rock.    Break the news gently to his wife and children. Do not let them see that  bruised, bleeding form. Spare them all you can.    Yes; it was all done--all that lay in human power was done; and hundreds  of people to whom Rupert Ames had opened up new light, and in the  providence of God, had given them a tangible hope of the future,  gathered around his body and mingled their tears with those of his  children's.    Another immortal soul's earthly mission was ended. Life's school had  closed for him. Into another sphere he had gone. The Great Schoolmaster  had promoted him.    And Mrs. Signe Ames, after it all, simply said:    \"God knows best. He has but gone before. He was my husband for time, he  is my husband for eternity. His mission is there, mine is here. In the  morrow, we shall meet again.\"          XI.      \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every    creature.\"--_Mark 16:15._      Hr. Henrik Bogstad leaned back in his chair before the fire in great  relief. He had just shown out a young man who was distributing religious  tracts dealing with some \"new-fangled religion\" lately imported from  America, that land of all new-fangled things. All the day, Hr. Bogstad  had been adjusting some difficulties among his tenants, and that evening  he was somewhat ill-humored. His treatment of the missionary, was,  therefore, harsher than he was wont to treat either strangers or  friends.    His conscience smote him a little as he thought of what the young  American had said. He could find no fault with the religious doctrines  advanced, but why should he be bothered with religion anyway? He had  cares enough; for a great responsibility had come to him since he had  been put in charge of the estate left by his father's death. Just now  was the season of gaiety in Christiania, and here he was missing a good  many things by his enforced visit to his country home.    After musing for some time, he got up and went to the window. Outside,  the snow covered everything--the fields, the roads, the frozen lake and  river. The houses were half hidden, and the pines on the hill bore up  great banks of snow. From the window the view was beautiful in its  solemn whiteness. From the white level of the distant frozen lake,  broken patches of brown protruded. These were the islands on one of  which Signe Dahl had lived. Henrik wondered what had become of her, and  where in the big America she had taken up her abode. He had heard that  she was well and happy, but further than that he had not set himself to  learn. Long ago he had put behind him philosophically his affair with  Signe. He had ceased to think of her as anything more than a sweet, yet  strange girl who could resist such an offer as he had extended to her.    As Henrik was looking out of the window, he saw the young stranger who  had visited him less then an hour ago, returning down the road. Just as  he was about to pass, Henrik hailed him and asked him to come in again,  meeting him at the door.    \"Come in,\" he said; \"I want to talk with you.\"    The missionary placed his grip on a chair and seated himself on another.    \"I was somewhat cross with you when you called,\" said Henrik. \"I don't  want you to think that I am rude, especially to strangers.\"    \"I was not the least offended,\" smiled the other.    \"I'm glad to hear it. Now I want you to tell me something about America.  I've never been there, though I expect to go some day. I have some  friends and a good many relatives over there. From what part do you  come?\"    \"I am from Wyoming.\"    \"That's away out west, isn't it?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Two uncles of mine live in Minnesota, but that's a long way from  Wyoming. Where are you staying here, for the night?\"    \"I am a traveling minister of the gospel and I stay wherever there is an  opportunity.\"    \"Then you'll stay with me tonight. I am not much on religion, but if you  will mix a little information about America with your preaching, I shall  be pleased to listen to you.\"    These conditions were easily agreed to. So, after a good supper, the two  young men seated themselves comfortably by the shaded lamp on the  library table. The missionary spread out his book of views and explained  each of the pictures. He told of the great stretch of arid land in  western America, of the ranches, of the high mountains, of the fertile  valleys made fruitful by irrigation, and of the wonders of the great  Salt Lake.    \"This is the Temple.\"    \"Yes; and what is that for?\"    The purposes of temples were explained.    \"You say you baptize for the dead?\" enquired Henrik, \"How is that?\"    \"Well, as I was telling you when I called on you some time ago--\"    \"Pardon me, but I must confess that I did not pay enough attention to  what you said to remember. I was thinking about those quarreling tenants  of mine. Tell me again.\"    The other smiled good-naturedly, and did as he was asked. Henrik  listened this time, and was indeed interested, asking a good many  questions.    \"Now, about the Temple,\" continued the missionary--\"we believe that  every soul that has ever lived on the earth, that is living now, or that  will ever live must have the privilege of hearing this gospel of Jesus  Christ. There is only one name given under heaven by which men may be  saved, and every creature must hear that name. Now, the great majority  of the human race has never heard the gospel; in fact, will not hear it  in this life.\"    \"Where, then, can they hear it?\"    \"In the great spirit world. Christ, when He was put to death went and  preached to the spirits in prison--those who were disobedient in the  days of Noah and were destroyed in the flood; and no doubt the saving  power of Christ has been proclaimed in that spirit world ever since.  Among those who hear, many will believe. They have faith, they repent of  their sins, but they can not be baptized in water for the remission of  their sins.\"    \"No; of course not.\"    \"And yet Christ definitely said that unless a man is born again of water  and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. What is to be  done?\"    The listener, leaning "]]]
