In Tro-Cortesianus 86a (Pl. 31, fig. 5)  the deer appears with a rope around his body held by a god who is not  easily identified.    Interesting descriptions of the hunt are given in several of the early  accounts.[349-*] It will be noted that the hunt was usually connected  with the religious rites and the offering of deer meat and various parts  of the body of the deer had a ceremonial importance. Attention is called  to similar practices among the Lacandones, the inhabitants of the  region of the Usumacinta at the present time (Tozzer, 1907), where the  greater part of the food of the people must, first of all, be offered to  the gods before it may be eaten by the natives.    The figures of the deer in the codices are clearly associated with god  M, and the latter may be considered a god of the hunt as well as a god  of war. It is very unusual to find a quadruped used as a head-dress in  any way, and yet in several cases we find god M has the head of a deer  as a sort of head covering, Tro-Cortesianus 50b (Pl. 31, fig. 6), 51c  (Pl. 31, fig. 7) and 68b. In the first two cases, the god seems to be  supplied with a bow and arrow. In a passage in Landa (1864, p.  290)[350-*] there is a description of this very scene.    In the month _Zip_, the hunters each took an arrow and a deer's head  which was painted blue; thus adorned they danced. God M is found in one  case in the Dresden in connection with the deer. In Dresden 13c the  animal is represented as female and is shown in intercourse with god M.    An offering of venison is frequently pictured in the manuscripts. Landa  (1864, p. 220)[350-[+]] also furnishes a parallel for this. The haunches  of venison arranged as offerings in dishes are realistically seen in a  number of representations of religious rites, as in Dresden 28c (Pl. 31,  fig. 14) in the last of the rites of the dominical days, 35a (Pl. 31,  fig. 12) and in Tro-Cortesianus 5a above the serpent enclosing the body  of water, 65a in front of god B or D and 105b (Pl. 31, fig. 13) and 108a  (Pl. 31, fig. 15), both of which are in connection with the bee  ceremonies.    The head of the deer, rather than the legs, is also shown as an  offering, in Tro-Cortesianus 69b with god B and Tro-Cortesianus 78 (Pl.  31, fig. 10) in the line of glyphs. The whole deer may be represented as  an offering in Tro-Cortesianus 2b (Pl. 31, fig. 8).[351-*]    There are some examples in the manuscripts where the deer is pictured  quite apart from any idea of the hunt or an offering. In Tro-Cortesianus  14b, it is shown on top of the body of one of the large snakes and in  Tro-Cortesianus 29c (Pl. 31, fig. 3), it appears seated on the end of a  snake-like curve. The deer occurs in Tro-Cortesianus 30b (Pl. 30, fig.  6) in connection with the goddess from whose breasts water is flowing.  God B appears in Dresden 41c (Pl. 31, fig. 1) seated on a red deer. The  same animal is also to be noted in Dresden 60a (Pl. 30, fig. 5) in  connection with the combat of the planets.[351-[+]] A deer is seen in  Tro-Cortesianus 92d seated on a mat opposite a female figure in the same  manner as the armadillo on the same page and a dog on the preceding  page. These, as previously noted, probably refer to cohabitation. On Pl.  32, fig. 9, is a deer from the Peresianus and Pl. 32, fig. 12, shows  another from Stela N, east, from Copan.    The Nahua day _Macatl_ signifies deer and we naturally find a large  number of glyphs representing this animal among the day signs in the  Mexican manuscripts (Pl. 31, fig. 9; Pl. 32, figs. 8, 10, 11).    YUCATAN PECCARY (_Tayassu angulatum yucatanense_; _T. ringens_).  Peccaries (Maya, _qeqem_) of the _T. angulatum_ group are common in  Mexico and Yucatan, and a number of local forms have been named. The  white-lipped peccaries also occur, but in the figures it is impossible  to distinguish the species. These animals are characterized by their  prominent snout, curly tail, bristling dorsal crest, and rather  formidable tusks, as well as by the possession of hoofs. By these marks  most of the figures are readily identifiable (Pl. 32, fig. 1; Pl. 33,  figs. 1, 2, 4-6, 9). The tail is, however, often omitted as well as the  erect line of bristles down the back. The presence of hoofs and the  possession of a truncated pig-like snout are sufficiently  characteristic. In the Dresden Codex occur several figures of undoubted  peccaries. Two of these are pictured in Pl. 32, figs. 2, 4. In each the  hoofs and curly tail appear, and in the latter figure the bristling back  is conventionally drawn by a series of serrations. These marks are  sufficient to identify the animals. Their heads are further  conventionalized, however, by a great exaggeration of the snout beyond  that slightly indicated in Pl. 32, fig. 1, and Pl. 33, figs. 6, 9. Other  representations of the peccary, are shown in Pl. 32, fig. 5, a man with  a peccary's head, and fig. 7 in which the animal's hoofs are replaced by  human hands and feet. In both cases the form of the head remains  characteristic. A curious combination is shown in Pl. 32, fig. 3, an  animal whose head and fore feet are those of a peccary, while the hind  feet have five toes, and there is a long tail. The addition of what look  like scales is found in a figure from the Dresden (Pl. 32, fig. 6).    The peccary is found in several different connections in the  manuscripts. As deer are found associated with the hunt, so, but to a  much more limited extent, the peccary. It is represented pictured as  being captured in snares of the familiar \"jerk-up\" type. Similar  drawings show this animal caught by the foreleg and held partially  suspended, Tro-Cortesianus 49a (Pl. 33, fig. 9),[352-*] 49c (Pl. 33,  fig. 1), and 93a (Pl. 33, fig. 4). Tro-Cortesianus 41b also shows the  peccary associated with hunting scenes. Another realistic drawing of  this animal in Dresden 62 (Pl. 33, fig. 6)[352-[+]] represents him as  seated on the open jaws of a serpent connected with a long number  series. We are unable to explain the signification of the appearance of  the animal in this connection. The peccary is pictured in  Tro-Cortesianus 27b (Pl. 33, fig. 5) seated on the left hand of the  goddess from whose breasts water is flowing.    The peccary seems to be associated with the sky, as it is seen in a  conventionalized form in four instances (Dresden 44b, 45b, (Pl. 32, fig.  4)[TN-9] coming from a band of constellation signs and in Dresden 68a (Pl.  32, fig. 2) coming from a similar band with god E sitting  underneath.[353-*] Above each of these conventionalized figures occur  the corresponding glyph forms (Pl. 33, figs. 7, 8), which show merely  the head with the exaggerated upturned snout. There is a striking  resemblance between these snouts and those of the stone mask-like  figures so frequently represented as a facade decoration in northern  Yucatan. The presence in the mouths of the faces there represented of a  recurved tusk in addition to other teeth is a further resemblance to the  drawings of peccaries. Stempell (1908, p. 718) has reproduced a  photograph of these extraordinary carvings and considers them the heads  of mastodons, apparently solely on account of the shape of the upturned  snout, whose tip in many of the carvings turns forward. They certainly  do not represent the heads of mastodons, but we are not ready to say  that the peccary is the prototype of these carvings, although the  similarity between the glyphs (Pl. 33, figs. 7, 8) and the masks is  worthy of note. One point which does not favor this explanation is the  fact that on the eastern facade of the Monjas at Chichen Itza where the  mask-like panel is seen at its best, we find a realistic drawing of a  peccary (Pl. 33, fig. 2) on the band of glyphs over the doorway, and it  in no way suggests the head on the panel and is quite different from the  head already noted as the glyph of the peccary in the codices.    BAIRD'S TAPIR (_Tapirella bairdi_). No undoubted representations of  tapirs occur in the manuscripts here considered. Possibly tapirs did  not live in the country occupied by the Maya peoples. At the present  time they are found only to the south of Yucatan. In Central America  Baird's and Dow's tapirs are native, the latter, however, more on the  Pacific coast. We have included a drawing of an earthenware vessel (Pl.  28, fig. 1) that represents a tapir, about whose neck is a string of  Oliva shells. The short prehensile trunk of the tapir is well made and  the hoofs are likewise shown. A greatly elongated nose is found in many  of the drawings of the deities, but it does not seem clear that these  represent trunks of tapirs, or, as suggested by Stempell, mastodons! Two  such heads are shown in Pl. 39, figs. 7, 9. These offer a considerable  superficial resemblance to that of a tapir, but as no other drawings  that might be considered to represent this animal are found, it seems  very questionable if the long noses are other than parts of grotesque  masks. The superficial resemblance of the curious nose pieces of the  masks on the panel of the Maya facades to elephants' trunks does not  seem to us especially significant, as otherwise the carvings are quite  unlike elephants. They have no great tusks as an elephant should, but,  instead, short recurved teeth similar to those representing peccary  tusks, as already pointed out.    RABBIT (_Sylvilagus_ or _Lepus_). Rabbits and hares from their  familiarity, their long ears, and their peculiar method of locomotion,  seem always to attract the notice of primitive peoples. Several species  occur in Mexico, including the Marsh rabbit (_Sylvilagus truei_; _S.  insonus_), various races of the Cottontail rabbit (_S. floridanus  connectens_; _S. f. chiapensis_, _S. f. yucatanicus_; _S. aztecus_; _S.  orizabae_, etc.) and several Jack rabbits (_Lepus alleni pallitans_; _L.  callotis flavigularis_, _L. asellus_). It is, of course, quite  impossible "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1906"],[0,"Erewhon; Or, Over the Range (#15)"],[1," dinner there  came a tall lean man with a black beard, to whom Mr. Nosnibor and the  whole family paid great attention: he was the family straightener.  With  this gentleman Mr. Nosnibor retired into another room, from which there  presently proceeded a sound of weeping and wailing.  I could hardly  believe my ears, but in a few minutes I got to know for a certainty that  they came from Mr. Nosnibor himself.    \"Poor papa,\" said Arowhena, as she helped herself composedly to the salt,  \"how terribly he has suffered.\"    \"Yes,\" answered her mother; \"but I think he is quite out of danger now.\"    Then they went on to explain to me the circumstances of the case, and the  treatment which the straightener had prescribed, and how successful he  had been--all which I will reserve for another chapter, and put rather in  the form of a general summary of the opinions current upon these subjects  than in the exact words in which the facts were delivered to me; the  reader, however, is earnestly requested to believe that both in this next  chapter and in those that follow it I have endeavoured to adhere most  conscientiously to the strictest accuracy, and that I have never  willingly misrepresented, though I may have sometimes failed to  understand all the bearings of an opinion or custom.          CHAPTER X: CURRENT OPINIONS      This is what I gathered.  That in that country if a man falls into ill  health, or catches any disorder, or fails bodily in any way before he is  seventy years old, he is tried before a jury of his countrymen, and if  convicted is held up to public scorn and sentenced more or less severely  as the case may be.  There are subdivisions of illnesses into crimes and  misdemeanours as with offences amongst ourselves--a man being punished  very heavily for serious illness, while failure of eyes or hearing in one  over sixty-five, who has had good health hitherto, is dealt with by fine  only, or imprisonment in default of payment.  But if a man forges a  cheque, or sets his house on fire, or robs with violence from the person,  or does any other such things as are criminal in our own country, he is  either taken to a hospital and most carefully tended at the public  expense, or if he is in good circumstances, he lets it be known to all  his friends that he is suffering from a severe fit of immorality, just as  we do when we are ill, and they come and visit him with great solicitude,  and inquire with interest how it all came about, what symptoms first  showed themselves, and so forth,--questions which he will answer with  perfect unreserve; for bad conduct, though considered no less deplorable  than illness with ourselves, and as unquestionably indicating something  seriously wrong with the individual who misbehaves, is nevertheless held  to be the result of either pre-natal or post-natal misfortune.    The strange part of the story, however, is that though they ascribe moral  defects to the effect of misfortune either in character or surroundings,  they will not listen to the plea of misfortune in cases that in England  meet with sympathy and commiseration only.  Ill luck of any kind, or even  ill treatment at the hands of others, is considered an offence against  society, inasmuch as it makes people uncomfortable to hear of it.  Loss  of fortune, therefore, or loss of some dear friend on whom another was  much dependent, is punished hardly less severely than physical  delinquency.    Foreign, indeed, as such ideas are to our own, traces of somewhat similar  opinions can be found even in nineteenth-century England.  If a person  has an abscess, the medical man will say that it contains \"peccant\"  matter, and people say that they have a \"bad\" arm or finger, or that they  are very \"bad\" all over, when they only mean \"diseased.\"  Among foreign  nations Erewhonian opinions may be still more clearly noted.  The  Mahommedans, for example, to this day, send their female prisoners to  hospitals, and the New Zealand Maories visit any misfortune with forcible  entry into the house of the offender, and the breaking up and burning of  all his goods.  The Italians, again, use the same word for \"disgrace\" and  \"misfortune.\"  I once heard an Italian lady speak of a young friend whom  she described as endowed with every virtue under heaven, \"ma,\" she  exclaimed, \"povero disgraziato, ha ammazzato suo zio.\"  (\"Poor  unfortunate fellow, he has murdered his uncle.\")    On mentioning this, which I heard when taken to Italy as a boy by my  father, the person to whom I told it showed no surprise.  He said that he  had been driven for two or three years in a certain city by a young  Sicilian cabdriver of prepossessing manners and appearance, but then lost  sight of him.  On asking what had become of him, he was told that he was  in prison for having shot at his father with intent to kill him--happily  without serious result.  Some years later my informant again found  himself warmly accosted by the prepossessing young cabdriver.  \"Ah, caro  signore,\" he exclaimed, \"sono cinque anni che non lo vedo--tre anni di  militare, e due anni di disgrazia,\" &c.  (\"My dear sir, it is five years  since I saw you--three years of military service, and two of  misfortune\")--during which last the poor fellow had been in prison.  Of  moral sense he showed not so much as a trace.  He and his father were now  on excellent terms, and were likely to remain so unless either of them  should again have the misfortune mortally to offend the other.    In the following chapter I will give a few examples of the way in which  what we should call misfortune, hardship, or disease are dealt with by  the Erewhonians, but for the moment will return to their treatment of  cases that with us are criminal.  As I have already said, these, though  not judicially punishable, are recognised as requiring correction.  Accordingly, there exists a class of men trained in soul-craft, whom they  call straighteners, as nearly as I can translate a word which literally  means \"one who bends back the crooked.\"  These men practise much as  medical men in England, and receive a quasi-surreptitious fee on every  visit.  They are treated with the same unreserve, and obeyed as readily,  as our own doctors--that is to say, on the whole sufficiently--because  people know that it is their interest to get well as soon as they can,  and that they will not be scouted as they would be if their bodies were  out of order, even though they may have to undergo a very painful course  of treatment.    When I say that they will not be scouted, I do not mean that an  Erewhonian will suffer no social inconvenience in consequence, we will  say, of having committed fraud.  Friends will fall away from him because  of his being less pleasant company, just as we ourselves are disinclined  to make companions of those who are either poor or poorly.  No one with  any sense of self-respect will place himself on an equality in the matter  of affection with those who are less lucky than himself in birth, health,  money, good looks, capacity, or anything else.  Indeed, that dislike and  even disgust should be felt by the fortunate for the unfortunate, or at  any rate for those who have been discovered to have met with any of the  more serious and less familiar misfortunes, is not only natural, but  desirable for any society, whether of man or brute.    The fact, therefore, that the Erewhonians attach none of that guilt to  crime which they do to physical ailments, does not prevent the more  selfish among them from neglecting a friend who has robbed a bank, for  instance, till he has fully recovered; but it does prevent them from even  thinking of treating criminals with that contemptuous tone which would  seem to say, \"I, if I were you, should be a better man than you are,\" a  tone which is held quite reasonable in regard to physical ailment.  Hence,  though they conceal ill health by every cunning and hypocrisy and  artifice which they can devise, they are quite open about the most  flagrant mental diseases, should they happen to exist, which to do the  people justice is not often.  Indeed, there are some who are, so to  speak, spiritual valetudinarians, and who make themselves exceedingly  ridiculous by their nervous supposition that they are wicked, while they  are very tolerable people all the time.  This however is exceptional; and  on the whole they use much the same reserve or unreserve about the state  of their moral welfare as we do about our health.    Hence all the ordinary greetings among ourselves, such as, How do you do?  and the like, are considered signs of gross ill-breeding; nor do the  politer classes tolerate even such a common complimentary remark as  telling a man that he is looking well.  They salute each other with, \"I  hope you are good this morning;\" or \"I hope you have recovered from the  snappishness from which you were suffering when I last saw you;\" and if  the person saluted has not been good, or is still snappish, he says so at  once and is condoled with accordingly.  Indeed, the straighteners have  gone so far as to give names from the hypothetical language (as taught at  the Colleges of Unreason), to all known forms of mental indisposition,  and to classify them according to a system of their own, which, though I  could not understand it, seemed to work well in practice; for they are  always able to tell a man what is the matter with him as soon as they  have heard his story, and their familiarity with the long names assures  him that they thoroughly understand his case.    The reader will have no difficulty in believing that the laws regarding  ill health were frequently evaded by the help of recognised fictions,  which every one understood, but which it would be considered gross ill-  breeding to even seem to understand.  Thus, a day or two after my arrival  at the Nosnibors', one of the many ladies who called on me made excuses  for her husband's only sending his card,"]]]
