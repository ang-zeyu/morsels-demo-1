If the column had been captured so soon  after the Paardeberg disaster, the relief of Kimberley and the relief of  Ladysmith, it might have been so disheartening to the remaining Boer  commandos that the war might have been ended at that time. It was a  magnificent retreat and well worthy to be placed in the Boer's scroll of  honour with Cronje's noble stand at Paardeberg, with Spion Kop and  Magersfontein.    [Illustration: GENERAL GROBLER]    The Boer army was capable of moving rapidly under almost any  conditions. The British army demonstrated upon many occasions that it  could not move more than two or three miles an hour when the column was  hampered with transport waggons and camping paraphernalia, and frequently  it was impossible to proceed at that pace for many consecutive hours. A  Boer commando easily travelled six miles an hour and not infrequently,  when there was a necessity for rapid motion, seven and even eight miles an  hour were traversed. When General Lucas Meyer moved his commandos along  the border at the outset of the war and learned that General Penn-Symons  was located at Dundee he made a night march of almost forty miles in six  hours and occupied Talana Hill, a mile distant from the enemy, who was  ignorant of the Boers' proximity until the camp was shelled at daybreak.  When General De Wet learned that Colonel Broadwood was moving westward  from Thaba N'Chu on March 30th, he was in laager several miles east of  Brandfort, but it required only several minutes for all the burghers to be  on their horses and ready to proceed toward the enemy. The journey of  twenty-five miles to Sannaspost, or the Bloemfontein waterworks, was made  in the short time of five hours, while Colonel Broadwood's forces consumed  seven hours in making the ten miles' journey from Thaba N'Chu to the same  place. The British column was unable to move more rapidly on account of  its large convoy of waggons, but even then the rate of progress was not as  great as that made by the trekking party of the three generals who were  similarly hampered. It was rarely the case that the Boers attempted to  trek for any considerable distance with their heavy waggons when they were  aware of the presence of the enemy in the vicinity. Ox-waggons were always  left behind, while only a small number of mule-waggons, bearing provisions  and ammunition, were taken, and on that account they were able to move  with greater rapidity than their opponents. Frequently they entered  dangerous territory with only a few days' provisions and risked a famine  of food and ammunition rather than load themselves down with many  lumbering waggons which were likely to retard their progress. After  fighting the battle at Moester's Hoek, General De Wet had hardly three  days' food and very little ammunition with him, yet rather than delay his  march and send for more waggons, he proceeded to Wepener where, after  several days' fighting, both his food and ammunition became exhausted and  he was obliged to lie idle around the enemy and await the arrival of the  supplies which he might have carried with him at the outset of the trek if  he had cared to risk such an impediment to his rapid movements.    One of the primary reasons why the Boer could move more rapidly than the  British was the difference in the weight carried by their horses. The Boer  paid no attention to art when he went to war, and consequently he carried  nothing that was not absolutely essential. His saddle was less than half  the weight of a British saddle, and that was almost all the equipment he  carried when on a trek. The Boer rider and equipment, including saddle,  rifle, blankets, and a food-supply, rarely weighed more than two hundred  and fifty pounds, which was not a heavy load for a horse to carry. A  British cavalryman and his equipment of heavy saddle, sabre, carbine, and  saddle-bags, rarely weighed less than four hundred pounds--a burden which  soon tired a horse. Again, almost every Boer had two horses, so that when  one had been ridden for an hour or more he was relieved and led, while the  other was used. In this manner the Boers were able to travel from twelve  to fourteen hours in a day when it was absolutely necessary to reach a  certain point at a given time. Six miles an hour was the rate of progress  ascribed to horses in normal condition, and when a forced march was  attempted they could travel sixty and seventy miles in a day, and be in  good condition the following morning to undertake another journey of equal  length. Small commandos often covered sixty and seventy miles in a day,  especially during the fighting along the Tugela, while after the battles  of Poplar Grove and Abraham's Kraal, and the capture of Bloemfontein, it  seemed as if the entire army in the Free State were moving northward at a  rate of speed far exceeding that of an express train. The mobility of the  Boer army was then on a par with that of the British army after the battle  of Dundee, and it was difficult to determine which of the two deserved the  palm for the best display of accelerated motion.    A feature of the Boer system of warfare which was most striking was the  manner in which each individual protected himself, as far as possible,  from danger. In lion-hunting it is an axiom that the hunter must not  pursue a wounded lion into tall grass or underbrush lest the pursuer may  be attacked. In the Boer army it was a natural instinct, common to all the  burghers, which led them to seek their own safety whenever danger seemed  to be near. Men who follow the most peaceful pursuits of life value their  lives highly. They do not assume great risks even if great ends are to be  attained. The majority of the Boers were farmers who saw no glory in  attempting to gain a great success, the attainment of which made it  necessary that they should risk their lives. It seemed as if each man  realised that his death meant a great loss to the Boer army, already  small, and that he did not mean to diminish its size if he could possibly  prevent it. The Boer was quick in noting when the proper time arrived for  retreat, and he was not slothful in acting upon his observations.  Retreating at the proper time was one of the Boers' characteristics, but  it could not be called an advantage, for frequently many of the Boers  misjudged the proper time for retreating and left the field when a battle  was almost won. At Poplar Grove the Boers might have won the day if the  majority of the burghers had remained and fought an hour or two longer  instead of retreating precipitately when the individuals determined that  safety was to be found only in flight. At Elandslaagte the foreigners  under General Kock did not gauge the proper moment for retreat, but  continued with the fighting and were almost annihilated by the Lancers  because of their lack of discretion in that respect. The burghers of the  Free State, in particular, had the instinct of retreating abnormally  developed, and whenever a battle was in progress large numbers of burghers  could be observed going in an opposite direction as rapidly as their  ponies could carry them over the veld. The lack of discipline in the  commandos made such practices possible; in fact there was no rule or law  by which a burgher could be prevented from retreating or deserting  whenever he felt that he did not care to participate in a battle. After  the British occupation of Bloemfontein there was a small skirmish about  eight miles north of that city at a place called Tafelkop which sent the  Free Staters running in all directions. The veld seemed to be filled with  deserters, and at every farmhouse there were from two to six able-bodied  men who had retreated when they believed themselves to be in grave danger.    Foolish men attribute all the moral courage in the world to the soldiers  of their own country, but nature made a wise distribution of that gift,  and not all the Boers were cowards. Boer generals with only a few hundred  men time and again attacked thousands of British soldiers, and frequently  vanquished them. General Botha's twenty-five hundred men held out for a  week against General Buller's thirty or forty thousand men, and General  Cronje with his four thousand burghers succumbed to nothing less than  forty thousand men and a hundred and fifty heavy guns under Field-Marshal  Lord Roberts. Those two examples of Boer bravery would suffice to prove  that the South African farmers had moral courage of no mean order if there  were not a thousand and one other splendid records of bravery. The  burghers did not always lie behind their shelter until the enemy had come  within several hundred yards and then bowl them over with deadly accuracy.  At the Platrand fight near Ladysmith, on January 6th, the Boers charged  and captured British positions, drove the defenders out, and did it so  successfully that only a few Boers were killed. The Spion Kop fight, a  second Majuba Hill, was won after one of the finest displays of moral  courage in the war. It requires bravery of the highest type for a small  body of men to climb a steep hill in the face of the enemy which is three  times greater numerically and armed with larger and more guns, yet that  was the case with the Boers at Spion Kop. There were but few battles in  the entire campaign that the Boer forces were not vastly outnumbered by  the enemy, who usually had from twice to twenty times their number of  cannon, yet the burghers were well aware of the fact and did not allow it  to interfere with their plans nor did they display great temerity in  battling with such a foe. When Lord Roberts and his three thousand cavalry  entered Jacobsdal there were less than one hundred armed Boers in the  town, but they made a determined stand against the enemy, and in a  street-fight a large percentage of the burghers fell, and their blood  mingled with that of those they had "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16467"],[0,"Musicians of To-Day (#15)"],[1,"skin with some scales stuck about it. At       one end of the skin they wagged a tail, and at the other end they       opened a crocodile's mouth, out of which came fire. The dragon,       which ought to have been a frightful beast--and perhaps he would       have frightened children about five years old--said a few words in       a bass voice. It was so childish and feeble that one was astonished       to see grown-up people present; even thousands of so-called       cultured people looked on and listened attentively, and went into       raptures. Then Siegfried arrived with his horn. He lay down during       a pause, which is reputed to be very beautiful; and sometimes he       talked to himself, and sometimes he was quite silent. He wanted to       imitate the song of the birds, and cut a rush with his horn, and       made a flute out of it. But he played the flute badly, and so he       began to blow his horn. The scene is intolerable, and there is not       the least trace of music in it. I was annoyed to see three thousand       people round about me, listening submissively to this absurdity       and dutifully admiring it.         \"With some courage I managed to wait for the next       scene--Siegfried's fight with the dragon. There were roarings and       flames of fire and brandishings of the sword. But I could not stand       it any longer; and I fled out of the theatre with a feeling of       disgust that I have not yet forgotten.\"    I admit I cannot read this delightful criticism without laughing; and it  does not affect me painfully like Nietzsche's pernicious and morbid  irony. It used to be a grief to me that two men whom I loved with an  equal affection, and whom I reverenced as the finest spirits in Europe,  remained strangers and hostile to each other. I could not bear the  thought that a genius, hopelessly misunderstood by the crowd, should be  bent on making his solitude more bitter and narrow by refusing, with a  sort of jealous waywardness, to be reconciled to his equals, or to offer  them the hand of friendship. But now I think that perhaps it was better  so. The first virtue of genius is sincerity. If Nietzsche had to go out  of his way _not_ to understand Wagner, it is natural, on the other hand,  that Wagner should be a closed book to Tolstoy; it would be almost  surprising if it were otherwise. Each one has his own part to play, and  has no need to change it. Wagner's wonderful dreams and magic intuition  of the inner life are not less valuable to us than Tolstoy's pitiless  truth, in which he exposes modern society and tears away the veil of  hypocrisy with which she covers herself. So I admire _Siegfried_, and  at the same time enjoy Tolstoy's satire; for I like the latter's sturdy  humour, which is one of the most striking features of his realism, and  which, as he himself noticed, makes him closely resemble Rousseau. Both  men show us an ultra-refined civilisation, and both are uncompromising  apostles of a return to nature.    Tolstoy's rough banter recalls Rousseau's sarcasm about an opera of  Rameau's. In the _Nouvelle Heloise_, he rails in a similar fashion  against the sadly fantastic performances at the theatre. It was, even  then, a question of monsters, \"of dragons animated by a blockhead of a  Savoyard, who had not enough spirit for the beast.\"         \"They assured me that they had a tremendous lot of machinery to       make all this movement, and they offered several times to show it       to me; but I felt no curiosity about little effects achieved by       great efforts.... The sky is represented by some blue rags       suspended from sticks and cords, like a laundry display.... The       chariots of the gods and goddesses are made of four joists in a       frame, suspended by a thick rope, as a swing might be. Then a plank       is stuck across the joists, and on this is seated a god. In front       of him hangs a piece of daubed cloth, which serves as a cloud upon       which his splendid chariot may rest.... The theatre is furnished       with little square trap-doors which, opening as occasion requires,       show that the demons can be let loose from the cellars. When the       demons have to fly in the air, dummies of brown cloth are       substituted, or sometimes real chimney-sweeps, who swing in the       air, suspended by cords, until they are gloriously lost in the rag       sky....         \"But you can have no idea of the dreadful cries and roarings with       which the theatre resounds.... What is so extraordinary is that       these howlings are almost the only things that the audience       applaud. By the way they clap their hands one would take them to be       a lot of deaf creatures, who were so delighted to catch a few       piercing sounds now and then that they wanted the actors to do them       all over again. I am quite sure that people applaud the bawling of       an actress at the opera as they would a mountebank's feats of skill       at a fair--one suffers while they are going on, but one is so       delighted to see them finish without an accident that one willingly       demonstrates one's pleasure.... With these beautiful sounds, as       true as they are sweet, those of the orchestra blend very worthily.       Imagine an unending clatter of instruments without any melody; a       lingering and endless groaning among the bass parts; and the whole       the most mournful and boring thing that I ever heard in my life. I       could not put up with it for half an hour without getting a violent       headache.         \"All this forms a sort of psalmody, possessing neither tune nor       time. But if by any chance a lively air is played, there is a       general stamping; the audience is set in motion, and follows, with       a great deal of trouble and noise, some performer in the       orchestra. Delighted to feel for a few moments the rhythm that is       so lacking, they torment the ear, the voice, the arms, the legs,       and all the body, to chase after a tune that is ever ready to       escape them....\"    I have quoted this rather long passage to show how the impression made  by one of Rameau's operas on his contemporaries resembled that made by  Wagner on his enemies. It was not without reason that Rameau was said to  be Wagner's forerunner, as Rousseau was Tolstoy's forerunner.    In reality, it was not against _Siegfried_ itself that Tolstoy's  criticism was directed; and Tolstoy was closer than he thought to the  spirit of this drama. Is not Siegfried the heroic incarnation of a free  and healthy man, sprung directly from Nature? In a sketch of  _Siegfried_, written in 1848, Wagner says:         \"To follow the impulses of my heart is my supreme law; what I can       accomplish by obeying my instincts is what I ought to do. Is that       voice of instinct cursed or blessed? I do not know; but I yield to       it, and never force myself to run counter to my inclination.\"    Wagner fought against civilisation by quite other methods than those  employed by Tolstoy; and if the efforts of the two were equally great,  the practical result is--one must really say it--as poor on one side as  on the other.    What Tolstoy's raillery is really aimed at is not Wagner's work, but the  way in which his work was represented. The splendours of the setting do  not hide the childishness of the ideas behind them: the dragon Fafna,  Fricka's rams, the bear, the serpent, and all the Valhalla menagerie  have always been ridiculous. I will only add that the dragon's failure  to be terrifying was not Wagner's fault, for he never attempted to  depict a terrifying dragon. He gave it quite clearly, and of his own  choice, a comic character. Both the text and the music make Fafner a  sort of ogre, a simple creature, but, above all, a grotesque one.    Besides, I cannot help feeling that scenic reality takes away rather  than adds to the effect of these great philosophical fairylands. Malwida  von Meysenbug told me that at the Bayreuth festival of 1876, while she  was following one of the _Ring_ scenes very attentively with her  opera-glasses, two hands were laid over her eyes, and she heard Wagner's  voice say impatiently: \"Don't look so much at what is going on. Listen!\"  It was good counsel. There are dilettanti who pretend that at a concert  the best way to enjoy Beethoven's last works--where the sonority is  defective--is to stop the ears and read the score. One might say with  less of a paradox that the best way to follow a performance of Wagner's  operas is to listen with the eyes shut. So perfect is the music, so  powerful its hold on the imagination, that it leaves nothing to be  desired; what it suggests to the mind is infinitely finer than what the  eyes may see. I have never shared the opinion that Wagner's works may  be best appreciated in the theatre. His works are epic symphonies. As a  frame for them I should like temples; as scenery, the illimitable land  of thought; as actors, our dreams.           *       *       *       *       *    The first act of _Siegfried_ is one of the most dramatic in the  Tetralogy. Nothing satisfied me more completely at Bayreuth, both as  regards the actors and the dramatic effects. Fantastic creatures like  Alberich and Mimi, who seem to be out of their element in France, are  rooted deep down in German imaginations. The Bayreuth actors surpassed  themselves in making them startlingly lifelike, with a trembling and  grimacing realism. Burgstaller, who was then making his debut in  _Siegfried_, acted with an impetuous awkwardness which accorded well  with the part. I remember with what zest--which seemed in no way  affected--he played the hero smith, labouring like a true workman,  blowing the fire and making the blade glow, dipping it in the steaming  water, and working it on the anvil; and then, in a burst of Homeric  gaiety, singing that fine hymn at the end of the first act, which sounds  like an"]]]
