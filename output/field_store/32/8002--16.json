Over him, under him, beside him hovered the  mother on tireless wings, calling softly that she was there. But the  awful fear of the depths and the lance tops of the spruces was upon  the little one; his flapping grew more wild; he fell faster and  faster. Suddenly--more in fright, it seemed to me, than because he had  spent his strength--he lost his balance and tipped head downward in  the air. It was all over now, it seemed; he folded his wings to be  dashed in pieces among the trees. Then like a flash the old  mother-eagle shot under him; his despairing feet touched her broad  shoulders, between her wings. He righted himself, rested an instant,  found his head; then she dropped like a shot from under him, leaving  him to come down on his own wings. A handful of feathers, torn out by  his claws, hovered slowly down after them.    It was all the work of an instant before I lost them among the trees  far below. And when I found them again with my glass, the eaglet was  in the top of a great pine, and the mother was feeding him.    And then, standing there alone in the great wilderness, it flashed  upon me for the first time just what the wise old prophet meant;  though he wrote long ago, in a distant land, and another than Cloud  Wings had taught her little ones, all unconscious of the kindly eyes  that watched out of a thicket: \"As the eagle stirreth up her nest,  fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them,  beareth them on her wings,--so the Lord.\"          VII. UPWEEKIS THE SHADOW.    [Illustration: Upweekis]      \"Long 'go, O long time 'go,\" so says Simmo the Indian, Upweekis the  lynx came to Clote Scarpe one day with a complaint. \"See,\" he said,  \"you are good to everybody but me. Pekquam the fisher is cunning and  patient; he can catch what he will. Lhoks the panther is strong and  tireless; nothing can get away from him, not even the great moose. And  Mooween the bear sleeps all winter, when game is scarce, and in summer  eats everything,--roots and mice and berries and dead fish and meat  and honey and red ants. So he is always full and happy. But my eyes  are no good; they are bright, like Cheplahgan the eagle's, yet they  cannot see anything unless it moves; for you have made every creature  that hides just like the place he hides in. My nose is worse; it  cannot smell Seksagadagee the grouse, though I walk over him asleep  in the snow. And my feet make a noise in the leaves, so that Moktaques  the rabbit hears me, and hides, and laughs behind me when I go to  catch him. And I am always hungry. Make me now like the shadows that  play, in order that nothing may notice me when I go hunting.\"    So Clote Scarpe, the great chief who was kind to all animals, gave  Upweekis a soft gray coat that is almost invisible in the woods,  summer or winter, and made his feet large, and padded them with soft  fur; so that indeed he is like the shadows that play, for you can  neither see nor hear him. But Clote Scarpe remembered Moktaques the  rabbit also, and gave him two coats, a brown one for summer and a  white one for winter. Consequently he is harder than ever to see when  he is quiet; and Upweekis must still depend upon his wits to catch  him. As Upweekis has few wits to spare, Moktaques often sees him close  at hand, and chuckles in his form under the brown ferns, or sits up  straight under the snow-covered hemlock tips, and watches the big lynx  at his hunting.    Sometimes, on a winter night, when you camp in the wilderness, and the  snow is sifting down into your fire, and the woods are all still, a  fierce screech breaks suddenly out of the darkness just behind your  wind-break of boughs. You jump to your feet and grab your rifle; but  Simmo, who is down on his knees before the fire frying pork, only  turns his head to listen a moment, and says: \"Upweekis catch-um rabbit  dat time.\" Then he gets closer to the fire, for the screech was not  pleasant, and goes on with his cooking.    You are more curious than he, or you want the big cat's skin to take  home with you. You steal away towards the cry, past the little  _commoosie_, or shelter, that you made hastily at sundown when the  trail ended. There, with your back to the fire and the _commoosie_  between, the light does not dazzle your eyes; you can trace the  shadows creeping in and out stealthily among the underbrush. But if  Upweekis is there--and he probably is--you do not see him. He is a  shadow among the shadows. Only there is this difference: shadows move  no bushes. As you watch, a fir-tip stirs; a bit of snow drops down.  You gaze intently at the spot. Then out of the deep shadow two living  coals are suddenly kindled. They grow larger and larger, glowing,  flashing, burning holes into your eyes till you brush them swiftly  with your hand. A shiver runs over you, for to look into the eyes of  a lynx at night, when the light catches them, is a scary experience.  Your rifle jumps to position; the glowing coals are quenched on the  instant. Then, when your eyes have blinked the fascination out of  them, the shadows go creeping in and out again, and Upweekis is lost  amongst them.    Sometimes, indeed, you see him again. Moktaques, the big white hare,  who forgets a thing the moment it is past, sees you standing there and  is full of curiosity. He forgets that he was being hunted a moment  ago, and comes hopping along to see what you are. You back away toward  the fire. He scampers off in a fright, but presently comes hopping  after you. Watch the underbrush behind him sharply. In a moment it  stirs stealthily, as if a shadow were moving it; and there is the  lynx, stealing along in the snow with his eyes blazing. Again  Moktaques feels that he is hunted, and does the only safe thing; he  crouches low in the snow, where a fir-tip bends over him, and is still  as the earth. His color hides him perfectly.    Upweekis has lost the trail again; he wavers back and forth, like a  shadow under a swinging lamp, turning his great head from side to  side. He cannot see nor hear nor smell his game; but he saw a bit of  snow fly a moment ago, and knows that it came from Moktaques' big  pads. Don't stir now; be still as the great spruce in whose shadow  you stand; and, once in a hunter's lifetime perhaps, you will see a  curious tragedy.    The lynx settles himself in the snow, with all four feet close  together, ready for a spring. As you watch and wonder, a screech rings  out through the woods, so sharp and fierce that no rabbit's nerves can  stand it close at hand and be still. Moktaques jumps straight up in  the air. The lynx sees it, whirls, hurls himself at the spot. Another  screech, a different one, and then you know that it's all over.    And that is why Upweekis' cry is so fierce and sudden on a winter  night. Your fire attracts the rabbits. Upweekis knows this, or is  perhaps attracted himself and comes also, and hides among the shadows.  But he never catches anything unless he blunders onto it. That is why  he wanders so much in winter and passes twenty rabbits before he  catches one. So when he knows that Moktaques is near, watching the  light, but remaining himself invisible, Upweekis crouches for a  spring; then he screeches fearfully. Moktaques hears it and is  startled, as anybody else would be, hearing such a cry near him. He  jumps in a fright and pays the penalty.    If the lynx is a big one, and very hungry, as he generally is in  winter, you may get some unpleasant impressions of him in another way  when you venture far from your fire. His eyes blaze out at you from  the darkness, just two big glowing spots, which are all you see, and  which disappear at your first motion. Then as you strain your eyes,  and watch and listen, you feel the coals upon you again from another  place; and there they are, under a bush on your left, creeping closer  and blazing deep red. They disappear suddenly as the lynx turns his  head, only to reappear and fascinate you from another point. So he  plays with you as if you were a great mouse, creeping closer all the  time, swishing his stub tail fiercely to lash himself up to the  courage point of springing. But his movements are so still and shadowy  that unless he follows you as you back away to the fire, and so comes  within the circle of light, the chances are that you will never see  him.    Indeed the chances are always that way, day or night, unless you turn  hunter and set a trap for him in the rabbit paths which he follows  nightly, and hang a bait over it to make him look up and forget his  steps. In summer he goes to the burned lands for the rabbits that  swarm in the thickets, and to rear his young in seclusion. You find  his tracks there all about, and the marks of his killing; but though  you watch and prowl all day and come home in the twilight, you will  learn little. He hears you and skulks away amid the lights and  shadows of the hillside, and so hides himself--in plain sight,  sometimes, like a young partridge--that he manages to keep a clean  record in the notebook where you hoped to write down all about him.    In winter you cross his tracks, great round tracks that wander  everywhere through the big woods, and you think: Now I shall find him  surely. But though you follow for miles and learn much about him,  finding where he passed this rabbit close at hand, without suspecting  it, and caught that one by accident, and missed the partridge that  burst out of the snow under his very feet,--still Upweekis himself  remains only a shadow of the woods. Once, after a glorious long tramp  on his trail, I found the spot where he had been sleeping a moment  before. But beside that experience I must put fifty other trails that  I have followed, of which I never saw the end nor the beginning. And  whenever I have found out anything about Upweekis it has generally  come unexpectedly, as most good things do.    Once the chance came as I was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15955"],[0,"A Short History of Scotland (#15)"],[1,"was ratified on  August 25, Arran was compelled to insist on compensation for the ships,  but on August 28 he proclaimed Beaton a traitor.  In the beginning of  September Arran favoured the wrecking of the Franciscan monastery in  Edinburgh; and at Dundee the mob, moved by sermons from the celebrated  martyr George Wishart, did sack the houses of the Franciscans and the  Dominicans; Beaton's Abbey of Arbroath and the Abbey of Lindores were  also plundered.  Clearly it was believed that Beaton was down, and that  church-pillage was authorised by Arran.  Yet on September 3 Arran joined  hands with Beaton!  The Cardinal, by threatening to disprove Arran's  legitimacy and ruin his hopes of the crown, or in some other way, had  dominated the waverer, while Henry (August 29) was mobilising an army of  20,000 men for the invasion of Scotland.  On September 9 Mary was crowned  at Stirling.  But Beaton could not hold both Arran and his rival Lennox,  who committed an act of disgraceful treachery.  With Glencairn he seized  large supplies of money and stores sent by France to Dumbarton Castle.  In  1544 he fled to England and to the protection of Henry, and married  Margaret, daughter of Angus and Margaret Tudor, widow of James IV.  He  became the father of Darnley, Mary's husband in later years, and the  fortunes of Scotland were fatally involved in the feud between the Lennox  Stewarts and the House of Hamilton.    Meanwhile (November 1543) Arran and Beaton together broke and persecuted  the abbey robbers of Perthshire and Angus, making \"martyrs\" and  incurring, on Beaton's part, fatal feuds with Leslies, Greys, Learmonths,  and Kirkcaldys.  Parliament (December 11) declared the treaty with  England void; the party of the Douglases, equally suspected by Henry and  by Beaton, was crushed, and George Douglas was held a hostage, still  betraying his country in letters to England.  Martyrs were burned in  Perth and Dundee, which merely infuriated the populace.  In April 1544,  while Henry was giving the most cruel orders to his army of invasion, one  Wishart visited him with offers, which were accepted, for the murder of  the Cardinal. {94}  Early in May the English army under Hertford took  Leith, \"raised a jolly fire,\" says Hertford, in Edinburgh; he burned the  towns on his line of march, and retired.    On May 17 Lennox and Glencairn sold themselves to Henry; for ample  rewards they were to secure the teaching of God's word \"as the mere and  only foundation whence proceeds all truth and honour\"!  Arran defeated  Glencairn when he attempted his godly task, and Lennox was driven back  into England.    In June Mary of Guise fell into the hands of nobles led by Angus, while  the Fife, Perthshire, and Angus lairds, lately Beaton's deadly foes, came  into the Cardinal's party.  With him and Arran, in November, were banded  the Protestants who were to be his murderers, while the Douglases, in  December, were cleared by Parliament of all their offences, and Henry  offered 3000 crowns for their \"trapping.\"  Angus, in February 1545,  protested that he loved Henry \"best of all men,\" and would make Lennox  Governor of Scotland, while Wharton, for Henry, was trying to kidnap  Angus.  Enraged by the English desecration of his ancestors' graves at  Melrose Abbey, Angus united with Arran, Norman Leslie, and Buccleuch to  annihilate an English force at Ancrum Moor, where Henry's men lost 800  slain and 2000 prisoners.  The loyalty of Angus to his country was now,  by innocents like Arran, thought assured.  The plot for Beaton's murder  was in 1545 negotiated between Henry and Cassilis, backed by George  Douglas; and Crichton of Brunston, as before, was engaged, a godly laird  in Lothian.  In August the Douglases boast that, as Henry's friends, they  have frustrated an invasion of England with a large French contingent,  which they pretended to lead, while they secured its failure.  Meanwhile,  after forty years, Donald Dubh, and all the great western chiefs, none of  whom could write, renewed the alliance of 1463 with England, calling  themselves \"auld enemies of Scotland.\"  Their religious predilections,  however, were not Protestant.  They promised to destroy or reduce half of  Scotland, and hailed Lennox as Governor, as in Angus's offer to Henry in  spring 1545.  Lennox did make an attempt against Dumbarton in November  with Donald Dubh.  They failed, and Donald died, without legitimate  issue, at Drogheda.  The Macleans, Macleods, and Macneils then came into  the national party.    In September 1545 Hertford, with an English force, destroyed the  religious houses at Melrose, Kelso, Dryburgh, and Jedburgh. {96}  Meanwhile the two Douglases skulked with the murderous traitor Cassilis  in Ayrshire, and Henry tried to induce French deserters from the Scottish  flag to murder Beaton and Arran.    Beaton could scarcely escape for ever from so many plots.  His capture,  in January 1546, of George Wishart, an eminently learned and virtuous  Protestant preacher, and an intimate associate of the murderous, double-  dyed traitor Brunston and of other Lothian pietists of the English party;  and his burning of Wishart at St Andrews, on March 1, 1546, sealed the  Cardinal's doom.  On May 29th he was surprised in his castle of St  Andrews and slain by his former ally, Norman Leslie, Master of Rothes,  with Kirkcaldy of Grange, and James Melville who seems to have dealt the  final stab after preaching at his powerless victim.  They insulted the  corpse, and held St Andrews Castle against all comers.    How gallant a fight Beaton had waged against adversaries how many and  multifarious, how murderous, self-seeking, treacherous, and hypocritical,  we have seen.  He maintained the independence of Scotland against the  most recklessly unscrupulous of assailants, though probably he was rather  bent on defending the lost cause of a Church entirely and intolerably  corrupt.    The two causes were at the moment inseparable, and, whatever we may think  of the Church of Rome, it was not more bloodily inclined than the Church  of which Henry was Pope, while it was less illogical, not being the  creature of a secular tyrant.  If Henry and his party had won their game,  the Church of Scotland would have been Henry's Church--would have been  Anglican.  Thus it was Beaton who, by defeating Henry, made Presbyterian  Calvinism possible in Scotland.          CHAPTER XVII.  REGENCY OF ARRAN.      The death of Cardinal Beaton left Scotland and the Church without a  skilled and resolute defender.  His successor in the see, Archbishop  Hamilton, a half-brother of the Regent, was more licentious than the  Cardinal (who seems to have been constant to Mariotte Ogilvy), and had  little of his political genius.  The murderers, with others of their  party, held St Andrews Castle, strong in its new fortifications, which  the queen-mother and Arran, the Regent, were unable to reduce.  Receiving  supplies from England by sea, and abetted by Henry VIII., the murderers  were in treaty with him to work all his will, while some nobles, like  Argyll and Huntly, wavered; though the Douglases now renounced their  compact with England, and their promise to give the child queen in  marriage to Henry's son.  At the end of November, despairing of success  in the siege, Arran asked France to send men and ships to take St Andrews  Castle from the assassins, who, in December, obtained an armistice.  They  would surrender, they said, when they got a pardon for their guilt from  the Pope; but they begged Henry VIII. to move the Emperor to move the  Pope to give no pardon!  The remission, none the less, arrived early in  April 1547, but was mocked at by the garrison of the castle. {99}    The garrison and inmates of the castle presently welcomed the arrival of  John Knox and some of his pupils.  Knox (born in Haddington, 1513-1515?),  a priest and notary, had borne a two-handed sword and been of the body-  guard of Wishart.  He was now invited by John Rough, the chaplain, to  take on him the office of preacher, which he did, weeping, so strong was  his sense of the solemnity of his duties.  He also preached and disputed  with feeble clerical opponents in the town.  The congregation in the  castle, though devout, were ruffianly in their lives, nor did he spare  rebukes to his flock.    Before Knox arrived, Henry VIII. and Francis II. had died; the successor  of Francis, Henri II., sent to Scotland Monsieur d'Oysel, who became the  right-hand man of Mary of Guise in the Government.  Meanwhile the advance  of an English force against the Border, where they occupied Langholm,  caused Arran to lead thither the national levies.  But this gave no great  relief to the besieged in the castle of St Andrews.  In mid-July a well-  equipped French fleet swept up the east coast; men were landed with guns;  French artillery was planted on the cathedral roof and the steeple of St  Salvator's College, and poured a plunging fire into the castle.  In a day  or two, on the last of July, the garrison surrendered.  Knox, with many  of his associates, was placed in the galleys and carried captive to  France.  On one occasion the galleys were within sight of St Andrews, and  the Reformer predicted (so he says) that he would again preach there--as  he did, to some purpose.    But the castle had not fallen before the English party among the nobles  had arranged to betray Scottish fortresses to England; and to lead 2000  Scottish \"favourers of the Word of God\" to fight under the flag of St  George against their country.  An English host of 15,000 was assembled,  and marched north accompanied by a fleet.  On the 9th of September 1547  the leader, Somerset, found the Scottish army occupying a well-chosen  position near Musselburgh: on their left lay the Firth, on their front a  marsh and the river Esk.  But next day the Scots, as when Cromwell  defeated them at Dunbar, left an impregnable position in their"]]]
