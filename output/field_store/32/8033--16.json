The tree produces  three, sometimes four crops in a year, and continues bearing for fifty  years, so that two or three trees are enough for a man's yearly  supply. Its timber, which at first is of a rich yellow, but afterwards  assumes the color of mahogany, is used in the building of houses and  canoes; the flowers, when dried, serve as tinder; the sap or juice  serves for glue; the inner bark is made, by the natives of some of the  islands of the Pacific Ocean, into a kind of cloth; and the leaves are  useful for many purposes. One species of the bread-fruit, called the  Jaca tree, grows chiefly on the mainland of Asia.         _Mainland_, the continent.      Describe the Jaca Tree.    This kind grows to the same, if not a larger size than the bread-fruit  of the islands, but is neither so palatable nor so nutritious; the  fruit often weighs thirty pounds, and contains two or three hundred  seeds, each four times as large as an almond. December is the time  when the fruit ripens; it is then eaten, but not much relished; the  seeds are also eaten when roasted. There are also other trees in  different parts of the world, mostly of the palm species, which yield  bread of a similar kind.      Is there not a tree which produces a substance resembling the Butter  which we make from the milk of the cow?    The Shea, or Butter Tree, a native of Africa: it is similar in  appearance to the American oak, and the fruit, (from the kernel of  which the butter is prepared,) is somewhat like an olive in form. The  kernel is inclosed in a sweet pulp, under a thin, green rind.      How is the Butter extracted?    The kernel, being taken out and dried in the sun, is boiled in water;  by which process a white, firm, and rich-flavored butter is produced,  which will keep for a whole year without salt. The growth and  preparation of this commodity is one of the first objects of African  industry, and forms a principal article of their trade with one  another.      You have given me an account of a useful Butter prepared from a plant;  is there not also a tree which can supply the want of a cow?    In South America there is a tree, the juice of which is a nourishing  milk; it is called the Cow Tree. This tree is very fine; the leaves  are broad, and some of them ten inches long; the fruit is rather  fleshy, and contains one or two nuts or kernels. The milk is very  abundant, and is procured by incisions made in the trunk of the tree;  it is tolerably thick, and of a glutinous quality, a pleasant taste,  and agreeable smell. The negroes and people at work on the farms drink  it, dipping into it their bread made of maize.         _Glutinous_, having the quality of glue,--an adhesive, gummy       substance, prepared from the skins of animals: it is used in       joining wood, &c., and for many other purposes.      What time of the day is the best for drawing the juice?    Sunrise; the blacks and natives then hasten from all quarters with  large bowls to receive the milk; some drink it on the spot, others  carry it home to their families.      What island possesses a remarkable substitute for the want of springs  of Water?    Ferro, one of the Canary Isles, situated in the Atlantic Ocean. In  this island there is no water, except on a part of the beach which is  nearly inaccessible; to supply the place of a fountain, Nature has  bestowed on the island a particular kind of tree, unknown in other  parts of the world. It is of a moderate size, with straight, long,  evergreen leaves; on its top a small cloud continually rests, which so  drenches the leaves with moisture, that it perpetually distils upon  the ground a stream of clear water. To these trees, as to perennial  springs, the inhabitants of Ferro repair, and are supplied with  abundance of water for themselves and cattle.         _Perennial_, lasting through the year, perpetual.      What is Licorice?    A plant, the juice of which is squeezed from the roots, and then  boiled with sugar, and used as a remedy for coughs, &c. Great  quantities are exported from Spain, Italy, &c. The dried root is of  great use in medicine, and makes an excellent drink for colds and  other affections of the lungs by boiling it with linseed.      What are the Lungs?    The organs of respiration in man and many other animals. There are two  of these organs, one on each side of the chest.         _Respiration_, breathing; the act of inhaling air into the lungs,       and again expelling it, by which animal life is supported.      What is Manna?    A sweet, white juice, oozing from the branches and leaves of a kind of  ash tree, growing chiefly in the southern parts of Italy, during the  heats of summer. When dry, it is very light, easily crumbled, and of a  whitish, or pale yellow color, not unlike hardened honey.      Is Manna peculiar to the Ash Tree of Southern Italy?    No. Manna is nothing more than the nutritious juices of the tree,  which exude during the summer heats; and what confirms this is, that  the very hot summers are always those which are most productive of  manna. Several different species of trees produce a kind of manna; the  best and most used is, however, that of Calabria, in Italy.      What are its uses?    It was much esteemed formerly in medicine, but it has now gone nearly  into disuse. The peasants of Mount Libanus eat it as others do honey.  The Bedouin Arabs consume great quantities, considering it the  greatest dainty their country affords. In Mexico, they are said to  have a manna which they eat as we do cheese. At Briancon, in France,  they collect it from all sorts of trees that grow there, and the  inhabitants observe, that such summers as produce the greatest  quantities of manna are very fatal to the trees, many of them  perishing in the winter.      Is there not another tree which produces Manna?    Yes: the Tamarisk, a tree peculiar to Palestine and parts of Arabia.  This remarkable substance is produced by several trees, and in various  countries of the East. On Mount Sinai there is a different species of  Tamarisk that yields it. It is found on the branches of the tree, and  falls on the ground during the heat of the day.      Where is Mount Libanus?    Mount Libanus, or Lebanon, is situated in Asiatic Turkey; it was  anciently famous for its large and beautiful cedar trees. The \"Cedars  of Lebanon\" are frequently mentioned in Holy Writ. There are now  scarcely any remaining of superior size and antiquity, but they vary  from the largest size down to mere saplings; and their numbers seem to  increase rather than diminish, there being many young trees springing  up.      How is Manna gathered?    From August to September, the Italians collect it in the following  manner, _viz._: by making an incision at the foot of the tree, each day  over that of the preceding, about four inches from one another: these  cuts, or incisions, are nearly two inches long, and half an inch deep.  When the cut is made, the manna directly begins to flow, at first like  clear water, but congealing as it flows, it soon becomes firm: this  they collect in baskets. Manna has been found to consist of two  distinct substances one nearly resembling sugar, the other similar to  a gum or mucilage.      What nation was fed with a kind of Manna?    The Children of Israel, when wandering in the desert wilderness, where  no food was to be procured, were fed by a miraculous supply of manna,  showered down from Heaven every morning on the ground in such  quantities as to afford sufficient food for the whole host.      What is Opium?    A narcotic, gummy, resinous juice, drawn from the head of the white  poppy, and afterwards thickened; it is brought over in dark, reddish  brown lumps, which, when powdered, become yellow.         _Narcotic_, producing sleep and drowsiness.      In what countries is it cultivated?    In many parts of Asia, India, and even the southern parts of Europe,  whence it is exported into other countries. The Turks, and other  Eastern nations, chew it. With us it is chiefly used in medicine. The  juice is obtained from incisions made in the seed-vessels of the  plant; it is collected in earthen pots, and allowed to become  sufficiently hard to be formed into roundish masses of about four  pounds weight. In Europe the poppy is cultivated mostly for the seeds.  Morphia and laudanum are medicinal preparations of opium.      What is Tobacco?    An herbaceous plant which flourishes in many temperate climates,  particularly in North America; it is supposed to have received its  name from Tabaco, a province of Mexico; it is cultivated in the West  Indies, the Levant, on the coast of Greece, in the Archipelago, Malta,  Italy, France, Ceylon, &c. It was not known in Europe till the  discovery of America by the Spaniards; and was carried to England  about the time of Queen Elizabeth, either by Sir Francis Drake or Sir  Walter Raleigh. Tobacco is either taken as snuff, smoked in pipes or  in the form of cigars, or chewed in the mouth like opium. There are  many different species of this plant, most of them natives of America,  some of the Cape of Good Hope and China. Tobacco contains a powerful  poison called nicotine.         _Herbaceous_, like an herb or plant, not a shrub or tree.      What part of the plant is used?    The leaves, which are stripped from the plant, and after being  moistened with water, are twisted up into rolls; these are cut up by  the tobacconist, and variously prepared for sale, or reduced into a  scented powder called snuff.      Who was Sir Francis Drake?    Sir Francis Drake was a distinguished naval officer, who flourished in  the reign of Elizabeth. He made his name immortal by a voyage into the  South Seas, through the Straits of Magellan; which, at that time, no  Englishman had ever attempted. He died on board his own ship in the  West Indies, 1595.      Who was Sir Walter Raleigh?    Sir Walter"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16737"],[0,"International Language, Past, Present & Future (#15)"],[1,"by pure race prejudice. He _did_  claim that mutual incomprehensibility amongst men who thus dwell side by  side and should be taking part in a common civic life was one powerful  influence in keeping up cliques and divisions, and artificially holding  asunder those whom common interests should be joining together. It is  hard to refuse credence to this power of language, thus moderately  stated.       [1]There were bad massacres about that time in Warsaw, where Dr.     Zamenhof lives. During the Congress news came of the assassination     of one of the chief civic officials of Warsaw.                                        XIX                            LITERARY _v._ COMMERCIAL    Another vexed question is whether it is advisable to run an  international language on a literary or a commercial ticket.  On this rock Volapük split--                                       A brave vessel,             That had no doubt some noble creature in her,             Dashed all to pieces;[1]    and there was no Prospero to conjure away the tempest and send everybody  safe home to port to speak Volapük happily ever afterwards. The moral  is, that it is no good to make exaggerated claims for a universal  language. To attempt to set it on a fully equal footing with national  languages as a literary medium is to court disaster.       [1]Shakespeare, _The Tempest_.    The truth seems to be about this. As a potential means of international  communication, Esperanto is unsurpassed, and a long way ahead of any  national language. As a literary language, it is far better than Chinook  or Pidgin, far worse than English or Greek.    A language, no more than a man, can serve two masters. By attempting to  combine within itself this double function an international language  would cease to attain either object. The reason is simple.    Its legitimate and proper sphere demands of it as the first essential  that it should be easy and universally accessible. This means that the  words are to be few, and must have but one clearly marked sense each.  There are to be no idioms or set phrases, no words that depend upon  their context or upon allusion for their full sense.    On the other hand, among the essentials of a literary language are the  exact opposites of all these characteristics. The vocabulary must be  full and plenteous, and there should be a rich variety of synonyms;  there should be delicate half-tones and _nuances_; the words should be  not mere counters or symbols of fixed value, determinable in each case  by a rapid use of the dictionary alone, but must have an atmosphere,  a something dependent upon history, usage, and allusion, by virtue of  which the whole phrase, in the finer styles of writing, amounts to more  than the sum of the individual meanings of the words which it contains,  becoming a separate entity with an individual flavour of its own. To  attempt to create this atmosphere in an artificial language is not  only futile, but would introduce just the difficulties, redundancies,  and complications which it is its chief object to avoid. Take a single  instance, Macbeth's--                             Nay, this my hand would rather                  The multitudinous seas incarnadine,                  Making the green one red.    Here the effect is produced by the contrast between the stately march of  the long Latin words of thundrous sound, and the short, sharp English. A  labour-saving language has no business with such words as \"incarnadine\"  or \"multitudinous.\" In translating such a passage it will reproduce the  sense faithfully and clearly, if necessary by the combination of simple  roots; but the bouquet of the original will vanish in the process. This  is inevitable, and it is even so far an advantage that it removes all  ground from the argument that a universal language will kill scholarly  language-learning. It will be just as necessary as ever to read works of  fine literature in the original, in order to enjoy their full savour;  and the translation into the common tongue will not prejudice such  reading of originals more than, or indeed so much as, translations into  various mother-tongues.    Again, take the whole question of the imitative use of language. In  national literatures many a passage, poetry or prose, is heightened  in effect by assonance, alliteration, a certain movement or rhythm of  phrase. Subtle suggestion slides in sound through the ear and falls  with mellowing cadence into the heart. Soothed senses murmur their own  music to the mind; the lullaby lilt of the lay swells full the linked  sweetness of the song.    The How plays fostering round the What. Down the liquid stream of  lingual melody the dirge drifts dying--dying it echoes back into a  ghostly after-life, as the yet throbbing sense wakes the drowsed mind  once more. The Swan-song floats double--song and shadow; and in the  blend--half sensuous, half of thought--man's nature tastes fruition.    Now, this verbal artistry, whereby the words set themselves in tune to  the thoughts, postulates a varied vocabulary, a rich storehouse wherein  a man may linger and choose among the gems of sound and sense till he  find the fitting stone and fashion it to one of those--                                         jewels five-words long,              That on the stretched forefinger of all Time              Sparkle for ever.    But the word-store of an international tongue must not be a golden  treasury of art, a repository of \"bigotry and virtue.\" On its orderly  rows of shelves must be immediately accessible the right word for the  right place: no superfluity, no disorder, no circumambient margin for  effect. Homocea-like, it \"touches the spot,\" and having deadened the  ache of incomprehensibility, has done its task. \"No flowers.\"    Naturally some peoples will feel themselves more cramped in a new  artificial language than others. French, incomparably neat and clear  within its limits, but possessing the narrowest \"margin for effect,\"  is less alien in its genius from Esperanto than is English, with its  twofold harmony, its potentiality (too rarely exploited) of Romance  clarity, and its double portion of Germanic vigour and feeling. Yet all  languages must probably witness the obliteration of some finer native  shades in the international tongue.    But we must not go to the opposite extreme, and deny to the universal  language all power of rendering serious thought. Just how far it  can go, and where its inherent limitations begin, is a matter of  individual taste and judgment. There are Esperanto translations--and  good ones--of _Hamlet_, _The Tempest_, _Julius Caesar_, the _Aeneid_ of  Virgil, parts of Molière and Homer, besides a goodly variety of other  literature. These translations do succeed in giving a very fair idea of  the originals, as any one can test for himself with a little trouble,  but, as pointed out, they must come something short in beauty and  variety of expression.    There is even a certain style in Esperanto itself in the hands of a good  writer, of which the dominant notes are simplicity and directness--two  qualities not at all to be despised. Further, the unlimited power of  word-building and of forming terse compounds gives the language an  individuality of its own. It contains many expressive self-explanatory  words whose meaning can only be conveyed by a periphrasis in most  languages,[1] and this causes it to take on the manner and feel of a  _living_ tongue, and makes it something far more than a mere copy or  barren extract of storied speech.       [1]e.g. _samideano_ = partisan of the same cause or idea. _vivipova     lingvo_ = language capable of independent vigorous existence.    Technically, the fulness of its participial system, rivalled by Greek  alone, and the absence of all defective verbs, lend to it a very great  flexibility; and containing, as it does, a variety of specially neat  devices borrowed from various tongues, it is in a sense neater than any  of them.    One great test of its capacity for literary expression remains to be  made. This is an adequate translation of the Bible. A religious society,  famed for the variety of its translations of the Scriptures into every  conceivable language, when approached on the subject, replied that  Esperanto was not a language. But Esperantists will not \"let it go  at that.\" Besides Dr. Zamenhof's own _Predikanto_ (Ecclesiastes), an  experiment has been made by two Germans, who published a translation  of St. Matthew's Gospel. It is not a success, and further experiments  have just been made by Prof. Macloskie, of Princeton, U.S.A., and by E.  Metcalfe, M.A. (Oxon), I cannot say with what result, not having seen  copies.[1]       [1]Cf. also now the \"Ordo de Diservo\" (special Anglican Church     service), selected and translated from Prayer Book and Bible for     use in England by the Rev. J. C. Rust (obtainable from the British     Esperanto Association, 13, Arundel Street, Strand, price _7d._).    From one point of view, the directness and simplicity of the Bible would  seem to lend themselves to an Esperanto dress; but there are certain  great difficulties, such as technical expressions, archaic diction, and  phrases hallowed by association. A meeting of those interested in this  great work will take place at Cambridge during the Congress (August  1907). Experimenters in this field will there be brought together from  all countries, the subject will be thoroughly discussed, and substantial  progress may be hoped for.    In the field of rendering scientific literature and current workaday  prose, whose matter is of more moment than its form, Esperanto has  already won its spurs. Its perfect lucidity makes it particularly  suitable for this form of writing.    The conclusion then is, that Esperanto is neither wholly commercial nor  yet literary in the full sense in which a grown language is literary;  but it does do what it professes to do, "]]]
