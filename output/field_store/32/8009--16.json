Still however we advanced slowly; other lives depended on our exertions;  and whenever I reminded the men of this for a minute or two they  quickened their pace. Pale, wasted, and weak, we still crawled onwards in  the straight line for Perth, which I assured them they would reach on  Saturday night or Sunday morning.    RIVER OF RUNNING WATER. PASS THE MOORE RIVER.    About two hours and a half after starting we crossed the southern branch  of the Moore River, which was running strong; but the rain, which had  only just ceased, prevented our being thirsty.    The whole of this day's route lay over hills similar to those we had  found yesterday. We moved on, occasionally halting for a few minutes,  until it was so dark we could no longer see, and then laid down, having  again this day tasted no food.    MISERY FROM RAIN AND COLD.    It rained hard all night and our miseries of the last one were repeated.  We were also less able to bear them, being weaker from longer abstinence.  This day we travelled about one-and-twenty miles.    DESPONDING FEELINGS.    April 20.    This morning we rose again, weak and stiffened from the cold and wet;  life had long ceased to have any charms for me, and I fancy that the  others must have experienced a similar feeling. A disinclination to move  pervaded the whole, and I had much the same desire to sink into the sleep  of death, that one feels to take a second slumber of a morning after  great fatigue. My life was not worth the magnitude of the effort that it  cost me to move; but other lives depended on mine, so I rose up weak and  giddy and by degrees induced the rest to start also. Poor Coles however  was in a dreadful state.    The country through which we were travelling is intersected by a long  line of lakes which run nearly parallel to the sea for a distance of  about forty-five miles. One of the party had travelled in the same  direction with me before, but we had then kept along the edge of the  lakes. He had imagined however that they were only two or three miles  distant from the sea, whereas many of them were as much as eight or ten.  The route we were pursuing was about midway between the lakes and the  sea, and this man seeing nothing of the lakes could not be convinced that  I was right in the position I said we then were; for I assured the men  they were not more than twenty-seven or twenty-eight miles to the north  of Perth; but I heard him relating his doubts, which tended to discourage  the others very much.    A PARTY OF NATIVES.    We however walked on as well as we could until near noon, at which time,  from excessive weakness, we had not made more than eight miles, or about  a mile and a quarter an hour, when we suddenly came out on the bed of a  dried-up swamp, now looking like a desert of white sand studded with  reeds. The forms of natives were seen wandering about this, one mile from  us, who were searching for frogs. There was a very numerous party, and  they did not appear at all inclined to approach us. Now it was very  evident that if we were so near Perth as I imagined these natives must be  well acquainted with Europeans; for although but very little was known of  the country to the north of Perth, and the farthest settlement in that  direction was only four miles from the town, still the natives must, from  mere curiosity, have been frequently in the settlement.    JOYFUL INTERVIEW WITH A FRIENDLY TRIBE. KAIBER'S OPINION OF THEM.    We therefore approached them but as we came near they withdrew. Kaiber  was now called into consultation; he scrutinised them long and carefully,  and then announced that they were \"mondak yoongar,\" wild natives; and,  after a second survey of them, declared that they had the \"mondak kurrang  kombar,\" or great bush fury, on them, or rather, were subject to wild  untutored rage. After making this announcement he squatted down under a  bush to conceal himself, and then recapitulating rapidly all the dangers  we had gone through, conjured me not to bring him into a fresh scrape by  having anything to do with such a numerous party of his countrymen in our  present weak state.    The men, who understood enough of what he was saying to know that he  thought these natives had never seen Europeans, became extremely uneasy  and begged me to allow them to fire a gun as a signal to them: \"For if we  are so near Perth as you suppose, Sir,\" they said to me, \"these natives  will come to us.\" Kaiber hereupon told me that the instant the gun was  fired he should run away. This was rather too ridiculous a threat when  the coward was afraid to move five yards from us; I therefore ordered a  gun to be fired, and then, telling the men to remain steady and prepared  in case of accident, I walked off towards the natives, Kaiber, in the  meanwhile, sitting on his haunches under cover, muttering to himself,  \"The swan, the big head, the stone forehead;\" and, as these denunciations  reached me, I could not, even in all my misery, forbear smiling at them.    DISCOVERED TO BE FRIENDS.    The natives no sooner heard the gun and saw me approaching than they came  running to me. Presently Kaiber called out to me, \"Mr. Grey, Mr. Grey,  nadjoo watto, nginnee yalga nginnow,\" \"Mr. Grey, Mr. Grey, I am going to  them; you sit here a little;\" and he then, with his long thin ungainly  legs, bounded by me like a deer. \"Imbat, friend,\" I heard him cry out, as  a young man came running up to him. I grew giddy; I knew Imbat by name,  and felt assured that at all events the lives of a great portion of my  party were safe. In a few minutes Kaiber had given an outline of our  adventures and present state. Fearing such mischances as had really  happened to me, I had, previously to my departure to the north, done my  utmost to cultivate the friendship of the northern natives; and most of  them, even to the distance of sixty or seventy miles from Perth in that  direction, had received presents from me. My name was well known amongst  them as a tried friend, although indeed my common denomination was  \"Wokeley brudder,\" or Oakley's brother; for, from my giving them flour,  they concluded that I was a relation of the baker of that name at Perth.    HOSPITABLE RECEPTION BY THEM.    The women were soon called up, bark baskets of frogs opened for us, by-yu  nuts roasted, and as a special delicacy I obtained a small fresh-water  tortoise. \"Now, friend, sleep whilst I cook,\" said Imbat, and lighting a  fire he made me lie down and try to slumber whilst he roasted some frogs  and the turtle for me. I was not over-well pleased at the skill he chose  to exhibit in his cookery, for he thereby delayed me for a longer time  than was agreeable, but we were all soon regaling on this native fare.    Anxious questions were put by the men as to their distance from Perth,  and the natives all told them they would see it the next morning, \"whilst  the sun was still small;\" and on further enquiry it turned out that a  kangaroo hunter of the name of Porley was at a hut distant only seven  miles from us, and according to the account of the natives he had a  supply of provisions with him. As soon therefore as I had a little  recruited my strength I started on with Imbat to the hut, leaving the men  to follow in company with the other natives as rapidly as their strength  would allow them. Imbat carried my gun and everything but a book or two  and my papers, which, being precious documents, I had never trusted out  of my own possession, however heavy my labours and misfortunes had been.  He moved merrily along, trying to win me from my moody thoughts by  relating all the news of the settlement both as concerned the Europeans  and natives; for like all other idle people the natives are great gossips  and really love a little scandal. Worn out from fatigue, I was rather  petulant and ill-tempered, but Imbat talked on unmindful of this, or only  laughed at me, and jeered me for it.    IMBAT'S NOTIONS.    My intentions in going on were to have everything prepared for the men on  their arrival at the hut; but when I reached it I found it deserted, the  owner having returned to Perth. I however lit a fire and laid down, Imbat  again beginning to cook, and then chattering: \"What for do you who have  plenty to eat and much money walk so far away in the bush?\" I felt  amazingly annoyed at this question and therefore did not answer him. \"You  are thin,\" said he, \"your shanks are long, your belly is small, you had  plenty to eat at home, why did you not stop there?\" I was vexed at his  personalities, besides which it is impossible to make a native understand  our love of travel. I therefore replied, \"Imbat, you comprehend nothing,  you know nothing.\" \"I know nothing!\" answered he; \"I know how to keep  myself fat; the young women look at me and say, Imbat is very handsome,  he is fat. They will look at you and say, He not good, long legs, what do  you know? where is your fat? what for do you know so much if you can't  keep fat? I know how to stay at home and not to walk too far in the bush.  Where is your fat?\" \"You know how to talk; long tongue;\" was my reply;  upon which Imbat, forgetting his anger, burst into a roar of laughter,  and saying, \"and I know how to make you fat,\" began stuffing me with  frogs, barde, and by-yu nuts. The rest of the party arrived just before  nightfall, and, searching the hut, found a paper of tea, and an old tin  pot in which they cooked some, and then eating frogs, etc., for their  supper, we all laid down to sleep, and in the silence of the night I  rendered fervent thanks to my Maker who had again brought us so near the  haven where we would be.\"    OPINIONS OF THE MEN REGARDING THE FATE OF OUR OTHER PARTY.    April 21.    It had rained all night but we had been a little sheltered by the hut;  though from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16160"],[0,"The Treasury of Ancient Egypt (#15)"],[1," the hermit was almost entirely unknown to the  nation in dynastic times. It was only in the Ptolemaic and Roman periods  that asceticism came to be practised; and some have thought that its  introduction into Egypt is to be attributed to the preaching of the  Hindoo missionaries sent from India to the court of the Ptolemies. It is  not really an Egyptian characteristic; and its practice did not last for  more than a few centuries.    The religious teachings of the Egyptians before the Ptolemaic era do not  suggest that the mortification of the flesh was a possible means of  purifying the spirit. An appeal to the senses and to the emotions,  however, was considered as a legitimate method of reaching the soul. The  Egyptians were passionately fond of ceremonial display. Their huge  temples, painted as they were with the most brilliant colours, formed  the setting of processions and ceremonies in which music, rhythmic  motion, and colour were brought to a point of excellence. In honour of  some of the gods dances were conducted; while celebrations, such as the  fantastic Feast of Lamps, were held on the anniversaries of religious  events. In these gorgeously spectacular ceremonies there was no place  for anything sombre or austere, nor could they have been conceived by  any but the most life-loving temperaments.    As in his religious functions, so in his home, the Egyptian regarded  brilliancy and festivity as an edification. When in trouble or  distress, he was wont to relieve his mind as readily by an appeal to the  vanities of this world as by an invocation of the powers of Heaven.  Thus, when King Sneferu, of Dynasty IV., was oppressed with the cares of  state, his councillor Zazamankh constructed for him a pleasure boat  which was rowed around a lake by the most beautiful damsels obtainable.  And again, when Wenamon, the envoy of Herhor of Dynasty XXI., had fallen  into trouble with the pirates of the Mediterranean, his depression was  banished by a gift of a dancing-girl, two vessels of wine, a young goat  of tender flesh, and a message which read--\"Eat and drink, and let not  thy heart feel apprehension.\"    An intense craving for brightness and cheerfulness is to be observed on  all sides, and the attempt to cover every action of life with a kind of  lustre is perhaps the most apparent characteristic of the race. At all  times the Egyptians decked themselves with flowers, and rich and poor  alike breathed what they called \"the sweet north wind\" through a screen  of blossoms. At their feasts and festivals each guest was presented with  necklaces and crowns of lotus-flowers, and a specially selected bouquet  was carried in the hands. Constantly, as the hours passed, fresh flowers  were brought to them, and the guests are shown in the tomb paintings in  the act of burying their noses in the delicate petals with an air of  luxury which even the conventionalities of the draughtsman cannot hide.  In the women's hair a flower was pinned which hung down before the  forehead; and a cake of ointment, concocted of some sweet-smelling  unguent, was so arranged upon the head that, as it slowly melted, it  re-perfumed the flower. Complete wreaths of flowers were sometimes worn,  and this was the custom as much in the dress of the home as in that of  the feast. The common people also arrayed themselves with wreaths of  lotuses at all galas and carnivals. The room in which a feast was held  was decorated lavishly with flowers. Blossoms crept up the delicate  pillars to the roof; garlands twined themselves around the tables and  about the jars of wine; and single buds lay in every dish of food. Even  the dead were decked in their tombs with a mass of flowers, as though  the mourners would hide with the living delights of the earth the misery  of the grave.    The Egyptian loved his garden, and filled it with all manner of  beautiful flowers. Great parks were laid out by the Pharaohs, and it is  recorded of Thutmosis III. that he brought back from his Asiatic  campaigns vast quantities of rare plants with which to beautify Thebes.  Festivals were held at the season when the flowers were in full bloom,  and the light-hearted Egyptian did not fail to make the flowers talk to  him, in the imagination, of the delights of life. In one case a fig-tree  is made to call to a passing maiden to come into its shade.         \"Come,\" it says, \"and spend this festal day, and       to-morrow, and the day after to-morrow, sitting in my       shadow. Let thy lover sit at thy side, and let him       drink.... Thy servants will come with the       dinner-things--they will bring drink of every kind, with       all manner of cakes, flowers of yesterday and of to-day,       and all kinds of refreshing fruit.\"    Than this one could hardly find a more convincing indication of the  gaiety of the Egyptian temperament. In the eighteenth and nineteenth  centuries A.D. the people were so oppressed that any display of luxury  was discouraged, and a happy smile brought the tax-gatherer to the door  to ascertain whether it was due to financial prosperity. But the  carrying of flowers, and other indications of a kind of unworried  contentment, are now again becoming apparent on all sides.      [Illustration: PL. IX.

Brugsch Pasha._      The affection displayed by the Egyptians for bright colours would alone  indicate that their temperament was not melancholic. The houses of the  rich were painted with colours which would be regarded as crude had they  appeared in the Occident, but which are admissible in Egypt where the  natural brilliancy of the sunshine and the scenery demands a more  extreme colour-scheme in decoration. The pavilions in which the nobles  \"made a happy day,\" as they phrased it, were painted with the most  brilliant wall-decorations, and the delicately-shaped lotus columns  supporting the roof were striped with half a dozen colours, and were  hung with streamers of linen. The ceilings and pavements seem to have  afforded the artists a happy field for a display of their originality  and skill, and it is on these stretches of smooth-plastered surface that  gems of Egyptian art are often found. A pavement from the palace of  Akhnaton at Tell el Amarna shows a scene in which a cow is depicted  frisking through the reeds, and birds are represented flying over the  marshes. In the palace of Amenhotep III. at Gurneh there was a ceiling  decoration representing a flight of doves, which, in its delicacy of  execution and colouring, is not to be classed with the crude forms of  Egyptian decoration, but indicates an equally light-hearted temperament  in its creator. It is not probable that either bright colours or  daintiness of design would emanate from the brains of a sombre-minded  people.    Some of the feminine garments worn in ancient Egypt were exceedingly  gaudy, and they made up in colour all that they lacked in variety of  design. In the Middle and New Empires the robes of the men were as  many-hued as their wall decorations, and as rich in composition. One may  take as a typical example the costume of a certain priest who lived at  the end of Dynasty XVIII. An elaborate wig covers his head; a richly  ornamented necklace surrounds his neck; the upper part of his body is  clothed in a tunic of gauze-like linen; as a skirt there is swathed  around him the most delicately coloured fine linen, one end of which is  brought up and thrown gracefully over his arm; decorated sandals cover  his feet and curl up over his toes; and in his hand he carries a  jewelled wand surmounted by feathers. It would be an absurdity to state  that these folds of fine linen hid a heart set on things higher than  this world and its vanities. Nor do the objects of daily use found in  the tombs suggest any austerity in the Egyptian character. There is no  reflection of the Underworld to be looked for in the ornamental bronze  mirrors, nor smell of death in the frail perfume pots. Religious  abstraction is not to be sought in lotus-formed drinking-cups, and  mortification of the body is certainly not practised on golden chairs  and soft cushions. These were the objects buried in the tombs of the  priests and religious teachers.    The puritanical tendency of a race can generally be discovered by a  study of the personal names of the people. The names by which the  Egyptians called their children are as gay as they are pretty, and lack  entirely the Puritan character. \"Eyes-of-love,\" \"My-lady-is-as-gold,\"  \"Cool-breeze,\" \"Gold-and-lapis-lazuli,\" \"Beautiful-morning,\" are  Egyptian names very far removed from \"Through-trials-and-tribulations-  we-enter-into-the-Kingdom-of-Heaven Jones,\" which is the actual name  of a now living scion of a Roundhead family. And the well-known  \"Praise-God Barebones\" has little to do with the Egyptian \"Beautiful-  Kitten,\" \"Little-Wild-Lion,\" \"I-have-wanted-you,\" \"Sweetheart,\" and  so on.    The nature of the folk-tales is equally indicative of the temperament  of a nation. The stories which have come down to us from ancient Egypt  are often as frivolous as they are quaint. Nothing delighted the  Egyptians more than the listening to a tale told by an expert  story-teller; and it is to be supposed that such persons were in as much  demand in the old days as they are now. One may still read of the  adventures of the Prince who was fated to die by a dog, a snake, or a  crocodile; of the magician who made the waters of the lake heap  themselves up that he might descend to the bottom dry-shod to recover a  lady's jewel; of the fat old wizard who could cut a man's head off and  join it again to his body; of the fairy godmothers who made presents to  a new-born babe; of the shipwrecked sailor who was thrown up on an  "]]]
