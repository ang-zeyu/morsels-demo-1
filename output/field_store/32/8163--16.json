I am aware of the  incalculable blessings that must await the termination of a collective  enterprise which, by the range and quality of the sacrifices it entailed,  deserves to be ranked among the most outstanding examples of Baha'i  solidarity ever since those deeds of brilliant heroism immortalized the  memory of the heroes of Nayriz, of Zanjan, and of Tabarsi. I appeal to  you, therefore, friends and fellow-disciples of Baha'u'llah, for a more  abundant measure of self-sacrifice, for a higher standard of concerted  effort, for a still more compelling evidence of the reality of the faith  that glows within you.    And in this fervent plea, my voice is once more reinforced by the  passionate, and perhaps, the last, entreaty, of the Greatest Holy Leaf,  whose spirit, now hovering on the edge of the Great Beyond, longs to carry  on its flight to the Abha Kingdom, and into the presence of a Divine, an  almighty Father, an assurance of the joyous consummation of an enterprise,  the progress of which has so greatly brightened the closing days of her  earthly life. That the American believers, those stout-hearted pioneers of  the Faith of Baha'u'llah, will unanimously respond, with that same  spontaneous generosity, that same measure of self-sacrifice, as have  characterized their response to her appeals in the past, no one who is  familiar with the vitality of their faith can possibly question.    Would to God that by the end of the spring of the year 1933 the multitudes  who, from the remote corners of the globe, will throng the grounds of the  Great Fair to be held in the neighborhood of that hallowed shrine may, as  a result of your sustained spirit of self-sacrifice, be privileged to gaze  on the arrayed splendor of its dome--a dome that shall stand as a flaming  beacon and a symbol of hope amidst the gloom of a despairing world.    Your true brother,  SHOGHI    Haifa, Palestine,  March 21, 1932            AMERICA AND THE MOST GREAT PEACE          America and the Most Great Peace      To the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout  the United States and Canada.    Friends and fellow-promoters of the Faith of God:    Forty years will have elapsed ere the close of this coming summer since  the name of Baha'u'llah was first mentioned on the American continent.  Strange indeed must appear to every observer, pondering in his heart the  significance of so great a landmark in the spiritual history of the great  American Republic, the circumstances which have attended this first public  reference to the Author of our beloved Faith. Stranger still must seem the  associations which the brief words uttered on that historic occasion must  have evoked in the minds of those who heard them.    Of pomp and circumstance, of any manifestations of public rejoicing or of  popular applause, there were none to greet this first intimation(1) to  America's citizens of the existence and purpose of the Revelation  proclaimed by Baha'u'llah. Nor did he who was its chosen instrument  profess himself a believer in the indwelling potency of the tidings he  conveyed, or suspect the magnitude of the forces which so cursory a  mention was destined to release.    Announced through the mouth of an avowed supporter of that narrow  ecclesiasticism which the Faith itself has challenged and seeks to  extirpate, characterized at the moment of its birth as an obscure offshoot  of a contemptible creed, the Message of the Most Great Name, fed by  streams of unceasing trial and warmed by the sunshine of 'Abdu'l-Baha's  tender care, has succeeded in driving its roots deep into America's genial  soil, has in less than half a century sent out its shoots and tendrils as  far as the remotest corners of the globe, and now stands, clothed in the  majesty of the consecrated Edifice it has reared in the heart of that  continent, determined to proclaim its right and vindicate its capacity to  redeem a stricken people. Unsupported by any of the advantages which  talent, rank and riches can confer, the community of the American  believers, despite its tender age, its numerical strength, its limited  experience, has by virtue of the inspired wisdom, the united will, the  incorruptible loyalty of its administrators and teachers achieved the  distinction of an undisputed leadership among its sister communities of  East and West in hastening the advent of the Golden Age anticipated by  Baha'u'llah.    And yet how grave the crises which this infant, this blessed, community  has weathered in the course of its checkered history! How slow and painful  the process that gradually brought it forth from the obscurity of  unmitigated neglect to the broad daylight of public recognition! How  severe the shocks which the ranks of its devoted adherents have sustained  through the defection of the faint in heart, the malice of the  mischief-maker, the treachery of the proud and the ambitious! What storms  of ridicule, of abuse and of calumny its representatives have had to face  in their staunch support of the integrity, and their valiant defense of  the fair name, of the Faith they had espoused! How persistent the  vicissitudes and disconcerting the reverses with which its privileged  members, young and old alike, individually and collectively, have had to  contend in their heroic endeavors to scale the heights which a loving  Master had summoned them to attain!    Many and powerful have been its enemies who, as soon as they discovered  the evidences of the growing ascendancy of its declared supporters, have  vied with one another in hurling at its face the vilest imputations and in  pouring out upon the Object of its devotion the vials of their fiercest  wrath. How often have these sneered at the scantiness of its resources and  the seeming stagnation of its life! How bitterly they ridiculed its  origins and, misconceiving its purpose, dismissed it as a useless  appendage of an expiring creed! Have they not in their written attacks  stigmatized the heroic person of the Forerunner of so holy a Revelation as  a coward recanter, a perverted apostate, and denounced the entire range of  His voluminous writings as the idle chatter of a thoughtless man? Have  they not chosen to ascribe to its divine Founder the basest motives which  an unscrupulous plotter and usurper can conceive, and regarded the Center  of His Covenant as the embodiment of ruthless tyranny, a stirrer of  mischief, and a notorious exponent of expediency and fraud? Its  world-unifying principles these impotent enemies of a steadily-rising  Faith have time and again denounced as fundamentally defective, have  pronounced its all-embracing program as utterly fantastic, and regarded  its vision of the future as chimerical and positively deceitful. The  fundamental verities that constitute its doctrine its foolish ill-wishers  have represented as a cloak of idle dogma, its administrative machinery  they have refused to differentiate from the soul of the Faith itself, and  the mysteries it reveres and upholds they have identified with sheer  superstition. The principle of unification which it advocates and with  which it stands identified they have misconceived as a shallow attempt at  uniformity, its repeated assertions of the reality of supernatural  agencies they have condemned as a vain belief in magic, and the glory of  its idealism they have rejected as mere utopia. Every process of  purification whereby an inscrutable Wisdom chose from time to time to  purge the body of His chosen followers of the defilement of the  undesirable and the unworthy, these victims of an unrelenting jealousy  have hailed as a symptom of the invading forces of schism which were soon  to sap its strength, vitiate its vitality, and complete its ruin.    Dearly-beloved friends! It is not for me, nor does it seem within the  competence of any one of the present generation, to trace the exact and  full history of the rise and gradual consolidation of this invincible arm,  this mighty organ, of a continually advancing Cause. It would be premature  at this early stage of its evolution, to attempt an exhaustive analysis,  or to arrive at a just estimate, of the impelling forces that have urged  it forward to occupy so exalted a place among the various instruments  which the Hand of Omnipotence has fashioned, and is now perfecting, for  the execution of His divine Purpose. Future historians of this mighty  Revelation, endowed with pens abler than any which its present-day  supporters can claim to possess, will no doubt transmit to posterity a  masterly exposition of the origins of those forces which, through a  remarkable swing of the pendulum, have caused the administrative center of  the Faith to gravitate, away from its cradle, to the shores of the  American continent and towards its very heart--the present mainspring and  chief bulwark of its fast evolving institutions. On them will devolve the  task of recording the history, and of estimating the significance, of so  radical a revolution in the fortunes of a slowly maturing Faith. Theirs  will be the opportunity to extol the virtues and to immortalize the memory  of those men and women who have participated in its accomplishment. Theirs  will be the privilege of evaluating the share which each of these  champion-builders of the World Order of Baha'u'llah has had in ushering in  that golden Millennium, the promise of which lies enshrined in His  teachings.    Does not the history of primitive Christianity and of the rise of Islam,  each in its own way, offer a striking parallel to this strange phenomenon  the beginnings of which we are now witnessing in this, the first century  of the Baha'i Era? Has not the Divine Impulse which gave birth to each of  these great religious systems been driven, through the operation of those  forces which the irresistible growth of the Faith itself had released, to  seek away from the land of its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19300"],[0,"A Traveler's Narrative Written to Illustrate the Episode of the Báb (#15)"],[1," of [God's] servants and produce horror in those who are in all  lands; but rather will he practice such deeds as will cause the adhesion  of mankind. So it hath been demonstrated that detestable actions have been  and will be [wrought only] by ignorant persons. We ask God to keep His  servants from regarding aught but Him, and to bring them near to Him:  verily He is potent over all things.    \"Glory be to Thee, O God! O My God, Thou hearest My groaning, and seest My  state and My distress and My affliction, and knowest what is in My soul.  If My cry be sincerely for Thy sake, then draw thereby the hearts of Thy  creatures unto the horizon of the heaven of Thy recognition, and turn the  King unto the right hand of the throne of Thy Name the Merciful; then  bestow on him, O My God, the blessing which hath descended from the heaven  of Thy favor and the clouds of Thy mercy, that he may sever himself from  that which he hath and turn toward the region of Thy bounties. O Lord,  help him to support the oppressed amongst [Thy] servants, and to raise up  Thy Word amidst Thy people; then aid him with the hosts of the unseen and  the seen, that he may subdue cities in Thy Name and rule over all who are  upon the earth by Thy power and authority, O Thou in Whose hand is the  Kingdom of creation: and verily Thou art He who ruleth at the beginning  and in the end: there is no God save Thee, the Potent, the Mighty, the  Wise.    \"They have misrepresented matters before the presence of the King in such  a way that if any ill deed proceed from any one of this sect they account  it as [a part] of the religion of these servants. But, by God, beside Whom  there is none other God, this Servant hath not sanctioned the committing  of sins, much less that whereof the prohibition hath been explicitly  revealed in the Book of God! God hath prohibited unto men the drinking of  wine, and the unlawfulness thereof hath been revealed and recorded in the  Book of God,(35) and the doctors of the age (may God multiply the like of  them) have unanimously prohibited unto men this abominable action; yet  withal do some commit it. Now the punishment of this action falls on these  heedless persons, while those manifestations of the glory of sanctity  [continue] holy and undefiled: unto their sanctity all Being, whether of  the unseen or the seen, testifieth.    \"Yea, these servants [of God] regard God as 'doing what He pleaseth and  ordering what He willeth.'(36) There is no retreat nor way of flight for  anyone save unto God, and no refuge nor asylum but in Him. And at no time  hath the caviling of men, whether learned or unlearned, been a thing to  rely on, nor will it be so. The [very] prophets, who are the pearls of the  Ocean of Unity and the recipients of Divine Revelation, have [ever] been  the objects of men's aversion and caviling; much more these servants. Even  as He saith: 'Every nation schemed against their apostle to catch him. And  they contended with falsehood therewith to refute the truth.'(37) So  likewise He saith, 'There came not unto them any apostle but they mocked  at him.'(38) Consider the appearance of the Seal of the Prophets, the King  of the Elect (the soul of the worlds be His sacrifice); after the dawning  of the Sun of Truth from the horizon of the Hijaz what wrongs befell that  Manifestation of the Might of the Lord of Glory at the hands of the people  of error! So heedless were men that they were wont to consider the  vexation of that Holy One as one of the greatest of good works and as the  means of approaching God Most High. For in the first years the doctors of  that age, whether Jews or Christians, turned aside from that Sun of the  Highest Horizon; and, at the turning aside of those persons, all, whether  humble or noble, girt up their loins to quench the radiance of that Light  of the Horizon of Ideals. The names of all are recorded in books: amongst  them were Wahb ibn Rahib, Ka'b ibn A_sh_raf, 'Abdu'llah [ibn] Ubayy, and  the like of these persons; till at length the matter reached such a point  that they convened a meeting to take counsel as to the shedding of the  most pure blood of that Holy One, as God (glorious is His mention) hath  declared: 'And when those who misbelieved plotted against thee to confine  thee, or slay thee, or drive thee out; and they plotted, and God plotted;  and God is the best of plotters.'(39) So likewise He saith: 'And if their  aversion be grievous unto thee, then, if thou art able to seek out a hole  down into the earth, or a ladder up into the sky, that thou mayest show  them a sign--[do so]: but if God pleased He would assuredly bring them all  to the true guidance: be not therefore one of the ignorant.'(40) By God,  the hearts of those near [unto God] are scorched at the purport of these  two blessed verses; but the like of these matters certainly transmitted  [to Us] are blotted out of sight, and [men] have not reflected, neither do  reflect, what was the reason of the turning aside of [God's] servants at  the appearance of the daysprings of divine lights.    \"So, too, before the Seal of the Prophets, consider Jesus the Son of Mary.  After the appearance of that Manifestation of the Merciful One all the  doctors charged that Quintessence of Faith with misbelief and  rebelliousness; until at length, with the consent of Annas, who was the  chief of the doctors of that age, and likewise Caiaphas,(41) who was the  most learned of the judges, they wrought upon that Holy One that which the  pen is ashamed and unable to repeat. The earth with its amplitude was too  strait for Him, until God took Him up into the heaven. But were a detailed  account of the prophets to be submitted it is feared that weariness might  result.    \"O would that thou mightest permit, O King, that We should send unto Thy  Majesty that whereby eyes would be refreshed, souls tranquilized, and  every just person assured that with Him [i.e., Baha'u'llah] is knowledge  of the Book. Were it not for the turning aside of the ignorant and the  willful blindness of the doctors, verily I would utter a discourse whereat  hearts would be glad and would fly unto the air from the murmur of whose  winds is heard, 'There is no God but He.' But now, because the time  admitteth it not, the tongue is withheld from utterance, and the vessel of  declaration is sealed until God shall unclose it by His power: verily He  is the Potent, the Powerful.    \"Glory be to Thee, O God! O My God, I ask of Thee in Thy Name, whereby  Thou hast subdued whomsoever is in the heavens and the earth, that Thou  wilt keep the lamp of Thy religion with the glass of Thy power and Thy  favors, so that the winds of denial pass not by it from the region of  those who are heedless of the mysteries of Thy Sovereign Name: then  increase its light by the oil of Thy wisdom: verily Thou art Potent over  whomsoever is in Thy earth and Thy heaven.    \"O Lord, I ask of Thee by the Supreme Word, whereat whosoever is in the  earth and the heaven feareth save him who taketh hold of the 'Most Firm  Handle,'(42) that Thou wilt not abandon Me amongst Thy creatures: lift Me  up unto Thee, and make Me to enter in under the shadow of Thy mercy, and  give Me to drink of the pure wine of Thy grace, that I may dwell under the  canopy of Thy glory and the domes of Thy favors: verily Thou art powerful  unto that Thou wishest, and verily Thou art the Protecting, the  Self-Sufficing.    \"O King! The lamps of justice are extinguished, and the fire of  persecution is kindled on all sides, until that they have made My people  captives. This is not the first honor which hath been violated in the way  of God. It behooveth everyone to regard and recall what befell the kindred  of the Prophet until that the people made them captives and brought them  in unto Damascus the spacious; and amongst them was the Prince of  Worshipers, the Stay of the elect, the Sanctuary of the eager (the soul of  all beside him be his sacrifice). It was said unto them, 'Are ye  seceders?' He said, 'No, by God, we are servants who have believed in God  and in His signs, and through us the teeth of faith are disclosed in a  smile, and the sign of the Merciful One shineth forth; through our mention  spreadeth Al-Batha,(43) and the darkness which intervened between earth  and heaven is dispelled.' It was said, 'Have ye forbidden what God hath  sanctioned, or sanctioned what God hath forbidden?' He said, 'We were the  first who followed the commandments of God: we are the source of command  and its origin, and the firstfruits of all good and its consummation: we  are the sign of the Eternal, and His commemoration amongst the nations.'  It was said, 'Have ye abandoned the Qur'an?' He said, 'Through us did the  Merciful One reveal it; and we are gales of the All-Glorious amidst [His]  creatures; we are streams which have arisen from the most mighty Ocean  whereby God revived the earth after its death; from us His signs are  diffused, His evidences are manifested, and His tokens appear; and with us  are His mysteries and His secrets.' It was said, 'For what fault [then]  were ye afflicted?' He said, 'For the love of God and our severance from  all beside Him.'    \"Verily We have not repeated his expressions (upon him be peace), but  rather We have made manifest a spray from the Ocean of Life which was  deposited in his words, that by it those who advance may live and be aware  of what hath befallen the trusted ones of God on the part of an evil and  most reprobate people. And today We see the people censuring those who  acted unjustly of yore, while they oppress more vehemently than those  oppressed, and know it not. By God, I do not desire sedition, but the  purification of [God's] servants from all that withholdeth them from  approach to God, the King of the Day of Invocation.    \"I was asleep on My couch: the breaths of My Lord the Merciful passed over  Me and awakened Me from sleep: to this bear witness"]]]
