The Mahayanist scriptures are still a living force. In Nepal the nine  Dharmas receive superstitious homage rather than intelligent study,  but in Tibet and the Far East the Prajna-paramita, the Lotus and the  sutras about Amitabha are in daily use for public worship and private  reading. I have heard the first-named work as well as the  Leng-yen-ching expounded, that is, read aloud with an extempore  paraphrase, to lay congregations in China, and the section of it  called the Diamond Cutter is the book which is most commonly in the  hands of religious Tibetans. The Lotus is the special scripture of the  Nichiren sect in Japan but is universally respected. The twenty-fourth  chapter which contains the praises of Avalokita is often printed  separately. The Amitabha sutras take the place of the New Testament  for the Jodo and Shin sects and copies of them may also be found in  almost every monastery throughout China and Annam. The Suvarna-prabhasa  is said to be specially popular among the Mongols. I know Chinese  Buddhists who read the Hua-yen (Avatamsaka) every day. Modern Japanese  writers quote frequently from the Lankavatara and Kasyapa-parivarta  but I have not met with any instance of these works being in popular  use.    I have mentioned already the obscurity surrounding the history of the  Mahayanist Canon in India and it may seem to throw doubt on the  authenticity of these scriptures. Unauthentic they certainly are in  the sense that European criticism is not likely to accept as  historical the discourses which they attribute to the Buddha and  others, but there is no reason to doubt that they are treatises  composed in India early in our era and representing the doctrines then  prevalent. The religious public of India has never felt any difficulty  in accepting works of merit--and often only very moderate merit--as  revelations, whether called Upanishads, Puranas, Sutras or what not.  Only rarely have such works received any formal approbation, such as  recognition by a council. Indeed it is rather in Ceylon, Burma, Tibet  and China than in India itself that authoritative lists of scriptures  have been compiled. The natural instinct of the Hindus was not to  close the Canon but to leave it open for any additions which might be  vouchsafed.    Two sketches of an elastic Mahayanist Canon of this kind are  preserved, one in the Sikshasamuccaya[155] attributed to Santideva,  who probably flourished in the seventh century, and the other in a  little work called the Duration of the Law, reporting a discourse by  an otherwise unknown Nandimitra, said to have lived in Ceylon 800  years after the Buddha's death.[156] The former is a compendium of  doctrine illustrated by quotations from what the author regarded as  scripture. He cites about a hundred Mahayanist sutras, refers to the  Vinaya and Divyavadana but not apparently to the Abhidharma. He  mentions no Tantras[157] and not many Dharanis.    The second work was translated by Hsuean Chuang and was therefore  probably written before 600 A.D.[158] Otherwise there is no external  evidence for fixing its date. It represents Nandimitra as explaining  on his deathbed the steps taken by the Buddha to protect the True Law  and in what works that Law is to be found. Like the Chinese Tripitaka  it recognizes both Mahayanist and Hinayanist works, but evidently  prefers the former and styles them collectively Bodhisattva-Pitaka.  It enumerates about fifty sutras by name, beginning with the  Prajna-paramita, the Lotus and other well-known texts. Then comes a  list of works with titles ending in Samadhi, followed by others called  Paripriccha[159] or questions. A new category seems to be formed by  the Buddhavatamsaka-sutra with which the sutras about Amitabha's  Paradise are associated. Then comes the Mahasannipata-sutra associated  with works which may correspond to the Ratnakuta division of the  Chinese Canon.[160] The writer adds that there are \"hundreds of  myriads of similar sutras classified in groups and categories.\" He  mentions the Vinaya and Abhidharma without further particulars,  whereas in describing the Hinayanist versions of these two Pitakas he  gives many details.    The importance of this list lies in the fact that it is Indian rather  than in its date, for the earliest catalogue of the Chinese Tripitaka  compiled about[161] 510 is perhaps older and certainly ampler. But if  the catalogue stood alone, it might be hard to say how far the  selection of works in it was due to Chinese taste. But taking the  Indian and Chinese evidence together, it is clear that in the sixth  century Indian Mahayanists (_a_) tolerated Hinayanist scriptures while  preferring their own, (_b_) made little use of the Vinaya or  Abhidharma for argument or edification, though the former was very  important as a code, (_c_) recognized extremely numerous sutras,  grouped in various classes such as Mahasannipata and Buddhavatamsaka,  (_d_) and did not use works called Tantras. Probably much the same is  true of the fourth century and even earlier, for Asanga in one  work[162] quotes both Maha-and Hinayanist scriptures and among the  former cites by name seventeen sutras, including one called  Paripriccha or questions.

They must be always the same, Socrates, replied Cebes.    And what would you say of the many beautiful--whether men or horses or  garments or any other things which are named by the same names and may  be called equal or beautiful,--are they all unchanging and the same  always, or quite the reverse? May they not rather be described as almost  always changing and hardly ever the same, either with themselves or with  one another?    The latter, replied Cebes; they are always in a state of change.    And these you can touch and see and perceive with the senses, but  the unchanging things you can only perceive with the mind--they are  invisible and are not seen?    That is very true, he said.    Well, then, added Socrates, let us suppose that there are two sorts of  existences--one seen, the other unseen.    Let us suppose them.    The seen is the changing, and the unseen is the unchanging?    That may be also supposed.    And, further, is not one part of us body, another part soul?    To be sure.    And to which class is the body more alike and akin?    Clearly to the seen--no one can doubt that.    And is the soul seen or not seen?    Not by man, Socrates.    And what we mean by 'seen' and 'not seen' is that which is or is not  visible to the eye of man?    Yes, to the eye of man.    And is the soul seen or not seen?    Not seen.    Unseen then?    Yes.    Then the soul is more like to the unseen, and the body to the seen?    That follows necessarily, Socrates.    And were we not saying long ago that the soul when using the body as an  instrument of perception, that is to say, when using the sense of sight  or hearing or some other sense (for the meaning of perceiving through  the body is perceiving through the senses)--were we not saying that the  soul too is then dragged by the body into the region of the changeable,  and wanders and is confused; the world spins round her, and she is like  a drunkard, when she touches change?    Very true.    But when returning into herself she reflects, then she passes into the  other world, the region of purity, and eternity, and immortality, and  unchangeableness, which are her kindred, and with them she ever lives,  when she is by herself and is not let or hindered; then she ceases  from her erring ways, and being in communion with the unchanging is  unchanging. And this state of the soul is called wisdom?    That is well and truly said, Socrates, he replied.    And to which class is the soul more nearly alike and akin, as far as may  be inferred from this argument, as well as from the preceding one?    I think, Socrates, that, in the opinion of every one who follows the  argument, the soul will be infinitely more like the unchangeable--even  the most stupid person will not deny that.    And the body is more like the changing?    Yes.    Yet once more consider the matter in another light: When the soul and  the body are united, then nature orders the soul to rule and govern, and  the body to obey and serve. Now which of these two functions is akin to  the divine? and which to the mortal? Does not the divine appear to you  to be that which naturally orders and rules, and the mortal to be that  which is subject and servant?    True.    And which does the soul resemble?    The soul resembles the divine, and the body the mortal--there can be no  doubt of that, Socrates.    Then reflect, Cebes: of all which has been said is not this the  conclusion?--that the soul is in the very likeness of the divine,  and immortal, and intellectual, and uniform, and indissoluble, and  unchangeable; and that the body is in the very likeness of the human,  and mortal, and unintellectual, and multiform, and dissoluble, and  changeable. Can this, my dear Cebes, be denied?    It cannot.    But if it be true, then is not the body liable to speedy dissolution?  and is not the soul almost or altogether indissoluble?    Certainly.    And do you further observe, that after a man is dead, the body, or  visible part of him, which is lying in the visible world, and is  called a corpse, and would naturally be dissolved and decomposed and  dissipated, is not dissolved or decomposed at once, but may remain for a  for some time, nay even for a long time, if the constitution be sound at  the time of death, and the season of the year favourable? For the body  when shrunk and embalmed, as the manner is in Egypt, may remain almost  entire through infinite ages; and even in decay, there are still  some portions, such as the bones and ligaments, which are practically  indestructible:--Do you agree?    Yes.    And is it likely that the soul, which is invisible, in passing to the  place of the true Hades, which like her is invisible, and pure, and  noble, and on her way to the good and wise God, whither, if God will, my  soul is also soon to go,--that the soul, I repeat, if this be her nature  and origin, will be blown away and destroyed immediately on quitting the  body, as the many say? That can never be, my dear Simmias and Cebes.  The truth rather is, that the soul which is pure at departing and draws  after her no bodily taint, having never voluntarily during life had  connection with the body, which she is ever avoiding, herself gathered  into herself;--and making such abstraction her perpetual study--which  means that she has been a true disciple of philosophy; and therefore  has in fact been always engaged in the practice of dying? For is not  philosophy the practice of death?--    Certainly--    That soul, I say, herself invisible, departs to the invisible world--to  the divine and immortal and rational: thither arriving, she is secure of  bliss and is released from the error and folly of men, their fears and  wild passions and all other human ills, and for ever dwells, as they say  of the initiated, in company with the gods (compare Apol.). Is not this  true, Cebes?    Yes, said Cebes, beyond a doubt.    But the soul which has been polluted, and is impure at the time of her  departure, and is the companion and servant of the body always, and is  in love with and fascinated by the body and by the desires and pleasures  of the body, until she is led to believe that the truth only exists in  a bodily form, which a man may touch and see and taste, and use for the  purposes of his lusts,--the soul, I mean, accustomed to hate and fear  and avoid the intellectual principle, which to the bodily eye is dark  and invisible, and can be attained only by philosophy;--do you suppose  that such a soul will depart pure and unalloyed?    Impossible, he replied.    She is held fast by the corporeal, which the continual association and  constant care of the body have wrought into her nature.    Very true.    And this corporeal element, my friend, is heavy and weighty and earthy,  and is that element of sight by which a soul is depressed and dragged  down again into the visible world, because she is afraid of the  invisible and of the world below--prowling about tombs and sepulchres,  near which, as they tell us, are seen certain ghostly apparitions  of souls which have not departed pure, but are cloyed with sight and  therefore visible.    (Compare Milton, Comus:--         'But when lust,       By unchaste looks, loose gestures, and foul talk,       But most by lewd and lavish act of sin,       Lets in defilement to the inward parts,       The soul grows clotted by contagion,       Imbodies, and imbrutes, till she quite lose,       The divine property of her first being.       Such are those thick and gloomy shadows damp       Oft seen in charnel vaults and sepulchres,       Lingering, and sitting by a new made grave,       As loath to leave the body that it lov'd,       And linked itself by carnal sensuality       To a degenerate and degraded state.')    That is very likely, Socrates.    Yes, that is very likely, Cebes; and these must be the souls, not of the  good, but of the evil, which are compelled to wander about such places  in payment of the penalty of their former evil way of life; and they  continue to wander until through the craving after the corporeal which  never leaves them, they are imprisoned finally in another body. And they  may be supposed to find their prisons in the same natures which they  have had in their former lives.    What natures do you mean, Socrates?    What I mean is that men who have followed after gluttony, and  wantonness, and drunkenness, and have had no thought of avoiding them,  would pass into asses and animals of that sort. What do you think?    I think such an opinion to be exceedingly probable.    And those who have chosen the portion of injustice, and tyranny, and  violence, will pass into wolves, or into hawks and kites;--whither else  can we suppose them to go?    Yes, said Cebes; with such natures, beyond question.    And there is no difficulty, he said, in assigning to all of them places  answering to their several natures and propensities?    There is not, he said.    Some are happier than others; and the happiest both in themselves and  in the place to which they go are those who have practised the civil and  social virtues which are called temperance and justice, and are acquired  by habit and attention without philosophy and mind. (Compare Republic.)    Why are they the happiest?    Because they may be expected to pass into some gentle and social kind  which is like their own, such as bees or wasps or ants, or back again  into the form of man, and just and moderate men may be supposed to  spring from them.    Very likely.    No one who has not studied philosophy and who is not entirely pure at  the time of his departure is allowed to enter the company of the Gods,  but the lover of knowledge only. And this is the reason, Simmias and  Cebes, why the true votaries of philosophy abstain from all fleshly  lusts, and hold out against them and refuse to give themselves up to  them,--not because they fear poverty or the ruin of their families, like  the lovers of money,"]]]
