Geoffroy took up this idea with enthusiasm, seeing in it  a further application of his master-idea of the unity of plan and  composition. By means of this comparison Mollusca definitely took their  place in the _Echelle des etres_, after the Articulata, just as Geoffroy  had maintained in 1820, saying that crabs formed a link between the  other Crustacea and the molluscs.[94] The comparison brought him nearer  to the end he had in view, the reference of all animal structure to one  single type.    But in championing the memoir of Meyranx and Laurencet, Geoffroy found  himself in direct antagonism with Cuvier, who held that his four  \"Embranchements\" had each a separate and distinct plan of structure. In  a paper read to the Academy in February 1830,[95] Cuvier easily  demolished the crude comparison of the Cephalopod to the Vertebrate. He  gave diagrams of the internal organs of a Cephalopod and of a Vertebrate  bent back in the manner indicated by Meyranx and Laurencet, and he  showed in detail that the arrangement of the main organs was quite  different, that the likeness would have been much greater if the  Cephalopod had been likened to a Vertebrate doubled up the other way,[96]  but that even then the arrangement of the organs would not be the same.  The organs, too, of the Cephalopod are differently constructed. He sums  up his criticism by saying:--\"I give true and summary expression to all  these facts when I say that Cephalopods have several organs in common  with Vertebrates, which fulfil in either case similar functions, but  that these organs are differently arranged with respect to one another,  and often constructed in a different way; that they are in Cephalopods  accompanied by several other organs which Vertebrates do not possess,  whilst the latter on their side have many organs which Cephalopods lack\"  (p. 257). Geoffroy could not accept this commonsense view of the matter,  but made a fight for his transcendental theories. This was the beginning  of the famous controversy between Geoffroy and Cuvier which so excited  the interest of Goethe. It was a struggle between \"comparative anatomy\"  and \"morphology,\" between the commonsense teleological view of structure  and the abstract, transcendental. Geoffroy brought forward all his  theories on the homology of the skeleton of fish with the skeleton of  higher Vertebrates, and tried to prove by them his great principle of  the unity of plan and composition; Cuvier took Geoffroy's homologies one  by one, and showed how very slight was their foundation. Cuvier was on  sure ground in insisting upon the observable diversities of structural  type, and his vast knowledge enabled him to score a decisive victory.[97]    The controversy was not, as we are sometimes told, a controversy between  a believer in evolution and an upholder of the fixity of species,  although it raised a question upon which evolution theory was to throw  some light.    In these Darwinian days Geoffroy has reaped a little posthumous glory as  an early believer in evolution. That he did believe in evolution to a  limited extent is certain; that his theory of evolution was, as it were,  a by-product of his life-work, is also certain. Geoffroy was primarily a  morphologist and a seeker after the unity hidden under the diversity of  organic form. His theory of evolution had as good as no influence upon  his morphology, for he did not to any extent interpret unity of plan as  being due to community of descent. His morphological, non-evolutionary  standpoint comes out quite clearly in several places in the _Philosophie  anatomique_. He does not derive the structure of the higher Vertebrates  from the simpler structure of the lower, but when he finds in fish a  part at the maximum of its development, he speaks of the same part,  rudimentary in the higher forms, as being, as it were, held in reserve  for use in the fish. Thus, speaking of the episternal in fish which  forms the central piece of its sternum, he says, \"it is a bone that is  rudimentary in birds (one might almost add a bone that is held in  reserve in birds for this fate) which is destined to form in the centre  the principal keel of this new machine\" (p. 84). Again, with reference  to the homology of the ossicles of the ear with the opercular bones in  fish, \"employing other resources equally hidden and rudimentary, Nature  makes profitable use of the four tiny ossicles lodged in the auditory  passage, and, raising them in fish to the greatest possible dimensions,  forms from them these broad opercula....\" (p. 85). Or you may take it  the other way about, and start from the organisation of fishes;  opercular bones are of no use to air-breathing animals, so they dwindle  away, and are pressed into the service of the ear, although they are of  little use in hearing (p. 46).    There is here no thought of evolution; in later years, however, his  researches upon fossil crocodilians led him to consider the possibility  that the living species were descended from the antediluvian. For the  factors of the transformation he refers to Lamarck's hypotheses.[98] In a  memoir of 1828,[99] dealing with the possible genetic relation of living  to fossil species, he still regards the question as more or less open.  Although fossil species are mostly different from living species are we  therefore to conclude, he asks, that they are not the ancestors of the  present day forms? \"The contrary idea arises more naturally in the mind;  for otherwise the six-days' creation would have had to be repeated and  new beings produced by a fresh creation. Now this proposition, contrary  as it is to the most ancient historical traditions, is inadmissible\" (p.  210). It is sufficiently clear from this quotation that Geoffroy was  thinking only of a transformation of the antediluvian species created by  God, and by no means of an evolution of all species from one primitive  type. In matters of religion Geoffroy was orthodox. He goes on to point  out how great a resemblance there is in essential structure between  fossil and living species. All find their place in one scheme of  classification; does it not seem that all are modifications \"of one  single being, of that abstract being or common type, which it is always  possible to denote by the same name?\" (p. 211). This type is abstract,  not actual, and it is certainly not conceived as an original ancestor of  all animals.    The fullest development of Geoffroy's views on evolution is found in his  memoir \"Le degre d'influence du monde ambiant pour modifier les formes  animales.\"[100] Here the relation of his evolution-theory to his  morphology is pointed out. The principle of unity of plan and  composition cannot be the final goal of zoology; there must follow on it  a philosophical study of the _differences_ between organic forms. The  causes of these differences are to be found in the environment (pp.  66-7). Geoffroy seems here to be moving from a pure to a causal  morphology. It is probable, he continues, that living species have  descended by uninterrupted generation from the antediluvian species (p.  74), and that they have in the process become modified through external  influences.    Now of all functions respiration is the most important, and upon  respiration everything is regulated. \"If it be admitted that the slow  progression of the centuries has brought in its train successive changes  in the proportion of the different elements of the atmosphere, it  follows as a rigorously necessary consequence that the organisation has  been proportionately influenced by them\" (p. 76). The respiratory milieu  changes, the species change with it, or are eliminated (p. 79). We may  see, perhaps, in the stress which Geoffroy lays upon respiration and the  respiratory milieu a result of his constant obsession with the  comparison of fish with air-breathing Vertebrates.    In the first geological period, we read in another Memoir of the same  year,[101] when ammonites and _Gryphaea_ flourished, hot-blooded animals  with lungs could not exist. \"A lung constructed like that of mammals and  birds would not have been adapted to the essence of the respiratory  element such as in my conception of it the system of the environing air  used to be\"[102] (p. 58).    Geoffroy does not tell us exactly how the milieu is to act upon the  organism; the whole theory is little more than a sketch and a pointing  out of the way for future research--and in this prophetic enough. The  action of external agents was apparently considered as physical, and no  power of active adaptation was ascribed to the organism.    From a passage in the memoir \"Sur la Vertebre\" we may perhaps infer that  he believed increasing complexity of structure to be due to a  realisation of potentialities, to the development of parts present in  the lower animals only in potency--\"the organisation ... only awaits  favourable conditions to rise, by addition of parts, from the simplicity  of the first formations to the complication of the creatures at the head  of the scale\" (p. 112). Evolution takes place as the environment allows,  and in a sense in opposition to the environment.    He believed in saltatory evolution, for he considered that the lower  oviparous Vertebrates could not be transformed into birds by slow  modification, but only by a sudden transformation of their lungs, which  would bring about the other characteristics of birds (p. 80). He  considered, too, that transformations could arise by means of monstrous  development (p. 86). In this connection the experiments which he made on  the hen's egg[103] in order to produce artificial monstrosities are  significant, though his purpose was rather to obtain proof of the  inadequacy of the preformation hypothesis.[104]    It seems probable enough"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20439"],[0,"Susan B. Anthony (#15)"],[1,"n's rights work demanded immediate attention. \"They talk of  sending two companies of Lecturers into this state,\" she wrote Lucy,  \"wish me to lay out the route of each one and accompany one. They seem  to think me possessed of a vast amount of executive ability. I shrink  from going into Conventions where speaking is expected of me.... I  know they want me to help about finance and that part I like and am  good for nothing else.\"[70]    She also had the farm home on her mind. With her father in the  insurance business, her brothers now both in Kansas, her sister Mary  teaching in the Rochester schools and \"looking matrimonially-wise,\"  and her mother at home all alone, Susan often wondered if it might not  be as much her duty to stay there to take care of her mother and  father as it would be to make a home comfortable for a husband.  Sometimes the quietness of such a life beckoned enticingly. But after  the disappointing November elections which put into the presidency the  conservative James Buchanan, from whom only a vacillating policy on  the slavery issue could be expected, she wrote Samuel May, Jr., the  secretary of the American Antislavery Society, \"I shall be very glad  if I am able to render even the most humble service to this cause.  Heaven knows there is need of earnest, effective radical workers. The  heart sickens over the delusions of the recent campaign and turns  achingly to the unconsidered _whole question_.\"[71]    His reply came promptly, \"We put all New York into your control and  want your name to all letters and your hand in all arrangements.\"    For $10 a week and expenses, Susan now arranged antislavery meetings,  displayed posters bearing the provocative words, \"No Union with  Slaveholders,\" planned tours for a corps of speakers, among them  Stephen and Abby Kelley Foster, Parker Pillsbury, and two free  Negroes, Charles Remond and his sister, Sarah.    In debt from her last woman's rights campaign, she could not afford a  new dress for these tours, but she dyed a dark green the merino which  she had worn so proudly in Canajoharie ten years before, bought cloth  to match for a basque, and made a \"handsome suit.\" \"With my Siberian  squirrel cape, I shall be very comfortable,\" she noted in her  diary.[72]    She had met indifference and ridicule in her campaigns for woman's  rights. Now she faced outright hostility, for northern businessmen had  no use for abolition-mad fanatics, as they called anyone who spoke  against slavery. Abolitionists, they believed, ruined business by  stirring up trouble between the North and the South.    Usually antislavery meetings turned into debates between speakers and  audience, often lasting until midnight, and were charged with  animosity which might flame into violence. All of the speakers lived  under a strain, and under emotional pressure. Consequently they were  not always easy to handle. Some of them were temperamental, a bit  jealous of each other, and not always satisfied with the tours Susan  mapped out for them. She expected of her colleagues what she herself  could endure, but they often complained and sometimes refused to  fulfill their engagements.    When no one else was at hand, she took her turn at speaking, but she  was seldom satisfied with her efforts. \"I spoke for an hour,\" she  confided to her diary, \"but my heart fails me. Can it be that my  stammering tongue ever will be loosed?\"    Lucy Stone, who spoke with such ease, gave her advice and  encouragement. \"You ought to cultivate your power of expression,\" she  wrote. \"The subject is clear to you and you ought to be able to make  it so to others. It is only a few years ago that Mr. Higginson told me  he could not speak, he was so much accustomed to writing, and now he  is second only to Phillips. 'Go thou and do likewise.'\"[73]    In March 1857, the Supreme Court startled the country with the Dred  Scott decision, which not only substantiated the claim of  Garrisonians that the Constitution sanctioned slavery and protected  the slaveholder, but practically swept away the Republican platform of  no extention of slavery in the territories. The decision declared that  the Constitution did not apply to Negroes, since they were citizens of  no state when it was adopted and therefore had not the right of  citizens to sue for freedom or to claim freedom in the territories;  that the Missouri Compromise had always been void, since Congress did  not have the right to enact a law which arbitrarily deprived citizens  of their property.    Reading the decision word for word with dismay and pondering  indignantly over the cold letter of the law, Susan found herself so  aroused and so full of the subject that she occasionally made a  spontaneous speech, and thus gradually began to free herself from  reliance on written speeches. She spoke from these notes: \"Consider  the fact of 4,000,000 slaves in a Christian and republican  government.... Antislavery prayers, resolutions, and speeches avail  nothing without action.... Our mission is to deepen sympathy and  convert into right action: to show that the men and women of the North  are slaveholders, those of the South slave-owners. The guilt rests on  the North equally with the South. Therefore our work is to rouse the  sleeping consciousness of the North....[74]    \"We ask you to feel as if you, yourselves, were the slaves. The  politician talks of slavery as he does of United States banks, tariff,  or any other commercial question. We demand the abolition of slavery  because the slave is a human being and because man should not hold  property in his fellowman.... We say disobey every unjust law; the  politician says obey them and meanwhile labor constitutionally for  repeal.... We preach revolution, the politicians, reform.\"    Instinctively she reaffirmed her allegiance to the doctrine, \"No Union  with Slaveholders,\" and she gloried in the courage of Garrison,  Phillips, and Higginson, who had called a disunion convention,  demanding that the free states secede. It was good to be one of this  devoted band, for she sincerely believed that in the ages to come \"the  prophecies of these noble men and women will be read with the same  wonder and veneration as those of Isaiah and Jeremiah inspire  today.\"[75]    She gave herself to the work with religious fervor. Even so, she could  not make her antislavery meetings self-supporting, and at the end of  the first season, after paying her speakers, she faced a deficit of  $1,000. This troubled her greatly but the Antislavery Society,  recognizing her value, wrote her, \"We cheerfully pay your expenses and  want to keep you at the head of the work.\" They took note of her  \"business enterprise, practical sagacity, and platform ability,\" and  looked upon the expenditure of $1,000 for the education and  development of such an exceptional worker as a good investment.    This new experience was a good investment for Susan as well. She made  many new friends. She won the further respect, confidence, and good  will of men like William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, and Francis  Jackson. Her friendship with Parker Pillsbury deepened. \"I can truly  say,\" she wrote Abby Kelley Foster, \"my spirit has grown in grace and  that the experience of the past winter is worth more to me than all my  Temperance and Woman's Rights labors--though the latter were the  school necessary to bring me into the Antislavery work.\"[76]    Only the crusading spirit of the \"antislavery apostles\"[77] and what  to them seemed the desperate state of the nation made the hard  campaigning bearable. The animosity they faced, the cold, the poor  transportation, the long hours, and wretched food taxed the physical  endurance of all of them. \"O the crimes that are committed in the  kitchens of this land!\"[78] wrote Susan in her diary, as she ate heavy  bread and the cake ruined with soda and drank what passed for coffee.  A good cook herself, she had little patience with those who through  ignorance or carelessness neglected that art. Equally bad were the  food fads they had to endure when they were entertained in homes of  otherwise hospitable friends of the cause. Raw-food diets found many  devotees in those days, and often after long cold rides in the  stagecoach, these tired hungry antislavery workers were obliged to sit  down to a supper of apples, nuts, and a baked mixture of coarse bran  and water. Nor did breakfast or dinner offer anything more. Facing  these diets seemed harder for the men than for Susan. Repeatedly in  such situations, they hurried away, leaving her to complete two-or  three-day engagements among the food cranks. How she welcomed a good  beefsteak and a pot of hot coffee at home after these long days of  fasting!    A night at home now was sheer bliss, and she wrote Lucy Stone, \"Here  I am once more in my own Farm Home, where my weary head rests upon my  own home pillows.... I had been gone _Four Months_, scarcely sleeping  the second night under the same roof.\"[79]    It was good to be with her mother again, to talk with her father when  he came home from work and with Mary who had not married after all but  continued teaching in the Rochester schools. Guelma and her husband,  Aaron McLean, who had moved to Rochester, often came out to the farm  with their children.    Turning for relaxation to work in the garden in the warm sun, Susan  thought over the year's experience and planned for the future. \"I can  but acknowledge to myself that Antislavery has made me richer and  braver in spirit,\" she wrote Samuel May, Jr., \"and that it is the  school of schools for the true and full development of the nobler  elements of life. I find my raspberry field looking finely--also my  strawberry bed. The prospect for peaches, cherries, plums, apples, and  pears is very promising--Indeed all nature is clothed in her most  hopeful dress. It really seems to me that the trees and the grass and  the large fields of waving grain did "]]]
