His highness expressed great satisfaction for the present; and  when I told him to take care it was not broken, he observed: \"I will  take especial care of this thing, because there is none like it in this  country, and it cannot be repaired.\" He told us also that his ladies  could play at draughts. I gave him, besides, a piece of green silk for a  shade for his eyes. He went off immediately, gratified with these little  presents.    The weather is very pleasant for the study of languages, but the days  are too short and the nights are too long. Nevertheless, I sleep nearly  all night this cold weather.    _13th._--Thermometer at sunrise in the open air was 41 deg. 30' Fahr., so  that the cold increases, this being the lowest which I have yet taken.  The Germans have had a deal of trouble with Mohammed of Tunis; they  would send him back, but there is no opportunity of doing so.    Maguzawa and Azna are the names of the pagan nations of Soudan, denoting  the same people, and not different races. The names answer to the word  _Kurdi_, in Bornou. These pagans say, in derision of the Muslims, when  it rains, \"Allah must have a large belly,\" that so much water falls from  him.    En-Noor describes pagans of Maradee drinking large quantities of _gia_  (beer, or fermented liquor).    This evening a Gadamsee arrived at the tents, bringing two or three  slaves from Damerghou. He says the news of our arrival had already  reached Damerghou--that it was reported there that the Sultan of Aghadez  had given Barth a black tobe; not, by any means, a bad rumour. He sends  his slaves to Ghat from this place, and returns immediately to  Damerghou, taking letters for us to Zinder.          CHAPTER VI.

En-Noor paid us a visit in the afternoon, and was  exceedingly civil. He promises me letters for Sakkatou, and to forward  Overweg to Maradee.    Our servant shot a large vulture to-day. En-Noor having bad eyes,  ordered the eyes of this bird of prey to be scooped out for a medicine.  This is not the first time that I have heard of the various parts of  animals being eaten, or otherwise used, to cure or strengthen the  corresponding parts in human beings. It seems to be an idea natural to  people in a rude or semi-barbarous state.    En-Noor related a pretty anecdote of himself and his younger days in our  tent to-day. After saying, that formerly the Asbenouee people were the  only folks considered bad in these parts, he observed, that now he  himself and the Asbenouee were certainly much improved in their manners  and dispositions; \"for,\" added he, \"there were once four fighis  (charm-writers) who employed people to speak against me, and bring me  into disrepute. What did I do? I called them to me, gave them fine  presents of burnouses and a great supper, with an apartment in which to  pass the night. But when they were fast asleep I dug a large hole,  fetched them all out of the room, killed them, and covered them up in  the hole. Now, however,\" continued his highness, \"we do not go so far as  this, but content ourselves with taking away an enemy's camels.\"    _15th._--Weather cold this morning. Thermometer at sunrise, 43 deg.. I hang  the thermometer on the tent-ropes, just outside, at about a foot from  the ground.    Hamma (son-in-law of En-Noor) returned this morning from the  salt-caravan. He marked on the sand that the caravan would be  thirty-five days before it returned; so, I imagine, we have still from  this time some thirty days to wait here. He left the caravan on its  entering the Hamadah, between this and Bilma.      TOWNS AND VILLAGES OF TESAOUA.    (_From Amankee's relation._)    1. Tesaoua: people 1400; residence of the governor. Two large wells and  one small one.    2. Harmaua: 500. A little water.    3. Ungua Korna: 400. One well, much water.    4. Haidaua: 500. One well, and much water.    5. Nuwala: 500 or 600. No water; but only half an hour from Haidaua.    6. Nachira: 800, scattered about in small groups. Much water.    7. Ungua-guka: 500. One well.    8. Ungua-tallai: 400. Much water.    9. Gindaua: 1000. Large wells; few trees.    10. Saulawa: 40 or 50.    The capital and nearly all this country is full of trees. Not a stone is  to be seen, and the soil is sandy.    The Sultan, or Governor of Tesaoua, is subject to the sovereign of  Maradee, who is the only independent black prince in this part of  Africa. The inhabitants are mixed, pagans and Muslims, but these last  are not bigoted.    En-Noor visited us this evening, and I asked him if he recollected  earthquakes in this country. The old Sheikh emphatically replied,  _Babo_, \"There are none.\"    _16th._--Barth has picked up a good many words in Aghadez, mostly  correct.    _17th._--It was colder this morning, although yesterday was very  pleasant. Thermometer at sunrise, 41 deg..    It is expected that we shall still remain here thirty days, which time,  if divided half between Haussa and half between Bornouee, will help me  on in these languages, the principal of the interior of Africa. Mohammed  Tunisee is now the servant of Barth alone. Overweg has given him up.    Yesterday morning I gave Overweg the presents for the Sultan of Maradee,  to whom he intends to go on a mission, in the same way as Barth went to  Aghadez. The presents consist of a fine burnouse, a fine shasheeah (five  mahboubs), two pieces of coloured cotton cloth, two heads of white  sugar, knives, scissors, cinnamon, looking-glasses, beads, &c. I hope he  will not return without bringing back the treaty signed. He is also to  make some arrangement for the establishment of the missionaries in  Maradee.    To-day we had prayers in Overweg's tent. I read several short prayers  from the Church of England prayer-book, and also the Gospel and Epistle  for the Sunday.    _18th._--Yesterday evening it was cloudy, and the moon had, for several  hours, an immense elliptical ring round it--a common phenomenon in the  northern Sahara.    To-day Yusuf got up in a rage, and threw down his writing, because I  told him he did not take pains to obtain from the people the several  meanings of the words. This has been the case for most of the time we  have been occupied with the vocabulary. I have therefore left him to  himself, since he insulted me in this manner before the servants, and I  fear I cannot trust myself to go with him to Sakkatou. It is a great  inconvenience, but I must search for a kateb (writer) at Zinder. There  are many poor men of this profession in Bornou, and very faithful  people.    _19th._--His highness En-Noor continues to visit us. Yesterday I gave  him an English silver fourpenny piece, an English farthing, and a small  French silver coin, with all of which he was greatly delighted. He  summed up their value in wada; fifty wadas are an English penny. He  admired her majesty's face on the silver fourpence; but his shadow, the  man who generally comes with him, said,--\"Oh, no, the face of the woman  for a Sultan is not good. _This_ is good,\" pointing to the head of Louis  Philippe.    The news came yesterday evening that a razzia had just been made on  Tintaghoda, the assailants carrying away everything before them, and the  inhabitants of the town fleeing to the mountains. This razzia was made  by the people whom the Sultan of Aghadez has lately punished for the  depredations committed on us and other caravans on the road. When this  took place there were a few people at Tintalous, who, on hearing the  news, came off immediately to us after En-Noor, so that now there does  not remain a single inhabitant in the village. The people of the razzia  were much disappointed at finding no more camels, all those of the  villages hereabouts, and indeed through all Aheer, being gone to fetch  salt from Bilma. They wished to make up the number of camels which the  Sultan of Aghadez took away from them. Of course, when the salt-caravan  returns, an effort will be made to avenge this insult on the holy city  of Aheer--this profanation of the abode of marabouts! It is singular,  nevertheless, that only a year ago some neighbouring tribes, thinking  these holy men had too much wealth, carried off a large number of their  camels. This is the much-vaunted place amongst the credulous Moorish  merchants of the coast, where theft and robbery are unknown!    _21st._--A foggy _November_ morning! But this change of the atmosphere  is very rare, and soon passes away. It is amazing how steady the seasons  are, and how they roll, each bringing its accustomed weather and tunes.    Yesterday I began my Bornou studies, not knowing whether I shall go  first to Bornou or Soudan. I intend, if my health be preserved, to make  a dictionary of the Bornou and Soudan languages together, for the sake  of commerce and general information. I hope Government will print it, or  if not Government, the Philological Society.    _Abizgen_ is a fruit which abounds in Aheer. It is half the size of  small currants, and has not a disagreeable taste--a sort of bitter-sweet  clammy taste. This fruit may be called Aheer currants.    In the neighbourhood of our encampment have been seen gazelles,  ostriches, and monkeys, in considerable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18560"],[0,"Chopin and Other Musical Essays (#15)"],[1,"felt in  his later years when he read the compositions of Schubert (for he  could not hear them) and found in them the evidence of genius, which  he did not hesitate to proclaim.    In considering Beethoven's deafness, it is well to bear in mind the  words of Schopenhauer: \"Genius is its own reward,\" he says. \"If we  look up to a great man of the past we do not think, How fortunate he  is to be still admired by all of us; but, How happy he must have been  in the immediate enjoyment of a mind the traces of which refresh  generations of men.\" Schumann, Weber, and others, repeatedly testify  in their letters to the great delight they felt in creating; and at  the time when he was arranging his \"Freischuetz\" for the piano, Weber  wrote, more forcibly than elegantly, that he was enjoying himself like  the devil.    I have already stated that Weber, like Beethoven, generally got his  new ideas during his walks in the country; and riding in an open  carriage seems to have especially stimulated his brain, as it did  Mozart's. The weird and original music to the dismal Wolf's-Glen scene  in the \"Freischuetz\" was conceived one morning when he was on his way  to Pillnitz, and the wagon was occasionally shrouded in dense clouds.    A curious story is told by a member of Weber's orchestra, showing how  a musical theme may be sometimes suggested by incongruous and  grotesque objects. He was one day taking a walk with Weber in the  suburbs of Dresden. It began to rain and they entered a beer garden  which had just been deserted by the guests in consequence of the rain.  The waiters had piled the chairs on the tables, pell mell. At sight of  these confused groups of chairs and tables Weber suddenly exclaimed,  \"Look here, Roth, doesn't that look like a great triumphal march?  Thunder! hear those trumpet blasts! I can use that--I can use that!\"  In the evening he wrote down what his imagination had heard, and it  subsequently became the great march in \"Oberon.\"    Some psychological interest also attaches to the remark with which  Weber's son prefaces this story--namely that Weber was constantly  transmuting forms and colors into sounds; and that lines and forms  seemed to stimulate his melodic inventiveness pre-eminently, whereas  sounds affected his harmonic sense.    My subject is by no means exhausted, but for fear of fatiguing the  reader with an excess of details I will close with a few facts  regarding Richard Wagner's method of composing. I am indebted for  these facts to the kindness of Herr Seidl, of the Metropolitan Opera  House in New York, who was Wagner's secretary for several years, and  helped him prepare \"Goetterdaemmerung\" and \"Parsifal\" for the press.    Like his famous predecessors, Wagner always carried some sheets of  music paper in his pocket, on which he jotted down with a pencil such  ideas as came to him on solitary walks, or at other times. These he  gave to his wife, who inked them over and arranged them in piles. In  these sketches the vocal part was always written out in full, while  the orchestral part was roughly indicated in two or more additional  staves. Frau Cosima has preserved most of these sketches, and they  will doubtless some day be reproduced in fac-simile, like some of  Beethoven's.    Whenever Wagner was in the mood for composing he would say to Herr  Seidl, \"Bring me my sketches.\" Then he would retire to his composing  room, to which no one was ever admitted, not even his wife and  children. At lunch-time, the servant would bring something to the  ante-room, without being allowed to see the master in his sanctum. How  Wagner conducted himself there is not known, except that strange vocal  sounds, and a few passionate chords on the piano would occasionally  reach the ears of neighbors. Wagner appears to have used his piano  just as Beethoven did his, even after he had become deaf:--as a sort  of lightning-rod for his fervent emotions.    Much nonsense has been written concerning the fact that Wagner used to  wear gaudy costumes of silk and satin while he was composing, and that  he had colored glass in his windows, which gave every object a  mysterious aspect. He was called an imitator of the eccentric King of  Bavaria, and some went so far as to declare him insane. But in truth,  Wagner was simply endeavoring to put himself into an atmosphere most  favorable for dramatic creation. We all know how much clothes help to  make a man, in more than one sense; and any one who has ever taken  part in private theatricals will remember how much the costume helped  him to get into the proper frame of mind for interpreting his role.  This was all that Wagner aimed at in wearing his mediaeval costumes;  and the wonderful realism and vividness of his dramatic conceptions  certainly more than justify the unusual methods he pursued to attain  them.    After elaborating the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic details of his  scores, Wagner considered his main task done, and the orchestration  was completed down-stairs in his music room. In his earliest operas  Wagner did not write his scenes in their regular order, but took those  first which specially proffered themselves. Of the \"Flying Dutchman,\"  for instance, he wrote the spinning chorus first, and he was delighted  to find on this occasion, as he himself says, that he could still  compose after a long interruption. He used a piano but rather to  stimulate and correct than to invent. In his later works the piano is  absolutely out of the question. He wrote the music, scene after scene,  following the text; and the conception of the whole score is so  absolutely orchestral that the piano cannot even give as faint a  notion of it as a photograph can give of the splendors of a Titian.  Wagner, as he himself tells us, was unable to play his scores on the  piano, but always tried to get Liszt to do that for him.    It is possible that some of my readers have never seen a full  orchestral score of \"Siegfried\" or \"Tristan.\" If so, I advise them to  go to a music store and look at one as a matter of curiosity. They  will find a large quarto volume, every page of which represents only  one line of music. There are separate staves for the violins, violas,  cellos, double basses, flutes, bassoons, clarinets, horns, tubas,  trombones, kettle-drums, etc., each family forming a quartette in  itself, and each having its own peculiar emotional quality. In  conducting an opera the Kapellmeister has to keep his eye and ear at  the same time on each of these groups, as well as on the vocal parts  and scenic effects. If this requires a talent rarely found among  musicians, how very much greater must be the mind which created this  complicated operatic score! No one who tries to realize what this  implies, and remembers that Wagner wrote several of his best music  dramas among the mountains of Switzerland, years before he could dream  of ever hearing the countless new harmonies and orchestral tone-colors  which he had discovered, can deny, I think, that I was right in  maintaining that the composing of an opera is the most wonderful  achievement of human genius.          III    SCHUMANN    AS MIRRORED IN HIS LETTERS      Clara Schumann, the most gifted woman that has ever chosen music as a  profession, and who, at the age of sixty-nine, still continues to be  among the most fascinating of pianists, placed the musical world under  additional obligations when she issued three years ago the collection  of private letters, written by Schumann between the ages of eighteen  and thirty (1827-40), partly to her, partly to his mother, and other  relatives, friends, and business associates. She was prompted to this  act not only by the consciousness that there are many literary gems in  the correspondence which should not be lost to the world, but by the  thought that more is generally known of Schumann's eccentricities than  of his real traits of character. Inasmuch as a wretched script was one  of the most conspicuous of these eccentricities, it is fortunate that  his wife lived to edit his letters; but even she, though familiar with  his handwriting during many years of courtship and marriage, was not  infrequently obliged to interpolate a conjectural word. Schumann had  a genuine vein of humor, which he reveals in his correspondence as in  his compositions and criticisms. He was aware that his manuscript was  not a model of caligraphy, but, on being remonstrated with, he  passionately declared he could not do any better, promising, however,  sarcastically that, as a predestined diplomat, he would keep an  amanuensis in future. And on page 245 begins a long letter to Clara  which presents a curious appearance. Every twentieth word or so is  placed between two vertical lines, regarding which the reader is kept  in the dark until he comes to this postscript: \"In great haste, owing  to business affairs, I add a sort of lexicon of indistinctly written  words, which I have placed within brackets. This will probably make  the letter appear very picturesque and piquant. The idea is not so  bad. Adio, clarissima Cara, cara Clarissima.\" Then follows the  \"lexicon\" of twenty words, including his own signature.    Although, in a semi-humorous vein, Schumann repeatedly alludes in  these letters to the \"foregone conclusion\" that they will some day be  printed, there is hardly any indication that such a thought was ever  in his mind while writing them. They are, in fact, full of confidences  and confessions, some of which he could not have been very ambitious  to see in print; such as his frequent appeals for \"more ducats,\"  during his student days, and his sophistically ingenious excuses for  needing so much money, placed side by side with his frank admission  that he had no talent for economy, and was very fond of cigars, wine,  and especially travelling. In one of the most amusing of the letters,  he advances twelve reasons why his mother should send him about $200  to enable him"]]]
