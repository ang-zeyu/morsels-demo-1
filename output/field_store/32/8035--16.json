Now, however, I should act differently, for I am  convinced that a soul ought to disclose to her director the  longing she has to receive her God. He does not come down from  Heaven each day in order to remain in a golden ciborium, but to  find another Heaven--the Heaven of our souls in which He takes  such delight.    Our Lord, Who knew my desire, inspired my confessor to allow me to  go to Communion several times a week, and this permission, coming  as it did straight from Him, filled me with joy.    In those days I did not dare to speak of my inner feelings; the  road which I trod was so direct, so clear, that I did not feel the  need of any guide but Jesus. I compared directors to mirrors who  faithfully reflect Our Saviour to the souls under their care, and  I thought that in my case He did not use an intermediary but acted  directly.    When a gardener gives special attention to a fruit which he wishes  to ripen early, he does so, not with a view to leaving it on the  tree, but in order to place it on a well-spread table. Our Lord  lavished His favours on His Little Flower in the same way. He  wishes His Mercies to shine forth in me--He Who, while on earth,  cried out in a transport of joy: \"I bless Thee, O Father, because  Thou hast hidden these things from the wise and prudent and hast  revealed them to little ones.\"[9]    And because I was small and frail, He bent down to me and  instructed me sweetly in the secrets of His love. As St. John of  the Cross says in his \"Canticle of the Soul\":            On that happy night          In secret I went forth, beheld by none,          And seeing naught;          Having no light nor guide          Excepting that which burned within my heart,            Which lit my way          More safely than the glare of noon-day sun          To where, expectant,          He waited for me Who doth know me well,          Where none appeared but He.    This place was Carmel, but before I could \"sit down under His  Shadow Whom I desired,\"[10] I had to pass through many trials. And  yet the Divine Call was becoming so insistent that, had it been  necessary for me to go through fire, I would have thrown myself  into it to follow my Divine Master.    Pauline[11] was the only one who encouraged me in my vocation;  Marie thought I was too young, and you, dear Mother, no doubt to  prove me, tried to restrain my ardour. From the start I  encountered nothing but difficulties. Then, too, I dared not speak  of it to Celine, and this silence pained me deeply; it was so hard  to have a secret she did not share.    However, this dear sister soon found out my intention, and, far  from wishing to keep me back, she accepted the sacrifice with  wonderful courage. As she also wished to be a nun, she ought to  have been given the first opportunity; but, imitating the martyrs  of old, who used joyfully to embrace those chosen to go before  them into the arena, she allowed me to leave her, and took my  troubles as much to heart as if it were a question of her own  vocation. From Celine, then, I had nothing to fear, but I did not  know how to set about telling Papa. How could his little Queen  talk of leaving him when he had already parted with his two eldest  daughters? Moreover, this year he had been stricken with a serious  attack of paralysis, and though he recovered quickly we were full  of anxiety for the future.    What struggles I went through before I could make up my mind to  speak! But I had to act decisively; I was now fourteen and a half,  and in six months' time the blessed feast of Christmas would be  here. I had resolved to enter the Carmel at the same hour at which  a year before I had received the grace of conversion.    I chose the feast of Pentecost on which to make my great  disclosure. All day I was praying for light from the Holy Ghost,  and begging the Apostles to pray for me, to inspire me with the  words I ought to use. Were they not the very ones to help a timid  child whom God destines to become an apostle of apostles by prayer  and sacrifice?    In the afternoon, when Vespers were over, I found the opportunity  I wanted. My Father was sitting in the garden, his hands clasped,  admiring the wonders of nature. The rays of the setting sun gilded  the tops of the tall trees, and the birds chanted their evening  prayer.    His beautiful face wore a heavenly expression--I could feel that  his soul was full of peace. Without a word, I sat down by his  side, my eyes already wet with tears. He looked at me with  indescribable tenderness, and, pressing me to his heart, said:  \"What is it, little Queen? Tell me everything.\" Then, in order to  hide his own emotion, he rose and walked slowly up and down, still  holding me close to him.    Through my tears I spoke of the Carmel and of my great wish to  enter soon. He, too, wept, but did not say a word to turn me from  my vocation; he only told me that I was very young to make such a  grave decision, and as I insisted, and fully explained my reasons,  my noble and generous Father was soon convinced. We walked about  for a long time; my heart was lightened, and Papa no longer shed  tears. He spoke to me as Saints speak, and showed me some flowers  growing in the low stone wall. Picking one of them, he gave it to  me, and explained the loving care with which God had made it  spring up and grow till now.    I fancied myself listening to my own story, so close was the  resemblance between the little flower and little Therese. I  received this floweret as a relic, and noticed that in gathering  it my Father had pulled it up by the roots without breaking them;  it seemed destined to live on, but in other and more fertile soil.  Papa had just done the same for me. He allowed me to leave the  sweet valley, where I had passed the first years of my life, for  the mountain of Carmel. I fastened my little white flower to a  picture of Our Lady of Victories--the Blessed Virgin smiles on  it, and the Infant Jesus seems to hold it in His Hand. It is there  still, but the stalk is broken close to the root. God doubtless  wishes me to understand that He will soon break all the earthly  ties of His Little Flower and will not leave her to wither on this  earth.    Having obtained my Father's consent, I thought I could now fly to  the Carmel without hindrance. Far from it! When I told my uncle of  my project, he declared that to enter such a severe Order at the  age of fifteen seemed to him against all common sense, and that it  would be doing a wrong to religion to let a child embrace such a  life. He added that he should oppose it in every way possible, and  that nothing short of a miracle would make him change his mind.    I could see that all arguments were useless, so I left him, my  heart weighed down by profound sadness. My only consolation was  prayer. I entreated Our Lord to work this miracle for me because  thus only could I respond to His appeal. Some time went by, and my  uncle did not seem even to remember our conversation, though I  learnt later that it had been constantly in his thoughts.    Before allowing a ray of hope to shine on my soul, Our Lord  deigned to send me another most painful trial which lasted for  three days. Never had I understood so well the bitter grief of Our  Lady and St. Joseph when they were searching the streets of  Jerusalem for the Divine Child. I seemed to be in a frightful  desert, or rather, my soul was like a frail skiff, without a  pilot, at the mercy of the stormy waves. I knew that Jesus was  there asleep in my little boat, but how could I see Him while the  night was so dark? If the storm had really broken, a flash of  lightning would perhaps have pierced the clouds that hung over me:  even though it were but a passing ray, it would have enabled me to  catch a momentary glimpse of the Beloved of my heart--but this was  denied me. Instead, it was night, dark night, utter desolation,  death! Like my Divine Master in the Agony in the Garden, I felt  that I was alone, and found no comfort on earth or in Heaven.    Nature itself seemed to share my bitter sadness, for during these  three days there was not a ray of sunshine and the rain fell in  torrents. I have noticed again and again that in all the important  events of my life nature has reflected my feelings. When I wept,  the skies wept with me; when I rejoiced, no cloud darkened the  blue of the heavens. On the fourth day, a Saturday, I went to see  my uncle. What was my surprise when I found his attitude towards  me entirely changed! He invited me into his study, a privilege I  had not asked for; then, after gently reproaching me for being a  little constrained with him, he told me that the miracle of which  he had spoken was no longer needed. He had prayed God to guide his  heart aright, and his prayer had been heard. I felt as if I hardly  knew him, he seemed so different. He embraced me with fatherly  affection, saying with much feeling: \"Go in peace, my dear child,  you are a privileged little flower which Our Lord wishes to  gather. I will put no obstacle in the way.\"    Joyfully I went home. . . . The clouds had quite disappeared from  the sky, and in my soul also dark night was over. Jesus had  awakened to gladden my heart. I no longer heard the roar of the  waves. Instead of the bitter wind of trial, a light breeze swelled  my sail, and I fancied myself safe in port. Alas! more than one  storm was yet to rise, sometimes even making me fear that I should  be driven, without hope of return, from the shore which I longed  to reach.    I had obtained my uncle's consent, only to be told by you, dear  Mother, that the Superior of the Carmelites would not allow me to  enter till I was twenty-one. No one had dreamt of this serious  opposition, the hardest of all to overcome. And yet, without  losing courage, I went with Papa to lay my request"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/168"],[0,"The History and Practice of the Art of Photography (#15)"],[1,"all ordinary photographic purposes.  For  example, nothing can be more perfect than the images it gives of leaves  and flowers, especially with a summer's sun; the light, passing through  the leaves, delineates every ramification of their fibres.  In  conducting this operation, however, it will be found that the results  are sometimes more and sometimes less satisfactory, in consequence of  small and accidental variations in the proportions employed.  It  happens sometimes that the chloride of silver formed on the surface of  the paper is disposed to blacken of itself, without any exposure to  light.  This shows that the attempt to give it sensibility has been  carried too far.  The object is, to approach as nearly to this  condition as possible without reaching it; so that the preparation may  be in a state ready to yield to the slightest extraneous force, such as  the feeblest effect of light.    Cooper's Method.--Soak the paper in a boiling hot solution of chlorate  of potash (the strength matters not) for a few minutes; then take it  out, dry it, and wet it with a brush, on one side only, dipped in a  solution of nitrate of silver, sixty grains to an ounce of distilled  water, or, if not required to be so sensitive, thirty grains to the  ounce will do.  This paper possesses a great advantage over any other,  for the image can be fixed by mere washing.  It is, however, very apt  to become discolored even in the washing, or shortly afterwards, and  is, besides, not so sensitive, nor does it become so dark as that made  according to Mr. Talbot's method.    Daguerre's Method.--Immerse the paper in hydrochloric (or as it is more  commonly called, muriatic) ether, which has been kept sufficiently long  to become acid; the paper is then carefully and completely dried, as  this is essential to its proper preparation.  It is then dipped into a  solution of nitrate of silver, and dried without artificial heat in a  room from which every ray of light is carefully excluded.  By this  process it acquires a very remarkable facility in being blackened on a  very slight exposure to light, even when the latter is by no means  intense.  The paper, however, rapidly loses its extreme sensitiveness  to light, and finally becomes no more impressionable by the solar beams  than common nitrate paper.    Bromide Paper.--Of all common photographic paper, the best, because the  least troublesome in making, and the most satisfactory in result, is  that which is termed bromine paper, and which is thus  prepared:--Dissolve one hundred grains of bromide of potassium in one  ounce of distilled water, and soak the paper in this solution.  Take  off the superfluous moisture, by means of your bibulous paper, and when  nearly dry, brush it over on one side only, with a solution of one  hundred grains of nitrate of silver to an ounce of distilled water.  The paper should then be dried in a dark room, and, if required to be  very sensitive, should a second time be brushed over with the nitrate  of silver solution.    In preparing the papers mentioned above, there are two circumstances  which require particular attention.  In the first place, it is  necessary to mark the paper on the side spread with the solutions of  nitrate of silver, near one of the extreme corners.  This answers two  purposes:  in the first place it serves to inform the experimentalist  of the sensitive surface; and secondly, it will be a guide as to which  portion of the papers has been handled during the application of the  solution, as the impress of the fingers will probably come out upon the  photograph.  The second caution is, that the application of the  sensitive solution (nitrate of silver,) and the subsequent drying of  the paper, must be always conducted in a perfectly dark room, the light  of a candle alone being used.    [Illustration: Fig. 29 (hipho_29.gif)]    III. PHOTOGENIC PROCESS ON PAPER.--Method.--The simplest mode is to  procure a flat board and a square of glass, larger in size than the  object intended to be copied.  On the board place the photographic  paper with the prepared side upwards, and upon it the object to be  copied; over both lay the glass and secure them so that they are in  close connection by means of binding screws or clamps, similar to g. g.  fig. 29.  Should the object to be copied be of unequal thickness, such  as a leaf, grass, &c., it will be necessary to place on the board,  first, a soft cushion, which may be made of a piece of fine flannel and  cotton wool.  By this means the object is brought into closer contact  with the paper, which is of great consequence, and adds materially to  the clearness of the copy.  The paper is now exposed to diffused  daylight, or, still better, to the direct rays of the sun, when that  part of the paper not covered by the object will become tinged with a  violet color, and if the paper be well prepared, it will in a short  time pass to a deep brown or bronze color.  It must then be removed, as  no advantage will be obtained by keeping it longer exposed; on the  contrary, the delicate parts yet uncolored will become in some degree  affected.  The photogenic paper will now show a more or less white and  distinct representation of the object.  The apparatus figured at 29  consists of a wooden frame similar to a picture frame; a piece of plate  glass is fixed in front; and it is provided with a sliding cover of  wood, c., which is removed when the paper is ready to be exposed to the  action of the light.  The back, d., which is furnished with a cushion,  as just described, is made to remove for the purpose of introducing the  object to be copied, and upon it the prepared paper; the back is then  replaced, and, by aid of the cross piece and screw, e., the whole is  brought into close contact with the glass.    The objects best delineated on these photographic papers, are lace,  feathers, dried plants, particularly the ferns, sea-weeds and the light  grasses, impressions of copper plate and wood engravings, particularly  if they have considerable contrast of light and shade--(these should be  placed with the face downwards, having been previously prepared as  hereafter directed)--paintings on glass, etchings, &c.    To fix the Drawings.--Mr. Talbot recommends that the drawings should be  dipped in salt and water, and in many instances this method will  succeed, but at times it is equally unsuccessful.  Iodide of potassium,  or, as it is frequently called, hydriodate of potash, dissolved in  water, and very much diluted, (twenty-five grains to one ounce of  water,) is a more useful preparation to wash the drawings with; it must  be used very weak or it will not dissolve the unchanged muriate only,  as is intended but the black oxide also, and the drawing be thereby  spoiled.    But the most certain material to be used is the hyposulphite of soda.  One ounce of this salt should be dissolved in about a pint of distilled  water.  Having previously washed the drawing in a little lukewarm  water, which of itself removes a large portion of the muriate of silver  which is to be got rid of, it should be dipped once or twice in the  hyposulphite solution.  By this operation the muriate which lies upon  the lighter parts will become so altered in its nature as to be  unchanged by light, while the rest remains dark as before.    It will be evident from the nature of the process, that the lights and  shadows of an object are reversed.  That which is originally opaque  will intercept the light, and consequently those parts of the  photogenic paper will be least influenced by light, while any part of  the object which is transparent, by admitting the light through it,  will suffer the effect to be greater or less in exact proportion to its  degree of transparency.  The object wholly intercepting the light will  show a white impression; in selecting, for example, a butterfly for an  object, the insect, being more or less transparent, leaves a  proportionate gradation of light and shade, the most opaque parts  showing the whitest.  It may be said, therefore, that this is not  natural, and in order to obtain a true picture--or, as it is termed, a  positive picture--we must place our first acquired photograph upon a  second piece of photogenic paper.  Before we do this, however, we must  render our photograph transparent, otherwise the opacity of the paper  will mar our efforts.    To accomplish this object, the back of the paper containing the  negative, or first acquired photograph, should be covered with white or  virgin wax.  This may be done by scraping the wax upon the paper, and  then, after placing it between two other pieces of paper, passing a  heated iron over it.  The picture, being thus rendered transparent,  should now be applied to a second piece of photogenic paper, and  exposed, in the manner before directed, either to diffused day-light or  to the direct rays of the sun.  The light will now penetrate the white  parts, and the second photograph be the reverse of the first, or a true  picture of the original.    Instead of wax, boiled linseed oil--it must be the best and most  transparent kind--may be used.  The back of the negative photograph  should be smeared with the oil, and then placed between sheets of  bibulous paper.  When dry the paper is highly transparent.    IV. APPLICATION OF PHOTOGENIC DRAWING.--This method of photogenic  drawing may be applied to useful purposes, such as the copying of  paintings on glass by the light thrown through them on the prepared  paper--Imitations of etchings, which may be accomplished by covering a  piece of glass with a thick coat of white oil paint; when dry, with the  point of a needle, lines or scratches are to be made through the white  lead ground, so as to lay the glass bare; then place the glass upon a  piece of prepared paper, and expose it to the light.  Of course every  line will be represented beneath of a black color, and thus an  imitation"]]]
