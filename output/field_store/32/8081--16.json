Once or twice something moved ahead; a branch was shaking as he came  up, a blade of grass slowly righting itself, as if something that had  been sitting upon it had but just stolen away.  All round were hints of  life, but no life was visible.  It was as if the cat were moving  through an army of ghosts.    Then, in a flash, without any kind of hint or warning to prepare one  for the unnerving contrast of the change, was war--raw, red war.    There had come up a rabbit-run--a regular rabbit-turnpike--a creature.  It was strikingly colored, that creature, and big--nearly three feet  long, to be exact; but it looked much bigger in the ghostly  twilight--and yet till it was actually upon him he, even he, had failed  to see it.    Long, low, bear-like, and burly, with claws caked with earth, gashed  and bleeding on flank and shoulder it was, red-fanged and wild-eyed.  It charged home upon Pharaoh without a second's pause, and with an  obscene chatter that was unnerving to any one, let alone so highly  strung a bag of tricks as a cat.    Men and dogs had been besieging this badger in its den for twelve  hours.  It had in the end made a desperate _sortie_, upset one man who  had failed to grab its tail, run into and bitten another, and got clean  away.  Pharaoh was unfortunate in that he stood between the half-mad  beast and another den for which it was making.    There was no time to go back, no room to execute one of those beautiful  lightning side-leaps which are the pride of all the cats, and less to  spring into the air, a neat trick of the tribe which it has also  perfected.    The cat was cornered, and, being cornered, fought like--a cornered cat!  That is to say, an electrified devil.    He reared up.  He struck, pat! pat! right and left, with the terrible,  rending, full stroke of his kind.  He met open jaws with open jaws--you  could hear fang clash against fang.  He grabbed, scrunched, drew back,  grabbed, scrunched again, as a lion will--for the cats neither hold  fast like a weasel nor snap like a wolf.  Then, as the full force of  the charge and the weight of the enemy's body--some twenty-seven and a  half pounds--took him, he hugged, round-arm fashion, with his talons,  and, still grabbing and scrunching, rolled over backwards.    Cat and badger turned into a ball--a parti-colored ball, very lively as  to its center, and it whirled.  Unfortunately there was not much room  to whirl in.  That made things all the more grisly.  You could almost  see the grim skeleton shape of death, hovering over that growling,  snarling, spitting, worrying, tearing, kicking, gnashing, scrunching,  foaming, blood-flecked Catherine-wheel--almost see death, I say,  bending down with upraised arm ready to strike.  But death never struck.    In an instant there came, sounding strangely hollow in that still, damp  air of dusk, as though it were in a cave, the unmistakable noise of a  deep, dry, hacking cough.  Truly, it was nothing much--just a good old  churchy and human cough.  But it might have been a blast from the  trumpet of the archangel Gabriel himself by the effect it had upon the  two combatants.  They shot apart like released electrified dust-atoms,  and--pff!--they were gone--wiped out.  Like pricked bubbles, they had  ceased to be.  And neither gave any explanation.  Being wild things, of  course they wouldn't.    The cough had only come from a laborer, who, passing along a pathway  through the furze, had heard the commotion, and stopped.  He never saw  anything, though he crashed into the furze and hunted--he never saw  anything, which was no wonder, seeing that he could hardly have  selected a way to see less.  The cat was four hundred yards away by  that time, and goodness knows where the badger was---deep down in his  den, one presumes.    Later the cat slept, in a fortress of nature safe enough, surrounded by  a hundred unseen sentries with brown jackets and white tails--rabbits,  who would give him all the warning he required.      II    The lean night wind next evening came down, and day went out almost  imperceptibly.  Blackness grew under the furze caverns, and the last  glimpse of the estuary faded away in a steely glimmer; a brown ghost of  an owl slid low over the spiked ramparts, and wings--the wings of  fighting wild-duck coming up from the sea to feed--\"spoke\" like swords  through the star-spangled blue-black canopy of heaven.    The night-folk began to move abroad.  You could hear them pass--now a  faint rustle here, now a surreptitious \"pad-pad\" there.  Once some  bird-thing of the night cried out suddenly, very far away in the sky,  \"Keck! keck!\" and was gone.    It was not Pharaoh, however, that you would have heard move.  None of  the wild-folk could tell how at midnight he managed to land himself far  out over the marsh, unperceived.  He was there--you must take my word  for it--just two faintly luminous yellow-green lamps floating on the  mist.    Not many men knew their way across the marsh by day; certainly not five  even of the oldest wildfowlers could have got over safely by night.  It  was not man, therefore, that was causing the cat to melt into the  short, salt grass, so closely that there was nothing of him left.  Something else was coming his way.    Along the edge of the dike it came--tall, thin, pale, ghostly,  and--yes, I could have sworn it, though night does play odd tricks with  the human eyesight--faintly phosphorescent.  At least, it seemed to  glow ever so dimly, like one that moves in a nearly burnt-out halo.    Every yard or two it paused, that thing.  Once there was a splash, as  if some one were spearing fish and had missed.    The cat moved rather less than an average stone.  He knew that in the  wild to be motionless is, in nine cases out of ten, to be invisible.  The tenth case doesn't matter, because the creature that discovers it  usually dies.  Moreover, there was no cover to move to, and cover is  the cat's trump card.    Now, everything would have gone off all right if--well, if the cat  hadn't been a cat, I suppose; that is, if he had been able to stop the  ceaseless twitching of the black tip of his tail.  Tiger-hunters know  that twitching, and those who have stalked the lion will tell you of  it, as also the sparrow on the garden wall, whose life may have been  saved from somebody's pet \"tabby\" by that same twitching.  It is a  characteristic habit of the tribe, I take it.    The luminous ghost-thing was close now.  Heaven knows whether it saw  that twitching then!  I think so.  It stopped, anyway, and became a  pillar of stone.  The cat, almost under it, fairly pressed himself into  the grass.    Then--whrrp!    Something shot through the air like a lance, and pinned that twitching  tail-point to the ground.  There had been no warning--nothing!  Just  that javelin from the ghost, and---the cat on his hindlegs, screaming  like a stricken devil, clawing at the ghost, now revealed as a very  big, long-legged bird which flapped.  It flapped huge wings and danced  a grotesque dance, and it smelt abominably, with the stench of ten  fish-markets on a hot day.    Then at last, the cat clawing and yelling the whole time, the bird's  slow brain seemed to realize the mistake.  The javelin, which was its  beak, was withdrawn from the protesting tail-tip hurriedly--to be  driven through the cat's skull as a sheer act of necessary  self-defense, I fancy.  But the cat did not wait to see.  Imagine the  infamy, the absolute sacrilege, from a cat's point of view, of spitting  a feline tail in that disgusting fashion.  Why, if you only tread on  one, you hear about it in five-tenths of the average second, and offend  the supercilious owner for a month afterwards!    There was a vision, just a half-guessed vision, of our cat shooting  straight upwards through the air, and outwards over the still waters of  the dike; there was a number one splash that set the reflected stars  dancing, and the water-voles (\"rats,\" if you like) bolting to their  holes; and there was the sighing \"frou-frou-frou!\" of great wings as  the big bird rose and fled majestically.  There was the sucking gurgle  and drip-drip of a furred body leaving the water on the far side, eyes  that glared more hate than pen can set down, and a deep, low, malignant  feline curse.  That cat had swum the rest of the way over the dike  which he could not jump.    The bird was only a heron, and that does not sound much unless you are  acquainted with the ways of the heron and all his beak implies.  A  heron is one of those birds that can fight at need, and--knows it.  Moreover, in his long beak, set on his steel-spring neck, he has a  weapon of awful \"piercefulness,\" and--knows that too.  The bird is an  example of armed defense.    This one had merely been fishing for eels in that pessimistic way  peculiar to all fishermen, and seeing the tail-tip waving in the grass,  and nothing else, had mistaken the same for his quarry.  And this will  be the easier to believe because we know, and probably the heron did  also, that eels are given at times to overland journeys on secret  errands of their own.    The cat crawled away down the dike in offended silence.  He was wet,  and the only cat I ever knew who did not seem to be scandalized past  speech at the fact.  Indeed, he went farther.  He came upon a ripple  and a dot, some fifty yards farther on, which to the initiated such as  he, represented a water-vole (\"rat,\" if you will) swimming.    Then, before you could take your pipe from your mouth to exclaim, the  water-vole was not swimming.  He was squealing in a most loud and  public-spirited fashion from between Pharaoh's jaws, and it was the cat  who was swimming.  He had just taken a flying leap from the bank and  landed full upon the dumbfounded water-vole--splash!  Then he swam  calmly ashore and dined, all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17571"],[0,"Piano Tuning: A Simple and Accurate Method for Amateurs (#15)"],[1,"I.    =MATHEMATICS OF THE TEMPERED SCALE.~      One of the first questions that arises in the mind of the thinking  young tuner is: Why is it necessary to temper certain intervals in  tuning? We cannot answer this question in a few words; but you have  seen, if you have tried the experiments laid down in previous lessons,  that such deviation is inevitable. You know that practical scale  making will permit but two pure intervals (unison and octave), but you  have yet to learn the scientific reasons why this is so. To do this,  requires a little mathematical reasoning.    In this lesson we shall demonstrate the principles of this complex  subject in a clear and comprehensive way, and if you will study it  carefully you may master it thoroughly, which will place you in  possession of a knowledge of the art of which few tuners of the  present can boast.    In the following demonstrations of relative pitch numbers, we adopt a  pitch in which middle C has 256 vibrations per second. This is not a  pitch which is used in actual practice, as it is even below  international (middle C 258.65); but is chosen on account of the fact  that the various relative pitch numbers work out more favorably, and  hence, it is called the \"Philosophical Standard.\" Below are the actual  vibration numbers of the two pitches in vogue; so you can see that  neither of these pitches would be so favorable to deal with  mathematically.    International--3C--517.3. Concert--3C--540.    (Let us state here that the difference in these pitches is less than a  half-step, but is so near that it is generally spoken of as being just  a half-step.)    Temperament denotes the arrangement of a system of musical sounds in  which _each one_ will form a serviceable interval with _any one_ of  the others. Any given tone must do duty as the initial or key-note of  a major or of a minor scale and also as any other member; thus:        C must serve as 1, in the key of C major or C minor.         \"      \"     2,   \"       \"   B[b] \"     B[b] \"         \"      \"     3,   \"       \"   A[b] \"     A    \"         \"      \"     4,   \"       \"   G    \"     G    \"         \"      \"     5,   \"       \"   F    \"     F    \"         \"      \"     6,   \"       \"   E[b] \"     E    \"         \"      \"     7,   \"       \"   D[b] \"     C[#] \"    Likewise, all other tones of the instrument must be so stationed that  they can serve as _any member_ of _any scale_, major or minor.    This is rendered necessary on account of the various modulations  employed in modern music, in which every possible harmony in every key  is used.      RATIONALE OF THE TEMPERAMENT.    Writers upon the mathematics of sound tell us, experience teaches us,  and in previous lessons we have demonstrated in various ways, that if  we tune all fifths perfect up to the seventh step (see diagram, pages  82, 83) the last E obtained will be too sharp to form a major third to  C. In fact, the third thus obtained is so sharp as to render it  offensive to the ear, and therefore unfit for use in harmony, where  this interval plays so conspicuous a part. To remedy this, it becomes  necessary to tune each of the fifths a very small degree flatter than  perfect. The E thus obtained will not be so sharp as to be offensive  to the ear; yet, if the fifth be properly altered or tempered, the  third will still be sharper than perfect; for if the fifths were  flattened enough to render the thirds perfect, they (the fifths) would  become offensive. Now, it is a fact, that the third will bear greater  deviation from perfect consonance than the fifth; so the compromise  is made somewhat in favor of the fifth. If we should continue the  series of perfect fifths, we will find the same defect in all the  major thirds throughout the scale.    We must, therefore, flatten each fifth of the complete circle,  C-G-D-A-E-B-F[#]-C[#]-G[#] or A[b]-E[b]-B[b]-F-C, successively in a  very small degree; the depression, while it will not materially impair  the consonant quality of the fifths, will produce a series of somewhat  sharp, though still agreeable and harmonious major thirds.    We wish, now, to demonstrate the cause of the foregoing by  mathematical calculation, which, while it is somewhat lengthy and  tedious, is not difficult if followed progressively. First, we will  consider tone relationship in connection with relative string length.  Students who have small stringed instruments, guitar, violin, or  mandolin, may find pleasure in demonstrating some of the following  facts thereupon.    One-half of any string will produce a tone exactly an octave above  that yielded by its entire length. Harmonic tones on the violin are  made by touching the string lightly with the finger at such points as  will cause the string to vibrate in segments; thus if touched exactly  in the middle it will produce a harmonic tone an octave above that of  the whole string.    Two-thirds of the length of a string when stopped produces a tone a  fifth higher than that of the entire string; one-third of the length  of a string on the violin, either from the nut or from the bridge, if  touched lightly with the finger at that point, produces a harmonic  tone an octave higher than the fifth to the open tone of that string,  because you divide the string into three vibrating segments, each of  which is one-third its entire length. Reason it thus: If two-thirds of  a string produce a fifth, one-third, being just half of two-thirds,  will produce a tone an octave higher than two-thirds. For  illustration, if the string be tuned to 1C, the harmonic tone produced  as above will be 2G. We might go on for pages concerning harmonics,  but for our present use it is only necessary to show the general  principles. For our needs we will discuss the relative length of  string necessary to produce the various tones of the diatonic scale,  showing ratios of the intervals in the same.    In the following table, 1 represents the entire length of a string  sounding the tone C. The other tones of the ascending major scale  require strings of such fractional length as are indicated by the  fractions beneath them. By taking accurate measurements you can  demonstrate these figures upon any small stringed instrument.    Funda- | Major | Major | Perfect | Perfect | Major |  Major  |  Oc- |  mental |Second | Third | Fourth  |  Fifth  | Sixth | Seventh | tave |         |       |       |         |         |       |         |      |     C   |   D   |   E   |    F    |    G    |   A   |    B    |  C   |     1   |  8/9  |  4/5  |   3/4   |   2/3   |  3/5  |   8/15  | 1/2  |      To illustrate this principle further and make it very clear, let us  suppose that the entire length of the string sounding the fundamental  C is 360 inches; then the segments of this string necessary to produce  the other tones of the ascending major scale will be, in inches, as  follows:     C  |  D  |  E  |  F  |  G  |  A  |  B  |  C  |  360 | 320 | 288 | 270 | 240 | 216 | 192 | 180 |      Comparing now one with another (by means of the ratios expressed by  their corresponding numbers) the intervals formed by the tones of the  above scale, it will be found that they all preserve their original  purity except the minor third, D-F, and the fifth, D-A. The third,  D-F, presents itself in the ratio of 320 to 270 instead of 324 to 270  (which latter is equivalent to the ratio of 6 to 5, the true ratio of  the minor third). The third, D-F, therefore, is to the true minor  third as 320 to 324 (reduced to their lowest terms by dividing both  numbers by 4, gives the ratio of 80 to 81). Again, the fifth, A-F,  presents itself in the ratio of 320 to 216, or (dividing each term by  4) 80 to 54; instead of 3 to 2 (=81 to 54--multiplying each term by  27), which is the ratio of the true fifth. Continuing the scale an  octave higher, it will be found that the sixth, F-D, and the fourth,  A-D, will labor under the same imperfections.    The comparison, then, of these ratios of the minor third, D-F, and the  fifth, D-A, with the perfect ratios of these intervals, shows that  each is too small by the ratio expressed by the figures 80 to 81. This  is called, by mathematicians, the _syntonic comma_.    As experience teaches us that the ear cannot endure such deviation as  a whole comma in any fifth, it is easy to see that some tempering must  take place even in such a simple and limited number of sounds as the  above series of eight tones.    The necessity of temperament becomes still more apparent when it is  proposed to combine every sound used in music into a connected system,  such that each individual sound shall not only form practical  intervals with all the other sounds, but also that each sound may be  employed as the root of its own major or minor key; and that all the  tones necessary to form its scale shall stand in such relation to each  other as to satisfy the ear.    The chief requisites of any system of musical temperament adapted to  the purposes of modern music are:--        1. That all octaves must remain perfect, each being divided into      twelve semitones.        2. That each sound of the system may be employed as the root of a      major or minor scale, without increasing the number of sounds in      the system.        3. That each consonant interval, according to its degree of      consonance, shall lose as little of its original purity as      possible; so that the ear may still acknowledge it as a perfect or      imperfect consonance.    Several ways of adjusting such a system of temperament have been  proposed, all of which may be classed under either the head of equal  or of unequal temperament.    The principles set forth in the following propositions clearly  demonstrate the reasons for tempering, and the whole rationale of the  system of equal temperament, which is that in general use, and which  is invariably sought and practiced by tuners of the present.
