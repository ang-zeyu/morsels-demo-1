We have stated already (p. 113) that nothing is allowed by law to enter  into the composition of beer, but malt and hops.    The substances used by fraudulent brewers for adulterating beer, are  chiefly the following:    Quassia, which gives to beer a bitter taste, is substituted for hops;  but hops possesses a more agreeable aromatic flavour, and there is also  reason to believe that they render beer less liable to spoil by keeping;  a property which does not belong to quassia. It requires but little  discrimination to distinguish very clearly the peculiar bitterness of  quassia in adulterated porter. Vast quantities of the shavings of this  wood are sold in a half-torrefied and ground state to disguise its  obvious character, and to prevent its being recognised among the waste  materials of the brewers. Wormwood[59] has likewise been used by  fraudulent brewers.    The adulterating of hops is prohibited by the Legislature.[60]    \"If any person shall put any drug or ingredient whatever into hops to  alter the colour or scent thereof, every person so offending, convicted  by the oath of one witness before one justice of peace for the county or  place where the offence was committed, shall forfeit 5_l._ for every  hundred weight.\"    Beer rendered bitter by quassia never keeps well, unless it be kept in a  place possessing a temperature considerably lower than the temperature  of the surrounding atmosphere; and this is not well practicable in large  establishments.    The use of boiling the wort of beer with hops, is partly to communicate  a peculiar aromatic flavour which the hop contains, partly to cover the  sweetness of undecomposed saccharine matter, and also to separate, by  virtue of the gallic acid and tannin it contains, a portion of a  peculiar vegetable mucilage somewhat resembling gluten, which is still  diffused through the beer. The compound thus produced, separates in  small flakes like those of curdled soap; and by these means the beer is  rendered less liable to spoil. For nothing contributes more to the  conversion of beer, or any other vinous fluid, into vinegar, than  mucilage. Hence, also, all full-bodied and clammy ales, abounding in  mucilage, and which are generally ill fermented, do not keep as perfect  ale ought to do. Quassia is, therefore, unfit as a substitute for hops;  and even English hops are preferable to those imported from the  Continent; for nitrate of silver and acetate of lead produce a more  abundant precipitate from an infusion of English hops, than can be  obtained from a like infusion by the same agents from foreign hops.    One of the qualities of good porter, is, that it should bear _a fine  frothy head_, as it is technically termed: because professed judges of  this beverage, would not pronounce the liquor excellent, although it  possessed all other good qualities of porter, without this requisite.    To impart to porter this property of frothing when poured from one  vessel into another, or to produce what is also termed a _cauliflower  head_, the mixture called _beer-heading_, composed of common green  vitriol (sulphate of iron,) alum, and salt, is added. This addition to  the beer is generally made by the publicans.[61] It is unnecessary to  genuine beer, which of itself possesses the property of bearing a strong  white froth, without these additions; and it is only in consequence of  table beer being mixed with strong beer, that the frothing property of  the porter is lost. From experiments I have tried on this subject, I  have reason to believe that the sulphate of iron, added for that  purpose, does not possess the power ascribed to it. But the publicans  frequently, when they fine a butt of beer, by means of isinglass,  adulterate the porter at the same time with table beer, together with a  quantity of molasses and a small portion of extract of gentian root, to  keep up the peculiar flavour of the porter; and it is to the molasses  chiefly, which gives a spissitude to the beer, that the frothing  property must be ascribed; for, without it, the sulphate of iron does  not produce the property of frothing in diluted beer.    Capsicum and grains of paradise, two highly acrid substances, are  employed to give a pungent taste to weak insipid beer. Of late, a  concentrated tincture of these articles, to be used for a similar  purpose, and possessing a powerful effect, has appeared in the  price-currents of brewers' druggists. Ginger root, coriander seed, and  orange peels, are employed as flavouring substances chiefly by the ale  brewers.    From these statements, and the seizures that have been made of illegal  ingredients at various breweries, it is obvious that the adulterations  of beer are not imaginary. It will be noticed, however, that some of the  sophistications are comparatively harmless, whilst others are effected  by substances deleterious to health.    The following list exhibits some of the unlawful substances seized at  different breweries and at chemical laboratories.      _List of Illegal Ingredients, seized from 1812 to 1818, at various  Breweries and Brewers' Druggists._[62]    1812, July.

In other chapters dealing more particularly with the political  development of Germany, and with the salient characteristics, mental  and moral, of the people, we shall see how it has come about, that one  man can thus impregnate a whole nation of sixty-five millions with his  own aims and ambitions, to such an extent, that they may be said, so  to speak, to live their political, social, martial, religious, and  even their industrial, life in him. It is a phenomenon of personality  that exists nowhere else in the world to-day, and on so large a scale  and among so enlightened a people, perhaps never before in history.    Nothing has made scientific accuracy in dealing with the most  interesting and most important factors in the world, so utterly  inaccurate and misleading, as those infallibly accurate and impersonal  agents, electricity and the sun. If one were to judge a man by his  photographs, and the gossip of the press, one would be sure to know  nothing more valuable about him than that his mustache is brushed up,  and that his brows are permanently lowering. Personality is so evasive  that one may count upon it that when a machine says \"There it is!\"  then there it is not! You will have everything that is patent and  nothing that is pertinent.    We are forever talking and writing about the smallness of the world,  of how much better we know one another, and of how much more we should  love one another, now that we flash photographs and messages to and  fro, at a speed of leagues a second. Nothing could be more futile and  foolish. These things have emphasized our differences, they have done  nothing to realize our likeness to one another. We are as far from one  another as in the days, late in the tenth century, when they  complained in England that men learned fierceness from the Saxon of  Germany, effeminacy from the Fleming, and drunkenness from the Dane.    As probably the outstanding figure and best-known, superficially  known, man in the world, the German Emperor has escaped the notice of  very few people who notice anything. His likeness is everywhere, and  gossip about him is on every tongue. He is as familiar to the American  as Roosevelt, to the Englishman as Lloyd-George, to the Frenchman as  Dreyfus, to the Russian as his Czar, and to the Chinese and Japanese  as their most prominent political figure. And yet I should say that he  is comparatively little known, either externally or internally, as he  is.    It is perhaps the fate of those of most influence to be misunderstood.  Of this, I fancy, the Emperor does not complain. Indeed, those feeble  folk who complain of being misunderstood, ought to console themselves  with the thought that practically all our imperishable monuments, are  erected to the glory of those whom we condemned and criticised;  starved and stoned; burned and crucified, when we had them with us.    William II, German Emperor and King of Prussia, was born January 27,  1859, and became German Emperor June 15, 1888. He is, therefore, in  the prime of life, and looks it. His complexion and eyes are as clear  as those of an athlete, and his eyes, and his movements, and his talk  are vibrating with energy. He stands, I should guess, about five feet  eight or nine, has the figure and activity of an athletic youth of  thirty, and in his hours of friendliness is as careless in speech, as  unaffected in manner, as lacking in any suspicion of self-  consciousness, or of any desire to impress you with his importance, as  the simplest gentleman in the land.    Alas, how often this courageous and gentlemanly attitude has been  taken advantage of! I have headed this chapter The Indiscreet, and I  propose to examine these so-called indiscretions in some detail, but  for the moment I must ask: Is there any excuse for, or any social  punishment too severe for, the man who, introduced into a gentleman's  house in the guise of a gentleman, often by his own ambassador, leaves  it, to blab every detail of the conversation of his host, with the  gesticulations and exclamation points added by himself? To add a  little to his own importance, he will steal out with the  conversational forks and spoons in his pockets, and rush to a  newspaper office to tell the world that he has kept his soiled napkin  as a souvenir. The only indiscretion in such a case is when the host,  or his advisers, or gentlemen anywhere, heed the lunatic laughter of  such a social jackal.    To count one's words, to tie up one's phrases in caution, to dip each  sentence in a diplomatic antiseptic, in the company of those to whom  one has conceded hospitality, what a feeble policy! Better be brayed  to the world every day as indiscreet than that!    It is a fine quality in a man to be in love with his job. Even though  you have little sympathy with Savonarola's fierceness or Wesley's  hardness, they were burning up all the time with their allegiance to  their ideals of salvation. They served their Lord as lovers. Many men,  even kings and princes and other potentates, give the impression that  they would enjoy a holiday from their task. They seem to be harnessed  to their duties rather than possessed by them; they appear like  disillusioned husbands rather than as radiant lovers.    The German Emperor is not of that class. He loves his job. In his  first proclamation to his people he declared that he had taken over  the government \"in the presence of the King of kings, promising God to  be a just and merciful prince, cultivating piety and the fear of God.\"  He has proclaimed himself to be, as did Frederick the Great and his  grandfather before him, the servant of his people. Certainly no one in  the German Empire works harder, and what is far more difficult and far  more self-denying, no one keeps himself fitter for his duties than he.  He eats no red meat, drinks almost no alcohol, smokes very little,  takes a very light meal at night, goes to bed early and gets up early.  He rides, walks, shoots, plays tennis, and is as much in the open air  as his duties permit.    It is not easy for the American to put side by side the attitudes of a  man, who is the autocratic master and at the same time declares  himself to be the first servant of his people. Perhaps if it is  phrased differently it will not seem so contradictory. What this  Emperor means, and what all princes who have believed in their right  to rule meant, was not that they were the servants of their people,  but the servants of their own obligations to their people, and of the  duties that followed therefrom. If in addition to this the claim is  made by the sovereign, that his right to rule is of divine origin,  then his service to his obligations becomes of the highest and most  sacred importance.    We should not allow our democratic prejudices to stifle our  understanding in such matters. We are trying to get clearly in  perspective a ruler, who claims to rule in obedience to no mandates  from the people, but in obedience to God. We could not be ruled by  such a one in America; and in England such a ruler would be deemed  unconstitutional. It is elementary, but necessary to repeat, that we  are writing of Germany and the Germans, and of their history,  traditions, and political methods. We are making no defence of either  the German Emperor or the German people; neither are we occupying an  American pulpit to preach to them the superiority of other methods  than their own. My sole task is to make clear the German situation,  and not by any means to set up my own or my countrymen's standards for  their adoption. I am not searching for that paltry and ephemeral  profit that comes from finding opportunities to laugh or to sneer. I  am seeking for the German successes, and they are many, and for the  reasons for them, and for the lessons that we may learn from them. Any  other aim in writing of another people is ignoble.    This attitude of the ruler will be as incomprehensible to the  democratic citizen as alchemy, but, in order to draw anything like  true inferences or useful deductions, in order to understand the  situation and to get a true likeness of the ruler, one must take this  utterly unfamiliar and to us incomprehensible claim into  consideration, and acknowledge its existence whether we admit the  claim as justifiable or not. The relation of such a ruler to his  people is like that of a Catholic bishop to his flock. The contract is  not one made with hands, but is an inalienable right on the one hand,  and an undisseverable tie upon the other. Bismarck wrote on this  subject: \"Fuer mich sind die Worte, 'von Gottes Gnaden,' welche  christliche Herrscher ihrem Namen beifuegen, kein leerer Schall,  sondern ich sehe darin das Bekenntniss, des Fuersten das Scepter was  ihnen Gott verliehen hat, nur nach Gottes Willen auf Erden fuehren  wollen.\"    On several occasions the German Emperor has made it unmistakably clear  that this is his view of the origin and sanctity of his  responsibilities. \"If we have been able to accomplish what has been  accomplished, it is due above all things to the fact that our house  possesses a tradition by virtue of which we consider that we have been  appointed by God to preserve and direct, for their own welfare, the  people over whom he has given us power.\" These words are from a speech  made in 1897 at Bremen. In 1910, at Koenigsberg, he declares: \"It was  in this spot that my grandfather in his own right placed the royal  crown of Prussia upon his head, insisting once again that it was  bestowed upon him by the grace of God alone, and not by parliaments  and meetings and decisions of the people. He thus regarded himself as  the chosen instrument of heaven, and as such carried out his duties as  a ruler and lord. I consider myself such an instrument of heaven, and  shall go my way "]]]
