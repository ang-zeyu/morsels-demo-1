This gigantic statue of hard gritstone had formerly been broken in half  across the waist, and the upper part thrown to the ground, either by the  shock of an earthquake or the ruder shock of Persian zeal against the  Egyptian religion; and for some centuries past the musical notes had  issued from the broken fragments. Such was its fallen state when  the Empress Sabina saw it, and when Strabo and Juvenal and Pausanias  listened to its sounds; and it was not till after the reign of Hadrian  that it was again raised upright like its companion, as travellers now  see it.    [Illustration: 100b..jpg The Slumber Song]         From the painting by P. Grot. Johann    From this second visit, and a longer acquaintance, Hadrian seems to have  formed a very poor opinion of the Egyptians and Egyptian Jews; and the  following curious letter, written in 134 A.D. to his friend Servianus,  throws much light upon their religion as worshippers of Serapis, at  the same time that it proves how numerous the Christians had become in  Alexandria, even within seventy years of the period during which the  evangelist Mark is believed to have preached there:    \"Hadrian Augustus to Servianus, the consul, greeting:    \"As for Egypt, which you were praising to me, dearest Servianus, I have  found its people wholly light, wavering, and flying after every breath  of a report. Those who worship Serapis are Christians, and those who  call themselves bishops of Christ are devoted to Serapis. There is  no ruler of a Jewish synagogue, no Samaritan, no presbyter of the  Christians, who is not a mathematician, an augur, and a soothsayer. The  very patriarch himself, when he came into Egypt, was by some said to  worship Serapis, and by others to worship Christ. As a race of men, they  are seditious, vain, and spiteful; as a body, wealthy and prosperous,  of whom nobody lives in idleness. Some blow glass, some make paper, and  others linen. There is work for the lame and work for the blind; even  those who have lost the use of their hands do not live in idleness.  Their one god is nothing; Christians, Jews, and all nations worship him.  I wish this body of men was better behaved, and worthy of their number;  for as for that they ought to hold the chief place in Egypt. I have  granted everything unto them; I have restored their old privileges, and  have made them grateful by adding new ones.\"      Among the crowd of gods that had formerly been worshipped in Egypt,  Serapis had latterly been rising above the rest. He was the god of  the dead, who in the next world was to reward the good and punish the  wicked; and in the growing worship of this one all-seeing judge we  cannot but trace the downfall of some of the evils of polytheism. A  plurality in unity was another method now used to explain away the  polytheism.    [Illustration: 102.jpg EGYPTIAN ORACLE]    The oracle when consulted about the divine nature had answered, \"I am  Ra, and Horus, and Osiris;\" or, as the Greeks translated it, Apollo,  and Lord, and Bacchus; \"I rule the hours and the seasons, the wind and  the storms, the day and the night; I am king of the stars and myself an  immortal fire.\" Hence arose the opinion which seems to have been given  to Hadrian, that the Egyptians had only one god, and his mistake in  thinking that the worshippers of Serapis were Christians. The emperor,  indeed, himself, though a polytheist, was very little of an idolater;  for, though he wished to add Christ to the number of the Roman gods,  he on the other hand ordered that the temples built in his reign should  have no images for worship; and in after ages it was common to call  all temples without statues Hadrian's temples. But there were other and  stronger reasons for Hadrian's classing the Christians with the Egyptian  astrologers. A Christian heresy was then rising into notice in Egypt in  that very form, taking its opinions from the philosophy on which it was  engrafted. Before Christianity was preached in Alexandria, there were  already three religions or forms of philosophy belonging to the three  races of men who peopled that busy city; first, the Greek philosophy;  which was chiefly platonism; secondly, the mysticism of the Egyptians;  and lastly, the religion of the Jews. These were often more or less  mixed, as we see them all united in the works of Philo-Judae; and in  the writings of the early converts we usually find Christianity clothed  in one or other of these forms, according to the opinions held by the  writers before their conversion. The first Christian teachers, the  apostolic fathers as they are called, because they had been hearers of  the apostles themselves, were mostly Jews; but among the Egyptians and  Greeks of Alexandria their religion lost much of its purely moral caste,  and became, with the former, an astrological mysticism, and with the  latter an abstract speculative theology. It is of the Egyptian Jews that  Hadrian speaks in his letter just quoted; many of them had been already  converted to Christianity, and their religion had taken the form of  Gnosticism.    Gnosticism, or Science, for the name means no more, was not then new  in Alexandria, nor were its followers originally Christians. It was the  proud name claimed for their opinions by those who studied the Eastern  philosophy of the Magi; and Egypt seems to have been as much its native  soil as India. The name of Gnostic, says Weber, was generally given to  those who distinguished between belief on authority and gnosis, i.e.,  between the ordinary comprehension and a higher knowledge only granted  to a few gifted or chosen ones. They were split up into different sects,  according as they approached more nearly the Eastern theosophy or the  platonic philosophy; but in general the Eastern conception, with its  symbols and unlimited fantasy, remained dominant. The \"creed of those  who know\" never reached actual monotheism, the conception of one  personal god, who created everything according to his own free will and  rules over everything with unlimited wisdom and love. The god of  the Gnostics is a dark, mysterious being which can only arrive at a  consciousness of itself through a manifold descending scale of forces,  which flow from the god himself. The visible world was created out of  dead and evil matter by Demiurgos, the divine work-master, a production  and subordinate of the highest god. Man, too, is a production of this  subordinate creator, a production subject to a blind fate, and a prey to  those powers which rule between heaven and earth, without free-will,  the only thing which makes the ideas of sin and responsibility possible.  Matter is the seat of evil, and as long as man stands under the  influence of this matter, he is in the hands of evil and knows no  freedom. Redemption can only reach him through those higher beings of  light, which free man from the power of matter and translate him into  the kingdom of light. According to the Gnostic teaching, Christ is  one of these beings of light; he is one of the highest who appeared on  earth, and is transformed into a mythical, allegorical being, with  his human nature, his sufferings and death completely suppressed. The  redeemed soul is then as a kind of angel, or ideal being, brought in  triumph into the idealistic realm of light as soon as it has purified  itself to the nature of a spirit, by means of penitence, chastisements,  and finally the death of the physical body. Hence the Gnostics attached  little importance to the means of mercy in the Church, to the Bible, or  the sacraments; they allowed the Church teaching to exist as a necessary  conception for the people, but they placed their own teachings far above  it as mysterious or secret teachings. As regards their morals and  mode of life, the Gnostics generally went to extremes. It was due to  Gnosticism that art and science found an entrance into the Church. It  preserved the Church from becoming stereotyped in form; but, built up  entirely on ideas and not on historical facts, it died from its own  hollowness and eccentricity.    We still possess the traces of the Gnostic astrology in a number of  amulets and engraved gems, with the word _Abraxas_ or rather _Abrasax_  and other emblems of their superstition, which they kept as charms  against diseases and evil spirits. The word _Abrasax_ may be translated  _Hurt me not_. To their mystic rites we may trace many of the reproaches  thrown upon Christianity, such as that the Christians worshipped the  head of an ass, using the animal's Koptic name _Eeo_, to represent the  name of IAn, or Jahveh. To the same source we may also trace some of  the peculiarities of the Christian fathers, such as St. Ambrose calling  Jesus \"the good scarabaeus, who rolled up before him the hitherto  un-shapen mud of our bodies;\" a thought which seems to have been  borrowed as much from the hieroglyphics as from the insect's habits; and  perhaps from the Egyptian priests in some cases, using the scarabous  to denote the god Horus-Ra, and sometimes the word _only begotten_. We  trace this thought on the Gnostic gems where Ave see a winged griffin  rolling before him a wheel, the emblem of eternity. He sits like a  conqueror on horseback, trampling under foot the serpent of old, the  spirit of sin and death. His horse is in the form of a ram, with an  eagle's head and the crowned asp or basilisk for its tail. Before him  stands the figure of victory giving him a crown; above are written the  words Alpha and Omega, and below perhaps the word [IAH], Jahveh.    So far we have seen the form which Christianity at first took among the  Egyptians; but, as few writings by these Gnostics have come down to  our time, we chiefly know their opinions from the reproaches of their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17332"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 12 (of 12) (#15)"],[1,"offered him assistance, and ardently wished for  his coming. By a sudden assault on Jaffa, Acre, and some other badly  fortified places, he might in a short time gain possession of Syria,  add this fine conquest to that of Egypt, make himself master of  the Euphrates, as he was of the Nile, and thus command all the  communications with India.    [Illustration: 112.jpg A FOUNTAIN AT CAIRO]    Bonaparte commenced his march very early in February at the head of  Kleber's, Regnier's, Lannes's, Bon's, and Murat's divisions, about  thirteen thousand strong. He arrived before the fort El Arish on  February 15th, and, after a slight resistance, the garrison surrendered  themselves prisoners, to the number of thirteen hundred men. Ibrahim  Bey, having attempted to relieve it, was put to flight, and, after a  severe march across the desert, they reached Gaza. They took that place  in the sight of Djezzar Pasha, and found there, as in the fort of El  Arish, a great quantity of ammunition and provisions. From Gaza the army  proceeded to Jaffa (the ancient Joppa), where it arrived on March 3rd.  This place was surrounded by a massive wall, flanked by towers, and it  contained a garrison of four thousand men. Bonaparte caused a breach  to be battered in the wall, and then summoned the commandant, who only  answered by cutting off the head of the messenger. The assault was made,  and the place stormed with extraordinary intrepidity, and given up  for thirty hours to pillage and massacre. Here, too, was found a  considerable quantity of artillery and supplies of all kinds. There  were some thousands of prisoners, whom the general could not despatch to  Egypt, because he had not the ordinary means for escorting them, and he  would not send them back to the enemy to swell their ranks. Bonaparte  decided on a terrible measure, the most cruel act of his life.  Transported into a barbarous country, he had adopted its manners, and he  ordered all the prisoners to be put to death. The army consummated with  obedience, but with a sort of horror, the execution that was commanded.    Bonaparte then advanced upon St. Jean d'Acre, the ancient Ptolemais,  situated at the foot of Mount Carmel. It was the only place that could  now stop him. If he could make himself master of this fortress, Syria  would be his. But the ferocious Djezzar had shut himself up there, with  all his wealth and a strong garrison, and he also reckoned upon support  from Sir Sidney Smith, then cruising off that coast, who supplied him  with engineers, artillerymen, and ammunition. It was probable, moreover,  that he would be soon relieved by the Turkish army collected in Syria,  which was advancing from Damascus to cross the Jordan. Bonaparte  hastened to attack the place, in hopes of taking it, as he had done  Jaffa, before it was reinforced with fresh troops, and before the  English had time to improve its defences. The trenches were immediately  opened. The siege artillery sent by sea from Alexandria had been  intercepted by Sir Sidney Smith, who captured seven vessels out of the  nine. A breach was effected, and dispositions were made for the assault,  but the men were stopped by a counterscarp and a ditch. They immediately  set about mining. The operation was carried on under the fire of all  the ramparts, and of the fine artillery which Sir Sidney Smith had taken  from the French. The mine was exploded on April 17th, and blew up only  a portion of the counterscarp. Unluckily for the French, the place had  received a reinforcement of several thousand men, a great number of  gunners trained after the European fashion, and immense supplies. It was  a siege on a large scale to be carried on with thirteen thousand men,  almost entirely destitute of artillery. It was necessary to open a new  mine to blow up the entire counterscarp, and to commence another covered  way.    Bonaparte now ordered Kleber's division to oppose the passage of the  Jordan by the army coming from Damascus. The enemy was commanded by Abd  Allah Pasha of Damascus, and numbered about twenty-five thousand men  and twelve thousand horse. A desperate battle was fought in the plain of  Fouli, and for six hours Kleber, with scarcely three thousand infantry  in square, resisted the utmost fury of the Turkish cavalry. Bonaparte,  who had been making a rapid march to join Kleber, suddenly made his  appearance on the field of battle. A tremendous fire, discharged  instantaneously from the three points of this triangle, assailed the  Mamluks who were in the midst, drove them in confusion upon one another,  and made them flee in disorder in all directions. Kleber's division,  fired with fresh ardour at this sight, rushed upon the village of Eouli,  stormed it at the point of the bayonet, and made a great carnage among  the enemy. In a moment the whole multitude was gone, and the plain was  left covered with dead. During this interval the besiegers had never  ceased mining and countermining about the walls of St. Jean d'Acre. The  siege of Acre lasted for sixty-five days. Bonaparte made eight desperate  but ineffectual assaults upon the city, which were repulsed by eleven  furious sallies on the part of the besieged garrison. It was absolutely  necessary to relinquish the enterprise. The strategic point in the East  was lost.    [Illustration: 116b.jpg Cairo--Eskibieh Quarter]    For two months the army had been before Acre; it had sustained  considerable losses, and it would have been imprudent to expose it to  more. The plague was in Acre, and the army had caught the contagion at  Jaffa. The season for landing troops approached, and the arrival of a  Turkish army near the mouths of the Nile was expected. By persisting  longer, Bonaparte was liable to weaken himself to such a degree as  not to be able to repulse new enemies. The main point of his plan was  effected, since he had rendered the enemy in that quarter incapable of  acting. He now commenced his march to recross the desert.    Bonaparte at length reached Egypt after an expedition of nearly  three months. It was high time for him to return; for the spirit  of insurrection had spread throughout the whole Delta. His presence  produced everywhere submission and tranquillity. He gave orders for  magnificent festivities at Cairo to celebrate his triumphs in Syria. He  had to curb not only the inhabitants, but his own generals and the army  itself. A deep discontent pervaded it. They had been for a whole year  in Egypt. It was now the month of June, and they were still ignorant of  what was passing in Europe, and of the disasters of France. They  merely knew that the Continent was in confusion, and that a new war was  inevitable. Bonaparte impatiently waited for further particulars, that  he might decide what course to pursue, and return, in case of need, to  the first theatre of his exploits. But he hoped first to destroy the  second Turkish army assembled at Rhodes, the very speedy landing of  which was announced.    This army, put on board numerous transports and escorted by Sir Sidney  Smith's squadron, appeared on July 11th in sight of Alexandria, and  came to anchor in the road of Abukir, where the French squadron had been  destroyed. The point chosen by the English for landing was the peninsula  which commands the entrance to the road, and bears the same name. The  Turks landed with great boldness, attacked the intrenchments sword  in hand, carried them, and made themselves masters of the village of  Abukir, putting to death the garrison. The village being taken, it was  impossible for the fort to hold out, and it was obliged to surrender.  Marmont, who commanded at Alexandria, left the city at the head of  twelve hundred men to hasten to the assistance of the troops at Abukir.  But, learning that the Turks had landed in considerable numbers, he did  not dare to attempt to throw them into the sea by a bold attack, and  returned to Alexandria, leaving them to establish themselves quietly in  the peninsula of Abukir.    [Illustration: 119.jpg CAIRO FROM THE LEFT BANK OF THE NILE]    The Turks amounted to nearly eighteen thousand infantry. They had no  cavalry, for they had not brought more than three hundred horses, but  they expected the arrival of Murad Bey, who was to leave Upper Egypt,  skirt the desert, cross the oases, and throw himself into Abukir with  two or three thousand Mamluks.    When Bonaparte was informed of the particulars of the landing, he  immediately left Cairo, and made from that city to Alexandria one of  those extraordinary marches of which he had given so many examples in  Italy. He took with him the divisions of Lannes, Bon, and Murat. He had  ordered Desaix to evacuate Upper Egypt, and Kleber and Regnier, who were  in the Delta, to approach Abukir. He had chosen the point of Birket,  midway between Alexandria and Abukir, at which to concentrate his  forces, and to manouvre according to circumstances. He was afraid that  an English army had landed with the Turks. The next day, the 7th, he was  at the entrance of the peninsula.    Bonaparte made his dispositions with his usual promptitude and decision.  He ordered General D 'Estaing, with some battalions, to march to the  hill on the left, where the one thousand Turks were posted; Lannes to  march to that on the right, where the two thousand others were; and  Murat, who was at the centre, to make the cavalry file on the rear of  the two hills. D'Estaing marched to the hill on the left and boldly  ascended it: Murat caused it to be turned by a squadron. The Turks, at  sight of this, quitted their post, and fell in with the cavalry, which  cut them to pieces, and drove them into the sea, into which they chose  rather to throw themselves than to surrender. Precisely the same thing  was done on the right. Lannes attacked the two thousand janizaries;  Murat turned them, cut them in pieces, and drove them into the sea.  D'Estaing and Lannes then moved towards the centre,"]]]
