He sees the chamber of the  woman in labor, the seated, shuddering, writhing form, the mother  struggling against maternity, dreading her release, for the king's  officer is standing by the door, ready, as soon as a male child is born,  to put it to death.    The Arabs who gave him shelter were also children of Abraham, and they  related to him legends of the ancient days. They told him of the  patriarchs who lay buried in Canaan with their wives; they spoke of the  God whom his fathers had worshiped. Then, as one who returns to a long  lost home, the Egyptian returned to the faith of the desert, to the God  of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. As he wandered on the mountain heights,  he looked to the west and saw a desert; beyond it lay Canaan, the home  of his ancestors, a land of peace and soon to be a land of hope. For  now, new ideas rose tumultuously within him. _He began to see visions  and to dream dreams._ He heard voices and beheld no form; he saw trees  which blazed with fire and yet were not consumed. He became a prophet  and entered into the ecstatic stage. _That is, he began to have  illusions and hallucinations._    Dwelling on the misery and suffering of his people, his mind becomes  deluded with the idea that he has been chosen by his new-found God to  liberate his people from the tyranny of their oppressors.    Meanwhile the king had died, and a new Pharaoh had ascended the throne.  Moses returns to Egypt to carry out the great designs which he had  formed. He announces to the elders of his people, to the heads of the  houses, and the sheiks of the tribes that the God of Abraham had  appeared to him in Sinai and had revealed his true name. It was Jehovah.  He had been sent by Jehovah to Egypt to bring away his people, to lead  them to Canaan.    In company with his brother, Aaron, Moses asked Pharaoh to liberate the  children of Israel, but after several vain attempts to dazzle Pharaoh  with his skill as a magician, he was met with an obstinate refusal.  Moses before Pharaoh descends to the level of a vulgar sorcerer, armed  with a magic wand, whose performances only draw our smiles. This  charlatanry having been unsuccessful, the wizard connives with his  accomplice Jehovah to have inflicted upon the Egyptians the ten plagues.  Then the loving and kind Father, having killed innumerable Egyptians, as  the story relates, so terrorizes the minds of his other children in  Egypt, that Pharaoh is finally convinced that he must allow the Chosen  People to leave his domain. The Israelites quitted Egypt carrying away  with them the gold and silver of their oppressors. They then entered  the desert.    The magic art of Moses enabled them to pass dry-footed through the Red  Sea, whereas the Pharaoh who was pursuing them was engulfed with his  whole army. Again the Chosen People are liberated by means of the death  of multitudes of Egyptians. Truly, Jehovah at that time must have loved  them well, or did some other Deity form the Egyptians? It matters not  that the crossing of the Red Sea and the drowning of Pharaoh are  romantic incidents, not only unknown to the Egyptian texts, but even to  the earliest of Hebrew prophets. It matters not, for the story is the  important thing, even though it is an inspired story, inspired by the  Jehovah who tortured and killed the Egyptians to show how well he loved  _his_ people.    This Wild West story, with its multitudes of slaughters, proceeds to the  wilderness of Sinai; and there again, the Prophet Moses goes into a  secret seance and finally announces that God had delivered laws to him,  which had been issued from the clouds.    What a great showman was this Prophet! Barnum must have been a devoted  admirer of Moses, for Moses was the first to create the two-ring circus;  for these laws given by Jehovah are described in two places, and the  circus varies in both places. Exodus XX and Exodus XXXIV are the two  texts which differ considerably.    To further convince the Children of Israel, Moses tells them the story  of how he had cajoled Jehovah into allowing him to see what no man had  hitherto seen, the form of Jehovah, for it appears that Jehovah was so  pleased with this murderer, charlatan, and wizard that he allowed him to  glimpse His hind quarters. At least, Jehovah had a sense of humor!    What a bag of tricks this Prophet had at his command! The Prophet waves  his arms and tugs at his gown, and lo and behold! The Lord has spoken!  The following is a specimen of the revelations which the Lord is  supposed to have dictated to Moses. (Leviticus XIV, 25.)    \"The priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering and  put it upon the tip of the _right_ ear of him who is to be cleansed and  upon the thumb of his _right_ hand, and upon the great toe of his  _right_ foot, and the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his  own _left_ hand and shall sprinkle with his _right_ finger some of the  oil that is in his _left_ hand seven times before the Lord.\"    Surely, it must have been a God with a superior mentality who dictated  this, for it surpasses our feeble comprehension. And we can well imagine  Jehovah's wrath when the priest confuses his _right_ and _left_.    Twirling his arms again, Moses gives forth this oracle (Numbers XV,  37-41): \"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 'Speak unto the Children  of Israel, and bid them that they make them a fringe upon the corner of  their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the  fringe of each corner a cord of blue, etc., etc.\"    Jehovah chooses Blue as the divine color. Royal Purple. Divine Blue.  Then there is the familiar myth of the Prophet's tapping of the rock to  bring forth water in the desert; the story of the manna; the tale of the  doves.    Thus can the fabled life of Moses be divided into two stages, the early  period of illusions, hallucinations, and delusions, and the later stage  of wizardry, charlatanry, and demagoguery. Neither must we think that we  moderns are the first to peer through this sham, for what the  Israelites thought of these laws appears from the bitter criticism of  Moses and Aaron, which the Haggadah put into the mouth of the rebel  Korah.    \"When we were given the ten commandments, each of us learnt them  directly from Mount Sinai; there were only the ten commandments and we  heard no orders about 'offering cake' or 'gifts to priests' or  'tassels.' It was only in order to usurp the dominion for himself and to  impart honor to his brother Aaron, that Moses added all this.\"    Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed--these prophets whose adherents number  hundreds of millions, about whom there has been built up those vast  systems of theology,--what is there of the divine in their characters?  What supernatural in their deeds? What wisdom poured forth from their  lips which did not come from other philosophers? What immense structures  have been founded on these shifting sands, on this morass of ignorance  and childish fable? How long can these structures endure, aided by the  bolstering up of the theologists, and how long must it be before the  light of reason will pierce these foundations of blindness and force  them to topple over? How much longer before humanity can begin to build  on a sound foundation?    Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed; revolutionists three. Moses at the head of a  weak, squabbling, and disgruntled group of Hebrew desert marauders.  Jesus sanctioning the insurrection against Rome. Mohammed at the head of  his Arabian marauders.    If the freethinkers firmly believe that in them dwell the hope for a  better humanity, for an exhilarated progress, for universal freedom and  liberty for all mankind, and emancipation from fear and superstition,  then they, too, must destroy. They must first undo the wrong before they  can proceed to build on a right foundation.    They must build on the corner stone that all religion is human in its  origin, erroneous in its theories, and ridiculous in its threats and  rewards. Religion is the greatest impediment to the progress of human  happiness.          CHAPTER IV    SOUNDNESS OF A FOUNDATION FOR A BELIEF IN A DEITY        _It is better to bury a delusion and forget it than to insult its      memory by retaining the name when the thing has perished_.        F. H. BRADLEY.        _A thousand miraculous happenings have been honoured by the      testimony of the ancients, which in later times under a more      exacting and sceptical scrutiny can no longer be believed. Inherent      in man's nature is his disposition to be gulled.... Emotion is      encouraged to supplant cool reason, fanaticism to supplant      tolerance. Not by such means can our race be saved_.        LLEWELYN POWYS.      Our interplanetary visitor is firmly convinced that all religion, no  matter what its antiquity or its modernity may be, is an invention of  our groping earthly minds. It occurs to him that it would be interesting  and proper to lay aside all theology, all creed, all the superficial  trappings placed by man about his conceptions of a deity, and consider  only the basic God-idea. The literature on the subject revealed to him  that even on this broad and basic principle not all religionists were  agreed. He found a threefold classification:    (1) Those who held to the belief in an anthropomorphic personal God who  was benevolent, omniscient, and omnipotent.    (2) Those who saw in the constitution of our universe an impersonal  Supreme Power, who had created the universe, but who had not given us  any revelation, and thus has no need for worship by prayer and  sacrifice.    (3) Those who very recently conceived of the deity as a \"cosmic force,\"  an \"ultimate,\" or as a mathematical or physical law. Such are the  hypotheses of Jeans and Eddington. The Martian set about, therefore,  with the principle that, \"God is a hypothesis, and as such, stands in  need of proof.\"    ("]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2028"],[0,"The Yellow Claw (#15)"],[1,"saved me the trouble of ringing  you up.\"    \"What?\"--Soames' eyes half closed, from the bottom lids upwards:--\"there  is something\"...    \"There is a trifling service which I require of you--yes, my dear  Soames.\"    \"Is it?\"...    \"We will discuss the matter to-morrow evening. Oh! it is a mere trifle.  So good-by for the present.\"    Soames, with the fingers of his two hands interlocked before him, and  his thumbs twirling rapidly around one another, stood in the lobby,  gazing reflectively at the rug-strewn floor. He was working out in his  mind how handsomely this first payment would show up on the welcome  side of his passbook. Truly, he was fortunate in having met the generous  Gianapolis....    He thought of a trifling indiscretion committed at the expense of one  Mr. Mapleson, and of the wine-bill of Colonel Hewett; and he thought of  the apparently clairvoyant knowledge of the Greek. A cloud momentarily  came between his perceptive and the rosy horizon.    But nearer to the foreground of the mental picture, uprose a left-hand  page of his pass book; and its tidings of great joy, written in clerkly  hand, served to dispel the cloud.    Soames sighed in gentle rapture, and, soft-footed, passed into his own  room.    Certainly his duties were neither difficult nor unpleasant. The mistress  of the house lived apparently in a hazy dream-world of her own, and Mr.  Leroux was the ultimate expression of the non-commercial. Mr. Soames  could have robbed him every day had he desired to do so; but he had  refrained from availing himself even of those perquisites which he  considered justly his; for it was evident, to his limited intelligence,  that greater profit was to be gained by establishing himself in this  household than by weeding-out five shillings here, and half-a-sovereign  there, at the risk of untimely dismissal.    Yet--it was a struggle! All Mr. Soames' commercial instincts were up in  arms against this voice of a greater avarice which counseled abstention.  For instance: he could have added half-a-sovereign a week to his  earnings by means of a simple arrangement with the local wine merchant.  Leroux's cigars he could have sold by the hundreds; for Leroux, when a  friend called, would absently open a new box, entirely forgetful of the  fact that a box from which but two--or at most three--cigars had been  taken, lay already on the bureau.    Mr. Soames, in order to put his theories to the test, had temporarily  abstracted half-a-dozen such boxes from the study and the dining-room  and had hidden them. Leroux, finding, as he supposed, that he was out of  cigars, had simply ordered Soames to get him some more.    \"Er--about a dozen boxes--er--Soames,\" he had said; \"of the same sort!\"    Was ever a man of business submitted to such an ordeal? After receiving  those instructions, Soames had sat for close upon an hour in his own  room, contemplating the six broken boxes, containing in all some five  hundred and ninety cigars; but the voice within prevailed; he must court  no chance of losing his situation; therefore, he \"discovered\" these six  boxes in a cupboard--much to Henry Leroux's surprise!    Then, Leroux regularly sent him to the Charing Cross branch of the  London County and Suburban Bank with open checks! Sometimes, he would be  sent to pay in, at other times to withdraw; the amounts involved varying  from one guinea to 150 pounds! But, as he told himself, on almost every  occasion that he went to Leroux's bank, he was deliberately throwing  money away, deliberately closing his eyes to the good fortune which this  careless and gullible man cast in his path. He observed a scrupulous  honesty in all these dealings, with the result that the bank manager  came to regard him as a valuable and trustworthy servant, and said as  much to the assistant manager, expressing his wonder that Leroux--whose  account occasioned the bank more anxiety, and gave it more work, than  that of any other two depositors--had at last engaged a man who would  keep his business affairs in order!    And these were but a few of the golden apples which Mr. Soames permitted  to slip through his fingers, so steadfast was he in his belief that  Gianapolis would be as good as his word, and make his fortune.    Leroux employed no secretary; and his MSS. were typed at his agent's  office. A most slovenly man in all things, and in business matters  especially, he was the despair, not only of his banker, but of his  broker; he was a man who, in professional parlance, \"deserved to be  robbed.\" It is improbable that he had any but the haziest ideas, at  any particular time, respecting the state of his bank balance and  investments. He detested the writing of business letters, and was  always at great pains to avoid anything in the nature of a commercial  rendezvous. He would sign any document which his lawyer or his broker  cared to send him, with simple, unquestioned faith.    His bank he never visited, and his appearance was entirely unfamiliar  to the staff. True, the manager knew him slightly, having had two  interviews with him: one when the account was opened, and the second  when Leroux introduced his solicitor and broker--in order that in the  future he might not be troubled in any way with business affairs.    Mr. Soames perceived more and more clearly that the mild deception  projected was unlikely to be discovered by its victim; and, at the  appointed time, he hastened to the corner of Victoria Street, to his  appointment with Gianapolis. The latter was prompt, for Soames perceived  his radiant smile afar off.    The saloon bar of the Red Lion was affably proposed by Mr. Gianapolis  as a suitable spot to discuss the business. Soames agreed, not without  certain inward qualms; for the proximity of the hostelry to New Scotland  Yard was a disquieting circumstance.    However, since Gianapolis affected to treat their negotiations in  the light of perfectly legitimate business, he put up no protest, and  presently found himself seated in a very cozy corner of the saloon bar,  with a glass of whisky-and-soda on a little table before him, bubbling  in a manner which rendered it an agreeable and refreshing sight in the  eyes of Mr. Soames.    \"You know,\" said Gianapolis, the gaze of his left eye bisecting that  of his right in a most bewildering manner, \"they call this 'the 'tec's  tabernacle!'\"    \"Indeed,\" said Soames, without enthusiasm; \"I suppose some of the  Scotland Yard men do drop in now and then?\"    \"Beyond doubt, my dear Soames.\"    Soames responded to his companion's radiant smile with a smile of his  own by no means so pleasant to look upon. Soames had the type of face  which, in repose, might be the face of an honest man; but his smile  would have led to his instant arrest on any racecourse in Europe: it was  the smile of a pick-pocket.    \"Now,\" continued Gianapolis, \"here is a quarter's salary in advance.\"    From a pocket-book, he took a little brown paper envelope and from the  brown paper envelope counted out four five-pound notes, five golden  sovereigns, one half-sovereign, and ten shillings' worth of silver.  Soames' eyes glittered, delightedly.    \"A little informal receipt?\" smiled Gianapolis, raising his eyebrows,  satanically. \"Here on this page of my notebook I have written: 'Received  from Mr. King for service rendered, 26 pounds, being payment, in  advance, of amount due on 31st October 19--' I have attached a stamp  to the page, as you will see,\" continued Gianapolis, \"and here is a  fountain-pen. Just sign across the stamp, adding to-day's date.\"    Soames complied with willing alacrity; and Gianapolis having carefully  blotted the signature, replaced the notebook in his pocket, and politely  acknowledged the return of the fountain-pen. Soames, glancing furtively  about him, replaced the money in the envelope, and thrust the latter  carefully into a trouser pocket.    \"Now,\" resumed Gianapolis, \"we must not permit our affairs of business  to interfere with our amusements.\"    He stepped up to the bar and ordered two more whiskies with soda. These  being sampled, business was resumed.    \"To-morrow,\" said Gianapolis, leaning forward across the table so that  his face almost touched that of his companion, \"you will be entrusted by  Mr. Leroux with a commission.\"...    Soames nodded eagerly, his eyes upon the speaker's face.    \"You will accompany Mrs. Leroux to the bank,\" continued Gianapolis, \"in  order that she may write a specimen signature, in the presence of the  manager, for transmission to the Credit Lyonnais in Paris.\"...    Soames nearly closed his little eyes in his effort to comprehend.    \"A draft in her favor,\" continued the Greek, \"has been purchased by  Mr. Leroux's bank from the Paris bank, and, on presentation of this, a  checkbook will be issued to Mrs. Leroux by the Credit Lyonnais in Paris  to enable her to draw at her convenience upon that establishment against  the said order. Do you follow me?\"    Soames nodded rapidly, eager to exhibit an intelligent grasp of the  situation.    \"Now\"--Gianapolis lowered his voice impressively--\"no one at the Charing  Cross branch of the London County and Suburban Bank has ever seen Mrs.  Leroux!--Oh! we have been careful of that, and we shall be careful in  the future. You are known already as an accredited agent of Leroux;  therefore\"--he bent yet closer to Soames' ear--\"you will direct the  chauffeur to drop you, not at the Strand entrance, but at the side  entrance. You follow?\"    Soames, almost holding his breath, nodded again.    \"At the end of the court, in which the latter entrance is situated, a  lady dressed in the same manner as Mrs. Leroux (this is arranged)  will be waiting. Mrs. Leroux will walk straight up the court, into the  corridor of Bank Chambers by the back entrance, and from thence out into  the Strand. YOU will escort the second lady into the manager's office,  and she will sign 'Mira Leroux' instead of the real"]]]
