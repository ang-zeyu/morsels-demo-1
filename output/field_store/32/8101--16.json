And why not? Dogs, on the whole, are  every whit as reasoning and reflective as the bulk of human beings! And  how much nobler! Compare, for a moment, the dogs you know--no matter  whether mastiffs, retrievers, dachshunds, poodles, or even Pekinese,  with your acquaintances--with the people you see everywhere around  you--false, greedy, spiteful, scandal-loving women, money-grubbing  attorneys, lying, swindling tradesmen, vulgar parvenus, finicky curates,  brutal roughs, spoilt, cruel children, hypocrites of both sexes--compare  them carefully--and the comparison is entirely in favour of the dog!  And if the creating Power (or Powers) has favoured these wholly selfish  and degenerate human beings with spirits, and has conferred on certain  of them the faculty of projecting those spirits, can one imagine, for  one moment, that similar gifts have been denied to dogs--their superiors  in every respect? Pshaw! Out upon it! To think so would mean to think  the unthinkable, to attribute to God qualities of partiality, injustice  and whimsicality, which would render Him little, if anything, better  than a James the Second of England, or a Louis the Fifteenth of France.    Besides, from my own experience, and the experiences of those with whom  I have been brought in contact, I can safely affirm that there are  phantasms (and therefore spirits) of both living and dead dogs in just  the same proportion as there are phantasms (and therefore spirits) of  both living and dead human beings.      _Psychic Properties of Dogs_    Some, not all, dogs--like cats--possess the psychic property of scenting  the advent of death, and they indicate their fear of it by the most  dismal howling. In my opinion there is very little doubt that dogs  actually see some kind of phantasm that, knowing when death is about to  take place, visits the house of the doomed and stands beside his, or  her, couch. I have had this phantasm described to me, by those who  declare they have seen it, as a very tall, hooded figure, clad in a  dark, loose, flowing costume--its face never discernible. It would, of  course, be foolish to say that a dog howling in a house is invariably  the sign of death; there are many other and obvious causes which produce  something of a similar effect; but I think one may be pretty well  assured that, when the howling is accompanied by unmistakable signs of  terror, then someone, either in the house at the time, or connected  with someone in the house, will shortly die.      _Dogs in Haunted Houses_    When I investigate a haunted house, I generally take a dog with me,  because experience has taught me that a dog seldom fails to give notice,  in some way or another--either by whining, or growling, or crouching  shivering at one's feet, or springing on one's lap and trying to bury  its head in one's coat--of the proximity of a ghost. I had a dog with  me, when ghost-hunting, not so very long ago, in a well-known haunted  house in Gloucestershire. The dog--my only companion--and I sat on the  staircase leading from the hall to the first floor. Just about two  o'clock the dog gave a loud growl. I put my hand out and found it was  shivering from head to foot. Almost directly afterwards I heard the loud  clatter of fire-irons from somewhere away in the basement, a door  banged, and then something, or someone, began to ascend the stairs. Up,  up, up came the footsteps, until I could see--first of all a bluish  light, then the top of a head, then a face, white and luminous, staring  up at me. A few more steps, and the whole thing was disclosed to view.  It was the figure of a girl of about sixteen, with a shock head of red  hair, on which was stuck, all awry, a dirty little, old-fashioned  servant's cap. She was clad in a cotton dress, soiled and bedraggled,  and had on her feet a pair of elastic-sided boots, that looked as if  they would fall to pieces each step she took. But it was her face that  riveted my attention most. It was startlingly white and full of an  expression of the most hopeless misery. The eyes, wide open and glassy,  were turned direct on mine. I was too appalled either to stir or utter a  sound. The phantasm came right up to where I stood, paused for a second,  and then slowly went on; up, up, up, until a sudden bend in the  staircase hid it from view. For some seconds there was a continuation of  the footsteps, then there came a loud splash from somewhere outside and  below--and then silence--sepulchral and omnipotent.    I did not wait to see if anything further would happen. I fled, and  Dick, my dog friend, who was apparently even more frightened than I,  fled with me. We arrived home--panic-stricken.    Over and over again, on similar occasions, I have had a dog with me, and  the same thing has occurred--the dog has made some noise indicative of  great fear, remaining in a state of stupor during the actual presence of  the apparition.      _Psychic Propensities of Dogs compared with those of Cats_    Though dogs are, perhaps, rather more alarmed at the Unknown than cats,  I do not think they have a keener sense of its proximity. Still, for the  very reason that they show greater--more unmistakable--indications of  fear, they make surer psychic barometers. The psychic faculty of scent  in dogs would seem to be more limited than that in cats; for, whereas  cats can not only detect the advent and presence of pleasant and  unpleasant phantoms by their smells, few dogs can do more than detect  the approach of death. Dogs make friends nearly, if not quite, as  readily with cruel and brutal people as with kind ones, simply because  they cannot, so easily as cats, distinguish by their scent the  unpleasant types of spirits cruel and brutal people attract; in all  probability, they are not even aware of the presence of such spirits.    It would seem, on the face of it, that since dogs are, on the whole, of  a gentler disposition than cats, that is to say, not quite so cruel and  savage, the phantasms of dogs would be less likely to be earth-bound  than those of cats; but, then, one must take into consideration the  other qualities of the two animals, and when these are put in the  balance, one may find little to choose--morally--between the cat and  the dog. Anyhow, after making allowance for the fact that many more cats  die unnatural deaths than dogs, there would seem to be small numerical  difference in their hauntings--cases of dog ghosts appearing to be just  as common as cases of cat ghosts.    Apropos of phantom dogs, my friend Dr. G. West writes to me thus:--    \"Of the older English Universities many stories are told of bizarre  happenings,--of duels, raggings, suicides and such-like--in olden times;  but of K., venerable, illustrious K. of Ireland, few and far between are  the accounts of similar occurrences. This is one, however, and it deals  with the phantom of a dog:--    \"One evening, towards the end of the eighteenth century, John Kelly, a  Dean of the College (extremely unpopular on account of his supposed  harsh treatment of some of the undergraduates), was about to commence  his supper, when he heard a low whine, and looking down, saw a large  yellow dog cross the floor in front of him, and disappear immediately  under the full-length portrait that hung over the antique chimney-piece.  Something prompting him, he glanced at the picture. The eyes that looked  into his blinked.    \"'It must be the result of an overtaxed brain,' he said to himself.  'Those rascally undergraduates have got on my nerves.'    \"He shut his eyes; and re-opening them, stared hard at the portrait. It  was not a delusion. The eyes that gazed back at him were alive--alive  with the spirit of mockery; they smiled, laughed, jeered; and, as they  did so, the knowledge of his surroundings was brought forcibly home to  him. The room in which he was seated was situated at the end of a long,  cheerless, stone passage in the western wing of the College. Away from  all the other rooms of the building, it was absolutely isolated; and had  long borne the reputation of being haunted by a dog, which was said to  appear only before some catastrophe. The Dean had hitherto committed the  story to the category of fables. But now,--now, as he sat all alone in  that big silent room, lit only with the reddish rays of a fast-setting  August sun, and stared into the gleaming eyes before him--he was obliged  to admit the extreme probability of spookdom. Never before had the  College seemed so quiet. Not a sound--not even the creaking of a board  or the far-away laugh of a student, common enough noises on most  nights--fell on his ears. The hush was omnipotent, depressing,  unnerving; he could only associate it with the supernatural. Though he  was too fascinated to remove his gaze from the thing before him, he  could feel the room fill with shadows, and feel them steal through the  half-open windows, and, uniting with those already in the corners, glide  noiselessly and surreptitiously towards him. He felt, too, that he was  under the surveillance of countless invisible visages, all scanning him  curiously, and delighted beyond measure at the sight of his terror.    \"The moments passed in a breathless state of tension. He stared at the  eyes, and the eyes stared back at him. Once he endeavoured to rise, but  a dead weight seemed to fall on his shoulders and hold him back; and  twice, when he tried to speak--to make some sound, no matter what, to  break the appalling silence--his throat closed as if under the pressure  of cruel, relentless fingers.    \"But the _Ultima Thule_ of his emotions had yet to come. There was a  slight stir behind the canvas, a thud, a hollow groan that echoed and  re-echoed throughout the room like the muffled clap of distant thunder,  and the eyes suddenly underwent a metamorphosis-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18237"],[0,"A Bird Calendar for Northern India (#15)"],[1,"to spend the day  there. At dawn a net is quietly stretched across one end of the field.  A rope is then slowly dragged along over the growing crop in the  direction of the net. This sends all the quail into the net.    Very fair sport may be obtained in July by shooting rain-quail that  have been attracted by call birds.    July marks the end of one breeding season and the beginning of  another. As regards the nesting season, birds fall into four classes.  There is the very large class that nests in spring and summer. Next in  importance is the not inconsiderable body that rears up its broods in  the rains when the food supply is most abundant. Then comes the small  company that builds nests in the pleasant winter time. Lastly there  are the perennials--such birds as the sparrow and the dove, which nest  at all seasons. In the present month the last of the summer nesting  birds close operations for the year, and the monsoon birds begin to  lay their eggs. July is therefore a favourable month for bird-nesting.  Moreover, the sun is sometimes obscured by cloud and, under such  conditions, a human being is able to remain out of doors throughout  the day without suffering much physical discomfort.    With July ends the normal breeding season of the tree-pies,  white-eyes, ioras; king-crows, bank-mynas, paradise flycatchers, brown  rock-chats, Indian robins, dhayals, red-winged bush-larks, sunbirds,  rollers, swifts, green pigeons, lapwings and butcher-birds.    The paradise flycatchers leave Northern India and migrate southwards a  few weeks after the young birds have left the nest.    Numbers of bulbuls' nests are likely to be found in July, but the  breeding time of these birds is rapidly drawing to its close. Sparrows  and doves are of course engaged in parental duties; their eggs have  been taken in every month of the year.    The nesting season is now at its height for the white-necked storks,  the koels and their dupes--the house-crows, also for the various  babblers and their deceivers--the brain-fever birds and the pied  crested cuckoos. The tailor-birds, the ashy and the Indian  wren-warblers, the brahminy mynas, the wire-tailed swallows, the  amadavats, the sirkeer cuckoos, the pea-fowl, the water-hens, the  common and the pied mynas, the cuckoo-shrikes and the orioles are all  fully occupied with nursery duties. The earliest of the brain-fever  birds to be hatched have left the nest. Like all its family the young  hawk-cuckoo has a healthy appetite. In order to satisfy it the  unfortunate foster-parents have to work like slaves, and often must  they wonder why nature has given them so voracious a child. When it  sees a babbler approaching with food, the cuckoo cries out and flaps  its wings vigorously. Sometimes these completely envelop the parent  bird while it is thrusting food into the yellow mouth of the cuckoo.  The breast of the newly-fledged brain-fever bird is covered with dark  brown drops, so that, when seen from below, it looks like a thrush  with yellow legs. Its cries, however, are not at all thrushlike.    Many of the wire-tailed swallows, minivets and white-browed fantail  flycatchers bring up a second brood during the rains. The loud  cheerful call of the last is heard very frequently in July.    Numbers of young bee-eaters are to be seen hawking at insects; they  are distinguishable from adults by the dullness of the plumage and the  fact that the median tail feathers are not prolonged as bristles.    Very few crows emerge from the egg before the 1st of July, but, during  the last week in June, numbers of baby koels are hatched out. The  period of incubation for the koel's egg is shorter than that of the  crow, hence at the outset the baby koel steals a march on his  foster-brothers. Koel nestlings, when they first emerge from the egg,  differ greatly in appearance from baby crows. The skin of the koel is  black, that of crow is pink for the first two days of its existence,  but it grows darker rapidly. The baby crow is the bigger bird and has  a larger mouth with fleshy sides. The sides of the mouth of the young  koel are not fleshy. The neck of the crow nestling is long and the  head hangs down, whereas the koel's neck is short and the bird carries  its head huddled in its shoulders. Crows nest high up in trees, these  facts are therefore best observed by sending up an expert climber with  a tin half-full of sawdust to which a long string is attached. The  climber lets down the eggs or nestlings in the tin and the observer  can examine them in comfort on _terra firma_. The parent crows do not  appear to notice how unlike the young koels are to their own  nestlings, for they feed them most assiduously and make a great uproar  when the koels are taken from the nest. Baby crows are noisy  creatures; koels are quiet and timid at first, but become noisier as  they grow older.    The feathers of crow nestlings are black in each sex. Young koels fall  into three classes: those of which the feathers are all black, those  of which a few feathers have white or reddish tips, those which are  speckled black and white all over because each feather has a white  tip. The two former appear to be young cocks and the last to be hens.  Baby koels, in addition to hatching out before their foster-brethren,  develop more quickly, so that they leave the nest fully a week in  advance of the young corvi. After vacating the nest they squat for  some days on a branch close by; numbers of them are to be seen thus in  suitable localities towards the end of July. At first the call of the  koel is a squeak, but later it takes the form of a creditable, if  ludicrous, attempt at a caw. The young cuckoo does not seem to be able  to distinguish its foster-parents from other crows; it clamours for  food whenever any crow comes near it.    Of the scenes characteristic of the rains in India none is more  pleasing than that presented by a colony of nest-building bayas or  weaver-birds (_Ploceus baya_). These birds build in company. Sometimes  more than twenty of their wonderful retort-like nests are to be seen  in one tree. This means that more than forty birds are at work, and,  as each of these indulges in much cheerful twittering, the tree in  question presents an animated scene. Both sexes take part in  nest-construction.    Having selected the branch of a tree from which the nest will hang,  the birds proceed to collect material. Each completed nest contains  many yards of fibre not much thicker than stout thread. Such material  is not found in quantity in nature. The bayas have, therefore, to  manufacture it. This is easily done. The building weaver-bird betakes  itself to a clump of elephant-grass, and, perching on one of the  blades, makes a notch in another near the base. Then, grasping with  its beak the edge of this blade above the notch, the baya flies away  and thus strips off a narrow strand. Sometimes the strand adheres to  the main part of the blade at the tip so firmly that the force of the  flying baya is not sufficient to sever it. The bird then swings for a  few seconds in mid-air, suspended by the strip of leaf. Not in the  least daunted the baya makes a fresh effort and flies off, still  gripping the strand firmly. At the third, if not at the second  attempt, the thin strip is completely severed. Having secured its  prize the weaver-bird proceeds to tear off one or two more strands and  then flies with these in its bill to the nesting site, uttering cries  of delight. The fibres obtained in this manner are bound round the  branch from which the nest will hang. More strands are added to form a  stalk; when this has attained a length of several inches it is  gradually expanded in the form of an umbrella or bell. The next step  is to weave a band of grass across the mouth of the bell. In this  condition the nest is often left unfinished. Indians call such  incomplete nests _jhulas_ or swings; they assert that these are made  in order that the cocks may sit in them and sing to their mates while  these are incubating the eggs. It may be, as \"Eha\" suggests, that at  this stage the birds are dissatisfied with the balance of the nest and  for this reason leave it. If the nest, at this point of its  construction, please the weaver-birds they proceed to finish it by  closing up the bell at one side of the cross-band to form a receptacle  for the eggs, and prolonging the other half of the bell into a long  tunnel or neck. This neck forms the entrance to the nest; towards its  extremity it becomes very flimsy so that it affords no foothold to an  enemy. Nearly every baya's nest contains some lumps of clay attached  to it. Jerdon was of opinion that the function of these is to balance  the nest properly. Indians state that the bird sticks fireflies into  the lumps of clay to light up the nest at night. This story has found  its way into some ornithological text-books. There is no truth in it.  The present writer is inclined to think that the object of these lumps  of clay is to prevent the light loofah-like nest swinging too  violently in a gale of wind.    Both sexes take part in nest-construction. After the formation of the  cross-bar at the mouth of the bell one of the birds sits inside and  the other outside, and they pass the strands to each other and thus  the weaving proceeds rapidly. While working at the nest the bayas,  more especially the cocks, are in a most excited state. They sing,  scream, flap their wings and snap the bill. Sometimes one cock in his  excitement attacks a neighbour by jumping on his back! This results in  a fight in which the birds flutter in the air, pecking at one another.  Often the combatants \"close\" for a few seconds, but neither bird seems  to get hurt in these little contests.    Every bird-lover should make a point of watching a company of  weaver-birds while these are constructing their nests. The tree or  trees in which they build can easily be located by sending a"]]]
