Thou must show forth that which will ensure the peace and the  well-being of the miserable and the down-trodden. Gird up the loins of  thine endeavor, that perchance thou mayest release the captive from his  chains, and enable him to attain unto true liberty.    Justice is, in this day, bewailing its plight, and Equity groaneth beneath  the yoke of oppression. The thick clouds of tyranny have darkened the face  of the earth, and enveloped its peoples. Through the movement of Our Pen  of glory We have, at the bidding of the omnipotent Ordainer, breathed a  new life into every human frame, and instilled into every word a fresh  potency. All created things proclaim the evidences of this world-wide  regeneration. This is the most great, the most joyful tidings imparted by  the Pen of this wronged One to mankind. Wherefore fear ye, O My  well-beloved ones? Who is it that can dismay you? A touch of moisture  sufficeth to dissolve the hardened clay out of which this perverse  generation is molded. The mere act of your gathering together is enough to  scatter the forces of these vain and worthless people....    Every man of insight will, in this day, readily admit that the counsels  which the Pen of this wronged One hath revealed constitute the supreme  animating power for the advancement of the world and the exaltation of its  peoples. Arise, O people, and, by the power of God's might, resolve to  gain the victory over your own selves, that haply the whole earth may be  freed and sanctified from its servitude to the gods of its idle  fancies--gods that have inflicted such loss upon, and are responsible for  the misery of, their wretched worshipers. These idols form the obstacle  that impedeth man in his efforts to advance in the path of perfection. We  cherish the hope that the Hand of Divine power may lend its assistance to  mankind, and deliver it from its state of grievous abasement.    In one of the Tablets these words have been revealed: O people of God! Do  not busy yourselves in your own concerns; let your thoughts be fixed upon  that which will rehabilitate the fortunes of mankind and sanctify the  hearts and souls of men. This can best be achieved through pure and holy  deeds, through a virtuous life and a goodly behavior. Valiant acts will  ensure the triumph of this Cause, and a saintly character will reinforce  its power. Cleave unto righteousness, O people of Baha! This, verily, is  the commandment which this wronged One hath given unto you, and the first  choice of His unrestrained Will for every one of you.    O friends! It behoveth you to refresh and revive your souls through the  gracious favors which in this Divine, this soul-stirring Springtime are  being showered upon you. The Day Star of His great glory hath shed its  radiance upon you, and the clouds of His limitless grace have overshadowed  you. How high the reward of him that hath not deprived himself of so great  a bounty, nor failed to recognize the beauty of his Best-Beloved in this,  His new attire. Watch over yourselves, for the Evil One is lying in wait,  ready to entrap you. Gird yourselves against his wicked devices, and, led  by the light of the name of the All-Seeing God, make your escape from the  darkness that surroundeth you. Let your vision be world-embracing, rather  than confined to your own self. The Evil One is he that hindereth the rise  and obstructeth the spiritual progress of the children of men.    It is incumbent upon every man, in this Day, to hold fast unto whatsoever  will promote the interests, and exalt the station, of all nations and just  governments. Through each and every one of the verses which the Pen of the  Most High hath revealed, the doors of love and unity have been unlocked  and flung open to the face of men. We have erewhile declared--and Our Word  is the truth--: \"Consort with the followers of all religions in a spirit of  friendliness and fellowship.\" Whatsoever hath led the children of men to  shun one another, and hath caused dissensions and divisions amongst them,  hath, through the revelation of these words, been nullified and abolished.  From the heaven of God's Will, and for the purpose of ennobling the world  of being and of elevating the minds and souls of men, hath been sent down  that which is the most effective instrument for the education of the whole  human race. The highest essence and most perfect expression of whatsoever  the peoples of old have either said or written hath, through this most  potent Revelation, been sent down from the heaven of the Will of the  All-Possessing, the Ever-Abiding God. Of old it hath been revealed: \"Love  of one's country is an element of the Faith of God.\" The Tongue of  Grandeur hath, however, in the day of His manifestation proclaimed: \"It is  not his to boast who loveth his country, but it is his who loveth the  world.\" Through the power released by these exalted words He hath lent a  fresh impulse, and set a new direction, to the birds of men's hearts, and  hath obliterated every trace of restriction and limitation from God's holy  Book.    O people of Justice! Be as brilliant as the light, and as splendid as the  fire that blazed in the Burning Bush. The brightness of the fire of your  love will no doubt fuse and unify the contending peoples and kindreds of  the earth, whilst the fierceness of the flame of enmity and hatred cannot  but result in strife and ruin. We beseech God that He may shield His  creatures from the evil designs of His enemies. He verily hath power over  all things.    All praise be to the one true God--exalted be His glory--inasmuch as He  hath, through the Pen of the Most High, unlocked the doors of men's  hearts. Every verse which this Pen hath revealed is a bright and shining  portal that discloseth the glories of a saintly and pious life, of pure  and stainless deeds. The summons and the message which We gave were never  intended to reach or to benefit one land or one people only. Mankind in  its entirety must firmly adhere to whatsoever hath been revealed and  vouchsafed unto it. Then and only then will it attain unto true liberty.  The whole earth is illuminated with the resplendent glory of God's  Revelation. In the year sixty He Who heralded the light of Divine  Guidance--may all creation be a sacrifice unto Him--arose to announce a  fresh revelation of the Divine Spirit, and was followed, twenty years  later, by Him through Whose coming the world was made the recipient of  this promised glory, this wondrous favor. Behold how the generality of  mankind hath been endued with the capacity to hearken unto God's most  exalted Word--the Word upon which must depend the gathering together and  spiritual resurrection of all men....    Incline your hearts, O people of God, unto the counsels of your true, your  incomparable Friend. The Word of God may be likened unto a sapling, whose  roots have been implanted in the hearts of men. It is incumbent upon you  to foster its growth through the living waters of wisdom, of sanctified  and holy words, so that its root may become firmly fixed and its branches  may spread out as high as the heavens and beyond.    O ye that dwell on earth! The distinguishing feature that marketh the  preeminent character of this Supreme Revelation consisteth in that We  have, on the one hand, blotted out from the pages of God's holy Book  whatsoever hath been the cause of strife, of malice and mischief amongst  the children of men, and have, on the other, laid down the essential  prerequisites of concord, of understanding, of complete and enduring  unity. Well is it with them that keep My statutes.    Time and again have We admonished Our beloved ones to avoid, nay to flee  from, anything whatsoever from which the odor of mischief can be detected.  The world is in great turmoil, and the minds of its people are in a state  of utter confusion. We entreat the Almighty that He may graciously  illuminate them with the glory of His Justice, and enable them to discover  that which will be profitable unto them at all times and under all  conditions. He, verily is the All-Possessing, the Most High.            XLIV: LAY NOT ASIDE THE FEAR OF GOD, O YE THE...      Lay not aside the fear of God, O ye the learned of the world, and judge  fairly the Cause of this unlettered One to Whom all the Books of God, the  Protector, the Self-Subsisting, have testified. ...Will not the dread of  Divine displeasure, the fear of Him Who hath no peer or equal, arouse you?  He Whom the world hath wronged hath, at no time, associated with you, hath  never studied your writings, nor participated in any of your disputations.  The garb He weareth, His flowing locks, His headdress, attest the truth of  His words. How long will ye persist in your injustice? Witness the  habitation in which He, Who is the incarnation of justice, hath been  forced to dwell. Open your eyes, and, beholding His plight, meditate  diligently upon that which your hands have wrought, that haply ye may not  be deprived of the light of His Divine utterance, nor remain bereft of  your share of the ocean of His knowledge.    Certain ones among both commoners and nobles have objected that this  wronged One is neither a member of the ecclesiastical order nor a  descendant of the Prophet. Say: O ye that claim to be just! Reflect a  little while, and ye shall recognize how infinitely exalted is His present  state above the station ye claim He should possess. The Will of the  Almighty hath decreed that out of a house wholly devoid of all that the  divines, the doctors, the sages, and scholars commonly possess His Cause  should proceed and be made manifest.    The Breathings of the Divine Spirit awoke Him, and bade Him arise and  proclaim His Revelation. No sooner was He roused from His slumber than He  lifted up His voice and summoned the whole of mankind unto God, the Lord  of all worlds. We have been moved to reveal"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16949"],[0,"Flowers from a Persian Garden and Other Papers (#15)"],[1,", but when  assured that such was the case, he said: \"I no longer doubt your  earnestness and sincerity in this affair; it is, however, just possible  that your feelings may change after the marriage, and it is but natural  that I should now take proper precautions for my daughter's welfare. You  will not blame me, therefore, if, in addition to the fifteen purses you  have offered, I require that five more be paid down previous to the  marriage, to be forfeited in case of a divorce.\" \"Say ten,\" cried the  merchant, and the kazi looked more and more astonished, and even  ventured to remonstrate with him on his precipitancy, but without  effect. To be brief, the kazi consented, the ten purses were paid down,  the legal witnesses summoned, and the nuptial contract signed that very  evening; the consummation of the marriage being, much against the will  of our lover, deferred till the following day.    When the wedding guests had dispersed, the young merchant was admitted  to the chamber of his bride, whom he discovered to be humpbacked and  hideous beyond conception! As soon as it was day, he arose from his  sleepless couch and repaired to the public baths, where, after his  ablutions, he gave himself up to melancholy reflections. Mingled with  grief for his disappointment was mortification at having been the dupe  of what now appeared to him a very shallow artifice, which nothing but  his own passionate and unthinking precipitation could have rendered  plausible. Nor was he without some twinges of conscience for the  sarcasms which he had often uttered against women, and for which his  present sufferings were no more than a just retribution. Then came  meditations of revenge upon the beautiful author of all this mischief;  and then his thoughts reverted to the possible means of escape from his  difficulties: the forfeiture of the ten purses, to say nothing of the  implacable resentment of the kazi and his relatives; and he bethought  himself how he should become the talk of his neighbourhood--how Malik  bin Omar, the jeweller, would sneer at him, and Salih, the barber, talk  sententiously of his folly. At length, finding reflection of no avail,  he arose and with slow and pensive steps proceeded to his shop.    His marriage with the kazi's deformed daughter had already become known  to his neighbours, who presently came to rally him upon his choice of  such a bride, and scarcely had they left when the young lady who had so  artfully tricked him entered with a playful smile on her lips, and a  glancing in her dark eye, which speedily put to flight the young  merchant's thoughts of revenge. He arose and greeted her courteously.  \"May this day be propitious to thee!\" said she. \"May Allah protect and  bless thee!\" Replied he: \"Fairest of earthly creatures, how have I  offended thee that thou shouldst make me the subject of thy sport?\"  \"From thee,\" she said, \"I have received no personal injury.\" \"What,  then, can have been thy motive for practising so cruel a deception on  one who has never harmed thee?\" The young lady simply pointed to the  inscription over the shop front. The merchant was abashed, but felt  somewhat relieved on seeing good humour beaming from her beautiful eyes,  and he immediately took down the inscription, and substituted another,  which declared that \"TRULY THERE IS NO CUNNING LIKE UNTO THE CUNNING OF  WOMEN, SEEING IT SURPASSES AND CONFOUNDS EVEN THE CUNNING OF MEN.\" Then  the young lady communicated to him a plan by which he might get rid of  his objectionable bride without incurring her father's resentment, which  he forthwith put into practice.    Next morning, as the kazi and his son-in-law were taking their coffee  together, in the house of the former, they heard a strange noise in the  street, and, descending to ascertain the cause of the disturbance, found  that it proceeded from a crowd of low fellows--mountebanks, and such  like gentry, who had assembled with all sorts of musical instruments,  with which they kept up a deafening din, at the same time dancing and  capering about, and loudly felicitating themselves on the marriage of  their pretended kinsman with the kazi's daughter. The young merchant  acknowledged their compliments by throwing handfuls of money among the  crowd, which caused a renewal of the dreadful clamour. When the noise  had somewhat subsided, the kazi, hitherto dumb from astonishment, turned  to his son-in-law, and demanded to know the meaning of such a scene  before his mansion. The merchant replied that the leaders of the crowd  were his kinsfolk, although his father had abandoned the fraternity and  adopted commercial pursuits. He could not, however, disown his kindred,  even for the sake of the kazi's daughter. On hearing this the judge was  beside himself with rage and mortification, exclaiming: \"Dog, and son of  a dog! what dirt is this you have made me eat?\" The merchant reminded  him that he was now his son-in-law; that his daughter was his lawful  wife; declaring that he would not part with her for untold wealth. But  the kazi insisted upon a divorce and returned the merchant his ten  purses. In the sequel, the young merchant, having ascertained the  parentage of the clever damsel, obtained her in marriage, and lived with  her for many years in happiness and prosperity.[33]       [33] This story has been taken from Arab Shah into the          Breslau printed Arabic text of the _Thousand and One          Nights_, where it is related at great length. The          original was rendered into French under the title of          \"Ruses des Femmes\" (in the Arabic _Ked-an-Nisa_,          Stratagems of Women) by Lescallier, and appended to his          version of the Voyages of Sindbad, published at Paris in          1814, long before the Breslau text of _The Nights_ was          known to exist. It also forms part of one of the Persian          Tales (_Hazar u Yek Ruz_, 1001 Days) translated by Petis          de la Croix, where, however, the trick is played on the          kazi, not on a young merchant.          IV    ASHAAB THE COVETOUS--THE STINGY MERCHANT AND THE HUNGRY BEDOUIN--THE  SECT OF SAMRADIANS--THE STORY-TELLER AND THE KING--ROYAL GIFTS TO  POETS--THE PERSIAN POET AND THE IMPOSTOR--\"STEALING POETRY\"--THE RICH  MAN AND THE POOR POET.      Avaricious and covetous men are always the just objects of derision as  well as contempt, and surely covetousness was quite concentrated in the  person of Ashaab, a servant of Othman (seventh century), and a native of  Medina, whose character has been very amusingly drawn by the scholiast:  He never saw a man put his hand into his pocket without hoping and  expecting that he would give him something. He never saw a funeral go  by, but he was pleased, hoping that the deceased had left him something.  He never saw a bride about to be conducted through the streets to the  house of the bridegroom but he prepared his own house for her reception,  hoping that her friends would bring her to his house by mistake. If he  saw a workman making a box, he took care to tell him that he was putting  in one or two boards too many, hoping that he would give him what was  over, or, at least, something for the suggestion. He is said to have  followed a man who was chewing mastic (a sort of gum, chewed, like  betel, by Orientals as a pastime) for a whole mile, thinking he was  perhaps eating food, intending, if so, to ask him for some. When the  youths of the town jeered and taunted him, he told them there was a  wedding at such a house, in order to get rid of them (because they would  go to get a share of the bonbons distributed there); but, as soon as  they were gone, it struck him that possibly what he had told them was  true, and that they would not have quitted him had they not been aware  of its truth; and he actually followed them himself to see what he could  do, though exposing himself thereby to fresh taunts from them. When  asked whether he knew anyone more covetous than himself, he said: \"Yes;  a sheep I once had, that climbed to an upper stage of my house, and,  seeing a rainbow, mistook it for a rope of hay, and jumping at it, broke  her neck\"--whence \"Ashaab's sheep\" became proverbial among the Arabs for  covetousness as well as Ashaab himself.           *       *       *       *       *    Hospitality has ever been the characteristic virtue of the Arabs, and a  mean, stingy disposition is rarely to be found among them. A droll story  of an Arab of the latter description has been rendered into verse by the  Persian poet Liwa'i, the substance of which is as follows: An Arab  merchant who had been trading between Mecca and Damascus, at length  turned his face homeward, and had reached within one stage of his house  when he sat down to rest and to refresh himself with the contents of his  wallet. While he was eating, a Bedouin, weary and hungry, came up, and,  hoping to be invited to share his repast, saluted him, \"Peace be with  thee!\" which the merchant returned, and asked the nomad who he was and  whence he came. \"I have come from thy house,\" was the answer. \"Then,\"  said the merchant, \"how fares my son Ahmed, absence from whom has  grieved me sore?\" \"Thy son grows apace in health and innocence.\" \"Good!  and how is his mother?\" \"She, too, is free from the shadow of sorrow.\"  \"And how is my beauteous camel, so strong to bear his load?\" \"Thy camel  is sleek and fat.\" \"My house-dog, too, that guards my gate, pray how is  he?\" \"He is on the mat before thy door, by day, by night, on constant  guard.\" The merchant, having thus his doubts and fears removed, resumed  his meal with freshened appetite, but gave nought to the poor nomad,  and, having finished, closed his wallet. The Bedouin, seeing his  stinginess, writhed with the pangs of hunger. Presently a gazelle passed  rapidly by them, at which he sighed heavily, and the merchant inquiring  the cause of his sorrow, he said: \"The cause is this--had not thy dog  died he would"]]]
