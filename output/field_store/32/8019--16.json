(_She suddenly covers her face with her hands and commences to  sob._)    KEENEY (_disturbed_). Go in and rest, Annie. You're all wore out  cryin' over what can't be helped.    MRS. KEENEY (_suddenly throwing her arms around his neck and  clinging to him_). You love me, don't you, David?    KEENEY (_in amazed embarrassment at this outburst_) Love you? Why  d'you ask me such a question, Annie?    MRS. KEENEY (_shaking him--fiercely_). But you do, don't you,  David? Tell me!    KEENEY. I'm your husband, Annie, and you're my wife. Could there  be aught but love between us after all these years?    MRS. KEENEY (_shaking him again--still more fiercely_). Then you do  love me. Say it!    KEENEY (_simply_). I do, Annie.    MRS. KEENEY. (_Gives a sigh of relief--her hands drop to her  sides._ KEENEY _regards her anxiously. She passes her hand across  her eyes and murmurs half to herself._) I sometimes think if we  could only have had a child. (KEENEY _turns away from her, deeply  moved. She grabs his arm and turns him around to face  her--intensely._) And I've always been a good wife to you,  haven't I, David?    KEENEY (_his voice betraying his emotion_). No man ever had a  better, Annie.    MRS. KEENEY. And I've never asked for much from you, have I,  David? Have I?    KEENEY. You know you could have all I got the power to give ye,  Annie.    MRS. KEENEY (_wildly_). Then do this, this once, for my sake, for  God's sake--take me home! It's killing me, this life--the  brutality and cold and horror of it. I'm going mad. I can feel  the threat in the air. I can hear the silence threatening me--day  after gray day and every day the same. I can't bear it.  (_Sobbing._) I'll go mad, I know I will. Take me home, David, if  you love me as you say. I'm afraid. For the love of God, take me  home!    (_She throws her arms around him, weeping against his shoulder.  His face betrays the tremendous struggle going on within him. He  holds her out at arm's length, his expression softening. For a  moment his shoulders sag, he becomes old, his iron spirit weakens  as he looks at her tear-stained face._)    KEENEY (_dragging out the words with an effort_). I'll do it,  Annie--for your sake--if you say it's needful for ye.    MRS. KEENEY (_with wild joy--kissing him_). God bless you for that,  David!    (_He turns away from her silently and walks toward the  companionway. Just at that moment there is a clatter of footsteps  on the stairs and the_ SECOND MATE _enters the cabin._)    MATE (_excitedly_). The ice is breakin' up to no'th'rd, sir.  There's a clear passage through the floe, and clear water beyond,  the lookout says.    (KEENEY _straightens himself like a man coming out of a trance._  MRS. KEENEY _looks at the_ MATE _with terrified eyes._)    KEENEY (_dazedly--trying to collect his thoughts_). A clear  passage? To no'th'rd?    MATE. Yes, sir.    KEENEY (_his voice suddenly grim with determination_). Then get her  ready and we'll drive her through.    MATE. Aye, aye, sir.    MRS. KEENEY (_appealingly_). David!    KEENEY (_not heeding her_). Will the men turn to willin' or must we  drag 'em out?    MATE. They 'll turn to willin' enough. You put the fear o' God  into 'em, sir. They're meek as lambs.    KEENEY. Then drive 'em--both watches. (_With grim determination_)  They's whale t' other side o' this floe and we're going to git  'em.    MATE. Aye, aye, sir.    (_He goes out hurriedly. A moment later there is the sound of  scuffing feet from the deck outside and the_ MATE'S _voice shouting  orders._)    KEENEY (_speaking aloud to himself--derisively_). And I was a-goin'  home like a yaller dog!    MRS. KEENEY (_imploringly_). David!    KEENEY (_sternly_). Woman, you ain't a-doin' right when you meddle  in men's business and weaken 'em. You can't know my feelin's. I  got to prove a man to be a good husband for ye to take pride in.  I got to git the ile, I tell ye.    MRS. KEENEY (_supplicatingly_). David! Aren't you going home?    KEENEY (_ignoring this question--commandingly_). You ain't well. Go  and lay down a mite. (_He starts for the door._) I got to git on  deck.    (_He goes out. She cries after him in anguish, \"David!\" A pause.  She passes her hand across her eyes--then commences to laugh  hysterically and goes to the organ. She sits down and starts to  play wildly an old hymn._ KEENEY _reenters from the doorway to the  deck and stands looking at her angrily. He comes over and grabs  her roughly by the shoulder._)    KEENEY. Woman, what foolish mockin' is this? (_She laughs wildly,  and he starts back from her in alarm._) Annie! What is it? (_She  doesn't answer him._ KEENEY'S _voice trembles._) Don't you know me,  Annie?    (_He puts both hands on her shoulders and turns her around so that  he can look into her eyes. She stares up at him with a stupid  expression, a vague smile on her lips. He stumbles away from her,  and she commences softly to play the organ again._)    KEENEY (_swallowing hard--in a hoarse whisper, as if he had  difficulty in speaking_). You said--you was agoin' mad--God!    (_A long wail is heard from the deck above: \"Ah bl-o-o-o-ow!\" A  moment later the_ MATE'S _face appears through the skylight. He  cannot see_ MRS. KEENEY.)    MATE (_in great excitement_). Whales, sir--a whole school of  'em--off the starb'd quarter 'bout five mile away--big ones!    KEENEY (_galvanized into action_). Are you lowerin' the boats?    MATE. Yes, sir.    KEENEY (_with grim decision_). I'm a-comin' with ye.    MATE. Aye, aye, sir. (_Jubilantly_) You'll git the ile now right  enough, sir.    (_His head is withdrawn and he can be heard shouting orders._)    KEENEY (_turning to his wife_). Annie! Did you hear him? I'll git  the ile. (_She doesn't answer or seem to know he is there. He  gives a hard laugh, which is almost a groan._) I know you're  foolin' me, Annie. You ain't out of your mind--(_anxiously_) be  you? I'll git the ile now right enough--jest a little while  longer, Annie--then we'll turn hom'ard. I can't turn back now,  you see that, don't ye? I've got to git the ile. (_In sudden  terror_) Answer me! You ain't mad, be you?    (_She keeps on playing the organ, but makes no reply. The_ MATE'S  _face appears again through the skylight._)    MATE. All ready, sir.    (KEENEY _turns his back on his wife and strides to the doorway,  where he stands for a moment and looks back at her in anguish,  fighting to control his feelings._)    MATE. Comin', sir?    KEENEY (_his face suddenly grown hard with determination_). Aye.    (_He turns abruptly and goes out._ MRS. KEENEY _does not appear to  notice his departure. Her whole attention seems centred in the  organ. She sits with half-closed eyes, her body swaying a little  from side to side to the rhythm of the hymn. Her fingers move  faster and faster and she is playing wildly and discordantly as  the Curtain falls._)          CAMPBELL OF KILMHOR[1]    J.A.

The old woman  is seated on a low stool beside the peat fire in the centre of  the floor._    _The room is scantily furnished and the women are poorly clad.  MORAG is barefooted. At the back is the door that leads to the  outside. On the left of the door is a small window. On the right  side of the room there is a door that opens into a barn. MORAG  stands for a moment at the window, looking out._      MORAG. It is the wild night outside.    MARY STEWART. Is the snow still coming down?    MORAG. It is that, then--dancing and swirling with the wind too,  and never stopping at all. Aye, and so black I cannot see the  other side of the road.    MARY STEWART. That is good.    (MORAG _moves across the floor and stops irresolutely. She is  restless, expectant._)    MORAG. Will I be putting the light in the window?    MARY STEWART. Why should you be doing that? You have not heard  his call (_turns eagerly_), have you?    MORAG (_with sign of head_). No, but the light in the window would  show him all is well.    MARY STEWART. It would not, then! The light was to be put there  _after_ we had heard the signal.    MORAG. But on a night like this he may have been calling for long  and we never hear him.    MARY STEWART. Do not be so anxious, Morag. Keep to what he says.  Put more peat on the fire now and sit down.    MORAG (_with increasing excitement_). I canna, I canna! There is  that in me that tells me something is going to befall us this  night. Oh, that wind! Hear to it, sobbing round the house as if  it brought some poor lost soul up to the door, and we refusing it  shelter.    MARY STEWART. Do not be fretting yourself like that. Do as I bid  you. Put more peats to the fire.    MORAG (_at the wicker peat-basket_). Never since I.... What was  that?    (_Both listen for a moment._)    MARY STEWART. It was just the wind; it is rising more. A sore  night for them that are out in the heather.    (MORAG _puts peat on the fire without speaking._)    MARY STEWART. Did you notice were there many people going by  to-day?    MORAG. No. After daybreak the redcoats came by from Struan; and  there was no more till nine, when an old man like the Catechist  from Killichonan passed. At four o'clock, just when the dark was  falling, a horseman with a lad holding to the stirrup, and  running fast, went by towards Rannoch.    MARY STEWART. But no more redcoats?    MORAG (_shaking her head_). The road has been as quiet as the  hills, and they as quiet as the grave. Do you think will he come?    MARY STEWART. Is it you think I have the gift, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16441"],[0,"The Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby Knight Opened (#15)"],[1,"the  herbs, scuming also the water clear. Then lade out the water, (letting it  run through a Ranch-Sieve) into a wide open vessel, or large Vat to cool,  leaving the settlement and dregs. (He often leaves out the Eye-bright and  Thyme, when he provideth chiefly for the pure tast; though the Eye-bright  hurts it but little.) When it is blood-warm, put the honey to it, about one  part, to four of water; but because this doth not determine the proportions  exactly (for some honey will make it stronger then other) you must do that  by bearing up an Egge. But first, lave and scoop your mixture exceedingly,  (at least an hour) that the honey be not onely perfectly dissolved, but  uniformly mixed throughout the water. Then take out some of it in a great  Woodden bowl or pail, and put a good number, (ten or twelve) New-laid-eggs  into it, and as round ones as may be; For long ones will deceive you in the  swiming; and stale ones, being lighter then new, will emerge out of the  Liquor, the breadth of a sixpence, when new ones will not a groats-breadth.  Therefore you take many, that you make a medium of their several emergings;  unless you be certain, that they which you use, are immediately then laid  and very round. The rule is, that a Groats-breadth (or rather but a  threepence) of the Egg-shel must Swim above the Liquor; which then put  again into your Copper to boil. It will be some while, before it boil,  (peradventure a goodquarter of an hour) but all that while scum will rise,  which skim away still as it riseth; and it should be clear scummed by then  it boileth: which as soon as it doth, turn up an hour Glass, and let it  boil well a good hour. A good quarter before the hour is out, put to it a  pound of White-Ginger beaten exceedingly small and searsed (which will  sever all the skins and course parts from the fine) which having boiled a  quarter of an hour, so to make up the whole hour of boiling, pour out the  Liquor into wide open Vats to cool. When it is quite cold, put a pottle of  New-ale-barm into a Pipe or Butt, standing endwise with his head out, and  pour upon it a Pail-full of your cool Liquor out of one of the Vats; which  falling from high upon it with force, will break and dissipate the barm  into atoms, and mix it with the Liquor. Pour immediately another pail-ful  to that, continuing to do so, till all the Liquor be in. Which by this time  and this course will be uniformly mixed with the barm, and begin to work.  Yet scoop and lade it well a while, to make the mixtion more perfect, and  set the working well on foot. Then cover your But-head with a sheet onely  in Summer, but blankets in Winter; and let your Liquor work about 24 hours  or more. The measure of that is, till the barm (which is raised to a great  head) beginneth a little to fall. Then presently scum of the thick head of  the barm, but take not all away so scrupulously, but that there may remain  a little white froth upon the face of the Liquor. Which scoop and lade  strongly, mingling all to the bottom, that this little remaining barm may  by this agitation be mixed a new with the whole. Then immediately Tun this  Liquor into two hogsheads that have served for Spanish-wine (be sure to  fill them quite full) and there let it work two or three days; that is to  say, till you see that all the feculent substance is wrought out, and that  what runneth out, beginneth to be clear, though a little whitish or frothy  on the upperside of the stream that runs down along the outside of the  hogshead. (If there should be a little more then to fill two hogsheads, put  it in a Rundlet by it self.) Then take some very strong firm Paper, and wet  it on one side with some of the barm that works out, and lay that side over  the bung to cover it close. The barm will make it stick fast to the  hogshead. This covering will serve for a moneth or two. Then stop it close  with strong Cork fitted to the hole, with a linnen about it, to press it  fast in: But let a little vent with a peg in it be made in hogshead, in  some fit place above. This may be fit to broach in five or six moneths; but  three weeks or a moneth before you do so, put into each hogshead half an  ounce of Cinnamon; and two ounces of Cloves beaten into most subtile  powder. (Sometimes he leaves out the Cloves) which will give it a most  pleasant flavor; and they (as the Ginger did) sink down to the bottome and  never trouble the Liquor. If they be put in long before (much more if they  be boiled) they loose all their taste and Spirits entirely. This will last  very well half a year drawing. But if you stay broaching it a year, and  then draw it into bottles, it will keep admirable good three or four years,  growing to be much better, then when broached at six months end. It will be  purer, if you first boil the water by it self, then let it settle 24 hours;  and pour the clear from the earthy sediment, which will be great, and  dissolve your honey in that. You may Aromatise it with Ambergreece or Musk,  or both (if you like them) by dissolving a very few Pastils in a Runlet of  this Liquor, when you draw it into little vessels, (as He useth to do after  five or six moneths) or with a few drops of the Extract of them. This  Metheglin is a great Balsom and strengthener of the _Viscera_; is excellent  in colds and coughs and consumptions. For which last they use to burn it  (like wine) or rather onely heat it. Then dissolve the yolk of an Egge or  two in a Pint of it, and some fresh Butter, and drink it warm in the  morning fasting. As it comes from the Barrel or Bottle, it is used to be  drunk a large draught (without any alteration or admixtion, with a toste  early in the morning (eating the toste) when they intend to dine late.  Consider of making Metheglin thus with purified rain water (of the  _AEquinoxe_) or Dew.    The handfuls of Herbs, are natural large handfuls (as much as you can take  up in your hand) not Apothecaries handfuls, which are much less. If a  pottle of Barm do not make it work enough to your mind, you may put in a  little more. Discretion and Experience must regulate that.    You may make small Meathe the same way, putting but half the proportion of  honey or less. But then after three weeks or a months barrelling, you must  bottle it.      AN EXCELLENT WAY TO MAKE METHEGLIN, CALLED THE LIQUOR OF LIFE, WITH THESE  FOLLOWING INGREDIENTS    Take Bugloss, Borage, Hyssop, Organ, Sweet-marjoram, Rosemary,  French-cowslip, Coltsfoot, Thyme, Burnet, Self-heal, Sanicle a little,  Betony, Blew-buttons, Harts-tongue, Meadssweet, Liverwort, Coriander two  ounces, Bistort, Saint John's wort, Liquorish, Two ounces of Carraways, Two  ounces of Yellow-saunders, Balm, Bugle, Half a pound of Ginger, and one  ounce of Cloves, Agrimony, Tormentil-roots, Cumfrey, Fennel-root's,  Clowns-all-heal, Maiden-hair, Wall-rew, Spleen-wort, Sweet-oak,  Pauls-betony, Mouse ear.    For two Hogsheads of Metheglin, you take two handfuls a piece of each herb,  Excepting Sanicle; of which you take but half a handful. You make it in all  things as the white Meathe of Mr. Pierce's is made, excepting as followeth.  For in that you boil the herbs but a quarter of an hour, that the colour  may be pale: But in this, where the deepness of the colour is not regarded,  you boil them a good hour, that you may get all the vertue out of them.  Next for the strength of it; whereas in that, an Egge is to emerge out of  the Liquor but the breadth of a three pence; in This it is to emerge a  large Groats-breadth. Then in this you take but half a pound of Ginger,  and one ounce of Cloves. Whereas the white hath one pound of Ginger, and  two ounces of Cloves. To this you use three quarts, or rather more of  Ale-yest (fresh and new) and when all your Liquor is in a high slender tall  pipe with the narrowest circumference that may be (which makes it work  better then a broad one, where the Spirits loose themselves) you have the  yest in a large Noggin with a handle, or pail, and put some of the Liquor  to it, and make that work; then pour it from pretty high unto the whole  quantity in the pipe, and lade it strongly with that Noggin five or six, or  eight times, pouring it every time from high, and working it well together,  that so every Atome of the yest maybe mingled with every Atome of the  Liquor. And this course (in this particular) you may also use in the white.  It is best not to broach this, till a year be over after the making it.      TO MAKE GOOD METHEGLIN    Take to every Gallon of Honey, three Gallons of water, and put them both  together, and set them over so soft a fire, that you may endure to melt and  break the honey with your hands. When the honey is all melted, put in an  Egge, and let it fall gently to the bottome, and if the Egge rise up to the  top again of the Liquor, then is it strong enough of the honey; but if it  lie at the bottome, you must put in more honey, stirring of it till it do  rise. If your honey be very good, it will bear half a Gallon of water more  to a Gallon of Honey. Then take Sweet-bryar, Rose-mary, Bayes, Thyme,  Marjoram, Savory, of each a good handful, which must be tyed up all  together in a bundle. This Proportion of herbs will be sufficient for 12  Gallons of Metheglin; and according to the quantity you make of Metheglin,  you must add of your herbs or take away. When you have put these things  together set it upon a quick fire, and let it boil as fast as you can for  half an hour, or better, skiming of it very clean, which you must Clarifie  with two or three whites of Eggs. Then take it off from the fire, and put  it presently into some clean covers, and let it stand till the next  morning; then pour the clear from the bottom and tun it up; putting in a  little bag of such spice as you like, whereof Ginger must be the most.  After it hath stood some three or four days, you may put in some two or  three spoonfuls of good-ale-yest; it will make it ready the sooner to "]]]
