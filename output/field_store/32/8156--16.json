Her offer to serve was accepted and she remained at the  World Centre of the Baha'i Faith in Israel for the next eleven years where  she assumed the duties of hostess, welcoming the friends to the Pilgrim  House, using her artistry and talent to photograph events in Haifa for the  Guardian. In 1930, when the need arose to secure photographs of places in  Persia associated with the early history of the Baha'i Faith, Effie  undertook arduous journeys by road through Syria and Iraq, undeterred by  danger from hostile bandits. This intrepid worker now embarked on an  exacting and fruitful period of direct service to the Guardian, often  using cars supplied by the Persian believers, at times travelling on  horseback, mule or donkey to all but a few sites where it was too  dangerous for a westerner to venture. The unique photographic record she  obtained was immortalised by being selected by the Guardian for inclusion  in Nabil's \"The Dawnbreakers\".    In 1936, Effie returned to her homeland, Australia, where she looked after  the National Archives over a long period. Her last years were spent in a  small flat in the Haziratu'l-Quds in Sydney at the invitation of the  National Spiritual Assembly of Australia and New Zealand who had been  requested by the Guardian to take care of her until her passing on January  2nd, 1968.          Note 5. (Letter No. 15)      Mrs Amy Dewing and her son Bertram were among New Zealand's earliest  Baha'is; Mrs Dewing came from an orthodox Church of England background and  viewed with disapproval her son's questioning attitude which led him to  describe himself as a Rationalist. They heard of and accepted the Truth of  the Baha'i Cause after meeting with \"Mother\" and \"Father\" Dunn in  Devonport, Auckland and, in 1926, both of them served as members of the  first Local Spiritual Assembly in Auckland. Amy Dewing, as one of a small  and persevering group of New Zealand believers, was active in spreading  the Message as was her son through whose efforts a Baha'i magazine was  published in Australia and New Zealand to promote the teachings. Prior to  her passing in 1957, Amy Dewing witnessed the emergence of the New Zealand  community as an independent entity.    Having travelled extensively overseas, Bertram Dewing eventually settled  in Auckland. A tireless worker for the Faith, he was a member of the first  Local Spiritual Assembly in Devonport in 1951 and in 1958 was elected to  the second National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of New Zealand. He  pioneered to Hokianga in the same year and a decade later assisted in  spreading the Faith to New Plymouth where he worked for the Cause with  unabated zeal until he passed to the Abha Kingdom in 1972 at the age of  seventy.          Note 6. (Letter No. 16)      Dr Habib, whose older brother attained martyrdom, was born in 1888 at  Kerman_sh_ah, Persia and was given the name Mu'ayyad (meaning 'confirmed')  by 'Abdu'l-Baha. At the age of twenty-one, when en route to Beirut to  begin his medical studies at the American University, he spent a month in  the Holy Land with 'Abdu'l-Baha who took a personal interest in his  progress. Thereafter he returned each summer to serve the Cause, extending  hospitality to visitors and pilgrims, recording daily events, acquiring  spiritual knowledge from outstanding Baha'i scholars and being entrusted  with the receipt and dispatch of Tablets. Referring to Habib's student  days, 'Abdu'l-Baha extolled the young man's influence, detachment and  sanctity, saying \"the fragrance of Beirut\" perfumed His nostrils.    After graduating from the University of Beirut in 1914, Dr Habib operated  a dispensary at Abu-Sinan, a Druse village northeast of Akka where the  Master had temporarily settled the Baha'is: this period of close contact  with the Holy Family and daily lessons from 'Abdu'l-Baha he was later to  describe as the \"most precious segment of his life\". In a Tablet to Dr  Habib's father, 'Abdu'l-Baha described this dedicated young Baha'i as \"A  lamp enkindled with the love of God\".    In 1915, responding to the Master's specific instructions, Dr Habib  returned to his birthplace to practice his profession and teach the Faith  to which he was so deeply devoted, and was for forty years a member of the  Local Spiritual Assembly of Kerman_sh_ah, also serving for a period on the  National Spiritual Assembly. His published works include two volumes of  reminiscences based on the principles of the Covenant and the history of  the Cause, whilst his much loved poem entitled \"Hold Thou my Hand, O  'Abdu'l-Baha\" is widely sung at gatherings of the Baha'is in Iran. Dr  Habib Mu'ayyad passed to the Abha Kingdom on October 29th, 1971.          Note 7. (Letter No. 16)      The Moslem calendar dates from Muhammad's emigration or Hijrah from Mecca  to Medina in 622 A.D. The Moslem year begins with the month of Muharram of  which the first ten days are observed by _Sh_i'ah Moslems as part of their  mourning period for the Imams. The tenth day is called A_sh_ura and  commemorates the martyrdom of Husayn, the grand-son of Muhammad, who was  cut down by thirty-three strokes of swords and lances and decapitated: his  clothes were torn from him and his naked body trampled by horses hooves.          Note 8. (Letter No. 23)      Mrs Emily Axford was born in Huddersfield, England on October 19th, 1870  and was an infant teacher before her marriage. In 1907, the family  emigrated to New Zealand where her husband practiced medicine in Te Aroha  until his passing in 1912, after which Mrs Axford moved to Auckland so as  to educate her three children. Having rejected conventional Christianity,  she was attracted by the New England Transcendental Movement until she  became aware of the Baha'i Faith through her friendship with Sarah  Blundell and was enrolled as a member in 1923. Three years later, Mrs  Axford was elected Chairman of the first Local Spiritual Assembly in  Auckland and for many years conducted classes in public speaking to help  the friends overcome their shyness and reticence so that they might teach  the Faith effectively. Emily was one of three New Zealand delegates who  attended the National Convention held in Sydney during 1934 and the  following year was elected to the National Spiritual Assembly of the  Baha'is of Australia and New Zealand. She continued to work staunchly for  the Faith, being appointed in 1946 to the Regional Teaching Committee  responsible for formulating teaching plans throughout New Zealand. The  following year, she assumed the delicate task of conducting negotiations  with the immigration authorities so that Baha'is from Persia might be  permitted to enter New Zealand as University students, and was actively  engaged in this work up to the time of her passing on December 26th, 1949.          Note 9. (Letter No. 33)      Born in 1900, Miss Kitty Carpenter became a Baha'i in 1936 since when many  members of the Carpenter-Hancock family of which she is a member have  followed her and joined the Faith. An adventurous and enquiring soul, she  undertook her first pilgrimage to Haifa in 1938, arriving there shortly  after the marriage of Shoghi Effendi and, after living for two years in  Australia, she returned to New Zealand where she embarked on a life of  service to the Cause. Towards the end of the Second World War, she  willingly made available her premises (a counter lunch-shop) in Anzac  Avenue as a venue for the Auckland Baha'i community and, in the 1950's,  responded to the call by travel teaching in Mangakino and Whangarei. She  served on the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of New Zealand  during 1958 and, two years later, moved from Christchurch to Hamilton to  aid in establishing an assembly there. 1964 saw her travel teaching in  Invercargill and the following year she was appointed to the National  Teaching Committee. Responding to the need for the believers to establish  another assembly, Kitty finally made her home in Tauranga where she is an  active and much loved exponent of the Cause.          Note 10.

They should approach their task  with extreme humility, and endeavor, by their open-mindedness, their high  sense of justice and duty, their candor, their modesty, their entire  devotion to the welfare and interests of the friends, the Cause, and  humanity, to win, not only the confidence and the genuine support and  respect of those whom they serve, but also their esteem and real  affection. They must, at all times, avoid the spirit of exclusiveness, the  atmosphere of secrecy, free themselves from a domineering attitude, and  banish all forms of prejudice and passion from their deliberations. They  should, within the limits of wise discretion, take the friends into their  confidence, acquaint them with their plans, share with them their problems  and anxieties, and seek their advice and counsel. And, when they are  called upon to arrive at a certain decision, they should, after  dispassionate, anxious and cordial consultation, turn to God in prayer,  and with earnestness and conviction and courage record their vote and  abide by the voice of the majority, which we are told by our Master to be  the voice of truth, never to be challenged, and always to be  whole-heartedly enforced. To this voice the friends must heartily respond,  and regard it as the only means that can insure the protection and  advancement of the Cause.          Election of Delegates      Again I earnestly appeal to every one of you, and renew my only request  with all the ardor of my conviction, to make, before and during the coming  Convention, yet another effort, this time more spontaneous and selfless  than before, and endeavor to approach your task--the election of your  delegates, as well as your national and local representatives--with that  purity of spirit that can alone obtain our Beloved's most cherished  desire. Let us recall His explicit and often-repeated assurances that  every Assembly elected in that rarefied atmosphere of selflessness and  detachment is, in truth, appointed of God, that its verdict is truly  inspired, that one and all should submit to its decision unreservedly and  with cheerfulness.    Let us first strive to fulfill these conditions, difficult yet essential,  in our lives, so that, contented and assured, we may make of this new year  of activity a year of abundant blessings, of unprecedented achievements.    May this dearest wish be fulfilled!    SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine,  February 23, 1924.          Letter of September 24, 1924.      The beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout the  Continent of America:    Dear friends:    I return to the Holy Land with an overpowering sense of the gravity of the  spiritual state of the Cause in the world. Much as I deplore the  disturbing effect of my forced and repeated withdrawals from the field of  service, I can unhesitatingly assure you that my last and momentous step  was taken with extreme reluctance and only after mature and anxious  reflection as to the best way to safeguard the interests of a precious  Cause.    My prolonged absence, my utter inaction should not, however, be solely  attributed to certain external manifestations of unharmony, of discontent  and disloyalty--however paralysing their effect has been upon the  continuance of my work--but also to my own unworthiness and to my  imperfections and frailties.    I venture to request you to join me in yet another prayer, this time more  ardent and universal than before, supplicating with one voice the gracious  Master to overlook our weaknesses and failings, to make us worthier and  braver children of His own.          Our Inner Life      Humanity, through suffering and turmoil, is swiftly moving on towards its  destiny; if we be loiterers, if we fail to play our part surely others  will be called upon to take up our task as ministers to the crying needs  of this afflicted world.    Not by the force of numbers, not by the mere exposition of a set of new  and noble principles, not by an organized campaign of teaching--no matter  how worldwide and elaborate in its character--not even by the staunchness  of our faith or the exaltation of our enthusiasm, can we ultimately hope  to vindicate in the eyes of a critical and sceptical age the supreme claim  of the Abha Revelation. One thing and only one thing will unfailingly and  alone secure the undoubted triumph of this sacred Cause, namely, the  extent to which our own inner life and private character mirror forth in  their manifold aspects the splendor of those eternal principles proclaimed  by Baha'u'llah.    Looking back upon those sullen days of my retirement, bitter with feelings  of anxiety and gloom, I can recall with appreciation and gratitude those  unmistakable evidences of your affection and steadfast zeal which I have  received from time to time, and which have served to relieve in no small  measure the burden that weighed so heavily upon my heart.    I can well imagine the degree of uneasiness, nay of affliction, that must  have agitated the mind and soul of every loving and loyal servant of the  Beloved during these long months of suspense and distressing silence. But  I assure you such remarkable solicitude as you have shown for the  protection of His Cause, such tenacity of faith and unceasing activity as  you have displayed for its promotion, cannot but in the end be abundantly  rewarded by 'Abdu'l-Baha, who from His station above is the sure witness  of all that you have endured and suffered for Him.          Dawn of a Brighter Day      And now as I look into the future, I hope to see the friends at all times,  in every land, and of every shade of thought and character, voluntarily  and joyously rallying round their local and in particular their national  centers of activity, upholding and promoting their interests with complete  unanimity and contentment, with perfect understanding, genuine enthusiasm,  and sustained vigor. This indeed is the one joy and yearning of my life,  for it is the fountainhead from which all future blessings will flow, the  broad foundation upon which the security of the Divine Edifice must  ultimately rest. May we not hope that now at last the dawn of a brighter  day is breaking upon our beloved Cause?    SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine.  September 24, 1924.          Letter of November 24th, 1924.      To my dearly-beloved brothers and sisters in 'Abdu'l-Baha: care of the  American National Spiritual Assembly.    Dearest friends:    The day is drawing near when, for the third time, we shall commemorate the  world over the passing of our well-beloved 'Abdu'l-Baha. May we not pause  for a moment, and gather our thoughts? How has it fared with us, His  little band of followers, since that day? Whither are we now marching?  What has been our achievement?          Menace of Social Chaos      We have but to turn our eyes to the world without to realize the  fierceness and the magnitude of the forces of darkness that are struggling  with the dawning light of the Abha Revelation. Nations, though exhausted  and disillusioned, have seemingly begun to cherish anew the spirit of  revenge, of domination, and strife. Peoples, convulsed by economic  upheavals, are slowly drifting into two great opposing camps with all  their menace of social chaos, class hatreds, and worldwide ruin. Races,  alienated more than ever before, are filled with mistrust, humiliation and  fear, and seem to prepare themselves for a fresh and fateful encounter.  Creeds and religions, caught in this whirlpool of conflict and passion,  appear to gaze with impotence and despair at this spectacle of unceasing  turmoil.    Such is the plight of mankind three years after the passing of Him from  whose lips fell unceasingly the sure message of a fast-approaching Divine  salvation. Are we by our thoughts, our words, our deeds, whether  individually or collectively, preparing the way? Are we hastening the  advent of the Day He so often foretold?    None can deny that the flame of faith and love which His mighty hand  kindled in many hearts has, despite our bereavement, continued to burn as  brightly and steadily as ever before. Who can question that His loved  ones, both in the East and the West, notwithstanding the insidious  strivings of the enemies of the Cause, have displayed a spirit of  unshakable loyalty worthy of the highest praise? What greater perseverance  and fortitude than that which His tried and trusted friends have shown in  the face of untold calamities, intolerable oppression, and incredible  restrictions? But such staunchness of faith, such an unsullied love, such  magnificent loyalty, such heroic constancy, such noble courage, however  unprecedented and laudable in themselves, cannot alone lead us to the  final and complete triumph of such a great Cause. Not until the dynamic  love we cherish for Him is sufficiently reflected in its power and purity  in all our dealings with our fellow-men, however remotely connected and  humble in origin, can we hope to exalt in the eyes of a self-seeking world  the genuineness of the all-conquering love of God. Not until we live  ourselves the life of a true Baha'i can we hope to demonstrate the  creative and transforming potency of the Faith we profess. Nothing but the  abundance of our actions, nothing but the purity of our lives and the  integrity of our characters, can in the last resort establish our claim  that the Baha'i spirit is in this day the sole agency that can translate a  long-cherished ideal into an enduring achievement.          Paramount Duty of Every Baha'i      With this vision clearly set before us, and fortified by the knowledge of  the gracious aid of Baha'u'llah and the repeated assurances of  'Abdu'l-Baha, let us first strive to live the life and then arise with one  heart, one mind, one voice, to reinforce our numbers and achieve our end.  Let us recall, and seek on "]]]
