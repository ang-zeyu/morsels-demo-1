His arguments were strong,  and his large knowledge and wide experience supplied him with every  weapon for defense and attack. Beneath the lash of his invective and his  sarcasm the hottest of the slaveholders cowered away. He set his back  against a great principle. He never retreated an inch, he never yielded,  he never conciliated, he was always an assailant, and no man and no  body of men had the power to turn him. He had his dark hours, he felt  bitterly the isolation of his position, but he never swerved. He had  good right to set down in his diary, when the gag rule was repealed,  \"Blessed, forever blessed, be the name of God.\"          FRANCIS PARKMAN    (1822-1893)         He told the red man's story; far and wide        He searched the unwritten annals of his race;       He sat a listener at the Sachem's side,        He tracked the hunter through his wild-wood chase.         High o'er his head the soaring eagle screamed;        The wolfs long howl rang nightly; through the vale       Tramped the lone bear; the panther's eyeballs gleamed;        The bison's gallop thundered on the gale.         Soon o'er the horizon rose the cloud of strife,        Two proud, strong nations battling for the prize:       Which swarming host should mould a nation's life;        Which royal banner flout the western skies.         Long raged the conflict; on the crimson sod        Native and alien joined their hosts in vain;       The lilies withered where the lion trod,        Till Peace lay panting on the ravaged plain.         A nobler task was theirs who strove to win        The blood-stained heathen to the Christian fold;       To free from Satan's clutch the slaves of sin;        These labors, too, with loving grace he told.         Halting with feeble step, or bending o'er        The sweet-breathed roses which he loved so well,       While through long years his burdening cross he bore,        From those firm lips no coward accents fell.         A brave bright memory! His the stainless shield        No shame defaces and no envy mars!       When our far future's record is unsealed,        His name will shine among its morning stars.                               --Holmes.      The stories in this volume deal, for the most part, with single actions,  generally with deeds of war and feats of arms. In this one I desire  to give if possible the impression, for it can be no more than  an impression, of a life which in its conflicts and its victories  manifested throughout heroic qualities. Such qualities can be shown in  many ways, and the field of battle is only one of the fields of human  endeavor where heroism can be displayed.    Francis Parkman was born in Boston on September 16, 1822. He came of  a well-known family, and was of a good Puritan stock. He was rather a  delicate boy, with an extremely active mind and of a highly sensitive,  nervous organization. Into everything that attracted him he threw  himself with feverish energy. His first passion, when he was only about  twelve years old, was for chemistry, and his eager boyish experiments in  this direction were undoubtedly injurious to his health. The interest in  chemistry was succeeded by a passion for the woods and the wilderness,  and out of this came the longing to write the history of the men of the  wilderness, and of the great struggle between France and England for the  control of the North American continent. All through his college career  this desire was with him, and while in secret he was reading widely to  prepare himself for his task, he also spent a great deal of time in the  forests and on the mountains. To quote his own words, he was \"fond of  hardships, and he was vain of enduring them, cherishing a sovereign  scorn for every physical weakness or defect; but deceived, moreover, by  the rapid development of frame and sinew, which flattered him into the  belief that discipline sufficiently unsparing would harden him into an  athlete, he slighted the precautions of a more reasonable woodcraft,  tired old foresters with long marches, stopped neither for heat nor for  rain, and slept on the earth without blankets.\" The result was that his  intense energy carried him beyond his strength, and while his muscles  strengthened and hardened, his sensitive nervous organization began to  give way. It was not merely because he led an active outdoor life. He  himself protests against any such conclusion, and says that \"if any pale  student glued to his desk here seek an apology for a way of life whose  natural fruit is that pallid and emasculate scholarship, of which New  England has had too many examples, it will be far better that this  sketch had not been written. For the student there is, in its season, no  better place than the saddle, and no better companion than the rifle or  the oar.\"    The evil that was done was due to Parkman's highly irritable organism,  which spurred him to excess in everything he undertook. The first  special sign of the mischief he was doing to himself and his health  appeared in a weakness of sight. It was essential to his plan of  historical work to study not only books and records but Indian life from  the inside. Therefore, having graduated from college and the law-school,  he felt that the time had come for this investigation, which would  enable him to gather material for his history and at the same time  to rest his eyes. He went to the Rocky Mountains, and after great  hardships, living in the saddle, as he said, with weakness and pain, he  joined a band of Ogallalla Indians. With them he remained despite his  physical suffering, and from them he learned, as he could not have  learned in any other way, what Indian life really was.    The immediate result of the journey was his first book, instinct with  the freshness and wildness of the mountains and the prairies, and called  by him \"The Oregon Trail.\" Unfortunately, the book was not the only  outcome. The illness incurred during his journey from fatigue and  exposure was followed by other disorders. The light of the sun became  insupportable, and his nervous system was entirely deranged. His  sight was now so impaired that he was almost blind, and could neither  read nor write. It was a terrible prospect for a brilliant and ambitious  man, but Parkman faced it unflinchingly. He devised a frame by which  he could write with closed eyes, and books and manuscripts were read to  him. In this way he began the history of \"The Conspiracy of Pontiac,\"  and for the first half-year the rate of composition covered about six  lines a day. His courage was rewarded by an improvement in his health,  and a little more quiet in nerves and brain. In two and a half years he  managed to complete the book. He then entered upon his great subject of  \"France in the New World.\" The material was mostly in manuscript, and  had to be examined, gathered, and selected in Europe and in Canada.  He could not read, he could write only a very little and that with  difficulty, and yet he pressed on. He slowly collected his material and  digested and arranged it, using the eyes of others to do that which he  could not do himself, and always on the verge of a complete breakdown  of mind and body. In 1851 he had an effusion of water on the left knee,  which stopped his outdoor exercise, on which he had always largely  depended. All the irritability of the system then centered in the head,  resulting in intense pain and in a restless and devouring activity  of thought. He himself says: \"The whirl, the confusion, and strange,  undefined tortures attending this condition are only to be conceived  by one who has felt them.\" The resources of surgery and medicine were  exhausted in vain. The trouble in the head and eyes constantly recurred.  In 1858 there came a period when for four years he was incapable of the  slightest mental application, and the attacks varied in duration from  four hours to as many months. When the pressure was lightened a little  he went back to his work. When work was impossible, he turned to  horticulture, grew roses, and wrote a book about the cultivation of  those flowers which is a standard authority.    As he grew older the attacks moderated, although they never departed.  Sleeplessness pursued him always, the slightest excitement would deprive  him of the power of exertion, his sight was always sensitive, and at  times he was bordering on blindness. In this hard-pressed way he fought  the battle of life. He says himself that his books took four times as  long to prepare and write as if he had been strong and able to use his  faculties. That this should have been the case is little wonder, for  those books came into being with failing sight and shattered nerves,  with sleeplessness and pain, and the menace of insanity ever hanging  over the brave man who, nevertheless, carried them through to an end.    Yet the result of those fifty years, even in amount, is a noble one, and  would have been great achievement for a man who had never known a sick  day. In quality, and subject, and method of narration, they leave little  to be desired. There, in Parkman's volumes, is told vividly, strongly,  and truthfully, the history of the great struggle between France and  England for the mastery of the North American continent, one of the  most important events of modern times. This is not the place to give  any critical estimate of Mr. Parkman's work. It is enough to say that it  stands in the front rank. It is a great contribution to history, and  a still greater gift to the literature of this country. All Americans  certainly should read the volumes in which Parkman has told that  wonderful story of hardship and adventure, of fighting and of  statesmanship, which gave this great continent to the English race and  the English speech. But better than the literature or the history is  the heroic spirit of the man, which triumphed over pain and all other  physical obstacles, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18647"],[0,"Peeps at Many Lands: Egypt (#15)"],[1," *       *    Large crown 8vo., cloth, illustrated.      *In the Grip of the Wild Wa    Tales of St. Austin's    The Head of Kay's    Mike: A Public School Story    The Gold Bat    Psmith in the City    Psmith Journalist    The Pothunters    A Prefect's Uncle    The White Feather    *The First Voyages of Glorious    Memory _(Hakluyt)_    *Nipping Bear    *The Adventures of Don Quixote    *Park's Travels in the Interior of    Africa    *By a Schoolboy's Hand    *Exiled from School    *From Fag to Monitor    The Sea Monarch    *The Scouts of Seal Island    *Cook's Voyages and Discoveries    Dana's Two Years Before the    Mast    *The Divers    Stories from Waverly    *The Life of St. Paul    *The Book of Celtic Stories    *The Book of London    *The Book of Stars    *Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress    *Children's Book of Gardening    The Feats of Foozle    Now and Then    The Right Sort    God's Lantern Bearers    *The Kinsfolk and Friends of Jesus    *Children's Book of Art    *Book of Edinburgh    *Black's Boys Book    *Sea Scouts of the \"Petrel\"    *Muckle John    *Renegade    *Tales from the Poets    *Tom Browne's Schooldays    *Talks about Birds    *The Book of the Railway    *Swiss Family Robinson    *The Heroes    *My Own Stories    The Story of Stories: A Life of Christ for the Young    *Tales from Scottish Ballads    The Story of a Scout    Two Boys in War-Time    *The Story of Robin Hood and His Merry Men    *The Wolf Patrol    *Jack Haydon's Quest    Red Men of the Dusk    The Saints in Story    *The Vicar of Wakefield    The Mystery of Markham    Black Evans    J.O.
