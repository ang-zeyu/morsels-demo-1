I have nothing--and no one.\"    \"Well,\" said Ben Weatherstaff slowly, as he watched her, \"that's true.  Tha' hasn't.\"    He said it in such an odd way that Mary wondered if he was actually a  little sorry for her. She had never felt sorry for herself; she had only  felt tired and cross, because she disliked people and things so much.  But now the world seemed to be changing and getting nicer. If no one  found out about the secret garden, she should enjoy herself always.    She stayed with him for ten or fifteen minutes longer and asked him as  many questions as she dared. He answered every one of them in his queer  grunting way and he did not seem really cross and did not pick up his  spade and leave her. He said something about roses just as she was  going away and it reminded her of the ones he had said he had been fond  of.    \"Do you go and see those other roses now?\" she asked.    \"Not been this year. My rheumatics has made me too stiff in th' joints.\"    He said it in his grumbling voice, and then quite suddenly he seemed to  get angry with her, though she did not see why he should.    \"Now look here!\" he said sharply. \"Don't tha' ask so many questions.  Tha'rt th' worst wench for askin' questions I've ever come across. Get  thee gone an' play thee. I've done talkin' for to-day.\"    And he said it so crossly that she knew there was not the least use in  staying another minute. She went skipping slowly down the outside walk,  thinking him over and saying to herself that, queer as it was, here was  another person whom she liked in spite of his crossness. She liked old  Ben Weatherstaff. Yes, she did like him. She always wanted to try to  make him talk to her. Also she began to believe that he knew everything  in the world about flowers.    There was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret garden and  ended at a gate which opened into a wood, in the park. She thought she  would skip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there were  any rabbits hopping about. She enjoyed the skipping very much and when  she reached the little gate she opened it and went through because she  heard a low, peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what it  was.    It was a very strange thing indeed. She quite caught her breath as she  stopped to look at it. A boy was sitting under a tree, with his back  against it, playing on a rough wooden pipe. He was a funny looking boy  about twelve. He looked very clean and his nose turned up and his cheeks  were as red as poppies and never had Mistress Mary seen such round and  such blue eyes in any boy's face. And on the trunk of the tree he leaned  against, a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him, and from behind  a bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching his neck to peep  out, and quite near him were two rabbits sitting up and sniffing with  tremulous noses--and actually it appeared as if they were all drawing  near to watch him and listen to the strange low little call his pipe  seemed to make.    When he saw Mary he held up his hand and spoke to her in a voice almost  as low as and rather like his piping.    \"Don't tha' move,\" he said. \"It'd flight 'em.\"    Mary remained motionless. He stopped playing his pipe and began to rise  from the ground. He moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though he  were moving at all, but at last he stood on his feet and then the  squirrel scampered back up into the branches of his tree, the pheasant  withdrew his head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hop  away, though not at all as if they were frightened.    \"I'm Dickon,\" the boy said. \"I know tha'rt Miss Mary.\"    Then Mary realized that somehow she had known at first that he was  Dickon. Who else could have been charming rabbits and pheasants as the  natives charm snakes in India? He had a wide, red, curving mouth and his  smile spread all over his face.    \"I got up slow,\" he explained, \"because if tha' makes a quick move it  startles 'em. A body 'as to move gentle an' speak low when wild things  is about.\"    He did not speak to her as if they had never seen each other before but  as if he knew her quite well. Mary knew nothing about boys and she spoke  to him a little stiffly because she felt rather shy.    \"Did you get Martha's letter?\" she asked.    He nodded his curly, rust-colored head.    \"That's why I come.\"    He stooped to pick up something which had been lying on the ground  beside him when he piped.    \"I've got th' garden tools. There's a little spade an' rake an' a fork  an' hoe. Eh! they are good 'uns. There's a trowel, too. An' th' woman in  th' shop threw in a packet o' white poppy an' one o' blue larkspur when  I bought th' other seeds.\"    \"Will you show the seeds to me?\" Mary said.    She wished she could talk as he did. His speech was so quick and easy.  It sounded as if he liked her and was not the least afraid she would not  like him, though he was only a common moor boy, in patched clothes and  with a funny face and a rough, rusty-red head. As she came closer to him  she noticed that there was a clean fresh scent of heather and grass and  leaves about him, almost as if he were made of them. She liked it very  much and when she looked into his funny face with the red cheeks and  round blue eyes she forgot that she had felt shy.    \"Let us sit down on this log and look at them,\" she said.    They sat down and he took a clumsy little brown paper package out of his  coat pocket. He untied the string and inside there were ever so many  neater and smaller packages with a picture of a flower on each one.    \"There's a lot o' mignonette an' poppies,\" he said. \"Mignonette's th'  sweetest smellin' thing as grows, an' it'll grow wherever you cast it,  same as poppies will. Them as'll come up an' bloom if you just whistle  to 'em, them's th' nicest of all.\"    He stopped and turned his head quickly, his poppy-cheeked face lighting  up.    \"Where's that robin as is callin' us?\" he said.    The chirp came from a thick holly bush, bright with scarlet berries, and  Mary thought she knew whose it was.    \"Is it really calling us?\" she asked.    \"Aye,\" said Dickon, as if it was the most natural thing in the world,  \"he's callin' some one he's friends with. That's same as sayin' 'Here I  am. Look at me. I wants a bit of a chat.' There he is in the bush. Whose  is he?\"    \"He's Ben Weatherstaff's, but I think he knows me a little,\" answered  Mary.    \"Aye, he knows thee,\" said Dickon in his low voice again. \"An' he likes  thee. He's took thee on. He'll tell me all about thee in a minute.\"    He moved quite close to the bush with the slow movement Mary had noticed  before, and then he made a sound almost like the robin's own twitter.  The robin listened a few seconds, intently, and then answered quite as  if he were replying to a question.    \"Aye, he's a friend o' yours,\" chuckled Dickon.    \"Do you think he is?\" cried Mary eagerly. She did so want to know. \"Do  you think he really likes me?\"    \"He wouldn't come near thee if he didn't,\" answered Dickon. \"Birds is  rare choosers an' a robin can flout a body worse than a man. See, he's  making up to thee now. 'Cannot tha' see a chap?' he's sayin'.\"    And it really seemed as if it must be true. He so sidled and twittered  and tilted as he hopped on his bush.    \"Do you understand everything birds say?\" said Mary.    Dickon's grin spread until he seemed all wide, red, curving mouth, and  he rubbed his rough head.    \"I think I do, and they think I do,\" he said. \"I've lived on th' moor  with 'em so long. I've watched 'em break shell an' come out an' fledge  an' learn to fly an' begin to sing, till I think I'm one of 'em.  Sometimes I think p'raps I'm a bird, or a fox, or a rabbit, or a  squirrel, or even a beetle, an' I don't know it.\"    He laughed and came back to the log and began to talk about the flower  seeds again. He told her what they looked like when they were flowers;  he told her how to plant them, and watch them, and feed and water them.    \"See here,\" he said suddenly, turning round to look at her. \"I'll plant  them for thee myself. Where is tha' garden?\"    Mary's thin hands clutched each other as they lay on her lap. She did  not know what to say, so for a whole minute she said nothing. She had  never thought of this. She felt miserable. And she felt as if she went  red and then pale.    \"Tha's got a bit o' garden, hasn't tha'?\" Dickon said.    It was true that she had turned red and then pale. Dickon saw her do it,  and as she still said nothing, he began to be puzzled.    \"Wouldn't they give thee a bit?\" he asked. \"Hasn't tha' got any yet?\"    She held her hands even tighter and turned her eyes toward him.    \"I don't know anything about boys,\" she said slowly. \"Could you keep a  secret, if I told you one? It's a great secret. I don't know what I  should do if any one found it out. I believe I should die!\" She said the  last sentence quite fiercely.    Dickon looked more puzzled than ever and even rubbed his hand over his  rough head again, but he answered quite good-humoredly.    \"I'm keepin' secrets all th' time,\" he said. \"If I couldn't keep secrets  from th' other lads, secrets about foxes' cubs, an' birds' nests, an'  wild things' holes, there'd be naught safe on th' moor. Aye, I can keep  secrets.\"    Mistress Mary did not mean to put out her hand and clutch his sleeve but  she did it.    \"I've stolen a garden,\" she said very fast. \"It isn't mine. It isn't  anybody's. Nobody wants it, nobody cares for it, nobody ever goes into  it. Perhaps everything is dead in it already; I don't know.\"    She began to feel hot and as contrary as she had ever felt in her life.    \"I don't care, I don't care! Nobody has any right to take it from me  when I care about it and they don't. They're letting it die, all shut in  by itself,\" she ended passionately, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1740"],[0,"The Flying U's Last Stand (#15)"],[1,"eminently fair. We guaranteed to furnish a claim of eighty, acres to  every person who joined our homeseekers' Club, and free pasturage to all  the stock they wanted to bring. Failing to do that, we pledged ourselves  to refund the fee and pay all return expenses. We could have located  every member of this lot, and more--only for YOU.\"    \"Say, it'd be just as easy to swear as to say 'you' in that tone uh  voice,\" Andy pointed out placidly.    \"You managed to gobble up just exactly four thousand acres of this  tract--and you were careful to get all the water and all the best land.  That means you have knocked us out of fifty settlements--\"    \"Fifty wads of coin to hand back to fifty come-ons, and fifty return  tickets for fifty fellows glad to get back--tough luck, ain't it?\" Andy  smiled sympathetically. \"You oughta be glad I saved your conscience that  much of a load, anyway.\"    Florence Grace Hallman bit her lip to control her rage. \"Smart talk  isn't going to help you, Mr. Green. You've simply placed yourself in  a position you can't' hold. You've put it up to us to fight--and we're  going to do it. I'm playing fair with you. I'll tell you this much: I've  investigated you and your friends pretty thoroughly, and it's easy to  guess what your object is. We rather expected the Flying U to fight this  colonization scheme, so we are neither surprised nor unprepared. Mr.  Green, for your own interest and that of your employer, let me advise  you to abandon your claims now, before we begin action in the matter.  It will be simpler, and far, far cheaper. We have our clients to look  after, and we have the law all on our side. These are bona fide settlers  we are bringing in; men and women whose sole object is to make homes for  themselves. The land laws are pretty strict, Mr. Green. If we set the  wheels in motion they will break the Flying U.\"    Andy grinned while he inspected his cigarette. \"Funny--I heard a man  brag once about how he'd break the Flying U, with sheep,\" he drawled.  \"He didn't connect, though; the Flying U broke him.\" He smoked until he  saw an angry retort parting the red lips of the lady, and then continued  calmly:    \"The Flying U has got nothing to do with this case. As a matter of fact,  old man Whitmore is pretty sore at us fellows right now, because we quit  him and turned nesters right under his nose. Miss Hallman, you'll have  one sweet time proving that we ain't bona fide settlers. We're just  crazy to make homes for ourselves. We think it's time we settled  down--and we're settling here because we're used to this country. We're  real sorry you didn't find it necessary to pay your folks for the fun of  pointing out the land to us and steering us to the land office--but we  can't help that. We needed the money to buy plows.\" He looked at her  full with his honest, gray eyes that could so deceive his fellow men--to  say nothing of women. \"And that reminds me, I've got to go and borrow a  garden rake. I'm planting a patch of onions,\" he explained engagingly.  \"Say, this farming is a great game, isn't it? Well, good day, Miss  Hallman. Glad I happened to meet you.\"    \"You won't be when I get through with you!\" predicted the lady with her  firm chin thrust a little forward. \"You think you've got everything your  own way, don't you? Well, you've just simply put yourself in a position  where we can get at you. You deceived me from the very start--and now  you shall pay the penalty. I've got our clients to protect--and besides  that I shall dearly love to get even. Oh, you'll squeal for mercy,  believe me!\" She touched up the horses with her whip and went bumping  away over the tough sod.    \"Wow!\" ejaculated Andy, looking after her with laughter in his eyes.  \"She's sure one mad lady, all right. But shucks!\" He turned and galloped  off toward the farthest claim, which was Happy Jack's and the last one  to be furnished with a lawful habitation.    He was lucky. The Happy Family were foregathered there, wrangling with  Happy Jack over some trifling thing. He joined zealously in the argument  and helped them thrash Happy Jack in the word-war, before he came at his  errand.    \"Say, boys, we'll have to get busy now,\" he told them seriously at last.  \"Florence Grace is onto us bigger'n a wolf--and if I'm any judge, that  lady's going to be some fighter. We've either got to plow up a bunch of  ground and plant some darn thing, or else get stock on and pasture it.  They ain't going to over look any bets from now on. I met her back here  on the bench. She was so mad she talked too much and I got next to their  scheme--seems like we've knocked the Syndicate outa quite a bunch of  money, all right. They want this land, and they think they're going to  get it.    \"Now my idea is this: We've got to have stock, or we can't graze the  land. And if we take Flying U cattle and throw 'em on here, they'll  contest us for taking fake claims, for the outfit. So what's the matter  with us buying a bunch from the Old Man?\"    \"I'm broke,\" began Pink promptly, but Andy stopped him.    \"Listen here. We buy a bunch of stock and give him mortgages for the  money, with the cattle for security. We graze 'em till the mortgage runs  out--till we prove up, that means--and then we don't spot up, and  the Old Man takes the stock back, see? We're grazing our own stock,  according to law--but the outfit--\"    \"Where do we git off at?\" demanded Happy Jack suspiciously. \"We got to  live--and it takes money to buy grub, these days.\"    \"Well, we'll make out all right. We can have so many head of cattle  named for the mortgage; there'll be increase, and we should get that. By  the time we all prove up we'll have a little bunch of stock of our own'  d' uh see? And we'll have the range--what there is left. These squatters  ain't going to last over winter, if you ask me. And it'll be a long,  cold day when another bunch of greenhorns bites on any colony scheme.\"    \"How do you know the Old Man'll do that, though?\" Weary wanted to know.  \"He's pretty mad. I rode over to the ranch last week to see Chip, and  the Old Man wouldn't have anything to say to me.\"    \"Well, what's the matter with all of us going? He can't pass up the  whole bunch. We can put it up to him just the way it is, and he'll see  where it's going to be to his interest to let us have the cattle. Why,  darn it, he can't help seeing now why we quit!\" Pink looked ready to  start then, while his enthusiasm was fresh.    \"Neither can Florence Grace help seeing why we did it,\" Andy  supplemented dryly. \"She can think what she darn pleases--all we got to  do is deliver the goods right up to the handle, on these claims and not  let her prove anything on us.\"    \"It'll take a lot uh fencing,\" Happy Jack croaked pessimistically. \"We  ain't got the money to buy wire and posts, ner the time to build the  fence.\"    \"What's the matter with rang-herding 'em?\" Andy seemed to have thought  it all out, and to have an answer for every objection. \"We can take  turns at that--and we must all be careful and don't let 'em graze on our  neighbors!\"    Whereat the Happy Family grinned understandingly.    \"Maybe the Old Man'll let us have three or four hundred head uh cows on  shares,\" Cal hazarded optimistically.    \"Can't take 'em that way,\" said the Native Son languidly. \"It wouldn't  be safe. Andy's right; the way to do is buy the cattle outright, and  give a mortgage on the bunch. And I think we better split the bunch,  and let every fellow buy a few head. We can graze 'em together--the law  can't stop us from doing that.\"    \"Sounds good--if the Old Man will come to the centre,\" said Weary  dubiously. The chill atmosphere of Flying U coulee, with strangers in  the bunk-house and with the Old Man scowling at his paper on the porch,  had left its effect upon Weary, sunny-souled as he was.    \"Oh, he'll come through,\" cried Cal, moving toward his horse, \"gee whiz,  he's got to! Come on--let's go and get it done with. As it stands now,  we ain't got a thing to do but set around and look wise--unless we go  spoiling good grass with plows. First thing we know our neighbors will  be saying we ain't improving our claims!\"    \"You improve yours every time you git off it!\" stated Happy Jack  spitefully because of past wrongs. \"You could improve mine a whole lot  that way, too,\" he added when he heard the laugh of approval from the  others.    They rung all the changes possible upon that witticism while they  mounted and rode away, every man of them secretly glad of some excuse  for making overtures to the Old Man. Spite of the excitement of getting  on to their claims, and of watching strangers driving here and there in  haste, and hauling loads of lumber toilfully over the untracked grass  and building chickencoop dwellings as nearly alike as the buttons on  a new shirt--spite of all that they had felt keenly their exile from  Flying U ranch. They had stayed away, for two reasons: one was a latent  stubbornness which made them resent the Old Man's resentment; the other  was a matter of policy, as preached by Andy Green and the Native Son. It  would not do, said these two cautious ones, to be running to the Flying  U outfit all the time.    So the Happy Family had steered clear since that afternoon when they had  simulated treachery to the outfit. And fate played them a scurvy trick  in spite of their caution, for just as they rode down the Hog's Back and  across the ford, Florence Grace Hallman rode away from the White House  and met them fairly at the stable.    Florence Grace smiled a peculiar smile as she went past them. A smile  that promised she would not forget; a smile that told them how sure  she felt of having caught them fairly. With the smile went a chilly,  supercilious bow that was worse than a direct cut, and which the Happy  Family returned doubtfully, not at all sure of the rules governing  warfare with a woman.
