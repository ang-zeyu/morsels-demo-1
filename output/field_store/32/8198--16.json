Rome, which made the world good, was wont to  have two Suns,[3] which made visible both one road and the other,  that of the world and that of God. One has extinguished the  other; and the sword is joined to the crozier; and the two  together must of necessity go ill, because, being joined, one  feareth not the other. If thou believest rue not, consider the  grain,[4] for every herb is known by its seed.    [1] The shepherd who precedes the flock, and should lead it  aright, is the Pope. A mystical interpretation of the injunction  upon the children of Israel (Leviticus, xi.) in regard to clean  and unclean beasts was familiar to the schoolmen. St. Augustine  expounds the cloven hoof as symbolic of right conduct, because it  does not easily slip, and the chewing of the cud as signifying  the meditation of wisdom. Dante seems here to mean that the Pope  has the true doctrine, but makes not the true use of it for his  own guidance and the government of the world.    [2] Material good.    [3] Pope and Emperor.    [4] The results that follow this forced union.      \"Within the land which the Adige and the Po water, valor and  courtesy were wont to be found before Frederick had his  quarrel;[1] now safely anyone may pass there who out of shame  would cease discoursing with the good, or drawing near them.  Truly three old men are still there in whom the antique age  rebukes the new, and it seems late to them ere God restore them  to the better life; Currado da Palazzo, and the good Gherardo,[2]  and Guido da Castel, who is better named, after the manner of the  French, the simple Lombard.[3]    [1] Before the Emperor Frederick II. had his quarrel with the  Pope; that is, before Emperor and Pope had failed in their  respective duties to each other.    [2] Gherardo da Camino, \"who was noble in his life, and whose  memory will always be noble,\" says Dante in the Convito, iv. 14.    [3] \"The French,\" says Benvenuto da Linda, \"call all Italians  Lombards, and repute them very astute.\"      \"Say thou henceforth, that the Church of Rome, through  confounding in itself two modes of rule,[1] falls in the mire,  and defiles itself and its burden.\"    [1] The spiritual and the temporal.      \"O Marco mine,\" said I, \"thou reasonest well; and now I discern  why the sons of Levi were excluded from the heritage;[1] but what  Gherardo is that, who, thou sayest, remains for sample of the  extinct folk, in reproach of the barbarous age?\" \"Either thy  speech deceives me, or it is making trial of me,\" he replied to  me, \"in that, speaking Tuscan to me, it seems that of the good  Gherardo thou knowest naught. By other added name I know him not,  unless I should take it from his daughter Gaia.[2] May God be  with you! for further I come not with you. Behold the brightness  which rays already glimmering through the smoke, and it behoves  me to depart--the Angel is there--ere I appear to him.\"[3] So he  turned, and would not hear me more.    [1] \"The Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the  covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister unto  him, and to bless in his name, unto this day. Wherefore Levi hath  no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the Lord is his  inheritance.\"--Deuteronomy, x. 8-9.

CANTO XVII. Third Ledge the Wrathful.--Issue from the  Smoke.--Vision of examples of Anger.--Ascent to the Fourth Ledge,  where Sloth is purged.--Second Nightfall.--Virgil explains how  Love is the root of Virtue and of Sin.      Recall to mind, reader, if ever on the alps a cloud closed round  thee, through which thou couldst not see otherwise than the mole  through its skin, how, when the humid and dense vapors begin to  dissipate, the ball of the sun enters feebly through them: and  thy imagination will easily come to see, how at first I saw again  the sun, which was already at its setting. So, matching mine to  the trusty steps of my Master, I issued forth from such a cloud  to rays already dead on the low shores.    O power imaginative, that dost sometimes so steal us from outward  things that a man heeds it not, although around him a thousand  trumpets sound, who moveth thee if the sense afford thee naught?  A light, that in the heavens is formed, moveth thee by itself, or  by a will that downward guides it?    [1] If the imagination is not stirred by some object of sense, it  is moved by the influence of the stars, or directly by the Divine  will.      In my imagination appeared the impress of the impiety of her[1]  who changed her form into the bird that most delights in singing.  And here was my mind so shut up within itself that from without  came nothing which then might he received by it. Then rained down  within my high fantasy, one crucified,[2] scornful and fierce in  his look, and thus was dying. Around him were the great  Ahasuerus, Esther his wife, and the just Mordecai, who was in  speech and action so blameless. And when this imagination burst  of itself, like a bubble for which the water fails, beneath which  it was made, there rose in my vision a maiden,[3] weeping  bitterly, and she was saying, \"O queen, wherefore through anger  hast thou willed to be naught? Thou hast killed thyself in order  not to lose Lavinia: now thou hast lost me: I am she who mourns,  mother, at thine, before another's ruin.    [1] Progne or Philomela, according to one or the other version of  the tragic myth, was changed into the nightingale, after her  anger had led her to take cruel vengeance on Tereus.    [2] Haman, who, according to the English version, was hanged, but  according to the Vulgate, was crucified--Esther, vii.    [3] Lavinia, whose mother, Amata, killed herself in a rage at  hearing premature report of the death of Turnus, to whom she  desired that Lavinia should be married.--Aeneid, xii. 595-607.      As sleep is broken, when of a sudden the new light strikes the  closed eyes, and, broken, quivers ere it wholly dies, so my  imagining fell down, soon as a light, greater by far than that to  which we are accustomed, struck my face. I turned me to see where  I was, when a voice said, \"Here is the ascent;\" which from every  other object of attention removed me, and made my will so eager  to behold who it was that was, speaking that it never rests till  it is face to face. But, as before the sun which weighs down our  sight, and by excess veils its own shape, so here my power  failed. \"This is a divine spirit who directs us, without our  asking, on the way to go up, and with his own light conceals  himself. He does for us as a man doth for himself; for he who  sees the need and waits for asking, malignly sets himself already  to denial. Now let us grant our feet to such an invitation; let  us hasten to ascend ere it grows dark, for after, it would not be  possible until the day returns.\" Thus said my Guide; and I and he  turned our steps to a stairway. And soon as I was on the first  step, near use I felt a motion as of wings, and a fanning on my  face,[1] and I heard said, \"Beati pacifici,'[2] who are without  ill anger.\"    [1] By which the angel removes the third P from Dante's brow.    [2] \"Blessed are the peacemakers.\"      Now were the last sunbeams on which the night follows so lifted  above us, that the stars were appearing on many sides. \"O my  virtue, why dost thou so melt away?\" to myself I said, for I felt  the power of my legs put in truce. We had come where the stair no  farther ascends, and we were stayed fast even as a ship that  arrives at the shore. And I listened a little, if I might hear  anything in the new circle. Then I turned to my Master, and said,  \"My sweet Father, say what offence is purged here in the circle  where we are: if the feet are stopped, let not thy discourse  stop.\" And he to me, \"The love of good, less than it should have  been, is here restored;[1] here is plied again the ill-slackened  oar. But that thou mayst still more clearly understand, turn thy  mind to me, and thou shalt gather some good fruit from our delay.    [1] It is the round on which the sin of acedie, sloth, is purged  away.      \"Neither Creator nor creature,\" began he, \"son, ever was without  love, either natural, or of the mind,[1] and this thou knowest.  The natural is always without error; but the other may err either  through an evil object, or through too much or through too little  vigor. While love is directed on the primal goods, and on the  second moderates itself, it cannot be the cause of ill delight.  But when it is bent to evil,[2] or runs to good with more zeal,  or with less, than it ought, against the Creator works his own  creature. Hence thou canst comprehend that love needs must be the  seed in you of every virtue, and of every action that deserves  punishment.    [1] Either native in the soul, as the love of God, or determined  by the choice, through free will, of some object of desire in the  mind.    [2] A wrong object of desire.      \"Now since love can never bend its sight from the welfare of its  subject,[1] all things are safe from hatred of themselves; and  since no being can be conceived of divided from the First,[2] and  standing by itself, from hating Him[3] every affection is cut  off. It follows, if, distinguishing, I rightly judge, that the  evil which is loved is that of one s neighbor; and in three modes  is this love born within your clay. There is he who hopes to  excel through the abasement of his neighbor, and only longs that  from his greatness he may be brought low.[4] There is he who  fears loss of power, favor, honor, fame, because another rises;  whereat he is so saddened that he loves the opposite.[5] And  there is he who seems so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1997"],[0,"The Divine Comedy, Volume 3, Paradise (#15)"],[1,"St. John the Baptist.      As a coal quickens to flame at the blowing of the winds, so I saw  that light become resplendent at my blandishments, and as it  became more beautiful to my eyes, so with voice more dulcet and  soft, but not with this modern speech, it said to me, \"From  that clay on which Ave was said, unto the birth in which my  mother, who. now is sainted, was lightened of me with whom she  was burdened, this fire had come to its Lion[1] five hundred,  fifty, and thirty times to reinflame itself beneath his paw.[2]  My ancestors and I were born in the place where the last ward is  first found by him who runs in your annual game.[3] Let it  suffice to hear this of my elders. Who they were, and whence they  came thither, it is more becoming to leave untold than to  recount.    [1]--Mars   As he glow'd like a ruddy shield on the Lion's breast.--Maud,  part III. The Lion is the sign Leo in the Zodiac, appropriate to  Mars by supposed conformity of disposition.    [2] Five hundred and eighty revolutions of Mars are accomplished  in a little more than ten hundred and ninety years.    [3] The place designated was the boundary of the division of the  city called that of \"the Gate of St. Peter,\" where the Corso  passes by the Mercato Vecchio or Old Market. The races were run  along the Corso on the 24th June, the festival of St. John the  Baptist.      \"All those able to bear arms who at that time were there,  between Mars and the Baptist,[1] were the fifth of them who are  living. But the citizenship, which is now mixed with Campi and  with Certaldo and with Figghine,[2] was to be seen pure in the  lowest artisan. Oh, how much better it would be that those folk  of whom I speak were neighbors, and to have your confine at  Galluzzo and at Trespiano,[3] than to have them within, and to  endure the stench of the churl of Aguglione,[4] and of him of  Signa, who already has his eye sharp for barratry!    [1] Between the Ponte Vecchio, at the head of which stood the  statue of Mars, and the Baptistery,--two points marking the  circuit of the ancient walls.    [2] Small towns not far from Florence, from which, as from many  others, there had been emigration to the thriving city, to the  harm of its own people.    [3] It would have been better to keep these people at a distance,  as neighbors, and to have narrow bounds for the territory of the  city.    [4] The churl of Aguglione was, according to Benvenuto da  Imola, a lawyer named Baldo, \"qui fuit magnus canis.\" He became  one of the priors of Florence in 1311. He of Signa is supposed to  have been one Bonifazio, who, says Buti, \"sold his favors and  offices.\"      \"If the people which most degenerates in the world[1] had not  been as a stepdame unto Caesar, but like a mother benignant to  her son, there is one now a Florentine[2] who changes money and  traffics, who would have returned to Simifonti, there where his  grandsire used to go begging. Montemurlo would still belong to  its Counts, the Cerchi would be in the parish of Acone, and  perhaps the Buondelmonti in Valdigreve.[3] The confusion of  persons has always been the beginning of the harm of the city, as  in the body the food which is added.[4] And a blind bull falls  more headlong than the blind lamb; and oftentimes one sword cuts  more and better than five. If thou regardest Luni and  Urbisaglia,[5] how they have gone, and how Chiusi and Sinigaglia  are going their way after them, to hear how families are undone  will not appear to thee a strange thing or a bard, since cities  have their term.[6] Your things all have their death even as ye;  but it is concealed in some that last long, while lives are  short. And as the revolution of the heaven of the Moon covers and  uncovers the shores without a pause, so fortune does with  Florence. Wherefore what I shall tell of the high Florentines,  whose fame is hidden by time, should not appear to thee a  marvellous thing. I saw the Ughi, and I saw the Catellini,  Filippi, Greci, Ormanni, and Alberichi, even in their decline,  illustrious citizens; and I saw, as great as they were old, with  those of the Sannella, those of the Area, and Soldanieri, and  Ardinghi, and Bostiebi.[7] Over the gate which at present is  laden with new felony[8] of such weight that soon there will be  jettison from the bark,[9] were the Ravignani, from whom the  Count Guido is descended,[10] and whosoever since has taken the  name of the high Bellincione. He of the Pressa knew already bow  one needs to rule, and Galigaio already had in his house the  gilded hilt and pummel.[11] Great were already the column of the  Vair,[12] the Sacchetti, Giuochi, Fifanti, and Barucci, and  Galli, and they who blush for the bushel.[13] The stock from  which the Calfucci sprang was already great, and already the  Sizii. and Arrigucci had been drawn to curule chairs.[14] Oh how  great did I see those who have been undone by their pride![15]  and the balls of gold[16] made Florence flourish with all their  great deeds. So did the fathers of those who always,when your  church is vacant, become fat, staying in consistory.[17] The  overweening race which is as a dragon behind him who flies, and  to him who shows tooth or purse is gentle as a lamb,[18] already  was coming up, but from small folk, so that it pleased not  Ubertin Donato that his father-in-law should afterwards make him  their relation.[19] Already had Caponsacco descended into the  market place down from Fiesole, and already was Giuda a good  citizen, and Infangato.[20] I will tell a thing incredible and  true: into the little circle one entered by a gate which was  named for those of the Pear.[21] Every one who bears the  beautiful ensign of the great baron[22] whose name and whose  praise the feast of Thomas revives, from him had knighthood  and privilege; although to-day he who binds it with a border  unites himself with the populace.[23] Already there were  Gualterotti and Importuni; and Borgo[24] would now be more  quiet, if they had gone hung for new neighbors. The house of  which was born your weeping,[25] through its just indignation  which has slain you, and put an end to your glad living, was  honored, both itself and its consorts. O Buondelmonte, how ill  didst thou flee its nuptials through the persuasions of another!  [26] Many would be glad who now are sorrowful, if God had  conceded thee to the Ema[27] the first time that thou camest to  the city. But it behoved that Florence in her last peace should  offer a victim to that broken stone which guards the bridge.[28]    [1] If the clergy had not quarrelled with the Emperor, bringing  about factions and disturbances in the world.    [2] \"I have not discovered who this is,\" says Buti.    [3] The Conti Guidi had been compelled to sell to the Florentines  their stronghold of Montemurlo, because they could not defend it  from the Pistoians. The Cerchi and the Buondelmonti had been  forced by the Florentine Commune to give up their fortresses and  to take up their abode in the city, where they became powerful,  and where the bitterness of intestine discord and party strife  had been greatly enhanced by their quarrels.    [4] Food added to that already in process of digestion.    [5] Cities once great, now fallen.    [6] Cities longer-lived than families.    [7] All once great families, but now extinct, or fallen.    [8] Above the gate of St. Peter rose the walls of the abode of  the Cerchi, the head of the White faction.    [9] The casting overboard was the driving out of the leaders of  the Whites in 1302.    [10] The Count Guido married Gualdrada, the daughter of  Bellincione Berti.    [11] Symbols of knighthood; the use of gold in their  accoutrements being reserved for knights.    [12] The family of the Pigli, whose scatcheon was, in heraldic  terms, gules, a pale, vair; in other words, a red shield divided  longitudinally by a stripe of the heraldic representation of the  fur called vair.    [13] The Chiaramontesi, one of whom in the old days, being the  officer in charge of the sale of salt for the Commune, had  cheated both the Commune and the people by using a false measure.  See Purgatory, Canto XII.    [14] To high civic office.    [15] The Uberti, the great family of which Farinata was the most  renowned member.    [16] The Lamberti, who bore golden balls on their shields.    [17] The Visdomini, patrons of the Bishopric of Florence, who,  after the death of a bishop, by deferring the appointment of his  successor grew fat on the episcopal revenues.    [18] The Adimari. Benvenuto da Imola reports that one Boccacino  Adimari, after Dante's banishment, got possession of his  property, and always afterward was his bitter enemy.    [19] Ubertin Donato married a daughter of Bellincion Berti, and  was displeased that her sister should afterwards be given to one  of the Adimari.    [20] There seems to be a touch of humor in these three names of  \"Head in bag,\" \"Judas,\" and \"Bemired.\"    [21] The Peruzzi, who bore the pear as a charge upon their  scutcheon. The incredible thing may have been that the people  were so simple and free from jealousy as to allow a public gate  to bear the name of a private family. The \"little circle\" was the  circle of the old walls.    [22] Hugh, imperial vicar of Tuscany in the time of Otho II. and  Otho III. He died on St. Thomas's Day, December 21st, 1006, and  was buried in the Badia, the foundation of which is ascribed to  him; there his monument is still to be seen, and there of old, on  the anniversary of his death, a discourse in his praise was  delivered. Several families, whose heads were knighted by him,  adopted his arms, with some distinctive addlition. His scutcheon  was paly of four, argent and gules.    [23] Giano della Bella, the great leader of the Florentine  commonalty in the latter years of the 13th century. He bore the  arms of Hugh with a border of gold.
