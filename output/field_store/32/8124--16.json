After awhile, the log on which he  sat approached so near the saw, that he got scratched a little, and he  hitched away a few feet from the saw, and resumed his dinner. But the  saw scratched him again soon, of course, and this time rather more  seriously. Bruin got angry, and his anger cost him dearly. He wheeled  about, and throwing his paws around the saw, he gave it a most desperate  hug. In this position he remained, until he was sawn into two pieces, as  if he had been a log. Poor fellow! we ought to pity him, I suppose; but  it is pretty difficult to avoid a hearty laugh over his misfortunes.    Here is a story of an encounter between a bear and a bull, which is also  rather laughable, although there is a good deal of the tragic in it. A  bull was attacked in the forest by a rather small bear, when, striking  his horns into his assailant, he pinned him against a tree. In this  situation they were both found dead; the bull from starvation, the bear  from his wounds.    Some years ago, a New Hampshire boy found a very young cub near Lake  Winnepeg, and carried it home with him. It was fed and brought up in the  house of the boy's father, and became as tame as a dog. At length, it  learned to follow the boy to school, and by degrees, it became his daily  companion. At first, the other scholars were somewhat shy of Bruin's  acquaintance; but before a great while, it became their constant  play-fellow, and they delighted in sharing with it the little store of  provisions which they brought for their own dinner. However, it wandered  off into the woods again, and for four years, nothing was heard of it.  Changes had taken place in the school where the bear used to be a  welcome guest. Another generation of pupils had taken the place of the  bear's old companions. One very cold winter day, while the schoolmistress  was busy with her lessons, a boy happened to leave the door open, and a  huge bear walked in. The consternation of the mistress and her pupils  was very great, of course. But what could they do? Nothing but look on,  and see what would come of this strange visit. However, the bear  molested no one. It walked quietly up to the fire, and warmed itself.  Then it walked up to the wall, where the dinner baskets hung, and  standing on its hind feet, reached them down, and made free with their  contents. By and by, it went out. But the alarm was given, and the poor  fellow was shot, when it was found out, by some marks on its body, that  it was the identical bear that had used to visit the school four years  before.    In one of the expeditions from England to the Polar seas, a white bear  was seen to perform an ingenious feat in order to capture some walruses.  He was seen to swim cautiously to a large, rough piece of ice, on which  these walruses were lying, fast asleep, with their cubs. The wily animal  crept up some little hillocks of ice, behind the party, and with his  fore feet loosened a large block of ice. This, with the help of his nose  and paws, he rolled along until he was near the sleepers, and almost  over their heads, when he let it fall on one of the old walruses, who  was instantly killed. The other walrus, with her cubs, rolled into the  water; but the young one of the dead animal remained with its mother. On  this helpless creature the bear then leaped down, and completed the  destruction of two animals which it would not have ventured to attack  openly.    It often happens, that when a Greenlander and his wife are paddling  along out at sea, by coming too near a floating field of ice, a white  bear unexpectedly jumps into their canoe. Provided he does not upset it  by the weight of his body, he sits calmly and demurely in one end of it,  like any other passenger, and allows himself to be rowed to the shore.  The Greenlander would very cheerfully dispense with the company of the  bear; but dares not dispute his right there--it might cost him a pretty  rough handling. So he makes a virtue of necessity, and rows his bearship  to the shore.    In the early part of the settlement of this country, an expedition was  sent to explore a part of the territory now called Missouri. Bears were  found there, at that time, in great abundance, and of very large size.  Some of the men belonging to the expedition were in a canoe one day,  when they discovered a bear lying in the open grounds, about three  hundred paces from the river. Six of the men, all good hunters,  immediately went to attack him, and concealing themselves by a small  eminence, came within forty paces of him before they were perceived.  Four of the hunters now fired, as nearly as they could at the same  instant, and each lodged a ball in his body, two of which entered the  lungs. The furious animal then sprang up, and ran upon the men, with his  mouth wide open, ready for a terrible attack. As he came near, the two  hunters who had reserved their fire gave him two rounds, one of which,  breaking his shoulder, retarded his progress for a moment; but before  they could reload, he was so near that they were obliged to run to the  river. Before they reached it, he had almost overtaken them. Two jumped  into the canoe; the other four separated, and concealing themselves  among the willows, fired as fast as they could reload. They hit him  several times; but instead of weakening the monster, each shot only  seemed to direct him toward the hunters, till at last he pursued two of  them so closely, that they threw aside their guns and pouches, and  jumped down a perpendicular bank of some fifteen feet into the river.  The bear sprang after them, and was within a few feet of the hindermost,  when one of the hunters on the shore shot him in the head, and finally  killed him. They dragged him to the shore, and found that eight balls  had passed through him, in different directions.    While a British frigate was locked in the ice of the Polar seas, three  bears were discovered one morning, directing their course toward the  ship. They had undoubtedly been attracted by the scent of a part of the  carcass of a sea-horse that the crew had killed a few days before, which  had been set on fire, and was burning on the ice at the time of their  approach. They proved to be a female bear and her two cubs; but the cubs  were nearly as large as the mother. They ran eagerly to the fire, and  drew out of the flames a part of the flesh of the sea-horse which  remained unconsumed, and ate it voraciously. Some of the crew threw  large pieces of the flesh from the ship upon the ice, which the old bear  took, one by one, and laid before her cubs. Then she divided each piece,  and reserved only a very small portion for herself. As she was carrying  away the last piece, several of the men on board the ship aimed their  muskets at the two cubs, and shot them dead; after which they shot at  the old bear, and wounded her, though not mortally. One of the gentlemen  who witnessed this spectacle says that it would have drawn pity from any  but the most unfeeling hearts, to mark the affectionate concern  expressed by this poor beast, as she saw that her young were dying.  Though she was sorely wounded herself, and could but just crawl to the  place where they lay, she carried the last piece of flesh to them, as  she had done with the others, and divided it for them. When she  perceived that they refused to eat, she put her paws first upon one and  then upon the other, and endeavored to raise them up. All this time it  was deeply affecting to hear her moans. When she found she could not  stir her dying cubs in this manner, she went away some distance from  them, looking back occasionally, and moaning, as if in the utmost  distress. This means not availing to entice them away from the spot, she  returned, and commenced smelling around them, and licking their wounds.  Then she went off a second time, as before, and having crawled a few  paces, looked again behind her, and for some time stood still, uttering  the most piteous cries. But still her cubs did not rise to follow her,  and she returned to them, and with signs of the greatest fondness, went  around them separately, placing her paws upon them tenderly, and giving  utterance to the same cries of distress. Finding, at last, that they  were cold and lifeless, she raised her head toward the ship, and growled  in indignation for the murder. Poor creature! the men on board returned  her angry cry with a shower of musket balls. She fell between her cubs,  and died licking their wounds.    Hans Christian Andersen, in his \"Picture Book without Pictures,\" relates  an anecdote, in his droll way, about a tame bear, who got loose, when  the man who was exhibiting him was at dinner, and who found his way into  the public house, and went straight to a room where there were three  children, the eldest of whom was only some six or eight years old. But,  Hans, you may tell the rest of the story in your own peculiar language:  \"The door sprang open, and in stepped the great rough bear! He had grown  tired of standing out there in the yard, and he now found his way up the  steps. The children were very much frightened at the great, grim-looking  beast, and crept each one of them into a corner. But he found them all  out, and rubbed them with his nose. He did them no harm, not the  slightest. 'It is certainly a big dog,' thought they; and so they patted  him kindly. He laid himself down on the floor, and the smallest boy  tumbled over him, and amused himself by hiding his curly head in the  thick black hair of the animal. The eldest boy now took his drum, and  made a tremendous noise; and the bear rose up on his hind legs, and  began to dance. It was charming. Each boy took his weapons--for they had  been playing at soldiers before their visitor"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18779"],[0,"Physiology and Hygiene for Secondary Schools (#15)"],[1,"air while it is in the lungs. Air entering the lungs in ordinary  breathing parts with about five per cent of itself in the form of oxygen  and receives about four and one half per cent of carbon dioxide,  considerable water-vapor, and a small amount of other impurities. These  changes suggest a twofold purpose for respiration:    1. To obtain from the atmosphere the supply of oxygen needed by the body.    2. To transfer to the atmosphere certain materials (wastes) which must be  removed from the body.    The chief organs concerned in the work of respiration are    *The Lungs.*--The lungs consist of two sac-like bodies suspended in the  thoracic cavity, and occupying all the space not taken up by the heart.  They are not simple sacs, however, but are separated into numerous  divisions, as follows:    1. The lung on the right side of the thorax, called the right lung, is  made up of three divisions, or _lobes_, and the left lung is made up of  two lobes.    2. The lobes on either side are separated into smaller divisions, called  _lobules_ (Fig. 33). Each lobule receives a distinct division of an air  tube and has in itself the structure of a miniature lung.                                    [Fig. 33]      Fig. 33--*Lungs and air passages* seen from the front. The right lung shows   the lobes and their divisions, the lobules. The tissue of the left lung                has been dissected away to show the air tubes.      3. In the lobule the air tube divides into a number of smaller tubes, each  ending in a thin-walled sac, called an _infundibulum_. The interior of the  infundibulum is separated into many small spaces, known as the _alveoli_,  or air cells.    The lungs are remarkable for their lightness and delicacy of  structure.(30) They consist chiefly of the tissues that form their sacs,  air tubes, and blood vessels; the membranes that line their inner and  outer surfaces; and the connective tissue that binds these parts together.  All these tissues are more or less elastic. The relation of the different  parts of the lungs to each other and to the outside atmosphere will be  seen through a study of the    *Air Passages.*--The air passages consist of a system of tubes which form a  continuous passageway between the outside atmosphere and the different  divisions of the lungs. The air passes through them as it enters and  leaves the lungs, a fact which accounts for the name.                                    [Fig. 34]       Fig. 34--*Model of section through the head*, showing upper air passages    and other parts. 1. Left nostril. 2. Pharynx. 3. Tongue and cavity of                 mouth. 4. Larynx. 5. Trachea. 6. Esophagus.      The incoming air first enters the _nostrils_. These consist of two narrow  passages lying side by side in the nose, and connecting with the pharynx  behind. The lining of the nostrils, called _mucous membrane_ is quite  thick, and has its surface much extended by reason of being spread over  some thin, scroll-shaped bones that project into the passage. This  membrane is well supplied with blood vessels and secretes a considerable  quantity of liquid. Because of the nature and arrangement of the membrane,  the nostrils are able to _warm_ and _moisten_ the incoming air, and to  _free it from dust particles_, preparing it, in this way, for entrance  into the lungs (Fig. 34).    The nostrils are separated from the mouth by a thin layer of bone, and  back of both the mouth and the nostrils is the pharynx. The _pharynx_ and  the _mouth_ serve as parts of the food canal, as well as air passages, and  are described in connection with the organs of digestion (Chapter X). Air  entering the pharynx, either by the nostrils or by the mouth, passes  through it into the _larynx_. The larynx, being the special organ for the  production of the voice, is described later (Chapter XXI). The entrance  into the larynx is guarded by a movable lid of cartilage, called the  _epiglottis_, which prevents food particles and liquids, on being  swallowed, from passing into the lower air tubes. The relations of the  nostrils, mouth, pharynx, and larynx are shown in Fig. 34.    From the larynx the air enters the _trachea_, or windpipe. This is a  straight and nearly round tube, slightly less than an inch in diameter and  about four and one half inches in length. Its walls contain from sixteen  to twenty C-shaped, cartilaginous rings, one above the other and  encircling the tube. These incomplete rings, with their openings directed  backward, are held in place by thin layers of connective and muscular  tissue. At the lower end the trachea divides into two branches, called the  bronchi, each of which closely resembles it in structure. Each _bronchus_  separates into a number of smaller divisions, called the _bronchial  tubes_, and these in turn divide into still smaller branches, known as the  _lesser bronchial tubes_ (Fig. 33). The lesser bronchial tubes, and the  branches into which they separate, are the smallest of the air tubes. One  of these joins, or expands into, each of the minute lung sacs, or  infundibula. Mucous membrane lines all of the air passages.    *General Condition of the Air Passages.*--One necessary condition for the  movement of the air into and from the lungs is an unobstructed  passageway.(31) The air passages must be kept open and free from  obstructions. They are _kept open_ by special contrivances found in their  walls, which, by supplying a degree of stiffness, cause the tubes to keep  their form. In the trachea, bronchi, and larger bronchial tubes, the  stiffness is supplied by rings of cartilage, while in the smaller tubes  this is replaced by connective and muscular tissue. The walls of the  larynx contain strips and plates of cartilage; while the nostrils and the  pharynx are kept open by their bony surroundings.                                    [Fig. 35]      Fig. 35--*Ciliated epithelial cells.* _A._ Two cells highly magnified. _c._   Cilia, _n._ Nucleus. _B._ Diagram of a small air tube showing the lining                                  of cilia.      The air passages are _kept clean_ by cells especially adapted to this  purpose, known as the _ciliated epithelial cells_. These are slender,  wedge-shaped cells which have projecting from a free end many small,  hair-like bodies, called _cilia_ (Fig. 35). They line the mucous membrane  in most of the air passages, and are so placed that the cilia project into  the tubes. Here they keep up an inward and outward wave-like movement,  which is quicker and has greater force in the _outward_ direction. By this  means the cilia are able to move small pieces of foreign matter, such as  dust particles and bits of partly dried mucus, called phlegm, to places  where they can be easily expelled from the lungs.(32)                                    [Fig. 36]      Fig. 36--*Terminal air sacs.* The two large sacs are infundibula; the small                      divisions are alveoli. (Enlarged.)      *The Alveoli.*--The alveoli, or air cells, are the small divisions of the  infundibula (Fig. 36). They are each about one one-hundredth of an inch  (1/4 mm.) in diameter, being formed by the infolding of the infundibular  wall. This wall, which has for its framework a thin layer of elastic  connective tissue, supports a dense network of capillaries (Fig. 37), and  is lined by a single layer of cells placed edge to edge. By this  arrangement the air within the alveoli is brought very near a large  surface of blood, and the exchange of gases between the air and the blood  is made possible. It is at the alveoli that the oxygen passes from the air  into the blood, and the carbon dioxide passes from the blood into the air.  At no place in the lungs, however, do the air and the blood come in direct  contact. Their exchanges must in all cases take place through the  capillary walls and the layer of cells lining the alveoli.                                    [Fig. 37]      Fig. 37--*Inner lung surface (magnified)*, the blood vessels injected with    coloring matter. The small pits are alveoli, and the vessels in their                        walls are chiefly capillaries.                                      [Fig. 38]      Fig. 38.--*Diagram to show the double movement of air and blood through the  lungs.* The blood leaves the heart by the pulmonary artery and returns by     the pulmonary veins. The air enters and leaves the lungs by the same                               system of tubes.                                      [Fig. 39]       Fig. 39--*Diagram to show air and blood movements in a terminal air sac.*    While the air moves into and from the space within the sac, the blood                      circulates through the sac walls.      *Blood Supply to the Lungs.*--To accomplish the purposes of respiration,  not only the air, but the blood also, must be passed into and from the  lungs. The chief artery conveying blood to the lungs is the _pulmonary  artery_. This starts at the right ventricle and by its branches conveys  blood to the capillaries surrounding the alveoli in all parts of the  lungs. The branches of the pulmonary artery lie alongside of, and divide  similarly to, the bronchial tubes. At the places where the finest  divisions of the air tubes enter the infundibula, the little arteries  branch into the capillaries that penetrate the infundibular walls (Figs.  38 and 39). From these capillaries the blood is conveyed by the pulmonary  veins to the left auricle.    The lungs also receive blood from two (in some individuals three) small  arteries branching from the aorta, known as the _bronchial arteries_.  These convey to the lungs blood that has already been supplied with  oxygen, passing it into the capillaries in the walls of the bronchi,  bronchial tubes, and large blood vessels, as well as the connective tissue  between the lobes of the lungs. This blood leaves the lungs partly by the  bronchial veins and partly by the"]]]
