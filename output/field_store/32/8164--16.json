This could not be prevented  because the existent beings are eaters and eaten and, by this, existence  is caused; otherwise, the relations between existent things would cease.  When a thing decomposes and decays, being bereft of life, it becomes  promoted to a world of life greater than the former. For instance, it  ceased in a mineral life and was promoted to the vegetable life; then  leaves the vegetable life and is elevated to that of the animal; then  leaving the animal life it advances to the human, and this is on account  of the favor of thy Lord, the Merciful, the Clement.    I ask God to strengthen thee in comprehending the mysteries deposited in  the reality of existence, to lift up the veil before thee and thy sister,  so that the concealed mystery and the hidden reality become manifest as  the sun at noon, and to confirm thy sister and thy husband in entering the  Kingdom of God, and heal thee from all physical and spiritual disease in  the world of creation.          \"O thou maid-servant of God!...\"      O thou maid-servant of God!    Thy writing was considered. I ask God that thy mind(43) may be illumined  with the light of knowledge and faith to the extent that thy face will  radiate its glory, even as a light, when set aglow in the lamp, will cast  its rays to the surrounding regions.    I hope that the darkness of evil suggestions shall be dispersed and that  the veil of uncertainty shall be torn asunder; that the beauty of truth  may become manifest with glory and the light of mercy become radiant. Thus  mayest thou, O maid-servant of God, with thy honorable husband and revered  son, become free from the severe trials and appear with grace in the  gatherings of the people of God.    The nineteen-day fast(44) is a duty to be observed by all. All should  abstain from eating and drinking from sunrise to sunset. This fast is  conducive to the spiritual development of the individual. The Greatest  Name should be read every day.          \"O thou lamp ignited by the fire of the Love of God!...\"      O thou lamp ignited by the fire of the Love of God!    I ask God to make thee a sign of love, standard of agreement, means of  union and harmony and spreader of peace among the people.    O maid-servant of God! Strive with all thy powers in diffusing the spirit  of real union among the people, so that all who are on earth become one  family, loving, united, agreed, bound by the bonds of love and united with  all harmony in all things and conditions; this is the greater happiness of  the human race in the world of possibilities and the cause of attaining to  all hopes and reaching unto the Supreme Kingdom, after ascending unto the  world of God.          \"O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!...\"      O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!    Verily, I chanted thy poem. Its significance was beautiful, its  composition eloquent and its words excellent. It was like the melody of  the birds of holiness in the paradise of El-ABHA. The breasts of the  maid-servants of the Merciful were exhilarated by its chanting. Blessed  art thou for uttering forth such an excellent poem and brilliant pearl.    Verily, these verses shall be sung in the divine meetings and in the  assemblages of the spiritual in the course of ages and centuries to come,  for thou hast uttered the praise of thy Lord and expressed significant  meanings in eulogy of thy Lord, the Merciful, the Clement. All poems shall  be forgotten in the course of time save those that are extraordinary; thy  poem shall be chanted with melody and best voices in the Center of Worship  (or Mashrak-el-Azcar) forevermore.          \"O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!...\"      O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!    Verily, I read thy poem, which contained new significances and beautiful  words. My heart was dilated by its eloquent sense. I prayed God to make  thee utter more beautiful compositions that this. Thus thou mayest be the  first to praise the Beauty of El-ABHA and the first utterer of His Name  among the women.    Chant the verses of guidance among the people and commence [the  composition of] melodies of great beauty and effect in praise and  glorification of the Generous Lord.    We sent those poems to all countries, so that the friends of God may  remember thee and pray for confirmation and aid in this great Cause in thy  behalf.    O maid-servant of God! Warble as birds in the garden of joy and pray to  thy forgiving Lord, so that the souls may rejoice through the psalms of  the descendant of David.          \"O maid-servant of God!...\"      O maid-servant of God!    Thy letter reached me and I prayed God to bless thee by His heavenly  blessing in thy marriage with Mr. ........ and to confirm both of you with  comfort and repose and the turning of your heart to the Kingdom of God.  May His divine providence abide with you in all conditions and  circumstances.          \"O thou bird of pleasing tones!...\"      O thou bird of pleasing tones!    Thy little book of poems, which were very sweet, was read. It was a source  of joy, for it was a spiritual anthem and a melody of the love of God.    Continue as long as thou canst this melody in the gatherings of the  beloved; thus may the minds find rest and joy and become in tune with the  love of God. When eloquence of expression, beauty of sense and sweetness  of composition unite with new melodies the effect is very great,  especially if it be the anthem of the verses of oneness and the songs of  praise to the Lord of Glory.    Endeavor your utmost to compose beautiful poems to be chanted with  heavenly music; thus may their beauty affect the minds and impress the  hearts of those who listen.          \"O thou spiritual lad!...\"      O thou spiritual lad!    May God uphold thee and edify thee in the flower of thy youth and in the  spring-time of thy life and may He illumine thy face with the lights of  advancement unto God and turning unto the Kingdom of God. If thou become  firm and steadfast in the love of God, thou shalt be confirmed with a  confirmation whereby thy face will be gladdened, thy heart rejoiced and  all thy family will be happy and pleased. Therefore, confine thy thoughts  and ideas in turning to God and submitting unto Him and chant the signs  (verses) of thanks and praise for that by reason of which He hath  strengthened thee to attain this great gift.          \"O thou daughter of the Kingdom!...\"      O thou daughter of the Kingdom!    Thank and praise God that He hath cause thee to drink from the cup of the  gifts and caused thee to suckle from the bosom of guidance while yet very  young and didst possess but a few years of age. I beg of God and hope that  the love of God may be mingled (and mixed) in thy flesh and bones and run  in thy whole being, like the running (or circulation) of the spirit in the  veins and in the arteries.          \"O thou who art ignited through the brilliant Flame...\"      O thou who art ignited through the brilliant Flame which is blazing in  this Blessed Spot!    Verily, I considered the meanings of thy letter and my heart overflows  with perfect and spiritual love unto thee and unto the beloved ones of  God, whose eyes are brightened by witnessing the lights of God and whose  innermost hearts are purified by the love of God and whose consciences are  made clear by the knowledge of God and whose hearts are tranquilized by  the commemoration of God. Theirs is the treasury of the Kingdom and the  abundant wealth of the storehouse of the divine world! They are wealthy,  not poor; they are powerful, not weak; they are grandees, not mean  persons; and they are kindred, not strangers! Because, verily, their  wealth and honor is divine and supreme and will never be consumed. Blessed  are they! Glad-tidings be unto them!    As to those souls who are preaching the Word of God, it behooveth them to  shake the dust of every land which they have passed by off their shoes and  to be with God and without need of the rich--although their bed is the  soil, their light is the stars of the sky and their food is the herbs of  the desert--because theirs is the wealth of the Kingdom, the honor of the  realm of might and the bounty of the divine world; and they are not in  want of this world and its cares. Their throne is the mat of humility,  their honor is in suffering every lowliness in the path of the Loving Lord  and their wealth is being empty-handed from the pomps of the world and its  vanities and their provision is trusting in God and being severed from all  that is on the earth and its wealth.    As to thee: Associate thou with the poor and be united with the weak souls  and hold intercourse with the needy, with a compassionate heart and great  love. Because thereby is ordained for thee an eternal glory in the Kingdom  of God. Invite thou the people to the Exalted World, to the Supreme  Horizon and to the Kingdom of El-ABHA!    There is no harm in thy loneliness in those regions; for verily, the hosts  of confirmation are thy help, thy Glorious Lord is thy protector and the  angels of the Kingdom are thy fellow-speakers. Glad-tidings be unto thee  for this! Blessed art thou for this!          \"***O maid-servant of God!...\"      ***O maid-servant of God!    If thou seekest eternal glory, let thyself be humble and meek in the  presence of the beloved of God; make thyself the servant of all, and serve  all alike. The service of the friends belongs to God, not to them. Strive  to become a source of harmony, spirituality and joyfulness to the hearts  of the friends and the maid-servants of the Merciful. This is a cause of  great satisfaction to Abdul-Baha.***          \"O thou leaf who art well watered through the out-p"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19317"],[0,"Gallipoli Diary,  Volume 1 (#15)"],[1," of our being here is to work hand-in-glove  with the Fleet. We are here to help get the Fleet through the  Dardanelles in the first instance and to help the Russians to take  Constantinople in the second. The War Office, the Admiralty, the  Vice-Admiral and the French Commander-in-Chief all agree now that the  Peninsula is the best place for our first step towards these objects.    Hunter-Weston's appreciation, written on his way out at Malta, is a  masterly piece of work. He understands clearly that our true objective  is to let our warships through the Narrows to attack Constantinople.  \"The immediate object,\" he says, \"of operations in the Dardanelles is to  enable our warships, with the necessary colliers and other unarmoured  supply ships--without which capital ships cannot maintain themselves--to  pass through the Straits in order to attack Constantinople.\"    And again:--    \"It is evident that land operations at this stage must be directed  entirely towards assisting the Fleet; and no operations should be  commenced unless it is clear that their result will be to enable our  warships, with their necessary colliers, etc., to have the use of the  Straits.\"    The Fleet, he holds, cannot do this without our help because of:--      (1). Improvement of the defences.    (2). The mobile howitzers.    (3). The Leon floating mines.    Things being so, he sets himself to consider how far the Army can help,  in the light of the following premises:--    \"The Turkish Army having been warned by our early bombardments and by  the landings carried out some time ago, has concentrated a large force  in and near the Gallipoli Peninsula.\"    \"It has converted the Peninsula into an entrenched camp, has, under  German direction, made several lines of entrenchments covering the  landing places, with concealed machine gun emplacements and land mines  on the beach; and has put in concealed positions guns and howitzers  capable of covering the landing places and approaches with their fire.\"    \"The Turkish Army in the Peninsula is being supplied and reinforced from  the Asiatic side and from the Sea of Marmora and is not dependent on the  Isthmus of Bulair. The passage of the Isthmus of Bulair by troops and  supplies at night cannot be denied by the guns of our Fleet.\"    After estimates of our forces and of the difficulties they may expect to  encounter, Hunter-Weston comes to the conclusion that, \"the only landing  places worth serious consideration are:      \"(1). Those near Cape Suvla,     (2). Those near Cape Helles.\"    Of these two he advises Helles, because:--\"the Fleet can also surround  this end of the Peninsula and bring a concentrated fire on any Turks  holding it. We, therefore, should be able to make sure of securing the  Achi Baba position.\" Also, because our force is too weak to hold the big  country round Suvla Bay and at the same time operate against Kilid Bahr.    If this landing at Helles is successful, he considers the probable  further course of the operations. Broadly, he thinks that we are so  short of ammunition and particularly of high explosive shell that there  is every prospect of our getting tied up on an extended line across the  Peninsula in front of the Kilid Bahr trenches. Should the enemy  submarines arrive we should be \"up a tree.\"    The cards in the game of life are the characters of men. Staking on  those cards I take my own opinions--always. But when we play the game of  death, things are our counters--guns, rivers, shells, bread, roads,  forests, ships--and in totting up the values of these my friend  Hunter-Weston has very few equals in the Army.    Therefore, his conclusion depresses me very much, but not so much as it  would have done had I not seen him. For certainly during his conference  on the 30th March with d'Amade and myself he never said or implied in  any way that under conditions as he found them and as they were then set  before him, there was no reasonable prospect of success:--quite the  contrary. Here are the conclusions as written at Malta:--    \"Conclusion. The information available goes to show that if this  Expedition had been carefully and secretly prepared in England, France  and Egypt, and the Naval and Military details of organisation, equipment  and disembarkation carefully worked out by the General Staff and the  Naval War Staff, and if no bombardment or other warning had been given  till the troops, landing gear, etc., were all ready and despatched, (the  troops from England ostensibly for service in Egypt and those in Egypt  ostensibly for service in France) the capture of the Gallipoli  Peninsula and the forcing of the Dardanelles would have been successful.    \"Von der Goltz is reported to have visited the Dardanelles on 11th  February and before that date it appears that very little had been done.    \"Now big guns have been brought from Chatalja, Adrianople and  elsewhere,--roads have been made,--heavy movable armaments  provided,--troops and machine guns have been poured into the  Peninsula,--several lines of trenches have been dug,--every landing  place has been trenched and mined, and all that clever German Officers  under Von der Goltz can design, and hard working diggers like the Turks  can carry out, has been done to make the Peninsula impregnable.    \"The prizes of success in this Expedition are very great.    \"It was indeed the most hopeful method of finishing the war.    \"No loss would be too heavy and no risks too great if thereby success  would be attained.    \"But if the views expressed in this paper be sound, there is not in  present circumstances a reasonable chance of success. (The views are  founded on the information available to the writer at the time of  leaving Malta, and may be modified by further information at first hand  on arrival at Force Head Quarters.)    \"The return of the Expedition when it has gone so far will cause  discontent, much talk, and some laughter; will confirm Roumania and  Greece in the wisdom of their neutrality, and will impair the power of  our valuable friend M. Venezelos. It will be a heavy blow to all of us  soldiers, and will need great strength and moral courage on the part of  the Commander and Government.    \"But it will not do irreparable harm to our cause, whereas to attempt a  landing and fail to secure a passage through the Dardanelles would be a  disaster to the Empire.    \"The threat of invasion by the Allies is evidently having considerable  effect on the Balkan States.    \"It is therefore advisable to continue our preparations;--to train our  troops for landing, and to get our expedition properly equipped and  organised for this difficult operation of war; so as to be ready to take  advantage of any opportunity for successful action that may occur.    \"But I would repeat; no action should be taken unless it has been  carefully thought out in all its possibilities and details and unless  there is a reasonable _probability_ of success.                                                  \"A. HUNTER-WESTON, M.G.\"    Paris's appreciation gives no very clear lead. \"The enemy is of strength  unknown,\" he says, \"but within striking distance there must be 250,000.\"  He also lays stress on the point that the enemy are expecting  us--\"Surprise is now impossible--.... The difficulties are now increased  a hundredfold.... To land would be difficult enough if surprise was  possible but hazardous in the extreme under present conditions.\" He  discusses Gaba Tepe as a landing place; also Smyrna, and Bulair. On the  whole, he favours Sedd-el-Bahr as it \"is the only place where transports  could come in close and where the actual landing may be unopposed. It is  open to question whether a landing could be effected elsewhere. With the  aid of the Fleet it may be possible to land near Cape Helles almost  unopposed and an advance of ten miles would enormously facilitate the  landing of the remainder South of Gaba Tepe.\"    The truth is, every one of these fellows agrees in his heart with old  Von der Goltz, the Berlin experts, and the Sultan of Egypt that the  landing is impossible. Well, we shall see, D.V., we shall see!! One  thing is certain: we must work up our preparations to the _n_th degree  of perfection: the impossible can only be overborne by the  unprecedented; i.e., by an original method or idea.    _10th April, 1915. S.S. \"Arcadian.\" Lemnos._ Cast anchor at 7 a.m. After  breakfast went on board the _Queen Elizabeth_ where Braithwaite and I  worked for three hours with Admiral de Robeck, Admiral Wemyss and  Commodore Roger Keyes.    Last time the Admiral made the running; to-day it was my turn for I had  to unfold my scheme and go through it point by point with the sailors.  But first I felt it my duty to read out the appreciations of  Hunter-Weston, Birdwood and Paris. Then I gave them my own view that  history had never offered any nation so clean cut a chance of bringing  off an immeasurably big coup as she had done by putting our Fleet and  Army precisely where it was at present on the map of the war world. Half  that unique chance had already been muddled away by the lack of secrecy  and swiftness in our methods. With check mate within our grasp we had  given two moves to the enemy. Still, perhaps; nay, probably, there was  time. Were we to prolong hesitation, or, were we, now that we had done  the best we could with the means under our hands, to go boldly forward?  Here was the great issue: there was no use discussing detail until the  principle was settled. By God's mercy the Vice-Admiral, Wemyss and Keyes  were all quite clear and quite determined. They rejected Bulair; they  rejected Asia; most of all they spurned the thought of further delay or  of hanging about hoping for something to turn up.    So I then told them my plan. The more, I said, I had pondered over the  map and reflected upon the character, probable numbers and supposed  positions of the enemy, the more convinced I had become that"]]]
