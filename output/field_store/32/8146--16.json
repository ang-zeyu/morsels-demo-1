What few words I knew were rarely  intelligible; but, as Mrs. General Baynes, when staying at Boulogne,  found Hindostanee to be of great help in speaking French, so did I  discover that English was of great assistance to me in conversing in  Chinese. Remonstrance was thus made much more effective. Whenever I was  in a difficulty, or the crowd too obtrusive, I had only to say a few  grave sentences in English, and I was master of the situation. This  method of speaking often reminded me of that employed by a Cornish lady  of high family whose husband was a colleague of mine in Spain. She had  been many years in Andalusia, but had never succeeded in mastering  Spanish. At a dinner party given by this lady, at which I was present,  she thus addressed her Spanish servant, who did not \"possess\" a single  word of English: \"Bring me,\" she said in an angry aside, \"bring me the  _cuchillo_ with the black-handled heft,\" adding, as she turned to us and  thumped her fist on the table, while the servant stood still mystified,  \"D---- the language! I wish I had never learnt it.\"    The inn, where the sedan left me, was built over the pathway, which was  here a narrow track, two feet six inches wide. Mountain coolies on the  road were passing in single file through the inn, their backs bending  under their huge burdens. Pigs and fowls and dogs, and a stray cat, were  foraging for crumbs under the table. Through the open doorways you saw  the paddy-fields under water and the terraced hills, with every arable  yard under cultivation. The air was hot and enervating. \"The country of  the clouds,\" as the Chinese term the province of Szechuen, does not  belie its name. An elderly woman was in charge of the oven, and toddled  about on her deformed feet as if she were walking on her heels. Her  husband, the innkeeper, brought us hot water every few minutes to keep  our tea basins full. \"_Na kaishui lai_\" (bring hot water), you heard on  all sides. A heap of bedding was in one corner of the room, in another  were a number of rolls of straw mattresses; a hollow joint of bamboo was  filled with chopsticks for the common use, into another bamboo the  innkeeper slipped his takings of copper cash. Hanging from the rafters  were strings of straw sandals for the poor, and hemp sandals for moneyed  wayfarers like the writer. The people who stood round, and those seated  at the tables, were friendly and respectful, and plied my men with  questions concerning their master. And I did hope that the convert was  not tempted to backslide and swerve from the truth in his answers.    My men were now anxious to push on. Over a mountainous country of  surpassing beauty, I continued my journey on foot to Fan-yien-tsen, and  rested there for the night, having done two days' journey in one.    On March 24th we were all day toiling over the mountains, climbing and  descending wooded steeps, through groves of pine, with an ever-changing  landscape before us, beautiful with running water, with cascades and  waterfalls tumbling down into the river, with magnificent glens and  gorges, and picturesque temples on the mountain tops. At night we were  at the village of Tanto, on the river, having crossed, a few li before,  over the boundary which separates the province of Szechuen from the  province of Yunnan.    From Tanto the path up the gorges leads across a rocky mountain creek  in a defile of the mountains. In England this creek would be spanned by  a bridge; but the poor heathen, in China, how do they find their way  across the stream? By a bridge also. They have spanned the torrent with  a powerful iron suspension bridge, 100 feet long by ten feet broad,  swung between two massive buttresses and approached under handsome  temple-archways.    Mists clothe the mountains--the air is confined between these walls of  rock and stone. Population is scanty, but there is cultivation wherever  possible. Villages sparsely distributed along the mountain path have  water trained to them in bamboo conduits from tarns on the hillside.  Each house has its own supply, and there is no attempt to provide for  the common good. Besides other reasons, it would interfere with the  trade of the water-carriers, who all day long are toiling up from the  river.    The mountain slope does not permit a greater width of building space  than on each side of the one main street. And on market days this street  is almost impassable, being thronged with traffickers, and blocked with  stalls and wares. Coal is for sale, both pure and mixed with clay in  briquettes, and salt in blocks almost as black as coal, and three times  as heavy, and piles of drugs--a medley of bones, horns, roots, leaves,  and minerals--and raw cotton and cotton yarn from Wuchang and Bombay,  and finished goods from Manchester. At one of the villages there was a  chair for hire, and, knowing how difficult was the country, I was  willing to pay the amount asked--namely, _7d._ for nearly seven miles;  but my friend the convert, who arranged these things, considered that  between the _5d._ he offered and the _7d._ they asked the discrepancy  was too great, and after some acrimonious bargaining it was decided  that I should continue on foot, my man indicating to me by gestures, in  a most sarcastic way, that the \"_chiaodza_\" men had failed to overreach  him.    [Illustration: A TEMPLE IN SZECHUEN.]    [Illustration: LAOWATAN.]    At Sengki-ping it rained all through the night, and I had to sleep under  my umbrella because of a solution in the continuity of the roof  immediately above my pillow. And it rained all the day following; but my  men, eager to earn their reward of one shilling, pushed on through the  slush. It was hard work following the slippery path above the river. Few  rivers in the world flow between more majestic banks than these,  towering as they do a thousand feet above the water. Clad with thick  mountain scrub, that has firm foothold, the mountains offer but a poor  harvest to the peasant; yet even here high up on the precipitous sides  of the cliffs, ledges that seem inaccessible are sown with wheat or  peas, and, if the soil be deep enough, with the baneful poppy. As we  plodded on through the mud and rain, we overtook a poor lad painfully  limping along with the help of a stick. He was a bright lad, who unbound  his leg and showed me a large swelling above the knee. He spoke to me,  though I did not understand him, but with sturdy independence did not  ask for alms, and when I had seen his leg he bound it up again and  limped on. Meeting him a little later at an inn, where he was sitting at  a table with nothing before him to eat, I gave him a handful of cash  which I had put in my pocket for him. He thanked me by raising his  clasped hands, and said something, I knew not what, as I hurried on. A  little while afterwards I stopped to have my breakfast, when the boy  passed. As soon as he saw me he fell down upon his knees and \"kotow'd\"  to me, with every mark of the liveliest gratitude. I felt touched by the  poor fellow's gratitude--he could not have been more than fifteen--and  mean, to think that the benefaction, which in his eyes appeared so  generous, was little more than one penny. There can be no doubt that I  gained merit by this action, for this very afternoon as I was on the  track a large stone the size of a shell from a 50-ton gun fell from the  crag above me, struck the rock within two paces of me, and shot past  into the river. A few feet nearer and it would have blotted out the life  of one whom the profession could ill spare. We camped at Laowatan.    A chair with three bearers was waiting for me in the morning, so that I  left the town of Laowatan in a manner befitting my rank. The town had  risen to see me leave, and I went down the street amid serried ranks of  spectators. We crossed the river by a wonderful suspension bridge, 250  feet long and 12 feet broad, formed of linked bars of wrought iron. It  shows stability, strength, and delicacy of design, and is a remarkable  work to have been done by the untutored barbarians of this land of  night. We ascended the steep incline opposite, and passed the likin  barrier, but at a turn in the road, higher still in the mountain, a  woman emerged from her cottage and blocked our path. Nor could the chair  pass till my foremost bearer had reluctantly given her a string of cash.  \"With money you can move the gods,\" say the Chinese; \"without it you  can't move a man.\"    For miles we mounted upwards. We were now in Yunnan, \"south of the  clouds\"--in Szechuen we were always under the clouds--the sun was warm,  the air dry and crisp. Ponies passed us in long droves; often there were  eighty ponies in a single drove. All were heavily laden with copper and  lead, were nozzled to keep them off the grass, and picked their way down  the rocky path of steps with the agility and sureness of foot of  mountain goats. Time was beaten for them on musical gongs, and the  echoes rang among the mountains. Many were decorated with red flags and  tufts, and with plumes of the Amherst pheasant. These were official pack  animals, which were franked through the likin barriers without  examination.    The path, rising to the height of the watershed, where at a great  elevation we gain a distant view of water, descends by the counterslope  once more to the river Laowatan. A wonderful ravine, a mountain riven  perpendicularly in twain, here gives passage to the river, and in full  view of this we rested at the little town of Taoshakwan, with the roar  of the river hundreds of feet below us. Midway up the face of the  precipice opposite there is a sight worth seeing; a mass of coffin  boards, caught in a fault in the precipice, have been lying there for  untold generations, having been originally carried there by the \"ancient  flying-men who are now extinct.\"    A"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19180"],[0,"Scientific  American, Volume XXIV., No. 12,  March 18, 1871 (#15)"],[1,"of scientific interest. Moreover,  the circumstances under which the trials were respectively performed,  render the comparison difficult, if not unfair.    Mr. Lee concludes his report with a thorough endorsement of the theory  of Mr. Porter upon the action of the reciprocating parts of engines,  as set forth by the last named gentleman in recent articles in this  journal. He says:    \"Under the resistance of 128.375 horse powers at the brake, the motion  of the engine was remarkably uniform; not the least diminution of  speed in passing the centers could be detected, illustrating very  satisfactorily the value, in this respect, of the speed employed, and  of the action of the reciprocating parts of the engine in equalizing  the rotative pressure on the crank through the stroke. The governor  was, during the trials and through the exhibition, nearly motionless,  while the load remained constant, and instantaneous in its action on  changes of resistance, maintaining a steadiness of running which left  nothing to be desired.\"    The judges--Prof. F. A. P. Barnard, Thos. J. Sloan, and Robert  Weir--speak in their report as follows:    \"The performance of this engine has exceeded that of the two fine  engines which were on trial here last year. The results seem to be  without precedent in such engines. The engine ran from 11 to 12  hours repeatedly without showing a sign of a warm bearing, displaying  thorough perfection in all its parts. In all respects the engine is  first-class, and from the fact of its presenting weight with speed, as  a requisite for perfection in steam engines, it has opened a new era  in this necessary branch--its economy having been clearly demonstrated  in the careful trials, which ought to be published in full.\"           *       *       *       *       *          LYCEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.      There was an unusually large attendance of members at the meeting of  the Lyceum of Natural History, on Monday evening, the 6th inst.,  to listen to an address by Professor B. Waterhouse Hawkins, on the  progress of the work of the restoration of the forms of extinct  animals in the Central Park. Mr. Hawkins gave an account of the  difficulties he encountered at the outset, in finding any skeletons  of animals in New York, with which to make comparisons, and he was  finally compelled to go to Boston and Philadelphia for this purpose.  After much study and many delays, the casts of the _Hadrosaurus_ were  completed, and numerous smaller skeletons prepared. At this stage of  the proceedings an entire change in the administration of the Park  took place, and the newly appointed Commissioners decided to suspend  the work upon the Palaeozoic Museum, and they dismissed Mr. Hawkins  from their service.    The announcement that an end had thus been summarily put to one of the  most important educational projects ever started in this country, was  received by the Lyceum with profound surprise. For a few minutes after  the close of Mr. Hawkins' report, no one felt disposed to make any  comment, but as the truth of the great damage became apparent, there  was considerable disposition manifested to have the Society give  expression to its sense of the value of Mr. Hawkins' services in the  cause of education, and their regret that so important a work should  be suspended at this critical period. Remarks were made by Dr.  Newbery, Professor Joy, Mr. Andrew H. Green, Professor Seely, Dr.  Walz, Mr. E. G. Squier, and others, and the following resolutions were  unanimously adopted:      _Resolved_, That the Lyceum of Natural History, in the city of New    York, has learned with deep regret of the temporary suspension    of the work of restoration of the forms of extinct animals,    as hitherto prosecuted in the Central Park, under the able    superintendence of Professor Waterhouse Hawkins.      _Resolved_, That the Society considers the proposed palaeozoic    museum not only a valuable acquisition to the scientific treasures    and resources of the city, but also as a most important adjunct    and complement to our great system of public education.           *       *       *       *       *          WARMING AND VENTILATION OF RAILROAD CARS.      There has been enough of denunciation against the present general  method of warming and ventilating railway cars. It produces no effect  on the corporations who could, if they would, adopt appliances that  would not burn people to death in cases of accident, nor regularly and  persistently poison them with bad air.    There is no lack of ways and means; the problem is simple and easily  solved; nay--a not very extensive search through the Patent Office  records will show that it has been solved already; perhaps not in the  most practical and perfect manner, but still solved so well, as, were  it not for corporation cupidity, would greatly add to the comfort and  safety of passengers.    The real problem is how to compel corporations to recognize the  fact that the public has rights they are bound to respect. It is the  disregard of these rights that fills our cars with smoke, dust, and  exhalations, and puts box stoves full of hot coals in the corners,  ready to cook the human stew whenever a frisky car shall take a  notion to turn a somersault. The invention needed is a conscience for  corporations--an invention, by the way, scarcely less difficult  than the one advertised for in our last issue, namely, a plan for  preventing the sale of intoxicating liquors and tobacco in New Jersey.    The _Railroad Gazette_, imitating the English ideal of prolixity in  discussion, for which _Engineering_ has recently patted it on the  back approvingly, treats us, in its issue of February 11th, to a page  article, to be continued, under the title of \"Warming and Ventilation  of Railroad Cars.\" In this article the writer takes the ground that  people in general are ignorant of the effects of pure air, and not  being able to \"see the foulness,\" they \"therefore do not believe  it exists.\" It is quite possible they may not be able to see the  foulness, but if in the majority of railroad cars run in this country,  they are not able to feel it in gritty, grimy accumulations on skin  and linen, and smell it in suffocating stenches which serve, with  sneeze-provoking dust, to stifle anything like comfort, their skin  must be thicker, their linen more neglected, and their noses less  sensitive than those of the majority of fellow travellers it has been  our fortune to be cooped up with for a day's railroad journey.    The _Railroad Gazette_ makes this wholesale charge of ignorance  and insensibility the excuse for an essay on the physiology of  respiration, mostly extracted from Huxley's \"Elementary Lessons in  Physiology,\" and therefore excellent in its way, though having a  somewhat remote bearing upon the subject as announced in the title of  the article. We trust that before this journal concludes its series of  articles thus commenced, it will tell how to breathe into the breasts  of the corporations which choke us in their human packing boxes,  something resembling the soul which they are universally acknowledged  to be destitute of. When this is done, carbonic acid, ammoniacal  smells, organic exhalations, smoke, and dust, will be invited to shun  the interiors of railway cars, and comparative comfort will descend  upon the peregrinating public.           *       *       *       *       *          THE MINERAL RESOURCES OF MISSOURI.      The incalculable wealth, which lies hid in the bosom of Mother Earth,  in our vast possessions of the West, is undoubtedly centered in the  State of Missouri; and the development of this fund of riches must  add to the national prosperity, not only by its immeasurable intrinsic  value, but by its affording occupation to armies of laborers, the  latter being the highest and most important consideration.    In 1852-3, a geological survey of the State was wisely decided upon,  and a liberal provision for its execution made. Two valuable reports,  by Professor Swallow, have been printed, in the year 1855, but the  notes of his subsequent investigations have not been made public.    In the session of 1869-70, further action, in this important public  work, was taken by the State legislature, and arrangements made for a  still more accurate and detailed examination, under the direction of  Professor A. D. Hager, of Vermont.    The distribution of metals all over the State will be seen in the  following figures, taken from the St. Louis _Journal of Commerce_,  which show the number of counties in which the various ores are found:  Iron in 46 counties, lead in 43, coal in 36, copper in 24, marble in  11, zinc in 27, fire clay in 16, barytes in 10, nickel in 6, granite  in 4, tin in 4, plumbago in 2, gypsum in 2, alum in 1, antimony in 4.    There is probably no country in the world so endowed as this. Of iron  alone, according to the State geologist's report for 1855, there is  ore of the best quality, sufficient to furnish 200,000,000 tuns of  iron; and this quantity lies in a small space, in the vicinity of  Pilot Knob and Iron Mountain, and within 100 miles of St. Louis.    The quality of the iron is highly spoken of by the manufacturers, and  the capacity of the smelting appliances has reached to over 150,000  tuns per annum. The coal is well suited for reduction of ores,  either by hot or cold blast treatment. The Scotia Iron Co. commenced  operations in January, 1870; and, although the materials for building  blast furnaces had to be carried 80 miles into a desert, the first  furnace was blown into blast in August, 1870. This furnace will run  about 24 tuns per day. The company procures ore from a hill, near the  furnace, in which there is an apparently inexhaustible supply of red  oxide and brown specular. This ore yields 60 per cent of pure metal.  The erection of mills for making wrought iron is contemplated, and the  high quality and"]]]
