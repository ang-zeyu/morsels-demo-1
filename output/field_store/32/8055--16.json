L'Olonnois was now the possessor of a fine vessel which had not been in  the least injured during the battle in which it had been won. But his  little crew, some of whom had been killed and wounded, was insufficient  to work such a ship upon an important cruise on the high seas, and he  also discovered, much to his surprise, that there were very few  provisions on board, for when the vessel was sent from Havana it was  supposed she would make but a very short cruise. This savage swinger of  the cutlass thereupon concluded that he would not try to do any great  thing for the present, but, having obtained some booty and men from the  woe-begone town of de los Cayos, he sailed away, touching at several  other small ports for the purpose of pillage, and finally anchoring at  Tortuga.          Chapter XIV    Villany on a Grand Scale      When L'Olonnois landed on the disreputable shores of Tortuga, he was  received by all circles of the vicious society of the island with loud  acclamation. He had not only taken a fine Spanish ship, he had not only  bearded the Governor of Havana in his fortified den, but he had struck  off ninety heads with his own hand. Even people who did not care for him  before reverenced him now. In all the annals of piracy no hero had ever  done such a deed as this, and the best records of human butchering had  been broken.    Now grand and ambitious ideas began to swell the head of this champion  slaughterer, and he conceived the plan of getting up a grand expedition  to go forth and capture the important town of Maracaibo, in New  Venezuela. This was an enterprise far above the ordinary aims of a  buccaneer, and it would require more than ordinary force to accomplish  it. He therefore set himself to work to enlist a large number of men and  to equip a fleet of vessels, of which he was to be chief commander or  admiral. There were a great many unemployed pirates in Tortuga at that  time, and many a brawny rascal volunteered to sail under the flag of the  daring butcher of the seas.    But in order to equip a fleet, money was necessary as well as men,  and therefore L'Olonnois thought himself very lucky when he succeeded  in interesting the principal piratical capitalist of Tortuga in his  undertaking. This was an old and seasoned buccaneer by the name of  Michael de Basco, who had made money enough by his piratical exploits  to retire from business and live on his income. He held the position  of Mayor of the island and was an important man among his  fellow-miscreants. When de Basco heard of the great expedition which  L'Olonnois was about to undertake, his whole soul was fired and he could  not rest tamely in his comfortable quarters when such great things were  to be done, and he offered to assist L'Olonnois with funds and join in  the expedition if he were made commander of the land forces. This offer  was accepted gladly, for de Basco had a great reputation as a fighter in  Europe as well as in America.    When everything had been made ready, L'Olonnois set sail for Maracaibo  with a fleet of eight ships. On the way they captured two Spanish  vessels, both of which were rich prizes, and at last they arrived  before the town which they intended to capture.    Maracaibo was a prosperous place of three or four thousand inhabitants;  they were rich people living in fine houses, and many of them had  plantations which extended out into the country. In every way the town  possessed great attractions to piratical marauders, but there were  difficulties in the way; being such an important place, of course it had  important defences. On an island in the harbor there was a strong fort,  or castle, and on another island a little further from the town there  was a tall tower, on the top of which a sentinel was posted night and  day to give notice of any approaching enemy. Between these two islands  was the only channel by which the town could be approached from the sea.  But in preparing these defences the authorities had thought only of  defending themselves against ordinary naval forces and had not  anticipated the extraordinary naval methods of the buccaneers who used  to be merely sea-robbers, who fell upon ships after they had left their  ports, but who now set out to capture not only ships at sea but towns on  land.    L'Olonnois had too much sense to run his ships close under the guns of  the fortress, against which he could expect to do nothing, for the  buccaneers relied but little upon their cannon, and so they paid no  more attention to the ordinary harbor than if it had not been there, but  sailed into a fresh-water lake at some distance from the town, and out  of sight of the tower. There L'Olonnois landed his men, and, advancing  upon the fort from the rear, easily crossed over to the little island  and marched upon the fort. It was very early in the morning. The  garrison was utterly amazed by this attack from land, and although they  fought bravely for three hours, they were obliged to give up the defence  of the walls, and as many of them as could do so got out of the fort and  escaped to the mainland and the town.    L'Olonnois now took possession of the fort, and then, with the greater  part of his men, he returned to his ships, brought them around to the  entrance of the bay, and then boldly sailed with his whole fleet under  the very noses of the cannon and anchored in the harbor in front of the  town.    When the citizens of Maracaibo heard from the escaping garrison that the  fort had been taken, they were filled with horror and dismay, for they  had no further means of defence. They knew that the pirates had come  there for no other object than to rob, pillage, and cruelly treat them,  and consequently as many as possible hurried away into the woods and the  surrounding country with as many of their valuables as they could carry.  They resembled the citizens of a town attacked by the cholera or the  plague, and in fact, they would have preferred a most terrible  pestilence to this terrible scourge of piracy from which they were about  to suffer.    As soon as L'Olonnois and his wild pirates had landed in the city they  devoted themselves entirely to eating and drinking and making themselves  merry. They had been on short commons during the latter part of their  voyage, and they had a royal time with the abundance of food and wine  which they found in the houses of the town. The next day, however, they  set about attending to the business which had brought them there, and  parties of pirates were sent out into the surrounding country to find  the people who had run away and to take from them the treasures they had  carried off. But although a great many of the poor, miserable,  unfortunate citizens were captured and brought back to the town, there  was found upon them very little money, and but few jewels or ornaments  of value. And now L'Olonnois began to prove how much worse his presence  was than any other misfortune which could have happened to the town. He  tortured the poor prisoners, men, women, and children, to make them tell  where they had hidden their treasures, sometimes hacking one of them  with his sword, declaring at the same time that if he did not tell where  his money was hidden he would immediately set to work to cut up his  family and his friends.    The cruelties inflicted upon the inhabitants by this vile and beastly  pirate and his men were so horrible that they could not be put into  print. Even John Esquemeling, who wrote the account of it, had not the  heart to tell everything that had happened. But after two weeks of  horror and torture, the pirates were able to get but comparatively  little out of the town, and they therefore determined to go somewhere  else, where they might do better.    At the southern end of Lake Maracaibo, about forty leagues from the town  which the pirates had just desolated and ruined, lay Gibraltar, a  good-sized and prosperous town, and for this place L'Olonnois and his  fleet now set sail; but they were not able to approach unsuspected and  unseen, for news of their terrible doings had gone before them, and  their coming was expected. When they drew near the town they saw the  flag flying from the fort, and they knew that every preparation had been  made for defence. To attack such a place as this was a rash undertaking;  the Spaniards had perhaps a thousand soldiers, and the pirates numbered  but three hundred and eighty, but L'Olonnois did not hesitate. As usual,  he had no thought of bombardment, or any ordinary method of naval  warfare; but at the first convenient spot he landed all his men, and  having drawn them up in a body, he made them an address. He made them  understand clearly the difficult piece of work which was before them;  but he assured them that pirates were so much in the habit of conquering  Spaniards that if they would all promise to follow him and do their  best, he was certain he could take the town. He assured them that it  would be an ignoble thing to give up such a grand enterprise as this  simply because they found the enemy strong and so well prepared to meet  them, and ended by stating that if he saw a man flinch or hold back for  a second, he would pistol him with his own hand. Whereupon the pirates  all shook hands and promised they would follow L'Olonnois wherever he  might lead them.    This they truly did, and L'Olonnois, having a very imperfect knowledge  of the proper way to the town, led them into a wild bog, where this  precious pack of rascals soon found themselves up to their knees in mud  and water, and in spite of all the cursing and swearing which they did,  they were not able to press through the bog or get out of it. In this  plight they were discovered by a body of horsemen from the town, who  began firing upon them. The Spaniards must now have thought that their  game was almost bagged and that all they had to do was to stand on "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/172"],[0,"The Haunted Bookshop (#15)"],[1,"get your fur.  Roger,  go and find your cap.  With your bald head, you ought to know better!\"    When they returned to the front door, Titania's blue eyes were  sparkling above her soft tippet.    \"I applaud your taste in furs,\" said Roger.  \"That is just the colour  of tobacco smoke.\"  He blew a whiff against it to prove the likeness.  He felt very talkative, as most older men do when a young girl looks as  delightfully listenable as Titania.    \"What an adorable little place,\" said Titania, looking round at the  bookshop's space of private pavement, which was sunk below the street  level.  \"You could put tables out here and serve tea in summer time.\"    \"The first thing every morning,\" continued Roger, \"I set out the  ten-cent stuff in these boxes.  I take it in at night and stow it in  these bins.  When it rains, I shove out an awning, which is mighty good  business.  Someone is sure to take shelter, and spend the time in  looking over the books.  A really heavy shower is often worth fifty or  sixty cents.  Once a week I change my pavement stock.  This week I've  got mostly fiction out here.  That's the sort of thing that comes in in  unlimited numbers.  A good deal of it's tripe, but it serves its  purpose.\"    \"Aren't they rather dirty?\" said Titania doubtfully, looking at some  little blue Rollo books, on which the siftings of generations had  accumulated.  \"Would you mind if I dusted them off a bit?\"    \"It's almost unheard of in the second-hand trade,\" said Roger; \"but it  might make them look better.\"    Titania ran inside, borrowed a duster from Helen, and began  housecleaning the grimy boxes, while Roger chatted away in high  spirits.  Bock already noticing the new order of things, squatted on  the doorstep with an air of being a party to the conversation.  Morning  pedestrians on Gissing Street passed by, wondering who the bookseller's  engaging assistant might be.  \"I wish _I_ could find a maid like that,\"  thought a prosperous Brooklyn housewife on her way to market.  \"I must  ring her up some day and find out how much she gets.\"    Roger brought out armfuls of books while Titania dusted.    \"One of the reasons I'm awfully glad you've come here to help me,\" he  said, \"is that I'll be able to get out more.  I've been so tied down by  the shop, I haven't had a chance to scout round, buy up libraries, make  bids on collections that are being sold, and all that sort of thing.  My stock is running a bit low.  If you just wait for what comes in, you  don't get much of the really good stuff.\"    Titania was polishing a copy of The Late Mrs. Null.  \"It must be  wonderful to have read so many books,\" she said.  \"I'm afraid I'm not a  very deep reader, but at any rate Dad has taught me a respect for good  books.  He gets so mad because when my friends come to the house, and  he asks them what they've been reading, the only thing they seem to  know about is Dere Mable.\"    Roger chuckled.  \"I hope you don't think I'm a mere highbrow,\" he said.  \"As a customer said to me once, without meaning to be funny, 'I like  both the Iliad and the Argosy.'  The only thing I can't stand is  literature that is unfairly and intentionally flavoured with vanilla.  Confectionery soon disgusts the palate, whether you find it in Marcus  Aurelius or Doctor Crane.  There's an odd aspect of the matter that  sometimes strikes me: Doc Crane's remarks are just as true as Lord  Bacon's, so how is it that the Doctor puts me to sleep in a paragraph,  while my Lord's essays keep me awake all night?\"    Titania, being unacquainted with these philosophers, pursued the  characteristic feminine course of clinging to the subject on which she  was informed.  The undiscerning have called this habit of mind  irrelevant, but wrongly.  The feminine intellect leaps like a  grasshopper; the masculine plods as the ant.    \"I see there's a new Mable book coming,\" she said.  \"It's called That's  Me All Over Mable, and the newsstand clerk at the Octagon says he  expects to sell a thousand copies.\"    \"Well, there's a meaning in that,\" said Roger.  \"People have a craving  to be amused, and I'm sure I don't blame 'em.  I'm afraid I haven't  read Dere Mable.  If it's really amusing, I'm glad they read it.  I  suspect it isn't a very great book, because a Philadelphia schoolgirl  has written a reply to it called Dere Bill, which is said to be as good  as the original.  Now you can hardly imagine a Philadelphia flapper  writing an effective companion to Bacon's Essays.  But never mind, if  the stuff's amusing, it has its place.  The human yearning for innocent  pastime is a pathetic thing, come to think about it.  It shows what a  desperately grim thing life has become.  One of the most significant  things I know is that breathless, expectant, adoring hush that falls  over a theatre at a Saturday matinee, when the house goes dark and the  footlights set the bottom of the curtain in a glow, and the latecomers  tank over your feet climbing into their seats----\"    \"Isn't it an adorable moment!\" cried Titania.    \"Yes, it is,\" said Roger; \"but it makes me sad to see what tosh is  handed out to that eager, expectant audience, most of the time.  There  they all are, ready to be thrilled, eager to be worked upon,  deliberately putting themselves into that glorious, rare, receptive  mood when they are clay in the artist's hand--and Lord!  what miserable  substitutes for joy and sorrow are put over on them!  Day after day I  see people streaming into theatres and movies, and I know that more  than half the time they are on a blind quest, thinking they are  satisfied when in truth they are fed on paltry husks.  And the sad part  about it is that if you let yourself think you are satisfied with  husks, you'll have no appetite left for the real grain.\"    Titania wondered, a little panic-stricken, whether she had been  permitting herself to be satisfied with husks.  She remembered how  greatly she had enjoyed a Dorothy Gish film a few evenings before.  \"But,\" she ventured, \"you said people want to be amused.  And if they  laugh and look happy, surely they're amused?\"    \"They only think they are!\" cried Mifflin.  \"They think they're amused  because they don't know what real amusement is!  Laughter and prayer  are the two noblest habits of man; they mark us off from the brutes.  To laugh at cheap jests is as base as to pray to cheap gods.  To laugh  at Fatty Arbuckle is to degrade the human spirit.\"    Titania thought she was getting in rather deep, but she had the  tenacious logic of every healthy girl.  She said:    \"But a joke that seems cheap to you doesn't seem cheap to the person  who laughs at it, or he wouldn't laugh.\"    Her face brightened as a fresh idea flooded her mind:    \"The wooden image a savage prays to may seem cheap to you, but it's the  best god he knows, and it's all right for him to pray to it.\"    \"Bully for you,\" said Roger.  \"Perfectly true.  But I've got away from  the point I had in mind.  Humanity is yearning now as it never did  before for truth, for beauty, for the things that comfort and console  and make life seem worth while.  I feel this all round me, every day.  We've been through a frightful ordeal, and every decent spirit is  asking itself what we can do to pick up the fragments and remould the  world nearer to our heart's desire.  Look here, here's something I  found the other day in John Masefield's preface to one of his plays:  'The truth and rapture of man are holy things, not lightly to be  scorned.  A carelessness of life and beauty marks the glutton, the  idler, and the fool in their deadly path across history.'  I tell you,  I've done some pretty sober thinking as I've sat here in my bookshop  during the past horrible years.  Walt Whitman wrote a little poem  during the Civil War--Year that trembled and reeled beneath me, said  Walt, Must I learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled, and sullen  hymns of defeat?--I've sat here in my shop at night, and looked round  at my shelves, looked at all the brave books that house the hopes and  gentlenesses and dreams of men and women, and wondered if they were all  wrong, discredited, defeated.  Wondered if the world were still merely  a jungle of fury.  I think I'd have gone balmy if it weren't for Walt  Whitman.  Talk about Mr. Britling--Walt was the man who 'saw it  through.'    \"The glutton, the idler, and the fool in their deadly path across  history. . . . Aye, a deadly path indeed.  The German military men  weren't idlers, but they were gluttons and fools to the nth power.  Look at their deadly path!  And look at other deadly paths, too.  Look  at our slums, jails, insane asylums. . . .    \"I used to wonder what I could do to justify my comfortable existence  here during such a time of horror.  What right had I to shirk in a  quiet bookshop when so many men were suffering and dying through no  fault of their own?  I tried to get into an ambulance unit, but I've  had no medical training and they said they didn't want men of my age  unless they were experienced doctors.\"    \"I know how you felt,\" said Titania, with a surprising look of  comprehension.  \"Don't you suppose that a great many girls, who  couldn't do anything real to help, got tired of wearing neat little  uniforms with Sam Browne belts?\"    \"Well,\" said Roger, \"it was a bad time.  The war contradicted and  denied everything I had ever lived for.  Oh, I can't tell you how I  felt about it.  I can't even express it to myself.  Sometimes I used to  feel as I think that truly noble simpleton Henry Ford may have felt  when he organized his peace voyage--that I would do anything, however  stupid, to stop it all.  In a world where everyone was so wise and  cynical and cruel, it was admirable to find a man so utterly simple and  hopeful as Henry.  A boob, they called him.  Well, I say bravo for  boobs!  I daresay most of the apostles were boobs--or maybe they called  them bolsheviks.\"    Titania had only the"]]]
