[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1728"],[0,"The Odyssey of Homer (#15)"],[1,"of a hollow ship, when shrill winds blow  fair in her wake. And therein is a good haven, whence men  launch the gallant ships into the deep when they have drawn  a store of deep black water. There the gods held me twenty  days, nor did the sea-winds ever show their breath, they  that serve to waft ships over the broad back of the sea.  And now would all our corn have been spent, and likewise  the strength of the men, except some goddess had taken pity  on me and saved me, Eidothee, daughter of mighty Proteus,  the ancient one of the sea. For most of all I moved her  heart, when she met me wandering alone apart from my  company, who were ever roaming round the isle, fishing with  bent hooks, for hunger was gnawing at their belly. So she  stood by, and spake and uttered her voice saying:    {* The only name for the Nile in Homer. Cf. Wilkinson,  Ancient Egyptians (1878), vol. i. p. 7.}    '\"Art thou so very foolish, stranger, and feeble-witted, or  art thou wilfully remiss, and hast pleasure in suffering?  So long time art thou holden in the isle and canst find no  issue therefrom, while the heart of thy company faileth  within them?\"    'Even so she spake, and I answered her saying: \"I will  speak forth, what goddess soever thou art, and tell thee  that in no wise am I holden here by mine own will, but it  needs must be that I have sinned against the deathless  gods, who keep the wide heaven. Howbeit, do thou tell  me--for the gods know all things--which of the immortals it  is that binds me here and hath hindered me from my way, and  declare as touching my returning how I may go over the  teeming deep.\"    'So I spake, and straightway the fair goddess made answer:  \"Yea now, sir, I will plainly tell thee all. Hither  resorteth that ancient one of the sea, whose speech is  sooth, the deathless Egyptian Proteus, who knows the depths  of every sea, and is the thrall of Poseidon, and who, they  say, is my father that begat me. If thou couldst but lay an  ambush and catch him, he will surely declare to thee the  way and the measure of thy path, and will tell thee of thy  returning, how thou mayest go over the teeming deep. Yea,  and he will show thee, O fosterling of Zeus, if thou wilt,  what good thing and what evil hath been wrought in thy  halls, whilst thou has been faring this long and grievous  way.\"    'So she spake, but I answered and said unto her: \"Devise  now thyself the ambush to take this ancient one divine,  lest by any chance he see me first, or know of my coming,  and avoid me. For a god is hard for mortal man to quell.\"    'So spake I, and straightway the fair goddess made answer:  \"Yea now, sir, I will plainly tell thee all. So often as  the sun in his course stands high in mid heaven, then forth  from the brine comes the ancient one of the sea, whose  speech is sooth, before the breath of the West Wind he  comes, and the sea's dark ripple covers him. And when he is  got forth, he lies down to sleep in the hollow of the  caves. And around him the seals, the brood of the fair  daughter of the brine, sleep all in a flock, stolen forth  from the grey sea water, and bitter is the scent they  breathe of the deeps of the salt sea. There will I lead  thee at the breaking of the day, and couch you all orderly;  so do thou choose diligently three of thy company, the best  thou hast in thy decked ships. And I will tell thee all the  magic arts of that old man. First, he will number the seals  and go over them; but when he has told their tale and  beheld them, he will lay him down in the midst, as a  shepherd mid the sheep of his flock. So soon as ever ye  shall see him couched, even then mind you of your might and  strength, and hold him there, despite his eagerness and  striving to be free. And he will make assay, and take all  manner of shapes of things that creep upon the earth, of  water likewise, and of fierce fire burning. But do ye grasp  him steadfastly and press him yet the more, and at length  when he questions thee in his proper shape, as he was when  first ye saw him laid to rest, then, hero, hold thy strong  hands, and let the ancient one go free, and ask him which  of the gods is hard upon thee, and as touching thy  returning, how thou mayest go over the teeming deep.\"    'Therewith she dived beneath the heaving sea, but I betook  me to the ships where they stood in the sand, and my heart  was darkly troubled as I went. But after I had come down to  the ship and to the sea, and we had made ready our supper  and immortal night had come on, then did we lay us to rest  upon the sea-beach. So soon as early Dawn shone forth, the  rosy fingered, in that hour I walked by the shore of the  wide-wayed sea, praying instantly to the gods; and I took  with me three of my company, in whom I trusted most for  every enterprise.    'Meanwhile, so it was that she had plunged into the broad  bosom of the sea, and had brought from the deep the skins  of four sea-calves, and all were newly flayed, for she was  minded to lay a snare for her father. She scooped lairs on  the sea-sand, and sat awaiting us, and we drew very nigh  her, and she made us all lie down in order, and cast a skin  over each. There would our ambush have been most terrible,  for the deadly stench of the sea bred seals distressed us  sore: nay, who would lay him down by a beast of the sea?  But herself she wrought deliverance, and devised a great  comfort. She took ambrosia of a very sweet savour, and set  it beneath each man's nostril, and did away with the stench  of the beast. So all the morning we waited with steadfast  heart, and the seals came forth in troops from the brine,  and then they couched them all orderly by the sea-beach.  And at high day the ancient one came forth from out of the  brine, and found his fatted seals, yea and he went along  their line and told their tale; and first among the  sea-beasts he reckoned us, and guessed not that there was  guile, and afterward he too laid him down. Then we rushed  upon him with a cry, and cast our hands about him, nor did  that ancient one forget his cunning. Now behold, at the  first he turned into a bearded lion, and thereafter into a  snake, and a pard, and a huge boar; then he took the shape  of running water, and of a tall and flowering tree. We the  while held him close with steadfast heart. But when now  that ancient one of the magic arts was aweary, then at last  he questioned me and spake unto me, saying:    '\"Which of the gods was it, son of Atreus, that aided thee  with his counsel, that thou mightest waylay and take me  perforce? What wouldest thou thereby?\"    'Even so he spake, but I answered him saying; \"Old man,  thou knowest all, wherefore dost thou question me thereof  with crooked words? For lo, I am holden long time in this  isle, neither can I find any issue therefrom, and my heart  faileth within me. Howbeit do thou tell me--for the gods  know all things--which of the immortals it is that bindeth  me here, and hath hindered me from my way; and declare as  touching my returning, how I may go over the teeming deep.\"    'Even so I spake, and he straightway answered me, saying:  \"Nay, surely thou shouldest have done goodly sacrifice to  Zeus and the other gods ere thine embarking, that with most  speed thou mightst reach thy country, sailing over the  wine-dark deep. For it is not thy fate to see thy friends,  and come to thy stablished house and thine own country,  till thou hast passed yet again within the waters of  Aegyptus, the heaven-fed stream, and offered holy hecatombs  to the deathless gods who keep the wide heaven. So shall  the gods grant thee the path which thou desirest.\"    'So spake he, but my spirit within me was broken, for that  he bade me again to go to Aegyptus over the misty deep, a  long and grievous way.    'Yet even so I answered him saying: \"Old man, all this will  I do, according to thy word. But come, declare me this, and  tell it all plainly. Did all those Achaeans return safe  with their ships, all whom Nestor and I left as we went  from Troy, or perished any by a shameful death aboard his  own ship, or in the arms of his friends, after he had wound  up the clew of war?\"    'So spake I, and anon he answered me, saying: \"Son of  Atreus, why dost thou straitly question me hereof? Nay, it  is not for thy good to know or learn my thought; for I tell  thee thou shalt not long be tearless, when thou hast heard  it all aright. For many of these were taken, and many were  left; but two only of the leaders of the mail-coated  Achaeans perished in returning; as for the battle, thou  thyself wast there. And one methinks is yet alive, and is  holden on the wide deep. Aias in truth was smitten in the  midst of his ships of the long oars. Poseidon at first  brought him nigh to Gyrae, to the mighty rocks, and  delivered him from the sea. And so he would have fled his  doom, albeit hated by Athene, had he not let a proud word  fall in the fatal darkening of his heart. He said that in  the gods' despite he had escaped the great gulf of the sea;  and Poseidon heard his loud boasting, and presently caught  up his trident into his strong hands, and smote the rock  Gyraean and cleft it in twain. And the one part abode in  his place, but the other fell into the sea, the broken  piece whereon Aias sat at the first, when his heart was  darkened. And the rock bore him down into the vast and  heaving deep; so there he perished when he had drunk of the  salt sea water. But thy brother verily escaped the fates  and avoided them in his hollow ships, for queen Hera saved  him. But now when he was like soon to reach the steep mount  of Malea, lo, the storm wind snatched him away and bore him  over the teeming deep, making great moan, to the border of  the country whereof old Thyestes dwelt, but now Aegisthus  abode there, the son of Thyestes. But when thence too there  showed a good prospect of safe returning, and the gods  changed the wind to a fair gale, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17280"],[0,"Anthropology (#15)"],[1,"can at present tell us little. M. Demolins, it is true,  describes three routes, one along the Rockies, the next down the  central zone of prairies, and the third and most easterly by way of  the great lakes. But this is pure hypothesis. No facts are adduced.  Indeed, evidence bearing on distribution is very hard to obtain in  this area, since the physical type is so uniform throughout. The best  available criterion is the somewhat poor one of the distribution of  the very various languages. Some curious lines of migration are  indicated by the occurrence of the same type of language in widely  separated regions, the most striking example being the appearance of  one linguistic stock, the so-called Athapascan, away up in the  north-west by the Alaska boundary; at one or two points in  south-western Oregon and north-western California, where an absolute  medley of languages prevails; and again in the southern highlands along  the line of Colorado and Utah to the other side of the Mexican frontier.  Does it follow from this distribution that the Apaches, at the southern  end of the range, have come down from Alaska, by way of the Rockies  and the Pacific slope, to their present habitat? It might be so in  this particular case; but there are also those who think that the signs  in general point to a northward dispersal of tribes, who before had  been driven south by a period of glaciation. Thus the first thing to  be settled is the antiquity of the American type of man.    A glance at South America must suffice. Geographically it consists  of three regions. Westwards we have the Pacific line of bracing  highlands, running down from Mexico as far as Chile, the home of two  or more cultures of a rather high order. Then to the east there is  the steaming equatorial forest, first covering a fan of rivers, then  rising up into healthier hill-country, the whole in its wild state  hampering to human enterprise. And below it occurs the grassland of  the pampas, only needing the horse to bring out the powers of its native  occupants.    Before leaving this subject of the domesticated horse, of which so  much use has already been made in order to illustrate how geographic  opportunity and human contrivance must help each other out, it is worth  noticing how an invention can quickly revolutionize even that cultural  life of the ruder races which is usually supposed to be quite hide-bound  by immemorial custom. When the Europeans first broke in upon the  redskins of North America, they found them a people of hunters and  fishers, it is true, but with agriculture as a second string everywhere  east of the Mississippi as well as to the south, and on the whole  sedentary, with villages scattered far apart; so that in pre-Conquest  days they would seem to have been enjoying a large measure of security  and peace. The coming of the whites soon crowded them back upon  themselves, disarranging the old boundaries. At the same time the horse  and the gun were introduced. With extraordinary rapidity the Indian  adapted himself to a new mode of existence, a grassland life,  complicated by the fact that the relentless pressure of the invaders  gave it a predatory turn which it might otherwise have lacked.  Something very similar, though neither conditions nor consequences  were quite the same, occurred in the pampas of South America, where  horse-Indians like the Patagonians, who seem at first sight the  indigenous outcrop of the very soil, are really the recent by-product  of an intrusive culture.           *       *       *       *       *    And now let us hark back to southern Asia with its two reservoirs of  life, India and China, and between them a jutting promontory pointing  the way to the Indonesian archipelago, and thence onward farther still  to the wide-flung Austral region with its myriad lands ranging in size  from a continent to a coral-atoll. Here we have a nursery of seamen  on a vaster scale than in the Mediterranean; for remember that from  this point man spread, by way of the sea, from Easter Island in the  Eastern Pacific right away to Madagascar, where we find Javanese  immigrants, and negroes who are probably Papuan, whilst the language  is of a Malayo-Polynesian type.    India and China each well-nigh deserve the status of geographical  provinces on their own account. Each is an area of settlement; and,  once there is settlement, there is a cultural influence which  co-operates with the environment to weed out immigrant forms; as we  see, for example, in Egypt, where a characteristic physical type, or  rather pair of types, a coarser and a finer, has apparently persisted,  despite the constant influx of other races, from the dawn of its long  history. India, however, and China have both suffered so much invasion  from the Eurasian northland, and at the same time are of such great  extent and comprise such diverse physical conditions, that they have,  in the course of the long years, sent forth very various broods of  men to seek their fortunes in the south-east.    Nor must we ignore the possibility of an earlier movement in the  opposite direction. In Indonesia, the home of the orang-utan and gibbon,  not to speak of Pithecanthropus, many authorities would place the  original home of the human race. It will be wise to touch lightly on  matters involving considerations of palaeo-geography, that most  kaleidoscopic of studies. The submerged continents which it calls from  the vasty deep have a habit of crumbling away again. Let us therefore  refrain from providing man with land-bridges (draw-bridges, they might  almost be called), whether between the Indonesian islands; or between  New Guinea, Australia and Tasmania; or between Indonesia and Africa  by way of the Indian Ocean. Let the curious facts about the present  distribution of the racial types speak for themselves, the  difficulties about identifying a racial type being in the meantime  ever borne in mind.    Most striking of all is the diffusion of the Negro stocks with black  skin and woolly hair. Their range is certainly suggestive of a  breeding-ground somewhere about Indonesia. To the extreme west are  the negroes of Africa, to the extreme east the Papuasians (Papuans  and Melanesians) extending from New Guinea through the oceanic islands  as far as Fiji. A series of connecting links is afforded by the small  negroes of the pygmy type, the so-called Negritos. It is not known  how far they represent a distinct and perhaps earlier experiment in  negro-making, though this is the prevailing view; or whether the negro  type, with its tendency to infantile characters due to the early  closing of the cranial sutures, is apt to throw off dwarfed forms in  an occasional way. At any rate, in Africa there are several groups  of pygmies in the Congo region, as well as the Bushmen and allied stocks  in South Africa. Then the Andaman Islanders, the Semang of the Malay  Peninsula, the Aket of eastern Sumatra, the now extinct Kalangs of  Java, said to have been in some respects the most ape-like of human  beings, the Aetas of the Philippines, and the dwarfs, with a  surprisingly high culture, recently reported from Dutch New Guinea,  are like so many scattered pieces of human wreckage. Finally, if we  turn our gaze southward, we find that Negritos until the other day  inhabited Tasmania; whilst in Australia a strain of Negrito, or Negro  (Papuan), blood is likewise to be detected.    Are we here on the track of the original dispersal of man? It is  impossible to say. It is not even certain, though highly probable,  that man originated in one spot. If he did, he must have been  hereditarily endowed, almost from the outset, with an adaptability  to different climates quite unique in its way. The tiger is able to  range from the hot Indian jungle to the freezing Siberian tundra; but  man is the cosmopolitan animal beyond all others. Somehow, on this  theory of a single origin, he made his way to every quarter of the  globe; and when he got there, though needing time, perhaps, to acquire  the local colour, managed in the end to be at home. It looks as if  both race and a dash of culture had a good deal to do with his  exploitation of geographical opportunity. How did the Australians and  their Negrito forerunners invade their Austral world, at some period  which, we cannot but suspect, was immensely remote in time? Certain  at least it is that they crossed a formidable barrier. What is known  as Wallace's line corresponds with the deep channel running between  the islands of Bali and Lombok and continuing northwards to the west  of Celebes. On the eastern side the fauna are non-Asiatic. Yet somehow  into Australia with its queer monotremes and marsupials entered  triumphant man--man and the dog with him. Haeckel has suggested that  man followed the dog, playing as it were the jackal to him. But this  sounds rather absurd. It looks as if man had already acquired enough  seamanship to ferry himself across the zoological divide, and to take  his faithful dog with him on board his raft or dug-out. Until we have  facts whereon to build, however, it would be as unpardonable to lay  down the law on these matters as it is permissible to fill up the blank  by guesswork.    It remains to round off our original survey by a word or two more about  the farther extremities, west, south, and east, of this vast southern  world, to which south-eastern Asia furnishes a natural approach. The  negroes did not have Africa, that is, Africa south of the Sahara, all  to themselves. In and near the equatorial forest-region of the west  the pure type prevails, displaying agricultural pursuits such as the  cultivation of the banana, and, farther north, of millet, that must  have been acquired before the race was driven out of the more open  country. Elsewhere occur mixtures of every kind with intrusive  pastoral peoples of the Mediterranean type, the negro blood, however,  tending to"]]]
