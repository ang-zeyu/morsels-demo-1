It was the lower jawbone of a human  being.    \"Great God!\" he gasped. \"What is the meaning of this?\"    \"It means,\" said Whitson, \"that we are in a nest of bloody cannibals!\"    Langley dropped like a stone, in a dead faint; so Whitson dragged him  outside, and, leaving him to recover in the open air, returned to the  cave. He then seized the pick and began digging, unearthing some new  horror at every stroke. A glittering object caught his eye; he picked  this up and found it to be the steel buckle of a woman's belt. He  glanced toward the cleft in the rock where the lumps of flesh were  hanging, and caught his breath short. Going outside he made another  torch, which he lit; and then he returned and carefully examined the  loosened surface. Another glittering object caught his eye. This, when  examined, proved to be an old silver watch, the appearance of which  seemed familiar. He forced open the case, and saw, roughly scratched  on the inside, the letter D. He now recognised it; he remembered having  once fixed a glass in this very watch for Dollond, about a month before  the latter's disappearance. Continuing his search Whitson found the iron  heel-plate of a boot, and a small bunch of keys.    Whitson drew his revolver, and picking up the torch went into the  terminal chamber. Four shots, fired in quick succession, reverberated  immediately afterward through the cavern.    Whitson then went outside to Langley, whom he found sitting down near  the fire, looking if possible, more ghastly than before. The presence of  Whitson seemed, however, to act on him as a kind of tonic, and he soon  pulled himself together sufficiently to assist in piling a quantity of  fuel upon the already sinking fire, which soon blazed brightly, lighting  up the mouth of the cavern and the space in front of it. One of the  bodies of the men who had been shot was lying on its side, with the face  toward the fire. Whitson examined the mouth, pushing back the upper  lip with a piece of stick. He found that the shape of the mouth and the  development of the teeth were the same as Ghamba's. The other bodies  were lying on their faces, so he did not trouble to examine them.    Whitson then told Langley to follow him, and the two walked down the  foot-path toward where they had left Ghamba. Him they found lying  motionless in the position in which he had been left about an hour  previously. They removed the sack and the gag and untied his feet, first  taking the precaution to fasten the belt by one end to his bound hands,  Whitson holding the other. They then signed to him to proceed toward the  cave, and this he silently did, without making any resistance. He looked  calmly at the three dead bodies, but said not a word. Langley held him,  while Whitson again tied his feet together with the belt, and then they  placed him with his back against a rock, facing the fire, which  was still blazing brightly. His lips were drawn back in a ghastly,  mirthless, grin, and the tusks were revealed from point to insertion.    Langley questioned Ghamba, but he would not speak. After several  attempts to force him to answer had been vainly made, Whitson said:    \"Now tell him that if he speaks and tells the whole truth he will only  be shot, but if he does not speak he will be burned alive.\"    This was interpreted, but the threat had no apparent effect. So Whitson  seized Ghamba and dragged him to the fire, where he flung him down on  the very edge of the glowing embers.    \"Now,\" said Whitson, holding him down with his foot, so that he got  severely scorched, \"for the last time, will you speak?\"    \"Take me away from the fire, and I will speak,\" said Ghamba, in English.    So they lifted him, and set him again with his back to the rock.    \"Now,\" said Whitson, \"go ahead, and no nonsense!\"    \"If I tell the whole truth,\" said Ghamba, still speaking English, and  with a fair accent, \"will you swear not to burn me, but to shoot me, so  that I shall die at once?\"    \"I will,\" said Whitson.    \"You too must swear,\" said Ghamba, looking at Langley.    \"Yes, I swear.\"    \"Very well,\" said Ghamba, \"I will tell you everything, but you must both  remember what you have sworn to.\"    \"Yes, all right,\" said Whitson. Ghamba then looked at Langley, who  repeated the words.    \"I will tell you,\" said Ghamba, \"all I can remember, and you can ask  questions, which I shall answer truly. You have heard of Umdava, who  used to eat men in Natal long ago, after the wars of Tshaka--well, he  was my uncle. After Umdava had been killed and his people scattered, my  father, with a few followers, came to live among these mountains. But we  found that after having eaten human flesh we could enjoy no other food,  so we caught people and ate them. These two men lying dead are my sons,  and that woman is my daughter. My four wives were here to-night. They  are very old women. Have you not seen them?\" he asked, looking at  Whitson.    \"They are in there; I shot them,\" said Whitson, pointing to the cave.    \"I had other children,\" continued Ghamba, quite unmoved, \"but we ate  them when food was scarce.\"    \"Have you always lived, all these years, on human flesh?\" asked Whitson.    \"No, not always; but whenever we could obtain it we did so. There is  other food in these mountains--honey, ants' eggs, roots, and fruit;  besides game, which is, however, not very easy to catch. But we have  often all had to go away and work when times have been bad. Besides, I  have a herd of cattle at a Basuto kraal, and I have been in the habit of  taking some of these now and then, and exchanging them for corn, which  the women then went to fetch. But we have always tried to get people to  eat, because we could enjoy no other kind of food. Sometimes we got them  easily; and when we were very fortunate we used to dry part of the meat  by hanging it up and lighting a fire underneath, with green wood, so as  to make plenty of smoke.\"    \"Have you killed many white people?\" asked Whitson.    \"Yes, a good number; but not, of course, as many as black. Lately we  have always tried to catch whites, because when you have eaten white  flesh for some time, the flesh of a native no longer satisfies you.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"The flavour is not so strong.\"    \"Did you induce the other two policemen to come up by means of the story  about Umhlonhlo?\"    \"Yes, they came up just as you did, and my sons caught them with the  thongs. Umhlonhlo has brought us plenty of food.\"    \"Were you able to take the cartridges out of their revolvers as you did  out of mine?\"    \"No, I had no opportunity; but it was not necessary, because my sons  were so expert at throwing the thongs that they could always catch  people over the arms, and thus render them unable to shoot.\"    \"How did they manage to become so expert?\"    \"By continued practice. I used to walk up the path over and over again,  and let them throw the thong over me. Then the woman was always there  with the club, so that, if one of the thongs missed, she was ready to  strike. I, also, was usually ready to help, in case of necessity.\"    \"Why did you think it necessary to take the cartridges out of my  revolver?\"    \"Because I feared you from the first, and were it not that he\"--baring  his teeth and glancing at Langley, who shuddered--\"looked so nice, and  that we wanted fresh meat so badly, I would not have risked bringing  you. But it would have been all right if I had only let your revolver  alone.\"    \"You say Umhlonhlo has brought you plenty of food; did you ever get any  one besides ourselves and the other two policemen to come up here by  telling them that story?\"    \"Yes, two others--one a man who was searching for gold on the Free State  side of the mountains, and the other a trader whom I met at Maseru. But  these each came alone.\"    \"I see the buckle of a woman's belt in there. Whom did that belong to?  You surely never got a white woman up here?\"    \"Yes, we did,\" said Ghamba, with a horrible half-smile which bared the  gums high above the sockets of his tusks. \"She was a young girl who had  strayed from a waggon passing over the mountain by the Ladysmith road,  only a day's walk from here. I pretended to show her the shortest way  to her waggon, and thus brought her as far as she could walk in this  direction. I then killed her, and came up here and fetched my sons. We  carried her up in the night. She was very young and plump, and I have  never eaten anything that I enjoyed so much.\" (Whitson turned cold  with horror. He remembered the girl's mysterious disappearance, and the  fruitless searches undertaken in consequence.) \"His flesh\"--glancing  again at Langley--\"looks something like hers did, and I am sure it would  taste just as nice. There was still a little of her left when I went  away last week. If you will go in there and look where the rock is split  on the right-hand side, you will--\" But he did not finish the sentence,  for a bullet from Whitson's revolver crushed through his brain, and he  tumbled forward on his face into the fire.      It was only after tremendous difficulty that Whitson and Langley  succeeded in escaping from the mountains. However, on the evening of the  third day after their adventure in the cave, they came in sight of the  police camp. Whitson sat down on a stone, and motioned his companion to  do the same.    \"See here, sonny,\" he said, \"I want to have a short talk with you. I am  a bit cross with you as the cause of my having been sucked in by that  d--d murdering old walrus. You ought to know the inhabitants of this  country better than a simple stranger like me, and so I took your lead.  Now, another thing: you nearly bust us both by your blasted foolishness  in going to sleep that day; but let that pass, because perhaps it would  have been worse if we had not been put on our guard; not but that it  would take a d--d smart cannibal to eat Hiram Whitson.

In 1252, he  even went so far as to grant them a charter of liberties, but for this  concession the citizens had to pay 500 marks.(230)    (M144)    It is scarcely to be wondered at if, when the crisis arrived, and king and  barons found themselves in avowed hostility, the citizens of London joined  the popular cause. By the month of June, 1258, the barons had gained their  first victory over Henry. He was forced to accept the Provisions of  Oxford, passed by the Mad Parliament,(231) as it came to be called in  derision. The Tower of London was transferred to the custody of the  barons, and they were for the future to appoint the justiciar. Towards the  end of July, a deputation from the barons waited upon the mayor and  citizens to learn if they approved of the agreement that had been made  with the king.(232)    (M145)    The mayor, aldermen, and citizens, after a hasty consultation, gave their  assent, but with the reservation \"saving unto them all their liberties and  customs,\" and the city's common seal was set to the so-called \"charter\"  which the deputation had brought.    (M146)    It was not long before the city discovered that the barons were as little  likely to respect its liberties as the king himself. Hugh Bigod, whom they  had appointed justiciar gave offence by the way he exercised his office.  In spite of all remonstrance he insisted upon sitting at the Guildhall to  hear pleas, a jurisdiction which belonged exclusively to the sheriffs. He  summoned the bakers of the city to appear before him, and those who were  convicted of selling bread under weight he punished, in a way that was not  in conformity with city usage.(233)    (M147)    In November of the following year (1259), Henry took occasion of his  departure for the continent to make some popular concessions to the  citizens. He appeared at a Folkmote, which was being held at Paul's Cross,  and, before taking leave, he announced that in future the citizens should  be allowed to plead their own cases (without employing legal aid) in all  the courts of the city, excepting in pleas of the crown, pleas of land,  and of wrongful distress. On the same day John Mansel who had been one of  the king's justiciars in 1257, when the city was \"taken into the king's  hand,\" and Fitz-Thedmar had been indicted and deprived of his aldermanry  for upholding the privileges of the citizens(234)--publicly acknowledged on  the king's behalf the injustice of Fitz-Thedmar's indictment, and  announced that Henry not only recalled him to favour, but commanded that  he should be restored to his former position.(235)    (M148)    During the king's absence abroad, the barons' cause was materially  strengthened by the support afforded Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester,  by the king's son. Upon hearing of the defection of his son, Henry hurried  back to England. A consultation took place in the city as to the attitude  which the citizens ought to take up, with the result that when Henry  appeared (April, 1260), both he and the Earl of Gloucester were admitted  into the city, whilst the Earl of Leicester and \"Sir Edward,\" as the  chronicler styles the king's son, had to find accommodation in the  suburbs.(236)    Henry was now master of the situation. The city was his, and he determined  that it should remain so. Strict watch was kept over the gates, which for  the most part, were kept shut night and day in order to prevent surprise.  Every inhabitant of the age of twelve years and upwards was called upon to  take an oath of allegiance before the alderman of his ward, and those of  maturer age were bound to provide themselves with arms. The king, who now  ruled again in his own way, stirred the anger of the barons, by presuming  to appoint Philip Basset, his chief justiciar, without first asking their  assent; and the barons retaliated by removing the king's sheriffs, and  appointing \"wardens of the counties\" in their stead.(237) In June 1261,  Henry produced a Bull of Alexander IV, annulling the Provisions of Oxford,  and freeing him from his oath.(238)    (M149)    For eighteen months the king reigned supreme. The barons could do nothing,  and the Earl of Leicester, finding their cause hopeless, withdrew in  August (1261) to France, and remained there until the spring of 1263, when  he returned as the unquestioned head of the baronial party, to take up  arms against the king. The citizens professed loyalty to Henry, who was  residing in the Tower, and bound themselves by oath to acknowledge his son  Edward as heir to the crown.(239) At Whitsuntide, the barons sent a letter  to the king requiring him to observe the Provisions of Oxford, and shortly  afterwards, addressed another letter to the citizens \"desiring to be  certified by them whether they would observe the said ordinances and  statutes made to the honour of God in fealty to his lordship the king, and  to his advantage of all the realm, or would, in preference, adhere to  those who wished to infringe the same.\"(240)    (M150)    Before sending a reply, the citizens had an interview with the king in the  Tower, to whom they showed the barons' letter. The result was, that Henry  availed himself of their services to mediate between him and the barons. A  deputation of citizens accordingly travelled to Dover, where an  understanding was arrived at between the hostile parties. The citizens  were prepared to support the barons, subject to their fealty to the king  and saving their own liberties; whilst the king promised to dismiss his  foreign supporters--the real cause of all the mischief. Hugh le Despenser,  whom Henry had deposed, was again installed justiciar of all England in  the Tower; and the king and his family left the city for Westminster, the  day after the barons entered it. \"Thus was a league made between the  barons and the citizens with this reservation--'saving fealty to his  lordship the king.'\"(241)    (M151)    Whilst the commons of England were thus winning their way to liberty, the  commons of the city were engaged in a similar struggle with the  aristocratic element of the municipal government.  The craft guilds cried  out against the exclusiveness of the more wealthy and aristocratic trade  guilds, the members of which monopolized the city's rule. They found an  able champion of their cause in the person of Thomas Fitz-Thomas, the  mayor for the time being (1261-1265). The mayor's action in the matter  disgusted Fitz-Thedmar, the city alderman and chronicler, who complains  that he \"so pampered the city populace,\" that they styled themselves the  \"commons of the city,\" and had obtained the first voice in the city. The  mayor would ask them their will as to whether this or that thing should be  done; and if they answered \"ya\" \"ya,\" it was done, without consulting the  aldermen or chief citizens, whose very existence was ignored.(242) It is  not surprising that, under a mayor so thoroughly in sympathy with the  people, opportunity was taken by the citizens to rectify abuses from which  they had so long suffered. Their trade had been prejudiced by the number  of foreigners which the king had introduced into the city, and accordingly  we read of an attack made on the houses of some French merchants. Rights  of way which had been stopped up, were again opened, and where land had  been illegally built upon, the buildings were abated.    The chronicler complains of the populace acting \"like so many justices  itinerant.\" It was in vain that the king addressed a letter to the mayor  and citizens, setting forth that the dissensions between himself and the  barons had been settled, and commanding his peace to be kept as well  within the city as without.(243)    (M152)    The popular movement received every encouragement from the barons. Let  those who were disaffected put their complaints into writing, and the  barons would see that the matter was duly laid before the king, and that  the city's liberties were not diminished. Fortified with such promises,  the mayor set to work at once to organize the craft guilds. Ordinances  were drawn up \"abominations\" Fitz-Thedmar calls them(244) for the  amelioration of the members, and everything was done that could be done to  better their condition.    (M153)    A few days before Henry and the barons had concluded a temporary peace,  the citizens had been greatly excited by an action of the king's son.  Henry was, as usual, in want of money, and had failed to raise a loan in  the city. His son came to his assistance and seized the money and jewels  lying at the Temple (29th June). The citizens were so exasperated at this  high-handed proceeding on the part of the prince that they vented their  spleen on the queen, and pelted her with mud and stones, calling her all  kinds of opprobrious names, as she attempted to pass in her barge under  London Bridge on her way from the Tower to Windsor. (13th July).(245)    Such conduct very naturally incensed the king and his son against the  citizens. Henry was angry with them, moreover, for having admitted the  barons contrary to his express orders.(246) It is not surprising,  therefore, that when Fitz-Thomas presented himself before the Barons of  the Exchequer to be admitted to the mayoralty for the third year in  succession, they refused to admit him by the king's orders, Henry \"being  for many reasons greatly moved to anger against the city.\"(247)    (M154)    Before the end of the year (1263), both king and barons agreed to submit  to the arbitration of the King of France. The award known as the Mise of  Amien--from the place whence it was issue--which Louis made on the 23rd  Jan., 1264, proved of so one-sided a character that the barons had no  alternative but to reject it. However unjustifiable such repudiation on  the part of the barons may have been from a moral point of view, it was a  matter of necessity. Many of them, moreover, including those of the Cinque  Ports, as well as the Londoners,"]]]
