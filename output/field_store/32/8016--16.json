Both for the location of targets and the communication of the effect of  the fire, reliance is placed on observation from aeroplanes and balloons  and on information supplied by special observers and secret agents, who  are sent out ahead or left behind in the enemy's lines to communicate by  telephone or signal. These observers have been found in haystacks,  barns, and other buildings well in advance of the German lines.  Balloons of the so-called sausage pattern remain up in the air for long  periods for the purpose of discovering targets, and until our aviators  made their influence felt by chasing all hostile aeroplanes on sight the  latter were continually hovering over our troops in order to register  their positions and to note where the headquarters, reserves, gun teams,  &c., were located.    If suitable targets are discovered the airman drops a smoke ball  directly over it or lets fall some strips of tinsel, which glitter in  the sun as they slowly descend to the earth. The range to the target is  apparently ascertained by those near the guns by a large telemeter, or  other range finder, which is kept trained on the aeroplane, so that when  the signal is made the distance to the target vertically below is at  once obtained. A few rounds are then fired, and the result is signalled  back by the aviator according to some prearranged code.          VII.    *A Fight in the Clouds.*    [Dated Oct. 13.]      From Friday the 9th of October until Monday the 12th so little occurred  that a narrative of the events can be given in a few words. There has  been the usual sporadic shelling of our trenches which has resulted in  but little harm, so well dug in are our men, and on the night of the  10th the Germans made yet a fresh assault, supported by artillery fire,  against the point which has all along attracted most of their attention.    The attempt was again a costly failure toward which our guns were able  to contribute with great effect.    Details have been received of an exciting encounter in midair. One of  our aviators on a fast scouting monoplane sighted a hostile machine. He  had two rifles, fixed one on either side of his engines, and at once  gave chase, but lost sight of his opponent among the clouds. Soon,  however, another machine hove into view which turned out to be a German  Otto biplane, a type of machine which is not nearly so fast as our  scouts. Our officer once again started a pursuit. He knew that owing to  the position of the propeller of the hostile machine he could not be  fired at when astern of his opponent. At sixty yards range he fired one  rifle without apparent result. Then as his pace was carrying him ahead  of his quarry he turned round, and, again coming to about the same  distance behind, emptied his magazine at the German.    The latter began at once to descend as if either he or his machine were  hit, and shutting off his engine and volplaning to free his hands, the  pursuer recharged his magazine. Unfortunately it jammed, but he managed  to insert four cartridges and to fire them at his descending opponent,  who disappeared into a cloud bank with dramatic suddenness. When the  British officer emerged below the clouds he could see no sign of the  other. He, therefore, climbed to an altitude of some 7,000 feet and came  to the conclusion that the German must have come to earth in the French  lines.    The French airmen, too, have been very successful during the last three  days, having dropped several bombs among the German cavalry and caused  considerable loss and disorder, and having by similar means silenced a  battery of field howitzers.    The German anti-aircraft guns recently have been unusually active. From  their rate of fire they seem to be nearly automatic, but so far they  have not had much effect in reducing the air reconnoissances carried out  by us.    A striking feature of our line--to use the conventional term which so  seldom expresses accurately the position taken up by an army--is that it  consists really of a series of trenches not all placed alongside each  other, but some more advanced than others, and many facing in different  directions. At one place they run east and west along one side of a  valley. At another almost north and south up some subsidiary valley.  Here they line the edge of woods, and there they are on the reverse  slope of a hill, or possibly along a sunken road, and at different  points both the German and the British trenches jut out like  promontories into what might be regarded as the opponents' territory.    Though both sides have moved forward at certain points, and withdrawn at  others, no very important change has been effected in their  dispositions, in spite of the enemy's repeated counter attacks. These  have been directed principally against one portion of the position won  by us, but in spite of the lavish expenditure of life they have not so  far succeeded in driving us back.    The situation of the works in the German front line as a whole has been  a matter of deliberate selection, for they have had the advantage of  previous reconnaissance, being first in the field.    Behind the front they now have several lines prepared for a step-by-step  defense. Another point which might cause astonishment to a visitor to  our intrenchments is the evident indifference displayed to the provision  of an extended field of frontal rifle fire, which is generally accepted  as being one of the great requirements of a defensive position. It is  still desirable, if it can be obtained without the usually accompanying  drawback of exposure to the direct fire of hostile artillery, but  experience has shown that a short field of fire is sufficient to beat  back the infantry assaults of the enemy, and by giving up direct fire at  long or medium ranges and placing our trenches on the reverse slope of a  hill or behind the crest, it is in many places possible to gain shelter  from the frontal fire of the German guns, for the men are well trained  in musketry and under good fire control, and the dead ground beyond the  short range from their position has comparatively small terrors.    Many of the front trenches of the Germans equally lack a distant field  of fire, but if lost they would be rendered untenable by us by the fact  that they would be exposed to a fire from the German guns in the rear  and to cross-rifle fire from neighboring works.    The extent to which cross-fire of all kinds is employed is also  remarkable. Many localities and areas along the Aisne are not swept from  the works directly in front of them, but are rendered untenable by  rifle fire from neighboring features or by that of guns that are out of  sight. So much is this the case that among these hills and valleys it is  a difficult matter for troops to find out whence they are being shot at.    There is a perpetual triangular duel. A's infantry can see nothing to  shoot at, but are under fire from B's guns. The action of B's guns then  brings upon them the attention of some of A's artillery waiting for a  target, the latter being in their turn assailed by other batteries. And  so it goes on. In a wooded country in spite of aeroplanes and balloons  smokeless powder has made the localization and identification of targets  a matter of supreme difficulty.          VIII.    *The Men in the Trenches.*    [Dated Oct. 13.]      On the firing line the men sleep and obtain shelter in dug-outs they  have hollowed or cut under the sides of the trenches. These refuges are  raised slightly above the bottom of the trench, so as to remain dry in  wet weather. The floor of the trench also is sloped for purposes of  draining. Some of the trenches are provided with overhead cover which  gives protection from the weather as well as from shrapnel balls and  splinters of shells. Considerable ingenuity has been exercised by the  men in naming these shelters. Among the favorite designations are the  \"Hotel Cecil,\" the \"Ritz Hotel,\" the \"Billet-Doux Hotel,\" and the \"Rue  Dormir.\"    On the road barricades also are to be found boards bearing this notice:  \"This way to the Prussians.\"    Obstacles of every kind abound, and at night each side can hear the  enemy driving pickets for entanglements, digging _trous-de-loup_, or  working forward by sapping. In some places obstacles have been  constructed by both sides so close together that some wag suggested  that each side provide working parties to perform this fatigue duty  alternately, inasmuch as the work of the enemy is now almost  indistinguishable from ours, and serves the same purpose.    Quarries and caves, to which allusion already has been made, provide  ample accommodation for whole battalions, and most comfortable are these  shelters which have been constructed in them. The northern slopes of the  Aisne Valley fortunately are very steep, and this to a great extent  protects us from the enemy's shells, many of which pass harmlessly over  our heads, to burst in the meadows along the river bank.    At all points subject to shell fire access to the firing line from  behind is provided by communication trenches. These are now so good that  it is possible to cross in safety a fire-swept zone to the advance  trenches from billets in villages, bivouacs in quarries, or other places  where the headquarters of units happen to be.    It already has been mentioned that according to information obtained  from the enemy fifteen Germans were killed by a bomb dropped upon the  ammunition wagon of a cavalry column. It was thought at the time that  this might have been the work of one of our airmen, who reported that he  had dropped a hand grenade on this convoy, and had then got a bird's-eye  view of the finest display of fireworks he had ever seen. From  corroborative evidence it now appears that this was the case; that the  grenade thrown by him probably was the cause of the destruction of a  small "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16370"],[0,"Lameness of the Horse (#15)"],[1,"neck and shoulder, seem to be the more frequent causes of  this trouble. Blows such as are occasioned by kicks and falls frequently  result in atrophy of shoulder muscles.    Course.--In some cases a rapidly progressive atrophy characterizes the  case and lameness and atrophy appear at about the same time. The  affection in such instances does not recover spontaneously but  constitutes a condition which requires prompt and rational treatment so  that function may be fully restored to the parts involved.    Occasionally one may observe cases where there is but slight atrophy;  where the disease progresses slowly and atrophy is not extensive or  marked. In vigorous young animals that are left to run at pasture when  so mildly affected, spontaneous recovery occurs.    Symptomatology.--Lameness is the first manifestation of shoulder  atrophy, and in many cases where lameness is slight, the veterinarian  may fail to discover the exact nature of the trouble if he is not very  proficient as a diagnostician of lameness or if he is careless in taking  into consideration obtainable history, age of the subject, etc. Because  of the fact that the average layman believes that practically every case  of fore-leg lameness wherein it is not obvious that the cause is  elsewhere, is due to a shoulder affection of some kind, we may be too  hasty in giving the client assurance that no \"sweeny\" exists. In some of  these cases where a diagnosis of \"shoulder lameness\" has been made and  the client has been assured that no sweeny exists, the patient is  returned in about a week and there is then marked atrophy of one or both  of the spinatus muscles.    A mixed type of lameness characterizes this affection, and in the  average case there exists little evidence of local pain. The salient  points in recognizing the condition are a consideration of history if  obtainable; age of the subject; finding slight local soreness, by  carefully manipulating the muscles which are usually involved; noting  the character of the lameness if any is present; and where atrophy is  evident, of course, the true condition is obvious.    Treatment.--Subcutaneous injections of equal parts of refined oil of  turpentine and alcohol, with a suitable hypodermic syringe, is a  practical and ordinarily effective treatment. From five to fifteen cubic  centimeters (the quantity varies with the size of the animal), of this  mixture is injected into the atrophied parts at different points, taking  care to introduce only about one to two cubic centimeters at each point  of injection. The syringe should be sterile and, needless to say, the  site of injections must be surgically clean.    Other agents, such as tincture of iodin, solutions of silver nitrate,  saline solutions and various more or less irritating preparations have  been employed; but in the use of these preparations one may either fail  to stimulate sufficient inflammation to cause regeneration to take  place, or infection is apt to occur. Where suppuration results, surgical  evacuation of pus must be promptly effected else large suppurating  cavities form.    The employment of setons constitutes a dependable method of treatment of  shoulder atrophy, but because of the attendant suppurative process which  inevitably results, this method is not popular with modern surgeons and  is a last resort procedure.    After-care.--Regular exercise such as the horse usually takes when at  pasture, is very helpful in treating atrophy, and in some cases it has  been found that no reasonable amount of irritation would stimulate  muscular regeneration; but by later allowing patients to exercise at  will, recovery took place in a satisfactory manner. No special attention  is ordinarily necessary.      Paralysis of the Suprascapular Nerve.    Anatomy.--The suprascapular (anterior scapular) nerve, a small branch  of the brachial plexus, is given off from the anterior portion of this  plexus. The nerve rounds the anterior border of the neck of the scapula,  passing upward and backward under the supraspinatus (antea-spinatus)  muscle and terminating in the infraspinatus (postea-spinatus) muscle.    Etiology and Occurrence.--As the result of direct injury to this nerve  by contusion such as may be received in runaway accidents, collar  bruises, especially collar bruises in young horses that are not  accustomed to pulling and that walk in a manner to cause side draft,  injury to the nerve occurs, and partial or complete paralysis  supervenes. Some writers state that it may be produced by confining an  animal in recumbency, with the casting harness. The common cause of  paralysis or paresis of this nerve in cases such as one observes in  country practice, is bruises from the collar in colts that are put to  heavy farm work or where ill fitting collars are used.    Symptomatology.--With partial or complete suspension of function of  the suprascapular nerve there results enervation of the supraspinatus  and infraspinatus muscles. Since these muscles act as external lateral  ligaments of the scapulohumeral joint, when they are incapacitated,  there naturally follows more or less abduction of the shoulder when  weight is borne.    In extreme cases, as soon as the ailing animal is caused to support  weight with the affected member, the joint is suddenly thrown outward in  a manner that the average layman at once concludes that there must be  scapulohumeral luxation, and the veterinarian receives a call to see a  case wherein the \"shoulder is out of place.\" There exists, however, no  luxation in such cases.    If serious injury is done the nerve so that it undergoes degenerative  changes, there will result atrophy of the muscles that derive their  nerve supply from the suprascapular nerve.    [Illustration: Fig. 7--Paralysis of the suprascapular nerve of the left  shoulder]    Treatment.--During the first few days following injuries which result  in this form of paralysis, it is well to keep the subject inactive, and  if much inflammation of the injured structures contiguous to the nerve  exists, the application of cold packs is beneficial. Later, as soon as  acute inflammation has subsided, vesication of a liberal area around the  anteroexternal part of the scapulohumeral joint and over the course of  the suprascapular nerve, will stimulate recovery in favorable cases. As  a rule, in mild cases, the subject is in a condition to return to work  in two or three weeks.      Radial Paralysis.    Described under the titles of \"Radial Paralysis\" and \"Brachial  Paralysis,\" there is to be found in veterinary literature a discussion  of conditions which vary in character from the almost insignificant form  of paresis to the incurably affected conditions wherein the whole  shoulder is completely paralyzed.    When one considers the anatomy of the brachial nerve plexus and the  distribution of its various branches, the location of this plexus and  its proximity to the first rib, and the inevitable injury it must suffer  in fracture of this bone, together with the inaccessibility of the  plexus, it is not strange that a correct diagnosis of the various  affections of the brachial plexus and the radial nerve is often  impossible until several days or weeks have passed. And, in some  instances, diagnosis is not established until an autopsy has been  performed. Here, too, we fail to find cause for paralysis in some rare  instances.    Anatomy.--The radial nerve is a large branch of the brachial plexus  and is chiefly derived from the first thoracic root of the plexus and is  here situated posterior to the deep brachial artery. It is directed  downward and backward under the subscapularis and teres major muscles,  rounding the posterior part of the humerus, and passing to the anterior  and distal end of the humerus, it finally terminates in the anterior  carpal region. The radial nerve supplies branches to the three heads of  the triceps brachii, to the common and lateral extensors of the digit  and also to the skin covering the forearm.    Etiology and Occurrence.--Nothing definite is known about the cause of  some forms of radial paralysis. However, radial paralysis is encountered  following injury to the nerve occasioned by its being stretched, as in  cases where the triceps brachii is unduly extended in restraining  subjects by means of a casting harness. Berns[10] states that in  confining horses on an old operating table where it was necessary to  draw the affected foot forward twenty-four to thirty-six inches in  advance of its fellow, which was secured in a natural vertical  position, radial paralysis of a mild form was of frequent occurrence.  Country practitioners, in restraining colts by casting with harness or  ropes, occasionally observe a form of paresis wherein the radial nerve  suffers sufficient injury that there is caused a temporary loss of  function of the triceps brachii. Such cases recover within three or four  days and are not a true paralysis, but nevertheless constitute  conditions wherein normal nerve function is temporarily suspended.    [Illustration: Fig. 8--Radial paralysis.]    Symptoms.--Immediately subsequent to injuries which involve the radial  nerve, there is manifested more or less impairment of function.  Remembering the structures supplied by the radial nerve and its  branches, one can readily understand that there should occur as  Cadiot[11] has stated:         In complete paralysis, the joints of the affected limb with the       exception of the shoulder are usually flexed when the horse is       resting. In consequence of loss of power in the triceps and       anterior brachial muscles, the arm is extended and straightened on       the shoulder, the scapulohumeral angle is open, and the elbow       depressed. The forearm is flexed on the arm by the contraction of       the coracoradialis (biceps brachii), while the metacarpus and       phalanges are bent by the action of the posterior antibrachial       "]]]
