Everything in the States goes at a railroad pace; every carter or  teamster is a Solon, in his own idea; and every citizen is a king _de  facto_, for he rules the powers that be. They think in America too fast  for genius to expand to purpose; and as their digestion is impaired by a  Napoleonic style of eating, so very powerful and very highly cultivated  minds are comparatively rare in the Union. There is no time for study,  and they take a democratic road to learning.    And yet, _ceteris paribus_, the Union produces great men and great  minds; and if any thing but dollars was paid attention to, the  literature of America would soon be upon a par with that of the Old  World; as it is, it pays better to reprint French and English authors  than to tax the brains of the natives.    For this reason, the agricultural population of the States are more  reasonable, more amiable, and more original than those engaged in  incessant trade. I have seen an American farmer in my travels this year,  who was the perfect image of the English franklin, before his daughters  wore parasols and thrummed the piano. Oh, railways, ye have much to  answer for! for, although the prosperity of the mass may be increased by  you, the happiness and contentment of the million is deteriorating every  day.    I am not about to write a history of Canada at present, for that is  already done, as far as its military annals are concerned, during the  three years since I last addressed the public; but it shall yet slumber  awhile in its box of pine wood, until the time is ripe for development:  I merely intend here to put together some reminiscences which strike me  as to the part the French Canadian has played, and to show that we  should neither forget nor neglect him.    Canada, as it is well known, was French, both by claim of discovery and  by the more powerful right of possession.    Stimulated by the fame of Cabot, and ambitious to be pilots of the Meta  Incognita, that visionary channel which was to conduct European valour  to the golden Cathay and to the rich Spice Islands of the East, French  adventurers eagerly sought the coveted honours which such a voyage could  not fail to yield them, and to combine overflowing wealth with chivalric  renown. France, England, Spain, Portugal, and Italy, sent forth those  daring spirits whose hopes were uniformly crushed, either by  encountering the unbroken line of continental coast, or dashed to pieces  amidst the terrors of that truly Cimmerian region, where ice and fog,  cold and darkness, contend for empire.    Of all those heroic navigators, who would have rivalled Columbus under  happier circumstances, none were successful, even in a limited sense, in  attempting to reach China by the northern Atlantic, excepting the French  alone, who may fairly be allowed the merit of having traversed nearly  one half of the broadest portion of the New World in the discovery of  the St. Lawrence and its connecting streams, and in having afterwards  reached Mexico by the Mississippi.    Even in our own days, nearly four centuries after the Columbian era, the  idea of reaching China by the North Pole has not been abandoned, and is  actively pursuing by the most enlightened naval government in the world,  and, very possibly, will be achieved; and, as coal exists on the  northern frozen coasts, we shall have ports established, where the  British ensign will fly, in the realms of eternal frost--nay, more, we  shall yet place an iron belt from the Atlantic to the Pacific, a  railroad from Halifax to Nootka Sound, and thus reach China in a  pleasure voyage.    I recollect that, about twelve years ago, a person of very strong mind,  who edited the \"Patriot,\" a newspaper published at Toronto, Mr. Thomas  Dalton, was looked upon as a mere enthusiast, because one of his  favourite ideas, frequently expressed, was, that much time would not  elapse before the teas and silks of China would be transported direct  from the shores of the Pacific to Toronto, by canal, by river, by  railroad, and by steam.    Twelve years have scarcely passed since he first broached such an  apparently preposterous notion, as people of limited views universally  esteemed it; and yet he nearly lived to see an uninterrupted steamboat  communication from England to Lake Superior--a consummation which those  who laughed at him then never even dreamt of--and now a railroad all the  way to the Pacific is in progress of discussion.    Mac Taggart, a lively Scotch civil engineer, who wrote, in 1829, an  amusing work, entitled \"Three Years in Canada,\" was even more sanguine  on this subject; and, as he was a clerk of works on the Rideau Canal,  naturally turned his attention to the practicability of opening a road  by water, by the lakes and rivers, to Nootka Sound.    Two thousand miles of water road by the Ottawa, the St. Lawrence, and  the Welland, has been opened in 1845, and a future generation will see  the white and bearded stranger toiling over the rocky barriers that  alone remain to repel his advances between the great Superior and the  Pacific. A New Simplon and a peaceful Napoleonic mind will accomplish  this.    The China trade will receive an impulse; and, as the arms of England  have overcome those of the Celestial Empire, and we are colonizing the  outer Barbarian, so shall we colonize the shores of the Pacific, south  of Russian America, in order to retain the supremacy of British  influence both in India and in China. The vast and splendid forests  north of the Columbia River will, ere long, furnish the dockyards of  the Pacific coast with the inexhaustible means of extending our  commercial and our military marine.    And who were the pioneers? who cleared the way for this enterprise?  Frenchmen! The hardy, the enduring, the chivalrous Gaul, penetrated from  the Atlantic, in frail vessels, as far as these frail barks could carry  him; and where their service ceased, with ready courage adopted the  still more fragile transport afforded by the canoe of the Indian, in  which, singing merrily, he traversed the greater part of the northern  continent, and actually discovered all that we now know, and much more,  since lapsed into oblivion.    But his genius was that of conquest, and not of permanent colonization;  and, trammelled by feudal laws and observances, although he extended the  national domain and the glory of France beyond his most ardent desire,  yet he took no steps to insure its duration, and thus left the Saxon and  the Anglo-Norman to consolidate the structure of which he had merely  laid the extensive foundation.    But, even now, amidst all the enlightenment of the Christian nations,  the descendants of the French in Canada shake off the dust of feudality  with painful difficulty; and, instead of quietly yielding to a better  order of things, prefer to dwell, from sire to son, the willing slaves  of customs derived from the obsolete decrees of a despotic monarchy.    Whether they individually are gainers or losers by thus adhering to the  rules which guided their ancestors, is another question, too difficult  for discussion to grapple with here. As far as worldly happiness and  simple contentment are concerned, I believe they would lose by the  change, which, however, must take place. The restless and enterprising  American is too close a neighbour to let them slumber long in contented  ignorance.    The Frenchman was, however, adapted, by his nature, to win his way,  either by friendship or by force, among the warlike and untutored sons  of the forest. Accommodating himself with ease to the nomadic life of  the tribes; contrasting his gay and lively temperament with the solemn  taciturnity and immoveable phlegm of the savage; dazzling him with the  splendour of his religious ceremonies; abstemious in his diet, and  coinciding in his recklessness of life; equally a warrior and equally a  hunter; unmoved by the dangers of canoe navigation, for which he seemed  as well adapted as the Red Man himself; the enterprising Gaul was  everywhere feared and everywhere welcome.    The Briton, on the contrary, cold as the Indian, but not so cunning;  accustomed to comparative luxury and ease; despising the child of the  woods as an inferior caste; accompanied in his wars or wanderings by no  outward and visible sign of the religion he would fain implant;  unaccustomed to yield even to his equals in opinion; unprepared for  alternate seasons of severe fasting or riotous plenty; and wholly  without that sanguine temper which causes mirth and song to break forth  spontaneously amidst the most painful toil and privations; was not the  best of pioneers in the wilderness, and was, therefore, not received  with open arms by the American aboriginal nations, until experience had  taught the sterling value of his character, or, rather, until it became  thoroughly apparent.    To this day, where, in the interminable wilderness, all trace of French  influence is buried, the Indian reveres the recollections of his  forefathers respecting that gallant race; and, wherever the canoe now  penetrates, the solemn and silent shades of the vast West, the Bois  Brule, or mixed offspring of the Indian and the Frenchman, may be heard  awakening the slumber of ages with carols derived from the olden France,  as he paddles swiftly and merrily along.    Such was the Frenchman, such the French Canadian; let us therefore give  due honour to their descendants, and let not any feeling of distrust or  dislike enter our minds against a race of men, who, from my long  acquaintance with them, are, I am fully persuaded, the most innocent,  the most contented, and the most happy yeomanry and peasantry of the  whole civilized world.    I have observed already, in a former work, that, as far as my experience  of travelling in the wilds of Canada goes, and it is rather extensive, I  should always in future journeys prefer to provide myself"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20023"],[0,"The Letters of Queen Victoria : A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence (#15)"],[1,"abolished in the British Colonies, I do not  comprehend _why your lot alone should be to be kept, a white little  slavey in England_, for the pleasure of the Court, who never bought  you, as I am not aware of their having gone to any expense on that  head, or the King's even having _spent a sixpence for your existence_.  I expect that my visits in England will also be prohibited by an Order  in Council. Oh consistency and political or _other honesty_, where  must one look for you!    I have not the least doubt that the King, in his passion for the  Oranges, will be _excessively rude to your relations_; this, however,  will not signify much; they are _your guests_ and not _his_, and will  therefore _not_ mind it....        [Footnote 4: King Leopold had for some time cherished a hope      of uniting the Princess Victoria in marriage with her cousin,      Prince Albert of Coburg. He therefore arranged that the      Prince, with his elder brother, Prince Ernest, should pay      a visit to the Duchess of Kent at Kensington Palace. King      William naturally opposed a scheme which he knew met with      the approval of his sister-in-law. He accordingly invited      the Prince of Orange and his two sons at the same time, and      favoured the candidature of the younger son, Prince Alexander.      The King (it is believed) went so far as to say that no      other marriage should ever take place, and that the Duke of      Saxe-Coburg and his son should never put foot in the country;      they should not be allowed to land, and must go back whence      they came.        The Prince of Orange had himself been a candidate for the hand      of Princess Charlotte, and had no reason to be friendly to      King Leopold, of whom it is recorded that he said, \"Voila un      homme qui a pris ma femme et mon royaume.\"]            [Pageheading: ARRIVAL OF PRINCE ALBERT]      _The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    _23rd May 1836._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,-- ... Uncle Ernest and my cousins arrived here on  Wednesday, _sains et saufs_. Uncle is looking remarkably well, and my  cousins are most delightful young people. I will give you no detailed  description of them, as you will so soon see them yourself. But I  must say, that they are both very amiable, very kind and good, and  extremely merry, just as young people should be; with all that,  they are extremely sensible, and very fond of occupation. Albert is  extremely handsome, which Ernest certainly is not, but he has a most  good-natured, honest, and intelligent countenance. We took them to the  Opera on Friday, to see the _Puritani_, and as they are excessively  fond of music, like me, they were in perfect ecstasies, having never  heard any of the singers before....          [Pageheading: PRINCE ALBERT]      _The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    _7th June 1836._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--These few lines will be given to you by my dear  Uncle Ernest when he sees you.    I must thank you, my beloved Uncle, for the prospect of _great_  happiness you have contributed to give me, in the person of dear  Albert. Allow me, then, my dearest Uncle, to tell you how delighted I  am with him, and how much I like him in every way. He possesses every  quality that could be desired to render me perfectly happy. He is so  sensible, so kind, and so good, and so amiable too. He has, besides,  the most pleasing and delightful exterior and appearance you can  possibly see.    I have only now to beg you, my dearest Uncle, to take care of the  health of one, now _so dear_ to me, and to take him under _your  special_ protection. I hope and trust that all will go on prosperously  and well on this subject of so much importance to me.    Believe me always, my dearest Uncle, your most affectionate, devoted,  and grateful Niece,    VICTORIA.          [Pageheading: CONVERSATION]      _The King of the Belgians to the Princess Victoria._    _17th June 1836._    MY DEAREST AND MOST BELOVED CHILD,--I begged your Mother, in the  meantime, to offer you my best thanks for your very pretty drawing  representing the Provost of Bruges and his daughter[5]; I admired also  that for your Aunt. They do your spirit of invention honour, and it is  a very good plan to draw subjects from books or plays which interest  you. You will feel the loss of a pleasant society in the old Palace,  the more so as your relations are good unsophisticated people, a thing  which one does not so often meet with. I suppose that part of your  London amusements will soon be over. You were going to Windsor,  which you will probably have left by this time. I hope you were very  prudent; I cannot disguise from you, that though the inhabitants are  good-natured people, still that I think you want all your natural  caution with them. Never permit yourself to be induced to tell them  any opinion or sentiment of yours which is _beyond the sphere of  common conversation_ and its ordinary topics. Bad use would be made  of it against yourself, and you cannot in that subject be too much  guarded. I know well the people we have to deal with. I am extremely  impartial, but I shall also always be equally watchful.... God bless  you! Ever, my dear child, your very devoted Uncle and Friend,    LEOPOLD R.

I was sure you would be very much pleased with  Ernest and Albert as soon as you knew them more; there cannot be two  more good and sensible young men than they are. Pray, dear Uncle, say  everything most kind from me to them.    We go to Buxted[6] to-morrow morning, and stay there till next Monday.    All the gaieties are now over. We took leave of the Opera on Saturday,  and a most brilliant conclusion to the season it was. Yesterday I took  my farewell lesson with Lablache,[7] which I was very sorry to do. I  have had twenty-six lessons with him, and I look forward with pleasure  to resume them again next spring.        [Footnote 6: Lord Liverpool's house. Charles Cecil Cope      Jenkinson, third Earl of Liverpool, was fifty-three years old      at the time of the Queen's accession. He was a moderate Tory,      and had held office as Under-Secretary for the Home Department      in 1807, and in 1809 as Under-Secretary for War and the      Colonies. He succeeded to the Earldom in 1828. The title,      since revived, became extinct on his death in 1851. He was a      friend of the Duchess of Kent, who often stayed with him at      Buxted Park in Sussex, and at Pitchford in Shropshire. At      three successive visits at the latter house the Princess      occupied the same small room without a fireplace.]        [Footnote 7: Luigi Lablache (1794-1858), a famous      opera-singer, was the Princess's singing-master.]          _The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    _2nd September 1836._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,-- ... The state of Spain is most alarming and  unfortunate.[8] I do hope something will be done. The news were rather  better yesterday and the day before. The Christinos had gained a  victory over the Carlists.[9] I take a great interest in the whole of  this unfortunate affair. I hope and trust Portugal may not suffer by  all the affairs of Spain, but much is to be feared. Dieskau will have  told you much about the internal affairs, which seem to go on very  prosperously. Pray has the Duchess of Braganza[10] written to you or  Aunt Louise since Ferdinand's marriage?    You did not send me the King of Naples'[11] letter, as you said you  would; pray do so in your next letter. I hope he will come here next  year. You do not mention France, so I hope all is quiet. The Duke of  Orleans is quite well again, I am happy to hear from Aunt Louise. Now  I must conclude, begging you to believe me, always, your most truly  attached and really devoted Niece,    VICTORIA.        [Footnote 8: See Introductory Note for the year, _ante_, p. 44.

When I think  that but two hours ago we were happily together, and that now you are  travelling every instant farther and farther away from us, and that I  shall with all probability not see you for a _year_, it makes me cry.  Yes, dearest Uncle, it is dreadful in this life, that one is destined,  and _particularly unhappy me_, to be almost always separated from  those one loves most dearly. I live, however, in the hopes of your  visit next year with dear Aunt, and I cannot say how thankful and  happy I am that we have had you here for six short, and to me _most  bright happy_ days! I shall look back with the greatest delight on  them.    Believe me, always, your ever devoted and most affectionately attached  Niece and _Child_,    VICTORIA.
