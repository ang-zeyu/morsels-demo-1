Thenceforth the votes of a noble, a bishop, or a  deputy all counted alike. The party names of democrat for those who  wanted to exalt the power of the people, and of aristocrat for those who  maintained the privileges of the nobles, came into use, and the most  extreme democrats were called Jacobins, from an old convent of Jacobin  friars, where they used to meet. The mob of Paris, always eager, fickle,  and often blood-thirsty, were excited to the last degree by the debates;  and, full of the remembrance of the insolence and cruelty of the nobles,  sometimes rose and hunted down persons whom they deemed aristocrats,  hanging them to the iron rods by which lamps were suspended over the  streets. The king in alarm drew the army nearer, and it was supposed  that he was going to prevent all change by force of arms. Thereupon the  citizens enrolled themselves as a National Guard, wearing cockades of  red, blue, and white, and commanded by La Fayette, a noble of democratic  opinions, who had run away at seventeen to serve in the American War. On  a report that the cannon of the Bastille had been pointed upon Paris,  the mob rose in a frenzy, rushed upon it, hanged the guard, and  absolutely tore down the old castle to its foundations, though they did  not find a single prisoner in it. \"This is a revolt,\" said Louis, when  he heard of it. \"Sire, it is a revolution,\" was the answer.      3. The New Constitution.--The mob had found out its power. The  fishwomen of the markets, always a peculiar and privileged class, were  frantically excited, and were sure to be foremost in all the  demonstrations stirred up by Jacobins. There was a great scarcity of  provisions in Paris, and this, together with the continual dread that  reforms would be checked by violence, maddened the people. On a report  that the Guards had shown enthusiasm for the king, the whole populace  came pouring out of Paris to Versailles, and, after threatening the life  of the queen, brought the family back with them to Paris, and kept them  almost as prisoners while the Assembly, which followed them to Paris,  debated on the new constitution. The nobles were viewed as the worst  enemies of the nation, and all over the country there were risings of  the peasants, headed by democrats from the towns, who sacked their  castles, and often seized their persons. Many fled to England and  Germany, and the dread that these would unite and return to bring back  the old system continually increased the fury of the people. The  Assembly, now known as the Constituent Assembly, swept away all titles  and privileges, and no one was henceforth to bear any prefix to his name  but citizen; while at the same time the clergy were to renounce all the  property of the Church, and to swear that their office and commission  was derived from the will of the people alone, and that they owed no  obedience save to the State. The estates thus yielded up were supposed  to be enough to supply all State expenses without taxes; but as they  could not at once be turned into money, promissory notes, or assignats,  were issued. But, as coin was scarce, these were not worth nearly their  professed value, and the general distress was thus much increased. The  other oath the great body of the clergy utterly refused, and they were  therefore driven out of their benefices, and became objects of great  suspicion to the democrats. All the old boundaries and other  distinctions between the provinces were destroyed, and France was  divided into departments, each of which was to elect deputies, in whose  assembly all power was to be vested, except that the king retained a  right of veto, _i.e._, of refusing his sanction to any measure. He swore  on the 13th of August, 1791, to observe this new constitution.      4. The Republic.--The Constituent Assembly now dissolved itself, and a  fresh Assembly, called the Legislative, took its place. For a time  things went on more peacefully. Distrust was, however, deeply sown. The  king was closely watched as an enemy; and those of the nobles who had  emigrated began to form armies, aided by the Germans, on the frontier  for his rescue. This enraged the people, who expected that their newly  won liberties would be overthrown. The first time the king exercised his  right of _veto_ the mob rose in fury; and though they then did no more  than threaten, on the advance of the emigrant army on the 10th of  August, 1792, a more terrible rising took place. The Tuilleries was  sacked, the guards slaughtered, the unresisting king and his family  deposed and imprisoned in the tower of the Temple. In terror lest the  nobles in the prisons should unite with the emigrants, they were  massacred by wholesale; while, with a vigour born of the excitement, the  emigrant armies were repulsed and beaten. The monarchy came to an end;  and France became a Republic, in which the National Convention, which  followed the Legislative Assembly, was supreme. The more moderate  members of this were called Girondins from the Gironde, the estuary of  the Garonne, from the neighbourhood of which many of them came. They  were able men, scholars and philosophers, full of schemes for reviving  classical times, but wishing to stop short of the plans of the  Jacobins, of whom the chief was Robespierre, a lawyer from Artois,  filled with fanatical notions of the rights of man. He, with a party of  other violent republicans, called the Mountain, of whom Danton and Marat  were most noted, set to work to destroy all that interfered with their  plans of general equality. The guillotine, a recently invented machine  for beheading, was set in all the chief market-places, and hundreds were  put to death on the charge of \"conspiring against the nation.\" Louis  XVI. was executed early in 1793; and it was enough to have any sort of  birthright to be thought dangerous and put to death.      5. The Reign of Terror.--Horror at the bloodshed perpetrated by the  Mountain led a young girl, named Charlotte Corday, to assassinate Marat,  whom she supposed to be the chief cause of the cruelties that were  taking place; but his death only added to the dread of reaction. A  Committee of Public Safety was appointed by the Convention, and  endeavoured to sweep away every being who either seemed adverse to  equality, or who might inherit any claim to rank. The queen was put to  death nine months after her husband; and the Girondins, who had begun to  try to stem the tide of slaughter, soon fell under the denunciation of  the more violent. To be accused of \"conspiring against the State\" was  instantly fatal, and no one's life was safe. Danton was denounced by  Robespierre, and perished; and for three whole years the Reign of Terror  lasted. The emigrants, by forming an army and advancing on France,  assisted by the forces of Germany, only made matters worse. There was  such a dread of the old oppressions coming back, that the peasants were  ready to fight to the death against the return of the nobles. The army,  where promotion used to go by rank instead of merit, were so glad of the  change, that they were full of fresh spirit, and repulsed the army of  Germans and emigrants all along the frontier. The city of Lyons, which  had tried to resist the changes, was taken, and frightfully used by  Collot d'Herbois, a member of the Committee of Public Safety. The  guillotine was too slow for him, and he had the people mown down with  grape-shot, declaring that of this great city nothing should be left but  a monument inscribed, \"Lyons resisted liberty--Lyons is no more!\" In La  Vendee--a district of Anjou, where the peasants were much attached to  their clergy and nobles--they rose and gained such successes, that they  dreamt for a little while of rescuing and restoring the little captive  son of Louis XVI.; but they were defeated and put down by fire and  sword, and at Nantes an immense number of executions took place, chiefly  by drowning. It was reckoned that no less than 18,600 persons were  guillotined in the three years between 1790 and 1794, besides those who  died by other means. Everything was changed. Religion was to be done  away with; the churches were closed; the tenth instead of the seventh  day appointed for rest. \"Death is an eternal sleep\" was inscribed on the  schools; and Reason, represented by a classically dressed woman, was  enthroned in the cathedral of Notre Dame. At the same time a new era was  invented, the 22nd of September, 1792; the months had new names, and the  decimal measures of length, weight, and capacity, which are based on the  proportions of the earth, were planned. All this time Robespierre really  seems to have thought himself the benefactor of the human race; but at  last the other members of the Convention took courage to denounce him,  and he, with five more, was arrested and sent to the guillotine. The  bloodthirsty fever was over, the Committee of Public Safety was  overthrown, and people breathed again.      6. The Directory.--The chief executive power was placed in the hands  of a Directory, consisting of more moderate men, and a time of much  prosperity set in. Already in the new vigour born of the strong emotions  of the country the armies won great victories, not only repelling the  Germans and the emigrants, but uniting Holland to France. Napoleon  Buonaparte, a Corsican officer, who was called on to protect the  Directory from being again overawed by the mob, became the leading  spirit in France, through his Italian victories. He conquered Lombardy  and Tuscany, and forced the Emperor to let them become republics under  French protection, also to resign Flanders to France by the Treaty of  Campo Formio. Buonaparte then made a descent on Egypt, hoping to attack  India from that side, but he was foiled by Nelson, who destroyed his  fleet in the battle of the Nile, and Sir Sydney Smith, who held"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/173"],[0,"The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu (#15)"],[1," as Strozza, who has an  unpleasant face.  He is a fine linguist, I understand, and is engaged  upon the Spanish notes for Barton's forthcoming book on the Mayapan  temples.  By the way, all Sir Lionel's baggage disappeared from the  landing-stage--including his Tibetan notes.\"    \"Significant!\"    \"Of course.  But he argues that he has crossed Tibet from the Kuen-Lun  to the Himalayas without being assassinated, and therefore that it is  unlikely he will meet with that fate in London.  I left him dictating  the book from memory, at the rate of about two hundred words a minute.\"    \"He is wasting no time.\"    \"Wasting time!  In addition to the Yucatan book and the work on Tibet,  he has to read a paper at the Institute next week about some tomb he  has unearthed in Egypt.  As I came away, a van drove up from the docks  and a couple of fellows delivered a sarcophagus as big as a boat.  It  is unique, according to Sir Lionel, and will go to the British Museum  after he has examined it.  The man crams six months' work into six  weeks; then he is off again.\"    \"What do you propose to do?\"    \"What CAN I do?  I know that Fu-Manchu will make an attempt upon him.  I cannot doubt it.  Ugh!  that house gave me the shudders.  No  sunlight, I'll swear, Petrie, can ever penetrate to the rooms, and when  I arrived this afternoon clouds of gnats floated like motes wherever a  stray beam filtered through the trees of the avenue.  There's a steamy  smell about the place that is almost malarious, and the whole of the  west front is covered with a sort of monkey-creeper, which he has  imported at some time or other.  It has a close, exotic perfume that is  quite in the picture.  I tell you, the place was made for murder.\"    \"Have you taken any precautions?\"    \"I called at Scotland Yard and sent a man down to watch the house,  but--\"    He shrugged his shoulders helplessly.    \"What is Sir Lionel like?\"    \"A madman, Petrie.  A tall, massive man, wearing a dirty dressing-gown  of neutral color; a man with untidy gray hair and a bristling mustache,  keen blue eyes, and a brown skin; who wears a short beard or rarely  shaves--I don't know which.  I left him striding about among the  thousand and one curiosities of that incredible room, picking his way  through his antique furniture, works of reference, manuscripts,  mummies, spears, pottery and what not--sometimes kicking a book from  his course, or stumbling over a stuffed crocodile or a Mexican  mask--alternately dictating and conversing.  Phew!\"    For some time we were silent.    \"Smith\" I said, \"we are making no headway in this business.  With all  the forces arrayed against him, Fu-Manchu still eludes us, still  pursues his devilish, inscrutable way.\"    Nayland Smith nodded.    \"And we don't know all,\" he said.  \"We mark such and such a man as one  alive to the Yellow Peril, and we warn him--if we have time.  Perhaps  he escapes; perhaps he does not.  But what do we know, Petrie, of those  others who may die every week by his murderous agency?  We cannot know  EVERYONE who has read the riddle of China.  I never see a report of  someone found drowned, of an apparent suicide, of a sudden, though  seemingly natural death, without wondering.  I tell you, Fu-Manchu is  omnipresent; his tentacles embrace everything.  I said that Sir Lionel  must bear a charmed life.  The fact that WE are alive is a miracle.\"    He glanced at his watch.    \"Nearly eleven,\" he said.  \"But sleep seems a waste of time--apart from  its dangers.\"    We heard a bell ring.  A few moments later followed a knock at the room  door.    \"Come in!\" I cried.    A girl entered with a telegram addressed to Smith.  His jaw looked very  square in the lamplight, and his eyes shone like steel as he took it  from her and opened the envelope.  He glanced at the form, stood up and  passed it to me, reaching for his hat, which lay upon my writing-table.    \"God help us, Petrie!\" he said.    This was the message:      \"Sir Lionel Barton murdered.  Meet me at his house at once.--WEYMOUTH,  INSPECTOR.\"        CHAPTER XI      ALTHOUGH we avoided all unnecessary delay, it was close upon midnight  when our cab swung round into a darkly shadowed avenue, at the farther  end of which, as seen through a tunnel, the moonlight glittered upon  the windows of Rowan House, Sir Lionel Barton's home.    Stepping out before the porch of the long, squat building, I saw that  it was banked in, as Smith had said, by trees and shrubs.  The facade  showed mantled in the strange exotic creeper which he had mentioned,  and the air was pungent with an odor of decaying vegetation, with which  mingled the heavy perfume of the little nocturnal red flowers which  bloomed luxuriantly upon the creeper.    The place looked a veritable wilderness, and when we were admitted to  the hall by Inspector Weymouth I saw that the interior was in keeping  with the exterior, for the hall was constructed from the model of some  apartment in an Assyrian temple, and the squat columns, the low seats,  the hangings, all were eloquent of neglect, being thickly dust-coated.  The musty smell, too, was almost as pronounced here as outside, beneath  the trees.    To a library, whose contents overflowed in many literary torrents upon  the floor, the detective conducted us.    \"Good heavens!\" I cried, \"what's that?\"    Something leaped from the top of the bookcase, ambled silently across  the littered carpet, and passed from the library like a golden streak.  I stood looking after it with startled eyes.  Inspector Weymouth  laughed dryly.    \"It's a young puma, or a civet-cat, or something, Doctor,\" he said.  \"This house is full of surprises--and mysteries.\"    His voice was not quite steady, I thought, and he carefully closed the  door ere proceeding further.    \"Where is he?\" asked Nayland Smith harshly.  \"How was it done?\"    Weymouth sat down and lighted a cigar which I offered him.    \"I thought you would like to hear what led up to it--so far as we  know--before seeing him?\"    Smith nodded.    \"Well,\" continued the Inspector, \"the man you arranged to send down  from the Yard got here all right and took up a post in the road  outside, where he could command a good view of the gates.  He saw and  heard nothing, until going on for half-past ten, when a young lady  turned up and went in.\"    \"A young lady?\"    \"Miss Edmonds, Sir Lionel's shorthand typist.  She had found, after  getting home, that her bag, with her purse in, was missing, and she  came back to see if she had left it here.  She gave the alarm.  My man  heard the row from the road and came in.  Then he ran out and rang us  up.  I immediately wired for you.\"    \"He heard the row, you say.  What row?\"    \"Miss Edmonds went into violent hysterics!\"    Smith was pacing the room now in tense excitement.    \"Describe what he saw when he came in.\"    \"He saw a negro footman--there isn't an Englishman in the house--trying  to pacify the girl out in the hall yonder, and a Malay and another  colored man beating their foreheads and howling.  There was no sense to  be got out of any of them, so he started to investigate for himself.  He had taken the bearings of the place earlier in the evening, and from  the light in a window on the ground floor had located the study; so he  set out to look for the door.  When he found it, it was locked from the  inside.\"    \"Well?\"    \"He went out and round to the window.  There's no blind, and from the  shrubbery you can see into the lumber-room known as the study.  He  looked in, as apparently Miss Edmonds had done before him.  What he saw  accounted for her hysterics.\"    Both Smith and I were hanging upon his words.    \"All amongst the rubbish on the floor a big Egyptian mummy case was  lying on its side, and face downwards, with his arms thrown across it,  lay Sir Lionel Barton.\"    \"My God!  Yes.  Go on.\"    \"There was only a shaded reading-lamp alight, and it stood on a chair,  shining right down on him; it made a patch of light on the floor, you  understand.\"  The Inspector indicated its extent with his hands.  \"Well, as the man smashed the glass and got the window open, and was  just climbing in, he saw something else, so he says.\"    He paused.    \"What did he see?\" demanded Smith shortly.    \"A sort of GREEN MIST, sir.  He says it seemed to be alive.  It moved  over the floor, about a foot from the ground, going away from him and  towards a curtain at the other end of the study.\"    Nayland Smith fixed his eyes upon the speaker.    \"Where did he first see this green mist?\"    \"He says, Mr. Smith, that he thinks it came from the mummy case.\"    \"Yes; go on.\"    \"It is to his credit that he climbed into the room after seeing a thing  like that.  He did.  He turned the body over, and Sir Lionel looked  horrible.  He was quite dead.  Then Croxted--that's the man's  name--went over to this curtain.  There was a glass door--shut.  He  opened it, and it gave on a conservatory--a place stacked from the  tiled floor to the glass roof with more rubbish.  It was dark inside,  but enough light came from the study--it's really a drawing-room, by  the way--as he'd turned all the lamps on, to give him another glimpse  of this green, crawling mist.  There are three steps to go down.  On  the steps lay a dead Chinaman.\"    \"A dead Chinaman!\"    \"A dead CHINAMAN.\"    \"Doctor seen them?\" rapped Smith.    \"Yes; a local man.  He was out of his depth, I could see.  Contradicted  himself three times.  But there's no need for another opinion--until we  get the coroner's.\"    \"And Croxted?\"    \"Croxted was taken ill, Mr. Smith, and had to be sent home in a cab.\"    \"What ails him?\"    Detective-Inspector Weymouth raised his eyebrows and carefully knocked  the ash from his cigar.    \"He held out until I came, gave me the story, and then fainted right  away.  He said that something in the conservatory seemed to get him by  the throat.\"    \"Did he mean that literally?\"    \"I couldn't say.  We had"]]]
