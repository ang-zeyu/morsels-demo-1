Others will tear their clothes to shreds, not  in anger, but because they \"could not help it.\"    _Psychomotor overactivity_ is abnormal activity of both mind and body,  contrary to reason and uncontrolled by will.    _Psychomotor retardation_ is an underactivity of both mind and body in  which consciousness is dulled and the body sluggish.    A _neurosis_ is a disorder of the nerves, which may be functional or  organic.    _Nervousness_ is properly termed a _psychoneurosis_--for we have  learned that there can be no neurosis without an accompanying psychosis.    _Psychosis_ is the technical synonym for insanity.    _Borderland_ disorders constitute a group in which mental perversions do  not yet so dominate reactions as to make them irrational.    Twilight is neither night nor day; the feelings of the hysteric are not  insane, but the actions may be.    _Insanity_ is a prolonged departure from the individual's normal  standard of thinking, feeling, and acting.    _Mania_ is insane excitement.    _Melancholia_ is the inability of the mind to react to any stimulus with  other than gloom and depression.    Melancholia may be of the intellectual type or of the emotional type.  The patient who tells you constantly that he has murdered all his  children, that he is a criminal beyond the power of God to redeem, who  seems chained to his delusions, yet shows no adequate feeling reaction,  no genuine sorrow, we call a case of the intellectual type of  melancholia. Another patient misinterprets every normal reason for  happiness until it becomes a cause of settled foreboding. The mother,  whose son fought safely through the war and is now returning to her,  feels that his coming forecasts calamity for him. He had better have  died in France. She is of the emotional type of melancholia.    _Hysteria_ is a nervous disorder based upon suggestibility, and capable  of imitating most known diseases.    _Insane impulses_ are morbid demands for reckless action beyond the  control of the will.    Example: The impulse to kill, quite regardless of who may be the victim.    _Psychopathic personality_ is a term much used today to designate an  hereditary tendency on the part of the individual to mental disorder.    The _neuropath_ is the individual with an inborn tendency to the  neurosis.    _Neurotic_ is a term broadly employed for the nervous in whom emotions  predominate over reason.    _Neurasthenia_ is a nervous disorder characterized by undue  fatiguability.    _Psychasthenia_ is a nervous disorder characterized by a sense of  unreality, weakness of will, self-accusation, and usually by phobias and  obsessions, all subject to temporary correction by reason or influence  from without.    _Hypochondriasis_ is a disorder characterized by morbid attention to  bodily sensations, and insistent ideas of bodily disorder.    _Phobia_ is a morbid fear or dread.      FACTORS CAUSING VARIATIONS FROM NORMAL MENTAL PROCESSES    HEREDITY    When we consider the accumulated possibilities for disorder which the  family tree of almost any one of us can show, the wonder is not that  there are so many nervous or insane, but rather that any come within  hailing distance of the normal. For multitudes are born of parents whose  bodies were food poisoned or alcohol or drug poisoned, and whose nervous  systems were tense and irritable, oversensitive, and suffering from the  effect of these same toxins on the brain. Others are of manic-depressive  parentage; some are possibly even of paranoic or dementia praecox  lineage; while many of our finest and best had psychopathic or  neuropathic heredity. Syphilis, itself, and the underpower bodies of  tuberculosis are heritages of many.    When we realize, too, that we are born with certain inherent tendencies  of temperament, which are too often of the melancholic or overcholeric  type, our wonder grows that we are not doomed to defeat at birth. Were  it not for the possibilities in the germ-plasm of choosing the much of  good also in our heredity, often enough to overbalance the bad, and for  the proved power of environment and training to modify or even  altogether overcome the harmful parts of our birthright, there would be  little hope for many.      ENVIRONMENT    While environment may prove the saving grace from poor heredity, it may  itself add heavily to the debit side. With the very best of health  backgrounds, environment may damage body and mind beyond repair. Under  environment we include everything that touches life from  without--people, things, work, play, home, school, social life, business  life, college-life, etc. Among factors of environment damaging to mental  health are overemotional family life, overstrict home discipline or the  lack of needed discipline; overfeeding, underfeeding, wrong diet, lack  of proper exercise, stimulants, drugs, overstimulation, overprotection,  too much hardship and privation, loneliness, poor educational methods,  immorality, etc.      PERSONAL REACTIONS    What will decide whether a human being can resist, successfully, bad  tendencies in heredity, or in environment, or in both, and keep a  reasonably balanced mind? It demands insight, ambition, will; and if  these remain the body can be forced to saving ways of health, and body  and mind can largely make their own environment. But with heavy  handicaps of heredity or environment, or both, and poor insight, or lack  of desire, or weak will, nothing can save the mind from neurotic taint  or worse--nothing but obedience to some one strong enough to control the  habits of that life, until self-control is born. And there is a hope  that it _can_ be born in the most neurotic or neurasthenic, so long as  the mind is sane.    But after all, a large number of people whose mental processes are not  normal, have only themselves, their poor emotions, their lazy wills,  their hazy thinking to blame. We except what are called the heredity  insanities--_dementia praecox_ and the other dementias and the  _manic-depressive_ groups and _paranoia_ and _psychasthenia_--for in  these cases, possibly with the exception of the _manic depressives_,  even the most perfect environment could probably not prevent the  disorder from asserting itself. Many neurotics, neurasthenics, and  hysterics are curable if they will seriously undertake to fulfil the  laws of physical and mental health--simple laws, but ones which demand a  strengthened will to carry out.          CHAPTER X    ATTENTION THE ROOT OF DISEASE OR HEALTH ATTITUDE      THE ATTENTION OF INTEREST    Attention naturally follows interest. It can, however, be held by will  to the unappealing, with the usual result of transforming it into a  thing of interest.    One of the laws of the mind we have already stressed is that what we  attend to largely determines what we are, or shall be. The interests  which secure our consideration may be the passive result of emotional  life, the things which naturally appeal, which give us sensations that  the mind normally heeds; or they may be the active result of our will  which has forced application upon the things which reason advised as  worth acquiring.    We found that the beginning of health of mind consists in the directing  of thought toward the health-bringing attitude. We have seen how quickly  the normal mind can be diverted from the undesirable by a new or  stronger emotional stimulus. We found that the sole appeal to attention  in the baby-life is through the emotions, and that it is natural  throughout life for the mind to heed and follow the interesting; which  is only another way of saying that thinking follows where emotion leads,  unless volition steps in to prevent. The supreme test of the will's  power is its ability to hold the train of thought in the line that  reason directs, when feeling would draw it elsewhere. This ability marks  the man who does big things; while the inability to ever turn attention  away from the interests proposed by feeling assures weakness.    Some of the most charming people we shall ever know are those  temperamental children of happiness whose interests are naturally  wholesome and externalized, whose natures are spontaneous and joyous,  and who live as they feel, seemingly never knowing the stress of forced  concentration. With them attention follows feeling, feeling is sweet and  true, and volition simply carries out what feeling dictates. And life  may not be complicated.    But there is another class whose attention also follows in the ways of  least resistance; and life for them is a wallowing in the morbid and  unwholesome. In them feeling is perverted, they seem to see life  habitually through dark glasses; they passively attend to the sad, the  distressing, sometimes the gruesome and the horrible with a sort of  pallid joy in their own discolored images. The first group puts joy in  all they see, because they are brimming full of joy themselves. These  others find only the unwholesome in life because their minds are  storehouses of it. We say that each type has projected himself, that is,  has thrust himself out into the external world, and is standing back,  looking at his own nature and calling that the universe.    But neither of these two groups can long withstand the stress of a world  they only feel and have never attempted to comprehend. The irresponsibly  happy ones are too often crushed and broken when life proves to bring  loss and failure and disappointment; the morbid probably will cease some  day to enjoy their melancholic moods, and be unable to find their way  out of them. If both had learned to control attention, they might have  been saved. The happy, care-free child of the light is at desperate loss  when the sun he loves is obscured, if he has not learned to look upon  the far side of the clouds to find that there they glow golden with the  rays temporarily shut from him. Because clouds were not interesting to  him he never attended to them-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18845"],[0,"Seeing Europe with Famous Authors, Volume 7 (#15)"],[1,"its  great dome and some of its towers out of a sidelong valley, as if we  were between two great waves of the tumultuous sea of hills; while, far  beyond, rose in the distance the blue peaks of three or four of the  Apennines, just on the remote horizon. There being a haziness in the  atmosphere, however, Florence was little more distinct to us than the  Celestial City was to Christian and Hopeful, when they spied at it from  the Delectable Mountains.    Keeping steadfastly onward, we ascended a winding road, and passed a  grand villa, standing very high, and surrounded with extensive grounds.  It must be the residence of some great noble; and it has an avenue of  poplars or aspens, very light and gay, and fit for the passage of the  bridal procession, when the proprietor or his heir brings home his  bride; while in another direction from the same front of the palace  stretches an avenue or grove of cypresses, very long and exceedingly  black and dismal, like a train of gigantic mourners. I have seen few  things more striking, in the way of trees, than this grove of cypresses.    From this point we descended, and drove along an ugly, dusty avenue,  with a high brick wall on one side or both, till we reached the gate of  Florence, into which we were admitted with as little trouble as  custom-house officers, soldiers, and policemen can possibly give. They  did not examine our luggage, and even declined a fee, as we had already  paid one at the frontier custom-house. Thank heaven, and the Grand  Duke!    As we hoped that the Casa del Bello had been taken for us, we drove  thither in the first place, but found that the bargain had not been  concluded. As the house and studio of Mr. Powers[27] were just on the  opposite side of the street, I went to it, but found him too much  engrossed to see me at the moment; so I returned to the \"vettura,\" and  we told Gaetano to carry us to a hotel. He established us at the Albergo  della Fontana, a good and comfortable house. Mr. Powers called in the  evening--a plain personage, characterized by strong simplicity and warm  kindliness, with an impending brow, and large eyes, which kindle as he  speaks. He is gray, and slightly bald, but does not seem elderly, nor  past his prime. I accept him at once as an honest and trustworthy man,  and shall not vary from this judgment. Through his good offices, the  next day we engaged the Casa del Bello. This journey from Rome has been  one of the brightest and most uncareful interludes of my life; we have  all enjoyed it exceedingly, and I am happy that our children have it to  look back upon.          THE OLD PALACE AND THE LOGGIA[28]    BY THEOPHILE GAUTIER      Every great capital has its eye; at Rome it is the Campo Vaccino; at  Paris, the Boulevard des Italiens; at Venice, the Place St. Mark; at  Madrid, the Prado; at London, the Strand; at Naples, the Via di Toledo.  Rome is more Roman, Paris more Parisian, Venice more Venetian, Madrid  more Spanish, London more English, Naples more Neapolitan, in that  privileged locality than anywhere else. The eye of Florence is the Place  of the Grand Duke--a beautiful eye. In fact, suppress that Place and  Florence has no more meaning--it might be another city. It is at that  Place, therefore, that every traveler ought to begin, and, moreover, had  he not that intention, the tide of pedestrians would carry him and the  streets themselves would conduct him thither.    The first aspect of the Place of the Grand Duke has an effect so  charming, so picturesque, so complete, that you comprehend all at once  into what an error the modern capitals like London, Paris, St.  Petersburg, fall in forming, under the pretext of squares, in their  compact masses, immense empty spaces upon which they run aground all  possible and impossible modes of decoration. One can touch with his  finger the reason which makes of the Carrousel and Place de la Concorde,  great empty fields which absorb fountains, statues, arches of triumph,  obelisks, candelabra, and little gardens. All these embellishments, very  pretty on paper, very agreeable also, without doubt, viewed from a  balloon, are almost lost for the spectator who can not grasp the whole,  his height only rising five feet above the ground.    A square, in order to produce a beautiful effect, ought not to be too  big; it is also necessary that it should be bordered by varied monuments  of diverse elevations. The Place of the Grand Duke at Florence unites  all these conditions; bordered by monuments regular in themselves, but  different from one another, it is pleasing to the eye without wearying  by a cold symmetry.    The Palace of the Seigneurie, or Old Palace, which by its imposing mass  and severe elegance at first attracts the attention, occupies a corner  of the Place, instead of the middle. This idea, a happy one, in our  opinion, regrettable for those who only see architectural beauty in  geometrical regularity, is not fortuitous; it has a reason wholly  Florentine. In order to obtain perfect symmetry, it would have been  necessary to build upon the detested soil of the Ghibelline house,  rebellious and proscribed by the Uberti; something that the Guelph  faction, then all-powerful, were not willing to allow the architect,  Arnolfo di Lapo, to do. Learned men contest the truth of this tradition;  we will not discuss here the value of their objections. It is certain,  however, that the Old Palace gains greatly by the singularity of this  location and also leaves space for the great Fountain of Neptune and  the equestrian statue of Cosmo the First.    The name of fortress would be more appropriate than any other, for the  Old Palace; it is a great mass of stone, without columns, without  frontal, without order of architecture. Time has gilded the walls with  beautiful vermilion tints which the pure blue of the sky sets off  marvelously, and the whole structure has that haughty and romantic  aspect which accords well with the idea that one forms for oneself of  that old Palace of the Seigneurie, the witness, since the date of its  erection in the thirteenth century, of so many intrigues, tumults,  violent acts, and crimes. The battlements of the palace, cut square,  show that it was built to that height by the Guelph faction; the  trifurcated battlements of the belfry indicate a sudden change on the  accession to power of the Ghibelline faction.    Guelphs and Ghibellines detested each other so violently that they  exprest their opinions in their garments, in the cut of their hair, in  their arms, in their manner of fortifying themselves. They feared  nothing so much as to be captured by one another, and differed as much  as they possibly could. They had a special salutation after the manner  of the Freemasons and the Companions of Duty. The opinions of the  ancient owners of the Old Palace at Florence can be recognized by this  characteristic; the walls of the city are crenelated squarely in the  Guelph fashion, and the tower on the ramparts has the Ghibelline  battlements of swallow-tail shape.    The Vecchio Palace has for its basement several steps which were used in  former times as a species of tribune, from the top of which the  magistrates and demagogs harangued the people. Two colossal statues of  marble--Hercules slaying Cacus, by Bandinelli, and David the Conqueror  of Goliath, by Michael Angelo--mount near the door their age-long watch,  like two gigantic sentinels whom someone has forgotten to relieve. The  statue of David by Michael Angelo besides the inconvenience there is in  representing under a gigantic form a Biblical hero of notoriously small  size, seemed to us a trifle common and heavy, a rare defect with this  master; his David is a great big boy, fleshy, broad-backed, with  monstrous biceps, a market porter waiting to put a sack upon his back.  The working of the marble is remarkable and, after all, is a fine piece  of study which would do honor to any other sculptor except Michael  Angelo; but there is lacking that Olympian mastership which  characterizes the works of that superhuman sculptor.    One of the most curious features of the Old Palace is the grand salon, a  hall of enormous dimensions, which has its legend. When the Medici were  driven from Florence, in 1494, Fra Girolamo Savonarola, who directed the  popular movement, proposed the idea of constructing an immense hall  where a council of a thousand citizens would elect the magistrates and  regulate the affairs of the republic. The architect Cronaca had charge  of this task and acquitted himself of it with a celerity so marvelous  that Brother Savonarola caused the rumor to spread that angels  descended from heaven to help the masons and continued at night the  interrupted work. The invention of these angels tempering the mortar and  carrying the hod is all done in the legendary style of the Middle Ages  and would furnish a charming subject for a picture to some ingenuous  painter of the school of Overbeck or of Hauser. In this rapid  construction Cronaca displayed, if not all his genius, at least all his  agility. The work has been justly admired and often consulted by  architects.    When the Medici returned to power and transferred their residence from  the Palace of the Via Larga, which they had occupied, to the Palace of  the Seigneurie, Cosmo wished to change the Council Hall into an audience  chamber, and charged the presumptuous Bacchio Bandinelli, whose designs  had attracted him, with various alterations of an important character;  but the sculptor had undoubtedly presumed too much on his talent as an  architect, and in spite of the assistance of Giuliano Baccio d'Agnolo,  whom he called to his aid, he worked for ten years without being able to  conquer the difficulties which he had created for himself.    It was Vasari who raised the ceiling several feet, finished the work and  decorated the walls with a succession of frescoes which may still be  seen,"]]]
