Some of them, indeed reminded me of the Italian heads  which look out from the canvases of Titian--speaking of ambition or  craft, of care or of grief, with furrows in which the passions have  passed with iron ploughshare. These were the countenances of men who had  lived in struggle and conflict before the discovery of the latent forces  of vril had changed the character of society--men who had fought with  each other for power or fame as we in the upper world fight.    The type of face began to evince a marked change about a thousand years  after the vril revolution, becoming then, with each generation, more  serene, and in that serenity more terribly distinct from the faces of  labouring and sinful men; while in proportion as the beauty and the  grandeur of the countenance itself became more fully developed, the art  of the painter became more tame and monotonous.    But the greatest curiosity in the collection was that of three portraits  belonging to the pre-historical age, and, according to mythical  tradition, taken by the orders of a philosopher, whose origin and  attributes were as much mixed up with symbolical fable as those of an  Indian Budh or a Greek Prometheus.    From this mysterious personage, at once a sage and a hero, all the  principal sections of the Vril-ya race pretend to trace a common origin.    The portraits are of the philosopher himself, of his grandfather, and  great-grandfather. They are all at full length. The philosopher is  attired in a long tunic which seems to form a loose suit of scaly  armour, borrowed, perhaps, from some fish or reptile, but the feet and  hands are exposed: the digits in both are wonderfully long, and webbed.  He has little or no perceptible throat, and a low receding forehead, not  at all the ideal of a sage's. He has bright brown prominent eyes, a very  wide mouth and high cheekbones, and a muddy complexion. According to  tradition, this philosopher had lived to a patriarchal age, extending  over many centuries, and he remembered distinctly in middle life his  grandfather as surviving, and in childhood his great-grandfather; the  portrait of the first he had taken, or caused to be taken, while yet  alive--that of the latter was taken from his effigies in mummy.  The portrait of his grandfather had the features and aspect of the  philosopher, only much more exaggerated: he was not dressed, and the  colour of his body was singular; the breast and stomach yellow, the  shoulders and legs of a dull bronze hue: the great-grandfather was a  magnificent specimen of the Batrachian genus, a Giant Frog, 'pur et  simple.'    Among the pithy sayings which, according to tradition, the philosopher  bequeathed to posterity in rhythmical form and sententious brevity, this  is notably recorded: \"Humble yourselves, my descendants; the father of  your race was a 'twat' (tadpole): exalt yourselves, my descendants, for  it was the same Divine Thought which created your father that develops  itself in exalting you.\"    Aph-Lin told me this fable while I gazed on the three Batrachian  portraits. I said in reply: \"You make a jest of my supposed ignorance  and credulity as an uneducated Tish, but though these horrible daubs  may be of great antiquity, and were intended, perhaps, for some  rude caracature, I presume that none of your race even in the less  enlightened ages, ever believed that the great-grandson of a Frog became  a sententious philosopher; or that any section, I will not say of the  lofty Vril-ya, but of the meanest varieties of the human race, had its  origin in a Tadpole.\"    \"Pardon me,\" answered Aph-Lin: \"in what we call the Wrangling or  Philosophical Period of History, which was at its height about seven  thousand years ago, there was a very distinguished naturalist, who  proved to the satisfaction of numerous disciples such analogical and  anatomical agreements in structure between an An and a Frog, as to  show that out of the one must have developed the other. They had some  diseases in common; they were both subject to the same parasitical worms  in the intestines; and, strange to say, the An has, in his structure, a  swimming-bladder, no longer of any use to him, but which is a rudiment  that clearly proves his descent from a Frog. Nor is there any argument  against this theory to be found in the relative difference of size, for  there are still existent in our world Frogs of a size and stature not  inferior to our own, and many thousand years ago they appear to have  been still larger.\"    \"I understand that,\" said I, \"because Frogs this enormous are, according  to our eminent geologists, who perhaps saw them in dreams, said to have  been distinguished inhabitants of the upper world before the Deluge; and  such Frogs are exactly the creatures likely to have flourished in the  lakes and morasses of your subterranean regions. But pray, proceed.\"    \"In the Wrangling Period of History, whatever one sage asserted another  sage was sure to contradict. In fact, it was a maxim in that age, that  the human reason could only be sustained aloft by being tossed to and  fro in the perpetual motion of contradiction; and therefore another  sect of philosophers maintained the doctrine that the An was not the  descendant of the Frog, but that the Frog was clearly the improved  development of the An. The shape of the Frog, taken generally, was much  more symmetrical than that of the An; beside the beautiful conformation  of its lower limbs, its flanks and shoulders the majority of the Ana in  that day were almost deformed, and certainly ill-shaped. Again, the Frog  had the power to live alike on land and in water--a mighty privilege,  partaking of a spiritual essence denied to the An, since the disuse  of his swimming-bladder clearly proves his degeneration from a higher  development of species. Again, the earlier races of the Ana seem to  have been covered with hair, and, even to a comparatively recent date,  hirsute bushes deformed the very faces of our ancestors, spreading wild  over their cheeks and chins, as similar bushes, my poor Tish, spread  wild over yours. But the object of the higher races of the Ana through  countless generations has been to erase all vestige of connection with  hairy vertebrata, and they have gradually eliminated that debasing  capillary excrement by the law of sexual selection; the Gy-ei naturally  preferring youth or the beauty of smooth faces. But the degree of the  Frog in the scale of the vertebrata is shown in this, that he has  no hair at all, not even on his head. He was born to that hairless  perfection which the most beautiful of the Ana, despite the culture of  incalculable ages, have not yet attained. The wonderful complication and  delicacy of a Frog's nervous system and arterial circulation were shown  by this school to be more susceptible of enjoyment than our inferior, or  at least simpler, physical frame allows us to be. The examination of  a Frog's hand, if I may use that expression, accounted for its keener  susceptibility to love, and to social life in general. In fact,  gregarious and amatory as are the Ana, Frogs are still more so. In  short, these two schools raged against each other; one asserting the An  to be the perfected type of the Frog; the other that the Frog was the  highest development of the An. The moralists were divided in  opinion with the naturalists, but the bulk of them sided with the  Frog-preference school. They said, with much plausibility, that in moral  conduct (viz., in the adherence to rules best adapted to the health and  welfare of the individual and the community) there could be no doubt  of the vast superiority of the Frog. All history showed the wholesale  immorality of the human race, the complete disregard, even by the  most renowned amongst them, of the laws which they acknowledged to be  essential to their own and the general happiness and wellbeing. But the  severest critic of the Frog race could not detect in their manners a  single aberration from the moral law tacitly recognised by themselves.  And what, after all, can be the profit of civilisation if superiority in  moral conduct be not the aim for which it strives, and the test by which  its progress should be judged?    \"In fine, the adherents of this theory presumed that in some remote  period the Frog race had been the improved development of the Human; but  that, from some causes which defied rational conjecture, they had not  maintained their original position in the scale of nature; while the  Ana, though of inferior organisation, had, by dint less of their virtues  than their vices, such as ferocity and cunning, gradually acquired  ascendancy, much as among the human race itself tribes utterly barbarous  have, by superiority in similar vices, utterly destroyed or reduced  into insignificance tribes originally excelling them in mental gifts  and culture. Unhappily these disputes became involved with the religious  notions of that age; and as society was then administered under the  government of the Koom-Posh, who, being the most ignorant, were of  course the most inflammable class--the multitude took the whole question  out of the hands of the philosophers; political chiefs saw that the  Frog dispute, so taken up by the populace, could become a most valuable  instrument of their ambition; and for not less than one thousand years  war and massacre prevailed, during which period the philosophers on both  sides were butchered, and the government of Koom-Posh itself was happily  brought to an end by the ascendancy of a family that clearly established  its descent from the aboriginal tadpole, and furnished despotic rulers  to the various nations of the Ana. These despots finally disappeared, at  least from our communities, as the discovery of vril led "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19511"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: Wimborne Minster and Christchurch Priory (#15)"],[1," discovered traces of an external chantry and the marks  of an arcading corresponding to that still remaining on the inside.    [Illustration: THE SOUTH AISLE OF NAVE.]    The object of the chamber above the Lady Chapel is uncertain,--in  1617 it is described as \"St Michael's Loft,\" in 1666 the parishioners  described it as \"heretofore a chapter-house,\" when petitioning the  bishop to allow it to be used as a school. But if it was ever used as  a chapter-house, it could only have been for a short time, as there is  evidence that there was a chapter-house to the south side of the choir  in the twelfth century, and that this remained as late as 1498. The  south side of the Lady Chapel and choir correspond very closely with the  north side, but there are several differences to be noticed between the  south and north transepts. On the eastern side of the #South Transept#  the Norman apsidal chapel still remains. This has a semi-conical roof  with chevron table moulding under it, and two windows--one of original  Norman work, the other a three-light Early English window. A sacristy  of Early English date stands to the east of the apsidal chapel, and  occupies the space between the apse and the south choir wall. At the  south-east corner of the transept there is a circular stair turret  corresponding to some extent with the turret at the north-east angle  of the north transept; this, in the second stage, becomes octagonal in  section, and rises above the parapet of the transept. In the south face  is a depressed segmental window, much smaller than the corresponding  window on the north side, under a gabled parapet. The pitch of the roof  of the south transept is much higher than that of the north transept,  and the upper part of the transept does not abut against the walls of  the church. Two tiers of corbel brackets on the south wall, and traces  of two Norman windows seem to indicate that here, as elsewhere, a slype,  with a room above it, intervened between the south end of the transept  and the chapter-house. This slype was generally a passage connecting the  cloister garth with the smaller garth to the south of the choir which  was often used as a burying-place for the abbots or priors, as the case  may be, and was the place where the monks or canons interviewed visitors  and chapmen. The room above was often used as the library. The south of  the #Nave# is decidedly inferior in interest to the north. The cloisters  have entirely disappeared, but a series of round-headed arches, formed  of stucco, may conceal a stone arcading similar to that hidden by the  Early English facing of the north wall. The small round-headed windows  giving light to the triforium are more regularly arranged than on the  north side; there is one, and only one, in each division between the  buttresses. There were, as usual, two doors in this wall: one for the  canons, in the wall opposite to the west of the cloister, one close to  the transept for the prior; both are now blocked up. The prior's door,  in the injunction of Langton, 1498, is directed to be kept locked, save  when on festivals a procession passed through it. This doorway is of  early thirteenth-century work; it is round-headed, and is French in  character. There is a legend that a party of French monks, terrified  by a dragon which rose out of the sea, possibly an ancestor of the  sea-serpent of more modern days, put in to Christchurch haven, and were  entertained by the canons, with whom they abode for many years; possibly  this door may be of their workmanship or design. In the south wall a  large aumbry or cupboard, in the thickness of the walls, may be seen;  in this possibly the canons kept the books that they had brought from  the library for study. What the windows in this aisle were we cannot  say--originally, no doubt, Norman, for the westernmost window is still  of this style; but the others, which were widened either in Early  English or Decorated times, are now all filled with nineteenth-century  tracery of Decorated type. The buttresses between the windows, unlike  those on the north side, are flat Norman ones. Towards the west end of  the aisle a passage has in modern times been cut through the wall, and  when this was done remains of a staircase which, no doubt, led to the  dormitory, were discovered. The clerestory, on this side, is of the same  plain character as on the north side.    In a line with the south wall, but some little distance to the west,  still stands a house which was once the porter's lodge, close to the  site of the gatehouse. The porter's lodge was built by Prior Draper  II. in the sixteenth century. The remains of the domestic buildings are  very scanty--some old walls near the modern mill, occupying, no doubt,  the site of the mill where the canons' corn was ground; some vestiges  of the fish ponds; some few traces of walls and foundations, are all  that have come down to modern days. From the similarity of arrangement  in the buildings of religious houses, however, we can, with great  certainty, assign the sites for the various parts--the dormitory over  the cellarage, to the west of the cloister garth; the refectory to south  of it; the calefactory, chapter-house, slype, to the east; and the  prior's lodgings to the south of the choir, forming the lesser garth;  the barns, bakery, and brew-house to the south-west of the church,  near the porter's lodge and gatehouse. The prior had a country house  at Heron Court, a grange at Somerford, and another at St Austin's, near  Lymington. It must be understood that the choir was the church of the  canons, and, as was common in churches served by Augustinian canons, the  nave was used for the services which the laity of the district attended.    It is noteworthy that whether owing to the purity of the air, so  different from that which exists in the large cities where so many of  the cathedral churches stand, or from the goodness of the stone, most of  the Priory Church is in most excellent preservation. Carving which, we  are assured, has never been retouched with a chisel since it was first  cut, remains as sharp and clearly cut as though it were the work of  the nineteenth century; possibly some of its excellence is due to the  preservative effect of the whitewash with which it was once covered, and  which has been cleaned off with water and a stiff bristled brush.    The stone of which the north side of the nave is built came from  Binstead; the limestone columns from Henden Hill; the Norman round  turret and the choir is built of Portland stone; while Purbeck marble  shafts are used in the north porch, and of the fine white stone from  Caen in Normandy, the Salisbury and Draper chantries in the interior  are constructed. These, though now about four hundred years old, are  absolutely sharp in all the carving. There is a tombstone to the north  of the porch which bears a curious inscription as follows:--\"We were  not slayne but raysd, raysd not to life but to be byried twice by men  of strife. What rest could the living have when dead had none agree  amongst you heere we ten are one. Hen. Rogers died Aprill 17 1641.\"  This inscription has been variously explained. It is said by some that  Cromwell, afterwards Protector, was at Christchurch, and dug up some  lead coffins to make bullets for his soldiers, and flung the bodies out  of ten such coffins into one grave; but this is manifestly incorrect.  Oliver Cromwell was never at Christchurch, though Thomas Cromwell  probably was, and here, as elsewhere, the two have been confounded.  In many cases poor Oliver has had to bear the blame for destruction  caused to churches by his less well-known namesake, the great destroyer  of religious houses in the days of the eighth Henry. But neither of  them had anything to do with this tomb, nor were the Parliamentary  forces guilty of tampering with the coffins of the dead in the parish  burying-ground at Christchurch. The very date precludes the idea, for  the civil war did not begin till more than fifteen months after the  date carved on this stone; and we may give the Roundheads credit for  more sense than to be digging up coffins to make their bullets with,  when there was abundance of lead to be had for the stripping on the roof  of the Priory Church. A far more probable explanation is that which  states that the ten bodies here interred were those of ten shipwrecked  sailors, who were first buried on the cliffs near the spot where they  were washed ashore; but the lord of the manor, when he heard thereof,  waxed exceeding wroth, and a strife ensued between him and one Henry  Rogers, Mayor of Christchurch, the former insisting on their removal to  consecrated ground, the latter objecting to the removal, probably on the  ground of expense; but in the end the lord of the manor had his way. But  the mayor, to save the cost of ten separate graves, had them all buried  in one, and placed this inscription over their remains as a protest  against the conduct of the lord of the manor in moving their remains  from their first resting-place.    The graveyard at the present time is neatly kept and well cared  for. The headstones have not, as they have been in many other  places, tampered with; and though many of the alterations made in the  restoration will not gain the approval of archaeologists, yet some have  been judiciously done, and some that are in contemplation will certainly  have the result of rendering once more visible beautiful mediaeval work,  long concealed by ugly modern additions.          CHAPTER III    THE INTERIOR      A rapid walk round the interior of the Priory Church shows that it  practically consists of three main portions, almost entirely divided  from each other--the #Nave#, the #Choir#, and the #Lady Chapel#. The  solid rood screen, pierced by one narrow doorway, forms an effectual  division between the nave and choir, while the stone reredos and the  wall above it, running"]]]
