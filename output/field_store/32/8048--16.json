And then it is in the company of others, his  colleagues, that his work has to be done.  Consequently patience, good  temper, fairness, unselfishness are qualities be will do well to  cultivate, and he will lose nothing, rather gain, by the exercise of  them.  The selfish actor is not a popular person, and, in my  experience, not as a rule a successful one.  \"Give and take,\" in this  little world of the theatre, and you will be no losers by it.    Learn to bear failure and criticism patiently.  They are part of the  actor's lot in life.  Critics are rarely animated by any personal  hostility in what they may write about you, though I confess that when  one reads an unfavourable criticism, one is inclined to set it down to  anything but one's own deserving.  I heard a great actor once say that  we should never read criticisms of ourselves till a week after they  were written--admirable counsel--but I confess I have not yet reached  that pitch of self-restraint that would enable me to overcome my  curiosity for seven days.  It is, however, a state of equanimity to  look forward to.  In the meantime, content yourself with the  recollection that ridicule and damning criticism have been the lot at  some time in their lives of the most famous actors and actresses, that  the unfavourable verdict of to-day may be reversed to-morrow.  It is  no good resenting failure; turn it to account rather; try to  understand it, and learn something from it.  The uses of theatrical  adversity may not be sweet, but rightly understood they may be very  salutary.    Do not let failure make you despond.  Ours is a calling of ups and  downs; it is an advantage of its uncertainty that you never know what  may happen next; the darkest hour may he very near the dawn.  This is  where Bohemianism, in the best sense of the term, will serve the  actor.  I do not mean by Bohemianism chronic intemperance and  insolvency.  I mean the gay spirit of daring and enterprise that  greets failure as graciously as success; the love of your own calling  and your comrades in that calling, a love that, no matter what your  measure of success, will ever remain constant and enduring; the  recognition of the fact that as an actor you but consult your own  dignity in placing your own calling as a thing apart, in leading such  a life as the necessities of that calling may demand; and choosing  your friends among those who regard you for yourself, not those to  whom an actor is a social puppet, to be taken up and dropped as he  happens for the moment to be more or less prominent in the public eye.  If this kind of Bohemianism has some root in your character, you will  find the changes and chances of your calling the easier to endure.        FAILURE AND SUCCESS    Do not despond in failure, neither be over-exalted by success.  Remember one success is as nothing in the history of an actor's  career; he has to make many before he can lay claim to any measure of  fame; and over-confidence, an inability to estimate rightly the value  of a passing triumph, has before now harmed incalculably many an actor  or actress.  You will only cease to learn your business when you quit  it; look on success as but another lesson learnt to be turned to  account in learning the next.  The art of the actor is no less  difficult, no less long in comparison with life, than any other art.  In the intoxicating hour of success let this chastening thought have  some place in your recollection.    When you begin work as actors or actresses, play whenever you can and  whatever you can.  Remember that the great thing for the actor is to  be seen as often as possible, to be before the public as much as he  can, no matter how modest the part, how insignificant the production.  It is only when an actor has reached a position very secure in the  public esteem that he can afford, or that it may be his duty, to be  careful as to what he undertakes.  But before such a time is reached  his one supreme object must be to get himself known to the public, to  let them see his work under all conditions, until they find something  to identify as peculiarly his own; he should think nothing too small  or unimportant to do, too tiresome or laborious to undergo.  Work well  and conscientiously done must attract attention; there is a great deal  of lolling and idleness among the many thoughtless and indifferent  persons who drift on to the stage as the last refuge of the negligent  or incompetent.    The stage will always attract a certain number of worthless recruits  because it is so easy to get into the theatre somehow or other; there  is no examination to be passed, no qualification to be proved before a  person is entitled to call himself an actor.  And then the life of an  actor is unfortunately, in these days of long runs, one that lends  itself to a good deal of idleness and waste of time, unless a man or  woman be very determined to employ their spare time profitably.  For  this reason, I should advise any actor, or actress, to cultivate some  rational hobby or interest by the side of their work; for until the  time comes for an actor to assume the cares and labours of management,  he must have a great deal of time on his hands that can be better  employed than in hanging about clubs or lolling in drawing-rooms.  At  any rate, the actor or actress who thinks no work too small to do, and  to do to the utmost of his or her ability, who neglects no opportunity  that may be turned to account--and every line he or she speaks is an  opportunity--must outstrip those young persons who, though they may be  pleased to call themselves actors and actresses, never learn to regard  the theatre as anything but a kind of enlarged back-drawing-room, in  which they are invited to amuse themselves at an altogether inadequate  salary.    In regard to salary, when you start in your profession, do not make  salary your first consideration; do not suffer a few shillings or a  pound or two to stand between you and work.  This is a consideration  you may keep well in mind, even when you have achieved some measure of  success.  Apart from the natural tendency of the individual to place a  higher value on his services than that attached to them by others, it  is often well to take something less than you ask, if the work offered  you is useful.  Remember that the public judge you by your work, they  know nothing and care little about what is being paid you for doing  it.  To some people their own affairs are of such supreme importance  that they cannot believe that their personal concerns are unknown to,  and unregarded by, the outside world.  The intensely personal,  individual character of the actor's work is bound to induce a certain  temptation to an exaggerated egotism.  We are all egotists, and it is  right that we should be, up to a point.  But I would urge the young  actor or actress to be always on the watch against developing,  especially in success, an extreme egotism which induces a selfishness  of outlook, an egregious vanity that in the long run weakens the  character, induces disappointment and discontent, and bores to  extinction other persons.    I would not for one moment advise an actor never to talk \"shop\"; it is  a great mistake to think that men and women should never talk in  public or private about the thing to which they devote their lives;  people, as a rule, are most interesting on the subject of their own  particular business in life.  Talk about the affairs of the theatre  within reason, and with due regard to the amenities of polite  conversation, but do not confuse the affairs of the theatre, broadly  speaking, with your own.  The one is lasting, general; the other  particular and fleeting.  \"_Il n'y a pas de l'homme necessaire_\" [No  man is indispensable].  Many persons would be strangely surprised if  they could see how rapidly their place is filled after they are gone,  no matter how considerable their achievement.  It may not be filled in  the same way, as well, as fittingly, but it will be filled, and  humanity will content itself very fairly well with the substitute.  This is especially true of the work of the actor.  He can but live as  a memory, and memory is proverbially short.        ELLEN TERRY    [In the autumn of 1883, during Henry Irving's fist engagement in New  York, Ellen Terry played a round of characters as his leading lady.  In the _Tribune_, Mr. William Winter said:  \"Miss Ellen Terry's Portia  is delicious.  Her voice is perfect music.  Her clear, bell-like  elocution is more than a refreshment, it is a luxury.  Her simple  manner, always large and adequate, is a great beauty of the art which  it so deftly conceals.  Her embodiment of a woman's loveliness, such  as, in Portia, should he at once stately and fascinating and inspire  at once respect and passion, was felicitous beyond the reach of  descriptive phrases.\"  Then, on her appearance in \"Much Ado About  Nothing:\" \"She permeates the raillery of Beatrice with an  indescribable charm of mischievous sweetness.  The silver arrows of  her pungent wit have no barb, for evidently she does not mean that  they shall really wound.  Her appearance and carriage are beautiful,  and her tones melt into music.  There is no hint of the virago here,  and even the tone of sarcasm is superficial.  It is archness playing  over kindness that is presented here.\"  On her Ophelia, Mr. Winter  remarks: \"Ophelia is an image, or personification of innocent,  delirious, feminine youth and beauty, and she passes before us in the  two stages of sanity and delirium.  The embodiment is fully within  Miss Terry's reach, and is one of the few unmistakably perfect  creations with which dramatic art has illumined literature and adorned  the stage.\"    By permission the following pages have been taken from \"Ellen Terry's  Memoirs,\" copyright by the S.

They  probably meant to go back to the women at Mamohela, who fed them in the  absence of their husbands. They were told by Mohamad that they must not  follow his people, and he gave orders to bind them, and send them back  if they did. They think that no punishment will reach them whatever they  do: they are freemen, and need not work or do anything but beg.  \"English,\" they call themselves, and the Arabs fear them, though the  eagerness with which they engaged in slave-hunting showed them to be  genuine niggers.    _20th October, 1870._--The first heavy rain of this season fell  yesterday afternoon. It is observable that the permanent halt to which  the Manyuema have come is not affected by the appearance of superior men  among them: they are stationary, and improvement is unknown. Moenekuss  paid smiths to teach his sons, and they learned to work in copper and  iron, but he never could get them to imitate his own generous and  obliging deportment to others; he had to reprove them perpetually for  mean shortsightedness, and when he died he virtually left no successor,  for his sons are both narrowminded, mean, shortsighted creatures,  without dignity or honour. All they can say of their forefathers is that  they came from Lualaba up Luamo, then to Luelo, and thence here. The  name seems to mean \"forest people\"--_Manyuema_.    The party under Hassani crossed the Logumba at Kanyingere's, and went  N. and N.N.E. They found the country becoming more and more mountainous,  till at last, approaching Morere, it was perpetually up and down. They  slept at a village on the top, and could send for water to the bottom  only once, it took so much time to descend and ascend. The rivers all  flowed into Kerere or Lower Tanganyika. There is a hot fountain whose  water could not be touched nor stones stood upon. The Balegga were very  unfriendly, and collected in thousands. \"We come to buy ivory,\" said  Hassani, \"and if there is none we go away.\" \"Nay,\" shouted they, \"you  come to die here!\" and then they shot with arrows; when musket-balls  were returned they fled, and would not come to receive the captives.    _25th October, 1870._--Bambarre. In this journey I have endeavoured to  follow with unswerving fidelity the line of duty. My course has been an  even one, turning neither to the right hand nor to the left, though my  route has been tortuous enough. All the hardship, hunger, and toil were  met with the full conviction that I was right in persevering to make a  complete work of the exploration of the sources of the Nile. Mine has  been a calm, hopeful endeavour to do the work that has been given me to  do, whether I succeed or whether I fail. The prospect of death in  pursuing what I knew to be right did not make me veer to one side or the  other. I had a strong presentiment during the first three years that I  should never live through the enterprise, but it weakened as I came near  to the end of the journey, and an eager desire to discover any evidence  of the great Moses having visited these parts bound me, spell-bound me,  I may say, for if I could bring to light anything to confirm the Sacred  Oracles, I should not grudge one whit all the labour expended. I have to  go down the Central Lualaba or Webb's Lake River, then up the Western or  Young's Lake River to Katanga head waters and then retire. I pray that  it may be to my native home.    Syde bin Habib, Dugumbe, Juma Merikano, Abdullah Masendi are coming in  with 700 muskets, and an immense store of beads, copper, &c. They will  cross Lualaba and trade west of it: I wait for them because they may  have letters for me.    _28th October, 1870._--Moenemokata, who has travelled further than most  Arabs, said to me, \"If a man goes with a good-natured, civil tongue, he  may pass through the worst people in Africa unharmed:\" this is true, but  time also is required: one must not run through a country, but give the  people time to become acquainted with you, and let their first fears  subside.    _29th October, 1870._--The Manyuema buy their wives from each other; a  pretty girl brings ten goats. I saw one brought home to-day; she came  jauntily with but one attendant, and her husband walking behind. They  stop five days, then go back and remain other five days at home: then  the husband fetches her again. Many are pretty, and have perfect forms  and limbs.    _31st October, 1870._--Monangoi, of Luamo, married to the sister of  Moenekuss, came some time ago to beg that Kanyingere might be attacked  by Mohamad's people: no fault has he, \"but he is bad.\" Monangoi, the  chief here, offered two tusks to effect the same thing; on refusal, he  sends the tusks to Katomba, and may get his countryman spoiled by him.  \"He is bad,\" is all they can allege as a reason. Meantime this chief  here caught a slave who escaped, a prisoner from Moene-mokia's, and sold  him or her to Moene-mokia for thirty spears and some knives; when asked  about this captive, he said, \"She died:\" it was simply theft, but he  does not consider himself bad.    _2nd November, 1870._--The plain without trees that flanks the Lualaba  on the right bank, called Mbuga, is densely peopled, and the  inhabitants are all civil and friendly. From fifty to sixty large canoes  come over from the left bank daily to hold markets; these people too  \"are good,\" but the dwellers in the Metamba or dense forest are  treacherous and murder a single person without scruple: the dead body is  easily concealed, while on the plain all would become aware of it.    I long with intense desire to move on and finish my work, I have also an  excessive wish to find anything that may exist proving the visit of the  great Moses and the ancient kingdom of Tirhaka, but I pray give me just  what pleases Thee my Lord, and make me submissive to Thy will in all  things.    I received information about Mr. Young's search trip up the Shire and  Nyassa only in February 1870, and now take the first opportunity of  offering hearty thanks in a despatch to Her Majesty's Government, and  all concerned in kindly inquiring after my fate.    Musa and his companions were fair average specimens for heartlessness  and falsehood of the lower classes of Mohamadans in East Africa. When we  were on the Shire we used to swing the ship into mid-stream every night,  in order to let the air which was put in motion by the water, pass from  end to end. Musa's brother-in-law stepped into the water one morning, in  order to swim off for a boat, and was seized by a crocodile, the poor  fellow held up his hand imploringly, but Musa and the rest allowed him  to perish. On my denouncing his heartlessness, Musa-replied, \"Well, no  one tell him go in there.\" When at Senna a slave woman was seized by a  crocodile: four Makololo rushed in unbidden, and rescued her, though  they knew nothing about her: from long intercourse with both Johanna men  and Makololo I take these incidents as typical of the two races. Those  of mixed blood possess the vices of both races, and the virtues of  neither.    A gentleman of superior abilities[10] has devoted life and fortune to  elevate the Johanna men, but fears that they are \"an unimprovable race.\"    The Sultan of Zanzibar, who knows his people better than any stranger,  cannot entrust any branch of his revenue to even the better class of his  subjects, but places all his customs, income, and money affairs, in the  hands of Banians from India, and his father did before him.    When the Mohamadan gentlemen of Zanzibar are asked \"why their sovereign  places all his pecuniary affairs and fortune in the hands of aliens?\"  they frankly avow that if he allowed any Arab to farm his customs, he  would receive nothing but a crop of lies.    Burton had to dismiss most of his people at Ujiji for dishonesty:  Speke's followers deserted at the first approach of danger. Musa fled in  terror on hearing a false report from a half-caste Arab about the  Mazitu, 150 miles distant, though I promised to go due west, and not  turn to the north till far past the beat of that tribe. The few  liberated slaves with whom I went on had the misfortune to be Mohamadan  slaves in boyhood, but did fairly till we came into close contact with  Moslems again. A black Arab was released from a twelve years' bondage by  Casembe, through my own influence and that of the Sultan's letter: we  travelled together for a time, and he sold the favours of his female  slaves to my people for goods which he perfectly well knew were stolen  from me. He received my four deserters, and when I had gone off to Lake  Bangweolo with only four attendants, the rest wished to follow, but he  dissuaded them by saying that I had gone into a country where there was  war: he was the direct cause of all my difficulties with these liberated  slaves, but judged by the East African Moslem standard, as he ought to  be, and not by ours, he isa very good man, and I did not think it  prudent to come to a rupture with the old blackguard.    \"Laba\" means in the Manyuema dialect \"medicine;\" a charm, \"boganga:\"  this would make Lualaba mean the River of Medicine or charms. Hassani  thought that it meant \"great,\" because it seemed to mean flowing greatly  or grandly.    Casembe caught all the slaves that escaped from Mohamad, and placed them  in charge of Fungafunga; so there is little hope for fugitive slaves so  long as Casembe lives: this act is to the Arabs very good: he is very  sensible, and upright besides.    _3rd November, 1870._--Got a Kondohondo, the large double-billed  Hornbill (the _Buceros cristata_), Kakomira, of the Shire, and the  Sassassa of Bambarre. It is good eating, and has fat of an orange tinge,  like that of the zebra; I keep the bill to make a spoon of it.    An ambassador at Stamboul or Constantinople was shown a hornbill spoon,  and asked if it were really the bill "]]]
