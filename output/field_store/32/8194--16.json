The death of Otho III. in 1002 did not affect materially the steady  advance of monastic art. Bamberg, St. Gall, Corvey, Luxeuil, Bobbio,  Monte Cassino continued their accustomed labours. Under the Capetian  Kings the French foundations maintained the reputations they had won  during the Carolingian times, while others were added from time to time  throughout the Rhineland, Limousin, and the South of France, where the  Romanesque or Byzantine tastes had not yet penetrated, and whose work  therefore remained distinct from that of Italy and the German Empire.    Henry II. and the Empress Cunigunda made Bamberg the great centre of  German art, and it is to Bamberg, St. Gall, Luxeuil, Monte Cassino, and  Magdeburg that we have to look for the finest productions of the  eleventh century. Among the earlier works of the Othonian period we may  mention the famous Gospel-book executed for the minister of Otho II.,  Egbert, Archbishop of Trèves, and known as the Codex Egberti. It was  written in 980 at Reichenau on the Lake of Constance (or Bodensee, as it  is locally known) by two monks, Kerald and Heribert, whose dwarfish  figures appear beneath that of the archbishop on the frontispiece. It  contains fifty-seven illuminations and several folios of violet  parchment with golden ornaments and lettering. But its pictures are  rather remarkable, mostly the figures are too short and the limbs and  extremities badly drawn, but in some of the statelier personages the  error is reversed and they are too tall--this seems to be owing to Greek  influence, while the Byzantine taste shows itself in the treatment of  the border-foliages. Beasts are unnatural--demons and swine are alike,  both in form and colour (Pub. Lib., Trèves).    An Evangeliary, formerly in the Cathedral Treasury at Bamberg, but now  in the Royal Library at Munich (Cimel. 58), is a good example of the  kind of work that at first glance appears to be actually Carolingian  both in the figures, attitudes, and treatment of drapery, but which on  closer examination proves to be really due to the reign of Otho II. In  this MS. the beginning of St. Matthew contains four medallions--two of  Henry I. (the Fowler), one of Otho I., his son, and another of his  grandson, Otho II. (Nat. Lib., Paris, Lat. 8851).    A still more notable MS. is kept in the Munich Library (Cimel. 58),  containing a two-paged picture of tributary cities bringing gifts to the  Emperor Otho III. In the painting in this MS., notwithstanding the  exaggerated solemnity of expression, the faces are well drawn and the  features carefully modelled. The painting is in the Greek manner, as is  also the general character of the draperies. The small, ill-drawn feet  are by no means comparable with the heads.    The Imperial crown is square, like those of the Magi in the Bremen MS.  now in the Library of Brussels, or like that of Baldwin as Emperor of  Constantinople. In the several enthronements which occur among the  Imperial miniatures at Munich there are important and significant  differences which might not be noticed unless pointed out.    The changes in the shape and treatment of the orb, for instance, mean  more than a mere advance in enrichment, or an improvement in artistic  skill. The difference indicates a change in political usage. In the  miniature of Charles it does not occur at all; in that of Otho III. it  is a mere symbol; in that of Henry II. it is the actual emblem of  sovereignty presented by the Pope to the Emperor, to be held by the  latter in token of his investiture.    It was Selden's opinion that the orb, surmounted by the cross, never  appears in western art until the time of Henry II. Thus it is here one  of the many seemingly insignificant details which, in the miniature art  of the Middle Ages, contribute to the elucidation of History.          CHAPTER XV    FRANCONIAN ILLUMINATION    The later Saxon schools--Bernward of Hildesheim--Tuotilo and Hartmut of  St. Gallen--Portrait of Henry II. in MS. 40 at Munich--Netherlandish and  other work compared--Alleged deterioration of work under the Franconian  Emperors not true--Bad character of the eleventh century as to  art--Example to the contrary.      The MS. just referred to (Munich, Cimel. 58) brings us most probably to  the time of the third. Otho, but it is really with his father's marriage  to the Princess Theophano that the great revival in the arts began, and  the names of St. Bruno of Cologne and Augsburg, Gerbert, Bernward of  Hildesheim, Tuotilo, Salomon, Hartmut, Folchard, and Sintramn of St.  Gallen, are, as it were, points of light and centres of expanding  circles of artistic skill. Bruno and Gerbert are too well known to need  any further remark. Bernward of Hildesheim, made bishop there in 992 by  Theophano, and tutor to her son Otho III., \"excelled no less in the  mechanical than in the liberal arts. He was an excellent penman, a good  painter, and as a household manager was unequalled.\" Such is Tangmar's  tribute to his pupil's character. He was, indeed, an enthusiast in  painting, mosaic, and metal-work, and used to collect all the objects of  art he could lay hands on, to form a museum or studio for the  instruction of a class of art students and workmen. The collection was  formed mainly out of the numerous presents brought to the young Emperor  from foreign, and especially Greek and Oriental, princes, and contained  many examples of beautiful metal-work and Greek illumination. His own  Cathedral of Hildesheim was supplied with jewelled service-books, in  part at least the work of his own hand. The chalices and incense-burners  and the massive golden corona or candelabrum of the cathedral were also  the productions of his own workshops. The mural paintings, too, were  executed by himself. His handiwork, so lovingly described by his old  schoolmaster Tangmar, may still be seen in Hildesheim, where visitors to  that quaint old Saxon city are told that the bronze gates of the  cathedral and the jewelled crucifix were placed there by the venerable  bishop himself in 1015, while in the cathedral-close rises a column  adorned with bronze reliefs from the Life of Christ, authoritatively  declared to be the work of his own hands--let us say they came out of  his own workshops, in the year 1022, nearly a thousand years ago. St.  Bernward was canonised by Celestine III. in 1194. His sarcophagus is in  the crypt of the Basilica of St. Michael at Hildesheim. Of Tuotilo, the  pupil of Moengall (or Marcellus), it is said that he was physically  almost a giant; just the man, says his biographer, that you would choose  for a wrestler. He was a good speaker, had a fine musical voice, was a  capital carver in wood, and an accomplished illuminator. Like most of  the earlier monks of St. Gallen, he was a clever musician, equally  skilful with the trumpet and the harp. And the charm about it all was  that he was always cheerful and in excellent spirits, and in consequence  a general favourite. Nor is this all. Besides being teacher of music in  the upper school to the sons of the nobility, he was classical tutor,  and could preach both in Latin and Greek. His chief accomplishments,  however, were music and painting, and on these his reputation mainly  rests. He composed songs, which, like an Irish bard, he sang to the  harp--the popular instrument of this Irish foundation. Being thus  multifariously accomplished (he was, by the way, an excellent boxer), he  was much in request, and by the permission of his abbot travelled to  distant places. One of his celebrated sculptures was the image of the  Blessed Virgin for the cathedral at Metz, said to be quite a  masterpiece. Nay, he was even a mathematician and astronomer, and  constructed an astrolabe or orrery, which showed the courses of the  planets.    This allusion to the astrolabe reminds us that it was Abbat Hartmut of  St. Gallen, who was also an accomplished illuminator, who constructed a  large map of the world--one of the extremely few that until that time  the world had ever seen.    St. Gallen and its artists, however, must not be permitted to monopolise  our attention too long. The reader must for the rest refer to Dr. Rahn  and the writers whom he quotes. Sometimes it is said that the  illuminations of the eleventh century are proofs of the rapid decline of  art, and to demonstrate the fact that they are frankly hideous, some  writers bring forward instances such as the miniatures of a Missal,  especially a Crucifixion, said to be at Paris,[22] and a MS. at Berlin  said to have been executed in the earlier days of the Franconian dynasty  (1034-1125) containing another Crucifixion, which, though not quite so  horrible as the one just referred to, is sufficiently bad. These  miniatures are irredeemably barbaric and not in any sense typical of the  age. Such examples, in fact, can be found in any age and in any country.  Were they really representative of the best art of the time, there might  be an excuse for their reproduction, but they are not, and therefore no  reliance can be placed on their evidence.    [22] _Le Livre, etc._, par M.P. Louisy, Paris, 1886, 8°, p. 79.    In the miniatures of MSS. executed for the Othos and Henrys of the early  Saxon dynasty the worst they can be charged with, as compared with the  periods before and after them, is slavish imitation. The portrait of  Henry II. (Saint Henry, husband of Cunegunda) in MS. 40 at Munich is by  no means barbaric--it is more Greek than anything else--but it is down  to the smallest element of composition a direct imitation of the similar  portrait of Charles the Bald in the Emmeram Gospels. It is not a copy,  for there is a significant difference in the attitudes of the emperors.

The epiglottis, the false vocal cords, the true vocal  cords, and the thyro-arytenoid muscles are attached to the interior  anterior surface of the thyroid in this order from above down.    The false vocal bands have no direct function in phonation. _The whole  larynx, so far as phonation is concerned, may be said to exist for the  true vocal bands._ They are attached close together to the internal  and anterior surface of the thyroid in front and to the lower anterior  angles (vocal processes) of the arytenoids behind. Between the false  vocal bands above and the true vocal bands below there is a cavity  (the ventricle of Morgagni). The false vocal bands are protective, and  approximate closely during coughing, swallowing, etc.    It is very important to note that the arytenoid cartilages move freely  on their base, swivel-like, so that nearly all the changes effected in  the movements and tension of the vocal bands are brought about through  alterations in the position of these cartilages; and this implies that  all the muscles concerned are attached to them. From above down, in  front, the order of structures is as follows:         Hyoid bone.       Membrane.       Thyroid cartilage.       Membrane.       Cricoid cartilage.       Trachea.    The hyoid bone is not a part of the larynx, but from it the larynx is  suspended. The bone itself gives attachment to the muscles of the  tongue. The glottis is the chink between the true vocal bands.    The muscles of the larynx may be divided into the following: (1) Those  that open and those that close the glottis; (2) those which regulate  the tension of the vocal bands. The latter include the (_a_)  crico-thyroids, which tense and elongate them, (_b_) thyro-arytenoids,  which relax and shorten them. The crico-thyroid may be considered the  most important muscle of phonation, because it is so much used and so  effective. By its action the cricoid is pulled up in front and down  behind, so that the arytenoids are drawn back, and thus the vocal  bands tensed and lengthened. The lateral crico-arytenoids and the  thyro-arytenoids have the opposite effect--_i.e._, they relax and  shorten the vocal bands; hence when they come into play a new register  begins. The thyro-arytenoids, attached along the whole length of the  vocal bands externally, have a very important but not well-understood  action in the production of the higher tones, and probably also of the  falsetto.    The whole larynx is lined with mucous membrane, that covering the true  vocal bands being very thin. The false vocal bands are made up chiefly  of mucous membrane; the true vocal bands abound in elastic tissue. The  larynx rises during the production of high tones, and during  phonation its vibrations may be felt, as also those of the chest.      _Practical._    1. Feel in your own person the parts of the larynx, etc., from above  down.    2. Note the vibration of the larynx when a vowel is spoken or sung. A  similar vibration of the chest walls may be felt by the hands laid  over them.    3. Note the change of position of the larynx in singing a scale.    4. Dissect a pig's or sheep's pluck and some specimens of the larynx.    [Illustration: FIG. 35. These three figures illustrate perhaps more  clearly the _action_ of the muscles indicated FIGS. 26-34.    The arrows show the direction of the pull of the muscles. The result  of this action is the new position of the cartilages and vocal bands,  which is shown by red outlines. The muscle is also depicted in red.  The heavier outer rim is to indicate the thyroid cartilage. By  comparing the upper and the lowest figure it will be seen that they  are opposites. Of course, in phonation the vocal bands are never so  much separated as shown in the illustrations. Rather does the lower  figure indicate a case of extreme separation due to a very deep  inspiration. However, these illustrations are merely diagrams meant to  indicate in a general way the manner of the working of parts. For  exact pictures of the vocal bands and related parts, see Chapter  VII.]          CHAPTER VII.    SOUND--THE LARYNGOSCOPE--THE LARYNX RECONSIDERED.      Before discussing our subject further it is desirable that some  attention be given to a few of the fundamental principles of that  department of physics termed _acoustics_, and which deals with the  subject of sound. If the student has the opportunity to study this  subject theoretically and practically, as it is set forth in some good  work on physics, he will have no reason to regret the time spent. A  deep knowledge of the laws of sound is not absolutely essential, or  even highly necessary, for a sufficient understanding of the  principles involved in voice-production. It is, however, all-important  that a few facts and principles be thoroughly grasped.    For those who feel that they have the time for a study of acoustics,  the author would especially recommend Tyndall's work on sound, in  which the subject is treated with wonderful clearness and charm. What  we endeavor now to bring before the reader we have found sufficient  for nearly all the purposes of the voice-user.    An observer on the street, looking at a military band, notices certain  movements of one member of the organization which result in what he  termed the sound of the drum; but a deaf man by his side, though he  sees the movements, hears nothing. This, being analyzed, means that  the movements of the drummer's arm, conveyed through the drumstick to  the membrane of the drum, give rise to movements in it which set up  corresponding movements of the air within the drum, which again cause  movements of the body of the instrument, the whole causing movements  of the external air; and here the purely physical process ends. The  movements other than muscular ones are not readily observed, but  experiments not only prove that they exist, but demonstrate their  nature, even to their exact rate of occurrence, their size, etc. These  movements are termed _vibrations_, and, as has been indicated  previously, they are the sole physical cause of sound. But that the  latter is not due wholly to a physical origin is evident from the fact  that sound for the deaf does not exist. It must, therefore, be a  personal, a subjective experience, and as the sleeping, unconscious  person does not necessarily hear a sound, the process is not wholly a  corporeal or physiological process; it is finally an experience of the  mind, the consciousness, and so is psychological as well as  physiological.    The fact that sound has a physical basis in the vibrations of bodies,  either solid, liquid, or gaseous, may be brought home to one in  various ways. Concussion or shaking of some kind is essential to start  these vibrations. The air is made up of its particles, and one being  moved sets up, inevitably, movements in neighboring particles on all  sides, hence vibrations travel in all directions; which explains why a  sound in the street may be heard by those in every part of the street  not too distant, and also in the upper rooms of the houses and below  in the basements. This is an important fact for the singer or speaker  to bear in mind. His purpose must be to set up vibrations that will  travel with great perfection and rapidity in all directions.    The following experiments of a simple kind will serve to convince  those who may not have given much attention to the subject that sound  is due to movements of some object, which we term the sounding body,  strictly that which starts the vibrations by its own movements or  vibrations.    If a sufficiently flexible band of metal or a stiff piece of whalebone  be fixed at one end in a vice, and then sharply pulled to one side and  suddenly let go, a sound results. The same effect is produced when a  tight cord or small rope is plucked at and then suddenly released. In  each of these cases, if actual movements are not seen, a certain haze  which seems to surround the object may be observed. The same can be  seen when a tuning-fork is set into action by a bow, a blow, etc. In  the case of the fork a graphic tracing (Fig. 36) can be readily taken  on smoked paper, thus demonstrating to the eye that vibrations exist,  that they occur with perfect regularity and with a frequency that can  be measured.    [Illustration: FIG. 36 (Tyndall). Illustrates how the vibrations of a  tuning-fork are registered on a blackened (smoked) glass. In order  that the movements of the fork shall be traced in the form of regular  curves, the surface must be kept moving at a definite regular rate.]    A similar observation can be made in the case of stringed instruments.  If pieces of paper be laid on the strings of a violin, and the bow  then drawn across them, the bits of paper will fly off owing to the  movements--_i.e._, the vibrations--of the strings.    That a force applied at one end of several objects in a line or series  causes an obvious effect at the other end, can be well illustrated in  a simple way. If a number of individuals stand one behind another in a  line, each with his hands laid firmly on the shoulders of the one next  to him, and the person at the end be pushed, the force will be  conveyed through all the intermediate individuals, and cause the  unsupported person at the distant end to move. So is it with the  particles of which the air is composed. The movements begun in the  drum set up by contact corresponding movements or vibrations in the  adjacent air, which ultimately reach the hearing subject's ear,  thereby affect his brain, and are accompanied by that change in  consciousness which he terms \"hearing.\" It will be observed that these  events constitute a chain, and a break anywhere will prevent a sound  being heard; there is then, in fact, no sound.    Sounds are characterized by _pitch_, _volume_, and _quality_.    The _pitch_ is determined by the number of vibrations that reach the  ear"]]]
