Fowls do not like wet weather, and it vexes them very much  to be in the rain. Their neighbors know this so well that it has become  their custom to say of an angry person that he is \"as mad as a wet Hen.\"    The Cows were in their part of the barn with their necks between the  stanchions, so there was nothing for them to do but to keep still and  think of those who were out of doors. The Horses were in their  comfortable stalls. They had been working hard all day and the farmer  had gotten a good supper of oats ready for them in their mangers, so  that they could eat quickly and go to sleep, instead of staying awake  and walking around to get their own suppers in the pasture.    Out in the meadow the Sheep huddled close together under a low-branching  tree, and stood still until the storm passed. They had been so warm that  the cool rain made them comfortable, but the wind pushed them and swayed  the branches of the trees. The loud thunder made the Lambs jump. They  liked the lightning and made a game out of it, each one telling what he  had seen by the last flash. The clouds, too, were beautiful, and flew  across the sky like great dark birds with downy breasts, dropping now  and then shining worms from their beaks.    At last the air became cool and clear, and the clouds flew far away  toward the east. Next, the stars peeped out, first one, then two, then  six, then twenty, and then so many that you could not have counted  them,--more than the leaves on a maple-tree, more than the grass-blades  of the meadow. The Sheep ran around a little to shake off the rain-drops  and warm themselves, then they huddled down again to sleep.    When the sun arose in the eastern sky, his warm beams fell upon the  Sheep and awakened them. \"How cool and beautiful a day,\" they said.  \"What a morning for a run!\"    \"I can beat you to the tall grass!\" called one little Lamb to the rest,  and they all scampered around the field, throwing up their heels for  joy. They had been away from their mothers for awhile, and had learned  to eat grass instead of milk. They were quite proud of the way in which  they broke it off, with quick upward jerks of their heads, and their  teeth were growing finely. They did not expect any upper front teeth,  for in place of them the Sheep have only a hard pad of flesh.    Soon they came running back to the flock. \"There is a Dog over there,\"  they cried, \"a strange Dog. He doesn't look like Collie. He is coming  this way, and we are afraid.\"    Their uncle, the Bell-Wether, looked over to where the strange Dog was,  then turned quickly and began to run. The bell around his neck clinked  at every step. When the other Sheep heard the bell they raised their  heads and ran after him, and the Lambs ran after them. The strange Dog  did not follow or even bark at them, yet on they went, shaking the  shining rain-drops from the grass as they trod upon it. Not one of them  was thinking for himself what he really ought to do. The Bell-Wether  thought, \"I feel like running away from the Dog, and so I will run.\"    The other Sheep said to themselves, \"The Bell-Wether is running and so  we will run.\"    And the Lambs said, \"If they are all running we will run.\"    Along the fence they went, the bell clinking, their hoofs pattering, and  not one of them thinking for himself, until they reached a place where  the fence was blown over. It was not blown 'way down, but leaned so that  it could be jumped. If a single one of the flock, even the youngest  Lamb, had said, \"Don't jump!\" they would have stayed in the pasture; but  nobody said it. The Bell-Wether felt like jumping over, so he jumped.  Then the Sheep did as the Bell-Wether had done, and the Lambs did as the  Sheep had done.    Now they were in the road and the Bell-Wether turned away from the  farmhouse and ran on, with the Sheep and the Lambs following. Even now,  if anybody had said, \"Stop!\" they would have stopped, for they knew that  they were doing wrong; but nobody said it.    After a while a heavy wagon came rumbling down the road behind them, and  the Bell-Wether jumped over a ditch and ran into a hilly field with  woodland beyond. Because he went the Sheep did, and because the Sheep  went the Lambs did, and nobody said \"Stop!\" You see, by this time they  were very badly frightened, and no wonder. When they saw the strange Dog  they were a little scared, for they thought he might chase them. If they  had made themselves stay there and act brave they would soon have felt  brave. Even if the Dog had been a cruel one, they could have kept him  from hurting them, for Sheep have been given very strong, hard foreheads  with which to strike, and the Bell-Wether had also long, curled horns  with three ridges on the side of each. But it is with Sheep as it is  with other people,--if they let themselves be frightened they grow more  and more fearful, even when there is no real danger and now all of their  trouble came from their not stopping to think what they ought to do.    They hurried up to the highest ground in the field, and when they were  there and could go no farther, they stopped and looked at each other.  One Lamb said to his mother, \"Why did we come here? It isn't nearly so  nice as our own meadow.\"    \"Why, I came because the Bell-Wether did,\" she answered. Then she turned  to the Bell-Wether and said, \"Why did you bring us here?\"    \"I didn't bring you here,\" he replied. \"I felt like coming, and I came.  I didn't make you follow.\"    \"N-no,\" answered the Sheep; \"but you might have known that if you came  the Sheep would come.\"    \"Well,\" said the Bell-Wether, \"you might have known that if you Sheep  came the Lambs would, so you'd better not say anything.\"    \"Baa!\" cried the Lambs. \"We are hot and thirsty and there isn't any  water here to drink. We want to go back.\"    Everybody was out of patience with somebody else, and nobody was  comfortable. They did not dare try to go home again, for fear they would  have more trouble, so they huddled together on the top of the hill and  were very miserable and unhappy. They hadn't any good reason for coming,  and they could not even have told why they ran to the hilltop instead of  staying in the pleasant hollow below.    There was a reason for their running up, however, although  they didn't know it. It was because their  great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather and-grandmother were  wild Sheep in the mountains, and when frightened ran up among the rocks  where there was nobody to hurt them. They got into the habit of running  up-hill when scared, and their children did the same, and their  children's children did the same, and now even the farmyard Sheep do so,  although they long ago forgot the reason why.    \"Bow-wow-wow!\" rang out on the still morning air.    \"There's Collie!\" cried the Lambs joyfully. \"He's coming to take us  home. Let's bleat to help him find us more quickly.\" All the Lambs said,  \"Baa! Baaa!\" in their high, soft voices, and their mothers said \"Baa!  Baaa!\" more loudly; and the Bell-Wether added his \"Baa! Baaa!\" which was  so deep and strong that it sounded like a little, very little, clap of  thunder.    Collie came frisking along with his tail waving and his eyes gleaming.  He started the flock home, and scolded them and made fun of them all the  way, but they were now so happy that they didn't care what he said. When  they were safely in the home meadow again and the farmer had mended the  fence, Collie left them. As he turned to go, he called back one last  piece of advice.    \"I'm a Shepherd Dog,\" he said, \"and it's my work to take care of Sheep  when they can't take care of themselves, but I'd just like to be a  Bell-Wether for a little while. You wouldn't catch me doing every  foolish thing I felt like doing and getting all the flock into trouble  by following me! Nobody can do anything without somebody else doing it  too, and I wouldn't lead people into trouble and then say I didn't  think. Bow-wow-wow-wow!\"    [Illustration: COLLIE AND THE BELL-WETHER.]    The Bell-Wether grumbled to himself, \"Well, the rest needn't tag along  unless they want to. Pity if I can't jump a fence without everybody  following.\" But down in his heart he felt mean, for he knew that one who  leads should do right things.          THE FINE YOUNG RAT AND THE TRAP      The Mice were having a great frolic in the corn-crib. The farmer's man  had carelessly left a board leaning up against it in such a way that  they could walk right up and through one of the big cracks in the side.  It was the first time that some of them had ever been here. When the  farmer built the crib, he had put a tin pan, open side down, on top of  each of the wooden posts, and had then nailed the floor beams of the  crib through these pans. That had kept the hungry Mice from getting into  the corn.    This was a great day for them, and their gnawing-teeth would certainly  be worn down enough without giving them any extra wear. That, you know,  is one thing about which all Rats and Mice have to be very careful, for  their front teeth are growing all the time, and they have to gnaw hard  things every day to keep them from becoming too long.    There was only one thing that ever really troubled these Mice, and that  was the Cat. They did not feel afraid of Hawks and Owls because they  lived indoors. Weasels did not often come up to the barn, and men made  so much noise when they were around that any wide-awake Mouse could  easily keep out of their way. With the Cat it was different. She was  always prowling around in the night-time, just when they had their  finest parties; and many a young Mouse had been scared away from a  midnight supper by seeing her eyes glowing like balls of fire in the  darkness. By daylight it was not so bad, for they could see her coming,  and besides, she slept much of the time then.    They were talking about her when in the corn-crib. \"Have any of you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19400"],[0,"History Of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 1 (of 12) (#15)"],[1,"the walking-stick of the rich or noble.

The club at length represented merely the rank of a chieftain,[*] while  the crook and the wooden-handled mace, with its head of ivory, diorite,  granite, or white stone, the favourite weapons of princes, continued to  the last the most revered insignia of royalty.[**]    Life was passed in comparative ease and pleasure. Of the ponds left in  the open country by the river at its fall, some dried up more or less  quickly during the winter, leaving on the soil an immense quantity  of fish, the possession of which birds and wild beasts disputed with  man.[***]         *  The wooden club most commonly represented is the usual       insignia of a nobleman. Several kinds of clubs, somewhat       difficult for us moderns to distinguish, yet bearing       different names, formed a part of funereal furniture.         **  The crook is the sceptre of a prince, a Pharaoh, or a       god; the white mace has still the value apparently of a       weapon in the hands of the king who brandishes it over a       group of prisoners or over an ox which he is sacrificing to       a divinity. Most museums possess specimens of the stone       heads of these maces, but until lately their use was not       known. I had several placed in the Boulak Museum. It already       possessed a model of one entirely of wood.         ***  Cf. the description of these pools given by Geoffroy-       Saint-Hilaire in speaking of the fahaka. Even at the present       day the jackals come down from the mountains in the night,       and regale themselves with the fish left on the ground by       the gradual drying up of these ponds.    [Illustration: 077.jpg FISHING IN THE MARSHES]    Other pools, however, remained till the returning inundation, as so many  _vivaria_ in which the fish were preserved for dwellers on the banks.  Fishing with the harpoon, made either of stone or of metal, with the  line, with a net or with traps, were all methods of fishing known and  used by the Egyptians from early times. Where the ponds failed, the  neighbouring Nile furnished them with inexhaustible supplies. Standing  in light canoes, or rather supported by a plank on bundles of reeds  bound together, they ventured into mid-stream, in spite of the danger  arising from the ever-present hippopotamus; or they penetrated up  the canals amid a thicket of aquatic plants, to bring down with the  boomerang the birds which found covert there.

The fowl and fish which could not be eaten fresh, were dried, salted,  or smoked, and kept for a rainy day. Like the river, the desert had its  perils and its resources. Only too frequently, the lion, the leopard,  the panther, and other large felidse were met with there.    [Illustration: 079.jpg HUNTING IN THE DESERT: BULL, LION, AND ORYX  PIERCED WITH ARROWS. 1]         1  Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a painting by Beni-Hasan,       Lepsius, Denhm., ii. 136.         2  Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief of Ptahhotpu.       The dogs on the upper level are of hyenoid type, those on       the lower are Abyssinian greyhounds.    The nobles, like the Pharaohs of later times, deemed it as their  privilege or duty to stalk and destroy these animals, pursuing them even  to their dens. The common people preferred attacking the gazelle, the  oryx, the mouflon sheep, the ibex, the wild ox, and the ostrich, but did  not disdain more humble game, such as the porcupine and long-eared hare:  nondescript packs, in which the jackal and the hyena ran side by side  with the wolf-dog and the lithe Abyssinian greyhound, scented and  retrieved for their master the prey which he had pierced with his  arrows. At times a hunter, returning with the dead body of the mother,  would be followed by one of her young; or a gazelle, but slightly  wounded, would be taken to the village and healed of its hurt.    [Illustration: 080.jpg CATCHING ANIMALS WITH THE BOLA. 1]         1  Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief of Ptahhotpu.       Above are seen two porcupines, the foremost of which,       emerging from his hole, has seized a grasshopper.    Such animals by daily contact with man, were gradually tamed, and  formed about his dwelling a motley flock, kept partly for his pleasure  and mostly for his profit, and becoming in case of necessity a ready  stock of provisions.[**]         **  In the same way, before the advent of Europeans, the       half-civilized tribes of North America used to keep about       their huts whole flocks of different animals, which were       tame, but not domesticated.    Efforts were therefore made to enlarge this flock, and the wish to  procure animals without seriously injuring them, caused the Egyptians  to use the net for birds and the lasso and the _bola_ for  quadrupeds,[*]--weapons less brutal than the arrow and the javelin. The  _bola_ was made by them of a single rounded stone, attached to a strap  about five yards in length. The stone once thrown, the cord twisted  round the legs, muzzle, or neck of the animal pursued, and by the  attachment thus made the pursuer, using all his strength, was enabled to  bring the beast down half strangled. The lasso has no stone attached  to it, but a noose prepared beforehand, and the skill of the hunter  consists in throwing it round the neck of his victim while running.  They caught indifferently, without distinction of size or kind, all  that chance brought within their reach. The daily chase kept up these  half-tamed flocks of gazelles, wild goats, water-bucks, stocks, and  ostriches, and their numbers are reckoned by hundreds on the monuments  of the ancient empire.[**]         *  Hunting with the bola is constantly represented in the       paintings both of the Memphite and Theban periods. Wilkinson       has confounded it with lasso-hunting, and his mistake has       been reproduced by other Egyptologists. Lasso-hunting is       seen in Lepsius, Denhn., ii. 96, in Dumichen, _resultate_,       vol. i. pl. viii., and particularly in the numerous       sacrificial scenes where the king is supposed to be       capturing the bull of the north or south, previous to       offering it to the god.         **  As the tombs of the ancient empire show us numerous       flocks of gazelles, antelopes, and storks, feeding under the       care of shepherds, Fr. Lenormant concluded that the       Egyptians of early times had succeeded in domesticating some       species, nowadays rebels to restraint. It is my belief that       the animals represented were tamed, but not domesticated,       and were the result of great hunting expeditions in the       desert. The facts which Lenormant brought forward to support       his theory may be used against him. For instance, the fawn       of the gazelle nourished by its mother does not prove that       it was bred in captivity; the gazelle may have been caught       before calving, or just after the birth of its young. The       fashion of keeping flocks of animals taken from the desert       died out between the XIIth and XVIIIth dynasties.    At the       time of the new empire, they had only one or two solitary       animals as pets for women or children, the mummies of which       were sometimes buried by the side of their mistresses.    Experience alone taught the hunter to distinguish between those species  from which he could draw profit, and others whose wildness made them  impossible to domesticate. The subjection of the most useful kinds had  not been finished when the historic period opened.    [Illustration: 082.jpg A SWINEHERD AND HIS PIGS. 2]         2  Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a painting in a Theban tomb       of the XVIIIth dynasty.    The ass, the sheep, and the goat were already domesticated, but the pig  was still out in the marshes in a semi-wild state, under the care of  special herdsmen,[*] and the religious rites preserved the remembrance  of the times in which the ox was so little tamed, that in order to  capture while grazing the animals needed for sacrifice or for slaughter,  it was necessary to use the lasso.[***]         *  The hatred of the Egyptians for the pig (Herodotus, ii.       47) is attributed to mythological motives. Lippert thinks       this antipathy did not exist in Egypt in primitive times. At       the outset the pig would have been the principal food of the       people; then, like the dog in other regions, it must have       been replaced at the table by animals of a higher order--       gazelles, sheep, goats, oxen--and would have thus fallen       into contempt. To the excellent reasons given by Lippert       could be added others drawn from the study of the Egyptian       myths, to prove that the pig has often been highly esteemed.       Thus, Isis is represented, down to late times, under the       form of a sow, and a sow, whether followed or not by her       young is one of the amulets placed in the tomb with the       deceased, to secure for him the protection of the goddess.         ***  Mariette, Abydos (vol. i. pl. 48 b, 53).    To prevent       the animal from evading the lasso and escaping during the       sacrifice, its right hind foot was fastened to its left       horn.    Europeans are astonished to meet nowadays whole peoples who make use  of herbs and plants whose flavour and properties are nauseating to  us: these are mostly so many legacies from a remote past; for example,  castor-oil, with which the Berbers rub their limbs, and with which the  fellahin of the Said flavour their bread and vegetables, was preferred  before all others by the Egyptians of the Pharaonic age for  anointing the body and"]]]
