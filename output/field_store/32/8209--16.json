Hence the great mass of us settle down on the plane of  mediocrity, and become \"old fogy.\" We learn to do things passably well,  cease to think about improving our ways of doing them, and so fall into  a rut. Only the few go on. They make use of habit as the rest do, but  they also continue to attend at critical points of action, and so make  habit an _ally_ in place of accepting it as a _tyrant_.      4. HABIT-FORMING A PART OF EDUCATION    It follows from the importance of habit in our lives that no small part  of education should be concerned with the development of serviceable  habits. Says James, \"Could the young but realize how soon they will  become mere walking bundles of habits, they would give more heed to  their conduct while in the plastic state. We are spinning our own fates,  good or evil, and never to be undone. Every smallest stroke of virtue or  of vice leaves its never-so-little scar.\" Any youth who is forming a  large number of useful habits is receiving no mean education, no matter  if his knowledge of books may be limited; on the other hand, no one who  is forming a large number of bad habits is being well educated, no  matter how brilliant his knowledge may be.    YOUTH THE TIME FOR HABIT-FORMING.--Childhood and youth is the great time  for habit-forming. Then the brain is plastic and easily molded, and it  retains its impressions more indelibly; later it is hard to modify, and  the impressions made are less permanent. It is hard to teach an old dog  new tricks; nor would he remember them if you could teach them to him,  nor be able to perform them well even if he could remember them. The  young child will, within the first few weeks of its life, form habits of  sleeping and feeding. It may in a few days be led into the habit of  sleeping in the dark, or requiring a light; of going to sleep lying  quietly, or of insisting upon being rocked; of getting hungry by the  clock, or of wanting its food at all times when it finds nothing else to  do, and so on. It is wholly outside the power of the mother or the nurse  to determine whether the child shall form habits, but largely within  their power to say what habits shall be formed, since they control his  acts.    As the child grows older, the range of his habits increases; and by the  time he has reached his middle teens, the greater number of his personal  habits are formed. It is very doubtful whether a boy who has not formed  habits of punctuality before the age of fifteen will ever be entirely  trustworthy in matters requiring precision in this line. The girl who  has not, before this age, formed habits of neatness and order will  hardly make a tidy housekeeper later in her life. Those who in youth  have no opportunity to habituate themselves to the usages of society may  study books on etiquette and employ private instructors in the art of  polite behavior all they please later in life, but they will never cease  to be awkward and ill at ease. None are at a greater disadvantage than  the suddenly-grown-rich who attempt late in life to surround themselves  with articles of art and luxury, though their habits were all formed  amid barrenness and want during their earlier years.    THE HABIT OF ACHIEVEMENT.--What youth does not dream of being great, or  noble, or a celebrated scholar! And how few there are who finally  achieve their ideals! Where does the cause of failure lie? Surely not in  the lack of high ideals. Multitudes of young people have \"Excelsior!\" as  their motto, and yet never get started up the mountain slope, let alone  toiling on to its top. They have put in hours dreaming of the glory  farther up, _and have never begun to climb_. The difficulty comes in not  realizing that the only way to become what we wish or dream that we may  become is _to form the habit of being that thing_. To form the habit of  achievement, of effort, of self-sacrifice, if need be. To form the habit  of deeds along with dreams; to form the habit of _doing_.    Who of us has not at this moment lying in wait for his convenience in  the dim future a number of things which he means to do just as soon as  this term of school is finished, or this job of work is completed, or  when he is not so busy as now? And how seldom does he ever get at these  things at all! Darwin tells that in his youth he loved poetry, art, and  music, but was so busy with his scientific work that he could ill spare  the time to indulge these tastes. So he promised himself that he would  devote his time to scientific work and make his mark in this. Then he  would have time for the things that he loved, and would cultivate his  taste for the fine arts. He made his mark in the field of science, and  then turned again to poetry, to music, to art. But alas! they were all  dead and dry bones to him, without life or interest. He had passed the  time when he could ever form the taste for them. He had formed his  habits in another direction, and now it was forever too late to form new  habits. His own conclusion is, that if he had his life to live over  again, he would each week listen to some musical concert and visit some  art gallery, and that each day he would read some poetry, and thereby  keep alive and active the love for them.    So every school and home should be a species of habit-factory--a place  where children develop habits of neatness, punctuality, obedience,  politeness, dependability and the other graces of character.      5. RULES FOR HABIT-FORMING    JAMES'S THREE MAXIMS FOR HABIT-FORMING.--On the forming of new habits  and the leaving off of old ones, I know of no better statement than that  of James, based on Bain's chapter on \"Moral Habits.\" I quote this  statement at some length: \"In the acquisition of a new habit, or the  leaving off of an old one, we must take care to _launch ourselves with  as strong and decided an initiative as possible_. Accumulate all the  possible circumstances which shall reenforce right motives; put yourself  assiduously in conditions that encourage the new way; make engagements  incompatible with the old; take a public pledge, if the case allows; in  short, develop your resolution with every aid you know. This will give  your new beginning such a momentum that the temptation to break down  will not occur as soon as it otherwise might; and every day during which  a breakdown is postponed adds to the chances of its not occurring at  all.    \"The second maxim is: _Never suffer an exception to occur until the new  habit is securely rooted in your life._ Each lapse is like letting fall  a ball of string which one is carefully winding up; a single slip undoes  more than a great many turns will wind again. _Continuity_ of training  is the great means of making the nervous system act infallibly right....  The need of securing success nerves one to future vigor.    \"A third maxim may be added to the preceding pair: _Seize the very first  possible opportunity to act on every resolution you make, and on every  emotional prompting you may experience in the direction of the habits  you aspire to gain._ It is not in the moment of their forming, but in  the moment of their producing _motor effects_, that resolves and  aspirations communicate the new 'set' to the brain.\"[3]    THE PREPONDERANCE OF GOOD HABITS OVER BAD.--And finally, let no one be  disturbed or afraid because in a little time you become a \"walking  bundle of habits.\" For in so far as your good actions predominate over  your bad ones, that much will your good habits outweigh your bad habits.  Silently, moment by moment, efficiency is growing out of all worthy acts  well done. Every bit of heroic self-sacrifice, every battle fought and  won, every good deed performed, is being irradicably credited to you in  your nervous system, and will finally add its mite toward achieving the  success of your ambitions.      6. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION    1. Select some act which you have recently begun to perform and watch it  grow more and more habitual. Notice carefully for a week and see whether  you do not discover some habits which you did not know you had. Make a  catalog of your bad habits; of the most important of your good ones.    2. Set out to form some new habits which you desire to possess; also to  break some undesirable habit, watching carefully what takes place in  both cases, and how long it requires.    3. Try the following experiment and relate the results to the matter of  automatic control brought about by habit: Draw a star on a sheet of  cardboard. Place this on a table before you, with a hand-mirror so  arranged that you can see the star in the mirror. Now trace the outline  of the star with a pencil, looking steadily in the mirror to guide your  hand. Do not lift the pencil from the paper from the time you start  until you finish. Have others try this experiment.    4. Study some group of pupils for their habits (1) of attention, (2) of  speech, (3) of standing, sitting, and walking, (4) of study. Report on  your observations and suggest methods of curing bad habits observed.    5. Make a list of \"mannerisms\" you have observed, and suggest how they  may be cured.    6. Make a list of from ten to twenty habits which you think the school  and its work should especially cultivate. What ones of these are the  schools you know least successful in cultivating? Where does the trouble  lie?          CHAPTER VI    SENSATION      We can best understand the problems of sensation and perception if we  first think of the existence of two great worlds--the world of physical  nature without and the world of mind within. On the one hand is our  material environment, the things we see and hear and touch and taste and  handle; and on the other hand our consciousness, the means by which we  come to know this outer world and adjust ourselves to it. These two"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20239"],[0,"The Ten Books on Architecture (#15)"],[1,"of the arts which is thus  deeply hidden. And if artists themselves testify to their own skill,  they can never, unless they are wealthy or famous from the age of their  studios, or unless they are also possessed of the public favour and of  eloquence, have an influence commensurate with their devotion to their  pursuits, so that people may believe them to have the knowledge which  they profess to have.    2. In particular we can learn this from the case of the sculptors and  painters of antiquity. Those among them who were marked by high station  or favourably recommended have come down to posterity with a name that  will last forever; for instance, Myron, Polycletus, Phidias, Lysippus,  and the others who have attained to fame by their art. For they acquired  it by the execution of works for great states or for kings or for  citizens of rank. But those who, being men of no less enthusiasm,  natural ability, and dexterity than those famous artists, and who  executed no less perfectly finished works for citizens of low station,  are unremembered, not because they lacked diligence or dexterity in  their art, but because fortune failed them; for instance, Teleas of  Athens, Chion of Corinth, Myager the Phocaean, Pharax of Ephesus, Boedas  of Byzantium, and many others. Then there were painters like Aristomenes  of Thasos, Polycles and Andron of Ephesus, Theo of Magnesia, and others  who were not deficient in diligence or enthusiasm for their art or in  dexterity, but whose narrow means or ill-luck, or the higher position of  their rivals in the struggle for honour, stood in the way of their  attaining distinction.    3. Of course, we need not be surprised if artistic excellence goes  unrecognized on account of being unknown; but there should be the  greatest indignation when, as often, good judges are flattered by the  charm of social entertainments into an approbation which is a mere  pretence. Now if, as Socrates wished, our feelings, opinions, and  knowledge gained by study had been manifest and clear to see, popularity  and adulation would have no influence, but men who had reached the  height of knowledge by means of correct and definite courses of study,  would be given commissions without any effort on their part. However,  since such things are not plain and apparent to the view, as we think  they should have been, and since I observe that the uneducated rather  than the educated are in higher favour, thinking it beneath me to engage  with the uneducated in the struggle for honour, I prefer to show the  excellence of our department of knowledge by the publication of this  treatise.    4. In my first book, Emperor, I described to you the art, with its  points of excellence, the different kinds of training with which the  architect ought to be equipped, adding the reasons why he ought to be  skilful in them, and I divided up the subject of architecture as a whole  among its departments, duly defining the limits of each. Next, as was  preeminent and necessary, I explained on scientific principles the  method of selecting healthy sites for fortified towns, pointed out by  geometrical figures the different winds and the quarters from which they  blow, and showed the proper way to lay out the lines of streets and rows  of houses within the walls. Here I fixed the end of my first book. In  the second, on building materials, I treated their various advantages in  structures, and the natural properties of which they are composed. In  this third book I shall speak of the temples of the immortal gods,  describing and explaining them in the proper manner.          CHAPTER I    ON SYMMETRY: IN TEMPLES AND IN THE HUMAN BODY      1. The design of a temple depends on symmetry, the principles of which  must be most carefully observed by the architect. They are due to  proportion, in Greek [Greek: analogia]. Proportion is a correspondence  among the measures of the members of an entire work, and of the whole to  a certain part selected as standard. From this result the principles of  symmetry. Without symmetry and proportion there can be no principles in  the design of any temple; that is, if there is no precise relation  between its members, as in the case of those of a well shaped man.    2. For the human body is so designed by nature that the face, from the  chin to the top of the forehead and the lowest roots of the hair, is a  tenth part of the whole height; the open hand from the wrist to the tip  of the middle finger is just the same; the head from the chin to the  crown is an eighth, and with the neck and shoulder from the top of the  breast to the lowest roots of the hair is a sixth; from the middle of  the breast to the summit of the crown is a fourth. If we take the height  of the face itself, the distance from the bottom of the chin to the  under side of the nostrils is one third of it; the nose from the under  side of the nostrils to a line between the eyebrows is the same; from  there to the lowest roots of the hair is also a third, comprising the  forehead. The length of the foot is one sixth of the height of the body;  of the forearm, one fourth; and the breadth of the breast is also one  fourth. The other members, too, have their own symmetrical proportions,  and it was by employing them that the famous painters and sculptors of  antiquity attained to great and endless renown.    3. Similarly, in the members of a temple there ought to be the greatest  harmony in the symmetrical relations of the different parts to the  general magnitude of the whole. Then again, in the human body the  central point is naturally the navel. For if a man be placed flat on his  back, with his hands and feet extended, and a pair of compasses centred  at his navel, the fingers and toes of his two hands and feet will touch  the circumference of a circle described therefrom. And just as the human  body yields a circular outline, so too a square figure may be found from  it. For if we measure the distance from the soles of the feet to the top  of the head, and then apply that measure to the outstretched arms, the  breadth will be found to be the same as the height, as in the case of  plane surfaces which are perfectly square.    4. Therefore, since nature has designed the human body so that its  members are duly proportioned to the frame as a whole, it appears that  the ancients had good reason for their rule, that in perfect buildings  the different members must be in exact symmetrical relations to the  whole general scheme. Hence, while transmitting to us the proper  arrangements for buildings of all kinds, they were particularly careful  to do so in the case of temples of the gods, buildings in which merits  and faults usually last forever.    5. Further, it was from the members of the body that they derived the  fundamental ideas of the measures which are obviously necessary in all  works, as the finger, palm, foot, and cubit. These they apportioned so  as to form the \"perfect number,\" called in Greek [Greek: teleion], and  as the perfect number the ancients fixed upon ten. For it is from the  number of the fingers of the hand that the palm is found, and the foot  from the palm. Again, while ten is naturally perfect, as being made up  by the fingers of the two palms, Plato also held that this number was  perfect because ten is composed of the individual units, called by the  Greeks [Greek: monades]. But as soon as eleven or twelve is reached, the  numbers, being excessive, cannot be perfect until they come to ten for  the second time; for the component parts of that number are the  individual units.    6. The mathematicians, however, maintaining a different view, have said  that the perfect number is six, because this number is composed of  integral parts which are suited numerically to their method of  reckoning: thus, one is one sixth; two is one third; three is one half;  four is two thirds, or [Greek: dimoiros] as they call it; five is five  sixths, called [Greek: pentamoiros]; and six is the perfect number. As  the number goes on growing larger, the addition of a unit above six is  the [Greek: ephektos]; eight, formed by the addition of a third part of  six, is the integer and a third, called [Greek: epitritos]; the addition  of one half makes nine, the integer and a half, termed [Greek:  hemiolios]; the addition of two thirds, making the number ten, is the  integer and two thirds, which they call [Greek: epidimoiros]; in the  number eleven, where five are added, we have the five sixths, called  [Greek: epipemptos]; finally, twelve, being composed of the two simple  integers, is called [Greek: diplasios].    7. And further, as the foot is one sixth of a man's height, the height  of the body as expressed in number of feet being limited to six, they  held that this was the perfect number, and observed that the cubit  consisted of six palms or of twenty-four fingers. This principle seems  to have been followed by the states of Greece. As the cubit consisted of  six palms, they made the drachma, which they used as their unit, consist  in the same way of six bronze coins, like our _asses_, which they call  obols; and, to correspond to the fingers, divided the drachma into  twenty-four quarter-obols, which some call dichalca others trichalca.    8. But our countrymen at first fixed upon the ancient number and made  ten bronze pieces go to the denarius, and this is the origin of the name  which is applied to the denarius to this day. And the fourth part of it,  consisting of two asses and half of a third, they called \"sesterce.\" But  later, observing that six and ten were both of them perfect numbers,  they combined the two, and thus made the most perfect number, sixteen.  They found their authority for this in the foot. For if we take two  palms from the cubit, there remains the foot of four palms; but the palm  contains four fingers. Hence the foot contains sixteen fingers, and the  denarius the same number of bronze"]]]
