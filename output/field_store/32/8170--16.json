Statuettes were made  with a central figure surrounded by them; there were shepherds and  shepherdesses seated beneath arbors or trellises covered with the  daintiest of vines and blossoms; figures of court ladies at whose feet  masses of lovely flowers seemed growing. You can see some of this work  in our own museums, and I am sure you will agree with me that it is  little short of miraculous. The Art Museum at Boston has three very  fine specimens of these early French ornaments, and there are others  to be found elsewhere.\"    \"I am going to hunt some of them up when I go home to the city,\"  affirmed Theo.    \"That's right! See all you can of the beautiful things the past has  given us; you never will be sorry,\" declared Mr. Croyden. \"Now you can  imagine with a background of such progress at china-making, what a  furore and transformation followed when kaolin was discovered. Pate  dure was far more desirable than pate tendre, for it was much less  breakable. The works at Vincennes where Sevres china really had its  birth were now moved to Sevres itself, where the art of  porcelain-making was gradually perfected. The plant was not far from  Versailles, where the Royal palace was, and the industry immediately  came under the control of the King.    \"Then there was excitement indeed! Money was poured in lavishly that  the infant venture might have every chance to grow. The King ordered  beautiful gardens to be made about the factories, and not a week  passed that he and Madame de Pompadour did not visit the works  accompanied by a train of nobles and ladies of the Court. Madame de  Pompadour, herself something of an artist, often touched up the  decoration on a bit of china that pleased her fancy. Professional  artists also lent their aid, their designs ranging from the  shepherdesses of Watteau to copies of Chinese and Japanese  scenes. Flowers, cupids, garlands, landscapes--never was such a  diversity of decoration attempted as during the reigns of Louis XIV  and XV. As a result the output became very overdone and  ornate. Fortunately for art, Louis XVI had better taste. Instead of  continuing this garish type of design he procured a collection of  Greek vases to serve as models for his workmen, and as a result the  product came back to a more classic and less florid style.\"    Mr. Croyden paused.    \"With all this beauty in the body of the porcelain itself, and all  the wonder of the modeling and painting, you must remember that  throughout the period the chemists employed were making great strides  in the use of pigments. No little science was necessary to find colors  that would stand the intense heat necessary for firing this hard  paste. You know of course that most of the mineral pigments used to  decorate china do not look at all the same after they have been  subjected to a high temperature as they look before. Many colors which  fire out to exquisite tones look quite ugly when applied to the  biscuit clay. Both chemists and artists have to be skilled in the  knowledge of how these paints will react under heat. So when I say the  Sevres workers reached a richness and harmony of color never before  known in china-making you can imagine how much patient experimental  labor probably preceded this triumph of art.\"    Theo's eyes had not left the story-teller's face for an instant.    \"It was not as if the painters used only a touch of color here and  there,\" continued Mr. Croyden. \"Much of the ware was designed with a  solid color that covered the body, small spaces being reserved for  medallions in which there were heads or landscapes. The gilding, too,  was very heavy, and sometimes in combination with it imitation gems  were used. At the present time a color known as Rose du Barry brings  the highest price in old Sevres. Other famous colors in which the  French china-makers excelled were Bleu Roi, which was made from  cobalt----\"    \"King's blue,\" murmured Theo.    \"Bleu Celeste, a turquoise blue made from copper----\"    \"Sky blue!\" put in Theo.    \"There was also a rare canary yellow; an apple green; a fine tone of  violet; and a bright red that had not been seen before in the china  world. So intense was the interest in the Sevres factory that even  when the French Revolution came and every relic of royalty was  destroyed by the hooting mobs, the Sevres works were not touched. You  see in what a magic realm the old Sevres ware had its being. We call  everything dating up to 1800 _Old Sevres_, and you will probably find  it so marked in both public and private collections.\"    \"Is Sevres ware still manufactured?\" questioned Theo, stumbling  timidly over the French word.    \"Yes,\" answered Mr. Croyden, \"there is a modern Sevres, much of the  success of which is due to Alexandre Brongniart who was both a  geologist and chemist, and who was the director of the Sevres  factories from 1800 to 1850. He did much to perpetuate the industry  and keep up its standard. During his time no piece with an  imperfection in it was allowed to go out from the factory.\"    \"Was Sevres the only famous ware the French people made?\"    \"It is undoubtedly the most celebrated,\" replied Mr. Croyden, \"but  there are now many other fine porcelains made in France. For example  at Limoges, where in 1775 pate tendre was made, there is a very  extensive porcelain plant founded in 1840 by David Haviland, an  American, from which quantities of pate dure or genuine porcelain for  the American market are annually turned out. Much of the other French  china, however--dainty, exquisite, and artistic as it is, is pate  tendre. It is of course sold in quantities, but it is very perishable.  There is also a so-called porcelain made from a mixture of clays and  phosphates--a ware known to the trade as _bone china_. But of course  this variety is not real porcelain. You see that much of what we call  porcelain is not porcelain at all when you judge it by this strict  standard. It is nevertheless very useful, and a hungry boy like you  can manage nicely to eat his breakfast off it and be quite as  happy. Now give me your tray and I'm off. There will be no more  china-making to-day, you young scoundrel! See how long you have  cajoled me into lingering already. You almost made me forget that I  was going fishing.\"    With a friendly pat on the boy's shoulder Mr. Croyden disappeared.          [Illustration]          CHAPTER X    HOW THE ITALIANS MADE CHINA      For the next few days Theo was in no frame of mind to talk porcelain  or any other serious subject, for his new crutches came, and after Dr.  Swift had adjusted them the boy was like a bird freed from its  cage. He could not, to be sure, go far from the house; but even to  clump up and down the veranda and the plank walks that connected the  cabins was a joy. How good it was to get about once more! But, alas,  the pace at which the convalescent moved was a constant source of  alarm to all who beheld it. Before the expiration of the first day  Theo had acquired such skill and speed that he hopped about like a  sparrow. There was no such thing as stopping him. He felt bound,  however, on his father's account to use some caution, and the  realization that he had already caused trouble enough was a potent  factor in restraining his fearlessness. Each day saw a gain in his  condition, and it was evident that before long the injured leg would  be as good as new.    Yet the exasperating hardship of having still to remain a captive in  the camp had to be endured. In the meantime the date for the return  home drew nearer and as the hours of the vacation shortened Theo's  determination that his father should enjoy every possible moment of  the time increased. So he was plucky enough to be as careful as he  could, and while the Doctor and Mr. Croyden fished he invented for  himself such amusements as were practical within his own more limited  confines.    Perhaps, although he did not appear to notice this, Mr. Croyden  fathomed the lad's unselfish intention more completely than did any  one else. However this may be, certain it was that in spite of his  sorties from the camp the merchant contrived to devote a part of  every evening to Theo, whose father was occupied in writing a medical  paper to be read before some convention on his return to the city. To  these evenings with Mr. Croyden the lad looked forward eagerly. They  were the bright spot in the day. The talks the two had together  usually took place in Mr. Croyden's cabin before the open fire where  the china-makers could converse freely and not disturb Dr. Swift.  Such a genuine friendship between the boy and the elder man had sprung  up that it would have been difficult to tell which of them anticipated  this bedtime hour the more.    \"Do you realize, Theo, that we shall not be having many more of these  talks?\" observed Mr. Croyden one evening as they sat cozily ensconced  before a roaring blaze. \"The last of the week we shall be starting  back to civilization--to starched collars and cuffs, and the rush and  hubbub of city life. For you I suppose it will mean school again; and  for me it will be a matter of wading through a mountain of business  correspondence that has been accumulating while I have been away. We  shall miss these cozy evenings together, shan't we?\"    \"I certainly shall, Mr. Croyden,\" answered Theo earnestly.    \"Well, I do not mean they shall die out altogether,\" Mr. Croyden  affirmed cheerfully. \"My plan is to have you come over to Trenton and  make us a little visit when you get stronger. Would you like to? We'd  go all over the china factories, and you could see porcelain made at  first hand. What do you think of the scheme?\"    \"I'd like it better than anything else,\" cried Theo instantly.    \"It's settled, then,\" replied Mr. Croyden. \"I fancy your father and  mother will be willing to lend you to me for a little while.

He was translated to Salisbury, and became Chancellor  of the Order of the Garter. He obtained an enviable reputation for his  good sense, piety, learning, and generosity.    #Anthony Sparrow# (1667-1676) was Master of King's College, Cambridge,  when consecrated bishop. Cosmo III. visited Exeter during his tenancy of  the see.    #Thomas Lamplugh# (1676-1688) seems to have been a clever politician. By  expressing his loyalty to James II., when William had landed at Torbay,  he was created Archbishop of York; thereupon he actively supported the  Prince of Orange. \"My Lord, you are a genuine old Cavalier,\" was the  king's greeting. One hopes the memory of those words troubled the  archbishop during his three years' experience of an ill-deserved  dignity.    #Jonathan Trelawny# (1689-1707) came of a famous Cornish family. As  Bishop of Bristol he was already famous, for he was one of the seven  bishops whose trial and acquittal hastened the downfall of the last  Stuart king. He was translated to Winchester. A popular refrain, wedded  to verses by the celebrated parson Hawker, of Morwenstow, keeps his  memory alive in the western counties.    #Offspring Blackball# (1708-1716) was chiefly and honourably known as a  promoter of charity schools.    #Launcelot Blackburne# (1717-1724). Of this bishop there is little to  record. He was translated to the Archbishopric of York in 1724.    #Stephen Weston# (1724-1742). The episcopal registers were now kept for  the first time in English. His long reign seems to have been quite  uneventful, and probably was, therefore, entirely successful.    #Nicholas Claggett# (1742-1746) was translated from St. David's.    #George Lavington# (1747-1762).    #Frederick Keppel# (1762-1777), a son of the Earl of Albemarle, was a  canon of Windsor when appointed Bishop of Exeter.    #John Ross# (1778-1792).    #William Buller# (1792-1796), of an old west country family, was  promoted from the deanery of Canterbury.    #Henry Reginald Courtenay# (1797-1803), translated to this see from  Bristol.    #John Fisher# (1803-1807) was tutor to the Duke of Kent, father of Queen  Victoria. He was translated to Salisbury in 1807.    #George Pelham# (1807-1820) was translated from Bristol. After,  according to Oliver, \"for thirteen years expecting higher preferment,\"  he was promoted to Lincoln.    #William Carey# (1820-1830), head master of Westminster School. When he  had been ten years at Exeter he was translated to St. Asaph, a curious  reversal of the usual proceeding. For although a Welsh bishopric often  led to an English one, a change from Exeter to St. Asaph could hardly  have been \"preferment\" in the ordinary sense.    #Christopher Bethell# (1830-1831). Exeter, for this bishop also, was  merely a stepping-stone between Gloucester and Bangor.    #Henry Phillpotts# (1831-1868) was the most famous bishop who has held  the see in this century. He restored the palace, which had fallen into a  ruined condition. He was energetic about the affairs of his diocese, a  born ruler of men, and a scholar of eminence. The story of his  episcopate is a well-known chapter to students of the ecclesiastical  history of the first half of the queen's reign.    #Frederick Temple# (1869-1885), head master of Rugby, 1858-1869; Bishop  of Exeter, 1869; translated to London, 1885, and to the Metropolitan See  of Canterbury, 1896.    #Edward Henry Bickersteth# (1885-1901) was Dean of Gloucester when  appointed bishop.

It is related that when Gytha fled towards the river and William the  Conqueror marched through the eastern gate of the city, claiming it as  his prize, he promised the citizens their lives, goods, and limbs. But,  although he adhered strictly to his promise, and took care that his  victorious soldiers should not pillage or insult the inhabitants, he was  well aware of the supreme value of his conquest. The taking of Exeter  was practically the taking of all western England. So he determined to  make his position impregnable, and to this end set about the building of  a castle on the Red Mount. The task was not a hard one: the Norman  engineers had little need to display their peculiar ingenuity. Nature  had done much, and to her work Briton, Roman, and Englishman had made  additions. As Professor Freeman puts it: \"The hillside was ready  scarped, the ditch was ready dug.\" Baldwin de Molles was appointed  superintendent and commander, and so well did he carry out his trust  that within a year the castle was built and the men of Cornwall and  Devon had attacked its walls in vain. Perhaps because William had been a  merciful conqueror, not despoiling or ill-using the citizens, perhaps  because the citizens were afraid, knowing the just man was strong and  his hand heavy in anger, the besiegers found no help within the city  walls. Henceforth Exeter was for the king.    A curious example of its loyalty was shown in the troubled days of King  Stephen. Earl Baldwin, from all accounts a cruel and violent man, took  arms against the king. Stephen demanded that the castle should be  delivered up. For his answer the Earl laid in provisions, and at the  head of his followers patrolled the streets of the city threatening  vengeance on those who opposed his will. Stephen, speedily apprised by  his faithful citizens of these riotous doings, sent two hundred knights  to confront the rebel. Later he came himself, and the castle was closely  besieged. After three months' heavy fighting the wells in the castle  gave out. Deprived of water, Baldwin, who was brave enough, made shift  with wine, using it both for cookery and extinguishing the fires. But at  last the king was victorious and, not heeding the wise counsel of his  brother Henry of Winchester, permitted the followers of Baldwin to \"go  forth with their goods and follow what lord they would.\"    In 1483, Richard III., fearing that the west favoured the claims of  Henry, Earl of Richmond, hastened to Exeter. He was civilly greeted by  John Attwill, the mayor. But his coming was not very welcome, nor did  his conduct contribute to the gaiety of the inhabitants. In his train  was Lord Scrope, whose business it was to try the rebels. None could be  found, however, save the king's brother-in-law, St. Leger, and his  esquire, John Rame. Richard none the less determined to strike terror  into the hearts of all who wavered in their allegiance. So both men were  beheaded at the Carfax. This done, the king busied himself in studying  the surrounding country, and made careful note of the city and castle.  The military strength of Rougemont pleased him, though the name did not.  A west country accent, some say, gave it a sound like Ridgemount, too  close an echo of his rival's title. The incident is referred to by  Shakespeare in these well-known lines:      \"Richmond! when I last was at Exeter,    The mayor in courtesy showed me the castle,    And called it Rougemont--at which name I started;    Because a bard of Ireland told me once,    I should not live long after I saw Richmond.\"    The castle was considerably injured a few years later when Perkin  Warbeck, at the head of his Cornishmen, attacked the city. The fight  seems to have been a long and furious one. The North Gate was burned,  and both there and at the East Gate the rebels were temporarily  successful. But after the Earl of Devon and his retinue came to the help  of the citizens the rebels were expelled and had to make their way to  Taunton, unsuccessful. Henry soon afterwards arrived bringing Perkin  Warbeck with him. By his clemency towards the rebels he created real  enthusiasm, so that the prisoners \"hurled away their halters and cried  God Save the King.\"    By the time Charles I. came to the throne the castle was already showing  \"gaping chinks and an aged countenance.\" Fairfax and his Roundheads  completed the ruin. But it was not war only which left the building as  we now see it. An ivy-covered gateway is all that remains. Yet from its  summit one has a fine view of the surrounding country, and can readily  understand of what strategical value its possession must have been in  \"battles long ago.\"    [Illustration: ROUGEMONT CASTLE.                 Photochrom Co. Ltd. Photo.]    [Illustration: THE GUILDHALL, EXETER.                 The Photochrom Co. Photo.]    The hand of the reformer proved stronger than that of the victorious  captain. What war had failed to do enterprising citizens accomplished in  times of peace. About the year 1770 the city fathers seem to have been  animated by an unholy passion for destruction. Not only was the house of  the Earls of Bedford, a house full of historic and majestic memories,  pulled down, but the venerable fortress attracted attention. First a  gateway, then the chapel, later the castellan's house disappeared. New  assize courts, superlatively ugly, proudly rose in their stead. But even  then the zeal of the reformers was not satiated. \"Ten years later the  Eastern Gate, with its two mighty flanking towers soaring over the  picturesque house on each side with its wide and lofty Tudor arch  spanning the road, its statue of Henry the Seventh, commemorating its  rebuilding after the siege by Perkin Warbeck--the gate which was heir to  that through which the conqueror made his way--all perished, to the  great satisfaction of the Exeter of that day; for 'a beautiful Vista was  opened from St. Sidwell's into the High Street, a very great and  necessary improvement.'\" It is easy to share Professor Freeman's"]]]
