[Illustration: Fig. 113.]      DARNED NETTING    [Illustration: Fig. 114.]    Darned netting, or _lacis_, as it is sometimes called, might almost come  under the heading of either lace or embroidery. It is used effectively  with other kinds of white linen work, bands or squares of it being let  into the linen; the contrast of the solid with the more open work gives  a pretty effect. Fig. 114 is an example of this work. The darning is  done on a plain netted ground which can be prepared by the worker if  acquainted with netting, if not, the squares can be obtained ready for  working upon. The pattern must be designed upon squared paper as for  cross stitch work, then it is simply a question of following out the  pattern upon the square net ground. Every square of the patterned part  must be crossed in each direction by two lines of darning, which should  about fill it up. The various lines are run in and out as continuously  as possible, so as to avoid unnecessary fastening off or passing from  one part to another. When a fresh thread is required, join it with a  knot to the end of the last one (see figs. 165 and 166), and darn the  ends in neatly with the other threads. These knots are often used in  embroidery, for they are both strong and small. Detached stitches and  parts must be worked by themselves; the thread should not be carried  from one to the other. The work must be done in a frame and carried out  with a blunt-pointed needle. The same thread is used for the netted  ground and for the darned pattern. A method of work that the French call  _dessein reserve_ is, in result, rather similar to this, but it is  worked in just the reverse way. The pattern, whatever it may be, is  left in the plain linen, and the background has certain threads in each  direction withdrawn at regular intervals, whereby the effect of the  squared net ground is obtained.

CHAPTER X    METHODS OF WORK--(_continued_)      Drawn Thread Work--Hem Stitching--Simple Border Patterns--Darned    Thread Patterns--Corners--Cut or Open Work--Various Methods of    Refilling the Open Spaces.      This method of work is the acknowledged link between embroidery and  lace, and was possibly the origin of the latter. Drawn work is that in  which the threads of either the warp or the weft of the material are  withdrawn and those remaining worked into a pattern, by either  clustering together or working over them in some fashion. The cut or  open work, as it is sometimes called, is that in which both warp and  weft are in places cut away, and the open spaces thus formed are partly  refilled with a device of one kind or another.    The work is most often carried out in white thread on white linen, but  coloured threads may occasionally be introduced with advantage. It is a  durable method of work, and particularly suitable for the decoration of  various house-linens, things that must undergo daily wear and wash; its  rather unobtrusive character too makes it the more suitable for this  purpose. The work is used in conjunction with other kinds of embroidery,  perhaps making a neat finish to an edge, or lightening what would  otherwise be too heavy in appearance.    Drawn thread and cut work can be carried out with such detail and  fineness as to really become most delicate lace. In this chapter,  however, it is intended to be treated rather as an adjunct to other  embroidery, therefore only elementary work will be discussed. More  attention might with advantage be paid to the design of this kind of  work, for more might be done with it than sometimes is. For one thing,  there is very little variety in the patterns, and the result often seems  a spidery mass of incomprehensible threads with no very perceivable  plan; perhaps if more attention were paid to the proportion and massing  of the solid and open parts, a better result might be attained. Neatness  and simplicity are good qualities in the pattern, the method of work not  being suited to the expression of the various larger and bolder types of  design.      DRAWN THREAD WORK    In drawn work the question is how to treat the remaining warp threads  after the weft has been withdrawn. They can be clustered in bunches in  different ways with ornamental stitches added, or be entirely covered  over with darning or overcast stitches in such a way as to form a  pattern.    The beginning of most drawn thread work is hem stitching, the two edges  marking the limit of the withdrawn threads have usually to be hem  stitched before any pattern can be carried out. One method of doing this  is in progress in fig. 115. In order to work it, draw out three or four  threads of the warp and tack the hem down to the top edge of the line  thus made. The diagram explains the remainder of the working.    [Illustration: Fig. 115.]    Fig. 116 shows in the first example clusters of four threads drawn  together at each edge by hem stitching in such a way as to form a  ladder-like pattern. This and the one below are the ornamentations of a  plain hem that are most commonly seen. The variation in pattern in the  lower one is obtained by drawing together on the lower edge two threads  from two consecutive bunches in the upper row instead of just repeating  over again the same divisioning as before. These two examples are drawn  to show the reverse, not the working side.    [Illustration: Fig. 116.]    Another way of disposing of the undrawn threads is to cover them with a  kind of darning stitch, as illustrated in fig. 117. This kind of work is  more solid than the other, and is for that reason very durable. This  example is commenced at the right-hand corner, where the threads are  drawn loosely in order to explain the working. The needle, which should  have a blunt point, takes the thread to and fro alternately over and  under two clusters of warp thread, drawing them together a little  during the process; half-way down, the needle leaves the first set of  threads and continues working with the second and a new set (see needle  in diagram). When this is worked down to the base the needle takes the  thread invisibly up the centre of the worked part to the point where it  is required for the continuation of the pattern. The working of this  simple pattern explains the principle upon which all kinds of pretty and  more complicated designs can be carried out. The darning thread may be  coloured; in a more intricate design two or three different colours  might be introduced.    [Illustration: Fig. 117.]    [Illustration: Fig. 118.]    Fig. 118 shows another pattern in the same kind of work. The darning  stitch begins by working to and fro over and under four clusters of warp  threads, part way down it continues over the two central ones only,  leaving the outside clusters alone for the present. It finishes up, as  at the beginning, to and fro over the four. The threads that were left  are next covered with an overcast stitch, the adjoining ones in each  case are caught together in the centre in order to form the X shape that  recurs along the pattern. This darning kind of work is very closely  allied to weaving, and especially the kind often seen in Coptic work, in  which bands of the woof threads are purposely omitted in places, whilst  the fabric is being made, in order that a pattern may be hand-woven in  afterwards to take their place. Many beautiful examples of this work are  on view in the Victoria and Albert Museum.    [Illustration: Fig. 119.]    In working a drawn thread border round a square shape, at each corner  there comes an open space that requires a filling. Fig. 119 shows two  wheels that are commonly used to ornament such places. The square in the  first one has a preliminary groundwork of threads thrown across from  corner to corner and from side to side, all meeting and crossing in the  centre. The working thread is brought through at this point and the  wheel commenced by taking a kind of back stitch over a bar and bringing  the needle up beyond the next bar. It then takes the thread a step back  and over the same bar and brings it up beyond the next; this goes on  until the circle is of sufficient size, the stitches growing a little  longer in each succeeding row. In the diagram the thread is loosened at  the end to explain the working. The lower example is a commonly used  wheel, which is made by the thread running round alternately over and  under a bar until the wheel is completed. It should be as solid as the  upper one, but is purposely left loose in the diagram. Either of the  wheels could have a line of buttonhole stitching worked round the edge  as a finish. This figure shows also the two usual ways of making firm  the raw edges in cut work--the square shape is bound by an overcast  stitch, and the round one by buttonholing.      CUT OR OPEN WORK    Cut work can be most interesting both to look at and to carry out. In  the XVIIth century Italy was famous for its _punto tagliato_ or cut  work. John Taylor mentions \"rare Italian cutworke\" in \"The Praise of  the Needle.\" This poem may perhaps be of interest to some; it was  prefixed to a book of embroidery patterns of cut work named \"The  Needle's Excellency.\" It ran through twelve editions, the first of which  was printed in 1621, and sold at \"the signe of the Marigold in Paules  Churchyard.\" Copies may be seen in the British Museum Library; in the  Bodleian, Oxford, in the Ryland's Library, Manchester, and occasionally  elsewhere. Fig. 120 shows a pattern taken from this book.    There are several distinct varieties of cut work, for instance, that  known as renaissance embroidery, which is usually composed of an  arabesque design from which the background is cut away, leaving the  pattern in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20387"],[0,"A Thin Ghost and Others (#15)"],[1," and then  it was gone. I heard the single enormous bell again--very likely, as  you are saying to yourself, the church clock; but I do not think  so--and then I was broad awake.    All this, I may say, happened within the last half-hour. There was no  probability of my getting to sleep again, so I got up, put on clothes  enough to keep me warm, and am writing this rigmarole in the first  hours of Christmas Day. Have I left out anything? Yes, there was no  Toby dog, and the names over the front of the Punch and Judy booth  were Kidman and Gallop, which were certainly not what the bagman told  me to look out for.    By this time, I feel a little more as if I could sleep, so this shall  be sealed and wafered.      LETTER IV                _Dec. 26, '37._    MY DEAR ROBERT,--All is over. The body has been found. I do not make  excuses for not having sent off my news by last night's mail, for the  simple reason that I was incapable of putting pen to paper. The events  that attended the discovery bewildered me so completely that I needed  what I could get of a night's rest to enable me to face the situation  at all. Now I can give you my journal of the day, certainly the  strangest Christmas Day that ever I spent or am likely to spend.    The first incident was not very serious. Mr. Bowman had, I think, been  keeping Christmas Eve, and was a little inclined to be captious: at  least, he was not on foot very early, and to judge from what I could  hear, neither men or maids could do anything to please him. The latter  were certainly reduced to tears; nor am I sure that Mr. Bowman  succeeded in preserving a manly composure. At any rate, when I came  downstairs, it was in a broken voice that he wished me the compliments  of the season, and a little later on, when he paid his visit of  ceremony at breakfast, he was far from cheerful: even Byronic, I might  almost say, in his outlook on life.    \"I don't know,\" he said, \"if you think with me, sir; but every  Christmas as comes round the world seems a hollerer thing to me. Why,  take an example now from what lays under my own eye. There's my  servant Eliza--been with me now for going on fifteen years. I thought  I could have placed my confidence in Elizar, and yet this very  morning--Christmas morning too, of all the blessed days in the  year--with the bells a ringing and--and--all like that--I say, this  very morning, had it not have been for Providence watching over us  all, that girl would have put--indeed I may go so far to say, 'ad put  the cheese on your breakfast table----\" He saw I was about to speak,  and waved his hand at me. \"It's all very well for you to say, 'Yes,  Mr. Bowman, but you took away the cheese and locked it up in the  cupboard,' which I did, and have the key here, or if not the actual  key one very much about the same size. That's true enough, sir, but  what do you think is the effect of that action on me? Why it's no  exaggeration for me to say that the ground is cut from under my feet.  And yet when I said as much to Eliza, not nasty, mind you, but just  firm like, what was my return? 'Oh,' she says: 'Well,' she says,  'there wasn't no bones broke, I suppose.' Well, sir, it 'urt me,  that's all I can say: it 'urt me, and I don't like to think of it  now.\"    There was an ominous pause here, in which I ventured to say something  like, \"Yes, very trying,\" and then asked at what hour the church  service was to be. \"Eleven o'clock,\" Mr. Bowman said with a heavy  sigh. \"Ah, you won't have no such discourse from poor Mr. Lucas as  what you would have done from our late Rector. Him and me may have  had our little differences, and did do, more's the pity.\"    I could see that a powerful effort was needed to keep him off the  vexed question of the cask of beer, but he made it. \"But I will say  this, that a better preacher, nor yet one to stand faster by his  rights, or what he considered to be his rights--however, that's not  the question now--I for one, never set under. Some might say, 'Was he  a eloquent man?' and to that my answer would be: 'Well, there you've a  better right per'aps to speak of your own uncle than what I have.'  Others might ask, 'Did he keep a hold of his congregation?' and there  again I should reply, 'That depends.' But as I say--Yes, Eliza, my  girl, I'm coming--eleven o'clock, sir, and you inquire for the King's  Head pew.\" I believe Eliza had been very near the door, and shall  consider it in my vail.    The next episode was church: I felt Mr. Lucas had a difficult task in  doing justice to Christmas sentiments, and also to the feeling of  disquiet and regret which, whatever Mr. Bowman might say, was clearly  prevalent. I do not think he rose to the occasion. I was  uncomfortable. The organ wolved--you know what I mean: the wind  died--twice in the Christmas Hymn, and the tenor bell, I suppose owing  to some negligence on the part of the ringers, kept sounding faintly  about once in a minute during the sermon. The clerk sent up a man to  see to it, but he seemed unable to do much. I was glad when it was  over. There was an odd incident, too, before the service. I went in  rather early, and came upon two men carrying the parish bier back to  its place under the tower. From what I overheard them saying, it  appeared that it had been put out by mistake, by some one who was not  there. I also saw the clerk busy folding up a moth-eaten velvet  pall--not a sight for Christmas Day.    I dined soon after this, and then, feeling disinclined to go out, took  my seat by the fire in the parlour, with the last number of  _Pickwick_, which I had been saving up for some days. I thought I  could be sure of keeping awake over this, but I turned out as bad as  our friend Smith. I suppose it was half-past two when I was roused by  a piercing whistle and laughing and talking voices outside in the  market-place. It was a Punch and Judy--I had no doubt the one that my  bagman had seen at W----. I was half delighted, half not--the latter  because my unpleasant dream came back to me so vividly; but, anyhow, I  determined to see it through, and I sent Eliza out with a crown-piece  to the performers and a request that they would face my window if they  could manage it.    The show was a very smart new one; the names of the proprietors, I  need hardly tell you, were Italian, Foresta and Calpigi. The Toby dog  was there, as I had been led to expect. All B---- turned out, but did  not obstruct my view, for I was at the large first-floor window and  not ten yards away.    The play began on the stroke of a quarter to three by the church  clock. Certainly it was very good; and I was soon relieved to find  that the disgust my dream had given me for Punch's onslaughts on his  ill-starred visitors was only transient. I laughed at the demise of  the Turncock, the Foreigner, the Beadle, and even the baby. The only  drawback was the Toby dog's developing a tendency to howl in the wrong  place. Something had occurred, I suppose, to upset him, and something  considerable: for, I forget exactly at what point, he gave a most  lamentable cry, leapt off the foot board, and shot away across the  market-place and down a side street. There was a stage-wait, but only  a brief one. I suppose the men decided that it was no good going after  him, and that he was likely to turn up again at night.    We went on. Punch dealt faithfully with Judy, and in fact with all  comers; and then came the moment when the gallows was erected, and the  great scene with Mr. Ketch was to be enacted. It was now that  something happened of which I can certainly not yet see the import  fully. You have witnessed an execution, and know what the criminal's  head looks like with the cap on. If you are like me, you never wish to  think of it again, and I do not willingly remind you of it. It was  just such a head as that, that I, from my somewhat higher post, saw in  the inside of the show-box; but at first the audience did not see it.  I expected it to emerge into their view, but instead of that there  slowly rose for a few seconds an uncovered face, with an expression of  terror upon it, of which I have never imagined the like. It seemed as  if the man, whoever he was, was being forcibly lifted, with his arms  somehow pinioned or held back, towards the little gibbet on the  stage. I could just see the nightcapped head behind him. Then there  was a cry and a crash. The whole show-box fell over backwards; kicking  legs were seen among the ruins, and then two figures--as some said; I  can only answer for one--were visible running at top speed across the  square and disappearing in a lane which leads to the fields.    Of course everybody gave chase. I followed; but the pace was killing,  and very few were in, literally, at the death. It happened in a chalk  pit: the man went over the edge quite blindly and broke his neck. They  searched everywhere for the other, until it occurred to me to ask  whether he had ever left the market-place. At first everyone was sure  that he had; but when we came to look, he was there, under the  show-box, dead too.    But in the chalk pit it was that poor Uncle Henry's body was found,  with a sack over the head, the throat horribly mangled. It was a  peaked corner of the sack sticking out of the soil that attracted  attention. I cannot bring myself to write in greater detail.    I forgot to say the men's real names were Kidman and Gallop. I feel  sure I have heard them, but no one here seems to know anything about  them.    I am coming to you as soon as I can after the funeral. I must tell you  when we meet what I think of it all.          TWO DOCTORS          TWO DOCTORS      It is a very common thing, in my experience, to find papers shut up in  old books; but one of the rarest things to come across any such that  are at all interesting.
