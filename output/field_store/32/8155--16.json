Hallowed be the Lord in Whose hand is the source of dominion. He createth  whatsoever He willeth by His Word of command \"Be,\" and it is. His hath  been the power of authority heretofore, and it shall remain His hereafter.  He maketh victorious whomsoever He pleaseth, through the potency of His  behest. He is in truth the Powerful, the Almighty. Unto Him pertaineth all  glory and majesty in the kingdoms of Revelation and Creation and whatever  lieth between them. Verily, He is the Potent, the All-Glorious. From  everlasting He hath been the Source of indomitable strength and shall  remain so unto everlasting. He is indeed the Lord of might and power. All  the kingdoms of heaven and earth and whatever is between them are God's,  and His power is supreme over all things. All the treasures of earth and  heaven and everything between them are His, and His protection extendeth  over all things. He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth and  whatever lieth between them, and He truly is a witness over all things. He  is the Lord of Reckoning for all that dwell in the heavens and on earth  and whatever lieth between them, and truly God is swift to reckon. He  setteth the measure assigned to all who are in the heavens and the earth  and whatever is between them. Verily, He is the Supreme Protector. He  holdeth in His grasp the keys of heaven and earth and of everything  between them. At His Own pleasure doth He bestow gifts, through the power  of His command. Indeed His grace encompasseth all, and He is the  All-Knowing.    Say: God sufficeth unto me; He is the One Who holdeth in His grasp the  kingdom of all things. Through the power of His hosts of heaven and earth  and whatever lieth between them, He protecteth whomsoever among His  servants He willeth. God, in truth, keepeth watch over all things.    Immeasurably exalted art Thou, O Lord! Protect us from what lieth in front  of us and behind us, above our heads, on our right, on our left, below our  feet and every other side to which we are exposed. Verily, Thy protection  over all things is unfailing.(7)    --The Bab        \"O God, my God! Shield Thy trusted servants...\"      O God, my God! Shield Thy trusted servants from the evils of self and  passion, protect them with the watchful eye of Thy loving-kindness from  all rancor, hate and envy, shelter them in the impregnable stronghold of  Thy care and, safe from the darts of doubtfulness, make them the  manifestations of Thy glorious signs, illumine their faces with the  effulgent rays shed from the Dayspring of Thy divine unity, gladden their  hearts with the verses revealed from Thy holy kingdom, strengthen their  loins by Thine all-swaying power that cometh from Thy realm of glory. Thou  art the All-Bountiful, the Protector, the Almighty, the Gracious.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O my Lord! Thou knowest that the people...\"      O my Lord! Thou knowest that the people are encircled with pain and  calamities and are environed with hardships and trouble. Every trial doth  attack man and every dire adversity doth assail him like unto the assault  of a serpent. There is no shelter and asylum for him except under the wing  of Thy protection, preservation, guard and custody.    O Thou the Merciful One! O my Lord! Make Thy protection my armor, Thy  preservation my shield, humbleness before the door of Thy oneness my  guard, and Thy custody and defense my fortress and my abode. Preserve me  from the suggestions of self and desire, and guard me from every sickness,  trial, difficulty and ordeal.    Verily, Thou art the Protector, the Guardian, the Preserver, the Sufficer,  and verily, Thou art the Merciful of the Most Merciful.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O God, my God! We are servants of Thine...\"      Whenever ye enter the council-chamber, recite this prayer with a heart  throbbing with the love of God and a tongue purified from all but His  remembrance, that the All-Powerful may graciously aid you to achieve  supreme victory.    O God, my God! We are servants of Thine that have turned with devotion to  Thy Holy Face, that have detached ourselves from all besides Thee in this  glorious Day. We have gathered in this Spiritual Assembly, united in our  views and thoughts, with our purposes harmonized to exalt Thy Word amidst  mankind. O Lord, our God! Make us the signs of Thy Divine Guidance, the  Standards of Thine exalted Faith amongst men, servants to Thy mighty  Covenant, O Thou our Lord Most High, manifestations of Thy Divine Unity in  Thine Abha Kingdom, and resplendent stars shining upon all regions. Lord!  Aid us to become seas surging with the billows of Thy wondrous Grace,  streams flowing from Thine all-glorious Heights, goodly fruits upon the  Tree of Thy heavenly Cause, trees waving through the breezes of Thy Bounty  in Thy celestial Vineyard. O God! Make our souls dependent upon the Verses  of Thy Divine Unity, our hearts cheered with the outpourings of Thy Grace,  that we may unite even as the waves of one sea and become merged together  as the rays of Thine effulgent Light; that our thoughts, our views, our  feelings may become as one reality, manifesting the spirit of union  throughout the world. Thou art the Gracious, the Bountiful, the Bestower,  the Almighty, the Merciful, the Compassionate.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O Thou Lord of the Kingdom! Though our...\"      Come ye together in gladness unalloyed, and at the beginning of the  meeting, recite ye this prayer:    O Thou Lord of the Kingdom! Though our bodies be gathered here together,  yet our spellbound hearts are carried away by Thy love, and yet are we  transported by the rays of Thy resplendent face. Weak though we be, we  await the revelations of Thy might and power. Poor though we be, with  neither goods nor means, still take we riches from the treasures of Thy  Kingdom. Drops though we be, still do we draw from out Thy ocean deeps.  Motes though we be, still do we gleam in the glory of Thy splendid Sun.    O Thou our Provider! Send down Thine aid, that each one gathered here may  become a lighted candle, each one a center of attraction, each one a  summoner to Thy heavenly realms, till at last we make this nether world  the mirror image of Thy Paradise.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O God! O God! From the unseen kingdom of...\"      Prayer to be said at the close of the meeting of the Spiritual Assembly.    O God! O God! From the unseen kingdom of Thy oneness behold us assembled  in this spiritual meeting, believing in Thee, confident in Thy signs, firm  in Thy Covenant and Testament, attracted to Thee, set aglow with the fire  of Thy love and sincere in Thy Cause. We are servants in Thy vineyard,  spreaders of Thy religion, devoted worshipers of Thy countenance, humble  towards Thy loved ones, submissive before Thy door, and imploring Thee to  confirm us in serving Thy chosen ones, to support us with Thine unseen  hosts, to strengthen our loins in Thy servitude and to make us submissive  and adoring subjects communing with Thee.    O our Lord! We are weak, and Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful. We are  lifeless, and Thou art the great life-giving Spirit. We are needy, and  Thou art the Sustainer, the Powerful.    O our Lord! Turn our faces unto Thy merciful countenance, feed us from Thy  heavenly table with Thine abundant grace, assist us with the hosts of Thy  supreme angels and confirm us through the holy ones of the Kingdom of  Abha.    Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Merciful. Thou art the Possessor of  great bounty, and, verily, Thou art the Clement and the Gracious.    --'Abdu'l-Baha          SPIRITUAL QUALITIES        \"From the sweet-scented streams of Thine eternity...\"      From the sweet-scented streams of Thine eternity give me to drink, O my  God, and of the fruits of the tree of Thy being enable me to taste, O my  Hope! From the crystal springs of Thy love suffer me to quaff, O my Glory,  and beneath the shadow of Thine everlasting providence let me abide, O my  Light! Within the meadows of Thy nearness, before Thy presence, make me  able to roam, O my Beloved, and at the right hand of the throne of Thy  mercy, seat me, O my Desire! From the fragrant breezes of Thy joy let a  breath pass over me, O my Goal, and into the heights of the paradise of  Thy reality let me gain admission, O my Adored One! To the melodies of the  dove of Thy oneness suffer me to hearken, O Resplendent One, and through  the spirit of Thy power and Thy might quicken me, O my Provider! In the  spirit of Thy love keep me steadfast, O my Succorer, and in the path of  Thy good pleasure set firm my steps, O my Maker! Within the garden of  Thine immortality, before Thy countenance, let me abide for ever, O Thou  Who art merciful unto me, and upon the seat of Thy glory stablish me, O  Thou Who art my Possessor! To the heaven of Thy loving-kindness lift me  up, O my Quickener, and unto the Daystar of Thy guidance lead me, O Thou  my Attractor! Before the revelations of Thine invisible spirit summon me  to be present, O Thou Who art my Origin and my Highest Wish, and unto the  essence of the fragrance of Thy beauty, which Thou wilt manifest, cause me  to return, O Thou Who art my God!    Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. Thou art, verily, the Most  Exalted, the All-Glorious, the All-Highest.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Create in me a pure heart, O my God, and renew...\"      Create in me a pure heart, O my God, and renew a tranquil conscience  within me, O my Hope! Through the spirit of power confirm Thou me in Thy  Cause, O my Best-Beloved, and by the light of Thy glory reveal unto me Thy  path, O Thou the Goal of my desire!

To pave the way, in a more systematic manner, for the laying of the  necessary foundation on which such permanent national and local  institutions can be reared and securely established is a task that will  very soon demand the concentrated attention of the prosecutors of the  Seven Year Plan. No sooner has their immediate obligation in connection  with the opening up of the few remaining territories in the United States  and Canada been discharged, than a carefully laid-out plan should be  conceived, aiming at the establishment of such a foundation. As already  stated, the provision for these vast, preliminary undertakings, the scope  of which must embrace the entire area occupied by the Central and South  American Republics, constitutes the very core, and must ultimately decide  the fate, of the teaching campaign conducted under the Seven Year Plan.  Upon this campaign must depend not only the effectual discharge of the  solemn obligations undertaken in connection with the present Plan, but  also the progressive unfoldment of the subsequent stages essential to the  realization of 'Abdu'l-Baha's vision of the part the American believers  are to play in the worldwide propagation of their Cause.    These undertakings, preliminary as they are to the strenuous and organized  labors by which future generations of believers in the Latin countries  must distinguish themselves, require, in turn, without a moment's delay,  on the part of the National Spiritual Assembly and of both the National  Teaching and Inter-America Committees, painstaking investigations  preparatory to the sending of settlers and itinerant teachers, whose  privilege will be to raise the call of the New Day in a new continent.    I can only, in my desire to be of some service to those who are to assume  such tremendous responsibilities, and to suffer such self-denial, attempt  to offer a few helpful suggestions which, I trust, will facilitate the  accomplishment of the great work to be achieved in the very near future.  To this work, that must constitute an historical landmark of first-class  importance when completed, the energies of the entire community must be  resolutely consecrated. The number of Baha'i teachers, be they settlers or  travelers, must be substantially increased. The material resources to be  placed at their disposal must be multiplied, and efficiently administered.  The literature with which they should be equipped must be vastly  augmented. The publicity that should aid them in the distribution of such  literature should be extended, centrally organized, and vigorously  conducted. The possibilities latent in these countries should be  diligently exploited, and systematically developed. The various obstacles  raised by the widely varying political and social conditions obtaining in  these countries should be closely surveyed and determinedly surmounted. In  a word, no opportunity should be neglected, and no effort spared, to lay  as broad and solid a basis as possible for the progress and development of  the greatest teaching enterprise ever launched by the American Baha'i  community.    The careful translation of such important Baha'i writings as are related  to the history, the teachings, or the Administrative Order of the Faith,  and their wide and systematic dissemination, in vast quantities, and  throughout as many of these Republics as possible, and in languages that  are most suitable and needed, would appear to be the chief and most urgent  measure to be taken simultaneously with the arrival of the pioneer workers  in those fields. \"Books and pamphlets,\" writes 'Abdu'l-Baha in one of the  Tablets of the Divine Plan, \"must be either translated or composed in the  languages of these countries and islands, to be circulated in every part  and in all directions.\" In countries where no objections can be raised by  the civil authorities or any influential circles, this measure should be  reinforced by the publication, in various organs of the Press, of  carefully worded articles and letters, designed to impress upon the  general public certain features of the stirring history of the Faith, and  the range and character of its teachings.    Every laborer in those fields, whether as traveling teacher or settler,  should, I feel, make it his chief and constant concern to mix, in a  friendly manner, with all sections of the population, irrespective of  class, creed, nationality, or color, to familiarize himself with their  ideas, tastes, and habits, to study the approach best suited to them, to  concentrate, patiently and tactfully, on a few who have shown marked  capacity and receptivity, and to endeavor, with extreme kindness, to  implant such love, zeal, and devotion in their hearts as to enable them to  become in turn self-sufficient and independent promoters of the Faith in  their respective localities. \"Consort with all men, O people of Baha,\" is  Baha'u'llah's admonition, \"in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship. If  ye be aware of a certain truth, if ye possess a jewel, of which others are  deprived, share it with them in a language of utmost kindliness and  goodwill. If it be accepted, if it fulfill its purpose, your object is  attained. If anyone should refuse it, leave him unto himself, and beseech  God to guide him. Beware lest ye deal unkindly with him. A kindly tongue  is the lodestone of the hearts of men. It is the bread of the spirit, it  clotheth the words with meaning, it is the fountain of the light of wisdom  and understanding.\"    An effort, moreover, can and should be made, not only by representative  Baha'i bodies, but also by prospective teachers, as well as by other  individual believers, deprived of the privilege of visiting those shores  or of settling on that continent, to seize every opportunity that presents  itself to make the acquaintance, and awaken the genuine interest, of such  people who are either citizens of these countries, or are in any way  connected with them, whatever be their interests or profession. Through  the kindness shown them, or any literature which may be given them, or any  connection which they may establish with them, the American believers can  thereby sow such seeds in their hearts as might, in future circumstances,  germinate and yield the most unexpected results. Care, however, should, at  all times, be exercised, lest in their eagerness to further the  international interests of the Faith they frustrate their purpose, and  turn away, through any act that might be misconstrued as an attempt to  proselytize and bring undue pressure upon them, those whom they wish to  win over to their Cause.    I would particularly direct my appeal to those American believers,  sore-pressed as they are by the manifold, the urgent, and ever-increasing  issues that confront them at the present hour, who may find it possible,  whatever be their calling or employment, whether as businessmen, school  teachers, lawyers, doctors, writers, office workers, and the like, to  establish permanently their residence in such countries as may offer them  a reasonable prospect of earning the means of livelihood. They will by  their action be relieving the continually increasing pressure on their  Teaching Fund, which in view of its restricted dimensions must provide,  when not otherwise available, the traveling and other expenses to be  incurred in connection with the development of this vast undertaking.  Should they find it impossible to take advantage of so rare and sacred a  privilege, let them, mindful of the words of Baha'u'llah, determine, each  according to the means at his or her disposal, to appoint a deputy who, on  that believer's behalf, will arise and carry out so noble an enterprise.  \"Center your energies,\" are Baha'u'llah's words, \"in the propagation of  the Faith of God. Whoso is worthy of so high a calling, let him arise and  promote it. Whoso is unable, it is his duty to appoint him who will, in  his stead, proclaim this Revelation, whose power hath caused the  foundations of the mightiest structures to quake, every mountain to be  crushed into dust, and every soul to be dumbfounded.\"    As to those who have been able to leave their homes and country, and to  serve in those regions, whether temporarily or permanently, a special  duty, which must continually be borne in mind, devolves upon them. It  should be one of their chief aims to keep, on the one hand, in constant  touch with the National Committee specifically entrusted with the  promotion of their work, and to cooperate, on the other, by every possible  means and in the utmost harmony, with their fellow-believers in those  countries, whatever the field in which they labor, whatever their  standing, ability, or experience. Through the performance of their first  duty they will derive the necessary stimulus and obtain the necessary  guidance that will enable them to prosecute effectively their mission, and  will also, through their regular reports to that committee, be imparting  to the general body of their fellow-believers the news of the latest  developments in their activities. By fulfilling their other duty, they  will insure the smooth efficiency, facilitate the progress, and avert any  untoward incidents that might handicap the development of their common  enterprise. The maintenance of close contact and harmonious relationships  between the Inter-America Committee, entrusted with the immediate  responsibility of organizing such a far-reaching enterprise, and the  privileged pioneers who are actually executing that enterprise, and  extending its ramifications far and wide, as well as among these pioneers  themselves, would set, apart from its immediate advantages, a worthy and  inspiring example to generations still yet to be born who are to carry on,"]]]
