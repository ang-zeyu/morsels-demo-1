[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1722"],[0,"Martin Luther's Large Catechism, translated (#15)"],[1," great or precious it be in the eyes of the world. Let us see now what  our great saints can boast of their spiritual orders and their great  and grievous works which they have invented and set up, while they let  these pass, as though they were far too insignificant, or had long ago  been perfectly fulfilled.    I am of opinion indeed, that here one will find his hands full, [and  will have enough] to do to observe these, namely, meekness, patience,  and love towards enemies, chastity, kindness, etc., and what such  virtues imply. But such works are not of value and make no display in  the eyes of the world; for they are not peculiar and conceited works  and restricted to particular times, places, rites, and customs, but are  common, every-day domestic works which one neighbor can practice toward  another; therefore they are not of high esteem.    But the other works cause people to open their eyes and ears wide, and  men aid to this effect by the great display, expense, and magnificent  buildings with which they adorn them, so that everything shines and  glitters. There they waft incense, they sing and ring bells, they light  tapers and candles, so that nothing else can be seen or heard. For when  a priest stands there in a surplice embroidered with gilt, or a layman  continues all day upon his knees in church, that is regarded as a most  precious work which no one can sufficiently praise. But when a poor  girl tends a little child and faithfully does what she is told that is  considered nothing; for else what should monks and nuns seek in their  cloisters?    But see, is not that a cursed presumption of those desperate saints who  dare to invent a higher and better life and estate than the Ten  Commandments teach, pretending (as we have said) that this is an  ordinary life for the common man, but that theirs is for saints and  perfect ones? And the miserable blind people do not see that no man can  get so far as to keep one of the Ten Commandments as it should be kept,  but both the Apostles' Creed and the Lord's Prayer must come to our aid  (as we shall hear), by which that [power and strength to keep the  commandments] is sought and prayed for and received continually.  Therefore all their boasting amounts to as much as if I boasted and  said: To be sure, I have not a penny to make payment with, but I  confidently undertake to pay ten florins.    All this I say and urge in order that men might become rid of the sad  misuse which has taken such deep root and still cleaves to everybody,  and in all estates upon earth become used to looking hither only, and  to being concerned about these matters. For it will be a long time  before they will produce a doctrine or estates equal to the Ten  Commandments, because they are so high that no one can attain to them  by human power; and whoever does attain to them is a heavenly, angelic  man far above all holiness of the world. Only occupy yourself with  them, and try your best, apply all power and ability and you will find  so much to do that you will neither seek nor esteem any other work or  holiness.    Let this be sufficient concerning the first part of the common  Christian doctrine, both for teaching and urging what is necessary. In  conclusion, however, we must repeat the text which belongs here, of  which we have treated already in the First Commandment, in order that  we may learn what pains God requires to the end we may learn to  inculcate and practice the Ten Commandments:    For I the Lord, thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the  fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them  that hate Me, and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me and  keep My commandments.    Although (as we have heard above) this appendix was primarily attached  to the First Commandment, it was nevertheless [we cannot deny that it  was] laid down for the sake of all the commandments, as all of them are  to be referred and directed to it. Therefore I have said that this,  too, should be presented to and inculcated upon the young, that they  may learn and remember it, in order to see what is to urge and compel  us to keep these Ten Commandments. And it is to be regarded as though  this part were specially added to each, so that it inheres in, and  pervades, them all.    Now, there is comprehended in these words (as said before) both an  angry word of threatening and a friendly promise to terrify and warn  us, and, moreover to induce and encourage us to receive and highly  esteem His Word as a matter of divine earnestness, because He Himself  declares how much He is concerned about it, and how rigidly He will  enforce it, namely, that He will horribly and terribly punish all who  despise and transgress His commandments; and again, how richly He will  reward, bless, and do all good to those who hold them in high esteem,  and gladly do and live according to them. Thus He demands that all our  works proceed from a heart which fears and regards God alone, and from  such fear avoids everything that is contrary to His will, lest it  should move Him to wrath; and, on the other hand, also trusts in Him  alone, and from love to Him does all He wishes, because he speaks to us  as friendly as a father, and offers us all grace and every good.    Just this is also the meaning and true interpretation of the first and  chief commandment, from which all the others must flow and proceed, so  that this word: Thou shalt have no other gods before Me, in its  simplest meaning states nothing else than this demand: Thou shalt fear,  love, and trust in Me as thine only true God. For where there is a  heart thus disposed towards God, the same has fulfilled this and all  the other commandments. On the other hand, whoever fears and loves  anything else in heaven and upon earth will keep neither this nor any.  Thus the entire scriptures have everywhere preached and inculcated this  commandment, aiming always at these two things: fear of God and trust  in Him. And especially the prophet David throughout the Psalms, as when  he says [Ps. 147,11]: The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear Him,  in those that hope in His mercy. As if the entire commandment were  explained by one verse, as much as to say: The Lord taketh pleasure in  those who have no other gods.    Thus the First Commandment is to shine and impart its splendor to all  the others. Therefore you must let this declaration run through all the  commandments, like a hoop in a wreath, joining the end to the beginning  and holding them all together, that it be continually repeated and not  forgotten; as, namely, in the Second Commandment, that we fear God and  do not take His name in vain for cursing, lying, deceiving, and other  modes of leading men astray, or rascality, but make proper and good use  of it by calling upon Him in prayer, praise, and thanksgiving, derived  from love and trust according to the First Commandment. In like manner  such fear, love, and trust is to urge and force us not to despise His  Word, but gladly to learn, hear, and esteem it holy, and honor it.    Thus continuing through all the following commandments towards our  neighbor likewise, everything is to proceed by virtue of the First  Commandment, to wit, that we honor father and mother, masters, and all  in authority and be subject and obedient to them, not on their own  account, but for God's sake. For you are not to regard or fear father  or mother, or from love of them do or omit anything. But see to that  which God would have you do, and what He will quite surely demand of  you; if you omit that, you have an angry Judge, but in the contrary  case a gracious Father.    Again, that you do your neighbor no harm, injury, or violence, nor in  any wise encroach upon him as touching his body, wife, property, honor,  or rights, as all these things are commanded in their order, even  though you have opportunity and cause to do so and no man would reprove  you; but that you do good to all men, help them, and promote their  interest, howsoever and wherever you can, purely from love of God and  in order to please Him, in the confidence that He will abundantly  reward you for everything. Thus you see how the First Commandment is  the chief source and fountainhead which flows into all the rest, and  again, all return to that and depend upon it, so that beginning and end  are fastened and bound to each other.    This (I say) it is profitable and necessary always to teach to the  young people, to admonish them and to remind them of it, that they may  be brought up not only with blows and compulsion, like cattle, but in  the fear and reverence of God. For where this is considered and laid to  heart that these things are not human trifles, but the commandments of  the Divine Majesty, who insists upon them with such earnestness, is  angry with, and punishes those who despise them, and, on the other  hand, abundantly rewards those who keep them, there will be a  spontaneous impulse and a desire gladly to do the will of God.  Therefore it is not in vain that it is commanded in the Old Testament  to write the Ten Commandments on all walls and corners, yes, even on  the garments, not for the sake of merely having them written in these  places and making a show of them, as did the Jews, but that we might  have our eyes constantly fixed upon them, and have them always in our  memory, and that we might practice them in all our actions and ways,  and every one make them his daily exercise in all cases, in every  business and transaction, as though they were written in every place  wherever he would look, yea, wherever he walks or stands. Thus there  would be occasion enough, both at home in our own house and abroad with  our neighbors, to practice the Ten Commandments, that no one need run  far for them.    From this it again appears how highly these Ten Commandments are to be  exalted and extolled above all estates, commandments, and works which "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17221"],[0,"History of the Plague in London (#15)"],[1," this was, when he had, as it were, his sword drawn in his  hand, on purpose to take vengeance, not on them only, but on the whole  nation.    I had indeed been in some passion at first with them, though it was  really raised, not by any affront they had offered me personally, but by  the horror their blaspheming tongues filled me with. However, I was  doubtful in my thoughts whether the resentment I retained was not all  upon my own private account; for they had given me a great deal of ill  language too, I mean personally: but after some pause, and having a  weight of grief upon my mind, I retired myself as soon as I came home  (for I slept not that night), and, giving God most humble thanks for my  preservation in the imminent danger I had been in, I set my mind  seriously and with the utmost earnestness to pray for those desperate  wretches, that God would pardon them, open their eyes, and effectually  humble them.    By this I not only did my duty, namely, to pray for those who  despitefully used me, but I fully tried my own heart, to my full  satisfaction that it was not filled with any spirit of resentment as  they had offended me in particular; and I humbly recommend the method to  all those that would know, or be certain, how to distinguish between  their zeal for the honor of God and the effects of their private  passions and resentment.    I remember a citizen, who, having broken out of his house in Aldersgate  Street or thereabout, went along the road to Islington. He attempted to  have gone[123] in at the Angel Inn, and after that at the White Horse,  two inns known still by the same signs, but was refused, after which he  came to the Pyed[124] Bull, an inn also still continuing the same sign.  He asked them for lodging for one night only, pretending to be going  into Lincolnshire, and assuring them of his being very sound, and free  from the infection, which also at that time had not reached much that  way.    They told him they had no lodging that they could spare but one bed up  in the garret, and that they could spare that bed but for one night,  some drovers being expected the next day with cattle: so, if he would  accept of that lodging, he might have it, which he did. So a servant was  sent up with a candle with him to show him the room. He was very well  dressed, and looked like a person not used to lie in a garret; and when  he came to the room, he fetched a deep sigh, and said to the servant, \"I  have seldom lain in such a lodging as this.\" However, the servant  assured him again that they had no better. \"Well,\" says he, \"I must make  shift.[125] This is a dreadful time, but it is but for one night.\" So he  sat down upon the bedside, and bade the maid, I think it was, fetch him  a pint of warm ale. Accordingly the servant went for the ale; but some  hurry in the house, which perhaps employed her other ways, put it out of  her head, and she went up no more to him.    The next morning, seeing no appearance of the gentleman, somebody in the  house asked the servant that had showed him upstairs what was become of  him. She started. \"Alas!\" says she, \"I never thought more of him. He  bade me carry him some warm ale, but I forgot.\" Upon which, not the  maid, but some other person, was sent up to see after him, who, coming  into the room, found him stark dead, and almost cold, stretched out  across the bed. His clothes were pulled off, his jaw fallen, his eyes  open in a most frightful posture, the rug of the bed being grasped hard  in one of his hands, so that it was plain he died soon after the maid  left him; and it is probable, had she gone up with the ale, she had  found him dead in a few minutes after he had sat down upon the bed. The  alarm was great in the house, as any one may suppose, they having been  free from the distemper till that disaster, which, bringing the  infection to the house, spread it immediately to other houses round  about it. I do not remember how many died in the house itself; but I  think the maidservant who went up first with him fell presently ill by  the fright, and several others; for, whereas there died but two in  Islington of the plague the week before, there died nineteen the week  after, whereof fourteen were of the plague. This was in the week from  the 11th of July to the 18th.    There was one shift[126] that some families had, and that not a few,  when their houses happened to be infected, and that was this: the  families who in the first breaking out of the distemper fled away into  the country, and had retreats among their friends, generally found some  or other of their neighbors or relations to commit the charge of those  houses to, for the safety of the goods and the like. Some houses were  indeed entirely locked up, the doors padlocked, the windows and doors  having deal boards nailed over them, and only the inspection of them  committed to the ordinary watchmen and parish officers; but these were  but few.    It was thought that there were not less than a thousand houses forsaken  of the inhabitants in the city and suburbs, including what was in the  outparishes and in Surrey, or the side of the water they called  Southwark. This was besides the numbers of lodgers and of particular  persons who were fled out of other families; so that in all it was  computed that about two hundred thousand people were fled and gone in  all.[127] But of this I shall speak again. But I mention it here on this  account: namely, that it was a rule with those who had thus two houses  in their keeping or care, that, if anybody was taken sick in a family,  before the master of the family let the examiners or any other officer  know of it, he immediately would send all the rest of his family,  whether children or servants as it fell out to be, to such other house  which he had not in charge, and then, giving notice of the sick person  to the examiner, have a nurse or nurses appointed, and having another  person to be shut up in the house with them (which many for money would  do), so to take charge of the house in case the person should die.    This was in many cases the saving a whole family, who, if they had been  shut up with the sick person, would inevitably have perished. But, on  the other hand, this was another of the inconveniences of shutting up  houses; for the apprehensions and terror of being shut up made many run  away with the rest of the family, who, though it was not publicly known,  and they were not quite sick, had yet the distemper upon them; and who,  by having an uninterrupted liberty to go about, but being obliged still  to conceal their circumstances, or perhaps not knowing it themselves,  gave the distemper to others, and spread the infection in a dreadful  manner, as I shall explain further hereafter.    I had in my family only an ancient woman that managed the house, a  maidservant, two apprentices, and myself; and, the plague beginning to  increase about us, I had many sad thoughts about what course I should  take and how I should act. The many dismal objects[128] which happened  everywhere as I went about the streets had filled my mind with a great  deal of horror, for fear of the distemper itself, which was indeed very  horrible in itself, and in some more than others. The swellings, which  were generally in the neck or groin, when they grew hard, and would not  break, grew so painful that it was equal to the most exquisite torture;  and some, not able to bear the torment, threw themselves out at windows,  or shot themselves, or otherwise made themselves away, and I saw several  dismal objects of that kind. Others, unable to contain themselves,  vented their pain by incessant roarings; and such loud and lamentable  cries were to be heard, as we walked along the streets, that[129] would  pierce the very heart to think of, especially when it was to be  considered that the same dreadful scourge might be expected every moment  to seize upon ourselves.    I cannot say but that now I began to faint in my resolutions. My heart  failed me very much, and sorely I repented of my rashness, when I had  been out, and met with such terrible things as these I have talked of. I  say I repented my rashness in venturing to abide in town, and I wished  often that I had not taken upon me to stay, but had gone away with my  brother and his family.    Terrified by those frightful objects, I would retire home sometimes, and  resolve to go out no more; and perhaps I would keep those resolutions  for three or four days, which time I spent in the most serious  thankfulness for my preservation and the preservation of my family, and  the constant confession of my sins, giving myself up to God every day,  and applying to him with fasting and humiliation and meditation. Such  intervals as I had, I employed in reading books and in writing down my  memorandums of what occurred to me every day, and out of which,  afterwards, I took most of this work, as it relates to my observations  without doors. What I wrote of my private meditations I reserve for  private use, and desire it may not be made public on any account  whatever.    I also wrote other meditations upon divine subjects, such as occurred to  me at that time, and were profitable to myself, but not fit for any  other view, and therefore I say no more of that.    I had a very good friend, a physician, whose name was Heath, whom I  frequently visited during this dismal time, and to whose advice I was  very much obliged for many things which he directed me to take by way of  preventing the infection when I went out, as he found I frequently did,  and to hold in my mouth when I was in the streets. He also came very  often to see me; and as he was a good Christian, as well as a good  physician, his agreeable conversation was a very great support to me in  the worst of this terrible time.    It was now the beginning of August, and the plague grew very violent and  terrible in the place where I lived; and Dr. Heath"]]]
