Don Sagasta and his daughter, after a few more words, left them;  assuring them that they would be safe from observation there, but  that they must not stir out, during the day; and must keep the door  securely fastened, and must give no answer to anyone who might come  and knock, or call, unless to themselves, to the black who was now  with them, or his wife, who would accompany him, perhaps, the next  evening. Donna Anna herself promised that she would come and see  them the next morning, and that she hoped to find that they were  comfortable.    When left alone, the boys luxuriated in the bath; and then, having  put on fresh suits, they felt clean and comfortable once again. The  clothes were those used by the upper class of slaves, employed as  overseers. Don Sagasta had determined to get them some clothes of a  superior class; but he felt that it was better that, so long as  they were in hiding, they should be dressed in a costume which  would, should anyone perchance get a distant look at them, excite  no curiosity or surprise.    The boys ate a hearty supper; and then, throwing themselves into  the swinging hammocks, were soon fast asleep. They were up with  dawn, next morning, tidied up their room, and made all ready for  the visit of Donna Anna.    She soon appeared, having got rid of her little black maid, as upon  the morning before. She brought them a store of books, and among  them a Spanish dictionary and grammar. She told them that she  thought it would be of assistance, to pass away their time; and be  of the greatest use, for them to learn to speak as much Spanish as  possible; and that she was willing, when she could spare time,  unobserved, to teach them the language. Very gratefully the boys  accepted her offer; and, day by day for the next month, the young  lady came every morning, and for an hour taught them the meaning  and pronunciation of the words, which during the day they learnt by  heart.    They found that the island upon which they had been cast ashore was  Porto Rico, an island of considerable size, not far from  Hispaniola.          Chapter 6: In the Woods.        In the evening Senor Sagasta visited the lads, and had long  conversations with them. He promised them that, upon the very first  opportunity which should occur, he would aid them to escape; but  pointed out that, at present, there was no possibility of their  getting away.    \"Captain Drake,\" he said, \"has left the seas and, until he comes  back again, or some other of your English filibusters, I see no  chance of your escape. As soon as I hear of an English ship in  these waters I will have a small boat, well fitted up with sails  and all necessaries, conveyed to a creek on the coast. To this you  shall be taken down, and make your way to the point where we hear  that the vessel is accustomed to rendezvous.\"    This appeared to the boys to be the only possible plan, and they  warmly expressed their gratitude to their host for his thoughtful  kindness.    Another month passed; and then, one evening, Don Sagasta came to  the hut with a certain anxiety in his face.    \"Is there anything the matter?\" Ned, who now began to speak Spanish  with some fluency, asked.    \"I am much disturbed. Since you have been here, I am sure that no  one has got a sight of you; and I can rely so implicitly upon  David, and Flora, that I am sure the secret has not leaked out  there. But from what I hear, it seems that you must have been seen,  during the time that you were wrecked, and before you came here. I  hear in the town today that a rumor is current, among the people,  that two white men were seen, near the sea, upon the day after the  great storm. Someone else, too, seems to have said that he caught  sight of two white men, not far from this house, just before  daybreak, two days afterwards. This report has, it seems, been  going from mouth to mouth; and has at last reached the ears of the  governor. The portions of a wreck, which were driven ashore, seem  to confirm the story; and unfortunately, the board with the name of  the ship was washed ashore, and it is known to be that of one of  those captured by Captain Drake. Putting the two things together,  it is supposed that misfortune overtook a portion of his fleet, and  that two of his men managed to save their lives, and are now  lurking somewhere about the neighborhood I hear that the governor  has ordered a strict search to be set on foot, and that a large  reward is to be offered for the discovery of any signs of the  fugitives.\"    The next day, the boys heard that the persons to whom the story had  been traced had been taken before the governor, and strictly  examined, and that he was fully convinced of the truth of the  story. Three days afterwards, Don Sagasta brought them a copy of a  notice which had been placed in the marketplace, offering a reward  of 1000 dollars for any news which would lead to the capture of the  English pirates, and announcing the severest punishment upon any  who should dare to conceal, or to assist them.    Gerald at once said that, rather than be a cause of anxiety to  their kind host and his daughter, they would give themselves up.  This offer was, however, indignantly refused by Don Sagasta.    \"No, no,\" he said; \"this must not be. I might take you into the  house, but I fear that with so many servants, some of whom are as  bigoted as any of us whites, you would be sure to be discovered;  and they would either reveal in confession, or disclose to the  authorities, the fact of your concealment. The only plan which  promises to offer safety, that I can suggest, is that you shall  take to the mountains. There are many runaways there, and although  sometimes they are hunted down and slain; yet they have caverns,  and other places of concealment, where you might remain for years.  I will speak to David about it, at once.\"    David, on being questioned, said that there was an old native  woman, living at a hut a little way off, who had the reputation of  having the evil eye, and who was certainly acquainted with the  doings of the runaways. If any slave wished to send a message, to  one of his friends who had taken to the hills, the old woman would,  for a present, always convey, or get it conveyed, to the man for  whom it was intended. He thought that it would be absolutely  necessary that some such means should be taken of introducing the  boys to the runaways; otherwise, hunted as these were, they would  either fly when they saw two whites approaching, or would surround  and destroy them.    Don Sagasta at once accepted the suggestion, and David was  dispatched to the old woman, with offers of a handsome present, if  she would give a guide to the boys, to the mountains. David was  instructed, especially, to tell her that they were English, and the  natural enemies of the Spaniards; that they had done them much harm  at sea; and that, if caught by the Spaniards, they would be killed.    He returned an hour later, with news that the old Indian woman had,  at once upon hearing these facts, promised to get them passed up to  the hiding places of the natives.    \"You think,\" Don Sagasta said, \"that there is no fear of her  mentioning the fact that she has seen my friends, to any of the  searchers?\"    \"Oh, no,\" David said. \"She is as close as wax. Over and over again,  when she has been suspected of assisting in the evasion of a slave,  she has been beaten and put to torture; but nothing was ever  extracted from her lips, and it is certain that she would die,  rather than reveal a secret.\"    Donna Anna was much moved, when she said adieu to the lads. She  regarded Ned as the preserver of her life; and both had, during the  two months of daily intercourse, much endeared themselves to her.  Don Sagasta brought to them a handsome pair of pistols, each, and a  sword; and then, giving them a basket of provisions and a purse  containing money, which he thought might be useful even among  runaway slaves, he and his daughter bade adieu to them, with many  expressions of kindness and gratitude, on both sides.    \"Do not hesitate,\" Don Sagasta said, \"to let me know if I can, at  any time, do or send anything for you. Should it be possible, I  will send a message to you, by the old woman, if any expedition on  a grand scale is being got up against the runaways; and this may  make your position more comfortable among them.\"    Under the guidance of David, they then started for the Indian  woman's hut; while Flora set to work to carry away and obliterate  all signs, from the hut, of its late residents. After a few  minutes' walking, the boys arrived at the Indian hut. It was  constructed simply, of boughs of trees thickly worked together.    On hearing their footsteps an old woman--the boys thought they had  never seen anyone so old--with long white hair, and a face wrinkled  till it hardly seemed like the face of a human being, came to the  door, with a torch made of resinous wood held aloft. She peered  under her hand at the boys, and said a few words to David, which he  translated to the boys to be:    \"And these are English, the people of whom the Spaniards are as  afraid as my people are of them? Two Spaniards can drive fifty  Indians before them, but I hear that a dozen of these Englishmen  can take a ship with a hundred Spaniards on board. It is wonderful.  They look something like our oppressors, but they are fairer, and  their eyes are blue; and they look honest, and have not that air of  pride, and arrogance, which the Spaniard never lays aside.    \"I have a boy here.\"    And as she spoke an Indian boy, of some thirteen years of age,  slipped out from behind her.    \"He will show them to the refuge places of the last of my race.  There they will be well received, for I have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19207"],[0,"The Firelight Fairy Book (#15)"],[1," that  his poor horse could scarcely stagger, rode to the castle gate bearing  very evil news. A great battle had been fought, the army of Rosabella's  father had been completely defeated, and the troops of the wicked  Malefico were hurrying toward the castle as fast as they could come.    And so it was; for before the Queen had had time to summon the people  and gather together a few belongings, the troops of the enemy burst in  at the gate, and a dozen fierce soldiers surrounded the Queen,  Rosabella, and the bird-boy, and dragged them to Malefico.    When Malefico saw the bird-boy, a look of surprise appeared on his face,  for he had believed that the wonderful child was dead. Then he fell to  thinking, and as he thought, wicked purposes swept over his cruel face  just as the shadows of dark clouds sweep over a gloomy pool.    \"If it were known that the winged child is alive,\" he thought, \"the  people would thrust me from my place, and restore him to his father's  throne. Now that the bird-boy is in my hands, I will destroy him, and be  sure of my power.\"    So he smiled, and began to think of some manner in which he could bring  the bird-boy to a shameful end. At last he hit upon a plan. He would  declare that the bird-boy was not a human lad at all, but a witch-child;  he would then accuse the good King of having protected a witch-child,  and condemn them both to be stoned. So he threw the King and the Queen,  Rosabella and the bird-boy, into an old dungeon-tower, and went through  the mockery of having a trial. When it was over, he sent a soldier to  tell the King and the bird-boy that they were to be punished the  following day.    And now dawned the unhappy day. The bird-boy took Rosabella's hand in  his, and together they went to the barred window of the prison and  looked out upon the world. The morning was fresh and fair; a pleasant  southwest wind was blowing. The King and the bird-boy were to be led  forth at noon. The clock marked a quarter to twelve.    \"Dear Rosabella,\" said the bird-boy sadly, \"we have forgotten that  to-day is the day on which the great gray bird comes from the ocean and  circles the castle towers. If thou shouldst see the bird when I am gone,  greet it in my name, as we did when we were happy children.\"    \"The bird may come,\" said Rosabella amid her sobs.    \"No, Rosabella,\" said the bird-boy, \"I shall never see the gray bird  again. And even if it were to come, what could it do to save us from  these cruel people?\"    When the clock stood at five minutes to twelve, there was a confused  noise below, and Malefico and the judges who shared with him the guilt  of the unrighteous punishment took their places on a kind of platform  which overlooked the place of execution.    \"They will soon be coming to get us,\" said the King to the bird-boy.    And sure enough, they heard the jangle of the jailer's keys at the foot  of the stair.    Suddenly the sunlight in the room faded swiftly into a strange gray  gloom, and the bird-boy rushed to the window to see if a storm was at  hand. A great shadowy cloud, advancing with inconceivable rapidity,  already filled half the sky, and as the boy gazed into this cloud, he  saw to his astonishment that it was not a cloud at all, but hundreds and  hundreds of thousands of great gray birds, flapping their long wings.  The shadow of the birds fell over the platform on which the cruel  Malefico sat waiting for the King and the bird-boy to be brought forth,  and then ceased moving even as a ship that has come into harbor.    Far ahead of the vast swarm flew one lonely bird, and suddenly this bird  uttered a shrill and piercing cry. Immediately every bird let fall a  great beach-stone which he held in his claws, and for a long minute, the  sky rained stones, round, polished stones that fell like bolts of  thunder. When the storm was over, and the cloud had begun to break into  rifts and speckles of light and flapping gray wings, the wicked Malefico  and his cruel nobles lay buried forever beneath mound upon mound of  stones. The doom which Malefico had intended for another had overtaken  him.    The King and the Queen, Rosabella and the bird-boy, rushed down the  stairs and out into the sunlight. As they did so, the gray bird who had  led the cloud, sank through the air and alighted at their feet. But  scarcely had the bird's claws touched the ground, when there was a flash  of flame, and the bird-boy's mother stood before them. She took her son  in her arms, and told them all his history and her misfortunes, and how  she had watched over him year after year and gathered the birds to save  him.    Thus it came to pass that, when the troops of Malefico saw their former  Queen and heard her story, they acclaimed the bird-boy as their rightful  king, and carried him back in triumph into his own country. So the  bird-boy became a king, married Rosabella, and lived happily ever after.             THE MASTER MARINER    Once upon a time a fine young fisherman rose early in the morning, and  sailed alone to the fishing-grounds. There was very little wind, and  beneath the speckled clouds and the cold, pearly light of the late dawn,  the broad, low billows went slowly and unrippled to the land.    The fisherman cast anchor, and threw overboard his lines. Suddenly his  boat moved uneasily, and close to its side the oily surface of the pale  sea broke into a tumbling mass of foam. In the heart of the troubled  waters, the fisherman beheld, to his great astonishment, a man clad in a  strange garment of gleaming black scales, struggling with an enormous  scarlet fish. A battle of life and death they fought, the man of the sea  trying to stab the fish with a short dagger of shining steel, the fish  trying, wolf-like, to tear at the body of its enemy. Now, with a swift  lash of its bright scarlet body, the fish would rush at the man; now,  with a long sure stroke of his powerful arms, the man would escape the  attack. Suddenly, the fish hurled itself clear out of the water, and  falling against the man, struck him a terrible blow with its tail. Then  the ocean man, who was stunned for a moment, would have perished, had  not the young fisherman swiftly seized his spear and plunged deep into  the body of the fish. Mortally wounded, the scarlet creature sank  through the sunless waters, the dark blood flowing from its side.    The man of the sea clutched the rail of the boat with his webbed hands,  and said to the fisherman, \"I am the King of the Caves of the Sea. I owe  you my life, and you shall have a reward. Take this little silver fish.  It will bring you good fortune; and should you ever be in deadly peril,  you have but to cast it into the sea, and it will come and find me.\"    The fisherman thanked the King of the Caves, and took the silver fish.  It was about the length of your little finger, and had pale moon-stones  for eyes. The fisherman hung the talisman on a chain and wore it round  his neck.    From that morning on, everything prospered with the youth. His boat  never leaked, he was never caught in a storm, and the fish came to his  lines and nets the instant he threw them overboard. Within a year or two  he had grown so rich that he was able to buy the finest merchant ship in  the world, and became a master mariner. Surely no more splendid fellow  than this gallant, young captain was ever found on the Seven Seas. He  sailed to cold and foggy Flannel Land, where the inhabitants all have  incurable head colds, and have no other cloth but red flannel; he traded  in the ports of gorgeous Velvet Land, whose inhabitants dress in velvet,  and cover their walls with velvet hangings and their floors with velvet  rugs.    One pleasant morning, running before a fine westerly breeze, he came to  the Eastern Islands. Down the street of the bazaar walked the Master  Mariner, followed by those who had articles to sell. Some showed him  bright-colored birds which they had caught in the forests; others waved  squares of figured cloth and called upon him to buy them; others still  offered strange flasks and bottles of brass and gleaming copper. At the  end of the street, the Master Mariner discovered a little quiet counter  on which lay some dozens of puffy and distended brown-leather bags.    \"What are these?\" said the Master Mariner to a tall, lean man with  beady, brown eyes who was in charge of the shop.    \"These are breezes, Master Captain,\" replied the shopman. \"If you are  going south, here is a bag of a very reliable northwest wind\" (he picked  up one of the brown bags); \"if you are going east, here are some of the  best-assorted westerly gusts. I am selling them at a very low price  to-day, in fact at less than they cost me. What will you have?\"    \"I'll have a smart easterly,\" replied the Master Mariner.    He put down fifty gold pieces on the counter, took the bag which the  shopman gave him, and walked away.    Now all these leather bags looked very much alike, and instead of  selling the Master Mariner a brisk easterly breeze, the shopman had made  an error, and sold him a frightful storm.    Again the Master Mariner went to sea; but luckily for him, he put the  imprisoned storm away in a locker, intending to use it on some other  voyage. Presently he came to Silk Land, loveliest of all the Cloth  Islands. There the inhabitants dress only in the finest of silks; the  roofs and walls are covered with layers of silk; the sun always shines,  and pretty birds with silken plumage chatter in the fern-like trees.      [Illustration: Man falling into the ocean from a ship with a large white  sail.]      Splash! And the Master Mariner fell into the sea.      Now the island of Silk Land was at this time ruled by the prettiest of  princesses. She was about eighteen years old; she was tall for her age,  and her eyes were quite the loveliest shade of brown. When the Master  Mariner's fine ship came into the harbor of Silk Land, cleaving the  turquoise water, and"]]]
