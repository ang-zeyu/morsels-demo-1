But during the days of the Saracens it  became not only a very busy city but also a very beautiful city. The  Arabian poets extolled its charms in terms that sound to us exceedingly  extravagant. One of them wrote: \"Oh how beautiful is the lakelet of the  twin palms and the island where the spacious palace stands. The limpid  waters of the double springs resemble liquid pearls, and their basin is  a sea; you would say that the branches of the trees stretched down to  see the fishes in the pool and smile at them. The great fishes in those  clear waters, and the birds among the gardens tune their songs. The ripe  oranges of the island are like fire that burns on boughs of emerald; the  pale lemon reminds me of a lover who has passed the night in weeping for  his absent darling. The two palms may be compared to lovers who have  gained an inaccessible retreat against their enemies, or raise  themselves erect in pride to confound the murmurs and the ill thoughts  of jealous men. O palms of two lakelets of Palermo, ceaseless,  undisturbed, and plenteous days for ever keep your freshness.\"    With the coming of the Normans Palermo enjoyed even greater prosperity  than had been experienced under the liberal rule of the Saracens. This  was the most brilliant period in the history of the city. The population  was even more mixed than during Moslem supremacy. Besides the Greeks,  Normans, Saracens, and Hebrews, there were commercial colonies of Slavs,  Venetians, Lombardians, Catalans, and Pisans.    The most interesting public monuments at Palermo date from the Norman  period; and while many of the buildings are strikingly Saracenic in  character and recall similar structures erected by the Arabs in Spain,  it will be remembered that the Normans brought no trained architects to  the island, but employed the Arabs, Greeks, and Hebrews who had already  been in the service of the Saracen emirs. But the Arab influence in  architecture was dominant, and it survived well into the fourteenth  century.          GIRGENTI[35]    BY EDWARD A. FREEMAN      The reported luxury of the Sikeliot cities in this age is, in the  double-edged saying of Empedocles, connected with one of their noblest  tastes. They built their houses as if they were going to live for ever.  And if their houses, how much more their temples and other public  buildings? In some of the Sikeliot cities, this was the most brilliant  time of architectural splendor. At Syracuse indeed the greatest  buildings which remain to tell their own story belong either to an  earlier or to a later time. It is the theater alone, as in its first  estate a probable work of the first Hieron, which at all connects itself  with our present time. But at Akragas[36] and at Selinous the greatest  of the existing buildings belong to the days of republican freedom and  independence. At Akragas what the tyrant began the democracy went on  with. The series of temples that line the southern wall are due to an  impulse which began under Theron and went on to the days of the  Carthaginian siege.    Of the greatest among them, the temple of Olympian Zeus, this is  literally true. There can be little doubt that it was begun as one of  the thank-offerings after the victory of Himera, and it is certain that  at the coming of Hannibal and Hamilkon it was still so far imperfect  that the roof was not yet added. It was therefore in building during a  time of more than seventy years, years which take in the whole of the  brilliant days of Akragantine freedom and well-being.    To the same period also belong the other temples in the lower city,  temples which abide above ground either standing or in ruins, while the  older temples in the akropolis have to be looked for underneath  buildings of later ages. It was a grand conception to line the southern  wall, the wall most open to the attacks of mortal enemies, with this  wonderful series of holy places of the divine protectors of the city. It  was a conception due, we may believe, in the first instance, to Theron,  but which the democracy fully entered into and carried out. The two best  preserved of the range stand to the east; one indeed occupies the  southeastern corner of the fortified enclosure.    Next in order to the west comes the temple which bears a name not  unlikely, but altogether impossible and unmeaning, the so-called temple  of Concord. No reasonable guess can be made at its pagan dedication; in  the fifteenth century of our era it followed the far earlier precedent  of the temples in the akropolis. It became the church of Saint Gregory,  not of any of the great pontiffs and doctors of the Church, but of the  local bishop whose full description as Saint Gregory of the Turnips can  hardly be written without a smile. The peristyle was walled up, and  arches were cut through the walls of the cella, exactly as in the great  church of Syracuse. Saint Gregory of Girgenti plays no such part in the  world's history as was played by the Panagia of Syracuse; we may  therefore be more inclined to extend some mercy to the Bourbon king who  set free the columns as we now see them. When he had gone so far, one  might even wish that he had gone on to wall up the arches. In each of  the former states of the building there was a solid wall somewhere to  give shelter from the blasts which sweep round this exposed spot. As the  building now stands, it is, after the Athenian house of Theseus and  Saint George, the best preserved Greek temple in being. Like its fellow  to the east, it is a building of moderate size, of the middle stage of  Doric, with columns less massive than those of Syracuse and Corinth,  less slender than those of Nemea.    Again to the west stood a temple of greater size, nearly ranging in  scale with the Athenian Parthenon, which is assigned, with far more of  likelihood than the other names, to Herakles. Save one patched-up column  standing amid the general ruin, it has, in the language of the prophet,  become heaps. All that is left is a mass of huge stones, among which we  can see the mighty columns, fallen, each in its place, overthrown, it is  clear, by no hand of man but by those powers of the nether world whose  sway is felt in every corner of Sicilian soil.    These three temples form a continuous range along the eastern part of  the southern wall of the city. To the west of them, parted from them by  a gate, which, in Roman times at least, bore, as at Constantinople and  Spalato, the name of Golden, rose the mightiest work of Akragantine  splendor and devotion, the great Olympieion itself. Of this gigantic  building, the vastest Greek temple in Europe, we happily have somewhat  full descriptions from men who had looked at it, if not in the days of  its full glory, yet at least when it was a house standing up, and not a  ruin. As it now lies, a few fragments of wall still standing amid  confused heaps of fallen stones, of broken columns and capitals, no  building kindles a more earnest desire to see it as it stood in the days  of its perfection.

For, in several places, the steps are from nine to ten feet in  the ground, and there is no hill near, from which the stone or mold  could have fallen. Besides, the stones lie in their natural position,  and no ruins are found near them.    The columns are all standing; two which had fallen, have very recently  been raised again. How far the columns rested on a socle is hard to say;  and without an engraving it is difficult to give an idea of their  present state. At some points it would seem as if the pillars rested on  the fourth step. In that case to enter the temple you would have to go  down a step. In other places, however, the uppermost step is cut  through, and then it looks as if the columns had rested on bases; and  then again these spaces have been filled up, and so we have once more  the first case. An architect is necessary to determine this point.    The sides have twelve columns, not reckoning the corner ones; the back  and front six, including them. The rollers on which the stones were  moved along, still lie around you on the steps.

They called her in, and she  came into the room and sat down by the side of the oven to warm herself  and eat her breakfast. The little men said,    \"Give us some of it.\"    \"Willingly,\" answered she, breaking her little piece of bread in two,  and giving them half. They then said,    \"What are you doing here in the wood this winter time in your little  thin frock?\"    \"Oh,\" answered she, \"I have to get a basket of strawberries, and I must  not go home without them.\"    When she had eaten her bread they gave her a broom, and told her to go  and sweep the snow away from the back door. When she had gone outside to  do it the little men talked among themselves about what they should do  for her, as she was so good and pretty, and had shared her bread with  them. Then the first one said,    \"She shall grow prettier every day.\" The second said,    \"Each time she speaks a piece of gold shall fall from her mouth.\" The  third said,    \"A king shall come and take her for his wife.\"    In the meanwhile the girl was doing as the little men had told her, and  had cleared the snow from the back of the little house, and what do you  suppose she found? fine ripe strawberries, showing dark red against the  snow! Then she joyfully filled her little basket full, thanked the  little men, shook hands with them all, and ran home in haste to bring  her step-mother the thing she longed for. As she went in and said, \"Good  evening,\" a piece of gold fell from her mouth at once. Then she related  all that had happened to her in the wood, and at each word that she  spoke gold pieces fell out of her mouth, so that soon they were  scattered all over the room.    \"Just look at her pride and conceit!\" cried the step-sister, \"throwing  money about in this way!\" but in her heart she was jealous because of  it, and wanted to go too into the wood to fetch strawberries. But the  mother said,    \"No, my dear little daughter, it is too cold, you will be frozen to  death.\"    But she left her no peace, so at last the mother gave in, got her a  splendid fur coat to put on, and gave her bread and butter and cakes to  eat on the way.    The girl went into the wood and walked straight up to the little house.  The three little men peeped out again, but she gave them no greeting,  and without looking round or taking any notice of them she came stumping  into the room, sat herself down by the oven, and began to eat her bread  and butter and cakes.    \"Give us some of that,\" cried the little men, but she answered,    \"I've not enough for myself; how can I give away any?\"    Now when she had done with her eating, they said,    \"Here is a broom, go and sweep all clean by the back door.\"    \"Oh, go and do it yourselves,\" answered she; \"I am not your housemaid.\"    But when she saw that they were not going to give her anything, she went  out to the door. Then the three little men said among themselves,    \"What shall we do to her, because she is so unpleasant, and has such a  wicked jealous heart, grudging everybody everything?\" The first said,    \"She shall grow uglier every day.\" The second said,    \"Each time she speaks a toad shall jump out of her mouth at every word.\"  The third said,    \"She shall die a miserable death.\"    The girl was looking outside for strawberries, but as she found none,  she went sulkily home. And directly she opened her mouth to tell her  mother what had happened to her in the wood a toad sprang out of her  mouth at each word, so that every one who came near her was quite  disgusted.    The step-mother became more and more set against the man's daughter,  whose beauty increased day by day, and her only thought was how to do  her some injury. So at last she took a kettle, set it on the fire, and  scalded some yarn in it. When it was ready she hung it over the poor  girl's shoulder, and gave her an axe, and she was to go to the frozen  river and break a hole in the ice, and there to rinse the yarn. She  obeyed, and went and hewed a hole in the ice, and as she was about it  there came by a splendid coach, in which the King sat. The coach stood  still, and the King said,    \"My child, who art thou, and what art thou doing there?\" She answered,    \"I am a poor girl, and am rinsing yarn.\"    Then the King felt pity for her, and as he saw that she was very  beautiful, he said,    \"Will you go with me?\"    \"Oh yes, with all my heart,\" answered she; and she felt very glad to be  out of the way of her mother and sister.    So she stepped into the coach and went off with the King; and when they  reached his castle the wedding was celebrated with great splendour, as  the little men in the wood had foretold.    At the end of a year the young Queen had a son; and as the step-mother  had heard of her great good fortune she came with her daughter to the  castle, as if merely to pay the King and Queen a visit. One day, when  the King had gone out, and when nobody was about, the bad woman took the  Queen by the head, and her daughter took her by the heels, and dragged  her out of bed, and threw her out of the window into a stream that  flowed beneath it. Then the old woman put her ugly daughter in the bed,  and covered her up to her chin. When the King came back, and wanted to  talk to his wife a little, the old woman cried,    \"Stop, stop! she is sleeping nicely; she must be kept quiet to-day.\"    The King dreamt of nothing wrong, and came again the next morning; and  as he spoke to his wife, and she answered him, there jumped each time  out of her mouth a toad instead of the piece of gold as heretofore. Then  he asked why that should be, and the old woman said it was because of  her great weakness, and that it would pass away.    But in the night, the boy who slept in the kitchen saw how something in  the likeness of a duck swam up the gutter, and said,--        \"My King, what mak'st thou?      Sleepest thou, or wak'st thou?\"    But there was no answer. Then it said,        \"What cheer my two guests keep they?\"    So the kitchen-boy answered,        \"In bed all soundly sleep they.\"    It asked again,        \"And my little baby, how does _he_?\"    And he answered,        \"He sleeps in his cradle quietly.\"    Then the duck took the shape of the Queen and went to the child, and  gave him to drink, smoothed his little bed, covered him up again, and  then, in the likeness of a duck, swam back down the gutter. In this way  she came two nights, and on the third she said to the kitchen-boy,    \"Go and tell the King to brandish his sword three times over me on the  threshold!\"    Then the kitchen-boy ran and told the King, and he came with his sword  and brandished it three times over the duck, and at the third time his  wife stood before him living, and hearty, and sound, as she had been  before.    The King was greatly rejoiced, but he hid the Queen in a chamber until  the Sunday came when the child was to be baptized. And after the baptism  he said,    \"What does that person deserve who drags another out of bed and throws  him in the water?\"    And the old woman answered,    \"No better than to be put into a cask with iron nails in it, and to be  rolled in it down the hill into the water.\"    Then said the King,    \"You have spoken your own sentence;\" and he ordered a cask to be  fetched, and the old woman and her daughter were put into it, and the  top hammered down, and the cask was rolled down the hill into the river.          THE THREE SPINSTERS      THERE was once a girl who was lazy and would not spin, and her mother  could not persuade her to it, do what she would. At last the mother  became angry and out of patience, and gave her a good beating, so that  she cried out loudly. At that moment the Queen was going by; as she  heard the crying, she stopped; and, going into the house, she asked the  mother why she was beating her daughter, so that every one outside in  the street could hear her cries.    The woman was ashamed to tell of her daughter's laziness, so she said,    \"I cannot stop her from spinning; she is for ever at it, and I am poor  and cannot furnish her with flax enough.\"    Then the Queen answered,    \"I like nothing better than the sound of the spinning-wheel, and always  feel happy when I hear its humming; let me take your daughter with me to  the castle--I have plenty of flax, she shall spin there to her heart's  content.\"    The mother was only too glad of the offer, and the Queen took the girl  with her. When they reached the castle the Queen showed her three rooms  which were filled with the finest flax as full as they could hold.    \"Now you can spin me this flax,\" said she, \"and when you can show it me  all done you shall have my eldest son for bridegroom; you may be poor,  but I make nothing of that--your industry is dowry enough.\"    The girl was inwardly terrified, for she could not have spun the flax,  even if she were to live to be a hundred years old, and were to sit  spinning every day of her life from morning to evening. And when she  found herself alone she began to weep, and sat so for three days without  putting her hand to it. On the third day the Queen came, and when she  saw that nothing had been done of the spinning she was much surprised;  but the girl excused herself by saying that she had not been able to  begin because of the distress she was in at leaving her home and her  mother. The excuse contented the Queen, who said, however, as she went  away,    \"To-morrow you must begin to work.\"    When the girl found herself alone again she could not tell how to help  herself or what to do, and in her perplexity she went and gazed out of  the window. There she saw three women passing by, and the first of them  had a broad flat foot, the second had a big under-lip that hung down  over her chin, and the third had a remarkably broad thumb. They all of  them stopped in front of the window, and called out to know what"]]]
