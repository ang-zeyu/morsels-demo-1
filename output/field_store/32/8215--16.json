The nucleus subsequently divides    repeatedly, until there are eight nuclei, about which the protoplasm    collects to form as many oval masses, each of which develops a wall    and becomes a spore (Figs. ii-iv). These are imbedded in protoplasm,    which is at first granular, but afterwards becomes almost    transparent. As the spores ripen, the wall acquires a beautiful    violet-purple color, changing later to a dark purple-brown, and    marked with irregular longitudinal ridges (Fig. 43, _F_). The    full-grown spore sacs (Fig. 43, _E_, _W_) are oblong in shape, and    attached by a short stalk. The sterile filaments between them often    become curiously enlarged at the end (_G_). As the spore fruit    ripens, it opens at the top, and spreads out so as to expose the    spore sacs as they discharge their contents (Fig. 43, _D_).    Of the larger cup fungi, those belonging to the genus _Peziza_  (Fig. 43, _H_) are common, growing on bits of rotten wood on the  ground in woods. They are sometimes bright scarlet or orange-red, and  very showy. Another curious form is the morel (_Morchella_), common in  the spring in dry woods. It is stalked like a mushroom, but the  surface of the conical cap is honeycombed with shallow depressions,  lined with the spore sacs.      ORDER _Lichenes_.    Under the name of lichens are comprised a large number of fungi,  differing a good deal in structure, but most of them not unlike the  cup fungi. They are, with few exceptions, parasitic upon various forms  of algae, with which they are so intimately associated as to form  apparently a single plant. They grow everywhere on exposed rocks, on  the ground, trunks of trees, fences, etc., and are found pretty much  the world over. Among the commonest of plants are the lichens of the  genus _Parmelia_ (Fig. 44, _A_), growing everywhere on tree trunks,  wooden fences, etc., forming gray, flattened expansions, with much  indented and curled margins. When dry, the plant is quite brittle, but  on moistening becomes flexible, and at the same time more or less  decidedly green in color. The lower surface is white or brown, and  often develops root-like processes by which it is fastened to the  substratum. Sometimes small fragments of the plant become detached in  such numbers as to form a grayish powder over certain portions of it.  These, when supplied with sufficient moisture, will quickly produce  new individuals.    Not infrequently the spore fruits are to be met with flat discs of a  reddish brown color, two or three millimetres in diameter, and closely  resembling a small cup fungus. They are at first almost closed, but  expand as they mature (Fig. 44, _A_, _ap._).    [Illustration: FIG. 44.--_A_, a common lichen (_Parmelia_), of the  natural size. _ap._ spore fruit. _B_, section through one of the spore  fruits, x 5. _C_, section through the body of a gelatinous lichen  (_Collema_), showing the _Nostoc_ individuals surrounded by the fungus  filaments, x 300. _D_, a spermagonium of _Collema_, x 25. _E_, a  single _Nostoc_ thread. _F_, spore sacs and paraphyses of _Usnea_,  x 300. _G_, _Protococcus_ cells and fungus filaments of _Usnea_.]      If a thin vertical section of the plant is made and sufficiently    magnified, it is found to be made up of somewhat irregular,    thick-walled, colorless filaments, divided by cross-walls as in the    other sac-fungi. In the central parts of the plant these are rather    loose, but toward the outside become very closely interwoven and    often grown together, so as to form a tough rind. Among the    filaments of the outer portion are numerous small green cells, that    closer examination shows to be individuals of _Protococcus_, or some    similar green algae, upon which the lichen is parasitic. These are    sufficiently abundant to form a green line just inside the rind if    the section is examined with a simple lens (Fig. 44, _B_).      The spore fruits of the lichens resemble in all essential respects    those of the cup fungi, and the spore sacs (Fig. 44, _F_) are much    the same, usually, though not always, containing eight spores, which    are sometimes two-celled. The sterile filaments between the spore    sacs usually have thickened ends, which are dark-colored, and give    the color to the inner surface of the spore fruit.      In Figure 45, _H_, is shown one of the so-called \"_Soredia_,\"[7] a    group of the algae, upon which the lichen is parasitic, surrounded by    some of the filaments, the whole separating spontaneously from the    plant and giving rise to a new one.    [7] Sing. _soredium_.    Owing to the toughness of the filaments, the finer structure of the  lichens is often difficult to study, and free use of caustic potash is  necessary to soften and make them manageable.    [Illustration: FIG. 45.--Forms of lichens. _A_, a branch with lichens  growing upon it, one-half natural size. _B_, _Usnea_, natural size.  _ap._ spore fruit. _C_, _Sticta_, one-half natural size. _D_,  _Peltigera_, one-half natural size. _ap._ spore fruit. _E_, a single  spore fruit, x 2. _F_, _Cladonia_, natural size. _G_, a piece of bark  from a beech, with a crustaceous lichen (_Graphis_) growing upon it,  x 2. _ap._ spore fruit. _H_, _Soredium_ of a lichen, x 300.]    According to their form, lichens are sometimes divided into the bushy  (fruticose), leafy (frondose), incrusting (crustaceous), and  gelatinous. Of the first, the long gray _Usnea_ (Fig. 45, _A_, _B_),  which drapes the branches of trees in swamps, is a familiar example;  of the second, _Parmelia_, _Sticta_ (Fig. 45, _C_) and _Peltigera_  (_D_) are types; of the third, _Graphis_ (_G_), common on the trunks  of beech-trees, to which it closely adheres; and of the last,  _Collema_ (Fig. 44, _C_, _D_, _E_), a dark greenish, gelatinous form,  growing on mossy tree trunks, and looking like a colony of _Nostoc_,  which indeed it is, but differing from an ordinary colony in being  penetrated everywhere by the filaments of the fungus growing upon it.      Not infrequently in this form, as well as in other lichens, special    cavities, known as spermogonia (Fig. 44, _D_), are found, in which    excessively small spores are produced, which have been claimed to    be male reproductive cells, but the latest investigations do not    support this theory.    [Illustration: FIG. 46.--Branch of a plum-tree attacked by black knot.  Natural size.]    The last group of the _Ascomycetes_ are the \"black fungi,\"  _Pyrenomycetes_, represented by the black knot of cherry and plum  trees, shown in Figure 46. They are mainly distinguished from the cup  fungi by producing their spore sacs in closed cavities. Some are  parasites; others live on dead wood, leaves, etc., forming very hard  masses, generally black in color, giving them their common name. Owing  to the hardness of the masses, they are very difficult to manipulate;  and, as the structure is not essentially different from that of the  _Discomycetes_, the details will not be entered into here.    Of the parasitic forms, one of the best known is the \"ergot\" of rye,  more or less used in medicine. Other forms are known that attack  insects, particularly caterpillars, which are killed by their attacks.          CHAPTER X.    FUNGI--_Continued_.      CLASS _Basidiomycetes_.    The _Basidiomycetes_ include the largest and most highly developed of  the fungi, among which are many familiar forms, such as the mushrooms,  toadstools, puff-balls, etc. Besides these large and familiar forms,  there are other simpler and smaller ones that, according to the latest  investigations, are probably related to them, though formerly regarded  as constituting a distinct group. The most generally known of these  lower _Basidiomycetes_ are the so-called rusts. The larger  _Basidiomycetes_ are for the most part saprophytes, living in decaying  vegetable matter, but a few are true parasites upon trees and others  of the flowering plants.    All of the group are characterized by the production of spores at the  top of special cells known as basidia,[8] the number produced upon a  single basidium varying from a single one to several.    [8] Sing. _basidium_.    Of the lower _Basidiomycetes_, the rusts (_Uredineae_) offer common and  easily procurable forms for study. They are exclusively parasitic in  their habits, growing within the tissues of the higher land plants,  which they often injure seriously. They receive their popular name  from the reddish color of the masses of spores that, when ripe, burst  through the epidermis of the host plant. Like many other fungi, the  rusts have several kinds of spores, which are often produced on  different hosts; thus one kind of wheat rust lives during part of its  life within the leaves of the barberry, where it produces spores quite  different from those upon the wheat; the cedar rust, in the same way,  is found at one time attacking the leaves of the wild crab-apple and  thorn.

All these are items in the description of a winter evening which must  surely be familiar to everybody born in a high latitude.  And it is  evident that most of these delicacies, like ice-cream, require a very low  temperature of the atmosphere to produce them; they are fruits which  cannot be ripened without weather stormy or inclement in some way or  other.  I am not \"_particular_,\" as people say, whether it be snow, or  black frost, or wind so strong that (as Mr. --- says) \"you may lean your  back against it like a post.\"  I can put up even with rain, provided it  rains cats and dogs; but something of the sort I must have, and if I have  it not, I think myself in a manner ill-used; for why am I called on to  pay so heavily for winter, in coals and candles, and various privations  that will occur even to gentlemen, if I am not to have the article good  of its kind?  No, a Canadian winter for my money, or a Russian one, where  every man is but a co-proprietor with the north wind in the fee-simple of  his own ears.  Indeed, so great an epicure am I in this matter that I  cannot relish a winter night fully if it be much past St. Thomas's day,  and have degenerated into disgusting tendencies to vernal appearances.  No, it must be divided by a thick wall of dark nights from all return of  light and sunshine.  From the latter weeks of October to Christmas Eve,  therefore, is the period during which happiness is in season, which, in  my judgment, enters the room with the tea-tray; for tea, though ridiculed  by those who are naturally of coarse nerves, or are become so from wine-  drinking, and are not susceptible of influence from so refined a  stimulant, will always be the favourite beverage of the intellectual;  and, for my part, I would have joined Dr. Johnson in a _bellum  internecinum_ against Jonas Hanway, or any other impious person, who  should presume to disparage it.  But here, to save myself the trouble of  too much verbal description, I will introduce a painter, and give him  directions for the rest of the picture.  Painters do not like white  cottages, unless a good deal weather-stained; but as the reader now  understands that it is a winter night, his services will not be required  except for the inside of the house.    Paint me, then, a room seventeen feet by twelve, and not more than seven  and a half feet high.  This, reader, is somewhat ambitiously styled in my  family the drawing-room; but being contrived \"a double debt to pay,\" it  is also, and more justly, termed the library, for it happens that books  are the only article of property in which I am richer than my neighbours.  Of these I have about five thousand, collected gradually since my  eighteenth year.  Therefore, painter, put as many as you can into this  room.  Make it populous with books, and, furthermore, paint me a good  fire, and furniture plain and modest, befitting the unpretending cottage  of a scholar.  And near the fire paint me a tea-table, and (as it is  clear that no creature can come to see one such a stormy night) place  only two cups and saucers on the tea-tray; and, if you know how to paint  such a thing symbolically or otherwise, paint me an eternal  tea-pot--eternal _a parte ante_ and _a parte post_--for I usually drink  tea from eight o'clock at night to four o'clock in the morning.  And as  it is very unpleasant to make tea or to pour it out for oneself, paint me  a lovely young woman sitting at the table.  Paint her arms like Aurora's  and her smiles like Hebe's.  But no, dear M., not even in jest let me  insinuate that thy power to illuminate my cottage rests upon a tenure so  perishable as mere personal beauty, or that the witchcraft of angelic  smiles lies within the empire of any earthly pencil.  Pass then, my good  painter, to something more within its power; and the next article brought  forward should naturally be myself--a picture of the Opium-eater, with  his \"little golden receptacle of the pernicious drug\" lying beside him on  the table.  As to the opium, I have no objection to see a picture of  _that_, though I would rather see the original.  You may paint it if you  choose, but I apprise you that no \"little\" receptacle would, even in  1816, answer _my_ purpose, who was at a distance from the \"stately  Pantheon,\" and all druggists (mortal or otherwise).  No, you may as well  paint the real receptacle, which was not of gold, but of glass, and as  much like a wine-decanter as possible.  Into this you may put a quart of  ruby-coloured laudanum; that, and a book of German Metaphysics placed by  its side, will sufficiently attest my being in the neighbourhood.  But as  to myself--there I demur.  I admit that, naturally, I ought to occupy the  foreground of the picture; that being the hero of the piece, or (if you  choose) the criminal at the bar, my body should be had into court.  This  seems reasonable; but why should I confess on this point to a painter? or  why confess at all?  If the public (into whose private ear I am  confidentially whispering my confessions, and not into any painter's)  should chance to have framed some agreeable picture for itself of the  Opium-eater's exterior, should have ascribed to him, romantically an  elegant person or a handsome face, why should I barbarously tear from it  so pleasing a delusion--pleasing both to the public and to me?  No; paint  me, if at all, according to your own fancy, and as a painter's fancy  should teem with beautiful creations, I cannot fail in that way to be a  gainer.  And now, reader, we have run through all the ten categories of  my condition as it stood about 1816-17, up to the middle of which latter  year I judge myself to have been a happy man, and the elements of that  happiness I have endeavoured to place before you in the above sketch of  the interior of a scholar's library, in a cottage among the mountains, on  a stormy winter evening.    But now, farewell--a long farewell--to happiness, winter or summer!  Farewell to smiles and laughter!  Farewell to peace of mind!  Farewell to  hope and to tranquil dreams, and to the blessed consolations of sleep.  For more than three years and a half I am summoned away from these.  I am  now arrived at an Iliad of woes, for I have now to record        THE PAINS OF OPIUM         As when some great painter dips     His pencil in the gloom of earthquake and eclipse.       SHELLEY'S _Revolt of Islam_.    Reader, who have thus far accompanied me, I must request your attention  to a brief explanatory note on three points:    1.  For several reasons I have not been able to compose the notes for  this part of my narrative into any regular and connected shape.  I give  the notes disjointed as I find them, or have now drawn them up from  memory.  Some of them point to their own date, some I have dated, and  some are undated.  Whenever it could answer my purpose to transplant them  from the natural or chronological order, I have not scrupled to do so.  Sometimes I speak in the present, sometimes in the past tense.  Few of  the notes, perhaps, were written exactly at the period of time to which  they relate; but this can little affect their accuracy, as the  impressions were such that they can never fade from my mind.  Much has  been omitted.  I could not, without effort, constrain myself to the task  of either recalling, or constructing into a regular narrative, the whole  burthen of horrors which lies upon my brain.  This feeling partly I plead  in excuse, and partly that I am now in London, and am a helpless sort of  person, who cannot even arrange his own papers without assistance; and I  am separated from the hands which are wont to perform for me the offices  of an amanuensis.    2.  You will think perhaps that I am too confidential and communicative  of my own private history.  It may be so.  But my way of writing is  rather to think aloud, and follow my own humours, than much to consider  who is listening to me; and if I stop to consider what is proper to be  said to this or that person, I shall soon come to doubt whether any part  at all is proper.  The fact is, I place myself at a distance of fifteen  or twenty years ahead of this time, and suppose myself writing to those  who will be interested about me hereafter; and wishing to have some  record of time, the entire history of which no one can know but myself, I  do it as fully as I am able with the efforts I am now capable of making,  because I know not whether I can ever find time to do it again.    3.  It will occur to you often to ask, why did I not release myself from  the horrors of opium by leaving it off or diminishing it?  To this I must  answer briefly: it might be supposed that I yielded to the fascinations  of opium too easily; it cannot be supposed that any man can be charmed by  its terrors.  The reader may be sure, therefore, that I made attempts  innumerable to reduce the quantity.  I add, that those who witnessed the  agonies of those attempts, and not myself, were the first to beg me to  desist.  But could not have I reduced it a drop a day, or, by adding  water, have bisected or trisected a drop?  A thousand drops bisected  would thus have taken nearly six years to reduce, and that way would  certainly not have answered.  But this is a common mistake of those who  know nothing of opium experimentally; I appeal to those who do, whether  it is not always found that down to a certain point it can be reduced  with ease and even pleasure, but that after that point further reduction "]]]
