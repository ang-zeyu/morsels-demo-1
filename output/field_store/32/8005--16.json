DON FRANCISCO DE QUEVEDO                  EPISTOLA SATIRICA Y CENSORIA    Contra las costumbres presentes de los castellanos, escrita al  Conde-Duque de Olivares.            No he de callar, por mas que con el dedo,          Ya tocando la boca, o ya la frente,  5       Silencio avises o amenaces miedo.            ?No ha de haber un espiritu valiente?          ?Siempre se ha de sentir lo que se dice?          ?Nunca se ha de decir lo que se siente?            Hoy sin miedo que libre escandalice  10      Puede hablar el ingenio, asegurado          De que mayor poder le atemorice.            En otros siglos pudo ser pecado          Severo estudio y la verdad desnuda,          Y romper el silencio el bien hablado.  15        Pues sepa quien lo niega y quien lo duda          Que es lengua la verdad de Dios severo          Y la lengua de Dios nunca fue muda.            Son la verdad y Dios, Dios verdadero:          Ni eternidad divina los separa,  20      Ni de los dos alguno fue primero.                                                                 page 16                 LETRILLA SATIRICA            Poderoso caballero        Es don Dinero.

Nace en las Indias honrado,        Donde el mundo le acompana;        Viene a morir en Espana        Y es en Genova enterrado.  15    Y pues quien le trae al lado        Es hermoso, aunque sea fiero,        Poderoso caballero        Es don Dinero.          Es galan y es como un oro,  20    Tiene quebrado el color,        Persona de gran valor,        Tan cristiano como moro;        Pues que da y quita el decoro        Y quebranta cualquier fuero,  25    Poderoso caballero        Es don Dinero.          Son sus padres principales                              page 17        Y es de nobles descendiente,        Porque en las venas de Oriente        Todas las sangres son reales:        Y pues es quien hace iguales  5     Al duque y al ganadero,        Poderoso caballero        Es don Dinero.          DON ESTEBAN MANUEL DE VILLEGAS         CANTILENA: DE UN PAJARILLO            Yo vi sobre un tomillo        Quejarse un pajarillo,  10    Viendo su nido amado,        De quien era caudillo,        De un labrador robado.        Vile tan congojado        Por tal atrevimiento  15    Dar mil quejas al viento,        Para que al cielo santo        Lleve su tierno llanto,        Lleve su triste acento.        Ya con triste armonia,  20    Esforzando el intento,        Mil quejas repetia;        Ya cansado callaba,        Y al nuevo sentimiento                                    page 18        Ya sonoro volvia.        Ya circular volaba,        Ya rastrero corria,        Ya pues de rama en rama  5     Al rustico seguia;        Y saltando en la grama,        Parece que decia:        \"Dame, rustico fiero,        Mi dulce compania\";  10    Y que le respondia        El rustico: \"No quiero.\"               DON PEDRO CALDERON DE LA BARCA                        SONETO            Estas que fueron pompa y alegria        Despertando al albor de la manana,        A la tarde seran lastima vana  15    Durmiendo en brazos de la noche fria.          Este matiz que al cielo desafia,        Iris listado de oro, nieve y grana,        Sera escarmiento de la vida humana:        iTanto se emprende en termino de un dia!  20      A florecer las rosas madrugaron,        Y para envejecerse florecieron:        Cuna y sepulcro en un boton hallaron.          Tales los hombres sus fortunas vieron:        En un dia nacieron y expiraron;  25    Que pasados los siglos, horas fueron.                                                                  page 19            CONSEJO DE CRESPO A SU HIJO        EL ALCALDE DE ZALAMEA (11, 21)          Por la gracia de Dios, Juan,        Eres de linaje limpio        Mas que el sol, pero villano:        Lo uno y lo otro te digo,  5     Aquello, porque no humilles        Tanto tu orgullo y tu brio,        Que dejes, desconfiado,        De aspirar con cuerdo arbitrio        A ser mas; lo otro, porque  10    No vengas, desvanecido,        A ser menos: igualmente        Usa de entrambos designios        Con humildad; porque siendo        Humilde, con recto juicio  15    Acordaras lo mejor;        Y como tal, en olvido        Pondras cosas que suceden        Al reves en los altivos.        iCuantos, teniendo en el mundo  20    Algun defecto consigo,        Le han borrado por humildes!        Y ia cuantos, que no han tenido        Defecto, se le han hallado,        Por estar ellos mal vistos!  25    Se cortes sobremanera,        Se liberal y esparcido;                                   page 20        Que el sombrero y el dinero        Son los que hacen los amigos;        Y no vale tanto el oro        Que el sol engendra en el indio  5     Suelo que conduce el mar,        Como ser uno bienquisto.        No hables mal de las mujeres:        La mas humilde, te digo        Que es digna de estimacion,  10    Porque, al fin, dellas nacimos.                     FRAY DIEGO GONZALEZ                  EL MURCIELAGO ALEVOSO                       INVECTIVA            Estaba Mirta bella        Cierta noche formando en su aposento,        Con gracioso talento,        Una tierna cancion, y porque en ella  15    Satisfacer a Delio meditaba,        Que de su fe dudaba,        Con vehemente expresion le encarecia        El fuego que en su casto pecho ardia.          Y estando divertida,  20    Un murcielago fiero, isuerte insana!

The principal  seat of this apartment was a chair of state, raised a step or two from  the floor, and large enough to contain two persons. It was surmounted  by a canopy, which, as well as the cushions, side-curtains, and the very  footcloth, was composed of crimson velvet, embroidered with seed-pearl.  On the top of the canopy were two coronets, resembling those of an earl  and countess. Stools covered with velvet, and some cushions disposed in  the Moorish fashion, and ornamented with Arabesque needle-work,  supplied the place of chairs in this apartment, which contained musical  instruments, embroidery frames, and other articles for ladies' pastime.  Besides lesser lights, the withdrawing-room was illuminated by four  tall torches of virgin wax, each of which was placed in the grasp of  a statue, representing an armed Moor, who held in his left arm a round  buckler of silver, highly polished, interposed betwixt his breast  and the light, which was thus brilliantly reflected as from a crystal  mirror.    The sleeping chamber belonging to this splendid suite of apartments  was decorated in a taste less showy, but not less rich, than had been  displayed in the others. Two silver lamps, fed with perfumed oil,  diffused at once a delicious odour and a trembling twilight-seeming  shimmer through the quiet apartment. It was carpeted so thick that the  heaviest step could not have been heard, and the bed, richly heaped with  down, was spread with an ample coverlet of silk and gold; from under  which peeped forth cambric sheets and blankets as white as the lambs  which yielded the fleece that made them. The curtains were of blue  velvet, lined with crimson silk, deeply festooned with gold, and  embroidered with the loves of Cupid and Psyche. On the toilet was a  beautiful Venetian mirror, in a frame of silver filigree, and beside it  stood a gold posset-dish to contain the night-draught. A pair of pistols  and a dagger, mounted with gold, were displayed near the head of the  bed, being the arms for the night, which were presented to honoured  guests, rather, it may be supposed, in the way of ceremony than from any  apprehension of danger. We must not omit to mention, what was more  to the credit of the manners of the time, that in a small recess,  illuminated by a taper, were disposed two hassocks of velvet and gold,  corresponding with the bed furniture, before a desk of carved ebony.  This recess had formerly been the private oratory of the abbot; but the  crucifix was removed, and instead there were placed on the desk, two  Books of Common Prayer, richly bound, and embossed with silver. With  this enviable sleeping apartment, which was so far removed from every  sound save that of the wind sighing among the oaks of the park, that  Morpheus might have coveted it for his own proper repose, corresponded  two wardrobes, or dressing-rooms as they are now termed, suitably  furnished, and in a style of the same magnificence which we have already  described. It ought to be added, that a part of the building in the  adjoining wing was occupied by the kitchen and its offices, and  served to accommodate the personal attendants of the great and wealthy  nobleman, for whose use these magnificent preparations had been made.    The divinity for whose sake this temple had been decorated was well  worthy the cost and pains which had been bestowed. She was seated in the  withdrawing-room which we have described, surveying with the pleased eye  of natural and innocent vanity the splendour which had been so suddenly  created, as it were, in her honour. For, as her own residence at Cumnor  Place formed the cause of the mystery observed in all the preparations  for opening these apartments, it was sedulously arranged that, until she  took possession of them, she should have no means of knowing what was  going forward in that part of the ancient building, or of exposing  herself to be seen by the workmen engaged in the decorations. She had  been, therefore, introduced on that evening to a part of the mansion  which she had never yet seen, so different from all the rest that it  appeared, in comparison, like an enchanted palace. And when she first  examined and occupied these splendid rooms, it was with the wild and  unrestrained joy of a rustic beauty who finds herself suddenly invested  with a splendour which her most extravagant wishes had never imagined,  and at the same time with the keen feeling of an affectionate heart,  which knows that all the enchantment that surrounds her is the work of  the great magician Love.    The Countess Amy, therefore--for to that rank she was exalted by her  private but solemn union with England's proudest Earl--had for a time  flitted hastily from room to room, admiring each new proof of her lover  and her bridegroom's taste, and feeling that admiration enhanced as  she recollected that all she gazed upon was one continued proof of his  ardent and devoted affection. \"How beautiful are these hangings! How  natural these paintings, which seem to contend with life! How richly  wrought is that plate, which looks as if all the galleons of Spain had  been intercepted on the broad seas to furnish it forth! And oh, Janet!\"  she exclaimed repeatedly to the daughter of Anthony Foster, the close  attendant, who, with equal curiosity, but somewhat less ecstatic  joy, followed on her mistress's footsteps--\"oh, Janet! how much more  delightful to think that all these fair things have been assembled by  his love, for the love of me! and that this evening--this very evening,  which grows darker every instant, I shall thank him more for the love  that has created such an unimaginable paradise, than for all the wonders  it contains.\"    \"The Lord is to be thanked first,\" said the pretty Puritan, \"who gave  thee, lady, the kind and courteous husband whose love has done so much  for thee. I, too, have done my poor share. But if you thus run wildly  from room to room, the toil of my crisping and my curling pins will  vanish like the frost-work on the window when the sun is high.\"    \"Thou sayest true, Janet,\" said the young and beautiful Countess,  stopping suddenly from her tripping race of enraptured delight, and  looking at herself from head to foot in a large mirror, such as she had  never before seen, and which, indeed, had few to match it even in the  Queen's palace--\"thou sayest true, Janet!\" she answered, as she saw,  with pardonable self-applause, the noble mirror reflect such charms as  were seldom presented to its fair and polished surface; \"I have more of  the milk-maid than the countess, with these cheeks flushed with haste,  and all these brown curls, which you laboured to bring to order,  straying as wild as the tendrils of an unpruned vine. My falling ruff is  chafed too, and shows the neck and bosom more than is modest and seemly.  Come, Janet; we will practise state--we will go to the withdrawing-room,  my good girl, and thou shalt put these rebel locks in order, and  imprison within lace and cambric the bosom that beats too high.\"    They went to the withdrawing apartment accordingly, where the Countess  playfully stretched herself upon the pile of Moorish cushions, half  sitting, half reclining, half wrapt in her own thoughts, half listening  to the prattle of her attendant.    While she was in this attitude, and with a corresponding expression  betwixt listlessness and expectation on her fine and intelligent  features, you might have searched sea and land without finding anything  half so expressive or half so lovely. The wreath of brilliants which  mixed with her dark-brown hair did not match in lustre the hazel eye  which a light-brown eyebrow, pencilled with exquisite delicacy, and long  eyelashes of the same colour, relieved and shaded. The exercise she had  just taken, her excited expectation and gratified vanity, spread a glow  over her fine features, which had been sometimes censured (as beauty  as well as art has her minute critics) for being rather too pale. The  milk-white pearls of the necklace which she wore, the same which she had  just received as a true-love token from her husband, were excelled in  purity by her teeth, and by the colour of her skin, saving where the  blush of pleasure and self-satisfaction had somewhat stained the neck  with a shade of light crimson.--\"Now, have done with these busy fingers,  Janet,\" she said to her handmaiden, who was still officiously employed  in bringing her hair and her dress into order--\"have done, I say. I must  see your father ere my lord arrives, and also Master Richard Varney,  whom my lord has highly in his esteem--but I could tell that of him  would lose him favour.\"    \"Oh, do not do so, good my lady!\" replied Janet; \"leave him to God, who  punishes the wicked in His own time; but do not you cross Varney's path,  for so thoroughly hath he my lord's ear, that few have thriven who have  thwarted his courses.\"    \"And from whom had you this, my most righteous Janet?\" said the  Countess; \"or why should I keep terms with so mean a gentleman as  Varney, being as I am, wife to his master and patron?\"    \"Nay, madam,\" replied Janet Foster, \"your ladyship knows better than I;  but I have heard my father say he would rather cross a hungry wolf than  thwart Richard Varney in his projects. And he has often charged me to  have a care of holding commerce with him.\"    \"Thy father said well, girl, for thee,\" replied the lady, \"and I dare  swear meant well. It is a pity, though, his face and manner do little  match his true purpose--for I think his purpose may be true.\"    \"Doubt it not, my lady,\" answered Janet--\"doubt not that my father  purposes well, though he is a plain man, and his blunt looks may belie  his heart.\"    \"I will not doubt it, girl, were it only for thy sake; and yet he has  one of those faces which men tremble when they look on. I think even thy  mother, Janet--nay, have done with that poking-iron--could hardly look  upon him "]]]
