NOTES    =Chapman's Homer=:--George Chapman (1559?-1634) was an English poet. He  translated Homer from the Greek into English verse.    =moly=:--An herb with a black root and a white flower, which Hermes gave  to Odysseus in order to help him withstand the spell of the witch Circe.    =Circe=:--A witch who charmed her victims with a drink that she prepared  for them, and then changed them into the animals they in character most  resembled.    =Hermes=:--The messenger of the other Greek gods; he was crafty and  eloquent.    =The wise God=:--Hermes, or Mercury.      SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY    Before you try to study this poem carefully, find out something of the  story of Ulysses and Circe: when you have this information, the poem  will become clear. Notice how the author applies the old Greek tale to  the experiences of everyday life. This would be a good poem to memorize.

His history for that period is the history of  thousands who come to America, like him, with pockets empty, hands  untrained to the use of tools, minds cramped by centuries of repression  in their native land. Dozens of these men pass under your eyes every  day, my American friend, too absorbed in their honest affairs to notice  the looks of suspicion which you cast at them, the repugnance with which  you shrink from their touch. You see them shuffle from door to door with  a basket of spools and buttons, or bending over the sizzling irons in a  basement tailor shop, or rummaging in your ash can, or moving a pushcart  from curb to curb, at the command of the burly policeman. \"The Jew  peddler!\" you say, and dismiss him from your premises and from your  thoughts, never dreaming that the sordid drama of his days may have a  moral that concerns you. What if the creature with the untidy beard  carries in his bosom his citizenship papers? What if the cross-legged  tailor is supporting a boy in college who is one day going to mend your  state constitution for you? What if the ragpicker's daughters are  hastening over the ocean to teach your children in the public schools?  Think, every time you pass the greasy alien on the street, that he was  born thousands of years before the oldest native American; and he may  have something to communicate to you, when you two shall have learned a  common language. Remember that his very physiognomy is a cipher the key  to which it behooves you to search for most diligently.           *       *       *       *       *    By the time we joined my father, he had surveyed many avenues of  approach toward the coveted citadel of fortune. One of these, heretofore  untried, he now proposed to essay, armed with new courage, and cheered  on by the presence of his family. In partnership with an energetic  little man who had an English chapter in his history, he prepared to set  up a refreshment booth on Crescent Beach. But while he was completing  arrangements at the beach, we remained in town, where we enjoyed the  educational advantages of a thickly populated neighborhood; namely, Wall  Street, in the West End of Boston.    Anybody who knows Boston knows that the West and North Ends are the  wrong ends of that city. They form the tenement district, or, in the  newer phrase, the slums of Boston. Anybody who is acquainted with the  slums of any American metropolis knows that that is the quarter where  poor immigrants foregather, to live, for the most part, as unkempt,  half-washed, toiling, unaspiring foreigners; pitiful in the eyes of  social missionaries, the despair of boards of health, the hope of ward  politicians, the touchstone of American democracy. The well-versed  metropolitan knows the slums as a sort of house of detention for poor  aliens, where they live on probation till they can show a certificate of  good citizenship.    He may know all this and yet not guess how Wall Street, in the West End,  appears in the eyes of a little immigrant from Polotzk. What would the  sophisticated sight-seer say about Union Place, off Wall Street, where  my new home waited for me? He would say that it is no place at all, but  a short box of an alley. Two rows of three-story tenements are its  sides, a stingy strip of sky is its lid, a littered pavement is the  floor, and a narrow mouth its exit.    But I saw a very different picture on my introduction to Union Place. I  saw two imposing rows of brick buildings, loftier than any dwelling I  had ever lived in. Brick was even on the ground for me to tread on,  instead of common earth or boards. Many friendly windows stood open,  filled with uncovered heads of women and children. I thought the people  were interested in us, which was very neighborly. I looked up to the  topmost row of windows, and my eyes were filled with the May blue of an  American sky!    In our days of affluence in Russia we had been accustomed to upholstered  parlors, embroidered linen, silver spoons and candlesticks, goblets of  gold, kitchen shelves shining with copper and brass. We had feather-beds  heaped halfway to the ceiling; we had clothes presses dusky with velvet  and silk and fine woolen. The three small rooms into which my father now  ushered us, up one flight of stairs, contained only the necessary beds,  with lean mattresses; a few wooden chairs; a table or two; a mysterious  iron structure, which later turned out to be a stove; a couple of  unornamental kerosene lamps; and a scanty array of cooking-utensils and  crockery. And yet we were all impressed with our new home and its  furniture. It was not only because we had just passed through our seven  lean years, cooking in earthern vessels, eating black bread on holidays  and wearing cotton; it was chiefly because these wooden chairs and tin  pans were American chairs and pans that they shone glorious in our  eyes. And if there was anything lacking for comfort or decoration we  expected it to be presently supplied--at least, we children did. Perhaps  my mother alone, of us newcomers, appreciated the shabbiness of the  little apartment, and realized that for her there was as yet no laying  down of the burden of poverty.    Our initiation into American ways began"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17164"],[0,"Narrative of a Mission to Central Africa Performed in the Years 1850-51, Volume (#15)"],[1,"for the goats to feed  on. Then we came to a small wady full of _resou_, which our marabout  calls the \"meat of the camel;\" and all the camels at once stopped, and  for a long time obstinately refused to proceed. This appeared strange to  us, but on inquiry we found that the sagacious brutes remembered  perfectly well that until the evening there would be no herbage so good,  and were determined to have their fill whilst there was an opportunity.  The drivers, after indulging them a few moments, took them in flank, and  their shouts of \"_Isa! Isa!_\" and some blows, at length got the caravan  out of this elysium of grass into the hungry plain beyond. As we  proceeded, a cold bracing wind began to blow from the east, and  considerably chilled our frames. I had met the same weather four years  previously. Towards evening, however, it became warmer, as it usually  does. The country was bare and level, like an expanse of dull-coloured  water; and the palm-trees that cluster near the village rose slowly  above the horizon as we drew nigh. The sun had gone down, and the plain  stretched dim and shadowy around before we came in sight of the group of  hovels which form the village. As I looked back, the scattered camels  slowly toiling along could be faintly traced against the horizon.    The Sheikh of Agar received us well this time, sending us two fowls and  supper for our people. This place consists of huts made of palm-branches  and of mud hovels, several of which are in ruins. The same remark  constantly recurs in reference to almost all the towns of Barbary, both  towards the coast and far in the interior. The vital principle of  civilisation seems to have exhausted itself in those parts.    I was now in a country comparatively familiar to me, and knew that I had  but one more ride to reach the capital of Fezzan. Rising early on the  6th, therefore, I determined to press on in advance of the caravan; and  starting with warm weather, puffs of wind coming now from the  south-east, now from the north-west, very unsteadily--the atmosphere was  slightly murky, with sand flying about--I soon came in sight of the  palm-groves of Mourzuk, without making any other rencontre than a  Tuarick coursing over the desert in full costume. The old castle peeped  picturesquely through the trees, but I had still a good way to go before  reaching shelter. The sand and white earth that form the surface of the  oasis near the town were painfully dazzling to my eyes.    At length I reached the suburbs, where a few people stared curiously at  me. My arrival had been announced by the chaouches, who had gone on  about a quarter of an hour before; and at the eastern gate the soldiers  allowed me to pass without notice, or any allusion to _gumruk_. Mr.  Gagliuffi had come out to meet me; but having taken a different gate we  crossed, and I arrived on my camel at his house, and found it empty. My  veil being down in the streets I was recognised by no one. The acting  Governor had arranged to meet me with twenty horsemen, but I had taken  them all quite unawares. The letters forwarded requesting us to make a  halt in the suburbs, and then advance slowly in \"holiday costume,\" for  the sake of effect, had not reached me. However, they had hoisted the  Ottoman flag on the castle, in honour of our expected arrival,--a  compliment that had not before been paid to strangers, and one never  offered at Tripoli.    Our German friends arrived shortly afterwards, and we all had a very  hospitable reception from Mr. Gagliuffi, with whom we lodged. A few  calls were made upon us in the evening, but we were glad enough to seek  our beds. Next day the chief people of the city, the Kady and other  dignitaries, began early to visit us. When we had exchanged compliments  with them, we went in full European dress to wait on the acting Pasha.  We found him to be a very quiet, unassuming man, who gave us a most kind  and gentlemanlike reception, equal to anything of the kind of Tripoli.  He is a Turk, and recognised me as having been before at Mourzuk. We had  coffee, pipes, and sherbet made of oranges. Afterwards we visited the  Treasurer, who also gave us coffee, and was very civil; and finally  called upon the brother of the Governor of Ghat, who was writing letters  for us to-day.    I feel in better health than when I left Tripoli. Yet we are all a  little nervous about the climate of Mourzuk, which is situated in a  slight depression of the plain, in a place inclined to be marshy. The  Consul has just recovered from a severe illness.    We had been, in all, thirty-nine days from Tripoli, a considerable  portion of which time was spent in travelling. This makes a long  journey; but I am told that our camel-drivers should have brought us by  way of Sebha, and thus effected a saving of three or four days. The  greater portion of our sandy journey was unnecessary, and merely  undertaken that these gentlemen might have an opportunity of visiting  their wives and families.    On a retrospective view of the route from Tripoli to Mourzuk, _via_  Mizdah, I am inclined to divide the country, for convenience sake, into  a series of zones, or regions.    1st zone. This includes the sandy flat of the suburbs of the town of  Tripoli, with the date-palm plantations and the sand-hills contiguous.    2d zone. The mountains, or Tripoline Atlas, embracing the rising ground  with their influence on the northern side, and the olive and fig  plantations, covering the undulating ground on the southern side, where  the Barbary vegetation is seen in all its vigour and variety. This may  also be emphatically called the region of rain.    3d zone. The limestone hills and broad valleys, gradually assuming the  aridity of the Sahara as you proceed southward, between the town of  Kaleebah and Ghareeah; the olive plantations and corn-fields disappear,  entirely in this tract.    4th zone. The Hamadah, an immense desert plateau, separating Tripoli  from Fezzan.    5th zone. The sandy valleys and limestone rocks between El-Hasee and  Es-Shaty, where herbage and trees are found, affording food to numerous  gazelles, hares, and the wadan.    6th. The sand between Shaty and El-Wady, piled in masses, or heaps,  extending in undulating plains, and occasionally opening in small  valleys with herbage and trees.    7th. The sandy valleys of El-Wady, covered with forests of date-palms,  through which peep a number of small villages.    8th. The plateau of Mourzuk, consisting of shallow valleys, ridges of  low sandstone hills, and naked flats, or plains, sometimes of sand, at  others covered with pebbles and small stones.    All these zones beyond the Atlas are visited by only occasional showers,  or are entirely without rain, the vegetation depending upon irrigation  from wells. I do not go into further detail on this subject, because,  although our line of route was new, this stretch of country is tolerably  well known to the geographical reader.    I have omitted to mention, or to lay much stress on the fact, that we  were unable to procure sufficient camels at Tripoli to convey our goods  all the way to Mourzuk. We were compelled to leave three camel-loads  behind, in the first place, at Gharian; these were subsequently got on  to Kaleebah, and thence to Mizdah: but there the influence of Izhet  Pasha's circular letter entirely failed to procure for us three extra  camels, and we were compelled to push on to Mourzuk, leaving part of our  goods in the oasis. This circumstance caused me a great deal of  annoyance, both on the route and after our arrival, for it was a long  time before we got in all our baggage. However, it at last arrived, and  the delay only served to illustrate the difficulty of procuring  conveyance in these dismal countries, and to lead us into considerable  expense.

The Pashalic of Fezzan, although it occupies a considerable space upon  the map--advancing like a peninsula from the line of Barbary countries  into the Sahara--is in reality a very insignificant province. From all  that I can learn, its entire population does not exceed twenty-six  thousand souls, scattered about in little oases over a vast extent of  country. It is, in fact, a portion of the Sahara, in which fertile  valleys occur a little more frequently than in the other portions.  Immense deserts, sometimes perfectly arid, but at others slightly  sprinkled with herbage, separate these valleys; and are periodically  traversed by caravans, great and small, which in the course of time have  covered the country with a perfect network of tracks.    Fezzan is divided into ten districts, of which the principal is  El-Hofrah, containing the capital, Mourzuk, and several smaller towns.  It is here and there besprinkled with beautiful gardens, in which are  cultivated, besides the date-palm, several of the choicest fruits that  grow on the coast--as figs, grapes, peaches, pomegranates, and melons.  In these gardens, as in most of the oases of the desert, the fruit trees  that require most protection from the sun are planted between the palms,  which make a kind of roof with their long leaves. Abd-el-Galeel  destroyed many of these groves to punish their owners, refractory to his  authority.    Two crops are obtained in the year: in the spring, barley and wheat are  reaped; and in the summer and autumn, Indian corn, ghaseb, and other"]]]
