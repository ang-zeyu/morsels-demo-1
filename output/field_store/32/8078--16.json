We may well say, in the words of one of his most competent  critics:    \"Mozart was a king and a slave--king in his own beautiful realm of  music; slave of the circumstances and the conditions of this world.  Once over the boundaries of his own kingdom, and he was supreme; but the  powers of the earth acknowledged not his sovereignty.\"          BEETHOVEN.      I.    The name and memory of this composer awaken, in the heart of the lover  of music, sentiments of the deepest reverence and admiration. His life  was so marked with affliction and so isolated as to make him, in his  environment of conditions as a composer, a unique figure.    The principal fact which made the exterior life of Beethoven so bare of  the ordinary pleasures that brighten and sweeten existence, his total  deafness, greatly enriched his spiritual life. Music finally became to  him a purely intellectual conception, for he was without any sensual  enjoyment of its effects. To this Samson of music, for whom the ear was  like the eye to other men, Milton's lines may indeed well apply:         \"Oh! dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon!       Irrecoverably dark--total eclipse,       Without all hope of day!       Oh first created Beam, and thou, great Word,       'Let there be light,' and light was over all,       Why am I thus bereaved thy prime decree?       The sun to me is dark.\"    To his severe affliction we owe alike many of the defects of his  character and the splendors of his genius. All his powers, concentrated  into a spiritual focus, wrought such things as lift him into a solitary  greatness. The world has agreed to measure this man as it measures  Homer, Dante, and Shakespeare. We do not compare him with others.    Beethoven had the reputation among his contemporaries of being harsh,  bitter, suspicious, and unamiable. There is much to justify this in the  circumstances of his life; yet our readers will discover much to show,  on the other hand, how deep, strong, and tender was the heart which was  so wrung and tortured, and wounded to the quick by--    \"The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.\"    Weber gives a picture of Beethoven: \"The square Cyclopean figure attired  in a shabby coat with torn sleeves.\" Everybody will remember his noble,  austere face, as seen in the numerous prints: the square, massive head,  with the forest of rough hair; the strong features, so furrowed with the  marks of passion and sadness; the eyes, with their look of introspection  and insight; the whole expression of the countenance as of an ancient  prophet. Such was the impression made by Beethoven on all who saw him,  except in his moods of fierce wrath, which toward the last were not  uncommon, though short-lived. A sorely tried, sublimely gifted man, he  met his fate stubbornly, and worked out his great mission with all his  might and main, through long years of weariness and trouble. Posterity  has rewarded him by enthroning him on the highest peaks of musical fame.      II.    Ludwig van Beethoven was born at Bonn, in 1770. It is a singular fact  that at an early age he showed the deepest distaste for music, unlike  the other great composers, who evinced their bent from their earliest  years. His father was obliged to whip him severely before he would  consent to sit down at the harpsichord; and it was not till he was  past ten that his genuine interest in music showed itself. His first  compositions displayed his genius. Mozart heard him play them, and said,  \"Mind, you will hear that boy talked of.\" Haydn, too, met Beethoven for  the first and only time when the former was on his way to England,  and recognized his remarkable powers. He gave him a few lessons in  composition, and was after that anxious to claim the young Titan as a  pupil.    \"Yes,\" growled Beethoven, who for some queer reason never liked Haydn,  \"I had some lessons of him, indeed, but I was not his disciple. I never  learned anything from him.\"    Beethoven made a profound impression even as a youth on all who  knew him. Aside from the palpable marks of his power, there was  an indomitable _hauteur_, a mysterious, self-wrapped air as of one  constantly communing with the invisible, an unconscious assertion of  mastery about him, which strongly impressed the imagination.    At the very outset of his career, when life promised all fair and bright  things to him, two comrades linked themselves to him, and ever after  that refused to give him up--grim poverty and still grimmer disease.  About the same time that he lost a fixed salary through the death of  his friend the Elector of Cologne, he began to grow deaf. Early in  1800, walking one day in the woods with his devoted friend and pupil,  Ferdinand Ries, he disclosed the sad secret to him that the whole joyous  world of sound was being gradually closed up to him; the charm of the  human voice, the notes of the woodland birds, the sweet babblings of  Nature, jargon to others, but intelligible to genius, the full-born  splendors of _heard_ music--all, all were fast receding from his grasp.    Beethoven was extraordinarily sensitive to the influences of Nature.  Before his disease became serious he writes: \"I wander about here with  music-paper among the hills, and dales, and valleys, and scribble a good  deal. No man on earth can love the country as I do.\" But one of Nature's  most delightful modes of speech to man was soon to be utterly lost to  him. At last he became so deaf that the most stunning crash of thunder  or the _fortissimo_ of the full orchestra were to him as if they were  not. His bitter, heartrending cry of agony, when he became convinced  that the misfortune was irremediable, is full of eloquent despair: \"As  autumn leaves wither and fall, so are my hopes blighted. Almost as I  came, I depart. Even the lofty courage, which so often animated me in  the lovely days of summer, is gone forever. O Providence! vouchsafe me  one day of pure felicity! How long have I been estranged from the glad  echo of true joy! When, O my God! when shall I feel it again in the  temple of Nature and man? Never!\"    And the small-souled, mole-eyed gossips and critics called him hard,  churlish, and cynical--him, for whom the richest thing in Nature's  splendid dower had been obliterated, except a soul, which never in its  deepest sufferings lost its noble faith in God and man, or allowed its  indomitable courage to be one whit weakened. That there were periods  of utterly rayless despair and gloom we may guess; but not for long did  Beethoven's great nature cower before its evil genius.      III.    Within three years, from 1805 to 1808, Beethoven composed some of his  greatest works: the oratorio of \"The Mount of Olives,\" the opera of  \"Fidelio,\" and the two noble symphonies, \"Pastorale\" and \"Eroica,\"  besides a large number of concertos, sonatas, songs, and other  occasional pieces. However gloomy the externals of his life, his  creative activities knew no cessation.    The \"Sinfonia Eroica,\" the \"Choral\" only excepted, is the longest of  the immortal nine, and is one of the greatest examples of musical  portraiture extant. All the great composers from Handel to Wagner have  attempted what is called descriptive music with more or less success,  but never have musical genius and skill achieved a result so admirable  in its relation to its purpose and by such strictly legitimate means as  in this work.    \"The 'Eroica,'\" says a great writer, \"is an attempt to draw a musical  portrait of an historical character--a great statesman, a great  general, a noble individual; to represent in music--Beethoven's own  language--what M. Thiers has given in words and Paul Delaroche in  painting.\" Of Beethoven's success another writer has said: \"It wants  no title to tell its meaning, for throughout the symphony the hero is  visibly portrayed.\"    It is anything but difficult to realize why Beethoven should have  admired the first Napoleon. Both the soldier and musician were made  of that sturdy stuff which would and did defy the world; and it is not  strange that Beethoven should have desired in some way--and he knew  of no better course than through his art--to honor one so  characteristically akin to himself, and who at that time was the most  prominent man in Europe. Beethoven began the work in 1802, and in 1804  it was completed, and bore the following title:           Sinfonia grande         \"Napoleon Bonaparte\"            1804 in August              del Sigr         Louis van Beethoven             Sinfonia 3.              Op. 55.      This was copied and the original score dispatched to the embassador for  presentation, while Beethoven retained the copy. Before the composition  was laid before Napoleon, however, the great general had accepted the  title of Emperor. No sooner did Beethoven hear of this from his pupil  Ries than he started up in a rage, and exclaimed: \"After all, then, he's  nothing but an ordinary mortal! He will trample the rights of men under  his feet!\" saying which, he rushed to his table, seized the copy of the  score, and tore the title-page completely off. From this time Beethoven  hated Napoleon, and never again spoke of him in connection with the  symphony until he heard of his death in St. Helena, when he observed, \"I  have already composed music for this calamity,\" evidently referring to  the \"Funeral March\" in this symphony.    The opera of \"Fidelio,\" which he composed about the same time, may be  considered, in the severe sense of a great and symmetrical musical work,  the finest lyric drama ever written, with the possible exception of  Gluck's \"Orpheus and Eurydice\" and \"Iphigenia in Tauris.\" It is rarely  performed, because its broad, massive, and noble effects are beyond  the capacity of most singers, and belong to the domain of pure music,  demanding but little alliance with the artistic clap-trap of startling  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17474"],[0,"How to Listen to Music, 7th ed. (#15)"],[1,"a symphonic band when the programme is light in  character and aims at more careless diversion than should be sought at  a \"classical\" concert. The latter term, again, is commended to use by  the fact that as a rule the music performed at such a concert  exemplifies the higher forms in the art, classicism in music being  defined as that principle which seeks expression in beauty of form, in  a symmetrical ordering of parts and logical sequence, \"preferring  aesthetic beauty, pure and simple, over emotional content,\" as I have  said in Chapter III.    [Sidenote: _The Symphony._]    [Sidenote: _Mistaken ideas about the form._]    As the highest type of instrumental music, we take the Symphony. Very  rarely indeed is a concert given by an organization like the New York  and London Philharmonic Societies, or the Boston and Chicago  Orchestras, at which the place of honor in the scheme of pieces is not  given to a symphony. Such a concert is for that reason also spoken of  popularly as a \"Symphony concert,\" and no confusion would necessarily  result from the use of the term even if it so chanced that there was  no symphony on the programme. What idea the word symphony conveys to  the musically illiterate it would be difficult to tell. I have known a  professional writer on musical subjects to express the opinion that a  symphony was nothing else than four unrelated compositions for  orchestra arranged in a certain sequence for the sake of an agreeable  contrast of moods and tempos. It is scarcely necessary to say that the  writer in question had a very poor opinion of the Symphony as an  Art-form, and believed that it had outlived its usefulness and should  be relegated to the limbo of Archaic Things. If he, however, trained  in musical history and familiar with musical literature, could see  only four unrelated pieces of music in a symphony by Beethoven, we  need not marvel that hazy notions touching the nature of the form are  prevalent among the untaught public, and that people can be met in  concert-rooms to whom such words as \"Symphony in C minor,\" and the  printed designations of the different portions of the work--the  \"movements,\" as musicians call them--are utterly bewildering.    [Sidenote: _History of the term._]    [Sidenote: _Changes in meaning._]    [Sidenote: _Handel's \"Pastoral Symphony.\"_]    The word symphony has itself a singularly variegated history. Like  many another term in music it was borrowed by the modern world from  the ancient Greek. To those who coined it, however, it had a much  narrower meaning than to us who use it, with only a conventional  change in transliteration, now. By [Greek: symphonia] the Greeks  simply expressed the concept of agreement, or consonance. Applied to  music it meant first such intervals as unisons; then the notion was  extended to include consonant harmonies, such as the fifth, fourth,  and octave. The study of the ancient theoreticians led the musicians  of the Middle Ages to apply the word to harmony in general. Then in  some inexplicable fashion it came to stand as a generic term for  instrumental compositions such as toccatas, sonatas, etc. Its name was  given to one of the precursors of the pianoforte, and in Germany in  the sixteenth century the word _Symphoney_ came to mean a town band.  In the last century and the beginning of this the term was used to  designate an instrumental introduction to a composition for voices,  such as a song or chorus, as also an instrumental piece introduced in  a choral work. The form, that is the extent and structure of the  composition, had nothing to do with the designation, as we see from  the Italian shepherds' tune which Handel set for strings in \"The  Messiah;\" he called it simply _pifa_, but his publishers called it a  \"Pastoral symphony,\" and as such we still know it. It was about the  middle of the eighteenth century that the present signification  became crystallized in the word, and since the symphonies of Haydn, in  which the form first reached perfection, are still to be heard in our  concert-rooms, it may be said that all the masterpieces of symphonic  literature are current.    [Sidenote: _The allied forms._]    [Sidenote: _Sonata form._]    [Sidenote: _Symphony, sonata, and concerto._]    I have already hinted at the fact that there is an intimate  relationship between the compositions usually heard at a classical  concert. Symphonies, symphonic poems, concertos for solo instruments  and orchestra, as well as the various forms of chamber music, such as  trios, quartets, and quintets for strings, or pianoforte and strings,  are but different expressions of the idea which is best summed up in  the word sonata. What musicians call the \"sonata form\" lies at the  bottom of them all--even those which seem to consist of a single  piece, like the symphonic poem and overture. Provided it follow, not  of necessity slavishly, but in its general structure, a certain scheme  which was slowly developed by the geniuses who became the law-givers  of the art, a composite or cyclical composition (that is, one  composed of a number of parts, or movements) is, as the case may be, a  symphony, concerto, or sonata. It is a sonata if it be written for a  solo instrument like the pianoforte or organ, or for one like the  violin or clarinet, with pianoforte accompaniment. If the  accompaniment be written for orchestra, it is called a concerto. A  sonata written for an orchestra is a symphony. The nature of the  interpreting medium naturally determines the exposition of the form,  but all the essential attributes can be learned from a study of the  symphony, which because of the dignity and eloquence of its apparatus  admits of a wider scope than its allies, and must be accepted as the  highest type, not merely of the sonata, but of the instrumental art.  It will be necessary presently to point out the more important  modifications which compositions of this character have undergone in  the development of music, but the ends of clearness will be best  subserved if the study be conducted on fundamental lines.    [Sidenote: _What a symphony is._]    [Sidenote: _The bond of unity between the parts._]    The symphony then, as a rule, is a composition for orchestra made up  of four parts, or movements, which are not only related to each other  by a bond of sympathy established by the keys chosen but also by their  emotional contents. Without this higher bond the unity of the work  would be merely mechanical, like the unity accomplished by sameness of  key in the old-fashioned suite. (See Chapter VI.) The bond of  key-relationship, though no longer so obvious as once it was, is yet  readily discovered by a musician; the spiritual bond is more elusive,  and presents itself for recognition to the imagination and the  feelings of the listener. Nevertheless, it is an element in every  truly great symphony, and I have already indicated how it may  sometimes become patent to the ear alone, so it be intelligently  employed, and enjoy the co-operation of memory.    [Sidenote: _The first movement._]    [Sidenote: _Exposition of subjects._]    [Sidenote: _Repetition of the first subdivision._]    It is the first movement of a symphony which embodies the structural  scheme called the \"sonata form.\" It has a triple division, and Mr.  Edward Dannreuther has aptly defined it as \"the triune symmetry of  exposition, illustration, and repetition.\" In the first division the  composer introduces the melodies which he has chosen to be the  thematic material of the movement, and to fix the character of the  entire work; he presents it for identification. The themes are two,  and their exposition generally exemplifies the principle of  key-relationship, which was the basis of my analysis of a simple folk  tune in Chapter II. In the case of the best symphonists the principal  and second subjects disclose a contrast, not violent but yet distinct,  in mood or character. If the first is rhythmically energetic and  assertive--masculine, let me say--the second will be more sedate, more  gentle in utterance--feminine. After the two subjects have been  introduced along with some subsidiary phrases and passages which the  composer uses to bind them together and modulate from one key into  another, the entire division is repeated. That is the rule, but it is  now as often \"honored in the breach\" as in the observance, some  conductors not even hesitating to ignore the repeat marks in  Beethoven's scores.    [Sidenote: _The free fantasia or \"working-out\" portion._]    [Sidenote: _Repetition._]    The second division is now taken up. In it the composer exploits his  learning and fancy in developing his thematic material. He is now  entirely free to send it through long chains of keys, to vary the  harmonies, rhythms, and instrumentation, to take a single pregnant  motive and work it out with all the ingenuity he can muster; to force  it up \"steep-up spouts\" of passion and let it whirl in the surge, or  plunge it into \"steep-down gulfs of liquid fire,\" and consume its own  heart. Technically this part is called the \"free fantasia\" in English,  and the _Durchfuehrung_--\"working out\"--in German. I mention the terms  because they sometimes occur in criticisms and analyses. It is in this  division that the genius of a composer has fullest play, and there is  no greater pleasure, no more delightful excitement, for the  symphony-lover than to follow the luminous fancy of Beethoven through  his free fantasias. The third division is devoted to a repetition,  with modifications, of the first division and the addition of a close.    [Sidenote: _Introductions._]    [Sidenote: _Keys and Titles._]    First movements are quick and energetic, and frequently full of  dramatic fire. In them the psychological story is begun which is to  be developed in the remaining chapters of the work--its sorrows,  hopes, prayers, or communings in the slow movement; its madness or  merriment in the "]]]
