One day the oldest son went  hunting and when night fell his huntsmen came riding home without him.    \"Where is the prince?\" the King asked.    \"Isn't he here?\" the huntsmen said. \"He left us in midafternoon chasing  a hare near the Old Mill up the river. We haven't seen him since and we  supposed he must have come home alone.\"    When he hadn't returned the following day his brother, the second  prince, went out to search for him.    \"I'll go to the Old Mill,\" he said to the King, \"and see what's become  of him.\"    So he mounted his horse and rode up the river. As he neared the Old Mill  a hare crossed his path and the second prince being a hunter like his  brother at once gave chase. His attendant waited for his return but  waited in vain. Night fell and still there was no sign of the second  prince.    The attendant returned to the palace and told the King what had  happened. The King was surprised but not unduly alarmed and the  following day when the Youngest Prince asked to go hunting alone the  King suggested that he go in the direction of the Old Mill to find out  if he could what was keeping his brothers.    The Youngest Prince who had listened carefully to what his brothers'  attendants had reported decided to act cautiously. So when a hare  crossed his path as he approached the Old Mill, instead of giving it  chase, he rode off as though he were hunting other game. Later he  returned to the Old Mill from another direction.    He found an old woman sitting in front of it.    \"Good evening, granny,\" he said in a friendly tone, pulling up his horse  for a moment's chat. \"Do you live here? You know I thought the Old Mill  was deserted.\"    The old woman looked at him and shook her head gloomily.    \"Deserted indeed! My boy, take an old woman's advice and don't have  anything to do with this old mill! It's an evil place!\"    \"Why, granny,\" the Prince said, \"what's the matter with it?\"    The old woman peered cautiously around and when she saw they were alone  she beckoned the Prince to come near. Then she whispered:    \"A dragon lives here! A horrible monster! He takes the form of a hare  and lures people into the mill. Then he captures them. Some of them he  kills and eats and others he holds as prisoners in an underground  dungeon. I'm one of his prisoners and he keeps me here to work for him.\"    \"Granny,\" the Youngest Prince said, \"would you like me to rescue you?\"    \"My boy, you couldn't do it! You have no idea what a strong evil monster  the dragon is.\"    \"If you found out something for me, granny, I think I might be able to  overcome the dragon and rescue you.\"    The old woman was doubtful but she promised to do anything the Youngest  Prince asked.    \"Well then, granny, find out from the dragon where his strength is,  whether in his own body or somewhere else. Find out to-night and I'll  come back to-morrow at this same hour to see you.\"    So that night when the dragon came home, after he had supped and when  she was scratching his head to make him drowsy for bed, the old woman  said to him:    \"Master, I think you're the strongest dragon in the world! Tell me now,  where does your strength lie--in your own beautiful body or somewhere  else?\"    \"You're right, old woman,\" the dragon grunted: \"I am pretty strong as  dragons go. But I don't keep my strength in my own body. No, indeed!  That would be too dangerous. I keep it in the hearth yonder.\"    At that the old woman ran over to the hearth and, stooping down, she  kissed it and caressed it.    \"O beautiful hearth!\" she said, \"where my master's strength is hidden!  How happy are the ashes that cover your stones!\"    The dragon laughed with amusement.    \"That's the time I fooled you, old woman! My strength isn't in the  hearth at all! It's in the tree in front of the mill.\"    The old woman at once ran out of the mill and threw her arms about the  tree.    \"O tree!\" she cried, \"most beautiful tree in the world, guard carefully  our master's strength and let no harm come to it!\"    Again the dragon laughed.    \"I've fooled you another time, old woman! Come here and scratch my head  some more and this time I'll tell you the truth for I see you really  love your master.\"    So the old woman went back and scratched the dragon's head and the  dragon told her the truth about his strength.    \"I keep it far away,\" he said. \"In the third kingdom from here near the  Tsar's own city there is a deep lake. A dragon lives at the bottom of  the lake. In the dragon there is a wild boar; in the boar a hare; in the  hare a pigeon; in the pigeon a sparrow. My strength is in the sparrow.  Let any one kill the sparrow and I should die that instant. But I am  safe. No one but shepherds ever come to the lake and even they don't  come any more for the dragon has eaten up so many of them that the lake  has got a bad name. Indeed, nowadays even the Tsar himself is hard put  to it to find a shepherd. Oh, I tell you, old woman, your master is a  clever one!\"    So now the old woman had the dragon's secret and the next day she told  it to the Youngest Prince. He at once devised a plan whereby he hoped to  overcome the dragon. He dressed himself as a shepherd and with crook in  hand started off on foot for the third kingdom. He traveled through  villages and towns, across rivers and over mountains, and reached at  last the third kingdom and the Tsar's own city. He presented himself at  the palace and asked employment as a shepherd.    The guards looked at him in surprise and said:    \"A shepherd! Are you sure you want to be a shepherd?\"    Then they called to their companions: \"Here's a youth who wants to be a  shepherd!\" And the word went through the palace and even the Tsar heard  it.    \"Send the youth to me,\" he ordered.    \"Do you really want to be my shepherd?\" he asked the Youngest Prince.    The Youngest Prince said yes, he did.    \"If I put you in charge of the sheep, where would you pasture them?\"    \"Isn't there a lake beyond the city,\" the Prince asked, \"where the  grazing is good?\"    \"H'm!\" said the Tsar. \"So you know about that lake, too! What else do  you know?\"    \"I've heard the shepherds disappear.\"    \"And still you want to try your luck?\" the Tsar exclaimed.    Just then the Tsar's only daughter, a lovely Princess, who had been  looking at the young stranger, slipped over to her father and whispered:    \"But, father, you can't let such a handsome young man as that go off  with the sheep! It would be dreadful if he never returned!\"    The Tsar whispered back:    \"Hush, child! Your concern for the young man's safety does credit to  your noble feelings. But this is not the time or the place for  sentiment. We must consider first the welfare of the royal sheep.\"    He turned to the Youngest Prince:    \"Very well, young man, you may consider yourself engaged as shepherd.  Provide yourself with whatever you need and assume your duties at once.\"    \"There is one thing,\" the Youngest Prince said; \"when I start out  to-morrow morning with the sheep I should like to take with me two  strong boarhounds, a falcon, and a set of bagpipes.\"    \"You shall have them all,\" the Tsar promised.    Early the next morning when the Princess peeped out of her bedroom  window she saw the new shepherd driving the royal flocks to pasture. A  falcon was perched on his shoulder; he had a set of bagpipes under his  arm; and he was leading two powerful boarhounds on a leash.    \"It's a shame!\" the Princess said to herself. \"He'll probably never  return and he's such a handsome young man, too!\" And she was so unhappy  at thought of never again seeing the new shepherd that she couldn't go  back to sleep.    Well, the Youngest Prince reached the lake and turned out his sheep to  graze. He perched the falcon on a log, tied the dogs beside it, and laid  his bagpipes on the ground. Then he took off his smock, rolled up his  hose, and wading boldly into the lake called out in a loud voice:    \"Ho, dragon, come out and we'll try a wrestling match! That is, if  you're not afraid!\"    \"Afraid?\" bellowed an awful voice. \"Who's afraid?\"    The water of the lake churned this way and that and a horrible scaly  monster came to the surface. He crawled out on shore and clutched the  Prince around the waist. And the Prince clutched him in a grip just as  strong and there they swayed back and forth, and rolled over, and  wrestled together on the shore of the lake without either getting the  better of the other. By midafternoon when the sun was hot, the dragon  grew faint and cried out:    \"Oh, if I could but dip my burning head in the cool water, then I could  toss you as high as the sky!\"    \"Don't talk nonsense!\" the Prince said. \"If the Tsar's daughter would  kiss my forehead, then I could toss you twice as high!\"    After that the dragon slipped out of the Prince's grasp, plunged into  the water, and disappeared. The Prince waited for him but he didn't show  his scaly head again that day.    When evening came, the Prince washed off the grime of the fight, dressed  himself carefully, and then looking as fresh and handsome as ever drove  home his sheep. With the falcon on his shoulder and the two hounds at  his heels he came playing a merry tune on his bagpipes.    The townspeople hearing the bagpipes ran out of their houses and cried  to each other:    \"The shepherd's come back!\"    The Princess ran to her window and, when she saw the shepherd alive and  well, she put her hand to her heart and said:    \"Oh!\"    Even the Tsar was pleased.    \"I'm not a bit surprised that he's back!\" he said. \"There's something  about this youth that I like!\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19714"],[0,"With Frederick the Great: A Story of the Seven Years' War (#15)"],[1," severely punished, as the  king was still most anxious to gain the goodwill of the mass of the  population.        Chapter 5: Lobositz.      In Dresden itself, the feeling was far from hostile to the  invaders. The discontent with the vicious government had been  extreme, and the imposts now levied were less onerous than those  which had been wasted in profusion and extravagance. The conduct of  the troops had been admirable; and in the case of Count Eulenfurst,  the personal visit of the king to express his regrets, and his  generosity to the families of the servants, had produced a most  excellent effect.    As Fergus rode into the camp, mounted on his new acquisition, it at  once caught the marshal's eye.    \"Why, Fergus,\" he exclaimed, \"have you been robbing the King of  Poland's stables? That is a noble animal, indeed.\"    \"It was a present from Count Eulenfurst, marshal,\" Fergus replied.  \"He sent me two, but one of them he is going to keep for me until I  return; for I could not part with Rollo, who is as good a horse as  anyone can wish to ride; and I know his paces.\"    \"You are right, lad, for it is always well to accustom yourself to  a horse, before you want to use it in action; but in faith, it will  be a pity to ride such a horse as that through the heat of a  battle.\"    \"I feel that, sir; but as the count, in his letter with the horses,  said that he hoped they would carry me safely through dangers as  grave as those I had encountered at his house, I feel that he would  be hurt if, on my return, I admitted to him that I had saved it for  show occasions.\"    \"You are right,\" Keith said approvingly; \"but that is the more  reason that you should accustom yourself to it, before you use it  for such work; as horse and rider should be as one on the field of  battle and, unless the horse has absolute confidence in its rider,  it is very difficult to keep it steady under fire.\"    \"I suppose we shall not see the king for some time, marshal,\"  Fergus said later, as Keith was chatting with him.    \"On the contrary, he will be with us tomorrow. He rides today to  have another look at the Saxon position, and to give his orders  there. He will, tomorrow morning, join us. It is we who are likely  to have the first fighting; for the Austrians must come to the  relief of the Saxons, who are shut up, as in a trap, by our  divisions. They made a great mistake in not retiring, at once, into  Bohemia; which they could have done without difficulty, had they  lost no time.    \"There is no greater mistake than shutting a large force up, either  in a fortress or an intrenched camp, unless that fortress is an  absolute obstacle to an enemy. This is not the case with Pirna. The  mountains can be crossed at many other points and, by leaving five  or six thousand men in a strong position at the end of each defile,  we could disregard them altogether, and march on southward. They  have already been three weeks there, and we believe that they  cannot hold out very much longer. However, it is probable that they  may be able to do so until an Austrian force comes up, and tries to  relieve them.    \"From what we hear, two armies have already entered Bohemia, and we  may expect that our first battle will not be far distant.\"    \"Do we block the only line of retreat, sir?\" Fergus asked.    \"No, indeed. We do not absolutely close the direct road, but our  position, and that of Marshal Schwerin facing Koeniggraetz, so  menaces their line of retreat that they dare not venture from their  shelter; and our cavalry render it impossible for any supplies to  be thrown in, unless the convoy is supported by an army. There are,  we know, paths across the hills by which infantry might effect a  passage; but as there is nowhere a place for them to retire to, we  should easily overtake them and force them to surrender.    \"No, their only hope is in the coming of relief.\"    A few hours later, the king himself rode in. In the evening, orders  were issued that a force of cavalry and infantry were to march at  daylight, and that the rest of the army were to follow, two hours  later. It was soon known that the king had received news that  Marshal Browne--an Irish officer of great distinction, who  commanded the Austrian force gathered at Budin, on the Eger--was  expecting the arrival of artillery and pontoons from Vienna, in the  course of a day or two, and was preparing to cross the river. It  was evident, then, that his intention was to relieve the Saxon  army, in the first place.    The roads through the defiles were very heavy and difficult, but  that afternoon the advance force reached Termitz. Late in the  evening the rest of the army arrived there.    A squadron of cavalry had been sent off, as soon as the vanguard  arrived, to ascertain the movements of the enemy; and they  returned, at ten at night, with information that the Austrians had  crossed the Eger that day, and were to encamp at Lobositz. The army  at once moved on across the mountains and, after a very difficult  and fatiguing march, arrived near Lobositz; and lay down for some  hours in the order in which they had marched, taking up their  position as soon as it was light.      [Map: Battle of Lobositz]      The infantry were in two lines. Their left was posted on a steep  hill known as the Lobosch, part of whose lower slopes extended to  the village of Lobositz. A battery, with infantry supports, took  post on a hill called Homolka, which commanded the whole plain  between the two armies. The centre stretched across the valley  between those hills.    On the low hill on which stood the little town, the Austrians had  thrown up intrenchments, and posted a very strong artillery force,  whose fire would sweep a greater portion of the Prussian position.  Except at this point, the ground between the two armies was low and  swampy. The Austrian force was greatly superior in numbers,  consisting of 72 squadrons of horse, 52 battalions of infantry, and  98 guns; while the Prussians had 55 squadrons, 26 battalions, and  102 guns.    It was evident to both commanders that the village of Lobositz was  the decisive point; and indeed, the nature of the ground was such  as to render operations almost impossible, in the marshy plain  intersected by rivulets, which in many places formed large ponds.    At seven in the morning the Prussian action began by a heavy fire  between the left, on the slopes of Lobosch, and 4000 Croats and  several battalions of Hungarians, scattered among the vineyards and  the stone walls dividing them. A heavy fog covered the whole  country and, until a full view could be obtained of the position of  the enemy, neither of the commanders deemed it prudent to move.    At twelve o'clock, however, the fog began to clear up. The main  body of the Austrians was still invisible; and the king, seeing but  a comparatively small force in the plain near Lobositz, thought  that this must be the rear guard of the Austrians; who, he  imagined, having found the line by which they intended to succour  the Saxons occupied in force, had retired, having thrown up  batteries and left a strong force at Lobositz, to prevent the  Prussians from advancing.    To ascertain this, twenty squadrons of cavalry were ordered to  advance; but on doing so, they were received by so tremendous a  fire from the batteries of the village, and from others at  Sulowitz, another village in the plain on their right, that they  fell back with much loss, pursued by the Austrian cavalry. By the  time they had resumed their positions behind the infantry, the fog  had entirely lifted; and the king and Marshal Keith obtained a full  view of the Austrian position, from the spot where they had  stationed themselves on the hill. They agreed that no attack could  be made against the enemy's centre or left, and that they could be  assailed only on their right.    The troops on the Lobosch Hill were, therefore, largely reinforced;  and the whole army advanced, inclining towards the left so as to  attack Lobositz from the side of the plain, as well as from that of  the mountain. A tremendous artillery fire, from the guns on the  hills, heralded the advance.    The troops on the Lobosch Hill made their way forward rapidly. The  ground was so steep that they commanded a view down into the  vineyard, and their fire was so heavy that the Croats and  Hungarians fell, as fast as they raised their heads above the stone  walls to fire; and although General Browne reinforced them by some  of the best Austrian infantry, they were rapidly driven down  towards Lobositz. At the foot of the hill they were supported by  several more battalions, brought from the Austrian centre. General  Lacy, who commanded these, was wounded.    The Prussians halted at the foot of the slope and were reformed;  having fallen into some disorder, from the irregular nature of the  ground over which they had been fighting. The guns were brought  forward, so as to cover their next advance; while a very strong  force was sent to support the batteries on the Homolka Hill, so as  to check the enemy's centre and left, should they attempt any  movement across the plain.    In the meantime, Marshal Browne was reinforcing the defenders of  Lobositz with the whole of his right wing. The village was defended  with desperate bravery but, owing to the position, the king was  able to reinforce the assailants very much more rapidly than the  Austrian commander could bring up his distant troops. The Prussian  artillery concentrated their fire upon the place, and set it in  flames from end to end; when its defenders were forced to abandon  it, and retreat with precipitation on their cavalry.    In order to cover their withdrawal, the Austrian left moved down to  the village of Sulowitz, and endeavoured to pass the dam over a  marshy rivulet in front of it; but the fire from the battery on the  Homolka rendered it impossible for them to form, and also set that"]]]
