Toward the head of  this sandy flat Slone came upon old corn-fields, and a broken dam where  the water had been stored, and well-defined trails leading away to the  right. Somewhere over there in the desert lived Indians. At this point  Wildfire abandoned the trail he had followed for many days and cut out  more to the north. It took all the morning hours to climb three great  steps and benches that led up to the summit of a mesa, vast in extent.  It turned out to be a sandy waste. The wind rose and everywhere were  moving sheets of sand, and in the distance circular yellow dust-devils,  rising high like waterspouts, and back down in the sun-scorched valley  a sandstorm moved along majestically, burying the desert in its yellow  pall.    Then two more days of sand and another day of a slowly rising ground  growing from bare to gray and gray to green, and then to the purple of  sage and cedar--these three grinding days were toiled out with only one  water-hole.    And Wildfire was lame and in distress and Nagger was growing gaunt and  showing strain; and Slone, haggard and black and worn, plodded miles  and miles on foot to save his horse.    Slone felt that it would be futile to put the chase to a test of speed.  Nagger could never head that stallion. Slone meant to go on and on,  always pushing Wildfire, keeping him tired, wearied, and worrying him,  till a section of the country was reached where he could drive Wildfire  into some kind of a natural trap. The pursuit seemed endless. Wildfire  kept to open country where he could not be surprised.    There came a morning when Slone climbed to a cedared plateau that rose  for a whole day's travel, and then split into a labyrinthine maze of  canyons. There were trees, grass, water. It was a high country, cool  and wild, like the uplands he had left. For days he camped on  Wildfire's trail, always relentlessly driving him, always watching for  the trap he hoped to find. And the red stallion spent much of this time  of flight in looking backward. Whenever Slone came in sight of him he  had his head over his shoulder, watching. And on the soft ground of  these canyons he had begun to recover from his lameness. But this did  not worry Slone. Sooner or later Wildfire would go down into a  high-walled wash, from which there would be no outlet; or he would  wander into a box-canyon; or he would climb out on a mesa with no place  to descend, unless he passed Slone; or he would get cornered on a soft,  steep slope where his hoofs would sink deep and make him slow. The  nature of the desert had changed. Slone had entered a wonderful region,  the like of which he had not seen--a high plateau crisscrossed in every  direction by narrow canyons with red walls a thousand feet high.    And one of the strange turning canyons opened into a vast valley of  monuments.    The plateau had weathered and washed away, leaving huge sections of  stone walls, all standing isolated, different in size and shape, but  all clean-cut, bold, with straight lines. They stood up everywhere,  monumental, towering, many-colored, lending a singular and beautiful  aspect to the great green-and-gray valley, billowing away to the north,  where dim, broken battlements mounted to the clouds.    The only living thing in Slone's sight was Wildfire. He shone red down  on the green slope.    Slone's heart swelled. This was the setting for that grand horse--a  perfect wild range. But also it seemed the last place where there might  be any chance to trap the stallion. Still that did not alter Slone's  purpose, though it lost to him the joy of former hopes. He rode down  the slope, out upon the billowing floor of the valley. Wildfire looked  back to see his pursuers, and then the solemn stillness broke to a  wild, piercing whistle.    Day after day, camping where night found him, Slone followed the  stallion, never losing sight of him till darkness had fallen. The  valley was immense and the monuments miles apart. But they always  seemed close together and near him. The air magnified everything. Slone  lost track of time. The strange, solemn, lonely days and the silent,  lonely nights, and the endless pursuit, and the wild, weird  valley--these completed the work of years on Slone and he became  satisfied, unthinking, almost savage.    The toil and privation had worn him down and he was like iron. His  garments hung in tatters; his boots were ripped and soleless. Long  since his flour had been used up, and all his supplies except the salt.  He lived on the meat of rabbits, but they were scarce, and the time  came when there were none. Some days he did not eat. Hunger did not  make him suffer. He killed a desert bird now and then, and once a  wildcat crossing the valley. Eventually he felt his strength  diminishing, and then he took to digging out the pack-rats and cooking  them. But these, too, were scarce. At length starvation faced Slone.  But he knew he would not starve. Many times he had been within  rifle-shot of Wildfire. And the grim, forbidding thought grew upon him  that he must kill the stallion. The thought seemed involuntary, but his  mind rejected it. Nevertheless, he knew that if he could not catch the  stallion he would kill him. That had been the end of many a desperate  rider's pursuit of a coveted horse.    While Slone kept on his merciless pursuit, never letting Wildfire rest  by day, time went on just as relentlessly. Spring gave way to early  summer. The hot sun bleached the grass; water-holes failed out in the  valley, and water could be found only in the canyons; and the dry winds  began to blow the sand. It was a sandy valley, green and gray only at a  distance, and out toward the north there were no monuments, and the  slow heave of sand lifted toward the dim walls.    Wildfire worked away from this open valley, back to the south end,  where the great monuments loomed, and still farther back, where they  grew closer, till at length some of them were joined by weathered  ridges to the walls of the surrounding plateau. For all that Slone  could see, Wildfire was in perfect condition. But Nagger was not the  horse he had been. Slone realized that in one way or another the  pursuit was narrowing down to the end.    He found a water-hole at the head of a wash in a split in the walls,  and here he let Nagger rest and graze one whole day--the first day for  a long time that he had not kept the red stallion in sight. That day  was marked by the good fortune of killing a rabbit, and while eating it  his gloomy, fixed mind admitted that he was starving. He dreaded the  next sunrise. But he could not hold it back. There, behind the dark  monuments, standing sentinel-like, the sky lightened and reddened and  burst into gold and pink, till out of the golden glare the sun rose  glorious. And Slone, facing the league-long shadows of the monuments,  rode out again into the silent, solemn day, on his hopeless quest.    For a change Wildfire had climbed high up a slope of talus, through a  narrow pass, rounded over with drifting sand. And Slone gazed down into  a huge amphitheater full of monuments, like all that strange country. A  basin three miles across lay beneath him. Walls and weathered slants of  rock and steep slopes of reddish-yellow sand inclosed this oval  depression. The floor was white, and it seemed to move gently or  radiate with heat-waves. Studying it, Slone made out that the motion  was caused by wind in long bleached grass. He had crossed small areas  of this grass in different parts of the region.    Wildfire's tracks led down into this basin, and presently Slone, by  straining his eyes, made out the red spot that was the stallion.    \"He's lookin' to quit the country,\" soliloquized Slone, as he surveyed  the scene.    With keen, slow gaze Slone studied the lay of wall and slope, and when  he had circled the huge depression he made sure that Wildfire could not  get out except by the narrow pass through which he had gone in. Slone  sat astride Nagger in the mouth of this pass--a wash a few yards wide,  walled by broken, rough rock on one side and an insurmountable slope on  the other.    \"If this hole was only little, now,\" sighed Slone, as he gazed at the  sweeping, shimmering oval floor, \"I might have a chance. But down  there--we couldn't get near him.\"    There was no water in that dry bowl. Slone reflected on the uselessness  of keeping Wildfire down there, because Nagger could not go without  water as long as Wildfire. For the first time Slone hesitated. It  seemed merciless to Nagger to drive him down into this hot, windy hole.  The wind blew from the west, and it swooped up the slope, hot, with the  odor of dry, dead grass.    But that hot wind stirred Slone with an idea, and suddenly he was  tense, excited, glowing, yet grim and hard.    \"Wildfire, I'll make you run with your namesake in that high grass,\"  called Slone. The speech was full of bitter failure, of regret, of the  hardness of a rider who could not give up the horse to freedom.    Slone meant to ride down there and fire the long grass. In that wind  there would indeed be wildfire to race with the red stallion. It would  perhaps mean his death; at least it would chase him out of that hole,  where to follow him would be useless.    \"I'd make you hump now to get away if I could get behind you,\" muttered  Slone. He saw that if he could fire the grass on the other side the  wind of flame would drive Wildfire straight toward him. The slopes and  walls narrowed up to the pass, but high grass grew to within a few rods  of where Slone stood. But it seemed impossible to get behind Wildfire.    \"At night--then--I could get round him,\" said Slone, thinking hard and  narrowing his gaze to scan the circle of wall and slope. \"Why not? ...  No wind at night.

It is recorded of him,  with great approbation, that he fasted every other day, and had four wives  and many slaves. This book is considered of great value. He met with his  death in rather a sad way. He had compiled a book on the virtues of 'Ali,  and as the people of {69} Damascus were at that time inclined to the heresy  of the Kharigites, he wished to read his book in the mosque of that place.  After he had read a little way, a man arose and asked him whether he knew  aught of the praises of Muavia, 'Ali's deadly enemy. He replied that he did  not. This answer enraged the people, who beat him so severely that he died  soon after.    (6). _Sunan-i-Ibn Majah._ Ibn Majah[62] was born at 'Irak A.H. 209. This  work contains 4,000 Traditions.    The Shia'hs reject these books and substitute five books[63] of their own  instead. They are of a much later date, the last one, indeed, having been  compiled more than four hundred years after the Hijra.    The belief which underlies the question of the authority of the Traditions  is that before the Throne of God there stands a 'preserved Table,' on which  all that can happen, and all that has ever entered, or will enter, the mind  of man is 'noted in a distinct writing.' Through the medium of Gabriel, the  Prophet had access to this. It follows then that the words of the Prophet  are the words of God.    Of the four great \"Canonical Legists\" of Islam, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal was the  greatest collector of Traditions. It is said that he knew by heart no less  than one million. Of these he incorporated thirty thousand into his system  of jurisprudence. That system is now almost obsolete. Abu Hanifa, who is  said to have accepted only eighteen Traditions as authentic, founded a  system which is to this day the most powerful in Islam. The Hanifites,  however, as well as other Muslims, acknowledge the six standard collections  of Traditions as direct revelations of the will of {70} God. They range  over a vast number of subjects, and furnish a commentary on the Quran. The  Prophet's personal appearance, his mental and moral qualities, his actions,  his opinions, are all recorded over and over again. Many questions of  religious belief are largely founded on the Traditions, and it is to them  we must go for an explanation of much of the ritual of Islam. It is very  difficult for any one, who has not lived in long and friendly intercourse  with Muslims, to realize how much their religious life and opinions, their  thought and actions, are based on the Traditions.    Having thus shown the importance of the Traditions, I now proceed to enter  a little into detail on the question of the rules framed concerning them.  The classification adopted by different authors may vary in some  subordinate points; but the following account is adopted from a standard  Muhammadan work. A Tradition may be Hadis-i-Quali, that is, an account of  something the Prophet said; or Hadis-i-Fa'li, a record of something which  he did; or Hadis-i-Taqriri, a statement of some act performed by other  persons in his presence, and which action he did not forbid.    The Traditions may be classed under two general heads:--    First.--_Hadis-i-Mutawatir_, that is, \"an undoubted Tradition,\" the Isnad,  or chain of narrators of which is perfect, and in which chain each narrator  possessed all the necessary qualifications for his office.[64] Some  authorities say there are only a few of these Traditions extant, but most  allow that the following is one: \"There are no good works except with  intention,\" for example, a man may fast, but, unless he has the intention  of fasting firmly in his mind, he gains no spiritual reward by so doing.    Second.--_Hadis-i-Ahad._ The authority of this class is {71} theoretically  somewhat less than that of the first, but practically it is the same.    This class is again sub-divided into two:--    (1). _Hadis-i-Sahih_, or a genuine Tradition. It is not necessary to go  into the sub-divisions of this sub-division. A Tradition is Sahih if the  narrators have been men of pious lives, abstemious in their habits, endowed  with a good memory, free from blemish, and persons who lived at peace with  their neighbours. The following also are Sahih, though their importance as  authorities varies. I arrange them in the order of their value. Sahih  Traditions are those which are found in the collections made by Bukhari and  Muslim, or in the collection of either of the above, though not in both;  or, if not mentioned by either of these famous collectors, if it has been  retained in accordance with their canons for the rejection or retention of  Traditions; or lastly, if retained in accordance with the rules of any  other approved collector. For each of these classes there is a distinct  name.    (2). _Hadis-i-Hasan._ The narrators of this class are not of such good  authority as those of the former with regard to one or two qualities; but  these Traditions should be received as of equal authority as regards any  practical use.[65] It is merely as a matter of classification that they  rank second.    In addition to these names, there are a number of other technical terms  which have regard to the personal character of the narrators, the Isnad,  and other points. A few may be mentioned.    (1). _Hadis-i-Z'aif_, or a weak Tradition. The narrators of it have been  persons whose characters were not above reproach, whose memories were bad,  or who, worse still, were addicted to \"bid'at,\" innovation, a habit now, as  then, a crime in the eyes of all true Muslims. All agree that a {72} \"weak  Tradition\" has little force; but few rival theologians agree as to which  are, and which are not, \"weak Traditions.\"    (2). _Hadis-i-Mua'llaq_, or a Tradition in the Isnad of which there is some  break. If it begins with a Tabi' (one in the generation after that of the  Companions), it is called \"_Mursal_\" the one link in the chain, the  Companion, being wanting. If the first link in the chain of narrators  begins in a generation still later, it has another name, and so on.    (3). Traditions which have various names, according as the narrator  concealed the name of his Imam, or where different narrators disagree, or  where the narrator has mixed some of his own words with the Tradition, or  has been proved to be a liar, an evil liver, or mistaken; but into an  account of these it is not necessary to enter, for no Tradition of this  class would be considered as of itself sufficient ground on which to base  any important doctrine.[66]    It is the universally accepted rule, that no authentic Tradition can be  contrary to the Quran. The importance attached to Tradition has been shown  in the preceding chapter, an importance which has demanded the formation of  an elaborate system of exegesis. To an orthodox Muslim the Book and the  Sunnat, God's word direct and God's word through the mind of the Prophet,  are the foundation and sum of Islam, a fact not always taken into account  by modern panegyrists of the system.    {73}           *       *       *       *       *      CHAPTER III.    THE SECTS OF ISLAM.    It is a commonly received but nevertheless an erroneous opinion, that the  Muhammadan religion is one remarkable for the absence of dogma and the  unanimity of its professors. In this chapter I propose to show how the  great sects differ in some very important principles of the faith, and  their consequent divergence in practice. There is much that is common  ground to all, and of that some account was given in the first chapter on  the \"Foundations of Islam.\"    It was there shown that all Muslim sects are not agreed as to the essential  foundations of the Faith. The Sunnis recognise four foundations, the  Wahhabis two; whilst the Shia'hs reject altogether the Traditions held  sacred by both Sunni and Wahhabi. The next chapter will contain a full  account of the doctrines held by the Sunnis, and so no account of this, the  orthodox sect, is given in this chapter.    The first breach in Islam arose out of a civil war. The story has been so  often told that it need not be reproduced here at any length. 'Ali, the  son-in-law of Muhammad, was the fourth Khalif of Islam. He is described as  \"the last and worthiest of the primitive Musalmans who imbibed his  religious enthusiasm from companionship with the Prophet himself, and who  followed to the last the simplicity of his character.\" He was a man  calculated by his earnest devotion to the Prophet and his own natural  graces to win, as he has done, the admiration of succeeding generations. A  strong opposition, however, arose, and 'Ali was assassinated in a mosque at  Kufa. It is not easy, amid the conflicting statements of historians of the  rival sects, to arrive at the truth in all the details of the events which  happened then; {74} but the generally received opinion is, that after the  assassination of 'Ali, Hasan, his son, renounced his claim to the Khalifate  in favour of his father's rival, Muavia. Hasan was ultimately poisoned by  his wife, who, it is said, was instigated by Muavia to do the deed, in  order to leave the coast clear for his son Yezid. The most tragic event has  yet to come. Yezid, who succeeded his father, was a very licentious and  irreligious man. The people of Kufa, being disgusted at his conduct, sent  messengers to Husain, the remaining son of 'Ali, with the request that he  would assume the Khalifate. In vain the friends of Husain tried to persuade  him to let the people of Kufa first revolt, and thus show the reality of  their wishes by their deeds. In an evil hour Husain started with a small  band of forty horsemen and one hundred foot-soldiers. On the plain of  Karbala he found his way barred by a force of three thousand men. \"We are  few in number,\" said Husain, \"and the enemy is in force. I am resolved to  die. But you--I release you from your oath of allegiance; let all those who  wish to do so"]]]
