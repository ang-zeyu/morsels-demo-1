[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2057"],[0,"The Last of the Plainsmen (#15)"],[1," So all you need do is go  below the break, where I climb out, an' wait. You're sure goin' to get  a look at the White Mustang. But wait. Don't expect him before noon,  an' after thet, any time till he comes. Mebbe it'll be a couple of  days, so keep a good watch.\"    Then taking our man Lawson, with blankets and a knapsack of food,  Stewart rode off down the canyon.    We were early on the march. As we proceeded the canyon lost its  regularity and smoothness; it became crooked as a rail fence, narrower,  higher, rugged and broken. Pinnacled cliffs, cracked and leaning,  menaced us from above. Mountains of ruined wall had tumbled into  fragments.    It seemed that Jones, after much survey of different corners, angles  and points in the canyon floor, chose his position with much greater  care than appeared necessary for the ultimate success of our  venture--which was simply to see the White Mustang, and if good fortune  attended us, to snap some photographs of this wild king of horses. It  flashed over me that, with his ruling passion strong within him, our  leader was laying some kind of trap for that mustang, was indeed bent  on his capture.    Wallace, Frank and Jim were stationed at a point below the break where  Stewart had evidently gone up and out. How a horse could have climbed  that streaky white slide was a mystery. Jones's instructions to the men  were to wait until the mustangs were close upon them, and then yell and  shout and show themselves.    He took me to a jutting corner of cliff, which hid us from the others,  and here he exercised still more care in scrutinizing the lay of the  ground. A wash from ten to fifteen feet wide, and as deep, ran through  the canyon in a somewhat meandering course. At the corner which  consumed so much of his attention, the dry ditch ran along the cliff  wall about fifty feet out; between it and the wall was good level  ground, on the other side huge rocks and shale made it hummocky,  practically impassable for a horse. It was plain the mustangs, on their  way up, would choose the inside of the wash; and here in the middle of  the passage, just round the jutting corner, Jones tied our horses to  good, strong bushes. His next act was significant. He threw out his  lasso and, dragging every crook out of it, carefully recoiled it, and  hung it loose over the pommel of his saddle.    \"The White Mustang may be yours before dark,\" he said with the smile  that came so seldom. \"Now I placed our horses there for two reasons.  The mustangs won't see them till they're right on them. Then you'll see  a sight and have a chance for a great picture. They will halt; the  stallion will prance, whistle and snort for a fight, and then they'll  see the saddles and be off. We'll hide across the wash, down a little  way, and at the right time we'll shout and yell to drive them up.\"    By piling sagebrush round a stone, we made a hiding-place. Jones was  extremely cautious to arrange the bunches in natural positions. \"A  Rocky Mountain Big Horn is the only four-footed beast,\" he said, \"that  has a better eye than a wild horse. A cougar has an eye, too; he's used  to lying high up on the cliffs and looking down for his quarry so as to  stalk it at night; but even a cougar has to take second to a mustang  when it comes to sight.\"    The hours passed slowly. The sun baked us; the stones were too hot to  touch; flies buzzed behind our ears; tarantulas peeped at us from  holes. The afternoon slowly waned.    At dark we returned to where we had left Wallace and the cowboys. Frank  had solved the problem of water supply, for he had found a little  spring trickling from a cliff, which, by skillful management, produced  enough drink for the horses. We had packed our water for camp use.    \"You take the first watch to-night,\" said Jones to me after supper.  \"The mustangs might try to slip by our fire in the night and we must  keep a watch or them. Call Wallace when your time's up. Now, fellows,  roll in.\"    When the pink of dawn was shading white, we were at our posts. A long,  hot day--interminably long, deadening to the keenest interest--passed,  and still no mustangs came. We slept and watched again, in the grateful  cool of night, till the third day broke.    The hours passed; the cool breeze changed to hot; the sun blazed over  the canyon wall; the stones scorched; the flies buzzed. I fell asleep  in the scant shade of the sage bushes and awoke, stifled and moist. The  old plainsman, never weary, leaned with his back against a stone and  watched, with narrow gaze, the canyon below. The steely walls hurt my  eyes; the sky was like hot copper. Though nearly wild with heat and  aching bones and muscles and the long hours of wait--wait--wait, I was  ashamed to complain, for there sat the old man, still and silent. I  routed out a hairy tarantula from under a stone and teased him into a  frenzy with my stick, and tried to get up a fight between him and a  scallop-backed horned-toad that blinked wonderingly at me. Then I  espied a green lizard on a stone. The beautiful reptile was about a  foot in length, bright green, dotted with red, and he had diamonds for  eyes. Nearby a purple flower blossomed, delicate and pale, with a bee  sucking at its golden heart. I observed then that the lizard had his  jewel eyes upon the bee; he slipped to the edge of the stone, flicked  out a long, red tongue, and tore the insect from its honeyed perch.  Here were beauty, life and death; and I had been weary for something to  look at, to think about, to distract me from the wearisome wait!    \"Listen!\" broke in Jones's sharp voice. His neck was stretched, his  eyes were closed, his ear was turned to the wind.    With thrilling, reawakened eagerness, I strained my hearing. I caught a  faint sound, then lost it.    \"Put your ear to the ground,\" said Jones. I followed his advice, and  detected the rhythmic beat of galloping horses.    \"The mustangs are coming, sure as you're born!\" exclaimed Jones.    \"There I see the cloud of dust!\" cried he a minute later.    In the first bend of the canyon below, a splintered ruin of rock now  lay under a rolling cloud of dust. A white flash appeared, a line of  bobbing black objects, and more dust; then with a sharp pounding of  hoofs, into clear vision shot a dense black band of mustangs, and well  in front swung the White King.    \"Look! Look! I never saw the beat of that--never in my born days!\"  cried Jones. \"How they move! yet that white fellow isn't half-stretched  out. Get your picture before they pass. You'll never see the beat of  that.\"    With long manes and tails flying, the mustangs came on apace and passed  us in a trampling roar, the white stallion in the front. Suddenly a  shrill, whistling blast, unlike any sound I had ever heard, made the  canyon fairly ring. The white stallion plunged back, and his band  closed in behind him. He had seen our saddle horses. Then trembling,  whinnying, and with arched neck and high-poised head, bespeaking his  mettle, he advanced a few paces, and again whistled his shrill note of  defiance. Pure creamy white he was, and built like a racer. He pranced,  struck his hoofs hard and cavorted; then, taking sudden fright, he  wheeled.    It was then, when the mustangs were pivoting, with the white in the  lead, that Jones jumped upon the stone, fired his pistol and roared  with all his strength. Taking his cue, I did likewise. The band huddled  back again, uncertain and frightened, then broke up the canyon.    Jones jumped the ditch with surprising agility, and I followed close at  his heels. When we reached our plunging horses, he shouted: \"Mount, and  hold this passage. Keep close in by that big stone at the turn so they  can't run you down, or stampede you. If they head your way, scare them  back.\"    Satan quivered, and when I mounted, reared and plunged. I had to hold  him in hard, for he was eager to run. At the cliff wall I was at some  pains to check him. He kept champing his bit and stamping his feet.    From my post I could see the mustangs flying before a cloud of dust.  Jones was turning in his horse behind a large rock in the middle of the  canyon, where he evidently intended to hide. Presently successive yells  and shots from our comrades blended in a roar which the narrow  box-canyon augmented and echoed from wall to wall. High the White  Mustang reared, and above the roar whistled his snort of furious  terror. His band wheeled with him and charged back, their hoofs ringing  like hammers on iron.    The crafty old buffalo-hunter had hemmed the mustangs in a circle and  had left himself free in the center. It was a wily trick, born of his  quick mind and experienced eye.    The stallion, closely crowded by his followers, moved swiftly I saw  that he must pass near the stone. Thundering, crashing, the horses came  on. Away beyond them I saw Frank and Wallace. Then Jones yelled to me:  \"Open up! open up!\"    I turned Satan into the middle of the narrow passage, screaming at the  top of my voice and discharging my revolver rapidly.    But the wild horses thundered on. Jones saw that they would not now be  balked, and he spurred his bay directly in their path. The big horse,  courageous as his intrepid master, dove forward.    Then followed confusion for me. The pound of hoofs, the snorts, a  screaming neigh that was frightful, the mad stampede of the mustangs  with a whirling cloud of dust, bewildered and frightened me so that I  lost sight of Jones. Danger threatened and passed me almost before I  was aware of it. Out of the dust a mass of tossing manes, foam-flecked  black horses, wild eyes and lifting hoofs rushed at me. Satan, with a  presence of mind that shamed mine, leaped back and hugged the wall. My  eyes were blinded by dust; the smell of dust choked me. I felt a strong  rush of wind and a mustang grazed my stirrup. Then they had passed, on  the wings of the dust-laden breeze.    But not all, for I saw that Jones"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20571"],[0,"Woman's Work in Music (#15)"],[1,"list was the Countess Babette de Keglevics,  afterward Princess Odeschalchi, to whom Beethoven showed his feelings in  the shape of the Sonata, Opus 7. The Baroness Ertmann he addressed as  \"Liebe, werthe, Dorothea Cecilia,\" while the Countess Erdoedy received  the still warmer greeting of \"Liebe, liebe, liebe, liebe Graefin.\" All of  these women, and many others, were ready to stand almost any liberty  from Beethoven, and they entertained the warmest affection for him. At a  later date, the Countess Erdoedy erected a temple in her park to the  memory of Beethoven. That his affections were changeable, if intense,  was admitted by the composer himself. On being teased about his conquest  of a beautiful woman, he admitted that she had interested him longer  than any of the others,--namely, seven whole months.    More serious was his feeling for the lovely young Countess Giulietta  Giucciardi, one of his pupils. \"Life has been made a little brighter to  me lately,\" he writes, adding later, \"This change has been brought about  by a dear, fascinating girl, whom I love, and who loves me. After two  years, I bask again in the sunlight of happiness, and now, for the first  time, I feel what a truly happy state marriage might be.\" But,  unfortunately, she was not of his rank in life, and later on we find  her, too, marrying another. Beethoven would certainly have married her  if he could have done so, and his epistles to her are full of many  fervid expressions of love. At his death, some letters of the most  passionate description were found in his desk, and for a time it was  thought they were addressed to her, but they are now ascribed to the  influence of her successor.    The Countess Therese von Brunswick, who next received Beethoven's  devotion, had been one of his pupils, and had once been rapped over the  knuckles by him for inefficiency. Twelve years later, in 1806, pupil and  teacher were actually engaged,--secretly, to be sure, but with full  knowledge and consent of her brother. Yet after four years of varying  conditions the match was broken off, and the composer again forced to  take refuge in the lonely comfort of his art.    But he found other consolation in the charms and the companionship of  Bettina von Brentano, whom he met at this time. According to his  letters, she was no whit behind any of the others in being his \"dearest  friend,\" \"dearest girl,\" and \"dearest, fairest sweetheart.\" Soon  Beethoven was to see her, too, married to another, and, if he never  succeeded in taking the fatal plunge himself, he could at least have  the melancholy satisfaction of knowing that all the objects of his  adoration had entered safely into the holy state of matrimony.    In 1811 he met Amalia Seebald, and soon afterward inscribed in her album  the sentiment:      \"Ludwig von Beethoven,     Whom if you ever would,     Forget you never should.\"    His feeling for her was not exactly the effervescent feeling of youth,  but the quieter, deeper sentiment of personal esteem and affection,  which comes later in life, and is therefore more lasting. Her influence  is visible in much of his later music, and the seventh and eighth  symphonies were inspired by her.    That Beethoven took a friendly interest in other love-affairs besides  his own is shown by an incident taking place in Toeplitz, where the  actor, Ludwig Loewe, was in love with the landlord's daughter of the  \"Blue Star,\" at which Beethoven used to dine. Conversation was usually  impossible because of stern parents and a multitude of diners. \"Come at  a later hour,\" said the girl; \"only Beethoven is here, and he cannot  hear.\" This answered for a time, but at length the parents forbade the  actor the house. Despite Beethoven's serious reserve, Loewe had often  noticed a kindly smile on his face, and now resolved to trust him.  Finding the composer in the park, he begged him to take charge of a  letter for the girl. Satisfied with the honesty of the young man's  intentions, Beethoven did this, and next day brought back the answer,  keeping up his role of messenger during the whole of the five weeks that  he remained in the town.    Franz Peter Schubert was a true son of Vienna. Sprung from the lower  classes, he never felt wholly at ease among the aristocracy, and made no  such deep impression upon them as Beethoven did. He was most at home in  the informal society of his few chosen friends, all men of talent in  some direction, whom he drew about him by his own genius and  good-fellowship. His very nickname, \"Kanner-was,\" taken from his usual  question about newcomers, bears witness to the fact that he would have  nothing to do with any one who did not show intellectual ability in some  direction,--poetry or art, if not music.    Schubert's brief schooling, where his natural gifts were left to  flourish by themselves, was succeeded by three years of musical drudgery  in the shape of school-teaching. But his genius was restless, and he  threw up that post. How he existed during the next few years is a  complete mystery. He lived for a while rent-free, and his wants were  never many, but for some time he apparently got along with no income  whatever. His fertility in composing songs showed itself already. His  later feat of writing \"Hark, Hark, the Lark\" on the back of a bill of  fare, finishing it within half an hour of his first seeing the poem, is  well known. It seems that he could forget as easily as he invented. At  one time he sent a set of songs to his friend Vogl for inspection, but  the latter was unable to look them over for two weeks. On finding one of  especial interest, Vogl had it transposed to suit his voice, and gave it  to Schubert to play. The composer, after trying it, cried in admiration:  \"I say, that's not bad; whose is it?\"    At last he obtained the post of private teacher in the family of Count  Esterhazy. It was the Countess Caroline, younger of the two daughters,  who was to become the object of Schubert's later adoration. On the first  visit, however, she was only nine, and we find Schubert, with his usual  promiscuous taste, more at home with the servants than in the  drawing-room. \"The cook is a pleasant fellow,\" he writes; \"the ladies'  maid is thirty; the housemaid very pretty, and often pays me a visit;  the nurse is somewhat ancient; the butler is my rival; the two grooms  get on better with the horses than with us. The count is a little  rough; the countess proud, but not without heart, and the two young  ladies good children.\"    Eight years later he spent another period of six months at the chateau,  and at this time felt the passion for the young countess that has been  so often alluded to in his biographies. According to Bauernfeld, she  inspired an ideal devotion that sustained and comforted him to the end  of his life. There can be no doubt that etiquette and their difference  in position prevented much intercourse between the two, but his devotion  was apparently as lasting as it was unselfish. According to Kreissle, it  found expression once, on her asking him, in jesting reproach, why he  never dedicated anything to her. \"Why should I,\" came the reply;  \"everything I ever did is dedicated to you.\" One of his posthumous works  bears her name, which would hardly have been printed unless found on the  manuscript in the handwriting of this greatest of tone-poets.    Mendelssohn came of a family that boasted an eminent intellectual leader  of Judaism in the shape of Moses Mendelssohn, the composer's  grandfather. Abraham, the father, brought up his two children, Fanny and  Felix, in the Lutheran faith. Between the brother and sister there  existed the most intimate understanding and affection, lasting through  their entire lives. Both were musically gifted, possessing delicate  hands and taper fingers that were often spoken of as if made expressly  for playing Bach fugues.    Growing to maturity in the delightful family atmosphere that  characterizes the better class of Jews and their descendants, Fanny  Mendelssohn met and loved the young painter, Wilhelm Hensel. Her mother  would not hear of an immediate engagement, but, after five years of art  study in Rome, Hensel returned to become Fanny's betrothed. Felix, now  launched on his professional career, produced an organ piece especially  for the wedding. Another work for family use was his cantata, or opera,  \"Son and Stranger,\" composed for the silver wedding of his parents. This  was prepared without their knowledge, and in order that the non-musical  Hensel might take part with the rest of the family, Mendelssohn wrote  for him a number consisting wholly of one note repeated. Even with this  aid the Muses were unpropitious in the performance, and Hensel could not  hit the right pitch for this note, while all his neighbours tried to  prompt him, and the young composer sat at the piano convulsed with  laughter.    Fanny Hensel led a life of happy activity. She and her brother drew  around them a circle of celebrities that included scientific as well as  artistic leaders. Like her brother, she was a composer. At first,  however, he objected to her publishing her works, on account of her sex,  and half a dozen of her songs without words were brought out among his  own. In 1846 she ventured at last to issue some piano melodies and vocal  works, in compliance with flattering offers from Berlin publishers. Then  her famous brother sent his blessing on her becoming \"a member of the  craft,\" and hoped she would taste only the sweets and none of the  bitternesses of authorship. Her greatest work is a piano trio,[5] which  was not published until after her death. Among other compositions, she  wrote several choruses for Goethe's \"Faust,\" and a number of part-songs.    Her life came to an untimely close. In the year 1847, while conducting  the little choir that she led on Sundays, she met an end as sudden as it  was unexplained. Her hands dropped in an instant from the"]]]
