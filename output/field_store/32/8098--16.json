But when Friday passed without my receiving any tidings  I commenced to get fidgety and anxious. My feelings were not assuaged by  hearing volleys ring out every morning, followed by a death-like  stillness. These reports appeared to stifle the cries and groans of the  prisoners a little while. To me the sounds presaged serious news.  Apparently there were several prisoners condemned for spying, and each  volley, I was told, signified the flight of one or more hapless souls.  My spirits were not revived by noticing the cells on either side of me  rapidly emptying, while the little party which went down into the yard  in the morning began to dwindle in numbers very rapidly.    When the head-gaoler came round on Friday night I decided to tackle him.  The suspense was becoming intolerable. By this time he had become  somewhat more friendly towards me, and if in the mood would talk for a  brief while.    \"Were any other prisoners tried on Wednesday as spies?\" I asked  innocently.    \"Jah! All day!\"    \"How many?\"    \"May-be twenty-three!\"    \"How many have been shot?\"    \"Ach! I cannot give prisoners news of that kind. But I can tell you that  there are three left, and you are one of them!\"    I smiled to myself at the gaoler's rigid observance of the letter of  German prison law to refuse news to prisoners, yet giving the desired  information in an indirect manner.    \"When shall I hear the result of my trial?\"    \"Trial? You have not been tried yet!\"    \"What? You must be mistaken. I was tried on Wednesday night!\"    \"That wasn't the trial. That was the enquiry!\"    \"Then when will the trial come off?\"    \"You'll learn the _result_ of the trial soon enough!\" and he slammed the  door to prevent further discussion.    I was completely flabbergasted. I scratched my head and endeavoured to  collect my thoughts. Surely I could not have heard aright. Yet the man  must know what he was talking about. The more I pondered the more  perplexed I became. Then the head-gaoler's stress upon the word  \"_result_!\" What did that portend? New fears crept into my mind. So when  M----, the under-gaoler, came round next morning, I badgered him, but he  would say no more than that the trial had not yet come off.    I was completely unnerved and now commenced to fear the worst. If the  ordeal I experienced on the Wednesday night was not the trial, then what  on earth was it? I made up my mind to find out. I rang the bell wildly  and demanded to see the Commandant. He sent down word to say he could  not see me. But I was insistent, and at last, to avoid further worry, he  conceded an audience.    As I entered the office of the Commandant I was surprised to see him  handling my little camera. At my entrance he slipped it into his desk.  He looked at me curiously, and then grunted,    \"What do you want?\"    \"I wish to know when my trial is coming off. I thought I was tried last  Wednesday night.\"    \"No! That was the enquiry. We'll let you know the _result_ of the trial  pretty quickly,\" and he grinned complacently, in which little pleasantry  at my expense the officer of the guard joined in.    \"I don't want to know the _result_! I want to be there!\"    \"That is impossible. You gave all your evidence before the enquiry!\"    \"Then don't I appear at my trial?\"    \"Certainly not!\"    I was completely non-plussed at this confirmation of the head-gaoler's  statement. It was a new way, to my mind, of meting out justice to a  prisoner to deny him the right to appear at his own trial. Truly the  ways of Teuton jurisprudence or military court procedure were strange.    \"Then when will my trial be held?\" I asked, determined to glean some  definite information.    \"Ach! We cannot be bothered with a single case whilst mobilisation is  going on. We are too busy. You must wait,\" and with that he dismissed  me.    \"But surely you can give me some idea when it will be held,\" I  persisted.    \"Ach!\" and he fumed somewhat. Seeing that I was not to be turned away  without satisfaction he continued, \"Your trial will be on Monday. Get  out!\"    My reflections upon gaining my cell may be imagined. I could not resist  dwelling upon the methods of German justice, and I commenced to conjure  up visions of the trial from which I was to be absent, and to speculate  upon the final result. What would it be? I saw the heavy disadvantage  under which I was labouring, and as may be supposed my thoughts turned  to the blackest side of things. I had another forty-eight hours of  suspense in solitary confinement to bear.    To take my mind off the subject I set to work sketching an ornate design  upon the prison wall with a safety pin which I had picked up unobserved.  In the perpetual twilight which prevailed during the day in my cell I  drew, or should it be engraved? a huge Union Jack intertwined with the  Royal Standard, surmounted by the crown of Great Britain and the Royal  Arms. It occupied considerable time, but I took a quaint delight in it.  It successfully moved my thoughts from my awkward position, although at  nights I kept awake for hours on end turning over in my mind my chances  of acquittal and condemnation, more particularly the latter.    On Sunday I applied for permission to attend church, but after a long  official discussion the request was refused. The prison had no  facilities for administering spiritual pabulum to a British prisoner.  This was a mere excuse, because several of the other prisoners attended  church. How I passed that day it is difficult to record. I paced my cell  in a frenzy until I could pace no longer. I completed my design on the  wall, fumbled with my fingers, and dozed. But the hours seemed to drag  as if they were years. By now I was so overwrought that I declined to  send out for my dinner.    Monday was worse than Sunday. Throughout the day I was keyed to a high  pitch of nervous expectancy. I could scarcely keep a limb still. Every  sound made me jump, and I kept my eyes glued to the door, momentarily  expecting to gain some tidings of how my trial had gone. When the gaoler  entered with my meals and stolidly declined to enter into conversation,  I grew more and more morose, until at last I can only compare my  feelings with those of an animal trapped and at bay, waiting and ready  to land some final, fearful blow before meeting its fate.    Early in the evening of the Monday I was pacing my cell, a bundle of  twitching nerves, when the door opened to admit an officer. I almost  sprang towards him. I was to learn the truth at last. But he had not  come from the Court.    \"Do you feel hungry?\" he asked, not unkindly.    \"No.\" I answered feebly, my heart heavy within me. As a matter of fact I  was so overwrought with anxiety that I failed to feel the pangs of  hunger.    \"Well,\" he went on, \"you can have what you like.\"    Thump went my heart again. The verdict had certainly gone against me.  For what other reason had I been offered what I liked to eat? It sounded  ominous. It recalled our practice in Britain where a condemned man is  given his choice of viands on the morning of his execution. Most  assuredly I was going to be shot on the following morning, and daybreak  was not far distant.    \"I should certainly have something to eat if I were you,\" suggested the  officer.    \"Oh, very well,\" I replied resignedly, \"I'll have a roll, butter, and a  black coffee.\"    Directly the officer had gone I rang the emergency bell. M----, the  under-gaoler, answered it. With a tremendous effort I pulled myself  together.    \"So I'm going to be shot in the morning,\" I ventured, in the hope of  drawing some comment.    \"Ach! What? Lie down and keep quiet!\" was his stolid retort.    \"Look here! I want to write to my wife. Can you get me a pencil and a  sheet of paper?\"    \"Impossible!\"    \"But I must write. She does not know where I am, and she will not know  what has become of me!\"    [*large gap]    German military prisons hold their secrets tightly.    But the time crept on and no guard appeared as I had been dreading. My  drooping spirits revived because the hour of the day when prisoners were  customarily shot had passed. When I went out into the yard on the  Tuesday morning I chanced to meet the two Hindoos who had been arrested  with me. Then I realised that they were two out of the three remaining  spies. I was the third. They were in high spirits. When the guard was  not looking they told me they had been acquitted of the espionage  charge, and expected soon to be taken as far as the frontier to be  released.    I was the only one left, and I had not been told the result of my trial.  Yet these two Hindoo students who also had been before the Court on the  Wednesday had learned the verdict in their cases. But I had been denied  all communication. I regained my cell in a kind of stupor. To me it  seemed that all was lost, and I fell into the depths of despair. When  the friendly M---- came with my breakfast I pestered him with  questions.    \"Has the court been sitting?\"    \"Yes, all day Monday and all last night.\"    \"Have you heard the result of my trial?\"    \"No.\"    \"But the two Hindoos have been acquitted. Have I?\"    \"I cannot say,\" he replied sullenly.    The manner in which he avoided my eager look served to confirm my worst  fears. I strove hard to draw something further from him, but he briefly  remarked that he was forbidden to speak to prisoners.    I scarcely knew what to think. To me it was extraordinarily strange that  the two Hindoos should have heard of their acquittal and yet no one  seemed to know anything about my case. No! There was only one  construction to be placed upon the situation. The Court had gone against  me. My thoughts throughout that day were most unenviable. I fretted and  fumed, wondering when it would all be over. My nerves started to twitch  and jump, and within a short while I could not keep a limb still. The  fearful suspense was certainly driving me "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18183"],[0,"Trees, Fruits and Flowers of Minnesota, 1916 (#15)"],[1," producing this year their third consecutive heavy crop I feel justified  in taking exception to the action of the committee. My first experience  with the Surprise plum dates back to 1897, when Mr. O. M. Lord, of  Minnesota City, probably the best authority on the plum in the state in  his time, presented me with one tree, which at that time were being sold  at $1.00 each, and I was cautioned against giving it too much care or I  would kill the tree, and that is just what happened to it.    [Illustration: C. A. Pfeiffer, Winona.]    The following year, 1898, I bought twenty-five trees from Mr. Lord and  planted them late in March, on very sandy land on a southerly slope,  pruning the trees back almost to a stump. These trees were very slow in  getting started but made a satisfactory growth before the season was  over. They commenced to bear the third year after planting, and are  still producing good crops, but it is my more recent experience with  this variety that finally induced me to prepare this article. In the  spring of 1909, we set out 160 plum trees, on rich, black, loamy soil on  low land, nineteen of them being Surprise, the other varieties being,  according to numbers, Terry, Ocheeda, Stoddard, Hawkeye, Bursota, Wolf,  Omaha also a few Jewell, DeSoto, Forest Garden, American and Stella. The  Surprise trees bore a crop in 1913, again in 1914, and 1915, making it  to the present time not only the most productive but the most profitable  variety on our place. While we did not keep an accurate record of the  exact yield in 1913 and 1914, some of the trees produced fully five 16  quart cases in 1913. A fair average would perhaps be about four cases  per tree. In 1914 the crop was somewhat lighter, yielding an average of  three cases per tree. This year we picked and sold eighty-five cases,  which brought us a gross revenue of $79.60. We lost part of the crop on  account of continual rain in the picking season, or we would have had  fully 100 cases. Nine of the trees being in a more sheltered location  than the other ten held their fruit better during the growing season,  and produced a relatively heavier crop than the ten that were exposed to  our fierce winds all summer.    We have never been able to supply the demand for them, at good prices,  while other varieties went begging at any kind of a price. Among their  good qualities with us are productiveness, good size, extra fine quality  and attractive color. They are delicious to eat out of hand just as they  are ripe enough to drop from the tree. They are fine for canning,  preserving or jelly. They are practically curculio proof, and have never  been affected with brown rot as have some other varieties. Aphis never  bothers them, while Terry and some other varieties nearly had the whole  crop ruined by this pest in 1914. The branches form good, strong  shoulders at the trunk and do not split or break down in heavy storms or  under their heavy loads of fruit, as the Terry and Forest Garden do. The  flower buds and fruit form as freely on the new growth as on the old  spurs. The crop is therefore about evenly distributed all over the tree,  and while we picked almost eight cases from one tree this year it did  not appear to be overloaded, as some varieties frequently are, the  Surprise tree always being capable of maturing all the fruit that sets.    We have shipped them 300 miles by freight with perfect success, but we  pick them from the tree before fully ripe. If allowed to ripen on the  tree they drop badly, which bruises and damages them. The trees are  thrifty, vigorous growers with beautiful glossy foliage that can be  distinguished from all other varieties.    You would note on examination of the buds that we have promise of  another crop next year, but this will depend somewhat on the weather  during the blooming season. We attribute one of the reasons for our  success with the Surprise plum to the fact that they are planted among  and alongside of varieties that have the same season of blooming, and  which undoubtedly are good pollenizers, namely the Bursota, Wolf,  Ocheeda and Omaha. The bloom of Surprise being almost sterile, they  will not be a success planted alone.    [Illustration: A Surprise plum tree growing on the place of Prof. A.G.  Ruggles. It bore in 1914 four bushels, having been well sprayed with  arsenate of lead and bordeaux mixture.]    You will perhaps ask if there are no faults or diseases they are subject  to, and we will state, for one thing, the fruit drops too easily when  ripe, and you will either have to pick them before fully matured or find  a good many of them on the ground. They are also occasionally subject to  blossom blight, which was rather a benefit, as it thinned the crop out  to about the proper proportion. We also had considerable plum pocket and  fungous growth one season about ten years ago. Such has been our  experience with the Surprise plum--and will again repeat that until the  society finds a plum equally as good or better, instead of discarding it  on account of unproductiveness and recommending such poor quality  varieties as Wolf, DeSoto and some others, our learned horticulturists  should make a special study of this variety and ascertain the cause of  its unproductiveness, and also to what localities in the state it may be  adapted.    Mr. Pfeiffer: Right here I will say to those gentlemen who are looking  for a cure for brown rot or curculio, they had better plant Surprise  plums. (Applause.)    Pres. Cashman: I am glad the Surprise plum has at least one good friend  in this audience. I think it has several.    Mr. Ludlow: What has been your experience with the Ocheeda? I see you  mention it.    Mr. Pfeiffer: The Ocheeda at the present time, I am sorry to say, I am  disappointed with. I planted some fifteen years ago, and they were nice  large plums, as you have described, and they were on sandy soil. I have  twenty Ocheeda trees now, and they are quite badly subject to brown rot.  Their quality is very nice to eat from the tree out of hand, nice and  sweet.    Mr. Street: I want to second everything Mr. Pfeiffer has said. I joined  this society about twelve years ago, and it was through studying the  reports of this society that I got interested in the native plum. The  Surprise plum does very well with us in Illinois. Professor Hansen is  one of those that are responsible for my starting in with the Surprise.  It was years ago at our state meeting that he mentioned that as one of  the good plums for Northern Illinois. Well, I put it alongside of the  Wyant and the native plums that are of the same sort. I may state the  conditions under which we grow them. We always cultivate before bloom,  cultivate thoroughly. Before the growth starts we give them a very  thorough spraying with lime-sulphur spray; then just before the bloom,  just before the blossoms open, as late as we can wait, we use about 1 to  40 or 50 of the lime-sulphur solution, also put in three pounds of  arsenate of lead. Then after the blossoms fall we use the same spray  again, perhaps two weeks after that again, and we keep that up for about  four times. We have had abundant crops, and they have been very  profitable.    Pres. Cashman: I am very glad to know that the Surprise plum has friends  in Illinois, and we are also pleased to know that Mr. Street is with us  and we hope to hear from him later. The president of the Wisconsin  Horticultural Society, Mr. Rasmussen.    Mr. Rasmussen: I will say the Surprise plum has given just about the  same results with us--it is the most profitable we have.    Mr. Sauter: I was over to the Anoka county fair; it was the first part  of September, and all the other plums weren't ripe, all the stuff they  had in was green. But all the Surprise were ripe, so that certainly must  be an early ripener.    Mr. Pfeiffer: Not especially early.    Mr. Hall: I was certainly glad to hear Mr. Pfeiffer so ably defend the  Surprise plum. The Surprise plum was the only one I got any good from.  The DeSoto, Wolf and Stoddard and all those, the brown rot got them, but  the Surprise plum had perfect fruit. I am surprised that it has a black  eye from the society.    Mr. Pfeiffer: Your location is where?    Mr. Hall: Sibley County.    Mr. Kellogg: Thirteen years ago I set out a root graft that made about  five feet of growth and just as quick as it got big enough to bear it  was loaded with Surprise plums, but since then it hasn't been worth a  cent.    Mr. Miller: If Mr. Pfeiffer had been in my orchard he could not have  given us a better description of it than he did, of the Surprise plum. I  set it out about fifteen years ago. I think I paid sixty cents for those  seedlings, they stood about three and one-half feet. I never had brown  rot in them. When I set them out I put them with other varieties and set  them so the inside ones would fertilize the outside ones. Afterwards I  set these on the east side of the orchard, where they got protection  from the west wind. They have borne almost every year, and this year  they are the only ones we had a crop on.    Pres. Cashman: I think we get as near to agreeing on this question as on  most others. It is suggested that we find out how many have had success  and how many have had failures with the Surprise plum. All those who  have been successful in raising Surprise plums will please raise their  hands. (Certain hands raised.) Now, hands down. Those who have been  unsuccessful will please raise their right hands. (Other hands raised.)  It seems there were more successes than failures.    A Member: It has been mentioned that the frost this year killed the plum  crop. I noticed in my orchard previous to that frost when we had a snow  storm, I noticed that the blossoms dried up and fell from the trees  before that hard frost. I think the question of success or failure with  the Surprise, as with other plums, is sort of comparative. I don't know  of any plum"]]]
