It has been said that  Spinozism or Transcendentalism in poetic production becomes  Machiavellism in reflection: for the same reasons we may always expect  sentimentalism in theory to become under the pressure of action a very  self-protecting guile. Robespierre's mind was not rich nor flexible  enough for true statesmanship, and it is a grave mistake to suppose that  the various cunning tacks in which his career abounds, were any sign of  genuine versatility or resource or political growth and expansion. They  were, in fact, the resort of a man whose nerves were weaker than his  volition. Robespierre was a kind of spinster. Force of head did not  match his spiritual ambition. He was not, we repeat, a coward in any  common sense; in that case he would have remained quiet among the  croaking frogs of the Marsh, and by and by have come to hold a portfolio  under the first Consul. He did not fear death, and he envied with  consuming envy those to whom nature had given the qualities of  initiative. But his nerves always played him false. The consciousness of  having to resolve to take a decided step alone, was the precursor of a  fit of trembling. His heart did not fail, but he could not control the  parched voice, nor the twitching features, not the ghastly palsy of  inner misgiving. In this respect Robespierre recalls a more illustrious  man; we think of Cicero tremblingly calling upon the Senate to decide  for him whether he should order the execution of the Catilinarian  conspirators. It is to be said, however, in his favour that he had the  art, which Cicero lacked, to hide his pusillanimity. Robespierre knew  himself, and did his best to keep his own secret.    His absence during the final crisis of the anarchic party allowed events  to ripen, without committing him to that initiative in dangerous action  which he had dreaded on the Tenth of August, as he dreaded it on every  other decisive day of this burning time. The party of the Commune  became more and more daring in their invectives against the Convention  and the Committees. At length they proclaimed open insurrection. But  Paris was cold, and opinion was divided. In the night of the Thirteenth  of March, Hebert, Chaumette, Clootz, were arrested. The next day  Robespierre recovered sufficiently to appear at the Jacobin Club. He  joined his colleagues of the Committee of Public Safety in striking the  blow. On the Twenty-fourth of March the Ultra-Revolutionist leaders were  beheaded.    The first bloody breach in the Jacobin ranks was speedily followed by  the second. The Right wing of the opposition to the Committee soon  followed the Left down the ways to dusty death, and the execution of the  Anarchists only preceded by a week the arrest of the Moderates. When the  seizure of Danton had once before been discussed in the Committee,  Robespierre resisted the proposal violently. We have already seen how he  defended Danton at the Jacobin Club, when the Club underwent the process  of purification in the winter. What produced this sudden tack? How came  Robespierre to assent in March to a violence which he had angrily  discountenanced in February? There had been no change in the policy or  attitude of Danton himself. The military operations against the domestic  and foreign enemies were no sooner fairly in the way of success, than  Danton began to meditate in serious earnest the consolidation of a  republican system of law and justice. He would fain have stayed the  Terror. 'Let us leave something,' he said, 'to the guillotine of  opinion.' He aided, no doubt, in the formation of the Revolutionary  Tribunal, but this was exactly in harmony with his usual policy of  controlling popular violence without alienating the strength of popular  sympathy. The process of the tribunal was rough and summary, but it was  fairer--until Robespierre's Law of Prairial--than people usually  suppose, and it was the very temple of the goddess of Justice herself  compared with the September massacres. 'Let us prove ourselves  terrible,' Danton said, 'to relieve the people from the necessity of  being so.' His activity had been incessant in urging and superintending  the great levies against the foreigner; he had gone repeatedly on  distant and harassing expeditions, as the representative of the  Convention at the camps on the frontier. In the midst of all this he  found time to press forward measures for the instruction of the young,  and for the due appointment of judges, and his head was full of ideas  for the construction of a permanent executive council. It was this which  made him eager for a cessation of the method of Terror, and it was this  which made the Committee of Public Safety his implacable enemy.    Why, then, did Robespierre, who also passed as a man of order and  humanity, not continue to support Danton after the suppression of the  Hebertists, as he had supported him before? The common and facile answer  is that he was moved by a malignant desire to put a rival out of the  way. On the whole, the evidence seems to support Napoleon's opinion that  Robespierre was incapable of voting for the death of anybody in the  world on grounds of personal enmity. And his acquiescence in the ruin of  Danton is intelligible enough on the grounds of selfish policy. The  Committee hated Danton for the good reason that he had openly attacked  them, and his cry for clemency was an inflammatory and dangerous protest  against their system. Now Robespierre, rightly or wrongly, had made up  his mind that the Committee was the instrument by which, and which only,  he could work out his own vague schemes of power and reconstruction.  And, in any case, how could he resist the Committee? The famous  insurrectionary force of Paris, which Danton had been the first to  organise against a government, had just been chilled by the fall of the  Hebertists. Least of all could this force be relied upon to rise in  defence of the very chief whose every word for many weeks past had been  a protest against the Communal leaders. In separating himself from the  Ultras, Danton had cut off the great reservoir of his peculiar strength.    It may be said that the Convention was the proper centre of resistance  to the designs of the Committee, and that if Danton and Robespierre had  united their forces in the Convention they would have defeated Billaud  and his allies. This seems to us more than doubtful. The Committee had  acquired an immense preponderance over the Convention. They had been  eminently successful in the immense tasks imposed upon them. They had  the prestige not only of being the government--so great a thing in a  country that had just emerged from the condition of a centralised  monarchy; they had also the prestige of being a government that had done  its work triumphantly. We are now in March. In July we shall find that  Robespierre adopted the very policy that we are now discussing, of  playing off the Convention against the Committee. In July that policy  ended in his headlong fall. Why should it have been any more successful  four months earlier?    What we may say is, that Robespierre was bound in all morality to defend  Danton in the Convention at every hazard. Possibly so; but then to run  risks for chivalry's sake was not in Robespierre's nature, and no man  can climb out beyond the limitations of his own character. His narrow  head and thin blood and instable nerve, his calculating humour and his  frigid egoism, disinclined him to all games of chance. His apologists  have sought to put a more respectable colour on his abandonment of  Danton. The precisian, they say, disapproved of Danton's lax and  heedless courses. Danton said to him one day:--'What do I care? Public  opinion is a strumpet, and posterity a piece of nonsense.' How should  the puritanical lawyer endure such cynicism as this? And Danton  delighted in inflicting these coarse shocks. Again, Danton had given  various gross names of contempt to Saint Just. Was Robespierre not to  feel insults offered to the ablest and most devoted of his lieutenants?  What was more important than all, the acclamations with which the  partisans of reaction greeted the fall of the Ultras, made it necessary  to give instant and unmistakable notice to the foes of the Revolution  that the goddess of the scorching eye and fiery hand still grasped the  axe of her vengeance.    These are pleas invented after the fact. All goes to show that  Robespierre was really moved by nothing more than his invariable dread  of being left behind, of finding himself on the weaker side, of not  seeming practical and political enough. And having made up his mind that  the stronger party was bent on the destruction of the Dantonists, he  became fiercer than Billaud himself. It is constantly seen that the  waverer, of nervous atrabiliar constitution, no sooner overcomes the  agony of irresolution, than he flings himself on his object with a  vindictive tenacity that seems to repay him for all the moral  humiliation inflicted on him by his stifled doubts. He redeems the  slowness of his approach by the fury of his spring. 'Robespierre,' says  M. d'Hericault, 'precipitated himself to the front of the opinion that  was yelling against his friends of yesterday. In order to keep his usual  post in the van of the Revolution, in order to secure the advantage to  his own popularity of an execution which the public voice seemed to  demand, he came forward as the author of that execution, though only the  day before he had hesitated about its utility, and though it was, in  truth far less useful to him than it proved to be to his future  antagonists.'    Robespierre first alarmed Danton's friends by assuming a certain icy  coldness of manner, and by some menacing phrases about the faction of  the so-called Moderates. Danton had gone, as he often did, to his native  village of Arcis-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20748"],[0,"Favorite Fairy Tales (#15)"],[1,"he.    \"I would,\" answered Dick, \"but I do not know how to get any.\"    \"If you are willing,\" said the gentleman, \"come with me;\" and so  saying, he took him to a hayfield, where Dick worked briskly, and lived  merrily till the hay was all made. After this, he found himself as badly  off as before; and being almost starved again, he laid himself down at  the door of Mr. Fitzwarren, a rich merchant. Here the cook, an  ill-tempered woman, called out to poor Dick:    \"What business have you there, you lazy rogue? If you do not take  yourself away, we will see how you like a sousing of some dish-water I  have here, that is hot enough to make you jump.\"    [Illustration]    At this time Mr. Fitzwarren himself came home to dinner; and when he saw  a dirty ragged boy lying at the door, he said, in a kind and gentle  voice:    \"Why do you lie there, my lad? you seem old enough to work; I am afraid  you are lazy.\"    \"No, sir,\" said Dick to him. \"I would work with all my heart; but I do  not know anybody, and I am sick for want of food.\"    \"Poor fellow!\" answered Mr. Fitzwarren; \"get up, and let me see what  ails you.\"    Dick tried to rise, but was too weak to stand, for he had not eaten  anything for three days. So the kind merchant ordered him to be taken  into the house, and have a good dinner given to him; and to be kept to  do what dirty work he could for the cook.    Dick would have lived happily in this good family, if it had not been  for the ill-natured cook, who was finding fault and scolding him from  morning till night; and, besides, she was so fond of basting, that,  when she had no roast meat to baste, she would be basting poor Dick.    But though the cook was so ill-tempered, the footman was quite  different. He had lived in the family many years, and was an elderly  man, and very kind-hearted. He had once a little son of his own, who  died when about the age of Dick; so he could not help feeling pity for  the poor boy, and sometimes gave him a halfpenny to buy gingerbread or  a top. The footman was fond of reading, and used often in the evening to  entertain the other servants with some amusing book. Little Dick took  pleasure in hearing this good man, which made him wish very much to  learn to read too; so the next time the footman gave him a halfpenny,  he bought a little book with it; and with the footman's help, Dick soon  learnt his letters, and afterwards to read.    [Illustration]    About this time, Miss Alice, Mr. Fitzwarren's daughter, was going out  one morning for a walk, and Dick was told to put on a suit of good  clothes that Mr. Fitzwarren gave him, and walk behind her. As they went,  Miss Alice saw a poor woman with one child in her arms and another on  her back. She pulled out her purse and gave the woman some money; but as  she was putting it into her pocket again, she dropped it on the ground  and walked on. It was lucky that Dick was behind, and saw what she had  done, for he picked up the purse and gave it to her again. Another time,  when Miss Alice was sitting with the window open and amusing herself  with a favorite parrot, it suddenly flew away to the branch of a high  tree, where all the servants were afraid to venture after it. As soon as  Dick heard of this, he pulled off his coat, and climbed up the tree as  nimbly as a squirrel; and, after a great deal of trouble, caught her and  brought her down safely to his mistress. Miss Alice thanked him, and  liked him ever after for this.    The ill-humored cook was now a little kinder; but, besides this, Dick  had another hardship to get over. His bed stood in a garret, where there  were so many holes in the floor and the walls, that every night he was  waked in his sleep by the rats and mice, which ran over his face, and  made such a noise that he sometimes thought the walls were tumbling down  about him. One day, a gentleman who came to see Mr. Fitzwarren wanted  his shoes polished; Dick took great pains to make them shine, and the  gentleman gave him a penny. With this he thought he would buy a cat; so  the next day, seeing a little girl with a cat under her arm, he went up  to her, and asked if she would let him have it for a penny. The girl  said she would, and that it was a very good mouser. Dick hid the cat in  the garret, and always took care to carry a part of his dinner to her;  and in a short time he had no more trouble from the rats and mice.    [Illustration]    Soon after, his master had a ship ready to sail; and as he thought it  right all his servants should have some chance for good fortune as well  as himself, he called them into the parlor, and asked them if they  wanted to take a share in the trading trip. They all had some money that  they were willing to venture, except poor Dick, who had neither money  nor goods. For this reason he did not come into the parlor with the  rest; but Miss Alice guessed what was the matter, and ordered him to be  called in. She then said she would put in money for him from her own  purse; but her father told her this would not do, for Dick must send  something of his own. When poor Dick heard this, he said he had nothing  but a cat.    \"Fetch your cat then, my good boy,\" said Mr. Fitzwarren, \"and let her  go.\"    Dick went upstairs and brought down poor puss, and gave her to the  captain with tears in his eyes. All the company laughed at Dick's odd  venture; and Miss Alice, who felt pity for the poor boy, gave him some  halfpence to buy another cat.    This, and other marks of kindness shown him by Miss Alice, made the  ill-tempered cook jealous of poor Dick; and she began to use him more  cruelly than ever, and always made fun of him for sending his cat to  sea. She asked him if he thought his cat would sell for as much money as  would buy a stick to beat him. At last, poor Dick could not bear this  any longer, and thought he would run away from his place; so he packed  up his few things, and set out very early in the morning on the first  of November. He walked as far as Highgate, and there sat down on a  stone, which to this day is called Whittington's stone, and began to  think which road he should take farther. While he was thinking what he  should do, the bells of Bow Church began to ring, and he fancied their  sounds seemed to say:        \"Turn again, Whittington,       Lord Mayor of London.\"    [Illustration]    \"Lord Mayor of London!\" said he to himself. \"Why, to be sure I would put  up with almost anything, now, to be Lord Mayor of London, and ride in a  fine coach, when I grow to be a man! I will go back and think nothing of  the cuffing and scolding of the old cook, if I am to be Lord Mayor of  London at last.\"    Dick went back, and was lucky enough to get into the house and set about  his work before the cook came down.    The ship, with the cat on board, was a long time at sea; and was at last  driven by the winds on a part of the coast of Barbary. The people came  in great numbers to see the sailors, and treated them very civilly; and,  when they became better acquainted, were eager to buy the fine things  with which the ship was laden. When the captain saw this, he sent  patterns of the best things he had to the King of the country; who was  so much pleased with them, that he sent for the captain and the chief  mate to the palace. Here they were placed, as is the custom of the  country, on rich carpets, marked with gold and silver flowers. The King  and Queen were seated at the upper end of the room; and a number of  dishes, of the greatest rarities, were brought in for dinner; but,  before they had been on the table a minute, a vast number of rats and  mice rushed in, and helped themselves from every dish. The captain  wondered at this, and asked if these vermin were not very unpleasant.    \"Oh, yes!\" they said, \"and the King would give half of his riches to get  rid of them; for they not only waste his dinner, as you see, but disturb  him in his bedroom, so that he is obliged to be watched while he is  asleep.\"    The captain was ready to jump for joy when he heard of this. He thought  of poor Dick's cat, and told the King he had a creature on board his  ship that would kill all the rats and mice. The King was still more  glad than the captain.    \"Bring this creature to me,\" said he, \"and if it can do what you say, I  will give you your ship full of gold for her.\"    The captain, to make quite sure of his good luck, answered, that she was  such a clever cat for catching rats and mice, that he could hardly bear  to part with her; but that to oblige His Majesty he would fetch her.    \"Run, run!\" said the Queen, \"for I long to see the creature that will  do such service.\" Away went the captain to the ship while another dinner  was got ready. He came back to the palace soon enough to see the table  full of rats and mice again, and the second dinner likely to be lost in  the same way as the first. The cat did not wait for bidding, but jumped  out of the captain's arm, and in a few moments laid almost all the rats  and mice dead at her feet. The rest, in a fright, scampered away to  their holes.    [Illustration]    The King and Queen were delighted to get rid of such a plague so easily.  They desired that the creature might be brought for them to look at. On  this, the captain called out: \"Puss, puss!\" and the cat ran and jumped  upon his knee. He then held her out to the Queen, who was afraid to  touch an animal that was able to kill so many rats and mice; but when  she saw how gentle the cat seemed, and how glad she was at being stroked  by the captain, she ventured to touch her too, saying all the time:  \"Poot, poot,\" for she could not speak English. At last the Queen took  puss on her lap, and by degrees became quite free with her, till puss  purred herself to sleep. When the King had seen the actions of mistress  puss, and was told that she would soon have young ones, which might in  time kill all the rats and mice in his country, he bought the captain's  "]]]
