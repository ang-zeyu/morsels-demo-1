Thorvald then  inquired of his men, whether any of them had been wounded, and they  informed him that no one of them had received a wound. \"I have been  wounded in my arm-pit,\" says he; \"an arrow flew in between the gunwale  and the shield, below my arm. Here is the shaft, and it will bring me to  my end! I counsel you now to retrace your way with the utmost speed. But  me ye shall convey to that headland which seemed to me to offer so  pleasant a dwelling-place; thus it may be fulfilled, that the truth  sprang to my lips, when I expressed the wish to abide there for a time.  Ye shall bury me there, and place a cross at my head, and another at my  feet, and call it Crossness for ever after.\" At that time Christianity  had obtained in Greenland; Eric the Red died, however, before [the  introduction of] Christianity.    Thorvald died, and when they had carried out his injunctions, they took  their departure, and rejoined their companions, and they told each other  of the experiences which had befallen them. They remained there during  the winter, and gathered grapes and wood with which to freight the ship.  In the following spring they returned to Greenland, and arrived with  their ship in Ericsfirth, where they were able to recount great tidings  to Leif.    _Thorstein Ericsson dies in the Western Settlement._--In the meantime it  had come to pass in Greenland, that Thorstein of Ericsfirth had married,  and taken to wife Gudrid, Thorbiorn's daughter, [she] who had been the  spouse of Thori Eastman,[56-1] as has been already related. Now Thorstein  Ericsson, being minded to make the voyage to Wineland after the body of  his brother, Thorvald, equipped the same ship, and selected a crew of  twenty-five men of good size and strength, and taking with him his wife,  Gudrid, when all was in readiness, they sailed out into the open ocean,  and out of sight of land. They were driven hither and thither over the  sea all that summer, and lost all reckoning, and at the end of the first  week of winter they made the land at Lysufirth in Greenland, in the  Western Settlement. Thorstein set out in search of quarters for his crew,  and succeeded in procuring homes for all of his shipmates; but he and his  wife were unprovided for, and remained together upon the ship for two or  more days. At this time Christianity was still in its infancy in  Greenland. It befell early one morning, that men came to their tent, and  the leader inquired who the people were within the tent. Thorstein  replies: \"We are twain,\" says he; \"but who is it who asks?\" \"My name is  Thorstein, and I am known as Thorstein the Swarthy, and my errand hither  is to offer you two, husband and wife, a home with me.\" Thorstein  replied, that he would consult with his wife, and she bidding him decide,  he accepted the invitation. \"I will come after you on the morrow with a  sumpter-horse, for I am not lacking in means wherewith to provide for you  both, although it will be lonely living with me, since there are but two  of us, my wife and myself, for I, forsooth, am a very hard man to get on  with; moreover, my faith is not the same as yours, albeit methinks that  is the better to which you hold.\" He returned for them on the morrow,  with the beast, and they took up their home with Thorstein the Swarthy,  and were well treated by him. Gudrid was a woman of fine presence, and a  clever woman, and very happy in adapting herself to strangers.    Early in the winter Thorstein Ericsson's party was visited by sickness,  and many of his companions died. He caused coffins to be made for the  bodies of the dead, and had them conveyed to the ship, and bestowed  there; \"for it is my purpose to have all the bodies taken to Ericsfirth  in the summer.\" It was not long before illness appeared in Thorstein's  home, and his wife, whose name was Grimhild, was first taken sick. She  was a very vigorous woman, and as strong as a man, but the sickness  mastered her; and soon thereafter Thorstein Ericsson was seized with the  illness, and they both lay ill at the same time, and Grimhild, Thorstein  the Swarthy's wife, died, and when she was dead Thorstein went out of the  room to procure a deal, upon which to lay the corpse. Thereupon Gudrid  spoke. \"Do not be absent long, Thorstein mine!\" says she. He replied,  that so it should be. Thorstein Ericsson then exclaimed: \"Our house-wife  is acting now in a marvellous fashion, for she is raising herself up on  her elbow, and stretching out her feet from the side of the bed, and  groping after her shoes.\" At that moment Thorstein, the master of the  house, entered, and Grimhild laid herself down, wherewithal every timber  in the room creaked. Thorstein now fashioned a coffin for Grimhild's  body, and bore it away, and cared for it. He was a big man, and strong,  but it called for all [his strength], to enable him to remove the corpse  from the house. The illness grew upon Thorstein Ericsson, and he died,  whereat his wife, Gudrid, was sorely grieved. They were all in the room  at the time, and Gudrid was seated upon a chair before the bench, upon  which her husband, Thorstein, was lying. Thorstein, the master of the  house, then taking Gudrid in his arms [carried her] from the chair, and  seated himself, with her, upon another bench, over against her husband's  body, and exerted himself in divers ways to console her, and endeavored  to reassure her, and promised her that he would accompany her to  Ericsfirth with the body of her husband, Thorstein, and those of his  companions: \"I will likewise summon other persons hither,\" says he, \"to  attend upon thee, and entertain thee.\" She thanked him. Then Thorstein  Ericsson sat up, and exclaimed: \"Where is Gudrid?\" Thrice he repeated the  question, but Gudrid made no response. She then asked Thorstein, the  master, \"Shall I give answer to his question, or not?\" Thorstein, the  master, bade her make no reply, and he then crossed the floor, and seated  himself upon the chair, with Gudrid in his lap, and spoke, saying: \"What  dost thou wish, namesake?\" After a little while, Thorstein replies: \"I  desire to tell Gudrid of the fate which is in store for her, to the end  that she may be better reconciled to my death, for I am indeed come to a  goodly resting-place. This I have to tell thee, Gudrid, that thou art to  marry an Icelander, and that ye are to have a long wedded life together,  and a numerous and noble progeny, illustrious, and famous, of good odor  and sweet virtues. Ye shall go from Greenland to Norway, and thence to  Iceland, where ye shall build your home. There ye shall dwell together  for a long time, but thou shalt outlive him, and shalt then go abroad and  to the South, and shalt return to Iceland again, to thy home, and there a  church shall then be raised, and thou shalt abide there and take the  veil, and there thou shalt die.\" When he had thus spoken, Thorstein sank  back again, and his body was laid out for burial, and borne to the ship.  Thorstein, the master, faithfully performed all his promises to Gudrid.  He sold his lands and live-stock in the spring, and accompanied Gudrid to  the ship, with all his possessions. He put the ship in order, procured a  crew, and then sailed to Ericsfirth. The bodies of the dead were now  buried at the church, and Gudrid then went home to Leif at Brattahlid,  while Thorstein the Swarthy made a home for himself on Ericsfirth, and  remained there as long as he lived, and was looked upon as a very  superior man.    _Of the Wineland Voyages of Thorfinn and his Companions._--That same  summer a ship came from Norway to Greenland. The skipper's name was  Thorfinn Karlsefni; he was a son of Thord Horsehead, and a grandson of  Snorri, the son of Thord of Hoefdi. Thorfinn Karlsefni, who was a very  wealthy man, passed the winter at Brattahlid with Leif Ericsson. He very  soon set his heart upon Gudrid, and sought her hand in marriage; she  referred him to Leif for her answer, and was subsequently betrothed to  him, and their marriage was celebrated that same winter. A renewed  discussion arose concerning a Wineland voyage, and the folk urged  Karlsefni to make the venture, Gudrid joining with the others. He  determined to undertake the voyage, and assembled a company of sixty men  and five women, and entered into an agreement with his shipmates that  they should each share equally in all the spoils of the enterprise. They  took with them all kinds of cattle, as it was their intention to settle  the country, if they could. Karlsefni asked Leif for the house in  Wineland, and he replied, that he would lend it but not give it. They  sailed out to sea with the ship, and arrived safe and sound at  Leif's-booths, and carried their hammocks ashore there. They were soon  provided with an abundant and goodly supply of food, for a whale of good  size and quality was driven ashore there, and they secured it, and  flensed it, and had then no lack of provisions. The cattle were turned  out upon the land, and the males soon became very restless and vicious;  they had brought a bull with them. Karlsefni caused trees to be felled,  and to be hewed into timbers, wherewith to load his ship, and the wood  was placed upon a cliff to dry. They gathered somewhat of all of the  valuable products of the land, grapes, and all kinds of game and fish,  and other good things. In the summer succeeding the first winter,  Skrellings were discovered. A great troop of men came forth from out the  woods. The cattle were hard by, and the bull began to bellow and roar  with a great noise, whereat the Skrellings were frightened, and ran away,  with their packs wherein were gray furs, sables, and all kinds of  peltries. They fled towards Karlsefni's dwelling, and sought to effect an  entrance into the house, but Karlsefni caused the doors to be defended  [against them].
