In the face of congressional questions and criticism  in the black press, Stimson declared that the decision stemmed from a  study of the relative abilities and status of training of the troops  in the units available for conversion. If black units were  particularly affected, it was because \"many of the Negro units have  been unable to master efficiently the techniques of modern  weapons.\"[2-39] Thus, by the end of 1944, the Army had abandoned its  attempt to maintain a balance between black combat and service units,  and during the rest of the war most Negroes were assigned to service  units.                       [Footnote 2-39: Ltr, SW to Rep. Hamilton Fish, 19 Feb                     44, reprinted in U.S. Congress, House,                     _Congressional Record_, 78th Cong., 2d sess., pp.                     2007-08.]    According to the War Department, the relationship between Negroes  (p. 034)  and the Army was a mutual obligation. Negroes had the right and duty  to serve their country to the best of their abilities; the Army had  the right and the duty to see that they did so. True, the use of black  troops was made difficult because their schooling had been largely  inferior and their work therefore chiefly unskilled. Nevertheless, the  Army staff concluded, all races were equally endowed for war and most  of the less mentally alert could fight if properly led.[2-40] A manual  on leadership observed:         War Department concern with the Negro is focused directly and       solely on the problem of the most effective use of colored troops        ... the Army has no authority or intention to participate in       social reform as such but does view the problem as a matter of       efficient troop utilization. With an imposed ceiling on the       maximum strength of the Army it is the responsibility of all       officers to assure the most efficient use of the manpower       assigned.[2-41]                       [Footnote 2-40: War Department Pamphlet 20-6,                     _Command of Negro Troops_, 29 February 1944.]                       [Footnote 2-41: Army Service Forces Manual M-5,                     _Leadership and the Negro Soldier_, October 1944,                     p. iv.]    But the best efforts of good officers could not avail against poor  policy. Although the Army maintained that Negroes had to bear a  proportionate share of the casualties, by policy it assigned the  majority to noncombat units and thus withheld the chance for them to  assume an equal risk. Subscribing to the advantage of making full use  of individual abilities, the Army nevertheless continued to consider  Negroes as a group and to insist that military efficiency required  racially segregated units. Segregation in turn burdened the service  with the costly provision of separate facilities for the races.  Although a large number of Negroes served in World War II, their  employment was limited in opportunity and expensive for the service.      _The Need for Change_    If segregation weakened the Army's organization for global war, it had  even more serious effects on every tenth soldier, for as it deepened  the Negro's sense of inferiority it devastated his morale. It was a  major cause of the poor performance and the disciplinary problems that  plagued so many black units. And it made black soldiers blame their  personal difficulties and misfortunes, many the common lot of any  soldier, on racial discrimination.[2-42]                       [Footnote 2-42: Lee, _Employment of Negro Troops_, p.                     84; for a full discussion of morale, see ch. XI.                     See also David G.

Early in  the war Secretary Stimson had agreed with a General Staff  recommendation that a permanent committee be formed to evaluate racial  incidents, propose special reforms, and answer questions involving the  training and assignment of Negroes.[2-43] On 27 August 1942 he  established the Advisory Committee on Negro Troop Policies, with  Assistant Secretary McCloy as chairman.[2-44] Caught in the cross  (p. 035)  fire of black demands and Army traditions, the committee contented  itself at first with collecting information on the racial situation  and acting as a clearinghouse for recommendations on the employment of  black troops.[2-45]                       [Footnote 2-43: Memo, G-1 for CofS, 18 Jul 42; DF,                     G-1 to TAG, 11 Aug 42.

The trouble was a product of many factors, including the  psychological effects of segregation which may not have been so  obvious to the committee or even to the black soldier. Other factors,  however, were visible to all and begged for remedial action. For  example, the practice of using racially separated facilities on  military posts, which was not sanctioned in the Army's basic plan for  black troops, took hold early in the war. Many black units were  located at camps in the south, where commanders insisted on applying  local laws and customs inside the military reservations. This      (p. 036)  practice spread rapidly, and soon in widely separated sections of the  country commanders were separating the races in theaters, post  exchanges, service clubs, and buses operating on posts. The  accommodations provided Negroes were separate but rarely equal, and  substandard recreational and housing facilities assigned to black  troops were a constant source of irritation. In fact the Army, through  the actions of local commanders, actually introduced Jim Crow in some  places at home and abroad. Negroes considered such practices in  violation of military regulations and inconsistent with the announced  principles for which the United States was fighting. Many believed  themselves the victims of the personal prejudices of the local  commander. Judge Hastie reported their feelings: \"The traditional  mores of the South have been widely accepted and adopted by the Army  as the basis of policy and practice affecting the Negro soldier.... In  tactical organization, in physical location, in human contacts, the  Negro soldier is separated from the white soldier as completely as  possible.\"[2-46]                       [Footnote 2-46: Memo, Hastie for SW, 22 Sep 41, sub:                     Survey and Recommendations Concerning the                     Integration of the Negro Soldier Into the Army,                     G-1/15640-120.]    In November 1941 another controversy erupted over the discovery that  the Red Cross had established racially segregated blood banks. The Red  Cross readily admitted that it had no scientific justification for the  racial separation of blood and blamed the armed services for the  decision. Despite the evidence of science and at risk of demoralizing  the black community, the Army's Surgeon General defended the  controversial practice as necessary to insure the acceptance of a  potentially unpopular program. Ignoring constant criticism from the  NAACP and elements of the black press, the armed forces continued to  demand segregated blood banks throughout the war. Negroes appreciated  the irony of the situation, for they were well aware that a black  doctor, Charles R. Drew, had been a pioneer researcher in the plasma  extraction process and had directed the first Red Cross blood  bank.[2-47]                       [Footnote 2-47: On 16 January 1942 the Navy announced                     that \"in deference to the wishes of those for whom                     the plasma is being provided, the blood will be                     processed separately so that those receiving                     transfusions may be given blood of their own race.\"                     Three days later the Chief of the Bureau of                     Medicine, who was also the President's personal                     physician, told the Secretary of the Navy, \"It is                     my opinion that at this time we cannot afford to                     open up a subject such as mixing blood or plasma                     regardless of the theoretical fact that there is no                     chemical difference in human blood.\" See Memo, Rear                     Adm Ross T. McIntire for SecNav, 19 Jan 42,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2060"],[0,"The History of Caliph Vathek (#15)"],[1,"this  divine beauty to a husband more womanish than herself? and can you  imagine that I will suffer her charms to decay in hands so inefficient  and nerveless?  No! she is destined to live out her life within my  embraces: such is my will; retire, and disturb not the time I devote to  the homage of her charms.\"    The irritated Emir drew forth his sabre, presented it to Vathek, and  stretching out his neck, said in a firm tone of voice: \"Strike your  unhappy host, my lord! he has lived long enough, since he hath seen the  Prophet's Vicegerent violate the rites of hospitality.\"    At his uttering these words Nouronihar, unable to support any longer the  conflict of her passions, sank down in a swoon.  Vathek, both terrified  for her life and furious at an opposition to his will, bade Fakreddin  assist his daughter, and withdrew, darting his terrible look at the  unfortunate Emir, who suddenly fell backward, bathed in a sweat cold as  the damp of death.    Gulchenrouz, who had escaped from the hands of Bababalouk, and was that  instant returned, called out for help as loudly as he could, not having  strength to afford it himself.  Pale and panting, the poor child  attempted to revive Nouronihar by caresses; and it happened that the  thrilling warmth of his lips restored her to life.  Fakreddin beginning  also to recover from the look of the Caliph, with difficulty tottered to  a seat, and after warily casting round his eye to see if this dangerous  prince was gone, sent for Shaban and Sutlememe, and said to them apart:    \"My friends! violent evils require as violent remedies; the Caliph has  brought desolation and horror into my family, and how shall we resist his  power? another of his looks will send me to my grave.  Fetch then that  narcotic powder which the Dervish brought me from Aracan; a dose of it,  the effect of which will continue three days, must be administered to  each of these children; the Caliph will believe them to be dead, for they  will have all the appearance of death; we shall go as if to inter them in  the cave of Meimoune, at the entrance of the great desert of sand, and  near the cabin of my dwarfs.  When all the spectators shall be withdrawn,  you, Shaban, and four select eunuchs, shall convey them to the lake,  where provisions shall be ready to support them a month; for one day  allotted to the surprise this event will occasion, five to the tears, a  fortnight to reflection, and the rest to prepare for renewing his  progress, will, according to my calculation, fill up the whole time that  Vathek will tarry, and I shall then be freed from his intrusion.\"    \"Your plan,\" said Sutlememe, \"is a good one, if it can but be effected.  I have remarked that Nouronihar is well able to support the glances of  the Caliph, and that he is far from being sparing of them to her; be  assured, therefore, notwithstanding her fondness for Gulchenrouz, she  will never remain quiet while she knows him to be here, unless we can  persuade her that both herself and Gulchenrouz are really dead, and that  they were conveyed to those rocks for a limited season to expiate the  little faults of which their love was the cause; we will add that we  killed ourselves in despair, and that your dwarfs, whom they never yet  saw, will preach to them delectable sermons.  I will engage that  everything shall succeed to the bent of your wishes.\"    \"Be it so!\" said Fakreddin.  \"I approve your proposal; let us lose not a  moment to give it effect.\"    They forthwith hastened to seek for the powder, which, being mixed in a  sherbet, was immediately drank by Gulchenrouz and Nouronihar.  Within the  space of an hour both were seized with violent palpitations, and a  general numbness gradually ensued; they arose from the floor, where they  had remained ever since the Caliph's departure, and, ascending to the  sofa, reclined themselves at full length upon it, clasped in each other's  embraces.    \"Cherish me, my dear Nouronihar!\" said Gulchenrouz; \"put thy hand upon my  heart, for it feels as if it were frozen.  Alas! thou art as cold as  myself!  Hath the Caliph murdered us both with his terrible look?\"    \"I am dying!\" cried she in a faltering voice; \"press me closer; I am  ready to expire!\"    \"Let us die then together,\" answered the little Gulchenrouz, whilst his  breast laboured with a convulsive sigh; \"let me at least breathe forth my  soul on thy lips!\"  They spoke no more, and became as dead.    Immediately the most piercing cries were heard through the harem, whilst  Shaban and Sutlememe personated with great adroitness the parts of  persons in despair.  The Emir, who was sufficiently mortified to be  forced into such untoward expedients, and had now for the first time made  a trial of his powder, was under no necessity of counterfeiting grief.  The slaves, who had flocked together from all quarters, stood motionless  at the spectacle before them; all lights were extinguished save two  lamps, which shed a wan glimmering over the faces of these lovely  flowers, that seemed to be faded in the spring-time of life; funeral  vestments were prepared, their bodies were washed with rose-water, their  beautiful tresses were braided and incensed, and they were wrapped in  simars whiter than alabaster.  At the moment that their attendants were  placing two wreaths of their favourite jasmines on their brows, the  Caliph, who had just heard of the tragical catastrophe, arrived; he  looked not less pale and haggard than the Gouls, that wander at night  among graves; forgetful of himself and every one else, he broke through  the midst of the slaves, fell prostrate at the foot of the sofa, beat his  bosom, called himself \"atrocious murderer!\" and invoked upon his head a  thousand imprecations; with a trembling hand he raised the veil that  covered the countenance of Nouronihar, and, uttering a loud shriek, fell  lifeless on the floor.  The chief of the eunuchs dragged him off with  horrible grimaces, and repeated as he went: \"Ay, I foresaw she would play  you some ungracious turn!\"    No sooner was the Caliph gone than the Emir commanded biers to be  brought, and forbad that any one should enter the harem.  Every window  was fastened, all instruments of music were broken, and the Imams began  to recite their prayers; towards the close of this melancholy day Vathek  sobbed in silence, for they had been forced to compose with anodynes his  convulsions of rage and desperation.    At the dawn of the succeeding morning the wide folding doors of the  palace were set open, and the funeral procession moved forward for the  mountain.  The wailful cries of \"La Ilah illa Allah!\" reached to the  Caliph, who was eager to cicatrise himself and attend the ceremonial; nor  could he have been dissuaded, had not his excessive weakness disabled him  from walking; at the few first steps he fell on the ground, and his  people were obliged to lay him on a bed, where he remained many days in  such a state of insensibility, as excited compassion in the Emir himself.    When the procession was arrived at the grot of Meimoune, Shaban and  Sutlememe dismissed the whole of the train, excepting the four  confidential eunuchs who were appointed to remain.  After resting some  moments near the biers, which had been left in the open air, they caused  them to be carried to the brink of a small lake, whose banks were  overgrown with a hoary moss; this was the great resort of herons and  storks, which preyed continually on little blue fishes.  The dwarfs,  instructed by the Emir, soon repaired thither, and, with the help of the  eunuchs, began to construct cabins of rushes and reeds, a work in which  they had admirable skill; a magazine also was contrived for provisions,  with a small oratory for themselves, and a pyramid of wood neatly piled,  to furnish the necessary fuel, for the air was bleak in the hollows of  the mountains.    At evening two fires were kindled on the brink of the lake, and the two  lovely bodies, taken from their biers, were carefully deposited upon a  bed of dried leaves within the same cabin.  The dwarfs began to recite  the Koran with their clear shrill voices, and Shaban and Sutlememe stood  at some distance, anxiously waiting the effects of the powder.  At length  Nouronihar and Gulchenrouz faintly stretched out their arms, and  gradually opening their eyes, began to survey with looks of increasing  amazement every object around them; they even attempted to rise, but for  want of strength fell back again; Sutlememe on this administered a  cordial, which the Emir had taken care to provide.    Gulchenrouz, thoroughly aroused, sneezed out aloud, and raising himself  with an effort that expressed his surprise, left the cabin, and inhaled  the fresh air with the greatest avidity.    \"Yes,\" said he, \"I breathe again! again do I exist!  I hear sounds!  I  behold a firmament spangled over with stars!\"    Nouronihar, catching these beloved accents, extricated herself from the  leaves, and ran to clasp Gulchenrouz to her bosom.  The first objects she  remarked were their long simars, their garlands of flowers, and their  naked feet; she hid her face in her hands to reflect; the vision of the  enchanted bath, the despair of her father, and, more vividly than both,  the majestic figure of Vathek recurred to her memory; she recollected  also that herself and Gulchenrouz had been sick and dying; but all these  images bewildered her mind.  Not knowing where she was, she turned her  eyes on all sides, as if to recognise the surrounding scene; this  singular lake, those flames reflected from its glassy surface, the pale  hues of its banks, the romantic cabins, the bulrushes that sadly waved  their drooping heads, the storks whose melancholy cries blended with the  shrill voices of the dwarfs, everything conspired to persuade them that  the Angel of Death had opened the portal of some other world.    Gulchenrouz on his part, lost in wonder, clung to the"]]]
