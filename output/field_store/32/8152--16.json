The Catholics knew, that while he retained any  authority, all their credit with the king and the duke would be entirely  useless to them, nor must they ever expect any favor or indulgence. Even  the royalists, disappointed in their sanguine hopes of preferment, threw  a great load of envy on Clarendon, into whose hands the king seemed  at first to have resigned the whole power of government. The sale of  Dunkirk, the bad payment of the seamen, the disgrace at Chatham, the  unsuccessful conclusion of the war all these misfortunes were charged on  the chancellor, who though he had ever opposed the rupture with Holland,  thought it still his duty to justify what he could not prevent. A  building, likewise, of more expense and magnificence than his slender  fortune could afford, being unwarily undertaken by him, much exposed him  to public reproach, as if he had acquired great riches by corruption.  The populace gave it commonly the appellation of Dunkirk House.    [Illustration: 1-781-chatham.jpg CHATHAM]    The king himself, who had always more revered than loved the chancellor,  was now totally estranged from him. Amidst the dissolute manners of the  court, that minister still maintained an inflexible dignity, and would  not submit to any condescensions which he deemed unworthy of his age and  character. Buckingham, a man of profligate morals, happy in his talent  for ridicule, but exposed in his own conduct to all the ridicule which  he threw on others, still made him the object of his raillery, and  gradually lessened in the king that regard which he bore to his  minister. When any difficulties arose, either for want of power or  money, the blame was still thrown on him, who, it was believed, had  carefully at the restoration checked all lavish concessions to the king.  And what, perhaps, touched Charles more nearly, he found in Clarendon,  it is said, obstacles to his pleasures, as well as to his ambition.    The king, disgusted with the homely person of his consort, and desirous  of having children, had hearkened to proposals of obtaining a divorce,  on pretence either of her being pre-engaged to another, or having made  a vow of chastity before her marriage. He was further stimulated by his  passion for Mrs. Stuart, daughter of a Scotch gentleman; a lady of  great beauty, and whose virtue he had hitherto found impregnable: but  Clarendon, apprehensive of the consequences attending a disputed title,  and perhaps anxious for the succession of his own grandchildren, engaged  the duke of Richmond to marry Mrs. Stuart, and thereby put an end to  the king's hopes. It is pretended that Charles never forgave this  disappointment.    When politics, therefore, and inclination both concurred to make the  king sacrifice Clarendon to popular prejudices, the memory of his past  services was not able any longer to delay his fall. The great seal was  taken from him, and given to Sir Orlando Bridgeman, by the title of lord  keeper. Southampton, the treasurer, was now dead, who had persevered  to the utmost in his attachments to the chancellor. The last time he  appeared at the council table, he exerted his friendship with a vigor  which neither age nor infirmities could abate. \"This man,\" said he,  speaking of Clarendon, \"is a true Protestant, and an honest Englishman;  and while he enjoys power, we are secure of our laws, liberties, and  religion. I dread the consequences of his removal.\"    But the fall of the chancellor was not sufficient to gratify the malice  of his enemies: his total ruin was resolved on. The duke of York in vain  exerted his interest in behalf of his father-in-law. Both prince and  people united in promoting that violent measure; and no means were  thought so proper for ingratiating the court with a parliament, which  had so long been governed by that very minister who was now to be the  victim of their prejudices.    Some popular acts paved the way for the session; and the parliament,  in their first address, gave the king thanks for these instances of his  goodness; and, among the rest, they took care to mention his dismission  of Clarendon. The king, in reply, assured the houses, that he would  never again employ that nobleman in any public office whatsoever.  Immediately the charge against him was opened in the house of commons by  Mr. Seymour, afterwards Sir Edward, and consisted of seventeen articles.  The house, without examining particulars, further than hearing  general affirmations that all would be proved, immediately voted his  impeachment. Many of the articles[*] [1] we know to be either false  or frivolous; and such of them as we are less acquainted with, we  may fairly presume to be no better grounded. His advising the sale of  Dunkirk seems the heaviest and truest part of the charge; but a mistake  in judgment, allowing it to be such, where there appear no symptoms of  corruption or bad intentions, it would be very hard to impute as a crime  to any minister. The king's necessities, which occasioned that measure,  cannot with any appearance of reason be charged on Clarendon; and  chiefly proceeded from the over frugal maxims of the parliament itself,  in not granting the proper supplies to the crown.         * See note A, at the end of the volume.    When the impeachment was carried up to the peers, as it contained an  accusation of treason in general, without specifying any particulars, it  seemed not a sufficient ground for committing Clarendon to custody. The  precedents of Strafford and Laud were not, by reason of the violence of  the times, deemed a proper authority; but as the commons still insisted  upon his commitment, it was necessary to appoint a free conference  between the houses. The lords persevered in their resolution; and the  commons voted this conduct to be an obstruction to public justice, and a  precedent of evil and dangerous tendency. They also chose a committee to  draw up a vindication of their own proceedings.    Clarendon, finding that the popular torrent, united to the violence of  power, ran with impetuosity against him, and that a defence offered to  such prejudiced ears would be entirely ineffectual, thought proper to  withdraw. At Calais he wrote a paper addressed to the house of lords.  He there said, that his fortune, which was but moderate, had been  gained entirely by the lawful, avowed profits of his office, and by the  voluntary bounty of the king; that, during the first years after  the restoration, he had always concurred in opinion with the other  counsellors, men of such reputation that no one could entertain  suspicions of their wisdom or integrity: that his credit soon declined;  and however he might disapprove of some measures, he found it vain to  oppose them; that his repugnance to the Dutch war, the source of all  the public grievances, was always generally known, as well as his  disapprobation of many unhappy steps taken in conducting it: and that,  whatever pretence might be made of public offences, his real crime, that  which had exasperated his powerful enemies, was his frequent opposition  to exorbitant grants, which the importunity of suitors had extorted from  his majesty.    The lords transmitted this paper to the commons, under the appellation  of a libel; and by a vote of both houses it was condemned to be burned  by the hands of the hangman. The parliament next proceeded to exert  their legislative power against Clarendon, and passed a bill of  banishment and incapacity, which received the royal assent. He retired  into France, where he lived in a private manner. He survived his  banishment six years; and he employed his leisure chiefly in reducing  into order the History of the Civil Wars, for which he had before  collected materials. The performance does honor to his memory; and,  except Whitlocke's Memorials, is the most candid account of those times  composed by any contemporary author.    Clarendon was always a friend to the liberty and constitution of his  country. At the commencement of the civil wars, he had entered into the  late king's service, and was honored with a great share in the esteem  and friendship of that monarch: he was pursued with unrelenting  animosity by the long parliament: he had shared all the fortunes and  directed all the counsels of the present king during his exile: he had  been advanced to the highest trust and offices after the restoration:  yet all these circumstances, which might naturally operate with such  force, either on resentment, gratitude, or ambition, had no influence  on his uncorrupted mind. It is said, that when he first engaged in the  study of the law, his father exhorted him with great earnestness to shun  the practice, too common in that profession, of straining every point  in favor of prerogative, and perverting so useful a science to the  oppression of liberty; and in the midst of these rational and virtuous  counsels, which he reiterated, he was suddenly seized with an apoplexy,  and expired in his son's presence. This circumstance gave additional  weight to the principles which he inculcated.    The combination of king and subject to oppress so good a minister,  affords to men of opposite dispositions an equal occasion of inveighing  against the ingratitude of princes, or ignorance of the people. Charles  seems never to have mitigated his resentment against Clarendon; and the  national prejudices pursued him to his retreat in France. A company of  English soldiers, being quartered near him, assaulted his house, broke  open the doors, gave him a dangerous wound on the head, and would have  proceeded to the last extremities, had not their officers, hearing of  the violence, happily interposed.    {1668.} The next expedient which the king embraced in order to acquire  popularity, is more deserving of praise; and, had it been steadily  pursued,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19217"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol.II. (#15)"],[1,"y; that all his papers, accounts, and stores,  should be secured; and that duke Schomberg might be empowered to fill  his place with a more able purveyor. The king gave them to understand  that he had already sent orders to the general for that purpose.  Nevertheless, they in another petition requested his majesty to name  those who had recommended Shales to his service, as he had exercised the  same office under king James, and was suspected of treasonable practices  against the government. William declined gratifying their request; but  he afterwards sent a message to the house, desiring them to recommend  a certain number of commissioners to superintend such provisions and  preparations as might be necessary for that service, as well as to  nominate certain persons to go over and examine the state of the army  in Ireland. The commons were so mollified by this instance of his  condescension, that they left the whole affair to his own direction,  and proceeded to examine other branches of misconduct. Instances of  mismanagement appeared so numerous and so flagrant, that they resolved  upon a subsequent address, to explain the ill conduct and success of  his army and navy; to desire he would find out the author of these  miscarriages, and for the future intrust unsuspected persons with the  management of affairs. They ordered the victuallers of the fleet to be  taken into custody, on suspicion of their having furnished the navy with  unwholesome provisions, and new commissioners were appointed. Bitter  reproaches were thrown out against the ministry. Mr. Hambden expressed  his surprise that the administration should consist of those very  persons whom king James had employed, when his affairs were desperate,  to treat with the prince of Orange, and moved that the king should be  petitioned in an address to remove such persons from his presence and  councils. This was a stroke aimed at the earl of Nottingham, whose  office of secretary Hambden desired to possess; but his motion was not  seconded, the court-members observing that James did not depute these  lords to the prince of Orange because they were attached to his own  interest, but for a very different reason, namely, that they were well  known to disapprove of his measures, and therefore would be the more  agreeable to his highness. The house however voted an address to the  king, desiring that the authors of the miscarriages might be brought to  condign punishment.    {WILLIAM AND MARY, 1688--1701.}          WILLIAM IRRITATED AGAINST THE WHIGS.    In the sequel, the question was proposed, Whether a placeman ought to  have a seat in the house? and a very warm debate ensued: but it was  carried in the affirmative, on the supposition that by such exclusion  the commonwealth would be deprived of some of the ablest senators of the  kingdom. But what chiefly irritated William against the whigs was their  backwardness in promoting the public service, and their disregard of the  earnest desire he expressed to see his revenue settled for life. He said  his title was no more than a pageant, and the worst of all governments  was that of a king without treasure. Nevertheless, they would not grant  the civil list for a longer term than one year. They began to think  there was something arbitrary in his disposition. His sullen behaviour  in all probability first infused this opinion, which was strengthened  and confirmed by the insinuations of his enemies. The Scots who had come  up to London to give an account of the proceedings in their parliament,  were infected with the same notion. One Simpson, a presbyterian of that  country, whom the earl of Portland employed as a spy, had insinuated  himself into the confidence of Nevil Payne, an active and intelligent  partisan and agent of king James; by which means he supplied the earl  with such intelligence as raised him to some degree of credit with that  minister. This he used in prepossessing the earl against the king's best  friends, and infusing jealousies which were soon kindled into mutual  distrust and animosity.          PLOT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.    Sir James Montgomery, who had been a warm advocate for the revolution,  received advice that the court suspected him and others of disaffection,  and was employed in seeking evidence by which they might be prosecuted.  They were equally alarmed and incensed at this intimation, and Payne  seized the opportunity of seducing them into a correspondence with the  exiled king. They demanded the settlement of the presbytery in Scotland,  and actually engaged in a treaty for his restoration. They reconciled  themselves to the duke of Queensbury, and the other noblemen of the  episcopal party: they wrote to James for a supply of money, arms, and  ammunition, together with a reinforcement of three thousand men from  Dunkirk. Montgomery had acquired great interest among the whigs of  England, and this he-employed in animating them against the king and  the ministry. He represented them as a set of wicked men, who employed  infamous spies to insnare and ruin the fast friends of the government,  and found means to alienate them so much from William, that they began  to think in earnest of recalling their banished prince The duke of  Bolton and the earl of Monmouth were almost persuaded into a conspiracy  for this purpose; they seemed to think James was now so well convinced  of his former errors, that they might trust him without scruple.  Montgomery and Payne were the chief managers of the scheme, and they  admitted Ferguson into their councils, as a veteran in the arts of  treason. In order to blast William's credit in the city, they circulated  a report that James would grant a full indemnity, separate himself  entirely from the French interest, and be contented with a secret  connivance in favour of the Roman catholics. Montgomery's brother  assured the bishop of Salisbury that a treaty with king James was  absolutely concluded, and an invitation subscribed by the whole cabal.  He said this paper would be sent to Ireland by the way of France, as the  direct communication was difficult; and he proposed a method for seizing  it before it should be conveyed out of the kingdom. Williamson, the  supposed bearer of it, had obtained a pass for Flanders, and a messenger  being sent in pursuit of him, secured his clothes and portmanteau; but  after a very strict examination nothing appeared to justify the  intelligence. Williamson had previously delivered the papers to Simpson,  who hired a boat at Deal, and arrived in safety at France. He returned  with large assurances, and twelve thousand pounds were remitted to the  Scottish undertakers. Montgomery the informer seeing his intelligence  falsified, lost his credit with the bishop, and dreading the resentment  of the other party, retired to the continent. The conspirators loudly  complained of the false imputations they had incurred. The pretended  discoveries were looked upon as fictions of the ministry, and the king  on this occasion suffered greatly in the opinion of his subjects.    {WILLIAM AND MARY, 1688--1701.}          DEBATES ABOUT THE CORPORATION BILLS.    The tories still continued to carry on a secret negotiation with the  court. They took advantage of the ill-humour subsisting between the  king and the whigs; and promised large supplies of money provided this  parliament should be dissolved and another immediately convoked. The  opposite party, being apprized of their intention, brought a bill into  the house of commons for restoring corporations to their ancient rights  and privileges. They knew their own strength at elections consisted  in these corporations; and they inserted two additional severe clauses  against those who were in any shape concerned in surrendering charters.  The whole power of the tories was exerted against this clause; and now  the whigs vied with them in making court to his majesty, promising to  manifest the most submissive obedience should this bill be enacted into  a law. The strength of the tories was now become so formidable to  the house, that they out-voted the other party, and the clauses were  rejected; but the bill passed in its original form. The lords debated  upon the point, Whether a corporation could be forfeited or surrendered?  Lord chief justice Holt and two other judges declared their opinion in  the affirmative: the rest thought otherwise, as no precedents could be  produced farther back than the reign of Henry VIII. when the abbeys were  surrendered; and this instance seemed too violent to authorize such a  measure in a regular course of administration. The bill, however, passed  by one voice only. Then both parties quickened their applications to the  king, who found himself so perplexed and distracted between two factions  which he equally feared, that he resolved to leave the government in the  queen's hands and retire to Holland. He communicated this design to the  marquis of Carmarthen, the earl of Shrewsbury, and some other noblemen,  who pressed him to lay aside his resolution, and even mingled tears with  their remonstrances.          THE KING RESOLVES TO FINISH THE IRISH WAR IN PERSON.    He at length complied with their request, and determined to finish the  Irish war in person. This design was far from being agreeable to the  parliament. His friends dreaded the climate of that country, which might  prove fatal to his weak constitution. The well-wishers of James were  afraid of that prince's being hard pressed, should William take the  field against him in person.    Both houses, therefore, began to prepare an address against this  expedition. In order to prevent this remonstrance, the king went to the  parliament, and formally signified his resolution. After his speech they  were prorogued to the second day of April. On the sixth day of February  they were dissolved by proclamation, and a new parliament was summoned  to meet on the twentieth day of March."]]]
