Would you ask one Boer to fight  against another Boer simply because he lived on one side of a river and his  blood relation lived on the other? You Britishers brag of your pride of  blood, and draw your fighting stock from all parts of the world in war  time, but you have no generosity; you won't allow other people to be proud  of their blood too.\"    I tried to persuade them that I did not for one moment think that Britain  would be vindictive towards so-called rebels in the hour of victory, and  pointed out that, in my small opinion, such a course would be foreign to  the traditions of the Motherland; and was often met with the retort that if  England did so the shame would be hers, not theirs. Many a time I was told  to remember the Jameson raid and the manner in which the Boers treated not  only the leaders of that band of adventurers, but the men also. \"Look  here,\" said one old fighting man to me, as he leant with negligent grace on  his rifle, \"I was one of those who helped to corner Jameson and his men,  and I can tell you that we Boers knew very well that we would have been  acting within our rights if we had shot Jameson and every man he had with  him, because his was not an act of war--it was an act of piracy; and had we  done so, and England had attempted to avenge the deed, half the civilised  world would have ranged themselves on our side; but we did not seek those  men's blood; we gave them quarter as soon as they asked for it, and after  that, though we knew very well they had done all that men could do to  involve us in a war of extermination with a great nation, we sent their  leader home to his own country to be tried by his own countrymen, and the  rank and file we forgave freely. We may be a nation of white savages, but  our past does not prove it, and if Britain wins in the war now going on she  will have to be very generous indeed before we will need to blush for our  conduct.\"    \"Why should not the white population of South Africa be ready to live under  the protection of Britain? The yoke cannot be so heavy when men of all  creeds, colours, and nationalities who have lived under that rule for years  are now ready to volunteer to fight for her, even against you, who have  admittedly done them no direct wrong?\"    \"Why should we live under any flag but our own?\" replied the old fighting  man passionately. \"We came here and found the country a wilderness in the  hands of savages; we fought our way into the land step by step, holding our  own with our rifles; we had to live lives of fearful hardships, facing wild  beasts and wilder men; we won with the strong hand the land we live in. Why  should we bow our necks to Britain's yoke, even if it be a yoke of silk?\"  And as he spoke a murmur of deep and earnest sympathy ran through the ranks  of the Boers who were standing around him.    \"You, of course, blame all the Colonials, Australians and others, for  coming to fight against you?\" I asked. \"I don't know that I do, or that my  people do, in a sense,\" the veteran replied. \"It all depends upon the  spirit which animated them. If your Australians, who are of British blood,  came here to fight for your Motherland, believing that her cause was a just  and a holy one, and that she needed your aid, you did right, for a son will  help his mother, if he be a son worth having; but if the Australians came  here merely for the sake of adventure, merely for sport, as men come in  time of peace to shoot buck on the veldt, then woe to that land, for though  God may make no sign to-day nor to-morrow, yet, in His own time, He will  surely wring from Australia a full recompense in sweat and blood and tears;  for whether we be right or wrong, our God knows that we are giving our  lives freely for what we in our hearts believe to be a holy cause.\"    \"What do you fellows think of Australians as fighters?\"    I asked the question carelessly, but the answer that I got brought me to my  bearings quickly, for then I learnt that more than one gallant Australian  officer dear to me had fallen, never to rise again, since I had been taken  prisoner. The man who spoke was little more than a lad, a pale-faced,  slenderly built son of the veldt. He had tangled curly hair, and big,  pathetic blue eyes, soft as a girl's, and limbs that lacked the rugged  strength of the old Boer stock; but there was that nameless \"something,\"  that indefinable expression in his face which warranted him a brave man. He  carried one arm in a sling, and the bandage round his neck hid a bullet  wound. \"The Australians can fight,\" he said simply. \"They wounded me,  and--they killed my father.\" Perhaps it was the wind sighing through the  hospital trees that made the Boer lad's voice grow strangely husky;  possibly the same cause filled the blue eyes with unshed tears.    \"It was in fair fight, lad,\" I said gently; \"it was the fortune of war.\"    \"Yes,\" he murmured, \"it was in fair fight, an awful fight--I hope I'll  never look upon another like it. Damn the fighting,\" he broke out fiercely.  \"Damn the fighting. I didn't hate your Australians. I didn't want to kill  any of them. My father had no ill-will to them, nor they to him, yet he is  out there--out there between two great kopjes--where the wind always blows  cold and dreary at night-time.\" The laddie shuddered. \"It makes a man doubt  the love of the Christ,\" he said. \"My father was a good man, a kind man,  who never turned the stranger empty-handed from his door, even the Kaffirs  on the farm loved him; and now he is lying where no one can weep over his  grave. We piled great rocks on his grave. My cousin and I buried him. We  had no shovels; we scooped a hole in the hard earth as well as we could, a  long, shallow hole, and we laid him in it. I took his head and Cousin  Gustave carried his feet. We folded his hands on his breast, laid his old  rifle by his side, because he had always loved that gun, and never used any  other when out hunting. Then we pushed the earth in on him gently with our  hands, breaking the hard lumps up and crumbling them in our palms, so that  they should not bruise his poor flesh. He had always been so kind, we could  not hurt him, even though we knew he was dead, for he had been gentle to  all of us in life; even the cows and the oxen at home loved him--and now  who will go back and tell mother and little Yacoba that he is dead, that he  will come to them no more? Oh, damn the war,\" the lad called again in his  pain. \"I don't know--only God knows--which side is right or wrong, but I do  know that the curse of the Christ will rest on the heads of those who have  made this war for ambition's sake or the greed of gold, and the good God  will not let the widow and the orphan child go unavenged; blood will yet  speak for blood, and it must rest either on the heads of Kruger and Steyn,  or Chamberlain and Rhodes.\"    \"Tell me, comrade, of the Australians who fell. They were my countrymen.\"    \"It was a cruel fight,\" he said. \"We had ambushed a lot of the British  troops--the Worcesters, I think, they called them. They could neither  advance nor retire; we had penned them in like sheep, and our field cornet,  Van Leyden, was beseeching them to throw down their rifles to save being  slaughtered, for they had no chance. Just then we saw about a hundred  Australians come bounding over the rocks in the gully behind us. There were  two great big men in front cheering them on. We turned and gave them a  volley, but it did not stop them. They rushed over everything, firing as  they came, not wildly, but as men who know the use of a rifle, with the  quick, sharp, upward jerk to the shoulder, the rapid sight, and then the  shot. They knocked over a lot of our men, but we had a splendid position.  They had to expose themselves to get to us, and we shot them as they came  at us. They were rushing to the rescue of the English. It was splendid, but  it was madness. On they came, and we lay behind the boulders, and our  rifles snapped and snapped again at pistol range, but we did not stop those  wild men until they charged right into a little basin which was fringed  around all its edges by rocks covered with bushes. Our men lay there as  thick as locusts, and the Australians were fairly trapped. They were far  worse off than the Worcesters, up high in the ravine.    \"Our field cornet gave the order to cease firing, and called on them to  throw down their rifles or die. Then one of the big officers--a, great,  rough-looking man, with a voice like a bull--roared out, 'Forward  Australia!--no surrender!' Those were the last words he ever uttered, for a  man on my right put a bullet clean between his eyes, and he fell forward  dead. We found later that his name was Major Eddy, of the Victorian Rifles.  He was as brave as a lion, but a Mauser bullet will stop the bravest. His  men dashed at the rocks like wolves; it was awful to see them. They smashed  at our heads with clubbed rifles, or thrust their rifles up against us  through the rocks and fired. One after another their leaders fell. The  second big man went down early, but he was not killed. He was shot through  the groin, but not dangerously. His name was Captain McInnerny. There was  another one, a little man named Lieutenant Roberts; he was shot through the  heart. Some of the others I forget. The men would not throw down their  rifles; they fought like furies. One man I saw climb right on to the rocky  ledge where Big Jan Albrecht was stationed. Just as he got there a bullet  took him, and he staggered and dropped his rifle. Big Jan jumped forward to  catch him before he toppled over the ledge, but the Australian struck Jan  in the mouth with his clenched fist, and fell over into the ravine below  and was killed.    \"We killed and wounded an awful lot of them, but some got away; they fought  their way out. I saw a long row of their dead and wounded laid out on the  slope of a farmhouse that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16140"],[0,"The Curious Book of Birds (#15)"],[1,".    \"O Whitebird,\" she chuckled, \"what a sight! what a sight! Your lovely  coat, your spotless feathers! Oh, you greedy, greedy _Blackbird_!\"    Then he who had been Whitebird looked down at himself and saw what a  dreadful thing had happened. And he closed his eyes and gave a hoarse,  sad croak. For the smoke and flame of the dragon's breath had smirched  and scorched him from top to toe, so that he was no longer white, but  thenceforth and forever Blackbird.    I think Mother Magpie must have told the story to her children,  chuckling over the greedy fellow's failure. And they told it to the  children of sunny France, from whom I got the tale for you. So now you  know why the Blackbird looks so solemn and so sulky in his suit of rusty  black; and why his nerves are so weak that if one suddenly surprises  him, picking up seeds in the field, he gives a terrible scream of  fright. For he thinks one is that dreadful dragon-creature who chased  him and so nearly gobbled him on that unlucky day, long ago.    Poor Brother Blackbird! Don't let him know I told you all this; it would  make him so very much ashamed.          THE BLACKBIRD AND THE FOX      One day Madame Fox, who was strolling along under the hedge, heard a  Blackbird trilling on a branch. Quick as thought she jumped and seized  the little fellow, and was about to gobble him down then and there. But  the Blackbird began to chirp piteously:--    \"Oh, oh, Madame Fox! What are you thinking of? Just see, I am such a  tiny mouthful! And when I am gone--I am gone. Only let me free and I  will tell you something. Look! Here come some peasant women with eggs  and cheese which they are carrying to the market at Verrieres. That  would be a meal worth having! Only let me go, and I will help you,  Master Fox.\"    The Fox saw that this might be a good plan which the bird proposed, so  she let him go.    And what do you think the Blackbird did? He began to hop, hop, hop  toward the women, dragging his wing behind him as if it were broken,  which is a trick some birds know very well.    \"Look!\" cried one of the women, when she caught sight of him. \"Oh, look  at the little Blackbird there! His wing is broken and he cannot fly. I  shall try to catch him.\" And she ran as fast as she could, making her  hands into a little cage to put over him. The other women, too, set down  their baskets, for convenience--set them down right in the middle of the  road--and joined the chase after the poor little Blackbird, so lame, so  lame! But always, as they came close to him, he managed to flutter out  of reach.    Meanwhile, Madame Fox went round about by the hedge and came all quietly  and unseen to the place where the baskets waited in the road. And oh!  what a good dinner she found there; chickens and eggs and fresh cheese  nicely done up for the market. And the greedy old lady ate them all--all  the chickens and the eggs and the cheeses. My! How fat she was when all  was done.    Now the Blackbird hopped on and on for a long, long way, until, by  cocking his eye, he saw that Madame Fox had finished her dinner. And  then, houff! Up he flew, with a jolly chirp of laughter, right over the  heads of the astonished women. What of his broken wing now? He began to  whistle, to sing, to chirrup like a crazy bird up there in the air. The  women looked at one another sheepishly.    \"Ah, the wicked Blackbird!\" they said. \"One would have thought that he  could not fly at all. But look at him, the sly creature! Oho, it is a  pretty trick he has played us!\"    They turned back to where they had left their baskets, intending to  start on for the market. But when they came there--well, well! What a  shame!--they found the eggs, the chickens, the cheeses all gone--eaten  up by the greedy Fox. And then they began to scold and cry.    \"Oh, what misfortune!\" they wailed. \"We have lost our eggs, our  chickens, and our cheeses, and there is nothing left to carry to market.  We have not even a Blackbird to show for our morning's work. Oh dear! oh  dear! It is all the fault of that wicked, deceitful little bird.\"    And, instead of going on to Verrieres, they turned about with their  empty baskets and went back home, a sorry party, scolding and crying all  the way. But long before they reached their homes and their angry  husbands Madame Fox was comfortably snoozing her after-dinner nap under  the hedge; while the happy Blackbird picked up juicy bugs in the  neighboring meadow, with one eye cocked to guard against being surprised  a second time by any bushy-tailed rogue.    [Illustration: _He managed to flutter out of reach_]          THE DOVE WHO SPOKE TRUTH      The Dove and the wrinkled little Bat once went on a journey together.  When it came towards night a storm arose, and the two companions sought  everywhere for a shelter. But all the birds were sound asleep in their  nests and the animals in their holes and dens. They could find no  welcome anywhere until they came to the hollow tree where old Master Owl  lived, wide awake in the dark.    \"Let us knock here,\" said the shrewd Bat, \"I know the old fellow is not  asleep. This is his prowling hour, and but that it is a stormy night he  would be abroad hunting.--What ho, Master Owl!\" he squeaked, \"will you  let in two storm-tossed travelers for a night's lodging?\"    Gruffly the selfish old Owl bade them enter, and grudgingly invited them  to share his supper. The poor Dove was so tired that she could scarcely  eat, but the greedy Bat's spirits rose as soon as he saw the viands  spread before him. He was a sly fellow, and immediately began to flatter  his host into good humor. He praised the Owl's wisdom and his courage,  his gallantry and his generosity; though every one knew that however  wise old Master Owl might be, he was neither brave nor gallant. As for  his generosity,--both the Dove and the Bat well remembered his  selfishness towards the poor Wren, when the Owl alone of all the birds  refused to give the little fire-bringer a feather to help cover his  scorched and shivering body.    All this flattery pleased the Owl. He puffed and ruffled himself, trying  to look as wise, gallant, and brave as possible. He pressed the Bat to  help himself more generously to the viands, which invitation the sly  fellow was not slow to accept.    During this time the Dove had not uttered a word. She sat quite still  staring at the Bat and wondering to hear such insincere speeches of  flattery. Suddenly the Owl turned to her.    \"As for you, Miss Pink-eyes,\" he said gruffly, \"you keep careful  silence. You are a dull table-companion. Pray, have you nothing to say  for yourself?\"    \"Yes,\" exclaimed the mischievous Bat, \"have you no words of praise for  our kind host? Methinks he deserves some return for this wonderfully  generous, agreeable, tasteful, well-appointed, luxurious, elegant, and  altogether acceptable banquet. What have you to say, O little Dove?\"    But the Dove hung her head, ashamed of her companion, and said very  simply:--    \"O Master Owl, I can only thank you with all my heart for the  hospitality and shelter which you have given me this night. I was beaten  by the storm, and you took me in. I was hungry, and you gave me your  best to eat. I cannot flatter nor make pretty speeches like the Bat. I  never learned such manners. But I thank you.\"    \"What!\" cried the Bat, pretending to be shocked. \"Is that all you have  to say to our obliging host? Is he not the wisest, bravest, most gallant  and generous of gentlemen? Have you no praise for his noble character as  well as for his goodness to us? I am ashamed of you! You do not deserve  such hospitality. You do not deserve this shelter.\"    The Dove remained silent. Like Cordelia in the play, she could not speak  untruths even for her own happiness.    \"Truly, you are an unamiable guest,\" snarled the Owl, his yellow eyes  growing keen and fierce with anger and mortified pride. \"You are an  ungrateful bird, Miss, and the Bat is right. You do not deserve this  generous hospitality which I have offered, this goodly shelter which you  asked. Away with you! Leave my dwelling! Pack off into the storm and see  whether or not your silence will soothe the rain and the wind. Be off, I  say!\"    \"Yes, away with her!\" echoed the Bat, flapping his leathery wings. And  the two heartless creatures fell upon the poor little Dove and drove her  out into the dark and stormy night.    Poor little Dove! All night she was tossed and beaten about shelterless  in the storm, because she had been too truthful to flatter the vain old  Owl. But when the bright morning dawned, draggled and weary as she was,  she flew to the court of King Eagle and told him all her trouble. Great  was the indignation of that noble bird.    \"For his flattery and his cruelty let the Bat never presume to fly  abroad until the sun goes down,\" he cried. \"As for the Owl, I have  already doomed him to this punishment for his treatment of the Wren. But  henceforth let no bird have anything to do with either of them, the Bat  or the Owl. Let them be outcasts and night-prowlers, enemies to be  attacked and punished if they appear among us, to be avoided by all in  their loneliness. Flattery and inhospitality, deceit and cruelty,--what  are more hideous than these? Let them cover themselves in darkness and  shun the happy light of day. As for you, little Dove, let this be a  lesson to you to shun the company of flatterers, who are sure to get you  into trouble. But you shall always be loved for your simplicity and  truth. And as a token of our affection your name shall be used by poets  as long as the world shall last to rhyme with _love_.\"    The words of the wise King Eagle are true to this day. So now you know  why a great many poems came to be written in which the rhymes _dove_ and  _love_ have not seemed to make any particular sense.
