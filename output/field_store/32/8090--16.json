There was  Babbette, and Nannette, and Pierrot, and Jeannot,--I cannot tell them  all, but Jean knew every name.    \"Come, Bettine and Marie. Come, Pierrot and Croisette. Come, pretty  ones all,\" he called as he led them from the fold that day. \"I will  carry you to the meadows where the daisies grow.\"    \"Baa,\" answered the sheep, well satisfied, as they followed him down  the king's highway, and over the hill to the pasture lands.    The other shepherds were already there with their flocks, so Jean was  not lonely. He watered his sheep at the dancing brook that ran through  the flowers, and led them along its shady banks to feed in the sunny  fields beyond, and not one lambkin strayed from his care to the forest  paths.    The forest lay dim and shadowy on one side of the pasture lands. The  deer lived there, and the boars that fed upon acorns, and many other  creatures that loved the wild woods. There had been wolves in the  forest, but the king's knights had driven them away and the shepherds  feared them no longer. Only the old men like Jean's grandfather, and  the little boys like Jean, talked of them still.    Jean was not afraid. Oh, no. There was not a lamb in the flock so  merry and fearless as he. He sang with the birds and ran with the  brook, and laughed till the echoes laughed with him as he watched the  sheep from early morn to noon, when the shadows fell straight across  the grass and it was time for him to eat his dinner.    There were little cakes in Jean's dinner basket. He had seen his  mother put them there, but he had not tasted a single one when, out on  the king's highway, beyond the hill, he heard the sound of pipes and  drums, and the tramp, tramp of many feet.    The other shepherds heard too, and they began to listen and to stare  and to run. \"The king and his knights are coming,\" they cried. \"Come  let us see them as they pass by.\"    \"Who will take care of the sheep?\" asked Jean, but nobody answered, so  he too left his dinner and ran with the rest, away from the pastures  and up the hillside path that led to the highway.    \"How pleased my mother will be when I tell her that I have seen the  king,\" he said to himself, and he was hurrying over the hill top when  all at once he remembered the forest, and the wolf, and his  grandfather's words.    \"Come on,\" called the others.    \"I must stay with the sheep,\" answered he; and he turned and went  back, though the pipes and the drums all seemed to say, \"Come this  way, come this way.\" He could scarcely keep from crying as he  listened.    There was nothing in sight to harm the sheep, and the pasture lands  were quiet and peaceful, but into the forest that very day a hungry  gray wolf had come. His eyes were bright and his ears were sharp and  his four feet were as soft as velvet, as he came creeping, creeping,  creeping under the houses and through the tanglewood. He put his nose  out and sniffed the air, and he put his head out and spied the sheep  left alone in the meadows. \"Now's my chance,\" he said, and out he  sprang just as little Jean down the hill.    \"Wolf, wolf, wolf!\" shouted Jean. \"Wolf, wolf, wolf!\" He was only a  little boy, but he was brave and his voice rang clear as a bugle call  over the valley, and over the hill, \"Wolf, wolf, wolf!\"    The shepherds and knights and the king himself came running and riding  to answer his cry, and as for the gray wolf, he did not even stop to  look behind him as he sped away to the forest shades. He ran so fast  and he ran so far that he was never seen in the king's country again,  though the shepherds in the pastures watched for him day after day.    Jean led his flock home at eventide, white sheep and black sheep and  frolicsome lambs, not one was missing.    \"Was the day long?\" asked his mother, who was watching in the doorway  for him.    \"Are the sheep all in?\" called the sick father.    \"Did the wolf come?\" said the old grandfather; but there is no need  for me to tell you what _Jean_ said. You can imagine that for  yourself.    [*] From \"More Mother Stories,\" by Maud Lindsay. Used by permission of  the author and the publishers--the Milton Bradley Company.          BABOUSCKA[*]    Russian Legend      It was the night the dear Christ Child came to Bethlehem. In a country  far away from Him, an old, old woman named Babouscka sat in her snug  little house by her warm fire. The wind was drifting the snow outside  and howling down the chimney, but it only made Babouscka's fire burn  more brightly.    \"How glad I am that I may stay indoors!\" said Babouscka, holding her  hands out to the bright blaze. But suddenly she heard a loud rap at  her door. She opened it and her candle shone on three old men standing  outside in the snow. Their beards were as white as the snow, and so  long that they reached the ground. Their eyes shone kindly in the  light of Babouscka's candle, and their arms were full of precious  things--boxes of jewels, and sweet-smelling oils, and ointments.    \"We have traveled far, Babouscka,\" said they, \"and we stop to tell you  of the Baby Prince born this night in Bethlehem. He comes to rule the  world and teach all men to be loving and true. We carry Him gifts.  Come with us, Babouscka!\"    But Babouscka looked at the driving snow, and then inside at her cozy  room and the crackling fire. \"It is too late for me to go with you,  good sirs,\" she said, \"the weather is too cold.\" She went inside again  and shut the door, and the old men journeyed on to Bethlehem without  her. But as Babouscka sat by her fire, rocking, she began to think  about the little Christ Child, for she loved all babies.    \"Tomorrow I will go to find Him,\" she said; \"tomorrow, when it is  light, and I will carry Him some toys.\"    So when it was morning Babouscka put on her long cloak, and took her  staff, and filled a basket with the pretty things a baby would  like--gold balls, and wooden toys, and strings of silver cobwebs--and  she set out to find the Christ Child.    But, oh! Babouscka had forgotten to ask the three old men the road to  Bethlehem, and they had traveled so far through the night that she  could not overtake them. Up and down the roads she hurried, through  woods and fields and towns, saying to whomsoever she met: \"I go to  find the Christ Child. Where does he lie? I bring some pretty toys for  His sake.\"    But no one could tell her the way to go, and they all said: \"Farther  on, Babouscka, farther on.\" So she traveled on, and on, and on for  years and years--but she never found the little Christ Child.    They say that old Babouscka is traveling still, looking for Him. When  it comes Christmas eve, and the children are lying fast asleep,  Babouscka comes softly through the snowy fields and towns, wrapped in  her long cloak and carrying her basket on her arm. With her staff she  raps gently at the doors and goes inside and holds her candle close to  the little children's faces.    \"Is He here?\" she asks. \"Is the little Christ Child here?\" And then  she turns sorrowfully away again, crying: \"Farther on, farther on.\"  But before she leaves she takes a toy from her basket and lays it  beside the pillow for a Christmas gift. \"For His sake,\" she says  softly and then hurries on through the years and forever in search of  the little Christ Child.

THE BOY WITH THE BOX    By Mary Griggs Van Voorhis      It was an ideal Christmas day. The sun shone brightly but the air was  crisp and cold, and snow and ice lay sparkling everywhere. A light  wind, the night before, had swept the blue, icebound river clean of  scattering snow; and, by two o'clock in the afternoon, the broad bend  near Creighton's mill was fairly alive with skaters. The girls in gay  caps and scarfs, the boys in sweaters and mackinaws of every  conceivable hue, with here and there a plump, matronly figure in a  plush coat or a tiny fellow in scarlet, made a picture of life and  brilliancy worthy of an artist's finest skill.    Tom Reynolds moved in and out among the happy throng, with swift, easy  strokes, his cap on the back of his curly head, and his brown eyes  shining with excitement. Now and again, he glanced down with  pardonable pride, at the brand new skates that twinkled beneath his  feet. \"Jolly Ramblers,\" sure enough \"Jolly Ramblers\" they were! Ever  since Ralph Evans had remarked, with a tantalizing toss of his  handsome head, that \"no game fellow would try to skate on anything but  'Jolly Ramblers,'\" Tom had yearned, with an inexpressible longing, for  a pair of these wonderful skates. And now they were his and the ice  was fine and the Christmas sun was shining!    Tom was rounding the big bend for the fiftieth time, when he saw,  skimming gracefully toward him through the merry crowd, a tall boy in  a fur-trimmed coat, his handsome head proudly erect.    \"That's Ralph Evans now,\" said Tom to himself. \"Just wait till you see  these skates, old boy, and maybe you won't feel so smart!\" And with  slow, cautious strokes, he made his way through laughing boys and  girls to a place just in front of the tall skater, coming toward him  down the broad white way. When Ralph was almost upon him, Tom paused  and in conspicuous silence, looked down at his shining skates.    \"Hullo,\" said Ralph good naturedly, seizing Tom's arm and swinging  around. Then, taking in the situation with a careless glance, he  added, \"Get a new pair of skates for Christmas?\"    \"'Jolly Ramblers,'\" said Tom impressively, \"the best 'Jolly Ramblers'  in the market!\"    Ralph was a full half head the taller, but, as Tom delivered himself  of this speech with his head held high, he felt every inch as tall as  the boy before him.    If Ralph was deeply impressed he failed to show it, as he answered  carelessly, \"Huh, that so? Pretty good"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17774"],[0,"The Poetry of Architecture (#15)"],[1,"forever, unchanging; they become part  of the picture of associations: we endow them with memory, and then feel  them to be possessed of all that is glorious on earth.    For these three reasons, then, the plains of Italy possess far more  elevation of character than her hill scenery. To the northward, this  contrast is felt very strikingly, as the distinction is well marked, the  Alps rising sharply and suddenly. To the southward, the plain is more  mingled with low projecting promontories, and unites almost every kind  of beauty. However, even among her northern lakes, the richness of the  low climate, and the magnificence of form and color presented by the  distant Alps, raise the character of the scene immeasurably above that  of most hill landscapes, even were those natural features entirely  unassisted by associations which, though more sparingly scattered than  in the south, are sufficient to give light to every leaf, and voice to  every wave.]    104. Now, as to the situation of the cottage, we have already seen that  great humility was necessary, both in the building and its site, to  prevent it from offending us by an apparent struggle with forces,  compared with which its strength was dust: but we cannot have this  extreme humility in the villa, the dwelling of wealth and power, and yet  we must not, any more, suggest the idea of its resisting natural  influences under which the Pyramids could not abide. The only way of  solving the difficulty is, to select such sites as shall seem to have  been set aside by nature as places of rest, as points of calm and  enduring beauty, ordained to sit and smile in their glory of quietness,  while the avalanche brands the mountain top,[15] and the torrent  desolates the valley; yet so preserved, not by shelter amidst violence,  but by being placed wholly out of the influence of violence. For in this  they must differ from the site of the cottage, that the peasant may seek  for protection under some low rock or in some narrow dell, but the villa  must have a domain to itself, at once conspicuous, beautiful, and calm.    [Footnote 15: There are two kinds of winter avalanches; the one, sheets  of frozen snow sliding on the surface of others. The swiftness of these,  as the clavendier of the Convent of St. Bernard told me, he could  compare to nothing but that of a cannon ball of equal size. The other is  a rolling mass of snow, accumulating in its descent. This, grazing the  bare hill-side, tears up its surface like dust, bringing away soil,  rock, and vegetation, as a grazing ball tears flesh; and leaving its  withered path distinct on the green hill-side, as if the mountain had  been branded with red-hot iron. They generally keep to the same paths;  but when the snow accumulates, and sends one down the wrong way, it has  been known to cut down a pine forest, as a scythe mows grass. The tale  of its work is well told by the seared and branded marks on the hill  summits and sides.]    105. As regards the form of the cottage, we have seen how the  Westmoreland cottage harmonized with the ease of outline so conspicuous  in hill scenery, by the irregularity of its details; but, here, no such  irregularity is allowable or consistent, and is not even desirable. For  the cottage enhances the wildness of the surrounding scene, by  sympathizing with it; the villa must do the same thing, by contrasting  with it. The eye feels, in a far greater degree, the terror of the  distant and desolate peaks, when it passes down their ravined sides to  sloping and verdant hills, and is guided from these to the rich glow of  vegetable life in the low zones, and through this glow to the tall front  of some noble edifice, peaceful even in its pride. But this contrast  must not be sudden, or it will be startling and harsh; and therefore, as  we saw above, the villa must be placed where all the severe features of  the scene, though not concealed, are distant, and where there is a  graduation, so to speak, of impressions, from terror to loveliness, the  one softened by distance, the other elevated in its style: and the form  of the villa must not be fantastic or angular, but must be full of  variety, so tempered by simplicity as to obtain ease of outline united  with elevation of character; the first being necessary for reasons  before advanced, and the second, that the whole may harmonize with the  feelings induced by the lofty features of the accompanying scenery in  any hill country, and yet more, on the Larian Lake, by the deep memories  and everlasting associations which haunt the stillness of its shore. Of  the color required by Italian landscape we have spoken before, and we  shall see that, particularly in this case, white or pale tones are  agreeable.    106. We shall now proceed to the situation and form of the villa. As  regards situation; the villas of the Lago di Como are built, _par  preference_, either on jutting promontories of low crag covered with  olives, or on those parts of the shore where some mountain stream has  carried out a bank of alluvium into the lake. One object proposed in  this choice of situation is, to catch the breeze as it comes up the main  opening of the hills, and to avoid the reflection of the sun's rays from  the rocks of the actual shore; and another is, to obtain a prospect up  or down the lake, and of the hills on whose projection the villa is  built: but the effect of this choice when the building is considered the  object, is to carry it exactly into the place where it ought to be, far  from the steep precipice and dark mountain, to the border of the winding  bay and citron-scented cape, where it stands at once conspicuous and in  peace. For instance, in the view of Villa Serbelloni[16] from across the  lake, although the eye falls suddenly from the crags above to the  promontory below, yet all the sublime and severe features of the scene  are kept in the distance, and the villa itself is mingled with graceful  lines, and embosomed in rich vegetation. The promontory separates the  Lake of Lecco from that of Como, properly so-called, and is three miles  from the opposite shore, which gives room enough for aerial perspective.    [Footnote 16: [Villa Serbelloni, now the dependence of the Hotel Grande  Bretagne at Bellaggio, and Villa Somma-Riva, now called Villa Carlotta,  at Cadenabbia, and visited by every tourist for its collection of modern  statuary, are both too well known to need illustration by the very poor  wood-cuts which accompanied this chapter in the \"Architectural  Magazine.\" The original drawings are lost; judging from that of the  cottage in Val d'Aosta we may safely believe that they were most  inadequately represented by the old cuts.]]    107. We shall now consider the form of the villa. It is generally the  apex of a series of artificial terraces, which conduct through its  gardens to the water. These are formal in their design, but extensive,  wide, and majestic in their slope, the steps being generally about 1/2  ft. high and 4-1/2 ft. wide (sometimes however much deeper). They are  generally supported by white wall, strengthened by unfilled arches, the  angles being turned by sculptured pedestals, surmounted by statues, or  urns. Along the terraces are carried rows, sometimes of cypress, more  frequently of orange or lemon trees, with myrtles, sweet bay, and aloes,  intermingled, but always with dark and spiry cypresses occurring in  groups; and attached to these terraces, or to the villa itself, are  series of arched grottoes built (or sometimes cut in the rock) for  coolness, frequently overhanging the water, kept dark and fresh, and  altogether delicious to the feelings. A good instance of these united  peculiarities is seen in Villa Somma-Riva, Lago di Como.    The effect of these approaches is disputable. It is displeasing to many,  from its formality; but we are persuaded that it is right, because it is  a national style, and therefore has in all probability due connection  with scene and character: and this connection we shall endeavor to  prove.    108. The frequent occurrence of the arch is always delightful in distant  effect, partly on account of its graceful line, partly because the shade  it casts is varied in depth, becoming deeper and deeper as the grotto  retires, and partly because it gives great apparent elevation to the  walls which it supports. The grottoes themselves are agreeable objects  seen near, because they give an impression of coolness to the eye; and  they echo all sounds with great melody; small streams are often  conducted through them, occasioning slight breezes by their motion. Then  the statue and the urn are graceful in their outline, classical in their  meaning, and correct in their position, for where could they be more  appropriate than here; the one ministering to memory, and the other to  mourning. The terraces themselves are dignified in their character (a  necessary effect, as we saw above), and even the formal rows of trees  are right in this climate, for a peculiar reason. Effect is always to be  considered, in Italy, as if the sun were always to shine, for it does  nine days out of ten. Now the shadows of foliage regularly disposed,  fall with a grace which it is impossible to describe, running up and  down across the marble steps, and casting alternate statues into  darkness; and checkering the white walls with a \"method in their  madness,\" altogether unattainable by loose grouping of trees; and  therefore, for the sake of this kind of shade, to which the eye, as well  as the feeling, is attracted, the long row of cypresses or orange trees  is allowable.    109. But there is a still more important reason for it, of a directly  contrary nature to that which its formality would seem to require. In  all beautiful designs of exterior descent, a certain regularity is  necessary; the lines should be graceful, but they must balance each  other, slope answering to slope, statue to"]]]
