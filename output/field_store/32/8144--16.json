[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19142"],[0,"The Devil Doctor (#15)"],[1," apparitions which I have witnessed.    I know that I was frozen with a sort of supernatural terror. I stood  there, my hands clenched, staring--staring--at that white shape, which  seemed to float.    And as I stared, every nerve in my body thrilling, I distinguished the  outline of the phantom. With a subdued cry, I stepped forward. A new  sensation claimed me. In that one stride I passed from the horrible to  the bizarre.    I found myself confronted with something tangible certainly, but  something whose presence in that place was utterly extravagant--could  only be reconcilable in the dreams of an opium slave.    Was I awake? was I sane? Awake and sane beyond doubt, but surely  moving, not in the purlieus of Limehouse, but in the fantastic realms  of fairyland.    Swooping, with open arms, I rounded up in an angle against the  building and gathered in this screaming thing which had inspired in me  so keen a terror.    The great, ghostly fan was closed as I did so, and I stumbled back  towards the stair with my struggling captive tucked under my arm; I  mounted into one of London's darkest slums, carrying a beautiful white  peacock!          CHAPTER XII    DARK EYES LOOK INTO MINE      My adventure had done nothing to relieve the feeling of unreality  which held me enthralled. Grasping the struggling bird firmly by the  body, and having the long white tail fluttering a yard or so behind  me, I returned to where the taxi waited.    \"Open the door!\" I said to the man--who greeted me with such a stare  of amazement that I laughed outright, though my mirth was but hollow.    He jumped into the road and did as I directed. Making sure that both  windows were closed, I thrust the peacock into the cab and shut the  door upon it.    \"For God's sake, sir--\" began the driver.    \"It has probably escaped from some collector's place on the  riverside,\" I explained, \"but one never knows. See that it does not  escape again, and if at the end of an hour, as arranged, you do not  hear from me, take it back with you to the River Police Station.\"    \"Right you are, sir,\" said the man, remounting his seat. \"It's the  first time I ever saw a peacock in Limehouse!\"    It was the first time _I_ had seen one, and the incident struck me as  being more than odd; it gave me an idea, and a new, faint hope. I  returned to the head of the steps, at the foot of which I had met with  this singular experience, and gazed up at the dark building beneath  which they led. Three windows were visible, but they were broken and  neglected. One, immediately above the arch, had been pasted up with  brown paper, and this was now peeling off in the rain, a little stream  of which trickled down from the detached corner to drop, drearily,  upon the stone stairs beneath.    Where were the detectives? I could only assume that they had directed  their attention elsewhere, for had the place not been utterly  deserted, surely I had been challenged.    In pursuit of my new idea, I again descended the steps. The persuasion  (shortly to be verified) that I was close upon the secret hold of the  Chinaman, grew stronger, unaccountably. I had descended some eight  steps, and was at the darkest part of the archway or tunnel, when  confirmation of my theories came to me.    A noose settled accurately upon my shoulders, was snatched tight about my  throat, and with a feeling of insupportable agony at the base of my skull,  and a sudden supreme knowledge that I was being strangled--hanged--I lost  consciousness!    How long I remained unconscious, I was unable to determine at the  time, but I learned later that it was for no more than half an hour;  at any rate, recovery was slow.    The first sensation to return to me was a sort of repetition of the  asphyxia. The blood seemed to be forcing itself into my eyes--I  choked--I felt that my end was come. And, raising my hands to my  throat, I found it to be swollen and inflamed. Then the floor upon  which I lay seemed to be rocking like the deck of a ship, and I glided  back again into a place of darkness and forgetfulness.    My second awakening was heralded by a returning sense of smell; for I  became conscious of a faint, exquisite perfume.    It brought me to my senses as nothing else could have done, and I sat  upright with a hoarse cry. I could have distinguished that perfume  amid a thousand others, could have marked it apart from the rest in a  scent bazaar. For me it had one meaning, and one meaning  only--Karamaneh.    She was near to me, or had been near to me!    And in the first moments of my awakening I groped about in the  darkness blindly seeking her. Then my swollen throat and throbbing  head, together with my utter inability to move my neck even slightly,  reminded me of the facts as they were. I knew in that bitter moment  that Karamaneh was no longer my friend; but, for all her beauty and  charm, was the most heartless, the most fiendish creature in the  service of Dr. Fu-Manchu. I groaned aloud in my despair and misery.    Something stirred near to me in the room, and set my nerves creeping  with a new apprehension. I became fully alive to the possibilities of  the darkness.    To my certain knowledge, Dr. Fu-Manchu at this time had been in  England for fully three months, which meant that by now he must be  equipped with all the instruments of destruction, animate and  inanimate, which dread experience had taught me to associate with him.    Now, as I crouched there in that dark apartment, listening for a  repetition of the sound, I scarcely dared to conjecture what might  have occasioned it, but my imagination peopled the place with reptiles  which writhed upon the floor, with tarantulas and other deadly insects  which crept upon the walls, which might drop upon me from the ceiling  at any moment.    Then, since nothing stirred about me, I ventured to move, turning my  shoulders, for I was unable to move my aching head; and I looked in  the direction from which a faint, very faint, light proceeded.    A regular tapping sound now began to attract my attention, and, having  turned about, I perceived that behind me was a broken window, in  places patched with brown paper; the corner of one sheet of paper was  detached, and the rain trickled down upon it with a rhythmical sound.    In a flash I realized that I lay in the room immediately above the  archway; and listening intently, I perceived above the other faint  sounds of the night, or thought that I perceived, the hissing of the  gas from the extinguished lamp-burner.    Unsteadily I rose to my feet, but found myself swaying like a drunken  man. I reached out for support, stumbling in the direction of the  wall. My foot came in contact with something that lay there, and I  pitched forward and fell....    I anticipated a crash which would put an end to my hopes of escape,  but my fall was comparatively noiseless--for I fell upon the body of a  man who lay bound up with rope close against the wall!    A moment I stayed as I fell, the chest of my fellow captive rising and  falling beneath me as he breathed. Knowing that my life depended upon  retaining a firm hold upon myself, I succeeded in overcoming the  dizziness and nausea which threatened to drown my senses, and, moving  back so that I knelt upon the floor, I fumbled in my pocket for the  electric lamp which I had placed there. My raincoat had been removed  whilst I was unconscious, and with it my pistol, but the lamp was  untouched.    I took it out, pressed the button, and directed the ray upon the face  of the man beside me.    It was Nayland Smith!    Trussed up and fastened to a ring in the wall he lay, having a cork  gag strapped so tightly between his teeth that I wondered how he had  escaped suffocation.    But although a greyish pallor showed through the tan of his skin, his  eyes were feverishly bright, and there, as I knelt beside him, I  thanked Heaven silently, but fervently.    Then, in furious haste, I set to work to remove the gag. It was most  ingeniously secured by means of leather straps buckled at the back of  his head, but I unfastened these without much difficulty, and he spat  out the gag, uttering an exclamation of disgust.    \"Thank God, old man!\" he said huskily. \"Thank God that you are alive!  I saw them drag you in, and I thought....\"    \"I have been thinking the same about you for more than twenty-four  hours,\" I said reproachfully. \"Why did you start without--?\"    \"I did not want you to come, Petrie,\" he replied. \"I had a sort of  premonition. You see it was realized; and instead of being as helpless  as I, Fate has made you the instrument of my release. Quick! You have  a knife? Good!\" The old, feverish energy was by no means extinguished  in him. \"Cut the ropes about my wrists and ankles, but don't otherwise  disturb them.\"    I set to work eagerly.    \"Now,\" Smith continued, \"put that filthy gag in place again--but you  need not strap it so tightly! Directly they find that you are alive,  they will treat you the same--you understand? She has been here three  times--\"    \"Karamaneh?...\"    \"_Ssh_!\"    I heard a sound like the opening of a distant door.    \"Quick! the straps of the gag!\" whispered Smith, \"and pretend to  recover consciousness just as they enter--\"    Clumsily I followed his directions, for my fingers were none too  steady, replaced the lamp in my pocket, and threw myself upon the  floor.    Through half-shut eyes, I saw the door open and obtained a glimpse of  a desolate, empty passage beyond. On the threshold stood Karamaneh.  She held in her hand a common tin oil lamp which smoked and flickered  with every movement, filling the already none too cleanly air with an  odour of burning paraffin.    She personified the _outre_; nothing so incongruous as her presence in  that place could well be imagined. She was dressed as I remembered  once to have seen her two years before, in the gauzy silks of the  harem.

So now the village will  make offerings to Lurgha and beg his favor, and the Mother will no more  have those to harken to her words and offer her the first fruits----\"    \"But from whence came this bird which was Lurgha, can you tell me that,  she who waits upon the Mother?\"    \"What difference does it make from what direction Lurgha came? That does  not add nor take from his power.\" Cassca moved beneath the arch. \"Or  does it in some strange way, Assha?\"    \"Perhaps it does. Only tell me.\"    She turned slowly and pointed over her right shoulder. \"From that way he  came, Assha. Well did I watch, knowing that I was the Mother's and that  even Lurgha's thunderbolts could not eat me up. Does knowing that make  Lurgha smaller in your eyes, Assha? When he has eaten up all that is  yours and your kin with it?\"    \"Perhaps,\" Assha repeated. \"I do not think Lurgha will come so again.\"    She shrugged, and the heavy cloak flapped. \"That shall be as it shall  be, Assha. Now go, for it is not good that any man come hither.\"    Cassca paced back into the heart of the green tunnel, and Ross and  McNeil came out of concealment. McNeil faced in the direction she had  pointed. \"Northeast--\" he commented thoughtfully, \"the Baltic lies in  that quarter.\"          CHAPTER 8      \"... and that is about all.\" Ten days later Ashe, a dressing on his leg  and a few of the pain lines smoothed from his face, sat on a bunk in the  arctic time post nursing a mug of coffee in his hands and smiling, a  little crookedly, at Nelson Millaird.    Millaird, Kelgarries, Dr. Webb, all the top brass of the project had not  only come through the transfer point to meet the three from Britain but  were now crammed into the room, nearly pushing Ross and McNeil through  the wall. Because this was it! What they had hunted for  months--years--now lay almost within their grasp.    Only Millaird, the director, did not seem so confident. A big man with a  bushy thatch of coarse graying hair and a heavy, fleshy face, he did not  look like a brain. Yet Ross had been on the roster long enough to know  that it was Millaird's thick and hairy hands that gathered together all  the loose threads of Operation Retrograde and deftly wove them into a  workable pattern. Now the director leaned back in a chair which was too  small for his bulk, chewing thoughtfully on a toothpick.    \"So we have the first whiff of a trail,\" he commented without elation.    \"A pretty strong lead!\" Kelgarries broke in. Too excited to sit still,  the major stood with his back against the door, as alert as if he were  about to turn and face the enemy. \"The Reds wouldn't have moved against  Gog if they did not consider it a menace to them. Their big base must be  in this time sector!\"    \"_A_ big base,\" Millaird corrected. \"The one we are after, no. And right  now they may be switching times. Do you think they will sit here and  wait for us to show up in force?\" But Millaird's tone, intended to  deflate, had no effect on the major.    \"And just how long would it take them to dismantle a big base?\" that  officer countered. \"At least a month. If we shoot a team in there in a  hurry--\"    Millaird folded his huge hands over his barrel-shaped body and laughed,  without a trace of humor. \"Just where do we send that team, Kelgarries?  Northeast of a coastal point in Britain is a rather vague direction, to  say the least. Not,\" he spoke to Ashe now, \"that you didn't do all you  could, Ashe. And you, McNeil, nothing to add?\"    \"No, sir. They jumped us out of the blue when Sandy thought he had every  possible line tapped, every safeguard working. I don't know how they  caught on to us, unless they located our beam to this post. If so, they  must have been deliberately hunting us for some time, because we only  used the beam as scheduled----\"    \"The Reds have patience and brains and probably some more of their  surprise gadgets to help them. We have the patience and the brains, but  not the gadgets. And time is against us. Get anything out of this,  Webb?\" Millaird asked the hitherto silent third member of his ruling  committee.    The quiet man adjusted his glasses on the bridge of his nose, a  flattish nose which did not support them very well. \"Just another point  to add to our surmises. I would say that they are located somewhere near  the Baltic Sea. There are old trade routes there, and in our own time it  is a territory closed to us. We never did know too much about that  section of Europe. Their installation may be close to the Finnish  border. They could disguise their modern station under half a dozen  covers; that is strange country.\"    Millaird's hands unfolded and he produced a notebook and pen from a  shirt pocket. \"Won't hurt to stir up some of the present-day agents of  the M.I. and the rest. They might just come up with a useful hint. So  you'd say the Baltic. But that is a big slice of country.\"    Webb nodded. \"We have one advantage--the old trade routes. In the Beaker  period they are pretty well marked. The major one into that section was  established for the amber trade. The country is forested, but not so  heavily as it was in an earlier period. The native tribes are mostly  roving hunters, and fishermen along the coast. But they have had contact  with traders.\" He shoved his glasses back into place with a nervous  gesture. \"The Reds may run into trouble themselves there at this  time----\"    \"How?\" Kelgarries demanded.    \"Invasion of the ax people. If they have not yet arrived, they are due  very soon. They formed one of the big waves of migratory people, who  flooded the country, settled there. Eventually they became the Norse or  Celtic stock. We don't know whether they stamped out the native tribes  they found there or assimilated them.\"    \"That might be a nice point to have settled more definitely,\" McNeil  commented. \"It could mean the difference between getting your skull  split and continuing to breathe.\"    \"I don't think they would tangle with the traders. Evidence found today  suggests that the Beaker folk simply went on about their business in  spite of a change in customers,\" Webb returned.    \"Unless they were pushed into violence.\" Ashe handed his empty mug to  Ross. \"Don't forget Lurgha's Wrath. From now on our enemies might take a  very dim view of any Beaker trade posts near their property.\"    Webb shook his head slowly. \"A wholesale attack on Beaker establishments  would constitute a shift in history. The Reds won't dare that, not just  on general suspicion. Remember, they are not any more eager to tinker  with history than we are. No, they will watch for us. We will have to  stop communication by radio----\"    \"We can't!\" snapped Millaird vehemently. \"We can cut it down, but I  won't send the boys out without some means of quick communication. You  lab boys put your brains to work and see what you can turn out in the  way of talk boxes that they can't snoop. Time!\" He drummed on his knee  with his thick fingers. \"It all comes back to a question of time.\"    \"Which we do not have,\" Ashe observed in his usual quiet voice. \"If the  Reds are afraid they have been spotted, they must be dismantling their  post right now, working around the clock. We'll never again have such a  good chance to nail them. We must move now.\"    Millaird's lids drooped almost shut; he might have been napping.  Kelgarries stirred restlessly by the door, and Webb's round face had  settled into what looked like permanent lines of disapproval.    \"Doc,\" Millaird spoke over his shoulder to the fourth man of his  following, \"what is your report?\"    \"Ashe must be under treatment for at least five days. McNeil's burns  aren't too bad, and Murdock's slash is almost healed.\"    \"Five days--\" Millaird droned, and then flashed a glance at the major.  \"Personnel. We're tied down without any useful personnel. Who in  processing could be switched without tangling them up entirely?\"    \"No one. I can recall Jansen and Van Wyke. These ax people might be a  good cover for them.\" The momentary light in Kelgarries' eyes faded.  \"No, we have no proper briefing and can't get it until the tribe does  appear on the map. I won't send any men in cold. Their blunders would  not only endanger them but might menace the whole project.\"    \"So that leaves us with you three,\" Millaird said. \"We'll recall what  men we can and brief them again as fast as possible. But you know how  long that will take. In the meantime----\"    Ashe spoke directly to Webb. \"You can't pinpoint the region closer than  just the Baltic?\"    \"We can do this much,\" the other answered him slowly, and with obvious  reluctance. \"We can send the sub cruising offshore there for the next  five days. If there is any radio activity--any communication--we should  be able to trace the beams. It all depends upon whether the Reds have  any parties operating from their post. Flimsy----\"    \"But something!\" Kelgarries seized upon it with the relief of one who  needed action.    \"And they will be waiting for just such a move on our part,\" Webb  continued deliberately.    \"All right, so they'll be watching!\" the major said, about to lose his  temper, \"but it is about the only move we can make to back up the boys  when they do go in.\"    He whipped around the door and was gone. Webb got up slowly. \"I will  work over the maps again,\" he told Ashe. \"We haven't scouted that area,  and we don't dare send a photo-plane over it now. Any trip in will be a  stab in the dark.\"    \"When you have only one road, you take it,\" Ashe replied. \"I'll be glad  to see anything you can show me, Miles.\"    If Ross had believed that his pre-trial-run cramming had been a rigorous  business, he was soon to laugh at that estimation. Since the burden of  the next jump would rest on only three of them--Ashe, McNeil, and  himself--they were plunged into a whirlwind of instruction, until Ross,  dazed and too"]]]
