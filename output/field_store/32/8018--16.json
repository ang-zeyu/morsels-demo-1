Here are maps on a  large scale by which you may follow it.  The saloon is at your  disposal, and, with your permission, I will retire.\"  Captain Nemo  bowed, and I remained alone, lost in thoughts all bearing on the  commander of the Nautilus.    For a whole hour was I deep in these reflections, seeking to pierce  this mystery so interesting to me.  Then my eyes fell upon the vast  planisphere spread upon the table, and I placed my finger on the very  spot where the given latitude and longitude crossed.    The sea has its large rivers like the continents.  They are special  currents known by their temperature and their colour.  The most  remarkable of these is known by the name of the Gulf Stream.  Science  has decided on the globe the direction of five principal currents: one  in the North Atlantic, a second in the South, a third in the North  Pacific, a fourth in the South, and a fifth in the Southern Indian  Ocean.  It is even probable that a sixth current existed at one time or  another in the Northern Indian Ocean, when the Caspian and Aral Seas  formed but one vast sheet of water.    At this point indicated on the planisphere one of these currents was  rolling, the Kuro-Scivo of the Japanese, the Black River, which,  leaving the Gulf of Bengal, where it is warmed by the perpendicular  rays of a tropical sun, crosses the Straits of Malacca along the coast  of Asia, turns into the North Pacific to the Aleutian Islands, carrying  with it trunks of camphor-trees and other indigenous productions, and  edging the waves of the ocean with the pure indigo of its warm water.  It was this current that the Nautilus was to follow.  I followed it  with my eye; saw it lose itself in the vastness of the Pacific, and  felt myself drawn with it, when Ned Land and Conseil appeared at the  door of the saloon.    My two brave companions remained petrified at the sight of the wonders  spread before them.    \"Where are we, where are we?\" exclaimed the Canadian.  \"In the museum  at Quebec?\"    \"My friends,\" I answered, making a sign for them to enter, \"you are not  in Canada, but on board the Nautilus, fifty yards below the level of  the sea.\"    \"But, M. Aronnax,\" said Ned Land, \"can you tell me how many men there  are on board?  Ten, twenty, fifty, a hundred?\"    \"I cannot answer you, Mr. Land; it is better to abandon for a time all  idea of seizing the Nautilus or escaping from it.  This ship is a  masterpiece of modern industry, and I should be sorry not to have seen  it.  Many people would accept the situation forced upon us, if only to  move amongst such wonders.  So be quiet and let us try and see what  passes around us.\"    \"See!\" exclaimed the harpooner, \"but we can see nothing in this iron  prison!  We are walking--we are sailing--blindly.\"    Ned Land had scarcely pronounced these words when all was suddenly  darkness.  The luminous ceiling was gone, and so rapidly that my eyes  received a painful impression.    We remained mute, not stirring, and not knowing what surprise awaited  us, whether agreeable or disagreeable.  A sliding noise was heard: one  would have said that panels were working at the sides of the Nautilus.    \"It is the end of the end!\" said Ned Land.    Suddenly light broke at each side of the saloon, through two oblong  openings.  The liquid mass appeared vividly lit up by the electric  gleam.  Two crystal plates separated us from the sea.  At first I  trembled at the thought that this frail partition might break, but  strong bands of copper bound them, giving an almost infinite power of  resistance.    The sea was distinctly visible for a mile all round the Nautilus.  What  a spectacle!  What pen can describe it?  Who could paint the effects of  the light through those transparent sheets of water, and the softness  of the successive gradations from the lower to the superior strata of  the ocean?    We know the transparency of the sea and that its clearness is far  beyond that of rock-water. The mineral and organic substances which it  holds in suspension heightens its transparency.  In certain parts of  the ocean at the Antilles, under seventy-five fathoms of water, can be  seen with surprising clearness a bed of sand.  The penetrating power of  the solar rays does not seem to cease for a depth of one hundred and  fifty fathoms.  But in this middle fluid travelled over by the  Nautilus, the electric brightness was produced even in the bosom of the  waves.  It was no longer luminous water, but liquid light.    On each side a window opened into this unexplored abyss.  The obscurity  of the saloon showed to advantage the brightness outside, and we looked  out as if this pure crystal had been the glass of an immense aquarium.    \"You wished to see, friend Ned; well, you see now.\"    \"Curious! curious!\" muttered the Canadian, who, forgetting his  ill-temper, seemed to submit to some irresistible attraction; \"and one  would come further than this to admire such a sight!\"    \"Ah!\" thought I to myself, \"I understand the life of this man; he has  made a world apart for himself, in which he treasures all his greatest  wonders.\"    For two whole hours an aquatic army escorted the Nautilus.  During  their games, their bounds, while rivalling each other in beauty,  brightness, and velocity, I distinguished the green labre; the banded  mullet, marked by a double line of black; the round-tailed goby, of a  white colour, with violet spots on the back; the Japanese scombrus, a  beautiful mackerel of these seas, with a blue body and silvery head;  the brilliant azurors, whose name alone defies description; some banded  spares, with variegated fins of blue and yellow; the woodcocks of the  seas, some specimens of which attain a yard in length; Japanese  salamanders, spider lampreys, serpents six feet long, with eyes small  and lively, and a huge mouth bristling with teeth; with many other  species.    Our imagination was kept at its height, interjections followed quickly  on each other.  Ned named the fish, and Conseil classed them.  I was in  ecstasies with the vivacity of their movements and the beauty of their  forms.  Never had it been given to me to surprise these animals, alive  and at liberty, in their natural element.  I will not mention all the  varieties which passed before my dazzled eyes, all the collection of  the seas of China and Japan.  These fish, more numerous than the birds  of the air, came, attracted, no doubt, by the brilliant focus of the  electric light.    Suddenly there was daylight in the saloon, the iron panels closed  again, and the enchanting vision disappeared.  But for a long time I  dreamt on, till my eyes fell on the instruments hanging on the  partition.  The compass still showed the course to be E.N.E., the  manometer indicated a pressure of five atmospheres, equivalent to a  depth of twenty five fathoms, and the electric log gave a speed of  fifteen miles an hour.  I expected Captain Nemo, but he did not appear.  The clock marked the hour of five.    Ned Land and Conseil returned to their cabin, and I retired to my  chamber.  My dinner was ready.  It was composed of turtle soup made of  the most delicate hawks bills, of a surmullet served with puff paste  (the liver of which, prepared by itself, was most delicious), and  fillets of the emperor-holocanthus, the savour of which seemed to me  superior even to salmon.    I passed the evening reading, writing, and thinking.  Then sleep  overpowered me, and I stretched myself on my couch of zostera, and  slept profoundly, whilst the Nautilus was gliding rapidly through the  current of the Black River.        CHAPTER XIV    A NOTE OF INVITATION    The next day was the 9th of November.  I awoke after a long sleep of  twelve hours.  Conseil came, according to custom, to know \"how I passed  the night,\" and to offer his services.  He had left his friend the  Canadian sleeping like a man who had never done anything else all his  life.  I let the worthy fellow chatter as he pleased, without caring to  answer him.  I was preoccupied by the absence of the Captain during our  sitting of the day before, and hoping to see him to-day.    As soon as I was dressed I went into the saloon.  It was deserted.  I  plunged into the study of the shell treasures hidden behind the glasses.    The whole day passed without my being honoured by a visit from Captain  Nemo.  The panels of the saloon did not open.  Perhaps they did not  wish us to tire of these beautiful things.    The course of the Nautilus was E.N.E., her speed twelve knots, the  depth below the surface between twenty-five and thirty fathoms.    The next day, 10th of November, the same desertion, the same solitude.  I did not see one of the ship's crew: Ned and Conseil spent the greater  part of the day with me.  They were astonished at the puzzling absence  of the Captain.  Was this singular man ill?--had he altered his  intentions with regard to us?    After all, as Conseil said, we enjoyed perfect liberty, we were  delicately and abundantly fed.  Our host kept to his terms of the  treaty.  We could not complain, and, indeed, the singularity of our  fate reserved such wonderful compensation for us that we had no right  to accuse it as yet.    That day I commenced the journal of these adventures which has enabled  me to relate them with more scrupulous exactitude and minute detail.    11th November, early in the morning.  The fresh air spreading over the  interior of the Nautilus told me that we had come to the surface of the  ocean to renew our supply of oxygen.  I directed my steps to the  central staircase, and mounted the platform.    It was six o'clock, the weather was cloudy, the sea grey,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16410"],[0,"The Life-Story of Insects (#15)"],[1,"through a complete transformation. These two  considerations, taken together, suggest strongly that in the evolution  of the insect class, the simpler life-history preceded the more complex.  Such a conclusion seems reasonable and what might have been expected,  but we are confronted with the difficulty that if the most highly  organised insects pass through the most profound transformations, then  insects present a remarkable and puzzling exception to the general rules  of development among animals, as has already been pointed out in the  first chapter of this volume (p. 7). A few students of insect  transformation have indeed supposed that the crawling caterpillar or  maggot must be regarded as a larval stage which recalls the worm-like  nature of the supposed far-off ancestors of insects generally. Even in  Poulton's classical memoir (1891, p. 190), this view finds some support,  and it may be hard to give up the seductive idea that the worm-like  insect-larva has some phylogenetic meaning. But the weight of evidence,  when we take a comprehensive survey of the life-story of insects, must  be pronounced to be strongly in favour of the view put forward by Brauer  (1869), and since supported by the great majority of naturalists who  have discussed the subject, that the caterpillar or the maggot is itself  a specialised product of the evolutionary process, adapted to its own  particular mode of larval life.    The explanation of insect transformation is, in brief, to be found in an  increasing amount of divergence between larva and imago. The most  profound metamorphosis is but a special type of growth, accompanied by  successive castings and renewings of the chitinous cuticle, which  envelopes all arthropods. In the simplest type of insect life-story,  there is no marked difference in form between the newly-hatched young  and the adult, and in such cases we find that the young insect lives in  the same way as the adult, has the same surroundings, eats the same  food. This is the rule (see Chapters II and III) with the Apterygota,  the Orthoptera, and most of the Hemiptera. In the last-named order,  however, we find in certain families marked divergence between larva and  imago, for example in the cicads, whose larvae live underground, while  in the coccids, whose males are highly specialised and females degraded,  there succeeds to the larva--very like the young stage in allied  families--a resting instar, which in the case of the male, suggests  comparison with the pupa of a moth or beetle.    Turning to the stone-flies, dragon-flies and may-flies, whose  life-stories have been sketched in Chapter IV, we find that the early  stages are passed in water, whence before the final moult, the insects  emerge to the upper air. Except for the possession of tufted gills,  adapting them to an aquatic life, the stone-fly nymphs differ but  slightly from the adults; the grubs of the dragon-flies and may-flies,  however, are markedly different from their parents. In connection with  these comparisons, it is to be noted that the dragon-flies and may-flies  are more highly specialised insects than stone-flies, divergent  specialisation of the adult and larva is therefore well illustrated in  these groups, which nevertheless have, like the Hemiptera and  Orthoptera, visible external wing-rudiments.    From the vast array of insects that show internal wing-growth and a true  pupal stage, a few larval types were chosen for description in Chapter  VI, and a review of these suggests again the thought of increasing  divergence between larva and imago. Reference has been made previously  to the many instances in which the former has become pre-eminently the  feeding, and the latter the breeding stage in the life-cycle. It seems  impossible to avoid the conclusion that the active, armoured  campodeiform grub differing less from its parent than an eruciform larva  differs from its parent, is as a larval type more primitive than the  caterpillar or maggot. A. Lameere has indeed, while admitting the  adaptive character of insect larvae generally, argued (1899) with much  ingenuity that the eruciform or vermiform type must have been primitive  among the Endopterygota, believing that the original environment of the  larvae of the ancestral stock of all these insects must have been the  interior of plant tissues. He is thus forced to the necessity of  suggesting that the campodeiform larvae of ground-beetles or lacewings  must be regarded as due to secondarily acquired adaptations; 'they  resemble Thysanura and the larvae of Heterometabola only as whales  resemble fishes.' There are two considerations which render these  theories untenable. The Neuroptera and Coleoptera among which  campodeiform larvae are common, are less specialised than Lepidoptera,  Hymenoptera, and Diptera, in which they are unknown. And among the  Coleoptera which as we have seen (pp. 50 _f._) display a most  interesting variety of larval structure, the legless, eruciform larva  characterises families in which the imago shows the greatest  specialisation, while in the same life-story, as in the case of the  oil-beetles (pp. 56-7), the newly-hatched grub may be campodeiform,  changing to the eruciform type as soon as it finds itself within reach  of its host's rich store of food.    A certain amount of difficulty may be felt with regard to the theory of  divergent evolution between imago and larva, in the case of those  insects with complete transformation whose grubs and adults live in much  the same conditions. By turning over stones the naturalist may find  ground-beetles in company with the larvae of their own species. On the  leaves of a willow tree he may observe leaf-beetles (Phyllodecta and  Galerucella) together with their grubs, all greedily eating the foliage;  or lady-bird beetles (Coccinella) and their larvae hunting and devouring  the 'greenfly.' All of these insects are, however, Coleoptera, and the  adult insects of this order are much more disposed to walk and crawl and  less disposed to fly than other endopterygote insects. Their heavily  armoured bodies and their firm shield-like forewings render them less  aerial than other insects; in many genera the power of flight has been  altogether lost. It is not surprising, therefore, that many beetles,  even when adult, should live as their larvae do; since the acquirement  of complete metamorphosis they have become modified towards the larval  condition, and an extreme case of such modification is afforded by the  wingless grub-like female Glow-worm (Lampyris).    With most insects, however, the larva must be regarded as the more  specially modified, even if degraded, stage. Miall (1895) has pointed  out that the insect grub is not a precociously hatched embryo, like the  larvae of multitudes of marine animals, but that it exhibits in a  modified form the essential characters of the adult. Comparison for  example can be readily made between the parts of the caterpillar and the  butterfly, whose story was sketched in the first chapter of this book,  widely different though caterpillar and butterfly may appear at a  superficial glance. And the survey of variety in form, food, and habit  of insect larvae given in Chapter VI enforces surely the conclusion that  the larva is eminently plastic, adaptable, capable of changing so as to  suit the most diverse surroundings. In a most suggestive recent  discussion on the transformation of insects P. Deegener (1909) has  claimed that the larva must be regarded as the more modified stage,  because while all the adult's structures are represented in the larva,  even if only as imaginal buds, there are commonly present in the larva  special adaptive organs not found in the imago, for example the pro-legs  of caterpillars or the skin-gills of midge-grubs. The correspondence of  parts in butterfly and caterpillar just referred to, may still be  traced, though less easily, in bluebottle and maggot. The latter is an  extreme example of degenerative evolution, and its contrast with the  elaborately organised two-winged fly marks the greatest divergence  observable between the larva and imago. With this divergence the resting  pupal stage, during which more or less dissolution and reconstruction of  organs goes on, becomes a necessity, and it has already been pointed out  how the amount of this reconstruction is greatest where the divergence  between the larval and perfect stages is most marked. Whatever  differences of opinion may prevail on points of detail, the general  explanation of insect metamorphosis as the result of divergent evolution  in the two active stages of the life-story must assuredly be accepted.  No other explanation accords with the increasing degree of divergence to  be observed as we pass from the lower to the higher insect orders.    The successive incidents of the life-story of most insects are largely  connected with the acquisition of wings. Wings, and the power of flight  wherewith they endow their possessors, are evidently beneficial to the  race in giving power of extending the range during the breeding period  and thus ensuring a wide distribution of the eggs. In no case are wings  fully developed until the closing stage of the insect's life, they are  always acquired after hatching or birth. We have already noticed (p. 40)  how Sharp (1899) has laid stress on the essential difference between the  exopterygote and endopterygote insects, the wing-rudiments of the former  growing outwards throughout life while those of the latter remain hidden  until the pupal instar. Sharp considers that there is some difficulty in  bridging, in thought, the gap between these two methods of wing-growth,  and has put forward an ingenious suggestion to meet it (1902). Reference  has already been made to insects of various orders in which one sex is  wingless, the Vapourer Moth (p. 96) for example, or all the individuals  of both sexes are wingless, as the"]]]
