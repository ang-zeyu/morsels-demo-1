General precautions against taking cold are almost self-evident in this  light. There is ordinarily little if any danger to be apprehended from  wet clothes, so long as exercise is kept up; for the \"glow\" about  compensates for the extra cooling by evaporation. Nor is a complete  drenching more likely to be injurious than wetting of one part. But  never sit still wet, and in changing rub the body dry. There is a  general tendency, springing from fatigue, indolence, or indifference, to  neglect damp feet,--that is to say, to dry them by the fire; but this  process is tedious and uncertain. I would say especially, \"Off with  muddy boots and sodden socks at once:\" dry stockings and slippers after  a hunt may make just the difference of your being able to go out again,  or never. Take care never to check perspiration: during this process the  body is in a somewhat critical condition, and the sudden arrest of the  function may result disastrously, even fatally. One part of the business  of perspiration is to equalize bodily temperature, and it must not be  interfered with. The secret of much that is said about _bathing_ when  heated lies here. A person overheated, panting it may be, with  throbbing temples and a _dry_ skin, is in danger partly because the  natural cooling by evaporation from the skin is denied; and this  condition is sometimes not far from a \"sunstroke.\" Under these  circumstances, a person of fairly good constitution may plunge into the  water with impunity, even with benefit. But, if the body be already  cooling by sweating, rapid abstraction of heat from the surface may  cause internal congestion, never unattended with danger.    Drinking ice-water offers a somewhat parallel case; even on stopping to  drink at the brook, when flushed with heat, it is well to bathe the face  and hands first, and to taste the water before a full draught. It is a  well-known excellent rule, not to bathe immediately after a full meal;  because during digestion the organs concerned are comparatively engorged  and any sudden disturbance of the circulation may be disastrous.    The imperative necessity of resisting drowsiness under extreme cold  requires no comment.    In walking under a hot sun, the head may be sensibly protected by green  leaves or grass in the hat; they may be advantageously moistened, but  not enough to drip about the ears. Under such circumstances the  slightest giddiness, dimness of sight, or confusion of ideas, should be  taken as a warning of possible sunstroke, instantly demanding rest, and  shelter if practicable.      HUNGER AND FATIGUE    are more closely related than they might seem to be: one is a sign that  the fuel is out, and the other asks for it. Extreme fatigue, indeed,  destroys appetite: this simply means temporary incapacity for digestion.  But, even far short of this, food is more easily digested and better  relished after a little preparation of the furnace. On coming home tired  it is much better to make a leisurely and reasonably nice toilet, than  to eat at once, or to lie still thinking how tired you are; after a  change and a wash you feel like a \"new man,\" and go to the table in  capital state. Whatever dietetic irregularities a high state of  civilization may demand or render practicable, a normally healthy person  is inconvenienced almost as soon as his regular mealtime passes without  food; and few can work comfortably or profitably fasting over six or  eight hours. Eat before starting; if for a day's tramp, take a lunch;  the most frugal meal will appease if it do not satisfy hunger, and so  postpone its urgency. As a small scrap of practical wisdom, I would add,  Keep the remnants of the lunch if there be any; for you cannot always be  sure of getting in to supper.      STIMULATION.    When cold, fatigued, depressed in mind, and on other occasions, you may  feel inclined to resort to artificial stimulus. Respecting this  many-sided theme I have a few words to offer--of direct bearing on the  collector's case. It should be clearly understood, in the first place,  that a stimulant confers no strength whatever: it simply calls the  powers that be into increased action, at their own expense. Seeking real  strength in stimulus is as wise as an attempt to lift yourself up by  your boot-straps. You may gather yourself to leap the ditch, and you  clear it; but no such muscular energy can be sustained: exhaustion  speedily renders further expenditure impossible. But now suppose a very  powerful mental impression be made, say the circumstance of a succession  of ditches in front, and a mad dog behind: if the stimulus of terror be  sufficiently strong, you may leap on till you drop senseless. Alcoholic  stimulus is a parallel case, and is not seldom pushed to the same  extreme. Under its influence you never can tell when you _are_ tired;  the expenditure goes on, indeed, with unnatural rapidity, only it is not  felt at the time; but the upshot is, you have all the original fatigue  to endure and to recover from, _plus_ the fatigue resulting from  over-excitation of the system. Taken as a fortification against cold,  alcohol is as unsatisfactory as a remedy for fatigue. Insensibility to  cold does not imply protection. The fact is, the exposure is greater  than before; the circulation and respiration being hurried, the waste is  greater; and, as sound fuel cannot be immediately supplied, the  temperature of the body is soon lowered. The transient warmth and glow  over the system has both cold _and_ depression to endure. There is no  use in borrowing from yourself, and fancying you are richer.    Secondly, the value of any stimulus (except in a few exigencies of  disease or injury) is in proportion, not to the intensity, but to the  equableness and durability, of its effect. This is one reason why tea,  coffee, and articles of corresponding qualities, are preferable to  alcoholic drinks: they work so smoothly that their effect is often  unnoticed, and they \"stay by\" well. The friction of alcohol is  tremendous in comparison. A glass of grog may help a veteran over the  fence; but no one, young or old, can shoot all day on whiskey.    I have had so much experience in the use of tobacco as a mild stimulant,  that I am probably no impartial judge of its merits. I will simply say,  I do not use it in the field, because it indisposes to muscular  activity, and favors reflection when observation is required; and  because temporary abstinence provokes the morbid appetite, and renders  the weed more grateful afterwards.    Thirdly, undue excitation of any physical function is followed by a  corresponding depression, on the simple principle that action and  reaction are equal; and the balance of health turns too easily to be  wilfully disturbed. Stimulation is a draft upon vital capital, when  interest alone should suffice: it may be needed at times to bridge a  chasm; but habitual living beyond vital income infallibly entails  bankruptcy in health. The use of alcohol in health seems practically  restricted to purposes of sensuous gratification on the part of those  prepared to pay a round price for this luxury. The three golden rules  here are,--Never drink before breakfast; never drink alone; and never  drink bad liquor. Their observance may make even the abuse of alcohol  tolerable. Serious objections, for a naturalist at least, are that  science, viewed through a glass, seems distant and uncertain, while the  joys of rum are immediate and unquestionable; and that intemperance,  being an attempt to defy certain physical laws, is therefore eminently  unscientific.           *       *       *       *       *    Besides the above good advice by Dr. Coues, the following may prove  useful to the camper:--    Diarrhoea may result from overwork and gluttony combined, and from  eating indigestible or uncooked food, and from imperfect protection of  the stomach. \"Remove the cause, and the effect will cease.\" A flannel  bandage six to twelve inches wide, worn around the stomach, is good as a  preventive and cure.    The same causes may produce cholera morbus; symptoms, violent vomiting  and purging, faintness, and spasms in the arms and limbs. Unless  accompanied with cramp (which is not usual), nature will work its own  cure. Give warm drinks if you have them. Do not get frightened, but keep  the patient warm, and well protected from a draught of air.    The liability to costiveness, and the remedies therefor, are noted on  p. 55 of this book.    A very rare occurrence, but a constant dread with some people, is an  insect crawling into the ear. If you have oil, spirits of turpentine, or  alcoholic liquor at hand, fill the ear at once. If you have not these,  use coffee, tea, warm water (not too hot), or almost any liquid which is  not hurtful to the skin.      MARSHALL HALL'S READY METHOD IN SUFFOCATION, DROWNING, ETC.    1st, Treat the patient _instantly on the spot_, in the _open air_,  freely exposing the face, neck, and chest to the breeze, except in  severe weather.    2d, In order _to clear the throat_, place the patient gently on the  face, with one wrist under the forehead, that all fluid, and the tongue  itself, may fall forward, and leave the entrance into the windpipe free.    3d, _To excite respiration_, turn the patient slightly on his side, and  apply some irritating or stimulating agent to the nostrils, as  _veratrine_, _dilute ammonia_, &c.    4th, Make the face warm by brisk friction; then dash cold water upon it.    5th, If not successful, lose no time; but, _to imitate respiration_,  place the patient on his face, and turn the body gently but completely  _on the side and a little beyond_, then again on the face, and so on  alternately. Repeat these movements deliberately and perseveringly,  _fifteen times only_ in a minute.

You will  be more careful another time.\"    It is needless to say how the devotion of his men was nourished by such  anecdotes as these flying ever and anon from column to column. Next  morning there ensued a hot skirmish, recorded as the battle of St.  George. Provera was compelled to retreat, and Wurmser, who had sallied  out and seized the causeway and citadel of La Favorita, was fain to  retreat within its old walls, in consequence of a desperate assault  headed by Napoleon in person.    Provera now found himself entirely cut off from Alvinzi, and surrounded  with the French. He and 5000 men laid down their arms on the 16th of  January. Various bodies of the Austrian force, scattered over the  country between the Adige and the Brenta, followed the example;[14] and  the brave Wurmser, whose provisions were by this time exhausted, found  himself at length under the necessity of sending an offer of  capitulation.    General Serrurier, as commander of the blockade, received Klenau, the  bearer of Wurmser's message, and heard him state, with the pardonable  artifice usual on such occasions, that his master was still in a  condition to hold out considerably longer, unless honourable terms were  granted. Napoleon had hitherto been seated in a corner of the tent  wrapped in his cloak; he now advanced to the Austrian, who had no  suspicion in whose presence he had been speaking, and taking his pen,  wrote down the conditions which he was willing to grant. \"These,\" said  he, \"are the terms to which your general's bravery entitles him. He may  have them to-day; a week, a month hence, he shall have no worse.  Meantime, tell him that General Buonaparte is about to set out for  Rome.\" The envoy now recognised Napoleon; and on reading the paper  perceived that the proposed terms were more liberal than he had dared to  hope for. The capitulation was forthwith signed.    On the 2nd of February, Wurmser and his garrison marched out of Mantua;  but when the aged chief was to surrender his sword, he found only  Serrurier ready to receive it. Napoleon's generosity, in avoiding being  present personally to witness the humiliation of this distinguished  veteran, forms one of the most pleasing traits in his story. The  Directory had urged him to far different conduct. He treated their  suggestions with scorn: \"I have granted the Austrian,\" he wrote to them,  \"such terms as were, in my judgment, due to a brave and honourable  enemy, and to the dignity of the French Republic.\"    The loss of the Austrians at Mantua amounted, first and last, to not  less than 27,000 men. Besides innumerable military stores, upwards of  500 brass cannon fell into the hands of the conqueror; and Augereau was  sent to Paris, to present the Directory with _sixty_ stands of colours.  He was received with tumults of exultation, such as might have been  expected, on an occasion so glorious, from a people less vivacious than  the French.    The surrender of Provera and Wurmser, following the total rout of  Alvinzi, placed Lombardy wholly in the hands of Napoleon; and he now  found leisure to avenge himself on the Pope for those hostile  demonstrations which, as yet, he had been contented to hold in check.  The terror with which the priestly court of the Vatican received the  tidings of the utter destruction of the Austrian army, and of the  irresistible conqueror's march southwards, did not prevent the Papal  troops from making some efforts to defend the territories of the Holy  See. General Victor, with 4000 French and as many Lombards, advanced  upon the route of Imola. A Papal force, in numbers about equal, lay  encamped on the river Senio in front of that town. Monks with crucifixes  in their hands, ran through the lines, exciting them to fight bravely  for their country and their Faith. The French general, by a rapid  movement, threw his horse across the stream a league or two higher up,  and then charged with his infantry through the Senio in their front. The  resistance was brief. The Pope's army, composed mostly of new recruits,  retreated in confusion. Faenza was carried by the bayonet. Colli and  3000 more laid down their arms; and the strong town of Ancona was  occupied.[15] On the 10th of February the French entered Loretto, and  rifled that celebrated seat of superstition of whatever treasures it  still retained; the most valuable articles had already been packed up  and sent to Rome for safety.[16]--Victor then turned westwards from  Ancona, with the design to unite with another French column which had  advanced into the papal dominion by Perugia.    The panic which the French advance had by this time spread was such,  that the Pope had no hope but in submission. The peasants lately  transformed into soldiers abandoned everywhere their arms, and fled in  straggling groups to their native villages. The alarm in Rome itself  recalled the days of Alaric.    The conduct of Buonaparte at this critical moment was worthy of that  good sense which formed the original foundation of his successes, and of  which the madness of pampered ambition could alone deprive him  afterwards. He well knew that, of all the inhabitants of the Roman  territories, the class who contemplated his approach with the deepest  terror were the unfortunate French priests, whom the Revolution had made  exiles from their native soil. One of these unhappy gentlemen came forth  in his despair, and surrendering himself at the French headquarters,  said he knew his fate was sealed, and that they might as well lead him  at once to the gallows. Buonaparte dismissed this person with courtesy,  and issued a proclamation that none of the class should be molested; on  the contrary, allotting to each of them the means of existence in  monasteries, wherever his arms were or should be predominant.    This conduct, taken together with other circumstances of recent  occurrence, was well calculated to nourish in the breast of the Pope the  hope that the victorious general of France had, by this time, discarded  the ferocious hostility of the revolutionary government against the  church of which he was head. He hastened, however, to open a  negotiation, and Napoleon received his envoy not merely with civility,  but with professions of the profoundest personal reverence for the holy  father. The Treaty of Tollentino (Feb. 12, 1797) followed. By this the  Pope conceded formally (for the first time), his ancient territory of  Avignon. He resigned the legations of Ferrara, Bologna, and Romagna, and  the port of Ancona; agreed to pay about a million and a half sterling,  and to execute to the utmost the provisions of Bologna with respect to  works of art. On these terms Pius was to remain nominal master of some  shreds of the patrimony of St. Peter.    The French Directory heard with indignation that any semblance of  sovereignty was still left to an enemy whose weakness had been made so  manifest. But Buonaparte had now learned to act for himself. He knew  that any formal dethronement of the Pope would invest his cause with  tenfold strength wherever the Romish religion prevailed; that a new  spirit of aversion would arise against France; and that Naples would  infallibly profit by the first disturbances in the north of Italy, to  declare war, and march her large army from the south. He believed  also--and he ere long knew--that even yet Austria would make other  efforts to recover Lombardy; and was satisfied, on the whole, that he  should best secure his ultimate purposes by suffering the Vatican to  prolong, for some time further, the shadow of that sovereignty which had  in former ages trampled on kings and emperors.
