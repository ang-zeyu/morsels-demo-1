I took nothing.\"    \"You can hardly make me believe that. Why did you open the desk if you  did not propose to take anything?\"    \"I did intend to take something. I was under orders to do so, for I  wouldn't have done it of my own free will; but the moment I got the  desk open I heard a cry, and looking around, I saw Miss Florence  looking at me.\"    \"And then?\"    \"I was startled, and ran to her side.\"    \"And then you went back and completed the robbery?\"    \"No, I didn't. She talked to me so that I felt ashamed of it. I never  stole before, and I wouldn't have tried to do it then, if--if some one  hadn't told me to.\"    \"I know whom you mean--Tim Bolton.\"    \"Yes, Tim Bolton, since you know.\"    \"What did he tell you to take?\"    \"The will and the money.\"    \"Eactly. Now we are coming to it. You took them, and gave them to  him?\"    \"No, I didn't. I haven't seen him since that night.\"    Curtis Waring regarded the boy thoughtfully. His story was  straightforward, and it agreed with the story told by Tim himself.  But, on the other hand, he denied taking the missing articles, and yet  they had disappeared.    Curtis decided that both he and Tim had lied, and that this story had  been concocted between them.    Probably Bolton had the will and the money--the latter he did not care  for--and this thought made him uneasy, for he knew that Tim Bolton was  an unscrupulous man, and quite capable of injuring him, if he saw the  way clear to do so.    \"My young friend,\" he said, \"your story is not even plausible. The  articles are missing, and there was no one but yourself and Florence  who were in a position to take them. Do you wish me to think that my  Cousin Florence robbed the desk?\"    \"No, sir; I don't. Florence wouldn't do such a thing,\" said Dodger,  warmly.    \"Florence. Is that the way you speak of a young lady?\"    \"She tells me to call her Florence. I used to call her Miss Florence,  but she didn't care for it.\"    \"It seems you two have become very intimate,\" said Curtis, with a  sneer.    \"Florence is a good friend to me. I never had so good a friend  before.\"    \"All that is very affecting; however, it isn't to the point. Do you  know,\" he continued, in a sterner tone, \"that I could have you  arrested for entering and breaking open my uncle's desk with  burglarious intent?\"    \"I suppose you could,\" said Dodger; \"but Florence would testify that I  took nothing.\"    \"Am I to understand, then, that you refuse to give me any information  as to the will and the money?\"    \"No, sir; I don't refuse. I would tell you if I knew.\"    Curtis regarded the boy in some perplexity.    He had every appearance of telling the truth.    Dodger had one of those honest, truthful countenances which lend  confirmation to any words spoken. If the boy told the truth, what  could have become of the will--and the money? As to the former, it  might be possible that his uncle had destroyed it, but the  disappearance of the money presented an independent difficulty.    \"The will is all I care for,\" he said, at length. \"The thief is  welcome to the money, though there was a considerable sum.\"    \"I would find the will for you if I could,\" said Dodger, earnestly.    \"You are positive you didn't give it to Bolton?\"    \"Positive, sir. I haven't seen Tim since that night.\"    \"You may be speaking the truth, or you may not. I will talk with you  again to-morrow,\" and Curtis arose from his chair.    \"You don't mean to keep me here?\" said Dodger, in alarm.    \"I shall be obliged to do so.\"    \"I won't stay!\" exclaimed Dodger, in excitement, and he ran to the  door, meaning to get out; but Curtis drew a pistol from his pocket and  aimed it at the boy.    \"Understand me, boy,\" he said, \"I am in earnest, and I am not to be  trifled with.\"    Dodger drew back, and Curtis opened the door and went out, bolting it  after him.          Chapter XIX.  An Attempt To Escape.      While Dodger had no discomfort to complain of, it occurred to him that  Florence would be alarmed by his long absence, for now it seemed  certain that he would have to remain overnight.    If only he could escape he would take care not to fall into such a  trap again.    He went to the window and looked out, but the distance to the ground  was so great--for the room was on the third floor--that he did not  dare to imperil his life by attempting a descent.    If there had been a rope at hand he would not have felt afraid to make  the attempt.    He examined the bed to see if it rested upon cords, but there were  slats instead.    As has already been said, there were no houses near by.    That part of the city had not been much settled, and it was as  solitary as it is in the outskirts of a country village.    If he could only reveal his position to some person outside, so as to  insure interference, he might yet obtain his freedom.    With this thought he tore a blank leaf from one of the books in the  room, and hastily penciled the following lines:        \"I am kept a prisoner in this house. I was induced to come      here by a trick. Please get some one to join you, and come      and demand my release.\"    Some weeks before Dodger could not have written so creditable a note,  but he had greatly improved since he had been under the influence and  instruction of Florence.    Dodger now posted himself at the window and waited anxiously for some  one to pass, so that he might attract his attention and throw down the  paper.    He had to wait for fifteen minutes. Then he saw approaching a young  man, not far from twenty-one, who looked like a young mechanic,  returning from his daily work.    Now was Dodger's opportunity. He put his head out of the window and  called out:    \"Hello, there!\"    The young man looked and saw him at the window.    \"What do you want?\" he asked.    \"Catch this paper, and read what there is on it.\" He threw down the  leaf, which, after fluttering in the gentle evening breeze, found its  way to the ground and was picked up.    After reading it, the young man looked up and said: \"I'll go around to  the door and inquire.\"    He was as good as his word. He went to the outer door and rang the  bell.    Julius came to the door.    \"What's wanted, boss?\" he said.    \"You've got a boy locked up in a room.\"    \"Who told you, boss?\"    \"He threw down a paper to me, telling me he was kept a prisoner.\"    \"What did he say?\" asked Julius.    The young man read the note aloud.    \"What have to say to that, you black imp?\" he demanded, sternly.    The ready wit of Julius served him in this emergency.    \"Dat boy is crazy as a loon, boss!\" he answered, readily. \"We have to  keep him shut up for fear he'll kill some of us.\"    \"You don't say!\" ejaculated the young mechanic. \"He don't look like  it.\"    \"No, he don't; dat's a fact, boss. Fact is, dat boy is the artfullest  lunytick you ever seed. He tried to kill his mother last week.\"    \"Is that true?\"    \"Dat's so, boss. And all de while he looks as innocent as a baby. If I  was to let him out he'd kill somebody, sure.\"    \"I never would have believed it,\" said the young man.    \"If you want to take the risk, boss, you might go up and see him. I  believe he's got a carvin'-knife about him, but I don't dare to go up  and get it away. It would be as much as this niggah's life is worth.\"    \"No,\" answered the young man, hastily. \"I don't want to see him. I  never did like crazy folks. I'm sorry I gave you the trouble to come  to the door.\"    \"Oh, no trouble, boss.\"    \"I guess I've fixed dat boy!\" chuckled Julius. \"Ho, ho! he can't get  ahead of old Julius! Crazy as a loon, ho, ho!\"    Dodger waited anxiously for the young man to get through his  interview. He hoped that he would force his way up to the third floor,  draw the bolt, and release him from his imprisonment.    He kept watch at the window, and when the young man reappeared, he  looked at him eagerly. \"Did you ask them to let me out?\" he shouted.  The other looked up at him with an odd expression of suspicion and  repulsion.    \"You're better off where you are,\" he said, rather impatiently.    \"But they have locked me up here.\"    \"And reason enough, too!\"    \"What makes you say that?\"    \"Because you're crazy as a loon.\"    \"Did the black man say that?\" inquired Dodger, indignantly.    \"Yes, he did--said you tried to kill your mother, and had a  carving-knife hidden in the room.\"    \"It's a lie--an outrageous lie!\" exclaimed Dodger, his eyes flashing.    \"Don't go into one of your tantrums,\" said the man, rather alarmed;  \"it won't do any good.\"    \"But I want you to understand that I am no more crazy than you are.\"    \"Sho? I know better. Where's your carving-knife?\"    \"I haven't got any; I never had any. That negro has been telling you  lies. Just go to the door again, and insist on seeing me.\"    \"I wouldn't dast to. You'd stab me,\" said the man, fearfully.    \"Listen to me!\" said Dodger, getting out of patience. \"I'm not crazy.  I'm a newsboy and baggage-smasher. An old man got me to bring his  valise here, and then locked me up. Won't you go around to the  station-house and send a policeman here?\"    \"I'll see about it,\" said the young man, who did not believe a word  that Dodger had said to him.    \"He won't do it!\" said Dodger to himself, in a tone of discouragement.  \"That miserable nigger has made him believe I am a lunatic. I'll have  him up, anyway.\"    Forthwith he began to pound and kick so forcibly, that Julius came  upstairs on a run, half inclined to believe that Dodger had really  become insane.    \"What do you want, boy?\" he inquired from outside the door.    \"I want you to unbolt the door and let me out.\"    \"I couldn't do"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1860"],[0,"Westward Ho! Or, The Voyages and Adventures of Sir Amyas Leigh, Knight, of (#15)"],[1,"times  from its uncomfortable post between his legs, had returned unconquered;  and the hilt getting a little too far back by reason of the too great  length of the belt, the weapon took up its post triumphantly behind,  standing out point in air, a tail confest, amid the tittering of the  ostlers, and the cheers of the sailors.    At last the poor man, by dint of a chair, was mounted safely, while his  fellow-stranger, a burly, coarse-looking man, equally gay, and rather  more handy, made so fierce a rush at his saddle, that, like \"vaulting  ambition who o'erleaps his selle,\" he \"fell on t'other side:\" or would  have fallen, had he not been brought up short by the shoulders of the  ostler at his off-stirrup. In which shock off came hat and feather.    \"Pardie, the bulldog-faced one is a fighting man. Dost see, Frank? he  has had his head broken.\"    \"That scar came not, my son, but by a pair of most Catholic and  apostolic scissors. My gentle buzzard, that is a priest's tonsure.\"    \"Hang the dog! O, that the sailors may but see it, and put him over the  quay head. I've a half mind to go and do it myself.\"    \"My dear Amyas,\" said Frank, laying two fingers on his arm, \"these  men, whosoever they are, are the guests of our uncle, and therefore  the guests of our family. Ham gained little by publishing Noah's shame;  neither shall we, by publishing our uncle's.\"    \"Murrain on you, old Franky, you never let a man speak his mind, and  shame the devil.\"    \"I have lived long enough in courts, old Amyas, without a murrain on  you, to have found out, first, that it is not so easy to shame the  devil; and secondly, that it is better to outwit him; and the only way  to do that, sweet chuck, is very often not to speak your mind at all.  We will go down and visit them at Chapel in a day or two, and see if we  cannot serve these reynards as the badger did the fox, when he found him  in his hole, and could not get him out by evil savors.\"    \"How then?\"    \"Stuck a sweet nosegay in the door, which turned reynard's stomach at  once; and so overcame evil with good.\"    \"Well, thou art too good for this world, that's certain; so we will go  home to breakfast. Those rogues are out of sight by now.\"    Nevertheless, Amyas was not proof against the temptation of going over  to the inn-door, and asking who were the gentlemen who went with Mr.  Leigh.    \"Gentlemen of Wales,\" said the ostler, \"who came last night in a pinnace  from Milford-haven, and their names, Mr. Morgan Evans and Mr. Evan  Morgans.\"    \"Mr. Judas Iscariot and Mr. Iscariot Judas,\" said Amyas between his  teeth, and then observed aloud, that the Welsh gentlemen seemed rather  poor horsemen.    \"So I said to Mr. Leigh's groom, your worship. But he says that those  parts be so uncommon rough and mountainous, that the poor gentlemen, you  see, being enforced to hunt on foot, have no such opportunities as young  gentlemen hereabout, like your worship; whom God preserve, and send a  virtuous lady, and one worthy of you.\"    \"Thou hast a villainously glib tongue, fellow!\" said Amyas, who was  thoroughly out of humor; \"and a sneaking down visage too, when I come to  look at you. I doubt but you are a Papist too, I do!\"    \"Well, sir! and what if I am! I trust I don't break the queen's laws by  that. If I don't attend Northam church, I pay my month's shilling for  the use of the poor, as the act directs; and beyond that, neither you  nor any man dare demand of me.\"    \"Dare! act directs! You rascally lawyer, you! and whence does an ostler  like you get your shilling to pay withal? Answer me.\" The examinate  found it so difficult to answer the question, that he suddenly became  afflicted with deafness.    \"Do you hear?\" roared Amyas, catching at him with his lion's paw.    \"Yes, missus; anon, anon, missus!\" quoth he to an imaginary landlady  inside, and twisting under Amyas's hand like an eel, vanished into the  house, while Frank got the hot-headed youth away.    \"What a plague is one to do, then? That fellow was a Papist spy!\"    \"Of course he was!\" said Frank.    \"Then, what is one to do, if the whole country is full of them?\"    \"Not to make fools of ourselves about them, and so leave them to make  fools of themselves.\"    \"That's all very fine: but--well, I shall remember the villain's face if  I see him again.\"    \"There is no harm in that,\" said Frank.    \"Glad you think so.\"    \"Don't quarrel with me, Amyas, the first day.\"    \"Quarrel with thee, my darling old fellow! I had sooner kiss the dust  off thy feet, if I were worthy of it. So now away home; my inside cries  cupboard.\"    In the meanwhile Messrs. Evans and Morgans were riding away, as fast  as the rough by-lanes would let them, along the fresh coast of the bay,  steering carefully clear of Northam town on the one hand, and on the  other, of Portledge, where dwelt that most Protestant justice of the  peace, Mr. Coffin. And it was well for them that neither Amyas Leigh,  nor indeed any other loyal Englishman, was by when they entered, as they  shortly did, the lonely woods which stretch along the southern wall of  the bay. For there Eustace Leigh pulled up short; and both he and his  groom, leaping from their horses, knelt down humbly in the wet grass,  and implored the blessing of the two valiant gentlemen of Wales,  who, having graciously bestowed it with three fingers apiece, became  thenceforth no longer Morgan Evans and Evan Morgans, Welshmen and  gentlemen; but Father Parsons and Father Gampian, Jesuits, and gentlemen  in no sense in which that word is applied in this book.    After a few minutes, the party were again in motion, ambling steadily  and cautiously along the high table-land, towards Moorwinstow in the  west; while beneath them on the right, at the mouth of rich-wooded  glens, opened vistas of the bright blue bay, and beyond it the sandhills  of Braunton, and the ragged rocks of Morte; while far away to the north  and west the lonely isle of Lundy hung like a soft gray cloud.    But they were not destined to reach their point as peaceably as they  could have wished. For just as they got opposite Clovelly dike, the huge  old Roman encampment which stands about midway in their journey, they  heard a halloo from the valley below, answered by a fainter one far  ahead. At which, like a couple of rogues (as indeed they were), Father  Campian and Father Parsons looked at each other, and then both stared  round at the wild, desolate, open pasture (for the country was then all  unenclosed), and the great dark furze-grown banks above their heads; and  Campian remarked gently to Parsons, that this was a very dreary spot,  and likely enough for robbers.    \"A likelier spot for us, Father,\" said Eustace, punning. \"The old Romans  knew what they were about when they put their legions up aloft here to  overlook land and sea for miles away; and we may thank them some day for  their leavings. The banks are all sound; there is plenty of good water  inside; and\" (added he in Latin), \"in case our Spanish friends--you  understand?\"    \"Pauca verba, my son!\" said Campian: but as he spoke, up from the ditch  close beside him, as if rising out of the earth, burst through the  furze-bushes an armed cavalier.    \"Pardon, gentlemen!\" shouted he, as the Jesuit and his horse recoiled  against the groom. \"Stand, for your lives!\"    \"Mater caelorum!\" moaned Campian; while Parsons, who, as all the world  knows, was a blustering bully enough (at least with his tongue), asked:  What a murrain right had he to stop honest folks on the queen's highway?  confirming the same with a mighty oath, which he set down as peccatum  veniale, on account of the sudden necessity; nay, indeed fraus pia, as  proper to support the character of that valiant gentleman of Wales, Mr.  Evan Morgans. But the horseman, taking no notice of his hint, dashed  across the nose of Eustace Leigh's horse, with a \"Hillo, old lad! where  ridest so early?\" and peering down for a moment into the ruts of the  narrow track-way, struck spurs into his horse, shouting, \"A fresh  slot! right away for Hartland! Forward, gentlemen all! follow, follow,  follow!\"    \"Who is this roysterer?\" asked Parsons, loftily.    \"Will Cary, of Clovelly; an awful heretic: and here come more behind.\"    And as he spoke four or five more mounted gallants plunged in and out of  the great dikes, and thundered on behind the party; whose horses, quite  understanding what game was up, burst into full gallop, neighing and  squealing; and in another minute the hapless Jesuits were hurling along  over moor and moss after a \"hart of grease.\"    Parsons, who, though a vulgar bully, was no coward, supported the  character of Mr. Evan Morgans well enough; and he would have really  enjoyed himself, had he not been in agonies of fear lest those precious  saddle-bags in front of him should break from their lashings, and  rolling to the earth, expose to the hoofs of heretic horses, perhaps to  the gaze of heretic eyes, such a cargo of bulls, dispensations, secret  correspondences, seditious tracts, and so forth, that at the very  thought of their being seen, his head felt loose upon his shoulders. But  the future martyr behind him, Mr. Morgan Evans, gave himself up at once  to abject despair, and as he bumped and rolled along, sought vainly for  comfort in professional ejaculations in the Latin tongue.    \"Mater intemerata! Eripe me e--Ugh! I am down! Adhaesit pavimento  venter!--No! I am not! El dilectum tuum e potestate canis--Ah! Audisti  me inter cornua unicornium! Put this, too, down in--ugh!--thy account in  favor of my poor--oh, sharpness of this saddle! Oh, whither, barbarous  islanders!\"    Now riding on his quarter, not in the rough track-way like a cockney,  but through the soft heather like a sportsman, was a very gallant knight  whom we all know well by this time, Richard Grenville by name; who had  made Mr. Cary and the rest his guests the night before, and then ridden  out with "]]]
