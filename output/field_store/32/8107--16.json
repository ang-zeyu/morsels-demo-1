CHAPTER VII    THE MANTIS.--THE NEST      Let us take a more pleasant aspect of the insect whose loves are so  tragic. Its nest is a marvel. In scientific language it is known as the  _ootek_, or the \"egg-box.\" I shall not make use of this barbarous  expression. As one does not speak of the \"egg-box\" of the titmouse,  meaning \"the nest of the titmouse,\" why should I invoke the box in  speaking of the Mantis? It may look more scientific; but that does not  interest me.    The nest of the Praying Mantis may be found almost everywhere in places  exposed to the sun: on stones, wood, vine stocks, the twigs of bushes,  stems of dried grass, and even on products of human industry, such as  fragments of brick, rags of heavy cloth, and pieces of old boots. Any  support will suffice, so long as it offers inequalities to which the  base of the nest may adhere, and so provide a solid foundation. The  usual dimensions of the nest are one and a half inches long by  three-quarters of an inch wide, or a trifle larger. The colour is a pale  tan, like that of a grain of wheat. Brought in contact with a flame the  nest burns readily, and emits an odour like that of burning silk. The  material of the nest is in fact a substance similar to silk, but instead  of being drawn into a thread it is allowed to harden while a mass of  spongy foam. If the nest is fixed on a branch the base creeps round it,  envelops the neighbouring twigs, and assumes a variable shape according  to the accidents of support; if it is fixed on a flat surface the under  side, which is always moulded by the support, is itself flat. The nest  then takes the form of a demi-ellipsoid, or, in other words, half an egg  cut longitudinally; more or less obtuse at one end, but pointed at the  other, and sometimes ending in a short curved tail.    In all cases the upper face is convex and regular. In it we can  distinguish three well-marked and longitudinal zones. The middle zone,  which is narrower than the others, is composed of thin plates arranged  in couples, and overlapping like the tiles of a roof. The edges of these  plates are free, leaving two parallel series of fissures by which the  young can issue when the eggs are hatched. In a nest recently abandoned  this zone is covered with fine cast-off skins which shiver at the least  breath, and soon disappear when exposed to the open air. I will call  this zone the zone of issue, as it is only along this bell that the  young can escape, being set free by those that have preceded them.    In all other directions the cradle of this numerous family presents an  unbroken wall. The two lateral zones, which occupy the greater part of  the demi-ellipsoid, have a perfect continuity of surface. The little  Mantes, which are very feeble when first hatched, could not possibly  make their way through the tenacious substance of the walls. On the  interior of these walls are a number of fine transverse furrows, signs  of the various layers in which the mass of eggs is disposed.    Let us cut the nest in half transversely. We shall then see that the  mass of eggs constitutes an elongated core, of very firm consistency,  surrounded as to the bottom and sides by a thick porous rind, like  solidified foam. Above the eggs are the curved plates, which are set  very closely and have little freedom; their edges constituting the zone  of issue, where they form a double series of small overlapping scales.    The eggs are set in a yellowish medium of horny appearance. They are  arranged in layers, in lines forming arcs of a circle, with the cephalic  extremities converging towards the zone of issue. This orientation tells  us of the method of delivery. The newly-born larvae will slip into the  interval between two adjacent flaps or leaves, which form a prolongation  of the core; they will then find a narrow passage, none too easy to  effect, but sufficient, having regard to the curious provision which we  shall deal with directly; they will then reach the zone of issue. There,  under the overlapping scales, two passages of exit open for each layer  of eggs. Half the larvae will issue by the right-hand passage, half by  that on the left hand. This process is repeated for each layer, from end  to end of the nest.    Let us sum up those structural details, which are not easily grasped  unless one has the nest before one. Lying along the axis of the nest,  and in shape like a date-stone, is the mass of eggs, grouped in layers.  A protective rind, a kind of solidified foam, envelops this core, except  at the top, along the central line, where the porous rind is replaced by  thin overlapping leaves. The free edges of these leaves form the  exterior of the zone of issue; they overlap one another, forming two  series of scales, leaving two exits, in the shape of narrow crevices,  for each layer of eggs.

PELLET OF THE SISYPHUS WITH DEJECTA OF THE LARVA FORCED THROUGH THE  WALLS.]      To be present at the construction of the nest--to learn how the Mantis  contrives to build so complex a structure--such was the main point of my  researches. I succeeded, not without difficulty, as the eggs are laid  without warning and nearly always at night. After a great deal of futile  endeavour, chance at last favoured me. On the 5th of September one of my  guests, fecundated on the 29th of August, began to make her preparations  under my eyes, at four o'clock in the afternoon.    One remark before proceeding: all the nests I have obtained in the  laboratory--and I have obtained a good number--have without exception  been built upon the wire gauze of the covers. I have been careful to  provide the insects with roughened stones and tufts of thyme, both being  very commonly used as foundations in the open fields. The captives have  always preferred the network of wire gauze, which affords a perfectly  firm foundation, as the soft material of the nest becomes incrusted upon  the meshes as it hardens.    In natural conditions the nests are never in any way sheltered; they  support the inclemencies of winter, resist rain, wind, frost, and snow,  without becoming detached. It is true that the female always selects an  uneven support on which the foundations of the nest can be shaped, thus  obtaining a firm hold. The site chosen is always the best obtainable  within reach, and the wire gauze is constantly adopted as the best  foundation obtainable in the cages.    The only Mantis that I was able to observe at the moment of laying her  eggs worked upside-down, clinging to the wire near the top of the cover.  My presence, my magnifying-glass, my investigations did not disturb her  in the least, so absorbed was she in her labours. I was able to lift up  the dome of wire gauze, tilt it, reverse it, turn it over and reverse it  again, without causing the insect to delay her task for a moment. I was  able, with my tweezers, to raise the long wings in order to observe  rather more closely what was taking place beneath them; the Mantis took  absolutely no notice of me. So far all was well; the female did not  move, and lent herself impassively to all the indiscretions of the  observer. Nevertheless, matters did not proceed as I had wished, so  rapid was the operation and so difficult observation.    The end of the abdomen is constantly immersed in a blob of foam, which  does not allow one to grasp the details of the process very clearly.  This foam is of a greyish white, slightly viscous, and almost like  soapsuds. At the moment of its appearance it adheres slightly to the end  of a straw plunged into it. Two minutes later it is solidified and no  longer adheres to the straw. In a short time its consistency is that of  the substance of an old nest.    [Illustration: 1. THE MANTIS DEVOURING THE MALE IN THE ACT OF MATING.    2. THE MANTIS COMPLETING HER NEST.    3. GOLDEN SCARABAEI CUTTING UP A LOB-WORM.]    The foamy mass consists chiefly of air imprisoned in minute bubbles.  This air, which gives the nest a volume very much greater than that of  the abdomen of the Mantis, evidently does not issue from the insect  although the foam appears at the orifice of the genital organs; it is  borrowed from the atmosphere. The Mantis builds more especially with  air, which is eminently adapted to protect the nest against changes  of temperature. She emits a glutinous substance like the liquid  secretion of silk-worms, and with this composition, mixed  instantaneously with the outer air, she produces the foam of which the  nest is constructed.    She whips the secretion as we whip white of egg, in order to make it  rise and stiffen. The extremity of the abdomen opens in a long cleft,  forming two lateral ladles which open and shut with a rapid, incessant  movement, beating the viscous liquid and converting it into foam as it  is secreted. Beside the two oscillating ladles we see the internal  organs rising and falling, protruding and retreating like a piston-rod,  but it is impossible to observe the precise nature of their action,  bathed as they are in the opaque blob of foam.    The end of the abdomen, continually palpitating, rapidly closing and  opening its valves, oscillates right and left like a pendulum. From each  of these oscillations results a layer of eggs in the interior, and a  transversal crevice on the exterior. As it advances in the arc  described, suddenly, and at frequent intervals, it plunges deeper into  the foam, as though burying something at the bottom of the frothy mass.  Each time it does so an egg is doubtless deposited; but the operation is  so rapid, and takes place under conditions so unfavourable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18362"],[0,"Fifteen
