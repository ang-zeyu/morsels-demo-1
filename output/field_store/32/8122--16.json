And we couldn't cut them even if we got up, and we couldn't get up. If  we had anything red, we could get down on the line and wave it.\"    \"But the train wouldn't see us till it got round the corner, and then it  could see the mound just as well as us,\" said Phyllis; \"better, because  it's much bigger than us.\"    \"If we only had something red,\" Peter repeated, \"we could go round the  corner and wave to the train.\"    \"We might wave, anyway.\"    \"They'd only think it was just US, as usual. We've waved so often  before. Anyway, let's get down.\"    They got down the steep stairs. Bobbie was pale and shivering. Peter's  face looked thinner than usual. Phyllis was red-faced and damp with  anxiety.    \"Oh, how hot I am!\" she said; \"and I thought it was going to be cold; I  wish we hadn't put on our--\" she stopped short, and then ended in quite  a different tone--\"our flannel petticoats.\"    Bobbie turned at the bottom of the stairs.    \"Oh, yes,\" she cried; \"THEY'RE red! Let's take them off.\"    They did, and with the petticoats rolled up under their arms, ran along  the railway, skirting the newly fallen mound of stones and rock and  earth, and bent, crushed, twisted trees. They ran at their best pace.  Peter led, but the girls were not far behind. They reached the corner  that hid the mound from the straight line of railway that ran half a  mile without curve or corner.    \"Now,\" said Peter, taking hold of the largest flannel petticoat.    \"You're not\"--Phyllis faltered--\"you're not going to TEAR them?\"    \"Shut up,\" said Peter, with brief sternness.    \"Oh, yes,\" said Bobbie, \"tear them into little bits if you like. Don't  you see, Phil, if we can't stop the train, there'll be a real live  accident, with people KILLED. Oh, horrible! Here, Peter, you'll never  tear it through the band!\"    She took the red flannel petticoat from him and tore it off an inch from  the band. Then she tore the other in the same way.    \"There!\" said Peter, tearing in his turn. He divided each petticoat into  three pieces. \"Now, we've got six flags.\" He looked at the watch again.  \"And we've got seven minutes. We must have flagstaffs.\"    The knives given to boys are, for some odd reason, seldom of the kind  of steel that keeps sharp. The young saplings had to be broken off. Two  came up by the roots. The leaves were stripped from them.    \"We must cut holes in the flags, and run the sticks through the holes,\"  said Peter. And the holes were cut. The knife was sharp enough to cut  flannel with. Two of the flags were set up in heaps of loose stones  between the sleepers of the down line. Then Phyllis and Roberta took  each a flag, and stood ready to wave it as soon as the train came in  sight.    \"I shall have the other two myself,\" said Peter, \"because it was my idea  to wave something red.\"    \"They're our petticoats, though,\" Phyllis was beginning, but Bobbie  interrupted--    \"Oh, what does it matter who waves what, if we can only save the train?\"    Perhaps Peter had not rightly calculated the number of minutes it would  take the 11.29 to get from the station to the place where they were, or  perhaps the train was late. Anyway, it seemed a very long time that they  waited.    Phyllis grew impatient. \"I expect the watch is wrong, and the train's  gone by,\" said she.    Peter relaxed the heroic attitude he had chosen to show off his two  flags. And Bobbie began to feel sick with suspense.    It seemed to her that they had been standing there for hours and hours,  holding those silly little red flannel flags that no one would ever  notice. The train wouldn't care. It would go rushing by them and tear  round the corner and go crashing into that awful mound. And everyone  would be killed. Her hands grew very cold and trembled so that she could  hardly hold the flag. And then came the distant rumble and hum of the  metals, and a puff of white steam showed far away along the stretch of  line.    \"Stand firm,\" said Peter, \"and wave like mad! When it gets to that  big furze bush step back, but go on waving! Don't stand ON the line,  Bobbie!\"    The train came rattling along very, very fast.    \"They don't see us! They won't see us! It's all no good!\" cried Bobbie.    The two little flags on the line swayed as the nearing train shook and  loosened the heaps of loose stones that held them up. One of them slowly  leaned over and fell on the line. Bobbie jumped forward and caught it  up, and waved it; her hands did not tremble now.    It seemed that the train came on as fast as ever. It was very near now.    \"Keep off the line, you silly cuckoo!\" said Peter, fiercely.    \"It's no good,\" Bobbie said again.    \"Stand back!\" cried Peter, suddenly, and he dragged Phyllis back by the  arm.    But Bobbie cried, \"Not yet, not yet!\" and waved her two flags right over  the line. The front of the engine looked black and enormous. Its voice  was loud and harsh.    \"Oh, stop, stop, stop!\" cried Bobbie. No one heard her. At least Peter  and Phyllis didn't, for the oncoming rush of the train covered the sound  of her voice with a mountain of sound. But afterwards she used to wonder  whether the engine itself had not heard her. It seemed almost as though  it had--for it slackened swiftly, slackened and stopped, not twenty  yards from the place where Bobbie's two flags waved over the line. She  saw the great black engine stop dead, but somehow she could not stop  waving the flags. And when the driver and the fireman had got off the  engine and Peter and Phyllis had gone to meet them and pour out their  excited tale of the awful mound just round the corner, Bobbie still  waved the flags but more and more feebly and jerkily.    When the others turned towards her she was lying across the line with  her hands flung forward and still gripping the sticks of the little red  flannel flags.    The engine-driver picked her up, carried her to the train, and laid her  on the cushions of a first-class carriage.    \"Gone right off in a faint,\" he said, \"poor little woman. And no wonder.  I'll just 'ave a look at this 'ere mound of yours, and then we'll run  you back to the station and get her seen to.\"    It was horrible to see Bobbie lying so white and quiet, with her lips  blue, and parted.    \"I believe that's what people look like when they're dead,\" whispered  Phyllis.    \"DON'T!\" said Peter, sharply.    They sat by Bobbie on the blue cushions, and the train ran back. Before  it reached their station Bobbie had sighed and opened her eyes,  and rolled herself over and begun to cry. This cheered the others  wonderfully. They had seen her cry before, but they had never seen her  faint, nor anyone else, for the matter of that. They had not known what  to do when she was fainting, but now she was only crying they could  thump her on the back and tell her not to, just as they always did. And  presently, when she stopped crying, they were able to laugh at her for  being such a coward as to faint.    When the station was reached, the three were the heroes of an agitated  meeting on the platform.    The praises they got for their \"prompt action,\" their \"common sense,\"  their \"ingenuity,\" were enough to have turned anybody's head. Phyllis  enjoyed herself thoroughly. She had never been a real heroine before,  and the feeling was delicious. Peter's ears got very red. Yet he, too,  enjoyed himself. Only Bobbie wished they all wouldn't. She wanted to get  away.    \"You'll hear from the Company about this, I expect,\" said the Station  Master.    Bobbie wished she might never hear of it again. She pulled at Peter's  jacket.    \"Oh, come away, come away! I want to go home,\" she said.    So they went. And as they went Station Master and Porter and guards and  driver and fireman and passengers sent up a cheer.    \"Oh, listen,\" cried Phyllis; \"that's for US!\"    \"Yes,\" said Peter. \"I say, I am glad I thought about something red, and  waving it.\"    \"How lucky we DID put on our red flannel petticoats!\" said Phyllis.    Bobbie said nothing. She was thinking of the horrible mound, and the  trustful train rushing towards it.    \"And it was US that saved them,\" said Peter.    \"How dreadful if they had all been killed!\" said Phyllis; \"wouldn't it,  Bobbie?\"    \"We never got any cherries, after all,\" said Bobbie.    The others thought her rather heartless.        Chapter VII. For valour.      I hope you don't mind my telling you a good deal about Roberta. The fact  is I am growing very fond of her. The more I observe her the more I love  her. And I notice all sorts of things about her that I like.    For instance, she was quite oddly anxious to make other people happy.  And she could keep a secret, a tolerably rare accomplishment. Also she  had the power of silent sympathy. That sounds rather dull, I know, but  it's not so dull as it sounds. It just means that a person is able  to know that you are unhappy, and to love you extra on that account,  without bothering you by telling you all the time how sorry she is  for you. That was what Bobbie was like. She knew that Mother was  unhappy--and that Mother had not told her the reason. So she just loved  Mother more and never said a single word that could let Mother know how  earnestly her little girl wondered what Mother was unhappy about. This  needs practice. It is not so easy as you might think.    Whatever happened--and all sorts of nice, pleasant ordinary things  happened--such as picnics, games, and buns for tea, Bobbie always had  these thoughts at the back of her mind. \"Mother's unhappy. Why? I don't  know. She doesn't want me to know. I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18751"],[0,"A Text-book of Assaying: For the Use of Those Connected with Mines. (#15)"],[1,"y. But the accuracy is slightly diminished; a long narrow tube  makes a poor measuring instrument because of the amount of liquid it  finally retains. A defect possessed by both forms is the retention of a  drop of varying size in the nozzle. Whatever method is adopted for  removing this drop must be always adhered to. The most convenient form  is the one last described, and the most useful sizes are 100 c.c., 50  c.c., 20 c.c., 10 c.c., and 5 c.c. Ten c.c. pipettes graduated into  tenths of a cubic centimetre are very useful: those are best in which  the graduation stops short of the bottom.    All measurements should be made at the ordinary temperature; and, before  being used, the pipette should be rinsed out with a cubic centimetre or  so of the solution to be measured. After using, it should be washed out  with water.    ~Burettes~ differ mainly from pipettes in having the flow of liquid  controlled from below instead of from above. The best form is that known  as Mohr's, one kind of which is provided with a glass stopcock, while  the other has a piece of india-rubber tube compressed by a clip. The  latter cannot be used for solutions of permanganate of potash or of  iodine, or of any substance which acts on india-rubber; but in other  respects there is little to choose between the two kinds. A burette  delivering 100 c.c., and graduated into fifths (_i.e._, each division =  0.2 c.c.), is a very convenient size. For some kinds of work, 50 c.c.  divided into tenths (_i.e._, each division = 0.1 c.c.) may be selected.    Burettes may be fixed in any convenient stand; they must be vertical and  should be so placed that the assayer can read any part of the graduated  scale without straining. When not in use, they should be kept full of  water. When using a burette, the water must be run out; the burette is  next rinsed with some of the solution to be used, and drained; and then  it is filled with the solution. Next squeeze the india-rubber tube so as  to disentangle air-bubbles and, by smartly opening the clip, allow the  tube and jet to be filled; see that no bubbles of air are left. Then  run out cautiously until the level of the liquid in the burette stands  at zero. In reading the level with very dark-coloured liquids it is  convenient to read from the level A (fig. 27), and, provided it is done  in each reading, there is no objection to this. The accuracy of the  reading of a burette is sensibly increased by the use of an Erdmann  float. This is an elongated bulb, weighted with mercury, and fitting  (somewhat loosely) the tube of the burette. It floats in the solution,  and is marked with a horizontal line; this line is taken as the level of  the liquid. If the burette is filled from the top, the float rises with  aggravating slowness, and this is its chief disadvantage. The float must  come to rest before any reading is made.    [Illustration: FIG. 30.]    A convenient plan for filling a burette from below is shown in fig. 30.  The diagram explains itself. The bottle containing the standard solution  is connected with the burette by a syphon arrangement through the glass  tube and T-piece. The flow of liquid into the burette is controlled by  the clip. When this clip is opened, the burette fills; and when it is  closed, the burette is ready for use in the ordinary way.    ~Measuring Gases.~--Lange's nitrometer (fig. 69) is a very convenient  instrument for many gasometric methods. It requires the use of a fair  quantity of mercury. In fig. 31, there is a representation of a piece of  apparatus easily fitted up from the ordinary material of a laboratory.  It is one which will serve some useful purposes. It consists of a  wide-mouthed bottle fitted (by preference) with a rubber cork. The cork  is perforated, and in the perforation is placed a glass tube which  communicates with the burette. The burette is connected by a rubber tube  and a Y-piece, either with another burette or with a piece of ordinary  combustion-tube of about the same size. The wide-mouthed bottle contains  either a short test-tube or an ordinary phial with its neck cut off. In  working the apparatus the weighed substance is put in the bottle and the  re-agent which is to act on it, in the test-tube; the cork is then  inserted. The liquid in the two burettes is next brought to the same  level, either by pouring it in at A or running it out at B. The level of  the liquid in the apparatus for correcting variation in volume is then  read and noted. Next, after seeing that the level of the liquid in the  burette has not changed, turn the bottle over on its side so that the  re-agent in the test-tube shall be upset into the bottle. Then, as the  volume of the gas increases, lower the liquid in the burette by running  it out at B, and at the same time keep the level in A half an inch or so  lower than that in the burette. When the action has finished bring the  liquid in the two vessels to the same level and read off the burette.  This part of the work must always be done in the same manner.    [Illustration: FIG. 31.]    _The volume corrector for gas analysis_ is a graduated glass tube of 120  c.c. capacity inverted over a narrow glass cylinder of mercury. It  contains 0.2 or 0.3 c.c. of water and a volume of air, which, if dry and  under standard conditions, would measure 100 c.c. The actual volume  varies from day to day, and is read off at any time by bringing the  mercury inside and outside to the same level. This is done by raising or  lowering the tube, as may be required. Any volume of gas obtained in an  assay can be corrected to standard temperature and pressure by  multiplying by 100 and dividing by the number of c.c. in the corrector  at the time the assay is made.    FOOTNOTES:    [5] It is best to use this form with a glass stopcock, or with an  india-rubber tube and clip, after the manner of a Mohr's burette.          CHAPTER VI.    RE-AGENTS.--ACIDS, ETC.      ~Acetic Acid~, H[=A=c] or C_{2}H_{4}O_{2}. (sp. gr. 1.044, containing 33  per cent. real acid).--An organic acid, forming a class of salts,  acetates, which are for the most part soluble in water, and which, on  ignition, leave the oxide or carbonate of the metal. It is almost always  used in those cases where mineral acids are objectionable. To convert,  for example, a solution of a substance in hydrochloric acid into a  solution of the same in acetic acid, alkali should be added in excess  and then acetic acid. Many compounds are insoluble in acetic acid, which  are soluble in mineral acids, such as ferric phosphate, ferric arsenate,  zinc sulphide, calcium oxalate, &c., so that the use of acetic acid is  valuable in some separations. The commercial acid is strong enough for  most purposes, and is used without dilution.    ~\"Aqua Regia\"~ is a mixture of 1 part by measure of nitric acid and 3  parts of hydrochloric acid. The acids react forming what is practically  a solution of chlorine.[6] The mixture is best made when wanted, and is  chiefly used for the solution of gold and platinum and for \"opening up\"  sulphides. When solutions in aqua regia are evaporated, chlorides are  left.    ~Bromine~, Br. (sp. gr. 3.0). Practically pure bromine.--It is a heavy  reddish-brown liquid and very volatile. It boils at 60° C., and,  consequently, must be kept in a cool place. It gives off brown  irritating vapours, which render its use very objectionable. Generally  it answers the same purpose as aqua regia, and is employed where the  addition of nitric acid to a solution has to be specially avoided. It is  also used for dissolving metals only from ores which contain metallic  oxides not desired in the solution.    ~\"Bromine Water\"~ is simply bromine shaken up with water till no more is  dissolved.    ~Carbonic Acid~, CO_{2}.--A heavy gas, somewhat soluble in water; it is  mainly used for providing an atmosphere in which substances may be  dissolved, titrated, &c., without fear of oxidation. It is also used in  titrating arsenic assays with \"iodine\" when a feeble acid is required  to prevent the absorption of iodine by the alkaline carbonate. It is  prepared when wanted in solution, by adding a gram or so of bicarbonate  of soda and then as much acid as will decompose the bicarbonate  mentioned. When a quantity of the gas is wanted, it is prepared, in an  apparatus like that used for sulphuretted hydrogen, by acting on  fragments of marble or limestone with dilute hydrochloric acid.    ~Citric Acid~ (H_{3}[=C=i] or C_{6}H_{8}O_{7}.H_{2}O) is an organic acid  which occurs in colourless crystals, soluble in less than their weight  of water. The solution must be freshly prepared, as it gets mouldy when  kept. It forms a comparatively unimportant class of salts (citrates). It  is used in the determination of phosphoric acid, chiefly for the purpose  of preventing the precipitation of phosphates of iron and alumina by  ammonia, and in a few similar cases. The commercial crystals are used;  they should be free from sulphuric acid and leave no ash on ignition.    ~Hydrochloric Acid~, HCl in water, (sp. gr. 1.16. It contains 32 per  cent. of hydrogen chloride).--It is sometimes called \"muriatic acid,\"  and when impure, \"spirit of salt.\" The acid solution should be  colourless and free from arsenic, iron, and sulphuric acid. It forms an  important family of salts, the chlorides. It is the best acid for  dissolving metallic oxides and carbonates, and is always used by the  assayer when oxidising agents are to be avoided. The acid is used  without dilution when no directions are expressly given to dilute it. It  has no action on the following metals: gold, platinum, arsenic, and  mercury; it very slightly attacks antimony, bismuth, lead, silver, and  copper. Tin is more soluble in it, but with difficulty; whilst iron,  zinc, nickel, cobalt, cadmium, and aluminium easily dissolve with  evolution of hydrogen and the formation of the lower chloride if the  metal forms more than one class of"]]]
