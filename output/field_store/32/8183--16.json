BREWSTER, SIR DAVID (1781-1868), Scottish natural philosopher, was born on  the 11th of December 1781 at Jedburgh, where his father, a teacher of high  reputation, was rector of the grammar school. At the early age of twelve he  was sent to the university of Edinburgh, being intended for the clerical  profession. Even before this, however, he had shown a strong inclination  for natural science, and this had been fostered by his intimacy with a  \"self-taught philosopher, astronomer and mathematician,\" as Sir Walter  Scott called him, of great local fame--James Veitch of Inchbonny, who was  particularly skilful in making telescopes. Though he duly finished his  theological course and was licensed to preach, Brewster's preference for  other pursuits prevented him from engaging in the active duties of his  profession. In 1799 he was induced by his fellow-student, Henry Brougham,  to study the diffraction of light. The results of his investigations were  communicated from time to time in papers to the _Philosophical  Transactions_ of London and other scientific journals, and were admirably  and impartially summarized by James D. Forbes in his preliminary  dissertation to the eighth edition of the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_. The  fact that other philosophers, notably Etienne Louis Malus and Augustin  Fresnel, were pursuing the same investigations contemporaneously in France  does not invalidate Brewster's claim to independent discovery, even though  in one or two cases the priority must be assigned to others.    The most important subjects of his inquiries are enumerated by Forbes under  the following five heads:--(1) The laws of polarization by reflection and  refraction, and other quantitative laws of phenomena; (2) The discovery of  the polarizing structure induced by heat and pressure; (3) The discovery of  crystals with two axes of double refraction, and many of the laws of their  phenomena, including the connexion of optical structure and crystalline  forms; (4) The laws of metallic reflection; (5) Experiments on the  absorption of light. In this line of investigation the prime importance  belongs to the discovery (1) of the connexion between the refractive index  and the polarizing angle, (2) of biaxial crystals, and (3) of the  production of double refraction by irregular heating. These discoveries  were promptly recognized. So early as the year 1807 the degree of LL.D. was  conferred upon Brewster by Marischal College, Aberdeen; in 1815 he was made  a member of the Royal Society of London, and received the Copley medal; in  1818 he received the Rumford medal of the society; and in 1816 the French  Institute awarded him one-half of the prize of three thousand francs for  the two most important discoveries in physical science made in Europe  during the two preceding years. Among the non-scientific public his fame  was spread more effectually by his rediscovery about 1815 of the  kaleidoscope, for which there was a great demand in both England and  America. An instrument of higher interest, the stereoscope, which, though  of much later date (1849-1850), may be mentioned here, since along with the  kaleidoscope it did more than anything else to popularize his name, was  not, as has often been asserted, the invention of Brewster. Sir Charles  Wheatstone discovered its principle and applied it as early as 1838 to the  construction of a cumbrous but effective instrument, in which the binocular  pictures were made to combine by means of mirrors. To Brewster is due the  merit of suggesting the use of lenses for the purpose of uniting the  dissimilar pictures; and accordingly the lenticular stereoscope may fairly  be said to be his invention. A much more valuable practical result of  Brewster's optical researches was the improvement of the British lighthouse  system. It is true that the dioptric apparatus was perfected independently  by Fresnel, who had also the satisfaction of being the first to put it into  operation. But it is indisputable that Brewster was earlier in the field  than Fresnel; that he described the dioptric apparatus in 1812; that he  pressed its adoption on those in authority at least as early as 1820, two  years before Fresnel suggested it; and that it was finally introduced into  British lighthouses mainly by his persistent efforts.    Brewster's own discoveries, important though they were, were not his only,  perhaps not even his chief, service to science. He began literary work in  1799 as a regular contributor to the _Edinburgh Magazine_, of which he  acted as editor at the age of twenty. In 1807 he undertook the editorship  of the newly projected _Edinburgh Encyclopaedia_, of which the first part  appeared in 1808, and the last not until 1830. The work was strongest in  the scientific department, and many of its most valuable articles were from  the pen of the editor. At a later period he was one of the leading  contributors to the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ (seventh and eighth  editions), the articles on Electricity, Hydrodynamics, Magnetism,  Microscope, Optics, Stereoscope, Voltaic Electricity, &c., being from his  pen. In 1819 Brewster undertook further editorial work by establishing, in  conjunction with Robert Jameson (1774-1854), the _Edinburgh Philosophical  Journal_, which took the place of the _Edinburgh Magazine_. The first ten  volumes (1819-1824) were published under the joint editorship of Brewster  and Jameson, the remaining four volumes (1825-1826) being edited by Jameson  alone. After parting company with Jameson, Brewster started the _Edinburgh  Journal of Science_ in 1824, sixteen volumes of which appeared under his  editorship during the years 1824-1832, with very many articles from his own  pen. To the transactions of various learned societies he contributed from  first to last between three and four hundred papers, and few of his  contemporaries wrote so much for the various reviews. In the _North British  Review_ alone seventy-five articles of his appeared. A list of his larger  separate works will be found below. Special mention, however, must be made  of the most important of them all--his biography of Sir Isaac Newton. In  1831 he published a short popular account of the philosopher's life in  Murray's _Family Library_; but it was not until 1855 that he was able to  issue the much fuller _Memoirs of the Life, Writings and Discoveries of Sir  Isaac Newton_, a work which embodied the results of more than twenty years'  patient investigation of original manuscripts and all other available  sources.    Brewster's relations as editor brought him into frequent communication with  the most eminent scientific men, and he was naturally among the first to  recognize the benefit that would accrue from regular intercourse among  workers in the field of science. In an article in the _Quarterly Review_ he  threw out a suggestion for \"an association of our nobility, clergy, gentry  and philosophers,\" which was taken up by others and found speedy  realization in the British Association for the Advancement of [v.04 p.0514]  Science. Its first meeting was held at York in 1831; and Brewster, along  with Charles Babbage and Sir John F. W. Herschel, had the chief part in  shaping its constitution. In the same year in which the British Association  held its first meeting, Brewster received the honour of knighthood and the  decoration of the Guelphic order of Hanover. In 1838 he was appointed  principal of the united colleges of St Salvator and St Leonard, St Andrews.  In 1849 he acted as president of the British Association and was elected  one of the eight foreign associates of the Institute of France in  succession to J.J. Berzelius; and ten years later he accepted the office of  principal of the university of Edinburgh, the duties of which he discharged  until within a few months of his death, which took place at Allerly,  Melrose, on the 10th of February 1868.    In estimating Brewster's place among "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19706"],[0,"Brood of the Witch-Queen (#15)"],[1,"the great  desert--\"    \"The Libyan Desert?\" suggested Sime.    The man shook, his head, seeking for words.    \"The Arabian Desert?\"    \"No, no! Away beyond, far up in Africa\"--he waved his long arms  dramatically--\"far, far up beyond the Sudan.\"    \"The Sahara Desert?\" proposed Sime.    \"Yes, yes! it is Sahara Desert!--come across the Sahara Desert, and is  come to Khartum.\"    \"How did he get there?\" asked Cairn.    The Indian shrugged his shoulders.    \"I cannot say, but next he come to Wady Halfa, then he is in Assouan,  and from Assouan he come down to Luxor! Yesterday an Egyptian friend  told me _Khamsin_ is in the Fayum. Therefore _he_ is there--the man of  evil--for he bring the hot wind with him.\"    The Indian was growing impressive, and two American tourists stopped  to listen to his words.    \"To-night--to-morrow,\"--he spoke now almost in a whisper, glancing  about him as if apprehensive of being overheard--\"he may be here, in  Cairo, bringing with him the scorching breath of the desert--the  scorpion wind!\"    He stood up, casting off the mystery with which he had invested his  story, and smiling insinuatingly. His work was done; his fee was due.  Sime rewarded him with five piastres, and he departed, bowing.    \"You know, Sime--\" Cairn began to speak, staring absently the while  after the fortune-teller, as he descended the carpeted steps and  rejoined the throng on the sidewalk below--\"you know, if a  man--anyone, could take advantage of such a wave of thought as this  which is now sweeping through Egypt--if he could cause it to  concentrate upon him, as it were, don't you think that it would  enable him to transcend the normal, to do phenomenal things?\"    \"By what process should you propose to make yourself such a focus?\"    \"I was speaking impersonally, Sime. It might be possible--\"    \"It might be possible to dress for dinner,\" snapped Sime, \"if we shut  up talking nonsense! There's a carnival here to-night; great fun.  Suppose we concentrate our brain-waves on another Scotch and soda?\"          CHAPTER XII    THE MASK OF SET      Above the palm trees swept the jewelled vault of Egypt's sky, and set  amid the clustering leaves gleamed little red electric lamps; fairy  lanterns outlined the winding paths and paper Japanese lamps hung  dancing in long rows, whilst in the centre of the enchanted garden a  fountain spurned diamond spray high in the air, to fall back coolly  plashing into the marble home of the golden carp. The rustling of  innumerable feet upon the sandy pathway and the ceaseless murmur of  voices, with pealing laughter rising above all, could be heard amid  the strains of the military band ensconced in a flower-covered arbour.    Into the brightly lighted places and back into the luminous shadows  came and went fantastic forms. Sheikhs there were with flowing robes,  dragomans who spoke no Arabic, Sultans and priests of Ancient Egypt,  going arm-in-arm. Dancing girls of old Thebes, and harem ladies in  silken trousers and high-heeled red shoes. Queens of Babylon and  Cleopatras, many Geishas and desert Gypsies mingled, specks in a giant  kaleidoscope. The thick carpet of confetti rustled to the tread; girls  ran screaming before those who pursued them armed with handfuls of the  tiny paper disks. Pipers of a Highland regiment marched piping through  the throng, their Scottish kilts seeming wildly incongruous amid such  a scene. Within the hotel, where the mosque lanterns glowed, one might  catch a glimpse of the heads of dancers gliding shadowlike.    \"A tremendous crowd,\" said Sime, \"considering it is nearly the end of  the season.\"    Three silken ladies wearing gauzy white _yashmaks_ confronted Cairn  and the speaker. A gleaming of jewelled fingers there was and Cairn  found himself half-choked with confetti, which filled his eyes, his  nose, his ears, and of which quite a liberal amount found access to  his mouth. The three ladies of the _yashmak_ ran screaming from their  vengeance-seeking victims, Sime pursuing two, and Cairn hard upon the  heels of the third. Amid this scene of riotous carnival all else was  forgotten, and only the madness, the infectious madness of the night,  claimed his mind. In and out of the strangely attired groups darted  his agile quarry, all but captured a score of times, but always  eluding him.    Sime he had hopelessly lost, as around fountain and flower-bed, arbour  and palm trunk he leapt in pursuit of the elusive _yashmak_.    Then, in a shadowed corner of the garden, he trapped her. Plunging his  hand into the bag of confetti, which he carried, he leapt, exulting,  to his revenge: when a sudden gust of wind passed sibilantly through  the palm tops, and glancing upward, Cairn saw that the blue sky was  overcast and the stars gleaming dimly, as through a veil. That moment  of hesitancy proved fatal to his project, for with a little excited  scream the girl dived under his outstretched arm and fled back towards  the fountain. He turned to pursue again, when a second puff of wind,  stronger than the first, set waving the palm fronds and showered dry  leaves upon the confetti carpet of the garden. The band played loudly,  the murmur of conversation rose to something like a roar, but above it  whistled the increasing breeze, and there was a sort of grittiness in  the air.    Then, proclaimed by a furious lashing of the fronds above, burst the  wind in all its fury. It seemed to beat down into the garden in waves  of heat. Huge leaves began to fall from the tree tops and the  mast-like trunks bent before the fury from the desert. The atmosphere  grew hazy with impalpable dust; and the stars were wholly obscured.    Commenced a stampede from the garden. Shrill with fear, rose a woman's  scream from the heart of the throng:    \"A scorpion! a scorpion!\"    Panic threatened, but fortunately the doors were wide, so that,  without disaster the whole fantastic company passed into the hotel;  and even the military band retired.    Cairn perceived that he alone remained in the garden, and glancing  along the path in the direction of the fountain, he saw a blotchy drab  creature, fully four inches in length, running zigzag towards him. It  was a huge scorpion; but, even as he leapt forward to crush it, it  turned and crept in amid the tangle of flowers beside the path, where  it was lost from view.    The scorching wind grew momentarily fiercer, and Cairn, entering  behind a few straggling revellers, found something ominous and  dreadful in its sudden fury. At the threshold, he turned and looked  back upon the gaily lighted garden. The paper lamps were thrashing in  the wind, many extinguished; others were in flames; a number of  electric globes fell from their fastenings amid the palm tops, and  burst bomb-like upon the ground. The pleasure garden was now a  battlefield, beset with dangers, and he fully appreciated the anxiety  of the company to get within doors. Where chrysanthemum and _yashmak_  turban and _tarboosh_, uraeus and Indian plume had mingled gaily, no  soul remained; but yet--he was in error ... someone did remain.    As if embodying the fear that in a few short minutes had emptied the  garden, out beneath the waving lanterns, the flying _debris_, the  whirling dust, pacing sombrely from shadow to light, and to shadow  again, advancing towards the hotel steps, came the figure of one  sandalled, and wearing the short white tunic of Ancient Egypt. His  arms were bare, and he carried a long staff; but rising hideously upon  his shoulders was a crocodile-mask, which seemed to grin--the mask of  Set, Set the Destroyer, God of the underworld.    Cairn, alone of all the crowd, saw the strange figure, for the reason  that Cairn alone faced towards the garden. The gruesome mask seemed to  fascinate him; he could not take his gaze from that weird advancing  god; he felt impelled hypnotically to stare at the gleaming eyes set  in the saurian head. The mask was at the foot of the steps, and still  Cairn stood rigid. When, as the sandalled foot was set upon the first  step, a breeze, dust-laden, and hot as from a furnace door, blew fully  into the hotel, blinding him. A chorus arose from the crowd at his  back; and many voices cried out for doors to be shut. Someone tapped  him on the shoulder, and spun him about.    \"By God!\"--it was Sime who now had him by the arm--\"_Khamsin_ has come  with a vengeance! They tell me that they have never had anything like  it!\"    The native servants were closing and fastening the doors. The night  was now as black as Erebus, and the wind was howling about the  building with the voices of a million lost souls. Cairn glanced back  across his shoulder. Men were drawing heavy curtains across the doors  and windows.    \"They have shut him out, Sime!\" he said.    Sime stared in his dull fashion.    \"You surely saw him?\" persisted Cairn irritably; \"the man in the mask  of Set--he was coming in just behind me.\"    Sime strode forward, pulled the curtains aside, and peered out into  the deserted garden.    \"Not a soul, old man,\" he declared. \"You must have seen the Efreet!\"          CHAPTER XIII    THE SCORPION WIND      This sudden and appalling change of weather had sadly affected the  mood of the gathering. That part of the carnival planned to take place  in the garden was perforce abandoned, together with the firework  display. A halfhearted attempt was made at dancing, but the howling of  the wind, and the omnipresent dust, perpetually reminded the  pleasure-seekers that _Khamsin_ raged without--raged with a violence  unparalleled in the experience of the oldest residents. This was a  full-fledged sand-storm, a terror of the Sahara descended upon Cairo.    But there were few departures, although many of the visitors who had  long distances to go, especially those from Mena House, discussed the  advisability of leaving before this unique storm should have grown  even worse. The general tendency, though, was markedly"]]]
