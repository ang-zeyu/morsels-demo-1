In the Qur'an it is said: \"And We sent Our Spirit unto her, and He  appeared unto her in the shape of a perfect man,\"(79) meaning that the  Holy Spirit took the likeness of the human form, as an image is produced  in a mirror, and he addressed Mary.    The materialists believe that there must be marriage, and say that a  living body cannot be created from a lifeless body, and without male and  female there cannot be fecundation. And they think that not only with man,  but also with animals and plants, it is impossible. For this union of the  male and female exists in all living beings and plants. This pairing of  things is even shown forth in the Qur'an: \"Glory be to Him Who has created  all the pairs: of such things as the earth produceth, and of themselves;  and of things which they know not\"(80)--that is to say, men, animals and  plants are all in pairs--\"and of everything have We created two kinds\"--that  is to say, We have created all the beings through pairing.    Briefly, they say a man without a human father cannot be imagined. In  answer, the theologians say: \"This thing is not impossible and  unachievable, but it has not been seen; and there is a great difference  between a thing which is impossible and one which is unknown. For example,  in former times the telegraph, which causes the East and the West to  communicate, was unknown but not impossible; photography and phonography  were unknown but not impossible.\"    The materialists insist upon this belief, and the theologians reply: \"Is  this globe eternal or phenomenal?\" The materialists answer that, according  to science and important discoveries, it is established that it is  phenomenal; in the beginning it was a flaming globe, and gradually it  became temperate; a crust was formed around it, and upon this crust plants  came into existence, then animals, and finally man.    The theologians say: \"Then from your statement it has become evident and  clear that mankind is phenomenal upon the globe, and not eternal. Then  surely the first man had neither father nor mother, for the existence of  man is phenomenal. Is not the creation of man without father and mother,  even though gradually, more difficult than if he had simply come into  existence without a father? As you admit that the first man came into  existence without father or mother--whether it be gradually or at  once--there can remain no doubt that a man without a human father is also  possible and admissible; you cannot consider this impossible; otherwise,  you are illogical. For example, if you say that this lamp has once been  lighted without wick and oil, and then say that it is impossible to light  it without the wick, this is illogical.\" Christ had a mother; the first  man, as the materialists believe, had neither father nor mother.(81)          18: THE GREATNESS OF CHRIST IS DUE TO HIS PERFECTIONS      A great man is a great man, whether born of a human father or not. If  being without a father is a virtue, Adam is greater and more excellent  than all the Prophets and Messengers, for He had neither father nor  mother. That which causes honor and greatness is the splendor and bounty  of the divine perfections. The sun is born from substance and form, which  can be compared to father and mother, and it is absolute perfection; but  the darkness has neither substance nor form, neither father nor mother,  and it is absolute imperfection. The substance of Adam's physical life was  earth, but the substance of Abraham was pure sperm; it is certain that the  pure and chaste sperm is superior to earth.    Furthermore, in the first chapter of the Gospel of John, verses 12 and 13,  it is said: \"But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become  the sons of God, even to them that believed on His name:    \"Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the  will of man, but of God.\"(82)    From these verses it is obvious that the being of a disciple also is not  created by physical power, but by the spiritual reality. The honor and  greatness of Christ is not due to the fact that He did not have a human  father, but to His perfections, bounties and divine glory. If the  greatness of Christ is His being fatherless, then Adam is greater than  Christ, for He had neither father nor mother. It is said in the Old  Testament, \"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and  breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living  soul.\"(83) Observe that it is said that Adam came into existence from the  Spirit of life. Moreover, the expression which John uses in regard to the  disciples proves that they also are from the Heavenly Father. Hence it is  evident that the holy reality, meaning the real existence of every great  man, comes from God and owes its being to the breath of the Holy Spirit.    The purport is that, if to be without a father is the greatest human  glory, then Adam is greater than all, for He had neither father nor  mother. Is it better for a man to be created from a living substance or  from earth? Certainly it is better if he be created from a living  substance. But Christ was born and came into existence from the Holy  Spirit.    To conclude: the splendor and honor of the holy souls and the Divine  Manifestations come from Their heavenly perfections, bounties and glory,  and from nothing else.          19: THE BAPTISM OF CHRIST      Question.--It is said in the Gospel of St. Matthew, chapter 3, verses 13,  14, 15: \"Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be  baptized of him. But John forbade Him, saying, I have need to be baptized  of Thee, and comest Thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer  it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then  he suffered Him.\"    What is the wisdom of this: since Christ possessed all essential  perfection, why did He need baptism?    Answer.--The principle of baptism is purification by repentance. John  admonished and exhorted the people, and caused them to repent; then he  baptized them. Therefore, it is apparent that this baptism is a symbol of  repentance from all sin: its meaning is expressed in these words: \"O God!  as my body has become purified and cleansed from physical impurities, in  the same way purify and sanctify my spirit from the impurities of the  world of nature, which are not worthy of the Threshold of Thy Unity!\"  Repentance is the return from disobedience to obedience. Man, after  remoteness and deprivation from God, repents and undergoes purification:  and this is a symbol signifying \"O God! make my heart good and pure, freed  and sanctified from all save Thy love.\"    As Christ desired that this institution of John should be used at that  time by all, He Himself conformed to it in order to awaken the people and  to complete the law of the former religion. Although the ablution of  repentance was the institution of John, it was in reality formerly  practiced in the religion of God.    Christ was not in need of baptism; but as at that time it was an  acceptable and praiseworthy action, and a sign of the glad tidings of the  Kingdom, therefore, He confirmed it. However, afterward He said the true  baptism is not with material water, but it must be with spirit and with  water. In this case water does not signify material water, for elsewhere  it is explicitly said baptism is with spirit and with fire, from which it  is clear that the reference is not to material fire and material water,  for baptism with fire is impossible.    Therefore, the spirit is the bounty of God, the water is knowledge and  life, and the fire is the love of God. For material water does not purify  the heart of man; no, it cleanses his body. But the heavenly water and  spirit, which are knowledge and life, make the human heart good and pure;  the heart which receives a portion of the bounty of the Spirit becomes  sanctified, good and pure--that is to say, the reality of man becomes  purified and sanctified from the impurities of the world of nature. These  natural impurities are evil qualities: anger, lust, worldliness, pride,  lying, hypocrisy, fraud, self-love, etc.    Man cannot free himself from the rage of the carnal passions except by the  help of the Holy Spirit. That is why He says baptism with the spirit, with  water and with fire is necessary, and that it is essential--that is to say,  the spirit of divine bounty, the water of knowledge and life, and the fire  of the love of God. Man must be baptized with this spirit, this water and  this fire so as to become filled with the eternal bounty. Otherwise, what  is the use of baptizing with material water? No, this baptism with water  was a symbol of repentance, and of seeking forgiveness of sins.    But in the cycle of Baha'u'llah there is no longer need of this symbol;  for its reality, which is to be baptized with the spirit and love of God,  is understood and established.          20: THE NECESSITY OF BAPTISM      Question.--Is the ablution of baptism useful and necessary, or is it  useless and unnecessary? In the first case, if it is useful, why was it  abrogated? And in the second case, if it is useless, why did John practice  it?    Answer.--The change in conditions, alterations and transformations are  necessities of the essence of beings, and essential necessities cannot be  separated from the reality of things. So it is absolutely impossible to  separate heat from fire, humidity from water, or light from the sun, for  they are essential necessities. As the change and alteration of conditions  are necessities for beings, so laws also are changed and altered in  accordance with the changes and alterations of the times. For example, in  the time of Moses, His Law was conformed and adapted to the conditions of  the time; but in the days of Christ these conditions had changed and  altered to such an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1929"],[0,"The School for Scandal (#15)"],[1,"--I see he has premeditated a Denial by the Complaisance  of his Features.
