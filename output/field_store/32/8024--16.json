CHAPTER IX    That all things are to be referred to God, as the final end    \"My Son, I must be thy Supreme and final end, if thou desirest to  be truly happy.  Out of such purpose thy affection shall be  purified, which too often is sinfully bent upon itself and upon  created things.  For if thou seekest thyself in any matter,  straightway thou wilt fail within thyself and grow barren.  Therefore refer everything to Me first of all, for it is I who  gave thee all.  So look upon each blessing as flowing from the  Supreme Good, and thus all things are to be attributed to Me as  their source.    2. \"From Me the humble and great, the poor and the rich, draw  water as from a living fountain, and those who serve Me with a  free and faithful spirit shall receive grace for grace.  But he  who will glory apart from Me, or will be delighted with any good  which lieth in himself, shall not be established in true joy, nor  shall be enlarged in heart, but shall be greatly hindered and  thrown into tribulation.  Therefore thou must not ascribe any  good to thyself, nor look upon virtue as belonging to any man,  but ascribe it all unto God, without whom man hath nothing.  I gave all, I will receive all again, and with great strictness  require I the giving of thanks.    3. \"This is the Truth, and by it the vanity of boasting is put to  flight.  And if heavenly grace and true charity shall enter into  thee, there shall be no envy, nor straitening of the heart, nor  shall any self-love take possession of thee.  For divine charity  conquereth all things, and enlargeth all the powers of the soul.  If thou art truly wise, thou wilt rejoice in Me alone, thou wilt  hope in Me alone; for there is none good but one, that is God,(1)  Who is to be praised above all things, and in all things to  receive blessing.\"    (1) Luke xviii. 19.      CHAPTER X    That it is sweet to despise the world and to serve God    Now will I speak again, O my Lord, and hold not my peace; I will  say in the ears of my God, my Lord, and my King, who is exalted  above all, Oh how plentiful is Thy goodness which Thou hast laid  up for them that fear Thee!(1)  But what art Thou to those who  love Thee?  What to those who serve Thee with their whole heart?  Truly unspeakable is the sweetness of the contemplation of Thee,  which Thou bestowest upon those who love Thee.  In this most of  all Thou hast showed me the sweetness of Thy charity, that when I  was not, Thou madest me, and when I wandered far from Thee, Thou  broughtest me back that I might serve Thee, and commandedst me to  love Thee.    2. O Fountain of perpetual love, what shall I say concerning  Thee?  How shall I be unmindful of Thee, who didst vouchsafe to  remember me, even after I pined away and perished?  Thou hast had  mercy beyond all hope upon Thy servant, and hast showed Thy grace  and friendship beyond all deserving.  What reward shall I render  Thee for this Thy grace?  For it is not given unto all to  renounce this world and its affairs, and to take up a religious  life.  For is it a great thing that I should serve Thee, whom  every creature ought to serve?  It ought not to seem a great  thing to me to serve Thee; but rather this appeareth to me a  great and wonderful thing, that Thou vouchsafest to receive as  Thy servant one so poor and unworthy, and to join him unto Thy  chosen servants.    3. Behold all things which I have are Thine, and with them I  serve Thee.  And yet verily it is Thou who servest me, rather  than I Thee.  Behold the heaven and the earth which Thou hast  created for the service of men; they are at Thy bidding, and  perform daily whatsoever Thou dost command.  Yea, and this is  little; for Thou hast even ordained the Angels for the service of  man.  But it surpasseth even all these things, that Thou Thyself  didst vouchsafe to minister unto man, and didst promise that Thou  wouldest give Thyself unto him.    4. What shall I render unto Thee for all these Thy manifold  mercies?  Oh that I were able to serve Thee all the days of my  life!  Oh that even for one day I were enabled to do Thee service  worthy of Thyself!  For verily Thou art worthy of all service,  all honour, and praise without end.  Verily Thou art my God, and  I am Thy poor servant, who am bound to serve Thee with all my  strength, nor ought I ever to grow weary of Thy praise.  This is  my wish, this is my exceeding great desire, and whatsoever is  lacking to me, vouchsafe Thou to supply.    5. It is great honour, great glory to serve Thee, and to despise  all for Thy sake.  For they shall have great grace who of their  own will shall submit themselves to Thy most holy service.  They  who for Thy love have cast away every carnal delight shall find  the sweetest consolation of the Holy Ghost.  They who enter the  narrow way of life for Thy Name's sake, and have put away all  worldly cares, shall attain great liberty of spirit.    6. Oh grateful and delightsome service of God, whereby man is  made truly free and holy!  Oh sacred condition of the religious  servant, which maketh man equal to the Angels, well-pleasing unto  God, terrible to evil spirits, and acceptable to all faithful  ones!  Oh service to be embraced and ever desired, in which the  highest good is promised, and joy is gained which shall remain  for evermore!    (1) Psalm xxxi. 21.      CHAPTER XI    That the desires of the heart are to be examined and governed    \"My Son, thou hast still many things to learn, which thou hast  not well learned yet.\"    2. What are they, Lord?    3. \"To place thy desire altogether in subjection to My good  pleasure, and not to be a lover of thyself, but an earnest seeker  of My will.  Thy desires often excite and urge thee forward; but  consider with thyself whether thou art not more moved for thine  own objects than for My honour.  If it is Myself that thou  seekest, thou shalt be well content with whatsoever I shall  ordain; but if any pursuit of thine own lieth hidden within thee,  behold it is this which hindereth and weigheth thee down.    4. \"Beware, therefore, lest thou strive too earnestly after some  desire which thou hast conceived, without taking counsel of Me;  lest haply it repent thee afterwards, and that displease thee  which before pleased, and for which thou didst long as for a  great good.  For not every affection which seemeth good is to be  forthwith followed; neither is every opposite affection to be  immediately avoided.  Sometimes it is expedient to use restraint  even in good desires and wishes, lest through importunity thou  fall into distraction of mind, lest through want of discipline  thou become a stumbling-block to others, or lest by the  resistance of others thou be suddenly disturbed and brought to  confusion.    5. \"Sometimes, indeed, it is needful to use violence, and  manfully to strive against the sensual appetite, and not to  consider what the flesh may or not will; but rather to strive  after this, that it may become subject, however unwillingly, to  the spirit.  And for so long it ought to be chastised and  compelled to undergo slavery, even until it be ready for all  things, and learn to be contented with little, to be delighted  with things simple, and never to murmur at any inconvenience.\"      CHAPTER XII    Of the inward growth of patience, and of the struggle against  evil desires    O Lord God, I see that patience is very necessary unto me; for  many things in this life fall out contrary.  For howsoever I may  have contrived for my peace, my life cannot go on without strife  and trouble.    2. \"Thou speakest truly, My Son.  For I will not that thou seek  such a peace as is without trials, and knoweth no adversities;  but rather that thou shouldest judge thyself to have found peace,  when thou art tried with manifold tribulations, and proved by  many adversities.  If thou shalt say that thou art not able to  bear much, how then wilt thou sustain the fire hereafter?  Of two  evils we should always choose the less.  Therefore, that thou  mayest escape eternal torments hereafter, strive on God's behalf  to endure present evils bravely.  Thinkest thou that the children  of this world suffer nought, or but little?  Thou wilt not find  it so, even though thou find out the most prosperous.    3. \"'But,' thou wilt say, 'they have many delights, and they  follow their own wills, and thus they bear lightly their  tribulations.'    4. \"Be it so, grant that they have what they list; but how long,  thinkest thou, will it last?  Behold, like the smoke those who are  rich in this world will pass away, and no record shall remain of  their past joys.  Yea, even while they yet live, they rest not  without bitterness and weariness and fear.  For from the very  same thing wherein they find delight, thence they oftentimes have  the punishment of sorrow.  Justly it befalleth them, that because  out of measure they seek out and pursue pleasures, they enjoy  them not without confusion and bitterness.  Oh how short, how  false, how inordinate and wicked are all these pleasures!  Yet  because of their sottishness and blindness men do not understand;  but like brute beasts, for the sake of a little pleasure of this  corruptible life, they incur death of the soul.  Thou therefore,  my son, go not after thy lusts, but refrain thyself from thine  appetites.(1)  Delight thou in the Lord, and He shall give thee  thy heart's desire.(2)    5. \"For if thou wilt truly find delight, and be abundantly  comforted of Me, behold in the contempt of all worldly things and  in the avoidance of all worthless pleasures shall be thy  blessing, and fulness of consolation shall be given thee.  And  the more thou withdrawest thyself from all solace of creatures,  the more sweet and powerful consolations shalt thou find.  But at  the first thou shalt not attain to them, without some sorrow and  hard striving.  Long-accustomed habit will oppose, but it shall  be overcome by better habit.

We have already made mention of the chantry which Henry IV. founded  to the memory of his father and mother. Bishop Braybrooke on that  occasion gave a piece of ground, part of his palace, 36 feet by 19  feet, for the habitation of the priests attached to this chantry. And  King Henry, we are told, \"gave to the Dean and Chapter, and their  successors, for ever, divers messuages and lands, lying within  the City of London, for the anniversary of the said John, Duke of  Lancaster, his father, on the 4th day of February, and of Blanch,  his mother, on the 12th day of September yearly in this church, with  Placebo and Dirige, nine Antiphons, nine Psalms, and nine Lessons, in  the exequies of either of them; as also Mass of Requiem, with note, on  the morrow to be performed at the high altar for ever; and moreover to  distribute unto the said Dean and Chapter these several sums, viz.,  to the Dean, as often as he shall be present, three shillings and  fourpence; to the principal canons, twenty pence (to the sum of 16_s._  8_d._); to the petty canons, ten shillings; to the chaplains, twenty  shillings; to the vicars, four shillings and eightpence; to the  choristers, two shillings and sixpence; to the vergers, twelvepence;  to the bell-ringers, fourpence; to the keeper of the lamps about  the tomb of the said duke and duchess, at each of their said  anniversaries, sixpence; to the Mayor of London for the time being, in  respect of his presence at the said anniversaries, three shillings and  fourpence; to the Bishop of London, for the rent of the house where  the said chantry priests did reside, ten shillings; and for to find  eight great tapers to burn about that tomb on the day of the said  anniversaries, at the exequies, and mass on the morrow, and likewise  at the processions, masses, and vespers on every great festival, and  upon Sundays at the procession, mass, and second vespers for ever. And  lastly, to provide for those priests belonging to that chapel on the  north part of the said tomb, a certain chalice, missal, and portvoise  [Breviary] according to the Ordinale Sarum; as also vestments, bread,  wine, wax, and glasses, and other ornaments and necessaries for the  same, and repairs of their mansion.\" A few years later another chantry  was founded at the same altar for the soul of Henry IV. himself.    As years went on, the provision for all these Chantries being found  inadequate to maintain them, some were united together, and thus, at  their dissolution in the first year of Edward VI., it was found that  there were only thirty-five, to which belonged fifty-four priests.    In addition to the Chantries were the _Obits_ held by the Dean and  Canons, particular anniversaries of deaths. They varied in value  according to the donors' endowment from 4_l._ to 10_s._ Dugdale gives  a long list of them.    This cathedral was wonderfully rich in plate and jewels, so much so  that, as Dugdale says, the very inventory would fill a volume. To take  only one illustration: King John of France when he was brought here by  the Black Prince \"gave an oblation of twelve nobles at the shrine of  St. Erkenwald, the same at that of the Annunciation, twenty-six floren  nobles at the Crucifix by the north door, four basins of gold at the  high altar; and, at the hearing of Mass, after the Offertory, gave to  the Dean then officiating, five floren nobles, which the said Dean  and John Lyllington (the weekly petty canon), his assistant, had. All  which being performed, he gave, moreover, in the chapter-house, fifty  floren nobles to be distributed amongst the officers of the church.\"    With regard to the character of the services before the Reformation,  we have but few data to go upon. In 1414 Bishop Richard Clifford, with  the consent of the Dean and Chapter, ordained that from the first day  of December following, the use of Sarum should be observed. Up to that  time there had been a special \"Usus Sancti Pauli.\"    There was an organ in the church, or rather, to use the old phrase, a  \"pair of organs,\" for the instrument had a plural name like \"a pair of  bellows.\" Organs were in use in the church at any rate in the fourth  century, and were introduced into England by Archbishop Theodore. In  old times there was no official organist; the duty was taken by the  master of the choristers or one of the gentlemen of the choir. In  churches of the regular foundation a monk played.    English Church music, in its proper sense, began with the Reformation.  In the Roman Church, the great genius of Palestrina had produced  nothing less than a revolution as regards the ancient Plain Song; and  with the English Liturgy we associate the honoured names of Tallis,  Merbecke, Byrd, Farrant in the early days, and a splendid list of  successors right down to our time, wherein is still no falling off.  Tallis is supposed by Rimbault to have been a pupil of Mulliner, the  organist of St. Paul's, but there is no evidence to support this. It  must be confessed that his service in the Dorian mode, which heads the  collection in Boyce's Cathedral Music, and which is indeed the first  harmonised setting of the Canticles ever composed for the English  Liturgy, is very dull, but his harmony of the Litany and of the  Versicles after the Creed, has never been equalled for beauty. His  Canon tune, to which we sing Ken's Evening Hymn, is also unsurpassed,  and his anthem, \"If ye love Me,\" is one of wonderful sweetness and  devout feeling. John Redford was his contemporary, and was organist  of St. Paul's, 1530-1540. His anthem, \"Rejoice in the Lord,\" is as  impressive and stately as Tallis's that I have just named. It is  frequently sung at St. Paul's still. William Byrd was senior chorister  of St. Paul's in 1554. I hold his service in D minor to be the finest  which had as yet been set to the Reformed Liturgy--the Nicene Creed  in particular is of marvellous beauty. Tallis had not attempted  \"expression\" in his setting of the Canticles. The meaning seems to  breathe all through Byrd's harmonies. I did not know until I read Sir  George Grove's article upon him, that Byrd secretly remained a Roman  Catholic, but I long ago made up my mind, on my own judgment, that his  most pathetic anthem, \"Bow thine ear,\" was a wail over the iconoclasm  in St. Paul's. He died in extreme old age in 1623. Morley was another  organist of St. Paul's, the author of a fine setting of the Burial  Service. Paul Hentzner, who visited St. Paul's in 1598, says in his  _Itinerary_, \"It has a very fine organ, which at evensong, accompanied  with other instruments, makes excellent music.\"    Concerning the dramatic performances which went on in the cathedral at  certain times, there is nothing peculiar to St. Paul's that I know  of to mention. These performances were originally intended for  instruction, pictorial representations of scenes from the Bible and  Church History, but often degenerating into coarse buffoonery and  horseplay. The \"Boy Bishop\" was for many generations an established  institution. One ceremony there was, peculiar to St. Paul's, namely,  \"The Offering of a Buck and Doe.\" Sir William le Baud in 1328 made a  yearly grant to the Dean and Canons of a doe to be presented on the  Feast of the Conversion of St. Paul, and of a fat buck to be offered  at the midsummer commemoration of the same Apostle.    These were to be offered at the high altar by Sir William and his  descendants, and afterwards to be distributed among the Canons  resident. This gift was in acknowledgment of a grant which they had  made him of twenty-two acres of land adjoining his park in Essex.  There was a grand ceremonial on each occasion, the Canons wore their  best vestments and garlands of flowers, and there was a procession  round the church, with the horns of the buck carried on a spear, and  a great noise of horn-blowers. Camden describes it all, as an  eye-witness. This festivity came to an end in the reign of Queen  Elizabeth.    [Illustration: BISHOP AND CANONS IN THE CHURCH OF ST. GREGORY-BY-ST.  PAUL. _From a MS. of Lydgate's Life of St. Edmund. British Museum,  Harl. 2278._]    Our illustration, showing the costume of the clergy of St. Paul's, is  taken from a MS. of Lydgate's _Life of St. Edmund_, written in the  fifteenth century, and decorated with many miniatures. It represents  the coffin of St. Edmund temporarily deposited in the church of St.  Gregory-by-St. Paul's (having been brought up from Bury for safety  during an incursion of the Danes), and an attempt by the Bishop and  Canons to secure so precious a relic for the cathedral. Here is  Lydgate's metrical version of the story, telling how the attempt was  frustrated by the Saint himself.      He cam to Londene toward eve late,    At whos komyng blynde men kauhte syht.
