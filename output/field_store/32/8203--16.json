The least I can do for you is to give you a clear field  and not interfere, so I am off to New York by to-night's  boat.    I went round to Percy's to try to grovel in the dust  before him, but he wouldn't see me. It's no good  grovelling in the dust of the front steps for the benefit  of a man who's in bed on the second floor, so I withdrew  in more or less good order. I then got the present idea.  Mark how all things work together for good. When they come  to you and say \"No title for you. Your son slugged our pal  Percy,\" all you have to do is to come back at them with \"I  know my son slugged Percy, and believe me I didn't do a  thing to him! I packed him off to America within  twenty-four hours. Get me right, boys! I'm anti-Jimmy and  pro-Percy.\" To which their reply will be \"Oh, well, in  that case arise, Lord Crocker!\" or whatever they say when  slipping a title to a deserving guy. So you will see that  by making this getaway I am doing the best I can to put  things straight. I shall give this to Bayliss to give to  you. I am going to call him up on the phone in a minute to  have him pack a few simple tooth-brushes and so on for me.  On landing in New York, I shall instantly proceed to the  Polo Grounds to watch a game of Rounders, and will cable  you the full score. Well. I think that's about all. So  good-bye--or even farewell--for the present.    J.    P.S. I know you'll understand, dad. I'm doing what seems  to me the only possible thing. Don't worry about me. I  shall be all right. I'll get back my old job and be a  terrific success all round. You go ahead and get that  title and then meet me at the entrance of the Polo  Grounds. I'll be looking for you.    P.P.S. I'm a worm.      The young clerk at the steamship offices appeared rejoiced to see  Jimmy once more. With a sunny smile he snatched a pencil from his  ear and plunged it into the vitals of the Atlantic.    \"How about E. a hundred and eight?\"    \"Suits me.\"    \"You're too late to go in the passenger-list, of course.\"    Jimmy did not reply. He was gazing rigidly at a girl who had just  come in, a girl with red hair and a friendly smile.    \"So you're sailing on the _Atlantic_, too!\" she said, with a glance  at the chart on the counter. \"How odd! We have just decided to go  back on her too. There's nothing to keep us here and we're all  homesick. Well, you see I wasn't run over after I left you.\"    A delicious understanding relieved Jimmy's swimming brain, as  thunder relieves the tense and straining air. The feeling that he  was going mad left him, as the simple solution of his mystery  came to him. This girl must have heard of him in New  York--perhaps she knew people whom he knew and it was on hearsay,  not on personal acquaintance, that she based that dislike of him  which she had expressed with such freedom and conviction so short  a while before at the Regent Grill. She did not know who he was!    Into this soothing stream of thought cut the voice of the clerk.    \"What name, please?\"    Jimmy's mind rocked again. Why were these things happening to him  to-day of all days, when he needed the tenderest treatment, when  he had a headache already?    The clerk was eyeing him expectantly. He had laid down his pencil  and was holding aloft a pen. Jimmy gulped. Every name in the  English language had passed from his mind. And then from out of  the dark came inspiration.    \"Bayliss,\" he croaked.    The girl held out her hand.    \"Then we can introduce ourselves at last. My name is Ann Chester.  How do you do, Mr. Bayliss?\"    \"How do you do, Miss Chester?\"    The clerk had finished writing the ticket, and was pressing  labels and a pink paper on him. The paper, he gathered dully, was  a form and had to be filled up. He examined it, and found it to  be a searching document. Some of its questions could be answered  off-hand, others required thought.    \"Height?\" Simple. Five foot eleven.    \"Hair?\" Simple. Brown.    \"Eyes?\" Simple again. Blue.    Next, queries of a more offensive kind.    \"Are you a polygamist?\"    He could answer that. Decidedly no. One wife would be  ample--provided she had red-gold hair, brown-gold eyes, the right  kind of mouth, and a dimple. Whatever doubts there might be in  his mind on other points, on that one he had none whatever.    \"Have you ever been in prison?\"    Not yet.    And then a very difficult one. \"Are you a lunatic?\"    Jimmy hesitated. The ink dried on his pen. He was wondering.                          *   *   *      In the dim cavern of Paddington Station the boat-train snorted  impatiently, varying the process with an occasional sharp shriek.  The hands of the station clock pointed to ten minutes to six. The  platform was a confused mass of travellers, porters, baggage,  trucks, boys with buns and fruits, boys with magazines, friends,  relatives, and Bayliss the butler, standing like a faithful  watchdog beside a large suitcase. To the human surf that broke  and swirled about him he paid no attention. He was looking for  the young master.    Jimmy clove the crowd like a one-man flying-wedge. Two fruit and  bun boys who impeded his passage drifted away like leaves on an  Autumn gale.    \"Good man!\" He possessed himself of the suitcase. \"I was afraid  you might not be able to get here.\"    \"The mistress is dining out, Mr. James. I was able to leave the  house.\"    \"Have you packed everything I shall want?\"    \"Within the scope of a suitcase, yes, sir.\"    \"Splendid! Oh, by the way, give this letter to my father, will  you?\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    \"I'm glad you were able to manage. I thought your voice sounded  doubtful over the phone.\"    \"I was a good deal taken aback, Mr. James. Your decision to leave  was so extremely sudden.\"    \"So was Columbus'. You know about him? He saw an egg standing on  its head and whizzed off like a jack-rabbit.\"    \"If you will pardon the liberty, Mr. James, is it not a little  rash--?\"    \"Don't take the joy out of life, Bayliss. I may be a chump, but  try to forget it. Use your willpower.\"    \"Good evening, Mr. Bayliss,\" said a voice behind them. They both  turned. The butler was gazing rather coyly at a vision in a grey  tailor-made suit.    \"Good evening, miss,\" he said doubtfully.    Ann looked at him in astonishment, then broke into a smile.    \"How stupid of me! I meant this Mr. Bayliss. Your son! We met at  the steamship offices. And before that he saved my life. So we  are old friends.\"    Bayliss, gaping perplexedly and feeling unequal to the  intellectual pressure of the conversation, was surprised further  to perceive a warning scowl on the face of his Mr. James. Jimmy  had not foreseen this thing, but he had a quick mind and was  equal to it.    \"How are you, Miss Chester? My father has come down to see me  off. This is Miss Chester, dad.\"    A British butler is not easily robbed of his poise, but Bayliss  was frankly unequal to the sudden demand on his presence of mind.  He lowered his jaw an inch or two, but spoke no word.    \"Dad's a little upset at my going,\" whispered Jimmy  confidentially. \"He's not quite himself.\"    Ann was a girl possessed not only of ready tact but of a kind  heart. She had summed up Mr. Bayliss at a glance. Every line of  him proclaimed him a respectable upper servant. No girl on earth  could have been freer than she of snobbish prejudice, but she  could not check a slight thrill of surprise and disappointment at  the discovery of Jimmy's humble origin. She understood everything,  and there were tears in her eyes as she turned away to avoid  intruding on the last moments of the parting of father and son.    \"I'll see you on the boat, Mr. Bayliss,\" she said.    \"Eh?\" said Bayliss.    \"Yes, yes,\" said Jimmy. \"Good-bye till then.\"    Ann walked on to her compartment. She felt as if she had just read  a whole long novel, one of those chunky younger-English-novelist  things. She knew the whole story as well as if it had been told  to her in detail. She could see the father, the honest steady  butler, living his life with but one aim, to make a gentleman of  his beloved only son. Year by year he had saved. Probably he had  sent the son to college. And now, with a father's blessing and  the remains of a father's savings, the boy was setting out for  the New World, where dollar-bills grew on trees and no one asked  or cared who any one else's father might be.    There was a lump in her throat. Bayliss would have been amazed if  he could have known what a figure of pathetic fineness he seemed  to her. And then her thoughts turned to Jimmy, and she was aware  of a glow of kindliness towards him. His father had succeeded in  his life's ambition. He had produced a gentleman! How easily and  simply, without a trace of snobbish shame, the young man had  introduced his father. There was the right stuff in him. He was  not ashamed of the humble man who had given him his chance in  life. She found herself liking Jimmy amazingly . . .    The hands of the clock pointed to three minutes to the hour.  Porters skimmed to and fro like water-beetles.    \"I can't explain,\" said Jimmy. \"It wasn't temporary insanity; it  was necessity.\"    \"Very good, Mr. James. I think you had better be taking your seat  now.\"    \"Quite right, I had. It would spoil the whole thing if they left  me behind. Bayliss, did you ever see such eyes? Such hair! Look  after my father while I am away. Don't let the dukes worry him.  Oh, and, Bayliss\"--Jimmy drew his hand from his pocket--\"as one  pal to another--\"    Bayliss looked at the crackling piece of paper.    \"I couldn't, Mr. James, I really couldn't! A five-pound note! I  couldn't!\"    \"Nonsense! Be a sport!\"    \"Begging your pardon, Mr. James, I really couldn't. You cannot  afford to throw away your money like this. You cannot have a  great deal of it, if you will excuse me for saying so.\"    \"I won't do anything of the sort. Grab it!

It was commenced by the Stranger  with some impatience at the lengthiness of my introductory process.    STRANGER.  Have you felt me enough by this time?  Are you not  introduced to me yet?    I.  Most illustrious Sir, excuse my awkwardness, which arises not from  ignorance of the usages of polite society, but from a little surprise  and nervousness, consequent on this somewhat unexpected visit.  And I  beseech you to reveal my indiscretion to no one, and especially not to  my Wife.  But before your Lordship enters into further communications,  would he deign to satisfy the curiosity of one who would gladly know  whence his Visitor came?    STRANGER.  From Space, from Space, Sir:  whence else?    I.  Pardon me, my Lord, but is not your Lordship already in Space, your  Lordship and his humble servant, even at this moment?    STRANGER.  Pooh! what do you know of Space?  Define Space.    I.  Space, my Lord, is height and breadth indefinitely prolonged.    STRANGER.  Exactly:  you see you do not even know what Space is.  You  think it is of Two Dimensions only; but I have come to announce to you  a Third--height, breadth, and length.    I.  Your Lordship is pleased to be merry.  We also speak of length and  height, or breadth and thickness, thus denoting Two Dimensions by four  names.    STRANGER.  But I mean not only three names, but Three Dimensions.    I.  Would your Lordship indicate or explain to me in what direction is  the Third Dimension, unknown to me?    STRANGER.  I came from it.  It is up above and down below.    I.  My Lord means seemingly that it is Northward and Southward.    STRANGER.  I mean nothing of the kind.  I mean a direction in which you  cannot look, because you have no eye in your side.    I.  Pardon me, my Lord, a moment's inspection will convince your  Lordship that I have a perfect luminary at the juncture of two of my  sides.    STRANGER.  Yes:  but in order to see into Space you ought to have an  eye, not on your Perimeter, but on your side, that is, on what you  would probably call your inside; but we in Spaceland should call it  your side.    I.  An eye in my inside!  An eye in my stomach!  Your Lordship jests.    STRANGER.  I am in no jesting humour.  I tell you that I come from  Space, or, since you will not understand what Space means, from the  Land of Three Dimensions whence I but lately looked down upon your  Plane which you call Space forsooth.  From that position of advantage I  discerned all that you speak of as SOLID (by which you mean \"enclosed  on four sides\"), your houses, your churches, your very chests and  safes, yes even your insides and stomachs, all lying open and exposed  to my view.    I.  Such assertions are easily made, my Lord.    STRANGER.  But not easily proved, you mean.  But I mean to prove mine.    When I descended here, I saw your four Sons, the Pentagons, each in his  apartment, and your two Grandsons the Hexagons; I saw your youngest  Hexagon remain a while with you and then retire to his room, leaving  you and your Wife alone.  I saw your Isosceles servants, three in  number, in the kitchen at supper, and the little Page in the scullery.  Then I came here, and how do you think I came?    I.  Through the roof, I suppose.    STRANGER.  Not so.  Your roof, as you know very well, has been recently  repaired, and has no aperture by which even a Woman could penetrate.  I  tell you I come from Space.  Are you not convinced by what I have told  you of your children and household?    I.  Your Lordship must be aware that such facts touching the belongings  of his humble servant might be easily ascertained by any one in the  neighbourhood possessing your Lordship's ample means of obtaining  information.    STRANGER.  (TO HIMSELF.)  What must I do?  Stay; one more argument  suggests itself to me.  When you see a Straight Line--your wife, for  example--how many Dimensions do you attribute to her?    I.  Your Lordship would treat me as if I were one of the vulgar who,  being ignorant of Mathematics, suppose that a Woman is really a  Straight Line, and only of One Dimension.  No, no, my Lord; we Squares  are better advised, and are as well aware as your Lordship that a  Woman, though popularly called a Straight Line, is, really and  scientifically, a very thin Parallelogram, possessing Two Dimensions,  like the rest of us, viz., length and breadth (or thickness).    STRANGER.  But the very fact that a Line is visible implies that it  possesses yet another Dimension.    I.  My Lord, I have just acknowledged that a Woman is broad as well as  long.  We see her length, we infer her breadth; which, though very  slight, is capable of measurement.    STRANGER.  You do not understand me.  I mean that when you see a Woman,  you ought--besides inferring her breadth--to see her length, and to SEE  what we call her HEIGHT; although that last Dimension is infinitesimal  in your country.  If a Line were mere length without \"height\", it would  cease to occupy Space and would become invisible.  Surely you must  recognize this?    I.  I must indeed confess that I do not in the least understand your  Lordship.  When we in Flatland see a Line, we see length and  BRIGHTNESS.  If the brightness disappears, the Line is extinguished,  and, as you say, ceases to occupy Space.  But am I to suppose that your  Lordship gives to brightness the title of a Dimension, and that what we  call \"bright\" you call \"high\"?    STRANGER.  No, indeed.  By \"height\" I mean a Dimension like your  length:  only, with you, \"height\" is not so easily perceptible, being  extremely small.    I.  My Lord, your assertion is easily put to the test.  You say I have  a Third Dimension, which you call \"height\".  Now, Dimension implies  direction and measurement.  Do but measure my \"height\", or merely  indicate to me the direction in which my \"height\" extends, and I will  become your convert.  Otherwise, your Lordship's own understanding must  hold me excused.    STRANGER.  (TO HIMSELF.)  I can do neither.  How shall I convince him?  Surely a plain statement of facts followed by ocular demonstration  ought to suffice. --Now, Sir; listen to me.    You are living on a Plane.  What you style Flatland is the vast level  surface of what I may call a fluid, on, or in, the top of which you and  your countrymen move about, without rising above it or falling below it.    I am not a plane Figure, but a Solid.  You call me a Circle; but in  reality I am not a Circle, but an infinite number of Circles, of size  varying from a Point to a Circle of thirteen inches in diameter, one  placed on the top of the other.  When I cut through your plane as I am  now doing, I make in your plane a section which you, very rightly, call  a Circle.  For even a Sphere--which is my proper name in my own  country--if he manifest himself at all to an inhabitant of  Flatland--must needs manifest himself as a Circle.    Do you not remember--for I, who see all things, discerned last night  the phantasmal vision of Lineland written upon your brain--do you not  remember, I say, how, when you entered the realm of Lineland, you were  compelled to manifest yourself to the King, not as a Square, but as a  Line, because that Linear Realm had not Dimensions enough to represent  the whole of you, but only a slice or section of you?  In precisely the  same way, your country of Two Dimensions is not spacious enough to  represent me, a being of Three, but can only exhibit a slice or section  of me, which is what you call a Circle.    The diminished brightness of your eye indicates incredulity.  But now  prepare to receive proof positive of the truth of my assertions.  You  cannot indeed see more than one of my sections, or Circles, at a time;  for you have no power to raise your eye out of the plane of Flatland;  but you can at least see that, as I rise in Space, so my sections  become smaller.  See now, I will rise; and the effect upon your eye  will be that my Circle will become smaller and smaller till it dwindles  to a point and finally vanishes.

I winked once or twice to make sure that I was not dreaming.  But it was no dream.  For from the depths of nowhere came forth a  hollow voice--close to my heart it seemed--\"Am I quite gone?  Are you  convinced now?  Well, now I will gradually return to Flatland and you  shall see my section become larger and larger.\"    Every reader in Spaceland will easily understand that my mysterious  Guest was speaking the language of truth and even of simplicity.
