When Birinus was consecrated by the Bishop of  Milan, he was not assigned any exact territorial jurisdiction, as was  only natural, seeing that he was a missionary to a little-known land. He  met, however, with a rapid success, and in 635 performed the baptism of  Cynegils, king of the West Saxons, on the day of his marriage to the  daughter of the Northumbrian king. The town of Dorchester on the borders  of Mercia was immediately assigned to Birinus as a bishop's seat. But  when Aegelberht had succeeded him, the next king, Cenwalh, made a  division of the kingdom into two distinct dioceses of Dorchester and  Winchester, the new creation being assigned in 661 to Wina; who,  however, succeeded to the whole of the original diocese, as Aegelberht  appears to have left England in disgust. Eleutherius, Wina's successor,  continued to hold the still united offices at Dorchester, and it was not  until Hedda became bishop, about 679 A.D., that Winchester was really  made the seat of a diocese. Even Hedda continued to rule all from  Winchester, and not before his death was a permanent division of sees  carried out. Winchester retained Surrey, Sussex, and the Southampton  district; while the other counties were assigned to Sherborne--Dorchester,  which belonged more properly to Mercia, having been taken away, as there  was no longer the same need of an inland centre to the see, with four  bishops now in Mercia. Sussex was also taken from the Winchester diocese  during the episcopacy of Daniel, Hedda's successor, and by way of  compensation he was only able to add the Isle of Wight, hitherto  unattached to any see. When the West Saxon kingdom became, in the ninth  century, practically the kingdom of England, Winchester, of course,  assumed a very important position. S. Swithun, who was chosen as bishop  in 852, had great influence with King Ethelwulf, and his cathedral  correspondingly became an object of veneration. The see suffered,  however, from the Danish raids which occurred during the next two  reigns; but with Bishop Athelwold its prestige was quite restored. To  him is due the establishment of a Benedictine monastery at Winchester,  the previous convent having been one of secular (and non-celibate)  canons. With the supremacy of the Danes, we find Cnut both elected king  and subsequently buried at Winchester. Edward the Confessor, moreover,  was crowned in the cathedral on Easter Day, 1043, so that Winchester  maintained its position well up to this date. Further invasions of the  Northmen then very much wasted the south coast, and gradually Winchester  began to yield its pride of place to Westminster.    However, the town remained a place of considerable importance, for, as  Mr H. Hall says in his \"Antiquities of the Exchequer,\" \"although  Westminster possessed an irresistible attraction to a pious sovereign  through the vicinity of a favoured church, Norman kings, engrossed in  the pleasure of the chase and constantly embroiled in Continental wars,  found the ancient capital of Winchester better adapted for the pursuit  of sport, as well as for the maintenance of their foreign communications  through the proximity of the great mediaeval seaport, Southampton.\" This  traffic between London and the two Hampshire towns passed through  Southwark, which always had a close connection with Winchester,  remaining even to this day in a modified degree. The Norman bishops, if  they found Winchester no longer the chief town of England, certainly  added to the glory of the church by the erection and beautifying of a  new cathedral. Immediately after the death of Walkelin, the first bishop  of the conquering race, there was a vacancy in the see which lasted for  nine years, owing to the vexed question of investiture. When Giffard was  finally installed, he displayed considerable activity. Among his other  works, he built the town residence of the bishops of Winchester at  Southwark. Bishop's Waltham remained the principal residence until its  destruction by Waller in 1644, after which Farnham Castle took its  place.    Rumour says that there was a suggestion made of raising the see of  Winchester to the rank of an archbishopric during its tenure by that  foremost of fighting churchmen, Henry de Blois, who certainly desired  the elevation. At any rate, Fuller says of Henry that he \"outshined  Theobald, Archbishop of Canterbury.\" The Pope's consent, however, was  not secured. Henry paid considerable attention to the temporal affairs  of his see, rebuilding the castles at Farnham and Wolvesey, and founding  the Hospital of St Cross. He translated also the bodies of the old kings  and bishops from the site of the Saxon crypt, the remains without  inscriptions being placed in leaden sarcophagi, mixed in hopeless  confusion. After Henry's death there occurred another vacancy in the  see, ended at last by the admittance of Toclive in 1174 A.D.    With De Lucy's accession in 1189 we reach another epoch of building  activity, for not only was this bishop busy himself, but also under his  guidance there was instituted in 1202, as the Winchester annalist  records, a confraternity, to last for five years, for repairing the  cathedral. De Lucy's work at the eastern end of the building is  described elsewhere. We should not omit to notice, when considering the  position of Winchester, that Richard, on his return from captivity in  1194, was re-crowned here on the octave of Easter Day.    Bishop de Rupibus, De Lucy's successor, introduced preaching friars into  England, and set up at Winchester in 1225 a Dominican establishment,  while a few years later the Franciscans were also established here. Both  institutions have since vanished.    The middle of the thirteenth century was marked at Winchester by  continual struggles between king, monks, and Pope, as to the right of  electing the bishop of Winchester. Some record of these struggles will  be found in the list of bishops of the see. The contest about the  election of De Raleigh lasted five years, and the king only finally  accepted the monks' choice after the Pope and the king of France had  also lent their influence on his behalf. In 1264-7 the town rose up  against the prior and convent, burning and murdering under pretext of  assisting the king, the bishop being a partisan of De Montfort. After  the battle of Evesham the cathedral was laid under an interdict by the  Papal legate, Ottoboni, and this was not removed until August 1267.    With Wykeham's importance in the story of Winchester we have dealt  elsewhere. His successor, Beaufort, greatly enlarged the foundation of  St Cross, adding to it his \"Almshouse of Noble Poverty.\" It is a  remarkable fact that these two bishops and Waynflete, the founder of  Magdalen College, Oxford, between them occupied the see for no less than  120 years. The history of this period, as far as the cathedral is  concerned, is mainly architectural and therefore uneventful in  comparison with that of the earlier times. The intervals whose history  is less stirring, however, fortunately leave far better marks on the  actual buildings than do the more eventful epochs; and the fact that  Cardinal Wolsey once was Bishop of Winchester could not be gathered from  the cathedral itself. Indeed, he never visited the town at all during  the course of his episcopate--a circumstance which is, perhaps, hardly  to be regretted.    In 1500 Pope Alexander issued a Bull separating the Channel Islands from  their former see of Coutances, which was now no longer English  territory, and attaching them to the see of Salisbury. \"This was  afterwards altered to Winchester,\" says Canon Benham, \"but from some  cause which does not appear, the transfer was never made until 1568,  after the Reformed Liturgy has been established in the islands.\" The  cathedral itself received architectural additions during this period  from Bishops Courtenay and Langton, their priors, and Bishop Fox. When  in Henry VIII.'s reign the former town of Southwark had either been  conveyed to the city or had become the king's property (the latter being  such parts as had previously been the holding of Canterbury), the  \"Clink,\" or the Bishop of Winchester's Liberty, was not interfered with.  The result of this was that the Clink became the home of the early  play-houses--the Globe, Hope, Rose, and Swan--since within the city  bounds actors were not allowed to carry on their profession. In Mr T.  Fairman Ordish's \"Early London Theatres\" the extent to which the first  theatres flourished in the Winchester Liberty may be clearly seen.    The early Reformation period at Winchester led to a great impoverishment  of the see: so much so that the second William of Wickham (1594-5)  ventured, in a sermon preached before the queen, to say that, should the  see continue to suffer such rapine as it had already undergone in her  reign, there would soon be no means to keep the roof on the cathedral  building. We do not know that this remonstrance produced much effect,  for the cathedral and its revenues underwent many losses after this. The  ravages of the Parliamentarians, however, which were the most serious,  have been alluded to elsewhere.    It appears from \"the old Valor printed 1685,\" which was quoted by Browne  Willis in his \"Survey of the Cathedrals\" of 1742, that some dioceses  about Calais used once to belong to Winchester. We learn also from  Browne Willis that in his time the see of Winchester contained \"the  whole County of Southampton, with the Isle of Wight, and one parish in  Wiltshire, viz. Wiltesbury: It has also all Surrey, except 11 churches  in Croyden Deanry which are peculiars of the See of Canterbury. Here are  two Archdeacons, viz. 1. Winchester, valued at 61l. 15s. 2d. for  First-Fruits, which has all the Deanries in the County of Southampton  and the Isle of Wight. 2."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20348"],[0,"The Moving Picture Girls in War Plays (#15)"],[1,"gstore. \"I  guess it's the horse; he is so bony he has many fine points about him,  as Russ said. And we're queer looking in these costumes ourselves.\"    When they alighted at the pharmacy and started in, they became aware of  the growing sensation they were creating. For a little throng had  gathered in front of the store, and more men and boys came running up,  to form in two lines--a living lane--through which Alice and Estelle had  to pass.    \"We certainly are creating a sensation,\" gasped Alice, growing  embarrassed.    \"Look! a regular bridal crowd,\" said Estelle in a low voice.    Though they undeniably presented a pretty picture in their paint,  powder, curls and hoopskirts, they were also an unusual one for that  little country village.    \"Look at the society swells!\" cried one boy.    \"Dat's de new fashion--makin' your nose look like a flour barrel!\" added  another.    \"Aren't those dresses sweet?\" sighed a girl.    \"They must be the latest New York style,\" added a companion. \"I heard  that full skirts were coming in again.\"    \"Well, ours are certainly full enough,\" murmured Alice, looking down at  her swaying hoops.    And then some one guessed the truth.    \"They're actresses--the movie actresses!\" came the cry, and this  attracted more attention than ever, for if there is one person about  whom the American public is curious, it is the actor.    \"Oh my!\" exclaimed Estelle, \"now we are in for it. Hurry inside the  store!\"    The girls fairly ran into the friendly shelter, and some of the crowd  attempted to follow, but the drug clerks barred the way, guessing what  the excitement was about.    \"Dr. Wherry!\" gasped Alice. \"Is he here?\"    \"Right back there--in the prescription department,\" a clerk said. \"Which  of you is ill?\"    \"Neither one!\" cried Estelle. \"We want him for a man out at Oak Farm.  He's been shot--an accident in the play. Tell him to hurry, please, and  then show us some way of getting out through a side door. I can't face  that crowd--this way,\" and she looked down at her elaborate hoop-skirted  costume, which might have been all right in the days of sixty-three, but  which was unique at the present time.    \"What's the trouble?\" asked Dr. Wherry, coming from behind the  ground-glass partition. \"Oh, Miss DeVere and Miss Brown!\" he went on as  he recognized the moving picture girls. \"Is some one hurt?\"    They told him quickly what the trouble was, and he cried:    \"I'll go at once. You'd better come back with me in the auto if you  don't want to run the gauntlet of the staring crowd. I'll bring my  machine around to the side door.\"    \"What about the horse we drove over?\" asked Alice.    \"I'll have Mr. Pertell send a man for that.\"    The girls, in their curiosity-exciting costumes, managed to slip out the  side door and into the doctor's automobile without attracting the  attention of the crowd. Then they made the trip back in good time and  comfort.    \"And to think we never for a moment thought of changing our things!\"  cried Alice, when they were at Oak Farm again.    \"Or even of rubbing off some of the make-up,\" added Estelle. \"But we  were so excited--at least I was--when I saw the poor fellow hurt. I hope  it is not serious.\"    \"No, he's lost a little blood, that's all,\" said Dr. Wherry. \"But I  thought you were used to such scenes, Miss Brown, coming from the West,  as you did.\"    \"I from the West? Oh, yes, I have been there. Come on, Alice, let's see  if they still want us for anything, and, if they don't, we'll change our  clothes,\" and Estelle seemed glad of a chance to hurry away.    \"I wonder,\" said Alice to her sister afterward, \"whether she is really  so squeamish as she pretends, or if she doesn't want it known that she  is from the West?\"    \"It's hard to say. Estelle is acting more and more queerly every day, I  think.\"    \"So do I. Though I am quite in love with her. She has such a sweet  disposition.\"    \"Yes, she is a lovely girl. I only wish there wasn't that bit of mystery  about her.\"    \"And it is a mystery,\" went on Alice. \"Every once in a while I catch  Lieutenant Varley looking at her, when he thinks he isn't observed, and  he shakes his head as though he could not understand it at all.\"    \"Then you think he still feels sure she is the girl he met in Portland?\"    \"I'm positive he does, and he isn't doing it to further his own ends and  force an acquaintance with her, either. He honestly believes he has met  her before.\"    \"Well, it is very strange. But she doesn't seem to want to talk about  anything connected with her past.\"    \"No, and I suppose we should not try to force matters.\"    The man who was shot was soon out of danger, and, meanwhile, the taking  of the war scenes went on with some one else in his place. A number of  sham engagements had been fought, all working up to the big final  battle, in which Ruth would play her part as an army nurse, and Alice  would act as the spy. Estelle, too, had been given a rather important  part, much to the annoyance of Miss Dixon, who had been expecting it.    The vaudeville actress made sneering and cutting remarks about \"extra  players butting in,\" and there were veiled insinuations concerning the  missing ring, but Estelle took no notice, and Alice, Ruth and her other  friends stood loyally by her.    \"We'll film that burning barn scene to-day,\" said Mr. Pertell one  morning at the breakfast table, when he had ascertained that the  atmospheric conditions were right. \"That's the one where you two DeVere  girls are surprised on your little farm by the visit of some Union  soldiers. You have been caring for a wounded cousin, who has escaped  through the Union lines, and at the news that the Yankees are coming you  hide him in the barn. Then the Unionists set fire to it, and you girls  have to drag him out.    \"There'll be no danger, of course, for the fire won't be near you--in  fact, the barn won't burn at all--only a shack nailed to it. And the  smoke will be from the regular bomb. You have plenty of them, haven't  you, Pop Snooks?\"    \"Oh yes, plenty of smoke bombs, Mr. Pertell.\"    All was soon in readiness for the burning-barn scene. Ruth and Alice  received the wounded cousin (an inside scene this) and then, when an old  colored mammie (Mrs. Maguire) came panting with the news that the  Yankees were coming, the wounded Confederate was carried out to the  barn. Then came the visit of the Yankees, who, suspecting the presence  of the escaped prisoner, made diligent search, but without success.    \"Fire the barn, anyhow!\" cried the captain.    Then came the spirited scene where Ruth and Alice got their wounded  relative out. He was a slim young man, and they could easily carry him,  for he was supposed to be overcome by the smoke.    \"Ready, Alice?\" asked Ruth, as they went through the action called for  in the script.    \"Yes, ready. You take his head and I'll take his heels. Don't be too  stiff,\" Alice admonished the young man. \"We can carry you better if  you're limp.\"    \"I'll be limp enough if I swallow any more of that smoke,\" choked the  actor. \"It's fierce!\"    Indeed, Pop Snooks had been very liberal in the matter of smoke bombs.  Great clouds of the black vapor swirled here and there, and Ruth and  Alice had to get free breaths whenever they could.    \"Come on!\" yelled the director through his megaphone. \"Lively!\"    Alice and Ruth, half carrying, half dragging, the wounded soldier,  staggered out, Russ clicking away at the camera.    \"Good! That's good! It's fine!\" exclaimed the enthusiastic director.    Ruth was conscious that she was suddenly dragging more of the weight of  the man's body than at first. But she thought one of Alice's hands had  possibly slipped off, and she did not want to call a halt to get a  better hold.    \"My! But this is choking!\" gasped Ruth.    Finally, she staggered out into the open, dragging the soldier by his  shoulders. She slumped down on the ground, in a place free from smoke,  and registered exhaustion.    \"Where's Alice?\" cried Paul, who was holding back in readiness for his  appearance in the scene. \"Where's Alice?\"    \"Isn't she there?\" gasped Ruth, rising on her elbow.    \"No, she isn't. She must be----\"    \"Hold that pose, Ruth! Don't stir or you'll spoil the scene!\" yelled the  director. \"We'll get your sister!\"          CHAPTER XV    THE HOSPITAL TENT      \"The show must go on!\" This is the motto of circus and theatrical  performers the world over. No matter what happens, under what strain or  pain the player labors, no matter what occurs short of death itself, the  public must not be allowed to guess that anything is wrong. And  sometimes even death itself has been no barrier--for players have gone  through with their parts on the stage when, but the act previous, they  have learned that some loved one had passed away.    And more than one clown has bounded into the sawdust ring with merry  quip and jest, with a smile on his painted face, while his heart was  breaking with grief.    And so it was with Ruth DeVere. As she staggered out of the smoke clouds  and saw that Alice had not followed, at once the dreadful thought came  to her that her sister had been overcome by the fumes. And, although the  smoke bombs were harmless as regards fire, the breathing of the  chemical fumes for any length of time might mean death.    Thus, as Ruth was about to stagger to her feet to go back into the murky  cloud to look for Alice, there came the director's orders to \"hold that  pose!\"    The show must go on! That meant it would not do to spoil the scene, ruin  the film, and necessitate a retake if, by any possibility, it could be  avoided.    \"Stay where you are, Ruth! Stop the camera, Russ! Hold the pose--both of  you. We'll go on from there when we get Alice out!\"    And Ruth, her heart torn with anguish, must remain. She was glad her  father was not present.    \"Get in there and get the girl!\" cried Pop Snooks who was busy lighting  more smoke bombs. \"G"]]]
