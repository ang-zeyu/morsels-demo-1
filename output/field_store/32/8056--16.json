The people of the whole civilized world were horrified by the  deed. Germany's attitude is shown by the fact that medals were struck  commemorating the act, and the commander of the submarine was rewarded.    President Wilson wrote a series of notes to the German government  insisting that Germany conduct her warfare in accordance with  international law. This resulted in a promise by the German minister to  the United States, that liners would not be sunk by German submarines  without warning and without safety to the lives of noncombatants,  provided that the liners did not try to escape or offer resistance.    RAIDS ON COAST TOWNS.--Several times in 1914 German vessels managed to  escape through the cordon of Allied ships. They proceeded to the east  coast of England and bombarded defenseless fishing ports and watering  places such as Yarmouth, Whitby, and Scarborough. These raids had no  military effect, but they resulted in the killing or wounding of  hundreds of women, children, and old men. They were undertaken for the  purpose of terrorizing the civilian population of England in order to  arouse a desire for peace. In January, 1915, a German squadron  attempting a similar raid was intercepted and defeated by British war  ships.    ZEPPELINS.--At the outset Germany had great faith in the usefulness of  her immense dirigible balloons, or Zep'pelins, as they are commonly  called. In the attack on Belgium, they were used for observation,  incidentally dropping a few bombs on Antwerp. Early in 1915, Zeppelins  made their appearance over England, bombing many of the smaller towns  and villages, as well as London. Such raids might have some effect on  the war if they were directed toward munition plants, railway stations,  or naval depots. The Germans, however, generally contented themselves  with attacks on defenseless residential towns and cities. Up to October,  1917, there were thirty-four such raids, resulting in the death of  nearly one thousand persons and the wounding of three times as many. The  result on the military situation was practically zero, except to  increase the British determination to see the war through.    Later the protection afforded Great Britain by anti-aircraft guns and  especially by airplanes, made it highly dangerous for Zeppelins to  continue their raids. Many of them were destroyed. The later raids were  made by squadrons of airplanes which had greater chances of escape.  German air raiders found it increasingly difficult to get past the  defenses, and in 1918 the raids on England became infrequent.    ALLIED RETALIATION.--For a long time the Allies refused to retaliate  by bombing unfortified towns in Germany, but finally they decided to do  so. The immediate results were a protest from Germany that the Allies  were violating international law, and a petition to the German  authorities from the towns in western Germany, asking that air raids on  places not in the military area should be stopped, so that the German  cities should not be bombed in retaliation. Nearly all such Allied air  raids, however, were directed against railroads, munition factories, and  other objects of military importance.    THE ALLIES ORGANIZE FOR A LONG WAR.--When Lord Kitchener, the great  British general, predicted that the war would last at least three years,  hardly any one believed him. It was thought that the cost of a modern  war would be so great that nations would not be able to stand the strain  for more than a few months. When the Allies realized that Kitchener was  right, they prepared for a long struggle. The munition factories in all  the countries were reorganized, and the output of war material was  increased many fold, more being produced in a few days than had formerly  been produced in a year. Great Britain and France appointed ministers of  munitions whose sole work was to see that the armies were supplied with  guns, ammunition, and other fighting needs.    The people in the British overseas dominions remained loyal, and sent  hundreds of thousands of soldiers to the battle fronts in order to  protect the mother country from threatened defeat. To secure still  greater cooeperation throughout the British Empire, the prime ministers  of the self-governing colonies were invited to places in the British  imperial war conferences.

CHAPTER X    THE WAR IN 1916      \"THEY SHALL NOT PASS!\"--Early in 1916 the Germans began a furious  attack on the strong French position at Verdun. This point was a highly  important one for the French, because if it were captured by the enemy,  he could make flank attacks upon their adjoining lines and perhaps  compel a general retreat. The Germans had long been massing materials  and men for the greatest military offensive which the world had ever  seen. Twenty thousand men were placed on each mile of the front for a  distance of twenty-five miles, while hundreds of thousands more were  held in reserve. Thousands of guns of all sizes were brought up for the  attack. Under the command of the German crown prince, the German people  and the whole world were to be shown that the German army was still  invincible.    Beginning on February 21, the titanic struggle around Verdun continued  until July, when the attacks and counter-attacks were gradually  suspended. In the early attacks the French were driven in from advanced  positions, and then the Germans charged the heavily protected woodlands  and hills. In massed formation they advanced in the face of artillery,  machine-gun, and rifle fire of the heaviest character. The first waves  were mown down like grain; but other troops, and still others climbed  over the bodies of their dead comrades. Never since the world began had  such slaughter been seen.    During the intervals between the infantry attacks the French troops were  subjected to an unprecedented artillery fire. Suffering under a strain  such as armies had never hitherto known, the French patriots yet held  true to their watchword,--\"They shall not pass.\" General Petain  (p[=a]-t[)a]n'), in a stirring address, said to his entrenched heroes,  \"Courage, we'll get them!\" (\"_Courage, on les aura!_\"), and this phrase  became the Verdun battle-cry. Try as the Germans would, from every  possible point, they could not break through the living wall of  Frenchmen. A little ground was won here and there, but before the end of  the year nearly all had been retaken by the French. At a frightful cost  the German crown prince and his military advisers had put their fighting  machine to the test, and it had failed. A half million men, killed,  wounded, or prisoners, were lost to the Germans before they ceased their  attacks at this point.    THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME.--In July, 1916, while the Verdun struggle was  still undetermined, the French and British troops began an advance on  the German line along the river Somme (som). Exceedingly heavy artillery  attacks first battered down the enemy defenses, and then the infantry  went \"over the top.\" During the long course of the Battle of the Somme  (July 1 to November 17) the Allies advanced on a front of twenty miles  to a maximum depth of about nine miles. Slowly, and at great expense of  ammunition and men on both sides, the Allied progress had been won. They  had failed to break through the German line, but they had shown how it  might gradually be pushed back. And they had relieved the important  position of Verdun from further severe attacks, because German forces  were needed to the westward.    In the course of this battle, on September 15, the British first used  their most original military machines--the \"tanks.\" Thereafter these  armored cruisers of the land were to play an increasingly important part  along the western front.    INCREASED USE OF AIRCRAFT.--Aircraft, too, were every day becoming  more valuable. In the first year of the war airplanes were used mainly  for observation purposes: to find the location of enemy forts, trenches,  troops, and batteries; and to direct the fire of the aviator's own  batteries. Hundreds of photographs were taken by the airmen, rapidly  developed, and within thirty minutes the staff officers could be seen  studying them with microscopes to determine what changes had taken place  within the enemy's lines. Anchored balloons, too, were used for similar  purposes.    Airplane construction and use developed more rapidly than any other  feature in the war. After the observation machines, came the  battle-planes, whose first purpose was to clear the way and protect the  observation planes. Later, heavy machines for bombing expeditions were  constructed; and squadrons of airplanes now took part in every battle,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17213"],[0,"The Future of Islam (#15)"],[1,"Kansaw having fallen, they accepted  Sultan Selim.    The Ottoman Sultans then became protectors of the Holy Places, and were  acknowledged Caliphs without any appeal to arms at Mecca and Medina.  Their weapons were, in fact, the gold and silver pieces with which they  subsidized the Sherifs. Sultan Selim at once, on being acknowledged,  ordered an additional annuity of 5000 ardebs to be paid to Mecca, and he  and his immediate successors carried out at their own expense such  public works as the shrines required in the way of repairs or  improvements. Subsequently the seaport of Jeddah, formerly occupied by  the Egyptians, received a Turkish contingent, but the interior of Hejaz  was never subjugated, nor was any tax at any time levied. Only once a  year an Ottoman army appeared before the walls of Medina, conducting the  pilgrims from Damascus and convoying the surrah. The state of things at  Mecca in the last century has been clearly sketched by Niebuhr. The  Sherifs were in reality independent princes, but they \"gratified the  vanity of the Grand Signior\" by calling him their suzerain, he on his  side occasionally exercising the right of power by deposing the reigning  Sherif and appointing another of the same family. No kind of  administration had then been attempted by the Turks in Hejaz.    Mehemet Ali's occupation of Hejaz in 1812 first brought foreign troops  inland. He established himself at Taif, the summer residence of the  Meccans; deposed the Grand Sherif Ghaleb, and appointed in his stead  another member of the Sherifal family; declaring the Sultan sovereign of  the country--acts which the Meccans acquiesced in through dread of the  Wahhabis, from whom Mehemet Ali promised to deliver them. The Egyptian  and Turkish Governments have thus, during the present century, exercised  some of the functions of sovereignty in Hejaz.    At the present moment Sultan Abd el Hamid's position in the country is  this. His troops occupy Jeddah and Yembo, the two seaports, and the  towns of Medina and Taif in the interior. He is acknowledged by the  Sherifs as sovereign, except in Mecca; and he appoints to all the  principal offices of State, including the supreme office of the Grand  Sherifate itself. He is represented by a Pasha who resides alternately  at Jeddah and Taif according to the season, but who has not the right of  entering Mecca without the Grand Sherif's leave, or of sending troops  there. The total garrison of the Turks in Hejaz last winter was from  8000 to 10,000 men, of whom 4000 only were regulars (Nizams), and  efficient. While I was at Jeddah, the Medina garrison of 2000 regulars,  having been long unpaid and unrationed, was said to be living on public  charity. On the other hand the Hejazi Bedouins do not acknowledge any  sovereignty but that of the Sherif, nor could the Sultan pretend to keep  order outside the towns except through the Sherif's interposition. The  Sultan levies no tax in the interior or impost of any kind, and the sole  revenue he receives in Hejaz comes from Customs duties of Jeddah and  Yembo, which may amount to L40,000.    In return for this he also is bound to transmit every year at the time  of the pilgrimage sums of money collected by him from the revenues of  the Wakaf within his dominions, lands settled by pious persons on the  Sherifal family. These are said to amount to nearly half a million  sterling, and are distributed amongst all the principal personages of  Hejaz. The transmission of the Wakaf income, in which the Sultan  constitutes himself, so to say, the Sherif's agent, is in fact the real  bond which unites Hejaz with the Caliphate, and its distribution gives  the Sultan patronage, and with it power in the country. The bond,  however, is one of interest only. The Sherifs, proud of their sacred  ancestry, look upon the Turkish Caliphs as barbarians and impostors,  while the Sultans find the Hejaz a heavy charge upon their revenue.  Either hates and despises the other, the patron and the patronized; and,  save that their union is a necessity, it would long ago have, by mutual  consent, been dissolved. The Sherif depends upon the Sultan because he  needs a protector, and needs his Wakaf. The Sultan depends upon the  Sherif, because recognition by Hejaz as the protector is a chief title  to his Caliphate. Mecca, in fact, is a necessity to Islam even more than  a Caliph; and whoever is sovereign there is naturally sovereign of the  Mussulman world.    Outside Hejaz the Sultan holds what he holds of Arabia merely by force.  I have described already the growing power of Ibn Rashid, the Prince of  Nejd; and since that time, two years ago, he has sensibly extended and  confirmed his influence there. He has now brought into his alliance all  the important tribes of northern Arabia, including the powerful Ateybeh,  who, a few months ago, were threatening Mecca; and in Hejaz his name is  already as potent as the Sultan's. He offered, while I was at Jeddah, to  undertake the whole convoy of the Damascus pilgrimage with his own  troops, as already he convoys that from Persia; while I have quite  recent information of a campaign against his own rivals, the Ibn Saouds,  which he has just brought to a successful conclusion. In Yemen, the  other neighbour of the Meccans, 20,000 Turkish troops are required to  garrison the few towns the Sultan calls his own, and were it not for  the facility given him by the possession of the sea-coast, these could  not long hope to hold their ground. Every day I am expecting news from  there of a revolt, and the first sign of weakness at Constantinople will  certainly precipitate a war of independence in that part of Arabia.    We may expect, therefore, in the event of such a break-up as I have  suggested to be likely of the Ottoman power--either through loss of  territory or by the growing impoverishment of the empire, which needs  must, in a few decades, end in atrophy--to see among Mussulman princes a  competition for the right of protecting the Holy Places, and with it of  inheriting the Caliphal title. The Sultan reduced to Asia Minor, even if  he retain Armenia and Kurdistan (which is extremely improbable), would  be quite unable to afford himself the expensive luxury of holding his  Arabian conquests and buying the patronage of Mecca. He would be unable  any longer to overawe the Red Sea, or secure the pilgrim routes. The  Princes of Nejd would certainly not tolerate the presence of Turkish  soldiers at Medina, and the Sherifs of Mecca would have to make terms  with them and with the restored Imams of Yemen till such time as they  should find a new protector elsewhere. Above all, the half million of  Wakaf income would no longer be forthcoming, and a Turkish Emir el Haj  arriving empty-handed at Mecca would bring his master to a climax of  derision. Hejaz then would infallibly look out for a new potentate whom  she could dignify with the title of Hami el Harameyn and Emir el  Mumenin; and if there were none forthcoming would herself proclaim a  Caliphate. Let us look, therefore, at the lands of Islam to see in which  of them a competent Prince of the Faithful is likely to appear.    It is possible, though to European eyes it will seem far from probable,  that out of the ferment which we are now witnessing in the Barbary  States, some leader of real power and religious distinction may arise  who shall possess the talent of banding together into an instrument of  power the immense but scattered forces of Islam in Northern Africa, and  after achieving some signal success against the new French policy,  establish himself in Tripoli or Tunis in independent sovereignty. Were  such another man as Abd el Kader to arise, a saint, a preacher, and a  soldier, indifferent to the petty aims of local power and gifted with  military genius, true piety, and an eloquent tongue, I believe at the  present day he might achieve at least a partial success.    The French army is weak in discipline and confidence compared to what  it was in Abd el Kader's day, and it has a far more difficult frontier  to defend; while the Government at home is but half resolute, and the  Arabs command much floating sympathy in Europe and elsewhere. I do not  say the thing is likely, but it is conceivable; and Africa contains the  elements of a possible new sovereignty for some Mussulman prince which  might eventually lead him on the road to Mecca. It is undoubted that  with the prestige of success against a Christian Power, and backed by  the vast populations of Soudan and the fierce military fervour of the  Malekite Arabs, an Abd el Kader or an Abd-el-Wahhab would attract the  sympathy of Islam, and might aspire to its highest dignity. But enormous  postulates must be granted before we can look on any one now known to  fame in Africa as a probable candidate for the future Caliphate.    The present leaders of the Arabs are but local heroes, and as yet they  have achieved nothing which can command respect. In Tripoli there is  indeed a saint of very high pretensions, one known as the Sheykh Es  Snusi, who has a large religious following, and who has promised to come  forward shortly as the Mohdy or guide expected by a large section of  the Sunite as well as the Shiite Mussulmans. Next year he will attain  the age of forty (the legal age of a prophet), and he may be expected to  take a prominent part in any general movement that may then be on foot.  But as yet we know nothing of him but his name and the fact of his  sanctity, which is of Wahhabite type. Moreover, even supposing all that  may be supposed of a possible success, there yet lies Egypt and the Suez  Canal between the Barbary State and Mecca, so that I think we may be  justified in these days of steam fleets and electric cables and European  concerts, if we treat North Western Africa as out of probable  calculations in considering the future of the Caliphate. It is  remarkable that the Sultan of Morocco has"]]]
