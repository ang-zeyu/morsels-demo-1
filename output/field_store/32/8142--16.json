And therefore the same  _Fromondus_ expresly holds, that the first region of ayre is there  terminated, where the heate caused by reflexion begins to languish,  whereas the beames themselves doe passe a great way further. The chiefe  argument which doth most plainely manifest this truth, is taken from a  common observation which may be easily tryed.      [Sidenote 1: _Ant. lect. l. 1. c. 4._]      [Sidenote 2: _Praefat. ad Austrica syd._]      [Sidenote 3: _Meteor. l. 1. c. 2. Art. 2._]    If you behold the Moone a little before or after the conjunction, when  she is in a sextile with the Sunne, you may discerne not onely the part  which is enlightned, but the rest also to have in it a kind of a duskish  light, but if you chuse out such a scituation, where some house or  chimney (being some 70 or 80 paces distant from you) may hide from your  eye the enlightned hornes, you may then discerne a greater and more  remarkeable shining in those parts unto which the Sunne beames cannot  reach; nay there is so great a light, that by the helpe of a good  perspective you may discerne its spots. Inso much that _Blancanus_ the  Jesuite speaking of it sayes[1]      _Haec experientia ita me aliquando fefellit, ut in hunc fulgorem    casu ac repente incidens, existimarim novo quodam miraculo tempore    adolescentis lunae factum esse plenilunium._      \"This experiment did once so deceive mee, that happening upon the    sight of this brightnesse upon a sudden, I thought that by some new    miracle the Moone had beene got into her full a little after her    change.\"      [Sidenote 1: _De mundi fab. p. 3Âª. c. 3._]    But now this light is not proper to the Moone, it doth not proceed from  the rayes of the Sunne which doth penetrate her body, nor is it caused  by any other of the Planets and Starres. Therefore it must necessarily  follow, that it comes from the earth. The two first of these I have  already proved, and as for the last, it is confidently affirmed by  _Caelius_,[1]      _Quod si in disquisitionem evocet quia, an lunari syderi lucem    foenerent planetae item alii, asseveranter astruendum non foenerare_.    \"If any should aske whether the other Planets lend any light to the  Moone; I answer they doe not.\" True indeed, the noble _Tycho_[2]  discussing the reason of this light attributes it to the Planet _Uenus_,  and I grant that this may convey some light to the Moone; but that it is  not the cause of this whereof wee now discourse, is of itselfe  sufficiently plaine, because _Uenus_ is sometimes over the Moone, when  as shee cannot convey any light to that part which is turned from her.      [Sidenote 1: _Progym. 1._]      [Sidenote 2: _l. 20. c. 5._]    It doth not proceede from the fixed starres, for then it would retaine  the same light in eclipses, whereas the light at such times is more  ruddy and dull. Then also the light of the Moone would not be greater or  lesser, according to its distance from the edge of the earths shadow,  since it did at all times equally participate this light of the starres.    Now because there is no other body in the whole Universe, save the  earth, it remaines that this light must necessarily be caused by that  which with a just gratitude repaies to the Moone, such illumination as  it receives from her.    And as loving friends equally participate of the same joy and griefe, so  doe these mutually partake of the same light from the Sunne, and the  same darkenesse from the eclipses, being also severally helped by one  another in their greatest wants: For when the Moone is in conjunction  with the Sunne, and her upper part receives all the light, then her  lower Hemispheare (which would otherwise be altogether darke) is  enlightened by the reflexion of the Sunne beames from the earth. When  these two planets are in opposition, then that part of the earth which  could not receive any light from the Sunne beames, is most enlightened  by the Moone, being then in her full; and as she doth most illuminate  the earth when the Sunne beames cannot, so the gratefull earth returnes  to her as great, nay greater light when shee most wants it; so that  alwaies that visible part of the Moone which receives nothing from the  Sunne, is enlightened by the earth, as is proved by _Galilaeus_, with  many more arguments, in that Treatise which he calls _Systema mundi_.  True indeed, when the Moone comes to a quartile, then you can neither  discerne this light, nor yet the darker part of her body, but the reason  is, because of the exuperancy of the light in the other parts. _Quippe  illustratum medium speciem recipit valentiorem_,[1] the clearer  brightnesse involves the weaker, it being with the species of sight, as  it is with those of sound, and as the greater noise drownes the lesse,  so the brighter object hides that which is more obscure. But they doe  alwaies in their mutuall vicissitudes participate of one anothers light;  so also doe they partake of the same defects and darknings, for when our  Moone is eclipsed, then is their Sunne darkened, and when our Sunne is  eclipsed, then is their Moone deprived of its light, as you may see  affirmed by _Maeslin_.[2]      _Quod si terram nobis ex alto liceret intueri, quemadmodum    deficientem lunam ex longinquo spectare possumus, videremus tempore    eclipsis solis terrae aliquam partem lumine solis deficere, eodem    plane modo sicut ex opposito luna deficit_,      \"If wee might behold this globe of earth at the same distance as we    doe the Moone in her defects, wee might discerne some part of it    darkened in the Sunnes eclipses, just so as the Moone is in hers.\"    For as our Moone is eclipsed by the interposition of our earth, so is  their Moone eclipsed by the interposition of theirs. The manner of this  mutuall illumination betwixt these two you may plainly discerne in this  Figure following.      [Sidenote 1: _Scal. exerc. 62._]      [Sidenote 2: _Epit. Astro. l. 4. part. 2._]      [Illustration as described in text:    sun, crescent moon and gibbous earth]    Where A represents the Sun, B the Earth, and C the Moone; Now suppose  the Moone C to be in a sextile of increase, when there is onely one  small part of her body enlightened, then the earth B will have such a  part of its visible Hemispheare darkened, as is proportionable to that  part of the Moone which is enlightened; and as for so much of the Moone,  as the Sun beames cannot reach unto, it receives light from a  proportionall part of the earth which shines upon it, as you may plainly  perceive by the Figure.    You see then that agreement and similitude which there is betwixt our  earth and the Moone. Now the greatest difference which makes them  unlike, is this, that the Moone enlightens our earth round about,  whereas our earth gives light onely to that Hemispheare of the Moone  which is visible unto us, as may be certainly gathered from the constant  appearance of the same spots, which could not thus come to passe, if the  Moone had such a diurnall motion about its own axis, as perhaps our  earth hath. And though some suppose her to move in an epicycle, yet this  doth not so turne her body round, that we may discerne both  Hemispheares, for according to that hypothesis, the motion of her  eccentrick, doth turne her face towards us, as much as the other doth  from us.    But now if any question what they doe for a Moone who live in the upper  part of her body? I answer, the solving of this is the most uncertaine  and difficult thing that I know of concerning this whole matter. But yet  I will give you two probable conjectures.    1. Perhaps, the upper Hemispheare of the Moone doth receive a sufficient  light from those planets about it, and amongst these _Venus_ (it may be)  bestowes a more especiall brightnesse, since _Galilaeus_ hath plainly  discerned that she suffers the same increase and decreases, as the Moone  hath, and 'tis probable that this may be perceived there without the  help of a glasse, because they are farre neerer it than wee. When  _Venus_ (saith _Keplar_) lies downe in the Perige or lower part of her  supposed Epicycle, then is she in conjunction with her husband the  Sunne, from whom after she hath departed for the space of ten moneths,  shee gets _plenum uterum_, and is in the full.    But you'll reply, though _Venus_ may bestow some light when she is over  the Moone, and in conjunction, yet being in opposition, she is not  visible to them, and what shall they then doe for light?    I answer, then they have none: nor doth this make so great a difference  betwixt those two Hemispheares as there is with us, betwixt the places  under the poles, and the line, but if this bee not sufficient, then I  say in the second place that    2. Perhaps there may be some other enlightened body above the Moone  which we cannot discerne, nor is this altogether improbable because  there is almost the like observed in Saturne, who appeares through this  glasse with two lesser bodies on each side, which may supply the office  of Moones, unto each hemispheare thus:        o O o    So in this world also there may be some such body, though wee cannot  discerne it, because the Moone is alwaies in a streight line, betwixt  our eye and that. Nor is it altogether unlikely that there should bee  more moones to one Orbe, because _Jupiter_ also is observed to have  foure such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19115"],[0,"Roman Britain in 1914 (#15)"],[1," and Field Club Transactions_      (Carmarthen).      *_Report and Transactions of the Cardiff Naturalists' Society_ (Cardiff)      [see 48].
