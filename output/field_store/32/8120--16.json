He told me that money would go a long way  towards making a man happy, but he always ended by saying that the gods  were more powerful than men. He said I must always be careful not to  make the evil spirits angry. Sometimes I laughed in his face, telling  him that I was rich and could buy the favour of gods and fairies. The  good man would shake his head, saying, 'Take care, my boy, or you will  be sorry for these rash speeches.'\"    \"One day, after he had been giving me a long lecture of this sort, we  were walking in the garden of my father's compound. I was even more  daring than usual and told him that I cared nothing for the rules other  people followed. 'You say,' said I, 'that this well here in my father's  yard is ruled by a spirit, and that if I were to anger him by jumping  over it, he would be vexed and give me trouble.' 'Yes,' said he, 'that  is exactly what I said, and I repeat it. Beware, young man, beware of  idle boasting and of breaking the law.' 'What do I care for a spirit  that lives on my father's land?' I answered with a sneer. 'I don't  believe there is a spirit in this well. If there is, it is only another  of my father's slaves.'    \"So saying, and before my tutor could stop me, I leaped across the mouth  of the well. No sooner had I touched the ground than I felt a strange  shrinking of my body. My strength left me in the twinkling of an eye,  my bones shortened, my skin grew yellow and wrinkled. I looked at my  pigtail and found that the hair had suddenly grown thin and white. In  every way I had been changed completely into an old man.    \"My teacher stared at me in amazement, and when I asked him what it all  meant my voice was as shrill as that of early childhood. 'Alas! my dear  pupil,' he replied, 'now you will believe what I told you. The spirit of  the well is angry at your wicked conduct and has punished you. You have  been told a hundred times that it is wrong to leap over a well; yet you  did this very thing,' 'But is there nothing that can be done,' I cried;  'is there no way of restoring my lost youth?' He looked at me sadly and  shook his head.    \"When my father learned of my sad condition he was terribly upset. He  did everything that could be done to find some way for me to regain my  youth. He had incense burned at a dozen temples and he himself offered  up prayers to various gods. I was his only son, and he could not be  happy without me. At last, when everything else had been done, my worthy  teacher thought of asking a fortune-teller who had become famous in the  city. After inquiring about everything that had led up to my sad plight,  the wise man said that the spirit of the well, as a punishment, had  changed me into a miser. He said that only when I was sleeping would  I be in my natural state, and even then if any one chanced to enter my  room or catch a glimpse of my face, I would be at once changed back into  a greybeard.\"    \"I saw you yesterday morning,\" shouted the gander. \"You were young and  handsome, and then before my very eyes you were changed back into an old  man!\"    \"To continue my story,\" said the young man, \"the fortune-teller at last  announced that there was only one chance for my recovery and that a very  small one. If at any time, while I was in my rightful shape, that is, as  you see me now, a mad goose should come in, leading a tiger-forest out  of slavery, the charm would be broken, and the evil spirit would no  longer have control over me. When the fortune-teller's answer was  brought to my father, he gave up hope, and so did I, for no one  understood the meaning of such a senseless riddle.    \"That night I left my native city, resolved not to disgrace my people  any longer by living with them. I came to this place, bought this house  with some money my father had given me, and at once began living the  life of a miser. Nothing satisfied my greed for money. Everything must  be turned into cash. For five years I have been storing away money, and,  at the same time, starving myself, body and soul.    \"Soon after my arrival here, remembering the fortune-teller's riddle,  I decided that I would keep a goose to serve as night watch-man instead  of a dog. In this way I made a start at working out the riddle.\"    \"But I am not a mad goose,\" hissed the gander angrily. \"If it had not  been for me you would still be a wrinkled miser.\"    \"Quite right, dear Ch'ang, quite right,\" said the young man soothingly;  \"you were not mad; so I gave you the name _Ch'ang_, which means mad, and  thus made a mad goose of you.\"    \"Oh, I see,\" said Hu-lin and Ch'ang together. \"How clever!\"    \"So, you see, I had part of my cure here in my back-yard all the time;  but though I thought as hard as I could, I could think of no way of  securing that Ch'ang should lead a tiger-forest into my room while I was  sleeping. The thing seemed absurd, and I soon gave up trying to study it  out. To-day by accident it has really come to pass.\"    \"So I am the tiger-forest, am I?\" laughed Hu-lin.    \"Yes, indeed, you are, my dear child, a pretty little tiger-forest, for  _Hu_ means _tiger_, and _lin_ is surely good Chinese for a _grove of  trees_. Then, too, you told me you were a slave girl. Hence, Ch'ang led  you out of slavery.\"    \"Oh, I am so glad!\" said Hu-lin, forgetting her own poverty, \"so glad  that you don't have to be a horrible old miser any longer.\"    Just at that moment there was a loud banging on the front gate.    \"Who can be knocking in that fashion?\" asked the young man in  astonishment.    \"Alas! it must be Black Heart, my master,\" said Hu-lin, beginning to  cry.    \"Don't be frightened,\" said the youth, soothingly stroking the child's  head. \"You have saved me, and I shall certainly do as much for you. If  this Mr. Black Heart doesn't agree to a fair proposal he shall have a  black eye to remember his visit by.\"    It did not take long for the grateful young man to buy Hu-lin's liberty,  especially as he offered as much for her freedom as her master had  expected to get when she was fourteen or fifteen years of age.    When Hu-lin was told of the bargain she was wild with delight. She bowed  low before her new master and then, kneeling, touched her head nine  times on the floor. Rising, she cried out, \"Oh, how happy I am, for now  I shall be yours for ever and ever and ever, and good old Ch'ang shall  be my playmate.\"    \"Yes, indeed,\" he assured her, \"and when you are a little older I shall  make you my wife. At present you will go with me to my father's house  and become my little betrothed.\"    \"And I shall never again have to beg for crusts on the street?\" she  asked him, her eyes full of wonder.    \"No! never!\" he answered, laughing, \"and you need never fear another  beating.\"          THE NODDING TIGER    [Illustration]      Just outside the walls of a Chinese city there lived a young woodcutter  named T'ang and his old mother, a woman of seventy. They were very poor  and had a tiny one-room shanty, built of mud and grass, which they  rented from a neighbour. Every day young T'ang rose bright and early and  went up on the mountain near their house. There he spent the day cutting  firewood to sell in the city near by. In the evening he would return  home, take the wood to market, sell it, and bring back food for his  mother and himself. Now, though these two people were poor, they were  very happy, for the young man loved his mother dearly, and the old woman  thought there was no one like her son in all the world. Their friends,  however, felt sorry for them and said, \"What a pity we have no  grasshoppers here, so that the T'angs could have some food from heaven!\"    One day young T'ang got up before daylight and started for the hills,  carrying his axe on his shoulder. He bade his mother good-bye, telling  her that he would be back early with a heavier load of wood than usual,  for the morrow would be a holiday and they must eat good food. All day  long Widow T'ang waited patiently, saying to herself over and over as  she went about her simple work, \"The good boy, the good boy, how he  loves his old mother!\"    In the afternoon she began watching for his return--but in vain.  The sun was sinking lower and lower in the west, but still he did not  come. At last the old woman was frightened. \"My poor son!\" she muttered.  \"Something has happened to him.\" Straining her feeble eyes, she looked  along the mountain path. Nothing was to be seen there but a flock of  sheep following the shepherd. \"Woe is me!\" moaned the woman. \"My boy!  my boy!\" She took her crutch from its corner and limped off to a  neighbour's house to tell him of her trouble and beg him to go and look  for the missing boy.    Now this neighbour was kind-hearted, and willing to help old Mother  T'ang, for he felt very sorry for her. \"There are many wild beasts in  the mountains,\" he said, shaking his head as he walked away with her,  thinking to prepare the frightened woman for the worst, \"and I fear that  your son has been carried off by one of them.\" Widow T'ang gave a scream  of horror and sank upon the ground. Her friend walked slowly up the  mountain path, looking carefully for signs of a struggle. At last when  he had gone half way up the slope he came to a little pile of torn  clothing spattered with blood. The woodman's axe was lying by the side  of the path, also his carrying pole and some rope. There could be no  mistake: after making a brave fight, the poor youth had been carried off  by a tiger.    Gathering up the torn garments, the man went sadly down the hill. He  dreaded seeing the poor mother and telling her that her only boy was  indeed gone for ever. At the foot of the mountain he found her still  lying on the ground. When she looked up and saw what he was carrying,  with a cry of despair she fainted away. She did not need to be told what  had happened.    Friends bore her into the little house and gave her food, but they could  not comfort her. \"Alas!\" she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1872"],[0,"The Red House Mystery (#15)"],[1,"coffee.    \"No. The inspector wants to drag the lake this afternoon.\"    \"Oh! Is there a lake?\"    There was just the flicker of a smile on Cayley's face, but it  disappeared as quickly as it came.    \"Well, it's really a pond,\" he said, \"but it was called 'the lake.'\"    \"By Mark,\" thought Antony. Aloud he said, \"What do they expect to find?\"    \"They think that Mark--\" He broke off and shrugged his shoulders.    \"May have drowned himself, knowing that he couldn't get away? And  knowing that he had compromised himself by trying to get away at all?\"    \"Yes; I suppose so,\" said Cayley slowly.    \"I should have thought he would have given himself more of a run for  his money. After all, he had a revolver. If he was determined not to  be taken alive, he could always have prevented that. Couldn't he have  caught a train to London before the police knew anything about it?\"    \"He might just have managed it. There was a train. They would have  noticed him at Waldheim, of course, but he might have managed it at  Stanton. He's not so well-known there, naturally. The inspector has been  inquiring. Nobody seems to have seen him.\"    \"There are sure to be people who will say they did, later on. There was  never a missing man yet but a dozen people come forward who swear to  have seen him at a dozen different places at the same time.\"    Cayley smiled.    \"Yes. That's true. Anyhow, he wants to drag the pond first.\" He added  dryly, \"From what I've read of detective stories, inspectors always do  want to drag the pond first.\"    \"Is it deep?\"    \"Quite deep enough,\" said Cayley as he got up. On his way to the door he  stopped, and looked at Antony. \"I'm so sorry that we're keeping you here  like this, but it will only be until to-morrow. The inquest is to-morrow  afternoon. Do amuse yourself how you like till then. Beverley will look  after you.\"    \"Thanks very much. I shall really be quite all right.\"    Antony went on with his breakfast. Perhaps it was true that inspectors  liked dragging ponds, but the question was, did Cayleys like having them  dragged? Was Cayley anxious about it, or quite indifferent? He certainly  did not seem to be anxious, but he could hide his feelings very easily  beneath that heavy, solid face, and it was not often that the real  Cayley peeped out. Just a little too eager once or twice, perhaps, but  there was nothing to be learnt from it this morning. Perhaps he knew  that the pond had no secrets to give up. After all, inspectors were  always dragging ponds.    Bill came in noisily.    Bill's face was an open book. Excitement was written all over it.    \"Well,\" he said eagerly, as he sat down to the business of the meal,  \"what are we going to do this morning?\"    \"Not talk so loudly, for one thing,\" said Antony. Bill looked about  him apprehensively. Was Cayley under the table, for example? After last  night one never knew.    \"Is er--\" He raised his eyebrows.    \"No. But one doesn't want to shout. One should modulate the voice, my  dear William, while breathing gently from the hips. Thus one avoids  those chest-notes which have betrayed many a secret. In other words,  pass the toast.\"    \"You seem bright this morning.\"    \"I am. Very bright. Cayley noticed it. Cayley said, 'Were it not that I  have other business, I would come gathering nuts and may with thee. Fain  would I gyrate round the mulberry-bush and hop upon the little hills.  But the waters of Jordan encompass me and Inspector Birch tarries  outside with his shrimping-net. My friend William Beverley will attend  thee anon. Farewell, a long farewell to all--thy grape-nuts.' He then  left up-centre. Enter W. Beverley, R.\"    \"Are you often like this at breakfast?\"    \"Almost invariably. Said he with his mouth full. 'Exit W. Beverley, L.\"    \"It's a touch of the sun, I suppose,\" said Bill, shaking his head sadly.    \"It's the sun and the moon and the stars, all acting together on an  empty stomach. Do you know anything about the stars, Mr. Beverley? Do  you know anything about Orion's Belt, for instance? And why isn't there  a star called Beverley's Belt? Or a novel? Said he masticating. Re-enter  W. Beverley through trap-door.\"    \"Talking about trap-doors--\"    \"Don't,\" said Antony, getting up. \"Some talk of Alexander and some of  Hercules, but nobody talks about--what's the Latin for trap-door?--Mensa  a table; you might get it from that. Well, Mr. Beverley,\"--and he  slapped him heartily on the back as he went past him--\"I shall see you  later. Cayley says that you will amuse me, but so far you have not made  me laugh once. You must try and be more amusing when you have finished  your breakfast. But don't hurry. Let the upper mandibles have time to  do the work.\" With those words Mr. Gillingham then left the spacious  apartment.    Bill continued his breakfast with a slightly bewildered air. He did not  know that Cayley was smoking a cigarette outside the windows behind him;  not listening, perhaps; possibly not even overhearing; but within sight  of Antony, who was not going to take any risks. So he went on with his  breakfast, reflecting that Antony was a rum fellow, and wondering if  he had dreamed only of the amazing things which had happened the day  before.    Antony went up to his bedroom to fetch his pipe. It was occupied by  a housemaid, and he made a polite apology for disturbing her. Then he  remembered.    \"Is it Elsie?\" he asked, giving her a friendly smile.    \"Yes, sir,\" she said, shy but proud. She had no doubts as to why it was  that she had achieved such notoriety.    \"It was you who heard Mr. Mark yesterday, wasn't it? I hope the  inspector was nice to you?\"    \"Yes, thank you, sir.\"    \"'It's my turn now. You wait,'\" murmured Antony to himself.    \"Yes, sir. Nasty-like. Meaning to say his chance had come.\"    \"I wonder.\"    \"Well, that's what I heard, sir. Truly.\"    Antony looked at her thoughtfully and nodded.    \"Yes. I wonder. I wonder why.\"    \"Why what, sir?\"    \"Oh, lots of things, Elsie.... It was quite an accident your being  outside just then?\"    Elsie blushed. She had not forgotten what Mrs. Stevens had said about  it.    \"Quite, sir. In the general way I use the other stairs.\"    \"Of course.\"    He had found his pipe and was about to go downstairs again when she  stopped him.    \"I beg your pardon, sir, but will there be an inquest?\"    \"Oh, yes. To-morrow, I think.\"    \"Shall I have to give my evidence, sir?\"    \"Of course. There's nothing to be frightened of.\"    \"I did hear it, sir. Truly.\"    \"Why, of course you did. Who says you didn't?\"    \"Some of the others, sir, Mrs. Stevens and all.\"    \"Oh, that's just because they're jealous,\" said Antony with a smile.    He was glad to have spoken to her, because he had recognized at once  the immense importance of her evidence. To the Inspector no doubt it  had seemed only of importance in that it had shown Mark to have adopted  something of a threatening attitude towards his brother. To Antony it  had much more significance. It was the only trustworthy evidence that  Mark had been in the office at all that afternoon.    For who saw Mark go into the office? Only Cayley. And if Cayley had been  hiding the truth about the keys, why should he not be hiding the truth  about Mark's entry into the office? Obviously all Cayley's evidence went  for nothing. Some of it no doubt was true; but he was giving it, both  truth and falsehood, with a purpose. What the purpose was Antony did not  know as yet; to shield Mark, to shield himself, even to betray  Mark--it might be any of these. But since his evidence was given for his own  ends, it was impossible that it could be treated as the evidence of  an impartial and trustworthy onlooker. Such, for instance, as Elsie  appeared to be.    Elsie's evidence, however, seemed to settle the point. Mark had gone  into the office to see his brother; Elsie had heard them both talking;  and then Antony and Cayley had found the body of Robert.... and the  Inspector was going to drag the pond.    But certainly Elsie's evidence did not prove anything more than the mere  presence of Mark in the room. \"It's my turn now; you wait.\" That was not  an immediate threat;--it was a threat for the future. If Mark had shot  his brother immediately afterwards it must have been an accident, the  result of a struggle, say, provoked by that \"nasty-like\" tone of voice.  Nobody would say \"You wait\" to a man who was just going to be shot. \"You  wait\" meant \"You wait, and see what's going to happen to you later on.\"  The owner of the Red House had had enough of his brother's sponging,  his brother's blackmail; now it was Mark's turn to get a bit of his own  back. Let Robert just wait a bit, and he would see. The conversation  which Elsie had overheard might have meant something like this. It  couldn't have meant murder. Anyway not murder of Robert by Mark.    \"It's a funny business,\" thought Antony. \"The one obvious solution is so  easy and yet so wrong. And I've got a hundred things in my head, and I  can't fit them together. And this afternoon will make a hundred and one.  I mustn't forget this afternoon.\"    He found Bill in the hall and proposed a stroll. Bill was only too  ready. \"Where do you want to go?\" he asked.    \"I don't mind much. Show me the park.\"    \"Righto.\"    They walked out together.    \"Watson, old man,\" said Antony, as soon as they were away from the  house, \"you really mustn't talk so loudly indoors. There was a gentleman  outside, just behind you, all the time.\"    \"Oh, I say,\" said Bill, going pink. \"I'm awfully sorry. So that's why  you were talking such rot.\"    \"Partly, yes. And partly because I do feel rather bright this morning.  We're going to have a busy day.\"    \"Are we really? What are we going to do?\"    \"They're going to drag the pond--beg its pardon, the lake. Where is the  lake?\"    \"We're on the way to it now, if you'd like to see it.\"    \"We may as well look at it. Do you haunt the lake much in the"]]]
