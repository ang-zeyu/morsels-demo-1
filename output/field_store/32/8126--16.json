[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1881"],[0,"The Call of the Canyon (#15)"],[1,"got off to walk awhile, leading the mustang. This would not do,  however, because she fell too far in the rear. Mounting again, she rode  on, beginning to feel that nothing mattered, that this trip would be the  end of Carley Burch. How she hated that dreary, cold, flat land the road  bisected without end. It felt as if she rode hours to cover a mile. In  open stretches she saw the whole party straggling along, separated from  one another, and each for himself. They certainly could not be enjoying  themselves. Carley shut her eyes, clutched the pommel of the saddle,  trying to support her weight. How could she endure another mile? Alas!  there might be many miles. Suddenly a terrible shock seemed to rack  her. But it was only that Spillbeans had once again taken to a trot.  Frantically she pulled on the bridle. He was not to be thwarted. Opening  her eyes, she saw a cabin far ahead which probably was the destination  for the night. Carley knew she would never reach it, yet she clung on  desperately. What she dreaded was the return of that stablike pain in  her side. It came, and life seemed something abject and monstrous. She  rode stiff legged, with her hands propping her stiffly above the pommel,  but the stabbing pain went right on, and in deeper. When the mustang  halted his trot beside the other horses Carley was in the last  extremity. Yet as Glenn came to her, offering a hand, she still hid her  agony. Then Flo called out gayly: \"Carley, you've done twenty-five miles  on as rotten a day as I remember. Shore we all hand it to you. And I'm  confessing I didn't think you'd ever stay the ride out. Spillbeans is  the meanest nag we've got and he has the hardest gait.\"        CHAPTER V    Later Carley leaned back in a comfortable seat, before a blazing fire  that happily sent its acrid smoke up the chimney, pondering ideas in her  mind.    There could be a relation to familiar things that was astounding in its  revelation. To get off a horse that had tortured her, to discover an  almost insatiable appetite, to rest weary, aching body before the genial  warmth of a beautiful fire--these were experiences which Carley found  to have been hitherto unknown delights. It struck her suddenly and  strangely that to know the real truth about anything in life might  require infinite experience and understanding. How could one feel  immense gratitude and relief, or the delight of satisfying acute hunger,  or the sweet comfort of rest, unless there had been circumstances of  extreme contrast? She had been compelled to suffer cruelly on horseback  in order to make her appreciate how good it was to get down on the  ground. Otherwise she never would have known. She wondered, then, how  true that principle might be in all experience. It gave strong food for  thought. There were things in the world never before dreamed of in her  philosophy.    Carley was wondering if she were narrow and dense to circumstances of  life differing from her own when a remark of Flo's gave pause to her  reflections.    \"Shore the worst is yet to come.\" Flo had drawled.    Carley wondered if this distressing statement had to do in some way with  the rest of the trip. She stifled her curiosity. Painful knowledge of  that sort would come quickly enough.    \"Flo, are you girls going to sleep here in the cabin?\" inquired Glenn.    \"Shore. It's cold and wet outside,\" replied Flo.    \"Well, Felix, the Mexican herder, told me some Navajos had been bunking  here.\"    \"Navajos? You mean Indians?\" interposed Carley, with interest.    \"Shore do,\" said Flo. \"I knew that. But don't mind Glenn. He's full of  tricks, Carley. He'd give us a hunch to lie out in the wet.\"    Hutter burst into his hearty laugh. \"Wal, I'd rather get some things  any day than a bad cold.\"    \"Shore I've had both,\" replied Flo, in her easy drawl, \"and I'd prefer  the cold. But for Carley's sake--\"    \"Pray don't consider me,\" said Carley. The rather crude drift of the  conversation affronted her.    \"Well, my dear,\" put in Glenn, \"it's a bad night outside. We'll all make  our beds here.\"    \"Glenn, you shore are a nervy fellow,\" drawled Flo.    Long after everybody was in bed Carley lay awake in the blackness of the  cabin, sensitively fidgeting and quivering over imaginative contact with  creeping things. The fire had died out. A cold air passed through the  room. On the roof pattered gusts of rain. Carley heard a rustling of  mice. It did not seem possible that she could keep awake, yet she strove  to do so. But her pangs of body, her extreme fatigue soon yielded to  the quiet and rest of her bed, engendering a drowsiness that proved  irresistible.    Morning brought fair weather and sunshine, which helped to sustain  Carley in her effort to brave out her pains and woes. Another  disagreeable day would have forced her to humiliating defeat.  Fortunately for her, the business of the men was concerned with the  immediate neighborhood, in which they expected to stay all morning.    \"Flo, after a while persuade Carley to ride with you to the top of this  first foothill,\" said Glenn. \"It's not far, and it's worth a good deal  to see the Painted Desert from there. The day is clear and the air free  from dust.\"    \"Shore. Leave it to me. I want to get out of camp, anyhow. That  conceited hombre, Lee Stanton, will be riding in here,\" answered Flo,  laconically.    The slight knowing smile on Glenn's face and the grinning disbelief  on Mr. Hutter's were facts not lost upon Carley. And when Charley, the  herder, deliberately winked at Carley, she conceived the idea that Flo,  like many women, only ran off to be pursued. In some manner Carley did  not seek to analyze, the purported advent of this Lee Stanton pleased  her. But she did admit to her consciousness that women, herself  included, were both as deep and mysterious as the sea, yet as  transparent as an inch of crystal water.    It happened that the expected newcomer rode into camp before anyone  left. Before he dismounted he made a good impression on Carley, and  as he stepped down in lazy, graceful action, a tall lithe figure, she  thought him singularly handsome. He wore black sombrero, flannel shirt,  blue jeans stuffed into high boots, and long, big-roweled spurs.    \"How are you-all?\" was his greeting.    From the talk that ensued between him and the men, Carley concluded  that he must be overseer of the sheep hands. Carley knew that Hutter  and Glenn were not interested in cattle raising. And in fact they were,  especially Hutter, somewhat inimical to the dominance of the range land  by cattle barons of Flagstaff.    \"When's Ryan goin' to dip?\" asked Hutter.    \"Today or tomorrow,\" replied Stanton.    \"Reckon we ought to ride over,\" went on Hutter. \"Say, Glenn, do you  reckon Miss Carley could stand a sheep-dip?\"    This was spoken in a low tone, scarcely intended for Carley, but she had  keen ears and heard distinctly. Not improbably this sheep-dip was what  Flo meant as the worst to come. Carley adopted a listless posture to  hide her keen desire to hear what Glenn would reply to Hutter.    \"I should say not!\" whispered Glenn, fiercely.    \"Cut out that talk. She'll hear you and want to go.\"    Whereupon Carley felt mount in her breast an intense and rebellious  determination to see a sheep-dip. She would astonish Glenn. What did  he want, anyway? Had she not withstood the torturing trot of the  hardest-gaited horse on the range? Carley realized she was going to  place considerable store upon that feat. It grew on her.    When the consultation of the men ended, Lee Stanton turned to Flo. And  Carley did not need to see the young man look twice to divine what ailed  him. He was caught in the toils of love. But seeing through Flo Hutter  was entirely another matter.    \"Howdy, Lee!\" she said, coolly, with her clear eyes on him. A tiny frown  knitted her brow. She did not, at the moment, entirely approve of him.    \"Shore am glad to see you, Flo,\" he said, with rather a heavy expulsion  of breath. He wore a cheerful grin that in no wise deceived Flo, or  Carley either. The young man had a furtive expression of eye.    \"Ahuh!\" returned Flo.    \"I was shore sorry about--about that--\" he floundered, in low voice.    \"About what?\"    \"Aw, you know, Flo.\"    Carley strolled out of hearing, sure of two things--that she felt rather  sorry for Stanton, and that his course of love did not augur well for  smooth running. What queer creatures were women! Carley had seen several  million coquettes, she believed; and assuredly Flo Hutter belonged to  the species.    Upon Carley's return to the cabin she found Stanton and Flo waiting for  her to accompany them on a ride up the foothill. She was so stiff and  sore that she could hardly mount into the saddle; and the first mile  of riding was something like a nightmare. She lagged behind Flo and  Stanton, who apparently forgot her in their quarrel.    The riders soon struck the base of a long incline of rocky ground that  led up to the slope of the foothill. Here rocks and gravel gave place  to black cinders out of which grew a scant bleached grass. This desert  verdure was what lent the soft gray shade to the foothill when seen from  a distance. The slope was gentle, so that the ascent did not entail any  hardship. Carley was amazed at the length of the slope, and also to  see how high over the desert she was getting. She felt lifted out of a  monotonous level. A green-gray league-long cedar forest extended down  toward Oak Creek. Behind her the magnificent bulk of the mountains  reached up into the stormy clouds, showing white slopes of snow under  the gray pall.    The hoofs of the horses sank in the cinders. A fine choking dust  assailed Carley's nostrils. Presently, when there appeared at least a  third of the ascent still to be accomplished and Flo dismounted to walk,  leading their horses. Carley had no choice but to do likewise. At first  walking was a relief. Soon, however, the soft"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18828"],[0,"Selections From the Writings of the Báb (#15)"],[1,"to the manifestation of the  Eternal Being...    In this day no less than seventy thousand people make pilgrimage every  year to the holy House of God in compliance with the bidding of the  Apostle of God; while He Himself Who ordained this ordinance took refuge  for seven years in the mountains of Mecca. And this notwithstanding that  the One Who enjoined this commandment is far greater than the commandment  itself. Hence all this people who at this time go on pilgrimage do not do  so with true understanding, otherwise in this Day of His Return which is  mightier than His former Dispensation, they would have followed His  commandment. But now behold what hath happened. People who profess belief  in His former religion, who in the daytime and in the night season bow  down in worship in His Name, have assigned Him to a dwelling place in a  mountain, while each one of them would regard attaining recognition of Him  as an honour. VII, 15.          \"The reason why privacy hath been enjoined in moments ...\"      The reason why privacy hath been enjoined in moments of devotion is this,  that thou mayest give thy best attention to the remembrance of God, that  thy heart may at all times be animated with His Spirit, and not be shut  out as by a veil from thy Best Beloved. Let not thy tongue pay lip service  in praise of God while thy heart be not attuned to the exalted Summit of  Glory, and the Focal Point of communion. Thus if haply thou dost live in  the Day of Resurrection, the mirror of thy heart will be set towards Him  Who is the Day-Star of Truth; and no sooner will His light shine forth  than the splendour thereof shall forthwith be reflected in thy heart. For  He is the Source of all goodness, and unto Him revert all things. But if  He appeareth while thou hast turned unto thyself in meditation, this shall  not profit thee, unless thou shalt mention His Name by words He hath  revealed. For in the forthcoming Revelation it is He Who is the  Remembrance of God, whereas the devotions which thou art offering at  present have been prescribed by the Point of the Bayan, while He Who will  shine resplendent in the Day of Resurrection is the Revelation of the  inner reality enshrined in the Point of the Bayan--a Revelation more  potent, immeasurably more potent, than the one which hath preceded it. IX,  4.          \"It is seemly that the servant should, after each prayer, ...\"      It is seemly that the servant should, after each prayer, supplicate God to  bestow mercy and forgiveness upon his parents. Thereupon God's call will  be raised: 'Thousand upon thousand of what thou hast asked for thy parents  shall be thy recompense!' Blessed is he who remembereth his parents when  communing with God. There is, verily, no God but Him, the Mighty, the  Well-Beloved. VIII, 16.          \"As this physical frame is the throne of the inner temple, ...\"      As this physical frame is the throne of the inner temple, whatever occurs  to the former is felt by the latter. In reality that which takes delight  in joy or is saddened by pain is the inner temple of the body, not the  body itself. Since this physical body is the throne whereon the inner  temple is established, God hath ordained that the body be preserved to the  extent possible, so that nothing that causeth repugnance may be  experienced. The inner temple beholdeth its physical frame, which is its  throne. Thus, if the latter is accorded respect, it is as if the former is  the recipient. The converse is likewise true.    Therefore, it hath been ordained that the dead body should be treated with  the utmost honour and respect. V, 12.          \"At the time of the appearance of Him Whom God shall ...\"      At the time of the appearance of Him Whom God shall make manifest, wert  thou to perform thy deeds for the sake of the Point of the Bayan, they  would be regarded as performed for one other than God, inasmuch as on that  Day the Point of the Bayan is none other than Him Whom God shall make  manifest...    It is for this reason that at the beginning of every Dispensation a vast  multitude, who fondly imagine that their deeds are for God, become drowned  and ungodly, and perceive this not, except such as He guideth at His  behest.    It is better for a man to guide a soul than to possess all that lies  between East and West. Likewise better is guidance for him who is guided  than all the things that exist on earth, for by reason of this guidance he  will, after his death, gain admittance into Paradise, whereas by reason of  the things of the world below, he will, after his death, receive his  deserts. Hence God desireth that all men should be guided aright through  the potency of the Words of Him Whom God shall make manifest. However,  such as are conceited will not suffer themselves to be guided. They will  be debarred from the Truth, some by reason of their learning, others on  account of their glory and power, and still others due to reasons of their  own, none of which shall be of any avail at the hour of death.    Take thou good heed that ye may all, under the leadership of Him Who is  the Source of Divine Guidance, be enabled to direct thy steps aright upon  the Bridge, which is sharper than the sword and finer than a hair, so that  perchance the things which from the beginning of thy life till the end  thou hast performed for the love of God, may not, all at once and  unrealized by thyself, be turned to acts not acceptable in the sight of  God. Verily God guideth whom He will into the path of absolute certitude.  VII, 2.          \"Everyone is eagerly awaiting His appearance, yet since ...\"      Everyone is eagerly awaiting His appearance, yet since their inner eyes  are not directed towards Him sorrow must needs befall Him. In the case of  the Apostle of God--may the blessings of God rest upon Him--before the  revelation of the Qur'an everyone bore witness to His piety and noble  virtues. Behold Him then after the revelation of the Qur'an. What  outrageous insults were levelled against Him, as indeed the pen is ashamed  to recount. Likewise behold the Point of the Bayan. His behaviour prior to  the declaration of His mission is clearly evident unto those who knew Him.  Now, following His manifestation, although He hath, up to the present,  revealed no less than five hundred thousand verses on different subjects,  behold what calumnies are uttered, so unseemly that the pen is stricken  with shame at the mention of them. But if all men were to observe the  ordinances of God no sadness would befall that heavenly Tree. VI, 11.          \"The acts of Him Whom God shall make manifest are like ...\"      The acts of Him Whom God shall make manifest are like unto the sun, while  the works of men, provided they conform to the good-pleasure of God,  resemble the stars or the moon... Thus, should the followers of the Bayan  observe the precepts of Him Whom God shall make manifest at the time of  His appearance, and regard themselves and their own works as stars exposed  to the light of the sun, then they will have gathered the fruits of their  existence; otherwise the title of 'starship' will not apply to them.  Rather it will apply to such as truly believe in Him, to those who pale  into insignificance in the day-time and gleam forth with light in the  night season.    Such indeed is the fruit of this precept, should anyone observe it on the  Day of Resurrection. This is the essence of all learning and of all  righteous deeds, should anyone but attain unto it. Had the peoples of the  world fixed their gaze upon this principle, no Exponent of divine  Revelation would ever have, at the inception of any Dispensation, regarded  them as things of naught. However, the fact is that during the night  season everyone perceiveth the light which he himself, according to his  own capacity, giveth out, oblivious that at the break of day this light  shall fade away and be reduced to utter nothingness before the dazzling  splendour of the sun.    The light of the people of the world is their knowledge and utterance;  while the splendours shed from the glorious acts of Him Whom God shall  make manifest are His Words, through whose potency He rolleth up the whole  world of existence, sets it under His Own authority by relating it unto  Himself, then as the Mouthpiece of God, the Source of His divine  light--exalted and glorified be He--proclaimeth: 'Verily, verily, I am God,  no God is there but Me; in truth all others except Me are My creatures.  Say, O My creatures! Me alone, therefore, should ye fear'. VIII, 1.          \"Know thou that in the Bayan purification is regarded as ...\"      Know thou that in the Bayan purification is regarded as the most  acceptable means for attaining nearness unto God and as the most  meritorious of all deeds. Thus purge thou thine ear that thou mayest hear  no mention besides God, and purge thine eye that it behold naught except  God, and thy conscience that it perceive naught other than God, and thy  tongue that it proclaim nothing but God, and thy hand to write naught but  the words of God, and thy knowledge that it comprehend naught except God,  and thy heart that it entertain no wish save God, and in like manner purge  all thine acts and thy pursuits that thou mayest be nurtured in the  paradise of pure love, and perchance mayest attain the presence of Him  Whom God shall make manifest, adorned with a purity which He highly  cherisheth, and be sanctified from whosoever hath turned away from Him and  doth not support Him. Thus shalt thou manifest a purity that shall profit  thee.    Know thou that every ear which hearkeneth unto His Words with true faith  shall be immune from the fire. Thus the believer, through his recognition  of Him will appreciate the transcendent character of His heavenly Words,  will whole-heartedly choose Him over others, and will refuse to incline  his affections towards those who disbelieve in Him.
