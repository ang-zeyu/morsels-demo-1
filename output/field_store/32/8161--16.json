Notes by Joseph H. Hannen    What a wonderful meeting this is! These are the children of the Kingdom.  The song we have just listened to was very beautiful in melody and words.  The art of music is divine and effective. It is the food of the soul and  spirit. Through the power and charm of music the spirit of man is  uplifted. It has wonderful sway and effect in the hearts of children, for  their hearts are pure, and melodies have great influence in them. The  latent talents with which the hearts of these children are endowed will  find expression through the medium of music. Therefore, you must exert  yourselves to make them proficient; teach them to sing with excellence and  effect. It is incumbent upon each child to know something of music, for  without knowledge of this art the melodies of instrument and voice cannot  be rightly enjoyed. Likewise, it is necessary that the schools teach it in  order that the souls and hearts of the pupils may become vivified and  exhilarated and their lives be brightened with enjoyment.    Today illumined and spiritual children are gathered in this meeting. They  are the children of the Kingdom. The Kingdom of heaven is for such souls  as these, for they are near to God. They have pure hearts. They have  spiritual faces. The effect of the divine teachings is manifest in the  perfect purity of their hearts. That is why Christ has addressed the  world, saying, \"Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye  shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven\"--that is, men must become pure  in heart to know God. The teachings have had great effect. Spiritual  souls! Tender souls! The hearts of all children are of the utmost purity.  They are mirrors upon which no dust has fallen. But this purity is on  account of weakness and innocence, not on account of any strength and  testing, for as this is the early period of their childhood, their hearts  and minds are unsullied by the world. They cannot display any great  intelligence. They have neither hypocrisy nor deceit. This is on account  of the child's weakness, whereas the man becomes pure through his  strength. Through the power of intelligence he becomes simple; through the  great power of reason and understanding and not through the power of  weakness he becomes sincere. When he attains to the state of perfection,  he will receive these qualities; his heart becomes purified, his spirit  enlightened, his soul is sensitized and tender--all through his great  strength. This is the difference between the perfect man and the child.  Both have the underlying qualities of simplicity and sincerity--the child  through the power of weakness and the man through the power of strength.    I pray in behalf of these children and beg confirmation and assistance for  them from the Kingdom of Abha so that each one may be trained under the  shadow of the protection of God, each may become like a lighted candle in  the world of humanity, a tender and growing plant in the rose garden of  Abha; that these children may be so trained and educated that they shall  give life to the world of humanity; that they may receive insight; that  they may bestow hearing upon the people of the world; that they may sow  the seeds of eternal life and be accepted in the threshold of God; that  they may become characterized with such virtues, perfections and qualities  that their mothers, fathers and relatives will be thankful to God, well  pleased and hopeful. This is my wish and prayer.    I give you my advice, and it is this: Train these children with divine  exhortations. From their childhood instill in their hearts the love of God  so they may manifest in their lives the fear of God and have confidence in  the bestowals of God. Teach them to free themselves from human  imperfections and to acquire the divine perfections latent in the heart of  man. The life of man is useful if he attains the perfections of man. If he  becomes the center of the imperfections of the world of humanity, death is  better than life, and nonexistence better than existence. Therefore, make  ye an effort in order that these children may be rightly trained and  educated and that each one of them may attain perfection in the world of  humanity. Know ye the value of these children, for they are all my  children.          24 April 1912  Talk at Home of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur J. Parsons  1700 Eighteenth Street, NW, Washington, D.C.      Notes by Joseph H. Hannen    You are welcome this afternoon, most welcome. I am ever happy to see you.  I ask God that meeting me may be productive of results; that it may not be  like ordinary gatherings, for those who hold meetings where groups of  people assemble usually have some interest to further. Praise be to God! I  have no personal interests. I have an interest in the Kingdom, and this is  a sincere intention. I have perfect love for you; therefore, I have  traveled this long distance to meet and greet you. I hope that these  gatherings may be productive of great results, and there is no greater  result than the love of God. There is no greater result than bonds of  service in the divine Kingdom and attainment to the good pleasure of the  Lord. Therefore, I desire that your hearts may be directed to the Kingdom  of God, that your intentions may be pure and sincere, your purposes turned  toward altruistic accomplishment unmindful of your own welfare; nay,  rather, may all your intentions center in the welfare of humanity, and may  you seek to sacrifice yourselves in the pathway of devotion to mankind.  Even as Jesus Christ forfeited His life, may you, likewise, offer  yourselves in the threshold of sacrifice for the betterment of the world;  and just as Baha'u'llah suffered severe ordeals and calamities nearly  fifty years for you, may you be willing to undergo difficulties and  withstand catastrophes for humanity in general. May you bear these trials  and tests most willingly and joyously, for every night is followed by a  day, and every day has a night. Every spring has an autumn, and every  autumn has its spring. The coming of a Manifestation of God is the season  of spiritual spring. For instance, the appearance of Christ was a divine  springtime. Therefore, it caused a great commotion and vibrant movement in  the world of humanity. The Sun of Reality dawned, the cloud of mercy  poured down its rain, the breezes of providence moved, the world became a  new world, mankind reflected an extraordinary radiance, souls were  educated, minds were developed, intelligences became acute, and the human  world attained a new freshness of life, like unto the advent of spring.  Then gradually that spring was followed by the autumn of death and decay.  The teachings of Christ were forgotten. The Christly bounties ceased.  Divine moralities disappeared. Day ended in night. The people became  negligent and oblivious. Minds weakened until conditions reached such a  crisis that material science rose in the ascendant. Knowledge and sciences  of the Kingdom became obsolete, the mysteries of God deepened, and the  traces of the bounties of Christ were completely obliterated. The nations  were enmeshed in superstition and blind imitation. Discord and  disagreement arose, culminating in strife, war and bloodshed. Hearts were  torn asunder in violence. Various denominations appeared, diverse sects  and creeds arose, and the whole world was plunged into darkness.    At such a time as this Baha'u'llah dawned from the horizon of Persia. He  reformed and renewed the fundamentals and realities of Christ's teachings.  He endured the greatest difficulties and underwent the severest ordeals.    Praise be to God that the teachings of God are revoiced, the light of  reality has dawned again, the effulgence is increasing daily, and the  radiance is shining more gloriously in the zenith. From the cloud of mercy  a deluge is descending; the Sun of Reality is brilliant in its eternal  station. Again we are hopeful that the same springtime may pitch its tent  and that these boundless bestowals may appear once more among us. Through  your efforts and sincerity this is made possible. If you arise in the  Cause of God with divine power, heavenly grace, the sincerity of the  Kingdom, a merciful heart and decisive intention, it is certain that the  world of humanity will be entirely illumined, the moralities of mankind  will become merciful, the foundations of the Most Great Peace will be  laid, and the oneness of the kingdom of man will become a reality. This is  the great bounty I desire for you, and I pray and supplicate the divine  threshold, imploring in your behalf.    O Thou merciful God! O Thou Who art mighty and powerful! O Thou most kind  Father! These servants have gathered together, turning to Thee,  supplicating Thy threshold, desiring Thine endless bounties from Thy great  assurance. They have no purpose save Thy good pleasure. They have no  intention save service to the world of humanity.    O God! Make this assemblage radiant. Make the hearts merciful. Confer the  bounties of the Holy Spirit. Endow them with a power from heaven. Bless  them with heavenly minds. Increase their sincerity, so that with all  humility and contrition they may turn to Thy kingdom and be occupied with  service to the world of humanity. May each one become a radiant candle.  May each one become a brilliant star. May each one become beautiful in  color and redolent of fragrance in the Kingdom of God.    O kind Father! Confer Thy blessings. Consider not our shortcomings.  Shelter us under Thy protection. Remember not our sins. Heal us with Thy  mercy. We are weak; Thou art mighty. We are poor; Thou art rich. We are  sick; Thou art the Physician. We are needy; Thou art most generous.    O God! Endow us with Thy providence. Thou art the Powerful. Thou art the  Giver. Thou art the Beneficent.          24 April"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19287"],[0,"Selections from the Writings of `Abdu'l-Bahá (#15)"],[1,"make mindful those who are unaware, and bring in the outcast to be  intimates of the inner circle, and bestow upon the destitute their portion  of eternal grace. Let them be heralds of the Kingdom, and call out to the  denizens of this nether world, and summon them to enter the realm on high.    O army of God! Today, in this world, every people is wandering astray in  its own desert, moving here and there according to the dictates of its  fancies and whims, pursuing its own particular caprice. Amongst all the  teeming masses of the earth, only this community of the Most Great Name is  free and clear of human schemes and hath no selfish purpose to promote.  Alone amongst them all, this people hath arisen with aims purified of  self, following the Teachings of God, most eagerly toiling and striving  toward a single goal: to turn this nether dust into high heaven, to make  of this world a mirror for the Kingdom, to change this world into a  different world, and cause all humankind to adopt the ways of  righteousness and a new manner of life.    O army of God! Through the protection and help vouchsafed by the Blessed  Beauty--may my life be a sacrifice to His loved ones--ye must conduct  yourselves in such a manner that ye may stand out distinguished and  brilliant as the sun among other souls. Should any one of you enter a  city, he should become a centre of attraction by reason of his sincerity,  his faithfulness and love, his honesty and fidelity, his truthfulness and  loving-kindness towards all the peoples of the world, so that the people  of that city may cry out and say: 'This man is unquestionably a Baha'i,  for his manners, his behaviour, his conduct, his morals, his nature, and  disposition reflect the attributes of the Baha'is.' Not until ye attain  this station can ye be said to have been faithful to the Covenant and  Testament of God. For He hath, through irrefutable Texts, entered into a  binding Covenant with us all, requiring us to act in accordance with His  sacred instructions and counsels.    O army of God! The time hath come for the effects and perfections of the  Most Great Name to be made manifest in this excellent age, so as to  establish, beyond any doubt, that this era is the era of Baha'u'llah, and  this age is distinguished above all other ages.    O army of God! Whensoever ye behold a person whose entire attention is  directed toward the Cause of God; whose only aim is this, to make the Word  of God to take effect; who, day and night, with pure intent, is rendering  service to the Cause; from whose behaviour not the slightest trace of  egotism or private motives is discerned--who, rather, wandereth distracted  in the wilderness of the love of God, and drinketh only from the cup of  the knowledge of God, and is utterly engrossed in spreading the sweet  savours of God, and is enamoured of the holy verses of the Kingdom of  God--know ye for a certainty that this individual will be supported and  reinforced by heaven; that like unto the morning star, he will forever  gleam brightly out of the skies of eternal grace. But if he show the  slightest taint of selfish desires and self love, his efforts will lead to  nothing and he will be destroyed and left hopeless at the last.    O army of God! Praise be to God, Baha'u'llah hath lifted the chains from  off the necks of humankind, and hath set man free from all that trammelled  him, and told him: Ye are the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one  branch; be ye compassionate and kind to all the human race. Deal ye with  strangers the same as with friends, cherish ye others just as ye would  your own. See foes as friends; see demons as angels; give to the tyrant  the same great love ye show the loyal and true, and even as gazelles from  the scented cities of _Kh_ata and _Kh_utan(28) offer up sweet musk to the  ravening wolf. Be ye a refuge to the fearful; bring ye rest and peace to  the disturbed; make ye a provision for the destitute; be a treasury of  riches for the poor; be a healing medicine for those who suffer pain; be  ye doctor and nurse to the ailing; promote ye friendship, and honour, and  conciliation, and devotion to God, in this world of non-existence.    O army of God! Make ye a mighty effort: perchance ye can flood this earth  with light, that this mud hut, the world, may become the Abha Paradise.  The dark hath taken over, and the brute traits prevail. This world of man  is now an arena for wild beasts, a field where the ignorant, the heedless,  seize their chance. The souls of men are ravening wolves and animals with  blinded eyes, they are either deadly poison or useless weeds--all except  for a very few who indeed do nurture altruistic aims and plans for the  well-being of their fellow men: but ye must in this matter--that is, the  serving of humankind--lay down your very lives, and as ye yield yourselves,  rejoice.    O army of God! The Exalted One, the Bab, gave up His life. The Blessed  Perfection gave up a hundred lives at every breath. He bore calamities. He  suffered anguish. He was imprisoned. He was chained. He was made homeless  and was banished to distant lands. Finally, then, He lived out His days in  the Most Great Prison. Likewise, a great multitude of the lovers of God  who followed this path have tasted the honey of martyrdom and they gave up  everything--life, possessions, kindred--all they had. How many homes were  reduced to rubble; how many dwellings were broken into and pillaged; how  many a noble building went to the ground; how many a palace was battered  into a tomb. And all this came about that humankind might be illumined,  that ignorance might yield to knowledge, that men of earth might become  men of heaven, that discord and dissension might be torn out by the roots,  and the Kingdom of Peace become established over all the world. Strive ye  now that this bounty become manifest, and this best-beloved of all hopes  be realized in splendour throughout the community of man.    O army of God! Beware lest ye harm any soul, or make any heart to sorrow;  lest ye wound any man with your words, be he known to you or a stranger,  be he friend or foe. Pray ye for all; ask ye that all be blessed, all be  forgiven. Beware, beware, lest any of you seek vengeance, even against one  who is thirsting for your blood. Beware, beware, lest ye offend the  feelings of another, even though he be an evil-doer, and he wish you ill.  Look ye not upon the creatures, turn ye to their Creator. See ye not the  never-yielding people, see but the Lord of Hosts. Gaze ye not down upon  the dust, gaze upward at the shining sun, which hath caused every patch of  darksome earth to glow with light.    O army of God! When calamity striketh, be ye patient and composed. However  afflictive your sufferings may be, stay ye undisturbed, and with perfect  confidence in the abounding grace of God, brave ye the tempest of  tribulations and fiery ordeals.    Last year a number of the unfaithful, both from within and from without,  both known to us and strangers, took before the Sultan of Turkey  slanderous charges against these homeless exiles, bringing against us  grave accusations with no basis in fact. The Government, conformably with  prudence, determined to look into these charges, and dispatched a  Commission of Investigation to this city. It is obvious what an  opportunity this afforded our ill-wishers, and what a storm they  unleashed, all this beyond description by tongue or pen. Only one who  witnessed it could know what a turmoil they created and what an earthquake  of anguish was the result. And notwithstanding this, the response was to  depend utterly upon God, and to remain composed, confident,  long-suffering, undisturbed, to such a degree that a person knowing  nothing of the situation would have thought us easy of heart and mind,  perfectly happy, thriving and at peace.    Then it came about that the accusers themselves, those who had made the  defamatory charges against us, joined with the members of the Commission  to investigate the accusations, so that plaintiffs, witnesses and judge  were all one and the same, and the conclusion was foregone. Nevertheless,  to be fair, it must be stated that up to now His Majesty the Sultan of  Turkey hath paid no heed to these false charges, this defamation, these  fables and traducements, and hath acted with justice....    O Thou Provider! Thou hast breathed over the friends in the West the sweet  fragrance of the Holy Spirit, and with the light of divine guidance Thou  hast lit up the western sky. Thou hast made those who were once remote to  draw near unto Thyself; Thou hast turned strangers into loving friends;  Thou hast awakened those who slept; Thou hast made the heedless mindful.    O Thou Provider! Assist Thou these noble friends to win Thy good pleasure,  and make them well-wishers of stranger and friend alike. Bring them into  the world that abideth forever; grant them a portion of heavenly grace;  cause them to be true Baha'is, sincerely of God; save them from outward  semblances, and establish them firmly in the truth. Make them signs and  tokens of the Kingdom, luminous stars above the horizons of this nether  life. Make them to be a comfort and a solace to humankind and servants to  the peace of the world. Exhilarate them with the wine of Thy counsel, and  grant that all of them may tread the path of Thy commandments.    O Thou Provider! The dearest wish of this servant of Thy Threshold is to  behold the friends of east and west in close embrace; to see all the  members of human society gathered with love in a single great assemblage,  even as individual drops of water collected in one mighty sea; to behold  them all as birds in one garden of roses, as pearls of one ocean, as  leaves of one tree, as rays of one sun.    Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful, and Thou art the God of strength, the  Omnipotent, the All-Seeing.            36: O YE TWO FAVOURED HANDMAIDS OF THE"]]]
