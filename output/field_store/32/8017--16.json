Ammonia and acetic acid, holding an indefinite position in the order we  have laid down, may also come in here without much criticism, being  considered as primitive odors.    On terminating our remarks relating to the simple preparations of the  odors of plants, and before we speak of perfumes of an animal origin, or  of those compound _odors_ sold as bouquets, nosegays, &c., it may  probably be interesting to give a few facts and statistics, showing the  consumption, in England, of the several substances previously named.    QUANTITIES OF ESSENTIAL OILS, OR OTTOS, PAYING 1_S._ PER POUND DUTY,  ENTERED FOR HOME CONSUMPTION IN THE YEAR 1852.                                                                lbs.

The fact is, several of the English wholesale druggists are very  large distillers of this otto, leaving little or no room for the sale  and importation of foreign distilled otto of cloves. Again, otto of  caraway, the English production of that article is quite equal to the  foreign; also, otto of lavender, which is drawn in this country probably  to the extent of 6000 lbs. annually.    There were also passed through the Custom House for home consumption, in  1852--    Pomatums, procured by enfleurage, maceration,    &c., commonly called \"French Pomatums,\"    average value of 6_s._ per pound, and paying    a duty of 1_s._ per pound, valued by the importers    at                                                      L1,306  Perfumery not otherwise described; value                  L1,920    Number of bottles of eau de Cologne, paying  a duty of 1_s._ each,[D]                  19,777    Revenue from eau de Cologne manufactured out of England, say 20,000  flacons at 8_d._ = 8,000_l._ annually.    The total revenue derived from various sources, even upon this low scale  of duties, from the substances with which \"Britannia perfumes her pocket  handkerchief,\" cannot be estimated at less than 40,000_l._ per annum.  This, of course, includes the duty upon the spirits used in the home  manufacture of perfumery.          SECTION IV.    PERFUMES OF ANIMAL ORIGIN.      In the previous articles we have only spoken of the odors of plants; we  now enter upon those materials used in perfumery of an animal origin.  The first under our notice is--    AMBERGRIS.--This substance is found in the sea, floating near  the islands of Sumatra, Molucca, and Madagascar; also on the coasts of  America, Brazil, China, Japan, and the Coromandel. The western coast of  Ireland is often found to yield large pieces of this substance. The  shores of the counties of Sligo, Mayo, Kerry, and the isles of Arran,  are the principal places where it has been found. In the \"Philosophical  Transactions\" there is an account of a lump found on the beach of the  first-mentioned county, in the year 1691, which weighed 52 oz., and was  bought on the spot for 20_l._, but which afterwards was sold in London  for more than 100_l._ (Philos. Trans. No. 227, p. 509). We are quite  within limit in stating that many volumes concerning the origin of  ambergris have been written, but the question respecting it is still at  issue. It is found in the stomachs of the most voracious fishes, these  animals swallowing, at particular times, everything they happen to meet  with. It has been particularly found in the intestines of the spermaceti  whale, and most commonly in sickly fish, whence it is supposed to be the  cause or effect of the disease.    Some authors, and among them Robert Boyle, consider it to be of  vegetable production, and analogous to amber; hence its name  amber-_gris_ (gray) gray amber. It is not, however, within the province  of this work to discuss upon the various theories about its production,  which could probably be satisfactorily explained if our modern  appliances were brought to bear upon the subject. The field is open to  any scientific enthusiast; all recent authors who mention it, merely  quoting the facts known more than a century ago.    A modern compiler, speaking of ambergris, says, \"It smells like dried  cow-dung.\" Never having smelled this latter substance, we cannot say  whether the simile be correct; but we certainly consider that its  perfume is most incredibly overrated; nor can we forget that  HOMBERG found that \"a vessel in which he had made a long  digestion of the human faeces had acquired a very strong and perfect  smell of ambergris, insomuch that any one would have thought that a  great quantity of essence of ambergris had been made in it. The perfume  (_odor!_) was so strong that the vessel was obliged to be moved out of  the laboratory.\" (Mem. Acad. Paris, 1711.)    Nevertheless, as ambergris is extensively used as a perfume, in  deference to those who admire its odor, we presume that it has to many  an agreeable smell.    Like bodies of this kind undergoing a slow decomposition and possessing  little volatility, it, when mixed with other very fleeting scents, gives  permanence to them on the handkerchief, and for this quality the  perfumer esteems it much.    ESSENCE OF AMBERGRIS    Is only kept for mixing; when retailed it has to be sweetened up to the  public nose; it is then called after the Parisian name    EXTRAIT D'AMBRE.    Esprit de rose triple,       1/2 pint.  Extract of ambergris,          1  \"  Essence of musk,             1/4  \"  Extract of vanilla,          2 ounces.    This perfume has such a lasting odor, that a handkerchief being well  perfumed with it, will still retain an odor even after it has been  washed.    The fact is, that both musk and ambergris contain a substance which  clings pertinaciously to woven fabrics, and not being soluble in weak  alkaline lyes, is still found upon the material after passing through  the lavatory ordeal.    Powdered ambergris is used in the manufacture of cassolettes--little  ivory or bone boxes perforated--which are made to contain a paste of  strong-smelling substances, to carry in the pocket or reticule; also in  the making of peau d'Espagne, or Spanish skin, used for perfuming  writing paper and envelopes, and which will be described hereafter.    [Illustration: Civet Cat.]    CIVET.--This substance is secreted by the _Viverra civetta_, or  civet cat. It is formed in a large double glandular receptacle between  the anus and the pudendum of the creature. Like many other substances of  Oriental origin, it was first brought to this country by the Dutch.    When the civet cats are kept in a state of confinement, which at one  time was common in Amsterdam, they are placed in strong cages, so  constructed as to prevent the animal from turning round and biting the  person employed in collecting the secreted substance. This operation is  said to be performed twice a week, and is done by scraping out the civet  with a small spoon: about a drachm at a time is thus obtained. A good  deal of the civet now brought to European markets is from Calicut,  capital of the province of Malabar, and from Bassora on the Euphrates.    In its pure state, civet has, to nearly all persons, a most disgusting  odor; but when diluted to an infinitesimal portion, its perfume is  agreeable. It is difficult to ascertain the reason why the same  substance, modified only by the quantity of matter presented to the  nose, should produce an opposite effect on the olfactory nerve; but such  is the case with nearly all odorous bodies, especially with ottos,  which, if smelled at, are far from nice, and in some cases, positively  nasty--such as otto of neroli, otto of thyme, otto of patchouly; but if  diluted with a thousand times its volume of oil, spirit, &c., then their  fragrance is delightful.    Otto of rose to many has a sickly odor, but when eliminated in the  homeopathic quantities as it rises from a single rose-bloom, who is it  that will not admit that \"the rose is sweet?\" The odor of civet is best  imparted, not by actual contact, but by being placed in the neighborhood  of absorbent materials. Thus, when spread upon leather, which, being  covered with silk and placed in a writing-desk, perfumes the paper and  envelopes delightfully, and so much so, that they retain the odor after  passing through the post.    EXTRACT OF CIVET is prepared by rubbing in a mortar one ounce  of civet with an ounce of orris-root powder, or any other similar  material that will assist to break up or divide the civet; and then  placing the whole into a gallon of rectified spirits; after macerating  for a month, it is fit to strain off. It is principally used as a  \"fixing\" ingredient, in mixing essences of delicate odor. The French  perfumers use the extract of civet more than English manufacturers, who  seem to prefer extract of musk. From a quarter of a pint to half a pint  is the utmost that ought to be mixed with a gallon"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16399"],[0,"A Winter Tour in South Africa (#15)"],[1,"on the land.       Unfortunately, that state of affairs does not exist at the present       time in South Africa, and that brings us face to face with the       great problem on which Sir Frederick Young has touched--the great       problem which we have always before us--viz., how two races utterly       alien to each other, the black and the white, are to live and       increase side by side. South Africa is the only country in the       world where that problem exists, excepting the Southern States of       North America. This is a great question, on which the future of       South Africa depends. Unfortunately, the white men do not work in a       country where the black race flourishes. If the white man does not       become a \"boss,\" he sinks to the level of a mean white man. The       difficulty is to get a state of society in which the white race       shall flourish side by side with the black; and when people talk       about the \"local politicians,\" the \"average Cape politician,\" and       the like, they should remember we have to deal with this enormous       problem--that we are anxious to do justice to the \"black,\" and at       the same time we are naturally anxious to see the European       population flourish. I believe the gold fields will attract a       large European population. The wages are enormous. There are 20,000       black men, without a stitch upon them, earning as much as eighteen       shillings a week a-piece, and getting as much food as they can eat,       in the mines of Johannesburg. People talk about the treatment of       the blacks. Nobody dares to treat them badly, because they would       run away. There is a competition for them, and the black man has an       uncommonly rosy time of it. The white men naturally won't work       under the same conditions as the blacks. I saw a letter from an       operative cautioning his fellow artisans against going out. He       says, \"We get thirty shillings a day, but it is a dreadful place to       live in.\" I ask the operatives in England to mistrust that       statement. (\"What is the cost of living?\") You can live at the club       very well indeed for L10 a month--the club, mind you, where the       aristocracy live. It is idle to tell me the honest artisan cannot       live. In addition to the black and white population, there is       another problem, and that is, the influx of Arabs, who creep down       the East Coast through the door of Natal. They are gradually       ousting the English retail trader. You may go to up-country towns,       and in whole streets you will see these yellow fellows, sitting       there in their muslin dresses, where formerly there were English       traders. In places where we want to cultivate the English       population, that is a very serious thing. Our yellow friends come       under the garb of British subjects from Bombay, and are making       nests in the Transvaal and elsewhere by ousting the English retail       trader. Sir Frederick Young has alluded to State colonisation. I am       sorry to differ from so amiable a critic of our ways, but, as one       who has had a little experience, I can tell him that you may send       Colonists out, but you cannot as easily make them stay there. If       they make their fortunes, they come home to England to spend them.       If they are poor, and bad times come, the black man crowds them       out, and off they go to Australia. You can depend on a German       peasant settling, but bring an Englishman or a Scotchman, and he       wants to better himself. In that he is quite right, but he does not       see his way on a small plot of ground, and off he goes down a mine,       or something of that sort. There are great difficulties in the way       of State-aided emigration. We do not want the riff-raff; we don't       want the \"surplus population.\" It is one of the greatest       difficulties to get decent, steady Englishmen to settle on the       land. It is the people who settle on the land who make a country,       and if Sir Frederick Young can give us a receipt for making English       people settle there he will confer one of the greatest possible       benefits on South Africa. Sir Frederick Young departed from the       usual custom on such occasions by touching on politics. I am glad       he did, because more interest is given to the discussion, and there       is nothing like good, healthy controversy. Sir Frederick Young is       greatly concerned that there should be a settled policy for South       Africa. All I can say is, in Heaven's name, don't listen to a syren       voice of that kind. So surely as you have a settled policy--some       great and grand scheme--so surely will follow disaster and       disgrace. The people of South Africa may be very stupid, but they       are very much like other people--determined to make their policy       themselves, and the policy of South Africa is not going to be       framed in Downing Street. I cannot help thinking Sir Frederick       Young did injustice to some of my friends who have been at the head       of affairs. \"The mournful mismanagement of South African affairs,\"       he says, \"during the last twenty-five years, and most especially       during the last decade, has been truly lamentable, and cannot fail       to awaken the saddest feelings on the part of every loyal Briton       and true-hearted patriot.\" But have affairs been mismanaged for the       last twenty-five years? The revenue twenty-five years ago was       L500,000. It is now nearly L4,000,000. For twenty-five years, under       the beneficent rule of Downing Street, we had not a mile of       railway. Now we have 2,000 miles. Twenty-five years ago there was       no national feeling at all. Now there is a strong South African       feeling, which is destined to grow and build up a South African       policy. As to the talk about a settled and firm policy, Sir Philip       Wodehouse was the last Governor who had a grand scheme from Downing       Street. A more honest, conscientious, and able man did not exist;       but his policy was a failure. Then came my friend Sir Henry Barkly.       His policy was distinctly opposite. It was a true policy for South       Africa. It was a policy of _laissez-faire_. The result was, things       went on as merrily as a marriage bell, Dutch and English drew       together, the natives were quiet, South Africa was prosperous, and       everything went on as happily as possible till Mr. Froude and Lord       Carnarvon hit on the grand scheme of uniting South Africa. From       that day our misfortunes began. One of the most able, courteous,       and high-minded gentlemen in the British service--Sir Bartle       Frere--was sent to carry out this firm policy. What was the result?       Failure. I will say nothing more about it. Then Sir Hercules       Robinson reverted to the _laissez-faire_ policy. South Africa was       under a shade--nobody would look at us. But now we are gradually       righting ourselves, and getting into a prosperous condition. Now       are being raised again the cries for a grand policy. I caution you       against them. Let us manage our own affairs. _Laissez faire,       laissez aller_--that is our policy for South Africa. There are no       nostrums required. The one thing required is the gradual bringing       of the Dutch and English together. There are no two races more       fitted to unite. You know how like they are to Englishmen. The Boer       is as like the English farmer as possible. There are no people more       fond of manly sports than the Dutch; they enter into them       heartily, and in the cricket and football fields they are among the       best players. They are as fond of riding and shooting as Englishmen       are. In fact, the Dutch and the English are as like as Heaven can       make them, and the only thing that keeps them apart is man's       prejudice. The one thing to do is to bring them together. How can       you help that end? Not by girding at them, and writing against Boer       ways, but by recognising the fact that they have been pioneers in       South Africa, and that they are the only people who will settle on       the land. I see there is a great agitation about Swaziland, which       is entirely surrounded by the Transvaal Republic. (\"No.\") Well,       except as to Tongaland, and I am not going to say anything about       that. The cry is got up, \"Don't hand it over to the Boers.\" In       whose interest is that cry got up? It is in the interest of a few       speculators, and not in the interest of the capitalists, who have       L108,000,000 invested in the Transvaal, and yet are not afraid to       trust the Boers with Swaziland. This girding at the Dutch is       resented, and does incalculable harm. People at home have very       little idea how much influence public opinion in England has in       South Africa. Sir Frederick Young has alluded to President Kruger,       who won't put down prize fights because he might be thought to be       oppressing the Englishman! All I ask is, don't let your talk about       union with the Dutch be mere lip service. Trust them; work hand in       hand with them. Unless you do you will make little progress in       South Africa. By that I mean political progress. The material       progress of South Africa is now secured; therefore my advice       is--cultivate the Dutch, because, unless they are our friends, we       shall be a divided people, and our black and yellow brethren will       get the best of us. Our true policy is, _Laissez faire, laissez       aller_.         Sir G. BADEN-POWELL, K.C.M.G., M.P.: My friend, Mr. Merriman, has       made a speech of the utmost value to South Africa, and it is a       very fitting, I will not say reply, but comment, on the address to       which we have listened with such pleasure; but Mr. Merriman, with       his"]]]
