The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of  it, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge's part, would have disclosed the  face. He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to  do it; but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the  spectre at his side.    Oh, cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and  dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command: for this is thy  dominion! But of the loved, revered, and honoured head thou canst not  turn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is  not that the hand is heavy, and will fall down when released; it is not  that the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand WAS open,  generous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender; and the pulse a  man's. Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds springing from the  wound, to sow the world with life immortal!    No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and yet he heard them  when he looked upon the bed. He thought, if this man could be raised up  now, what would be his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard dealing, griping  cares? They have brought him to a rich end, truly!    He lay, in the dark, empty house, with not a man, a woman, or a child to  say he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one kind  word I will be kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was  a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone. What _they_ wanted in  the room of death, and why they were so restless and disturbed, Scrooge  did not dare to think.    \"Spirit!\" he said, \"this is a fearful place. In leaving it, I shall not  leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!\"    Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.    \"I understand you,\" Scrooge returned, \"and I would do it if I could. But  I have not the power, Spirit. I have not the power.\"    Again it seemed to look upon him.    \"If there is any person in the town who feels emotion caused by this  man's death,\" said Scrooge, quite agonised, \"show that person to me,  Spirit! I beseech you.\"    The Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing;  and, withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight, where a mother and her  children were.    She was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness; for she walked  up and down the room; started at every sound; looked out from the  window; glanced at the clock; tried, but in vain, to work with her  needle; and could hardly bear the voices of her children in their play.    At length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried to the door,  and met her husband; a man whose face was careworn and depressed, though  he was young. There was a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of  serious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to  repress.    He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire,  and, when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a  long silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.    \"Is it good,\" she said, \"or bad?\" to help him.    \"Bad,\" he answered.    \"We are quite ruined?\"    \"No. There is hope yet, Caroline.\"    \"If _he_ relents,\" she said, amazed, \"there is! Nothing is past hope, if  such a miracle has happened.\"    \"He is past relenting,\" said her husband. \"He is dead.\"    She was a mild and patient creature, if her face spoke truth; but she  was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so with clasped hands.  She prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry; but the first was  the emotion of her heart.    \"What the half-drunken woman, whom I told you of last night, said to me  when I tried to see him and obtain a week's delay, and what I thought  was a mere excuse to avoid me, turns out to have been quite true. He was  not only very ill, but dying, then.\"    \"To whom will our debt be transferred?\"    \"I don't know. But, before that time, we shall be ready with the money;  and, even though we were not, it would be bad fortune indeed to find so  merciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep to-night with light  hearts, Caroline!\"    Yes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter. The children's  faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little  understood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man's  death! The only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by the  event, was one of pleasure.    \"Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,\" said Scrooge; \"or  that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now, will be for ever  present to me.\"    The Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet;  and, as they went along, Scrooge looked here and there to find himself,  but nowhere was he to be seen. They entered poor Bob Cratchit's  house,--the dwelling he had visited before,--and found the mother and  the children seated round the fire.    Quiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues  in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him.  The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. But surely they  were very quiet!    \"'And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them.'\"    Where had Scrooge heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy  must have read them out, as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why  did he not go on?    The mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her  face.    \"The colour hurts my eyes,\" she said.    The colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!    \"They're better now again,\" said Cratchit's wife. \"It makes them weak by  candle-light; and I wouldn't show weak eyes to your father, when he  comes home, for the world. It must be near his time.\"    \"Past it rather,\" Peter answered, shutting up his book. \"But I think he  has walked a little slower than he used, these few last evenings,  mother.\"    They were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a steady, cheerful  voice, that only faltered once:    \"I have known him walk with--I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon  his shoulder very fast indeed.\"    \"And so have I,\" cried Peter. \"Often.\"    \"And so have I,\" exclaimed another. So had all.    \"But he was very light to carry,\" she resumed, intent upon her work,  \"and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble: no trouble. And  there is your father at the door!\"    She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter--he had  need of it, poor fellow--came in. His tea was ready for him on the hob,  and they all tried who should help him to it most. Then the two young  Cratchits got upon his knees, and laid, each child, a little cheek  against his face, as if they said, \"Don't mind it, father. Don't be  grieved!\"    Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family.  He looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed  of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would be done long before Sunday,  he said.    \"Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?\" said his wife.    \"Yes, my dear,\" returned Bob. \"I wish you could have gone. It would have  done you good to see how green a place it is. But you'll see it often. I  promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little  child!\" cried Bob. \"My little child!\"    He broke down all at once. He couldn't help it. If he could have helped  it, he and his child would have been farther apart, perhaps, than they  were.    He left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above, which was  lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas. There was a chair set close  beside the child, and there were signs of some one having been there  lately. Poor Bob sat down in it, and, when he had thought a little and  composed himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what  had happened, and went down again quite happy.    They drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother working  still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr. Scrooge's  nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, meeting him in the  street that day, and seeing that he looked a little--\"just a little  down, you know,\" said Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him.  \"On which,\" said Bob, \"for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman you  ever heard, I told him. 'I am heartily sorry for it, Mr. Cratchit,' he  said, 'and heartily sorry for your good wife.' By-the-bye, how he ever  knew _that_ I don't know.\"    \"Knew what, my dear?\"    \"Why, that you were a good wife,\" replied Bob.    \"Everybody knows that,\" said Peter.    \"Very well observed, my boy!\" cried Bob. \"I hope they do. 'Heartily  sorry,' he said, 'for your good wife. If I can be of service to you in  any way,' he said, giving me his card, 'that's where I live. Pray come  to me.' Now, it wasn't,\" cried Bob, \"for the sake of anything he might  be able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite  delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim, and felt  with us.\"    \"I'm sure he's a good soul!\" said Mrs. Cratchit.    \"You would be sure of it, my dear,\" returned Bob, \"if you saw and spoke  to him. I shouldn't be at all surprised--mark what I say!--if he got  Peter a better situation.\"    \"Only hear that, Peter,\" said Mrs. Cratchit.    \"And then,\" cried one of the girls, \"Peter will be keeping company with  some one, and setting up for himself.\"    \"Get along with you!\" retorted Peter, grinning.    \"It's just as likely as not,\" said Bob, \"one of these days; though  there's plenty of time for that, my dear. But, however and whenever we  part from one another, I am sure we shall none of us forget poor Tiny  Tim--shall we--or this first parting that there was among us?\"    \"Never, father!\" cried they all.    \"And I know,\" said Bob, \"I know, my dears, that when we recollect how  patient and how mild he was, although he was a little, little child, we  shall not quarrel easily among ourselves, and forget poor Tiny"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19354"],[0,"Lessons in Music Form (#15)"],[1,"beginning and an unmistakable re-announcement of the  first (leading) phrase or phrases of the composition.    Nothing could be more natural than such corroboration.  Any line of  conduct, if pursued without deviation, simply carries its object  farther and farther away from its origin.  If, as in the circle, this  line is led back to the starting-point, it describes the most  satisfying and perfect figure; it perfects, by enclosing space.  Whereas, if it goes straight onward, it ultimately loses itself, or  loses, at least, its connection with its beginning and source.    Nowhere is this principle of _Return_ more significant and imperative  than in music, which, because of its intangibility, has need of every  means that may serve to define and illuminate its design; and hence the  superior frequency and perfection of the Three-Part form, _which, in  its Third Part, provides for and executes this Return to the  beginning_.  Its superiority and greater adaptability is fully  confirmed in the practice of composition; the number of Three-Part  forms exceeds the Two-Part, in musical literature, to an almost  surprising degree; and it may therefore be regarded as the design  peculiarly adapted to the purposes of ordinary music writing within  average limits.    The three successive divisions of the Three-Part Song-form may then be  characterized as follows:--      PART I.--The statement of the principal idea; the presentation of the  melodic and rhythmic contents of the leading thought, out of which the  whole composition is to be developed.  It is generally a period-form,  at least, closing with a firm perfect cadence in the principal key, or  one of its related keys.      PART II.--The departure (more or less emphatic) from this leading  melodic statement.  It is, for a time, probably an evident continuation  and development of the melodic theme embodied in the First Part; but it  does not end there; it exhibits a retrospective bent, and--when  thoroughly legitimate--its last few measures prepare for, and lead  into, the melodic member with which the piece began.  Its form is  optional; but, as a rule, decisive cadence-impressions are avoided,  unless it be the composer's intention to _close_ it with a perfect  cadence (upon any _other_ than the principal tonic), and accomplish the  \"return to the beginning\" by means of a separate returning passage,  called the Re-transition.      PART III.--The recurrence and corroboration of the original statement;  _the reproduction of Part I_, and therewith the fulfilment of the  important principle of return and confirmation.  The reproduction is  sometimes exact and complete; sometimes slight changes, or even  striking variations, possibly certain radical alterations, occur;  sometimes it is only a partial recurrence, the first few measures being  sufficient to prove the \"Return\"; sometimes, on the other hand,  considerable material (more or less related) is added, so that Part III  is longer than the First Part.    From this it appears that much latitude is given to the composer, in  his formulation of the Third Part.  All that the Part has to prove, is  its identity as confirmation of the leading motive, and this it may do  in many ways, and with great freedom of detail, without obscuring the  main purpose.  It is precisely this richness of opportunity, this  freedom of detail, which enhances the beauty and value of the  tripartite forms.    The following is a very regular example of the Three-Part Song-form  (Schumann, op. 68, No. 20):--    [Illustration: Example 53.  Fragment of Schumann.]    [Illustration: Example 53 continued.]      This version is as complete as it can conveniently be made upon one  single staff (chosen in order to economize space); but the student will  find the formal design somewhat more plastically defined in the  original, complete form, and he is therefore expected to refer to the  latter.  Part I is an unusually regular double-period, with three  semicadences and a strong perfect cadence, on the original tonic, to  mark its conclusion; the double-bar is an additional confirmation of  the end of the Part.  The second Part runs in the key of E major (the  dominant of the original key) throughout; its form is only a phrase,  but repeated,--as is proven by the almost literal agreement of the  second phrase with the preceding one, _cadence and all_.  Part III  agrees literally with Part I in its melodic formation, but differs a  little in the treatment of the lower (accompanying) voices.    In the theme of Mendelssohn's pianoforte Variations in E-flat major  (op. 82), which see, the design is as follows:--Part I is a period of  eight measures.  Part II is also an 8-measure period, ending upon the  tonic chord of B-flat major (the dominant key), as first eighth-note of  the 16th measure; the following eighth-note, b-natural, represents what  we have called the Retransition (in its smallest conceivable form), as  it fulfils no other purpose than that of leading back into the first  tone of the First Part.  Part III is _only a phrase_, and therefore  shorter than Part I; but it corroborates the _beginning_, and, in fact,  the entire contents of the First Part.    The plan of Mendelssohn's 28th Song Without Words is as follows:--First  number the 38 measures, _carefully_.  The first four measures are an  introductory phrase, or prelude; Part I begins in the second half of  measure 4 (after the double-bar) and extends, as regular 8-measure  period, to measure 12.  Part II follows, during the same measure; its  form is a period, extending to measure 20, and closing with a very  distinctly marked semicadence on the dominant chord (chord of D).  Part  III is 14 measures long, containing therefore six more measures than  the First Part; its first phrase is almost exactly like the first  phrase of Part I; its second phrase (measures 25-28) differs from any  portion of Part I, but closely resembles the melodic formation of Part  II; its third phrase is based upon the preceding one (_not_ as  repetition, however), and is expanded to the 34th measure.  The form of  Part III is phrase-group.  The last four measures are codetta, or  postlude, and corroborate the prelude.    For exhaustive technical details of the Three-Part Song-form, see the  HOMOPHOBIC FORMS, Chapters 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.      LESSON 10.--Analyze the following examples of the Three-Part Song-form.  The first step, here again, is to fix _the end of the First Part_; the  next, to mark the beginning of the Third Part, by determining where the  _return to the beginning_ is made.  These points established, it  remains to fix the beginning of Part I, by deciding whether there is an  introductory sentence or not; then the end of Part II, by deciding  whether it leads directly into Part III, or comes to a conclusion  somewhat earlier, to make room for a Retransition; then the end of Part  III, by deciding whether a codetta or coda has been added.  The  extremities of the three Parts being thus determined, there will be no  difficulty in defining the _form_ of each.  Very particular attention  must be devoted to _the comparison of Part III with Part I_, in order  to discover, and accurately define, the difference between them,--in  form, in extent, in melodic formation, or in technical treatment.

A curious example may be found in Schumann, op. 68, No. 32; the form is  actually Two-Part, but with a very brief reminiscence of the beginning  (scarcely to be called a Return) in the _last two measures_,--which  are, strictly speaking, no more than a codetta.  The Second Part is  repeated.    In Schumann's op. 68,"]]]
