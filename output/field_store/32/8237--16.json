More than a century after Evelyn's death, during the time of our wars  with France, the demand for timber and the serious outlook with regard  to future supplies once more drew marked attention to the propagation of  timber throughout Britain, and many plantations of oak were then made  which have not yet been entirely cleared to make way for other and now  more profitable crops of wood. A very decided impetus was given in this  direction by the re-publication of the text of the fourth edition of  _Sylva_ (as finally revised by the author in 1678), with copious notes  by Dr. A. Hunter F.R.S. in 1812. A most appreciative and favourable  review of this work is contained in the _Quarterly Review_ for March  1813 (Vol. ix), which was of much assistance in drawing the attention of  our great landowners to the advantages of growing timber. Plantations  could then be made at about one-fourth to one-third (and often less than  that) of what it now costs to make them, while the market for timber and  wood of all sorts was then favourable, with a steady demand likely to  increase as time rolled on and the national commerce and industries  expanded,--because in those days the economic revolution, accomplished  through the subsequent discoveries of the great uses to which steam and  iron are now put, were not then dreamed of.    This _Quarterly Review_ article was an appreciation of Evelyn,--and not  the only one made by that celebrated periodical, as we shall see  presently. It traced the history of the work, showing how Charles II.  'was too sensible a man to think of compelling his subjects to plant, by  fines and forfeitures for the omission. Example he knew would do  something, and he had scope enough for the purpose in his own wasted  forests; but an animated exhortation from the press, in an age when the  nobility and gentry began to read and to reflect, he knew would do more.  A proper person for the purpose therefore was sought and found; a man of  family, fortune, and learning; an experienced planter; a virtuoso, and  not a little of an enthusiast in his own walk. Such was Mr. Evelyn: and  to this occasion we are indebted for the _Sylva_, which has therefore a  title to be regarded as a national work... It sounded the trumpet of  alarm to the nation on the condition of their woods and forests.'    The re-publication of the _Sylva_ by Dr. Hunter, coming at an  appropriate moment, revived the ardour which the work had excited about  60 years previously, and 'while forests were laid prostrate to protect  our shores from the insults of the enemy, the nobility and gentry began  once more to sow the seeds of future navies.'    Previous to 1812, planting on any large scale whether for profit or  ornament seems to have been confined chiefly to great estates, and 'if a  private gentleman, in the century preceding, planted an hedgrow of an  hundred oaks, it was recorded, for the benefit of posterity, in his  diary.' The trade in the supply of plants had previously been in the  hands of a few nurserymen, but on the appearance of Dr. Hunter's new  edition many private nurseries were established. This was more  especially the case in Scotland, where the Scottish nobility took the  lead 'in this national and patriotic work,'--which promised to be very  profitable, owing to the recent introduction of the larch. The  well-deserved eulogy given in the _Quarterly Review_ article to the  rapid growth of fine timber of this valuable forest tree was the direct  cause of larch plantations being largely extended, because it was said  that 'a tree which, if the oak should fail, would build navies, and if  the forests of Livonia or Norway or Canada were exhausted, would build  cities, is an acquisition to this island almost without a parallel.' And  it still is one of the most valuable of our woodland trees, despite the  cankerous fungus-disease which has certainly been (indirectly) due in no  small degree to injudicious planting in pure woods on unsuitable soils  and situations.    This _Quarterly Review_ article of 1813 probably did quite as much to  stimulate planting throughout Great Britain as the _Sylva_ itself had  previously done; but as Evelyn's classic formed the text for the  exhortation, the beneficial effects must of course in great part be  ascribed to his influence.    A few years later, the _Quarterly Review_ in an article on Evelyn's  _Memoirs_ (April, 1818), again sings the well-deserved praise of his  influence on British Arboriculture. 'The greater part of the woods,  which were raised in consequence of Evelyn's writings, have been cut  down: the oaks have borne the British flag to seas and countries which  were undiscovered when they were planted, and generation after  generation has been coffined in the elms. The trees of his age, which  may yet be standing, are verging fast toward their decay and  dissolution: but his name is fresh in the land, and his reputation, like  the trees of an Indian Paradise, exists and will continue to exist in  full strength and beauty, uninjured by the course of time.        Thrones fall and Dynasties are changed:      Empires decay and sink      Beneath their own unwieldy weight;      Dominion passeth like a cloud away.      The imperishable mind      Survives all meaner things.    No change of fashion, no alteration of taste, no revolutions of science  have impaired or can impair his celebrity.'    Another of the celebrated _Quarterly Review_ articles on Forestry is that  _On Planting Waste Lands_ (October, 1827); and even though it was Robert  Monteath's _Foresters Guide and Profitable Planter_ which furnished the  peg for a discourse on this occasion, still the spirit breathing  throughout the exhortion was the revivification of Evelyn's influence. And  the same must also be said about the article on _Loudon's 'Trees and  Shrubs'_ (_Quarterly Review_; October, 1838), which opens with a eulogy of  our great English enthusiast of Arboriculture. 'The good and peaceful John  Evelyn was a great benefactor to England. He was a country gentleman of  independent fortune; he held an office under Government; and was  personally familiar with Charles II. and James II; yet, in spite of the  influence which he then possessed, his example effected little for his  favourite object till the publication of the _Sylva_. Half the charm of  this work lies in his contriving to make us feel interested about his  trees; he gossips about them, he tells us where they came from and what  they are used for, and has a few marvels--not of his own--but told with  such perfect good faith that we can hardly help believing them with him.  This was the secret by which he managed to attract the attention of even  the wits and gallants of 'the gay court;' and thus it was that he gave an  impulse to planting those 'goodly woods and forests,' the absence of  which, in his own time, he so feelingly laments, and which now crown our  hills and enrich our valleys. Mr. Loudon has followed Evelyn's track.  Tradition--history--poetry--anecdote enliven his pages; the reader soon  feels as if his instructor were a good natured and entertaining friend. He  has also not contented himself with merely recalling old favourites to our  memory, but has introduced to us numerous agreeable foreigners whose  acquaintance we ought to rejoice to make, since by their aid we may hope,  in the course of another half century, to see our woods and plantations  presenting the richness and variety of the American autumns, the trees  which produce those 'lovely tints of scarlet and of gold,' of which  travellers tell us, are all to be obtained at moderate cost in every  nursery; and that they will thrive perfectly in this country Fonthill and  White Knights bear ample testimony.'    Hardly anything can well be added to the above testimony regarding  Evelyn's influence on Arboriculture throughout the British Isles.  Economic conditions have changed entirely since his time, but the spirit  living and breathing in _Sylva_ is still that which is found  influencing many of our great landowners. And it is an influence which  cannot be indicated in any mere enumeration of the number of trees  planted or of acres enclosed as woodlands either for purposes of profit  or of ornament.    Far more is, of course, now known with regard to the physiology and the  natural requirements of our forest trees--e.g. with reference to soil  and situation, demand for light and capacity of enduring shade,  etc.,--than was known in Evelyn's time. Many of his arguments could  easily be shown to be wrong, and many of his recommendations could  equally easily be proved to be inefficacious and inexpedient, just as  old works on Agriculture can no longer be accepted as trustworthy  text-books for the teaching of modern farming; because Vegetable  Physiology forms the true and scientific basis of both the arts relating  to the cultivation of the soil, Agriculture and Forestry; and Vegetable  Physiology is a branch of botanical science which is only of  comparatively recent growth.    Many works on Sylviculture or Forestry, on business principles, have  appeared in England and Scotland within the last fifteen years, but this  new edition of _Sylva_ makes no pretence to belong to such an up-to-date  class of works. It is merely a reprint of the last edition that was  revised by Evelyn himself; and no notes of any description have been  added, such as those to be found in the several editions published by  Dr. Hunter. The present reprint is intended for those who love our  forests and woodlands and the old trees surviving in parks and chases as  links with the distant past; and it will also, for its own sake, appeal  no less strongly to those who love to peruse a classic work, written in  the very highly polished and ornate style affected by writers of  distinction in the seventeenth century.

It belonged to Demophoon.  It has a fine head, small jaw, and strong forelegs. It carries its neck  high and proud, like a cock.\"    But young Chereas shook his head.    \"It is not such a good horse as you say, Aristobulus. Its hoofs are  thin, and the pasterns are too low; the animal will soon go lame.\"    They were continuing their dispute, when Drosea uttered a piercing  shriek.    \"Oh! I nearly swallowed a fish-bone, as long and much sharper than a  style. Luckily, I was able to get it out of my throat in time! The gods  love me!\"    \"Did you say, Drosea, that the gods loved you?\" asked Nicias, smiling.  \"Then they must share the same infirmities as men. Love presupposes  unhappiness on the part of whoever suffers from it, and is a proof of  weakness. The affection they feel for Drosea is a great proof of the  imperfection of the gods.\"    At these words Drosea flew into a great rage.    \"Nicias, your remarks are foolish and not to the point. But that is your  character--you never understand what is said, and reply in words devoid  of sense.\"    Nicias smiled again.    \"Talk away, talk away, Drosea. Whatever you say, we are glad every time  you open your mouth. Your teeth are so pretty!\"    At that moment, a grave-looking old man, negligently dressed, walking  slowly, with his head high, entered the room, and gazed at the guests  quietly. Cotta made a sign to him to take a place by his side, on the  same couch.    \"Eucrites,\" he said, \"you are welcome. Have you composed a new treatise  on philosophy this month? That would make, if I calculate correctly, the  ninety-second that has proceeded from the Nile reed you direct with an  Attic hand.\"    Eucrites replied, stroking his silver beard--    \"The nightingale was created to sing, and I was created to praise the  immortal gods.\"    DORION. Let us respectfully salute, in Eucrites, the last of the stoics.  Grave and white, he stands in the midst of us like the image of an  ancestor. He is solitary amidst a crowd of men, and the words he utters  are not heard.    EUCRITES. You deceive yourself, Dorion. The philosophy of virtue is not  dead. I have numerous disciples in Alexandria, Rome, and Constantinople.  Many of the slaves, and some of the nephews of Caesar, now know how to  govern themselves, to live independently, and being unconcerned with all  affairs, they enjoy boundless happiness. Many of them have revived, in  their own person, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius. But if it were true  that virtue were for ever extinguished upon the earth, in what way  would the loss of it affect my happiness, since it did not depend on  me whether it existed or perished? Only fools, Dorion, place their  happiness out of their own power. I desire nothing that the gods do not  wish, and I desire all that they do wish. By that means I render myself  like unto them, and share their infallible content. If virtue perishes,  I consent that it should perish, and that consent fills me with joy, as  the supreme effort of my reason or my courage. In all things my wisdom  will copy the divine wisdom, and the copy will be more valuable than the  model; it will have cost greater care and more work.    NICIAS. I understand. You put yourself on the same level as divine  providence. But if virtue consists only in effort, Eucrites, and in that  intense application by which the disciples of Zeno pretend to render  themselves equal to the gods, the frog, which swelled itself out to try  and become as big as the ox, accomplished a masterpiece of stoicism.    EUCRITES. You jest, Nicias, and, as usual, you excel in ridicule. But  if the ox of which you speak is really a god, like Apis, or like that  subterranean ox whose high priest I see here, and if the frog, being  wisely inspired, succeed in equalling it, would it not be, in fact,  more virtuous than the ox, and could you refrain from admiring such a  courageous little animal!    Four servants placed on the table a wild pig, still covered with its  bristles. Little pigs, made of pastry, surrounded the animal, as though  they would suckle, to show that it was a sow.    Zenothemis, turning towards the monk, said--    \"Friends, a guest has come hither to join us. The illustrious  Paphnutius, who leads such an extraordinary life of solitude, is our  unexpected guest.\"    COTTA. You may even add, Zenothemis, that the place of honour is due to  him, because he came without being invited.    ZENOTHEMIS. Therefore, we ought, my dear Lucius, to make him the more  welcome, and strive to do that which would be most agreeable to him. Now  it is certain that such a man cares less for the perfumes of meat than  for the perfumes of fine thoughts. We shall, doubtless, please him by  discussing the doctrine he professes, which is that of Jesus crucified.  For my own part, I shall the more willingly discuss this doctrine,  because it keenly interests me, on account of the number and the  diversity of the allegories it contains. If one may guess at the  spirit by the letter, it is filled with truths, and I consider that  the Christian books abound in divine revelations. But I should not,  Paphnutius, grant equal merit to the Jewish books. They were inspired  not, as it was said, by the Spirit of God, but by an evil genius. Iaveh,  who dictated them, was one of those spirits who people the lower air,  and cause the greater part of the evils, from which we suffer; but he  surpassed all the others in ignorance and ferocity. On the contrary, the  serpent with golden wings, which twined its azure coils round the tree  of knowledge, was made up of light and love. A combat between these  two powers--the one of light and the other of darkness--was, therefore,  inevitable. It occurred soon after the creation of the world. God had  hardly begun to rest after His labors; Adam and Eve, the first man and  the first woman, lived happy and naked in the Garden of Eden, when Iaveh  conceived--to their misfortune--the design of governing them and all  the generations which Eve already bore in her splendid loins. As he  possessed neither the compass nor the lyre, and was equally ignorant of  the science which commands and the art which persuades, he frightened  these two poor children by hideous apparitions, capricious threats,  and thunder-bolts. Adam and Eve, feeling his shadow upon them, pressed  closer to one another, and their love waxed stronger in fear. The  serpent took pity on them, and determined to instruct them, in order  that, possessing knowledge, they might no longer be misled by lies. Such  an undertaking required extreme prudence, and the frailty of the first  human couple rendered it almost hopeless. The well-intentioned demon  essayed it, however. Without the knowledge of Iaveh--who pretended  to see everything, but, in reality, was not very sharp-sighted--he  approached these two beings, and charmed their eyes by the splendour of  his coat and the brilliancy of his wings. Then he interested their minds  by forming before them, with his body, definite figures, such as the  circle, the ellipse, and the spiral, the wonderful properties of which  have since been recognised by the Greeks. Adam meditated on these  figures more than Eve did. But when the serpent began to speak, and  taught the most sublime truths--those which cannot be demonstrated--he  found that Adam being made of red earth, was of too dull a nature to  understand these subtle distinctions, but that Eve, on the contrary,  being more tender and more sensitive, was easily impressed. Therefore  he conversed with her alone, in the absence of her husband, in order to  initiate her first--    DORION. Permit me, Zenothemis, to interrupt you. I speedily recognised  in the myth you have explained to us an episode in the war of Pallas  Athene against the giants. Iaveh much resembles Typhoon, and Pallas is  represented by the Athenians with a serpent at her side. But what you  have said causes me considerable doubt as to the intelligence or good  faith of the serpent of whom you have spoken. If he had really possessed  knowledge, would he have entrusted it to a woman's little head, which  was incapable of containing it? I should rather consider that he was  like Iaveh, ignorant and a liar, and that he chose Eve because she was  easily seduced, and he imagined that Adam would have more intelligence  and perception.    ZENOTHEMIS. Learn, Dorion, that it is not by perception and  intelligence, but by sensibility, that the highest and purest truths are  reached. That is why women, who, generally, are less reflective but more  sensitive than men, rise more easily to the knowledge of things divine.  In them is the gift of prophecy, and it is not without reason that  Apollo Citharedes, and Jesus of Nazareth, are sometimes represented  clad, like women, in flowing robes. The initiator was therefore  wise--whatever you may say to the contrary, Dorion--in bestowing light,  not on the duller Adam, but on Eve, who was whiter than milk or the  stars. She freely listened to him, and allowed herself to be led to the  tree of knowledge, the branches of which rose to heaven, and which was  bathed with the divine spirit as with a dew. This tree was covered with  leaves which spoke all the languages of future races of men, and their  united voices formed a perfect harmony. Its abundant fruit gave to the  initiated who tasted it the knowledge of metals, stones, and plants, and  also of physical and moral laws; but this fruit was like fire, and those  who feared suffering and death did not dare to put it to their lips.  Now, as she had listened attentively to the lessons of the serpent, Eve  despised these empty terrors, and wished to taste the fruit which gave  the knowledge of God. But, as she loved Adam, and did not wish him to be  inferior to her, she took him by the hand and led him to the"]]]
