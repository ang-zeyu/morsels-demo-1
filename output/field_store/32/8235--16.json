[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20750"],[0,"Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society - Vol. 3 (#15)"],[1,"birds are these peculiar circumstances so  strikingly combined. Either their food is more liable to failure, or  they have not sufficient power of wing to search for it over an  extensive area, or during some season of the year it becomes very  scarce, and less wholesome substitutes have to be found; and thus,  though more fertile in offspring, they can never increase beyond the  supply of food in the least favourable seasons. Many birds can only  exist by migrating, when their food becomes scarce, to regions  possessing a milder, or at least a different climate, though, as these  migrating birds are seldom excessively abundant, it is evident that the  countries they visit are still deficient in a constant and abundant  supply of wholesome food. Those whose organization does not permit them  to migrate when their food becomes periodically scarce, can never attain  a large population. This is probably the reason why woodpeckers are  scarce with us, while in the tropics they are among the most abundant of  solitary birds. Thus the house sparrow is more abundant than the  redbreast, because its food is more constant and plentiful,--seeds of  grasses being preserved during the winter, and our farm-yards and  stubble-fields furnishing an almost inexhaustible supply. Why, as a  general rule, are aquatic, and especially sea birds, very numerous in  individuals? Not because they are more prolific than others, generally  the contrary; but because their food never fails, the sea-shores and  river-banks daily swarming with a fresh supply of small mollusca and  crustacea. Exactly the same laws will apply to mammals. Wild cats are  prolific and have few enemies; why then are they never as abundant as  rabbits? The only intelligible answer is, that their supply of food is  more precarious. It appears evident, therefore, that so long as a  country remains physically unchanged, the numbers of its animal  population cannot materially increase. If one species does so, some  others requiring the same kind of food must diminish in proportion. The  numbers that die annually must be immense; and as the individual  existence of each animal depends upon itself, those that die must be the  weakest--the very young, the aged, and the diseased,--while those that  prolong their existence can only be the most perfect in health and  vigour--those who are best able to obtain food regularly, and avoid  their numerous enemies. It is, as we commenced by remarking, \"a struggle  for existence,\" in which the weakest and least perfectly organized must  always succumb.    Now it is clear that what takes place among the individuals of a species  must also occur among the several allied species of a group,--viz. that  those which are best adapted to obtain a regular supply of food, and to  defend themselves against the attacks of their enemies and the  vicissitudes of the seasons, must necessarily obtain and preserve a  superiority in population; while those species which from some defect of  power or organization are the least capable of counteracting the  vicissitudes of food, supply, &c., must diminish in numbers, and, in  extreme cases, become altogether extinct. Between these extremes the  species will present various degrees of capacity for ensuring the means  of preserving life; and it is thus we account for the abundance or  rarity of species. Our ignorance will generally prevent us from  accurately tracing the effects to their causes; but could we become  perfectly acquainted with the organization and habits of the various  species of animals, and could we measure the capacity of each for  performing the different acts necessary to its safety and existence  under all the varying circumstances by which it is surrounded, we might  be able even to calculate the proportionate abundance of individuals  which is the necessary result.    If now we have succeeded in establishing these two points--1st, _that  the animal population of a country is generally stationary, being kept  down by a periodical deficiency of food, and other checks_; and, 2nd,  _that the comparative abundance or scarcity of the individuals of the  several species is entirely due to their organization and resulting  habits, which, rendering it more difficult to procure a regular supply  of food and to provide for their personal safety in some cases than in  others, can only be balanced by a difference in the population which  have to exist in a given area_--we shall be in a condition to proceed to  the consideration of _varieties_, to which the preceding remarks have a  direct and very important application.    Most or perhaps all the variations from the typical form of a species  must have some definite effect, however slight, on the habits or  capacities of the individuals. Even a change of colour might, by  rendering them more or less distinguishable, affect their safety; a  greater or less development of hair might modify their habits. More  important changes, such as an increase in the power or dimensions of the  limbs or any of the external organs, would more or less affect their  mode of procuring food or the range of country which they inhabit. It  is also evident that most changes would affect, either favourably or  adversely, the powers of prolonging existence. An antelope with shorter  or weaker legs must necessarily suffer more from the attacks of the  feline carnivora; the passenger pigeon with less powerful wings would  sooner or later be affected in its powers of procuring a regular supply  of food; and in both cases the result must necessarily be a diminution  of the population of the modified species. If, on the other hand, any  species should produce a variety having slightly increased powers of  preserving existence, that variety must inevitably in time acquire a  superiority in numbers. These results must follow as surely as old age,  intemperance, or scarcity of food produce an increased mortality. In  both cases there may be many individual exceptions; but on the average  the rule will invariably be found to hold good. All varieties will  therefore fall into two classes--those which under the same conditions  would never reach the population of the parent species, and those which  would in time obtain and keep a numerical superiority. Now, let some  alteration of physical conditions occur in the district--a long period  of drought, a destruction of vegetation by locusts, the irruption of  some new carnivorous animal seeking \"pastures new\"--any change in fact  tending to render existence more difficult to the species in question,  and tasking its utmost powers to avoid complete extermination; it is  evident that, of all the individuals composing the species, those  forming the least numerous and most feebly organized variety would  suffer first, and, were the pressure severe, must soon become extinct.  The same causes continuing in action, the parent species would next  suffer, would gradually diminish in numbers, and with a recurrence of  similar unfavourable conditions might also become extinct. The superior  variety would then alone remain, and on a return to favourable  circumstances would rapidly increase in numbers and occupy the place of  the extinct species and variety.    The _variety_ would now have replaced the _species_, of which it would  be a more perfectly developed and more highly organized form. It would  be in all respects better adapted to secure its safety, and to prolong  its individual existence and that of the race. Such a variety _could  not_ return to the original form; for that form is an inferior one, and  could never compete with it for existence. Granted, therefore, a  \"tendency\" to reproduce the original type of the species, still the  variety must ever remain preponderant in numbers, and under adverse  physical conditions _again alone survive_. But this new, improved, and  populous race might itself, in course of time, give rise to new  varieties, exhibiting several diverging modifications of form, any of  which, tending to increase the facilities for preserving existence,  must, by the same general law, in their turn become predominant. Here,  then, we have _progression and continued divergence_ deduced from the  general laws which regulate the existence of animals in a state of  nature, and from the undisputed fact that varieties do frequently occur.  It is not, however, contended that this result would be invariable; a  change of physical conditions in the district might at times materially  modify it, rendering the race which had been the most capable of  supporting existence under the former conditions now the least so, and  even causing the extinction of the newer and, for a time, superior race,  while the old or parent species and its first inferior varieties  continued to flourish. Variations in unimportant parts might also occur,  having no perceptible effect on the life-preserving powers; and the  varieties so furnished might run a course parallel with the parent  species, either giving rise to further variations or returning to the  former type. All we argue for is, that certain varieties have a tendency  to maintain their existence longer than the original species, and this  tendency must make itself felt; for though the doctrine of chances or  averages can never be trusted to on a limited scale, yet, if applied to  high numbers, the results come nearer to what theory demands, and, as we  approach to an infinity of examples, become strictly accurate. Now the  scale on which nature works is so vast--the numbers of individuals and  periods of time with which she deals approach so near to infinity, that  any cause, however slight, and however liable to be veiled and  counteracted by accidental circumstances, must in the end produce its  full legitimate results.    Let us now turn to domesticated animals, and inquire how varieties  produced among them are affected by the principles here enunciated. The  essential"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20763"],[0,"Carpentry for Boys (#15)"],[1,"ut, as at B, gives a starting point for the next cut  or placement of the chisel. When the second cut (B) has thus been made,  the chisel should be turned around, as in dotted line _d_, position C,  thereby making a finish cut down to the bottom of the mortise, line _e_,  so that when the fourth cut has been made along line _f_, we are ready  for the fifth cut, position C; then the sixth cut, position D, which  leaves the mortise as shown at E. Then turn the chisel to the position  shown at F, and cut down the last end of the mortise square, as shown in  G, and clean out the mortise well before making the finishing cuts on  the marking lines (_a_, _b_). The particular reason for cleaning out the  mortise before making the finish cuts is, that the corners of the  mortise are used as fulcrums for the chisels, and the eighth of an inch  stock still remaining protects the corners.    THINGS TO AVOID IN MORTISING.--You must be careful to refrain from  undercutting as your chisel goes down at the lines _a_, _b_, because if  you commit this error you will make a bad joint.    As much care should be exercised in producing the tenon, although the  most common error is apt to occur in making the shoulder. This should be  a trifle undercut.    [Illustration: _Fig. 209._]    See the lines (A, Fig. 209), which illustrate this.    LAP-AND-BUTT JOINT.--The lap-and-butt is the form of uniting members  which is most generally used to splice together timbers, where they join  each other end to end.    [Illustration: _Fig. 210._]    Bolts are used to secure the laps.    But the lap-and-butt form is also used in doors and in other cabinet  work. It is of great service in paneling.    A rabbet is formed to receive the edge of the panel, and a molding is  then secured to the other side on the panel, to hold the latter in  place.    SCARFING.--This method of securing members together is the most rigid,  and when properly performed makes the joint the strongest part of the  timber. Each member (A, Fig. 212) has a step diagonally cut (B), the two  steps being on different planes, so they form a hook joint, as at C, and  as each point or terminal has a blunt end, the members are so  constructed as to withstand a longitudinal strain in either direction.  The overlapping plates (D) and the bolts (E) hold the joint rigidly.    [Illustration: _Fig. 211._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 212._]    THE TONGUE AND GROOVE.--This form of uniting members has only a limited  application. It is serviceable for floors, table tops, paneling, etc.  In Fig. 213, a door panel is shown, and the door mullions (B) are also  so secured to the rail (C). The tongue-and-groove method is never used  by itself. It must always have some support or reinforcing means.    [Illustration: _Fig. 213._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 214._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 215._]    BEADING.--This part of the work pertains to surface finishings, and may  or may not be used in connection with rabbeting.    Figs. 214 and 215 show the simplest and most generally adopted forms in  which it is made and used in connection with rabbeting, or with the  tongue and groove. The bead is placed on one or both sides of that  margin of the board (Fig. 214) which has the tongue, and the adjoining  board has the usual flooring groove to butt against and receive the  tongue. It is frequently the case that a blind bead, as in Fig. 215,  runs through the middle of the board, so as to give the appearance of  narrow strips when used for wainscoting, or for ceilings. The beads also  serve to hide the joints of the boards.    [Illustration: _Fig. 216._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 217._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 218._]    ORNAMENTAL BEAD FINISH.--These figures show how the bead may be used for  finishing corners, edges and projections. Fig. 216 has a bead at each  corner of a stile (A), and a finishing strip of half-round material (B)  is nailed to the flat edge. Fig. 217 has simply the corners themselves  beaded, and it makes a most serviceable finish for the edges of  projecting members.    Fig. 218, used for wider members, has the corners beaded and a fancy  molding (C); or the reduced edge of the stile itself is rounded off.    [Illustration: _Fig. 219._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 220._]    THE BEAD AND RABBET.--A more amplified form of work is available where  the rabbet plane is used with the beader. These two planes together  will, if properly used, offer a strong substitute for molding and  molding effects.    Fig. 219 has both sides first rabbeted, as at A, and the corners then  beaded, as at B, with the reduced part of the member rounded off, as at  C. Or, as in Fig. 220, the reduced edge of the member may have the  corners beaded, as at D, and the rabbeted corners filled in with a round  or concaved moulding (E).    SHADING WITH BEADS AND RABBETS.--You will see from the foregoing, that  these embellishments are serviceable because they provide the article  with a large number of angles and surfaces to cast lights and shadows;  and for this reason the boy should strive to produce the effects which  this class of work requires.          CHAPTER XI    HOUSE BUILDING      House building is the carpenter's craft; cabinet-making the joiner's  trade, yet both are so intimately associated, that it is difficult to  draw a line. The same tools, the same methods and the same materials are  employed.    There is no trade more ennobling than home building. It is a vocation  which touches every man and woman, and to make it really an art is, or  should be, the true aspiration of every craftsman.    THE HOUSE AND EMBELLISHMENTS.--The refined arts, such as sculpture and  painting, merely embellish the home or the castle, so that when we build  the structure it should be made with an eye not only to comfort and  convenience, but fitting in an artistic and aesthetic sense. It is just  as easy to build a beautiful home as an ugly, ungainly, illy  proportioned structure.    BEAUTY NOT ORNAMENTATION.--The boy, in his early training, should learn  this fundamental truth, that beauty, architecturally, does not depend  upon ornamentation. Some of the most beautiful structures in the world  are very plain. Beauty consists in proportions, in proper correlation  of parts, and in adaptation for the uses to which the structure is to be  put.    PLAIN STRUCTURES.--A house with a plain facade, having a roof properly  pitched and with a simple cornice, if joined to a wing which is not  ungainly or out of proper proportions, is infinitely more beautiful than  a rambling structure, in which one part suggests one order of  architecture and the other part some other type or no type at all, and  in which the embellishments are out of keeping with the size or  pretensions of the house.    COLONIAL TYPE.--For real beauty, on a larger scale, there is nothing  to-day which equals the old Colonial type with the Corinthian columns  and entablature. The Lee mansion, now the National Cemetery, at  Washington, is a fine example. Such houses are usually square or  rectangular in plan, severely plain, with the whole ornamentation  consisting of the columns and the portico. This type presents an  appearance of massiveness and grandeur and is an excellent illustration  of a form wherein the main characteristic of the structure is  concentrated or massed at one point.    The Church of the Madelaine, Paris, is another striking example of this  period of architecture.    Of course, it would be out of place with cottages and small houses, but  it is well to study and to know what forms are most available and  desirable to adopt, and particularly to know something of the art in  which you are interested.    THE ROOF THE KEYNOTE.--Now, there is one thing which should, and does,  distinguish the residence from other types of buildings, excepting  churches. It is the roof. A house is dominated by its covering. I refer  to the modern home. It is not true with the Colonial or the Grecian  types. In those the facade or the columns and cornices predominate over  everything else.    BUNGALOW TYPES.--If you will take up any book on bungalow work and note  the outlines of the views you will see that the roof forms the main  element or theme. In fact, in most buildings of this kind everything is  submerged but the roof and roof details. They are made exceedingly flat,  with different pitches with dormers and gables intermingled and  indiscriminately placed, with cornices illy assorted and of different  kinds, so that the multiplicity of diversified details gives an  appearance of great elaboration. Many of those designs are monstrosities  and should, if possible, be legally prohibited.    I cannot attempt to give even so much as an outline of what constitutes  art in its relation to building, but my object is to call attention to  this phase of the question, and as you proceed in your studies and your  work you will realize the value and truthfulness of the foregoing  observations.    GENERAL HOUSE BUILDING.--We are to treat, generally, on the subject of  house building, how the work is laid out, and how built, and in doing so  I shall take a concrete example of the work. This can be made more  effectual for the purpose if it is on simple lines.    BUILDING PLANS.--We must first have a plan; and the real carpenter must  have the ability to plan as well as to do the work. We want a five-room  house, comprising a parlor, dining room, two bedrooms, a kitchen and a  bathroom. Just a modest little home, to which we can devote our spare  hours, and which will be neat and comfortable when finished. It must be  a one-story house, and that fact at once settles the roof question. We  can make the house perfectly square in plan, or rectangular, and divide  up the space into the proper divisions.    THE PLAIN SQUARE FLOOR PLAN will first be taken up, as it is such an  easy roof to build. Of course, it is severely plain.    Fig. 221 shows our proposed plan, drawn in the rough, without"]]]
