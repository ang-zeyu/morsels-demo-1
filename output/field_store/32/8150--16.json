(#15)"],[1,"of Glocester, procured Edward  an army which Leicester was utterly unable to withstand. This nobleman  found himself in a remote quarter of the kingdom; surrounded by his  enemies; barred from all communication with his friends by the Severn,  whose bridges Edward had broken down; and obliged to fight the cause  of his party under these multiplied disadvantages. In this extremity he  wrote to his son, Simon de Mountfort, to hasten from London with an army  for his relief; and Simon had advanced to Kenilworth with that view,  where, fancying that all Edward's force and attention were directed  against his father, he lay secure and unguarded. But the prince, making  a sudden and forced march, surprised him in his camp, dispersed his  army, and took the earl of Oxford and many other noblemen prisoners,  almost without resistance. Leicester, ignorant of his son's fate, passed  the Severn in boats during Edward's absence, and lay at Evesham, in  expectation of being every hour joined by his friends from London; when  the prince, who availed himself of every favorable moment, appeared in  the field before him. Edward made a body of his troops advance from  the road which led to Kenilworth, and ordered them to carry the banners  taken from Simon's army; while he himself, making a circuit with the  rest of his forces, purposed to attack the enemy on the other quarter.  Leicester was long deceived by this stratagem, and took one division of  Edward's army for his friends; but at last, perceiving his mistake,  and observing the great superiority and excellent disposition of the  royalists, he exclaimed, that they had learned from him the art of war;  adding, \"The Lord have mercy on our souls, for I see our bodies are the  prince's!\" The battle immediately began, though on very unequal terms.  Leicester's army, by living in the mountains of Wales without bread,  which was not then much used among the inhabitants, had been extremely  weakened by sickness and desertion, and was soon broken by the  victorious royalists; while his Welsh allies, accustomed only to a  desultory kind of war, immediately took to flight, and were pursued with  great slaughter. Leicester himself, asking for quarter, was slain in the  heat of the action, with his eldest son Henry, Hugh le Despenser, and  about one hundred and sixty knights, and many other gentlemen of his  party. The old king had been purposely placed by the rebels in the front  of the battle, and being clad in armor, and thereby not known by his  friends, he received a wound, and was in danger of his life; but crying  out, \"I am Henry of Winchester, your king,\" he was saved, and put in a  place of safety by his son, who flew to his rescue.    The violence, ingratitude, tyranny, rapacity, and treachery of the earl  of Leicester, give a very bad idea of his moral character, and make us  regard his death as the most fortunate event which, in this conjuncture,  could have happened to the English nation: yet must we allow the man  to have possessed great abilities, and the appearance of great virtues,  who, though a stranger, could, at a time when strangers were the most  odious and the most universally decried, have acquired so extensive an  interest in the kingdom, and have so nearly paved his way to the throne  itself. His military capacity, and his political craft, were equally  eminent: he possessed the talents both of governing men and conducting  business; and though his ambition was boundless, it seems neither to  have exceeded his courage nor his genius; and he had the happiness  of making the low populace, as well as the haughty barons, cooeperate  towards the success of his selfish and dangerous purposes. A prince of  greater abilities and vigor than Henry might have directed the talents  of this nobleman either to the exaltation of his throne or to the good  of his people but the advantages given to Leicester, by the weak and  variable administration of the king, brought on the ruin of royal  authority, and produced great confusions in the kingdom which, however,  in the end, preserved and extremely improved national liberty and the  constitution. His popularity, even after his death, continued so great,  that, though he was excommunicated by Rome, the people believed him to  be a saint; and many miracles were said to be wrought upon his tomb.[*]    {1266.} The victory of Evesham, with the death of Leicester, proved  decisive in favor of the royalists, and made an equal though an opposite  impression on friends and enemies, in every part of England. The king of  the Romans recovered his liberty: the other prisoners of the royal party  were not only freed, but courted by their keepers; Fitz-Richard, the  seditious mayor of London, who had marked out forty of the most wealthy  citizens for slaughter, immediately stopped his hand on receiving  intelligence of this great event; and almost all the castles, garrisoned  by the barons, hastened to make their submissions, and to open their  gates to the king. The Isle of Axholme alone, and that of Ely, trusting  to the strength of their situation, ventured to make resistance; but  were at last reduced, as well as the Castle of Dover, by the valor and  activity of Prince Edward.[**] Adam de Gourdon, a courageous baron,  maintained himself during some time in the forests of Hampshire,  committed depredations in the neighborhood, and obliged the prince to  lead a body of troops into that country against him. Edward attacked the  camp of the rebels; and being transported by the ardor of battle, leaped  over the trench with a few followers, and encountered Gourdon in single  combat. The victory was long disputed between these valiant combatants;  but ended at last in the prince's favor, who wounded his antagonist,  threw him from his horse, and took him prisoner. He not only gave him  his life; but introduced him that very night to the queen at Guildford,  procured him his pardon, restored him to his estate, received him into  favor, and was ever after faithfully served by him.[***]         * Chron. de Mailr. p. 232.         ** M. Paris p. 676. W. Heming. p. 588.         *** M. Paris, p 575    A total victory of the sovereign over so extensive a rebellion commonly  produces a revolution of government, and strengthens, as well as  enlarges, for some time, the prerogatives of the crown; yet no  sacrifices of national liberty were made on this occasion; the Great  Charter remained still inviolate; and the king, sensible that his own  barons, by whose assistance alone he had prevailed, were no less jealous  of their independence than the other party, seems thenceforth to have  more carefully abstained from all those exertions of power which had  afforded so plausible a pretence to the rebels. The clemency of this  victory is also remarkable; no blood was shed on the scaffold; no  attainders, except of the Mountfort family, were carried into execution;  and though a parliament, assembled at Winchester, attainted all those  who had borne arms against the king, easy compositions were made  with them for their lands;[*] and the highest sum levied on the most  obnoxious offenders exceeded not five years' rent of their estate. Even  the earl of Derby, who again rebelled, after having been pardoned and  restored to his fortune, was obliged to pay only seven years' rent, and  was a second time restored. The mild disposition of the king, and the  prudence of the prince, tempered the insolence of victory and gradually  restored order to the several members of the state, disjointed by so  long a continuance of civil wars and commotions.    The city of London, which had carried farthest the rage and animosity  against the king, and which seemed determined to stand upon its defence  after almost all the kingdom had submitted, was, after some interval,  restored to most of its liberties and privileges; and Fitz-Richard,  the mayor, who had been guilty of so much illegal violence, was only  punished by fine and imprisonment. The countess of Leicester, the king's  sister, who had been extremely forward in all attacks on the royal  family, was dismissed the kingdom with her two sons, Simon and Guy,  who proved very ungrateful for this lenity. Five years afterwards, they  assassinated, at Viterbo in Italy, their cousin Henry d'Allmaine, who at  that very time was endeavoring to make their peace with the king; and  by taking sanctuary in the church of the Franciscans, they escaped the  punishment due to so great an enormity.[**]         * M. Paris, p. 675.         ** Rymer, vol. i. p. 879; vol. ii. p. 4, 6. Chron. T. Wykes,       p. 94 W. Heming. p. 589. Trivet, p. 240.    {1267.} The merits of the earl of Glocester, after he returned to his  allegiance, had been so great, in restoring the prince to his liberty,  and assisting him in his victories against the rebellious barons, that  it was almost impossible to content him in his demands; and his youth  and temerity as well as his great power, tempted him, on some new  disgust, to raise again the flames of rebellion in the kingdom. The  mutinous populace of London at his instigation took to arms; and the  prince was obliged to levy an army of thirty thousand men in order to  suppress them. Even this second rebellion did not provoke the king to  any act of cruelty; and the earl of Glocester himself escaped with total  impunity. He was only obliged to enter into a bond of twenty thousand  marks, that he should never again be guilty of rebellion; a strange  method of enforcing the laws, and a proof of the dangerous independence  of the barons in those ages! These potent nobles were, from the danger  of the precedent, averse to the execution of the laws of forfeiture and  felony against any of their fellows; though they could not, with a  good grace, refuse to concur in obliging them to fulfil any voluntary  contract and engagement into which they had entered.    {1270.} The prince, finding the state of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19213"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part C. (#15)"],[1,"to conduct the whole enterprise.  The conspiracy escaped not the king's vigilance: it was even very  generally believed, that the scheme had been laid by himself, in order  to draw Warwick and Perkin into the snare; but the subsequent execution  of two of Digby's servants for the contrivance seems to clear the king  of that imputation, which was indeed founded more on the general idea  entertained of his character than on any positive evidence.    Perkin, by this new attempt, after so many enormities, had rendered  himself totally unworthy of mercy; and he was accordingly arraigned,  condemned, and soon after hanged at Tyburn, persisting still in the  confession of his imposture.[*] [1] It happened about that very time  that one Wilford, a cordwainer's son, encouraged by the surprising  credit given to other impostures, had undertaken to personate the earl  of Warwick; and a priest had even ventured from the pulpit to recommend  his cause to the people, who seemed still to retain a propensity to  adopt it. This incident served Henry as a pretence for his severity  towards that prince. He was brought to trial, and accused, not of  contriving his escape, (for as he was committed for no crime, the desire  of liberty must have been regarded as natural and innocent,) but of  forming designs to disturb the government, and raise an insurrection  among the people. Warwick confessed the indictment was condemned, and  the sentence was executed upon him.         * See note A, at the end of the volume.    This violent act of tyranny, the great blemish of Henry's reign, by  which he destroyed the last remaining male of the line of Plantagenet,  begat great discontent among the people, who saw an unhappy prince, that  had long been denied all the privileges of his high birth, even been  cut off from the common benefits of nature, now at last deprived of life  itself, merely for attempting to shake off that oppression under which  he labored. In vain did Henry endeavor to alleviate the odium of this  guilt, by sharing it with his ally, Ferdinand of Arragon, who, he said,  had scrupled to give his daughter Catharine in marriage to Arthur while  any male descendant of the house of York remained. Men, on the contrary,  felt higher indignation at seeing a young prince sacrificed, not to  law and justice, but to the jealous politics of two subtle and crafty  tyrants.    But though these discontents festered in the minds of men, they were so  checked by Henry's watchful policy and steady severity, that they seemed  not to weaken his government; and foreign princes, deeming his  throne now entirely secure, paid him rather the greater deference and  attention. The archduke Philip, in particular, desired an interview with  him; and Henry, who had passed over to Calais, agreed to meet him in  St. Peter's church, near that city. The archduke, on his approaching the  king, made haste to alight, and offered to hold Henry's stirrup; a mark  of condescension which that prince would not admit of. He called  the king \"father,\" \"patron,\" \"protector;\" and by his whole behavior  expressed a strong desire of conciliating the friendship of England. The  duke of Orleans had succeeded to the crown of France by the appellation  of Lewis XII.; and having carried his arms into Italy, and subdued the  duchy of Milan, his progress begat jealousy in Maximilian, Philip's  father, as well as in Ferdinand, his father-in-law. By the counsel,  therefore, of these monarchs, the young prince endeavored by every  art to acquire the amity of Henry, whom they regarded as the chief  counterpoise to the greatness of France. No particular plan, however, of  alliance seems to have been concerted between these two princes in their  interview: all passed in general professions of affection and regard;  at least, in remote projects of a closer union, by the future  intermarriages of their children, who were then in a state of infancy.    {1500.} The Pope, too, Alexander VI., neglected not the friendship of a  monarch whose reputation was spread over Europe. He sent a nuncio  into England, who exhorted the king to take part in the great alliance  projected for the recovery of the Holy Land, and to lead in person his  forces against the infidels. The general frenzy for crusades was now  entirely exhausted in Europe; but it was still thought a necessary piece  of decency to pretend zeal for those pious enterprises. Henry regretted  to the nuncio the distance of his situation, which rendered it  inconvenient for him to expose his person in defence of the Christian  cause. He promised, however, his utmost assistance by aids and  contributions; and rather than the pope should go alone to the holy  wars, unaccompanied by any monarch, he even promised to overlook all  other considerations, and to attend him in person. He only required,  as a necessary condition, that all differences should previously be  adjusted among Christian princes, and that some seaport towns in Italy  should be consigned to him for his retreat and security. It was easy to  conclude that Henry had determined not to intermeddle in any war against  the Turk; but as a great name, without any real assistance, is sometimes  of service, the knights of Rhodes, who were at that time esteemed the  bulwark of Christendom, chose the king protector of their order.    But the prince whose alliance Henry valued the most was Ferdinand of  Arragon, whose vigorous and steady policy, always attended with success,  had rendered him in many respects the most considerable monarch in  Europe. There was also a remarkable similarity of character between  these two princes; both were full of craft, intrigue, and design:  and though a resemblance of this nature be a slender foundation for  confidence and amity, where the interests of the parties in the least  interfere, such was the situation of Henry and Ferdinand, that no  jealousy ever on any occasion arose between them. The king had now the  satisfaction of completing a marriage, which had been projected and  negotiated during the course of seven years, between Arthur, prince  of Wales, and the infanta Catharine, fourth daughter of Ferdinand and  Isabella; he near sixteen years of age, she eighteen. But this marriage  proved in the issue unprosperous. The young prince, a few months after,  sickened and died, much regretted by the nation.    {1502.} Henry, desirous to continue his alliance with Spain, and also  unwilling to restore Catharine's dowry, which was two hundred thousand  ducats, obliged his second son, Henry, whom he created prince of Wales,  to be contracted to the infanta. The prince made all the opposition  of which a youth of twelve years of age was capable; but as the king  persisted in his resolution, the espousals were at length, by means of  the pope's dispensation, contracted between the parties; an event which  was afterwards attended with the most important consequences.    The same year another marriage was celebrated, which was also, in the  next age, productive of great events; the marriage of Margaret, the  king's eldest daughter, with James, king of Scotland. This alliance  had been negotiated during three years, though interrupted by several  broils; and Henry hoped, from the completion of it, to remove all source  of discord with that neighboring kingdom, by whose animosity England  had so often been infested. When this marriage was deliberated on in  the English council, some objected, that England might, by means of  that alliance, fall under the dominion of Scotland. \"No,\" replied Henry,  \"Scotland, in that event, will only become an accession to England.\"    {1503.} Amidst these prosperous incidents, the king met with a domestic  calamity, which made not such impression on him as it merited: his queen  died in childbed; and the infant did not long survive her. This princess  was deservedly a favorite of the nation; and the general affection for  her increased, on account of the harsh treatment which it was thought  she met with from her consort.    The situation of the king's affairs, both at home and abroad, was now in  every respect very fortunate. All the efforts of the European princes,  both in war and negotiation, were turned to the side of Italy; and the  various events which there arose, made Henry's alliance be courted by  every party, yet interested him so little as never to touch him with  concern or anxiety. His close connections with-Spain and Scotland  insured his tranquillity; and his continued successes over domestic  enemies, owing to the prudence and vigor of his conduct, had reduced the  people to entire submission and obedience. Uncontrolled, therefore,  by apprehension or opposition of any kind, he gave full scope to his  natural propensity; and avarice, which had ever been his ruling passion  being increased by age and encouraged by absolute authority broke all  restraints of shame or justice. He had found two ministers Empson and  Dudley, perfectly qualified to second his rapacious and tyrannical  inclinations, and to prey upon his defenceless people. These instruments  of oppression were both lawyers; the first of mean birth, of brutal  manners, of an unrelenting temper; the second better born, better  educated, and better bred, but equally unjust, severe, and inflexible.  By their knowledge in law, these men were qualified to pervert the  forms of justice to the oppression of the innocent; and the formidable  authority of the king supported them in all their iniquities.    It was their usual practice, at first, to observe so far the appearance  of law as to give indictments to those whom they intended to oppress;  upon which the persons were committed to prison, but never brought to  trial; and were at length obliged, in order to recover their liberty,  to pay heavy fines and ransoms, which were called mitigations and  compositions. By degrees, the very appearance of law was neglected: the  two ministers sent forth"]]]
