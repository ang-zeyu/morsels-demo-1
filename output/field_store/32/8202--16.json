At  any rate you would have the option, if you found life intolerably  dull here, of joining him out there at any time.    \"But how do you intend to get out, Reuben?\" he asked, seeing that  Mrs. Whitney made no answer, but again relapsed into tears.    \"I shall work my way out,\" Reuben replied. \"I can do any rough work  as a smith or a carpenter, and I should think I ought to get my  passage for my work. Anyhow, I have got twelve pounds saved up; and  if I can't get out free, that and my work ought to take me.\"    In a short time Mrs. Whitney, finding that Reuben was not to be  shaken in his determination, ceased to oppose it; and began to busy  herself in preparations for his departure, which he had arranged to  take place as soon as possible.    A day or two before starting, he walked over to say goodbye to Mrs.  Shrewsbury. He stopped as he passed the smithy and, seeing Jacob  Priestley at work alone, he went in.    \"Ah, Reuben, is it you?\" the smith said. \"Better here than in the  dock at Lewes, eh? I hears a talk of your going to foreign parts.\"    \"Yes, I am off,\" Reuben said, \"and I have just come over to say  goodbye to Mrs. Shrewsbury; so I looked in as I passed, knowing as  you were one of those who found me not guilty, and would perhaps  give me a shake of the hand, before leaving.\"    \"That will I, lad. Yes, I found you not guilty; and I jest tipped  you a wink, from the box, to let you know as it were all right; but  my eye! what a game we had had of it. Never had such a game, in all  my born days.\"    And the blacksmith sat down on a stool, to indulge in a great fit  of laughing.    \"What was the game?\" Reuben asked.    \"Well, you know, Stokes he was the foreman, and a Cockney sort of  chap he be. He turns round in the box and, says he:    \"'In course you are all agreed.'    \"'Agreed as how?' says I.    \"'Why, agreed as he's guilty, in course,' says he.    \"'Nothing of the sort,' says I. 'I believes he's as innocent as a  child unborn.'    \"Then they all comes round me and jaws; but seeing as I wasn't  going to give in, Stokes he asked the judge for leave to retire.    \"Well, when we retires they all pitches into me, and says as it's  monstrous one man should hold out agin eleven; and that, even if I  didn't feel sure myself, I ought to go as the others went. So I  didn't say much, but I sits myself down and brings out a big chunk  of bread and bacon, as my good woman had put into my pocket, and I  begins to eat.    \"'Look you here,' says I, 'I ha' got four parcels like this. Today  be Friday, and I can hold on easy till Tuesday. That's how I looks  at it. This young chap ain't had nothing to do with this 'ere  robbery, and I ain't going to see he transported for what he never  done.'    \"Well, there we sits. Sometimes they would all talk at once,  sometimes two or three of them would give it me. Ten o'clock comes  and they got desperate like, for only one or two of them had put  anything into their pockets, thinking that the matter was sure to  be finished that night. When the messages were sent out again, as  we couldn't agree, I sits down in a corner and, says I:    \"'I ain't a selfish man, and any of you as changes your mind can  have a share of what I have got.'    \"I dozes off, but I hears them jawing away among themselves. It  might have been two o'clock when one of them comes to me and gives  me a shake and, says he:    \"'Give us a cut of that bread and bacon. I am well-nigh starved. I  have got a wife and children to think of, and it don't matter to me  whether this chap goes to Botany Bay, or whether he don't. It  didn't seem to me a certain case, all along, so I will go along  with you.'    \"Gradually two or three more comes, and when it got light I could  see as some more was hesitating so, says I:    \"'Lookee here, my friends. Those who has agreed to give this young  chap another chance has lessened my stock of bread and bacon pretty  considerable, and I ain't got more than enough for one more, so  who's the next?'    \"Four more spoke out at once. I divides the bread and bacon among  them; then, as there was nine of us agin three, we goes at them and  tells them how wrong it is as we was all to suffer from their  obstinacy, and we works on their feelings about their wives and  children; and then, says I:    \"'I call it downright ridiculous, when there's a hot breakfast on  twelve tables waiting for us, as three men should keep the rest  from tucking in, just acause they won't give an innocent lad the  benefit of the doubt.'    \"Well, that finished them. The thought of the hot breakfast made  the other chaps so ravenous as I believe they would have pitched  into Stokes and the other two, if they hadn't have given in. So  they comes round, and we sends out to say that we had agreed on the  vardict. It were the best game I ever seed in my life.\"    \"Well, Jacob, I am sure I am heartily grateful to you, and I shall  not forget your kindness; though what made you so sure of my  innocence, while all the others doubted it, I don't know.\"    \"Lor', Reuben!\" the smith said, \"There ain't nothing to thank me  about. I didn't know nowght as to whether you was innocent or  guilty; and it was a good job for me as I had made up my mind about  that there vardict, afore I went into court; for I should never  have made head or tail of all that talk, and the fellows with white  hair on the top of their heads as kept bobbing up and down, and  asking all sorts of questions, was enough to turn an honest man's  head. The question was settled when Miss Kate Ellison--that's the  little un, you know--came in here. Says she:    \"'Jacob, you are on this jury, I hear.'    \"'Yes, miss,' says I.    \"'Well, I hope you are going to find Reuben Whitney innocent,' says  she.    \"'I don't know nothing about it,' says I. 'Folks seem to think as  he did it.'    \"Then she went at me, and told me that she was sure you was  innocent; and the squire he was sure, and he would be moighty put  out if you was found guilty. So I told her natural that, the  squire's being a good landlord, I wouldn't disoblige him on no  account; and she might look upon it as good as settled that you  should be found innocent. So she tells me not to say a word to  anyone, and I ain't, not even to the ould woman; but in course, I  don't consider as she meant you.\"    Reuben could not help laughing as he learned that he had been  acquitted, not from any belief in his innocence on the part of the  jury, but by the intervention on his behalf of the girl who had,  before, fought his battles. Shaking hands with Jacob, he went on to  the schoolmaster's.    As he was sitting there chatting with Mr. and Mrs. Shrewsbury, he  saw Kate Ellison come out of her father's gate along the road with  her basket, as usual. Catching up his hat, he ran out and stood  bareheaded, awaiting her.    \"Ah, Reuben!\" she said, with a smile and a nod, \"I am glad to see  you before you go; for Mr. Shrewsbury told me, yesterday, you were  going to leave Lewes and emigrate. I am glad,\"--and she hesitated a  little--\"very glad that they found you innocent. I was quite sure  you would not do such a thing.\"    \"I am glad I came over today, Miss Ellison,\" Reuben said quietly.  \"Very glad that I have met you; for I have just learned, from Jacob  Priestley, that it is to you I am indebted that I am not, in the  present moment, a prisoner in jail, under sentence of transportation.\"    The girl flushed up hotly.    \"Jacob Priestley is very wrong to have spoken about it. I told him  he was never to mention it.\"    \"I hope you will not blame him, Miss Ellison. He told me he had  never spoken a word to anyone else, but he thought you did not mean  it to apply to me. I am very glad he has spoken; for I shall carry  away with me, across the sea, a deep gratitude, which will last as  long as I live, for the kindness you have shown me; not only now,  but always--kindness which has saved me from a terrible punishment,  for an offence of which I was innocent.    \"May God bless you, Miss Ellison, and render your life a happy  one.\"    \"Goodbye, Reuben,\" the girl said, gently. \"I hope you may do well,  in the new land you are going to.\"    So saying, she went on her errand. Reuben stood watching her, until  she entered one of the cottages. Then, putting on his cap, he  returned to the schoolmaster's.    A week later Reuben was wandering along the side of the London  Docks, looking at the vessels lying there, and somewhat confused at  the noise and bustle of loading and unloading that was going on. He  had come up the night before by the carrier's waggon, and had slept  at the inn where it stopped. His parting with his mother had been a  very sad one, but Mrs. Whitney had so far come round as to own that  she thought that his plan was perhaps the best; although she still  maintained that she should never venture, herself, upon so distant  a journey. He had promised that, should she not change her mind on  this point, he would, whether successful or not, come home to see  her.    The squire had driven over, the day before he left, to say goodbye  to him. He had, through Mr. Shrewsbury, directly he heard that he  was going, offered to help towards paying his passage money; but  this offer Reuben had gratefully, though firmly, declined to  accept.    \"Well, Reuben, I wish you every good luck on your adventure,\" he  said. \"The place you are going to will be a great country, one of  these days; and you are just the fellow to make your way in it. I  am sorry you wouldn't let me help you; because I am in a way, you  know, at the bottom of this business which has driven you from  home.\"    \"Thank you, squire, for your kind intention,\" Reuben answered; \"but  I am so much in your debt, now, that I would rather not go further  into it. I am old enough now to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20034"],[0,"Scottish Ghost Stories (#15)"],[1,"voice came softly to me through the gloom: \"It's an  owl--only an owl!\"    With lightning-like rapidity the truth then dawned on me, and as I  withdrew my clammy finger-tips from my ears, the faint fluttering of  wings reached me, through an open skylight. Once again I moved on;  the gallery was left behind, and I was well on my way down the  tortuous passage leading to my goal, when a luminous object, of vast  height and cylindrical shape, suddenly barred my progress.    Overcome by a deadly sickness, I sank on the floor, and, burying my  face in my hands, quite made up my mind that my last moments had come.    How long I remained in this position I cannot say, to me it seemed  eternity. I was eventually freed from it by the echo of a gentle  laugh, so kind, and gay, and girlish, that my terror at once departed,  and, on raising my head, I perceived that the cause of my panic was  nothing more than a broad beam of moonlight on a particularly  prominent angle of the wall.    Heartily ashamed at my cowardice, I got up, and, stepping briskly  forward, soon reached the stained-glass window.    Pressing my face against the pane, I peered through it, and there  immediately beneath me lay the flowers, glorified into dazzling gold  by the yellow colour of the glass. The sight thrilled me with joy--it  was sublime. My instinct had not deceived me, this was indeed the  long-looked-for home of the genii.    The temperature, which had been high, abnormally so for June, now  underwent an abrupt change, and a chill current of air, sweeping down  on me from the rear, made my teeth chatter. I involuntarily shrank  back from the window, and, as I did so, to my utter astonishment it  disappeared, and I saw, in its place, a room.    It was a long, low room, and opposite to me, at the farthest  extremity, was a large bay window, through which I could see the  nodding tops of the trees. The furniture was all green and of a  lighter, daintier make than any I had hitherto seen. The walls were  covered with pictures, the mantelshelf with flowers. Whilst I was  busily employed noting all these details, the door of the room opened,  and the threshold was gorgeously illuminated by a brilliant sunbeam,  from which suddenly evolved the figure of a young and lovely girl.    I can see her now as I saw her then--tall, and slender, with masses  of golden hair, waved artistically aside from a low forehead of  snowy white; finely-pencilled brows, and long eyes of the most  lustrous violet; a straight, delicately-moulded nose, a firm,  beautifully-proportioned chin, and a bewitching mouth. At her bosom  was a bunch of heliotrope, which, deftly undoing, she raised to her  nose and then laughingly held out to me. I was charmed; I took a step  forward towards her. The instant I did so, a wild look of terror  distorted her face, she waved me back, something jarred against my  knee, and, in the place of the room, I saw only the blurred outline  of trees through the yellow window-panes.    Bitterly disappointed, but absolutely sure that what I had seen was  objective, I retraced my steps to my bedroom and passed the remainder  of the night in sound sleep.    After breakfast, however, unable to restrain my curiosity longer, I  sought Miss Amelia, who was easier to approach than her sister, and,  managing after several efforts to screw up courage, blurted out the  story of my nocturnal escapade.    My aunt listened in silence. She was always gentle, but on this  occasion she surpassed herself.    \"I am not going to scold you, Esther,\" she said, smoothing out my  curls. \"After what you have seen it is useless to conceal the truth  from you. God perhaps intends you to know all. Years ago, Esther, this  house was not as you see it now. It had two wings, and, in the one  that no longer exists was the bedroom you saw in your vision. We  called it the Green Room because everything in it was green, your Aunt  Alicia--an aunt you have never heard of--who slept there, having a  peculiar fancy for that colour.    \"Alicia was our youngest sister, and we all loved her dearly. She was  just as you describe her--beautiful as a fairy, with golden hair, and  violet eyes, and she always wore a bunch of heliotrope in her dress.    \"One night, Esther, one lovely, calm, midsummer night, forty years  ago, this house was broken into by burglars. They got in through the  Green Room window, which was always left open during the warm  weather. We--my mother, your Aunt Deborah, and I--were awakened by a  loud shriek for help. Recognising Alicia's voice, we instantly flew  out of bed, and, summoning the servants, tore to the Green Room as  fast as we could.    \"To our horror, Esther, the door was locked, and before we could break  the lock the ruffians had murdered her! They escaped through the  window and were never caught. My mother, your great-grandmother, had  that part of the house pulled down, and on the site of it she planted  the white garden.    \"Though Alicia's earthly body died, and was taken from us, her  beautiful spirit remains with us here. It follows us about in the  daytime in the form of a sunbeam, whilst occasionally, at night, it  assumes her earthly shape. The house is what is generally termed  haunted, and, no doubt, some people would be afraid to live in it. But  that, Esther, is because they do not understand spirits--your Aunt  Deborah and I do.\"    \"Do you think, auntie,\" I asked with a thrill of joy, \"do you think it  at all likely that I shall see Aunt Alicia again to-night?\"    Aunt Amelia shook her head gently. \"No, my dear,\" she said slowly, \"I  think it will be impossible, because you are going home this  afternoon.\"                                    CASE X        \"---- HOUSE,\" NEAR BLYTHSWOOD SQUARE, GLASGOW.        THE HAUNTED BATH      When Captain W. de S. Smythe went to look over \"---- House,\" in the  neighbourhood of Blythswood Square, Glasgow, the only thing about the  house he did not like was the bathroom--it struck him as excessively  grim. The secret of the grimness did not lie, he thought, in any one  particular feature--in the tall, gaunt geyser, for example (though  there was always something in the look of a geyser when it was old and  dilapidated, as was the case with this one, that repelled him), or in  the dark drying-cupboard, or in the narrow, slit-like window; but in  the room as a whole, in its atmosphere and general appearance. He  could not diagnose it; he could not associate it with anything else he  had ever experienced; it was a grimness that he could only specify as  grim--grim with a grimness that made him feel he should not like to  be alone there in the dead of night. It was a nuisance, because the  rest of the house pleased him; moreover, the locality was convenient,  and the rent moderate, very moderate for such a neighbourhood. He  thought the matter well over as he leaned in the doorway of the  bathroom. He could, of course, have the room completely renovated--new  paper, new paint, and a fresh bath. Hot-water pipes! The geyser should  be done away with. Geysers were hideous, dangerous, and--pshaw, what  nonsense!--Ghostly! Ghostly! What absurd rot! How his wife would  laugh! That decided the question. His wife! She had expressed a very  ardent wish that he should take a house in or near Blythswood Square,  if he could get one on anything like reasonable terms, and here was  his chance. He would accompany the agent of the property to the  latter's office, and the preliminaries should be forthwith settled.    Six weeks later, he and his family were installed in the house, which  still reeked with the smell of fresh paint and paper. The first thing  the Captain did when he got there was to steal away slyly to the  bathroom, and as soon as he opened the door his heart sank. Despite  the many alterations the room had undergone, the grimness was still  there--there, everywhere. In the fine new six-foot bath, with its  glistening, gleaming, wooden framework; in the newly papered, newly  painted cupboard; in the walls, with their bright, fresh paper; in  the snowy surface of the whitewashed ceiling; in the air,--the very  air itself was full of it. The Captain was, as a rule, very fond of  his bath, but in his new quarters he firmly resolved that some one  else should use the bath before he made the experiment. In a very few  days the family had all settled down, and every one, with the  exception of the Captain, had had a bath, but no matter how many and  how bitter were his wife's complaints, try how he would, he could  not, he positively _could_ not, bring himself to wash in the  bathroom--_alone_. It was all right so long as the door was open, but  his wife resolutely refused to allow him to keep it open, and the  moment it was shut his abject terror returned--a terror produced by  nothing that he could in any way analyse or define. At last, ashamed  of his cowardice, he screwed up courage, and, with a look of  determined desperation in his eyes and mouth--an expression which  sent his wife into fits of laughter--set out one night from his  bedroom, candle in hand, and entered the bathroom. Shutting and  locking the door, he lighted another candle, and, after placing them  both on the mantelshelf, turned on the bath water, and began to  undress.    \"I may as well have a peep in the cupboard,\" he said, \"just to satisfy  myself no one is hiding there--for every one in the house knows how I  hate this beastly bathroom--with the intention of playing me a  practical joke. Supposing one of the maids--Polly, for example, I'm  sure she'd be quite capable--took it into her pretty head to\"--but  here the Captain was obliged to stop; he really was not equal to  facing, even in his mind's eye, the situation such a supposition  involved, and at the bare idea of such a thing his countenance assumed  a deeper hue, and--I am loth to admit--an amused grin. The grin,  however, died out as he cautiously opened the door and"]]]
