Rituparna thus departed--Nala, then the king of men,      In the city of Kundina--sojourned for no length of time.          BOOK XXVI.          There a month when he had sojourned--of king Bhima taking leave,      Guarded but by few attendants--to Nishadha took his way.      With a single splendid chariot--and with elephants sixteen,      And with fifty armed horsemen--and six hundred men on foot;      Making, as 'twere, earth to tremble--hastening onward, did the king,      Enter awful in his anger--and terrific in his speed.      Then the son of Virasena--to king Pushkara drew near;      \"Play we once again,\" then said he--\"much the wealth I have acquired:      All I have, even Damayanti--every treasure I possess,      Set I now upon the hazard--Pushkara, thy kingdom thou:      In the game once more contend we--'tis my settled purpose this,      Brother, at a single hazard--play we boldly for our lives.      From another he who treasures--he who mighty realm hath won,      'Tis esteemed a bounden duty--to play back the counter game.      If thou shrinkest from the hazard--be our game the strife of swords,      Meet we in the single combat--all our difference to decide.      An hereditary kingdom--may by any means be sought,      Be re-won by any venture--this the maxim of the wise.      Of two courses set before thee--Pushkara, the option make,      Or in play to stand the hazard--or in battle stretch the bow.\"      By Nishadha's lord thus challenged--Pushkara, with smile suppressed,      As secure of easy victory--answered to the lord of earth;      \"Oh what joy! abundant treasures--thou hast won, again to play;      Oh what joy! of Damayanti--now the hard-won prize is mine:      Oh what joy! again thou livest--with thy consort, mighty armed!      With the wealth I win bedecked--soon shall Bhima's daughter stand,      By my side, as by great Indra--stands the Apsara in heaven.[137]      Still on thee hath dwelt my memory--still I've waited, king, for thee;      In the play I find no rapture--but 'gainst kinsmen like thyself.      When this day the round-limbed princess--Damayanti, undespised,      I shall win, I rest contented--still within mine heart she dwells.\"        Hearing his contemptuous language--franticly thus pouring forth,      With his sword th' indignant Nala--fain had severed off his head.      But with haughty smile, with anger--glaring in his blood-red eyes,      \"Play we now, nor talk we longer--conquered, thou'lt no longer talk.\"      Then of Pushkara the gaming--and of Nala straight began:      In a single throw by Nala--was the perilous venture gained;      Pushkara, his gold, his jewels--at one hazard all was won!      Pushkara, in play thus conquered--with a smile the king rejoined:      \"Mine again is all this kingdom--undisturbed, its foes o'ercome.      Fallen king! Vidarbha's daughter--by thine eyes may ne'er be seen.      Thou art now, with all thy household--unto abject slavery sunk.      Not thyself achieved the conquest--that subdued me heretofore!      'Twas achieved by mightier Kali--that thou didst not, fool, perceive.      Yet my wrath, by him enkindled--will I not 'gainst thee direct;      Live thou henceforth at thy pleasure--freely I thy life bestow,      And of thine estate and substance--give I thee thy fitting share.      Such my pleasure, in thy welfare--hero, do I take delight,      And mine unabated friendship--never shall from thee depart.      Pushkara, thou art my brother--may'st thou live an hundred years!\"        Nala thus consoled his brother--in his conscious power and strength,      Sent him home to his own city--once embracing, once again.      Pushkara, thus finding comfort--answered to Nishadha's lord,      Answered he to Punyasloka--bowing low with folded hands:      \"Everlasting be thy glory! may'st thou live ten thousand years!      That my life to me thou grantest--and a city for mine home!\"        Hospitably entertained--there a month when he had dwelt,      Joyful to his own proud city--Pushkara, with all his kin,      With a well-appointed army--of attendant slaves an host,      Shining like the sun departed,--in his full meridian orb.        Pushkara thus crowned with riches--thus unharmed, when he dismissed,[138]      Entered then his royal city--with surpassing pomp, the king:      As he entered, to his subjects--Nala spake the words of peace.           *       *       *       *       *        From the city, from the country--all, with hair erect with joy,      Came, with folded hands addressed him--and the counsellors of state.      \"Happy are we now, O monarch--in the city, in the fields,      Setting forth to do thee homage--as to Indra all the gods.\"        Then at peace the tranquil city--the first festal gladness o'er,      With a mighty host escorted--Damayanti brought he home.      Damayanti rich in treasures--in her father's blessings rich,      Glad dismissed the mighty-minded--Bhima, fearful in his strength.      With the daughter of Vidarbha--with his children in his joy,      Nala lived, as lives the sovereign--of the gods in Nandana.[139]      Re-ascended thus to glory--he, among the kings of earth,      Ruled his realm in Jambudwipa[140]--thus re-won, with highest fame;      And all holy rites performed he--with devout munificence.          THE DEATH OF YAJNADATTA.          This extract from the Ramayana has been edited by M. Chezy,      with a free translation into French prose by M. Bournouf, a      literal version into Latin, and a grammatical commentary and      notes by the editor.        Through the arts of one of his wives Kaikeyi, to whom he had      made an incautious vow to grant her demand, Dasaratha is      obliged to send his victorious son Rama into banishment at      the very moment of his marriage with the beautiful Sita. Rama      is accompanied in his exile by Lakshmana. The following      episode describes the misery and distress of the father,      deprived of his favourite son.          THE DEATH OF YAJNADATTA.          Scarce Rama to the wilderness--had with his younger brother gone,      Abandoned to his deep distress--king Dasaratha sate alone.      Upon his sons to exile driven--when thought that king, as Indra bright,      Darkness came o'er him, as in heaven--when pales th' eclipsed sun his light.      Six days he sate, and mourned and pined--for Rama all that weary time,      At midnight on his wandering mind--rose up his old forgotten crime.      His queen Kausalya, the divine--addressed he, as she rested near:      \"Kausalya, if thou wak'st, incline--to thy lord's speech thy ready ear.      Whatever deed, or good or ill--by man, oh blessed queen, is wrought,      Its proper fruit he gathers still--by time to slow perfection brought.      He who the opposing counsel's weight--compares not in his judgment cool,      Or misery or bliss his fate--among the sage is deemed a fool.      As one that quits the Amra bower--the bright Palasa's pride to gain,      Mocked by the promise of its flower--seeks its unripening fruit in vain.      So I the lovely Amra left[141]--for the Palasa's barren bloom,[142]      Through mine own fatal error 'reft--of banished Rama, mourn in gloom.      Kausalya! in my early youth--by my keen arrow at its mark,      Aimed with too sure and deadly truth--was wrought a deed most fell and dark.      At length the evil that I did--hath fallen upon my fatal head,[143]      As when on subtle poison hid--an unsuspecting child hath fed;      Even as that child unwittingly--hath made the poisonous fare his food,      Even so in ignorance by me--was wrought that deed of guilt and blood.      Unwed wert thou in virgin bloom--and I in youth's delicious prime,      The season of the rains had come--that soft and love-enkindling time.      Earth's moisture all absorbed, the sun--through all the world its warmth          had spread,      Turned from the north, its course begun--where haunt the spirits of the          dead![144]      Gathering o'er all th' horizon's bound--on high the welcome clouds          appeared,[145]      Exulting all the birds flew round--cranes, cuckoos, peacocks, flew and          veered.      And all down each wide-water'd shore--the troubled, yet still limpid floods,      Over their banks began to pour--as o'er them hung the bursting clouds.      And, saturate with cloud-born dew--the glittering verdant-mantled earth,      The cuckoos and the peacocks flew--disputing as in drunken mirth.      In such a time, so soft, so bland--oh beautiful! I chanced to go,      With quiver, and with bow in hand--where clear Sarayu's waters flow.      If haply to the river's brink--at night the buffalo might stray,      Or elephant, the stream to drink,--intent my savage game to slay,      Then of a water cruise, as slow--it filled, the gurgling sound I heard,      Nought saw I, but the sullen low--of elephant that sound appeared.      The swift well-feathered arrow I--upon the bowstring fitting straight,      Toward the sound the shaft let fly--ah, cruelly deceived by fate!      The winged arrow scarce had flown--and scarce had reached its destined aim,      'Ah me, I'm slain,' a feeble moan--in trembling human accents came.      'Ah whence hath come this fatal shaft--against a poor recluse like me,      Who shot that bolt with deadly craft--alas! what cruel man is he?      At the lone midnight had I come--to draw the river's limpid flood,      And here am struck to death, by whom?--ah whose this wrongful deed of blood.      Alas! and in my parent's heart--the old, the blind, and hardly fed,      In the wild wood, hath pierced the dart--that here hath struck their          offspring dead.      Ah, deed most profitless as worst--a deed of wanton useless guilt;      As though a pupil's hand accurs'd[146]--his holy master's blood had spilt.      But not mine own untimely fate--it is not that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19549"],[0,"The Mind of the Child, Part II (#15)"],[1,"born deaf are precisely the ones that show plainly how necessary  hearing is for the acquirement of perfectly articulate speech. One who  is deaf from birth does not even learn to speak half a dozen sounds  correctly without assistance, and the loss of speech that regularly  follows deafness coming on in children who have already learned to  speak, shows how inseparably the learning and the development of perfect  articulation are bound up with the hearing. Even the deafness that comes  on in maturer years injures essentially the agreeable tone, often also  the intelligibility, of the utterance.    2. The Organic Conditions of Learning to Speak.    How is it, now, with the normal child, who is learning to speak? How is  it as to the existence and practicability of the nervous conduction, and  the genesis of the centers?    In order to decide these questions, a further extension of the diagram  is necessary (Fig. 3).    [Illustration: FIG. 3.]    For the last diagram deals only with the hearing and pronouncing of  sounds, syllables, and single words, not with the grammatical formation  and syntactical grouping of these; there must further be a center of  higher rank, the _dictorium_, or center of diction (Kussmaul), brought  into connection with the centers L S and W. And, on the one hand, the  word-image acquired (by hearing) must be at the disposition of the  diction-center, an excitation, therefore, passing from W to D (through  _m_); on the other hand, an impulse must go out from the diction-center  to pronounce the word that is formed and placed so as to correspond to  the sense (through _n_). The same is true for syllables and sounds,  whose paths to and from are indicated by _k_ and _l_, as well as by _g_  and _i_. These paths of connection must be of twofold sort. The  excitement can not pass off to the diction-center D on the same  anatomical path as the return impulse from D, because not a single case  is known of a nerve-fiber that in natural relations conducts both  centrifugally _and_ centripetally, although this possibility of double  conduction does occur under artificial circumstances. Apart, then, from  pathological experience, which seems to be in favor of it, the  separation of the two directions of the excitement seems to be justified  anatomically also. On the contrary, it is questionable whether the  impulse proceeding from D does not arrive directly at the motor  speech-center, instead of passing through W, S, or L. The diagram then  represents it as follows (Fig. 4). Here the paths of direct connection  _i_, _l_, and _n_ from D to M represent that which was just now  represented by _i_ L _d_ and _l_ S _e_ and _n_ W _f_, respectively; in  Fig. 4, _i_ conducts only sound-excitations coming from L, _l_ only  excitations coming from S, and _n_ only those coming from W, as impulses  for M. For the present, I see no way of deciding between the two  possibilities. They may even exist both together. All the following  statements concerning the localization of the disturbances of speech and  the parallel imperfections of child-speech apply indifferently to either  figure; it should be borne in mind that the nerve-excitement always goes  _only_ in the direction of the arrows, never in the opposite direction,  through the nervous path corresponding to them. Such a parallel is not  only presented, as I have found, and as I will show in what follows, by  the most superficial exhibition of the manifold deviations of  child-speech from the later perfect speech, but is, above all, necessary  for the answering of the question: what is the condition of things in  learning to speak?    [Illustration: FIG. 4.]    3. Parallel between the Disturbances of Speech in Adults and the  Imperfections of Speech in the Child.    In undertaking to draw such a parallel, I must first of all state that  in regard to the pathology of the subject, I have not much experience of  my own, and therefore I rely here upon Kussmaul's comprehensive work on  speech-disturbances, from which are taken most of the data that serve to  characterize the individual deviations from the rule. In that work also  may be found the explanations, or precise definitions, of almost all the  names--with the exception of the following, added here for the sake of  brevity--skoliophasia, skoliophrasia, and palimphrasia. On the other  hand, the statements concerning the speech of the child rest on my own  observations of children--especially of my own son--and readers who give  their attention to little children may verify them all; most of them,  indeed, with ease. Only the examples added for explaining mogilalia and  paralalia are taken in part from Sigismund, a few others from Vierordt.  They show more plainly (at least concerning rhotacism) than my own  notes, some imperfections of articulation of the child in the second  year, which occur, however, only in single individuals. In general the  defects of child-speech are found to be very unequally distributed among  different ages and individuals, so that we can hardly expect to find all  the speech-disturbances of adults manifested in typical fashion in one  and the same child. But with very careful observation it may be done,  notwithstanding; and when several children are compared with one another  in this respect, the analogies fairly force themselves upon the  observer, and there is no break anywhere.    The whole group into which I have tried to bring in organic connection  all the kinds of disturbances and defects of speech in systematic form  falls into three divisions:    1. Imperfections not occasioned by disturbance of the intelligence--pure  speech-disturbances or _lalopathies_.    2. Imperfections occasioned solely by disturbances of the  intelligence--disturbances of continuous speech or discourse  (Rede)--_dysphrasies_.    3. Imperfections of the language of gesture and feature--_dysmimies_.    I. LALOPATHY.    A. THE IMPRESSIVE PERIPHERAL PROCESSES DISTURBED.    _Deafness._--Persons able to speak but who have become deaf do not  understand what is spoken simply because they can _no longer_ hear. The  newly born do not understand what is spoken because they can _not yet_  hear. The paths _o_ and _a_ are not yet practicable. All those just born  are deaf and dumb.    _Difficulty of Hearing._--Persons who have become hard of hearing do not  understand what is spoken, or they misunderstand, because they _no  longer_ hear distinctly. Such individuals easily hear wrong (paracusis).    Very young infants do not understand what is spoken, for the reason that  they do _not yet_ hear distinctly; _o_ and _a_ are still difficult for  the acoustic nerve-excitement to traverse. Little children very easily  hear wrong on this account.    B. THE CENTRAL PROCESSES DISTURBED.    _Dysphasia._--In the child that can use only a small number of words,  the cerebral and psychical act through which he connects these with his  ideas and gives them grammatical form and syntactical construction in  order to express the movement of his thought is _not yet_ complete.    (1) The Sensory Processes centrally disturbed.    _Sensory Aphasia_ (Wernicke), _Word-Deafness_ (Kussmaul).--The child, in  spite of good hearing and sufficiently developed intelligence, can _not  yet_ understand spoken words because the path _m_ is not yet formed and  the storehouse of word images W is still empty or is just in the stage  of origination.    _Amnesia, Amnesic Dysphasia and Aphasia, Partial and Total Word-Amnesia,  Memory-Aphasia._--The child has as yet no word-memory, or only a weak  one, utters meaningless sounds and sound-combinations. He can _not yet_  use words because he does not yet have them at his disposal as acoustic  sound-combinations. In this stage, however, much that is said to him can  be repeated correctly in case W is passable, though empty or imperfectly  developed.    (2) The Sensori-motor Processes of Diction disturbed.    _Acataphasia_ (Steinthal).--The child that has already a considerable  number of words at his disposal is _not yet_ in condition to arrange  them in a sentence syntactically. He can _not yet_ frame correct  sentences to express the movement of his thought, because his  diction-center D is still imperfectly developed. He expresses a whole  sentence by a word; e. g., _hot!_ means as much as \"The milk is too hot  for me to drink,\" and then again it may mean \"The stove is too hot!\"  _Man!_ means \"A strange man has come!\"    _Dysgrammatism_ (Kussmaul) _and Agrammatism_ (Steinthal).--Children can  _not yet_ put words into correct grammatical form, decline, or  conjugate. They like to use the indefinite noun-substantive and the  infinitive, likewise to some extent the past participle. They prefer the  weak inflection, ignore and confound the articles, conjunctions,  auxiliaries, prepositions, and pronouns. In place of \"I\" they say their  own names, also _tint_ (for \"Kind\"--child or \"baby\"). Instead of \"Du,  er, Sie\" (thou, he, you), they use proper names, or man, papa, mamma.  Sometimes, too, the adjectives are placed after the nouns, and the  meaning of words is indicated by their position with reference to  others, by the intonation, by looks and gestures. Agrammatism in  child-language always appears in company with acataphasia, often also in  insane persons. When the imbecile Tony says, \"Tony flowers taken,  attendant come, Tony whipped\" (Tony Blumen genommen, Waerterin gekommen,  Tony gehaut), she speaks exactly like a child (Kussmaul), without  articles, pronouns, or auxiliary verbs, and, like the child, uses the  weak inflection. The connection _m_ of the word-image-center W with the  diction-center D, i. e., of the word-memory with grammar, and the  centers themselves, are as yet very imperfectly developed, unused.    _Bradyphasia._--Children that can already frame sentences take a  surprising amount of time in speaking on account of the slowness of  their diction.
