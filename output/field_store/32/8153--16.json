(#15)"],[1,"titution.\" A total change of  men, measures, and counsels was involved in this reply; but the king had  some \"friends\" whom he wished to retain in their official situations,  and such a sweeping change could not be conceded. The Duke of Cumberland  continued his endeavours to form a ministry for a day or two, but no  one, possessing any merit, would undertake office when it was known  that Pitt had refused, and the king was compelled to retain his old  ministers. This was a mortifying circumstance in itself, but it was  rendered doubly so by the insolent behaviour of some of the members of  the cabinet. When he desired to know the conditions of their continuance  in office, they peremptorily demanded a royal promise of never  consulting the Earl of Bute; the instant dismissal of Mr. Mackenzie, his  lordship's brother, from his high offices in Scotland; the deprivation  of the paymastership of the forces, held by Lord Holland, which should  be given to a member of the House of Commons; the nomination of Lord  Granby to be head of the army; and the discretionary power of nominating  to the government of Ireland whoever they pleased. The king expressed  his anger and astonishment at these hard terms, and bade them return at  ten o'clock at night for his answer. A partial compliance, however, was  necessary, and before the appointed hour he sent them word by the lord  chancellor that he would not bind himself by a promise never to consult  Bute, though he acquiesced in the propriety of not letting him interfere  in the councils of the state; that he consented to displace Mr.  Mackenzie from his office, as well as Lord Holland; but that he  absolutely refused the article about Lord Granby. Ministers now took  time to consider, but they were too fond of office to retire without  being actually compelled. On the following morning they gave up the  point of Lord Granby, and contented themselves with the promise of  not permitting Bute to interfere. They were, therefore, to continue in  office; and Charles Townshend was made paymaster of the forces, while  Lord Weymouth was appointed to the government in Ireland. But the king  considered that he was dishonoured, and that he was held in thraldom  by his ministers, whence he soon made fresh efforts to deliver himself.  Again he negociated with Pitt, and again negociations with him fell to  the ground. Pitt could not engage without Lord Temple, and Temple, when  sent for, raised objections which rendered the whole scheme abortive.  But the king was resolute in his determination to free himself from the  chains by which his ministers had enthralled him. Early in July, he  once more applied to his uncle, who undertook to treat with the Duke  of Newcastle, whose parliamentary weight was nearly a counterpoise to  Pitt's oratory and popularity. Newcastle joined Cumberland in addressing  himself to the more moderate section of the opposition, and at length  a new ministry was formed. The Marquis of Rockingham became head of the  treasury; General Conway became one of the secretaries of state, and was  intrusted with the House of Commons; the Duke of Grafton was the other  secretary of state; Mr. Dowdeswell was the chancellor of the exchequer;  the Earl of Hertford was made lord-lieutenant of Ireland, instead of  Lord Weymouth; the president's chair, vacated by the Duke of Bedford,  was given to Lord Winchelsea; and the Duke of Newcastle contented  himself with the privy seal. The celebrated Edmund Burke was engaged as  private secretary by Lord Rockingham, and now, for the first time, had  a seat in parliament. There seemed a reasonable hope that this ministry  would obtain strength and durability, but it wanted Pitt for its  supporter; and it was weakened in October by the death of the Duke of  Cumberland. This blow was more severely felt, because there was a want  of union in the members of this cabinet from the first, and where  there is no union there can be no real strength. Moreover, the Earl  of Rockingham, though one of the most honest, honourable, and  well-intentioned men in existence at that period, lacked the ability  for collecting the scattered energies of party, and forming them into a  system, whence it was soon found that his cabinet was unpopular; and, at  no distant period of time, it was compelled to give place to another. In  the whole course of its existence, indeed, it exhibited the lack of that  vitality which could alone make it memorable and enduring.    {GEORGE III 1765-1769.}          OPPOSITION TO THE STAMP DUTIES IN AMERICA.    The fatal effects of Grenville's Stamp Act were soon made manifest--the  storm which the anticipation of it had raised, grew into a perfect  hurricane as soon as it was known in America that it was consummated.  Throughout the whole country a disposition existed to resist to the  death, rather than submit. The episcopalian and aristocratic colonists  of Virginia, alike with the presbyterian and democratic colonists of New  England, denounced the measure in the strongest language, and displayed  strong feelings of dislike to it. Nay, the Assembly of Virginia, which  hitherto had been pre-eminent in loyalty, was now the first to set an  example of disobedience. The House of Assembly there was shaken by  the eloquence of Patrick Henry, who took the lead in the debate. In  a resolution which he brought forward against the Stamp Act, Henry  exclaimed--\"Caesar had his Brutus; Charles I. his Oliver Cromwell; and  George III.\"--the orator at this point was interrupted by a voice crying  \"treason!\" and, pausing for a moment, he added, \"and George III. may  profit by that example. If that be treason, make the most of it.\" When  tranquillity was restored, the assembly voted a series of resolutions,  declaring that the first settlers in Virginia had brought with them all  the privileges and immunities enjoyed by the people of England; that  they possessed the exclusive right of taxing themselves in their own  representative assemblies, which right had been constantly recognised by  the king and parliament of Great Britain; and that every attempt to  vest such a power in any other person or persons was illegal,  unconstitutional, and unjust, and had a tendency to destroy both  British and American independence. This had a great effect on the other  colonies, and the house of representatives of Boston suggested that a  congress should be held at New York, whither each province should send  deputies to concert measures for averting the grievance of the Stamp  Act. Nine out of thirteen of the colonies sent their delegates to this  congress, and fourteen strong resolutions were passed condemnatory of  the bill; and three petitions were concocted--one to the king, another  to the lords, and a third to the commons. From the decorous manner  adopted in its proceedings little alarm was excited, but by it an  important point was gained to the Americans--a closer connexion  was established by the meeting among the leading men of the various  colonies; and thus a way was prepared for a more general and extensive  combination should it be required by circumstances.    It was not in the assemblies alone that resistance to the Stamp Act was  manifested. Ominous proceedings were adopted by the public. As soon as  the news of it arrived in America, at Boston the colours of the shipping  were hoisted half-mast high, and the bells were rung muffled; at New  York the act was printed with a skull and cross bones, and hawked about  the streets by the title of \"England's Folly, and America's Ruin;\" while  at Philadelphia the people spiked the very guns on the ramparts.  The public irritation daily increased, and when at length the stamps  arrived, it was found impossible either to put them into circulation,  or to preserve them from destruction. The distributors were even forced  publicly to renounce, on oath, all concern with them; and riots broke  out in Boston, and several other cities, at which the public authorities  were compelled to connive. Law-agents generally resolved to forego the  practice of their profession rather than use stamps, and all stamped  mercantile or custom-house papers were seized as the ships came into  port, and publicly committed to the flames. By the 1st of November, the  time when the act came into operation, not a sheet of stamped paper was  to be found; and, therefore, all business which could not be legally  carried on without it, was brought to a stand--the courts of justice  were closed, and the ports shut up.    These measures were followed by others far more injurious to the  interests of Great Britain. Merchants entered into solemn engagements  not to order any more goods from England; to recall the orders already  given, if not fulfilled by the 1st of January, 1766; and not to dispose  of any goods sent to them on commission after that date, unless the  Stamp Act, and even the Sugar and Paper-money Acts were repealed.  Measures were also taken to render the importation of British  manufactures unnecessary. A society for the promotion of arts and  commerce was instituted at New York, and markets opened for the sale of  home-made goods, which soon poured into them from every quarter. Linens,  woollens, paper-hangings, coarse kind of iron-ware, and various other  articles of domestic life were approved by the society, and eagerly  purchased by the public. People of the highest fashion even preferred  wearing home-spun, or old clothes, rather than purchase articles which  could conduce to the welfare of Britain; and lest the new manufactories  should fail from want of materials, many entered into an engagement to  abstain from the flesh of the lamb. All classes were animated by the  spirit of resistance to their mother-country, and resolutions began to  be circulated of stopping exports as well as imports, and of preventing  the tobacco of Virginia and South Carolina from finding its way into the  British markets. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19237"],[0,"The Secret of Divine Civilization (#15)"],[1," is  one of them.\" They have not even grasped what is meant by the \"imitation\"  referred to, nor do they know that the Divine religions enjoin upon and  encourage all the faithful to adopt such principles as will conduce to  continuous improvements, and to acquire from other peoples sciences and  arts. Whoever expresses himself to the contrary has never drunk of the  nectar of knowledge and is astray in his own ignorance, groping after the  mirage of his desires.    Judge this aright: which one of these modern developments, whether in  themselves or in their application, is contrary to the Divine  commandments? If they mean the establishment of parliaments, these are  enjoined by the very text of the holy verse: \"and whose affairs are guided  by mutual counsel.\"(67) And again, addressing the Dayspring of all  knowledge, the Source of perfection (Muhammad), in spite of His being in  possession of universal wisdom, the words are: \"and consult them in the  affair.\"(68) In view of this how can the question of mutual consultation  be in conflict with the religious Law? The great advantages of  consultation can be established by logical arguments as well.    Can they say that it would be contrary to the laws of God to make a death  sentence conditional on the most careful investigations, on the sanction  of numerous bodies, on legal proof and the royal order? Can they claim  that what went on under the previous government was in conformity with the  Qur'an? For example, in the days when Haji Mirza Aqasi was Prime Minister,  it was heard from many sources that the governor of Gulpaygan seized  thirteen defenseless bailiffs of that region, all of them of holy lineage,  all of them guiltless, and without a trial, and without obtaining any  higher sanction, beheaded them in a single hour.            [PAGES 101-116]      At one time the population of Persia exceeded fifty millions. This has  been dissipated partly through civil wars, but predominantly because of  the lack of an adequate system of government and the despotism and  unbridled authority of provincial and local governors. With the passage of  time, not one-fifth of the population has survived, for the governors  would select any victim they cared to, however innocent, and vent their  wrath on him and destroy him. Or, for a whim, they would make a pet out of  some proven mass murderer. Not a soul could speak out, because the  governor was in absolute control. Can we say that these things were in  conformity with justice or with the laws of God?    Can we maintain that it is contrary to the fundamentals of the Faith to  encourage the acquisition of useful arts and of general knowledge, to  inform oneself as to the truths of such physical sciences as are  beneficial to man, and to widen the scope of industry and increase the  products of commerce and multiply the nation's avenues of wealth? Would it  conflict with the worship of God to establish law and order in the cities  and organize the rural districts, to repair the roads and build railroads  and facilitate transportation and travel and thus increase the people's  well-being? Would it be inconsistent with the Divine commands and  prohibitions if we were to work the abandoned mines which are the greatest  source of the nation's wealth, and to build factories, from which come the  entire people's comfort, security and affluence? Or to stimulate the  creation of new industries and to promote improvements in our domestic  products?    By the All-Glorious! I am astonished to find what a veil has fallen across  their eyes, and how it blinds them even to such obvious necessities as  these. And there is no doubt whatever that when conclusive arguments and  proofs of this sort are advanced, they will answer, out of a thousand  hidden spites and prejudices: \"On the Day of Judgment, when men stand  before their Lord, they will not be questioned as to their education and  the degree of their culture--rather will they be examined as to their good  deeds.\" Let us grant this and assume that man will not be asked as to his  culture and education; even so, on that great Day of Reckoning, will not  the leaders be called to account? Will it not be said to them: \"O chiefs  and leaders! Why did ye cause this mighty nation to fall from the heights  of its former glory, to pass from its place at the heart and center of the  civilized world? Ye were well able to take hold of such measures as would  lead to the high honor of this people. This ye failed to do, and ye even  went on to deprive them of the common benefits enjoyed by all. Did not  this people once shine out like stars in an auspicious heaven? How have ye  dared to quench their light in darkness! Ye could have lit the lamp of  temporal and eternal glory for them; why did ye fail to strive for this  with all your hearts? And when by God's grace a flaming Light flared up,  why did ye fail to shelter it in the glass of your valor, from the winds  that beat against it? Why did ye rise up in all your might to put it out?\"    \"And every man's fate have We fastened about his neck: and on the Day of  Resurrection will We bring it forth to him a book which shall be proffered  to him wide open.\"(69)    Again, is there any deed in the world that would be nobler than service to  the common good? Is there any greater blessing conceivable for a man, than  that he should become the cause of the education, the development, the  prosperity and honor of his fellow-creatures? No, by the Lord God! The  highest righteousness of all is for blessed souls to take hold of the  hands of the helpless and deliver them out of their ignorance and  abasement and poverty, and with pure motives, and only for the sake of  God, to arise and energetically devote themselves to the service of the  masses, forgetting their own worldly advantage and working only to serve  the general good. \"They prefer them before themselves, though poverty be  their own lot.\"(70) \"The best of men are those who serve the people; the  worst of men are those who harm the people.\"    Glory be to God! What an extraordinary situation now obtains, when no one,  hearing a claim advanced, asks himself what the speaker's real motive  might be, and what selfish purpose he might not have hidden behind the  mask of words. You find, for example, that an individual seeking to  further his own petty and personal concerns, will block the advancement of  an entire people. To turn his own water mill, he will let the farms and  fields of all the others parch and wither. To maintain his own leadership,  he will everlastingly direct the masses toward that prejudice and  fanaticism which subvert the very base of civilization.    Such a man, at the same moment that he is perpetrating actions which are  anathema in the sight of God and detested by all the Prophets and Holy  Ones, if he sees a person who has just finished eating wash his hands with  soap--an article the inventor of which was 'Abdu'llah Buni, a Muslim--will,  because this unfortunate does not instead wipe his hands up and down the  front of his robe and on his beard, set up a hue and cry to the effect  that the religious law has been overthrown, and the manners and customs of  heathen nations are being introduced into ours. Utterly disregarding the  evil of his own ways, he considers the very cause of cleanliness and  refinement as wicked and foolish.    O People of Persia! Open your eyes! Pay heed! Release yourselves from this  blind following of the bigots, this senseless imitation which is the  principal reason why men fall away into paths of ignorance and  degradation. See the true state of things. Rise up; seize hold of such  means as will bring you life and happiness and greatness and glory among  all the nations of the world.    The winds of the true springtide are passing over you; adorn yourselves  with blossoms like trees in the scented garden. Spring clouds are  streaming; then turn you fresh and verdant like the sweet eternal fields.  The dawn star is shining, set your feet on the true path. The sea of might  is swelling, hasten to the shores of high resolve and fortune. The pure  water of life is welling up, why wear away your days in a desert of  thirst? Aim high, choose noble ends; how long this lethargy, how long this  negligence! Despair, both here and hereafter, is all you will gain from  self-indulgence; abomination and misery are all you will harvest from  fanaticism, from believing the foolish and the mindless. The confirmations  of God are supporting you, the succor of God is at hand: why do you not  cry out and exult with all your heart, and strive with all your soul!    Among those matters which require thorough revision and reform is the  method of studying the various branches of knowledge and the organization  of the academic curriculum. From lack of organization, education has  become haphazard and confused. Trifling subjects which should not call for  elaboration receive undue attention, to such an extent that students, over  long periods of time, waste their minds and their energies on material  that is pure supposition, in no way susceptible of proof, such study  consisting in going deep into statements and concepts which careful  examination would establish as not even unlikely, but rather as unalloyed  superstition, and representing the investigation of useless conceits and  the chasing of absurdities. There can be no doubt that to concern oneself  with such illusions, to examine into and lengthily debate such idle  propositions, is nothing but a waste of time and a marring of the days of  one's life. Not only this, but it also prevents the individual from  undertaking the study of those arts and sciences of which society stands  in dire need. The individual should, prior to engaging in the study of any  subject, ask himself what its uses are and what fruit and result will  derive from it. If it is a useful branch of knowledge, that is, if society"]]]
