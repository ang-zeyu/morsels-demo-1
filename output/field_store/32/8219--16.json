Strange as all these beliefs seem to us now, they were a very real  factor in the intellectual conceptions of the Renaissance period, no  less than of the Middle Ages, and amidst them there is to be found at  times a foreshadowing of more modern knowledge. Many other persons  were also more or less associated with the magical school, amongst  them Franz von Sickingen. Reuchlin himself, by his Hebrew studies, and  especially by his introduction of the Kabbala to Gentile readers,  also contributed a not unimportant influence in determining the course  of the movement. The line between the so-called black magic, or  operations conducted through the direct agency of evil spirits, and  white magic, which sought to subject Nature to the human will by the  discovery of her mystical and secret laws, or the character of the  quasi-personified intelligent principles under whose form Nature  presented herself to their minds, had never throughout the Middle Ages  been very clearly defined. The one always had a tendency to shade off  into the other, so that even Roger Bacon's practices were, although  not condemned, at least looked upon somewhat doubtfully by the Church.  At the time of which we treat, however, the interest in such matters  had become universal amongst all intelligent persons. The scientific  imagination at the close of the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance  period was mainly occupied with three questions: the discovery of the  means of transmuting the baser metals into gold, or otherwise of  producing that object of universal desire; to discover the Elixir  Vitae, by which was generally understood the invention of a drug which  would have the effect of curing all diseases, restoring man to  perennial youth, and, in short, prolonging human life indefinitely;  and, finally, the search for the Philosopher's Stone, the happy  possessor of which would not only be able to achieve the first two,  but also, since it was supposed to contain the quintessence of all the  metals, and therefore of all the planetary influences to which the  metals corresponded, would have at his command all the forces which  mould the destinies of men. In especial connection with the latter  object of research may be noted the universal interest in astrology,  whose practitioners were to be found at every Court, from that of the  Emperor himself to that of the most insignificant prince or princelet,  and whose advice was sought and carefully heeded on all important  occasions. Alchemy and astrology were thus the recognized physical  sciences of the age, under the auspices of which a Copernicus and a  Tycho Brahe were born and educated.    FOOTNOTES:    [12] Cf. Sebastian Franck, _Chronica_, for an account of a visit of  Paracelsus to Nuernberg.          CHAPTER IV    THE SIXTEENTH-CENTURY GERMAN TOWN      From what has been said the reader may form for himself an idea of the  intellectual and social life of the German town of the period. The  wealthy patrician class, whose mainstay politically was the _Rath_,  gave the social tone to the whole. In spite of the sharp and sometimes  brutal fashion in which class distinctions asserted themselves then,  as throughout the Middle Ages, there was none of that aloofness  between class and class which characterizes the bourgeois society of  the present day. Each town, were it great or small, was a little world  in itself, so that every citizen knew every other citizen more or  less. The schools attached to its ecclesiastical institutions were  practically free of access to all the children whose parents could  find the means to maintain them during their studies; and consequently  the intellectual differences between the different classes were by no  means necessarily proportionate to the difference in social position.  So far as culture and material prosperity were concerned, the towns  of Bavaria and Franconia, Munich, Augsburg, Regensburg, and perhaps,  above all, Nuernberg, represented the high-water mark of mediaeval  civilization as regards town life. On entering the burg, should it  have happened to be in time of peace and in daylight, the stranger  would clear the drawbridge and the portcullis without much challenge;  passing along streets lined with the houses and shops of the burghers,  in whose open frontages the master and his apprentices and _gesellen_  plied their trades, discussing eagerly over their work the politics of  the town, and at this period probably the theological questions which  were uppermost in men's minds, our visitor would make his way to some  hostelry, in whose courtyard he would dismount from his horse, and,  entering the common room, or _Stube_, with its rough but artistic  furniture of carved oak, partake of his flagon of wine or beer,  according to the district in which he was travelling, whilst the host  cracked a rough and possibly coarse jest with the other guests, or  narrated to them the latest gossip of the city. The stranger would  probably find himself before long the object of interrogatories  respecting his native place and the object of his journey (although  his dress would doubtless have given general evidence of this),  whether he were a merchant or a travelling scholar or a practiser of  medicine; for into one of those categories it might be presumed the  humble but not servile traveller would fall. Were he on a diplomatic  mission from some potentate he would be travelling at the least as a  knight or a noble, with spurs and armour, and, moreover, would be  little likely to lodge in a public house of entertainment.    In the _Stube_ he would probably see, drinking heavily,  representatives of the ubiquitous _Landsknechte_, the mercenary troops  enrolled for Imperial purposes by the Emperor Maximilian towards the  end of the previous century, who in the intervals of war were  disbanded and wandered about spending their pay, and thus constituted  an excessively disintegrative element in the life of the time. A  contemporary writer[13] describes them as the curse of Germany, and  stigmatizes them as \"unchristian, God-forsaken folk, whose hand is  ever ready in striking, stabbing, robbing, burning, slaying, gaming,  who delight in wine-bibbing, whoring, blaspheming, and in the making  of widows and orphans.\"    Presently, perhaps, a noise without indicates the arrival of a new  guest. All hurry forth into the courtyard, and their curiosity is  more keenly whetted when they perceive by the yellow knitted scarf  round the neck of the new-comer that he is an _itinerans  scholasticus_, or travelling scholar, who brings with him not only the  possibility of news from the outer world, so important in an age when  journals were non-existent and communications irregular and deficient,  but also a chance of beholding wonder-workings, as well as of being  cured of the ailments which local skill had treated in vain. Already  surrounded by a crowd of admirers waiting for the words of wisdom to  fall from his lips, he would start on that exordium which bore no  little resemblance to the patter of the modern quack, albeit  interlarded with many a Latin quotation and great display of mediaeval  learning. \"Good people and worthy citizens of this town,\" he might  say, \"behold in me the great master ... prince of necromancers,  astrologer, second mage, chiromancer, agromancer, pyromancer,  hydromancer. My learning is so profound that were all the works of  Plato and Aristotle lost to the world I could from memory restore them  with more elegance than before. The miracles of Christ were not so  great as those which I can perform wherever and as often as I will. Of  all alchemists I am the first, and my powers are such that I can  obtain all things that man desires. My shoe-buckles contain more  learning than the heads of Galen and Avicenna, and my beard has more  experience than all your high schools. I am monarch of all learning. I  can heal you of all diseases. By my secret arts I can procure you  wealth. I am the philosopher of philosophers. I can provide you with  spells to bind the most potent of the devils in hell. I can cast your  nativities and foretell all that shall befall you, since I have that  which can unlock the secrets of all things that have been, that are,  and that are to come.\"[14] Bringing forth strange-looking phials,  covered with cabalistic signs, a crystal globe and an astro-labe,  followed by an imposing scroll of parchment inscribed with mysterious  Hebraic-looking characters, the travelling student would probably  drive a roaring trade amongst the assembled townsmen in love-philtres,  cures for the ague and the plague, and amulets against them,  horoscopes, predictions of fate, and the rest of his stock-in-trade.    As evening approaches, our traveller strolls forth into the streets  and narrow lanes of the town, lined with overhanging gables that  almost meet overhead and shut out the light of the afternoon sun, so  that twilight seems already to have fallen. Observing that the  burghers, with their wives and children, the work of the day being  done, are all wending toward the western gate, he goes along with the  stream till, passing underneath the heavy portcullis and through the  outer rampart, he finds himself in the plain outside, across which a  rugged bridle-path leads to a large quadrangular meadow, rough and  more or less worn, where a considerable crowd has already assembled.  This is the _Allerwiese_, or public pleasure-ground of the town. Here  there are not only high festivities on Sundays and holidays, but every  fine evening in summer numbers of citizens gather together to watch  the apprentices exercising their strength in athletic feats, and  competing with one another in various sports, such as running,  wrestling, spear-throwing, sword-play, and the like,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20464"],[0,"A Journey Through France in War Time (#15)"],[1,"started and  managed by the Schneider Company and gradually left in the hands of the  workmen themselves.    Club houses are maintained with tennis courts, fencing bouts, games,  gymnasiums, a children's theatre, gun clubs, rowing clubs and musical  societies. The time spent in rehearsing for orchestras is not deducted  from the pay. Free medical attendance for the workman and his family is  given. Emergency and base hospitals are provided by the company. Modern  and up-to-date mutual benefit societies are managed by the workmen. Old  age pensions have been financed differently during the last century and  are now supported by one per cent. from the workman, two per cent. from  the Schneider Company, and three per cent. from the State.    Houses are provided for men over sixty years of age, and when it is  possible aged couples are kept together.    We reached Dole at 9 o'clock P. M. on Monday, October 2nd.    Dole is the birthplace of Pasteur, the great French scientist who  discovered the antidote for hydrophobia. His name is known throughout  the world.          XI.    APPROACHING THE FRONT      After leaving Dole, the next stop on our itinerary was Besancon, from  which we entered the zone of actual hostilities. For us this town was  the gateway to \"The Front\" and therefore a point of more than usual  interest. Here we were asked to sign the following paper, which all  members of the commission did on October 4th, we having reached the town  at midnight on October 2nd.    Besancon, October 4, 1916.    The itinerary arranged for the American Industrial Commission  includes several days' sojourn at the \"front\", which is considered  of importance in the prosecution of its investigation, particularly  as preliminary to a conference in Paris with the \"American Centrale  pour la Reprise de l' Activite Industrielle dans Les Regions  Envahies.\"    The danger of such a trip is fully recognized and hereby admitted,  and although the extraordinary risk inseparably connected with a  trip to Europe at this time has been accepted by us all, yet, in  the present case    Each of the undersigned by this means records for himself his  voluntary assumption by him of all responsibility in connection  therewith, and furthermore, asserts that neither by coercion,  persuasion, nor even by suggestion on the part of the Chairman, or  otherwise, has his course been determined.      M. W. W. Nichols,    M. J. G. Butler, Jr.    M. A. B. Farquhar,    M. G. B. Ford,    M. S. F. Hoggson,    M. J. F. Le Maistre,    M. J. R. Mac Arthur,    M. Le Dr. C. O. Mailloux,    M. C. G. Pfeiffer,    M. J. E. Sague,    M. E. A. Warren,    M. E. V. Douglass,    M. E. Garden.    We were met by the military automobiles at the station, two soldiers in  each auto. I was accosted at the station by a number of wounded English  soldiers. It seemed good to hear a little English spoken. One of the  soldiers reached out his hand as I passed and said, \"How are you?\" We  were domiciled at the Hotel Europe. The windows were barred with iron  shutters excluding light and fresh air. Early the following morning we  were treated to the sight of more than one thousand German prisoners,  just captured and being taken to the camp at Besancon.    This was the birthplace of Victor Hugo, who was born February 26th,  1802. Old Roman ruins were very much in evidence, among them an old  Roman citadel and a Roman theatre. By tradition, St. John the Baptist  was buried here. We visited the underground water works and the  Cathedral of St. Jean and saw in this church many paintings of the Holy  Family and other religious representations. There were two immense holes  in this cathedral, the result of bombs fired from the German guns in  1914, in the beginning of the war.    [Illustration: German Prisoners Passing Through the Village of St.  Etienne.]    I saw here a girl and a dog hitched to the same cart, hauling a load of  vegetables; they both seemed contented.    Luncheon was served by the Chamber of Commerce at the Resturant De  Besancon. In the evening we were given a banquet at the Besancon Hotel  de Ville. Up to this time I had been with the Commission five weeks, but  on account of my patriotic utterances in private and my quite apparent  sympathy with the French people, was not urged to speak. It had been,  however, arranged that I was to talk at Le Creusot, but there was not a  representative gathering to talk to there, and this Besancon banquet  seemed to be the proper place. After some pressure of other members of  the Commission I was requested to speak. This was really the first note  of human sympathy sounded. I first spoke in English, which not more than  two or three in the audience, outside of the Commissioners, understood,  although there were about one hundred present. At the conclusion of my  talk it was translated into French by Mr. MacArthur. When he got  through I was surrounded by the Frenchmen present and congratulated as  well as embraced by practically the entire audience. This address is  reproduced by special request of some of the members of the Commission  who heard it.    Gentlemen:--    I am afraid my aeroplane French will not be understood by our good  friends present. I tried it on a number of our Franco-American  orators, and they, with one accord, said it was fine and beautiful,  but they could not understand a word I was saying. I will,  therefore, ask my fellow-traveler and sympathizer, Mr. MacArthur,  to read the brief address I have prepared, apologizing through him  for the lamentable fact that I speak English only.    This gives me an opportunity of saying that by special letter of  authorization issued by Dr. Ricketts President of the American  Institute of Mining Engineers, I represent that important  organization during our mission in France. The American Institute  of Mining Engineers is composed of more than six thousand members,  all technical, scientific and practical men. The organization has  been in existence more than a quarter of a century, and has  rendered invaluable service to our mining and manufacturing  interests in the United States. This scientific body of men stand  ready to render such service to France as France may desire and it  is hoped this suggestion may receive serious consideration.    Gentlemen: When our good ship, the Lafayette, passed through the  river entering the port of Bordeaux, we beheld a most beautiful  sunset, such as Cazin would have painted. As we beheld this  glorious vision, it flashed through my mind that France is  fighting for its existence among nations, and my heart went out to  all France in loving sympathy. As we landed and progressed on our  journey, this feeling of reverence and affection for the French  people became intensified. The French spirit insures victory--a  victory which, when gained, will be substantial and enduring,  worthy of the great people who are pouring out their life blood and  treasure to attain this end.    Everywhere we have been impressed with the earnestness of the women  in France. All the thousands we have seen at their employment  impressed me with their desire to help save the country. In a word,  as I looked upon their faces, all seemed to express the thought,  \"We are working for France\". This slogan goes all over your fair  land and is a mighty factor in the progress of the conflict. Signs  of loss were everywhere from Bordeaux to Paris, and in our  wanderings since, but not a word of complaint have we heard.    Our visit to the birthplace of your countryman, Lafayette, was  looked forward to with intense interest, and the visit was a keen  realization of the expectation. As our worthy President, Mr.  Nichols, raised his glass and asked that we pause for a moment in  silence and think of the great man who was the companion and aide  of Washington, \"first in war, first in peace, and first in the  hearts of his countrymen,\" there was not a dry eye in the room. All  present realized the close relationship between France and the  United States--cemented and welded for all time to come by the  early sympathy of France for our struggling colonies, and the great  assistance rendered by Lafayette to Washington in our time of need,  and which resulted in our independence.    In the present struggle of France, we owe it to the French people  to aid in all possible ways. I believe that a great majority of the  citizens of the United States are in sympathy with France and  their prayers are for your success and freedom.    It may not be out of place in this connection to mention, although  somewhat personal, that when Lafayette, visited the United States  in 1824, my grandfather, whose name I bear, attended a reception  given the great Frenchman in Philadelphia, and has often told me  about it, dwelling upon the enthusiasm with which Lafayette was  everywhere greeted during his triumphant tour through the country.  I have also in my autograph collection a three page patriotic  letter written by Lafayette in 1824 during his visit. I prize this  letter most highly.    Another fact I may mention, and it gives me profound pleasure to do  so. France, in spite of her troubles, carried out her compact, and  sent to the Panama-Pacific Exposition at San Francisco, a  magnificent collection of paintings and sculpture. Many examples of  both were loaned from the Luxembourgh, and there were a number of  pieces of priceless sculpture by Rodin, your great sculptor, whose  work is famous the world over. The exhibit also contained many  notable examples of work by other French and Belgian artists. After  the exhibition closed we were fortunate enough to have the  collection exhibited at my home, Youngstown, Ohio, for a period of  thirty days, under the auspices of The Mahoning Institute of Art.  We were told that some of the examples were for sale, and if sold,  the proceeds would help the artists, and assist in the great work  being carried on to aid the hospitals of"]]]
