The forces and powers necessary for this world were bestowed  upon him in that limited condition. In this world he needed eyes; he  received them potentially in the other. He needed ears; he obtained them  there in readiness and preparation for his new existence. The powers  requisite in this world were conferred upon him in the world of the  matrix, so that when he entered this realm of real existence he not only  possessed all necessary functions and powers but found provision for his  material sustenance awaiting him.    Therefore in this world he must prepare himself for the life beyond. That  which he needs in the world of the Kingdom must be obtained here. Just as  he prepared himself in the world of the matrix by acquiring forces  necessary in this sphere of existence, so likewise the indispensable  forces of the divine existence must be potentially attained in this world.    What is he in need of in the Kingdom which transcends the life and  limitation of this mortal sphere? That world beyond is a world of sanctity  and radiance; therefore it is necessary that in this world he should  acquire these divine attributes. In that world there is need of  spirituality, faith, assurance, the knowledge and love of God. These he  must attain in this world so that after his ascension from the earthly to  the heavenly Kingdom he shall find all that is needful in that life  eternal ready for him.    That divine world is manifestly a world of lights; therefore man has need  of illumination here. That is a world of love; the love of God is  essential. It is a world of perfections; virtues or perfections must be  acquired. That world is vivified by the breaths of the Holy Spirit; in  this world we must seek them. That is the Kingdom of life everlasting; it  must be attained during this vanishing existence.    By what means can man acquire these things? How shall he obtain these  merciful gifts and powers? First, through the knowledge of God. Second,  through the love of God. Third, through faith. Fourth, through  philanthropic deeds. Fifth, through self-sacrifice. Sixth, through  severance from this world. Seventh, through sanctity and holiness. Unless  he acquires these forces and attains to these requirements he will surely  be deprived of the life that is eternal. But if he possesses the knowledge  of God, becomes ignited through the fire of the love of God, witnesses the  great and mighty signs of the Kingdom, becomes the cause of love among  mankind, and lives in the utmost state of sanctity and holiness, he shall  surely attain to second birth, be baptized by the Holy Spirit and enjoy  everlasting existence.    Is it not astonishing that although man has been created for the knowledge  and love of God, for the virtues of the human world, for spirituality,  heavenly illumination and life eternal, nevertheless he continues ignorant  and negligent of all this? Consider how he seeks knowledge of everything  except knowledge of God. For instance, his utmost desire is to penetrate  the mysteries of the lowest strata of the earth. Day by day he strives to  know what can be found ten metres below the surface, what he can discover  within the stone, what he can learn by archaeological research in the  dust. He puts forth arduous labors to fathom terrestrial mysteries but is  not at all concerned about knowing the mysteries of the Kingdom,  traversing the illimitable fields of the eternal world, becoming informed  of the divine realities, discovering the secrets of God, attaining the  knowledge of God, witnessing the splendors of the Sun of Truth and  realizing the glories of everlasting life. He is unmindful and thoughtless  of these. How much he is attracted to the mysteries of matter and how  completely unaware he is of the mysteries of divinity! Nay, he is utterly  negligent and oblivious of the secrets of divinity. How great his  ignorance! How conducive to his degradation! It is as if a kind and loving  father had provided a library of wonderful books for his son in order that  he might be informed of the mysteries of creation; at the same time  surrounding him with every means of comfort and enjoyment; but the son  amuses himself with pebbles and playthings, neglectful of all his father's  gifts and provision. How ignorant and heedless is man! The Father has  willed for him glory eternal and he is content with blindness and  deprivation. The Father has built for him a royal palace but he is playing  with the dust; prepared for him garments of silk but he prefers to remain  unclothed; provided for him delicious foods and fruits while he seeks  sustenance in the grasses of the field.    Praise be to God! you have heard the call of the Kingdom. Your eyes are  opened; you have turned to God. Your purpose is the good-pleasure of God,  the understanding of the mysteries of the heart and investigation of the  realities. Day and night you must strive that you may attain to the  significances of the heavenly kingdom, perceive the signs of divinity,  acquire certainty of knowledge and realize that this world has a creator,  a vivifier, a provider, an architect,--knowing this through proofs and  evidences and not through susceptibilities,--nay, rather, through decisive  arguments and real vision; that is to say, visualizing it as clearly as  the outer eye beholds the sun. In this way may you behold the presence of  God and attain to the knowledge of the holy, divine Manifestations.            ETERNAL UNITY      What is real unity? When we observe the human world we find various  collective expressions of unity therein. For instance, man is  distinguished from the animal by his degree or kingdom. This comprehensive  distinction includes all the posterity of Adam and constitutes one great  household or human family which may be considered the fundamental or  physical unity of mankind. Furthermore, a distinction exists between  various groups of humankind according to lineage, each group forming a  racial unity separate from the others. There is also the unity of tongue  among those who use the same language as a means of communication;  national unity where various peoples live under one form of government  such as French, German, British, etc.; and political unity which conserves  the civil rights of parties or factions of the same government. All these  unities are imaginary and without real foundation, for no real result  proceeds from them. The purpose of true unity is real and divine outcomes.  From these limited unities mentioned only limited outcomes proceed whereas  unlimited unity produces unlimited result. For instance, from the limited  unity of race or nationality the results at most are limited. It is like a  family living alone and solitary; there are no unlimited or universal  outcomes from it.    The unity which is productive of unlimited results is first a unity of  mankind which recognizes that all are sheltered beneath the overshadowing  glory of the All-Glorious; that all are servants of one God; for all  breathe the same atmosphere, live upon the same earth, move beneath the  same heavens, receive effulgence from the same sun and are under the  protection of one God. This is the most great unity, and its results are  lasting if humanity adheres to it; but mankind has hitherto violated it,  adhering to sectarian or other limited unities such as racial, patriotic  or unity of self-interests; therefore no great results have been  forthcoming. Nevertheless it is certain that the radiance and favors of  God are encompassing, minds have developed, perceptions have become acute,  sciences and arts are widespread and capacity exists for the proclamation  and promulgation of the real and ultimate unity of mankind which will  bring forth marvelous results. It will reconcile all religions, make  warring nations loving, cause hostile kings to become friendly and bring  peace and happiness to the human world. It will cement together the Orient  and Occident, remove forever the foundations of war and upraise the ensign  of the \"Most Great Peace\". These limited unities are therefore signs of  that great unity which will make all the human family one by being  productive of the attractions of conscience in mankind.    Another unity is the spiritual unity which emanates from the breaths of  the Holy Spirit. This is greater than the unity of mankind. Human unity or  solidarity may be likened to the body whereas unity from the breaths of  the Holy Spirit is the spirit animating the body. This is a perfect unity.  It creates such a condition in mankind that each one will make sacrifices  for the other and the utmost desire will be to forfeit life and all that  pertains to it in behalf of another's good. This is the unity which  existed among the disciples of His Holiness Jesus Christ and bound  together the prophets and holy souls of the past. It is the unity which  through the influence of the divine spirit is permeating the Baha'is so  that each offers his life for the other and strives with all sincerity to  attain his good-pleasure. This is the unity which caused twenty thousand  people in Persia to give their lives in love and devotion to it. It made  the Bab the target of a thousand arrows and caused Baha'u'llah to suffer  exile and imprisonment forty years. This unity is the very spirit of the  body of the world. It is impossible for the body of the world to become  quickened with life without its vivification. His Holiness Jesus  Christ--may my life be a sacrifice to him!--promulgated this unity among  mankind. Every soul who believed in Jesus Christ became revivified and  resuscitated through this spirit, attained to the zenith of eternal glory,  realized the life everlasting, experienced the second birth and rose to  the acme of good fortune.    In the Word of God there is still another unity, the oneness of the  Manifestations of God, His Holiness Abraham, Moses, Jesus Christ,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19239"],[0,"Bahá'í World Faith (#15)"],[1,"foundation  of the divine religions is ever the cause of development and progress,  whereas the abandonment and beclouding of that essential reality through  blind imitations and adherence to dogmatic beliefs is the cause of a  nation's debasement and degradation. After their conquest by the  Babylonians, the Jews were successively subjugated by the Greeks and  Romans. Under the Roman general Titus, 70 A.D., the Holy Land was stripped  and pillaged, Jerusalem razed to its foundations and the Israelites  scattered broadcast throughout the world. So complete was their dispersion  that they have continued without a country and government of their own to  the present day.    From this review of the history of the Jewish people we learn that the  foundation of the religion of God laid by His Holiness Moses was the cause  of their eternal honor and national prestige, the animating impulse of  their advancement and racial supremacy and the source of that excellence  which will always command the respect and reverence of those who  understand their peculiar destiny and outcome. The dogmas and blind  imitations which gradually obscured the reality of the religion of God  proved to be Israel's destructive influences causing the expulsion of  these chosen people from the Holy Land of their Covenant and promise.    What then is the mission of the divine prophets? Their mission is the  education and advancement of the world of humanity. They are the real  teachers and educators, the universal instructors of mankind. If we wish  to discover whether any one of these great souls or messengers was in  reality a prophet of God we must investigate the facts surrounding His  life and history; and the first point of our investigation will be the  education He bestowed upon mankind. If He has been an educator, if He has  really trained a nation or people, causing it to rise from the lowest  depths of ignorance to the highest station of knowledge, then we are sure  that He was a prophet. This is a plain and clear method of procedure,  proof that is irrefutable. We do not need to seek after other proofs. We  do not need to mention miracles, saying that out of rock water gushed  forth, for such miracles and statements may be denied and refused by those  who hear them. The deeds of Moses are conclusive evidences of His  prophethood. If a man be fair, unbiased and willing to investigate reality  he will undoubtedly testify to the fact that Moses was verily a man of God  and a great personage.    In further consideration of this subject, I wish you to be fair and  reasonable in your judgment, setting aside all religious prejudices. We  should earnestly seek and thoroughly investigate realities, recognizing  that the purpose of the religion of God is the education of humanity and  the unity and fellowship of mankind. Furthermore we will establish the  point that the foundations of the religions of God are one foundation.  This foundation is not multiple for it is reality itself. Reality does not  admit of multiplicity although each of the divine religions is separable  into two divisions. One concerns the world of morality and the ethical  training of human nature. It is directed to the advancement of the world  of humanity in general; it reveals and inculcates the knowledge of God and  makes possible the discovery of the verities of life. This is ideal and  spiritual teaching, the essential quality of divine religion and not  subject to change or transformation. It is the one foundation of all the  religions of God. Therefore the religions are essentially one and the  same.    The second classification or division comprises social laws and  regulations applicable to human conduct. This is not the essential  spiritual quality of religion. It is subject to change and transformation  according to the exigencies and requirements of time and place. For  instance in the time of Noah certain requirements made it necessary that  all sea foods be allowable or lawful. During the time of the Abrahamic  prophethood it was considered allowable because of a certain exigency that  a man should marry his aunt, even as Sarah was the sister of Abraham's  mother. During the cycle of Adam it was lawful and expedient for a man to  marry his own sister, even as Abel, Cain and Seth the sons of Adam married  their sisters. But in the law of the Pentateuch revealed by Moses these  marriages were forbidden and their custom and sanction abrogated. Other  laws formerly valid were annulled during the time of Moses. For example,  it was lawful in Abraham's cycle to eat the flesh of the camel, but during  the time of Jacob this was prohibited. Such changes and transformations in  the teaching of religion are applicable to the ordinary conditions of life  but they are not important or essential. His Holiness Moses lived in the  wilderness of Sinai where crime necessitated direct punishment. There were  no penitentiaries or penalties of imprisonment. Therefore according to the  exigency of the time and place it was a law of God that an eye should be  given for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. It would not be practicable to  enforce this law at the present time; for instance to blind a man who  accidentally blinded you. In the Torah there are many commands concerning  the punishment of a murderer. It would not be allowable or possible to  carry out these ordinances today. Human conditions and exigencies are such  that even the question of capital punishment,--the one penalty which most  nations have continued to enforce for murder,--is now under discussion by  wise men who are debating its advisability. In fact, laws for the ordinary  conditions of life are only valid temporarily. The exigencies of the time  of Moses justified cutting off a man's hand for theft but such a penalty  is not allowable now. Time changes conditions, and laws change to suit  conditions. We must remember that these changing laws are not the  essentials; they are the accidentals of religion. The essential ordinances  established by a Manifestation of God are spiritual; they concern  moralities, the ethical development of man and faith in God. They are  ideal and necessarily permanent; expressions of the one foundation and not  amenable to change or transformation. Therefore the fundamental basis of  the revealed religion of God is immutable, unchanging throughout the  centuries, not subject to the varying conditions of the human world.    Christ ratified and proclaimed the foundation of the law of Moses.  Muhammad and all the prophets have revoiced that same foundation of  reality. Therefore the purposes and accomplishments of the divine  messengers have been one and the same. They were the source of advancement  to the body-politic and the cause of the honor and divine civilization of  humanity the foundation of which is one and the same in every  dispensation. It is evident then that the proofs of the validity and  inspiration of a prophet of God are the deeds of beneficent accomplishment  and greatness emanating from Him. If He proves to be instrumental in the  elevation and betterment of mankind, He is undoubtedly a valid and  heavenly messenger.    I wish you to be reasonable and just in your consideration of the  following statements:    At the time when the Israelites had been dispersed by the power of the  Roman empire and the national life of the Hebrew people had been effaced  by their conquerors,--when the law of God had seemingly passed from them  and the foundation of the religion of God was apparently destroyed,--Jesus  Christ appeared. When His Holiness arose among the Jews, the first thing  He did was to proclaim the validity of the Manifestation of Moses. He  declared that the Torah, the Old Testament, was the Book of God and that  all the prophets of Israel were valid and true. He extolled the mission of  Moses and through His proclamation the name of Moses was spread throughout  the world. Through Christianity the greatness of Moses became known among  all nations. It is a fact that before the appearance of Christ, the name  of Moses had not been heard in Iran. In India they had no knowledge of  Judaism and it was only through the Christianizing of Europe that the  teachings of the Old Testament became spread in that region. Throughout  Europe there was not a copy of the Old Testament; but consider this  carefully and judge it aright;--through the instrumentality of Christ,  through the translation of the New Testament, the little volume of the  Gospel, the Old Testament, the Torah, has been translated into six hundred  languages and spread everywhere in the world. The names of the Hebrew  prophets became household words among the nations, who believed that the  children of Israel were verily the chosen people of God, a holy nation  under the especial blessing and protection of God, and that therefore the  prophets who had arisen in Israel were the day springs of revelation and  brilliant stars in the heaven of the will of God.    Therefore His Holiness Christ really promulgated Judaism for He was a Jew  and not opposed to the Jews. He did not deny the prophethood of Moses; on  the contrary He proclaimed and ratified it. He did not invalidate the  Torah; He spread its teachings. That portion of the ordinances of Moses  which concerned transactions and unimportant conditions underwent  transformation but the essential teachings of Moses were revoiced and  confirmed by Christ without change. He left nothing unfinished or  incomplete. Likewise through the supreme efficacy and power of the Word of  God He united most of the nations of the east and the west. This was  accomplished at a time when these nations were opposed to each other in  hostility and strife. He led them beneath the overshadowing tent of the  oneness of humanity. He educated them until they became united and agreed  and through His spirit of conciliation the Roman, Greek, Chaldean and  Egyptian were blended in"]]]
