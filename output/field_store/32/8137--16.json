He feels that the law has no score against him. He'll go quietly.\"    \"And we'll find ways of fightin' the law?\"    \"Yes, but it needs money.\"    \"I've got a stake.\"    \"God bless you, Buck.\"    \"Take my advice.\"    \"What?\"    \"Let him go now.\"    She glanced at him wildly.    \"Kate, he's gone already.\"    \"No, no, no!\"    \"I say he's gone. Look at his eyes.\"    \"I don't dare.\"    \"The yaller is comin' up in 'em. He's wild again.\" She shook her head in  mute agony. Buck Daniels groaned, softly.    \"Then they's goin' to be a small-sized hell started around this cabin  before mornin'.\"    He got up and went slowly back towards the fire. Lee Haines was talking  steadily, leisurely, going round and round his subject again and again,  and Barry listened with bowed head, but his eyes were fixed upon those  of the wolf-dog at his feet. When he grew restless, Haines chained him  to the chair with some direct question, yet it was a hard game to play.  All this time the posse might be gathering around the cabin; and the  forehead of Haines whitened and glistened with sweat. His voice was the  only living thing in the cabin, after a time, sketching his imaginary  plans for the benefit of Barry--his voice and the wistful eyes of Joan  which kept steadily on Daddy Dan. Something has come between them and  lifted a barrier which she could not understand, and with all her aching  child's heart she wondered at it.    For the second time that evening the wolf stood up on the hearth, but  he was not yet on his feet before Dan was out of his chair and standing  close to the wall, where the shadows swallowed him. Lee Haines sat with  his lips frozen on the next unspoken word. Two shadows, whose feet made  no sound, Black Bart and Dan glided to the door and peered into the  night--then Barry went back, step by step, until his back was once more  to the wall. Not until that instant did the others hear. It was a step  which approached behind the house; a loud rap at the back door.    It was the very loudness of the knock which made Kate draw a breath of  relief; if it had been a stealthy tap she would have screamed. He who  rapped did not wait for an answer; they heard the door creak open, the  sound of a heavy man's step.    \"It's Vic,\" said Dan quietly, and then the door opened which led into  the kitchen and the tall form of Gregg entered. He paused there.    \"Here I am again, ma'am.\"    \"Good evening,\" she answered faintly.    He cleared his throat, embarrassed.    \"Darned if I didn't play a fool game today--hello, Dan.\"    The other nodded.    \"Rode in a plumb circle and come back where I started.\" He laughed, and  the laughter broke off a little shortly. He stepped to the wall and  hung up his bridle on its peg, which is the immemorial manner of asking  hospitality in the mountain-desert. \"Hope I ain't puttin' you out, Kate.  I see you got company.\"    She started, recalled from her thoughts.    \"Excuse me, Vic. Vic Gregg, Buck Daniels, Lee Haines.\"    They shook hands, and Vic detained Haines a moment.    \"Seems to me I've heard of you, Haines.\"    \"Maybe.\"    Gregg looked at the big man narrowly, and then swung back towards Dan.  He knew many things, now. Lee Haines--yes, that was the name. One of the  crew who followed Jim Silent; and Dan Barry? What a fool he had been not  to remember! It was Dan Barry who had gone on the trail of Silent's gang  and hounded it to death; Lee Haines alone had been spared. Yes, half a  dozen years before the mountain-folk had heard that story, a wild and  improbable one. It fitted in with what Pete Glass had told him of the  shooting of Harry Fisher; it explained a great deal which had mystified  him since he first met Barry; it made the thing he had come to do at  once easier and harder.    \"I s'pose Molly showed a clean pair of heels to the whole lot of 'em?\"  he said to Dan.    \"She's dead.\"    \"Dead?\" His astonishment was well enough affected. \"God amighty, Dan,  not Grey Molly--my hoss?\"    \"Dead. I shot her.\"    Vic gasped. \"You?\"    \"They'd busted her leg. I put her out of pain.\"    Gregg dropped into a chair. It was not altogether an affectation, not  altogether a piece of skilful acting now, for though the sheriff had  told him all that happened he had not had a chance to feel the truth;  but now it swept over him, all her tricks, all her deviltry, all that  long companionship. His head bowed.    No smile touched the faces of the others in the room, but a reverent  silence fell on the room. Then that figure among the shadows moved out,  stepped to the side of Vic, and a light hand rested on his shoulder. The  other looked up, haggard.    \"She's gone, partner,\" Dan said gently, \"but she's paid for.\"    \"Paid for? Dan, they ain't any money could pay me back for Grey Molly.\"    \"I know; I know! Not that way, but there was a life given for a life.\"    \"Eh?\"    \"One man died for Molly.\"    As the meaning came home to Gregg he blinked, and then, looking up, he  found a change in the eyes of Barry, for they seemed to be lighted from  within coldly, and his glance went down to the very bottom of Vic's  soul, probing. It was only an instant, a thing of which Gregg could not  make sure, and then Dan slipped back into his place among the shadows by  the wall. But a chill sense of guilt, a premonition of danger, stayed in  Gregg. The palms of his hands grew moist.        Chapter XV. Seven For One    Dangerous men were no novelty for Gregg. He had lived with them, worked  with them, as hard-fisted himself as any, and as ready for trouble, but  the man of the mountain-desert has a peculiar dread for the practiced,  known gun-fighter. In the days of the rapier when the art of fence grew  so complicated that half a life was needed for its mastery, men would as  soon commit suicide as ruffle it with an assured duellist; and the man  of the mountain-desert has a similar respect for those who are born, it  might be said, gun in hand. There was ample reason for the prickling in  his scalp, Vic felt, for here he sat on an errand of consummate danger  with three of these deadly fighters. Two of them he knew by name and  repute, however dimly, and as for Buck Daniels, unless all signs failed  the dark, sharp-eyed fellow was hardly less grim than the others. Vic  gauged the three one by one. Daniels might be dreaded for an outburst  of wild temper and in that moment he could be as terrible as any. Lee  Haines would fight coolly, his blue eyes never clouded by passion, for  that was his repute as the right hand man of Jim Silent, in the days  when Jim had been a terrible, half-legendary figure. One felt that same  quiet strength as the tawny haired man talked to Barry now; his voice  was a smooth, deep current. But as for Barry himself, Gregg could not  compute the factors which entered into the man. By all outward seeming  that slender, half-timid figure was not a tithe of the force which  either of the others represented, but out of the past Gregg's memory  gathered more and more details, clear and clearer, of the wolf-dog,  the black stallion, and the whistling man who tracked down  Silent--\"Whistling Dan\" Barry; that was what they called him, sometimes.  Nothing was definite in the mind of Gregg. The stories consisted of  patched details, heard here and there at third or fourth hand, but he  remembered one epic incident in which Barry had ridden, so rumor told,  into the very heart of Elkhead, taken from the jail this very man, this  Lee Haines, and carried him through the cordon of every armed man in  Elkhead. And there was another picture, dimmer still, which an eye  witness had painted: of how, at an appointed hour, Barry met Jim Silent  and killed him.    Out of these thoughts he glanced again at the man in the shadow, half  expecting to find his host swollen to giant size. Instead, he found the  same meager form, the same old suggestion of youth which would not age,  the same pale hands, of almost feminine litheness. Lee Haines talked  on--about a porphyry dyke somewhere to the north--a ledge to be found in  the space of ten thousand square miles--a list of vague clues--an appeal  for Barry to help them find it--and Barry was held listening though ever  seeming to drift, or about to drift, towards the door. Black Bart lay  facing his master, and his snaky head followed every movement. Kate  sat where the firelight barely touched on her, and in her arms she held  Joan, whose face and great bright eyes were turned towards Daddy Dan.  All things in the room centered on the place where the man sat by the  wall, and the sense of something impending swept over Gregg; then a wild  fear--did they know the danger outside? He must make conversation; he  turned to Kate, but at the same moment the voice of Buck Daniels beside  him, close.    \"I know how you feel, old man. I remember an old bay hoss of mine, a  Morgan hoss, and when he died I grieved for near onto a year, mostly. He  wasn't much of a hoss to look at, too long coupled, you'd say, and his  legs was short, but he got about like a coyote and when he sat down on  a rope you couldn't budge him with a team of Percherons. That's how good  he was! When he was a four year old I was cutting out yearlin's with  him, and how--\"    The loud, cheerful tone fell away to a confidential murmur, Daniels  leaned closer, with a smile of prospective humor, but the words which  came to Gregg were: \"Partner, if I was you I'd get up and git and I  wouldn't stop till I put a hell of a long ways between me and this  cabin!\"    It spoke well of Vic's nerve that no start betrayed him. He bowed his  head a little, as though"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18993"],[0,"History  of the World War: An Authentic Narrative of the World's Greatest War (#15)"],[1,"it by  airplane reconnoissance; and as a result of this I determined to effect  a retirement to the Maubeuge position at daybreak on the 24th.    \"A certain amount of fighting continued along the whole line throughout  the night and at daybreak on the 24th the Second Division from the  neighborhood of Harmignies made a powerful demonstration as if to retake  Binche. This was supported by the artillery of both the First and Second  Divisions, while the First Division took up a supporting position in the  neighborhood of Peissant. Under cover of this demonstration the Second  Corps retired on the line Dour-Quarouble-Frameries. The Third Division  on the right of the corps suffered considerable loss in this operation  from the enemy, who had retaken Mons.    \"The Second Corps halted on this line, where they partially intrenched  themselves, enabling Sir Douglas Haig with the First Corps gradually to  withdraw to the new position; and he effected this without much further  loss, reaching the line Bavai-Maubeuge about 7 P. M. Toward midday the  enemy appeared to be directing his principal effort against our left.    \"I had previously ordered General Allenby with the cavalry to act  vigorously in advance of my left front and endeavor to take the pressure  off.    \"About 7.30 A. M. General Allenby received a message from Sir Charles  Ferguson, commanding the Fifth Division, saying that he was very hard  pressed and in urgent need of support. On receipt of this message  General Allenby drew in the cavalry and endeavored to bring direct  support to the Fifth Division.    \"During the course of this operation General De Lisle, of the Second  Cavalry Brigade, thought he saw a good opportunity to paralyze the  further advance of the enemy's infantry by making a mounted attack on  his flank. He formed up and advanced for this purpose, but was held up  by wire about five hundred yards from his objective, and the Ninth  Lancers and the Eighteenth Hussars suffered severely in the retirement  of the brigade.    \"The Nineteenth Infantry Brigade, which had been guarding the line of  communications, was brought up by rail to Valenciennes on the 22d and  23d. On the morning of the 24th they were moved out to a position south  of Quarouble to support the left flank of the Second Corps.    \"With the assistance of the cavalry Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien was enabled  to effect his retreat to a new position; although, having two corps of  the enemy on his front and one threatening his flank, he suffered great  losses in doing so.    \"At nightfall the position was occupied by the Second Corps to the west  of Bavai, the First Corps to the right. The right was protected by the  Fortress of Maubeuge, the left by the Nineteenth Brigade in position  between Jenlain and Bry, and the cavalry on the outer flank.    \"4. The French were still retiring, and I had no support except such as  was afforded by the Fortress of Maubeuge; and the determined attempts of  the enemy to get round my left flank assured me that it was his  intention to hem me against that place and surround me. I felt that not  a moment must be lost in retiring to another position.    \"I had every reason to believe that the enemy's forces were somewhat  exhausted and I knew that they had suffered heavy losses. I hoped,  therefore, that his pursuit would not be too vigorous to prevent me  effecting my object.    \"The operation, however, was full of danger and difficulty, not only  owing to the very superior force in my front, but also to the exhaustion  of the troops.    \"The retirement was recommenced in the early morning of the 25th to a  position in the neighborhood of Le Cateau, and rearguards were ordered  to be clear of the Maubeuge-Bavai-Eih Road by 5.30 A. M.    \"Two cavalry brigades, with the divisional cavalry of the Second Corps,  covered the movement of the Second Corps. The remainder of the cavalry  division, with the Nineteenth Brigade, the whole under the command of  General Allenby, covered the west flank.    \"The Fourth Division commenced its detrainment at Le Cateau on Sunday,  the 23d, and by the morning of the 25th eleven battalions and a brigade  of artillery with divisional staff were available for service.    \"I ordered General Snow to move out to take up a position with his right  south of Solesmes, his left resting on the Cambrai-LeCateau Road south  of La Chaprie. In this position the division tendered great help to the  effective retirement of the Second and First Corps to the new position.    \"Although the troops had been ordered to occupy the Cambrai-Le  Cateau-Landrecies position, and the ground had, during the 25th, been  partially prepared and intrenched, I had grave doubts, owing to the  information I had received as to the accumulating strength of the enemy  against me--as to the wisdom of standing there to fight.    \"Having regard to the continued retirement of the French on my right, my  exposed left flank, the tendency of the enemy's western corps (II) to  envelop me, and, more than all, the exhausted condition of the troops, I  determined to make a great effort to continue the retreat until I could  put some substantial obstacle, such as the Somme or the Oise, between my  troops and the enemy, and afford the former some opportunity of rest and  reorganization. Orders were, therefore, sent to the corps commanders to  continue their retreat as soon as they possibly could toward the general  line Vermand-St. Quentin-Ribemont.    \"The cavalry under General Allenby, were ordered to cover the  retirement.    \"Throughout the 25th and far into the evening, the First Corps continued  its march on Landrecies, following the road along the eastern border of  the Foret de Mormal, and arrived at Landrecies about 10 o'clock. I had  intended that the corps should come further west so as to fill up the  gap between Le Cateau and Landrecies, but the men were exhausted and  could not get further in without rest.    \"The enemy, however, would not allow them this rest, and about 9.30 P.  M. a report was received that the Fourth Guards Brigade in Landrecies  was heavily attacked by troops of the Ninth German Army Corps, who were  coming through the forest on the north of the town. This brigade fought  most gallantly, and caused the enemy to suffer tremendous loss in  issuing from the forest into the narrow streets of the town. This loss  has been estimated from reliable sources at from 700 to 1,000. At the  same time information reached me from Sir Douglas Haig that his First  Division was also heavily engaged south and east of Maroilles. I sent  urgent messages to the commander of the two French reserve divisions on  my right to come up to the assistance of the First Corps, which they  eventually did. Partly owing to this assistance, but mainly to the  skilful manner in which Sir Douglas Haig extricated his corps from an  exceptionally difficult position in the darkness of the night, they were  able at dawn to resume their march south toward Wassigny on Guise.    \"By about 6 P. M. the Second Corps had got into position with their  right on Le Cateau, their left in the neighborhood of Caudry, and the  line of defense was continued thence by the Fourth Division toward  Seranvillers, the left being thrown back.    \"During the fighting on the 24th and 25th the cavalry became a good deal  scattered, but by the early morning of the 26th, General Allenby had  succeeded in concentrating two brigades to the south of Cambrai.    \"The Fourth Division was placed under the orders of the general officer  commanding the Second Army Corps.    \"On the 24th the French Cavalry Corps, consisting of three divisions  under General Sordet, had been in billets north of Avesnes. On my way  back from Bavai, which was my 'Poste de Commandement' during the  fighting of the 23d and 24th, I visited General Sordet, and earnestly  requested his co-operation and support. He promised to obtain sanction  from his army commander to act on my left flank, but said that his  horses were too tired to move before the next day. Although he rendered  me valuable assistance later on in the course of the retirement, he was  unable, for the reasons given, to afford me any support on the most  critical day of all, viz., the 26th.    \"At daybreak it became apparent that the enemy was throwing the bulk of  his strength against the left of the position occupied by the Second  Corps and the Fourth Division.    \"At this time the guns of four German army corps were in position  against them, and Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien reported to me that he judged  it impossible to continue his retirement at daybreak (as ordered) in  face of such an attack.    \"I sent him orders to use his utmost endeavors to break off the action  and retire at the earliest possible moment, as it was impossible for me  to send him any support, the First Corps being at the moment incapable  of movement.    \"The French Cavalry Corps, under General Sordet, was coming up on our  left rear early in the morning, and I sent an urgent message to him to  do his utmost to come up and support the retirement of my left flank;  but owing to the fatigue of his horses he found himself unable to  intervene in any way.    \"There had been no time to intrench the position properly, but the  troops showed a magnificent front to the terrible fire which confronted  them.    \"The artillery, although outmatched by at least four to one, made a  splendid fight, and inflicted heavy losses on their opponents.    \"At length it became apparent that, if complete annihilation was to be  avoided, a retirement must be attempted; and the order was given to  commence it about 3.30 P. M. The movement was covered with the most  devoted intrepidity and determination by the artillery, which had itself  suffered heavily, and the fine work done by the cavalry in the further  retreat from the position assisted materially in the final completion of  this most difficult and dangerous"]]]
