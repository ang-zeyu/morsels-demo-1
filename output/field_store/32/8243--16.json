Scott, _The Pirate_ (time, William III.).      =Minna von Barnhelm.= A wealthy girl who is engaged to Major von Tellheim,  a Prussian soldier. He loses his fortune, is wounded and suspected of  dishonor, and from regard for Minna strives to break the engagement.  Everything is righted, and they marry.--G. E. Lessing.      =Minneha'ha= (\"_the laughing water_\"), daughter of the arrow-maker of  Daco'tah, and wife of Hiawatha. She was called Minnehaha from the  waterfall of that name between St. Anthony and Fort Snelling.        From the waterfall, he named her      Minnehaha, Laughing Water.        Longfellow, _Hiawatha_, iv. (1855).      =Minnesingers=, the Troubadours of Germany during the Hohenstaufen period  (1138-1294), minstrels who composed and sung short lyrical  poems--usually in praise of women or in celebration of the beauties of  nature--called _Minne_, or love songs. The names of nearly three hundred  of these poets have come down to us, including all classes of society,  the most famous being Dietmar von Aist, Ulrich von Lichenstein, Heinrich  von Frauenlob, and above all Walther von der Vogelweid (1168-1230).  Wolfram von Eschenbach, Gottfried von Strasburg, and Hartmann von der  Aue are also classed among the Minnesingers, but their principal fame  was won in the field of metrical romance.    [Asterism] The story runs that Vogelweid bequeathed his worldly all to a  Wurtzburg monastery upon condition that they should feed the doves at  noon every day upon his grave. The multiplying birds aroused the  avaricious alarm of the abbot, who forbade the daily distribution.       \"Time has long effaced the inscriptions        On the cloister's funeral stones,      And tradition only tells us        Where repose the poet's bones.      But around the vast cathedral        By sweet echoes mutiplied[TN-12]      Still the birds repeat the legend        And the name of Vogelweid.\"        H. W. Longfellow, _Walter von der Vogelweid_ 186-.      =Mino'na=, \"the soft blushing daughter of Torman,\" a Gaelic bard in the  _Songs of Selma_, one of the most famous portions of Macpherson's  _Ossian_.      =Minor= (_The_), a comedy by Samuel Foote (1760). Sir George Wealthy, \"the  minor,\" was the son of Sir William Wealthy, a retired merchant. He was  educated at a public school, sent to college, and finished his training  in Paris. His father, hearing of his extravagant habits, pretended to be  dead, and, assuming the guise of a German baron, employed several  persons to dodge the lad, some to be winners in his gambling, some to  lend money, some to cater to other follies, till he was apparently on  the brink of ruin. His uncle, Mr. Richard Wealthy, a City merchant,  wanted his daughter, Lucy, to marry a wealthy trader, and as she refused  to do so, he turned her out of doors. This young lady was brought to Sir  George as a _fille de joie_, but she touched his heart by her manifest  innocence, and he not only relieved her present necessities, but  removed her to an asylum where her \"innocent beauty would be guarded  from temptation, and her deluded innocence would be rescued from  infamy.\" The whole scheme now burst as a bubble. Sir George's father,  proud of his son, told him he was his father, and that his losses were  only fictitious; and the uncle, melted into a better mood, gave his  daughter to his nephew, and blessed the boy for rescuing his discarded  child.      =Minotti=, governor of Corinth, then under the power of the doge. In 1715  the city was stormed by the Turks; and during the siege one of the  magazines in the Turkish camp blew up, killing 600 men. Byron says it  was Minotti himself who fired the train, and that he perished in the  explosion.--Byron, _Siege of Corinth_ (1816).      =Minstrel= (_The_), an unfinished poem, in Spenserian metre, by James  Beattie. Its design was to trace the progress of a poetic genius, born  in a rude age, from the first dawn of fancy to the fullness of poetic  rapture. The first canto is descriptive of Edwin, the minstrel; canto  ii. is dull philosophy, and there, happily, the poem ends. It is a pity  it did not end with the first canto (1773-4).          And yet poor Edwin was no vulgar boy,          Deep thought oft seemed to fix his infant eye.        Dainties he heeded not, nor gaude, nor toy,          Save one short pipe of rudest minstrelsy;          Silent when sad, affectionate, tho' shy;        And now his look was most demurely sad;          And now he laughed aloud, though none knew why.        The neighbors stared and sighed, yet blessed the lad;      Some deemed him wondrous wise, and some believed him mad.        Canto i. 16.    _Minstrel_ (_Lay of the Last_). Ladye Margaret, \"the flower of Teviot,\"  was the daughter of Lord Walter Scott, of Branksome Hall. She loved  Baron Henry, of Cranstown; but between the two families a deadly feud  existed. One day the elfin page of Lord Cranstown inveigled the heir of  Branksome Hall (then a lad) into the woods, where he fell into the hands  of the English, who marched with 3000 men to Branksome Hall; but, being  told that Douglas was coming to the rescue with 10,000 men, the two  armies agreed to settle by single combat whether the lad should be given  up to the mother or be made King Edward's page. The two champions were  Sir Richard Musgrave (_English_) and Sir William Deloraine (_Scotch_).  The Scotch champion slew Sir Richard, and the boy was delivered to his  mother. It now turned out that Sir William Deloraine was Lord Cranstown,  who claimed and received the hand of Ladye Margaret as his reward.--Sir  W. Scott (1805).      =Minstrel of the Border=, Sir W. Scott; also called \"The Border Minstrel\"  (1771-1832).        My steps the Border Minstrel led.        Wordsworth, _Yarrow Revisited_.        Great Minstrel of the Border.

A favorite variety of this drink is compounded of  brandy, water, sugar, mint-leaves and pounded ice, and is called a  \"hail-storm.\"       \"The draught was delicious, and loud the acclaim,      'Though something seemed wanting for all to bewail;      But JULEPS the drink of immortals became      When Jove himself added a handful of hail.\"        Charles Fenno Hoffman, _Poems_ (1846).      =Mintz=, _alias_ Araminta Sophronia--the best cook and housemaid in  town--rules the Stackpole family with a rod of red-hot steel until the  son of the house defies her by marrying the head scholar in the Boston  Cooking School.--Augusta Larned, _Village Photographs_ (1887).      =Miol'ner= (3 _syl._), Thor's hammer.

He liked her, \"with all her  faults; nay, liked her for her faults, ... which were so natural that  (in his opinion) they became her.\"--W. Congreve, _The Way of the World_  (1700).

Though so sorely  clad and mounted, the maiden was \"a lady of great dignity and honor, but  scornful and proud.\" Many a wretch did languish for her through a long  life. Being summoned to Cupid's judgment hall, the sentence passed on  her was that she should \"ride on a mangy jade, accompanied by a fool,  till she had saved as many lovers as she had slain\" (canto 7). Mirabella  was also doomed to carry a leaky bottle, which she was to fill with  tears, and a torn wallet, which she was to fill with repentance: but her  tears and her repentance dropped out as fast as they were put in, and  were trampled under foot by Scorn (canto 8).--Spenser, _Fa[:e]ry Queen_,  vi. 6-8 (1596).

So every year when the gold of the flowers, which some people do not  know is gold at all but call pollen, is ready you will find the Merry  Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind very, very busy among the  flowers on the Green Meadows.  And this is the happiest time of all.          XIV    WHY HOOTY THE OWL DOES NOT PLAY ON THE GREEN MEADOWS    The Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind were having a  good-night game of tag down on the Green Meadows.  They were having  _such_ a jolly time while they waited for Old Mother West Wind and her  big bag to take them to their home behind the Purple Hills.  Jolly,  round, red Mr. Sun had already put his nightcap on.  Black shadows  crept softly out from the Purple Hills onto the Green Meadows.  The  Merry Little Breezes grew sleepy, almost too sleepy to play, for Old  Mother West Wind was very, very late.    Farther and farther and farther out onto the Green Meadows crept the  black shadows.  Suddenly one seemed to separate from the others.  Softly, oh so softly, yet swiftly, it floated over towards the Merry  Little Breezes.  One of them happened to look up and saw it coming.  It  was the same Little Breeze who one time stayed out all night.  When he  looked up and saw this seeming shadow moving so swiftly he knew that it  was no shadow at all.    \"Here comes Hooty the Owl,\" cried the Little Breeze.    Then all the Merry Little Breezes stopped their game of tag to look at  Hooty the Owl.  It is seldom they have a chance to see him, for usually  Hooty the Owl does not come out on the Green Meadows until after the  Merry Little Breezes are snugly tucked in bed behind the Purple Hills.    \"Perhaps Hooty the Owl will tell us why it is that he never comes out  to play with us,\" said one of the Little Breezes.    But just as Hooty the Owl floated over to them up came Old Mother West  Wind, and she was in a great hurry, for she was late, and she was  tired.  She had had a busy day, a very busy day indeed, hunting for a  rain cloud which had gone astray.  So now she just opened her big bag  and tumbled all the Merry Little Breezes into it as fast as she could  without giving them so much as a chance to say \"Good evening\" to Hooty  the Owl.  Then she took them off home behind the Purple Hills.    Of course the Merry Little Breezes were disappointed, very much  disappointed.  But they were also very sleepy, for they had played hard  all day.    \"Never mind,\" said one of them, drowsily, \"to-morrow we'll ask  Great-Grandfather Frog why it is that Hooty the Owl never comes out to  play with us on the Green Meadows.  He'll know.\"    The next morning Old Mother West Wind was late in coming down from the  Purple Hills.  When she finally did turn the Merry Little Breezes out  of her big bag onto the Green Meadows jolly, round, red Mr. Sun was  already quite high in the blue sky.  The Merry Little Breezes waited  just long enough to say \"Good-by\" to Old Mother West Wind, and then  started a mad race to see who could reach the Smiling Pool first.    There they found Great-Grandfather Frog sitting on his big green lily  pad as usual.  He was very contented with the world, was Grandfather  Frog, for fat green flies had been more foolish than usual that morning  and already he had all that he could safely tuck inside his white and  yellow waistcoat.    \"Good morning, Grandfather Frog,\" shouted the Merry Little Breezes.  \"Will you tell us why it is that Hooty the Owl never comes out to play  with us on the Green Meadows?\"    \"Chug-a-rum,\" said Great-Grandfather Frog, gruffly, \"how should I know?\"    You see, Grandfather Frog likes to be teased a little.    \"Oh, but you do know, for you are so old and so very wise,\" cried the  Merry Little Breezes all together.    Grandfather Frog smiled, for he likes to be thought very wise, and also  he was feeling very good, very good indeed that morning.    \"Chug-a-rum,\" said Grandfather Frog.  \"If you'll sit perfectly still  I'll tell you what I know about Hooty the Owl.  But remember, you must  sit perfectly still, _per-fect-ly_ still.\"    The Merry Little Breezes sighed, for it is the hardest thing in the  world for them to keep perfectly still unless they are asleep.  But  they promised that they would, and when they had settled down, each one  in the heart of a great white water lily, Grandfather Frog began:    \"Once upon a time, when the world was young, Hooty the Owl's  grandfather a thousand times removed used to fly about in daylight with  the other birds.  He was very big and very strong and very fierce, was  Mr. Owl.  He had great big claws and a hooked bill, just as Hooty the  Owl has now, and he was afraid of nothing and nobody.    \"Now when people are very big and very strong and afraid of nothing and  nobody they are very apt to care for nothing and nobody but themselves.  So it was with Mr. Owl.  Whatever he saw that he wanted he took, no  matter to whom it belonged, for there was no one to stop him.    \"As I have already told you, Mr. Owl was very big and very strong and  very fierce and he was a very great glutton.  It took a great many  little birds and little animals to satisfy his appetite.  But he didn't  stop there!  No, Sir, he didn't stop there!  He used to kill harmless  little meadow people just for the fun of killing, and because he could.  Every day he grew more savage.  Finally no one smaller than himself  dared stir on the Green Meadows when he was around.  The little birds  no longer sang.  The Fieldmice children no longer played among the  meadow grasses.  Those were sad days, very sad days indeed on the Green  Meadows,\" said Grandfather Frog, with a sigh.    \"At last old Mother Nature came to visit the Green Meadows and she soon  saw what a terrible state things were in.  No one came to meet her, for  you see no one dared to show himself for fear of fierce old Mr. Owl.    \"Now I have told you that Mr. Owl was afraid of nothing and nobody, but  this is not quite true, for he was afraid, very much afraid of old  Mother Nature.  When he saw her coming he was sitting on top of a tall  dead stump and he at once tried to look very meek and very innocent.    \"Old Mother Nature wasted no time.  'Where are all my little meadow  people and why do they not come to give me greeting?' demanded old  Mother Nature of Mr. Owl.    \"Mr. Owl bowed very low.  'I'm sure I don't know.  I think they must  all be taking a nap,' said he.    \"Now you can't fool old Mother Nature and it's of no use to try.  No,  Sir, you can't fool old Mother Nature.  She just looked at Mr. Owl and  she looked at the feathers and fur scattered about the foot of the dead  stump.  Mr. Owl stood first on one foot and then on the other.  He  tried to look old Mother Nature in the face, but he couldn't.  You see,  Mr. Owl had a guilty conscience and a guilty conscience never looks  anyone straight in the face.  He did wish that Mother Nature would say  something, did Mr. Owl.  But she didn't.  She just looked and looked  and looked and looked straight at Mr. Owl.  The longer she looked the  uneasier he got and the faster he shifted from one foot to the other.  Finally he shifted so fast that he seemed to be dancing on top of the  old stump.    \"Gradually, a few at a time, the little meadow people crept out from  their hiding places and formed a great circle around the old dead  stump.  With old Mother Nature there they felt sure that no harm could  come to them.  Then they began to laugh at the funny sight of fierce  old Mr. Owl hopping from one foot to the other on top of the old dead  stump.  It was the first laugh on the Green Meadows for a long, long,  long time.    \"Of course Mr. Owl saw them laughing at him, but he could think of  nothing but the sharp eyes of old Mother Nature boring straight through  him, and he danced faster than ever.  The faster he danced the funnier  he looked, and the funnier he looked the harder the little meadow  people laughed.    \"Finally old Mother Nature slowly raised a hand and pointed a long  forefinger at Mr. Owl.  All the little meadow people stopped laughing  to hear what she would say.    \"'Mr. Owl,' she began, 'I know and you know why none of my little  meadow people were here to give me greeting.  And this shall be your  punishment: From now on your eyes shall become so tender that they  cannot stand the light of day, so that hereafter you shall fly about  only after round, red Mr. Sun has gone to bed behind the Purple Hills.  No more shall my little people who play on the Green Meadows all the  day long have cause to fear you, for no more shall you see to do them  harm.'    \"When she ceased speaking all the little meadow people gave a great  shout, for they knew that it would be even as Mother Nature had said.  Then began such a frolic as the Green Meadows had not known for many a  long day.    \"But Mr. Owl flew slowly and with difficulty over to the darkest part  of the deep wood, for the light hurt his eyes dreadfully and he could  hardly see.  And as he flew the little birds flew around him in a great  cloud and plucked out his feathers and tormented him for he could not  see to harm them.\"    Grandfather Frog paused and looked dreamily across the Smiling Pool.  Suddenly he opened his big mouth and then closed it with a snap.  One  more foolish green fly had disappeared inside the white and yellow  waistcoat.    \"Chug-a-rum,\" said Grandfather Frog, \"those were sad days, sad days  indeed for Mr. Owl.  He couldn't hunt for his meals by day, for the  light blinded him.  At night he could see but little in the darkness.  So he got little to eat and he grew thinner and thinner and thinner  until he was but a shadow of his former self.  He was always hungry,  was Mr. Owl, always hungry.  No one was afraid of him"]]]
