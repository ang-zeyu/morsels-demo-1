I was he  who brought the beautiful Ghisola[1] to do the will of the  Marquis, how ever the shameful tale may be reported. And not the  only Bolognese do I weep here, nay, this place is so full of  them, that so many tongues are not now taught between Savena and  the Reno to say sipa; [2] and if of this thou wishest pledge or  testimony, bring to mind our avaricious heart.\" As he spoke thus  a demon struck him with his scourge and said, \"Begone, pandar,  here are no women for coining.\"    [1] His own sister; the unseemly tale is known only through Dante  and his fourteenth-century commentators, and the latter, while  agreeing that the Marquis was one of the Esti of Ferrara, do not  agree as to which of them he was.    [2] Bologna lies between the Savena and the Reno; sipa is the  Bolognese form of sia, or si.      I rejoined my Escort; then with few steps we came to where a crag  jutted from the bank.[1] Easily enough we ascended it, and  turning to the right[2] upon its ridge, from those eternal  circles we departed.    [1] Forming a bridge, thrown like an arch across the pit.    [2] The course of the Poets, which has mostly been to the left  through the upper Circles, is now generally to proceed straight  across the lower Circles where Fraud is punished. They had been  going to the left at the foot of the precipice, and consequently  turn to the right to ascend the bridge. The allegorical intention  in the direction of their course is evident.      When we were there where it opens below to give passage to the  scourged, the Leader said, \"Stop, and let the sight strike on  thee of these other miscreants, of whom thou hast not yet seen  the face, because they have gone along in the same direction with  us.\"    From the ancient bridge we looked at the train that was coining  toward us from the other side, and which the whip in like manner  drives on. The good Master, without my asking, said to me, \"Look  at that great one who is coming, and seems not to shed a tear for  pain. What royal aspect he still retains! He is Jason, who by  courage and by wit despoiled the Colchians of their ram. He  passed by the isle of Lemnos, after the undaunted women pitiless  had given all their males to death. There with tokens and with  ornate words he deceived Hypsipyle, the maiden, who first had  deceived all the rest. There he left her pregnant, and alone;  such sin condemns him to such torment; and also for Medea is  vengeance done. With him goes whoso in such wise deceives. And  let this suffice to know of the first valley, and of those that  it holds in its fangs.\"    Now we were where the narrow path sets across the second dyke,  and makes of it shoulders for another arch. Here we heard people  moaning in the next pit, and snorting with their muzzles, and  with their palms beating themselves. The banks were encrusted  with a mould because of the breath from below that sticks on  them, and was making quarrel with the eyes and with the nose. The  bottom is so hollowed out that no place sufficeth us for seeing  it, without mounting on the crest of the arch where the crag  rises highest. Hither we came, and thence, down in the ditch, I  saw people plunged in an excrement that seemed as if it proceeded  from human privies.    And while I am searching down there with my eye, I saw one with  his head so foul with ordure that it was not apparent whether he  were layman or clerk. He shouted to me, \"Why art so greedy to  look more at me than at the other filthy ones?\" And I to him,  \"Because, if I remember rightly, ere now I have seen thee with  dry hair, and thou art Alessio Interminei of Lucca[1]; therefore  I eye thee more than all the rest.\" And he then, beating his  pate, \"Down here those flatteries wherewith my tongue was never  cloyed have submerged me.\"    [1] Of him nothing is known but what these words tell.      Hereupon my Leader, \"Mind thou push thy sight a little farther  forward so that with thine eyes thou mayest quite reach the face  of that dirty and disheveled creature, who is scratching herself  there with her nasty nails, and now is crouching down and now  standing on foot. She is Thais the prostitute, who answered her  paramour when he said, 'Have I great thanks from thee?'--'Nay,  marvelous.'\" [1] And herewith let our sight be satisfied.    [1] These words are derived from Terence, Eunuchus, act iii. sc.  1.        CANTO XIX. Eighth Circle third pit: simonists.--Pope Nicholas  III.    Oh Simon Magus! Oh ye his wretched followers, who, rapacious, do  prostitute for gold and silver the things of God that ought to be  the brides of righteousness, now it behoves for you the trumpet  sound, since ye are in the third pit!    Already were we come to the next tomb,[1] mounted on that part of  the crag which just above the middle of the ditch hangs plumb. Oh  Supreme Wisdom, how great is the art that Thou displayest in  Heaven, on Earth, and in the Evil World! and how justly doth Thy  Power distribute!    [1] The next bolgia or pit.      I saw along the sides, and over the bottom, the livid stone full  of holes all of one size, and each was circular. They seemed to  me not less wide nor larger than those that in my beautiful Saint  John are made as place for the baptizers [1] one of which, not  many years ago, I broke for sake of one who was stifling in it;  and be this the seal to undeceive all men. Forth from the mouth  of each protruded the feet of a sinner, and his legs up to the  calf, and the rest was within. The soles of all were both on  fire, wherefore their joints quivered so violently that they  would have snapped withes and bands. As the flaming of things  oiled is wont to move only on the outer surface, so was it there  from the heels to the toes.    [1] \"My beautiful Saint John\" is the Baptistery at Florence. In  Dante's time the infants, born during the year, were all here  baptized by immersion, mostly on the day of St. John Baptist, the  24th of June. There was a large circular font in the middle of  the church, and around it in its marble wall were four  cylindrical standing-places for the priests, closed by doors, to  protect them from the pressure of the crowd.      \"Who is he, Master, that writhes, quivering more than the others  his consorts,\" said I, \"and whom a ruddier flame is sucking?\" And  he to me, \"If thou wilt that I carry thee down there by that bank  which slopes the most,[1] from him thou shalt know of himself and  of his wrongs.\" And I, \"Whatever pleaseth thee even so is good to  me. Thou art Lord, and knowest that I part me not from thy  will, and thou knowest that which is unspoken.\"    [1] The whole of the Eighth circle slopes toward the centre, so  that the inner wall of each bolgia is lower, and is less sharply  inclined than the outer.      Then we went upon the fourth dyke, turned, and descended on the  left hand, down to the bottom pierced with holes, and narrow. And  the good Master set me not down yet from his haunch, till he  brought me to the cleft of him who was thus lamenting with his  shanks.    \"O whoe'er thou art, that keepest upside down, sad soul, planted  like a stake,\" I began to say, \"speak, if thou canst.\" I was  standing like the friar who confesses the perfidious assassin,[1]  who, after he is fixed, recalls him, in order to delay his death.    [1] Such criminals were not infrequently punished by being set,  head downwards, in a hole in which they were buried alive.      And he[1] cried out, \"Art thou already standing there? Art thou  already standing there, Boniface? By several years the record  lied to me. Art thou so quickly sated with that having, for which  thou didst not fear to seize by guile the beautiful Lady,[2] and  then to do her outrage?\"    [1] This is Nicholas III., pope from 1277 to 1280; he takes Dante  to be Boniface VIII., but Boniface was not to die till 1303.  Compare what Nicholas says of \"the record\" with Farinata's  statement, in Canto X, concerning the foresight of the damned.    [2] The Church, to which Boniface did outrage in many forms;  but worst by his simoniacal practices.      Such I became as those that, not comprehending that which is  replied to them, stand as if mocked, and know not what to answer.    Then Virgil said, \"Tell him quickly, I am not he, I am not he  thou thinkest.\" And I answered as was enjoined on me; whereat the  spirit quite twisted his feet. Thereafter, sighing and with  tearful voice, he said to me, \"Then what dost thou require of me?  If to know who I am concerneth thee so much that thou hast  crossed the bank therefor, know that I was vested with the Great  Mantle; and verily I was a son of the She-Bear,[1] so eager to  advance the cubs, that up there I put wealth, and here myself,  into the purse. Beneath my head are stretched the others that  preceded me in simony, flattened through the fissures of the  rock. There below shall I likewise sink, when he shall come whom  I believed thou wert, then when I put to thee the sudden  question; but already the time is longer that I have cooked my  feet, and that I have been thus upside down, than he will stay  planted with red feet; for after him will come, of uglier deed,  from westward, a shepherd without law,[2] such as must cover him  and me again. A new Jason will he be, of whom it is read in  Maccabees;[3] and as to that one his king was compliant, so unto  this he who rules France shall be.\"[4]    [1] Nicholas was of the Orsini family.    [2] Clement V., who will come from Avignon, and in a little more  than ten years after the death of Boniface. Nicholas had already  \"cooked his feet\" for twenty years. The prophecy of the death of  Clement after a shorter time affords an indication that this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19950"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part III (Tertia Pars) (#15)"],[1,"of the Incarnation the wisdom and power of God are made  known: the wisdom, for He found a most suitable discharge for a most  heavy debt; the power, for He made the conquered conquer.\" But power  and wisdom are appropriated to the Son, according to 1 Cor. 1:24:  \"Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God.\" Therefore it was  fitting that the Person of the Son should become incarnate.    _I answer that,_ It was most fitting that the Person of the Son  should become incarnate. First, on the part of the union; for such as  are similar are fittingly united. Now the Person of the Son, Who is  the Word of God, has a certain common agreement with all creatures,  because the word of the craftsman, i.e. his concept, is an exemplar  likeness of whatever is made by him. Hence the Word of God, Who is  His eternal concept, is the exemplar likeness of all creatures. And  therefore as creatures are established in their proper species,  though movably, by the participation of this likeness, so by the  non-participated and personal union of the Word with a creature, it  was fitting that the creature should be restored in order to its  eternal and unchangeable perfection; for the craftsman by the  intelligible form of his art, whereby he fashioned his handiwork,  restores it when it has fallen into ruin. Moreover, He has a  particular agreement with human nature, since the Word is a concept  of the eternal Wisdom, from Whom all man's wisdom is derived. And  hence man is perfected in wisdom (which is his proper perfection, as  he is rational) by participating the Word of God, as the disciple is  instructed by receiving the word of his master. Hence it is said  (Ecclus. 1:5): \"The Word of God on high is the fountain of wisdom.\"  And hence for the consummate perfection of man it was fitting that  the very Word of God should be personally united to human nature.    Secondly, the reason of this fitness may be taken from the end of the  union, which is the fulfilling of predestination, i.e. of such as are  preordained to the heavenly inheritance, which is bestowed only on  sons, according to Rom. 8:17: \"If sons, heirs also.\" Hence it was  fitting that by Him Who is the natural Son, men should share this  likeness of sonship by adoption, as the Apostle says in the same  chapter (Rom. 8:29): \"For whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to  be made conformable to the image of His Son.\"    Thirdly, the reason for this fitness may be taken from the sin of our  first parent, for which the Incarnation supplied the remedy. For the  first man sinned by seeking knowledge, as is plain from the words of  the serpent, promising to man the knowledge of good and evil. Hence  it was fitting that by the Word of true knowledge man might be led  back to God, having wandered from God through an inordinate thirst  for knowledge.    Reply Obj. 1: There is nothing which human malice cannot abuse, since  it even abuses God's goodness, according to Rom. 2:4: \"Or despisest  thou the riches of His goodness?\" Hence, even if the Person of the  Father had become incarnate, men would have been capable of finding  an occasion of error, as though the Son were not able to restore  human nature.    Reply Obj. 2: The first creation of things was made by the power of  God the Father through the Word; hence the second creation ought to  have been brought about through the Word, by the power of God the  Father, in order that restoration should correspond to creation  according to 2 Cor. 5:19: \"For God indeed was in Christ reconciling  the world to Himself.\"    Reply Obj. 3: To be the gift of the Father and the Son is proper to  the Holy Ghost. But the remission of sins is caused by the Holy  Ghost, as by the gift of God. And hence it was more fitting to man's  justification that the Son should become incarnate, Whose gift the  Holy Ghost is.  _______________________    QUESTION 4    OF THE MODE OF UNION ON THE PART OF THE HUMAN NATURE  (In Six Articles)    We must now consider the union on the part of what was assumed. About  which we must consider first what things were assumed by the Word of  God; secondly, what were co-assumed, whether perfections or defects.    Now the Son of God assumed human nature and its parts. Hence a  threefold consideration arises. First, with regard to the nature;  secondly, with regard to its parts; thirdly, with regard to the order  of the assumption.    Under the first head there are six points of inquiry:    (1) Whether human nature was more capable of being assumed than any  other nature?    (2) Whether He assumed a person?    (3) Whether He assumed a man?    (4) Whether it was becoming that He should assume human nature  abstracted from all individuals?    (5) Whether it was becoming that He should assume human nature in all  its individuals?    (6) Whether it was becoming that He should assume human nature in any  man begotten of the stock of Adam?  _______________________    FIRST ARTICLE [III, Q. 4, Art. 1]    Whether Human Nature Was More Assumable by the Son of God Than Any  Other Nature?    Objection 1: It would seem that human nature is not more capable of  being assumed by the Son of God than any other nature. For Augustine  says (Ep. ad Volusianum cxxxvii): \"In deeds wrought miraculously the  whole reason of the deed is the power of the doer.\" Now the power of  God Who wrought the Incarnation, which is a most miraculous work, is  not limited to one nature, since the power of God is infinite.  Therefore human nature is not more capable of being assumed than any  other creature.    Obj. 2: Further, likeness is the foundation of the fittingness of the  Incarnation of the Divine Person, as above stated (Q. 3, A. 8). But  as in rational creatures we find the likeness of image, so in  irrational creatures we find the image of trace. Therefore the  irrational creature was as capable of assumption as human nature.    Obj. 3: Further, in the angelic nature we find a more perfect  likeness than in human nature, as Gregory says: (Hom. de Cent. Ovib.;  xxxiv in Ev.), where he introduces Ezech. 28:12: \"Thou wast the seal  of resemblance.\" And sin is found in angels, even as in man,  according to Job 4:18: \"And in His angels He found wickedness.\"  Therefore the angelic nature was as capable of assumption as the  nature of man.    Obj. 4: Further, since the highest perfection belongs to God, the  more like to God a thing is, the more perfect it is. But the whole  universe is more perfect than its parts, amongst which is human  nature. Therefore the whole universe is more capable of being assumed  than human nature.    _On the contrary,_ It is said (Prov. 8:31) by the mouth of Begotten  Wisdom: \"My delights were to be with the children of men\"; and hence  there would seem some fitness in the union of the Son of God with  human nature.    _I answer that,_ A thing is said to be assumable as being capable of  being assumed by a Divine Person, and this capability cannot be taken  with reference to the natural passive power, which does not extend to  what transcends the natural order, as the personal union of a  creature with God transcends it. Hence it follows that a thing is  said to be assumable according to some fitness for such a union. Now  this fitness in human nature may be taken from two things, viz.  according to its dignity, and according to its need. According to its  dignity, because human nature, as being rational and intellectual,  was made for attaining to the Word to some extent by its operation,  viz. by knowing and loving Him. According to its need--because it  stood in need of restoration, having fallen under original sin. Now  these two things belong to human nature alone. For in the irrational  creature the fitness of dignity is wanting, and in the angelic nature  the aforesaid fitness of need is wanting. Hence it follows that only  human nature was assumable.    Reply Obj. 1: Creatures are said to be \"such\" with reference to their  proper causes, not with reference to what belongs to them from their  first and universal causes; thus we call a disease incurable, not  that it cannot be cured by God, but that it cannot be cured by the  proper principles of the subject. Therefore a creature is said to be  not assumable, not as if we withdrew anything from the power of God,  but in order to show the condition of the creature, which has no  capability for this.    Reply Obj. 2: The likeness of image is found in human nature,  forasmuch as it is capable of God, viz. by attaining to Him through  its own operation of knowledge and love. But the likeness of trace  regards only a representation by Divine impression, existing in the  creature, and does not imply that the irrational creature, in which  such a likeness is, can attain to God by its own operation alone. For  what does not come up to the less, has no fitness for the greater; as  a body which is not fitted to be perfected by a sensitive soul is  much less fitted for an intellectual soul. Now much greater and more  perfect is the union with God in personal being than the union by  operation. And hence the irrational creature which falls short of the  union with God by operation has no fitness to be united with Him in  personal being.    Reply Obj. 3: Some say that angels are not assumable, since they are  perfect in their personality from the beginning of their creation,  inasmuch as they are not subject to generation and corruption; hence  they cannot be assumed to the unity of a Divine Person, unless their  personality be destroyed, and this does not befit the  incorruptibility of their nature nor the goodness of the one  assuming, to Whom it does not belong to corrupt any perfection in the  creature assumed. But this would not seem totally to disprove the  fitness of the angelic nature for being assumed. For God by producing  a new angelic nature could join it to Himself in unity of Person, and  in this way nothing pre-existing would be corrupted in it. But as"]]]
