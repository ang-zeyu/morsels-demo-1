Breakfast, dinner, and tea came up with  illusive regularity, and were all the most perfect of their kind; and we  laughed and feasted in our vain security. We had out from the city to  banquet with us the friends we loved, and we were inexpressibly proud  before them of the Help, who first wrought miracles of cookery in our  honor, and then appeared in a clean white apron, and the glossiest black  hair, to wait upon the table. She was young, and certainly very pretty;  she was as gay as a lark, and was courted by a young man whose clothes  would have been a credit, if they had not been a reproach, to our lowly  basement. She joyfully assented to the idea of staying with us till she  married.    In fact, there was much that was extremely pleasant about the little  place when the warm weather came, and it was not wonderful to us that  Jenny was willing to remain. It was very quiet; we called one another  to the window if a large dog went by our door; and whole days passed  without the movement of any wheels but the butcher's upon our street,  which flourished in ragweed and buttercups and daisies, and in the  autumn burned, like the borders of nearly all the streets in  Charlesbridge, with the pallid azure flame of the succory. The  neighborhood was in all things a frontier between city and country. The  horse-cars, the type of such civilization--full of imposture,  discomfort, and sublime possibility--as we yet possess, went by the head  of our street, and might, perhaps, be available to one skilled in  calculating the movements of comets; while two minutes' walk would take  us into a wood so wild and thick that no roof was visible through the  trees. We learned, like innocent pastoral people of the golden age, to  know the several voices of the cows pastured in the vacant lots, and,  like engine-drivers of the iron age, to distinguish the different  whistles of the locomotives passing on the neighboring railroad....    We played a little at gardening, of course, and planted tomatoes, which  the chickens seemed to like, for they ate them up as fast as they  ripened; and we watched with pride the growth of our Lawton  blackberries, which, after attaining the most stalwart proportions, were  still as bitter as the scrubbiest of their savage brethren, and which,  when by advice left on the vines for a week after they turned black,  were silently gorged by secret and gluttonous flocks of robins and  orioles. As for our grapes, the frost cut them off in the hour of their  triumph.    So, as I have hinted, we were not surprised that Jenny should be willing  to remain with us, and were as little prepared for her desertion as for  any other change of our mortal state. But one day in September she came  to her nominal mistress with tears in her beautiful eyes and  protestations of unexampled devotion upon her tongue, and said that she  was afraid she must leave us. She liked the place, and she never had  worked for any one that was more of a lady, but she had made up her mind  to go into the city. All this, so far, was quite in the manner of  domestics who, in ghost stories, give warning to the occupants of  haunted houses; and Jenny's mistress listened in suspense for the motive  of her desertion, expecting to hear no less than that it was something  which walked up and down the stairs and dragged iron links after it, or  something that came and groaned at the front door, like populace  dissatisfied with a political candidate. But it was in fact nothing of  this kind; simply, there were no lamps upon our street, and Jenny, after  spending Sunday evening with friends in East Charlesbridge, was always  alarmed, on her return, in walking from the horse-car to our door. The  case was hopeless, and Jenny and our household parted with respect and  regret.    We had not before this thought it a grave disadvantage that our street  was unlighted. Our street was not drained nor graded; no municipal cart  ever came to carry away our ashes; there was not a water-butt within  half a mile to save us from fire, nor more than the one-thousandth part  of a policeman to protect us from theft. Yet, as I paid a heavy tax, I  somehow felt that we enjoyed the benefits of city government, and never  looked upon Charlesbridge as in any way undesirable for residence. But  when it became necessary to find help in Jenny's place, the frosty  welcome given to application at the intelligence offices renewed a  painful doubt awakened by her departure. To be sure, the heads of the  offices were polite enough; but when the young housekeeper had stated  her case at the first to which she applied, and the Intelligencer had  called out to the invisible expectants in the adjoining room, \"Anny wan  wants to do giner'l housewark in Charlsbrudge?\" there came from the  maids invoked so loud, so fierce, so full a \"No!\" as shook the lady's  heart with an indescribable shame and dread. The name that, with an  innocent pride in its literary and historical associations, she had  written at the heads of her letters, was suddenly become a matter of  reproach to her; and she was almost tempted to conceal thereafter that  she lived in Charlesbridge, and to pretend that she dwelt upon some  wretched little street in Boston. \"You see,\" said the head of the  office, \"the gairls doesn't like to live so far away from the city. Now,  if it was on'y in the Port.\" ...    This pen is not graphic enough to give the remote reader an idea of the  affront offered to an inhabitant of Old Charlesbridge in these closing  words. Neither am I of sufficiently tragic mood to report here all the  sufferings undergone by an unhappy family in finding servants, or to  tell how the winter was passed with miserable makeshifts. Alas! is it  not the history of a thousand experiences? Any one who looks upon this  page could match it with a tale as full of heartbreak and disaster,  while I conceive that, in hastening to speak of Mrs. Johnson, I approach  a subject of unique interest....    I say, our last Irish girl went with the last snow, and on one of those  midsummer-like days that sometimes fall in early April to our yet bleak  and desolate zone, our hearts sang of Africa and golden joys. A Libyan  longing took us, and we would have chosen, if we could, to bear a strand  of grotesque beads, or a handful of brazen gauds, and traffic them for  some sable maid with crisp locks, whom, uncoffling from the captive  train beside the desert, we should make to do our general housework  forever, through the right of lawful purchase. But we knew that this  was impossible, and that, if we desired colored help, we must seek it at  the intelligence office, which is in one of those streets chiefly  inhabited by the orphaned children and grandchildren of slavery. To tell  the truth these orphans do not seem to grieve much for their  bereavement, but lead a life of joyous, and rather indolent oblivion in  their quarter of the city. They are often to be seen sauntering up and  down the street by which the Charlesbridge cars arrive,--the young with  a harmless swagger, and the old with the generic limp which our Autocrat  has already noted as attending advanced years in their race.... How  gayly are the young ladies of this race attired, as they trip up and  down the side-walks, and in and out through the pendent garments at the  shop-doors! They are the black pansies and marigolds and dark-blooded  dahlias among womankind. They try to assume something of our colder  race's demeanor, but even the passer on the horse-car can see that it is  not native with them, and is better pleased when they forget us, and  ungenteelly laugh in encountering friends, letting their white teeth  glitter through the generous lips that open to their ears. In the  streets branching upward from this avenue, very little colored men and  maids play with broken or enfeebled toys, or sport on the wooden  pavements of the entrances to the inner courts. Now and then a colored  soldier or sailor--looking strange in his uniform, even after the custom  of several years--emerges from those passages; or, more rarely, a black  gentleman, stricken in years, and cased in shining broadcloth, walks  solidly down the brick sidewalk, cane in hand,--a vision of serene  self-complacency, and so plainly the expression of virtuous public  sentiment that the great colored louts, innocent enough till then in  their idleness, are taken with a sudden sense of depravity, and loaf  guiltily up against the house-walls. At the same moment, perhaps, a  young damsel, amorously scuffling with an admirer through one of the low  open windows, suspends the strife, and bids him,--\"Go along now, do!\"  More rarely yet than the gentleman described, one may see a white girl  among the dark neighbors, whose frowsy head is uncovered, and whose  sleeves are rolled up to her elbows, and who, though no doubt quite at  home, looks as strange there as that pale anomaly which may sometimes be  seen among a crew of blackbirds.    An air not so much of decay as of unthrift, and yet hardly of unthrift,  seems to prevail in the neighborhood, which has none of the aggressive  and impudent squalor of an Irish quarter, and none of the surly  wickedness of a low American street. A gayety not born of the things  that bring its serious joy to the true New England heart--a ragged  gayety, which comes of summer in the blood, and not in the pocket or the  conscience, and which affects the countenance and the whole demeanor,  setting the feet to some inward music, and at times bursting into a line  of song or a child-like and irresponsible laugh--gives tone to the  visible life, and wakens a very friendly spirit in the passer, who  somehow thinks there of a milder climate, and is half persuaded that the  orange-peel on the side-walks came"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18477"],[0,"The Science of Human Nature (#15)"],[1,"hild's feelings in the service of his education, we must make the  school work vital and relate it, if possible, to the actual needs of the  child.    It must not be forgotten, however, that we must build up permanent  attitudes of respect for authority, obedience, and reverence for the  important things of life. Neither must it be forgotten that we can  create needs in the child. If in the education of the child we follow  only such needs as he has, we will make a fine savage of him but nothing  else. It is the business of the school to create in the child the right  kind of needs. As was pointed out in our study of the instincts, we  must make the child over again into what he ought to be. But this  cannot be a sudden process. One cannot arouse enthusiasm in a  six-year-old child over the beauties of higher mathematics. It takes ten  or fifteen years to do that, and it must be done little by little.    =Control of the Emotions.= Without training, we remain at the mercy of our  baser emotions. The child must be trained to control himself. Here is  where habit comes in to modify primitive action. The child can be  trained to inhibit or prevent the reactions that arise in hatred, envy,  jealousy, anger, etc. For a fuller discussion of this point we must wait  till we come to the discussion of habit and moral training.    =Mood and Temperament.= A mood is a somewhat extended emotional state  continuing for hours or days. It is due to a continuance of the factors  which cause it. The state of the liver and digestive organs may throw  one for days into a cross and ugly mood. When the body becomes normal,  the mood changes or disappears. Similarly, one may for hours or days be  overjoyed, or depressed, or morose, or melancholy. Parents and teachers  should look well to the matter of creating and establishing continuous  and permanent states of feeling that are favorable to work and  development.    Some people are permanently optimistic, others pessimistic. Some are  always joyful, others as constantly see only the dark side of life. Some  are always serious and solemn, others always gay, even giddy. These  permanent emotional attitudes constitute temperament, and are due to  fundamental differences within the body that are in some cases  hereditary. Crossness and moroseness, for example, may be due to a  dyspeptic condition and a chronically bad liver. The happy dispositions  belong to bodies whose organs are functioning properly, in which  assimilation is good--all the parts of the body doing their proper work.    Poor eyes which are under a constant strain, through the reflex effects  upon various organs of the body, are likely to develop a permanently  cross and irritable disposition. Through the close sympathetic relation  of the various organs, anything affecting one organ and interfering with  its proper action is likely to affect many other organs and profoundly  influence the emotional states of the body. In growing children  particularly, there are many influences which affect their emotions,  things of which we seldom think, such as the condition of vision and  hearing, the condition of the teeth, nose, and throat, and the condition  of all the important vital organs of the body. When a child's  disposition is not what we think it ought to be, we should try to find  out the causes.    =Training the Emotions.= The emotions are subject to training. The child  can be taught control. Moreover, he can be taught to appreciate and  enjoy higher things than mere animal pleasure; namely, art, literature,  nature, truth. The child thereby becomes a spiritual being instead of a  mere pig. The ideal of the school should be to develop men and women  whose baser passions are under control, who are calm, self-controlled,  and self-directed, and who get their greatest pleasure from the finer  and higher things of life, such as the various forms of music, the songs  of birds, the beauties and intricate workings of nature.    This is a wonderful world and a wonderful life, but the child may go  through the world without seeing it, and live his life without knowing  what it is to live. His eyes must be opened, he must be trained to see  and to feel. It is not the place here to tell how this is to be done.  This is not a book on methods of teaching. We can only indicate here  that the business of the school is not merely to teach people how to  make a living, but to teach them how to enjoy the living. There are many  avenues from which we get the higher forms of pleasure. There are really  many different worlds which we may experience: the world of animals, the  world of plants, the mechanical world, the chemical world, the world of  literature and of art, the world of music. It is the duty of the schools  to open up these worlds to the children, and make them so many  possibilities of joy and happiness.    The emotions and feelings, then, are not lawless and causeless, but are  a part of a world of law and order. They are themselves caused and  therefore subject to control and modification.    =Attention.= Attention, too, is related to inherited tendencies on the one  side and to habits on the other. If one is walking in the woods and  catches a glimpse of something moving in the trees, the eyes  _instinctively_ turn so that the person can get a better view of the  object. If one hears a sudden sound, the head is instinctively turned so  that the person can hear better. One stops, the body is held still and  rigid, breathing is slow and controlled--all to favor better hearing.    The various acts of attention are reflex and instinctive. But what is  attention? By attention we mean _sensory clearness_. When we say we are  attentive to a thing or subject, we mean that perceptions or ideas of  that thing or subject are _clear_ as compared to other perceptions and  ideas that are in consciousness at the same time. The contents of one's  consciousness, the perceptions and ideas that constitute one's mind at  any one moment are always arranged in an _attentive_ pattern, some  being clear, others unclear. The pattern constantly changes and shifts.  What is now clear and in the focus of consciousness, presently is  unclear and may in a moment disappear from consciousness altogether,  while other perceptions or ideas take its place.    The first question that arises in connection with attention is, What are  the causes of attention? The first group of causes are hereditary and  instinctive. The child attends to loud things, bright things, moving  things, etc. But as we grow older, the basis of attention becomes more  and more _habit_. An illustration will make this clear. I once spent a  day at a great exposition with a machinist. He was constantly attending  to things mechanical, when I would not even see them. He had spent many  years working with machinery, and as a result, things mechanical at once  attracted him. Similarly, if a man and a woman walk along a street  together and look in at the shop windows, the woman sees only hats,  dresses, ribbons, and other finery, while the man sees only cigars,  pipes, and automobile supplies. Every day we live, we are building up  habits of attending to certain types of things. What repeatedly comes  into our experience, easily attracts our attention to the exclusion of  other things.    =The Function of Attention.= Attention is the unifying aspect of  consciousness. There are always many things in consciousness, and we  cannot respond to all at once. The part of consciousness that is clear  and focal brings about action. The things to which we attend are the  things that count.    In later chapters we shall learn that in habit-formation, attention is  an important factor. We must attend to the acts we are trying to  make habitual. In getting knowledge, we must attend to what we are  trying to learn. In committing to memory, we must attend to the ideas  that we are trying to fix and make permanent. In thinking and reasoning,  those ideas become associated together that are together in attention.    Attention is therefore the controlling aspect of consciousness. It is  the basis of what we call _will_. The ideas that are clear and focal and  that persist in consciousness are the ideas that control our action.  When one says he has made up his mind, he has made a choice; that merely  means that a certain group of ideas persist in consciousness to the  exclusion of others. These are the ideas which ultimately produce  action. And it is our past experience that determines what ideas will  become focal and persist.    =Training the Attention.= There are two aspects of the training of  attention. (1) We can learn to hold ourselves to a task. When we sit  down to a table to study, there may be many things that tend to call us  away. There lies a magazine which we might read, there is a play at the  theater, there are noises outside, there is a friend calling across the  street. But we must study. We have set ourselves to a task and we must  hold fast to our purpose.    The young child cannot do this. He must be trained to do it. The  instruments used to train him are pleasure and pain, rewards and  punishments that come from parents. Gradually, slowly, the child gains  control over himself. No one ever amounts to anything till he can hold  himself to a task, to a fixed purpose. One must learn to form plans  extending over weeks, months, and years, and to hold unflinchingly to  them, just as one must hold himself to his study table and allow nothing  to distract or to interfere. No training a child can receive is more  important than this, for it gives him control over his life, it gives  him control over the ideas that are to become focal and determine  action. It is for this reason that we call such training a training of  attention. It might perhaps better be called a training of the will. But  the will is only the attentive consciousness. The idea that is clear,  that holds its own in"]]]
