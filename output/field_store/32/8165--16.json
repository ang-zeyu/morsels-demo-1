The whole disaster was only made possible  by the fact that there already existed in the world a similar  megalomania, allied to this one in race, to wit, the _Jewish_: once a  chasm began to yawn between Jews and Judaeo-Christians, the latter had  no choice but to employ the self-preservative measures that the Jewish  instinct had devised, even _against_ the Jews themselves, whereas the  Jews had employed them only against non-Jews. The Christian is simply a  Jew of the \"reformed\" confession.--      45.    --I offer a few examples of the sort of thing these petty people have  got into their heads--what they have _put into the mouth_ of the Master:  the unalloyed creed of \"beautiful souls.\"--    \"And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart  thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them.  Verily I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha  in the day of judgment, than for that city\" (Mark vi, 11)--How  _evangelical_!...    \"And whosoever shall offend one of _these_ little ones that believe in  me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck,  and he were cast into the sea\" (Mark ix, 42).--How _evangelical_!...    \"And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for  thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes  to be cast into hell fire; Where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not  quenched.\" (Mark ix, 47.[15])--It is not exactly the eye that is  meant....    [15] To which, without mentioning it, Nietzsche adds verse 48.    \"Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here,  which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God  come with power.\" (Mark ix, 1.)--Well _lied_, lion![16]...    [16] A paraphrase of Demetrius' \"Well roar'd, Lion!\" in act v, scene 1  of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\" The lion, of course, is the familiar  Christian symbol for Mark.    \"Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his  cross, and follow me. _For_...\" (_Note of a psychologist._ Christian  morality is refuted by its _fors_: its reasons are against it,--this  makes it Christian.) Mark viii, 34.--    \"Judge not, that ye be not judged. With what measure ye mete, it shall  be measured to you again.\" (Matthew vii, 1.[17])--What a notion of  justice, of a \"just\" judge!...    [17] Nietzsche also quotes part of verse 2.    \"For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even  the publicans the same? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye  more _than others_? do not even the publicans so?\" (Matthew v,  46.[18])--Principle of \"Christian love\": it insists upon being well  _paid_ in the end....    [18] The quotation also includes verse 47.    \"But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father  forgive your trespasses.\" (Matthew vi, 15.)--Very compromising for the  said \"father.\"...    \"But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all  these things shall be added unto you.\" (Matthew vi, 33.)--All these  things: namely, food, clothing, all the necessities of life. An _error_,  to put it mildly.... A bit before this God appears as a tailor, at least  in certain cases....    \"Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward _is_  great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the  prophets.\" (Luke vi, 23.)--_Impudent_ rabble! It compares itself to the  prophets....    \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and _that_ the spirit of God  dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, _him shall God  destroy_; for the temple of God is holy, _which temple ye are_.\" (Paul,  1 Corinthians iii, 16.[19])--For that sort of thing one cannot have  enough contempt....    [19] And 17.    \"Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world  shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?\"  (Paul, 1 Corinthians vi, 2.)--Unfortunately, not merely the speech of  a lunatic.... This _frightful impostor_ then proceeds: \"Know ye not  that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this  life?\"...    \"Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that in  the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by  the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.... Not many wise  men after the flesh, not men mighty, not many noble _are called_: But  God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise;  and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things  which are mighty; And base things of the world, and things which are  despised, hath God chosen, _yea_, and things which are not, to bring to  nought things that are: That no flesh should glory in his presence.\"  (Paul, 1 Corinthians i, 20ff.[20])--In order to _understand_ this  passage, a first-rate example of the psychology underlying every  Chandala-morality, one should read the first part of my \"Genealogy of  Morals\": there, for the first time, the antagonism between a _noble_  morality and a morality born of _ressentiment_ and impotent vengefulness  is exhibited. Paul was the greatest of all apostles of revenge....    [20] Verses 20, 21, 26, 27, 28, 29.      46.    --_What follows, then?_ That one had better put on gloves before reading  the New Testament. The presence of so much filth makes it very  advisable. One would as little choose \"early Christians\" for companions  as Polish Jews: not that one need seek out an objection to them....  Neither has a pleasant smell.--I have searched the New Testament in vain  for a single sympathetic touch; nothing is there that is free, kindly,  open-hearted or upright. In it humanity does not even make the first  step upward--the instinct for _cleanliness_ is lacking.... Only _evil_  instincts are there, and there is not even the courage of these evil  instincts. It is all cowardice; it is all a shutting of the eyes, a  self-deception. Every other book becomes clean, once one has read the  New Testament: for example, immediately after reading Paul I took up  with delight that most charming and wanton of scoffers, Petronius, of  whom one may say what Domenico Boccaccio wrote of Caesar Borgia to the  Duke of Parma: \"_e tutto festo_\"--immortally healthy, immortally  cheerful and sound.... These petty bigots make a capital miscalculation.  They attack, but everything they attack is thereby _distinguished_.  Whoever is attacked by an \"early Christian\" is surely _not_ befouled....  On the contrary, it is an honour to have an \"early Christian\" as an  opponent. One cannot read the New Testament without acquired admiration  for whatever it abuses--not to speak of the \"wisdom of this world,\"  which an impudent wind-bag tries to dispose of \"by the foolishness of  preaching.\"... Even the scribes and pharisees are benefitted by such  opposition: they must certainly have been worth something to have been  hated in such an indecent manner. Hypocrisy--as if this were a charge  that the \"early Christians\" _dared_ to make!--After all, they were the  _privileged_, and that was enough: the hatred of the Chandala needed no  other excuse. The \"early Christian\"--and also, I fear, the \"last  Christian,\" _whom I may perhaps live to see_--is a rebel against all  privilege by profound instinct--he lives and makes war for ever for  \"equal rights.\"... Strictly speaking, he has no alternative. When a man  proposes to represent, in his own person, the \"chosen of God\"--or to be  a \"temple of God,\" or a \"judge of the angels\"--then every _other_  criterion, whether based upon honesty, upon intellect, upon manliness  and pride, or upon beauty and freedom of the heart, becomes simply  \"worldly\"--_evil in itself_.... Moral: every word that comes from the  lips of an \"early Christian\" is a lie, and his every act is  instinctively dishonest--all his values, all his aims are noxious, but  _whoever_ he hates, _whatever_ he hates, has real _value_.... The  Christian, and particularly the Christian priest, is thus a _criterion  of values_.    --Must I add that, in the whole New Testament, there appears but a  _solitary_ figure worthy of honour? Pilate, the Roman viceroy. To regard  a Jewish imbroglio _seriously_--that was quite beyond him. One Jew more  or less--what did it matter?... The noble scorn of a Roman, before whom  the word \"truth\" was shamelessly mishandled, enriched the New Testament  with the only saying _that has any value_--and that is at once its  criticism and its _destruction_: \"What is truth?...\"      47.    --The thing that sets us apart is not that we are unable to find God,  either in history, or in nature, or behind nature--but that we regard  what has been honoured as God, not as \"divine,\" but as pitiable, as  absurd, as injurious; not as a mere error, but as a _crime against  life_.... We deny that God is God.... If any one were to _show_ us this  Christian God, we'd be still less inclined to believe in him.--In a  formula: _deus, qualem Paulus creavit, dei negatio_.--Such a religion as  Christianity, which does not touch reality at a single point and which  goes to pieces the moment reality asserts its rights at any point, must  be inevitably the deadly enemy of the \"wisdom of this world,\" which is  to say, of _science_--and it will give the name of good to whatever  means serve to poison, calumniate and _cry down_ all intellectual  discipline, all lucidity and strictness in matters of intellectual  conscience, and all noble"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19331"],[0,"Ceremonial of Hasjelti Dailjis and Mythical Sand Painting of the Navajo Indians (#15)"],[1," then he heard a tumult over his head like people passing and he went  out to see who made the noise, and he discovered many crows crossing back  and forth over the canyon. This was the home of the crow. There were other  feathered people also (the chaparral cock was among them). He saw also  many fires which had been made by the crows on either side of the canyon.  Two other crows arrived and stood near him and he listened hard to hear  all that was being said. These two crows cried out, \"Somebody says,  somebody says.\" The youth did not know what to make of this. Then, a crow  from the opposite side of the canyon called, \"What is the matter; tell us,  tell us; what is wrong?\" The two first criers then said, \"Two of us got  killed; we met two men who told us. They said the two men, who were all  the time traveling around (referring to the two brothers of the crazy  youth), killed twelve deer and a party of our people went to the deer  after they were killed. Two of us who went after the blood of the deer  were shot.\" The crows on the other side of the canyon, called, \"Which men  got killed?\" The first crier replied, \"The chaparral cock, who sat on the  horn of the deer, and the crow, who sat on its backbone.\" The other called  out, \"We are not surprised that they were killed; that is what we tell you  all the time. If you will go after the dead deer you must expect to be  killed.\" \"We will not think of them longer; they are dead and gone. We are  talking of things of long ago.\" The younger brother sat quietly below and  listened to everything that was being said.    After a time the crows on the other side of the canyon made a great noise  and began to dance. They had many songs at that time. The youth could not  see what they were doing, but he listened all the time. After the dance  began a great fire was made, and then he could see black objects moving,  but he could not distinguish any people. He recognized the voice of  Hasjelti. Though the youth was crazy, he remembered everything in his  heart. He even remembered the words of the songs that continued all the  night; he remembered every word of every song. He said to himself, \"I will  listen until daylight.\" These people did not remain on one side of the  canyon where the first fires were built, but they crossed and recrossed in  their dance and had fires on both sides of the canyon. They danced back  and forth until daylight (on the ninth night of the Hasjelti Dailjis was a  repetition of this dance), when all the crows and the other birds flew  away to the west. All that he saw after they left was the fires and smoke.  The crazy youth then started off in a run to his brothers' camp to tell  what he had seen and heard. His brothers were up early and saw the boy  approaching. They said, \"I bet he will have lots of stories to tell. He  will say he saw something no one ever saw, or somebody jumped on him.\" And  the brother-in-law who was with them said, \"Let him alone; when he comes  into camp he will tell us all, and I believe these things do happen, for  he could not make up these things all the time.\"    The camp was surrounded by pinon brush and a large fire burned in the  center of the inclosure; there was much meat roasting over the fire. As  soon as the youth reached the camp he raked over the coals and said, \"I  feel cold.\" The brother-in-law replied, \"It is cold. When people camp  together they tell stories to one another in the mornings; we have told  ours and we must now hear yours.\" The youth related his experiences of the  past night. He said, \"Where I stopped last night was the worst camp I ever  had.\" The brothers kept their backs to the youth and pretended not to pay  any attention, but the brother-in-law listened and questioned him. He  continued, \"I never heard such a noise.\" The brothers then remarked, \"I  thought he would say something like that\" (they were jealous of this crazy  brother, he saw so much they could not see). The brother-in-law was  inclined to believe the youth's story and asked what kind of people made  the noise. \"I do not know. They were strange people to me, but I do know  they danced all night back and forth across the canyon, and I know my  brothers killed twelve deer, and afterwards killed two of their people who  went for the blood of the deer. I heard them say, 'That is what must be  expected if you will go to such places you must expect to be killed.'\" The  elder brother began thinking and without turning toward the youth asked,  \"How many deer did you say were killed?\" and he answered \"twelve.\" Then  the older brother said, \"Well, sir, you have told me many stories and I  never believed you, but this story I do believe. What is the matter with  you that you know all these things? How do you know these things and find  out these things?\" The youth replied, \"I do not know how, but all these  things come to my mind and my eyes.\" The elder brother said, \"I will now  give more thought to you and study how you find out all about these  things. We have a lot of meat and we did not know how to get it home; now  that you have come let us return; you shall carry the meat.\" When halfway  home they were about to descend a mesa, and when on the edge they sat down  to rest; then they saw far down the mesa four mountain sheep, and the  brothers commanded the youth to kill one for them. They said, \"Our meat is  dry; your legs are fresh, so you will kill the sheep.\" The youth succeeded  in heading off the sheep by hiding in a bush (_Bigelovia Douglasii_(9))  sometimes called sage brush but it is not the true sage brush. The sheep  came directly toward him; he aimed his arrow at them, but before he could  pull the bow his arm stiffened and became dead and the sheep passed by.  All the sheep passed him, but he again headed them off by hiding in the  stalks of a large yucca.(10) The sheep passed within five steps of him,  and again when the time to pull the bow came his arm stiffened. The crow  people were watching him all the time. He again followed the sheep and got  ahead of them and hid behind a birch tree in bloom; he had his bow ready,  but as the sheep approached him they became gods. The first one was  Hasjelti, the second was Hostjoghon, the third was Naaskiddi, the fourth  one was Hadatchishi. At this strange metamorphosis the youth was greatly  alarmed, he dropped his bow and fell to the ground senseless. Hasjelti  stood at the east side of the youth, Hostjoghon to the south, Naaskiddi to  the west, and Hadatchishi to the north of him. Each had a rattle, which  was used to accompany the songs for the recovery of the youth. They also  traced with their rattle in the sand this emblem, meaning a figure of a  man, and drew parallel lines at the head and feet with the rattle. When  this was done the youth recovered and the gods had again assumed the form  of sheep. They asked the youth why he had tried to shoot them. \"You see  you are one of us,\" they said. The youth had become transformed into a  sheep. \"There is to be a dance far off to the north beyond Ute Mountain;  we want you to go with us to the dance. We will dress you like ourselves  and teach you to dance; we will then go over the world.\" The brothers who  watched from the mesa top wondered what the trouble could be. They could  not see the gods. They saw the youth lying on the ground and said, \"We  must go and see what is the matter.\" On reaching the place they found that  their young brother had gone. They saw where he had lain and where the  people had worked over him. They began crying and said, \"For a long time  we would not believe him, and now he has gone off with the sheep.\" They  made many efforts to head off the sheep, but without success, and they  cried all the more, saying, as they returned to the mesa, \"Our brother  told us the truth and we would not believe him; had we believed him he  would not have gone off with the sheep; perhaps some day we will see him.\"                              [Illustration: Emblem]    At the dance the sheep found seven others like themselves. This made their  number twelve. The seven joined the others in their journey around the  world. All people let them see their dances and learn their songs. Then  all the number excepting the youth talked together and they said, \"There  is no use keeping him with us longer (referring to the youth); he has  learned everything; he may as well go now and tell his people and have  them do as we do.\" The youth was instructed to have twelve in the dance,  six gods and six goddesses, with Hasjelti to lead them. He was told to  have his people make masks to represent them. It would not do to have  twelve Naaskiddi represented among the Navajo, for they would not believe  it and there would be trouble. They could not learn all of their songs.  The youth returned to his brothers, carrying with him all songs, all  medicine, and clothing.          THE OLD MAN AND WOMAN OF THE FIRST WORLD.      In the lower world four gods were created by Etseastin and Etseasun. These  gods were so annoyed by ants that they said, \"Let us go to the four points  of the world.\" A spring was found at each of the cardinal points, and each  god took possession of a spring, which he jealously guarded.    Etseastin and Etseasun were jealous because they had no water and they  needed some to produce nourishment. The old man finally obtained a little  water from each of the gods and planted it, and from it he raised a spring  such as the gods had. From this spring came corn and other vegetation.  Etseastin and Etseasun sat on opposite sides of the spring facing each  other, and sang and prayed and talked to somebody about themselves, and  thus they originated worship. One day the old man saw some kind of fruit  in the middle of the spring. He tried to reach it but he could not, and  asked the spider woman (a member of his family) to get it for him. She  spun a web across the water and by its use procured the fruit,"]]]
