I    THE CHARACTER OF CYRUS THE YOUNGER[45]      Thus then died Cyrus, a man who, of all the Persians since Cyrus the  Elder, was the most princely and most worthy of empire, as is agreed  by all who appear to have had personal knowledge of him. In the first  place, while he was yet with his brother and the other youths, he was  a boy, and when he was receiving his education thought to surpass them  all in everything. For without exception the sons of the Persian  nobles are educated at the gates of the king;[46] where they may learn  many a lesson of virtuous conduct, but can see or hear nothing  disgraceful. In this place the boys see some honored by the king, and  others disgraced, and hear of them; so that in their very childhood  they learn to govern and to obey.    Here Cyrus, first of all, showed himself most remarkable for modesty  among those of his own age, and for paying more ready obedience to his  elders than even those who were inferior to him in station; and next  he was noted for his fondness for horses, and for managing them in a  superior manner. They found him, too, very desirous of learning and  most assiduous in practising the warlike exercises of archery and  hurling the javelin. When it suited his age, he grew extremely fond of  the chase, and of braving dangers in encounters with wild beasts. On  one occasion he did not shrink from a she bear that attacked him;  however, in grappling with her, he was dragged from his horse, and  received some wounds, the scars of which were visible on his body, but  at last killed her. The person who first came to his assistance he  made a happy man in the eyes of many.    When he was sent down by his father, as satrap of Lydia and Great  Phrygia and Cappadocia, and was also appointed commander of all the  troops whose duty it is to muster in the plain of Castolus, he soon  showed that if he made a league or compact with any one, or gave a  promise, he deemed it of the utmost importance not to break his word.  Accordingly, the states that were committed to his charge, as well as  individuals, had the greatest confidence in him; and if any one had  been his enemy, he felt secure that if Cyrus entered into a treaty  with him, he should suffer no infraction of the stipulations. When,  therefore, he waged war against Tissaphernes,[47] all the cities, of  their own accord, chose to adhere to Cyrus in preference to  Tissaphernes, except the Milesians; but they feared Cyrus, because he  would not abandon the cause of the exiles; for he both showed by his  deeds, and declared in words, that he would never desert them, since  he had once become a friend to them, not even tho they should grow  still fewer in number, and be in a worse condition than they were.    Whenever any one did Cyrus a kindness or an injury, he showed himself  anxious to go beyond him in those respects; and some used to mention a  wish of his, that he \"desired to live long enough to outdo both those  who had done him good, and those who had done him ill, in the requital  that he should make.\" Accordingly, to him alone of the men of our days  were so great a number of people desirous of committing the disposal  of their property, their cities, and their own person.    Yet no one could with truth say this of him, that he suffered the  criminal or unjust to deride his authority; for he of all men  inflicted punishment most unsparingly; and there were often to be  seen, along the most frequented roads, men deprived of their feet, or  hands, or eyes; so that in Cyrus' dominions it was possible for any  one, Greek or barbarian, who did no wrong, to travel without fear  whithersoever he pleased, and having with him whatever might suit his  convenience.    To those who showed ability for war, it is acknowledged that he paid  distinguished honor. His first war was with the Pisidians and Mysians;  and, marching in person into these countries, he made those whom he  saw voluntarily hazarding their lives in his service governors over  the territory that he subdued, and distinguished them with rewards in  other ways, so that the brave appeared to be the most fortunate of  men, while the cowardly were deemed fit only to be their slaves. There  were, therefore, great numbers of persons who voluntarily exposed  themselves to danger wherever they thought that Cyrus would become  aware of their exertions.    With regard to justice, if any appeared to him inclined to display  that virtue, he made a point of making such men richer than those who  sought to profit by injustice. Accordingly, while in many other  respects his affairs were administered judiciously, he likewise  possest an army worthy of the name. For it was not for money that  generals and captains came from foreign lands to enter into his  service, but because they were persuaded that to serve Cyrus well  would be more profitable than any amount of monthly pay. Besides, if  any one executed his orders in a superior manner, he never suffered  his diligence to go unrewarded; consequently, in every undertaking,  the best-qualified officers were said to be ready to assist him.    If he noticed any one that was a skilful manager, with strict regard  to justice, stocking the land of which he had the direction, and  securing income from it, he would never take anything from such a  person, but was ever ready to give him something in addition; so that  men labored with cheerfulness, acquired property with confidence, and  made no concealment from Cyrus of what each possest; for he did not  appear to envy those who amassed riches openly, but to endeavor to  bring into use the wealth of those who concealed it.    Whatever friends he made, and felt to be well disposed to him, and  considered to be capable of assisting him in anything that he might  wish to accomplish, he is acknowledged by all to have been most  successful in attaching them to him. For, on the very same account on  which he thought that he himself had need of friends--namely, that he  might have cooperators in his undertakings--did he endeavor to prove  an efficient assistant to his friends in whatever he perceived any of  them desirous of effecting.    He received, for many reasons, more presents than perhaps any other  single individual; and these he outdid every one else in distributing  among his friends, having a view to the character of each, and to what  he perceived each most needed. Whatever presents any one sent him of  articles of personal ornament, whether for warlike accouterment or  merely for dress, concerning these, they said, he used to remark that  he could not decorate his own person with them all, but that he  thought friends well equipped were the greatest ornament a man could  have. That he should outdo his friends, indeed, in conferring great  benefits is not at all wonderful, since he was so much more able; but  that he should surpass his friends in kind attentions and an anxious  desire to oblige, appears to me far more worthy of admiration.  Frequently, when he had wine served him of a peculiarly fine flavor,  he would send half-emptied flagons of it to some of his friends, with  a message to this effect, \"Cyrus has not for some time met with  pleasanter wine than this; and he has therefore sent some of it to  you, and begs you will drink it to-day, with those whom you love  best.\" He would often, too, send geese partly eaten and the halves of  loaves, and other such things, desiring the bearer to say, in  presenting them, \"Cyrus has been delighted with these, and therefore  wishes you also to taste of them.\"    Wherever provender was scarce, but he himself, from having many  attendants, and from the care which he took, was able to procure some,  he would send it about, and desire his friends to give that provender  to the horses that carried them, so that hungry steeds might not carry  his friends. Whenever he rode out and many were likely to see him, he  would call to him his friends, and hold earnest conversation with  them, that he might show whom he held in honor; so that, from what I  have heard, I should think that no one was ever beloved by a greater  number"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20910"],[0,"South American Fights and Fighters, and Other Tales of Adventure (#15)"],[1," he was a tall man, {86}  Atahualpa offered to fill the room with gold to the height he had  touched, if, when he had completed his undertaking, Pizarro would  release him.    Pizarro jumped at the offer, and well he might for no such proposition  had ever before been offered in the history of the world.  The cubic  contents enclosed by the figures mentioned are three thousand three  hundred and sixty-six feet, or in round numbers, one hundred and  twenty-five cubic yards.  Such a treasure was even beyond the most  delirious dreams of the conquerors.[8]    As soon as these astonishing terms had been formally accepted in  writing by Pizarro, the Inca sent orders to all parts of his dominion  for the people to bring in their treasures.  He also directed the royal  palaces and temples to be stripped, and his orders were obeyed.  He had  stipulated that he be allowed two months in which to raise the ransom  and day after day a stream of Indians poured into the city loaded with  treasure which dazzled the eyes of the astonished and delighted  conquerors.  Atahualpa had stipulated also that the gold was not to be  smelted--that is, he would not be required to fill the spaces solidly  with ingots, but that it should be put into the room just as it was  brought in and allowed to take up as much space as was required, even  though it might be in the shape of a manufactured article.    [Illustration: \"They Burst Upon the Ranks of the Unarmed Indians.\"]    {87}    Some of the gold was in the shape of ingenious plants and animals, one  especially beautiful object being the corn plant with blades of gold  and tassels of silver.  Pizarro, to his credit, ordered that some of  these specimens of exquisite workmanship should be preserved intact.  Much of the treasure was in the shape of plates or tiles, from the  interior of the temples or palaces which did not take up much space.  The great temple of the Sun at Cuzco had a heavy outside cornice, or  moulding, of pure gold.  It was stripped of this dazzling ornament to  satisfy the rapacity of the conquerors.  There was also a vast quantity  of silver which was stored in other chambers.  Silver hardly counted in  view of the deluge of the more precious metal.    [Illustration: \"The Three Pizarros . . . Sallied Out to Meet Them\"]    Atahualpa did not quite succeed in filling the space, but he came so  near it that Pizarro, in a formal agreement executed before a notary,  declared that the Inca had paid his ransom and that he was released  from any further obligation concerning it.  That is the only release,  however, which the unfortunate Inca ever got.  Obviously, it was  dangerous to turn loose such a man.  Therefore, in spite of his legal  quittance, he still was held in captivity.  The Spaniards concluded  finally that the only safe course was to get rid of him.    The ransom amounted in our money to over seventeen million dollars,  according to Prescott; to nearly eighteen million dollars, according to  Markham.  Pizarro's personal share was seven hundred thousand dollars;  Hernando received three hundred and fifty thousand dollars; De Soto two  hundred and fifty thousand dollars.  Each horse soldier received nearly  one hundred thousand; the principal foot soldiers, fifty thousand, and  the others smaller sums in accordance {88} with their rank and service.  The precious metals were so plentiful that for the time being they lost  their value, for men cheerfully paid thousands of dollars for a horse.  Indeed so bulky and unwieldly was the treasure with which the soldiers  were loaded, that it is solemnly averred that creditors avoided their  debtors fearing lest the latter should pay them what they owed in  further heaps of the bulky treasure; and it is certainly a fact that  even the animals shared in the opulence of the conquest, for the horses  were shod with silver.  Silver was cheaper and easier to get than iron.    While they were revelling in the treasure, dividing the spoils and  deliberating what was to be done with Atahualpa, Almagro arrived with  his reenforcements.  Naturally he and his men demanded a share of the  booty.  Great was their disgust and furious their anger when Pizarro  and the other conquerors refused to give it up.  Finally, the quarrels  that ensued were composed by presenting Almagro and his followers  certain sums, large in themselves though trifling in comparison with  what Pizarro's men had received.  Almagro's men were also given to  understand that they could move on to the southwest at some convenient  season and conquer another empire and take all they could for  themselves.  Unfortunately for them, there were no more empires like  Peru on this or any other side of the world left them to conquer.    Hernando Pizarro was then dispatched to Spain to deliver the royal  fifth to Charles, to give an account of the fortunes of the conquerors  and to secure what further rewards and privileges he could for them.  Atahualpa saw him leave with the greatest regret.  He was a man of  fierce, stern, implacable disposition, {89} not a lovely character,  according to any of the chroniclers, but he seems to have been fairer,  and in his own way he had treated the unfortunate monarch better, than  any of the others, unless it was De Soto.  Possibly Hernando might have  restrained his brother from the last infamy he was about to perpetrate  if he had been there.  Certainly De Soto would have sought to dissuade  him.  Pizarro realized this and got rid of De Soto by sending him away  to investigate as to the truth of rumors that Atahualpa was conspiring  to obtain his freedom.  I have no doubt that he was so conspiring.  I  hope so, for if he was, it was about the only manly thing that he did.  While De Soto was away, at the instigation of the soldiers, Pizarro  with seeming reluctance, allowed Atahualpa to be brought to trial.  I  have no doubt that Pizarro instigated the soldiers himself.  He was  adroit enough to do it, and he would have no scruples whatever to deter  him.    The Inca was tried on twelve charges, among which were included  accusations that he had usurped the crown, and given its prerogatives  to his friends (instead of to the Spaniards!).  He was charged with  being an idolator, an adulterer and a polygamist, and finally it was  urged that he had endeavored to incite an insurrection against the  Spaniards.  Such accusations came with a peculiarly bad grace from the  conquerors.  The whole thing, charges and all, would have been a farce  had it not been for the certain grim and terrible outcome.    Felippo, the Infamous, was the only interpreter.  He had made love to  one of the Inca's wives, whom the Spaniards had allowed to share his  captivity.  Atahualpa, furiously affronted, desired to have him {90}  put to death, but Felippo was too important to the Spaniards, and he  was spared.  How Atahualpa's defense suffered from Felippo's  interpretations under such circumstances may easily be imagined.  In  spite of the courageous opposition of a few of the self-appointed  judges, the Inca was convicted and sentenced to death, Father Valverde  concurring, in writing, with the sentence.    When the verdict of the court was communicated to Atahualpa, he did not  receive it with any remarkable degree of fortitude.  He is a pitiful  rather than a heroic figure.    \"What have I done,\" he cried, weeping, \"what have my children done,  that I should meet with such a fate?\"  Turning to Pizarro, he added,  \"And from your hands, too, who have met with friendship and kindness  from my people, to whom I have given my treasure, who have received  nothing but benefit from my hands!\"    He besought the conqueror to spare his life, promising anything, even  to double the enormous ransom he had already paid, and offering to  guarantee in any appointed way the safety of every Spaniard in the  army.  Pedro Pizarro, a cousin of the conqueror, who has left an  account of the interview, says that Pizarro was greatly affected by the  touching appeal of the unfortunate monarch, and that he wept in turn  also.  However that may be, he refused to interfere.  A man may weep  and weep, to paraphrase Shakespeare, \"and be a villain!\"  There was no  help for it; Atahualpa had to die.    It was on the 29th of August, 1533.  The trial and deliberations had  occupied the whole day.  It was two hours after sunset before they were  ready to execute him in the great square of Caxamarca.  {91} The  Spanish soldiers, fully armed, arranged themselves about a huge stake  which had been planted in the square.  Back of them were groups of  terrified, awe-struck Peruvians, helplessly weeping and lamenting the  fate of their monarch which they were powerless to prevent.  Flickering  torches held by the troops cast an uncertain light over the tragic  scene.  Atahualpa was led forth in fetters and chained to the stake.  He showed little of the firmness and fortitude of a proud monarch or a  brave man.  How feebly he appears when contrasted with the great Aztec  Guatemotzin, calmly enduring the tortures of the red-hot gridiron and  resolutely refusing to gratify either his captors' lust for treasure or  desire for revenge by vouchsafing them a single fact or a single moan.    By Inca's side was Valverde, who had been assiduous in his endeavors to  make him a Christian.  The friar was ready to offer such grim  consolation as he could to the wretched Peruvian in whose death  sentence he had concurred.  Atahualpa had hitherto turned a deaf ear to  all his importunities, but at the last moment Valverde told him that if  he would consent to receive baptism, he should be strangled instead of  burnt to death.  Atahualpa asked Pizarro if this was true, and being  assured that it was, he abjured his religion to avoid the agonies of  fire, and was thereupon baptised under the name of Juan de Atahualpa.  The name John was given to him because this baptism _in extremis_ took  place on St. John the"]]]
