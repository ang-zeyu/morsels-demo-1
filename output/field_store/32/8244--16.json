The Jews  among whom he lived in those parts were faithful to the essence of the  religion, but they allowed themselves more latitude in practice and  observance than the people in Polotzk. Instead of bribing government  officials to relax the law of compulsory education for boys, these  people pushed in numbers at every open door of culture and  enlightenment. Even the girls were given books in Odessa and Kherson,  as the rock to build their lives on, and not as an ornament for  idleness. My father's mind was ready for the reception of such ideas,  and he was inspired by the new view of the world which they afforded  him.    When he returned to Polotzk he knew what had been wrong with his life  before, and he proceeded to remedy it. He resolved to live, as far as  the conditions of existence in Polotzk permitted, the life of a modern  man. And he saw no better place to begin than with the education of  the children. Outwardly he must conform to the ways of his neighbors,  just as he must pay tribute to the policeman on the beat; for standing  room is necessary to all operations, and social ostracism could ruin  him as easily as police persecution. His children, if he started them  right, would not have to bow to the yoke as low as he; his children's  children might even be free men. And education was the one means to  redemption.    Fetchke and I were started with a rebbe, in the orthodox way, but we  were taught to translate as well as read Hebrew, and we had a secular  teacher besides. My sister and I were very diligent pupils, and my  father took great satisfaction in our progress and built great plans  for our higher education.    My brother, who was five years old when he entered heder, hated to be  shut up all day over a printed page that meant nothing to him. He  cried and protested, but my father was determined that he should not  grow up ignorant, so he used the strap freely to hasten the truant's  steps to school. The heder was the only beginning allowable for a boy  in Polotzk, and to heder Joseph must go. So the poor boy's life was  made a nightmare, and the horror was not lifted until he was ten years  old, when he went to a modern school where intelligible things were  taught, and it proved that it was not the book he hated, but the  blindness of the heder.    For a number of peaceful years after my father's return from \"far  Russia,\" we led a wholesome life of comfort, contentment, and faith in  to-morrow. Everything prospered, and we children grew in the sun. My  mother was one with my father in all his plans for us. Although she  had spent her young years in the pursuit of the ruble, it was more to  her that our teacher praised us than that she had made a good bargain  with a tea merchant. Fetchke and Joseph and I, and Deborah, when she  grew up, had some prospects even in Polotzk, with our parents' hearts  set on the highest things; but we were destined to seek our fortunes  in a world which even my father did not dream of when he settled down  to business in Polotzk.    Just when he felt himself safe and strong, a long series of troubles  set in to harass us, and in a few years' time we were reduced to a  state of helpless poverty, in which there was no room to think of  anything but bread. My father became seriously ill, and spent large  sums on cures that did not cure him. While he was still an invalid, my  mother also became ill and kept her bed for the better part of two  years. When she got up, it was only to lapse again. Some of us  children also fell ill, so that at one period the house was a  hospital. And while my parents were incapacitated, the business was  ruined through bad management, until a day came when there was not  enough money in the cash drawer to pay the doctor's bills.    For some years after they got upon their feet again, my parents  struggled to regain their place in the business world, but failed to  do so. My father had another period of experimenting with this or that  business, like his earlier experience. But everything went wrong, till  at last he made a great resolve to begin life all over again. And the  way to do that was to start on a new soil. My father determined to  emigrate to America.    I have now told who I am, what my people were, how I began life, and  why I was brought to a new home. Up to this point I have borrowed the  recollections of my parents, to piece out my own fragmentary  reminiscences. But from now on I propose to be my own pilot across the  seas of memory; and if I lose myself in the mists of uncertainty, or  run aground on the reefs of speculation, I still hope to make port at  last, and I shall look for welcoming faces on the shore. For the ship  I sail in is history, and facts will kindle my beacon fires.          CHAPTER V    I REMEMBER      My father and mother could tell me much more that I have forgotten, or  that I never was aware of; but I want to reconstruct my childhood from  those broken recollections only which, recurring to me in after years,  filled me with the pain and wonder of remembrance. I want to string  together those glimpses of my earliest days that dangle in my mind,  like little lanterns in the crooked alleys of the past, and show me an  elusive little figure that is myself, and yet so much a stranger to  me, that I often ask, Can this be I?    I have not much faith in the reality of my first recollection, but as  I can never go back over the past without bringing up at last at this  sombre little scene, as at a door beyond which I cannot pass, I must  put it down for what it is worth in the scheme of my memories. I see,  then, an empty, darkened room. In the middle, on the floor, lies a  long Shape, covered with some black stuff. There are candles at the  head of the Shape. Dim figures are seated low, against the walls,  swaying to and fro. No sound is in the room, except a moan or a sigh  from the shadowy figures; but a child is walking softly around and  around the Shape on the floor, in quiet curiosity.    The Shape is the body of my grandfather laid out for burial. The child  is myself--myself asking questions of Death.    I was four years old when my mother's father died. Do I really  remember the little scene? Perhaps I heard it described by some fond  relative, as I heard other anecdotes of my infancy, and unconsciously  incorporated it with my genuine recollections. It is so suitable a  scene for a beginning: the darkness, the mystery, the impenetrability.  My share in it, too, is characteristic enough, if I really studied  that Shape by the lighted candles, as I have always pretended to  myself. So often afterwards I find myself forgetting the conventional  meanings of things, in some search for a meaning of my own. It is more  likely, however, that I took no intellectual interest in my  grandfather's remains at the time, but later on, when I sought for a  First Recollection, perhaps, elaborated the scene, and my part in it,  to something that satisfied my sense of dramatic fitness. If I really  committed such a fraud, I am now well punished, by being obliged, at  the very start, to discredit the authenticity of my memoirs.    The abode of our childhood, if not revisited in later years, is apt to  loom in our imagination as a vast edifice with immense chambers in  which our little self seems lost. Somehow I have failed of this  illusion. My grandfather's house, where I was born, stands, in my  memory, a small, one-story wooden building, whose chimneys touch the  sky at the same level as its neighbors' chimneys. Such as it was, the  house stood even with the sidewalk, but the yard was screened from the  street by a board fence, outside which I am sure there was a bench.  The gate into the yard swung so high from the ground that four-footed  visitors did not have to wait till it was opened. Pigs found their way  in, and were shown the way out, under the gate; grunting on their  arrival, but squealing on their departure.       [Illustration: MY GRANDFATHER'S HOUSE, WHERE I WAS BORN]    Of the interior of the house I remember only one room, and not so much  the room as the window, which had a blue sash curtain, and beyond the  curtain a view of a narrow, walled garden, where deep-red dahlias  grew. The garden belonged to the house adjoining my grandfather's,  where lived the Gentile girl who was kind to me.    Concerning my dahlias I have been told that they were not dahlias at  all, but poppies. As a conscientious historian I am bound to record  every rumor, but I retain the right to cling to my own impression.  Indeed, I must insist on my dahlias, if I am to preserve the garden at  all. I have so long believed in them, that if I try to see _poppies_  in those red masses over the wall, the whole garden crumbles away, and  leaves me a gray blank. I have nothing against poppies. It is only  that my illusion is more real to me than reality. And so do we often  build our world on an error, and cry out that the universe is falling  to pieces, if any one but lift a finger to replace the error by truth.    Ours was a quiet neighborhood. Across the narrow street was the  orderly front of the Korpus, or military academy, with straight rows  of unshuttered windows. It was an imposing edifice in the eyes of us  all, because it was built of brick, and was several stories high. At  one of the windows I pretend I remember seeing a tailor mending the  uniforms of the cadets. I knew the uniforms, and I knew, in later  years, the man who had been the tailor; but I am not sure that he did  not emigrate to America, there to seek his fortune in a candy shop,  and his happiness in a family of triplets, twins, and even odds, long  before I was old enough to toddle as far as the gate.    Behind my grandfather's house was a low hill, which I do _not_  remember as a mountain. Perhaps it was only a hump in the ground. This  eminence, of whatever stature, was a part of the Vall, a longer and  higher"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20897"],[0,"A Short History of England (#15)"],[1,"speeches that it has been the  glory of their lives to make allegorical bricks without straw. In  another case we shall find a Worshipful Company of Whitewashers who do  deserve their name, in the sense that many of them employ a large number  of other people to whitewash. These Companies support large charities  and often doubtless very valuable charities; but their object is quite  different from that of the old charities of the Guilds. The aim of the  Guild charities was the same as the aim of the Common Land. It was to  resist inequality--or, as some earnest old gentlemen of the last  generation would probably put it, to resist evolution. It was to ensure,  not only that bricklaying should survive and succeed, but that every  bricklayer should survive and succeed. It sought to rebuild the ruins of  any bricklayer, and to give any faded whitewasher a new white coat. It  was the whole aim of the Guilds to cobble their cobblers like their  shoes and clout their clothiers with their clothes; to strengthen the  weakest link, or go after the hundredth sheep; in short, to keep the row  of little shops unbroken like a line of battle. It resisted the growth  of a big shop like the growth of a dragon. Now even the whitewashers of  the Whitewashers Company will not pretend that it exists to prevent a  small shop being swallowed by a big shop, or that it has done anything  whatever to prevent it. At the best the kindness it would show to a  bankrupt whitewasher would be a kind of compensation; it would not be  reinstatement; it would not be the restoration of status in an  industrial system. So careful of the type it seems, so careless of the  single life; and by that very modern evolutionary philosophy the type  itself has been destroyed. The old Guilds, with the same object of  equality, of course, insisted peremptorily upon the same level system of  payment and treatment which is a point of complaint against the modern  Trades Unions. But they insisted also, as the Trades Unions cannot do,  upon a high standard of craftsmanship, which still astonishes the world  in the corners of perishing buildings or the colours of broken glass.  There is no artist or art critic who will not concede, however distant  his own style from the Gothic school, that there was in this time a  nameless but universal artistic touch in the moulding of the very tools  of life. Accident has preserved the rudest sticks and stools and pots  and pans which have suggestive shapes as if they were possessed not by  devils but by elves. For they were, indeed, as compared with subsequent  systems, produced in the incredible fairyland of a free country.    That the most mediaeval of modern institutions, the Trades Unions, do not  fight for the same ideal of aesthetic finish is true and certainly  tragic; but to make it a matter of blame is wholly to misunderstand the  tragedy. The Trades Unions are confederations of men without property,  seeking to balance its absence by numbers and the necessary character  of their labour. The Guilds were confederations of men with property,  seeking to ensure each man in the possession of that property. This is,  of course, the only condition of affairs in which property can properly  be said to exist at all. We should not speak of a negro community in  which most men were white, but the rare negroes were giants. We should  not conceive a married community in which most men were bachelors, and  three men had harems. A married community means a community where most  people are married; not a community where one or two people are very  much married. A propertied community means a community where most people  have property; not a community where there are a few capitalists. But in  fact the Guildsmen (as also, for that matter, the serfs, semi-serfs and  peasants) were much richer than can be realized even from the fact that  the Guilds protected the possession of houses, tools, and just payment.  The surplus is self-evident upon any just study of the prices of the  period, when all deductions have been made, of course, for the different  value of the actual coinage. When a man could get a goose or a gallon of  ale for one or two of the smallest and commonest coins, the matter is in  no way affected by the name of those coins. Even where the individual  wealth was severely limited, the collective wealth was very large--the  wealth of the Guilds, of the parishes, and especially of the monastic  estates. It is important to remember this fact in the subsequent  history of England.    The next fact to note is that the local government grew out of things  like the Guild system, and not the system from the government. In  sketching the sound principles of this lost society, I shall not, of  course, be supposed by any sane person to be describing a moral  paradise, or to be implying that it was free from the faults and fights  and sorrows that harass human life in all times, and certainly not least  in our own time. There was a fair amount of rioting and fighting in  connection with the Guilds; and there was especially for some time a  combative rivalry between the guilds of merchants who sold things and  those of craftsmen who made them, a conflict in which the craftsmen on  the whole prevailed. But whichever party may have been predominant, it  was the heads of the Guild who became the heads of the town, and not  vice versa. The stiff survivals of this once very spontaneous uprising  can again be seen in the now anomalous constitution of the Lord Mayor  and the Livery of the City of London. We are told so monotonously that  the government of our fathers reposed upon arms, that it is valid to  insist that this, their most intimate and everyday sort of government,  was wholly based upon tools; a government in which the workman's tool  became the sceptre. Blake, in one of his symbolic fantasies, suggests  that in the Golden Age the gold and gems should be taken from the hilt  of the sword and put upon the handle of the plough. But something very  like this did happen in the interlude of this mediaeval democracy,  fermenting under the crust of mediaeval monarchy and aristocracy; where  productive implements often took on the pomp of heraldry. The Guilds  often exhibited emblems and pageantry so compact of their most prosaic  uses, that we can only parallel them by imagining armorial tabards, or  even religious vestments, woven out of a navvy's corderoys or a coster's  pearl buttons.    Two more points must be briefly added; and the rough sketch of this now  foreign and even fantastic state will be as complete as it can be made  here. Both refer to the links between this popular life and the politics  which are conventially the whole of history. The first, and for that age  the most evident, is the Charter. To recur once more to the parallel of  Trades Unions, as convenient for the casual reader of to-day, the  Charter of a Guild roughly corresponded to that \"recognition\" for which  the railwaymen and other trades unionists asked some years ago, without  success. By this they had the authority of the King, the central or  national government; and this was of great moral weight with mediaevals,  who always conceived of freedom as a positive status, not as a negative  escape: they had none of the modern romanticism which makes liberty akin  to loneliness. Their view remains in the phrase about giving a man the  freedom of a city: they had no desire to give him the freedom of a  wilderness. To say that they had also the authority of the Church is  something of an understatement; for religion ran like a rich thread  through the rude tapestry of these popular things while they were still  merely popular; and many a trade society must have had a patron saint  long before it had a royal seal. The other point is that it was from  these municipal groups already in existence that the first men were  chosen for the largest and perhaps the last of the great mediaeval  experiments: the Parliament.    We have all read at school that Simon de Montfort and Edward I., when  they first summoned Commons to council, chiefly as advisers on local  taxation, called \"two burgesses\" from every town. If we had read a  little more closely, those simple words would have given away the whole  secret of the lost mediaeval civilization. We had only to ask what  burgesses were, and whether they grew on trees. We should immediately  have discovered that England was full of little parliaments, out of  which the great parliament was made. And if it be a matter of wonder  that the great council (still called in quaint archaism by its old title  of the House of Commons) is the only one of these popular or elective  corporations of which we hear much in our books of history, the  explanation, I fear, is simple and a little sad. It is that the  Parliament was the one among these mediaeval creations which ultimately  consented to betray and to destroy the rest.          IX    NATIONALITY AND THE FRENCH WARS      If any one wishes to know what we mean when we say that Christendom was  and is one culture, or one civilization, there is a rough but plain way  of putting it. It is by asking what is the most common, or rather the  most commonplace, of all the uses of the word \"Christian.\" There is, of  course, the highest use of all; but it has nowadays many other uses.  Sometimes a Christian means an Evangelical. Sometimes, and more  recently, a Christian means a Quaker. Sometimes a Christian means a  modest person who believes that he bears a resemblance to Christ. But it  has long had one meaning in casual speech among common people, and it  means a culture or a civilization. Ben Gunn on Treasure Island did not  actually say to Jim Hawkins, \"I feel myself out of touch with a certain  type of civilization\"; but he did say, \"I haven't tasted Christian  food.\" The old wives in a village looking at a lady with short hair and  trousers do not indeed say, \"We perceive a"]]]
