A \"bull\" is one who \"buys for a rise,\"  _i.e._ he buys stocks or securities, grain or other commodities (which,  however, he never intends to take up), in the hope that before the date on  which he must take delivery he will be able to sell the stocks, &c., at a  higher price, taking as a profit the difference between the buying and  selling price. A \"bear\" is the reverse of a \"bull.\" He is one who \"sells  for a fall,\" _i.e._ he sells stock, &c., which he does not actually  possess, in the hope of buying it at a lower price before the time at which  he has contracted to deliver (see ACCOUNT; STOCK EXCHANGE). The word  \"bull,\" according to the _New English Dictionary_, was used in this sense  as early as the beginning of the 18th century. The origin of the use is not  known, though it is tempting to connect it with the fable of the frog and  the bull.    [v.04 p.0788] The term \"bull's eye\" is applied to many circular objects,  and particularly to the boss or protuberance left in the centre of a sheet  of blown glass. This when cut off was formerly used for windows in small  leaded panes. The French term _oeil de boeuf_ is used of a circular window.  Other circular objects to which the word is applied are the centre of a  target or a shot that hits the central division of the target, a  plano-convex lens in a microscope, a lantern with a convex glass in it, a  thick circular piece of glass let into the deck or side of a ship, &c., for  lighting the interior, a ring-shaped block grooved round the outer edge,  and with a hole through the centre through which a rope can be passed, and  also a small lurid cloud which in certain latitudes presages a hurricane.    (2) The use of the word \"bull,\" for a verbal blunder, involving a  contradiction in terms, is of doubtful origin. In this sense it is used  with a possible punning reference to papal bulls in Milton's _True  Religion_, \"and whereas the Papist boasts himself to be a Roman Catholick,  it is a mere contradiction, one of the Pope's Bulls, as if he should say a  universal particular, a Catholick schismatick.\" Probably this use may be  traced to a M.E. word _bul_, first found in the _Cursor Mundi_, c. 1300, in  the sense of falsehood, trickery, deceit; the _New English Dictionary_  compares an O.Fr. _boul_, _boule_ or _bole_, in the same sense. Although  modern associations connect this type of blunder with the Irish, possibly  owing to the many famous \"bulls\" attributed to Sir Boyle Roche (_q.v._),  the early quotations show that in the 17th century, when the meaning now  attached to the word begins, no special country was credited with them.    (3) _Bulla_ (Lat for \"bubble\"), which gives us another \"bull\" in English,  was the term used by the Romans for any boss or stud, such as those on  doors, sword-belts, shields and boxes. It was applied, however, more  particularly to an ornament, generally of gold, a round or heart-shaped box  containing an amulet, worn suspended from the neck by children of noble  birth until they assumed the _toga virilis_, when it was hung up and  dedicated to the household gods. The custom of wearing the bulla, which was  regarded as a charm against sickness and the evil eye, was of Etruscan  origin. After the Second Punic War all children of free birth were  permitted to wear it; but those who did not belong to a noble or wealthy  family were satisfied with a bulla of leather. Its use was only permitted  to grown-up men in the case of generals who celebrated a triumph. Young  girls (probably till the time of their marriage), and even favourite  animals, also wore it (see Ficoroni, _La Bolla d' Oro_, 1732; Yates,  _Archaeological Journal_, vi., 1849; viii., 1851). In ecclesiastical and  medieval Latin, _bulla_ denotes the seal of oval or circular form, bearing  the name and generally the image of its owner, which was attached to  official documents. A metal was used instead of wax in the warm countries  of southern Europe. The best-known instances are the papal _bullae_, which  have given their name to the documents (bulls) to which they are attached.  (See DIPLOMATIC; SEALS; CURIA ROMANA; GOLDEN BULL.)    BULLER, CHARLES (1806-1848), English politician, son of Charles Buller (d.  1848), a member of a well-known Cornish family (see below), was born in  Calcutta on the 6th of August 1806; his mother, a daughter of General  William Kirkpatrick, was an exceptionally talented woman. He was educated  at Harrow, then privately in Edinburgh by Thomas Carlyle, and afterwards at  Trinity College, Cambridge, becoming a barrister in 1831. Before this date,  however, he had succeeded his father as member of parliament for West Looe;  after the passing of the Reform Bill of 1832 and the consequent  disenfranchisement of this borough, he was returned to parliament by the  voters of Liskeard. He retained this seat until he died in London on the  29th of November 1848, leaving behind him, so Charles Greville says, \"a  memory cherished for his delightful social qualities and a vast credit for  undeveloped powers.\" An eager reformer and a friend of John Stuart Mill,  Buller voted for the great Reform Bill, favoured other progressive  measures, and presided over the committee on the state of the records and  the one appointed to inquire into the state of election law in Ireland in  1836. In 1838 he went to Canada with Lord Durham as private secretary, and  after rendering conspicuous service to his chief, returned with him to  England in the same year. After practising as a barrister, Buller was made  judge-advocate-general in 1846, and became chief commissioner of the poor  law about a year before his death. For a long time it was believed that  Buller wrote Lord Durham's famous \"Report on the affairs of British North  America.\" However, this is now denied by several authorities, among them  being Durham's biographer, Stuart J. Reid, who mentions that Buller  described this statement as a \"groundless assertion\" in an article which he  wrote for the _Edinburgh Review_. Nevertheless it is quite possible that  the \"Report\" was largely drafted by Buller, and it almost certainly bears  traces of his influence. Buller was a very talented man, witty, popular and  generous, and is described by Carlyle as \"the genialest radical I have ever  met.\" Among his intimate friends were Grote, Thackeray, Monckton Milnes and  Lady Ashburton. A bust of Buller is in Westminster Abbey, and another was  unveiled at Liskeard in 1905. He wrote \"A Sketch of Lord Durham's mission  to Canada,\" which has not been printed.    See T. Carlyle, _Reminiscences_ (1881); and S.J. Reid, _Life and Letters of  the 1st earl of Durham_ (1906).    BULLER, SIR REDVERS HENRY (1839-1908), British general, son of James  Wentworth Buller, M.P., of Crediton, Devonshire, and the descendant of an  old Cornish family, long established in Devonshire, tracing its ancestry in  the female line to Edward I., was born in 1839, and educated at Eton. He  entered the army in 1858, and served with the 60th (King's Royal Rifles) in  the China campaign of 1860. In 1870 he became captain, and went on the Red  River expedition, where he was first associated with Colonel (afterwards  Lord) Wolseley. In 1873-74 he accompanied the latter in the Ashantee  campaign as head of the Intelligence Department, and was slightly wounded  at the battle of Ordabai; he was mentioned in despatches, made a C.B., and  raised to the rank of major. In 1874 he inherited the family estates. In  the Kaffir War of 1878-79 and the Zulu War of 1879 he was conspicuous as an  intrepid and popular leader, and acquired a reputation for courage and  dogged determination. In particular his conduct of the retreat at Inhlobane  (March 28, 1879) drew attention to these qualities, and on that occasion he  earned the V.C.; he was also created C.M.G. and made lieutenant-colonel and  A.D.C. to the queen. In the Boer War of 1881 he was Sir Evelyn Wood's chief  of staff; and thus added to his experience of South African conditions of  warfare. In 1882 he was head of the field intelligence department in the  Egyptian campaign, and was knighted for his services. Two years later he  commanded an infantry brigade in the Sudan under Sir Gerald Graham, and was  at the battles of El Teb and Tamai, being promoted major-general for  distinguished service. In the Sudan campaign of 1884-85 he was Lord  Wolseley's chief of staff, and he was given command of the desert column  when Sir Herbert Stewart was wounded. He distinguished himself by his  conduct of the retreat from Gubat to Gakdul, and by his victory at Abu Klea  (February 16-17), and he was created K.C.B. In 1886 he was sent to Ireland  to inquire into the \"moonlighting\" outrages, and for a short time he acted  as under-secretary for Ireland; but in 1887 he was appointed  quartermaster-general at the war office. From 1890 to 1897 he held the  office of adjutant-general, attaining the rank of lieutenant-general in  1891. At the war office his energy and ability inspired the belief that he  was fitted for the highest command, and in 1895, when the duke of Cambridge  was about to retire, it was well known that Lord Rosebery's cabinet  intended to appoint Sir Redvers as chief of the staff under a scheme of  reorganization recommended by Lord Hartington's commission. On the eve of  this change, however, the government was defeated, and its successors  appointed Lord Wolseley to the command under the old title of  commander-in-chief. In 1896 he was made a full general.    In 1898 he took command of the troops at Aldershot, and when the Boer War  broke out in 1899 he was selected to command the South African Field Force  (see TRANSVAAL), and landed [v.04 p.0789] at Cape Town on the 31st of  October. Owing to the Boer investment of Ladysmith and the consequent  gravity of the military situation in Natal, he unexpectedly hurried thither  in order to supervise personally the operations, but on the 15th of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19850"],[0,"The Human Side of Animals (#15)"],[1,"accompany  him. When driven from his pen, if by chance one of his party is left  behind he refuses to go--thus indicating that he is able to tell that  the exact number is not with him. His affectionate and gentle  disposition, not to mention his love of his offspring, would entitle him  to rank among the most human of animals. No wonder he is worshipped in  India, where the human side of animal life is understood and appreciated  to a degree quite unknown to the Western world!    The fox and the wolf, and even the coyote, can readily distinguish  whether a herd of sheep or cattle is guarded by three or four dogs, and  whether there is one herdsman or two. They cannot tell the exact number  of sheep, however; neither could a man without first counting them.  Their knowledge of geometry is remarkable. They can orient themselves to  the surrounding woods, measure distances, figure out the safest way of  escape, and the power of the enemy even better than savage man. Yet in  most of these problems, definite notions of number or figures have  little part. A dog, when hunting, for example, on a prairie where he has  to leap over ditches or quickly turn around a large tree, is able by a  second's thought to do so without danger. He clears the wire fence,  leaps the ditch, dashes through a closing gate, or escapes an infuriated  enemy at a moment's notice. This natural wisdom is exercised  spontaneously in him, it is the result of inborn theorems of which he  may not even be aware, but which he uses with a sureness that defies the  book-learning of all our teachers of mathematics. He uses speed, force,  space, mass, and time with so small an effort, and by the quickest and  shortest routes.    Suppose a wolf or a wild hog could not tell how many dogs were attacking  it? There would be no way for it to defend itself. If four dogs attack  it, they are counted and the tactics used that would be useless in other  cases. If four dogs attack, two on each side, it retreats, with face  toward the enemy. If a dozen dogs are in the attacking force, the hog  becomes confused, loses all idea of number, and wildly bites at any  enemy that comes nearest. Man in a similar condition would use  practically the same tactics.    Cats undeniably count their kittens. If the mother loses one of three or  four, she searches for it immediately. When dogs are chasing a hare, if  they raise another, they become very confused, as if they did not know  which to follow. Many shepherd dogs know if a sheep is missing from the  flock and go to hunt it.    The efforts of scientific investigators, who work with so many learned  theories, have been less successful in discovering the real facts about  animals than of laymen, largely because the scientists have not yet  learned that arithmetical notions are more difficult than geometrical  ones. Our industrial civilisation has caused us to lose the idea of the  insignificance that number has in animal life compared to the idea of  size. Most animals have a remarkable sense of size; they measure time  and distance better than civilised man. A hyena, for example, knows just  how near he dare approach an unarmed man.    A sense of time is common among animals that daily eat at fixed hours.  A donkey was accustomed to being fed at six o'clock in the morning, and  when on one occasion his master did not appear on time, he deliberately  kicked in the door to the barn and proceeded to feed himself.    Animals are capable of measuring lapses of time in which they are  particularly interested. Houzeau claims that a female crocodile remains  away from her eggs in the sand for twelve to twenty days, according to  the species, but returns to the place exactly on the day they hatch.    Although we should hesitate to affirm that all animals have an extensive  knowledge of figures and numbers, yet it can hardly be denied that the  elephant, donkey, horse, dog, and cat, if given the proper training,  become good mathematicians. It is undeniable that they have a love of  mental acquisition, and it seems that the Creator has given to every  animal, as a reward for its limitations in other respects, a definite  innate knowledge and desire to advance educationally. There is in the  breast of every animal an irresistible impulse which urges it to advance  in the scale of knowledge. Where the animal is blessed with other mental  powers, there is found a perfect harmony--of tact, intuition, insight,  and genius--all that man himself possesses.          VII    THE LANGUAGE OF ANIMALS        _\"Who ever knew an honest brute    At law his neighbours prosecute,    Bring action for assault and battery    Or friends beguile with lies and flattery?\"_      The fact that all animals possess ideas, no matter how small those ideas  may be, implies reason. That these ideas are transmitted from one animal  to another, no one can doubt in the light of our present scientific  knowledge. \"Be not startled,\" says the distinguished animal authority,  Dr. William T. Hornaday, \"by the discovery that apes and monkeys have  language; for their vocabulary is not half so varied and extensive as  that of the barnyard fowls, whose language some of us know very well.\"  The means by which ideas are transmitted from one animal to another can  be rightly described by no other term than _language_.    It is evident that there are many kinds of language: the written; the  spoken; the universal, which implies the motion, sign, and form  language; the language of the eye, by which ideas are exchanged without  words or gestures; and lastly, a mode of expression little known to the  human world, but universal among animals. This language is spoken by no  man, but is understood by every brute from the tiniest hare to the  largest elephant; it is the language whereby spirit communicates with  spirit, and by which it recognises in a moment what it would take an  entire volume to narrate. In its nature it differs essentially from all  other languages, yet we are justified in thinking of it as a language  because its function is to transmit ideas from one animal to another.  Every form of language is used by animals, and each has its own peculiar  language or \"dialect\" common to its tribe only, though occasionally  learned by others. All the emotions--fear, caution, joy, grief,  gratitude, hope, despair--are disclosed by some form of language.    It would be interesting to know how the use of the word \"dumb\" ever  became applied to animals, for in reality there are very few dumb  animals. Doubtless the word was originally employed to express a larger  idea than that of dumbness, and implied the lack of power in animals to  communicate successfully with man by sound or language. The real trouble  lies with man, who is unable to understand the language spoken or  uttered by the animals.    The gesture language is commonly used by many of the tribes of Southern  Africa, and some of the Bushmen are unable to converse freely after  dark, because their visible gestures are needed as an aid to their  spoken words. Only a few years ago there were almost as many different  languages among the North American Indians as there were different  tribes, and yet each tribe had a sign-language which any Indian in any  part of the world might understand. In fact it was so simple that it  might be practically mastered in a few hours, and through it one might  converse with the Indians of the world without knowing a single word of  their spoken language. And this is exactly what the animals do with  their universal language.    Who does not understand the meaning of a dog when he approaches his  master, after receiving a reprimand for some misdemeanor, with downcast  head and lowered tail? Or who could fail to interpret the glee when he  has done a noble deed and been praised by his master? His is the  language of gesture and look, and is very similar to that in use by our  deaf-and-dumb men throughout the world.    The Hindoos invariably talk to their elephants, and it is astonishing  how they understand. Bayard Taylor says that \"the Arabs govern their  camels with a few cries, and my associates in the African deserts were  always amused whenever I addressed a remark to the dromedary who was my  property for two months; yet at the end of that time the beast evidently  knew the meaning of a number of simple sentences. Some years ago, seeing  the hippopotamus in Barnum's museum looking very stolid and dejected, I  spoke to him in English, but he did not even open his eyes. Then I went  to the opposite corner of the cage, and said in Arabic, 'I know you;  come here to me.' I repeated the words, and thereupon he came to the  corner where I was standing, pressed his huge, ungainly head against the  bars of the cage, and looked in my face with a touch of delight while I  stroked his muzzle. I have two or three times found a lion who  recognised the same language, and the expression of his eyes, for an  instant, seemed positively human.\"    Every one familiar with the habits of dogs believes that they have a  language. Certain shepherds are quite particular about the company their  dogs keep. This story is told of a couple of shepherds meeting in a  market-place in Scotland, each accompanied by his dog, one of which was  a sheep-murderer, the other a faithful and respectable dog. They seemed  to strike up a great friendship, \"and soon assumed so remarkable a  demeanour in their conversation that their owners consulted together on  their own account, and agreed to set a watch upon them. On that very  evening both dogs started from their homes at the same hour, joined each  other, and set off after the sheep.\" It is unquestionable that these  dogs had a sufficiency of language to understand each other. The  criminal had invited his innocent young friend to join him in his  mischief, and they agreed upon the time to meet and each kept his  appointment. It is likely that there was not an"]]]
