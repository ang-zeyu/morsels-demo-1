In the time of Anawrata the religion of Upper Burma  probably did not deserve the name of Buddhism. He introduced in its  place the Buddhism of Lower Burma, tempered by reference to Ceylon.  After 1200 if not earlier the idea prevailed that the Mahavihara was  the standard of orthodoxy and that the Talaing church (which probably  retained some Mahayanist features) fell below it. In the fifteenth  century this view was universally accepted, the opposition and indeed  the separate existence of the Talaing church having come to an end.    But it still remains uncertain whether the earliest Burmese Buddhism  came direct from Magadha or from the south. The story of Asoka's  missionaries cannot be summarily rejected but it also cannot be  accepted without hesitation.[160] It is the Ceylon chronicle which  knows of them and communication between Burma and southern India was  old and persistent. It may have existed even before the Christian era.    After the fall of Pagan, Upper Burma, of which we must now speak,  passed through troubled times and we hear little of religion or  literature. Though Ava was founded in 1364 it did not become an  intellectual centre for another century. But the reign of Narapati  (1442-1468) was ornamented by several writers of eminence among whom  may be mentioned the monk poet Silavamsa and Ariyavamsa, an  exponent of the Abhidhamma. They are noticeable as being the first  writers to publish religious works, either original or translated, in  the vernacular and this practice steadily increased. In the early part  of the sixteenth century[161] occurred the only persecution of  Buddhism known in Burma. Thohanbwa, a Shan who had become king of Ava,  endeavoured to exterminate the order by deliberate massacre and  delivered temples, monasteries and libraries to the flames. The  persecution did not last long nor extend to other districts but it  created great indignation among the Burmese and was perhaps one of the  reasons why the Shan dynasty of Ava was overthrown in 1555.    Bayin (or Bureng) Naung stands out as one of the greatest  personalities in Burmese history. As a Buddhist he was zealous even to  intolerance, since he forced the Shans and Moslims of the northern  districts, and indeed all his subjects, to make a formal profession of  Buddhism. He also, as related elsewhere, made not very successful  attempts to obtain the tooth relic from Ceylon. But it is probable  that his active patronage of the faith, as shown in the construction  and endowment of religious buildings, was exercised chiefly in Pegu  and this must be the reason why the Sasanavamsa (which is  interested chiefly in Upper Burma) says little about him.    His successors showed little political capacity but encouraged  religion and literature. The study of the Abhidhamma was specially  flourishing in the districts of Ava and Sagaing from about 1600 to  1650 and found many illustrious exponents. Besides works in Pali, the  writers of this time produced numerous Burmese translations and  paraphrases of Abhidhamma works, as well as edifying stories.    In the latter part of the seventeenth century Burma was in a disturbed  condition and the Sasanavamsa says that religion was dimmed as the  moon by clouds. A national and religious revival came with the  victories of Alompra (1752 onwards), but the eighteenth century also  witnessed the rise of a curious and not very edifying controversy  which divided the Sangha for about a hundred years and spread to  Ceylon.[162] It concerned the manner in which the upper robe of a  monk, consisting of a long piece of cloth, should be worn. The old  practice in Burma was to wrap this cloth round the lower body from the  loins to the ankles, and draw the end from the back over the left  shoulder and thence across the breast over the right shoulder so that  it finally hung loose behind. But about 1698 began the custom of  walking with the right shoulder bare, that is to say letting the end  of the robe fall down in front on the left side. The Sangha became  divided into two factions known as _Ekamsika_ (one-shouldered) and  _Parupana_ (fully clad). The bitterness of the seemingly trivial  controversy was increased by the fact that the Ekamsikas could  produce little scriptural warrant and appealed to late authorities or  the practice in Ceylon, thus neglecting sound learning. For the Vinaya  frequently[163] prescribes that the robe is to be adjusted so as to  fall over only one shoulder as a mark of special respect, which  implies that it was usually worn over both shoulders. In 1712 and  again about twenty years later arbitrators were appointed by the king  to hear both sides, but they had not sufficient authority or learning  to give a decided opinion. The stirring political events of 1740  and the following years naturally threw ecclesiastical quarrels into  the shade but when the great Alompra had disposed of his enemies he  appeared as a modern Asoka. The court religiously observed Uposatha  days and the king was popularly believed to be a Bodhisattva.[164] He  was not however sound on the great question of ecclesiastical dress.  His chaplain, Atula, belonged to the Ekamsika party and the king,  saying that he wished to go into the whole matter himself but had not  for the moment leisure, provisionally ordered the Sangha to obey  Atula's ruling. But some champions of the other side stood firm.  Alompra dealt leniently with them, but died during his Siamese  campaign before he had time to unravel the intricacies of the Vinaya.    The influence of Atula, who must have been an astute if not learned  man, continued after the king's death and no measures were taken  against the Ekamsikas, although King Hsin-byu-shin (1763-1776)  persecuted an heretical sect called Paramats.[165] His youthful  successor, Sing-gu-sa, was induced to hold a public disputation. The  Ekamsikas were defeated in this contest and a royal decree was  issued making the Parupana discipline obligatory. But the vexed  question was not settled for it came up again in the long reign  (1781-1819) of Bodopaya. This king has won an evil reputation for  cruelty and insensate conceit,[166] but he was a man of vigour and  kept together his great empire. His megalomania naturally detracted  from the esteem won by his piety. His benefactions to religion were  lavish, the shrines and monasteries which he built innumerable. But he  desired to build a pagoda larger than any in the world and during some  twenty years wasted an incalculable amount of labour and money on this  project, still commemorated by a gigantic but unfinished mass of  brickwork now in ruins. In order to supervise its erection he left his  palace and lived at Mingun, where he conceived the idea that he  was a Buddha, an idea which had not been entirely absent from the  minds of Alompra and Hsin-byu-shin. It is to the credit of the Theras  that, despite the danger of opposing an autocrat as cruel as he was  crazy, they refused to countenance these pretensions and the king  returned to his palace as an ordinary monarch.    If he could not make himself a Buddha, he at least disposed of the Ekamsika  dispute, and was probably influenced in his views by Nanabhivamsa, a monk  of the Parupana school whom he made his chaplain, although Atula was still  alive. At first he named a commission of enquiry, the result of which was  that the Ekamsikas admitted that their practice could not be justified from  the scriptures but only by tradition. A royal decree was issued enjoining  the observance of the Parupana discipline, but two years later Atula  addressed a letter to the king in which he maintained that the Ekamsika  costume was approved in a work called Culaganthipada, composed by  Moggalana, the immediate disciple of the Buddha. The king ordered  representatives of both parties to examine this contention and the debate  between them is dramatically described in the Sasanavamsa. It was  demonstrated that the text on which Atula relied was composed in Ceylon by  a thera named Moggalana who lived in the twelfth century and that it quoted  mediaeval Sinhalese commentaries. After this exposure the Ekamsika party  collapsed. The king commanded (1784) the Parupana discipline to be observed  and at last the royal order received obedience.    It will be observed that throughout this controversy both sides  appealed to the king, as if he had the right to decide the point in  dispute, but that his decision had no compelling power as long as it  was not supported by evidence. He could ensure toleration for views  regarded by many as heretical, but was unable to force the views of  one party on the other until the winning cause had publicly disproved  the contentions of its opponents. On the other hand the king had  practical control of the hierarchy, for his chaplain was _de facto_  head of the Church and the appointment was strictly personal. It was  not the practice for a king to take on his predecessor's chaplain and  the latter could not, like a Lamaist or Catholic ecclesiastic, claim  any permanent supernatural powers. Bodopaya did something towards  organizing the hierarchy for he appointed four elders of repute to  be Sangharajas or, so to speak, Bishops, with four more as  assistants and over them all his chaplain Nana as Archbishop.  Nana was a man of energy and lived in turn in various monasteries  supervising the discipline and studies.    In spite of the extravagances of Bodopaya, the Church was flourishing  and respected in his reign. The celebrated image called Mahamuni was  transferred from Arakan to his capital together with a Sanskrit  library, and Burma sent to Ceylon not only the monks who founded the  Amarapura school but also numerous Pali texts. This prosperity  continued in the reigns of Bagyidaw, Tharrawadi and Pagan-min, who  were of little personal account. The first ordered the compilation of  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1685"],[0,"The Mystery of the Yellow Room (#15)"],[1," to pray to Sainte-Genevieve, our good patroness, and the rest of the  time I have been lying on my bed. There was no one to care for me but  the Bete du bon Dieu!\"    \"Did she not leave you?\"    \"Neither by day nor by night.\"    \"Are you sure of that?\"    \"As I am of Paradise.\"    \"Then how was it, Madame Angenoux, that all through the night of the  murder nothing but the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu was heard?\"    Mother Angenoux planted herself in front of the forest-keeper and struck  the floor with her stick.    \"I don't know anything about it,\" she said. \"But shall I tell you  something? There are no two cats in the world that cry like that. Well,  on the night of the murder I also heard the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu  outside; and yet she was on my knees, and did not mew once, I swear. I  crossed myself when I heard that, as if I had heard the devil.\"    I looked at the keeper when he put the last question, and I am much  mistaken if I did not detect an evil smile on his lips. At that moment,  the noise of loud quarrelling reached us. We even thought we heard a  dull sound of blows, as if some one was being beaten. The Green Man  quickly rose and hurried to the door by the side of the fireplace; but  it was opened by the landlord who appeared, and said to the keeper:    \"Don't alarm yourself, Monsieur--it is my wife; she has the toothache.\"  And he laughed. \"Here, Mother Angenoux, here are some scraps for your  cat.\"    He held out a packet to the old woman, who took it eagerly and went out  by the door, closely followed by her cat.    \"Then you won't serve me?\" asked the Green Man.    Daddy Mathieu's face was placid and no longer retained its expression of  hatred.    \"I've nothing for you--nothing for you. Take yourself off.\"    The Green Man quietly refilled his pipe, lit it, bowed to us, and went  out. No sooner was he over the threshold than Daddy Mathieu slammed  the door after him and, turning towards us, with eyes bloodshot, and  frothing at the mouth, he hissed to us, shaking his clenched fist at the  door he had just shut on the man he evidently hated:    \"I don't know who you are who tell me 'We shall have to eat red  meat--now'; but if it will interest you to know it--that man is the  murderer!\"    With which words Daddy Mathieu immediately left us. Rouletabille  returned towards the fireplace and said:    \"Now we'll grill our steak. How do you like the cider?--It's a little  tart, but I like it.\"    We saw no more of Daddy Mathieu that day, and absolute silence reigned  in the inn when we left it, after placing five francs on the table in  payment for our feast.    Rouletabille at once set off on a three mile walk round Professor  Stangerson's estate. He halted for some ten minutes at the corner of a  narrow road black with soot, near to some charcoal-burners' huts in the  forest of Sainte-Genevieve, which touches on the road from Epinay to  Corbeil, to tell me that the murderer had certainly passed that way,  before entering the grounds and concealing himself in the little clump  of trees.    \"You don't think, then, that the keeper knows anything of it?\" I asked.    \"We shall see that, later,\" he replied. \"For the present I'm not  interested in what the landlord said about the man. The landlord hates  him. I didn't take you to breakfast at the Donjon Inn for the sake of  the Green Man.\"    Then Rouletabille, with great precaution glided, followed by me, towards  the little building which, standing near the park gate, served for the  home of the concierges, who had been arrested that morning. With the  skill of an acrobat, he got into the lodge by an upper window which had  been left open, and returned ten minutes later. He said only, \"Ah!\"--a  word which, in his mouth, signified many things.    We were about to take the road leading to the chateau, when a  considerable stir at the park gate attracted our attention. A carriage  had arrived and some people had come from the chateau to meet it.  Rouletabille pointed out to me a gentleman who descended from it.    \"That's the Chief of the Surete\" he said. \"Now we shall see what  Frederic Larsan has up his sleeve, and whether he is so much cleverer  than anybody else.\"    The carriage of the Chief of the Surete was followed by three other  vehicles containing reporters, who were also desirous of entering the  park. But two gendarmes stationed at the gate had evidently received  orders to refuse admission to anybody. The Chief of the Surete calmed  their impatience by undertaking to furnish to the press, that evening,  all the information he could give that would not interfere with the  judicial inquiry.          CHAPTER XI. In Which Frederic Larsan Explains How the Murderer Was Able  to Get Out of The Yellow Room      Among the mass of papers, legal documents, memoirs, and extracts from  newspapers, which I have collected, relating to the mystery of The  Yellow Room, there is one very interesting piece; it is a detail of the  famous examination which took place that afternoon, in the laboratory of  Professor Stangerson, before the Chief of the Surete. This narrative is  from the pen of Monsieur Maleine, the Registrar, who, like the examining  magistrate, had spent some of his leisure time in the pursuit of  literature. The piece was to have made part of a book which, however,  has never been published, and which was to have been entitled: \"My  Examinations.\" It was given to me by the Registrar himself, some time  after the astonishing denouement to this case, and is unique in judicial  chronicles.    Here it is. It is not a mere dry transcription of questions and answers,  because the Registrar often intersperses his story with his own personal  comments.                           THE REGISTRAR'S NARRATIVE    The examining magistrate and I (the writer relates) found ourselves in  The Yellow Room in the company of the builder who had constructed the  pavilion after Professor Stangerson's designs. He had a workman with  him. Monsieur de Marquet had had the walls laid entirely bare; that is  to say, he had had them stripped of the paper which had decorated them.  Blows with a pick, here and there, satisfied us of the absence of any  sort of opening. The floor and the ceiling were thoroughly sounded.  We found nothing. There was nothing to be found. Monsieur de Marquet  appeared to be delighted and never ceased repeating:    \"What a case! What a case! We shall never know, you'll see, how the  murderer was able to get out of this room!\"    Then suddenly, with a radiant face, he called to the officer in charge  of the gendarmes.    \"Go to the chateau,\" he said, \"and request Monsieur Stangerson and  Monsieur Robert Darzac to come to me in the laboratory, also Daddy  Jacques; and let your men bring here the two concierges.\"    Five minutes later all were assembled in the laboratory. The Chief of  the Surete, who had arrived at the Glandier, joined us at that moment.  I was seated at Monsieur Stangerson's desk ready for work, when Monsieur  de Marquet made us the following little speech--as original as it was  unexpected:    \"With your permission, gentlemen--as examinations lead to nothing--we  will, for once, abandon the old system of interrogation. I will not  have you brought before me one by one, but we will all remain here as we  are,--Monsieur Stangerson, Monsieur Robert Darzac, Daddy Jacques and the  two concierges, the Chief of the Surete, the Registrar, and myself. We  shall all be on the same footing. The concierges may, for the moment,  forget that they have been arrested. We are going to confer together. We  are on the spot where the crime was committed. We have nothing else to  discuss but the crime. So let us discuss it freely--intelligently or  otherwise, so long as we speak just what is in our minds. There need be  no formality or method since this won't help us in any way.\"    Then, passing before me, he said in a low voice:    \"What do you think of that, eh? What a scene! Could you have thought  of that? I'll make a little piece out of it for the Vaudeville.\" And he  rubbed his hands with glee.    I turned my eyes on Monsieur Stangerson. The hope he had received from  the doctor's latest reports, which stated that Mademoiselle Stangerson  might recover from her wounds, had not been able to efface from his  noble features the marks of the great sorrow that was upon him. He  had believed his daughter to be dead, and he was still broken by that  belief. His clear, soft, blue eyes expressed infinite sorrow. I had had  occasion, many times, to see Monsieur Stangerson at public ceremonies,  and from the first had been struck by his countenance, which seemed as  pure as that of a child--the dreamy gaze with the sublime and mystical  expression of the inventor and thinker.    On those occasions his daughter was always to be seen either following  him or by his side; for they never quitted each other, it was said, and  had shared the same labours for many years. The young lady, who was  then five and thirty, though she looked no more than thirty, had devoted  herself entirely to science. She still won admiration for her imperial  beauty which had remained intact, without a wrinkle, withstanding time  and love. Who would have dreamed that I should one day be seated by her  pillow with my papers, and that I should see her, on the point of death,  painfully recounting to us the most monstrous and most mysterious crime  I have heard of in my career? Who would have thought that I should be,  that afternoon, listening to the despairing father vainly trying to  explain how his daughter's assailant had been able to escape from him?  Why bury ourselves with our work in obscure retreats in the depths of  woods, if it may not protect us against those dangerous threats to life  which meet us in the busy cities?    \"Now, Monsieur Stangerson,\" said Monsieur de Marquet, with somewhat  of an important air, \"place yourself exactly where you were when"]]]
