There can be no mistake. But  don't lose it for your life! It's worth a sovereign to you!\"    The man, warming to my mood, cranked his engine rapidly and sprang to  the wheel. I was wild with excitement now, and fearful lest the cab  ahead should have disappeared; but fortune seemingly was with me for  once, and I was not twenty yards behind when Zarmi's cab turned the  first corner ahead. Through the gloomy street, which appeared to be  populated solely by streaming umbrellas, we went. I could scarcely  keep my seat; every nerve in my body seemed to be dancing--twitching.  Eternally I was peering ahead; and when, leaving the well-lighted West  End thoroughfares, we came to the comparatively gloomy streets of the  suburbs, a hundred times I thought we had lost the track. But always  in the pool of light cast by some friendly lamp, I would see the  quarry again speeding on before us.    At a lonely spot bordering the common the vehicle which contained  Zarmi stopped. I snatched up the speaking-tube.    \"Drive on,\" I cried, \"and pull up somewhere beyond! Not too far!\"    The man obeyed, and presently I found myself standing in what was now  become a steady downpour, looking back at the headlights of the other  cab. I gave the driver his promised reward.    \"Wait for ten minutes,\" I directed; \"then if I have not returned, you  need wait no longer.\"    I strode along the muddy, unpaved path, to the spot where the cab, now  discharged, was being slowly backed away into the road. The figure of  Zarmi, unmistakable by reason of the lithe carriage, was crossing in  the direction of a path which seemingly led across the common. I  followed at a discreet distance. Realizing the tremendous potentialities  of this rencontre I seemed to rise to the occasion; my brain became  alert and clear; every faculty was at its brightest. And I felt  serenely confident of my ability to make the most of the situation.    Zarmi went on and on along the lonely path. Not another pedestrian was  in sight, and the rain walled in the pair of us. Where comfort-loving  humanity sought shelter from the inclement weather, we two moved out  there in the storm, linked by a common enmity.    I have said that my every faculty was keen, and have spoken of my  confidence in my own alertness. My condition, as a matter of fact,  must have been otherwise, and this belief in my powers merely  symptomatic of the fever which consumed me; for, as I was to learn,  I had failed to take the first elementary precaution necessary in  such case. I, who tracked another, had not counted upon being tracked  myself! ...    A bag or sack, reeking of some sickly perfume, was dropped silently,  accurately, over my head from behind; it was drawn closely about my  throat. One muffled shriek, strangely compound of fear and execration,  I uttered. I was stifling, choking ... I staggered--and fell....        CHAPTER XVII    I MEET DR. FU-MANCHU      My next impression was of a splitting headache, which, as memory  remounted its throne, brought up a train of recollections. I found  myself to be seated upon a heavy wooden bench set flat against a wall,  which was covered with a kind of straw matting. My hands were firmly  tied behind me. In the first agony of that reawakening I became aware  of two things.    I was in an operating-room, for the most conspicuous item of its  furniture was an operating-table! Shaded lamps were suspended above  it; and instruments, antiseptics, dressings, etc., were arranged upon  a glass-topped table beside it. Secondly, I had a companion.    Seated upon a similar bench on the other side of the room, was a  heavily built man, his dark hair splashed with gray, as were his  short, neatly trimmed beard and mustache. He, too, was pinioned; and  he stared across the table with a glare in which a sort of stupefied  wonderment predominated, but which was not free from terror.    It was Sir Baldwin Frazer!    \"Sir Baldwin!\" I muttered, moistening my parched lips with my tongue--  \"Sir Baldwin!--how----\"    \"It is Dr. Petrie, is it not?\" he said, his voice husky with emotion.  \"Dr. Petrie!--my dear sir, in mercy tell me--what does this mean? I  have been kidnaped--drugged; made the victim of an inconceivable  outrage at the very door of my own house....\"    I stood up unsteadily.    \"Sir Baldwin,\" I interrupted, \"you ask me what it means. It means that  we are in the hands of Dr. Fu-Manchu!\"    Sir Baldwin stared at me wildly; his face was white and drawn with  anxiety.    \"Dr. Fu-Manchu!\" he said; \"but my dear sir, this name conveys nothing  to me--nothing!\" His manner momentarily was growing more distrait.  \"Since my captivity began I have been given the use of a singular  suite of rooms in this place, and received, I must confess, every  possible attention. I have been waited upon by the she-devil who  lured me here, but not one word other than a species of coarse  badinage has she spoken to me. At times I have been tempted to  believe that the fate which frequently befalls the specialist had  befallen me? You understand?\"    \"I quite understand,\" I replied dully. \"There have been times in the  past when I, too, have doubted my sanity in my dealings with the group  who now hold us in their power.\"    \"But,\" reiterated the other, his voice rising higher and higher,  \"what does it mean, my dear sir? It is incredible--fantastic! Even  now I find it difficult to disabuse my mind of that old, haunting  idea.\"    \"Disabuse it at once, Sir Baldwin,\" I said bitterly. \"The facts are  as you see them; the explanation, at any rate in your own case, is  quite beyond me. I was tracked ...\"    \"Hush! some one is coming!\"    We both turned and stared at an opening before which hung a sort of  gaudily embroidered mat, as the sound of dragging footsteps,  accompanied by a heavy tapping, announced the approach of _some one_.    The mat was pulled aside by Zarmi. She turned her head, flashing  around the apartment a glance of her black eyes, then held the  drapery aside to admit the entrance of another....    Supporting himself by the aid of two heavy walking sticks and  painfully dragging his gaunt frame along, _Dr. Fu-Manchu entered!_    I think I have never experienced in my life a sensation identical to  that which now possessed me. Although Nayland Smith had declared that  Fu-Manchu was alive, yet I would have sworn upon oath before any  jury summonable that he was dead; for with my own eyes I had seen  the bullet enter his skull. Now, whilst I crouched against the  matting-covered wall, teeth tightly clenched and my very hair  quivering upon my scalp, he dragged himself laboriously across the  room, the sticks going _tap--tap--tap_ upon the floor, and the tall  body, enveloped in a yellow robe, bent grotesquely, gruesomely, with  every effort which he made. He wore a surgical bandage about his  skull and its presence seemed to accentuate the height of the great  domelike brow, to throw into more evil prominence the wonderful,  Satanic countenance of the man. His filmed eyes turning to right and  left, he dragged himself to a wooden chair that stood beside the  operating-table and sank down upon it, breathing sibilantly,  exhaustedly.    Zarmi dropped the curtain and stood before it. She had discarded the  dripping overall which she had been wearing when I had followed her  across the common, and now stood before me with her black, frizzy  hair unconfined and her beautiful, wicked face uplifted in a sort of  cynical triumph. The big gold rings in her ears glittered strangely  in the light of the electric lamps. She wore a garment which looked  like a silken shawl wrapped about her in a wildly picturesque  fashion, and, her hands upon her hips, leant back against the curtain  glancing defiantly from Sir Baldwin to myself.    Those moments of silence which followed the entrance of the Chinese  Doctor live in my memory and must live there for ever. Only the  labored breathing of Fu-Manchu disturbed the stillness of the place.  Not a sound penetrated to the room, no one uttered a word; then--    \"Sir Baldwin Frazer.\" began Fu-Manchu in that indescribable voice,  alternating between the sibilant and the guttural, \"you were promised  a certain fee for your services by my servant who summoned you. It  shall be paid and the gift of my personal gratitude be added to it.\"    He turned himself with difficulty to address Sir Baldwin; and it  became apparent to me that he was almost completely paralyzed down  one side of his body. Some little use he could make of his hand and  arm, for he still clutched the heavy carven stick, but the right side  of his face was completely immobile; and rarely had I seen anything  more ghastly than the effect produced upon that wonderful, Satanic  countenance. The mouth, from the center of the thin lips, opened only  to the left, as he spoke; in a word, seen in profile from where I sat,  or rather crouched, it was the face of a dead man.    Sir Baldwin Frazer uttered no word, but, crouching upon the bench  even as I crouched, stared--horror written upon every lineament--at  Dr. Fu-Manchu. The latter continued:--    \"Your experience, Sir Baldwin, will enable you readily to diagnose my  symptoms. Owing to the passage of a bullet along a portion of the  third left frontal into the postero-parietal convolution--upon which,  from its lodgment in the skull, it continues to press--hemiplegia of  the right side has supervened. Aphasia is present also....\"    The effort of speech was ghastly. Beads of perspiration dewed  Fu-Manchu's brow, and I marveled at the iron will of the man, whereby  alone he forced his half-numbed brain to perform its function. He  seemed to select his words elaborately and by this monstrous effort  of will to compel his partially "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/180"],[0,"The 1994 CIA World Factbook (#15)"],[1," Armenians. This has left Armenia with only sporadic    deliveries of natural gas through unstable Georgia, while other fuel    and raw materials are in critical short supply.
