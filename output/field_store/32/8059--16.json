Captain Dacres was confident of his superiority, and had no doubt that  when the two frigates met the _Constitution_ would be compelled speedily  to strike her colors. He waited for the American to come up, each having  cleared for action.    A little after four o'clock the two exchanged broadsides, but they were  so far apart that no damage was done. Dacres manoeuvred for a raking  position, but Hull would not permit it, nor could he obtain one for  himself. There was much wearing and manoeuvring, which prevented the  firing on either side from being effective. Each was wary of the other  and took the utmost pains to prevent his securing any advantage.    When it became certain that the battle was to be one at close range,  Hull ordered the firing to cease, in order that the fullest preparation  could be made for the next broadside. He knew the skill of his men in  marksmanship, and determined to hold his fire until the most  advantageous position was reached. As he drew near his enemy, the latter  continued firing, and some of her shots were so effective that the crews  cheered. The Americans, most of them barefooted and stripped to the  waist, were standing beside their guns eager and impatient for the order  to fire, but Hull, when appealed to, shook his head. It was a proof of  the fine discipline of the American crew that when they saw two of their  comrades killed by the fire of the enemy, they silently waited without  murmur for the order whose delay they could not comprehend.    Not until about a hundred feet distant and in the exact position desired  did Captain Hull give the order to fire as the guns bore. To quote  Maclay: \"In an instant the frigate belched forth a storm of iron hail  that carried death and destruction into the opposing ship. The effect of  this carefully aimed broadside at short range was terrific. The  splinters were seen to fly over the British frigate like a cloud, some  of them reaching as high as the mizzen top, while the cheers of her men  abruptly ceased and the shrieks and groans of the wounded were heard.  The Americans had struck their first earnest blow, and it was a  staggering one. The Englishman felt its full weight, and perhaps for the  first time realized that this was no child's play.\"    The Americans displayed remarkable skill in their gunnery, as it may be  said they have always done. The main yard of the enemy was shot away in  the slings, and hull, rigging and sails were badly mangled. A shot  passing through the mizzenmast close to the deck, added to the stress  from the sails, caused it to break in two and fall over the quarter. One  curious effect of this dragging in the water was to make the wreckage  act like a rudder, bringing her up to the wind in spite of the  opposition of the helm. While the damage on the _Constitution_ was less,  it clogged her action, but she secured a position from which she  delivered two raking broadsides. Then as the vessel see-sawed, the  jibboom of the _Guerriere_ crossed the _Constitution's_ quarter deck.  Both crews made ready to board, but each found the other so fully  prepared that neither attempted it. Meanwhile the riflemen in the  rigging were working with destructive energy. In each of the  _Constitution's_ tops were seven marines, six loading for the seventh,  who was the best marksman. A good many officers were wounded and killed  on both sides.    [Illustration: THE \"CONSTITUTION\" AND THE \"GUERRIERE.\"]    Although the vessels had been lashed together, their lurching broke  them apart, and the Englishman gained a chance to use his broadsides. A  fire broke out on the _Constitution_, but it was quickly extinguished,  and the shot of the American soon made a complete wreck of the enemy.  When it became clear that the _Guerriere_ could make no further  resistance, Captain Hull drew off to repair the damages to his own ship.  Another English frigate was likely to appear at any moment, and she  would make short work of the _Constitution_ in her crippled condition.  It took but a short time to complete the work, when she returned to her  former position beside the wallowing _Guerriere_. A lieutenant was sent  on board to receive the surrender, which Dacres gave with painful  reluctance. When brought to the side of the _Constitution_, Hull  assisted him up the rope ladder. Dacres extended his sword.    \"No\" replied Hull, \"I will not take it from one who knows so well how to  use it, but I must trouble you to pay me that hat I have won.\"          CHAPTER XII.    Jacob Jones--The _Wasp_ and the _Frolic_--James Biddle--The _Hornet_ and  the _Penguin_--A Narrow Escape.        I must now tell you something about another gallant young officer who  entered the American navy at the close of the century, when he was  hardly thirty years old. He was Jacob Jones, who lived until 1850. He  was a lieutenant on the _Philadelphia_ for two years, and was with that  frigate when she ran on the rocks in the harbor of Tripoli. He was given  command of the 18-gun sloop of war _Wasp_, which sailed from the  Delaware in October, 1812, and headed eastward, with the intention of  intercepting some of the enemy's merchantmen plying between Great  Britain and the West Indies.    About a week after sailing he sighted five merchantmen, several of which  were well armed, while all were convoyed by a brig of war. Jones stood  toward them, when the brig signalled to her companions to make all sail  before the wind, while she dropped back to attend to the stranger. The  American came up quite close, and hailing, demanded the name of the  other. For a reply, the brig lowered the Spanish colors, ran up the  British flag, and let fly with a broadside and volley of musketry.    The _Wasp_ was expecting something of that nature and returned the  compliment, the vessels working nearer each other and firing as rapidly  as possible. The action had hardly begun when the _Wasp_ lost her main  topmast, and a few minutes later the mizzen topgallant mast and the gaff  were shot away. These mishaps so crippled her that she became almost  unmanageable. The _Frolic_, as the enemy was named, was also damaged,  but not so badly as the _Wasp_, but, unfortunately for the _Frolic_, the  heavy sea and the twisting about of the hull threw her into position to  be raked by the _Wasp_, and Captain Jones was quick to seize the  advantage, the vessels being so close that the ramrods were pushed  against each other's sides while the gunners were loading. The sea was  so heavy that the guns of the _Wasp_ frequently dipped under water.    The intention of the Americans was to board, and Lieutenant James Biddle  held himself and men ready to take instant advantage of the moment the  roll of the sea brought them near enough to do so.    Captain Jones did not believe himself warranted in boarding, since he  held the advantage of position, and he issued orders for the men to  wait, but their ardor could not be checked. Among his sailors was one  who had been impressed into the British service, where he was brutally  treated. Springing upon his gun, he grasped the bowsprit of the brig,  swung himself upon the spar and ran as nimbly as a monkey to the deck of  the enemy. Imitating his enthusiasm, Lieutenant Biddle and his boarders  took advantage of a favorable lurch at that moment and sprang upon the  deck of the _Frolic_. There, every man stopped and repressed the cheer  that rose to his lips, for the scene was one of the most dreadful that  imagination can picture.    The quartermaster stood grimly clutching the wheel, a lieutenant,  bleeding from several wounds, was leaning against the companionway,  unable to stand without its support, while all along the deck were  strewn the dead and dying. Silently the victors stepped over the  prostrate forms to the quarter deck, where the officer weakly dropped  his sword to signify his surrender. Lieutenant Biddle walked to where  the colors were still fluttering and pulled them down. A few minutes  later the mainmast and foremast fell.    Maclay gives the strength of the two vessels as follows: _Wasp_, 18  guns, _Frolic_, 22; crew of the _Wasp_, 138, of the _Frolic_, 110. On  the _Wasp_ 5 were killed and 5 wounded; on the _Frolic_ 15 were killed  and 47 wounded, the latter being completely riddled. The cause of this  frightful difference in results was brought about by the Americans  discharging their broadsides when their ship was on the downward roll,  the shot landing in the hull of the enemy, while the latter fired on the  rise, her broadsides mainly passing into and through the rigging.    As soon as Captain Jones learned of the fearful plight of the Frolic he  sent his surgeon on board, and everything possible was done to assist  the sorely smitten enemy.    The _Wasp_ was so badly injured that Captain Jones gave his attention to  repairing her, and was thus engaged when a sail appeared. It proved to  be the British 74-gun ship of the line _Poictiers_, which, surmising  what had taken place, bore down, took possession of both ships and  carried them to Bermuda.    This battle, one of the most fiercely contested of the war, naturally  caused much rejoicing throughout the United States. Congress voted  $25,000 to the officers and crew of the _Wasp_ as prize money, and gave  a gold medal to Master-Commandant Jones and a silver one to each of his  officers, while the Legislature of Pennsylvania presented a sword to  Lieutenant James Biddle.    This gallant young officer is entitled to more notice than has been  given him. He was born in Philadelphia in 1783, and died in 1848. After  his exchange, he was appointed to the command of the _Hornet_, and  sailed from New York in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1726"],[0,"Theaetetus (#15)"],[1,"of position or circumlocution to become the  expression of individuals or particulars. And sometimes by using words  as symbols we are able to give a 'local habitation and a name' to the  infinite and inconceivable.    Thus we see that no line can be drawn between the powers of sense and  of reflection--they pass imperceptibly into one another. We may indeed  distinguish between the seeing and the closed eye--between the sensation  and the recollection of it. But this distinction carries us a very  little way, for recollection is present in sight as well as sight  in recollection. There is no impression of sense which does not  simultaneously recall differences of form, number, colour, and the like.  Neither is such a distinction applicable at all to our internal bodily  sensations, which give no sign of themselves when unaccompanied with  pain, and even when we are most conscious of them, have often no  assignable place in the human frame. Who can divide the nerves or great  nervous centres from the mind which uses them? Who can separate the  pains and pleasures of the mind from the pains and pleasures of the  body? The words 'inward and outward,' 'active and passive,' 'mind and  body,' are best conceived by us as differences of degree passing into  differences of kind, and at one time and under one aspect acting in  harmony and then again opposed. They introduce a system and order into  the knowledge of our being; and yet, like many other general terms, are  often in advance of our actual analysis or observation.    According to some writers the inward sense is only the fading away or  imperfect realization of the outward. But this leaves out of sight one  half of the phenomenon. For the mind is not only withdrawn from  the world of sense but introduced to a higher world of thought and  reflection, in which, like the outward sense, she is trained and  educated. By use the outward sense becomes keener and more intense,  especially when confined within narrow limits. The savage with little  or no thought has a quicker discernment of the track than the civilised  man; in like manner the dog, having the help of scent as well as of  sight, is superior to the savage. By use again the inward thought  becomes more defined and distinct; what was at first an effort is made  easy by the natural instrumentality of language, and the mind learns to  grasp universals with no more exertion than is required for the sight of  an outward object. There is a natural connexion and arrangement of them,  like the association of objects in a landscape. Just as a note or two of  music suffices to recall a whole piece to the musician's or composer's  mind, so a great principle or leading thought suggests and arranges a  world of particulars. The power of reflection is not feebler than the  faculty of sense, but of a higher and more comprehensive nature. It not  only receives the universals of sense, but gives them a new content by  comparing and combining them with one another. It withdraws from the  seen that it may dwell in the unseen. The sense only presents us with  a flat and impenetrable surface: the mind takes the world to pieces and  puts it together on a new pattern. The universals which are detached  from sense are reconstructed in science. They and not the mere  impressions of sense are the truth of the world in which we live; and  (as an argument to those who will only believe 'what they can hold in  their hands') we may further observe that they are the source of our  power over it. To say that the outward sense is stronger than the  inward is like saying that the arm of the workman is stronger than the  constructing or directing mind.    Returning to the senses we may briefly consider two questions--first  their relation to the mind, secondly, their relation to outward  objects:--    1. The senses are not merely 'holes set in a wooden horse' (Theaet.),  but instruments of the mind with which they are organically connected.  There is no use of them without some use of words--some natural or  latent logic--some previous experience or observation. Sensation, like  all other mental processes, is complex and relative, though apparently  simple. The senses mutually confirm and support one another; it is hard  to say how much our impressions of hearing may be affected by those  of sight, or how far our impressions of sight may be corrected by the  touch, especially in infancy. The confirmation of them by one another  cannot of course be given by any one of them. Many intuitions which are  inseparable from the act of sense are really the result of complicated  reasonings. The most cursory glance at objects enables the experienced  eye to judge approximately of their relations and distance, although  nothing is impressed upon the retina except colour, including gradations  of light and shade. From these delicate and almost imperceptible  differences we seem chiefly to derive our ideas of distance and  position. By comparison of what is near with what is distant we learn  that the tree, house, river, etc. which are a long way off are objects  of a like nature with those which are seen by us in our immediate  neighbourhood, although the actual impression made on the eye is very  different in one case and in the other. This is a language of 'large and  small letters' (Republic), slightly differing in form and exquisitely  graduated by distance, which we are learning all our life long, and  which we attain in various degrees according to our powers of sight or  observation. There is nor the consideration. The greater or less strain  upon the nerves of the eye or ear is communicated to the mind and  silently informs the judgment. We have also the use not of one eye only,  but of two, which give us a wider range, and help us to discern, by the  greater or less acuteness of the angle which the rays of sight form,  the distance of an object and its relation to other objects. But we are  already passing beyond the limits of our actual knowledge on a subject  which has given rise to many conjectures. More important than the  addition of another conjecture is the observation, whether in the case  of sight or of any other sense, of the great complexity of the causes  and the great simplicity of the effect.    The sympathy of the mind and the ear is no less striking than  the sympathy of the mind and the eye. Do we not seem to perceive  instinctively and as an act of sense the differences of articulate  speech and of musical notes? Yet how small a part of speech or of music  is produced by the impression of the ear compared with that which is  furnished by the mind!    Again: the more refined faculty of sense, as in animals so also in man,  seems often to be transmitted by inheritance. Neither must we forget  that in the use of the senses, as in his whole nature, man is a social  being, who is always being educated by language, habit, and the teaching  of other men as well as by his own observation. He knows distance  because he is taught it by a more experienced judgment than his own; he  distinguishes sounds because he is told to remark them by a person of  a more discerning ear. And as we inherit from our parents or other  ancestors peculiar powers of sense or feeling, so we improve and  strengthen them, not only by regular teaching, but also by sympathy and  communion with other persons.    2. The second question, namely, that concerning the relation of the mind  to external objects, is really a trifling one, though it has been made  the subject of a famous philosophy. We may if we like, with Berkeley,  resolve objects of sense into sensations; but the change is one of name  only, and nothing is gained and something is lost by such a resolution  or confusion of them. For we have not really made a single step towards  idealism, and any arbitrary inversion of our ordinary modes of speech is  disturbing to the mind. The youthful metaphysician is delighted at his  marvellous discovery that nothing is, and that what we see or feel is  our sensation only: for a day or two the world has a new interest to  him; he alone knows the secret which has been communicated to him by the  philosopher, that mind is all--when in fact he is going out of his mind  in the first intoxication of a great thought. But he soon finds that  all things remain as they were--the laws of motion, the properties of  matter, the qualities of substances. After having inflicted his theories  on any one who is willing to receive them 'first on his father and  mother, secondly on some other patient listener, thirdly on his dog,'  he finds that he only differs from the rest of mankind in the use of a  word. He had once hoped that by getting rid of the solidity of matter he  might open a passage to worlds beyond. He liked to think of the world as  the representation of the divine nature, and delighted to imagine angels  and spirits wandering through space, present in the room in which he is  sitting without coming through the door, nowhere and everywhere at the  same instant. At length he finds that he has been the victim of his own  fancies; he has neither more nor less evidence of the supernatural than  he had before. He himself has become unsettled, but the laws of the  world remain fixed as at the beginning. He has discovered that his  appeal to the fallibility of sense was really an illusion. For whatever  uncertainty there may be in the appearances of nature, arises only out  of the imperfection or variation of the human senses, or possibly from  the deficiency of certain branches of knowledge; when science is able to  apply her tests, the uncertainty is at an end. We are apt sometimes  to think that moral and metaphysical philosophy are lowered by the  influence which is exercised over them by physical science. But any  interpretation of nature by physical science is far in advance of such  idealism. The philosophy of Berkeley, while giving unbounded license to  the"]]]
