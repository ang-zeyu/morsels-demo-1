I could never have imagined anything worse. It was  fearfully cold, and the hospital was not heated at all, for there was no  wood or coal in Lodz, and for the same reason the gas-jets gave out only  the faintest glimmer of light. There was no clean linen, and the poor  fellows were lying there still in their verminous, blood-soaked shirts,  shivering with cold, as we had only one small blanket each for them.  They were lucky if they had a bed at all, for many were lying with only  a little straw between them and the cold stone floor. There were no  basins or towels or anything to wash up with, and no spittoons, so the  men were spitting all over the already filthy floor. In the largest ward  where there were seventy or eighty men lying, there was a lavatory  adjoining which had got blocked up, and a thin stream of dirty water  trickled under the door and meandered in little rivulets all over the  room. The smell was awful, as some of the men had been there already  several days without having had their dressings done.    This was the state in which the hospital had been handed over to us. It  was a military hospital whose staff had had orders to leave at four  o'clock that morning, and they handed the whole hospital with its 270  patients over to us just as it was; and we could do very little towards  making it more comfortable for them. The stench of the whole place was  horrible, but it was too cold to do more than open the window for a  minute or two every now and then. It was no one's fault that things were  in such a horrible condition--it was just the force of circumstances and  the fortune of war that the place had been taxed far beyond its possible  capacities.    All night long the most terribly wounded men were being brought in from  the field, some were already dead when they arrived, others had only a  few minutes to live; all the rest were very cold and wet and exhausted,  and we had _nothing_ to make them comfortable. What a blessing hot-water  bottles would have been--but after all there would have been no hot  water to fill them if we had had them. But the wounded _had_ to be  brought in for shelter somewhere, and at least we had a roof over their  heads, and hot tea to give them.    At 5 A. M. there came a lull. The tragic procession ceased for  a while, and we went to lie down. At seven o'clock we were called  again--another batch of wounded was being brought in.    The shelling had begun again, and was terrific; crash, crash, over our  heads the whole time. A clock-tower close to the hospital was demolished  and windows broken everywhere. The shells were bursting everywhere in  the street, and civilians were being brought in to us severely wounded.  A little child was carried in with half its head blown open, and then an  old Jewish woman with both legs blown off, and a terrible wound in her  chest, who only lived an hour or two. Apparently she suffered no pain,  but was most dreadfully agitated, poor old dear, at having lost her wig  in the transit. They began bringing in so many that we had to stop  civilians being brought in at all, as it was more than we could do to  cope with the wounded soldiers that were being brought in all the time.    At midday we went to a hotel for a meal. There was very, very little  food left in Lodz, but they brought what they could. Coming back to the  hospital we tried everywhere to get some bread, but there was none to be  had anywhere--all the provision shops were quite empty, and the  inhabitants looked miserable and starved, the Jewish population  particularly so, though they were probably not among the poorest.    On our way back a shell burst quite close to us in the street, but no  one was hurt. These shells make a most horrible scream before bursting,  like an animal in pain. Ordinarily I am the most dreadful coward in the  world about loud noises--I even hate a sham thunderstorm in a  theatre--but here somehow the shells were so part of the whole thing  that one did not realize that all this was happening to _us_, one felt  rather like a disinterested spectator at a far-off dream. It was  probably partly due to want of sleep; one's hands did the work, but  one's mind was mercifully numbed. Mercifully, for it was more like hell  than anything I can imagine. The never-ending processions of groaning  men being brought in on those horrible blood-soaked stretchers,  suffering unimagined tortures, the filth, the cold, the stench, the  hunger, the vermin, and the squalor of it all, added to one's utter  helplessness to do more than very little to relieve their misery, was  almost enough to make even Satan weep.    On the third day after our arrival a young Russian doctor and some  Russian sisters arrived to relieve us for a few hours, and we most  thankfully went to bed--at least it was not a bed in the ordinary sense,  but a wire bedstead on which we lay down in all our clothes; but we were  very comfortable all the same.    When we woke up we were told that the military authorities had given  orders for the patients to be evacuated, and that Red Cross carts were  coming all night to take them away to the station, where some ambulance  trains awaited them. So we worked hard all night to get the dressings  done before the men were sent away, and as we finished each case, he was  carried down to the hall to await his turn to go; but it was very  difficult as all the time they were bringing in fresh cases as fast as  they were taking the others away, and alas! many had to go off without  having had their dressings done at all. The next afternoon we were  still taking in, when we got another order that all the fresh patients  were to be evacuated and the hospital closed, as the Russians had  decided to retire from Lodz. Again we worked all night, and by ten the  next morning we had got all the patients away. The sanitars collected  all the bedding in the yard to be burnt, the bedsteads were piled high  on one another, and we opened all the windows wide to let the clean cold  wind blow over everything.    We had all our own dressings and equipment to pack, and were all just  about at our last gasp from want of food and sleep, when a very kind  Polish lady came and carried princess, we two Sisters, and Colonel S.  off to her house, where she had prepared bedrooms for us. I never looked  forward to anything so much in my life as I did to my bed that night.  Our hostess simply heaped benefits on us by preparing us each a hot bath  in turn. We had not washed or had our clothes off since we came to Lodz,  and were covered with vermin which had come to us from the patients; men  and officers alike suffer terribly from this plague of insects, which  really do make one's life a burden. There are three varieties commonly  met with: ordinary fleas that no one minds in the least; white insects  that are the commonest and live in the folds of one's clothes, whose  young are most difficult to find, and who grow middle-aged and very  hungry in a single night; and, lastly, the red insects with a good many  legs, which are much less numerous but much more ravenous than the other  kinds.    After the bath and the hunt, we sat down to a delicious supper, and were  looking forward to a still more delicious night in bed, when suddenly  Prince V. arrived and said we must leave at once. We guessed instantly  that the Germans must be very near, but that he did not wish us to ask  questions, as it seemed very mean to go off ourselves and leave our kind  hosts without a word of explanation, though of course we could only obey  orders. So we left our unfinished supper and quickly collected our  belongings and took them to the hotel where our Red Cross car should  have been waiting for us. But the Red Cross authorities had sent off our  car with some wounded, which of course was just as it should be, and we  were promised another \"seechas,\" which literally translated signifies  \"immediately,\" but in Russia means to-day or to-morrow or not at all.    \"Let us come into the hotel and get a meal while we wait,\" suggested the  Prince, mindful of our uneaten supper, and we followed him to the  restaurant--still mourning those beautiful beds we had left behind us,  and so tired we didn't much care whether the Germans came or not.  Nothing can express utter desolation much more nakedly than a Grand  Hotel that has been through a week or two's bombardment. Here indeed  were the mighty fallen. A large hole was ripped out of the wall of the  big restaurant, close to the alcove where the band used to play while  the smart people dined. An elaborate wine-list still graced each little  table, but coffee made from rye bread crusts mixed with a little chicory  was the only drink that a few white-faced waiters who crept about the  room like shadows could apologetically offer us. We sat there till  nearly 3 A. M., and Colonel S., utterly worn out, was fast  asleep with his head on the little table, and there was no sign of any  car, or of any Germans, so we went to lie down till morning.    In the morning things began to look cheerful. The Germans had still not  arrived, our own car turned up, and best of all the Prince heard  officially that every wounded man who was at all transportable had now  been successfully got out of Lodz. It was a gigantic task, this  evacuation of over 18,000 wounded in four days, and it is a great  feather in the Russian cap to have achieved it so successfully.    It was a most lovely day with a soft blue sky, and all the world bathed  in winter sunshine. Shelling had ceased during the night, but began  again with terrific force in the morning, and we started off under a  perfect hail of shells. There were four German aeroplanes hovering just  above us, throwing down bombs at short intervals. The shells aimed at  them looked so innocent, like little white puff-balls bursting up in the  blue sky. We hoped"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17594"],[0,"Lectures on Language, as Particularly Connected with English Grammar. (#15)"],[1,"signifies _joined_ or _united_. It is used to  show that two things are some how joined together so that they are spoke  of in connexion. It frequently occurs in common conversation, as a verb  and noun, but not as frequently in the books as formerly. The farmer  says to his _hired_ man, \"Go and get a _withe_ and come and _withe_ up  the fence;\" that is, get some pliant twigs of tough wood, twist them  together, and _withe_ or bind them round these posts, so that one may  stand firm _with_, or _withed_ to, the other. A book _with_ a cover, is  one that has a cover _joined_, bound, or attached to it. \"A father  _with_ a son, a man _with_ an estate, a nation _with_ a constitution.\"  In all such cases _with_ expresses the relation between the two things  mentioned, produced by a _union_ or connexion with each other.[6]    =In= is used in the same way. It is still retained as a noun and is  suspended on the signs of many public houses. \"The traveller's _inn_,\"  is a house where travellers _in_ themselves, or go _in_, for  entertainment. It occurs frequently in Shakspeare and in more modern  writers, as a verb, and is still used in common conversation as an  imperative. \"Go, _in_ the crops of grain.\" \"_In_ with you.\" \"_In_ with  it.\" In describes one thing by its relation to another, which is the  business of adjectives. It admits of the regular degrees of comparison;  as, _in_, _inner_, _innermost_ or _inmost_. It also has its compounds.  _In_step, the _inner_ part of the foot, _in_let, _in_vestment,  _in_heritance. In this capacity it is extensively used under its  different shades of meaning which I cannot stop to notice.    =Of= signifies _divided_, _separated_, or _parted_. \"The ship is _off_  the coast.\" \"I am bound _off_, and you are bound _out_.\" \"A part _of_ a  pencil,\" is that part which is _separated_ from the rest, implying that  the act of _separating_, or _offing_, has taken place. \"A branch _of_  the tree.\" There is the tree; this branch is from it. \"Our communication  was broken _off_ several years ago.\" \"Sailors record their _off_ings,  and parents love their _off_spring,\" or those children which sprung  from them.[7] \"We also _are his offspring_;\" that is, sprung from  God.[8] In all these, and every other case, you will perceive the  meaning of the word, and its office will soon appear essential in the  expression of thought. Had all the world been a compact whole, nothing  ever separated from it, we could never speak of a part _of_ it, for we  could never have such an idea. But we look at things, as separated,  divided, parted; and speak of one thing as separated from the others.  Hence, when we speak of the part of the earth we inhabit, we, in  imagination, separate it from some other _part_, or the general whole.  We can not use this word in reference to a thing which is indivisible,  because we can conceive no idea of a part _of_ an indivisible thing. We  do not say, a portion _of_ our mind taken as a whole, but as capable of  division. A share _of_ our regards, supposes that the remainder is  reserved for something else.    =Out=, out_er_ or utter, outer_most_ or utmost, admits of the same  remark as _in_.           *       *       *       *       *    In this manner, we might explain a long list of words, called adverbs,  conjunctions, and prepositions. But I forbear, for the present, the  further consideration of this subject, and leave it for another lecture.          LECTURE VII.    ON ADJECTIVES.        Adjectives.--How formed.--The syllable _ly_.--Formed from proper      nouns.--The apostrophe and letter _s_.--Derived from pronouns.--      Articles.--_A_ comes from _an_.--_In_definite.--_The_.--Meaning of      _a_ and _the_.--Murray's example.--That.--What.--\"Pronoun      adjectives.\"--_Mon_, _ma_.--Degrees of comparison.--Secondary      adjectives.--Prepositions admit of comparison.      We resume the consideration of Adjectives. The importance of this class  of words in the expression of our thoughts, is my excuse for bestowing  upon it so much labor. Had words always been used according to their  primitive meaning, there would be little danger of being misunderstood.  But the fact long known, \"_Verba mutanter_\"--words change--has been the  prolific source of much of the diversity of opinion, asperity of  feeling, and apparent misconstruction of other's sentiments, which has  disturbed society, and disgraced mankind. I have, in a former lecture,  alluded to this point, and call it up in this place to prepare your  minds to understand what is to be said on the secondary use of words in  the character of adjectives.    I have already spoken of adjectives in general, as derived from nouns  and verbs, and was somewhat particular upon the class sometimes called  _prepositions_, which describe one thing by its relation to another,  produced by some action which has placed them in such relation. We will  now pass to examine a little more minutely into the character and use  of certain adjectives, and the manner of their derivation.    We commence with those derived from nouns, both common and proper, which  are somewhat peculiar in their character. I wish you distinctly to bear  in mind the use of adjectives. They are words _added to nouns to define  or describe them_.    Many words which name things, are used as adjectives, with out change;  as, _ox_ beef, _beef_ cattle, _paper_ books, _straw_ hats, _bonnet_  paper. Others admit of change, or addition; as, nation_al_ character, a  merci_ful_ (mercy-_ful_) man, a gloom_y_ prospect, a fam_ous_ horse, a  gold_en_ ball. The syllables which are added, are parts of words, which  are at first compounded with them, till, by frequency of use, they are  incorporated into the same word. \"A merci_ful_ man\" is one who is full  of mercy. A gold_en_ ball is one made of gold. This word is sometimes  used without change; as, a _gold_ ring.    A numerous portion of these words take the syllable _ly_, contracted  from _like_, which is still retained in many words; as, Judas-_like_,  lady-_like_, gentleman-_like_. These two last words, are of late,  occasionally used as other words, lady_ly_, gentleman_ly_; but the last  more frequently than the former. She behaved very ladi_ly_, or  lady_like_; and his appearance was quite gentleman_ly_. But to say  ladi_ly_ appearance, does not yet sound quite soft enough; but it is  incorrect only because it is uncommon. God_ly_ and god_like_ are both in  use, and equally correct, with a nice shade of difference in meaning.    All grammarians have found a difficulty in the word _like_, which they  were unable to unravel. They could never account for its use in  expressing a relation between two objectives. They forgot that to be  like, one thing must be _likened_ to another, and that it was the very  meaning of this word to express such like_ness_. John looks _like_ his  brother. The looks, the countenance, or appearance of John, are  _likened_ to his brother's looks or appearance. \"This machine is more  like the pattern than any I have seen.\" Here the adjective _like_ takes  the comparative degree, as it is called, to show a nearer resemblance  than has been before observed between the things compared. \"He has a  statesman-_like_ appearance.\" I _like_ this apple, because it agrees  with my taste; it has qualities _like_ my notion of what is palateable.\"  In every situation the word is used to express likeness between two  things. It describes one thing by its likeness to another.    Many adjectives are formed from proper nouns by adding an apostrophe and  the letter _s_, except when the word ends in _s_, in which case the  final _s_ is usually omitted for the sake of euphony. This, however, was  not generally adopted by old writers. It is not observed in the earliest  translations of the Bible into the english language. It is now in common  practice. Thus, Montgomery's monument in front of St. Paul's church;  Washington's funeral; Shay's rebelion; England's bitterest foes;  Hamlet's father's ghost; Peter's wife's mother; Todd's, Walker's,  Johnson's dictionary; Winchell's Watts' hymns; Pond's Murray's grammar.  No body would suppose that the \"relation of property or possession\" was  expressed in these cases, as our grammar books tell us, but that the  terms employed are used to _define_ certain objects, about which we are  speaking. They possess the true character and use of adjectives, and as  such let them be regarded. It must be as false as frivolous to say that  Montgomery, who nobly fell at the siege of Quebec, _owns_ the monument  erected over his remains, which were conveyed to New-York many years  after his death; or that St. Paul _owns_ or _possesses_ the church  beneath which they were deposited; that Hamlet owned his father, and his  father his ghost; that Todd owns Walker, and Walker owns Johnson, and  Johnson his dictionary which may have had a hundred owners, and never  been the property of its author, but printed fifty years after his  death. These words, I repeat, are merely _definitive_ terms, and like  others serve to point out or specify particular objects which may thus  be better known.    Words, however, in common use form adjectives the same as other words;  as, Russia iron, China ships, India silks, Vermont cheese, Orange county  butter, New-York flour, Carolina potatoes. Morocco leather was first  manufactured in a city of Africa called by that name, but it is now made  in almost every town in our country. The same may be said of Leghorn  hats, Russia binding, French shoes, and China ware. Although made in our  own country we still retain the words, morocco, leghorn, russia, french,  and china, to define the fashion, kind, or quality of articles to which  we allude. Much china ware is made in Liverpool, which, to distinguish  it from the real, is called liverpool china. Many french shoes are made  in Lynn, and many Roxbury russets, Newton pippins, and Rhode-Island  greenings, grow in Vermont."]]]
