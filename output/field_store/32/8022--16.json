At present we see it to great  disadvantage; and if notwithstanding this it has any beauties, we may  fairly conclude it would have come much nearer perfection, if the  story, begun with so much spirit, had been brought to an end upon the  author's plan.    Mr. Hobbes, the famous philosopher of Malmsbury, in a letter printed  in his works, affirms, 'that he never yet saw a poem that had so much  shape of art, health of morality and vigour, and beauty of expression,  as this of our author; and in an epistle to the honourable Edward  Howard, author of the British Princes, he thus speaks. My judgment in  poetry has been once already censured by very good wits for commending  Gondibert; but yet have they not disabled my testimony. For what  authority is there in wit? a jester may have it; a man in drink may  have it, and be fluent over night, and wise and dry in the morning:  What is it? and who can tell whether it be better to have it or no? I  will take the liberty to praise what I like as well as they, and  reprehend what they like.'--Mr. Rymer in his preface to his  translation of Rapin's Reflexions on Aristototle's [sic] Treatise of  Poetry, observes, that our author's wit is well known, and in the  preface to that poem, there appears some strokes of an extraordinary  judgment; that he is for unbeaten tracts, and new ways of thinking,  but certainly in the untried seas he is no great discoverer. One  design of the Epic poets before him was to adorn their own country,  there finding their heroes and patterns of virtue, where example, as  they thought, would have the greater influence and power over  posterity; \"but this poet, says Rymer, steers a different course; his  heroes are all foreigners; he cultivates a country that is nothing  a-kin to him, and Lombardy reaps the honour of all. Other poets chose  some action or hero so illustrious, that the name of the poem prepared  the reader, and made way for its reception; but in this poem none can  divine what great action he intended to celebrate, nor is the reader  obliged to know whether the hero be Turk or Christian; nor do the  first lines give any light or prospect into the design. Altho' a poet  should know all arts and sciences, yet ought he discreetly to manage  his knowledge. He must have a judgment to select what is noble and  beautiful, and proper for the occasion. He must by a particular  chemistry, extract the essence of things; without soiling his wit with  dross or trumpery. The sort of verse Davenant makes choice of in his  Gondibert might contribute much to the vitiating his stile; for  thereby he obliges himself to stretch every period to the end of four  lines: Thus the sense is broken perpetually with parentheses, the  words jumbled in confusion, and darkness spread over all; but it must  be acknowledged, that Davenant had a particular talent for the  manners; his thoughts are great, and there appears something roughly  noble thro' the whole.\" This is the substance of Rymer's observations  on Gondibert. Rymer was certainly a scholar, and a man of discernment;  and tho' in some parts of the criticisms he is undoubtedly right, yet  in other parts he is demonstrably wrong. He complains that Davenant  has laid the scene of action in Lombardy, which Rymer calls neglecting  his own country; but the critic should have considered, that however  well it might have pleased the poet's countrymen, yet as an epic poem  is supposed to be read in every nation enlightened by science, there  can no objections arise from that quarter by any but those who were of  the same country with the author. His not making choice of a pompous  name, and introducing his poem with an exordium, is rather a beauty  than a fault; for by these means he leaves room for surprize, which is  the first excellency in any poem, and to strike out beauties where  they are not expected, has a happy influence upon the reader. Who  would think from Milton's introduction, that so stupendous a work  would ensue, and simple dignity is certainly more noble, than all the  efforts and colourings which art and labour can bestow.    The ingenious and learned Mr. Blackwall, Professor of Greek in the  university of Aberdeen, in his enquiry into the life and writings of  Homer, censures the structure of the poem; but, at the same time pays  a compliment to the abilities of the author. \"It was indeed (says he)  a very extraordinary project of our ingenious countryman, to write an  epic poem without mixing allegory, or allowing the smallest fiction  throughout the composure. It was like lopping off a man's limb, and  then putting him upon running races; tho' it must be owned that the  performance shews, with what ability he could have acquitted himself,  had he been sound and entire.\"    Such the animadversions which critics of great name have made on  Gondibert, and the result is, that if Davenant had not power to begin  and consummate an epic poem, yet by what he has done, he has a right  to rank in the first class of poets, especially when it is considered  that we owe to him the great perfection of the theatre, and putting it  upon a level with that of France and Italy; and as the theatrical are  the most rational of all amusements, the latest posterity should hold  his name in veneration, who did so much for the advancement of  innocent pleasures, and blending instruction and gaiety together.    The dramatic works of our author are,    1. Albovine King of the Lombards, a tragedy. This play is commended by  eight copies of verses. The story of it is related at large, in a  novel, by Bandello, and is translated by Belleforest[3].    2. Cruel Brother, a tragedy.    3. Distresses, a tragi-comedy, printed in folio, Lond. 1673.    4. First Day's Entertainment at Rutland-House, by declamation and  music, after the manner of the ancients. Of this we have already given  some account.    5. The Fair Favourite, a tragi-comedy, printed in folio, 1673.    6. The Just Italian, a tragi-comedy.    7. Law against Lovers, a tragi-comedy, made up of two plays by  Shakespear, viz. Measure for Measure, and Much Ado about Nothing.    8. Love and Honour, a tragi-comedy; which succeeded beyond any other  of our author's plays, both on the theatre at Lincoln's-Inn, and  Dorset-Garden.    9. Man's the Master, a tragi-comedy, acted upon the Duke of York's  theatre.    10. Platonic Lovers, a tragi-comedy.    11. Play House to be Let. It is difficult to say, under what species  this play should be placed, as it consists of pieces of different  kinds blended together, several of which the author wrote in Oliver's  time, that were acted separately by stealth.--The History of Sir  Francis Drake, expressed by instrumental and vocal music, and by art  of perspective scenes, and the cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru, were  first printed in 4to. and make the third and fourth acts of this play.  The second act consists of a French farce, translated from  Mollier[e]'s Ganarelle, ou le Cocu Imaginaire, and purposely by our  author put into a sort of jargon, common to Frenchmen newly come over.  The fifth act consists of tragedy travestie; or the actions of Caesar,  Anthony and Cleopatra in burlesque verse.    12. Siege of Rhodes in two parts. These plays, during the civil war,  were acted in Stilo Recitativo, but afterwards enlarged, and acted  with applause at the Duke's theatre. Solyman the second took this  famous city in the year 1522, which is circumstantially related by  Knolles in his History of the Turks, from whence our author took the  story.    13. Siege, a tragi-comedy.    14. News from Plymouth, a comedy.    15. Temple of Love, presented by Queen Henrietta, wife to King Charles  I and her ladies at Whitehall, viz. The Marchioness of Hamilton; Lady  Mary Herbert; Countess of Oxford; Berkshire; Carnarvon: The noble  Persian Youths were represented by the Duke of Lenox, and the Earls of  Newport and Desmond.    16. Triumphs of the Prince d'Amour, presented by his Highness the  Prince Elector, brother-in-law to Charles I. at his palace in the  Middle Temple. This masque, at the request of this honourable society,  was devised and written by the author in three days, and was presented  by the members thereof as an entertainment to his Highness. A list of  the Masquers names, as they were ranked according to their antiquity,  is subjoined to the Masque.    17. Wits, a comedy; first acted at Black-Fryars, and afterwards at the  Duke of York's theatre. This piece appeared on the stage with  remarkable applause.    These pieces have in general been received with applause on the stage,  and have been read with pleasure by people of the best taste: The  greatest part of them were published in the author's life-time in 4to.  and all since his death, collected into one volume with his other  works, printed in folio, Lond. 1673; and dedicated by his widow to the  late King James, as has been before observed.

He was educated partly  in grammar learning in the free school at Thame in Oxfordshire, and  partly in the College school at Westminster, from which last he was  elected a student in Christ Church 1608[1], being then under the  tuition of a noted tutor. Afterwards he took the degrees in arts, and  entered into holy orders, and soon became a florid preacher, and  successively chaplain to King James I. archdeacon of Colchester,  residentiary of St. Paul's cathedral, canon and dean of Rochester, in  which dignity he was installed the 6th of February 1638. In 1641, says  Mr. Wood, he was made"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16494"],[0,"The Transvaal from Within: A Private Record of Public Affairs (#15)"],[1,"Boers were quite unable to properly  control, utilize, and administer their own immense territory, but  'land hunger' is theirs as a birth curse. The individual cannot bear  to see the smoke of his neighbour's chimney; he will not cultivate 50  acres, but wants 50,000; the 'nation' wants Africa--no less. They  coveted Swaziland, Zululand, Bechuanaland, Matabeleland, Mashonaland,  and Tongaland, and set to work by devious methods to establish claims  to these countries.    In Bechuanaland they took sides; that is to say, parties of  freebooters from the Transvaal took up the cause of certain native  chiefs against certain others. The London Convention in 1884  disposed of this quarrel by fixing the south-western boundaries  of the Republic, and placing two of the disputing chiefs under  the Transvaal, and the other two under British protection.  Notwithstanding this, however, the new Convention was no sooner  signed than the scheming was resumed, and before a year had passed a  party of Transvaal Boers, several of them now holding high official  positions under the Republic, raided the territory of the chiefs in  the British Protectorate, and even attacked the chief town Mafeking.  This was followed by a proclamation by President Kruger placing the  territory under the protection of the Republic. Mr. Rhodes, who had  already made himself conspicuous by his advocacy of holding the  highway to the interior open, was instrumental in inducing the  Imperial Government to make a determined stand against this. An  ultimatum moved the Transvaal Government to withdraw the proclamation  and forced the Boers to leave the country--only, however, when and  because the demand was backed by the Warren expedition at a cost of  over a million and a half to the British taxpayer! This expedition  was sent by Mr. Gladstone, the Boer benefactor--notwithstanding all  his anxiety to prove the Transvaal settlement a good one! The action  of the Transvaal, and the most brutal murder of Mr. Bethell by the  individuals above referred to as holding high official positions  under the Republic, gave indications of the bent of the Boer  authorities which people in South Africa did not fail to take note  of. Bethell had been wounded in the invasion of the territory by the  Boers, and as he lay helpless the 'prominent Transvaal official' came  up and, seeing a repeating rifle lying beside him, asked him to show  them how it worked. He did so, and the 'prominent official' taking it  up under pretext of examining it shot Bethell dead with his own  weapon.    In Zululand similar tactics were resorted to by the Republic.  Transvaal Boers invaded Zululand and (1884) took up the cause of  Dinizulu, a son of the dead Cetewayo, and established him as king,  upsetting Sir Garnet Wolseley's settlement. They then proceeded to  seize the country, but the British Government intervening at this  point, rescued some two-thirds for the Zulus. A glance at the map  will show that the intention of the Boers was to get to the sea, and  also that the unlucky Zulus, who had been broken by the British  Government--and very rightly too--because they were a menace to the  Transvaal, even more than to Natal, were now deprived of the pick of  their country, plundered and harried by the very people who had been  at their mercy until the Imperial Government stepped in. It is very  noteworthy that, with the splendid exception of the lion-hearted Piet  Uys and his sons, who fought and died (father and one son) in the  Zulu war side by side with the Britishers whom he was keenly opposing  on the annexation question, none of the Boers came forward to help in  the Secocoeni or Zulu wars, although these wars were undertaken, the  one entirely, and the other mainly, on their account. But a great  many were ready to raid and annex as soon as the Zulu power was  broken.    Swaziland became in turn the object of the Boer Government's  attentions. First, grazing concessions were obtained; and next, other  concessions for the collection of Customs and Revenue dues, for  telegraphs, railways, banking, surveying, and goodness only knows  what. One individual applied for and obtained a concession for the  balance of ungranted concessions, and another applied for a grant of  the Chief Justiceship. What chance the unfortunate native had in such  a condition of things can be imagined. The Transvaal bought up all  the concessions necessary to make government of the country  absolutely impossible, except with their cooperation. The secret  service fund of the Republic provided means for making the  representatives of the Swazi nation see things in a reasonable light,  so that when the time came to investigate the title to concessions  and to arrange for the future administration of the country the  result was a foregone conclusion. The judge appointed by the Imperial  Government on the Special Joint Commission to inquire into the  concessions and matters in general let some light on the manner in  which these concessions were acquired and granted, by pertinent  questions to the concessionaires and interpreters. He asked, for  instance, 'Do you swear that you interpreted this document verbatim  to the king?'--'Yes.' 'Will you kindly tell to the Court what is the  or how you interpreted and explained the significance of the  \"survey,\" \"mint,\" \"revenue,\" and \"townships\" concessions?'    The picture of the obese and drunken chief surrounded by fawning  harpies was a shameful and disgusting one. One example is sufficient  to show how the thing was done. A concession for gambling was applied  for. The man who interpreted knew a smattering of 'kitchen' Kaffir,  and his rendering of the 'monopoly for billiards, card playing,  lotteries, and games of chance' was that he alone should be allowed  to '_tchia ma-ball_ (hit the balls), _hlala ma-paper_ (play the  papers), and _tata zonki mali_ (and take all the money).' The poor  drunken king nodded sleepily to the first two clauses, but to the  bald proposition of taking all the money, which he _could_  understand, he violently objected. The concession was, however,  subsequently granted on the representations of a more tactful  interpreter.    A very flagrant breach of the spirit of the London Convention, and a  very daring attempt at land-grabbing, was the proposed last will and  testament of the Swazi King Umbandine, which provided that the  governing powers should be assigned to Mr. Kruger as executor of the  King and trustee and administrator of the country. His project was  defeated; but the aim of the Boer Government was ultimately achieved,  nevertheless, and Swaziland has now been handed over to the control  of the Republic in spite of the prayers and protestations of the  Swazis themselves, who had proved in the past with very practical  results to be useful, ready, and loyal allies of the British  Government.    While Swaziland was being entoiled the Transvaal Government were not  idle elsewhere. Matabeleland was looked upon as the heritage of the  Boer, because of the 'old friendship' with the Matabele,--whom they  had driven out of their country, now the Transvaal; and Mashonaland  was theirs because it was their ancient hunting-ground. That the  Boers did not abandon their old schemes merely because they had  agreed by treaty to do so is shown by a letter which was found at Lo  Bengula's kraal by Mr. F. Thompson when he went up to negotiate for  Mr. Rhodes. The stealthy grovelling of the Commandant-General before  a savage native chief, the unctuous phraseology, the hypocritical  assurances of an undying friendship between Boer and Matabele so long  as there are living one of each race, throw a lurid light upon the  conduct of Boer diplomacy with native tribes, and explain much of the  ineradicable fear and distrust which are felt on the native side in  all dealings with the aggressive Boer. The letter reads:      MARICO,    THE SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC,    _March 9, 1882._    _To the great ruler the Chief Lo Bengula, the son of Umzilikatse, the  great King of the Matabili nation_.    GREAT RULER,    When this letter reaches you, then you will know that it comes from a  man who very much desires to visit you, but who, being a man of the  people, cannot get loose to make such a long journey. Therefore he  must now be satisfied with writing a letter to carry his regards to  the son of the late King of the Matabele, our old friend Umzilikatse.  When I say that I desire to see you, it is not to ask for anything,  but to talk of something, and to tell Lo Bengula of the affairs and  things of the world, because I know that there are many people who  talk and tell about these matters, whilst there are but few who tell  the truth. Now, when a man hears a thing wrong, it is worse than if  he had never heard it at all. Now, I know that Lo Bengula has heard  some things wrongly, and for this reason would I tell him the real  truth. Now, you must have heard that the English--or as they are  better known the Englishmen--took away our country, the Transvaal,  or, as they say, annexed it. We then talked nicely for four years,  and begged for our country. But no; when an Englishman once has your  property in his hand, then is he like a monkey that has its hands  full of pumpkin-seeds--if you don't beat him to death, he will  never let go--and then all our nice talk for four years did not help  us at all. Then the English commenced to arrest us because we were  dissatisfied, and that caused the shooting and fighting. Then the  English first found that it would be better to give us back our  country. Now they are gone, and our country is free, and we will now  once more live in friendship with Lo Bengula, as we lived in  friendship with Umzilikatse, and such must be our friendship, that so  long as there is one Boer and one Matabele living these two must  remain friends. On this account do I wish to see Lo Bengula, and if I  may live so long, and the"]]]
