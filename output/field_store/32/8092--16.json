Whatever opinions may be held by  some readers on the grave question of immediately abolishing Colonial  Slavery, nothing assuredly can be more repugnant to the feelings of  Englishmen than that the system should be permitted to extend its baneful  influence to this country. Yet such is the case, when the slave landed in  England still only possesses that qualified degree of freedom, that a  change of domicile will determine it. Though born a British subject, and  resident within the shores of England, he is cut off from his dearest  natural rights by the sad alternative of regaining them at the expence of  liberty, and the certainty of severe treatment. It is true that he has the  option of returning; but it is a cruel mockery to call it a voluntary  choice, when upon his return depend his means of subsistence and his  re-union with all that makes life valuable. Here he has tasted \"the sweets  of freedom,\" to quote the words of the unfortunate Mary Prince; but if he  desires to restore himself to his family, or to escape from suffering and  destitution, and the other evils of a climate uncongenial to his  constitution and habits, he must abandon the enjoyment of his  late-acquired liberty, and again subject himself to the arbitrary power of  a vindictive master.    The case of Mary Prince is by no means a singular one; many of the same  kind are daily occurring: and even if the case were singular, it would  still loudly call for the interference of the legislature. In instances of  this kind no injury can possibly be done to the owner by confirming to the  slave his resumption of his natural rights. It is the master's spontaneous  act to bring him to this country; he knows when he brings him that he  divests himself of his property; and it is, in fact, a minor species of  slave trading, when he has thus enfranchised his slave, to _re-capture_  that slave by the necessities of his condition, or by working upon the  better feelings of his heart. Abstractedly from all legal technicalities,  there is no real difference between thus compelling the return of the  enfranchised negro, and trepanning a free native of England by delusive  hopes into perpetual slavery. The most ingenious casuist could not point  out any essential distinction between the two cases. Our boasted liberty  is the dream of imagination, and no longer the characteristic of our  country, if its bulwarks can thus be thrown down by colonial special  pleading. It would well become the character of the present Government to  introduce a Bill into the Legislature making perpetual that freedom which  the slave has acquired by his passage here, and thus to declare, in the  most ample sense of the words, (what indeed we had long fondly believed to  be the fact, though it now appears that we have been mistaken,) THAT  NO SLAVE CAN EXIST WITHIN THE SHORES OF GREAT BRITAIN.          NARRATIVE OF LOUIS ASA-ASA,    A CAPTURED AFRICAN.      The following interesting narrative is a convenient supplement to the  history of Mary Prince. It is given, like hers, as nearly as possible in  the narrator's words, with only so much correction as was necessary to  connect the story, and render it grammatical. The concluding passage in  inverted commas, is entirely his own.    While Mary's narrative shews the disgusting character of colonial slavery,  this little tale explains with equal force the horrors in which it  originates.    It is necessary to explain that Louis came to this country about five  years ago, in a French vessel called the Pearl. She had lost her  reckoning, and was driven by stress of weather into the port of St. Ives,  in Cornwall. Louis and his four companions were brought to London upon a  writ of Habeas Corpus at the instance of Mr. George Stephen; and, after  some trifling opposition on the part of the master of the vessel, were  discharged by Lord Wynford. Two of his unfortunate fellow-sufferers died  of the measles at Hampstead; the other two returned to Sierra Leone; but  poor Louis, when offered the choice of going back to Africa, replied, \"Me  no father, no mother now; me stay with you.\" And here he has ever since  remained; conducting himself in a way to gain the good will and respect of  all who know him. He is remarkably intelligent, understands our language  perfectly, and can read and write well. The last sentences of the  following narrative will seem almost too peculiar to be his own; but it is  not the first time that in conversation with Mr. George Stephen, he has  made similar remarks. On one occasion in particular, he was heard saying  to himself in the kitchen, while sitting by the fire apparently in deep  thought, \"Me think,--me think----\" A fellow-servant inquired what he  meant; and he added, \"Me think what a good thing I came to England! Here,  I know what God is, and read my Bible; in my country they have no God, no  Bible.\"    How severe and just a reproof to the guilty wretches who visit his country  only with fire and sword! How deserved a censure upon the not less guilty  men, who dare to vindicate the state of slavery, on the lying pretext,  that its victims are of an inferior nature! And scarcely less deserving of  reprobation are those who have it in their power to prevent these crimes,  but who remain inactive from indifference, or are dissuaded from throwing  the shield of British power over the victim of oppression, by the  sophistry, and the clamour, and the avarice of the oppressor. It is the  reproach and the sin of England. May God avert from our country the ruin  which this national guilt deserves!    We lament to add, that the Pearl which brought these negroes to our shore,  was restored to its owners at the instance of the French Government,  instead of being condemned as a prize to Lieut. Rye, who, on his own  responsibility, detained her, with all her manacles and chains and other  detestable proofs of her piratical occupation on board. We trust it is not  yet too late to demand investigation into the reasons for restoring her.      _The Negro Boy's Narrative._      My father's name was Clashoquin; mine is Asa-Asa. He lived in a country  called Bycla, near Egie, a large town. Egie is as large as Brighton; it  was some way from the sea. I had five brothers and sisters. We all lived  together with my father and mother; he kept a horse, and was respectable,  but not one of the great men. My uncle was one of the great men at Egie:  he could make men come and work for him: his name was Otou. He had a great  deal of land and cattle. My father sometimes worked on his own land, and  used to make charcoal. I was too little to work; my eldest brother used to  work on the land; and we were all very happy.    A great many people, whom we called Adinyes, set fire to Egie in the  morning before daybreak; there were some thousands of them. They killed a  great many, and burnt all their houses. They staid two days, and then  carried away all the people whom they did not kill.    They came again every now and then for a month, as long as they could find  people to carry away. They used to tie them by the feet, except when they  were taking them off, and then they let them loose; but if they offered to  run away, they would shoot them. I lost a great many friends and relations  at Egie; about a dozen. They sold all they carried away, to be slaves. I  know this because I afterwards saw them as slaves on the other side of the  sea. They took away brothers, and sisters, and husbands, and wives; they  did not care about this. They were sold for cloth or gunpowder, sometimes  for salt or guns; sometimes they got four or five guns for a man: they  were English guns, made like my master's that I clean for his shooting.  The Adinyes burnt a great many places besides Egie. They burnt all the  country wherever they found villages; they used to shoot men, women, and  children, if they ran away.    They came to us about eleven o'clock one day, and directly they came they  set our house on fire. All of us had run away. We kept together, and went  into the woods, and stopped there two days. The Adinyes then went away,  and we returned home and found every thing burnt. We tried to build a  little shed, and were beginning to get comfortable again. We found  several of our neighbours lying about wounded; they had been shot. I saw  the bodies of four or five little children whom they had killed with blows  on the head. They had carried away their fathers and mothers, but the  children were too small for slaves, so they killed them. They had killed  several others, but these were all that I saw. I saw them lying in the  street like dead dogs.    In about a week after we got back, the Adinyes returned, and burnt all the  sheds and houses they had left standing. We all ran away again; we went to  the woods as we had done before.--They followed us the next day. We went  farther into the woods, and staid there about four days and nights; we  were half starved; we only got a few potatoes. My uncle Otou was with us.  At the end of this time, the Adinyes found us. We ran away. They called my  uncle to go to them; but he refused, and they shot him immediately: they  killed him. The rest of us ran on, and they did not get at us till the  next day. I ran up into a tree: they followed me and brought me down. They  tied my feet. I do not know if they found my father and mother, and  brothers and sisters: they had run faster than me, and were half a mile  farther when I got up into the tree: I have never seen them since.--There  was a man who ran up into the tree with me: I believe they shot him, for I  never saw him again.    They carried away about twenty besides me.

Through the  clear glass of the lofty windows you could see gorgeous halls adorned  with costly silken hangings, and the pictures on the walls were a sight  worth seeing. In the midst of the central hall a large fountain played,  throwing its jets of spray upwards to a glass dome in the roof, through  which the sunbeams lighted up the water and the beautiful plants which  grew in the great basin.    She knew now where he lived, and often used to go there in the evenings  and by night over the water. She swam much nearer the land than any of  the others dared; she even ventured right up the narrow channel under  the splendid marble terrace which threw a long shadow over the water.  She used to sit here looking at the young prince, who thought he was  quite alone in the clear moonlight.    She saw him many an evening sailing about in his beautiful boat, with  flags waving and music playing; she used to peep through the green  rushes, and if the wind happened to catch her long silvery veil and any  one saw it, they only thought it was a swan flapping its wings.    Many a night she heard the fishermen, who were fishing by torchlight,  talking over the good deeds of the young prince; and she was happy to  think that she had saved his life when he was drifting about on the  waves, half dead, and she could not forget how closely his head had  pressed her breast, and how passionately she had kissed him; but he knew  nothing of all this, and never saw her even in his dreams.    She became fonder and fonder of mankind, and longed more and more to be  able to live among them; their world seemed so infinitely bigger than  hers; with their ships they could scour the ocean, they could ascend the  mountains high above the clouds, and their wooded, grass-grown lands  extended further than her eye could reach. There was so much that she  wanted to know, but her sisters could not give an answer to all her  questions, so she asked her old grandmother, who knew the upper world  well, and rightly called it the country above the sea.    'If men are not drowned,' asked the little mermaid, 'do they live for  ever? Do they not die as we do down here in the sea?'    'Yes,' said the old lady, 'they have to die too, and their lifetime is  even shorter than ours. We may live here for three hundred years, but  when we cease to exist we become mere foam on the water and do not have  so much as a grave among our dear ones. We have no immortal souls; we  have no future life; we are just like the green sea-weed, which, once  cut down, can never revive again! Men, on the other hand, have a soul  which lives for ever, lives after the body has become dust; it rises  through the clear air, up to the shining stars! Just as we rise from the  water to see the land of mortals, so they rise up to unknown beautiful  regions which we shall never see.'    'Why have we no immortal souls?' asked the little mermaid sadly. 'I  would give all my three hundred years to be a human being for one day,  and afterwards to have a share in the heavenly kingdom.'    'You must not be thinking about that,' said the grandmother; 'we are  much better off and happier than human beings.'    'Then I shall have to die and to float as foam on the water, and never  hear the music of the waves or see the beautiful flowers or the red sun!  Is there nothing I can do to gain an immortal soul?'    'No,' said the grandmother; 'only if a human being so loved you that you  were more to him than father or mother, if all his thoughts and all his  love were so centred in you that he would let the priest join your hands  and would vow to be faithful to you here, and to all eternity; then your  body would become infused with his soul. Thus, and only thus, could you  gain a share in the felicity of mankind. He would give you a soul while  yet keeping his own. But that can never happen! That which is your  greatest beauty in the sea, your fish's tail, is thought hideous up on  earth, so little do they understand about it; to be pretty there you  must have two clumsy supports which they call legs!'    Then the little mermaid sighed and looked sadly at her fish's tail.    'Let us be happy,' said the grandmother; 'we will hop and skip during  our three hundred years of life; it is surely a long enough time; and  after it is over we shall rest all the better in our graves. There is to  be a court ball to-night.'    This was a much more splendid affair than we ever see on earth. The  walls and the ceiling of the great ballroom were of thick but  transparent glass. Several hundreds of colossal mussel shells, rose red  and grass green, were ranged in order round the sides holding blue  lights, which illuminated the whole room and shone through the walls, so  that the sea outside was quite lit up. You could see countless fish,  great and small, swimming towards the glass walls, some with shining  scales of crimson hue, while others were golden and silvery. In the  middle of the room was a broad stream of running water, and on this the  mermaids and mermen danced to their own beautiful singing. No earthly  beings have such lovely voices. The little mermaid sang more sweetly  than any of them, and they all applauded her. For a moment she felt glad  at heart, for she knew that she had the finest voice either in the sea  or on land. But she soon began to think again about the upper world, she  could not forget the handsome prince and her sorrow in not possessing,  like him, an immortal soul. Therefore she stole out of her father's  palace, and while all within was joy and merriment, she sat sadly in her  little garden. Suddenly she heard the sound of a horn through the water,  and she thought, 'Now he is out sailing up there; he whom I love more  than father or mother, he to whom my thoughts cling and to whose hands I  am ready to commit the happiness of my life. I will dare anything to win  him and to gain an immortal soul! While my sisters are dancing in my  father's palace I will go to the sea-witch, of whom I have always been  very much afraid; she will perhaps be able to advise and help me!'    Thereupon the little mermaid left the garden and went towards the  roaring whirlpools at the back of which the witch lived. She had never  been that way before; no flowers grew there, no seaweed, only the bare  grey sands, stretched towards the whirlpools, which like rushing  mill-wheels swirled round, dragging everything that came within reach  down to the depths. She had to pass between these boiling eddies to  reach the witch's domain, and for a long way the only path led over warm  bubbling mud, which the witch called her 'peat bog.' Her house stood  behind this in the midst of a weird forest. All the trees and bushes  were polyps, half animal and half plant; they looked like hundred-headed  snakes growing out of the sand, the branches were long slimy arms, with  tentacles like wriggling worms, every joint of which, from the root to  the outermost tip, was in constant motion. They wound themselves tightly  round whatever they could lay hold of and never let it escape. The  little mermaid standing outside was quite frightened, her heart beat  fast with terror and she nearly turned back, but then she remembered the  prince and the immortal soul of mankind and took courage. She bound her  long flowing hair tightly round her head, so that the polyps should not  seize her by it, folded her hands over her breast, and darted like a  fish through the water, in between the hideous polyps, which stretched  out their sensitive arms and tentacles towards her. She could see that  every one of them had something or other, which they had grasped with  their hundred arms, and which they held as if in iron bands. The  bleached bones of men who had perished at sea and sunk below peeped  forth from the arms of some, while others clutched rudders and  sea-chests, or the skeleton of some land animal; and most horrible of  all, a little mermaid whom they had caught and suffocated. Then she came  to a large opening in the wood where the ground was all slimy, and where  some huge fat water snakes were gambolling about. In the middle of this  opening was a house built of the bones of the wrecked; there sat the  witch, letting a toad eat out of her mouth, just as mortals let a little  canary eat sugar. She called the hideous water snakes her little  chickens, and allowed them to crawl about on her unsightly bosom.    'I know very well what you have come here for,' said the witch. 'It is  very foolish of you! all the same you shall have your way, because it  will lead you into misfortune, my fine princess. You want to get rid of  your fish's tail, and instead to have two stumps to walk about upon like  human beings, so that the young prince may fall in love with you, and  that you may win him and an immortal soul.' Saying this, she gave such a  loud hideous laugh that the toad and the snakes fell to the ground and  wriggled about there.    'You are just in the nick of time,' said the witch; 'after sunrise  to-morrow I should not be able to help you until another year had run  its course. I will make you a potion, and before sunrise you must swim  ashore with it, seat yourself on the beach and drink it; then your tail  will divide and shrivel up to what men call beautiful legs. But it  hurts; it is as if a sharp sword were running through you. All who see  you will say that you are the most beautiful child of man they have ever  seen. You will keep your gliding gait, no dancer will rival you, but  every step you take will be as if you were treading upon sharp knives,  so sharp as to draw blood. If you are willing to suffer all this I am  ready to help you!'    'Yes!' said the little princess with a trembling voice, thinking of the  prince and of winning an undying soul.    'But remember,' said the witch, 'when once you have"]]]
