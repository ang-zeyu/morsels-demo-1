Neither Mercury nor Venus has a moon, but Mars has two moons. This  statement, standing alone, might lead to the conclusion that, as far as  the advantages a satellite can afford to the inhabitants of its master  planet are concerned, the people of Mars are doubly fortunate. So they  would be, perhaps, if Mars's moons were bodies comparable in size with  our moon, but in fact they are hardly more than a pair of very  entertaining astronomical toys. The larger of the two, Phobos, is  believed to be about seven miles in diameter; the smaller, Deimos, only  five or six miles. Their dimensions thus resemble those of the more  minute of the asteroids, and the suggestion has even been made that they  may be captured asteroids which have fallen under the gravitational  control of Mars.    The diameters just mentioned are Professor Pickering's estimates, based  on the amount of light the little satellites reflect, for they are much  too small to present measurable disks. Deimos is 14,600 miles from the  center of Mars and 12,500 miles from its surface. Phobos is 5,800 miles  from the center of the planet and only 3,700 from the surface. Deimos  completes a revolution about the planet in thirty hours and eighteen  minutes, and Phobos in the astonishingly short period--although, of  course, it is in strict accord with the law of gravitation and in that  sense not astonishing--of seven hours and thirty-nine minutes.    Since Mars takes twenty-four hours and thirty-seven minutes for one  rotation on its axis, it is evident that Phobos goes round the planet  three times in the course of a single Martian day and night, rising,  contrary to the general motion of the heavens, in the west, running in a  few hours through all the phases that our moon exhibits in the course of  a month, and setting, where the sun and all the stars rise, in the east.  Deimos, on the other hand, has a period of revolution five or six hours  longer than that of the planet's axial rotation, so that it rises, like  the other heavenly bodies, in the east; but, because its motion is so  nearly equal, in angular velocity, to that of Mars's rotation, it shifts  very slowly through the sky toward the west, and for two or three  successive days and nights it remains above the horizon, the sun  overtaking and passing it again and again, while, in the meantime, its  protean face swiftly changes from full circle to half-moon, from  half-moon to crescent, from crescent back to half, and from half to  full, and so on without ceasing.    And during this time Phobos is rushing through the sky in the opposite  direction, as if in defiance of the fundamental law of celestial  revolution, making a complete circuit three times every twenty-four  hours, and changing the shape of its disk four times as rapidly as  Deimos does! Truly, if we were suddenly transported to Mars, we might  well believe that we had arrived in the mother world of lunatics, and  that its two moons were bewitched. Yet it must not be supposed that all  the peculiarities just mentioned would be clearly seen from the surface  of Mars by eyes like ours. The phases of Phobos would probably be  discernible to the naked eye, but those of Deimos would require a  telescope in order to be seen, for, notwithstanding their nearness to  the planet, Mars's moons are inconspicuous phenomena even to the  Martians themselves. Professor Young's estimate is that Phobos may shed  upon Mars one-sixtieth and Deimos one-twelve-hundredth as much reflected  moonlight as our moon sends to the earth. Accordingly, a \"moonlit night\"  on Mars can have no such charm as we associate with the phrase. But it  is surely a tribute to the power and perfection of our telescopes that  we have been able to discover the existence of objects so minute and  inconspicuous, situated at a distance of many millions of miles, and  half concealed by the glaring light of the planet close around which  they revolve.    If Mars's moons were as massive as our moon is they would raise  tremendous tides upon Mars, and would affect the circulation of water in  the canals, but, in fact, their tidal effects are even more  insignificant than their light-giving powers. But for astronomers on  Mars they would be objects of absorbing interest.    Upon quitting Mars we pass to the second distinctive planetary group of  the solar system, that of the asteroids.          CHAPTER V    THE ASTEROIDS, A FAMILY OF DWARF WORLDS      Beyond Mars, in the broad gap separating the terrestrial from the Jovian  planets, are the asteroids, of which nearly five hundred have been  discovered and designated by individual names or numbers. But any  statement concerning the known number of asteroids can remain valid for  but a short time, because new ones are continually found, especially by  the aid of photography. Very few of the asteroids are of measurable  size. Among these are the four that were the first to be  discovered--Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta. Their diameters, according  to the measurements of Prof. E.E. Barnard, of the Yerkes Observatory,  are as follows: Ceres, 477 miles; Pallas, 304 miles; Juno, 120 miles;  Vesta, 239 miles.    It is only necessary to mention these diameters in order to indicate how  wide is the difference between the asteroids and such planets as the  earth, Venus, or Mars. The entire surface of the largest asteroid,  Ceres, does not equal the republic of Mexico in area. But Ceres itself  is gigantic in comparison with the vast majority of the asteroids, many  of which, it is believed, do not exceed twenty miles in diameter, while  there may be hundreds or thousands of others still smaller--ten miles,  five miles, or perhaps only a few rods, in diameter!    Curiously enough, the asteroid which appears brightest, and which it  would naturally be inferred is the largest, really stands third in the  order of measured size. This is Vesta, whose diameter, according to  Barnard, is only 239 miles. It is estimated that the surface of Vesta  possesses about four times greater light-reflecting power than the  surface of Ceres. Some observations have also shown a variation in the  intensity of the light from Vesta, a most interesting fact, which  becomes still more significant when considered in connection with the  great variability of another most extraordinary member of the asteroidal  family, Eros, which is to be described presently.    The orbits of the asteroids are scattered over a zone about 200,000,000  miles broad. The mean distance from the sun of the nearest asteroid,  Eros, is 135,000,000 miles, and that of the most distant, Thule,  400,000,000 miles. Wide gaps exist in the asteroidal zone where few or  no members of the group are to be found, and Prof. Daniel Kirkwood long  ago demonstrated the influence of Jupiter in producing these gaps.  Almost no asteroids, as he showed, revolve at such a distance from the  sun that their periods of revolution are exactly commensurable with that  of Jupiter. Originally there may have been many thus situated, but the  attraction of the great planet has, in the course of time, swept those  zones clean.    Many of the asteroids have very eccentric orbits, and their orbits are  curiously intermixed, varying widely among themselves, both in  ellipticity and in inclination to the common plane of the solar system.    Considered with reference to the shape and position of its orbit, the  most unique of these little worlds is Eros, which was discovered in 1898  by De Witt, at Berlin, and which, on account of its occasional near  approach to the earth, has lately been utilized in a fresh attempt to  obtain a closer approximation to the true distance of the sun from the  earth. The mean distance of Eros from the sun is 135,000,000 miles, its  greatest distance is 166,000,000 miles, and its least distance  105,000,000 miles. It will thus be seen that, although all the other  asteroids are situated beyond Mars, Eros, at its mean distance, is  nearer to the sun than Mars is. When in aphelion, or at its greatest  distance, Eros is outside of the orbit of Mars, but when in perihelion  it is so much inside of Mars's orbit that it comes surprisingly near the  earth.    Indeed, there are times when Eros is nearer to the earth than any other  celestial body ever gets except the moon--and, it might be added,  except meteors and, by chance, a comet, or a comet's tail. Its least  possible distance from the earth is less than 14,000,000 miles, and it  was nearly as close as that, without anybody knowing or suspecting the  fact, in 1894, four years in advance of its discovery. Yet the fact,  strange as the statement may seem, had been recorded without being  recognized. After De Witt's discovery of Eros in 1898, at a time when it  was by no means as near the earth as it had been some years before,  Prof. E.C. Pickering ascertained that it had several times imprinted its  image on the photographic plates of the Harvard Observatory, with which  pictures of the sky are systematically taken, but had remained  unnoticed, or had been taken for an ordinary star among the thousands of  star images surrounding it. From these telltale plates it was  ascertained that in 1894 it had been in perihelion very near the earth,  and had shone with the brilliance of a seventh-magnitude star.    It will, unfortunately, be a long time before Eros comes quite as near  us as it did on that occasion, when we failed to see it, for its close  approaches to the earth are not frequent. Prof. Solon I. Bailey selects  the oppositions of Eros in 1931 and 1938 as probably the most favorable  that will occur during the first half of the twentieth century.    We turn to the extraordinary fluctuations in the light of Eros, and the  equally"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18435"],[0,"Good Things to Eat, as Suggested (#15)"],[1," CORN~--Cut the corn off the cob, leaving the grains as separate  as possible. Fry in just enough butter to keep it from sticking to the  pan, stirring very often. When nicely browned add salt and pepper and a  little rich cream. Do not set near the fire after adding the cream.      ~FRIED TOMATOES~--Wipe some smooth solid tomatoes and slice and fry in a  spider with butter or pork fat. Season well with salt and pepper.      ~GLAZED CARROTS WITH PEAS~--Wash, scrape and cut three medium-sized  carrots in one-fourth inch slices, then, in cubes or fancy shapes, drain  and put in saucepan with one-half cup butter, one-third cup sugar, and  one tablespoon fine chopped fresh mint leaves. Cook slowly until glazed  and tender. Drain and rinse one can French peas and heat in freshly  boiling water five minutes. Again drain and season with butter, salt and  pepper. Mound peas on hot dish and surround with carrots.      ~GLAZED SWEET POTATOES~--Put two rounding tablespoons of butter and one  of sugar into a casserole and set on the back of the range to heat  slowly. When hot lay in raw, pared sweet potatoes cut in halves,  lengthwise. Dust with salt and pepper and put in another layer of  seasoned potatoes and enough boiling water to stand one-half inch deep  in the dish. Put on the close-fitting cover and set in the oven to cook  slowly. When the potatoes are tender serve in the same dish with the  sweet sauce that will not be entirely absorbed in the cooking. This way  of preparing sweet potatoes pleases the Southern taste, which demands  sugar added to the naturally sweet vegetable.      ~GLAZED SWEET POTATOES~--Sweet potatoes, like squash and peas, lose a  little of their sweetness in cooking, and when recooked it is well to  add a little sugar. Slice two large cooked sweet potatoes and lay in a  small baking dish, sprinkle with a level tablespoon of sugar and a few  dashes of salt and pepper, add also some bits of butter. Pour in  one-half cup of boiling water, bake half an hour, basting twice with the  butter and water.      ~GREEN MELON SAUTE~--There are frequently a few melons left on the vines  which will not ripen sufficiently to be palatable uncooked. Cut them in  halves, remove the seeds and then cut in slices three-fourths of an inch  thick. Cut each slice in quarters and again, if the melon is large, pare  off the rind, sprinkle them slightly with salt and powdered sugar, cover  with fine crumbs; then dip in beaten egg, then in crumbs again, and cook  slowly in hot butter, the same as eggplant. Drain, and serve hot. When  the melons are nearly ripe they may be sauted in butter without crumbs.      ~JAPANESE OR CHINESE RICE~--Wash one cup of rice, rubbing it through  several waters until the water runs clear. Put in porcelain-lined  stewpan with a quart of soup stock and bay leaves and boil twenty  minutes. The stock must be hot when added to the rice. Shake the kettle  in which it is cooking several times during the cooking and lift  occasionally with a fork. Do not stir. Pour off any superfluous stock  remaining at the end of twenty minutes, and set on the back of the stove  or in the oven, uncovered, to finish swelling and steaming. Just before  serving add one cup of hot tomato juice, a quarter cup of butter, a  tablespoon chopped parsley, a dash of paprika, and one tablespoon of  grated cheese. Serve with grated cheese.      ~LIMA BEANS WITH NUTS~--Soak one cup of dry lima beans over night. In  the morning rip off the skins, rinse and put into the bean pot with  plenty of water and salt to season, rather more than without the nuts.  Let cook slowly in the oven and until perfectly tender; add one-half cup  of walnut meal, stirring it in well; let cook a few minutes, and serve.      ~MACARONI WITH APRICOTS~--Stew twenty halves of fresh apricots in half a  cup of sugar and enough water to make a nice sirup when they are done.  Before removing from the fire add a heaping tablespoonful of brown flour  and cook until the sirup is heavy and smooth. Parboil ten sticks of  macaroni broken in two-inch pieces, drain, add to one pint of scalding  hot milk two ounces of sugar. Throw in the parboiled macaroni and allow  it to simmer until the milk is absorbed; stir it often. Pour all the  juice or sauce from the apricots into the macaroni, cover the macaroni  well, set on back of the stove for fifteen minutes, then take off and  allow to cool. When cold form a pile of macaroni in the center of the  dish and cover with apricots, placing them in circles around and over  it.      ~MACARONI AND CHEESE~--Cook macaroni broken up into short length in  boiling salted water. Boil uncovered for twenty or thirty minutes, then  drain. Fill a buttered pudding dish with alternate layers of macaroni  and grated cheese, sprinkling pepper, salt and melted butter over each  layer. Have top layer of cheese, moisten with rich milk, bake in  moderate oven until a rich brown.      ~SCRAMBLED CAULIFLOWER~--Trim off the coarse outer leaves of a  cauliflower. After soaking and cooking, drain well and divide into  branches. Sprinkle with nutmeg, salt and pepper and toss into a frying  pan with hot butter or olive oil.      ~MACARONI OR SPAGHETTI SERVED IN ITALIAN STYLE~--Break a pound of  macaroni or spaghetti into small pieces. Put into boiling salted water  and boil about twenty minutes. Then drain and arrange on platter.  Sprinkle on each layer grated cheese and mushroom sauce. Serve hot.      ~MUSHROOM SAUCE, ITALIAN STYLE~--(For macaroni, spaghetti, ravioli and  rice.)--A small piece of butter about the size of an egg. One or two  small onions, cut very small. About two pounds of beef. Let all brown.  Prepare as you would a pot roast. Add Italian dried mushrooms, soaked  over night in hot water, chopped in small pieces. Add about one-half can  of tomatoes. Let all cook well. Salt and pepper to taste. Add a little  flour to thicken.      ~MOLD SPINACH~--Remove roots and decayed leaves, wash in several waters  until no grit remains. Boil in water to nearly cover until tender,  drain, rinse in cold water, drain again, chop very fine; reheat in  butter, season with salt and pepper and pack in small cups. Turn out and  garnish with sifted yolk of egg.      ~NUT PARSNIP STEW~--Wash, scrape and slice thin two good-sized parsnips.  Cook until perfectly tender in two quarts of water. When nearly done add  a teaspoon of salt and when thoroughly done a teaspoon of flour mixed  with a little cold water, stir well and let boil until the flour is well  cooked, then stir in one-half cup of walnut meal, let boil up once, and  serve immediately.      ~POTATOES A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL~--Slice cold boiled potatoes thin. Melt a  rounding tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan, add a heaping pint bowl  of the potatoes, season with salt and pepper, and heat. Now add a  teaspoon of lemon juice and the same of finely minced parsley, and serve  at once.      POTATOES AU GRATIN--Make a white sauce, using one tablespoonful of  butter, one of flour, one-half a teaspoonful salt, one-quarter of a  teaspoonful of white pepper and one cupful of milk. Cut cold boiled  potatoes into thick slices, or, better still, into half-inch cubes.  Butter a baking dish, put in it a layer of the sauce, then one of the  potatoes, previously lightly seasoning with salt and pepper. Continue  until all are in, the proportion of potato being about two cupfuls.    To one cupful of dried and sifted breadcrumbs, add one teaspoonful of  melted butter and stir until it is evenly mixed through. Spread this  over the contents of the baking dish, and place in a quick oven for  twenty minutes, or until nicely browned. For a change, a little onion  juice, chopped parsley or grated cheese may be added to the sauce.      ~POTATO CREAMED~--Cut cold boiled potatoes into small dice and cover  them in a small saucepan with milk. Let them stand where they will heat  slowly and absorb nearly all the milk. When hot add to one pint of  potatoes a tablespoon of salt and a dash of white pepper. Sprinkle a  little finely chopped parsley over the top as a garnish.      ~POTATO MOLD~--Mash some potato smoothly, add to it some butter and a  little milk to make it smooth but not wet. Season with white pepper and  salt and add enough chopped parsley to make it look pretty. Press into  greased mold and bake for half an hour until lightly browned. Dust with  crumbs and serve.      ~POTATO PARISIENNE~--Potato marbles seasoned with minced parsley, butter  and lemon juice are liked by many. Others find that they are not  sufficiently seasoned, that is, the seasoning has not penetrated into  the potatoes, especially if a large cutter has been used. This method  will be found to remedy this fault, giving a seasoning which reaches  every portion of the potato. It may not be quite so attractive as the  somewhat underdone marbles, but the flavor is finer.    Pare the potatoes and steam or boil them until soft, being careful they  do not cook too fast. Drain off the water and let them stand uncovered  until dry. Then cut in quarters lengthwise, and then in thin slices,  letting them drop into a stewpan containing melted butter, salt and  paprika. When all are sliced cover them and let them heat for a few  minutes, add minced parsley and lemon Juice, shake them about so the  seasoning will be well mixed and serve at once.      ~POTATO PUFFS~--~No. 1~--To one cup of mashed potato add one tablespoon  of butter, one egg, beaten light, one-half cup of cream or milk, a  little salt. Beat well and fill popover pans half full. Bake until brown  in quick oven.      ~POTATO PUFFS~--~No. 2~--Add hot milk to cold mashed potato beat up  thoroughly. Add one or two well-beaten eggs, leaving out the yolks if  preferred whiter. Drop in spoonfuls on a buttered tin, place a piece of  butter on the top of each and bake a delicate brown or put in a pudding  dish and butter the top and bake till of a light brown on top.
