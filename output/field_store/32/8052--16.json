Women are invariably selfish for those  they love.    \"You must warn him,\" she replied.    \"He would laugh at me. However, I must speak to Reginald.\"    \"It is of no avail to speak to him. At least, you must not do so before  you have obtained the manuscript. It would unnecessarily jeopardise our  plans.\"    \"And after?\"    \"After, perhaps. But you must not expose yourself to any danger.\"    \"No, dear,\" he said, and kissed her; \"what danger is there, provided I  keep my wits about me? He steals upon men only in their sleep and in the  dark.\"    \"Be careful, nevertheless.\"    \"I shall. In fact, I think he is not at home at this moment. If I go now  I may be able to get hold of the manuscript and hide it before he  returns.\"    \"I cannot but tremble to think of you in that house.\"    \"You shall have no more reason to tremble in a day or two.\"    \"Shall I see you to-morrow?\"    \"I don't think so. I must go over my papers and things so as to be ready  at any moment to leave the house.\"    \"And then?\"    \"Then--\"    He took her in his arms and looked long and deeply into her eyes.    \"Yes,\" she replied--\"at least, perhaps.\"    Then he turned to go, resolute and happy. How strangely he had matured  since the summer! Her heart swelled with the consciousness that it was  her love that had effected this transformation.    \"As I cannot expect you to-morrow, I shall probably go to the opera, but  I shall be at home before midnight. Will you call me up then? A word  from you will put me at ease for the night, even if it comes over the  telephone.\"    \"I will call you up. We moderns have an advantage over the ancients in  this respect: the twentieth-century Pyramus can speak to Thisbe even if  innumerable walls sever his body from hers.\"    \"A quaint conceit! But let us hope that our love-story will end less  tragically,\" she said, tenderly caressing his hair. \"Oh, we shall be  happy, you and I,\" she added, after a while. \"The iron finger of fate  that lay so heavily on our lives is now withdrawn. Almost withdrawn.  Yes, almost. Only almost.\"    And then a sudden fear overcame her.    \"No,\" she cried, \"do not go, do not go! Stay with me; stay here. I feel  so frightened. I don't know what comes over me. I am afraid--afraid for  you.\"    \"No, dear,\" he rejoined, \"you need not be afraid. In your heart you  don't want me to desert a friend, and, besides, leave the best part of  my artistic life in Reginald's clutch.\"    \"Why should you expose yourself to God knows what danger for a friend  who is ready to betray you?\"    \"You forget friendship is a gift. If it exacts payment in any form, it  is no longer either friendship or a gift. And you yourself have assured  me that I have nothing to fear from Reginald. I have nothing to give to  him.\"    She rallied under his words and had regained her self-possession when  the door closed behind him. He walked a few blocks very briskly. Then  his pace slackened. Her words had unsettled him a little, and when he  reached home he did not at once resume his exploration of Reginald's  papers. He had hardly lit a cigarette when, at an unusually early hour,  he heard Reginald's key in the lock.    Quickly he turned the light out and in the semi-darkness, lit up by an  electric lantern below, barricaded the door as on the previous night.  Then he went to bed without finding sleep.    Supreme silence reigned over the house. Even the elevator had ceased to  run. Ernest's brain was all ear. He heard Reginald walking up and down  in the studio. Not the smallest movement escaped his attention. Thus  hours passed. When the clock struck twelve, he was still walking up and  down, down and up, up and down.    One o'clock.    Still the measured beat of his footfall had not ceased. There was  something hypnotic in the regular tread. Nature at last exacted its toll  from the boy. He fell asleep.    Hardly had he closed his eyes when again that horrible nightmare--no  longer a nightmare--tormented him. Again he felt the pointed delicate  fingers carefully feeling their way along the innumerable tangled  threads of nerve-matter that lead to the innermost recesses of self....    A subconscious something strove to arouse him, and he felt the fingers  softly withdrawn.    He could have sworn that he heard the scurrying of feet in the room.  Bathed in perspiration he made a leap for the electric light.    But there was no sign of any human presence. The barricade at the door  was undisturbed. But fear like a great wind filled the wings of his  soul.    Yet there was nothing, nothing to warrant his conviction that Reginald  Clarke had been with him only a few moments ago, plying his horrible  trade. The large mirror above the fireplace only showed him his own  face, white, excited,--the face of a madman.          XXIX      The next morning's mail brought a letter from Ethel, a few lines of  encouragement and affection. Yes, she was right; it would not do for him  to stay under one roof with Reginald any longer. He must only obtain the  manuscript and, if possible, surprise him in the attempt to exercise his  mysterious and criminal power. Then he would be in the position to  dictate terms and to demand Jack's safety as the price of his silence.    Reginald, however, had closeted himself that day in his studio busily  writing. Only the clatter of his typewriter announced his presence in  the house. There was no chance for conversation or for obtaining the  precious manuscript of \"Leontina.\"    Meanwhile Ernest was looking over his papers and preparing everything  for a quick departure. Glancing over old letters and notes, he became  readily interested and hardly noticed the passage of the hours.    When the night came he only partly undressed and threw himself upon the  bed. It was now ten. At twelve he had promised Ethel to speak to her  over the telephone. He was determined not to sleep at all that night. At  last he would discover whether or not on the previous and other nights  Reginald had secretly entered his room.    When one hour had passed without incident, his attention relaxed a  little. His eyes were gradually closing when suddenly something seemed  to stir at the door. The Chinese vase came rattling to the floor.    At once Ernest sprang up. His face had blanched with terror. It was  whiter than the linen in which they wrap the dead. But his soul was  resolute.    He touched a button and the electric light illuminated the whole  chamber. There was no nook for even a shadow to hide. Yet there was no  one to be seen. From without the door came no sound. Suddenly something  soft touched his foot. He gathered all his will power so as not to  break out into a frenzied shriek. Then he laughed, not a hearty laugh,  to be sure. A tiny nose and a tail gracefully curled were brushing  against him. The source of the disturbance was a little Maltese cat, his  favourite, that by some chance had remained in his room. After its essay  at midnight gymnastics the animal quieted down and lay purring at the  foot of his bed.    The presence of a living thing was a certain comfort, and the reservoir  of his strength was well nigh exhausted.    He dimly remembered his promise to Ethel, but his lids drooped with  sheer weariness. Perhaps an hour passed in this way, when suddenly his  blood congealed with dread.    He felt the presence of the hand of Reginald  Clarke--unmistakably--groping in his brain as if searching for something  that had still escaped him.    He tried to move, to cry out, but his limbs were paralysed. When, by a  superhuman effort, he at last succeeded in shaking off the numbness that  held him enchained, he awoke just in time to see a figure, that of a  man, disappearing in the wall that separated Reginald's apartments from  his room....    This time it was no delusion of the senses. He heard something like a  secret door softly closing behind retreating steps. A sudden fierce  anger seized him. He was oblivious of the danger of the terrible power  of the older man, oblivious of the love he had once borne him, oblivious  of everything save the sense of outraged humanity and outraged right.    The law permits us to shoot a burglar who goes through our pockets at  night. Must he tolerate the ravages of this a thousand times more  dastardly and dangerous spiritual thief? Was Reginald to enjoy the fruit  of other men's labour unpunished? Was he to continue growing into the  mightiest literary factor of the century by preying upon his betters?  Abel, Walkham, Ethel, he, Jack, were they all to be victims of this  insatiable monster?    Was this force resistless as it was relentless?    No, a thousand times, no!    He dashed himself against the wall at the place where the shadow of  Reginald Clarke had disappeared. In doing so he touched upon a secret  spring. The wall gave way noiselessly. Speechless with rage he crossed  the next room and the one adjoining it, and stood in Reginald's studio.  The room was brilliantly lighted, and Reginald, still dressed, was  seated at his writing-table scribbling notes upon little scraps of paper  in his accustomed manner.    At Ernest's approach he looked up without evincing the least sign of  terror or surprise. Calmly, almost majestically, he folded his arms over  his breast, but there was a menacing glitter in his eyes as he  confronted his victim.          XXX      Silently the two men faced each other. Then Ernest hissed:    \"Thief!\"    Reginald shrugged his shoulders.    \"Vampire!\"    \"So Ethel has infected you with her absurd fancies! Poor boy! I am  afraid.... I have been wanting to tell you for some time.... But I  think... We have reached the parting of our road!\"    \"And that you dare to tell me!\"    The more he raged, the calmer Reginald seemed to become.    \"Really,\" he said, \"I fail to understand.... I must ask you to leave my  room!\"    \"You fail to understand? You cad!\" Ernest cried. He stepped to the  writing-table and opened the secret drawer"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17149"],[0,"Creative Chemistry: Descriptive of Recent Achievements in the Chemical (#15)"],[1,"from her scarlet uniform when khaki would be safer,  and I can't imagine that to a shellfish it was of advantage to turn red  as it rots or to an indigo plant that its leaves in decomposing should  turn blue. But anyhow, it was man that took advantage of them until he  learned how to make his own dyestuffs.    Our independent ancestors got along so far as possible with what grew in  the neighborhood. Sweetapple bark gave a fine saffron yellow. Ribbons  were given the hue of the rose by poke berry juice. The Confederates in  their butternut-colored uniform were almost as invisible as if in khaki  or _feldgrau_. Madder was cultivated in the kitchen garden. Only logwood  from Jamaica and indigo from India had to be imported. That we are not  so independent today is our own fault, for we waste enough coal tar to  supply ourselves and other countries with all the new dyes needed. It is  essentially a question of economy and organization. We have forgotten  how to economize, but we have learned how to organize.    The British Government gave the discoverer of mauve a title, but it did  not give him any support in his endeavors to develop the industry,  although England led the world in textiles and needed more dyes than any  other country. So in 1874 Sir William Perkin relinquished the attempt to  manufacture the dyes he had discovered because, as he said, Oxford and  Cambridge refused to educate chemists or to carry on research. Their  students, trained in the classics for the profession of being a  gentleman, showed a decided repugnance to the laboratory on account of  its bad smells. So when Hofmann went home he virtually took the infant  industry along with him to Germany, where Ph.D.'s were cheap and  plentiful and not afraid of bad smells. There the business throve  amazingly, and by 1914 the Germans were manufacturing more than  three-fourths of all the coal-tar products of the world and supplying  material for most of the rest. The British cursed the universities for  thus imperiling the nation through their narrowness and neglect; but  this accusation, though natural, was not altogether fair, for at least  half the blame should go to the British dyer, who did not care where his  colors came from, so long as they were cheap. When finally the  universities did turn over a new leaf and began to educate chemists, the  manufacturers would not employ them. Before the war six English  factories producing dyestuffs employed only 35 chemists altogether,  while one German color works, the Hoechster Farbwerke, employed 307  expert chemists and 74 technologists.    This firm united with the six other leading dye companies of Germany on  January 1, 1916, to form a trust to last for fifty years. During this  time they will maintain uniform prices and uniform wage scales and hours  of labor, and exchange patents and secrets. They will divide the foreign  business _pro rata_ and share the profits. The German chemical works  made big profits during the war, mostly from munitions and medicines,  and will be, through this new combination, in a stronger position than  ever to push the export trade.    As a consequence of letting the dye business get away from her, England  found herself in a fix when war broke out. She did not have dyes for her  uniforms and flags, and she did not have drugs for her wounded. She  could not take advantage of the blockade to capture the German trade in  Asia and South America, because she could not color her textiles. A blue  cotton dyestuff that sold before the war at sixty cents a pound, brought  $34 a pound. A bright pink rhodamine formerly quoted at a dollar a pound  jumped to $48. When one keg of dye ordinarily worth $15 was put up at  forced auction sale in 1915 it was knocked down at $1500. The  Highlanders could not get the colors for their kilts until some German  dyes were smuggled into England. The textile industries of Great  Britain, that brought in a billion dollars a year and employed one and a  half million workers, were crippled for lack of dyes. The demand for  high explosives from the front could not be met because these also are  largely coal-tar products. Picric acid is both a dye and an explosive.  It is made from carbolic acid and the famous trinitrotoluene is made  from toluene, both of which you will find in the list of the ten  fundamental \"crudes.\"    Both Great Britain and the United States realized the danger of allowing  Germany to recover her former monopoly, and both have shown a readiness  to cast overboard their traditional policies to meet this emergency. The  British Government has discovered that a country without a tariff is a  land without walls. The American Government has discovered that an  industry is not benefited by being cut up into small pieces. Both  governments are now doing all they can to build up big concerns and to  provide them with protection. The British Government assisted in the  formation of a national company for the manufacture of synthetic dyes by  taking one-sixth of the stock and providing $500,000 for a research  laboratory. But this effort is now reported to be \"a great failure\"  because the Government put it in charge of the politicians instead of  the chemists.    The United States, like England, had become dependent upon Germany for  its dyestuffs. We imported nine-tenths of what we used and most of those  that were produced here were made from imported intermediates. When the  war broke out there were only seven firms and 528 persons employed in  the manufacture of dyes in the United States. One of these, the  Schoelkopf Aniline and Chemical Works, of Buffalo, deserves mention, for  it had stuck it out ever since 1879, and in 1914 was making 106 dyes. In  June, 1917, this firm, with the encouragement of the Government Bureau  of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, joined with some of the other American  producers to form a trade combination, the National Aniline and Chemical  Company. The Du Pont Company also entered the field on an extensive  scale and soon there were 118 concerns engaged in it with great profit.  During the war $200,000,000 was invested in the domestic dyestuff  industry. To protect this industry Congress put on a specific duty of  five cents a pound and an ad valorem duty of 30 per cent. on imported  dyestuffs; but if, after five years, American manufacturers are not  producing 60 per cent. in value of the domestic consumption, the  protection is to be removed. For some reason, not clearly understood and  therefore hotly discussed, Congress at the last moment struck off the  specific duty from two of the most important of the dyestuffs, indigo  and alizarin, as well as from all medicinals and flavors.    The manufacture of dyes is not a big business, but it is a strategic  business. Heligoland is not a big island, but England would have been  glad to buy it back during the war at a high price per square yard.  American industries employing over two million men and women and  producing over three billion dollars' worth of products a year are  dependent upon dyes. Chief of these is of course textiles, using more  than half the dyes; next come leather, paper, paint and ink. We have  been importing more than $12,000,000 worth of coal-tar products a year,  but the cottonseed oil we exported in 1912 would alone suffice to pay  that bill twice over. But although the manufacture of dyes cannot be  called a big business, in comparison with some others, it is a paying  business when well managed. The German concerns paid on an average 22  per cent. dividends on their capital and sometimes as high as 50 per  cent. Most of the standard dyes have been so long in use that the  patents are off and the processes are well enough known. We have the  coal tar and we have the chemists, so there seems no good reason why we  should not make our own dyes, at least enough of them so we will not be  caught napping as we were in 1914. It was decidedly humiliating for our  Government to have to beg Germany to sell us enough colors to print our  stamps and greenbacks and then have to beg Great Britain for permission  to bring them over by Dutch ships.    The raw material for the production of coal-tar products we have in  abundance if we will only take the trouble to save it. In 1914 the crude  light oil collected from the coke-ovens would have produced only about  4,500,000 gallons of benzol and 1,500,000 gallons of toluol, but in 1917  this output was raised to 40,200,000 gallons of benzol and 10,200,000 of  toluol. The toluol was used mostly in the manufacture of trinitrotoluol  for use in Europe. When the war broke out in 1914 it shut off our supply  of phenol (carbolic acid) for which we were dependent upon foreign  sources. This threatened not only to afflict us with headaches by  depriving us of aspirin but also to removed the consolation of music,  for phenol is used in making phonographic records. Mr. Edison with his  accustomed energy put up a factory within a few weeks for the  manufacture of synthetic phenol. When we entered the war the need for  phenol became yet more imperative, for it was needed to make picric  acid for filling bombs. This demand was met, and in 1917 there were  fifteen new plants turning out 64,146,499 pounds of phenol valued at  $23,719,805.    Some of the coal-tar products, as we see, serve many purposes. For  instance, picric acid appears in three places in this book. It is a high  explosive. It is a powerful and permanent yellow dye as any one who has  touched it knows. Thirdly it is used as an antiseptic to cover burned  skin. Other coal-tar dyes are used for the same purpose, \"malachite  green,\" \"brilliant green,\" \"crystal violet,\" \"ethyl violet\" and  \"Victoria blue,\" so a patient in a military hospital is decorated like  an Easter egg. During the last five years surgeons have unfortunately  had unprecedented opportunities for the study of wounds and fortunately  they have been unprecedentedly "]]]
