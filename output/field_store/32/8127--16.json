In this the enemy could retire, when dislodged from their first  position.    Charlie's heart beat fast when he heard the order given to advance.  The enemy outnumbered them by five to one, and were in a strong  position. As the English advanced, the enemy's two field pieces opened  upon them. Only three men were killed, and, led by their officers, the  men went at the grove at the double. The enemy at once evacuated it,  and took refuge in the tank, from behind whose high bank they opened  fire upon the English.    Clive at once divided his men into two columns, and sent them round to  attack the tank upon two sides. The movement was completely  successful. At the same moment the men went with a rush at the banks,  and upon reaching the top opened a heavy fire upon the crowded mass  within. These at once fled in disorder.    Clive then summoned the fort to surrender; but the commander, seeing  that Clive had no battering train, refused to do so; and Clive fell  back upon Arcot again, until his eighteen-pounders should arrive.    For the next eight days, the troops were engaged in throwing up  defences, and strengthening and victualling the fort. The enemy,  gaining confidence, gathered to the number of three thousand, and  encamped three miles from the town, proclaiming that they were about  to besiege; and at midnight on the 14th Clive sallied out, took them  by surprise, and dispersed them.    The two eighteen-pounders, for which Clive had sent to Madras, were  now well upon the road, under the protection of a small body of  Sepoys, and were approaching Conjeveram. The enemy sent a considerable  body of troops to cut off the guns, and Clive found that the small  number which he had sent out, to meet the approaching party, would not  be sufficient. He therefore resolved to take the whole force, leaving  only sufficient to garrison the fort.    The post which the enemy occupied was a temple near Conjeveram, and as  this was twenty-seven miles distant, the force would be obliged to be  absent for at least two days. As it would probably be attacked, and  might have to fight hard, he decided on leaving only thirty Europeans  and fifty Sepoys within the fort. He appointed Doctor Rae to the  command of the post during his absence, and placed Charlie and Peters  under his orders.    \"I wonder whether they will have any fighting,\" Charlie said, as the  three officers looked from the walls of the fort after the departing  force.    \"I wish we had gone with them,\" Peters put in; \"but it will be a long  march, in the heat.\"    \"I should think,\" Doctor Rae said, \"that they are sure to have  fighting. I only hope they may not be attacked at night. The men are  very young and inexperienced, and there is nothing tries new soldiers  so much as a night attack. However, from what I hear of their own  wars, I believe that night attacks are rare among them. I don't know  that they have any superstition on the subject, as some African people  have, on the ground that evil spirits are about at night; but the  natives are certainly not brisk, after nightfall. They are extremely  susceptible to any fall of temperature, and as you have, of course,  noticed, sleep with their heads covered completely up. However, we  must keep a sharp lookout here, tonight.\"    \"You don't think that we are likely to be attacked, sir, do you?\"    \"It is possible we may be,\" the doctor said. \"They will know that  Captain Clive has set out from here, with the main body, and has left  only a small garrison. Of course they have spies, and will know that  there are only eighty men here, a number insufficient to defend one  side of this fort, to say nothing of the whole circle of the walls.  They have already found out that the English can fight in the open,  and their experience at Timari will make them shy of meeting us again.  Therefore, it is just possible that they may be marching in this  direction today, while Clive is going in the other, and that they may  intend carrying it with a rush.    \"I should say, today let the men repose as much as possible; keep the  sentries on the gates and walls, but otherwise let them all have  absolute quiet. You can tell the whites, and I will let the Sepoys  know, that they will have to be in readiness all night, and that they  had better, therefore, sleep as much as possible today. We will take  it by turns to be on duty, one going round the walls and seeing that  the sentries are vigilant, while the others sit in the shade and doze  off, if they can. We must all three keep on the alert, during the  night.\"    Doctor Rae said that he, himself, would see that all went well for the  first four hours, after which Charlie should go on duty; and the two  subalterns accordingly made themselves as comfortable as they could in  their quarters, which were high up in the fort, and possessed a window  looking over the surrounding country.    \"Well, Tim, what is the matter with you?\" they asked that soldier, as  he came in with an earthenware jar of water, which he placed to cool  in the window. \"You look pale.\"    \"And it's pale I feel, your honor, with the life frightened fairly out  of me, a dozen times a day. It was bad enough on the march, but this  place just swarms with horrible reptiles. Shure an' it's a pity that  the holy Saint Patrick didn't find time to pay a visit to India. If  he'd driven the varmint into the sea for them, as he did in Ireland,  the whole population would have become Christians, out of pure  gratitude. Why, yer honor, in the cracks and crevices of the stones of  this ould place there are bushels and bushels of 'em. There are things  they call centipades, with a million legs on each side of them, and  horns big enough to frighten ye; of all sizes up to as long as my hand  and as thick as my finger; and they say that a bite from one of them  will put a man in a raging fever, and maybe kill him. Then there are  scorpions, the savagest looking little bastes ye ever saw, for all the  world like a little lobster with his tail turned over his back, and a  sting at the end of it. Then there's spiders, some of 'em nigh as big  as a cat.\"    \"Oh, nonsense, Tim!\" Charlie said; \"I don't think, from what I've  heard, that there's a spider in India whose body is as big as a  mouse.\"    \"It isn't their body, yer honor. It's their legs. They're just cruel  to look at. It was one of 'em that gave me a turn, a while ago. I was  just lying on my bed smoking my pipe, when I saw one of the creatures  (as big as a saucer, I'll take my oath) walking towards me with his  wicked eye fixed full on me. I jumped off the bed and on to a bench  that stood handy.    \"'What are ye yelling about, Tim Kelly?' said Corporal Jones to me.    \"'Here's a riotous baste here, corporal,' says I, 'that's meditating  an attack on me.'    \"'Put your foot on it, man,' says he.    \"'It's mighty fine,' says I, 'and I in my bare feet.'    \"So the corporal tells Pat Murphy, my right-hand man, to tackle the  baste. I could see Pat didn't like the job ayther, yer honor, but he's  not the boy to shrink from his duty; so he comes and he takes post on  the form by my side, and just when the cratur is making up his mind to  charge us both, Pat jumps down upon him and squelched it.    \"Shure, yer honor, the sight of such bastes is enough to turn a  Christian man's blood.\"    \"The spider had no idea of attacking you, Kelly,\" Peters said,  laughing. \"It might possibly bite you in the night, though I do not  think it would do so; or if you took it up in your fingers.\"    \"The saints defind us, yer honor! I'd as soon think of taking a tiger  by the tail. The corporal, he's an Englishman, and lives in a country  where they've got snakes and reptiles; but it's hard on an Irish boy,  dacently brought up within ten miles of Cork's own town, to be exposed  to the like.    \"And do ye know, yer honor, when I went out into the town yesterday,  what should I see but a man sitting down against a wall, with a little  bit of a flute in his hand, and a basket by his side. Well, yer honor,  I thought maybe he was going to play a tune, when he lifts up the top  of the basket and then began to play. Ye may call it music, yer honor,  but there was nayther tune nor music in it.    \"Then all of a suddint two sarpents in the basket lifts up their  heads, with a great ear hanging down on each side, and began to wave  themselves about.\"    \"Well, Tim, what happened then?\" Charlie asked, struggling with his  laughter.    \"Shure it's little I know what happened after, for I just took to my  heels, and I never drew breath till I was inside the gates.\"    \"There was nothing to be frightened at, Tim,\" Charlie said. \"It was a  snake charmer. I have never seen one yet, but there are numbers of  them all over India. Those were not ears you saw, but the hood. The  snakes like the music, and wave their heads about in time to it. I  believe that, although they are a very poisonous snake and their bite  is certain death, there is no need to be afraid of them, as the  charmers draw out their poison fangs when they catch them.\"    \"Do they, now?\" Tim said, in admiration. \"I wonder what the regimental  barber would say to a job like that, now. He well nigh broke Dan  Sullivan's jaw, yesterday, in getting out a big tooth; and then swore  at the poor boy, for having such a powerful strong jaw. I should like  to see his face, if he was asked to pull out a tooth from one of them  dancing sarpents.    \"I brought ye in some fruits, yer honors. I don't know what they are,  but you may trust me, they're not poison. I stopped for half an hour  beside the stall, till I saw some of the people of the country buying  and ating them. So then I judged that they were safe for yer honors.\"    \"Now, Tim, you'd better go and lie down and get a sleep, if the  spiders will let you, for you will have to be under arms all night, as  it is possible that we may be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18837"],[0,"Commentarii de Bello Gallico (#15)"],[1,"causa vagarentur. Longo circuitu easdem omnes iubet  petere regiones. Haec procul ex oppido videbantur, ut erat a Gergovia  despectus in castra, neque tanto spatio certi quid esset explorari  poterat. Legionem unam eodem iugo mittit et paulum progressam inferiore  constituit loco silvisque occultat. Augetur Gallis suspicio, atque omnes  illo ad munitionem copiae traducuntur. Vacua castra hostium Caesar  conspicatus tectis insignibus suorum occultatisque signis militaribus  raros milites, ne ex oppido animadverterentur, ex maioribus castris in  minora traducit legatisque, quos singulis legionibus praefecerat, quid  fieri velit ostendit: in primis monet ut contineant milites, ne studio  pugnandi aut spe praedae longius progrediantur; quid iniquitas loci  habeat incommodi proponit: hoc una celeritate posse mutari; occasionis  esse rem, non proeli. His rebus expositis signum dat et ab dextra parte  alio ascensu eodem tempore Aeduos mittit.      46    Oppidi murus ab planitie atque initio ascensus recta regione, si nullus  anfractus intercederet, MCC passus aberat: quidquid huc circuitus ad  molliendum clivum accesserat, id spatium itineris augebat. A medio fere  colle in longitudinem, ut natura montis ferebat, ex grandibus saxis sex  pedum murum qui nostrorum impetum tardaret praeduxerant Galli, atque  inferiore omni spatio vacuo relicto superiorem partem collis usque ad  murum oppidi densissimis castris compleverant. Milites dato signo  celeriter ad munitionem perveniunt eamque transgressi trinis castris  potiuntur; ac tanta fuit in castris capiendis celeritas, ut Teutomatus,  rex Nitiobrigum, subito in tabernaculo oppressus, ut meridie  conquieverat, superiore corporis parte nudata vulnerato equo vix se ex  manibus praedantium militum eriperet.      47    Consecutus id quod animo proposuerat, Caesar receptui cani iussit  legionique decimae, quacum erat, continuo signa constituit. Ac  reliquarum legionum milites non exaudito sono tubae, quod satis magna  valles intercedebat, tamen ab tribunis militum legatisque, ut erat a  Caesare praeceptum, retinebantur. Sed elati spe celeris victoriae et  hostium fuga et superiorum temporum secundis proeliis nihil adeo arduum  sibi esse existimaverunt quod non virtute consequi possent, neque finem  prius sequendi fecerunt quam muro oppidi portisque appropinquarunt. Tum  vero ex omnibus urbis partibus orto clamore, qui longius aberant  repentino tumultu perterriti, cum hostem intra portas esse existimarent,  sese ex oppido eiecerunt. Matres familiae de muro vestem argentumque  iactabant et pectore nudo prominentes passis manibus obtestabantur  Romanos, ut sibi parcerent neu, sicut Avarici fecissent, ne a mulieribus  quidem atque infantibus abstinerent: nonnullae de muris per manus  demissae sese militibus tradebant. Lucius Fabius, centurio legionis  VIII, quem inter suos eo die dixisse constabat excitari se Avaricensibus  praemiis neque commissurum, ut prius quisquam murum ascenderet, tres  suos nactus manipulares atque ab eis sublevatus murum ascendit: hos ipse  rursus singulos exceptans in murum extulit.      48    Interim ei qui ad alteram partem oppidi, ut supra demonstravimus,  munitionis causa convenerant, primo exaudito clamore, inde etiam crebris  nuntiis incitati, oppidum a Romanis teneri, praemissis equitibus magno  concursu eo contenderunt. Eorum ut quisque primus venerat, sub muro  consistebat suorumque pugnantium numerum augebat. Quorum cum magna  multitudo convenisset, matres familiae, quae paulo ante Romanis de muro  manus tendebant, suos obtestari et more Gallico passum capillum  ostentare liberosque in conspectum proferre coeperunt. Erat Romanis nec  loco nec numero aequa contentio; simul et cursu et spatio pugnae  defatigati non facile recentes atque integros sustinebant.      49    Caesar, cum iniquo loco pugnari hostiumque augeri copias videret,  praemetuens suis ad Titum Sextium legatum, quem minoribus castris  praesidio reliquerat, misit, ut cohortes ex castris celeriter educeret  et sub infimo colle ab dextro latere hostium constitueret, ut, si  nostros loco depulsos vidisset, quo minus libere hostes insequerentur  terreret. Ipse paulum ex eo loco cum legione progressus, ubi  constiterat, eventum pugnae exspectabat.      50    Cum acerrime comminus pugnaretur, hostes loco et numero, nostri virtute  confiderent, subito sunt Aedui nsi ab latere nostris aperto, quos Caesar  ab dextra parte alio ascensu manus distinendae causa miserat. Hi  similitudine armorum vehementer nostros perterruerunt, ac tametsi  dextris humeris ex sertis animadvertebantur, quod insigne pactum esse  consuerat, tamen id ipsum sui fallendi causa milites ab hostibus factum  existimabant. Eodem tempore Lucius Fabius centurio quique una murum  ascenderant circumventi atque interfecti muro praecipitabantur. Marcus  Petronius, eiusdem legionis centurio, cum portam excidere conatus esset,  a multitudine oppressus ac sibi desperans multis iam vulneribus acceptis  manipularibus suis, qui illum secuti erant, \"Quoniam,\" inquit, \"me una  vobiscum servare non possum, vestrae quidem certe vitae prospiciam, quos  cupiditate gloriae adductus in periculum deduxi. Vos data facultate  vobis consulite.\" Simul in medios hostes irrupit duobusque interfectis  reliquos a porta paulum summovit. Conantibus auxiliari suis \"Frustra,\"  inquit, \"meae vitae subvenire conamini, quem iam sanguis viresque  deficiunt. Proinde abite, dum est facultas, vosque ad legionem  recipite.\" Ita puguans post paulum concidit ac suis saluti fuit.      51    Nostri, cum undique premerentur, XLVI centurionibus amissis deiecti sunt  loco. Sed intolerantius Gallos insequentes legio decima tardavit, quae  pro subsidio paulo aequiore loco constiterat. Hanc rursus XIII legionis  cohortes exceperunt, quae ex castris minoribus eductae cum Tito Sextio  legato ceperant locum superiorem. Legiones, ubi primum planitiem  attigerunt, infestis contra hostes signis constiterunt. Vercingetorix ab  radicibus collis suos intra munitiones reduxit. Eo die milites sunt  paulo minus septingenti desiderati.      52    Postero die Caesar contione advocata temeritatem cupiditatemque militum  reprehendit, quod sibi ipsi iudicavissent quo procedendum aut quid  agendum videretur, neque signo recipiendi dato constitissent neque ab  tribunis militum legatisque retineri potuissent. Exposuit quid iniquitas  loci posset, quid ipse ad Avaricum sensisset, cum sine duce et sine  equitatu deprehensis hostibus exploratam victoriam dimisisset, ne parvum  modo detrimentum in contentione propter iniquitatem loci accideret.  Quanto opere eorum animi magnitudinem admiraretur, quos non castrorum  munitiones, non altitudo montis, non murus oppidi tardare potuisset,  tanto opere licentiam arrogantiamque reprehendere, quod plus se quam  imperatorem de victoria atque exitu rerum sentire existimarent; nec  minus se ab milite modestiam et continentiam quam virtutem atque animi  magnitudinem desiderare.      53    Hac habita contione et ad extremam orationem confirmatis militibus, ne  ob hanc causam animo permoverentur neu quod iniquitas loci attulisset id  virtuti hostium tribuerent, eadem de profectione cogitans quae ante  senserat legiones ex castris eduxit aciemque idoneo loco constituit. Cum  Vercingetorix nihil magis in aequum locum descenderet, levi facto  equestri proelio atque secundo in castra exercitum reduxit. Cum hoc idem  postero die fecisset, satis ad Gallicam ostentationem minuendam  militumque animos confirmandos factum existimans in Aeduos movit castra.  Ne tum quidem insecutis hostibus tertio die ad flumen Elaver ; pontem  refecit exercitumque traduxit.      54    Ibi a Viridomaro atque Eporedorige Aeduis appellatus discit cum omni  equitatu Litaviccum ad sollicitandos Aeduos profectum: opus esse ipsos  antecedere ad confirmandam civitatem. Etsi multis iam rebus perfidiam  Aeduorum perspectam habebat atque horum discessu admaturari defectionem  civitatis existimabat, tamen eos retinendos non constituit, ne aut  inferre iniuriam videretur aut dare timoris aliquam suspicionem.  Discedentibus his breviter sua in Aeduos merita exposuit, quos et quam  humiles accepisset, compulsos in oppida, multatos agris omnibus ereptis  copiis, imposito stipendio, obsidibus summa cum contumelia extortis, et  quam in fortunam quamque in amplitudinem deduxisset, ut non solum in  pristinum statum redissent, sed omnium temporum dignitatem et gratiam  antecessisse viderentur. His datis mandatis eos ab se dimisit.      55    Noviodunum erat oppidum Aeduorum ad ripas Ligeris opportuno loco  positum. Huc Caesar omnes obsides Galliae, frumentum, pecuniam publicam,  suorum atque exercitus impedimentorum magnam partem contulerat; huc  magnum numerum equorum huius belli causa in Italia atque Hispania  coemptum miserat. Eo cum Eporedorix Viridomarusque venissent et de statu  civitatis cognovissent, Litaviccum Bibracti ab Aeduis receptum, quod est  oppidum apud eos maximae auctoritatis, Convictolitavim magistratum  magnamque partem senatus ad eum convenisse, legatos ad Vercingetorigem  de pace et amicitia concilianda publice missos, non praetermittendum  tantum commodum existimaverunt. Itaque interfectis Novioduni custodibus  quique eo negotiandi causa convenerant pecuniam atque equos inter se  partiti sunt; obsides civitatum Bibracte ad magistratum deducendos  curaverunt; oppidum, quod a se teneri non posse iudicabant, ne cui esset  usui Romanis, incenderunt; frumenti quod subito potuerunt navibus  avexerunt, reliquum flumine atque incendio corruperunt. Ipsi ex  finitimis regionibus copias cogere, praesidia custodiasque ad ripas  Ligeris disponere equitatumque omnibus locis iniciendi timoris causa  ostentare coeperunt, si ab re frumentaria Romanos excludere aut adductos  inopia in provinciam espellere possent. Quam ad spem multum eos  adiuvabat, quod Liger ex nivibus creverat, ut omnino vado non posse  transiri videretur.      56    Quibus rebus cognitis Caesar maturandum sibi"]]]
