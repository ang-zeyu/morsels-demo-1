I beseech Thee, therefore, by Thyself and by Them, to send down, from the  right hand of the throne of Thy grace, upon all that dwell on earth, that  which shall wash them from the stain of their trespasses against Thee, and  cause them to become wholly devoted to Thy Self, O Thou in Whose hand is  the source of all gifts, that they may all arise to serve Thy Cause, and  may detach themselves entirely from all except Thee. Thou art the  Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Unrestrained.    O my God, my Master, my Best-Beloved! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy  servant. I have held fast the cord of Thy grace, and clung to the hem of  the garment of Thy loving providence. I entreat Thee, by Thy Most Great  Name, Whom Thou hast appointed as the unerring Balance among the nations,  and Thine infallible Proof unto all men, not to forsake me, nor to abandon  me to my corrupt desires. Do Thou preserve me beneath the shadow of Thy  Supreme Sinlessness, and enable me to magnify Thine own Self amidst the  concourse of Thy creatures. Withhold not from me the Divine fragrance of  Thy days, and deprive me not of the sweet savors wafting from the  Day-Spring of Thy Revelation. Bestow on me the good of this world and of  the next, through the power of Thy grace that hath encompassed all created  things and Thy mercy that hath surpassed the entire creation. Thou art He  Who holdeth in His grasp the kingdom of all things. Thou doest what Thou  willest through Thy decree, and choosest, through the power of Thy might,  whatsoever Thou desirest. None can resist Thy will; naught can exhaust the  impelling force of Thy command. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty,  the All-Glorious, the Most Bountiful.            LXIII: \"THOU BEHOLDEST, O MY GOD, THY SERVANT WHO...\"      Thou beholdest, O my God, Thy servant who dwelleth in this prison-house,  wholly detached from any one but Thee, his eyes turned in the direction of  the Day-Spring of Thy mercy, his heart longing for the wondrous  manifestations of Thy grace. Thou, O my Lord, hast reckoned up the ills  that have afflicted him in Thy path. Thou seest him compassed about with  such of Thy creatures as have transgressed and rebelled against Thee, who  have come in between him and Thy loved ones, who have fixed his abode in  this land and wronged Thee, and who have hindered Thy servants from  turning towards Thee.    For all these things I offer thanksgiving unto Thee, O my Lord! I implore  Thee to assist me and them that love me to magnify Thy Word, and to endow  us with such strength that the ills of this world and its tribulations  will be powerless to hinder us from remembering Thee and from extolling  Thy virtues. Powerful art Thou to do all things; resplendent art Thou  above all things.    Every conqueror is but a serf whom Thy hand hath subjected, and the  richest of the rich is as destitute before the immensity of Thy wealth.  The noblest of nobles is humbled when faced with the manifestations of Thy  glory, and the mightiest of potentates is a mere abject one when  confronted with the compelling evidences of Thine authority.    Tear asunder, O my God, the veil of vain imaginings that hath obscured the  vision of Thy people, that all may haste towards Thee, may tread the path  of Thy pleasure, and walk in the ways of Thy Faith. We are, O my God, Thy  servants and Thy bondsmen. Thou art sufficient unto us so that we can  dispense with the world and all that is therein. We are wholly satisfied  with all that hath befallen us in Thy path, and exclaim: \"Praised be Thou,  in Whose hand are the realms of revelation and of creation, and all the  kingdoms of earth and heaven!\"            LXIV: \"PRAISE BE TO THEE, O LORD MY GOD, MY MASTER!...\"      Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God, my Master! Thou hearest the sighing of  those who, though they long to behold Thy face, are yet separated from  Thee and far distant from Thy court. Thou testifiest to the lamentations  which those who have recognized Thee pour forth because of their exile  from Thee and their yearning to meet Thee. I beseech Thee by those hearts  which contain naught except the treasures of Thy remembrance and praise,  and which show forth only the testimonies of Thy greatness and the  evidences of Thy might, to bestow on Thy servants who desire Thee power to  approach the seat of the revelation of the splendor of Thy glory and to  assist them whose hopes are set on Thee to enter into the tabernacle of  Thy transcendent favor and mercy.    Naked am I, O my God! Clothe me with the robe of Thy tender mercies. I am  sore athirst; give me to drink of the oceans of Thy bountiful favor. I am  a stranger; draw me nearer unto the source of Thy gifts. I am sick;  sprinkle upon me the healing waters of Thy grace. I am a captive; rid me  of my bondage, by the power of Thy might and through the force of Thy  will, that I may soar on the wings of detachment towards the loftiest  summits of Thy creation. Thou, verily, doest what Thou choosest. There is  no God but Thee, the Help in Peril, the All-Glorious, the Unconstrained.            LXV: \"GLORIFIED ART THOU, O MY GOD! THOU KNOWEST THAT...\"      Glorified art Thou, O my God! Thou knowest that my sole aim in revealing  Thy Cause hath been to reveal Thee and not my self, and to manifest Thy  glory rather than my glory. In Thy path, and to attain Thy pleasure, I  have scorned rest, joy, delight. At all times and under all conditions my  gaze hath been fixed on Thy precepts, and mine eyes bent upon the things  Thou hast bidden me observe in Thy Tablets. I have wakened every morning  to the light of Thy praise and Thy remembrance, and reached every evening  inhaling the fragrances of Thy mercy.    And when the entire creation was stirred up, and the whole earth was  convulsed, and the sweet savors of Thy name, the All-Praised, had almost  ceased to breathe over Thy realms, and the winds of Thy mercy had  well-nigh been stilled throughout Thy dominions, Thou didst, through the  power of Thy might, raise me up among Thy servants, and bid me to show  forth Thy sovereignty amidst Thy people. Thereupon I arose before all Thy  creatures, strengthened by Thy help and Thy power, and summoned all the  multitudes unto Thee, and announced unto all Thy servants Thy favors and  Thy gifts, and invited them to turn towards this Ocean, every drop of the  waters of which crieth out, proclaiming unto all that are in heaven and on  earth that He is, in truth, the Fountain of all life, and the Quickener of  the entire creation, and the Object of the adoration of all worlds, and  the Best-Beloved of every understanding heart, and the Desire of all them  that are nigh unto Thee.    Though the fierce winds of the hatred of the wicked doers blew and beat on  this Lamp, He was, at no time, in His love for Thy beauty, hindered from  shedding the fragrance of His light. As the transgressions committed  against Thee waxed greater and greater, my eagerness to reveal Thy Cause  correspondingly increased, and as the tribulations deepened--and to this  Thy glory beareth me witness--a fuller measure of Thy sovereignty and of  Thy power was vouchsafed by me unto Thy creatures.    And finally, I was cast by the transgressors into the prison-city of Akka,  and my kindred were made captives in Ba_gh_dad. The power of Thy might  beareth me witness, O my God! Every trouble that hath touched me in Thy  path hath added to my joy and increased my gladness. I swear by Thee, O  Thou Who art the King of Kings! None of the kings of the earth hath power  to hinder me from remembering Thee or from extolling Thy virtues. Were  they to be leagued--as they have been leagued--against me, and to brandish  their sharpest swords and most afflictive spears against me, I would not  hesitate to magnify Thy name before all them that are in Thy heaven and on  Thy earth. Nay rather, I would cry out and say: \"This, O my Beloved, is my  face which I have offered up for Thy face, and this is my spirit which I  have sacrificed for Thy spirit, and this is my blood that seetheth in my  veins, in its longing to be shed for love of Thee and in Thy path.\"    Though--as Thou beholdest me, O my God--I be dwelling in a place within  whose walls no voice can be heard except the sound of the echo, though all  the gates of ease and comfort be shut against us, and thick darkness  appear to have compassed us on every side, yet my soul hath been so  inflamed by its love for Thee, that nothing whatsoever can either quench  the fire of its love or abate the consuming flame of its desire. Lifting  up its voice, it crieth aloud amidst Thy servants, and calleth them, at  all times and under all conditions, unto Thee.    I beseech Thee, by Thy Most Great Name, to open the eyes of Thy servants,  that they may behold Thee shining above the horizon of Thy majesty and  glory, and that they may not be hindered by the croaking of the raven from  hearkening to the voice of the Dove of Thy sublime oneness, nor be  prevented by the corrupt waters from partaking of the pure wine of Thy  bounty and the everlasting streams of Thy gifts.    Gather them, then, together around this Divine Law, the covenant of which  Thou hast established with all Thy Prophets and Thy Messengers, and Whose  ordinances Thou hast written down in Thy Tablets and Thy Scriptures. Raise  them up, moreover, to such heights as will enable them to perceive Thy  Call.    Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. Thou art, verily, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16996"],[0,"Two Old Faiths (#15)"],[1,"few in number. If a woman sees her       husband growing old, or if she happen to admire any one else, she       goes to the Shereef (the spiritual and civil head of the holy       city), and after having settled the matter with him she puts away       her husband and takes to herself another, who is, perhaps,       good-looking and rich. In this way a marriage seldom lasts more       than a year or two.    And of slave-girls the same high and impartial authority, still writing  of the holy city and of her fellow-Moslems, tells us:         Some of the women (African and Georgian girls) are taken in       marriage; and after that, on being sold again, they receive from       their masters a divorce, and are sold in their houses--that is to       say, they are sent to the purchaser from their master's house on       receipt of payment, and are not exposed for sale in the       slave-market. They are only _married_ when purchased for the first       time.... When the poorer people buy (female) slaves they keep them       for themselves, and change them every year as one would replace old       things by new; but the women who have children are not sold.[65]    [Sidenote: Islam sanctions a license between the sexes which  Christianity forbids.  The laws of Christianity deter men from carnal indulgences.  Islam the \"Easy Way.\"]  What I desire to make clear is the fact that such things may be  practiced _with the sanction_ of the Scripture which the Moslem holds to  be divine, and that these same indulgences have from the first existed  as inducements which helped materially to forward the spread of the  faith. I am very far, indeed, from implying that excessive indulgence in  polygamy is the universal state of Moslem society. Happily this is not  the case. There are not only individuals, but tribes and districts,  which, either from custom or preference, voluntarily restrict the  license given them in the Koran; while the natural influence of the  family, even in Moslem countries, has an antiseptic tendency that often  itself tends greatly to neutralize the evil.[66] Nor am I seeking to  institute any contrast between the morals at large of Moslem countries  and the rest of the world. If Christian nations are (as with shame it  must be confessed) in some strata of society immoral, it is in the teeth  of their divine law. And the restrictions of that law are calculated,  and in the early days of Christianity did tend, in point of fact, _to  deter men_ devoted to the indulgences of the flesh from embracing the  faith.[67] The religion of Mohammed, on the other hand, gives direct  sanction to the sexual indulgences we have been speaking of. Thus it  panders to the lower instincts of humanity and makes its spread the  easier. In direct opposition to the precepts of Christianity it \"makes  provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof.\" Hence Islam has  been well called by its own votaries the _Easy Way_. Once more, to quote  Al Kindy:         Thou invitest me (says our apologist to his friend) into the \"Easy       way of faith and practice.\" Alas, alas! for our Saviour in the       Gospel telleth us, \"When ye have done all that ye are commanded,       say, We are unprofitable servants; we have but done that which was       commanded us.\" Where then is our merit? The same Lord Jesus saith,       \"How strait is the road which leadeth unto life, and how few they       be that walk therein! How wide the gate that leadeth to       destruction, and how many there be that go in thereat!\" Different       this, my friend, from the comforts of thy wide and easy gate, and       the facilities for enjoying, as thou wouldst have me, the pleasures       offered by thy faith in wives and damsels![68]      FOOTNOTES:    [a] A.D. 623.    [b] A.D. 630.    [c] A.D. 632.    [d] A.D. 635.          II.    WHY THE SPREAD OF ISLAM WAS STAYED.      [Sidenote: Islam stationary in area, and in civilization retrograde.]  Having thus traced the rapid early spread of Islam to its proper source,  I proceed to the remaining topics, namely, the causes which have checked  its further extension, and those likewise which have depressed the  followers of this religion in the scale of civilization. I shall take  the former first--just remarking here, in respect of the latter, that  the depression of Islam is itself one of the causes which retard the  expansion of the faith.    [Sidenote: The Arabs ceased, in second century, to be a crusading  force.]  As the first spread of Islam was due to the sword, so when the sword was  sheathed Islam ceased to spread. The apostles and missionaries of Islam  were, as we have seen, the martial tribes of Arabia--that is to say, the  grand military force organized by Omar, and by him launched upon the  surrounding nations. Gorged with the plunder of the world, these began,  after a time, to settle on their lees and to mingle with the ordinary  population. So soon as this came to pass they lost the fiery zeal which  at the first had made them irresistible. By the second and third  centuries the Arabs had disappeared as the standing army of the  caliphate, or, in other words, as a body set apart for the dissemination  of the faith. The crusading spirit, indeed, ever and anon burst  forth--and it still bursts forth, as opportunity offers--simply for the  reason that this spirit pervades the Koran, and is ingrained in the  creed. But with the special agency created and maintained during the  first ages for the spread of Islam the incentive of crusade ceased as a  distinctive missionary spring of action, and degenerated into the common  lust of conquest which we meet with in the world at large.    [Sidenote: With cessation of conquest, Islam ceased to spread.]  The extension of Islam, depending upon military success, stopped  wherever that was checked. The religion advanced or retired, speaking  broadly, as the armed predominance made head or retroceded. Thus the  tide of Moslem victory, rushing along the coast of Africa, extinguished  the seats of European civilization on the Mediterranean, overwhelmed  Spain, and was rapidly advancing north, when the onward wave was stemmed  at Tours; and as with the arms, the faith also of Islam was driven back  into Spain and bounded by the Pyrenees. So, likewise, the hold which  the religion seized both of Spain and Sicily came to an end with  Mussulman defeat. It is true that when once long and firmly rooted, as  in India and China, Islam may survive the loss of military power, and  even flourish. But it is equally true that in no single country has  Islam been planted, nor has it anywhere materially spread, saving under  the banner of the Crescent or the political ascendency of some  neighboring State. Accordingly, we find that, excepting some barbarous  zones in Africa which have been raised thereby a step above the  groveling level of fetichism, the faith has in modern times made no  advance worth mentioning.[69]    From the Jewish and Christian religions there has (again speaking  broadly) been no secession whatever to Islam since the wave of Saracen  victory was stayed, excepting by the force of arms. Even in the palmy  days of the Abbasside caliphs, our apologist could challenge his  adversary to produce a single conversion otherwise than by reason of  some powerful material inducement. Here is his testimony:         [Sidenote: Al Kindy's challenge to produce a Christian convert to       Islam apart from material inducements.]       Now tell me, hast thou ever seen, my Friend, (the Lord be gracious       unto thee!) or ever heard of a single person of sound mind--any one       of learning and experience, and acquainted with the Scriptures,       renouncing Christianity otherwise than for some worldly object to       be reached only through thy religion, or for some gratification       withheld by the faith of Jesus? Thou wilt find none. For, excepting       the tempted ones, all continue steadfast in their faith, secure       under our most gracious sovereign, in the profession of their own       religion.[70]              III.    LOW POSITION OF ISLAM IN THE SCALE OF CIVILIZATION.      [Sidenote: Social and intellectual depression.]  I pass on to consider why Mohammedan nations occupy so low a position,  halting as almost every-where they do, in the march of social and  intellectual development.    [Sidenote: Islam intended for the Arabs.  Wants the faculty of adaptation.]  The reason is not far to find. Islam was meant for Arabia, not for the  world; for the Arabs of the seventh century, not for the Arabs of all  time; and being such, and nothing more, its claim of divine origin  renders change or development impossible. It has within itself neither  the germ of natural growth nor the lively spring of adaptation. Mohammed  declared himself a prophet to the Arabs;[71] and however much in his  later days he may have contemplated the reformation of other religions  beyond the Peninsula, or the further spread of his own (which is  doubtful), still the rites and ceremonies, the customs and the laws  enjoined upon his people, were suitable (if suitable at all) for the  Arabs of that day, and in many respects for them alone. Again, the code  containing these injunctions, social and ceremonial, as well as  doctrinal and didactic, is embodied with every particularity of detail,  as part of the divine law, in the Koran; and so defying, as sacrilege,  all human touch, it stands unalterable forever. From the stiff and rigid  shroud in which it is thus swathed the religion of Mohammed cannot  emerge. It has no plastic power beyond that exercised in its earliest  days. Hardened now and inelastic, it can neither adapt itself nor yet  shape its votaries, nor even suffer them to shape themselves to the  varying circumstances, the wants and developments, of mankind.    [Sidenote: Local ceremonies: pilgrimage.  Fast of Ramzan.]  We may judge of the local and inflexible character of the "]]]
