An examination, however, of the vision and  refraction of children with regard to the time they spent in-and  out-of-doors, showed no clear and definite result, the children who  spent the whole or most of their spare time in the streets having the  most myopia and also most normal sight. It was not possible to assert  that the outdoor life was better for the sight, or that the better sight  of the offspring of alcoholic parentage was due to the greater time  spent outdoors.    \"(8) The frequency of diseases of the eye and eyelids, which might well  be attributed to parental neglect, was found to have little, if any,  relation to parental alcoholism.    \"To sum up, then no _marked_ relation has been found between the  intelligence, physique or disease of the offspring and the parental  alcoholism in any of the categories mentioned. On the whole the balance  turns as often in favor of the alcoholic as of the non-alcoholic  parentage. It is needless to say that we do not attribute this to the  alcohol but to certain physical and possibly mental characters which  appear to be associated with the tendency to alcohol.\"    Of the many criticisms made of this work, most are irrelevant to our  present purpose, or have been satisfactorily met by the authors. It must  be said, however, that as the children examined were all school  children, the really degenerate offspring of alcoholics, if any such  existed, would not have been found, because they would not have been  admitted to the school. Further, it is not definitely known whether the  parents' alcoholism dated from before or after the birth of the child  examined. Then, the report did not exactly compare the offspring of  drinkers and non-drinkers, but classified the parents as those who  drank, and those who were sober; the latter were not, for the most part,  teetotalers, but merely persons whose use of alcohol was so moderate  that it exercised no visible bad influence on the health of the  individual or the welfare of the home. Something can be said on both  sides of all these objections; but giving them as much weight as one  thinks necessary, the fact remains that the Elderton-Pearson  investigation failed to demonstrate any racial poisoning due to alcohol,  in the kind of cases where one would certainly have expected it to be  demonstrated, if it existed.    Much more observation and measurement must be made before a  generalization can be safely drawn, as to whether alcohol is or is not a  racial poison, in the sense in which that expression is used by  eugenists. It has been shown that the evidence which is commonly  believed to prove beyond doubt that alcohol does injure the germ-plasm,  is mostly worthless. But it must not be thought that the authors intend  to deny that alcohol is a racial poison, where the dosage is very heavy  and continuous. If we have no good evidence that it is, we equally lack  evidence on the other side. We wish only to suggest caution against  making rash generalizations on the subject which lack supporting  evidence and therefore are a weak basis for propaganda.    So far as immediate action is concerned, eugenics must proceed on the  basis that there is no proof that alcohol as ordinarily consumed will  injure the human germ-plasm. To say this is not in any way to minify  the evil results which alcohol often has on the individual, or the  disastrous consequences to his offspring, euthenically. But nothing is  to be gained by making an assumption of \"racial poisoning,\" and acting  on that assumption, without evidence that it is true; and the temperance  movement would command more respect from genetics if it ceased to allege  proof that alcohol has a directly injurious effect on the race, by  poisoning the human germ-plasm, when no adequate proof exists.    How, then, can one account for the immense bulk of cases, some of which  come within everyone's range of vision, where alcoholism in the parent  is associated with defect in the offspring? By a process of exclusion,  we are driven to the explanation already indicated: that alcoholism may  be a symptom, rather than a cause, of degeneracy. Some drunkards are  drunkards, because they come of a stock that is, in a way, mentally  defective; physical defects are frequently correlated in such stocks;  naturally the children inherit part or all of the parental defects  including, very likely, alcoholism; but the parent's alcoholism, we  repeat, must not be considered the _cause_ of the child's defect. The  child would have been defective in the same way, regardless of the  parent's beverage.    It follows, then, as a practical consequence for eugenics, that in the  light of present knowledge any campaign against alcoholic liquors would  be better based on the very adequate ground of physiology and economics,  than on genetics. From the narrowest point of view of genetics, the way  to solve the liquor problem would be, not to eliminate drink, but to  eliminate the drinker: to prevent the reproduction of the degenerate  stocks and the tainted strains that contribute most of the chronic  alcoholics. We do not mean to advocate this as the only proper basis for  the temperance campaign, because the physiological and economic aspects  are of sufficient importance to keep up the campaign at twice the  present intensity.[23] But it is desirable to have the eugenic aspect of  the matter clearly understood, and to point out that in checking the  production of defectives in the United States, eugenics will do its  share, and a big share, toward the solution of the drink problem, which  is at the same time being attacked along other and equally praiseworthy  lines by other people.    A number of other substances are sometimes credited with being racial  poisons.    The poison of _Spirochaete pallida_, the microoerganism which causes  syphilis, has been widely credited with a directly noxious effect on the  germ-plasm, and the statement has been made that this effect can be  transmitted for several generations. On the other hand, healthy children  are reported as being born to cured syphilitics. Further evidence is  needed, taking care to eliminate cases of infection from the parents. If  the alleged deterioration really occurs, it will still remain to be  determined if the effect is permanent or an induction, that is, a change  in the germ-cells which does not permanently alter the nature of the  inherited traits, and which would disappear in a few generations under  favorable conditions.    The case against lead is similar. Sir Thomas Oliver, in his _Diseases of  Occupation_, sums up the evidence as follows:    \"Rennert has attempted to express in statistical terms the varying  degrees of gravity in the prognosis of cases in which at the moment of  conception both parents are the subjects of lead poisoning, also when  one alone is affected. The malign influence of lead is reflected upon  the fetus and upon the continuation of the pregnancy 94 times out of 100  when both parents have been working in lead, 92 times when the mother  alone is affected, and 63 times when it is the father alone who has  worked in lead. Taking seven healthy women who were married to lead  workers, and in whom there was a total of 32 pregnancies, Lewin (Berlin)  tells us that the results were as follows: 11 miscarriages, one  stillbirth, 8 children died within the first year after their birth,  four in the second year, five in the third year and one subsequent to  this, leaving only two children out of 32 pregnancies as likely to live  to manhood. In cases where women have had a series of miscarriages so  long as their husbands worked in lead, a change of industrial  occupation on the part of the husband restores to the wives normal  child-bearing powers.\" The data of Constantin Paul, published as long  ago as 1860, indicated that lead exercised an injurious effect through  the male as well as the female parent. This sort of evidence is  certainly weak, in that it fails to take into account the possible  effects of environment; and one would do well to keep an open mind on  the subject. In a recent series of careful experiments at the University  of Wisconsin, Leon J. Cole has treated male rabbits with lead. He  reports: \"The 'leaded' males have produced as many or more offspring  than normal fathers, but their young have averaged smaller in size and  are of lowered vitality, so that larger numbers of them die off at an  early age than is the case with those from untreated fathers.\"    [Illustration: EFFECT OF LEAD AS A \"RACIAL POISON\"    FIG. 7.--That lead poisoning can affect the germ plasm of  rabbits is indicated by experiments conducted by Leon J. Cole at the  University of Wisconsin. With reference to the above illustration,  Professor Cole writes: \"Each of the photographs shows two young from the  same litter, in all cases the mother being a normal (nonpoisoned)  albino. In each of the litters the white young is from an albino father  which received the lead treatment, while the pigmented offspring is from  a normal, homozygous, pigmented male. While these are, it is true,  selected individuals, they represent what tend to be average, rather  than extreme, conditions. The albino male was considerably larger than  the pigmented male; nevertheless his young average distinctly smaller in  size. Note also the brighter expression of the pigmented young.\"]    There is, then, a suspicion that lead is a racial poison, but no  evidence as yet as to whether the effect is permanent or in the nature  of an induction.    This concludes the short list of substances for which there has been any  plausible case made out, as racial poisons. Gonorrhea, malaria, arsenic,  tobacco, and numerous other substances have been mentioned from time to  time, and even ardently contended by propagandists to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19562"],[0,"Napoleon and the Queen of Prussia (#15)"],[1," moved by the discovery of the superintendent's treachery, but the  all-merciful God sends me this excellent man. I shall ever remember him,  and, please God, I will reward him for his kindness, by taking care of  his children.\"    \"But I trust your majesty will also remember the traitor, and cause him  to be punished,\" said Madame von Berg, indignantly. \"He has committed a  great crime against his queen and against his fatherland, and ought to  be called to account.\"    \"If he has deserved it, let God punish him,\" said Louisa, gently. \"I  shall try to forget him, and I beg you not to say any thing about it to  the king. I am afraid, my dear, we should have much, very much to do, if  we were to punish all those who betray us. The superintendent was the  first faithless subject we met, but he will not be the last. Let us  forget him. But what is that? Why does the postilion drive so fast? It  seems as if the carriage had wings. What does it mean?\"    In fact, they dashed along the road like an arrow, and, as though this  were not sufficient, the anxious voice of the footman was heard  shouting, \"Forward, postilion! Forward, as fast as possible!\"    \"There is something wrong, and I must know what it is!\" exclaimed the  queen. She rose from her seat, and opened the front window. \"Tell me  honestly and directly,\" she said to the footman, \"why does the postilion  drive so rapidly?\"    \"If your majesty commands me to do so, I must tell the truth,\" replied  he. \"We are pursued by French chasseurs. They are galloping behind us on  the high-road. I can already distinguish their uniforms.\"    \"And shall we be able to escape them?\" asked Louisa, with the semblance  of perfect calmness.    \"We hope so, your majesty. If the horses can run fifteen minutes longer,  we are safe, for then we shall be in Kuestrin.\"    \"Tell the postilion that I shall provide for the education of his  children, if we reach Kuestrin in fifteen minutes,\" replied the queen.    She then sank back for a minute like a bruised reed. A heart-rending  scream escaped her, and she raised her hand in despair. Presently she  again became composed and looked back from the window, so as to be able  to see the approaching danger.    Like lightning they proceeded along the high-road, but the chasseurs  gained upon them, and the distance rapidly decreased. The queen's  piercing eyes could already distinguish the faces of her enemies. She  heard the loud shouts and oaths with which they sought to increase their  speed. She leaned back, and a fearful pallor overspread her cheeks, but  she was still calm.    \"Listen to what I tell you, Caroline,\" she said, in a grave, solemn  voice, \"I cannot survive the disgrace of being taken prisoner by the  French. I will not adorn, as a modern Cleopatra, the triumphal entry of  the modern Augustus. To live and to die honorably is my motto. I prefer  death to ignominious captivity. Tell it to my husband and my children.  And now to the will of God I commit myself. The moment that a French  soldier extends his hand toward me, this friend will deliver me!\"    She drew a small dagger from her bosom, and grasped it firmly and  resolutely.    \"What are you going to do?\" exclaimed Caroline, in terror.    \"Hush!\" replied the queen, \"my resolution is irrevocable. Sooner death  than the disgrace of ridicule! Let us see what is going on.\"    She leaned once more out of the carriage, which was still dashing along  with the utmost rapidity. The chasseurs were fast approaching. The  panting and snorting of the foaming horses were already heard--the  flashing, triumphant eyes of the soldiers distinctly seen. Every second  brought them nearer and nearer. Louisa withdrew her head. Her right hand  firmly grasped the dagger. In breathless exhaustion, and as pale as  though dying, she awaited her fate.    Suddenly they rolled with great noise over a paved street--they  stopped--and Louisa thought it was an angel's voice, when she heard the  words, \"There is Kuestrin! We are saved!\"    She started up, and looked once more out of the window. Yes, she was  saved. The chasseurs were galloping off again, and close at hand was the  first gate of the fortress of Kuestrin. She had constantly looked back  toward the pursuing enemy, not toward her destination, and now that she  was saved, it seemed to her a miracle, for which she thanked God from  the bottom of her heart.    They passed through the gate, but could only drive at a slow pace. An  immense chaos of vehicles loaded with bedding, furniture, trunks, cases,  boxes, and bags, obstructed the passage. Shrieks, lamentations, and  oaths, resounded in the wildest confusion. All the inhabitants of the  suburbs and neighboring villages had fled hither with their movables, to  seek protection behind the walls of the fortress.    The queen had again concealed the dagger in her bosom, and looked up to  heaven with eyes full of fervent gratitude.    \"I am saved!\" she whispered; \"I shall see again my husband and my  children. Life is mine again!\"    The passage became wider. They were able to advance more rapidly, and  soon reached the market-place. A general in uniform was just crossing  it. When he was passing near her, the queen joyfully exclaimed:    \"Koeckeritz! Where is the king?\"    \"Oh, Heaven, be praised that your majesty has arrived! The king is here.  He is standing among the generals in front of the house yonder.\"    They stopped. The coach door opened, and the pale, melancholy face of  the king looked in. Louisa stretched out her arms toward him.  \"Frederick! my dear, dear husband!\" she exclaimed, and, encircling his  neck with her arms, imprinted a kiss on his lips. He did not utter a  word, but drew her with an impetuous motion into his arms and carried  her into the house, regardless of the rules of etiquette, through the  crowd of generals, who bowed and stepped aside. She clung tenderly to  him and supported her head with a blissful smile on his shoulder. He now  placed the beloved burden slowly and cautiously into an easy-chair; then  crossed the room and opened the door leading into an adjoining chamber.    \"Come, come, your mother is here!\" said he, abruptly, and two boys ran  immediately into the room, with a loud, joyous exclamation.    \"My sons, my beloved sons!\" cried Louisa, stretching out her hands  toward them. They rushed to her, clasping her in their arms and kissing  her. The queen pressed them to her heart, shedding tears, half of grief,  and half of happiness at being reunited with her family. Not a word was  spoken; only sighs and sobs, and expressions of tenderness, interrupted  the silence. The king stood at the window, looking at his wife and sons,  and something like a tear dimmed his eyes. \"I would gladly die if they  could only be happy again,\" he murmured to himself; \"but we are only in  the beginning of our misfortunes, and worse things are in store for us!\"    He was right; worse things were in store for them. Day after day  brought tidings of fresh disasters. The first was, that Erfurt had  capitulated, on the day after the battle of Jena--that the French  occupied it, and that a garrison of four thousand men had surrendered at  discretion. Then came the news that the French, who had not met with the  slightest resistance, and were driving every thing before them, had  crossed the Elbe, and were moving on Potsdam and Berlin. The royal  couple learned at the same time that Count Schulenburg had left Berlin  with the troops without permission, and solely on his own  responsibility, and that he had forgotten in his hurry to remote the  immense quantity of arms from the arsenal. Another day dawned and  brought even more disastrous tidings. The French were reported as  approaching the fortress of Kuestrin by forced marches!    A panic seized the garrison. Most of the officers and privates, and the  whole suite of the king, declared loudly, \"Peace only can save us!  Further resistance is vain, and will increase our calamities. Submission  to the conqueror may save what remains.\" Minister von Haugwitz used this  language, and so did Generals von Koeckeritz and von Zastrow, and so  thought the commander of Kuestrin, though he did not utter his  sentiments.    The king listened to all these supplications and suggestions with grave  and gloomy composure. He did not say a word, but looked sometimes with  an inquiring glance at the pale face of the queen. She understood him,  and whispered with a smile: \"Courage, my husband, courage!\" And he  nodded to her, and said in a low voice: \"I will have courage to the  bitter end! We cannot remain here, for the report that the French are  approaching has been confirmed. Let us go to Graudenz!\"    Louisa laid her hand on the king's shoulder, and looked tenderly into  his eyes. \"Whither you go, I go,\" she said, \"even though we should be  compelled to escape beyond the sea or into the ice-fields of Siberia; we  will remain together, and so long as I am with you, adversity cannot  break my heart.\"    Frederick kissed her and then went to make the necessary arrangements  for their departure, to give his final orders to the commander of  Kuestrin, M. von Ingelsheim: \"Defend the fortress to the last extremity,  and capitulate under no circumstances whatever.\"    The queen seemed calm and composed so long as her husband was at her  side. But when he had withdrawn, she burst into tears; sinking down on a  chair, she buried her face in her hands and sobbed aloud.    \"You are weeping!\" whispered a soft, sweet voice. \"Oh, dear mother, do  not weep,\" said another, and two heads leaned on her shoulders--the  heads of her oldest sons. She took her hands from her face, and shook  the tears from her eyes. She kissed her sons, and, placing both of them  before her, gazed at them a long time with an air of melancholy  tenderness.    \"Yes,\" she said, and while she spoke her voice became firmer, and her  face radiant--\"yes, I am weeping; nor am I ashamed of "]]]
