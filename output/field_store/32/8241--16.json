Anse had  subsided, though he was still watching the sergeant with an unrelenting  gaze. The Kentuckian tried to remember where Fowler had been during the  fracas. He had spoken up for them already, but would Muller accept his  testimony over that of his own men? There was already ill feeling between  the army and the town. Drew remembered _Don_ Cazar's encounter with  Bayliss at Kells' stable. What had Reese Topham said then? That the  captain was only waiting to make trouble for Rennie. And now here he was  himself--one of Rennie's riders--involved in a saloon fight with troopers.  Drew began to realize that this could be even worse than the physical  punishment he and Anse had suffered.    \"You ... bartender--\" The sergeant now looked to Fowler. \"What'd you see?\"    \"You ain't gonna take his word for it, for anythin' in this mudhole of a  town, are you, Sarge? They'd all lie their heads off to git a trooper into  trouble. Wouldn't you now?\" The lanky man sidled along the bar to snarl at  Fowler.    \"Stevens, shut that big mouth of yours, an' I ain't gonna say that agin!  All right, Fowler, tell me what _you_ saw!\"    Fowler slid the shotgun out of sight, apparently sure that an armistice,  at least, was assured.    \"Th' boys\"--he nodded at Drew and Anse--\"were sittin' at that table, mindin'  their own business. Helms, he went over an' picked up a book----\"    \"A book!\" Muller's craggy features mirrored astonishment. \"What book?  Why?\"    Topham moved and suddenly they were all watching him. He stooped, picked  up the dark-brown volume, and a torn page fluttered to the floor. He  gathered that up, too, and tucked it back in the proper place.    \"It would seem, Sergeant,\" he remarked, \"that there _was_ a book involved.  And if your men didn't bring it in here, then Kirby or his friend must  have. This is certainly not a cantina fixture. Hmm, _History of the  Conquest of Mexico_,\" he read the title on the cracked spine. \"There are  more books, I see.\" He stepped to the side of the overturned table,  gathered the other two volumes, and placed them together in a neat pile on  the bar. All of the men continued to watch him as if his actions were  highly significant.    \"So--\" he turned to face Muller. \"We have established that there was a  book, in fact, three books.\"    \"What'd you want with that book, Helms?\" Muller demanded.    He was met by a scowl. \"Nothin'. I was jus' funnin'--like Ben said. Then  them Rebs started playin' rough, an' we jus' gave 'em a lesson.\"    Fowler snorted. \"I say Helms started it, an' th' jumpin' went th' other  way 'round, Sergeant. An' that's all I got to say.\"    \"Well, it isn't all I have to say! Sergeant, just what is going on here?\"    Whoever, having once heard that turkey cock crow, could ever forget it,  thought Drew. Captain Bayliss strode in, powdery white dust graying his  blue blouse, his face redder and more sun peeled than ever. The troopers  behind Muller stiffened into wooden soldiers, all expression vanishing  from their features until they matched each other in exact anonymity.    \"Sergeant, take those two men into custody.\" A jerk of the head indicated  Drew and Anse. The Kentuckian straightened.    \"On what charge, Captain?\" he got out.    \"Attacking a United States soldier.\"    \"In performance of his duty, Captain?\" Reese Topham cut in. \"I hardly  think you can say that. Your men were apparently off duty. At least they  were in here, drinking, too. You _did_ serve them, Fowler?\"    \"Sure did, boss! Let's see now ... Helms, he had whisky; so did Stevens.  Mitchell, now, he had a beer----\"    \"It remains that they were attacked while wearing the uniform!\" Bayliss'  glare now included the full company before him.    \"From what I've heard, they did the attacking,\" Topham pointed out. \"At  least Helms seems to have given provocation. No, Captain Bayliss, your men  were in here drinking. They started a brawl. Your sergeant very rightly  broke it up. That's the sum of the matter!\"    Bayliss' high color was fading. \"You want it left that way, Topham?\" he  asked icily. \"This only confirms my contention that matters in Tubacca are  completely out of control, that the Rebel element has the backing of the  citizens. I shall so report it.\"    \"That is your privilege.\" Topham nodded. \"But this is still Tubacca and  not your camp, Captain. And _my_ cantina. If you want to declare my  establishment out of bounds for your men, that is also your privilege.\"    \"I do so--immediately! Sergeant, get these men out of here!\"    \"What about the prisoners, sir?\"    \"I think the captain will agree there are no prisoners,\" Topham said. \"We  would be obliged to give evidence at any army hearing, Captain. Kirby here  is not a troublemaker. I would unhesitatingly vouch for him.\"    Bayliss looked directly at Drew.    \"You have a job? A reason for being in town?\" He shot the questions as he  might have shot slugs from his Colt. Nye answered before Drew could.    \"He sure has a job, Cap'n. He's ridin' th' rough string for Rennie. An' he  came to town with them remounts you're buyin'. An' what Topham says is  true, th' kid ain't no troublemaker. He's 'bout th' most peaceful hombre I  ever rode with.\"    \"Rider for Rennie, eh? I might have known!\" Bayliss snapped. \"And what  about this one--he riding for Rennie, too?\" He pointed to Anse.    \"He's my cousin,\" Drew returned. \"He just got into town.\"    \"Another Rebel?\"    Anse stood up. \"If you mean was I with th' Confederate army, Yankee--I sure  was, from Shiloh clean through. Got me this to prove it. Do you want to  see?\" From the inner band of his hat he brought out a much creased paper.  \"No, you don't!\" He twitched the sheet away when Bayliss reached for it.  \"I'll jus' let Mister Topham read it. I want to keep it safe.\" He handed  the paper to the gambler.    \"Parole, Captain, signed and made out properly,\" Topham reported. \"Dated  in Tennessee for a prisoner of war--June, 1865. I hardly think you can  claim this is one of Kitchell's men, if that is what you have in mind.\"    \"No, but he'll be out of this town or he'll answer to me. Both of you--next  time you step over the line, I'm taking you both in!\" Bayliss spoke now to  Nye. \"I heard young Shannon was here, that you had him in tow and that  he's seen Kitchell. I want to talk to him.\"    \"He's over to th' doc's, an' Doc'll have th' say 'bout that, Cap'n,\" Nye  replied. \"Johnny took a pretty bad crease 'longside his skull.\"    \"He'll answer a few questions that badly need answering.\" Bayliss was  already on his way to the door. Nye stepped back and let him pass. He  grinned.    \"Let him have it out with Doc. Ain't nobody runnin' a stampede over Doc  Matthews, not even th' cap'n when he's got his tail up an' ready to hook  sod with both horns. Only, lissen here, kid, maybe you'd better keep outta  sight. Seems like a man who's waitin' to catch a fella makin' his boot  mark in th' wrong pasture can sometimes do it.\"    \"Nye's right,\" Topham agreed. \"Bayliss can either catch you off guard or  see you're provoked again into doing something he can rope you in for. I'd  get back to the Range and stay there until things settle down a little and  someone else takes the good captain's mind off you.\"    \"What about Anse? You take him on, Nye?\" Drew asked.    \"I ain't got th' authority to hire, Kirby. But no reason why he can't go  down th' trail with us. Old Man is always on lookout for a good rider.  Soon as we see how Johnny's doin', we'll head south. I already sent  Greyfeather back to tell the Old Man th' kid's hurt an' up here. Reese,  what'd you think 'bout Bayliss? That he'll try to take over runnin' the  town?\"    \"Might just,\" the gambler replied.    \"_Could_ he do it?\"    \"I hardly think so. What he's really out for is Hunt's hide. He doesn't  want a powerful civilian ready to face up to him all the time. If he can  discredit _Don_ Cazar in this country, he figures he has it made.\"    Nye laughed shortly. \"Lordy, what bottle did he suck out a dream like  that? A lizard might jus' as well try to fight it out with a cougar an'  think he hadda chance of winnin'. This here's th' Range, an' ain't nobody  but th' Old Man runs th' Range! Bayliss, he's ridin' for a fall as will  jar them big grinnin' teeth of his right outta his jaws!\"    \"Maybe, only there can be upsets.\" Topham looked thoughtful.    \"What kind--and how?\" Drew asked quickly.    Topham was playing with the three books, setting them up, putting them  flat again. \"Hunt didn't take sides during the war, but he did have  Southern sympathies in part. After all, he was Texas-born. And Johnny  joined Howard when they raised that Confederate troop here. He retreated  with Sibley's force back east and fought through the rest of the war on  the Southern side. Yes, Bayliss, given the right circumstances and a  sympathetic listening ear in high circles, could make trouble for Rennie.  Especially if the good captain had an incident on which to hang such a  report.\"    \"You kinda shoved him into that out-of-bounds order for th' Jacks, didn't  you now?\" Nye pushed his hat to the back of his head and lit a cigarillo.    \"Muller and most of the boys can be counted on not to cause any more than  the normal pay-night disturbances. But there're some.... What _did_ happen  here today, Kirby?\"    Drew told it straight and flat in as few words as possible. And Topham's  face was sober when he had finished. The gambler brought the top book of  the pile down on the bar with a thud.    \"I don't like it!\"    \"Jus' ornery meanness, warn't it? There's always a few hombres in any  outfit as tries to push when they gits a slug or two under their belts,\"  Nye observed.    \"True. Only Helms went out of his way this time. And I'd like to know what  triggered him into it. I can understand some roughhousing on his  part--Stevens, too--providing these boys were on the prod in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20846"],[0,"Handwork in Wood (#15)"],[1," and the \"peen\" which may be a claw, pick, wedge, shovel,  chisel, awl or round head for other uses. There are altogether about  fifty styles of hammers varying in size from a jeweler's hammer to  a blacksmith's great straight-handled sledge-hammer, weighing twenty  pounds or more. They are named mostly according to their uses; as,  the riveting-hammer, Fig. 159, the upholsterer's hammer, Fig. 160,  the veneering-hammer, Fig. 162, etc. Magnetized hammers, Fig. 161, are  used in many trades for driving brads and tacks, where it is hard to  hold them in place with the fingers.    [Illustration: Fig. 158. Claw-Hammer.]    [Illustration: Fig. 159. Riveting-Hammer.]    [Illustration: Fig. 160. Upholster's Hammer.]    [Illustration: Fig. 161. Magnetized Hammer.]    [Illustration: Fig. 162. Veneering-Hammer.]    In the \"bell-faced\" hammer, the face is slightly convex, in order  that the last blow in driving nails may set the nail-head below  the surface. It is more difficult to strike a square blow with it than  with a plain-faced hammer. For ordinary woodwork the plain-faced, that  is, flat-faced claw-hammer, Fig. 158, is best. It is commonly used in  carpenter work.    It is essential that the face of the hammer be kept free from glue in  order to avoid its sticking on the nail-head and so bending the nail.  Hammers should be used to hit iron only; for hitting wood, mallets  are used. In striking with the hammer, the wrist, the elbow and the  shoulder are one or all brought into play, according to the hardness  of the blow. The essential precautions are that the handle be grasped  at the end, that the blow be square and quick, and that the wood be  not injured. At the last blow the hammer should not follow the nail,  but should be brought back with a quick rebound. To send the nail  below the surface, a nailset is used. (See below.)    [Illustration: Fig. 163. Drawing a Nail with Claw-Hammer.]    The claw is used for extracting nails. To protect the wood in  withdrawing a nail a block may be put under the hammer-head. When  a nail is partly drawn, the leverage can be greatly increased by  continuing to block up in this way, Fig. 163.    [Illustration: Fig. 164. Mallets.]    The _mallet_, Fig. 164, differs from the hammer in having a wooden  instead of a steel head. A maul or beetle is a heavy wooden mallet.  The effect of the blow of a mallet is quite different from that of  a hammer, in that the force is exerted more gradually; whereas the  effect of the hammer blow is direct, immediate, and local, and is  taken up at once. But a mallet continues to act after the first  impulse, pushing, as it were. This is because of the elasticity of the  head. A chisel, therefore, should always be driven with a mallet, for  the chisel handle would soon go to pieces under the blows of a hammer,  because of their suddenness; whereas the mallet blow which is slower  will not only drive the blade deeper with the same force, but will  not injure the handle so rapidly. Mallet-heads are made square,  cylindrical, and barrel-shaped. Carver's mallets are often turned from  one piece, hammer and head on one axis.    _Nailsets_, Fig. 165, are made with hardened points, but softer butts,  so that the hammer will not be injured. They were formerly made square  when nail heads were square, but now round ones are common. To obviate  slipping, some have \"cup points,\" that is, with a concave tip, and  some spur points.    [Illustration: Fig. 165. Using a Nailset.]    To keep the nailset in its place on the nail-head it may be held  closely against the third finger of the left hand, which rests on the  wood close to the nail. When a nailset is lacking, the head of a brad,  held nearly flat, may be used. But care is necessary to avoid bruising  the wood.      6. HOLDING TOOLS.    A. _Tools for Holding Work._    The advance in ease of handworking may largely be measured by the  facilities for holding materials or other tools. The primitive man  used no devices for holding except his hands and feet. The Japanese,  who perhaps are the most skilful of joiners, still largely use their  fingers and toes. On the other hand, Anglo-Saxons have developed an  enormous variety of methods for holding work and tools.    [Illustration: Fig. 166. Bench made with Pinned Mortise-and-Tenon  Joints, Low Back.]    [Illustration: Fig. 167. Woodworking Bench used at Pratt Institute,  Showing Self-Adjusting Upright Vise.]    _Benches._ The essential features of a work-bench are a firm, steady  table with a vise and places for tools. The joints are either pinned  or wedged mortise-and-tenon, or draw-bolt joints. The best benches  are made of maple, the tops being strips joined or tongued-and-grooved  together. It is common also to have a trough at the back of the top  of the bench, i. e., a space 6\" or 8\" wide, set lower than the upper  surface, in which tools may be placed so as not to roll off. A low  pillow, fastened at the left hand end of the trough, on which to set  planes in order that the edge of the cutter may not be injured, is an  advantage. The tool-rack is of capital importance. It has been common  in school benches to affix it to a board, which rises considerably  above the top of the bench, Fig. 169, but a better plan is to have the  top of it no higher than the bench-top, Fig. 166. Then the light on  the bench is not obscured, and when a flat top is needed for large  work it can readily be had by removing the tools. Elaborate benches  with lock drawers are also much used in the shops of large city  schools.    [Illustration: Fig. 168. A Rapid-Acting Vise.]    _Vises_ for holding wood are of three general styles, (1) those with  an upright wooden jaw, Fig. 167, which holds wide pieces of work well.  They are now made with an automatic adjusting device by which the jaw  and the face of the bench are kept parallel; (2) wooden vises with a  horizontal jaw, guided by parallel runners, Fig. 166, and, (3) metal  rapid-acting vises, Fig. 168. The latter are the most durable and  in most respects more convenient. Special vises are also made for  wood-carvers, for saw-filing, etc.    [Illustration: Fig. 169. Holding a Large Board in Vise for Planing.]    The best woodworking benches are equipped with both side- and  tail-vises. The tail-vise is supplemented by movable bench-stops for  holding pieces of different lengths. In planing the side of a board it  is held in place between the tail-vise and one of the bench-stops. A  board should not be squeezed sidewise between the jaws of a vise when  it is to be planed, lest it be bent out of shape. In planing the edge  of a board it is ordinarily held in the side-vise. A long board, one  end of which is in the vise, may also need to be supported at the  other end. This may be done by clamping to it a handscrew, the jaw of  which rests on the top of the bench, Fig. 169. When the vise is likely  to be twisted out of square by the insertion of a piece of wood at one  end of it, it is well to insert another piece of equal thickness at  the other end of the vise to keep it square, as in Fig. 120, p. 82. In  this case, (Fig. 120,) the extra piece also supports the piece being  worked upon.    [Illustration: Fig. 170. Saw-Horse.]    The vise is also of great use in carrying on many other processes, but  a good workman does not use it to the exclusion of the saw-horse and  bench-hook.    Horses are of great use both for the rough sawing of material and in  supporting large pieces during the process of construction. The common  form is shown in Fig. 170, but a more convenient form for sawing has  an open top, as in Fig. 171.    [Illustration: Fig. 171. Saw-Horse.]    The _picture-frame-vise_, Fig. 172, is a very convenient tool for  making mitered joints, as in picture-frames. The vise holds two sides  firmly so that after gluing they may be either nailed together or a  spline inserted in a saw cut previously made. See Fig. 268, No. 55, p.  181. If the last joint in a picture-frame does not quite match, a kerf  may be sawn at the junction of the two pieces, which can then be drawn  close together.    [Illustration: Fig. 172. Picture-Frame-Vise.]    _Handscrews_, Fig. 173, consist of four parts, the shoulder jaw and  the screw jaw, made of maple, and the end spindle and the middle  spindle, made of hickory. The parts when broken can be bought  separately. Handscrews vary in size from those with jaws four inches  long to those with jaws twenty-two inches long. The best kind are  oiled so that glue will not adhere to them. In adjusting the jaws, if  the handle of the middle spindle is held in one hand, and the handle  of the end spindle in the other hand, and both are revolved together,  the jaws may be closed or opened evenly, Fig. 174. In use care must  be taken to keep the jaws parallel, in order to obtain the greatest  pressure and to prevent the spindles from being broken. It is always  important to have the jaws press on the work evenly. To secure  this, the middle spindle should be tightened first, and then the end  spindle. Handscrews are convenient for a great variety of uses, as  clamping up glued pieces, holding pieces together temporarily for  boring, Fig. 247, p. 153, holding work at any desired angle in the  vise, as for chamfering or beveling, Fig. 175, etc.    [Illustration: Fig. 173. Handscrew.]    _Clamps_ are made of both wood and iron, the most satisfactory for  speed, strength, and durability are steel-bar carpenter clamps, Fig.  176. They vary in length from 1-1/2 ft. to 8 ft. The separate parts  are the steel bar A, the cast-iron frame B, the tip C into which fits  the screw D, on the other end of which is the crank E, and the slide F  with its dog G, which engages in the notches on the bar. Any part, if  broken, can be replaced separately.    [Illustration: Fig. 174. Adjusting Handscrew.]    _Iron Handscrews_, also called C clamps and carriage-makers' clamps.  Fig. 177, are useful in certain kinds of work,"]]]
