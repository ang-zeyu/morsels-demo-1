[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20496"],[0,"Legends of the Rhine (#15)"],[1,"lord of Liebenstein was not granted a lasting happiness with his  beautiful wife. She fled with a knight who had long enjoyed the lavish  hospitality at castle Liebenstein. Conrad, overcome by sorrow and  disgrace, threw himself from a pinnacle of the castle into the depths  below.    The strongholds then fell into the hands of Knight Broemser of  Ruedesheim, and since that time have fallen into ruins. The church and  cloister still remain in the valley, and are the scene of many a  pilgrimage.          RHENSE    The Emperor Wenzel      In the middle of a beautiful meadow at Rhense near Coblenz stands the  famous historical \"king's chair.\" Here, where the lands of the three  great prelates of Cologne, Mayence and Treves join together, the  princely Seven met to choose the new ruler who was to direct the  destiny of the Holy Roman Empire.    Here Charles IV. was chosen by the free will of the Electors; here  also the Seven elected Wenzeslaus of the house of Luxemburg, Charles'  son, emperor. During his life-time Charles had exerted himself very  much over the election of his first-born son, and he even made a  pilgrimage with him to Rhense on the Rhine where, at the renowned  \"Koenigsstuhl,\" the chancellor of the kingdom, Archbishop of Mayence,  often held important conferences with their Graces of Treves and  Cologne, and the Count Palatine.    This Wenzeslaus of Bohemia had a great predilection for the Rhine and  its wines, and later on, when, less by his own merits, than by the  exertions of his father and the favour of the electors, he became  German emperor, his brother inheriting the sandy country of  Brandenburg, he had even then paid more honours to the Rhine wine than  any other of its lovers. It afforded him a greater pleasure than the  enjoyment of wearing a crown. Finding that a good drink tasted better  at the place of its origin, he often visited the brave Count Palatine  of the Rhine who dwelt in this blissful country, and who had more  casks in his cellar than there are saints' days in a year.    This proof of imperial confidence was by no means disagreeable to the  very noble Elector Ruprecht of the Palatinate, and he neglected no  opportunity of striving to ingratiate himself more and more in the  emperor's favour.    Gallant Ruprecht would not unwillingly have exchanged his little  Palatinate crown for an imperial one. Sometimes when his royal guest,  becoming very jovial from the wine he had taken, confessed that the  high dignity of emperor was becoming troublesome to him, the count  agreed with him frankly, and never failed to let his imperial master  know that the electors were discontented at his careless  administration, and would be well pleased if he retired. Emperor  Wenzel listened to all he said with perfect indifference, continuing  in the meantime to revel in his wine.    One day the emperor was sitting with his gay companions at the  Koenigsstuhl in Rhense. They were all very merry, as the cup of  Assmannshaeuser wine had already been passed round many times. This  delicious vintage was very pleasing to Wenzel, and the other drinkers  could not find words enough to praise it.    While the goblets were being handed round, and sounds of joviality  filled the royal hall, the emperor stood up suddenly and, addressing  himself to the count, said in a very light-hearted tone.    \"I think the crown which was set on my head would not be very  unsuitable to you. Well, I offer it to you, if you are able to place  before me and my companions here, a wine which tastes better than this  Assmannshaeuser.\"    There was a cunning twinkle in the count's eyes as he beckoned to his  page. After a while a servant rolled in a great cask, from which the  cups were at once filled. The count stood up and presented the first  goblet to the emperor.    \"That is my Bacharacher wine, noble lords. Taste it; I can wait for  your judgment without fear.\"    They all drank, and every face beamed with pleasure. The opinions were  undivided in favour of the fiery Bacharacher. The emperor rose and  loudly declared he preferred it to the Assmannshaeuser. He could not  praise it too highly, nor drink enough of it.    \"This wine is worth more than a thousand crowns!\" said he,  enthusiastically. Wenzel kept his word and ceded his crown to Ruprecht  of the Palatinate who, in his turn, made the emperor a present of six  waggon-loads of Bacharacher wine.          CASTLE LAHNECK    The Templars of Lahneck      On the opposite side of the Rhine from Coblenz, and towering above  Lahnstein, rises Castle Lahneck, a keep shaped somewhat in the form of  a pentagon. Lahneck succumbed to the hordes of Louis XIII. in the same  year as the castle of Heidelberg was destroyed. The following stirring  tale is associated with Lahneck.    It was the Templars of Jerusalem who erected this fortress whose  imposing watch-tower rises nearly 100 feet above the main building.  The riches of the Templars led to their destruction. The contemptible  French king, Philip the Fair, by making grave complaints to the Pope  obtained an order for the abolition of this much-abused order, and  dragged the Grand Master with fifty of his faithful followers to the  stake. Everywhere a cruel policy of extermination was immediately  adopted against the outlawed knights, the chief motive of the  persecutors being rather a desire to confiscate the rich possessions  of the Templars than any religious zeal against heretics and sinners.    Peter von Aspelt, Archbishop of Mainz, had cast envious eyes on proud  Lahneck which sheltered twelve Knights-Templars and their retainers.  Alleging some faulty conduct on the part of the soldiers of the cross,  he gave orders that the castle should be razed, and that the knights  should exchange the white mantle with the red cross for the monk's  cowl, but to this the twelve as knights _sans peur et sans reproche_  issued a stout defiance. This excited the greed and rage of the  archbishop all the more. From the pontiff, whom with his own hands he  had successfully nursed on his sick-bed at Avignon, Peter von Aspelt  procured full power over the goods and lives of the excommunicated  knights of Lahneck. He then proceeded down the Rhine with many vassals  and mercenaries, and presented the Pope's letter to the Templars, at  the same time commanding them to yield. Otherwise their castle would  be taken by storm, and the inmates as impenitent sinners would die a  shameful death on the gallows. The oldest of the twelve, a man with  silvery hair, advanced and declared in the name of his brethren, that  they were resolved to fight to the last drop of their blood, and  further, that they were quite prepared to suffer like their brethren  in France. And so the fight between such fearful odds began. Many  soldiers of the Electorate fell under the swords of the knights and  their faithful servants, but ever the furious archbishop ordered  forward new bands to fill the gaps. Day by day the ranks of the  defenders became thinner. Prominent everywhere in this hand to hand  struggle were the heroic forms of the twelve Templars, in white mantle  with blood-red cross. At last, at a breach which had been defended  with leonine courage, one of the noble twelve sank beneath his  shattered shield, and closed his eyes in death. A second shared his  fate, then a third. The others, bleeding from many wounds and aided by  the sorely diminished remnant of their retainers, redoubled their  brave efforts, but still death made havoc in their ranks. When, on the  evening of the day of fiercest onslaught the victorious besiegers  planted their banner on the captured battlement, the silver-haired  veteran, the former spokesman, stood with blood-flecked sword among  the bodies of his fallen comrades, the last survivor. Touched by such  noble heroism the archbishop informed him that he would be allowed to  surrender; but calling down the curse of heaven on worldly churchmen  and their greed of land, he raised on high his sword and rushed upon  his foes. Pierced with many wounds the last of the twelve sank to the  earth, and over the corpse of this noble man the soldiers of Mainz  pressed into the fortress itself.    Peter von Aspelt preserved Lahneck as a place of defence and residence  for an officer of the Electorate of Mainz, and nominated as first  holder of the post, Hartwin von Winningen. The castle remained in the  possession of the Electorate of Mainz for 300 years, but the sad story  of the twelve heroic Templars is remembered in the neighbourhood of  Lahneck to this day.          COBLENZ    Riza      In the first quarter of the 9th century, when the pious Ludwig, son of  Charlemagne, was struggling with his misguided children for the  imperial crown, a church was built in Coblenz to St. Castor, the  missionary who had spread christianity in the valley of the Moselle.  The four-towered edifice arose on a branch of the Rhine.    The palace of the Frankish king stood at this time on the highest  south-western point of Coblenz, on the site of a former Roman fort,  and near by was a nunnery, dedicated to St. Castor. In this building  lived Riza, a daughter of Ludwig the Pious, who had early dedicated  her life to the church. Every day this king's daughter went to mass in  the Castor church on the opposite side of the Rhine. So great grace  had Riza found in the sight of Our Lord, that like His disciple of old  on the sea of Genesareth, she walked over the Rhine dry-footed to the  holy sacrament in St. Castor's. One day, the sacred legend goes on to  say, the stream was agitated by a storm. For the first time doubt  entered the maiden's heart as her foot touched the waves. Prudently  tearing a prop from a neighbouring vineyard, she took it with her for  a staff over the troubled waters. But after a few timid steps, she  sank like St. Peter on the Galilean lake. In this wretched plight she  became full of remorse for her want of faith in God. She"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20516"],[0,"Christmas: A Story (#15)"],[1," woke that morning before Christmas  with no knowledge of this that was afoot. And yet the day was not like  any other day, because she lay there dreading it more.    She had cleared out her little sleeping room, as she had cleared the  lower floor. The chamber, with its white-plastered walls, and boards  nearly bare, and narrow white bed, had the look of a cell, in the first  light struggling through the single snow-framed window. Here, since her  childhood she had lain nightly; here she had brought her thought of Adam  Blood, and had seen the thought die and had watched with it; here she  had lain on the nights after her parents had died; here she had rested,  body-sick with fatigue, in the years that she had toiled to keep her  home. In all that time there had gone on within her many kinds of death.  She had arrived somehow at a dumb feeling that these dyings were  gradually uncovering her self from somewhere within; rather, uncovering  some self whose existence she only dimly guessed. \"They's two of me,\"  she had thought more often of late \"and we don't meet--we don't meet.\"  She lived among her neighbors without hate, without malice; for years  she had \"meant nothing but love\"--and this not negatively. The rebellion  against Christmas was against only the falsity of its meaningless  observance. The rebellion against taking the child, though somewhat  grounded in her distrust of her own fitness, was really the last vestige  of a self that had clung to her, in bitterness not toward Adam, but  toward Lily. Ever since she had known that the child was coming she had  felt a kind of spiritual exhaustion, sharpened by the strange sense of  oppression that hung upon her like an illness.    \"I feel as if something was going to happen,\" she kept saying.    In a little while she leaned toward the window at her bed's head, and  looked down the hill toward Jenny's. Her heart throbbed when she saw a  light there. Of late, when she had waked in the night, she had always  looked, but always until now the little house had been wrapped in the  darkness. Because of that light, she could not sleep again, and so  presently she rose, and in the sharp chill of the room, bathed and  dressed, though what had once been her savage satisfaction in braving  the cold had long since become mere undramatic ability to endure it  without thinking. With Mary, life and all its constructive rites had won  what the sacrificial has never been able to achieve--the soul of the  casual, of, so to say, second nature, which is last nature, and nature  triumphant.    While she was at breakfast Mis' Abby Winslow came in.    \"Mercy,\" Mis' Winslow said, \"is it breakfast--early? I've been up hours,  frosting the cakes.\"    \"What cakes?\" Mary asked idly.    Mis' Winslow flushed dully. \"I ain't baked anything much in weeks  before,\" she answered ambiguously, and hurried from the subject.    \"The little fellow's coming in on the Local, is he?\" she said. \"You  ain't heard anything different?\"    \"Nothing different,\" Mary replied. \"Yes, of course he's coming. They  left there Saturday, or I'd have heard. The man he's with is going to  get home to-night for Christmas with his folks in the City.\"    \"Going down to meet him of course, ain't you,\" Mis' Winslow pursued  easily.    \"Why, yes,\" said Mary.    \"Well,\" Mis' Winslow mounted her preparation, \"I was thinking it would  be kind of dark for you to bring him in here all alone. Don't you want I  should come over and keep up the lights and be here when you get here?\"    She watched Mary in open anxiety. If she were to refuse, it would go  rather awkwardly. To her delight Mary welcomed with real relief the  suggestion.    \"I'd be ever so much obliged,\" she said; \"I thought of asking somebody.  I'll have a little supper set out for him before I leave.\"    \"Yes, of course,\" Mis' Winslow said, eyes down. \"I'll be over about  seven,\" she added. \"If the train's on time, you'll be back here around  half past. The children want to go down with you--they can be at Mis'  Moran's when you go by. You'll walk up from the depot, won't you? You  do,\" she said persuasively; \"the little fellow'll be glad to stretch his  legs. And it'll give the children a chance to get acquainted.\"    \"I might as well,\" Mary assented listlessly. \"There's no need to hurry  home, as I know of, except keeping you waiting.\"    \"Oh, I don't mind,\" Mis' Winslow told her. \"Better come around through  town, too. It's some farther, but he'll like the lights. What's the  little chap's name?\" she asked; \"I donno's I've heard you say.\"    Mary flushed faintly. \"Do you know,\" she said, \"I don't know his name. I  can't remember that Lily ever told me. They always called him just  _Yes_, because he learned to say that first.\"    \"'_Yes!_'\" repeated Mis' Winslow, blankly. \"Why, it don't sound to me  real human.\"    Later in the day, Mis' Mortimer Bates and Mis' Moran came in to see  Mary. Both were hurried and tired, and occasionally one of them lapsed  into some mental calculation. \"We must remember something for the middle  of the table,\" Mis' Bates observed to Mis' Moran, under cover of Mary's  putting wood in the stove. And when Mary related the breaking of the  bracket lamp, the two other women telegraphed to each other a glance of  memorandum.    \"Don't it seem funny to _you_ to have Christmas coming on to-morrow and  no flurry about it?\" Mary asked.    \"_No flurry!_\" Mis' Bates burst out. \"Oh, well,\" she amended, \"of course  this Christmas does feel a little funny to all of us. Don't you think  so, Mis' Moran?\"    \"I donno,\" said Mary, thoughtfully, \"but what, when folks stop chasing  after Christmas and driving it before them, Christmas may turn around  and come to find them.\"    \"Mebbe so,\" Mis' Moran said with bright eyes, \"mebbe so. Oh, Mary,\" she  added, \"ain't it nice he's coming?\"    Mary looked at them, frowning a little. \"It seemed like the thing had to  happen,\" she said; \"it'll fit itself in.\"    Before dark she took a last look about the child's room. The owl paper,  the puppy washbasin, the huge calendar with its picture of a stag, the  shelves for whatever things of his own he had, all pleased her newly.  She had laid on his table her grandfather's Bible with pictures of  Asiatic places. Below his mirror hung his father's photograph, that  young face, with the unspeakable wistfulness of youth, looking somewhere  outside the picture. It made her think of the passionate expectation in  the face of the picture that Jenny had brought.    \"Young folks in pictures always look like they was setting store by  something that ain't true yet,\" Mary thought. \"It makes you kind of feel  you have to pitch in and make whatever it is come true, a little....\"    It was when Mis' Winslow came back toward seven o'clock that there was  news of Jenny. Mary had been twice to her door in the course of the  day, and had come away feeling, in her inquiry, strangely outside the  moment and alien to its incidence, as if she were somehow less alive  than those in Jenny's house.    \"Jenny's got a little girl,\" Mis' Winslow said.    Mary stood staring at her. It seemed impossible. It was like seeing the  hands of time move, like becoming momentarily conscious of the swing and  rush of the earth, like perceiving the sweep of the stream of stars in  which our system moves.... She was startled and abashed that the news so  seized upon her. Little that had ever happened to herself seemed so  poignant, so warmed its place in sensation. While Mis' Winslow's mind  marked time on details of time and pounds, as is the way with us  immortals when another joins our ranks, Mary was receiving more  consciousness. There are times when this gift is laid on swiftly, as  with hands, instead of coming when none knows. Rather than with the  child whom she was to meet, her thought was with Jenny as she left Mis'  Winslow in the doorway and went down the street.    \"Expect you back in about half an hour if the train's on time,\" Mis'  Winslow called.    Mary nodded, and turned into the great cathedral aisle that was Old  Trail Street, now arched and whitened, spectral in the dark, silver with  starlight....    ... Capella was in the east, high and bright, and as imperative as  speech. Mary's way lay north, so that that great sun went beside her,  and there was no one else abroad but these two. A coat of ice had  polished the walks, so she went by the road, between the long white  mounds that lined it. The road, whose curves were absorbed in the  dimness, had thus lost its look of activity and lay inert as any frozen  waterway. Only a little wind, the star's sparkle, and Mary's step and  breath seemed living things--but from the rows of chimneys up and down  the Old Trail Road, faint smoke went up, a plume, a wreath, a veil,  where the village folk, invisible within quiet roof and wall, lifted  common signals; and from here a window and there a window, a light shone  out, a point, a ray, a glow, so that one without would almost say,  \"There's home.\"    The night before Christmas; and in not one home was there any  preparation for to-morrow, Mary thought, unless one or two lawless ones  had broken bounds and contrived something, from a little remembrance for  somebody to a suet pudding. It was strange, she owned: no trees being  trimmed, no churches lighted for practice, and the shops closed as on  any other night. Only the post office had light--she went in to look in  her box. Affer was there at the telegraph window, and he accosted her.    \"Little boy's comin' to-night, is he?\" he said, as one of the sponsors  for that arrival.    \"I'm on my way to the train now,\" Mary answered, and noted the Christmas  notice with its soiled and dog-eared list still hanging on the wall. \"It  was a good move,\" she insisted to herself, as she went out into the  empty street again.    \"You got a merry Christmas without no odds of the paper or me either,\"  Affer called after her; but she did not answer"]]]
