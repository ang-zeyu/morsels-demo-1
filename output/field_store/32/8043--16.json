Say: Whatever ye  spend that is good, is for parents and kindred and orphans and those in  want and for wayfarers. And whatever ye do that is good,- Allah knoweth  it well.    P: They ask thee, (O Muhammad), what they shall spend. Say: that which  ye spend for good (must go) to parents and near kindred and orphans and  the needy and the wayfarer. And whatsoever good ye do, lo! Allah is  Aware of it.    S: They ask you as to what they should spend. Say: Whatever wealth you  spend, it is for the parents and the near of kin and the orphans and  the needy and the wayfarer, and whatever good you do, Allah surely  knows it.    002.216  Y: Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible  that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing  which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.    P: Warfare is ordained for you, though it is hateful unto you; but it  may happen that ye hate a thing which is good for you, and it may  happen that ye love a thing which is bad for you. Allah knoweth, ye  know not.    S: Fighting is enjoined on you, and it is an object of dislike to you;  and it may be that you dislike a thing while it is good for you, and it  may be that you love a thing while it is evil for you, and Allah knows,  while you do not know.    002.217  Y: They ask thee concerning fighting in the Prohibited Month. Say:  \"Fighting therein is a grave (offence); but graver is it in the sight of  Allah to prevent access to the path of Allah, to deny Him, to prevent  access to the Sacred Mosque, and drive out its members.\" Tumult and  oppression are worse than slaughter. Nor will they cease fighting you  until they turn you back from your faith if they can. And if any of you  turn back from their faith and die in unbelief, their works will bear  no fruit in this life and in the Hereafter; they will be companions of  the Fire and will abide therein.    P: They question thee (O Muhammad) with regard to warfare in the sacred  month. Say: Warfare therein is a great (transgression), but to turn  (men) from the way of Allah, and to disbelieve in Him and in the  Inviolable Place of Worship, and to expel His people thence, is a  greater sin with Allah; for persecution is worse than killing. And they  will not cease from fighting against you till they have made you  renegades from your religion, if they can. And whoso becometh a  renegade and dieth in his disbelief: such are they whose works have  fallen both in the world and the Hereafter. Such are rightful owners of  the Fire: they will abide therein.    S: They ask you concerning the sacred month about fighting in it. Say:  Fighting in it is a grave matter, and hindering (men) from Allah's way  and denying Him, and (hindering men from) the Sacred Mosque and turning  its people out of it, are still graver with Allah, and persecution is  graver than slaughter; and they will not cease fighting with you until  they turn you back from your religion, if they can; and whoever of you  turns back from his religion, then he dies while an unbeliever-- these  it is whose works shall go for nothing in this world and the hereafter,  and they are the inmates of the fire; therein they shall abide.    002.218  Y: Those who believed and those who suffered exile and fought (and  strove and struggled) in the path of Allah,- they have the hope of the  Mercy of Allah: And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.    P: Lo! those who believe, and those who emigrate (to escape the  persecution) and strive in the way of Allah, these have hope of Allah's  mercy. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.    S: Surely those who believed and those who fled (their home) and strove  hard in the way of Allah these hope for the mercy of Allah and Allah is  Forgiving, Merciful.    002.219  Y: They ask thee concerning wine and gambling. Say: \"In them is great  sin, and some profit, for men; but the sin is greater than the profit.\"  They ask thee how much they are to spend; Say: \"What is beyond your  needs.\" Thus doth Allah Make clear to you His Signs: In order that ye  may consider-    P: They question thee about strong drink and games of chance. Say: In  both is great sin, and (some) utility for men; but the sin of them is  greater than their usefulness. And they ask thee what they ought to  spend. Say: that which is superfluous. Thus Allah maketh plain to you  (His) revelations, that haply ye may reflect.    S: They ask you about intoxicants and games of chance. Say: In both of  them there is a great sin and means of profit for men, and their sin is  greater than their profit. And they ask you as to what they should  spend. Say: What you can spare. Thus does Allah make clear to you the  communications, that you may ponder,    002.220  Y: (Their bearings) on this life and the Hereafter. They ask thee  concerning orphans. Say: \"The best thing to do is what is for their  good; if ye mix their affairs with yours, they are your brethren; but  Allah knows the man who means mischief from the man who means good. And  if Allah had wished, He could have put you into difficulties: He is  indeed Exalted in Power, Wise.\"    P: Upon the world and the Hereafter. And they question thee concerning  orphans. Say: To improve their lot is best. And if ye mingle your  affairs with theirs, then (they are) your brothers. Allah knoweth him  who spoileth from him who improveth. Had Allah willed He could have  overburdened you. Allah is Mighty, Wise.    S: On this world and the hereafter. And they ask you concerning the  orphans Say: To set right for them (their affairs) is good, and if you  become co-partners with them, they are your brethren; and Allah knows  the mischief-maker and the pacemaker, and if Allah had pleased, He  would certainly have caused you to fall into a difficulty; surely Allah  is Mighty, Wise.    002.221  Y: Do not marry unbelieving women (idolaters), until they believe: A  slave woman who believes is better than an unbelieving woman, even  though she allures you. Nor marry (your girls) to unbelievers until  they believe: A man slave who believes is better than an unbeliever,  even though he allures you. Unbelievers do (but) beckon you to the  Fire. But Allah beckons by His Grace to the Garden (of bliss) and  forgiveness, and makes His Signs clear to mankind: That they may  celebrate His praise.    P: Wed not idolatresses till they believe; for lo! a believing bondwoman  is better than an idolatress though she please you; and give not your  daughters in marriage to idolaters till they believe, for lo! a  believing slave is better than an idolater though he please you. These  invite unto the Fire, and Allah inviteth unto the Garden, and unto  forgiveness by His grace, and expoundeth His revelations to mankind  that haply they may remember.    S: And do not marry the idolatresses until they believe, and certainly a  believing maid is better than an idolatress woman, even though she  should please you; and do not give (believing women) in marriage to  idolaters until they believe, and certainly a believing servant is  better than an idolater, even though he should please you; these invite  to the fire, and Allah invites to the garden and to forgiveness by His  will, and makes clear His communications to men, that they may be  mindful.    002.222  Y: They ask thee concerning women's courses. Say: They are a hurt and a  pollution: So keep away from women in their courses, and do not  approach them until they are clean. But when they have purified  themselves, ye may approach them in any manner, time, or place ordained  for you by Allah. For Allah loves those who turn to Him constantly and  He loves those who keep themselves pure and clean.    P: They question thee (O Muhammad) concerning menstruation. Say: It is  an illness, so let women alone at such times and go not in unto them  till they are cleansed. And when they have purified themselves, then go  in unto them as Allah hath enjoined upon you. Truly Allah loveth those  who turn unto Him, and loveth those who have a care for cleanness.    S: And they ask you about menstruation. Say: It is a discomfort;  therefore keep aloof from the women during the menstrual discharge and  do not go near them until they have become clean; then when they have  cleansed themselves, go in to them as Allah has commanded you; surely  Allah loves those who turn much (to Him), and He loves those who purify  themselves.    002.223  Y: Your wives are as a tilth unto you; so approach your tilth when or  how ye will; but do some good act for your souls beforehand; and fear  Allah. And know that ye are to meet Him (in the Hereafter), and give  (these) good tidings to those who believe.    P: Your women are a tilth for you (to cultivate) so go to your tilth as  ye will, and send (good deeds) before you for your souls, and fear  Allah, and know that ye will (one day) meet Him. Give glad tidings to  believers, (O Muhammad).    S: Your wives are a tilth for you, so go into your tilth when you like,  and do good beforehand for yourselves, and be careful (of your duty) to  Allah, and know that you will meet Him, and give good news to the  believers.    002.224  Y: And make not Allah's (name) an excuse in your oaths against doing  good, or acting rightly, or making peace between persons; for Allah is  One Who heareth and knoweth all things.    P: And make not Allah, by your oaths, a hindrance to your being  righteous and observing your duty unto Him and making peace among  mankind. Allah is Hearer, Knower.    S: And make not Allah because of your swearing (by Him) an obstacle to  your doing good and guarding (against evil) and making peace between  men, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.    002.225  Y: Allah will not call you to account for thoughtlessness in your oaths,  but for the intention in your hearts; and He is Oft-Forgiving, Most  Forbearing.    P: Allah will not take you to task for that which is unintentional in  your oaths. But He will take you "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16957"],[0,"Mr. Sponge's Sporting Tour (#15)"],[1,"pt, looking at his  tongue, and reporting on the weather, when the old posing question, 'What's  the news?' was put, Lotion replied, as he too often had to reply, for he  was a very slow hand at picking up information.    'Nothin' particklar, I think, sir,' adding, in an off-hand sort of way,  'you've heard of the greet run, I s'pose, sir?'    'Great run!' exclaimed the octogenarian, as if it was a matter of the most  vital importance to him; 'great run, sir; no, sir, not a word!'    The doctor then retailed it.    Old Jackey got possessed of this one idea--he thought of nothing else.  Whoever came, he out with it, chapter and verse, with occasional  variations. He told it to all the 'cousins in waiting'; Jackey Thompson,  of Carrington Ford; Jackey Thompson, of Houndesley; Jackey Thompson, of the  Mill; and all the Bobs, Bills, Sams, Harrys, and Peters, composing the  respective litters;--forgetting where he got it from, he nearly told it  back to Lotion himself. We sometimes see old people affected this way--far  more enthusiastic on a subject than young ones. Few dread the aspect of  affairs so much as those who have little chance of seeing how they go.    But to the run. The cousins reproduced the story according to their  respective powers of exaggeration. One tacked on two miles, another ten,  and so it went on and on, till it reached the ears of the great Mr.  Seedeyman, the mighty WE of the country, as he sat in his den penning his  'stunners' for his market-day _Mercury_. It had then distanced the great  sea-serpent itself in length, having extended over thirty-three miles of  country, which Mr. Seedeyman reported to have been run in one hour and  forty minutes.    Pretty good going, we should say.          CHAPTER X    THE FEELER      Bag fox-hunts, be they ever so good, are but unsatisfactory things; drag  runs are, beyond all measure, unsatisfactory. After the best-managed bag  fox-hunt, there is always a sort of suppressed joy, a deadly liveliness in  the field. Those in the secret are afraid of praising it too much, lest the  secret should ooze out, and strangers suppose that all their great runs are  with bag foxes, while the mere retaking of an animal that one has had in  hand before is not calculated to arouse any very pleasurable emotions.  Nobody ever goes frantic at seeing an old donkey of a deer handed back into  his carriage after a canter.    Our friends on this occasion soon exhausted what they had to say on the  subject.    'That's a nice horse of yours,' observed Mr. Waffles to Mr. Sponge, as the  latter, on the strength of the musty brush, now rode alongside the master  of the hounds.    'I think he is,' replied Sponge, rubbing some of the now dried sweat from  his shoulder and neck; 'I think he is; I like him a good deal better to-day  than I did the first time I rode him.'    'What, he's a new one, is he?' asked Mr. Waffles, taking a scented cigar  from his mouth, and giving a steady sidelong stare at the horse.    'Bought him in Leicestershire,' replied Sponge. 'He belonged to Lord  Bullfrog, who didn't think him exactly up to his weight.'    'Up to his weight!' exclaimed Mr. Caingey Thornton, who had now ridden up  on the other side of his great patron, 'why, he must be another Daniel  Lambert.'    'Rather so,' replied Mr. Sponge; 'rides nineteen stun.'    'What a monster!' exclaimed Thornton, who was of the pocket order.    'I thought he didn't go fast enough at his fences the first time I rode  him,' observed Mr. Sponge, drawing the curb slightly so as to show the  horse's fine arched neck to advantage; 'but he went quick enough to-day, in  all conscience,' added he.    'He did _that_,' observed Mr. Thornton, now bent on a toadying match. 'I  never saw a finer lepper.'    'He flew many feet beyond the brook,' observed Mr. Spareneck, who, thinking  discretion was the better part of valour, had pulled up on seeing his  comrade Thornton blobbing about in the middle of it, and therefore was  qualified to speak to the fact.    So they went on talking about the horse, and his points, and his speed, and  his action, very likely as much for want of something to say, or to keep  off the subject of the run, as from any real admiration of the animal.    The true way to make a man take a fancy to a horse is to make believe that  you don't want to sell him--at all events, that you are easy about selling.  Mr. Sponge had played this game so very often, that it came quite natural  to him. He knew exactly how far to go, and having expressed his previous  objection to the horse, he now most handsomely made the _amende honorable_  by patting him on the neck, and declaring that he really thought he should  keep him.    It is said that every man has his weak or 'do-able' point, if the sharp  ones can but discover it. This observation does not refer, we believe, to  men with an innocent _penchant_ for play, or the turf, or for buying  pictures, or for collecting china, or for driving coaches and four, all of  which tastes proclaim themselves sooner or later, but means that the most  knowing, the most cautious, and the most careful, are all to be come over,  somehow or another.    There are few things more surprising in this remarkable world than the  magnificent way people talk about money, or the meannesses they will resort  to in order to get a little. We hear fellows flashing and talking in  hundreds and thousands, who will do almost anything for a five-pound note.  We have known men pretending to hunt countries at their own expense, and  yet actually 'living out of the hounds.' Next to the accomplishment of  that--apparently almost impossible feat--comes the dexterity required for  living by horse-dealing.    A little lower down in the scale comes the income derived from the  profession of a 'go-between'--the gentleman who can buy the horse cheaper  than you can. This was Caingey Thornton's trade. He was always lurking  about people's stables talking to grooms and worming out secrets--whose  horse had a cough, whose was a wind-sucker, whose was lame after hunting,  and so on--and had a price current of every horse in the place--knew what  had been given, what the owners asked, and had a pretty good guess what  they would take.    Waffles would have been an invaluable customer to Thornton if the former's  groom, Mr. Figg, had not been rather too hard with his 'reg'lars.' He  insisted on Caingey dividing whatever he got out of his master with him.  This reduced profits considerably; but still, as it was a profession that  did not require any capital to set up with, Thornton could afford to be  liberal, having only to tack on to one end to cut off at the other.    After the opening Sponge gave as they rode home with the hounds, Thornton  had no difficulty in sounding him on the subject.    'You'll not think me impertinent, I hope,' observed Caingey, in his most  deferential style, to our hero when they met at the News'-room the next  day--'you'll not think me impertinent, I hope; but I think you said as we  rode home, yesterday, that you didn't altogether like the brown horse you  were on?'    '_Did I?_' replied Mr. Sponge, with apparent surprise; 'I think you must  have misunderstood me.'    'Why, no; it wasn't exactly that,' rejoined Mr. Thornton, 'but you said you  liked him better than you did, I think?'    'Ah! I believe I did say something of the sort,' replied Sponge  casually--'I believe I did say something of the sort; but he carried me so  well that I thought better of him. The fact was,' continued Mr. Sponge,  confidentially, 'I thought him rather too light mouthed; I like a horse  that bears more on the hand.'    'Indeed!' observed Mr. Thornton; 'most people think a light mouth a  recommendation.'    'I know they do,' replied Mr. Sponge, 'I know they do; but I like a horse  that requires a little riding. Now this is too much of a made horse--too  much of what I call an old man's horse, for me. Bullfrog, whom I bought him  of, is very fat--eats a great deal of venison and turtle--all sorts of good  things, in fact--and can't stand much tewing in the saddle; now, I rather  like to feel that I am on a horse, and not in an arm-chair.'    'He's a fine horse,' observed Mr. Thornton.    'So he ought,' replied Mr. Sponge; 'I gave a hatful of money for him--two  hundred and fifty golden sovereigns, and not a guinea back. Bullfrog's the  biggest screw I ever dealt with.'    That latter observation was highly encouraging to Thornton. It showed that  Mr. Sponge was not one of your tight-laced dons, who take offence at the  mere mention of 'drawbacks,' but, on the contrary, favoured the supposition  that he would do the 'genteel,' should he happen to be a seller.    'Well, if you should feel disposed to part with him, perhaps you will have  the kindness to let me know,' observed Mr. Thornton; adding, 'he's not for  myself, of course, but I think I know a man he would suit, and who would be  inclined to give a good price for him.'    'I will,' replied Mr. Sponge; 'I will,' repeated he, adding, 'if I _were_  to sell him, I wouldn't take a farthing under three 'underd for him--three  'underd _guineas_, mind, _not punds_.'    'That's a vast sum of money,' observed Mr. Thornton.    'Not a bit on't,' replied Mr. Sponge. 'He's worth it all, and a great deal  more. Indeed, I haven't said, mind that, I'll take that for him; all I've  said is, that I wouldn't take less.'    'Just so,' replied Mr. Thornton.    'He's a horse of high character,' observed Mr. Sponge. 'Indeed he has no  business out of Leicestershire; and I don't know what set my fool of a  groom to bring him here.'    'Well, I'll see if I can coax my friend into giving what you say,' observed  Mr. Thornton.    'Nay, never mind coaxing,' replied Mr. Sponge, with the utmost  indifference; 'never mind coaxing; if he's not anxious, my name's \"easy.\"  Only mind ye, if I ride him again, and he carries me as he did yesterday, I  shall clap on another "]]]
