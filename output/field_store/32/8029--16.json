[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16653"],[0,"Myths of Babylonia and Assyria (#15)"],[1,"that the sun  sees secret sin.\"[69]    In Persian mythology Mitra, as Mithra, is the patron of Truth, and  \"the Mediator\" between heaven and earth[70]. This god was also  worshipped by the military aristocracy of Mitanni, which held sway for  a period over Assyria. In Roman times the worship of Mithra spread  into Europe from Persia. Mithraic sculptures depict the deity as a  corn god slaying the harvest bull; on one of the monuments \"cornstalks  instead of blood are seen issuing from the wound inflicted with the  knife[71]\". The Assyrian word \"metru\" signifies rain.[70] As a sky god  Mitra may have been associated, like Varuna, with the  waters above the firmament. Rain would therefore be  gifted by him as a fertilizing deity. In the Babylonian  Flood legend it is the sun god Shamash who \"appointed  the time\" when the heavens were to \"rain destruction\"  in the night, and commanded Pir-napishtim, \"Enter into  the midst of thy ship and shut thy door\". The solar  deity thus appears as a form of Anu, god of the sky and  upper atmosphere, who controls the seasons and the various  forces of nature. Other rival chiefs of city pantheons,  whether lunar, atmospheric, earth, or water deities, were  similarly regarded as the supreme deities who ruled the  Universe, and decreed when man should receive benefits  or suffer from their acts of vengeance.    It is possible that the close resemblances between Mithra and Mitra of  the Aryan-speaking peoples of India and the Iranian plateau, and the  sun god of the Babylonians--the Semitic Shamash, the Sumerian  Utu--were due to early contact and cultural influence through the  medium of Elam. As a solar and corn god, the Persian Mithra links with  Tammuz, as a sky and atmospheric deity with Anu, and as a god of  truth, righteousness, and law with Shamash. We seem to trace in the  sublime Vedic hymns addressed by the Indian Aryans to Mitra and Varuna  the impress of Babylonian religious thought:        Whate'er exists within this earth, and all within the sky,      Yea, all that is beyond, King Varuna perceives....                _Rigveda_, iv, 16.[72]          O Varuna, whatever the offence may be      That we as men commit against the heavenly folk,      When through our want of thought we violate thy laws,      Chastise us not, O god, for that iniquity.                _Rigveda_, vii, 89.[73]    Shamash was similarly exalted in Babylonian hymns:        The progeny of those who deal unjustly will not prosper.      What their mouth utters in thy presence      Thou wilt destroy, what issues from their mouth thou wilt          dissipate.      Thou knowest their transgressions, the plan of the wicked thou          rejectest.      All, whoever they be, are in thy care....      He who takes no bribe, who cares for the oppressed,      Is favoured by Shamash,--his life shall be prolonged.[74]    The worshippers of Varuna and Mitra in the Punjab did not cremate  their dead like those who exalted the rival fire god Agni. The grave  was the \"house of clay\", as in Babylonia. Mitra, who was identical  with Yama, ruled over departed souls in the \"Land of the Pitris\"  (Fathers), which was reached by crossing the mountains and the rushing  stream of death.[75] As we have seen, the Babylonian solar god Nergal  was also the lord of the dead.    As Ma-banda-anna, \"the boat of the sky\", Shamash links with the  Egyptian sun god Ra, whose barque sailed over the heavens by day and  through the underworld of darkness and death during the night. The  consort of Shamash was Aa, and his attendants were Kittu and Mesharu,  \"Truth\" and \"Righteousness\".    Like the Hittites, the Babylonians had also a sun goddess: her name  was Nin-sun, which Jastrow renders \"the annihilating lady\". At Erech  she had a shrine in the temple of the sky god Anu.    We can trace in Babylonia, as in Egypt, the early belief that life in  the Universe had a female origin. Nin-sun links with Ishtar, whose  Sumerian name is Nana. Ishtar appears to be identical with the  Egyptian Hathor, who, as Sekhet, slaughtered the enemies of the sun  god Ra. She was similarly the goddess of maternity, and is depicted in  this character, like Isis and other goddesses of similar character,  suckling a babe. Another Babylonian lady of the gods was Ama, Mama, or  Mami, \"the creatress of the seed of mankind\", and was \"probably so  called as the 'mother' of all things\".[76]    A characteristic atmospheric deity was Ramman, the Rimmon of the  Bible, the Semitic Addu, Adad, Hadad, or Dadu. He was not a presiding  deity in any pantheon, but was identified with Enlil at Nippur. As a  hammer god, he was imported by the Semites from the hills. He was a  wind and thunder deity, a rain bringer, a corn god, and a god of  battle like Thor, Jupiter, Tarku, Indra, and others, who were all sons  of the sky.    In this brief review of the representative deities of early Babylonia,  it will be seen that most gods link with Anu, Ea, and Enlil, whose  attributes they symbolized in various forms. The prominence accorded  to an individual deity depended on local conditions, experiences, and  influences. Ceremonial practices no doubt varied here and there, but  although one section might exalt Ea and another Shamash, the religious  faith of the people as a whole did not differ to any marked extent;  they served the gods according to their lights, so that life might be  prolonged and made prosperous, for the land of death and \"no return\"  was regarded as a place of gloom and misery.    When the Babylonians appear before us in the early stages of the  historical period they had reached that stage of development set forth  so vividly in the _Orations_ of Isocrates: \"Those of the gods who are  the source to us of good things have the title of Olympians; those  whose department is that of calamities and punishments have harsher  titles: to the first class both private persons and states erect  altars and temples; the second is not worshipped either with prayers  or burnt sacrifices, but in their case we perform ceremonies of  riddance\".[77]    The Sumerians, like the Ancient Egyptians, developed their deities,  who reflected the growth of culture, from vague spirit groups, which,  like ghosts, were hostile to mankind. Those spirits who could be  propitiated were exalted as benevolent deities; those who could not be  bargained with were regarded as evil gods and goddesses. A better  understanding of the character of Babylonian deities will therefore be  obtained by passing the demons and evil spirits under review.          CHAPTER IV.

The memorable sermon preached by Paul to the Athenians when he stood  \"in the midst of Mars' hill\", could have been addressed with equal  appropriateness to the ancient Sumerians and Akkadians. \"I perceive\",  he declared, \"that in all things ye are too superstitious.... God that  made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of  heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; neither is  worshipped with men's hands as though he needed any thing, seeing he  giveth to all life, and breath, and all things ... for in him we live,  and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have  said, For we are also his offspring. Forasmuch then as we are the  offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto  gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.\"[78]    Babylonian temples were houses of the gods in the literal sense; the  gods were supposed to dwell in them, their spirits having entered into  the graven images or blocks of stone. It is probable that like the  Ancient Egyptians they believed a god had as many spirits as he had  attributes. The gods, as we have said, appear to have evolved from  early spirit groups. All the world swarmed with spirits, which  inhabited stones and trees, mountains and deserts, rivers and ocean,  the air, the sky, the stars, and the sun and moon. The spirits  controlled Nature: they brought light and darkness, sunshine and  storm, summer and winter; they were manifested in the thunderstorm,  the sandstorm, the glare of sunset, and the wraiths of mist rising  from the steaming marshes. They controlled also the lives of men and  women. The good spirits were the source of luck. The bad spirits  caused misfortunes, and were ever seeking to work evil against the  Babylonian. Darkness was peopled by demons and ghosts of the dead. The  spirits of disease were ever lying in wait to clutch him with cruel  invisible hands.    Some modern writers, who are too prone to regard ancient peoples from  a twentieth-century point of view, express grave doubts as to whether  \"intelligent Babylonians\" really believed that spirits came down in  the rain and entered the soil to rise up before men's eyes as stalks"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16658"],[0,"Piano and Song (#15)"],[1,"i, after having previously  allowed his over-strained voice a time for rest.    If a singing-teacher has, by chance, met with a docile pupil, possessed  of a voice of unusual beauty, it frequently happens that the studies are  not pursued with sufficient perseverance; and, perhaps, are continued  only for a few weeks or months, instead of allowing a year or more,  according to circumstances. Richard Wagner agrees with me, when he says,  \"Why, then, write operas to be sung, when we no longer have either male  or female singers?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Since modern progress has come to regard \"the three trifles\" as  belonging entirely to the past, and in their place has proclaimed,  \"Boldness, Spirit, Power,\" two evil spirits have had rule: they go hand  in hand, ruin the voice, wound the cultivated ear, and provide for  us--only empty opera houses. One of these evils has been frequently  alluded to by me. It is \"the expenditure of a great deal too much  breath.\" The finest voices are obliged to practise with full breath  until they shriek, and the result is mere sobbing, and the heavy drawing  of the breath, just at the time when the tone should still be heard.  Even if every thing else could be right, in such a culture of the tone,  which must very shortly relax the muscles of the voice, that one thing,  in itself, would be sufficient to destroy all promise of success.    The second evil endangers even the male voice, which is able to endure  much ill-treatment; while the female voice is quickly forced by it into  a piercing shrillness, or is driven back into the throat, soon to be  entirely exhausted, or is, at least, prevented from attaining a natural,  fine development. This second evil is the reckless and destructive  straining of single tones to their extreme limits, even to perfect  exhaustion. The poor singer urges and squeezes out the voice, and  quivers to the innermost marrow, in order that the two requirements of  \"Boldness\" and \"Power\" may be satisfied. But the \"Spirit\" is still  wanting, which should be shown in a light and well-shaded delivery. The  effect of extreme shading, however, is accomplished in a single  \"romanza.\" The unfortunate, misdirected singer, who must aim at effect,  lays out so much force on single tones, or even on whole lines, and  that, too, in the best register of his voice (the other registers do not  permit this), that the succeeding tones are forced to retire powerless  into the throat; and the beautiful, fresh, youthful tenor or bass voice  concludes with exhausted groaning and mere speaking tones. The \"romanza\"  is now at an end, and certainly \"Boldness, Spirit, and Power\" have  worked in union. The task is executed the better, because a rude  accompaniment has probably sustained the singer in a most striking  manner, and has completed the total effect.    By such management, to which I must emphatically add the continual  holding of the tones, even in the _forte_, voices are expected \"to come  out,\" to be developed, inspired, and made beautiful. What healthy ear  can endure such enormities in tone formation, such tortures in singing?  These, then, are the modern contributions for the embellishment of art!  A curse on these evil spirits! If my feeble pen shall assist in bringing  such singing-teachers to their senses, and shall help to save only a  few of our fine voices, I shall consider my mission fulfilled, and the  aim of this book, so far as it concerns singing, accomplished.           *       *       *       *       *    I have heretofore combated many prejudices, both in earnest and in  sport, successfully and unsuccessfully; but one I find very  obstinate,--it has pursued me incessantly for years. A piano-player,  with a rigid, strained, and vicious touch, proceeding from the arm, may  play a great deal, but his playing is thoroughly vulgar and without  beauty. He feels this himself, and the playing of my pupils pleases him  better. He wishes me to change his style to their better manner; but he  still continues to pound, to bang, to exaggerate, and to play in his own  way, and only wishes his style to be improved, and his power of  execution to be increased. If a performer of this sort is not much more  than twenty years of age, something may yet be done for the improvement  of his touch, and consequently of his style of playing; but this is only  possible by laying aside all his accustomed pieces of music, and by  diligently practising, daily, small easy exercises, which must be played  delicately, with loose fingers, and without allowing the arm to give the  slightest assistance; otherwise, all labor will be thrown away upon  him. How else can you begin, except by laying a proper foundation for a  better style? I have frequently urged this principle both by speech and  in writing; but the difficulty always returns, and especially in the  cultivation of female singers.    A girl of eighteen comes to me: she has heard of the excellent  cultivation of my lady singers, and wishes to obtain the same for  herself. In order that I may hear her voice, she selects the \"Erlkoenig,\"  by Schubert, that perilous piece, which is apt to lead even highly  cultivated singers into frightful atrocities. Heavens! what must I hear?  With the remains of a fine, youthful voice, whose registers are already  broken up and disconnected, she shrieks out the \"Erlkoenig,\" between sobs  and groans, with screwed-up chest-tones, and many modern improprieties,  but nevertheless with dramatic talent. The piercing voice, forced to its  utmost, fills me with horror; but also with pity for such a glorious  endowment, and such an unnatural development. At the conclusion, her  voice succumbed to the effort, and she could only groan hoarsely, and  wheeze without emitting a sound. She has, however, frequently produced  great effect in society, and drawn tears with this performance: it is  her favorite piece. Let us abandon this singing for parties, this  melancholy _dilettantismus_, everywhere so obtrusive! The girl is only  eighteen years old: is she beyond salvation? I endeavor to build her  voice up again, gradually, by gentle practice. She succeeds very well in  it, and after six lessons her natural docility arouses hope. The  head-tones again make their appearance, and the practice of _solfeggio_  brings out once more the stifled voice which had been forced back into  the throat by senseless exertions; a better attack begins to be  developed, and the chest-register returns to its natural limits. She now  declared, with her mother's approval, that she really would continue to  study in this way, but she could not give up the performance of her  effective and spirited conception of the \"Erlkoenig.\" She came a few  times more: I could perceive that the good structure was tottering.  After a few months, she had entirely sacrificed her voice to this single  \"Erlkoenig.\" In such tender years, one such idol is sufficient. What a  price for an \"Erlkoenig\"! The old, experienced singing-teacher, Miksch,  of Dresden (with the exception of Rossini, the last famous champion of  the old school), has often warned me that radical amendment is seldom  possible with such over-strained and broken voices, which already are  obliged to struggle with enfeebled muscles, even although youth may  excite great and decided hopes. There is also another difficulty: that  one of these strong, over-strained voices must hereafter be used with  much less strength, if we wish to cultivate a correct tone; and it is  impossible to tell whether the chest-tones, when they are restored to  their true limit, will ever come out again as powerful and at the same  time as beautiful. Let no musician, however talented and cultivated he  may be, ever adopt the teaching of singing, unless he can combine with  firmness of character great patience, perseverance, and  disinterestedness; otherwise, he will experience very little pleasure  and very little gratitude. Even if the \"Erlkoenig\" does not stand in the  way, every voice presents new and peculiar difficulties.      _A Few Words addressed to Singing-Teachers on the Accompaniment of  Etudes, Exercises, Scales, &c._    It is common for teachers to play their accompaniments as furiously as  if they had to enter into a struggle for life and death with their  singers. At the beginning of the lesson, the lady singer ought to  commence quite _piano_, at _f_ in the one-lined octave, and to sing up  and down from there through five or six notes, without any expenditure  of breath, and should guide and bring out her voice by a gentle practice  of _solfeggio_; and yet you bang, and pound on the keys, as if you had  to accompany drums and trumpets. Do you not perceive that in this way  you induce your pupils to strain and force their voices, and that you  mislead them into a false method? In such a noise, and while you are  making such a monstrous expenditure of strength, to which you add a  sharp, uneasy touch, and a frequent spreading of the chords, how can you  watch the delicate movements of the singer's throat? Is it necessary for  me to explain how such a rude accompaniment must interfere with the  effort to sing firmly and delicately? Are you not aware that a light and  agreeable, but at the same time firm and decided, accompaniment  encourages and sustains the singer, and also assists and inspires her?  You ought, in every way, to seek to cultivate in your pupil the feeling  for the right, the true, and the beautiful; but what is the girl of  eighteen to think of _your_ culture and _your_ sentiment, if you pound  the keys as if you were one of the \"piano-furies\"?    While this is your mode of accompanying the etudes, how then do you  accompany the aria, the song? If, for instance, the pupil is singing  tenderly, and wishes to bring out an artistic, delicate shading, you  take advantage of that occasion to make yourself heard, and to annoy the  singer and the"]]]
