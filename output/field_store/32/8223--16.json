I repeatedly told the Bulgarians that they ought  not to enter it because in that case we would enter it too. But I was  not successful in my efforts.    During the second Balkan war I did all in my power to end it as  quickly as possible. At the conference of Bucharest I made efforts, as  Mr. Pashich and Mr. Venizelos know very well, to secure for beaten  Bulgaria the best terms. My object was to obtain a new coalition of  all the Balkan States, including Rumania. Had I succeeded in this the  situation would be much better. No reasonable man will deny that the  Balkan States are neutralizing each other at the present time, which  in itself makes the whole situation all the more miserable.    In October, 1913, when I succeeded in facilitating the conclusion of  peace between Greece and Turkey, I was pursuing the same object of the  Balkan coalition. On my return from Athens I endeavored, though  without success, to put the Greco-Turkish relations on a basis of  friendship, being convinced that the well understood interest of both  countries lies not only in friendly relations, but even in an alliance  between them.    The dissensions that exist between the Balkan States can be settled in  a friendly way without war. The best moment for this would be after  the general war, when the map of Europe will be remade. The Balkan  country which would start war against another Balkan country would  commit, not only a crime against her own future, but an act of folly  as well.    The destiny and the future of the Balkan States, and of all the small  European peoples as well, will not be regulated by fratricidal wars,  but, with this great European struggle, the real object of which is to  settle the question whether Europe shall enter an era of justice, and  therefore happiness for the small peoples, or whether we will face a  period of oppression more or less gilt edged. And as I always believed  that wisdom and truth will triumph in the end, I want to believe, too,  that, in spite of the pessimistic news reaching me from the different  sides of the Balkan countries, there will be no war among them in  order to justify those who do not believe in the vitality of the small  peoples.      RUMANIANS IN HUNGARY.    _N. Filipescu, ex-Minister of War, said:_    The position of the Rumanians in Hungary is not so bad after all.  Since the beginning of the general war the Rumanians of Hungary gave  proofs of their faith and devotion to Hungary.    We hoped to see this country appreciating the fact. Our belief is  strengthened every day. I am convinced that if from this war Hungary  should emerge victorious she would show less good-will toward the  Rumanians of Transylvania. It is the first time that I have expressed  in this way my opinion as a seeming threat. I hoped that the  Hungarians would in the end take to the right path. But I see that we  have nothing to hope from that side, and I only regret our former  amicable relations with Germany.    Two Balkan States--Servia and Greece--are nearer to us on account of  the recent past. But in saying this I do not mean that our relations  in the future will be less friendly. With the other States, and  especially Bulgaria, our relations might become better. This is our  sincerest desire. As for Turkey, we never ceased to be on good terms  with her, and I hope the same will hold good in the future.          Exit Albania?    Departure of Prince William of Wied--After the Revolution of July,  1914.    [From Il Corriere della Sera of Milan, Italy, of Sept. 3, 1914.]      DURAZZO, Sept. 3.    An hour ago the Italian yacht Misurata, flying the Albanian ensign on  the foremast and the Italian colors aft, weighed anchor and proceeded  to Venice. Aboard the Misurata were Prince William of Wied, Princess  Sophie, Tourkhan Pasha, (the Albanian Premier,) Akis Pasha, and other  members of the Court.    Princess Sophie, coming aboard the launch which took them to the  Misurata, was weeping. Prince William looked calm. The Italian marines  and the Rumanian volunteers cheered, and the cruiser Libia saluted the  Prince with the regular number of salvos. The square near the seashore  was by that time full of refugees.    Prince William bade Durazzo good-bye, but every one is convinced that  he will never come back.    Last Monday (Aug. 31) the Ministers of the powers met in the Italian  Legation to consider the taking of certain measures, in case of  trouble, which was already brewing on account of the non-payment of  the apportionments to the men of the garrison.    On the morning of the next day the Minister of Rumania brought to the  palace a letter from the insurgents addressed to the representatives  of the powers and announcing that the patience of the insurgents was  exhausted, and that they were resolved to enter Durazzo by any means.  An identical letter was addressed to the inhabitants of the city.    It was then that the Prince decided to abandon Durazzo.    The Ministers, having received the message of the insurgents and  having been notified of the intention of the Prince to leave the  place, met again in the palace in order to find a way of settlement of  the vexing financial problem. At the same time the International  Commission of Control decided to call on the insurgent camp at Shiak,  (outside of Durazzo,) give them the news of the imminent departure of  the Prince, and invite them to the city.    The insurgents replied assuring the commission of their good  intentions toward the city and the foreigners. They added that they  had not taken any decision regarding the new form of government,  because some of their chiefs were at that time in Avlona, and they  promised to make their decision known after the departure of the  Prince from Durazzo. On the other hand, they left it to be understood  that there was already established in Albania a mutual national  confidence between all the Musselman Albanians.    On its return to Durazzo the International Commission of Control found  itself face to face with another surprise. The gendarmerie had  mutinied. The men belonging to this corps were opposing the departure  of the Prince before he had paid their wages, and threatened to make  use of their weapons.    The commission sent the French delegate to the gendarmerie barracks,  and it was with great trouble that the men were dissuaded from their  original designs. Yesterday the Prince distributed decorations freely.  Today at 7 A.M. he left the palace, and, saluted by the Diplomatic  Corps, he repaired to the waterfront.    After the Prince and Princess embarked, the adjoining square was  filled with great crowds of people. Malissor and Kotsovessi tribesmen  and all those who were yet in Durazzo as protectors of the Prince went  to the waterfront in order to embark on an Italian mail steamer bound  for San Giovanni di Medua.    These people looked desperate and gave the impression of being in the  last degree of poverty. Each one had from two to three pistols, and no  one was unarmed. There might have been nearly 2,000 men there, all  eager to leave, but this proved impossible, as their chiefs, Issa  Boletinotz and Bairam Zouri, had not provided them with the necessary  tickets.    At last, with the help of the Almighty, order was re-established, and,  after two hours of trouble impossible to describe, these 2,000  refugees embarked on the steamer Citta di Bori.    The Italian marines re-embarked on the cruiser Libia, and the  International Commission took charge of the Government.      LAST PROCLAMATION OF PRINCE OF WIED.    _Before leaving Durazzo, the Prince of Wied addressed the following  proclamation to the Albanian people:_    Albanians, when your delegates came to offer me the crown of Albania,  I answered with confidence to the appeal of this noble and chivalrous  people who were asking me to aid them in the work of their national  regeneration. I came to you animated by the most ardent desire to help  you in this patriotic task.    You have seen me, from the beginning, devoting all my efforts for the  reorganization of the country, and desirous of giving you a good  administration and justice for all. But ill-omened events occurred to  destroy our common labors. In fact, certain souls, blinded by passion,  have misunderstood the scope of our reforms and have not given credit  to a Government just born. On the other hand, the war which broke out  in Europe has all the more complicated our position.    I therefore thought that, in order not to leave unfinished the work to  which I wish to consecrate my forces and my life, I must just for a  little while go to the Occident.    But know that, from afar as from near, I will have but one thought--to  work for the prosperity of our noble and chivalrous Albanian  fatherland. During my absence the International Commission of Control,  deriving its powers from Europe, which created our country, will  assume the Government.      ESSAD PASHA PRESIDENT.    [From Le Temps, Paris.]    DURAZZO, Oct. 4.    Essad Pasha was today named President of the temporary Government. The  time limit for taking possession of the Government expired at 2 P.M. A  short time before this hour Essad Pasha occupied the strategic points  of the city with his forces of 10,000 Ottomans.    The members of the Albanian Senate elected him President, and  expressed to him their congratulations for the confidence the nation  has in him.      ALBANIA UNDER MANY RULERS.    [From The Times of London, Oct. 30.]    BUCHAREST, Oct. 27.    There are now six Italian warships at Avlona, where a sanitary station  will be established for the relief of Albanian refugees driven from  Epirus by the Greek \"sacred bands.\" The duty of maintaining the  decisions of the conference in London will apparently be intrusted to  Italy as the only neutral power among the signatories to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20532"],[0,"Love Among the Chickens (#15)"],[1,"had indeed proved costly. We had painted the  throats of the chickens with the best turpentine--at least, Ukridge  and Beale had--but in spite of their efforts dozens had died, and we  had been obliged to sink much more money than was pleasant in  restocking the run.    \"No,\" said Ukridge, summing up, \"these men must wait. We can't help  their troubles. Why, good gracious, it isn't as if they'd been waiting  for the money long. We've not been down here much over a month. I  never heard such a scandalous thing. 'Pon my word, I've a good mind to  go round and have a straight talk with one or two of them. I come and  settle down here, and stimulate trade, and give them large orders, and  they worry me with bills when they know I'm up to my eyes in work,  looking after the fowls. One can't attend to everything. This business  is just now at its most crucial point. It would be fatal to pay any  attention to anything else with things as they are. These scoundrels  will get paid all in good time.\"    It is a peculiarity of situations of this kind that the ideas of  debtor and creditor as to what constitutes good time never coincide.    I am afraid that, despite the urgent need for strict attention to  business, I was inclined to neglect my duties about this time. I had  got into the habit of wandering off, either to the links, where I  generally found the professor and sometimes Phyllis, or on long walks  by myself. There was one particular walk, along the Ware cliff,  through some of the most beautiful scenery I have ever set eyes on,  which more than any other suited my mood. I would work my way through  the woods till I came to a small clearing on the very edge of the  cliff. There I would sit by the hour. Somehow I found that my ideas  flowed more readily in that spot than in any other. My novel was  taking shape. It was to be called, by the way, if it ever won through  to the goal of a title, \"The Brown-haired Girl.\"    I had not been inside the professor's grounds since the occasion when  I had gone in through the boxwood hedge. But on the afternoon  following my financial conversation with Ukridge I made my way thither  after a toilet which, from its length, should have produced better  results than it did.    Not for four whole days had I caught so much as a glimpse of Phyllis.  I had been to the links three times, and had met the professor twice,  but on both occasions she had been absent. I had not had the courage  to ask after her. I had an absurd idea that my voice or my manner  would betray me in some way.    The professor was not at home. Nor was Mr. Chase. Nor was Miss Norah  Derrick, the lady I had met on the beach with the professor. Miss  Phyllis, said the maid, was in the garden.    I went into the garden. She was sitting under the cedar by the tennis  lawn, reading. She looked up as I approached.    To walk any distance under observation is one of the most trying  things I know. I advanced in bad order, hoping that my hands did not  really look as big as they felt. The same remark applied to my feet.  In emergencies of this kind a diffident man could very well dispense  with extremities. I should have liked to be wheeled up in a bath  chair.    I said it was a lovely afternoon; after which there was a lull in the  conversation. I was filled with a horrid fear that I was boring her. I  had probably arrived at the very moment when she was most interested  in her book. She must, I thought, even now be regarding me as a  nuisance, and was probably rehearsing bitter things to say to the  servant for not having had the sense to explain that she was out.    \"I--er--called in the hope of seeing Professor Derrick,\" I said.    \"You would find him on the links,\" she replied. It seemed to me that  she spoke wistfully.    \"Oh, it--it doesn't matter,\" I said. \"It wasn't anything important.\"    This was true. If the professor had appeared then and there, I should  have found it difficult to think of anything to say to him which would  have accounted for my anxiety to see him.    We paused again.    \"How are the chickens, Mr. Garnet?\" said she.    The situation was saved. Conversationally, I am like a clockwork toy.  I have to be set going. On the affairs of the farm I could speak  fluently. I sketched for her the progress we had made since her visit.  I was humorous concerning roop, epigrammatic on the subject of the  hired retainer and Edwin.    \"Then the cat did come down from the chimney?\" said Phyllis.    We both laughed, and--I can answer for myself--felt the better for it.    \"He came down next day,\" I said, \"and made an excellent lunch off one  of our best fowls. He also killed another, and only just escaped death  himself at the hands of Ukridge.\"    \"Mr. Ukridge doesn't like him, does he?\"    \"If he does, he dissembles his love. Edwin is Mrs. Ukridge's pet. He  is the only subject on which they disagree. Edwin is certainly in the  way on a chicken farm. He has got over his fear of Bob, and is now  perfectly lawless. We have to keep a constant eye on him.\"    \"And have you had any success with the incubator? I love incubators. I  have always wanted to have one of my own, but we have never kept  fowls.\"    \"The incubator has not done all that it should have done,\" I said.  \"Ukridge looks after it, and I fancy his methods are not the right  methods. I don't know if I have got the figures absolutely correct,  but Ukridge reasons on these lines. He says you are supposed to keep  the temperature up to a hundred and five degrees. I think he said a  hundred and five. Then the eggs are supposed to hatch out in a week or  so. He argues that you may just as well keep the temperature at  seventy-two, and wait a fortnight for your chickens. I am certain  there's a fallacy in the system somewhere, because we never seem to  get as far as the chickens. But Ukridge says his theory is  mathematically sound and he sticks to it.\"    \"Are you quite sure that the way you are doing it is the best way to  manage a chicken farm?\"    \"I should very much doubt it. I am a child in these matters. I had  only seen a chicken in its wild state once or twice before we came  down here. I had never dreamed of being an active assistant on a real  farm. The whole thing began like Mr. George Ade's fable of the author.  An author--myself--was sitting at his desk trying to turn out  something that could be converted into breakfast food, when a friend  came in and sat down on the table and told him to go right on and not  mind him.\"    \"Did Mr. Ukridge do that?\"    \"Very nearly that. He called at my rooms one beautiful morning when I  was feeling desperately tired of London and overworked and dying for a  holiday, and suggested that I should come to Lyme Regis with him and  help him farm chickens. I have not regretted it.\"    \"It is a lovely place, isn't it?\"    \"The loveliest I have ever seen. How charming your garden is.\"    \"Shall we go and look at it? You have not seen the whole of it.\"    As she rose I saw her book, which she had laid face downward on the  grass beside her. It was that same much-enduring copy of \"The  Maneuvers of Arthur.\" I was thrilled. This patient perseverance must  surely mean something.    She saw me looking at it.    \"Did you draw Pamela from anybody?\" she asked suddenly.    I was glad now that I had not done so. The wretched Pamela, once my  pride, was for some reason unpopular with the only critic about whose  opinion I cared, and had fallen accordingly from her pedestal.    As we wandered down the gravel paths she gave me her opinion of the  book. In the main it was appreciative. I shall always associate the  scent of yellow lubin with the higher criticism.    \"Of course I don't know anything about writing books,\" she said.    \"Yes?\" My tone implied, or I hoped it did, that she was an expert on  books, and that if she was not it didn't matter.    \"But I don't think you do your heroines well. I have got 'The  Outsider'--\"    (My other novel. Bastable & Kirby, six shillings. Satirical. All about  society, of which I know less than I know about chicken farming.  Slated by _Times_ and _Spectator_. Well received by the _Pelican_.)    \"--and,\" continued Phyllis, \"Lady Maud is exactly the same as Pamela  in 'The Maneuvers of Arthur.' I thought you must have drawn both  characters from some one you knew.\"    \"No,\" I said; \"no.\"    \"I am so glad,\" said Phyllis.    And then neither of us seemed to have anything to say.    My knees began to tremble. I realized that the moment had arrived when  my fate must be put to the touch, and I feared that the moment was  premature. We cannot arrange these things to suit ourselves. I knew  that the time was not yet ripe, but the magic scent of the yellow  lubin was too much for me.    \"Miss Derrick--\" I said hoarsely.    Phyllis was looking with more intentness than the attractions of the  flower justified at a rose she held in her hand. The bees hummed in  the lubin.    \"Miss Derrick--\" I said, and stopped again.    \"I say, you people,\" said a cheerful voice, \"tea is ready. Halloo,  Garnet, how are you? That medal arrived yet from the humane society?\"    I spun round. Mr. Tom Chase was standing at the end of the path. I  grinned a sickly grin.    \"Well, Tom,\" said Phyllis.    And there was, I thought, just the faintest trace of annoyance in her  voice.    \"I've been bathing,\" said Mr. Chase.    \"Oh,\" I replied. \"And I wish,\" I added, \"that you'd drowned yourself.\"    But I added it silently to myself.          TEA AND TENNIS    XIII      \"Met the professor's late boatman on the Cob,\" said Mr. Chase,  dissecting a chocolate cake.    \"Clumsy man,\" said Phyllis, \"I hope he was ashamed of himself. I shall  never forgive him for trying to drown papa.\"    My heart bled for Mr. Henry Hawk, that modern martyr.    \"When I met him,\" said Tom Chase, \"he looked as if he had been trying  to drown his sorrow as well.\"    \"I knew he drank,\" said Phyllis severely, \"the very first time I"]]]
