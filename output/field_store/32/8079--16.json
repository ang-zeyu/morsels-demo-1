The artist, in  the language of Neo-Platonism, is a demiurge; he only of men can convert  dead things into life. And now we will go into the Uffizi.    Mr. Ruskin, in his petulant-playful way, has touched upon the feeling of  amaze most people have who look for the first time at Botticelli's  _Judith_ tripping smoothly and lightly over the hill-country, her  steadfast maid dogging with intent patient eyes every step she takes.  You say it is flippant, affected, pedantic. For answer, I refer you to  the sage himself, who, from his point of view--that painting may fairly  deal with a chapter of history--is perfectly right. The prevailing  strain of the story is the strength of weakness--_ex dulci fortitudo_,  to invert the old enigma. \"O God, O my God, hear me also, a widow. Break  down their stateliness by the hand of a woman!\" It is the refrain that  runs through the whole history of Israel, that reasonable complacency of  a little people in their God-fraught destiny. And, withal, a streak of  savage spite: that the audacious oppressor shall be done scornfully to  death. There is the motive of Jael and Sisera too. So \"she smote twice  upon his neck with all her might, and she took away his head from him,  and tumbled his body down from the bed.\" Ho! what a fate for the  emissary of the Great King. Wherefore, once more, the jubilant paradox,  \"The Lord hath smitten him by the hand of a woman!\" That is it: the  amazing, thrilling antithesis insisted on over and over again by the old  Hebrew bard. \"Her sandals ravished his eyes, her beauty took his mind  prisoner, and the fauchion passed through his neck.\" That is the  _leit-motif_: Sandro the poet knew it perfectly well and taught it to  the no small comfort of Mr. Ruskin and his men. Giuditta, dainty,  blue-eyed, a girl still and three years a widow, flits homeward through  a spring landscape of grey and green and the smile of a milky sky, being  herself the dominant of the chord, with her bough of slipt olive and her  jagged scimitar, with her pretty blue fal-lals smocked and puffed, and  her yellow curls floating over her shoulders. On her slim feet are the  sandals that ravished his eyes; all her maiden bravery is dancing and  fluttering like harebells in the wind. Behind her plods the slave girl  folded in an orange scarf, bearing that shapeless, nameless burden of  hers, the head of the grim Lord Holofernes. Oh, for that, it is the  legend itself! For look at the girl's eyes. What does their dreamy  solemnity mean if not, \"the Lord hath smitten him by the hand of a  woman\"? One other delicate bit of symbolizing he has allowed himself,  which I may not omit. You are to see by whom this deed was done: by a  woman who has unsexed herself. Judith is absorbed in her awful service;  her robe trails on the ground and clings about her knees; she is  unconscious of the hindrance. The gates of Bethulia are in sight; the  Chaldean horsemen are abroad, but she has no anxiety to escape. She is  swift because her life just now courses swiftly; but there is no haste.  The maid, you shall mark, picks up her skirts with careful hand, and  steps out the more lustily for it.    So far Botticelli the poet, and so far also Mr. Ruskin, reader of  pictures. What says Botticelli the painter? Had he no instincts to tell  him that his art could have little to say to a legend? Or that a legend  might be the subject of an epic (here, indeed, was an epic ready made),  might, under conditions, be the subject of a drama; but could not, under  any conditions, be alone the subject of a picture? I don't for a moment  suggest that he had, or that any artist ever goes to work in this  double-entry, methodical way, but are we entitled to say that he was not  influenced by his predilections, his determinations as a draughtsman,  when he squared himself to illustrate the Bible? We say that the subject  of a picture is the spirit of natural fact. If Botticelli was a painter,  _that_ is what he must have looked for, and must have found, in every  picture he painted. Where, then, was he to get his natural facts in the  story of Judith? What is, in that story, the natural, essential (as  opposed to the historical, fleeting) fact? It is murder. Judith's deed  was what the old Scots law incisively calls _slauchter_. It may be  glossed over as assassination or even execution--in fact, in Florence,  where Giuliano was soon to be taken off, it did not fail to be so  called: it remains, however, just murder. Botticelli, not shirking the  position at all, judged murder to be a natural fact, and its spirit or  essence swiftness and stealth. Chaucer, let us note, had been of the  same mind:      \"The smyler with the knyf under his cloke,\"    and so on, in lines not be matched for hasty and dreadful suggestion.  Swiftness and stealth, the ambush, the averted face and the sudden stab,  are the standing elements of murder: pare off all the rest, you come  down to that. Your staring looks, your blood, your \"chirking,\" are  accidentals. They may be there (for each of us carries a carcase), but  the horror of sudden death is above them: a man may strangle with his  thoughts cleaner than with his pair of hands. And as \"matter\" is but the  stuff wherewith Nature works, and she is only insulted, not defied, when  we flout or mangle it, so it is against the high dignity of Art to  insist upon the carrion she must use. She will press, here the terror,  there the radiance, of essential fact; she will leave to us, seeing it  in her face, to add mentally the poor stage properties we have grown to  trust. No blood, if you please. Therefore, in Botticelli's _Judith_,  nothing but the essentials are insisted on; the rest we instantly  imagine, but it is not there to be sensed. The panel is in a tremor. So  swift and secret is Judith, so furtive the maid, we need no hurrying  horsemen to remind us of her oath,--\"Hear me, and I will do a thing  which shall go throughout all generations to the children of our  nation.\" Sudden death in the air; nature has been outraged. But there is  no drop of blood--the thin scarlet line along the sword-edge is a symbol  if you will--the pale head in the cloth is a mere \"thing:\" yet we all  know what has been done.        _Earthwork out of Tuscany_ (London, 1895).          THE AVENUE OF MIDDELHARNAIS    (_HOBBEMA_)    PAUL LAFOND      Some small and slender trees, branchless almost to their tops, border  the two sides of a road, which occupies the centre of the picture, and  extend all the way to a village which closes the horizon with several  masts and hulls of ships in profile against a sky where the sun is  veiled; to the right, a nursery-garden of shrubs and rose-trees  separated from the road by a wide ditch full of water; then, in the  middle distance, the buildings of a farm; to the left, a clump of trees  and another ditch, and further back the spire of a church; a huntsman,  with a gun on his shoulder and preceded by his dog, is walking on the  road, and two peasants--a man and a woman--have stopped to chat on the  path that leads across to the farm; a horticulturist is grafting the  shrubs in the nursery-garden; and this corner of a landscape has  sufficed for Hobbema to produce a masterpiece which the National Gallery  of London is justly proud to possess. This youngest of the great  European Museums is not the poorest and owns very considerable works of  every school.    [Illustration: THE AVENUE OF MIDDELHARNAIS.          _Hobbema._]    What is most admired in this picture of the Dutch Master? The firmness  of touch, the brilliancy of the key, the ease and breadth of execution  without the slightest sign of hesitation or alteration, or the  extraordinary perfection with which the perspective is rendered? We do  not know. Despite the complexity of the subject, the one defect of which  may be a slight lack of unity in the composition, the general effect of  the picture is simple and powerful, and the gradation of colour  harmonious and correct. It would be impossible to go any farther than  this artist has done in the interpretation of this tranquil Dutch  landscape. The deep values of the trees, the yellowish greys of the  road, and the sluggish water of the ditches, together with the blue sky  flecked with little grey and white clouds produce an ensemble of  absolute calm. The little figures which give life to this canvas are so  fine and delicate in execution that they leave nothing to be desired.  Here, as very rarely happens, the multiplication of details does not  spoil the effect of the whole.    This is a picture absolutely without a peer, and a page by itself in  Hobbema's work. This is true in every sense, even in the choice of  subject; for most frequently the painter borrows the motives for his  pictures from a different phase of nature. Ordinarily he interprets  forest-clearings; the skirts of a wood with poor huts hidden by great  trees; calm and fresh pools; and streams feeding humble mills. Witness  the one in the Louvre for which he showed so great a predilection and  which he reproduced under so many varied aspects.    But whatever may be the subject he treats, he always remains the happy  interpreter of the calm scenery of his own country of low and drowned  horizons; the painter attracted by the light which with him envelops  everything it approaches--trees, cottages, ground, waters, and  distances bathed in delicious depths.    Nature, gentle and friendly to man, which he saw with a simplicity and a  clearness approached by no other painter, attracted and charmed him  above all else, in contrast to his contemporary and friend, J. Ruysdael,  who, led away by heart-breaking melancholy, would never see any side of  her but the energetic and lugubrious, the sad and troubled.

Carlotta croaked like a toad:    \"Co-ack!\"    There was consternation on Carlotta's face and consternation on the  faces of all the audience.  The two managers in their box could not  suppress an exclamation of horror.  Every one felt that the thing was  not natural, that there was witchcraft behind it.  That toad smelt of  brimstone.  Poor, wretched, despairing, crushed Carlotta!    The uproar in the house was indescribable.  If the thing had happened  to any one but Carlotta, she would have been hooted.  But everybody  knew how perfect an instrument her voice was; and there was no display  of anger, but only of horror and dismay, the sort of dismay which men  would have felt if they had witnessed the catastrophe that broke the  arms of the Venus de Milo...  And even then they would have seen ...  and understood ...    But here that toad was incomprehensible!  So much so that, after some  seconds spent in asking herself if she had really heard that note, that  sound, that infernal noise issue from her throat, she tried to persuade  herself that it was not so, that she was the victim of an illusion, an  illusion of the ear, and not of an act of treachery on the part of her  voice....    Meanwhile, in Box Five, Moncharmin and Richard had turned very pale.  This extraordinary and inexplicable incident filled them with a dread  which was the more mysterious inasmuch as for some little while, they  had fallen within the direct influence of the ghost.  They had felt his  breath.  Moncharmin's hair stood on end.  Richard wiped the  perspiration from his forehead.  Yes, the ghost was there, around them,  behind them, beside them; they felt his presence without seeing him,  they heard his breath, close, close, close to them! ... They were sure  that there were three people in the box ...  They trembled ...  They  thought of running away ...  They dared not ...  They dared not make a  movement or exchange a word that would have told the ghost that they  knew that he was there! ... What was going to happen?    This happened.    \"Co-ack!\" Their joint exclamation of horror was heard all over the  house.  THEY FELT THAT THEY WERE SMARTING UNDER THE GHOST'S ATTACKS.  Leaning over the ledge of their box, they stared at Carlotta as though  they did not recognize her.  That infernal girl must have given the  signal for some catastrophe.  Ah, they were waiting for the  catastrophe!  The ghost had told them it would come!  The house had a  curse upon it!  The two managers gasped and panted under the weight of  the catastrophe.  Richard's stifled voice was heard calling to Carlotta:    \"Well, go on!\"    No, Carlotta did not go on ...  Bravely, heroically, she started afresh  on the fatal line at the end of which the toad had appeared.    An awful silence succeeded the uproar.  Carlotta's voice alone once  more filled the resounding house:    \"I feel without alarm ...\"    The audience also felt, but not without alarm. ..            \"I feel without alarm ...          I feel without alarm--co-ack!          With its melody enwind me--co-ack!          And all my heart sub--co-ack!\"    The toad also had started afresh!    The house broke into a wild tumult.  The two managers collapsed in  their chairs and dared not even turn round; they had not the strength;  the ghost was chuckling behind their backs!  And, at last, they  distinctly heard his voice in their right ears, the impossible voice,  the mouthless voice, saying:    \"SHE IS SINGING TO-NIGHT TO BRING THE CHANDELIER DOWN!\"    With one accord, they raised their eyes to the ceiling and uttered a  terrible cry.  The chandelier, the immense mass of the chandelier was  slipping down, coming toward them, at the call of that fiendish voice.  Released from its hook, it plunged from the ceiling and came smashing  into the middle of the stalls, amid a thousand shouts of terror.  A  wild rush for the doors followed.    The papers of the day state that there were numbers wounded and one  killed.  The chandelier had crashed down upon the head of the wretched  woman who had come to the Opera for the first time in her life, the one  whom M. Richard had appointed to succeed Mme. Giry, the ghost's  box-keeper, in her functions!  She died on the spot and, the next  morning, a newspaper appeared with this heading:    TWO HUNDRED KILOS ON THE HEAD OF A CONCIERGE    That was her sole epitaph!        Chapter VIII  The Mysterious Brougham      That tragic evening was bad for everybody.  Carlotta fell ill.  As for  Christine Daae, she disappeared after the performance.  A fortnight  elapsed during which she was seen neither at the Opera nor outside.    Raoul, of course, was the first to be astonished at the prima donna's  absence.  He wrote to her at Mme. Valerius' flat and received no reply.  His grief increased and he ended by being seriously alarmed at never  seeing her name on the program.  FAUST was played without her.    One afternoon he went to the managers' office to ask the reason of  Christine's disappearance.  He found them both looking extremely  worried.  Their own friends did not recognize them: they had lost all  their gaiety and spirits.  They were seen crossing the stage with  hanging heads, care-worn brows, pale cheeks, as though pursued by some  abominable thought or a prey to some persistent sport of fate.    The fall of the chandelier had involved them in no little  responsibility; but it was difficult to make them speak about it.  The  inquest had ended in a verdict of accidental death, caused by the wear  and tear of the chains by which the chandelier was hung from the  ceiling; but it was the duty of both the old and the new managers to  have discovered this wear and tear and to have remedied it in time.  And I feel bound to say that MM. Richard and Moncharmin at this time  appeared so changed, so absent-minded, so mysterious, so  incomprehensible that many of the subscribers thought that some event  even more horrible than the fall of the chandelier must have affected  their state of mind.    In their daily intercourse, they showed themselves very impatient,  except with Mme. Giry, who had been reinstated in her functions.  And  their reception of the Vicomte de Chagny, when he came to ask about  Christine, was anything but cordial.  They merely told him that she was  taking a holiday.  He asked how long the holiday was for, and they  replied curtly that it was for an unlimited period, as Mlle. Daae had  requested leave of absence for reasons of health.    \"Then she is ill!\" he cried.  \"What is the matter with her?\"    \"We don't know.\"    \"Didn't you send the doctor of the Opera to see her?\"    \"No, she did not ask for him; and, as we trust her, we took her word.\"    Raoul left the building a prey to the gloomiest thoughts.  He resolved,  come what might, to go and inquire of Mamma Valerius.  He remembered  the strong phrases in Christine's letter, forbidding him to make any  attempt to see her.  But what he had seen at Perros, what he had heard  behind the dressing-room door, his conversation with Christine at the  edge of the moor made him suspect some machination which, devilish  though it might be, was none the less human.  The girl's highly strung  imagination, her affectionate and credulous mind, the primitive  education which had surrounded her childhood with a circle of legends,  the constant brooding over her dead father and, above all, the state of  sublime ecstasy into which music threw her from the moment that this  art was made manifest to her in certain exceptional conditions, as in  the churchyard at Perros; all this seemed to him to constitute a moral  ground only too favorable for the malevolent designs of some mysterious  and unscrupulous person.  Of whom was Christine Daae the victim?  This  was the very reasonable question which Raoul put to himself as he  hurried off to Mamma Valerius.    He trembled as he rang at a little flat in the Rue  Notre-Dame-des-Victoires.  The door was opened by the maid whom he had  seen coming out of Christine's dressing-room one evening.  He asked if  he could speak to Mme. Valerius.  He was told that she was ill in bed  and was not receiving visitors.    \"Take in my card, please,\" he said.    The maid soon returned and showed him into a small and scantily  furnished drawing-room, in which portraits of Professor Valerius and  old Daae hung on opposite walls.    \"Madame begs Monsieur le Vicomte to excuse her,\" said the servant.  \"She can only see him in her bedroom, because she can no longer stand  on her poor legs.\"    Five minutes later, Raoul was ushered into an ill-lit room where he at  once recognized the good, kind face of Christine's benefactress in the  semi-darkness of an alcove.  Mamma Valerius' hair was now quite white,  but her eyes had grown no older; never, on the contrary, had their  expression been so bright, so pure, so child-like.    \"M. de Chagny!\" she cried gaily, putting out both her hands to her  visitor.  \"Ah, it's Heaven that sends you here! ... We can talk of HER.\"    This last sentence sounded very gloomily in the young man's ears.  He  at once asked:    \"Madame ... where is Christine?\"    And the old lady replied calmly:    \"She is with her good genius!\"    \"What good genius?\" exclaimed poor Raoul.    \"Why, the Angel of Music!\"    The viscount dropped into a chair.  Really?  Christine was with the  Angel of Music?  And there lay Mamma Valerius in bed, smiling to him  and putting her finger to her lips, to warn him to be silent!  And she  added:    \"You must not tell anybody!\"    \"You can rely on me,\" said Raoul.    He hardly knew what he was saying, for his ideas about Christine,  already greatly confused, were becoming more and more entangled; and it  seemed as if everything was beginning to turn around him, around the  room, around that extraordinary good lady with the white hair and  forget-me-not eyes.    \"I know!  I know I can!\" she said, with a happy laugh.  \"But why don't  you come near"]]]
