Most that remains from these poet-minstrels is contained in  the great national collections called Eddas, of which the oldest  received their present form early in the eleventh century. The sagas  contained in the Eddas form but a mere fragment of this ancient  literature. More than 200 scalds are known by name as authors of  sagas. These warriors, so pitiless and ferocious in battle, show  themselves full of devotion to their families. They were good sons,  tender husbands and kind fathers. The Eddas contain pieces of singular  delicacy of sentiment.\" Their songs, when compared with those of other  races, are more musical, the sentiment is richer and more profound,  and the rhythms have more variety. The melodic intervals, also,  indicate a more delicate sense of harmony than we find in other parts  of Europe at so early a date. Their instrument was the harp. Iceland  was the foremost musical center of the civilized world in the ninth  century, and it is said that kings in other parts of Europe sent there  for capable minstrels to lead the music in the courts.    A very highly finished English composition, a round with strict canon  for four voices, with a burden of the kind already mentioned, repeated  over and over by two other voices has been discovered. It is the  famous \"Summer is Coming In,\" composed, apparently, some time before  the year 1240.    On page 101 is given a reduced _fac simile_. It is written on a staff  of six lines, in the square notes of the Franconian period. The clef  is that of C. The asterisk at the end of the first phrase marks the  proper place of entrance for the successive voices, each in turn  commencing at the beginning when the previous one has arrived, at this  point. Below is the _pes_, or burden, which is to be repeated over and  over until the piece is finished. The complete solution is reproduced  in miniature from Grove's Dictionary, on pages 102 and 103. The  elaborateness of this piece of music led the original discoverers to  place it much later than the date above given, but more careful  examination of the manuscript justifies the conclusion that it was  written some time before 1240. It is by far the most elaborate piece  of ancient part music which has come down to us from times so remote.  It indicates conclusively that early in the thirteenth century, when  the composers of the old French school were struggling with the  beginnings of canonic imitation, confining their work to  ecclesiastical tonality, English musicians had arrived at a better art  and a true feeling for the major scale and key. Following is the  manuscript, the original size of the page being seven and  seven-twelfths inches by five and five-twelfths inches. The reduced  page before the reader represents the original upon a scale of about  two-thirds. The Latin directions below the fourth staff indicate the  manner of singing it.

[Illustration: Fig. 20.    SAXON HARP.    (From manuscript in the library of Cambridge University.)]    The harp was the principal instrument of these people, and their songs  and poems contain innumerable references to it. Sir Francis Palgrave  says in his \"History of the Anglo-Saxons\": \"They were great amateurs  of rhythm and harmony. In their festivals the harp passed from hand to  hand, and whoever could not show himself possessed of talent for  music, was counted unworthy of being received in good society. Adhelm,  bishop of Sherbourne, was not able to gain the attention of the  citizens otherwise than by habilitating himself as a minstrel and  taking his stand upon the bridge in the central part of the town and  there singing the ballads he had composed.\" One of the earliest  representations of the English harp that has come down to us is found  in the Harleian manuscript in the British Museum. It is presumably of  the tenth century.    [Illustration: Fig. 21.    KING DAVID.    (From Saxon Psalter of the tenth century.)]    The harp was three or four feet in height. It had eleven strings. It  was held between the knees, and was played with the right hand. In the  thirteenth century it appears to have been played with both hands.    Two circumstances in this account may well surprise us; nor are there  data available for resolving the questions to which they give rise.  The presence of two such instruments as the harp and the crwth in this  part of Europe is not to be explained by historical facts within our  knowledge. The harp does not appear in musical history after its  career in ancient Egypt until we find it in the hands of these bards,  scalds and minstrels of northern Europe. The Aryans who crossed into  India do not seem to have had it. Nor did the Greeks, nor the Romans.  We find it for a while in Asia, but only in civilizations derived from  that of Egypt, already in their decadence when they come under our  observation. Inasmuch as there are no data existing whereby we can  determine whether these people discovered the harp anew for themselves  or derived it from some other nation, and greatly improved it, either  supposition is allowable. Upon the whole, the probabilities appear to  be that this instrument was among the primitive acquisitions of the  Aryans. All of them were hunters, to whom the clang of the bow string  must have been a familiar sound. As already suggested, it seems that  the harp must have been the oldest type of stringed instrument of all.  The Aryans who crossed the Himalayas into India may have lost it, in  pursuit of some other type of instrument of plucked strings.    The crwth presents still more troublesome questions, which we must  admit are still less hopeful of solution. (See Fig. 22.)    In this case we find an instrument played with a bow in northern  Europe, far one side the course of Asiatic commerce, at a time when  there was no such instrument elsewhere in the world but in India.  Whence came the crwth? The rebec was not known in Arabia until nearly  two centuries after we find the crwth mentioned by Venance Fortunatus.  We have seen that the Sanskrit had four words meaning bow, a fact  affording presumptive evidence of the knowledge of this mode of  exciting vibrations, while the Sanskrit was still a spoken language.  It is possible that the bow was a discovery of the Aryans in their  early days, ere yet the family had begun to separate. The crwth may  have been a survival of this primitive discovery, still cherished  among a people not able to employ it intelligently, and not able to  develop its powers. For while the crwth was in Europe two centuries  before the violin, the improvement of this instrument was due to  stimulation from quite another quarter. It was the Arab rebec that  afforded the starting point for the modern violin, and this instrument  was not known in Europe until it came in by way of the crusaders or  the Spanish Arabs.    [Illustration: Fig. 22.]    Another popular instrument of music in all parts of Britain from the  earliest of modern times, was the bagpipe, a reed instrument generally  of imperfect intonation, the melody pipe being accompanied by a  faithful drone, consisting of the tonic and its octave, and  occasionally the fifth. It was the witty Sidney Smith who described  the effect as that of a \"tune tied to a post.\" This instrument was  common in all parts of Britain until driven out by better ones. It  still survives in Scotland. Its influence is distinctly to be traced  in the Scotch melodies founded upon the pentatonic scale, of which the  following is a specimen:    [Music illustration: SCOTCH MELODY (IN THE PENTATONIC SCALE).         The law-land lads think they are fine:       But O they're vain and wondrou' gawdy!       How much unlike that grace-fu' mien,       And man-ly looks of no High-land Lad-die!

THE ARABS OR SARACENS.      Upon many accounts the influence of the Arab civilization was  important in this quarter of the musical world, and it may here well  enough engage our attention,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2030"],[0,"Legends of Babylon and Egypt in Relation to Hebrew Tradition (#15)"],[1," show the same peculiarities of writing. The two tablets in fact  appear to have been written by the same hand, and as that copy of the  Dynastic List was probably drawn up before the latter half of the First  Dynasty of Babylon, we may assign the same approximate date for the  writing of our text. This of course only fixes a lower limit for the age  of the myth which it enshrines.         (1) The breadth of the tablet is 5 5/8 in., and it       originally measured about 7 in. in length from top to       bottom; but only about one-third of its inscribed surface is       preserved.         (2) Cf. Poebel, _Hist. Texts_, pp. 66 ff.         (3) No. 5.    That the composition is in the form of a poem may be seen at a glance  from the external appearance of the tablet, the division of many of the  lines and the blank spaces frequently left between the sign-groups being  due to the rhythmical character of the text. The style of the poetry  may be simple and abrupt, but it exhibits a familiar feature of both  Semitic-Babylonian and Hebrew poetry, in its constant employment of  partial repetition or paraphrase in parallel lines. The story it tells  is very primitive and in many respects unlike the Babylonian Versions  of the Deluge which we already possess. Perhaps its most striking  peculiarity is the setting of the story, which opens with a record of  the creation of man and animals, goes on to tell how the first cities  were built, and ends with a version of the Deluge, which is thus  recounted in its relation to the Sumerian history of the world. This  literary connexion between the Creation and Deluge narratives is of  unusual interest, in view of the age of our text. In the Babylonian  Versions hitherto known they are included in separate epics with  quite different contexts. Here they are recounted together in a single  document, much as they probably were in the history of Berossus and as  we find them in the present form of the Book of Genesis. This fact will  open up some interesting problems when we attempt to trace the literary  descent of the tradition.    But one important point about the text should be emphasized at once,  since it will affect our understanding of some very obscure passages, of  which no satisfactory explanation has yet been given. The assumption has  hitherto been made that the text is an epic pure and simple. It is quite  true that the greater part of it is a myth, recounted as a narrative in  poetical form, but there appear to me to be clear indications that  the myth was really embedded in an incantation. If this was so, the  mythological portion was recited for a magical purpose, with the object  of invoking the aid of the chief deities whose actions in the past are  there described, and of increasing by that means the potency of the  spell.(1) In the third lecture I propose to treat in more detail the  employment and significance of myth in magic, and we shall have occasion  to refer to other instances, Sumerian, Babylonian, and Egyptian, in  which a myth has reached us in a magical setting.         (1) It will be seen that the subject-matter of any myth       treated in this way has a close connexion with the object       for which the incantation was performed.    In the present case the inference of magical use is drawn from certain  passages in the text itself, which appear to be explicable only on that  hypothesis. In magical compositions of the later period intended  for recitation, the sign for \"Incantation\" is usually prefixed.  Unfortunately the beginning of our text is wanting; but its opening  words are given in the colophon, or title, which is engraved on the  left-hand edge of the tablet, and it is possible that the traces of  the first sign there are to be read as EN, \"Incantation\".(1) Should  a re-examination of the tablet establish this reading of the word,  we should have definite proof of the suggested magical setting of the  narrative. But even if we assume its absence, that would not invalidate  the arguments that can be adduced in favour of recognizing the existence  of a magical element, for they are based on internal evidence and enable  us to explain certain features which are inexplicable on Dr. Poebel's  hypothesis. Moreover, we shall later on examine another of the  newly published Sumerian compositions from Nippur, which is not only  semi-epical in character, but is of precisely the same shape, script,  and period as our text, and is very probably a tablet of the same  series. There also the opening signs of the text are wanting, but far  more of its contents are preserved and they present unmistakable traces  of magical use. Its evidence, as that of a parallel text, may therefore  be cited in support of the present contention. It may be added that in  Sumerian magical compositions of this early period, of which we have  not yet recovered many quite obvious examples, it is possible that  the prefix \"Incantation\" was not so invariable as in the later magical  literature.         (1) Cf. Poebel, _Hist. Texts_, p. 63, and _Hist. and Gram.       Texts_, pl. i. In the photographic reproduction of the edges       of the tablet given in the latter volume, pl. lxxxix, the       traces of the sign suggest the reading EN (= Sem. _siptu_,       \"incantation\"). But the sign may very possibly be read AN.       In the latter case we may read, in the traces of the two       sign-groups at the beginning of the text, the names of both       Anu and Enlil, who appear so frequently as the two presiding       deities in the myth.    It has already been remarked that only the lower half of our tablet  has been recovered, and that consequently a number of gaps occur in  the text. On the obverse the upper portion of each of the first three  columns is missing, while of the remaining three columns, which are  inscribed upon the reverse, the upper portions only are preserved. This  difference in the relative positions of the textual fragments recovered  is due to the fact that Sumerian scribes, like their later Babylonian  and Assyrian imitators, when they had finished writing the obverse of  a tablet, turned it over from bottom to top--not, as we should turn a  sheet of paper, from right to left. But in spite of the lacunae, the  sequence of events related in the mythological narrative may be followed  without difficulty, since the main outline of the story is already  familiar enough from the versions of the Semitic-Babylonian scribes and  of Berossus. Some uncertainties naturally remain as to what exactly was  included in the missing portions of the tablet; but the more important  episodes are fortunately recounted in the extant fragments, and these  suffice for a definition of the distinctive character of the Sumerian  Version. In view of its literary importance it may be advisable to  attempt a somewhat detailed discussion of its contents, column by  column;(1) and the analysis may be most conveniently divided into  numbered sections, each of which refers to one of the six columns of the  tablet. The description of the First Column will serve to establish  the general character of the text. Through the analysis of the tablet  parallels and contrasts will be noted with the Babylonian and Hebrew  Versions. It will then be possible to summarise, on a surer foundation,  the literary history of the traditions, and finally to estimate the  effect of our new evidence upon current theories as to the origin and  wide dispersion of Deluge stories.         (1) In the lecture as delivered the contents of each column       were necessarily summarized rather briefly, and conclusions       were given without discussion of the evidence.    The following headings, under which the six numbered sections may be  arranged, indicate the contents of each column and show at a glance the  main features of the Sumerian Version:      I. Introduction to the Myth, and account of Creation.    II. The Antediluvian Cities.    III. The Council of the Gods, and Ziusudu's piety.    IV. The Dream-Warning.    V. The Deluge, the Escape of the Great Boat, and the Sacrifice to the  Sun-god.    VI. The Propitiation of the Angry Gods, and Ziusudu's Immortality.          I. INTRODUCTION TO THE MYTH, AND ACCOUNT OF CREATION    The beginning of the text is wanting, and the earliest lines preserved  of the First Column open with the closing sentences of a speech,  probably by the chief of the four creating deities, who are later on  referred to by name. In it there is a reference to a future destruction  of mankind, but the context is broken; the lines in question begin:         \"As for my human race, from (_or_ in) its destruction will I       cause it to be (. . .),         For Nintu my creatures (. . .) will I (. . .).\"    From the reference to \"my human race\" it is clear that the speaker is a  creating deity; and since the expression is exactly parallel to the term  \"my people\" used by Ishtar, or Belit-ili, \"the Lady of the gods\", in the  Babylonian Version of the Deluge story when she bewails the destruction  of mankind, Dr. Poebel assigns the speech to Ninkharsagga, or Nintu,(1)  the goddess who later in the column is associated with Anu, Enlil, and  Enki in man's creation. But the mention of Nintu in her own speech  is hardly consistent with that supposition,(2) if we assume with Dr.  Poebel, as we are probably justified in doing, that the title Nintu  is employed here and elsewhere in the narrative merely as a synonym of  Ninkharsagga.(3) It appears to me far more probable that one of the two  supreme gods, Anu or Enlil, is the speaker,(4) and additional grounds  will be cited later in support of this view. It is indeed possible, in  spite of the verbs and suffixes in the singular, that the speech is to  be assigned to both Anu and Enlil, for in the last column, as we shall  see, we find verb in the singular following references to both these  deities. In any case one of the two chief gods may be regarded as "]]]
