The mating season occurred when the herd was on its summer range. The  spring calves were from two to four months old. Through continued  feasting on the new crop of buffalo-grass and bunch-grass--the most  nutritious in the world, perhaps--every buffalo in the herd had grown  round-sided, fat, and vigorous. The faded and weather-beaten suit of  winter hair had by that time fallen off and given place to the new coat  of dark gray and black, and, excepting for the shortness of his hair,  the buffalo was in prime condition.    During the \"running season,\" as it was called by the plainsmen, the  whole nature of the herd was completely changed. Instead of being broken  up into countless small groups and dispersed over a vast extent of  territory, the herd came together in a dense and confused mass of many  thousand individuals, so closely congregated as to actually blacken the  face of the landscape. As if by a general and irresistible impulse,  every straggler would be drawn to the common center, and for miles on  every side of the great herd the country would be found entirely  deserted.    At this time the herd itself became a seething mass of activity and  excitement. As usual under such conditions, the bulls were half the time  chasing the cows, and fighting each other during the other half. These  actual combats, which were always of short duration and over in a few  seconds after the actual collision took place, were preceded by the  usual threatening demonstrations, in which the bull lowers his head  until his nose almost touches the ground, roars like a fog-horn until  the earth seems to fairly tremble with the vibration, glares madly upon  his adversary with half-white eyeballs, and with his forefeet paws up  the dry earth and throws it upward in a great cloud of dust high above  his back. At such times the mingled roaring--it can not truthfully be  described as lowing or bellowing--of a number of huge bulls unite and  form a great volume of sound like distant thunder, which has often been  heard at a distance of from 1 to 3 miles. I have even been assured by  old plainsmen that under favorable atmospheric conditions such sounds  have been heard five miles.    Notwithstanding the extreme frequency of combats between the bulls  during this season, their results were nearly always harmless, thanks to  the thickness of the hair and hide on the head and shoulders, and the  strength of the neck.    Under no conditions was there ever any such thing as the pairing off or  mating of male and female buffaloes for any length of time. In the  entire process of reproduction the bison's habits were similar to those  of domestic cattle. For years the opinion was held by many, in some  cases based on misinterpreted observations, that in the herd the  identity of each family was partially preserved, and that each old bull  maintained an individual harem and group of progeny of his own. The  observations of Colonel Dodge completely disprove this very interesting  theory; for at best it was only a picturesque fancy, ascribing to the  bison a degree of intelligence which he never possessed.    At the close of the breeding season the herd quickly settles down to its  normal condition. The mass gradually resolves itself into the numerous  bands or herdlets of from twenty to a hundred individuals, so  characteristic of bison on their feeding grounds, and these gradually  scatter in search of the best grass until the herd covers many square  miles of country.    In his search for grass the buffalo displayed but little intelligence or  power of original thought. Instead of closely following the divides  between water courses where the soil was best and grass most abundant,  he would not hesitate to wander away from good feeding-grounds into  barren \"bad lands,\" covered with sage-brush, where the grass was very  thin and very poor. In such broken country as Montana, Wyoming, and  southwestern Dakota, the herds, on reaching the best grazing grounds on  the divides, would graze there day after day until increasing thirst  compelled them to seek for water. Then, actuated by a common impulse,  the search for a water-hole was begun in a business-like way. The leader  of a herd, or \"bunch,\" which post was usually filled by an old cow,  would start off down the nearest \"draw,\" or stream-heading, and all the  rest would fall into line and follow her. From the moment this start was  made there was no more feeding, save as a mouthful of grass could be  snatched now and then without turning aside. In single file, in a line  sometimes half a mile long and containing between one and two hundred  buffaloes, the procession slowly marched down the coulée, close  alongside the gully as soon as the water-course began to cut a pathway  for itself. When the gully curved to right or left the leader would  cross its bed and keep straight on until the narrow ditch completed its  wayward curve and came back to the middle of the coulée. The trail of a  herd in search of water is usually as good a piece of engineering as  could be executed by the best railway surveyor, and is governed by  precisely the same principles. It always follows the level of the  valley, swerves around the high points, and crosses the stream  repeatedly in order to avoid climbing up from the level. The same trail  is used again and again by different herds until the narrow path, not  over a foot in width, is gradually cut straight down into the soil to a  depth of several inches, as if it had been done by a 12-inch  grooving-plane. By the time the trail has been worn down to a depth of 6  or 7 inches, without having its width increased in the least, it is no  longer a pleasant path to walk in, being too much like a narrow ditch.  Then the buffaloes abandon it and strike out a new one alongside, which  is used until it also is worn down and abandoned.    To day the old buffalo trails are conspicuous among the very few classes  of objects which remain as a reminder of a vanished race. The herds of  cattle now follow them in single file just as the buffaloes did a few  years ago, as they search for water in the same way. In some parts of  the West, in certain situations, old buffalo trails exist which the wild  herds wore down to a depth of 2 feet or more.    Mile after mile marched the herd, straight down-stream, bound for the  upper water-hole. As the hot summer drew on, the pools would dry up one  by one, those nearest the source being the first to disappear. Toward  the latter part of summer, the journey for water was often a long one.  Hole after hole would be passed without finding a drop of water. At last  a hole of mud would be found, below that a hole with a little muddy  water, and a mile farther on the leader would arrive at a shallow pool  under the edge of a \"cut bank,\" a white, snow-like deposit of alkali on  the sand encircling its margin, and incrusting the blades of grass and  rushed that grew up from the bottom. The damp earth around the pool was  cut up by a thousand hoof-prints, and the water was warm, strongly  impregnated with alkali, and yellow with animal impurities, but it was  _water_. The nauseous mixture was quickly surrounded by a throng of  thirsty, heated, and eager buffaloes of all ages, to which the oldest  and strongest asserted claims of priority. There was much crowding and  some fighting, but eventually all were satisfied. After such a long  journey to water, a herd would usually remain by it for some hours,  lying down, resting, and drinking at intervals until completely  satisfied.    Having drunk its fill, the herd would never march directly back to the  choice feeding grounds it had just left, but instead would leisurely  stroll off at a right angle from the course it came, cropping for awhile  the rich bunch grasses of the bottom-lands, and then wander across the  hills in an almost aimless search for fresh fields and pastures new.  When buffaloes remained long in a certain locality it was a common thing  for them to visit the same watering-place a number of times, at  intervals of greater or less duration, according to circumstances.    When undisturbed on his chosen range, the bison used to be fond of lying  down for an hour or two in the middle of the day, particularly when fine  weather and good grass combined to encourage him in luxurious habits. I  once discovered with the field glass a small herd of buffaloes lying  down at midday on the slope of a high ridge, and having ridden hard for  several hours we seized the opportunity to unsaddle and give our horses  an hour's rest before making the attack. While we were so doing, the  herd got up, shifted its position to the opposite side of the ridge, and  again laid down, every buffalo with his nose pointing to windward.    Old hunters declare that in the days of their abundance, when feeding on  their ranges in fancied security, the younger animals were as playful as  well-fed domestic calves. It was a common thing to see them cavort and  frisk around with about as much grace as young elephants, prancing and  running to and fro with tails held high in air \"like scorpions.\"    Buffaloes are very fond of rolling in dry dirt or even in mud, and this  habit is quite strong in captive animals. Not only is it indulged in  during the shedding season, but all through the fall and winter. The two  live buffaloes in the National Museum are so much given to rolling, even  in rainy weather, that it is necessary to card them every few days to  keep them presentable.    Bulls are much more given to rolling than the cows, especially after  they have reached maturity. They stretch out at full length, rub their  heads violently to and fro on the ground, in which the horn serves as  the chief point of contact and slides over the ground"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17760"],[0,"How to Enjoy Paris in 1842 (#15)"],[1,"Dulaure, that part of the Louvre which is the  oldest, was built by Henry II from the design of Pierre Lescot. I have  found other authors attribute the erection of a portion of the Louvre to  Francis, but it appears that his son had all pulled down which was then  standing, and had it built as it now remains, except the wing in which  the pictures are exhibited, which is of a more recent date, and was not  terminated until the time of Louis XIV. The augmentation of some few  colleges and hospitals were the only acts of this reign from which any  advantages to Paris were derived.    In 1559, at the age of sixteen, Francis II ascended the throne; his name  is familiar to us as the first husband of the unfortunate Mary, Queen of  Scots; his mother, Catherine de Medici, of infamous memory, took the  reigns of government in her hands and wreaked all her fury upon the  protestants. Francis, too young to have displayed any decided tone of  character, expired in 1560; the persecution of the huguenots, as the  followers of the Reformed Church were styled, seems to have exclusively  occupied the whole time during this short reign, therefore no attention  was devoted to the improving of Paris, which was next brought under the  dominion of the young monster, Charles IX, or rather the continued reign  of his sanguinary mother, Catherine, he being but ten years of age. The  massacre of the night of St. Bartholomew is known to all. Charles  certainly had some revulsive feelings on the subject, and several times  would have given orders to stop it, but Catherine bade him assert the  claims of heaven, and be the noble instrument of its vengeance, \"Go on,  then,\" exclaimed the King, \"and let none remain to reproach me with the  deed,\" and after all, when daylight appeared, he placed himself at a  window of the Louvre, which overlooks the Seine, and with a carbine he  fired at the unfortunate fugitives who tried to save themselves by  swimming across the river. In his reign was built the Tuileries, he  himself laying the first stone; it was intended for the Queen Mother,  but Catherine did not inhabit it long, her conscience not permitting her  to enjoy repose anywhere. Charles died a few months after the dreadful  massacre of the protestants, a prey to all the pangs of remorse, and was  succeeded in 1574 by his brother Henry III. Brought up in the same  pernicious school, under the same infamous mother as his predecessor,  little could be hoped from such a being; he was inclined, however, to  be somewhat more tolerant than his brother, but was frightened into  persecuting the protestants; his mother died at the age of seventy,  goaded by the consciousness of the crimes she had committed; civil war  raged during the reign of Henry, and he was obliged to quit his capital  and join the protestants, whom he soon, however, betrayed; without  energy to adopt any certain line of conduct, he balanced between the two  parties of catholics and protestants, until both sects despised him, and  at length he was stabbed by a fanatic friar, named Jacques Clement.  Several convents and religious establishments were founded in his reign,  amongst the rest the Feuillans, which was extensive and had a church  attached, but in 1804 the whole was demolished, and on its site, and  that of the monastery of the Capucins, were built the Rue Rivoli,  Castiglione, and Monthabor, and a terrace of the gardens of the  Tuileries is still called the Feuillans. The Pont Neuf was also built in  this reign. In 1589, Henry IV, surnamed the Great, succeeded to the  throne; he was of the house of Bourbon, and descended from Robert, the  second son of Louis the Ninth. He was compelled to begin his reign by  laying siege to his own capital, which was in the hands of his enemies,  who defended it with 58,000 troops, and 1,500 armed priests, scholars  and monks, and after three years' vain endeavours he was obliged to  renounce the protestant religion, and conform to the catholic  ceremonies, which produced a truce, and Henry at last entered Paris. By  his mild and judicious conduct he regenerated the prosperity of France,  and published the famous edict of Nantes in favour of the protestants,  and acted with considerable wisdom under the difficult circumstances in  which he was placed, by the intemperate zeal of the catholics and  huguenots. At last, after many unsuccessful attempts upon his life, he  was stabbed in his own carriage by Ravaillac, a religious fanatic, who  conceived that the King was not sufficiently zealous in the cause of  catholicism; he was regretted by every worthy character throughout his  realms, for, although he had many of the faults common to men, yet he  had such redeeming qualities that he well merited the title of _Great_.  During his reign Paris was considerably embellished, the improvement of  the city being with him a favourite object. The Hospital of Saint Louis  was built by his orders, himself laying the first stone; it is still  standing, and is generally filled with patients, who receive the most  humane treatment. It is situated in the Rue Careme Prenant, near the  Barriere du Combat. He established a manufactory of Persian carpets, on  the _Quai de Billy_, No. 30.    The Rue and Place Dauphine, the Place Royale, which still exhibits a  square of houses unaltered in style since the day they were built, owed  their construction to his mania for building and passion for augmenting  and improving his capital. Several other streets were extended and in  part rebuilt under his reign, besides which he founded different  institutions, had divers fountains and gates erected, as well as  bridges, and some other public edifices, which having since disappeared  or become the houses of individuals, workshops, warehouses, etc., it is  not worthwhile to recapitulate them, as they cease to be objects of  interest. Several theatres were established at this period for the first  time, the performers having merely given representations in large rooms  belonging to public buildings where they could get accommodation,  particularly in the Hotel de Bourgoyne, in the Rue Mauconseil, which at  last acquired the name of a theatre; but a company of Italians received  such encouragement from Henry IV, that they were enabled, in a situation  assigned them regularly, to establish a theatre in the Hotel d'Argent,  Rue de la Poterie, corner of the Rue de la Verrerie. He was equally the  patron of literature, and of the arts and sciences; the Tuileries and  Louvre, under his directions, received the material and superintendence  which was requisite for their completion, as far as the design extended  at that epoch.    In 1610 Louis XIII, but nine years of age, became heir to the throne,  and Marie de Medici, his mother and widow of Henry IV, was nominated  Regent; her first act was to call into power all her husband's enemies,  which consisted of her own favourites, through whom she governed, and  when her regency ceased, her son followed her example and became the  instrument of others, until the power of governing was exclusively  acquired by Cardinal Richelieu, who devoted his extraordinary talents  in a degree to the interests of his country, but more especially to the  gratification of his vanity, and the promotion of his ambitious  projects; descending to the extremes of injustice, dissimulation, and  cruelty, to accomplish his object, he became the persecutor of Mary, who  had raised him from comparative obscurity, and caused her exile, in  which she died in poverty, which she certainly merited by her  misconduct, but not by the instigation of her _protege_ Richelieu. But  with all his sins, he effected much good; he founded the Royal Printing  establishment, the French Academy, also the Garden of Plants; he built  the _Palais-Royal_ and rebuilt the Church and College of the Sorbonne.  In this reign more religious establishments were founded than in any  preceding, amongst which were the Convent of the _Carmes Dechausses_,  No. 70, _Rue de Vaugirard_, the monks of which possessed a secret for  making a particular kind of liquid which is called _Eau des Carmes_, and  is still in demand; the church and building belonging to the  establishment are now standing, and were recently occupied by nuns. The  Convent of _Jacobins_ between the _Rues du Bac_ and _St-Dominique_, with  its Church, which still remains and is called _St-Thomas d'Aquin_, is  well worth notice, and the monastery is now occupied by the armoury  which is one of the most interesting sights of Paris. The _Benedictines  Anglaises_, No. 269, _Rue St-Jacques_, was formerly occupied by English  monks, who fled their country on account of some persecution in the  reign of Henry VIII.    In 1674, Father Joseph Shirburne, the prior of monastery, pulled down  the old building, and erected another in its place more commodious, also  a church attached to it in which James the Second of England was buried,  as also his daughter Mary Stuart. It has now become the property of an  individual, and is at present occupied as a factory of cotton. The  Oratoire in the _Rue Saint-Honore_, since devoted to protestant worship,  was built in the year 1621 by M. de Berulle, since Cardinal, on the site  of the _Hotel du Bouchage_, once the residence of Gabrielle d'Estrees,  the favourite mistress of Henry IV. The Convent of the Capucins,  situated in the _Place des Capucins_, at present an Hospital. _Seminaire  des Oratoriens_, _Rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques_, 254, now occupied by  the Deaf and Dumb. _College des Jesuites_, at present College of  _Louis-le-Grand_. Convent of _Petits-Peres_: the church of which  still remains and is situated at the corner of the _Rue  Notre-Dame-des-Victoires_. The Monk Fiacre, called a Saint, was buried  in this church; thinking that his sanctity was a preservative against  evil, they stuck his portrait on all the hackney coaches, which was the  cause of their ever after being"]]]
