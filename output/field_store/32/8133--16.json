The door slowly opened; and St. Nicholas, in full array, stood before  them. You could have heard a pin drop. Soon he spoke. What a mysterious  majesty in his voice! what kindliness in his tone!    \"Karel van Gleck, I am pleased to greet thee, and thy honored _vrouw_,  Kathrine, and thy son, and his good _vrouw_, Annie.    \"Children, I greet ye all,--Hendrick, Hilda, Broom, Katy, Huygens and  Lucretia. And thy cousins,--Wolfert, Diedrich, Mayken, Voost and  Katrina. Good children ye have been, in the main, since I last accosted  ye. Diedrich was rude at the Haarlem fair last fall; but he has tried to  atone for it since. Mayken has failed, of late, in her lessons; and too  many sweets and trifles have gone to her lips, and too few stivers to  her charity-box. Diedrich, I trust, will be a polite, manly boy for the  future; and Mayken will endeavor to shine as a student. Let her  remember, too, that economy and thrift are needed in the foundation of a  worthy and generous life. Little Katy has been cruel to the cat more  than once. St. Nicholas can hear the cat cry when its tail is pulled. I  will forgive her, if she will remember from this hour that the smallest  dumb creatures have feeling, and must not be abused.\"    As Katy burst into a frightened cry, the saint graciously remained  silent until she was soothed.    \"Master Broom,\" he resumed, \"I warn thee that boys who are in the habit  of putting snuff upon the foot-stove of the school-mistress may one day  be discovered, and receive a flogging--\"    (Master Broom colored, and stared in great astonishment.)    \"But, thou art such an excellent scholar, I shall make thee no further  reproof.    \"Thou, Hendrick, didst distinguish thyself in the archery match last  spring, and hit the _doel_,[A] though the bird was swung before it to  unsteady thine eye. I give thee credit for excelling in manly sport and  exercise; though I must not unduly countenance thy boat-racing, since it  leaves thee too little time for thy proper studies.    [Footnote A: Bull's-eye.]    \"Lucretia and Hilda shall have a blessed sleep to-night. The  consciousness of kindness to the poor, devotion in their souls, and  cheerful, hearty obedience to household rule, will render them happy.    \"With one and all I avow myself well content. Goodness, industry,  benevolence and thrift have prevailed in your midst. Therefore, my  blessing upon you; and may the New Year find all treading the paths of  obedience, wisdom and love! To-morrow you shall find more substantial  proofs that I have been in your home. Farewell!\"    With these words came a great shower of sugar-plums upon a linen sheet  spread out in front of the doors. A general scramble followed. The  children fairly tumbled over each other in their eagerness to fill their  baskets. Mevrouw cautiously held the baby down upon the sheet till the  chubby little fists were filled. Then the bravest of the youngsters  sprang up and threw open the closed doors. In vain they searched the  mysterious apartment. St. Nicholas was nowhere to be seen.    Soon they all sped to another room, where stood a table, covered with  the whitest of linen damask. Each child, in a flutter of pleasure, laid  a shoe upon it, and each shoe held a little hay for the good saint's  horse. The door was then carefully locked, and its key hidden in the  mother's bedroom. Next followed good-night kisses, a grand family  procession to the upper floor, merry farewells at bedroom doors, and  silence, at last, reigned in the Van Gleck mansion.    Early the next morning, the door was solemnly unlocked and opened in the  presence of the assembled household; when, lo! a sight appeared, proving  good St. Nicholas to be a saint of his word.    Every shoe was filled to overflowing; and beside each stood a  many-colored pile. The table was heavy with its load of  presents,--candies, toys, trinkets, books and other articles. Every one  had gifts, from grandfather down to the baby.           *       *       *       *       *        THE CHRISTMAS HOLLY        ELIZA COOK        The holly! the holly! oh, twine it with bay--        Come give the holly a song;      For it helps to drive stern winter away,        With his garment so sombre and long;        It peeps through the trees with its berries of red,        And its leaves of burnished green,      When the flowers and fruits have long been dead,        And not even the daisy is seen.      Then sing to the holly, the Christmas holly,        That hangs over peasant and king;      While we laugh and carouse 'neath its glittering boughs,        To the Christmas holly we'll sing.        The gale may whistle, the frost may come        To fetter the gurgling rill;      The woods may be bare, and warblers dumb,        But holly is beautiful still.      In the revel and light of princely halls        The bright holly branch is found;      And its shadow falls on the lowliest walls,        While the brimming horn goes round.        The ivy lives long, but its home must be        Where graves and ruins are spread;      There's beauty about the cypress tree,        But it flourishes near the dead;      The laurel the warrior's brow may wreathe,        But it tells of tears and blood;      I sing the holly, and who can breathe        Aught of that that is not good?        Then sing to the holly, the Christmas holly,        That hangs over peasant and king;      While we laugh and carouse 'neath its glittering boughs,        To the Christmas holly we'll sing.           *       *       *       *       *        TO THE FIR-TREE        FROM THE GERMAN        O Fir-tree green! O Fir-tree green!        Your leaves are constant ever,      Not only in the summer time,      But through the winter's snow and rime        You're fresh and green forever.        O Fir-tree green! O Fir-tree green!        I still shall love you dearly!      How oft to me on Christmas night      Your laden boughs have brought delight.      O Fir-tree green! O Fir-tree green!        I still shall love you dearly.           *       *       *       *       *        THE MAHOGANY-TREE        WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY        Christmas is here;      Winds whistle shrill,      Icy and chill,      Little care we;      Little we fear      Weather without,      Sheltered about      The Mahogany-Tree.        Once on the boughs      Birds of rare plume      Sang in its bloom;      Night-birds are we;      Here we carouse,      Singing, like them,      Perched round the stem      Of the jolly old tree.        Here let us sport,      Boys, as we sit--      Laughter and wit      Flashing so free.      Life is but short--      When we are gone,      Let them sing on,      Round the old tree.        Evenings we knew,      Happy as this;      Faces we miss,      Pleasant to see.      Kind hearts and true,      Gentle and just,      Peace to your dust!      We sing round the tree.        Care like a dun,      Lurks at the gate;      Let the dog wait;      Happy we'll be!      Drink, every one;      Pile up the coals;      Fill the red bowls,      Round the old tree!        Drain we the cup.--      Friend, art afraid?      Spirits are laid      In the Red Sea.      Mantle it up;      Empty it yet;      Let us forget,      Round the old tree!        Sorrows begone!      Life and its ills,      Duns and their bills,      Bid we to flee.      Come with the dawn,      Blue-devil sprite;      Leave us to-night,      Round the old tree!           *       *       *       *       *    CHRISTMAS    WASHINGTON IRVING        But is old, old, good old Christmas gone? Nothing but the hair on      his good, gray, old head and beard left? Well, I will have that,      seeing I cannot have more of him.                                 Hue and Cry after Christmas.          A man might then behold        At Christmas, in each hall,      Good fires to curb the cold,        And meat for great and small.      The neighbors were friendly bidden,        And all had welcome true,      The poor from the gates were not chidden,        When this old cap was new.                                    Old Song.        There is nothing in England that exercises a more delightful spell over  my imagination than the lingerings of the holiday customs and rural  games of former times. They recall the pictures my fancy used to draw in  the May morning of life, when as yet I only knew the world through  books, and believed it to be all that poets had painted it; and they  bring with them the flavor of those honest days of yore, in which,  perhaps with equal fallacy, I am apt to think the world was more  homebred, social, and joyous than at present. I regret to say that they  are daily growing more and more faint, being gradually worn away by  time, but still more obliterated by modern fashion. They resemble those  picturesque morsels of Gothic architecture, which we see crumbling in  various parts of the country, partly dilapidated by the waste of ages,  and partly lost in the additions and alterations of latter days. Poetry,  however, clings with cherishing fondness about the rural game and  holiday revel, from which it has derived so many of its themes--as the  ivy winds its rich foliage about the Gothic arch and mouldering tower,  gratefully repaying their support, by clasping together their tottering  remains, and, as it were, embalming them in verdure.    Of all the old festivals, however, that of Christmas awakens the  strongest and most heartfelt associations. There is a tone of solemn and  sacred feeling that blends with our conviviality, and lifts the spirit  to a state of hallowed and elevated enjoyment. The services of the  church about this season are extremely tender and inspiring: they dwell  on the beautiful story of the origin of our faith, and the pastoral  scenes that accompanied its announcement; they gradually increase in  fervor and pathos during"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18909"],[0,"Poems Teachers Ask For (#15)"],[1,"come to you.  Go and toil in any vineyard,    Do not fear to do or dare,  If you want a field of labor,    You can find it anywhere.        _Ellen H. Gates._          The House by the Side of the Road      There are hermit souls that live withdrawn    In the peace of their self-content;  There are souls, like stars, that dwell apart,    In a fellowless firmament;  There are pioneer souls that blaze their paths    Where highways never ran;  But let me live by the side of the road    And be a friend to man.    Let me live in a house by the side of the road,    Where the race of men go by,  The men who are good and the men who are bad,    As good and as bad as I.  I would not sit in the scorner's seat,    Or hurl the cynic's ban;  Let me live in a house by the side of the road    And be a friend to man.    I see from my house by the side of the road,    By the side of the highway of life,  The men who press with the ardor of hope,    The men who are faint with the strife.  But I turn not away from their smiles nor their tears,    Both parts of an infinite plan;  Let me live in my house by the side of the road    And be a friend to man.    I know there are brook-gladdened meadows ahead    And mountains of wearisome height;  That the road passes on through the long afternoon    And stretches away to the night.  But still I rejoice when the travelers rejoice,    And weep with the strangers that moan.  Nor live in my house by the side of the road    Like a man who dwells alone.    Let me live in my house by the side of the road    Where the race of men go by;  They are good, they are bad, they are weak, they are strong,    Wise, foolish--so am I.  Then why should I sit in the scorner's seat,    Or hurl the cynic's ban?  Let me live in my house by the side of the road    And be a friend to man.        _Sam Walter Foss._          Asleep at the Switch      The first thing that I remember was Carlo tugging away,  With the sleeve of my coat fast in his teeth, pulling, as much as to       say:  \"Come, master, awake, attend to the switch, lives now depend upon you.  Think of the souls in the coming train, and the graves you are sending       them to.  Think of the mother and the babe at her breast, think of the father and       son,  Think of the lover and the loved one too, think of them doomed every one  To fall (as it were by your very hand) into yon fathomless ditch,  Murdered by one who should guard them from harm, who now lies asleep at       the switch.\"    I sprang up amazed--scarce knew where I stood, sleep had o'ermastered       me so;  I could hear the wind hollowly howling, and the deep river dashing below,  I could hear the forest leaves rustling, as the trees by the tempest were       fanned,  But what was that noise in the distance? That, I could not understand.  I heard it at first indistinctly, like the rolling of some muffled drum,  Then nearer and nearer it came to me, till it made my very ears hum;  What is this light that surrounds me and seems to set fire to my brain?  What whistle's that, yelling so shrill? Ah! I know now; it's the train.    We often stand facing some danger, and seem to take root to the place;  So I stood--with this demon before me, its heated breath scorching my       face;  Its headlight made day of the darkness, and glared like the eyes of       some witch,--  The train was almost upon me before I remembered the switch.  I sprang to it, seizing it wildly, the train dashing fast down the track;  The switch resisted my efforts, some devil seemed holding it back;  On, on came the fiery-eyed monster, and shot by my face like a flash;  I swooned to the earth the next moment, and knew nothing after the crash.    How long I lay there unconscious 'twas impossible for me to tell;  My stupor was almost a heaven, my waking almost a hell,--  For then I heard the piteous moaning and shrieking of husbands and wives,  And I thought of the day we all shrink from, when I must account for       their lives;  Mothers rushed by me like maniacs, their eyes glaring madly and wild;  Fathers, losing their courage, gave way to their grief like a child;  Children searching for parents, I noticed, as by me they sped,  And lips, that could form naught but \"Mamma,\" were calling for one       perhaps dead.    My mind was made up in a moment, the river should hide me away,  When, under the still burning rafters I suddenly noticed there lay  A little white hand; she who owned it was doubtless an object of love  To one whom her loss would drive frantic, though she guarded him now       from above;  I tenderly lifted the rafters and quietly laid them one side;  How little she thought of her journey when she left for this dark, fatal       ride!  I lifted the last log from off her, and while searching for some spark       of life,  Turned her little face up in the starlight, and recognized--Maggie, my       wife!    O Lord! my scourge is a hard one, at a blow thou hast shattered my pride;  My life will be one endless nightmare, with Maggie away from my side.  How often I'd sat down and pictured the scenes in our long, happy life;  How I'd strive through all my lifetime, to build up a home for my wife;  How people would envy us always in our cozy and neat little nest;  How I should do all the labor, and Maggie should all the day rest;  How one of God's blessings might cheer us, how some day I perhaps should       be rich:--  But all of my dreams had been shattered, while I lay there asleep at the       switch!    I fancied I stood on my trial, the jury and judge I could see;  And every eye in the court room was steadily fixed upon me;  And fingers were pointed in scorn, till I felt my face blushing blood-red,  And the next thing I heard were the words, \"Hanged by the neck until       dead.\"  Then I felt myself pulled once again, and my hand caught tight hold of a       dress,  And I heard, \"What's the matter, dear Jim? You've had a bad nightmare, I       guess!\"  And there stood Maggie, my wife, with never a scar from the ditch,  I'd been taking a nap in my bed, and had not been \"asleep at the switch.\"        _George Hoey._          Each in His Own Tongue      A fire-mist and a planet,    A crystal and a cell,  A jellyfish and a saurian,    And caves where the cavemen dwell;  Then a sense of law and beauty,    And a face turned from the clod,--  Some call it Evolution,    And others call it God.    A haze in the far horizon,    The infinite, tender sky;  The ripe, rich tints of the cornfields,    And the wild geese sailing high;  And all over upland and lowland    The charm of the goldenrod,--  Some of us call it Nature,    And others call it God.    Like tides on a crescent sea-beach,    When the moon is new and thin,  Into our hearts high yearnings    Come welling and surging in,--  Come from the mystic ocean.    Whose rim no foot has trod,--  Some of us call it Longing,    And others call it God.    A picket frozen on duty,    A mother starved for her brood,  Socrates drinking the hemlock,    And Jesus on the rood;  The millions who, humble and nameless,    The straight, hard pathway trod,--  Some call it Consecration,    And others call it God.        _William Herbert Carruth._          How Cyrus Laid the Cable      Come, listen all unto my song;    It is no silly fable;  'Tis all about the mighty cord    They call the Atlantic Cable.    Bold Cyrus Field he said, says he,    I have a pretty notion  That I can run the telegraph    Across the Atlantic Ocean.    Then all the people laughed, and said    They'd like to see him do it;  He might get half-seas over, but    He never could go through it;    To carry out his foolish plan    He never would be able;  He might as well go hang himself    With his Atlantic Cable.    But Cyrus was a valiant man,    A fellow of decision;  And heeded not their mocking words,    Their laughter and derision.    Twice did his bravest efforts fail,    And yet his mind was stable;  He wa'n't the man to break his heart    Because he broke his cable.    \"Once more, my gallant boys!\" he cried;    \"_Three times!_--you know the fable,--  (_I'll make it thirty_,\" muttered he,    \"But I will lay this cable!\")    Once more they tried--hurrah! hurrah!    What means this great commotion?  The Lord be praised! the cable's laid    Across the Atlantic Ocean.    Loud ring the bells,--for, flashing through    Six hundred leagues of water,  Old Mother England's benison    Salutes her eldest daughter.    O'er all the land the tidings speed,    And soon, in every nation,  They'll hear about the cable with    Profoundest admiration!           *       *       *       *       *    And may we honor evermore    The manly, bold, and stable;  And tell our sons, to make them brave,    How Cyrus laid the cable.        _John G.
