[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20552"],[0,"Roumanian Fairy Tales (#15)"],[1,"one  day a great hunt took place in the beautiful woods.    The emperor's son went to the chase too.    Well, evidently this ought to have been. The prince, in a good or evil  hour--I don't know which I ought to say--saw a deer bound into the  thicket, and hurried after the animal faster and faster and faster,  till the young hero found himself where he had never been even in his  dreams--in the very depths of the dense forest, which was still  untrodden by any human foot.    When the prince discovered his situation, he stood still and listened,  to try to hear some sound in this solitude; the barking of a dog, the  blast of a horn, the report of a gun, any thing of the sort would have  pleased the youth. But he listened in vain, utter silence and solitude  surrounded him. After gazing around him for some time a dazzling light  gleamed through the foliage. He glanced that way again, and felt that  he must know what was there. One, two, three, and he reached the spot  to see what it was. And he found--found the tree with the dainty  little swinging chamber, and the young griffins staring at him.  Whatever he may have thought, he drew his bow and would have instantly  shot off the heads of the whole brood, when, like a thunderbolt, a  blaze of light flashed into his face, dazzling him so that he dropped  the bow and covered his eyes with his hands. When he looked that way  again, he saw for half a minute the face and figure of little  Wild-Rose, felt as if he were in the other world, and could not help  falling on the grass in a fainting-fit. When he recovered his senses  he called to the young girl to come down. But how was Wild-Rose to do  such a thing? She did not go to a young man, but staid quietly at home  with her mamma.    When the prince saw this he went away as he had come. Yet no, not  exactly as he had come, for when he arrived his heart had not been  full of love and longing. Neither had he come through the bushes  without any trace of path or opening. But now he tumbled about  wherever he went, as though he had no eyes. Yet, however he returned,  he _did_ return, arriving just as the shepherds were driving their  cattle from the pasture into the village, and there he luckily met two  of his hunting companions.    Early the next morning heralds from the imperial court went through  the whole country, proclaiming that whoever would promise to bring a  wonder of a girl from the forest of the well with two trees, would be  received by the emperor as his councilor so long as he lived and the  whole court would do him honor. Lo, and behold! there came an old,  lame woman, with a hump on her back and as much hair on her head as  there is on the palm of the hand. \"I am the person who can bring the  girl from the forest of the well with the two trees,\" she said. The  heralds looked at the old woman and burst out laughing.    \"Are you from Satan's kingdom, you scare-crow?\" said a herald. \"Who,  in the Wood Witch's name, brought you in our way, for now we shall  have no luck. Begone from our sight.\"    But the old woman insisted that she could bring the girl from the  forest. And she stuck to the heralds like a bur to a sheep.    Then the oldest herald said: \"Comrades, take her with us, for the  emperor said plainly that we were to bring to the court any person, no  matter who, that boasted of being able to execute his command; take  the old woman and put her in the carriage.\"    So they took the old woman and carried her to court.    \"You have boasted that you could bring the girl from the forest?\"  asked the emperor, seated on his throne.    \"Long life to your majesty. Yes, I promised to do so.\"    \"Then set to work.\"    \"Let that be the old woman's care, but give me a kettle and a tripod.\"  She quickly received them and set off behind the emperor's huntsmen,  her mouth chattering and the kettle rattling, as the gipsies do when  they bring a bride to her wedding. The prince had not remained at  home either. How could he have staid behind and not known the why and  wherefore! When the party reached the forest, the hunters and the  prince halted and the old woman went on, like the Wood Witch, alone.    The shrewd, cunning old woman lighted a fire under the tree where the  girl was, placed the tripod over the flames, and hung the kettle on  it. But the kettle stood awry and upset as fast as she put it on.  Little Wild-Rose, who was looking down from her room and saw the old  woman's stupidity, lost her patience and called:    \"Not that way, old woman, set the tripod the other way.\"    \"But suppose I don't know how, my darling?\"    And she vainly set it up, turned it round, and straightened it, the  kettle would not stand. Wild-Rose grew more and more impatient and  angry.    \"Haven't I already told you once that it won't stand so? Turn the  handle of the kettle toward the trunk of the tree.\"    The old woman did exactly the opposite, and then said:    \"Come down and show me, dear child.\"    And Wild-Rose, absorbed by that one idea, climbed quickly down the  tree to teach the crone. But the old woman taught her so that she  needed no second lesson. Seizing her by the arm, she lifted her on her  shoulder and ran off with her to the enamored prince. When the prince  saw Wild-Rose, he came to meet her, begged for her hand, and,  trembling, kissed her. Then she was clothed in magnificent garments,  which had been embroidered with gold and pearls by nine princesses.    She was placed in the imperial carriage, and the horses stopped only  once on the way home to take breath, for they had no equals except  among the steeds of the sun. When they reached the palace, the prince  lifted her out, led her in, and seated her at the table as if she were  a real princess. The young hero's parents gazed at her with delight,  and remembered their own youth. At the end of a week a magnificent  wedding was celebrated, which lasted for three days and three nights,  then, after twenty-four hours' intermission, three days and three  nights more were spent in splendid festivities.    I was there, too, but as I am lame in one foot, I did not arrive until  the wedding was over and had great trouble in finding some clear  broth, which I searched in vain for a crumb of meat and then sipped  from a sieve, so you can imagine how much I had and how I spent the  time.          The Voice of Death.      Once upon a time something happened. If it had not happened, it would  not be told.    There was once a man who prayed daily to God to grant him riches. One  day his numerous and frequent prayers found our Lord in the mood to  listen to them. When the man had grown rich he did not want to die, so  he resolved to go from country to country and settle wherever he heard  that the people lived forever. He prepared for his journey, told his  wife his plan, and set off.    In every country he reached he asked whether people ever died there,  and went on at once if he was told that they did. At last he arrived  in a land where the inhabitants said they did not know what dying  meant. The traveler, full of joy, asked:    \"But are there not immense crowds of people here, if none of you die?\"    \"No, there are no immense crowds,\" was the reply, \"for you see, every  now and then somebody comes and calls one after another, and whoever  follows him, never returns.\"    \"And do people see the person who calls them?\" asked the traveler.    \"Why shouldn't they see him?\" he was answered.    The man could not wonder enough at the stupidity of those who followed  the person that called them, though they knew that they would be  obliged to stay where he took them. Returning home, he collected all  his property, and with his wife and children, went to settle in the  country where people did not die but were called by a certain person  and never came back. He had therefore firmly resolved that neither he  nor his family would ever follow any body who called them, no matter  who it might be.    So, after he had established himself and arranged all his business  affairs, he advised his wife and all his family on no account to  follow any one who might call them, if, as he said, they did not want  to die.    So they gave themselves up to pleasure, and in this way spent several  years. One day, when they were all sitting comfortably in their house,  his wife suddenly began to call:    \"I'm coming, I'm coming!\"    And she looked around the room for her fur jacket. Her husband  instantly started up, seized her by the hand, and began to reproach  her.    \"So you don't heed my advice? Stay here, if you don't want to die.\"    \"Don't you hear how he is calling me? I'll only see what he wants and  come back at once.\"    And she struggled to escape from her husband's grasp and go.    He held her fast and managed to bolt all the doors in the room. When  she saw that, she said:    \"Let me alone, husband, I don't care about going now.\"    The man thought she had come to her senses and given up her crazy  idea, but before long the wife rushed to the nearest door, hurriedly  opened it, and ran out. Her husband followed, holding her by her fur  sack and entreating her not to go, for she would never return. She let  her hands fall, bent backward, then leaned a little forward and  suddenly threw herself back, slipping off her sack and leaving it in  her husband's grasp, who stood stock still staring after her as she  rushed on, screaming with all her might:    \"I'm coming, I'm coming.\"    When he could see her no longer, the husband collected his senses,  went back to the house, and said:    \"If you are mad and want to die, go in God's name, I can't help you;  I've told you often enough that you must follow no one, no matter who  called you.\"    Days passed, many days; weeks, months, years followed, and the peace  of the man's household was not disturbed again.    But at last one morning, when he went to his barber's as usual to be  shaved, just as he had the soap on his chin, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20556"],[0,"Lamarck, the Founder of Evolution (#15)"],[1," J. Mueller    another.\" (_Life and Letters of Thomas Henry Huxley_, ii., p. 42,    1900.)    The memory of Lamarck is deeply and warmly cherished throughout France.  He gave his country a second Linne. One of the leading botanists in  Europe, and the greatest zooelogist of his time, he now shares equally  with Geoffroy St. Hilaire and with Cuvier the distinction of raising  biological science to that eminence in the first third of the nineteenth  century which placed France, as the mother of biologists, in the van of  all the nations. When we add to his triumphs in pure zooelogy the fact  that he was in his time the philosopher of biology, it is not going too  far to crown him as one of the intellectual glories, not only of France,  but of the civilized world.    How warmly his memory is now cherished may be appreciated by the perusal  of the following letter, with its delightful reminiscences, for which we  are indebted to the venerable and distinguished zooelogist and  comparative anatomist who formerly occupied the chair made illustrious  by Lamarck, and by his successor, De Blainville, and who founded the  Laboratoire Arago on the Mediterranean, also that of Experimental  Zooelogy at Roscoff, and who still conducts the _Journal de Zoologie  Experimentale_.        PARIS LE 28 _Decembre_, 1899.      M. le PROFESSEUR PACKARD.      _Cher Monsieur_: Vous m'avez fait l'honneur de me demander des    renseignements sur la famille de De Lamarck, et sur ses relations,    afin de vous en servir dans la biographie que vous preparez de    notre grand naturaliste.      Je n'ai rien appris de plus que ce que vous voulez bien me rappeler    comme l'ayant trouve dans mon adresse de 1889. Je ne connais plus ni    les noms ni les adresses des parents de De Lamarck, et c'est avec    regret qu'il ne m'est pas possible de repondre a vos desirs.      Lorsque je commencai mes etudes a Paris, on ne s'occupait guere des    idees generales de De Lamarck que pour s'en moquer. Excepte Geoffroy    St. Hilaire et De Blainville, dont j'ai pu suivre les belles lecons    et qui le citaient souvent, on parlait peu de la philosophie    zoologique.      Il m'a ete possible de causer avec des anciens collegues du grand    naturaliste; au Jardin des Plantes de tres grands savants, dont je    ne veux pas ecrire le nom, le traitaient _de fou_!      Il avait loue un appartement sur le haut d'une maison, et la    cherchait d'apres la direction des nuages a prevoir l'etat du temps.      On riait de ces etudes. N'est-ce pas comme un observatoire de    meteorologie que ce savant zoologiste avait pour ainsi dire fonde    avant que la science ne se fut emparee de l'idee?      Lorsque j'eus l'honneur d'etre nomme professeur au Jardin des    Plantes en 1865, je fis l'historique de la chaire que j'occupais, et    qui avait ete illustree par De Lamarck et De Blainville. Je crois    que je suis le premier a avoir fait l'histoire de notre grand    naturaliste dans un cours public. Je dus travailler pas mal pour    arriver a bien saisir l'idee fondamentale de la philosophie. Les    definitions de la nature et des forces qui president aux changements    qui modifient les etres d'apres les conditions auxquelles ils sont    soumis ne sont pas toujours faciles a rendre claires pour un public    souvent difficile.      Ce qui frappe surtout dans ses raisonnements, c'est que De Lamarck    est parfaitement logique. Il comprend tres bien ce que plus d'un    transformiste de nos jours ne cherche pas a eclairer, que le premier    pas, le pas difficile a faire pour arriver a expliquer la creation    par des modifications successives, c'est le passage de la matiere    inorganique a la matiere organisee, et il imagine la chaleur et    l'electricite comme etant les deux facteurs qui par attraction ou    repulsion finissent par former ces petits amas organises qui seront    le point de depart de toutes les transformations de tous les    organismes.      Voila le point de depart--la generation spontanee se trouve ainsi    expliquee!      De Lamarck etait un grand et profond observateur. On me disait au    Museum (des contemporains) qu'il avait l'Instinct de l'Espece. Il y    aurait beaucoup a dire sur cette expression--l'instinct de    l'espece--il m'est difficile dans une simple lettre de developper    des idees philosophiques que j'ai sur cette question,--laquelle    suppose la notion de l'individu parfaitement definie et acquis.      Je ne vous citerai qu'un exemple. Je ne l'ai vu signale nulle part    dans les ouvrages anciens sur De Lamarck.      Qu'etaient nos connaissances a l'epoque de De Lamarck sur les    Polypiers? Les Hydraires etaient loin d'avoir fourni les    remarquables observations qui parurent dans le milieu a peu pres du    siecle qui vient de finir, et cependant De Lamarck deplace hardiment    la Lucernaire--l'eloigne des Coralliaires, et la rapproche des etres    qui forment le grand groupe des Hydraires. Ce trait me parait    remarquable et le rapporte a cette reputation qu'il avait au Museum    de jouir de l'instinct de l'espece.      De toute part on acclame le grand naturaliste, et'il n'y a pas meme    une rue portant son nom aux environs du Jardin des Plantes? J'ai eu    beau reclamer le conseil municipal de Paris a d'autres favoris que    De Lamarck.      Lorsque le Jardin des Plantes fut reorganise par la Convention, De    Lamarck avait 50 ans. Il ne s'etait jusqu'alors occupe que de    botanique. Il fut a cet age charge de l'histoire de la partie du    regne animal renfermant les animaux invertebres sauf les Insectes et    les Crustaces. La chaire est restee la meme; elle comprend les vers,    les helminthes, les mollusques, et ce qu'on appelait autrefois les    Zoophytes ou Rayonnees, enfin les Infusoires. Quelle puissance de    travail! Ne fallait-il pas pour passer de la Botanique, a 50 ans, a    la Zoologie, et laisser un ouvrage semblable a celui qui illustre    encore le nom du Botaniste devenue Zoologiste par ordre de la    Convention!      Sans doute dans cet ouvrage il y a bien des choses qui ne sont plus    acceptables--mais pour le juger avec equite, il faut se porter a    l'epoque ou il fut fait, et alors on est pris d'admiration pour    l'auteur d'un aussi immense travail.      J'ai une grande admiration pour le genie de De Lamarck, et je ne    puis que vous louer de le faire encore mieux connaitre de nos    contemporains.      Recevez, mon cher collegue, l'expression de mes sentiments d'estime    pour vos travaux remarquables et croyez-moi--tout a vous,      H. DE LACAZE DUTHIERS.      FOOTNOTES:    [50] For example, while Cuvier's chair was in the field of vertebrate  zooelogy, owing to the kindness of Lamarck (\"_par gracieusete de la part  de M. de Lamarck_\") he had retained that of Mollusca, and yet it was in  the special classification of the molluscs that Lamarck did his best  work (Blainville, _l. c._, p. 116).    [51] De Blainville states that \"the Academy did not even allow it to be  printed in the form in which it was pronounced\" (p. 324); and again he  speaks of the lack of judgment in Cuvier's estimate of Lamarck, \"the  naturalist who had the greatest force in the general conception of  beings and of phenomena, although he might often be far from the path\"  (p. 323).

CHAPTER VII    LAMARCK'S WORK IN METEOROLOGY AND PHYSICAL SCIENCE      When a medical student in Paris, Lamarck, from day to day watching the  clouds from his attic windows, became much interested in meteorology,  and, indeed, at first this subject had nearly as much attraction for him  as botany. For a long period he pursued these studies, and he was the  first one to foretell the probabilities of the weather, thus  anticipating by over half a century the modern idea of making the  science of meteorology of practical use to mankind.    His article, \"De l'influence de la lune sur l'atmosphere terrestre,\"  appeared in the _Journal de Physique_ for 1798, and was translated in  two English journals. The titles of several other essays will be found  in the Bibliography at the close of this volume.    From 1799 to 1810 he regularly published an annual meteorological report  containing the statement of probabilities acquired by a long series of  observations on the state of the weather and the variations of the  atmosphere at different times of the year, giving indications of the  periods when to expect pleasant weather, or rain, storms, tempests,  frosts, thaws, etc.; finally the citations of these probabilities of  times favorable to fetes, journeys, voyages, harvesting crops, and  other enterprises dependent on good weather.    Lamarck thus explained the principles on which he based his  probabilities: Two kinds of causes, he says, displace the fluids which  compose the atmosphere, some being variable and irregular, others  constant, whose action is subject to progressive and fixed laws.    Between the tropics constant causes exercise an action so considerable  that the irregular effects of variable causes are there in some degree  lost; hence result the prevailing winds which in these climates become  established and change at determinate epochs.    Beyond the tropics, and especially toward the middle of the temperate  zones, variable causes predominate. We can, however, still discover  there the effects of the action of constant causes, though much  weakened; we can assign them the principal epochs, and in a great number  of cases make this knowledge turn to our "]]]
