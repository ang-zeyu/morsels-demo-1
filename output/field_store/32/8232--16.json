Here grow  small woods and thickets where tigers stalk their prey, and in the dense  reed beds wild boars dig up roots. The shy gazelles like the open  country, hares spring over the shrubs, ducks and geese quack on the  banks, and flocks of pheasants lure the traveller to sport. The setting  sun sheds a gleam of fiery red over the steppe, and as it grows dim the  stars begin to twinkle. The monotonous ring of the bells and the shouts  of the driver never cease, whether we are near the river or far off in  the dreary steppe. The ground becomes soft and swampy. The wheels cut  like knives into the mud. We move more and more slowly and heavily, and  at last stick fast in the mire. The driver shouts and scolds, and cracks  his whip over the team. The middle horse rears, one of the outside  horses jibs and the other gathers himself together for a spring which  makes the traces break with a loud report. Then the driver jumps down  and says, \"You must wait here, sir, while I ride back for two more  horses.\" And he trots off in the darkness. After waiting about two hours  I hear the tramp of horses in the distance. Now the team is made ready,  the two extra horses are attached in front, the coachman takes his place  on the box, and with united strength our animals drag the heavy vehicle  up out of the slough. We roll and jolt on again with lumps of wet clay  dropping and splashing round the wheels.      SAMARCAND AND BUKHARA    Russian Central Asia has ten million inhabitants and an area twelve  times as large as the British Isles. The part which is called Turkestan  extends between Eastern Turkestan and the Caspian Sea, the Kirghiz  Steppe, Afghanistan, and Persia. The greater part is occupied by blown  sand, the \"Red Sand\" and the \"Black Sand.\" Right through the desert flow  the two rivers, the Syr-darya and Amu-darya. Two railway lines cross  Turkestan, one from the Kirghiz Steppe to Tashkent, the other from the  Caspian Sea to Tashkent and Ferghana. Ferghana is the most fruitful part  of Turkestan and lies between mountains in its eastern portion.    Tashkent, the capital of Turkestan, has 200,000 inhabitants, and is the  headquarters of the governor-general. South-west of Tashkent is the  district of Samarcand, with a capital of the same name. South-west of  Samarcand again, on the north of the Amu-darya, stretches a country  called Bukhara, ruled by an Emir, a prince under the supremacy of  Russia.    Close to the Caspian Sea, on the east, there is a large area of country  called Transcaspia. Central Asia was conquered by Russia forty-five  years ago, Transcaspia thirty years ago. Transcaspia is inhabited by  Turkomans, a powerful and warlike people, who in former times used to  make raids into northern Persia, carrying off men and women, whom they  sold as slaves in the markets of Bukhara and Samarcand. General  Skobeleff put a check to their domination when he invaded the country in  1880. In order to convey troops and war material into the country a  railway was laid down through the desert. It runs from one oasis to  another, and hardy desert shrubs were planted or upright palings erected  to protect the line from the drifting sand.    When the Turkomans were attacked by the Russians, they withdrew within  the walls of the large fortress which is called \"The Green Hill.\" They  numbered about 45,000 in all--men, women and children--and they  believed that the fortress was impregnable. The Russian general,  Skobeleff, had a mine carried under the wall. Inside the fortress the  Turkomans heard the soldiers working underground with picks and  crowbars, but did not understand what was intended. They supposed that  the soldiers would crawl up out of a hole one after another and  therefore they assembled with shining weapons above the place of danger.  Consequently when the mine exploded a large number of unfortunates were  killed, and the enemy stormed in over the ruins of the wall.    A fearful massacre followed of all those who did not seek safety in  flight. The Persian slaves and some thousands of women were spared.  Twenty thousand bodies lay in heaps within and without the fortress. The  Turkomans will never forget that day. The cavalry band played at the  head of the columns during the fight. Old Turkomans still remember the  strains. They cannot hear regimental bands without weeping for some  relative who fell at \"The Green Hill.\" Here was the death-bed of their  freedom and they were swallowed up by mighty Russia.    I have crossed Turkestan many times by rail, in _tarantass_, and on  horseback. I have strolled for weeks through the narrow picturesque  streets and the gloomy bazaars of the old town called Bukhara, the  \"Blessed.\" There silk is produced and carpets are woven; great caravans  pass by laden with cotton; disfigured by sores, lepers sit begging in  front of the mosques; mulberry trees raise their crowns above artificial  ponds. From the summit of a tall minaret criminals used to be thrown  down to be dashed to pieces on the street.    Sixty years ago there ruled in Bukhara a cruel Emir who took a delight  in torturing human beings. A mechanician from Italy fell into his  clutches and was sentenced to death. The Italian promised that if his  life were spared he would construct a machine wherewith the Emir could  measure the flight of time. His prayer was granted and he made an  ordinary clock. This called forth the Emir's astonishment and  admiration, and the Italian lived in high favour for a time. Later on,  however, the tyrant wished to force him to embrace Islamism, but he  steadfastly refused. At that time there was in Bukhara a cave called  \"the bugs' hole,\" and into this the unfortunate man was thrown to be  eaten up by vermin. Seventy years ago two Englishmen languished in this  abominable place.    There are towns in Asia with names which impress us as soon as we hear  them, like Jerusalem, Mecca, Benares, Lhasa. Samarcand is one of these.  It is not a place of pilgrimage, but it is an ancient town and famous  among the Mohammedans of Asia. It was already in existence when  Alexander the Great conquered Central Asia. Since then vast swarms of  men and migrations of peoples have swept over this region. The Arabs  have subdued it, countless hordes of Mongols have passed through it  pillaging and devastating, and now at last it lies under the sceptre of  the Tsar. Samarcand attained the height of its splendour during the rule  of the powerful Timur. When he died in the year 1405 he had conquered  all Central Asia, Persia, Mesopotamia, South Russia, Turkey, India and  many other countries. This Timur the Lame was not only a great general  but a man of culture, for he loved art and science, and listened  willingly to the songs of the poets. He built his own mausoleum, which  still rears its melon-shaped dome above Samarcand, and had carved in  raised letters on a marble tablet the words: \"If I still lived, mankind  would tremble.\"    Timur had a wife, Bibi, whom he dearly loved. She expressed a wish that  her coffin should not be buried but should remain above ground, and  therefore Timur caused to be erected the handsome mosque-tomb which  still bears her name. When it was finished the Queen went, attended by  her slaves, to inspect her last resting-place. A poisonous snake crept  from under an arch. Those present wished to kill it, but the Queen  forbade them and caressed the snake, which offered her no harm. When at  length she died she was decked with all her jewels--costly pearls,  necklaces, and gold bangles--and her coffin was placed in the vault. One  night thieves broke into the tomb, opened the coffin and took all the  Queen's ornaments; but when they were sneaking off with their booty the  snake crept out and bit them so that they died immediately.    The great market-place of Samarcand is one of the finest squares I have  seen in Asia. There carts and caravans swarm, there fruit sellers and  pitcher-makers take their stand, there dancing dervishes beg for alms.  On all four sides stand stately buildings erected by Timur and his  successors. Their facades, cupolas and minarets are covered with blue  faience, burned and glazed tiles in varied patterns and texts from the  holy book of Islam, the Koran. It is worth while to ascend one of the  lofty minarets to take a look over Samarcand. Hence we see innumerable  gray mud houses with courts in the centre, pools, canals and gardens,  and in the maze of streets, squares and lanes moves a stream of people  of Turkish and Persian race. The dark-blue cupolas stand out against the  light-blue sky, and are surrounded by luxuriant dark-green vegetation.  In autumn the gardens assume a bright yellow tint. In winter the whole  country is often buried in snow, and only the bright blue cupolas rise  above the whiteness. Samarcand is the \"blue\" town, just as Jaipur in  India is the \"pink\" town.      THE PAMIR    To the south-east of Samarcand stand the huge highlands of the Pamir,  called by its inhabitants the \"Roof of the World,\" for it seems to them  to rise like a roof above all the rest of the earth. From this great  centre run the lofty mountain ranges of the earth, the Himalayas, the  Trans-himalaya, Karakorum, Kuen-lun, and the Tien-shan on the east, the  Hindu-Kush on the west. If you examine the map you will see that most of  the ranges of Asia and Europe, and the most important, are connected  with it. The Tibetan ranges extend far into China and beyond the Indian  peninsula. The Tien-shan is only the first link in a series of mountains  which stretch north-eastwards throughout Asia. The continuation of the  Hindu-Kush is found in the mountains of northern Persia, in the Caucasus  and the chains of Asia Minor, the Balkan Peninsula, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2071"],[0,"Stories (#15)"],[1,"was scarce a sound save the riot  of the winds down the passages as they tossed the creaking signs and  shook the tall lamp-irons.    So many passers-by had trodden through and through the snow, so many  diverse paths had crossed and recrossed each other, that the dog had a  hard task to retain any hold on the track he followed. But he kept on  his way, though the cold pierced him to the bone, and the jagged ice cut  his feet, and the hunger in his body gnawed like a rat's teeth. He kept  on his way,--a poor gaunt, shivering thing,--and by long patience traced  the steps he loved into the very heart of the burg and up to the steps  of the great cathedral.    \"He is gone to the things that he loved,\" thought Patrasche; he could  not understand, but he was full of sorrow and of pity for the art  passion that to him was so incomprehensible and yet so sacred.    The portals of the cathedral were unclosed after the midnight mass. Some  heedlessness in the custodians, too eager to go home and feast or sleep,  or too drowsy to know whether they turned the keys aright, had left one  of the doors unlocked. By that accident the footfalls Patrasche sought  had passed through into the building, leaving the white marks of snow  upon the dark stone floor. By that slender white thread, frozen as it  fell, he was guided through the intense silence, through the immensity  of the vaulted space--guided straight to the gates of the chancel,  and, stretched there upon the stones, he found Nello. He crept up,  and touched the face of the boy. \"Didst thou dream that I should be  faithless and forsake thee? I--a dog?\" said that mute caress.    The lad raised himself with a low cry and clasped him close. \"Let us lie  down and die together,\" he murmured. \"Men have no need of us, and we are  all alone.\"    In answer, Patrasche crept closer yet, and laid his head upon the young  boy's breast. The great tears stood in his brown, sad eyes; not for  himself--for himself he was happy.    They lay close together in the piercing cold. The blasts that blew over  the Flemish dikes from the northern seas were like waves of ice, which  froze every living thing they touched. The interior of the immense  vault of stone in which they were was even more bitterly chill than the  snow-covered plains without. Now and then a bat moved in the shadows;  now and then a gleam of light came on the ranks of carven figures. Under  the Rubens they lay together quite still, and soothed almost into a  dreaming slumber by the numbing narcotic of the cold. Together they  dreamed of the old glad days when they had chased each other through  the flowering grasses of the summer meadows, or sat hidden in the tall  bulrushes by the water's side, watching the boats go seaward in the sun.    Suddenly through the darkness a great white radiance streamed through  the vastness of the aisles; the moon, that was at her height, had broken  through the clouds; the snow had ceased to fall; the light reflected  from the snow without was clear as the light of dawn. It fell through  the arches full upon the two pictures above, from which the boy on his  entrance had flung back the veil: the \"Elevation\" and the \"Descent of  the Cross\" were for one instant visible.    Nello rose to his feet and stretched his arms to them; the tears of a  passionate ecstasy glistened on the paleness of his face. \"I have seen  them at last!\" he cried aloud. \"O God, it is enough!\"    His limbs failed under him, and he sank upon his knees, still gazing  upward at the majesty that he adored. For a few brief moments the light  illumined the divine visions that had been denied to him so long--light  clear and sweet and strong as though it streamed from the throne of  Heaven. Then suddenly it passed away; once more a great darkness covered  the face of Christ.    The arms of the boy drew close again the body of the dog. \"We shall see  His face--_there_,\" he murmured; \"and He will not part us, I think.\"    On the morrow, by the chancel of the cathedral, the people of Antwerp  found them both. They were both dead; the cold of the night had frozen  into stillness alike the young life and the old. When the Christmas  morning broke and the priests came to the temple, they saw them lying  thus on the stones together. Above, the veils were drawn back from the  great visions of Rubens, and the fresh rays of the sunrise touched the  thorn-crowned head of the Christ.    As the day grew on there came an old, hard-featured man who wept as  women weep. \"I was cruel to the lad,\" he muttered; \"and now I would have  made amends,--yea, to the half of my substance,--and he should have been  to me as a son.\"    There came also, as the day grew apace, a painter who had fame in the  world, and who was liberal of hand and of spirit. \"I seek one who should  have had the prize yesterday had worth won,\" he said to the people--\"a  boy of rare promise and genius. An old wood-cutter on a fallen tree at  eventide--that was all his theme; but there was greatness for the future  in it. I would fain find him, and take him with me and teach him art.\"    And a little child with curling fair hair, sobbing bitterly as she clung  to her father's arm, cried aloud, \"Oh, Nello, come! We have all ready  for thee. The Christ-child's hands are full of gifts, and the old piper  will play for us; and the mother says thou shalt stay by the hearth and  burn nuts with us all the Noel week long--yes, even to the Feast of the  Kings! And Patrasche will be so happy! Oh, Nello, wake and come!\"    But the young pale face, turned upward to the light of the great Rubens  with a smile upon its mouth, answered them all, \"It is too late.\"    For the sweet, sonorous bells went ringing through the frost, and the  sunlight shone upon the plains of snow, and the populace trooped gay and  glad through the streets, but Nello and Patrasche no more asked charity  at their hands. All they needed now Antwerp gave unbidden.    Death had been more pitiful to them than longer life would have been. It  had taken the one in the loyalty of love, and the other in the innocence  of faith, from a world which for love has no recompense and for faith no  fulfilment.    All their lives they had been together, and in their deaths they were  not divided; for when they were found the arms of the boy were folded  too closely around the dog to be severed without violence, and the  people of their little village, contrite and ashamed, implored a special  grace for them, and, making them one grave, laid them to rest there side  by side--forever!          MARKHEIM, by Robert Louis Stevenson      \"Yes,\" said the dealer, \"our windfalls are of various kinds. Some  customers are ignorant, and then I touch a dividend on my superior  knowledge. Some are dishonest,\" and here he held up the candle, so  that the light fell strongly on his visitor, \"and in that case,\" he  continued, \"I profit by my virtue.\"    Markheim had but just entered from the daylight streets, and his eyes  had not yet grown familiar with the mingled shine and darkness in the  shop. At these pointed words, and before the near presence of the flame,  he blinked painfully and looked aside.    The dealer chuckled. \"You come to me on Christmas Day,\" he resumed,  \"when you know that I am alone in my house, put up my shutters, and make  a point of refusing business. Well, you will have to pay for that; you  will have to pay for my loss of time, when I should be balancing my  books; you will have to pay, besides, for a kind of manner that I remark  in you to-day very strongly. I am the essence of discretion, and ask no  awkward questions; but when a customer cannot look me in the eye, he has  to pay for it.\" The dealer once more chuckled; and then, changing to his  usual business voice, though still with a note of irony, \"You can give,  as usual, a clear account of how you came into the possession of  the object?\" he continued. \"Still your uncle's cabinet? A remarkable  collector, sir!\"    And the little pale, round-shouldered dealer stood almost on tip-toe,  looking over the top of his gold spectacles, and nodding his head with  every mark of disbelief. Markheim returned his gaze with one of infinite  pity, and a touch of horror.    \"This time,\" said he, \"you are in error. I have not come to sell, but to  buy. I have no curios to dispose of; my uncle's cabinet is bare to  the wainscot; even were it still intact, I have done well on the Stock  Exchange, and should more likely add to it than otherwise, and my errand  to-day is simplicity itself. I seek a Christmas present for a lady,\"  he continued, waxing more fluent as he struck into the speech he had  prepared; \"and certainly I owe you every excuse for thus disturbing you  upon so small a matter. But the thing was neglected yesterday; I must  produce my little compliment at dinner; and, as you very well know, a  rich marriage is not a thing to be neglected.\"    There followed a pause, during which the dealer seemed to weigh this  statement incredulously. The ticking of many clocks among the curious  lumber of the shop, and the faint rushing of the cabs in a near  thoroughfare, filled up the interval of silence.    \"Well, sir,\" said the dealer, \"be it so. You are an old customer after  all; and if, as you say, you have the chance of a good marriage, far be  it from me to be an obstacle. Here is a nice thing for a lady now,\" he  went on, \"this hand-glass--fifteenth century, warranted; comes from a  good collection, too; but I reserve the name, in the interests of my  customer, who was just like yourself, my dear sir, the nephew and sole  heir of a remarkable collector.\"    The dealer, while he thus ran on in his dry and biting voice, had  stooped to take the object from its place; and, as he had done so, a  shock had passed through Markheim, a start both of hand and foot,  a sudden leap of many tumultuous passions to the face. It passed as  swiftly as it came, and left no trace beyond a "]]]
