These are, in the  main, very similar throughout the Bagobo belt, but to avoid confusion  the description here given of the two greatest events of the year--the  _GinEm_ ceremony and the human sacrifice--deals with Cibolan, unless  expressly stated to the contrary.    The greatest of all Bagobo ceremonies--the _GinEm_--may be given by the  _datu_ within three or four months after the appearance of the  constellation _Balatik_, when the moon is new or full. Its object is to  thank the spirits for success in war or domestic affairs, to ward off  sickness and other dangers, to drive away the _buso_, and finally to so  gratify the spirits that they will be pleased to increase the wealth of  all the people. Datu Tongkaling expressed a belief that this ceremony is  in a way related to the rice harvest, \"for it is always made when there  is plenty of rice in the granaries.\" It appears to the writer, however,  that this ceremony probably originated in connection with warfare.    According to the tales of the old men, it was formerly the custom to go  on a raid before this ceremony was to take place, and successful  warriors would bring home with them the skulls of their victims which  they tied to the _patan'nan_.[46] It seems also to have been closely  associated with the yearly sacrifice, for it was never made until after  the appearance of the constellation _Balatik_, and without doubt a  sacrifice frequently did take place during the first day of the  ceremony, at the time the decorated poles were raised. However, such an  offering at this time did not relieve the _datu_ from the obligation of  making the regular sacrifice.    [46] Ceremonial poles dedicated to Mandarangan and Darago. In Digos and  Bansalan the skulls were not taken but hair cut from the heads of  enemies was placed in the swinging altar _balakat_, and were left there  until the conclusion of the ceremony.    Datu Ansig of Talun informed me that, unless the death of some great  person made a special sacrifice necessary, there was only one such  offering made during the year, and that at the time the decorated poles  were placed in the dwelling.    The time for the festival having been agreed upon, messengers are sent  to other _datu_ and head-men, inviting them and their people to attend.  Sufficient food is prepared for the guests and when all is ready the  _mabalian_ takes one chicken from among those to be used for food and  frees it as an offering to the _gimokod_. It is bidden to wander about  in the forest, and no one will molest the fowl, for should he do so he  is certain to become ill.[47] The _mabalian_ has previously placed  festoons of leaves and vines at various points in the house and now she  spreads a mat on the floor. A jar of _balaba_, wine, stands at each  corner, while at one end is an _agong_, and a plate containing betel  nut, leaf, and two varieties of rattan; at the other end are several  _tambara_. When all is thus prepared the people place offerings of  beautiful clothing, knives, and other costly gifts on the mat. Two  _mabalian_, a man and a woman call upon the spirits,[48] urging them to  look with favor on the offering made by the people, to grant them a good  year with health and plentiful harvests, to let their journeys be  without mishap, and to keep them all under their constant care. The  _tambara_ are fastened in various parts of the house, and the gifts are  hung on or laid beside them. Later these offerings may be removed by  their former owners who now regard them as being loaned to them by the  spirits.    [47] This offering is not made at Bansalan, neither has the _mabalian_  any part in the ceremonies of the first day.    [48] Those called at this time are Toglai, Toglibon, _tigyma_, and  Kalayagan--Eugpamolak Manobo.    [Transcriber's note: The word _tigyma_ in the above footnote should be  spelled _tigyama_.]    Following the offering the _magani_ go to a bamboo thicket and cut two  large poles, one nine sections long, the other eight. With each stroke  of the knife the men give their battle cry, then when the poles are  felled, all seize hold and carry them to the house of the _datu_. Here  they are decorated, first by being cut down for short distances, thus  leaving the lower part attached so that the shavings make a sort of  fringe, and then by attaching strips of palm or bamboo leaves and cloth  or palm leaf streamers. When complete these poles are known as  _patan'nan_ and are then the property of the spirits Mandanagan and  Darago. The longer one is for the male spirit, while the one of eight  sections is for his wife. Under no circumstances may anyone not a  _magani_ touch these poles. They are carried into the house and are  fastened near to the elevated platform at the end of the room where the  _datu_ or leading _magani_ stands ready to sacrifice a chicken. He  allows some of the blood from the offering to drip onto the poles, at  the same time begging the spirits not to let the people fight or quarrel  during the _GinEm_, \"for blood is now being offered.\" In at least two  recent offerings the _datu_ urged the spirits to be content with this  offering of a fowl, since it was impossible for them to kill a man. At  this time, it is said, the skulls of enemies should be attached to the  _patan'nan_. As the leader finishes his offering, the men and boys  gather about the poles and yell lustily, then sit quietly down and amuse  themselves by chewing betel nut until the chicken, just killed, and the  other food has been prepared for eating. Old dishes are placed in the  center of the floor and in them food is offered for all the spirits, but  in the exact center of all is a large plate of white food for the  supreme being. A second large dish of food is placed in a _tambara_ at  the corner of the room as an offering to the warrior deities \"so that  they will not eat anyone during the fiesta.\" Again the spirits are  besought to give them a good year, with abundant crops, health, and  success in war. Going to the _patan'nan_ each _magani_, beginning with  the _datu_ or his son, takes hold of the poles, and in a loud voice,  begins to confess all his warlike deeds. He relates how and when he  killed his victims, the number of sacrifices he has participated in, the  towns he has sacked and the slaves he has captured. In short, he tells  of all the manly deeds he has performed in order to gain the right to  wear his red suit and be known as _magani_. When all have confessed, the  men and boys eat the chicken which was sacrificed before the poles, and  from then until near midnight, all the people may dance to the music of  the _agongs_ or may indulge in feasting and drinking. From the middle of  the night until daybreak they chant songs or poems, many words of which  are now obsolete so that they are not fully understood.[49]    [49] Mr. Gohn informs me that at midnight during the last _GinEm_ made  by Datu Ali in Santa Cruz, a gun was fired, and the _datu_ said that a  sacrifice should have taken place at that time.    The festival may last one or more days. The last held in Cibolan (1909)  extended through two days and nights. At that time no offerings were  made to the spirits on the second day, but the people feasted and drank  while the _datu_ gathered a little apart and held a council.    In Malilla the second day of this ceremony is called _EgbikbEgaybe_ and  is given over almost entirely to the women. Two _tambara_ are erected in  the house, and young betel nut buds and women's skirts are hung on them.  The women and some men form a line and dance in a circle around the  offerings, keeping time to music furnished by beating small gongs, or by  pounding on a board resting on a rice mortar.[50] Before each dance the  _mabalian_ informs a spirit that this dance is for him and it is  customary to add a gift of some kind to those already on the _tambara_.  Sixteen spirits are thus honored. Throughout the day there is much  feasting and drinking, and at some time before sunset the women are  baptized. Having filled an old agong with water, the _mabalian_ dips  certain leaves into it and sprinkles the heads of the women present  eight times, meanwhile bidding the spirits to grant to them a good mind  and habit.    [50] See p. 110, note. [Transcriber's note: back 3 pages, the footnote  beginning, \"An instrument made by placing....\"]    Mr. Gohn, a planter of Santa Cruz who has witnessed a number of these  ceremonies, says that with the Bagobo of that place it was customary for  the _datu_ to baptize the women prior to the day of _GinEm_. On the  second day, a _mabalian_ provided a long palm leaf, and a number of  betel nut buds which, she said, represented streams, rivers, tribes, and  individuals. Taking up a bud she swung the palm leaf above it, chanting  meanwhile, and, as she finished, handed it to the _datu_ who opened it  and read the signs sent by the spirits. At the conclusion of this act,  all the women went to the river to bathe.    In the writings of the early missionary fathers stationed among the  Bagobo are found many references to human sacrifices. Since American  occupation several articles have appeared describing this custom, and  following the sacrifice held in Talun in 1907, this practice became the  subject of official communication between the Governor of the District  and his superiors. While these descriptions agree, in the main, there  are so many minor variations that it seems best to first relate the  account given to the writer by Datu Tongkaling and ten of his _magani_,  after which we shall take up some of the earlier accounts, and the  official correspondence of 1907.    Datu Tongkaling is a _magani_. He claims to have killed more than thirty  of his enemies in fair fight and to have assisted in, or to have  witnessed, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18274"],[0,"A Book of Natural History (#15)"],[1,"smaller streams, probably returning in midsummer  to deeper water. Thoreau, who studied their habits closely, says of  them: \"They are rarely seen on their way down stream, and it is  thought by fishermen that they never return, but waste away and die,  clinging to rocks and stumps of trees for an indefinite period; a  tragic feature to the scenery of the river bottoms worthy to be  remembered with Shakespeare's description of the sea floor.\"    [Illustration: A LAMPREY.]    A few of the fishes, as the mud minnow and smaller catfishes,  together with most frogs, turtles, and salamanders, on the approach of  winter, burrow into the mud at the bottom of the streams and ponds, or  beneath logs near their margins. There they live without moving about  and with all the vital processes in a partially dormant condition,  thus needing little if any food.    The box tortoise or \"dry land terrapin,\" the common toad, and some  salamanders burrow into the dry earth, usually going deep enough to  escape frost; while snakes seek some crevice in the rocks or hole in  the ground where they coil themselves together, oftentimes in vast  numbers, and prepare for their winter's sleep. In an open winter this  hibernation is often interrupted, the animal emerging from its retreat  and seeking its usual summer haunts as though spring had come again.  Thus I have, on one occasion, seen a soft-shelled turtle moving  gracefully over the bottom of a stream on a day in late December, and  have in mid-January captured snakes and salamanders from beneath a  pile of drift-wood, where they had taken temporary refuge.    [Illustration: TURTLE.]    With frogs, especially, this hibernation is not a perfect one, and  there is a doubt if in a mild winter some species hibernate at all.  For example, the little cricket frog or \"peeper\" has been seen many  times in mid-winter alongside the banks of flowing streams, and during  the open winter of 1888-89 numerous specimens of leopard and green  frogs were seen on different occasions in December and January, while  on February 18th they, together with the \"peepers,\" were in full  chorus.    Of our mammals, a few of the rodents or gnawers, as the ground-hogs,  gophers and chipmunks, hibernate in burrows deep enough to escape the  cold, and either feed on a stored supply of food, or, like the snakes  and crayfish, do not feed at all.    [Illustration: CHIPMUNK.]    Others, as the rabbits, field-mice, and squirrels, are more or less  active and forage freely on whatever they can find, eating many things  which in summer they would spurn with scorn. To this class belongs  that intelligent but injurious animal the musquash or muskrat. Those  which inhabit the rivers and larger streams live in burrows dug deep  beneath the banks, but those inhabiting sluggish streams and ponds  usually construct a conical winter house about three feet in diameter  and from two to three feet in height. These houses are made of coarse  grasses, rushes, branches of shrubs, and small pieces of driftwood,  closely cemented together with stiff, clayey mud. The top of the house  usually projects two feet or more above the water, and when sun-dried  is so strong as to easily sustain the weight of a man. The walls are  generally about six inches in thickness and are very difficult to pull  to pieces. Within is a single circular chamber with a shelf or floor  of mud, sticks, leaves and grass, ingeniously supported on coarse  sticks stuck endwise into the mud after the manner of piles. In the  centre of this floor is an opening, from which six or eight diverging  paths lead to the open water without, so that the little artisan has  many avenues of escape in case of danger. These houses are often  repaired and used for several winters in succession, but are vacated  on the approach of spring. During the summer the muskrat is, in the  main, a herbivorous animal, but in winter necessity develops its  carnivorous propensities and it feeds then mainly upon the mussels and  crayfish which it can dig from the bottom of the pond or stream in  which its house is built.    The bats pass the winter in caves, the attics of houses, and barns, or  in hollow trees, hanging downward by their hind claws. Motionless for  months they thus remain, and those in the more exposed situations are,  doubtless, frozen solid. Yet, in time, their blood flows freely once  again and they become as expert on the wing as though the year were  one continual jubilee of insect chasing, and frost and snow were to  them unknown.    All the carnivora, or flesh-eaters, as the mink, skunk, opossum, fox,  and wolf, are in winter active and voracious, needing much food to  supply the necessary animal heat of the body. Hence they are then much  more bold than in summer, and the hen yard or sheep pen of the farmer  is too frequently called upon to supply this extra demand.    [Illustration: A WOLF.]    But of all our animals it seems to me the birds have solved the winter  problem best. Possessing an enduring power of flight and a knowledge  of a southern sunny sky, beneath which food is plentiful, they alone  of all the living forms about us have little fear of the coming of the  frost. True, fifty or more species remain in each of the Northern  States during the cold season, but they are hardy birds which feed  mainly upon seeds, as the snow-bird and song sparrow; on flesh, as the  hawks and crows; or on burrowing insects, as the nut-hatches and  woodpeckers.    Such are some of the solutions to the problem of life in winter which  the plants and animals about us have worked out; such some of the  forms which they undergo; the places which they inhabit.    To the thinking mind a knowledge of these solutions but begets other  and greater problems, such as how can a living thing be frozen solid  for weeks and yet retain vitality enough to fully recover? How can a  warm-blooded animal sleep for months without partaking of food or  drink? And greater than either, what is that which we call life?    I hold in my hand two objects, similar in size, color, organs,  everything--twins from the same mother in all outward respects. One  pulsates and throbs with that which we call \"life.\" It possesses heat,  bodily motion, animal power. The other is cold, motionless, pulseless,  throbless--a thing of clay. What is that \"life\" which the one  possesses and the other lacks? Ah, there's the rub! With the wisest of  men we can only answer, \"_Quien sabe?_\" (Who knows?)    [Illustration: WINTER HOUSE OF MUSKRAT.]          BIRDS' NESTS    (FROM WAKE ROBIN.)[3]    BY JOHN BURROUGHS.    [3] Copyright by Houghton, Mifflin & Co.      [Illustration]    How alert and vigilant the birds are, even when absorbed in building  their nests! In an open space in the woods, I see a pair of  cedar-birds collecting moss from the top of a dead tree. Following the  direction in which they fly, I soon discover the nest placed in the  fork of a small soft-maple, which stands amid a thick growth of  wild-cherry trees and young beeches. Carefully concealing myself  beneath it, without any fear that the workmen will hit me with a chip  or let fall a tool, I await the return of the busy pair. Presently I  hear the well-known note, and the female sweeps down and settles  unsuspectingly into the half-finished structure. Hardly have her wings  rested, before her eye has penetrated my screen, and with a hurried  movement of alarm, she darts away. In a moment, the male, with a tuft  of wool in his beak (for there is a sheep pasture near), joins her,  and the two reconnoitre the premises from the surrounding bushes. With  their beaks still loaded, they move around with a frightened look, and  refuse to approach the nest till I have moved off and lain down behind  a log. Then one of them ventures to alight upon the nest, but, still  suspecting all is not right, quickly darts away again. Then they both  together come, and after much peeping and spying about, and apparently  much anxious consultation, cautiously proceed to work. In less than  half an hour, it would seem that wool enough has been brought to  supply the whole family, real and prospective, with socks, if needles  and fingers could be found fine enough to knit it up. In less than a  week, the female has begun to deposit her eggs,--four of them in as  many days,--white tinged with purple, with black spots on the larger  end. After two weeks of incubation, the young are out.    Excepting the American goldfinch, this bird builds later in the spring  than any other, its nest, in our northern climate, seldom being  undertaken till July. As with the goldfinch, the reason is, probably,  that suitable food for the young cannot be had at an earlier period.    Like most of our common species, as the robin, sparrow, bluebird,  pewee, wren, etc., this bird sometimes seeks wild, remote localities  in which to rear its young; at others, takes up its abode near that of  man. I knew a pair of cedar-birds, one season, to build in an  apple-tree, the branches of which rubbed against the house. For a day  or two before the first straw was laid, I noticed the pair carefully  exploring every branch of the tree the female taking the lead, the  male following her with an anxious note and look. It was evident that  the wife was to have her choice this time; and, like one who  thoroughly knew her mind, she was proceeding to take it. Finally the  site was chosen upon a high branch extending over one low wing of the  house. Mutual congratulations and caresses followed, when both birds  flew away in quest of building material. That most freely used is a  sort of cotton-bearing plant, which grows in old, worn-out fields. The  nest is large for the size of the bird, and very soft. It is in every  respect a first-class domicile.    On another occasion, while walking, or rather sauntering, in the woods  (for I have discovered that one cannot run and read the book of  nature), my attention was"]]]
