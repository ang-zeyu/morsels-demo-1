Black snake root was a good cure for  childbed fever, and it saved the life of my second wife after her last  child was born. Slippery ellum was used for poultices to heal burns,  bruises, and any abrasions, and we gargled slippery ellum tea to heal  sore throats, but red oak bark tea was our best sore throat remedy. For  indigestion and shortness of the breath we chewed calamus root or drank  tea made from it. In fact, we still think it is mighty useful for those  purposes. It was a long time after the war before there were any darkies  with enough medical education to practice as doctors. Dr. Doyle in  Gainesville was the first colored physician that I ever saw.    \"The world seems to be gradually drifting the wrong way, and it won't  get any better 'til all people put their belief--and I mean by  that--simple faith, in the Bible. What they like of it they are in the  habit of quoting, but they distort it and try to make it appear to mean  whatever will suit their wicked convenience. They have got to take the  whole Bible and live by it, and they must remember they cannot leave out  those wise old laws of the Old Testament that God gave for men  everywhere to live by.\"    Laney had quietly left the room, but as the visitors were taking their  departure she returned with a small package. \"This,\" she explained, \"is  some calamus root that I raised and dried myself, and I hope it comes in  handy whenever you ladies need something for the indigestion.\"    \"Next time you come, I hope to have more songs remembered and written  down for you,\" promised John.          PLANTATION LIFE AS VIEWED BY AN EX-SLAVE    ADDIE VINSON, Age 86  653 Dearing Street  Athens, Georgia    Written By:  Mrs. Sadie B. Hornsby  Athens, Georgia    Edited By:  Mrs. Sarah H. Hall  Athens, Georgia    and  John N. Booth  WPA Residency No. 6 & 7    August 23, 1938      Perched on an embankment high above the street level is the four-room  frame cottage where Addie Vinson lives with her daughter. The visitor  scrambled up the steep incline to the vine covered porch, and a rap on  the front door brought prompt response. \"Who dat?\" asked a very black  woman, who suddenly appeared in the hall. \"What you want?... Yassum,  dis here's Addie, but dey calls me Mammy, 'cause I'se so old. I s'pects  I'se most nigh a hunnert and eight years old.\"    The old Negress is very short and stout. Her dark blue calico dress was  striped with lines of tiny polka dots, and had been lengthened by a band  of light blue outing flannel with a darker blue stripe, let in just  below the waist line. Her high-topped black shoes were worn over grey  cotton hose, and the stocking cap that partially concealed her white  hair was crowned by a panama hat that flopped down on all sides except  where the brim was fastened up across the front with two conspicuous  \"safety-first\" pins. Addie's eyesight is poor, and she claims it was  \"plum ruint by de St. Vitus's dance,\" from which she has suffered for  many years. She readily agreed to tell of her early life, and her eyes  brightened as she began: \"Lawsy, Missy! Is dat what you come 'ere for?  Oh, dem good old days! I was thinkin' 'bout Old Miss jus' t'other day.    \"I was borned down in Oconee County on Marse Ike Vinson's place. Old  Miss was Marse Ike's mother. My Mammy and Pappy was Peter and 'Nerva  Vinson and dey was both field hands. Marse Ike buyed my Pappy from Marse  Sam Brightwell. Me and Bill, Willis, Maze, Harrison, Easter, and Sue was  all de chillun my Mammy and Pappy had. Dere warn't but four of us big  enough to wuk when Marse Ike married Miss Ann Hayes and dey tuk Mammy  wid 'em to dey new home in town. I stayed dar on de plantation and done  lots of little jobs lak waitin' on table; totin' Old Miss' breakfast to  her in her room evvy mornin', and I holped 'tend to de grainery. Dey  says now dat folkses is livin' in dat old grainery house.    \"Dat was a be-yootiful place, wid woods, cricks, and fields spread out  most as fur as you could see. De slave quarters would'a reached from  here to Milledge Avenue. Us lived in a one-room log cabin what had a  chimbly made out of sticks and mud. Dem homemade beds what us slep' on  had big old high posties wid a great big knob on de top of each post.  Our matt'esses was coarse home-wove cloth stuffed wid field straw. You  know I laked dem matt'esses 'cause when de chinches got too bad you  could shake out dat straw and burn it, den scald de tick and fill it wid  fresh straw, and rest in peace again. You can't never git de chinches  out of dese cotton matt'esses us has to sleep on now days. Pillows? What  you talkin' 'bout? You know Niggers never had no pillows dem days,  leaseways us never had none. Us did have plenty of kivver dough. Folkses  was all time a-piecin' quilts and having quiltin's. All dat sort of wuk  was done at night.    \"Pappy's Ma and Pa was Grandma Nancy and Grandpa Jacob. Day was field  hands, and dey b'longed to Marse Obe Jackson. Grandma Lucy and Grandpa  Toney Murrah was owned by Marse Billy Murrah. Marse Billy was a preacher  what sho could come down wid de gospel at church. Grandma Lucy was his  cook. Miss Sadie LeSeur got Grandma Lucy and tuk her to Columbus,  Georgy, and us never seed our grandma no more. Miss Sadie had been one  of de Vinson gals. She tuk our Aunt Haley 'long too to wait on her when  she started out for Europe, and 'fore dey got crost de water, Aunt  Haley, she died on de boat. Miss Sarah, she had a time keepin' dem  boatsmens from th'owing Aunt Haley to de sharks. She is buried in de old  country somewhar.    \"Now Missy, how was Nigger chillun gwine to git holt of money in slavery  time? Old Marse, he give us plenty of somepin t'eat and all de clothes  us needed, but he sho kep' his money for his own self.    \"Now 'bout dat somepin t'eat. Sho dat! Us had plenty of dem good old  collards, turnips, and dem sort of oatments, and dar was allus a good  chunk of meat to bile wid 'em. Marse Ike, he kep' plenty of evvy sort of  meat folkses knowed about dem days. He had his own beef cattle, lots of  sheep, and he killed more'n a hunnert hogs evvy year. Dey tells me dat  old bench dey used to lay de meat out on to cut it up is standin' dar  yet.    \"'Possums? Lawd, dey was plentiful, and dat ain't all dere was on dat  plantation. One time a slave man was 'possum huntin' and, as he was  runnin' 'round in de bresh, he looked up and dar was a b'ar standin'  right up on his hind laigs grinnin' and ready to eat dat Nigger up. Oh,  good gracious, how dat Nigger did run! Dey fetched in 'possums in piles,  and dere was lots of rabbits, fixes, and coons. Dem coon, fox and  'possum hounds sho knowed deir business. Lawsy, I kin jus' smell one of  dem good old 'possums roastin' right now, atter all dese years. You  parbiled de 'possum fust, and den roasted him in a heavy iron skillet  what had a big old thick lid. Jus' 'fore de 'possum got done, you peeled  ash-roasted 'taters and put 'em all 'round da 'possum so as day would  soak up some of dat good old gravy, and would git good and brown. Is you  ever et any good old ashcake? You wropped de raw hoecake in cabbage or  collard leafs and roasted 'em in de ashes. When dey got done, you had  somepin fit for a king to eat.    \"De kitchen was sot off a piece from de big house, and our white folkses  wouldn't eat deir supper 'fore time to light de lamps to save your life;  den I had to stan' 'hind Old Miss' cheer and fan her wid a  turkey-feather fan to keep de flies off. No matter how rich folkses was  dem days dere warn't no screens in de houses.    \"I never will forgit pore old Aunt Mary; she was our cook, and she had  to be tapped evvy now and den 'cause she had de drapsy so bad. Aunt  Mary's old man was Uncle Harris, and I 'members how he used to go  fishin' at night. De udder slaves went fishin' too. Many's de time I'se  seed my Mammy come back from Barber's Crick wid a string of fish  draggin' from her shoulders down to de ground. Me, I laked milk more'n  anything else. You jus' oughta seed dat place at milkin' time. Dere was  a heap of cows a fightin', chillun hollerin', and sich a bedlam as you  can't think up. Dat old plantation was a grand place for chillun, in  summertime 'specially, 'cause dere was so many branches and cricks close  by what us chillun could hop in and cool off.    \"Chillun didn't wear nothin' but cotton slips in summer, but de winter  clothes was good and warm. Under our heavy winter dresses us wore  quilted underskirts dat was sho nice and warm. Sunday clothes? Yes  Mar'm, us allus had nice clothes for Sunday. Dey made up our summertime  Sunday dresses out of a thin cloth called Sunday-parade. Dey was made  spenser fashion, wid ruffles 'round de neck and waist. Our ruffled  petticoats was all starched and ironed stiff and slick, and us jus'  knowed our long pantalettes, wid deir scalloped ruffles, was mighty  fine. Some of de 'omans would wuk fancy eyelets what dey punched in de  scallops wid locust thorns. Dem pantalettes was buttoned on to our  drawers. Our Sunday dresses for winter was made out of linsey-woolsey  cloth. White ladies wore hoopskirts wid deir dresses, and dey looked lak  fairy queens. Boys wore plain shirts in summer, but in winter dey had  warmer shirts and quilted pants. Dey would put two pair of britches  togedder and quilt 'em up so you couldn't tell what sort of cloth dey  was made out of. Dem pants was called suggins.    \"All de Niggers went barfoots in summer, but in winter us all wore  brogans. Old Miss had a shoe shop in de cellar under de big house, and  when dem two white 'omans dat she hired to make our shoes come, us  knowed wintertime was nigh. Dem 'omans would stay 'til day had made up  shoes enough to last us all winter long, den dey would go on to de next  place what dey s'pected to make shoes.    \"Marse Ike Vinson was sho good to his Niggers.

Him and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18500"],[0,"The Complete Works of Robert Burns: Containing his Poems, Songs, and (#15)"],[1,"a scene of horror.\" He extended his tour to  Carlisle, and from thence to the banks of the Nith, where he looked at  the farm of Ellisland, with the intention of trying once more his  fortune at the plough, should poetry and patronage fail him.    On his way through the West, Burns spent a few days with his mother at  Mossgiel: he had left her an unknown and an almost banished man: he  returned in fame and in sunshine, admired by all who aspired to be  thought tasteful or refined. He felt offended alike with the patrician  stateliness of Edinburgh and the plebeian servility of the husbandmen  of Ayrshire; and dreading the influence of the unlucky star which had  hitherto ruled his lot, he bought a pocket Milton, he said, for the  purpose of studying the intrepid independence and daring magnanimity,  and noble defiance of hardships, exhibited by Satan! In this mood he  reached Edinburgh--only to leave it again on three hurried excursions  into the Highlands. The route which he took and the sentiments which  the scenes awakened, are but faintly intimated in the memoranda which  he made. His first journey seems to have been performed in ill-humour;  at Stirling, his Jacobitism, provoked at seeing the ruined palace of  the Stuarts, broke out in some unloyal lines which he had the  indiscretion to write with a diamond on the window of a public inn. At  Carron, where he was refused a sight of the magnificent foundry, he  avenged himself in epigram. At Inverary he resented some real or  imaginary neglect on the part of his Grace of Argyll, by a stinging  lampoon; nor can he be said to have fairly regained his serenity of  temper, till he danced his wrath away with some Highland ladies at  Dumbarton.    His second excursion was made in the company of Dr. Adair, of  Harrowgate: the reluctant doors of Carron foundry were opened to him,  and he expressed his wonder at the blazing furnaces and broiling  labours of the place; he removed the disloyal lines from the window of  the inn at Stirling, and he paid a two days' visit to Ramsay of  Ochtertyre, a distinguished scholar, and discussed with him future  topics for the muse. \"I have been in the company of many men of  genius,\" said Ramsay afterwards to Currie, \"some of them poets, but  never witnessed such flashes of intellectual brightness as from  him--the impulse of the moment, sparks of celestial fire.\" From the  Forth he went to the Devon, in the county of Clackmannan, where, for  the first time, he saw the beautiful Charlotte Hamilton, the sister of  his friend Gavin Hamilton, of Mauchline. \"She is not only beautiful,\"  he thus writes to her brother, \"but lovely: her form is elegant, her  features not regular, but they have the smile of sweetness, and the  settled complacency of good nature in the highest degree. Her eyes are  fascinating; at once expressive of good sense, tenderness and a noble  mind. After the exercise of our riding to the Falls, Charlotte was  exactly Dr. Donne's mistress:--                        \"Her pure and eloquent blood      Spoke in her cheeks, and so distinctly wrought,      That one would almost say her body thought.\"    Accompanied by this charming dame, he visited an old lady, Mrs. Bruce,  of Clackmannan, who, in the belief that she had the blood of the royal  Bruce in her veins, received the poet with something of princely  state, and, half in jest, conferred the honour of knighthood upon him,  with her ancestor's sword, saying, in true Jacobitical mood, that she  had a better right to do that than some folk had! In the same pleasing  company he visited the famous cataract on the Devon, called the  Cauldron Lian, and the Rumbling bridge, a single arch thrown, it is  said by the devil, over the Devon, at the height of a hundred feet in  the air. It was the complaint of his companions that Burns exhibited  no raptures, and poured out no unpremeditated verses at such  magnificent scenes. But he did not like to be tutored or prompted:  \"Look, look!\" exclaimed some one, as Carron foundry belched forth  flames--\"look, Burns, look! good heavens, what a grand sight!--look!\"  \"I would not look--look, sir, at your bidding,\" said the bard, turning  away, \"were it into the mouth of hell!\" When he visited, at a future  time, the romantic Linn of Creehope, in Nithsdale, he looked silently  at its wonders, and showed none of the hoped-for rapture. \"You do not  admire it, I fear,\" said a gentleman who accompanied him; \"I could not  admire it more, sir,\" replied Burns, \"if He who made it were to desire  me to do it.\" There are other reasons for the silence of Burns amid  the scenes of the Devon: he was charmed into love by the sense and the  beauty of Charlotte Hamilton, and rendered her homage in that sweet  song, \"The Banks of the Devon,\" and in a dozen letters written with  more than his usual care, elegance, and tenderness. But the lady was  neither to be won by verse nor by prose: she afterwards gave her hand  to Adair, the poet's companion, and, what was less meritorious, threw  his letters into the fire.    The third and last tour into the North was in company of Nicol of the  High-School of Edinburgh: on the fields of Bannockburn and  Falkirk--places of triumph and of woe to Scotland, he gave way to  patriotic impulses, and in these words he recorded them:--\"Stirling,  August 20, 1787: this morning I knelt at the tomb of Sir John the  Graham, the gallant friend of the immortal Wallace; and two hours ago I  said a fervent prayer for old Caledonia, over the hole in a whinstone  where Robert the Bruce fixed his royal standard on the banks of  Bannockburn.\" He then proceeded northward by Ochtertyre, the water of  Earn, the vale of Glen Almond, and the traditionary grave of Ossian. He  looked in at princely Taymouth; mused an hour or two among the Birks of  Aberfeldy; gazed from Birnam top; paused amid the wild grandeur of the  pass of Killiecrankie, at the stone which marks the spot where a second  patriot Graham fell, and spent a day at Blair, where he experienced the  graceful kindness of the Duke of Athol, and in a strain truly elegant,  petitioned him, in the name of Bruar Water, to hide the utter nakedness  of its otherwise picturesque banks, with plantations of birch and oak.  Quitting Blair he followed the course of the Spey, and passing, as he  told his brother, through a wild country, among cliffs gray with eternal  snows, and glens gloomy and savage, reached Findhorn in mist and  darkness; visited Castle Cawdor, where Macbeth murdered Duncan; hastened  through Inverness to Urquhart Castle, and the Falls of Fyers, and turned  southward to Kilravock, over the fatal moor of Culloden. He admired the  ladies of that classic region for their snooded ringlets, simple  elegance of dress, and expressive eyes: in Mrs. Rose, of Kilravock  Castle, he found that matronly grace and dignity which he owned he  loved; and in the Duke and Duchess of Gordon a renewal of that more than  kindness with which they had welcomed him in Edinburgh. But while he  admired the palace of Fochabers, and was charmed by the condescensions  of the noble proprietors, he forgot that he had left a companion at the  inn, too proud and captious to be pleased at favours showered on others:  he hastened back to the inn with an invitation and an apology: he found  the fiery pedant in a foaming rage, striding up and down the street,  cursing in Scotch and Latin the loitering postilions for not yoking the  horses, and hurrying him away. All apology and explanation was in vain,  and Burns, with a vexation which he sought not to conceal, took his seat  silently beside the irascible pedagogue, and returned to the South by  Broughty Castle, the banks of Endermay and Queensferry. He parted with  the Highlands in a kindly mood, and loved to recal the scenes and the  people, both in conversation and in song.    On his return to Edinburgh he had to bide the time of his bookseller  and the public: the impression of his poems, extending to two thousand  eight hundred copies, was sold widely: much of the money had to come  from a distance, and Burns lingered about the northern metropolis,  expecting a settlement with Creech, and with the hope that those who  dispensed his country's patronage might remember one who then, as now,  was reckoned an ornament to the land. But Creech, a parsimonious man,  was slow in his payments; the patronage of the country was swallowed  up in the sink of politics, and though noblemen smiled, and ladies of  rank nodded their jewelled heads in approbation of every new song he  sung and every witty sally he uttered, they reckoned any further  notice or care superfluous: the poet, an observant man, saw all this;  but hope was the cordial of his heart, he said, and he hoped and  lingered on. Too active a genius to remain idle, he addressed himself  to the twofold business of love and verse. Repulsed by the stately  Beauty of the Devon, he sought consolation in the society of one, as  fair, and infinitely more witty; and as an accident had for a time  deprived him of the use of one of his legs, he gave wings to hours of  pain, by writing a series of letters to this Edinburgh enchantress, in  which he signed himself Sylvander, and addressed her under the name of  Clarinda. In these compositions, which no one can regard as serious,  and which James Grahame the poet called \"a romance of real Platonic  affection,\" amid much affectation both of language and sentiment, and  a desire to say fine and startling things, we can see the proud heart  of the poet throbbing in the dread of being neglected or forgotten by  his country. The love which he offers up at the altar of wit and  beauty, seems assumed and put on, for its rapture is artificial, and  its brilliancy that of an icicle: no woman was ever wooed and won in  that Malvolio way; and there is no doubt that Mrs. M'Lehose felt as  much offence as pleasure at this boisterous display of regard.
