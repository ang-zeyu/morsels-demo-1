PUNCH, it is generally thought, is Anglo-Indian, derived directly from  the Hindustani _Pantch_ or five, from the five ingredients which enter  into its composition, but it may have partially got its name from some  sporting Gipsy in whose language the word for _five_ is the same as in  Sanskrit.  There have been thousands of \"swell\" Rommany chals who have  moved in sporting circles of a higher class than they are to be found in  at the present day.    \"VARDO formerly was _Old Cant_ for a waggon\" (_The Slang Dictionary_).  It  may be added that it is pure Gipsy, and is still known at the present day  to every Rom in England.  In Turkish Gipsy, _Vordon_ means a vehicle, in  German Gipsy, _Wortin_.    \"Can you VOKER Rommany?\" is given by Mr Hotten as meaning \"Can you speak  Gipsy,\"--but there is no such word in Rommany as _voker_.  He probably  meant \"Can you _rakker_\"--pronounced very often _Roker_.  Continental  Gipsy _Rakkervava_.  Mr Hotten derives it from the Latin _Vocare_!    I do not know the origin of WELCHER, a betting cheat, but it is worthy of  remark that in old Gipsy a _Walshdo_ or Welsher meant a Frenchman (from  the German Walsch) or any foreigner of the Latin races.    YACK, a watch, probably received its name from the Gipsy _Yak_ an eye, in  the old times when watches were called bull's eyes.    LUSHY, to be tipsy, and LUSH, are attributed for their origin to the name  of Lushington, a once well-known London brewer, but when we find _Losho_  and _Loshano_ in a Gipsy dialect, meaning jolly, from such a Sanskrit  root as _Lush_; as Paspati derives it, there seems to be some ground for  supposing the words to be purely Rommany.  Dr Johnson said of lush that  it was \"opposite to pale,\" and this curiously enough shows its first  source, whether as a \"slang\" word or as indicative of colour, since one  of its early Sanskrit meanings is _light_ or _radiance_.  This identity  of the so regarded vulgar and the refined, continually confronts us in  studying Rommany.    \"To make a MULL of anything,\" meaning thereby to spoil or confuse it, if  it be derived, as is said, from the Gipsy, must have come from _Mullo_  meaning _dead_, and the Sanskrit _Mara_.  There is, however, no such  Gipsy word as mull, in the sense of entangling or spoiling.    PROSS is a theatrical slang word, meaning to instruct and train a tyro.  As there are several stage words of manifest Gipsy origin, I am inclined  to derive this from the old Gipsy _Priss_, to read.  In English Gipsy  _Prasser_ or _Pross_ means to ridicule or scorn.  Something of this is  implied in the slang word _Pross_, since it also means \"to sponge upon a  comrade,\" &c., \"for drink.\"    TOSHERS are in English low language, \"men who steal copper from ship's  bottoms.\"  I cannot form any direct connection between this word and any  in English Gipsy, but it is curious that in Turkish Gipsy _Tasi_ is a  cup, and in Turkish Persian it means, according to Paspati, a copper  basin used in the baths.  It is as characteristic of English Gipsy as of  any of its cognate dialects, that we often find lurking in it the most  remarkable Oriental fragments, which cannot be directly traced through  the regular line of transmission.    UP TO TRAP means, in common slang, intelligent.  It is worth observing,  that in Gipsy, _drab_ or _trap_ (which words were pronounced alike by the  first Gipsies who came from Germany to England), is used for medicine or  poison, and the employment of the latter is regarded, even at the  present, as the greatest Rommany secret.  Indeed, it is only a few days  since a Gipsy said to me, \"If you know _drab_, you're up to everything;  for there's nothing goes above that.\"  With _drab_ the Gipsy secures  game, fish, pigs, and poultry; he quiets kicking horses until they can be  sold; and last, not least, kills or catches rats and mice.  As with the  Indians of North America, _medicine_--whether to kill or cure--is to the  Gipsy the art of arts, and those who affect a knowledge of it are always  regarded as the most intelligent.  It is, however, remarkable, that the  Gipsy, though he lives in fields and woods, is, all the world over, far  inferior to the American Indian as regards a knowledge of the properties  of herbs or minerals.  One may pick the first fifty plants which he sees  in the woods, and show them to the first Indian whom he meets, with the  absolute certainty that the latter will give him a name for every one,  and describe in detail their qualities and their use as remedies.  The  Gipsy seldom has a name for anything of the kind.  The country people in  America, and even the farmers' boys, have probably inherited by tradition  much of this knowledge from the aborigines.    BARNEY, a mob or crowd, may be derived from the Gipsy _baro_, great or  many, which sometimes takes the form of _barno_ or _barni_, and which  suggests the Hindustani Bahrna \"to increase, proceed, to gain, to be  promoted;\" and Bharna, \"to fill, to satisfy, to be filled, &c.\"--(Brice's  \"Hindustani and English Dictionary.\"  London, Trubner & Co., 1864).    BEEBEE, which the author of the Slang Dictionary declares means a lady,  and is \"Anglo-Indian,\" is in general use among English Gipsies for aunt.  It is also a respectful form of address to any middle-aged woman, among  friends.    CULL or CULLY, meaning a man or boy, in Old English cant, is certainly of  Gipsy origin.  _Chulai_ signifies man in Spanish Gipsy (Borrow), and  _Khulai_ a gentleman, according to Paspati; in Turkish Rommany--a  distinction which the word _cully_ often preserves in England, even when  used in a derogatory sense, as of a dupe.    JOMER, a sweetheart or female favourite, has probably some connection in  derivation with choomer, a kiss, in Gipsy.    BLOKE, a common coarse word for a man, may be of Gipsy origin; since, as  the author of the Slang Dictionary declares, it may be found in  Hindustani, as Loke.  \"_Lok_, people, a world, region.\"--(\"Brice's Hind.  Dictionary.\")  _Bala' lok_, a gentleman.    A DUFFER, which is an old English cant term, expressive of contempt for a  man, may be derived from the Gipsy _Adovo_, \"that,\" \"that man,\" or \"that  fellow there.\"  _Adovo_ is frequently pronounced almost like \"a duffer,\"  or \"_a duvva_.\"    NIGGLING, which means idling, wasting time, doing anything slowly, may be  derived from some other Indo-European source, but in English Gipsy it  means to go slowly, \"to potter along,\" and in fact it is the same as the  English word.  That it is pure old Rommany appears from the fact that it  is to be found as _Niglavava_ in Turkish Gipsy, meaning \"I go,\" which is  also found in _Nikliovava_ and _Nikavava_, which are in turn probably  derived from the Hindustani _Nikalna_, \"To issue, to go forth or out,\"  &c. (Brice, Hind. Dic.)   _Niggle_ is one of the English Gipsy words  which are used in the East, but which I have not been able to find in the  German Rommany, proving that here, as in other countries, certain old  forms have been preserved, though they have been lost where the  vocabulary is far more copious, and the grammar much more perfect.    MUG, a face, is derived by Mr Wedgwood from the Italian MOCCA, a mocking  or apish mouth (Dictionary of English Etymology), but in English Gipsy we  have not only _mui_, meaning the face, but the _older_ forms from which  the English word was probably taken, such as Mak'h (Paspati), and finally  the Hindustani _Mook_ and the Sanskrit _Mukha_, mouth or face  (Shakespeare, Hind. Dic., p. 745).  In all cases where a word is so  \"slangy\" as mug, it seems more likely that it should have been derived  from Rommany than from Italian, since it is only within a few years that  any considerable number of the words of the latter language was imparted  to the lower classes of London.    BAMBOOZLE, BITE, and SLANG are all declared by the author of the Slang  Dictionary to be Gipsy, but, with the exception of the last word, I am  unable to verify their Rommany origin.  Bambhorna does indeed mean in  Hindustani (Brice), \"to bite or to worry,\" and bamboo-bakshish to deceive  by paying with a whipping, while _swang_, as signifying mimicking,  acting, disguise and sham, whether of words or deeds, very curiously  conveys the spirit of the word slang.  As for _bite_ I almost hesitate to  suggest the possibility of a connection between it and _Bidorna_, to  laugh at.  I offer not only these three suggested derivations, but also  most of the others, with every reservation.  For many of these words, as  for instance _bite_, etymologists have already suggested far more  plausible and more probable derivations, and if I have found a place for  Rommany \"roots,\" it is simply because what is the most plausible, and  apparently the most probable, is not always the true origin.  But as I  firmly believe that there is much more Gipsy in English, especially in  English slang and cant, than the world is aware of, I think it advisable  to suggest what I can, leaving to abler philologists the task of testing  its value.    Writers on such subjects err, almost without an exception, in insisting  on one accurately defined and singly derived source for every word, when  perhaps three or four have combined to form it.  The habits of thought  and methods of study followed by philologists render them especially open  to this charge.  They wish to establish every form as symmetrical and  mathematical, where nature has been freakish and bizarre.  Some years ago  when I published certain poems in the broken English spoken by Germans,  an American philologist, named Haldemann, demonstrated to his own  satisfaction that the language which I had put into Hans Breitmann's  mouth was inaccurate, because I had not reduced it to an uniform dialect,  making the same word the same in spelling and pronunciation on all  occasions, when the most accurate observation had convinced me,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16360"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 561, October 2, 1886 (#15)"],[1,"the dark part of the  flame.    [Illustration: FIG. 6. FIG. 7. TYPES OF ECONOMICAL BURNERS.]    It is the combustion of gas, without the production of useful luminous  effect inside the shield, which supplies the reflected as well as  radiated heat to the air. The temperature is still further increased  by the heat transmitted to the metal portion of the burner, and  absorbed by the wire gauze, between the close meshes of which the air  from outside is forced to circulate. Air is admitted inside the flame  by the chimney, D, placed above the focus, and in which it is raised  to a high temperature by friction on the upper part of the lamp glass,  at E, and afterward by its passage through the horizontal portion of  the bent tube. This tube is impinged upon on the outside by the  flames, and also by the products of combustion, so that it forms a  veritable heater of the currents which traverse it.    The introduction of hot air into the central portion of the sheet of  flame is advantageously supplemented by the spreading out of the flame  by means of the metal disk, without any possibility of its being  divided. In this way a more intense heat is obtained, and consequently  the illuminating power is considerably increased, by the uncombined  carbon being more readily set free, and being thus kept longer in the  flame, F. This burner, which may be constructed for a moderate gas  consumption, gives remarkable results as regards illuminating power  and steadiness; the abstraction of heat in no way impairing the  luminosity of the flame, which preserves all its brightness.    The Argand burner with double chimney, shown in Fig. 7, is also an  economical one for a small consumption of gas. The air admitted to  both the inside and the outside is raised to a high temperature by  passing along the spirals of a second and transparent chimney, C¹,  which surrounds the cylindrical glass, C. The gas itself is heated by  passing through this hot chamber before reaching the outlet orifices;  so that the mixture of air and gas takes place under the most  favorable conditions for their perfect combustion.    The burner is an ordinary Argand, which may terminate below in a small  chamber for the gas and air to mingle. But this is not necessary; and  the usual arrangement for mixing the air and gas may be adopted. The  outer air enters at the top of the central chimney, C and passes into  the annular space between the two glasses; then descends by the two  spiral passages, which surround the cylindrical glass and terminate  in a portion hermetically sealed by a brass plate attached to the  supply-pipe. All the parts of the burner are thus surrounded by a  highly-heated atmosphere, especially at the bottom of the double  chimney; and it will be readily understood that, if the branches which  lead the gas to the burner are constructed of a highly conductive  metal, the gas will become heated in its turn by passing through  passages raised to a high temperature.    The elements are therefore dissociated or separated before their final  combination; thereby raising the calorific and luminous effect to the  highest possible degree. Such a burner can, of course, be made as  small as may be required; thus lending itself admirably to the  subdivision of illumination. The only precaution required is to  properly proportion the sectional area of the hot-air passages to the  radiant surface of the flame, so that the heat does not become too  intense at the lower portion of the burner.    Fig. 8 shows a double flame burner on the principle of Mr. Heron's,  but with admission of hot air into the angle formed by the flames. As  exemplified by Mr. Heron, if two equal batswing burners separately  give a certain amount of light, on the two flames being brought into  contact, so as to form a single flame, the luminosity is considerably  increased, owing to the condensation of heat which results from their  meeting. The two incandescent sheets are, as it were, forced into one  another, so as to be combined.    [Illustration: FIG. 8. DOUBLE FLAT-FLAME BURNER]    The high-power burners of Douglass, Coze, Mallet, and others were  designed on this principle; but its application to uninclosed burners  was not very satisfactory, because the great cooling down of the inner  surface of the flames by the strong draught of cold air impaired their  illuminating power. To counteract this difficulty, M. Somzee adopts a  heating burner, A, which he places between the two batswing burners,  B, so that the products of combustion rise in the angle made by the  two lighting flames, as shown; thus greatly increasing their  luminosity while maintaining a low consumption of gas.    M. Somzee also raises the illuminating power of an ordinary flat-flame  burner by causing an obscure effluvium to traverse the dark portion of  the flame. The effect of this is to increase the activity of  decomposition in this portion, so that the particles of carbon are the  more readily set free, and remain longer in suspension in the luminous  zone. The obscure effluvium may be determined between two points by  the electric current, or be caused by the heating of an imperfect  conductor by the current; or, again, it may result from a metal  conductor heated by the reactions produced in the middle of the flame,  by separating the cone of matter in ignition. The effect may be  compared with that obtained by the concentration of two sheets of  flame; but in this case the sheets are formed by the constituent parts  of one and the same flame, whence results a more complete utilization  of the elements composing it. This system is, in fact, a  simplification of the arrangement adopted in the double-flame burner  seen in Fig. 8.    Fig. 9 shows a reflecting and regenerative burner with double glass.  The crown, made of metal polished on both sides, has a circular  groove, G, for receiving the end of the central chimney, C, and  presenting an annular aperture by which the products of combustion  enter. The second glass, C¹, is fastened to the collar of the  burner carrier, and does not come into contact with the metal crown;  so as to allow the air to enter from outside for supplying the burner.  The gas enters by the pipe, T, provided with a cock. This pipe is  continued to the top of the apparatus, and there spreads out into the  form of a dome; thus dividing into two compartments the trunconic  chamber, S¹ S squared, whence the hot gas returns to the body of the burner,  B.    [Illustration: FIG 9. REFLECTING AND REGENERATING BURNER.]    On the burner being lighted from below, the products of combustion  rise in the inner chimney, and enter the heater, which they traverse  through its entire extent, while impinging against the outside of the  gas reservoir, to which they give up a large portion of their heat.  They then pass by the passage, D, into the atmosphere or into a  chimney. The air necessary for combustion enters at the top of the  outer globe, and becomes highly heated in its passage through the  space comprised between the two glasses of the burner. In this way it  reaches the burner, and forms an intimate mixture with the small jets  of gas which compose the flame. The gas, on leaving the supply-pipe,  T, fills one of the compartments, S¹ S squared, of the heater, and then  returns by the second compartment, and again descends by the casing of  the supply-pipe, having its temperature still further raised by  contact with the internal radiation of the flame.    Under these conditions, all the parts of the burner are supplied by  heated air, and the combustion becomes very active; thus increasing  the intensity of the flame, and consequently that of the light  afforded, while at the same time effecting a saving of 50 per cent. of  gas. This burner may be made of any size, and for consumptions not  exceeding that of an ordinary Argand. In fact, the gas is consumed at  a low pressure, escaping with no greater force than that due to the  heat of the products of combustion. It is sufficiently expanded on  coming into contact with the current of hot air, the activity of which  is regulated by the height of the apparatus, that is to say, by that  of its two chimneys. The mixture is made in such proportion as to  obtain from the gas and air as great a degree of luminosity as  possible. The high temperature of the gas, and the independent means  of heating the air and gas, constitute the essential principles of  this burner.--_Journal of Gas Lighting._           *       *       *       *       *          THE CLAMOND GAS BURNER.      [Illustration: THE CLAMOND GAS BURNER.]    In this burner, which is a French invention, the light is produced by  burning ordinary coal gas within a basket of magnesia, which is  thereby brought to a high state of incandescence, and from which a  white, steady light is radiated. It may be said to consist of three  different parts. The first and inner part is a central column, B, of  fireproof material. The second part consists of two concentric  cylinders placed round the inner column and communicating one with the  other through the cross cuts, J. The third part is a china cup  inclosing the other parts, and perforated with a number of holes. The  gas burns in two different places. From A it passes directly through  B, at the top of which it branches off through tubes to an annular  chamber, D, from which it escapes through the openings, _a_, _a_, _a_,  where combustion takes place. The other combustion occurs within the  circular space, G, I, between the column and the inner of the two  surrounding cylinders, through two channels, E E, in the lower part of  the central column. The gas passes into a circular chamber, F F, and  escapes through small holes in the upper partition of this chamber,  where it burns.
