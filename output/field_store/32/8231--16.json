It is these creatures which the kings  placed at the sides of the doors of their palaces, to protect the  king's footsteps. In early Babylonian times a god named Lama was one  of the most popular deities of the Babylonian pantheon.                             A specimen incantation.    Numerous inscriptions, which may be regarded as dating, in their  origin, from about the middle of the third millennium before Christ,  speak of these supernatural beings, and also of others similar. One of  the most perfect of these inscriptions is a large bilingual tablet of  which a duplicate written during the period of the dynasty of  Hammurabi (before 2000 B.C.) exists, and which was afterwards provided  with a Semitic Babylonian translation. This inscription refers to the  evil god, the evil /utukku/, the /utukku/ of the plain, of the  mountain, of the sea, and of the grave; the evil /sedu/, the glorious  /alu/, or divine bull, and the evil unsparing wind. There was also  that which takes the form of a man, the evil face, the evil eye, the  evil mouth, the evil tongue, the evil lip, the evil breath; also the  afflicting /asakku/ (regarded as the demon of fever), the /asakku/  which does not leave a man: the afflicting /namtaru/ (fate), the  severe /namtaru/, the /namtaru/ which does not quit a man. After this  are mentioned various diseases, bodily pains, annoyances, such as \"the  old shoe, the broken shoe-lace, the food which afflicts the body of a  man, the food which turns in eating, the water which chokes in  drinking,\" etc. Other things to be exorcised included the spirit of  death, people who had died of hunger, thirst, or in other ways; the  handmaid of the /lilu/ who had no husband, the prince of the /lilu/  who had no wife, whether his name had been recorded or unrecorded.    The method of exorcising the demons causing all these things is  curious. White and black yarn was spun, and fastened to the side and  canopy of the afflicted person's bed--the white to the side and the  top or canopy, the black to the left hand--and then, apparently, the  following words were said:--    \"Evil /utukku/, evil /alu/, evil /edimmu/, evil /gallu/, evil god,  evil /rabisu/, /labartu/, /labasu/, /ahhazu/, /lilu/, /lilithu/,  handmaid of /lilu/, sorcery, enchantment, magic, disaster, machination  which is not good--may they not set their head to his head, their hand  to his hand, their foot to his foot--may they not draw near. Spirit of  heaven, mayest thou exorcise, spirit of earth, mayest thou exorcise.\"    But this was only the beginning of the real ceremony. The god  Asari-alim-nunna (Merodach), \"eldest son of Eridu,\" was asked to wash  him in pure and bright water twice seven times, and then would the evil  lier-in-wait depart, and stand aside, and a propitious /sedu/ and a  propitious /labartu/ reside in his body. The gates right and left  having been thus, so to say, shut close, the evil gods, demons, and  spirits would be unable to approach him, wherever he might be. \"Spirit  of heaven, exorcise, spirit of earth, exorcise.\" Then, after an  invocation of Eres-ki-gal and Isum, the final paragraph was  pronounced:--      \"The afflicted man, by an offering of grace    In health like shining bronze shall be made bright.    As for that man,    Samas shall give him life.    Merodach, first-born son of the Abyss,    It is thine to purify and glorify.    Spirit of heaven, mayest thou exorcise, spirit of      earth, mayest thou exorcise.\"                              Rites and ceremonies.    As may be expected, the Babylonians and Assyrians had numerous rites  and ceremonies, the due carrying out of which was necessary for the  attainment of the grace demanded, or for the efficacy of the thanks  tendered for favours received.    Perhaps the oldest ceremony recorded is that which Ut-napistim, the  Chaldaean Noah, made on the /zikkurat/ or peak of the mountain after  the coming forth from the ship which had saved him and his from the  Flood. The Patriarch's description of this ceremony is short:--      \"I sent forth to the four winds, I poured out a libation    I made an offering on the peak of the mountain:    Seven and seven I set incense-vases there,    Into their depths I poured cane, cedar, and scented wood(?).    The gods smelled a savour,    The gods smelled a sweet savour,    The gods gathered like flies over the sacrificer.\"    Following in the footsteps of their great progenitor, the Babylonians  and Assyrians became a most pious race, constantly rendering to their  gods the glory for everything which they succeeded in bringing to a  successful issue. Prayer, supplication, and self-abasement before  their gods seem to have been with them a duty and a pleasure:--      \"The time for the worship of the gods was my heart's delight,    The time of the offering to Istar was profit and riches,\"    sings Ludlul the sage, and all the people of his land were one with  him in that opinion.    It is noteworthy that the offering of the Chaldaean Noah consisted of  vegetable produce only, and there are many inscriptions referring to  similar bloodless sacrifices, and detailing the ritual used in  connection therewith. Sacrifices of animals, however, seem to have  been constantly made--in any case, offerings of cattle and fowl, in  list-form, are fairly numerous. Many a cylinder-seal has a  representation of the owner bringing a young animal--a kid or a  lamb--as an offering to the deity whom he worshipped, and in the  inscriptions the sacrifice of animals is frequently referred to. One  of the bilingual texts refers to the offering of a kid or some other  young animal, apparently on behalf of a sick man. The text of this,  where complete, runs as follows:--      \"The fatling which is the 'head-raiser' of mankind--    He has given the fatling for his life.    He has given the head of the fatling for his head,    He has given the neck of the fatling for his neck,    He has given the breast of the fatling for his breast.\"    Whether human sacrifices were common or not is a doubtful point. Many  cylinder-seals exist in which the slaying of a man is depicted, and  the French Assyriologist Menant was of opinion that they represented a  human offering to the gods. Hayes Ward, however, is inclined to doubt  this explanation, and more evidence would seem, therefore, to be  needed. He is inclined to think that, in the majority of cases, the  designs referred to show merely the victims of divine anger or  vengeance, punished by the deity for some misdeed or sin, either  knowingly or unknowingly committed.    In the Assyrian galleries of the British Museum, Assur-nasir-apli,  king of Assyria, is several times shown engaged in religious  ceremonies--either worshipping before the sacred tree, or about to  pour out, apparently, a libation to the gods before departing upon  some expedition, and priests bringing offerings, either animal or  vegetable, are also represented. Assur-bani-apli, who is identified  with \"the great and noble Asnapper,\" is shown, in bas-reliefs of the  Assyrian Saloon, pouring out a thank-offering over the lions which he  has killed, after his return from the hunt.                                      CHAPTER VI                       PROBLEMS WHICH THE STUDY OFFERS                                   Monotheism.    As the matter of Babylonian monotheism has been publicly touched upon  by Fried. Delitzsch in his \"Babel und Bibel\" lectures, a few words  upon that important point will be regarded in all probability as  appropriate. It has already been indicated that the giving of the  names of \"the gods his fathers\" to Merodach practically identified  them with him, thus leading to a tendency to monotheism. That tendency  is, perhaps, hinted at in a letter of Assur-bani-apli to the  Babylonians, in which he frequently mentions the Deity, but in doing  so, uses either the word /ilu/, \"God,\" Merodach, the god of Babylon,  or Bel, which may be regarded as one of his names. The most important  document for this monotheistic tendency, however (confirming as it  does the tablet of the fifty-one names), is that in which at least  thirteen of the Babylonian deities are identified with Merodach, and  that in such a way as to make them merely forms in which he manifested  himself to men. The text of this inscription is as follows:--      \". . .            is Merodach of planting.    Lugal-aki-. . .   is Merodach of the water-course.    Nirig             is Merodach of strength.    Nergal            is Merodach of war.    Zagaga            is Merodach of battle.    Bel               is Merodach of lordship and domination.    Nebo              is Merodach of trading(?).    Sin               is Merodach the illuminator of the night.    Samas             is Merodach of righteous things.    Addu              is Merodach of rain.    Tispak            is Merodach of frost(?).    Sig               is Merodach of green things(?).    Suqamunu          is Merodach of the irrigation-channel.\"    Here the text breaks off, but must have contained several more similar  identifications, showing how at least the more thoughtful of the  Babylonians of old looked upon the host of gods whom they worshipped.  What may be the date of this document is uncertain, but as the  colophon seems to describe it as a copy of an older inscription, it  may go back as far as 2000 years B.C. This is the period at which the  name /Yaum-ilu/ \"Jah is God,\" is found, together with numerous  references to /ilu/ as the name for the one great god, and is also,  roughly, the date of Abraham, who, it may be noted, was a Babylonian  of Ur of the Chaldees. It will probably not be thought too venturesome  to say that his monotheism was possibly the result of the religious  trend of thought in his time.                                     Dualism.

At  first, in her excitement, time flew by.  Gradually, however, as the sun  moved westward, she began to be restless.  The soft thud of dropping  pine cones, the rustling of squirrels up and down the shaggy-barked  spruces, the cracking of weathered bits of rock, these caught her keen  ears many times and brought her up erect and thrilling.  Finally she  heard a sound which resembled that of an unshod hoof on stone.  Stealthily then she took her rifle and slipped back through the pine  thicket to the spot she had chosen.  The little pines were so close  together that she had to crawl between their trunks. The ground was  covered with a soft bed of pine needles, brown and fragrant.  In her  hurry she pricked her ungloved hand on a sharp pine cone and drew the  blood.  She sucked the tiny wound.  \"Shore I'm wonderin' if that's a  bad omen,\" she muttered, darkly thoughtful. Then she resumed her  sinuous approach to the edge of the thicket, and presently reached it.    Ellen lay flat a moment to recover her breath, then raised herself on  her elbows.  Through an opening in the fringe of buck brush she could  plainly see the promontory where she had stood with Jean Isbel, and  also the approaches by which he might come.  Rather nervously she  realized that her covert was hardly more than a hundred feet from the  promontory.  It was imperative that she be absolutely silent. Her eyes  searched the openings along the Rim.  The gray form of a deer crossed  one of these, and she concluded it had made the sound she had heard.  Then she lay down more comfortably and waited. Resolutely she held, as  much as possible, to her sensorial perceptions. The meaning of Ellen  Jorth lying in ambush just to see an Isbel was a conundrum she refused  to ponder in the present.  She was doing it, and the physical act had  its fascination.  Her ears, attuned to all the sounds of the lonely  forest, caught them and arranged them according to her knowledge of  woodcraft.    A long hour passed by.  The sun had slanted to a point halfway between  the zenith and the horizon.  Suddenly a thought confronted Ellen Jorth:  \"He's not comin',\" she whispered.  The instant that idea presented  itself she felt a blank sense of loss, a vague regret--something that  must have been disappointment.  Unprepared for this, she was held by  surprise for a moment, and then she was stunned.  Her spirit, swift and  rebellious, had no time to rise in her defense.  She was a lonely,  guilty, miserable girl, too weak for pride to uphold, too fluctuating  to know her real self.  She stretched there, burying her face in the  pine needles, digging her fingers into them, wanting nothing so much as  that they might hide her.  The moment was incomprehensible to Ellen,  and utterly intolerable.  The sharp pine needles, piercing her wrists  and cheeks, and her hot heaving breast, seemed to give her exquisite  relief.    The shrill snort of a horse sounded near at hand.  With a shock Ellen's  body stiffened.  Then she  quivered a little and her feelings underwent  swift change.  Cautiously and noiselessly she raised herself upon her  elbows and peeped through the opening in the brush.  She saw a man  tying a horse to a bush somewhat back from the Rim.  Drawing a rifle  from its saddle sheath he threw it in the hollow of his arm and walked  to the edge of the precipice.  He gazed away across the Basin and  appeared lost in contemplation or thought.  Then he turned to look back  into the forest, as if he expected some one.    Ellen recognized the lithe figure, the dark face so like an Indian's.  It was Isbel.  He had come.  Somehow his coming seemed wonderful and  terrible.  Ellen shook as she leaned on her elbows.  Jean Isbel, true  to his word, in spite of her scorn, had come back to see her.  The fact  seemed monstrous.  He was an enemy of her father.  Long had range rumor  been bandied from lip to lip--old Gass Isbel had sent for his Indian  son to fight the Jorths.  Jean Isbel--son of a Texan--unerring  shot--peerless tracker--a bad and dangerous man!  Then there flashed  over Ellen a burning thought--if it were true, if he was an enemy of  her father's, if a fight between Jorth and Isbel was inevitable, she  ought to kill this Jean Isbel right there in his tracks as he boldly  and confidently waited for her.  Fool he was to think she would come.  Ellen sank down and dropped her head until the strange tremor of her  arms ceased.  That dark and grim flash of thought retreated.  She had  not come to murder a man from ambush, but only to watch him, to try to  see what he meant, what he thought, to allay a strange curiosity.    After a while she looked again.  Isbel was sitting on an upheaved  section of the Rim, in a comfortable position from which he could watch  the openings in the forest and gaze as well across the west curve of  the Basin to the Mazatzals.  He had composed himself to wait. He was  clad in a buckskin suit, rather new, and it certainly showed off to  advantage, compared with the ragged and soiled apparel Ellen  remembered.  He did not look so large.  Ellen was used to the long,  lean, rangy Arizonians and Texans.  This man was built differently. He  had the widest shoulders of any man she had ever seen, and they made  him appear rather short.  But his lithe, powerful limbs proved he was  not short.  Whenever he moved the muscles rippled.  His hands were  clasped round a knee--brown, sinewy hands, very broad, and fitting the  thick muscular wrists.  His collar was open, and he did not wear a  scarf, as did the men Ellen knew.  Then her intense curiosity at last  brought her steady gaze to Jean Isbel's head and face.  He wore a cap,  evidently of some thin fur.  His hair was straight and short, and in  color a dead raven black.  His complexion was dark, clear tan, with no  trace of red.  He did not have the prominent cheek bones nor the  high-bridged nose usual with white men who were part Indian.  Still he  had the Indian look.  Ellen caught that in the dark, intent, piercing  eyes, in the wide, level, thoughtful brows, in the stern impassiveness  of his smooth face.  He had a straight, sharp-cut profile.    Ellen whispered to herself: \"I saw him right the other day.  Only, I'd  not admit it.... The finest-lookin' man I ever saw in my life is a  damned Isbel!  Was that what I come out heah for?\"    She lowered herself once more and, folding her arms under her breast,  she reclined comfortably on them, and searched out a smaller peephole  from which she could spy upon Isbel.  And as she watched him the new  and perplexing side of her mind waxed busier.  Why had he come back?  What did he want of her?  Acquaintance, friendship, was impossible for  them.  He had been respectful, deferential toward her, in a way that  had strangely pleased, until the surprising moment when he had kissed  her.  That had only disrupted her rather dreamy pleasure in a situation  she had not experienced before.  All the men she had met in this wild  country were rough and bold; most of them had wanted to marry her, and,  failing that, they had persisted in amorous attentions not particularly  flattering or honorable.  They were a bad lot.  And contact with them  had dulled some of her sensibilities.  But this Jean Isbel had seemed a  gentleman.  She struggled to be fair, trying to forget her antipathy,  as much to understand herself as to give him due credit.  True, he had  kissed her, crudely and forcibly.  But that kiss had not been an  insult.  Ellen's finer feeling forced her to believe this.  She  remembered the honest amaze and shame and contrition with which he had  faced her, trying awkwardly to explain his bold act. Likewise she  recalled the subtle swift change in him at her words,  \"Oh, I've been  kissed before!\"  She was glad she had said that.   Still--was she glad,  after all?    She watched him.  Every little while he shifted his gaze from the blue  gulf beneath him to the forest.  When he turned thus the sun shone on  his face and she caught the piercing gleam of his dark eyes. She saw,  too, that he was listening.  Watching and listening for her! Ellen had  to still a tumult within her.  It made her feel very young, very shy,  very strange.  All the while she hated him because he manifestly  expected her to come.  Several times he rose and walked a little way  into the woods.  The last time he looked at the westering sun and shook  his head.  His confidence had gone.  Then he sat and gazed down into  the void.  But Ellen knew he did not see anything there.  He seemed an  image carved in the stone of the Rim, and he gave Ellen a singular  impression of loneliness and sadness.  Was he thinking of the miserable  battle his father had summoned him to lead--of what it would cost--of  its useless pain and hatred?  Ellen seemed to divine his thoughts.  In  that moment she softened toward him, and in her soul quivered and  stirred an intangible something that was like pain, that was too deep  for her understanding.  But she felt sorry for an Isbel until the old  pride resurged.  What if he admired her?  She remembered his interest,  the wonder and admiration, the growing light in his eyes.  And it had  not been repugnant to her until he disclosed his name.  \"What's in a  name?\" she mused, recalling poetry learned in her girlhood.  \"'A rose  by any other name would smell as sweet'.... He's an Isbel--yet he might  be splendid--noble.... Bah! he's not--and I'd hate him anyhow.\"    All at once Ellen felt cold shivers steal over her.  Isbel's piercing  gaze was directed straight at her hiding place.  Her heart stopped  beating.  If he discovered her there she felt that she would die of  shame.  Then she became aware that a blue jay was screeching in a pine  above her, and a red squirrel somewhere near was chattering his shrill  annoyance.  These two denizens"]]]
