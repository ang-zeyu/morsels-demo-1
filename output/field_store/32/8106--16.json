DEAR SIR,--I am favoured by the receipt of your letter of the 25th  inst., and the accompanying draft of a proposed bill \"for the  better Preservation of Salmon,\" and proceed at once to offer such  remarks and suggestions as occur to me, and shall be glad to learn  that they meet with your approval.    In the third clause (section) you give an interpretation of the  names under which you wish to include all fish of the Salmon kind.  Does not this include common Trout? You specially include Char by  name. Would it not be better to limit your intentions to all  migratory fish of the Salmon kind, to wit, Salmon, Grilse, &c.  &c.? I think also the meaning of a fixed net wants defining more  rigorously. As it now stands it appears to me that it would  include any net which should be fastened on a root or stone whilst  it was being drawn through a pool, if the men employed in doing  this were to let go the cords whilst they loosed the net from the  obstruction.    Fourth clause.--I quite agree with you on the period allotted to  annual close time, but think there ought to be a penalty for  buying, selling, or having in possession Salmon roe (save and  except for the purpose of artificial propagation).    Seventh.--I do not agree with you at all on the subject of the  weekly close time, which in my opinion ought to be for one-half of  every day, except Sunday, and the whole of that day. Why should  the owners of fisheries at the mouths of rivers, who are at  neither trouble nor expense in breeding or preserving the spawning  fish, have all the benefit derivable from their increase? Why  should the upper proprietors act the part of brood hens for these,  hatching and preserving the fish for the benefit of those who take  no trouble about these things themselves?    Twelfth.--I do not agree with you as to the size of the mesh: I do  not think that a mesh of twelve inches in circumference, or three  inches from knot to knot, at all too large; it would permit fish  below six pounds to escape, and this being done, there would under  any circumstances be a fair supply of breeding fish.    Fifteenth.--I think your leister requires a more rigorous  definition. A man in this neighbourhood is reputed to have killed  a good many Salmon with a hay or a dung fork. Are either of these  leisters?    Your sixteenth section is utterly impracticable. How could such  hecks or grates be prevented from choking with leaves in the  autumn and ice in the winter, thus stopping the wheels? You might  as well require a farmer to hedge out the game. Impose a penalty,  if you like, upon any millowner who may kill Salmon in his mill  lead; and as you give your conservators power to inspect  everywhere, you will readily detect such practices. But it will  never do to close the mills by pretexts that the fish may be taken  or killed there.    Twenty-first.--I do not understand the meaning of this. But taken  in its ordinary sense, it seems to me to be very unjust. Many  persons have traps in their weirs for the purpose of taking Salmon  to which they plead a prescriptive right. Do you mean to do away  with these? You may succeed in this, but why should not a man be  allowed to fish in the river above the weir where there are no  obstructions to the passage of the fish? And why should not a man  be allowed to fish with a rod and line below the weir, and as near  to it as he chooses? I think weirs might be safely divided into  two classes: those used for manufacturing purposes and those for  fishery purposes; that a man should be allowed to say in which  class his weir should be included. If for manufacturing purposes  he should not be allowed to catch Salmon (except with rod and  line) within a certain distance below the weir. If he choose to  class his weir as one for fishery purposes, he should then be  compelled to give a free passage to the fish for twelve hours  every day; but he should be compelled to make his election as to  the class in which he would include his weir.    Twenty-fifth.--It would never do to allow the commissioners to  make bye-laws. Suppose the case of a millowner who got into a  dispute with them: he might be utterly ruined by their bye-laws;  they might make bye-laws which deprived him of his water-power,  under a pretext that they were taking more efficient care of the  Salmon.    Thirty-first.--I think the licence to angle should be compulsory,  and not at the discretion of the commissioner. That it should be  in the nature of a game licence, qualifying and enabling the  holder to angle in any river of Great Britain and Ireland,  provided he had the consent of the owner of the fishery where he  was angling.    (_Additional observations_). Twelfth.--You say that no double net  shall be used. Do you mean to prohibit the trammel, which is  usually a treble and not a double net? You also prohibit one net  behind another, but you do not specify the distance outside of  which a second net would be lawful. If neither a series of Scotch  nets nor a single trammel is to be used, by what sort of net do  you propose to catch the Salmon?    Nineteenth.--You say the sluices which admit water to wheels or  factories shall be kept closed from six o'clock on Saturday night  to six o'clock on Monday morning. How, then, are the repairs of  shafting and machinery to be made? These are generally done when  the workpeople have gone home on Saturdays. Besides, what is your  object? If the river is low, the Salmon will not be running up the  stream, and if it be in flood there will always be an abundant  supply running over the weir in addition to that which would be  required to turn the wheel. You add that the water may be allowed  to flow freely through the waste-gate, provided the opening of  such a waste-gate shall not deprive the mill of the necessary  supply of water.    Eighteenth.--In this clause you say that in weirs already  constructed it shall be lawful for the commissioner, on the  application of any two or more persons interested in the fisheries  of such river, and at the proper costs and charges of the persons  making such application--proof having been first given, &c.--to  cause a survey to be made of such dam or weir by a competent  engineer, and to direct such alterations to be made therein as  shall, in the opinion of the commissioner, be necessary and  desirable, &c.    In this clause, which so far as it goes is very desirable, you  have omitted a proviso without which it could never pass into a  law. You have forgotten to provide for the legal right of the  millowner, which would, or might, be taken away by the alteration  made in the weir unless there were some provision in the act which  prevented this being done. At present there is no such proviso in  your act. Here I have offered for years to allow the upper  proprietors to make any alteration they liked in the weir,  provided such alterations did not affect the milling power, the  stability of the weir, or my legal title to the weir as existing  at present. And my legal adviser tells me that any alteration made  in the weir without a guarantee from the upper proprietors would  very probably deprive me of my present title.    * * * * *    LETTERS ON AGRICULTURAL SUBJECTS.    * * * * *    ON THE CULTIVATION OF WHEAT ON THE SAME LAND IN SUCCESSIVE YEARS.    _To The Editor of the \"Manchester Guardian.\"_    CLITHEROE, October 5th, 1843.    SIR,--I PROMISED to send you some details of my attempt to grow  wheat on the same soil year after year. These I now forward, and  hope they may prove interesting. I was led into these experiments  by reading Liebig's book on the \"Chemistry of Agriculture;\" for,  assuming his theory to be true, it appeared to me to be quite  possible to grow wheat on the same land year after year; as,  according to that theory, the carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, which  constitute the great bulk of all cereal crops (both grain and  straw), are supplied in abundance from the soil and atmosphere (or  perhaps, to speak more correctly, from the latter), and we have  only to supply those inorganic substances, which, however  numerous, form but a small part of the whole weight of the crop.  With the view of testing this theory, and hoping that I might be  able to find out what were the elements which built up and  cemented the carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen together--or, in other  words, which constituted fertility--I begun, in the autumn of  1841, to experiment on a field which had been exhausted by a  succession of crops, and which had just been cleared of one of  oats. I chose an exhausted field in preference to any other, as  the only one in which I could test the truth of the theory. It was  very foul, being full of couch grass and weeds of all kinds. It  was ploughed up and hastily picked over, for the season was so  unfavourable for cleaning the land (from the great quantity of  rain that fell) that I was almost induced to abandon the  experiment. Previously to sowing the seed, one-fourth of the field  was manured with a compost of night-soil and coal-ashes, at the  rate of forty tons to the customary acre (7840 yards); the  remaining three-fourths having the seed put in without any manure  whatever. The winter was very unfavourable for the plants in our  cold wet soil, and in the unmanured part of the field many of them  perished, and those that survived made very little progress, from  having no stimulus at the roots. Thinking it desirable to apply my  experimental manures in moist weather, I waited until the 6th May,  when I treated that part of the field which had _not_ been manured  (three-fourths of the whole) in the following manner. I applied  guano to one-fourth, at the rate of two hundredweight to the  statute acre, and the same weight of nitrate of soda over another  fourth, leaving one-fourth entirely without manure. The wheat  manured with the guano"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1831"],[0,"The Lock and Key Library: Classic Mystery and Detective Stories: Old Time (#15)"],[1,"with that inward warning  of danger which is conveyed to man, as to inferior animals, in the  very aspect of the creatures that sting or devour.  At my movement  the man inclined his head in the submissive Eastern salutation, and  spoke in his foreign tongue, softly, humbly, fawningly, to judge by  his tone and his gesture.    I moved yet farther away from him with loathing, and now the human  thought flashed upon me: was I, in truth, exposed to no danger in  trusting myself to the mercy of the weird and remorseless master of  those hirelings from the East--seven men in number, two at least of  them formidably armed, and docile as bloodhounds to the hunter, who  has only to show them their prey?  But fear of man like myself is  not my weakness; where fear found its way to my heart, it was  through the doubts or the fancies in which man like myself  disappeared in the attributes, dark and unknown, which we give to a  fiend or a specter.  And, perhaps, if I could have paused to  analyze my own sensations, the very presence of this escort--  creatures of flesh and blood--lessened the dread of my  incomprehensible tempter.  Rather, a hundred times, front and defy  those seven Eastern slaves--I, haughty son of the Anglo-Saxon who  conquers all races because he fears no odds--than have seen again  on the walls of my threshold the luminous, bodiless shadow!  Besides: Lilian--Lilian! for one chance of saving her life, however  wild and chimerical that chance might be, I would have shrunk not a  foot from the march of an army.    Thus reassured and thus resolved, I advanced, with a smile of  disdain, to meet Margrave and his veiled companion, as they now  came from the moonlit copse.    \"Well,\" I said to him, with an irony that unconsciously mimicked  his own, \"have you taken advice with your nurse?  I assume that the  dark form by your side is that of Ayesha!\"*      * Margrave's former nurse and attendant.      The woman looked at me from her sable veil, with her steadfast,  solemn eyes, and said, in English, though with a foreign accent:  \"The nurse born in Asia is but wise through her love; the pale son  of Europe is wise through his art.  The nurse says, 'Forbear!'  Do  you say, 'Adventure'?\"    \"Peace!\" exclaimed Margrave, stamping his foot on the ground.  \"I  take no counsel from either; it is for me to resolve, for you to  obey, and for him to aid.  Night is come, and we waste it; move  on.\"    The woman made no reply, nor did I.  He took my arm and walked back  to the hut.  The barbaric escort followed.  When we reached the  door of the building, Margrave said a few words to the woman and to  the litter bearers.  They entered the hut with us.  Margrave  pointed out to the woman his coffer, to the men the fuel stowed in  the outhouse.  Both were borne away and placed within the litter.  Meanwhile I took from the table, on which it was carelessly thrown,  the light hatchet that I habitually carried with me in my rambles.    \"Do you think that you need that idle weapon?\" said Margrave.  \"Do  you fear the good faith of my swarthy attendants?\"    \"Nay, take the hatchet yourself; its use is to sever the gold from  the quartz in which we may find it imbedded, or to clear, as this  shovel, which will also be needed, from the slight soil above it,  the ore that the mine in the mountain flings forth, as the sea  casts its waifs on the sands.\"    \"Give me your hand, fellow laborer!\" said Margrave, joyfully.  \"Ah,  there is no faltering terror in this pulse!  I was not mistaken in  the man.  What rests, but the place and the hour?--I shall live, I  shall live!\"      III      Margrave now entered the litter, and the Veiled Woman drew the  black curtains round him.  I walked on, as the guide, some yards in  advance.  The air was still, heavy, and parched with the breath of  the Australasian sirocco.    We passed through the meadow lands, studded with slumbering flocks;  we followed the branch of the creek, which was linked to its source  in the mountains by many a trickling waterfall; we threaded the  gloom of stunted, misshapen trees, gnarled with the stringy bark  which makes one of the signs of the strata that nourish gold; and  at length the moon, now in all her pomp of light, mid-heaven among  her subject stars, gleamed through the fissures of the cave, on  whose floor lay the relics of antediluvian races, and rested in one  flood of silvery splendor upon the hollows of the extinct volcano,  with tufts of dank herbage, and wide spaces of paler sward,  covering the gold below--gold, the dumb symbol of organized  Matter's great mystery, storing in itself, according as Mind, the  informer of Matter, can distinguish its uses, evil and good, bane  and blessing.    Hitherto the Veiled Woman had remained in the rear, with the white-  robed, skeletonlike image that had crept to my side unawares with  its noiseless step.  Thus, in each winding turn of the difficult  path at which the convoy following behind me came into sight, I had  seen, first, the two gayly dressed, armed men, next the black,  bierlike litter, and last the Black-veiled Woman and the White-  robed Skeleton.    But now, as I halted on the tableland, backed by the mountain and  fronting the valley, the woman left her companion, passed by the  litter and the armed men, and paused by my side, at the mouth of  the moonlit cavern.    There for a moment she stood, silent, the procession below mounting  upward laboriously and slow; then she turned to me, and her veil  was withdrawn.    The face on which I gazed was wondrously beautiful, and severely  awful.  There was neither youth nor age, but beauty, mature and  majestic as that of a marble Demeter.    \"Do you believe in that which you seek?\" she asked in her foreign,  melodious, melancholy accents.    \"I have no belief,\" was my answer.  \"True science has none.  True  science questions all things, takes nothing upon credit.  It knows  but three states of the mind--denial, conviction, and that vast  interval between the two which is not belief but suspense of  judgment.\"    The woman let fall her veil, moved from me, and seated herself on a  crag above that cleft between mountain and creek, to which, when I  had first discovered the gold that the land nourished, the rain  from the clouds had given the rushing life of the cataract; but  which now, in the drought and the hush of the skies, was but a dead  pile of stones.    The litter now ascended the height: its bearers halted; a lean hand  tore the curtains aside, and Margrave descended leaning, this time,  not on the Black-veiled Woman, but on the White-robed Skeleton.    There, as he stood, the moon shone full on his wasted form; on his  face, resolute, cheerful, and proud, despite its hollowed outlines  and sicklied hues.  He raised his head, spoke in the language  unknown to me, and the armed men and the litter bearers grouped  round him, bending low, their eyes fixed on the ground.  The Veiled  Woman rose slowly and came to his side, motioning away, with a mute  sign, the ghastly form on which he leaned, and passing round him  silently, instead, her own sustaining arm.  Margrave spoke again a  few sentences, of which I could not even guess the meaning.  When  he had concluded, the armed men and the litter bearers came nearer  to his feet, knelt down, and kissed his hand.  They then rose, and  took from the bierlike vehicle the coffer and the fuel.  This done,  they lifted again the litter, and again, preceded by the armed men,  the procession descended down the sloping hillside, down into the  valley below.    Margrave now whispered, for some moments, into the ear of the  hideous creature who had made way for the Veiled Woman.  The grim  skeleton bowed his head submissively, and strode noiselessly away  through the long grasses--the slender stems, trampled under his  stealthy feet, relifting themselves as after a passing wind.  And  thus he, too, sank out of sight down into the valley below.  On the  tableland of the hill remained only we three--Margrave, myself, and  the Veiled Woman.    She had reseated herself apart, on the gray crag above the dried  torrent.  He stood at the entrance of the cavern, round the sides  of which clustered parasital plants, with flowers of all colors,  some among them opening their petals and exhaling their fragrance  only in the hours of night; so that, as his form filled up the jaws  of the dull arch, obscuring the moonbeam that strove to pierce the  shadows that slept within, it stood now--wan and blighted--as I had  seen it first, radiant and joyous, literally \"framed in blooms.\"      IV      \"So,\" said Margrave, turning to me, \"under the soil that spreads  around us lies the gold which to you and to me is at this moment of  no value, except as a guide to its twin-born--the regenerator of  life!\"    \"You have not yet described to me the nature of the substance which  we are to explore, nor the process by which the virtues you impute  to it are to be extracted.\"    \"Let us first find the gold, and instead of describing the life-  amber, so let me call it, I will point it out to your own eyes.  As  to the process, your share in it is so simple that you will ask me  why I seek aid from a chemist.  The life-amber, when found, has but  to be subjected to heat and fermentation for six hours; it will be  placed in a small caldron which that coffer contains, over the fire  which that fuel will feed.  To give effect to the process, certain  alkalies and other ingredients are required; but these are  prepared, and mine is the task to commingle them.  From your  science as chemist I need and ask naught.  In you I have sought  only the aid of a man.\"    \"If that be so, why, indeed, seek me at all?  Why not confide in  those swarthy attendants, who doubtless are slaves to your orders?\"    \"Confide in slaves, when the first task enjoined to them would be  to discover, and refrain from purloining gold!  Seven such  unscrupulous knaves,"]]]
