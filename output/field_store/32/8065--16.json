We are probably wise in not giving too much  credit to the fragmentary tablet which assigns to it a dynasty of  kings, of which we have no confirmatory information from other  sources--Amilgula, Shamashnazir, Amilsin, and several others: this list,  however, places among these phantom rulers one individual at least,  Shargina-Sharrukin, who has left us material evidences of his existence.  This Sargon the Elder, whose complete name is Shargani-shar-ali, was  the son of a certain Ittibel, who does not appear to have been king.  At first his possessions were confined to the city of Agade and some  undetermined portions of the environs of Babylon, but he soon succeeded  in annexing Babylon itself, Sippara, Kishu, Uruk, Kuta, and Nipur: the  contemporary records attest his conquest of Elam, Guti, and even of the  far-off land of Syria, which was already known to him under the name of  Amuru. His activity as a builder was in no way behind his warlike zeal.  He built Ekur, the sanctuary of Bel in Nipur, and the great temple  Eulbar in Agade, in honour of Anunit, the goddess presiding over the  morning star. He erected in Babylon a palace which afterwards became a  royal burying-place. He founded a new capital, a city which he peopled  with families brought from Kishu and Babylon: for a long time after his  day it bore the name which he bestowed upon it, Dur-Sharrukin. This  sums up all the positive knowledge we have about him, and the later  Chaldseans seem not to have been much better informed than ourselves.         * The earliest Assyriologists, H. Rawlinson, Oppert,       considered the local kings as having been, for the most       part, kings of all Chaldaea, and placed them in succession       one after the other in the framework of the most ancient       dynasties of Berossus. The merit of having established the       existence of series of local dynasties, and of having given       to Chaldaean history its modern form, belongs to G. Smith.       Smith's idea was adopted by Menant, by Delitzsch-Murdter, by       Tiele, by Winckler, and by all Assyriologists, with       modifications suggested by the progress of decipherment.    They filled up the lacunae of his history with legends. As he seemed  to them to have appeared suddenly on the scene, without any apparent  connection with the king who preceded him, they assumed that he was a  usurper of unknown origin, irregularly introduced by the favour of the  gods into the lawful series of kings. An inscription engraved, it was  said, on one of his statues, and afterwards, about the VIIth century  B.C., copied and deposited in the library of Nineveh, related at length  the circumstances of his mysterious birth. \"Sharrukin, the mighty king,  the king of Agade, am I. My mother was a princess; my father, I did not  know him; the brother of my father lived in the mountains. My town was  Azupirani, which is situated on the bank of the Euphrates. My mother,  the princess, conceived me, and secretly gave birth to me: she placed  me in a basket of reeds, she shut up the mouth of it with bitumen, she  abandoned me to the river, which did not overwhelm me. The river bore  me; it brought me to Akki, the drawer of water. Akki, the drawer of  water, received me in the goodness of his heart; Akki, the drawer of  water, made me a gardener. As gardener, the goddess Ishtar loved me, and  during forty-four years I held royal sway; I commanded the Black Heads,*  and ruled them.\" This is no unusual origin for the founders of empires  and dynasties; witness the cases of Cyrus and Bomulus.* Sargon, like  Moses, and many other heroes of history or fable, is exposed to the  waters: he owes his safety to a poor fellah who works his shadouf on the  banks of the Euphrates to water the fields, and he passes his infancy in  obscurity, if not in misery. Having reached the age of manhood, Ishtar  falls in love with him as she did with his fellow-craftsman, the  gardener Ishullanu, and he becomes king, we know not by what means.         * The phrase \"Black Heads,\" _nishi salmat hahhadi_, has been       taken in an ethnological sense as designating one of the       races of Chaldaea, the Semitic; other Assyriologists consider       it as denoting mankind in general. The latter meaning seems       the more probable.         ** Smith had already compared the infancy of Sargon with       that of Moses; the comparison with Cyrus, Bacchus, and       Romulus was made by Talbot. Traditions of the same kind are       frequent in history or folk-tales.    The same inscription which reveals the romance of his youth, recounts  the successes of his manhood, and boasts of the uniformly victorious  issue of his warlike exploits. Owing to lacunae, the end of the account  is in the main wanting, and we are thus prevented from following the  development of his career, but other documents come to the rescue and  claim to furnish its most important vicissitudes. He had reduced the  cities of the Lower Euphrates, the island of Dilmun, Durilu, Elam, the  country of Kazalla: he had invaded Syria, conquered Phoenicia, crossed  the arm of the sea which separates Cyprus from the coast, and only  returned to his palace after an absence of three years, and after having  erected his statues on the Syrian coast. He had hardly settled down to  rest when a rebellion broke out suddenly; the chiefs of Chaldaea formed  a league against him, and blockaded him in Agade: Ishtar, exceptionally  faithful to the end, obtains for him the victory, and he comes out of a  crisis, in which he might have been utterly ruined, with a more secure  position than ever. All these events are regarded as having occurred  sometime about 3800 B.C., at a period when the VIth dynasty was  flourishing in Egypt. Some of them have been proved to be true by recent  discoveries, and the rest are not at all improbable in themselves,  though the work in which they are recorded is a later astrological  treatise. The writer was anxious to prove, by examples drawn from the  chronicles, the use of portents of victory or defeat, of civic peace  or rebellion--portents which he deduced from the configuration of the  heavens on the various days of the month: by going back as far as Sargon  of Agade for his instances, he must have at once increased the respect  for himself on account of his knowledge of antiquity, and the difficulty  which the common herd must have felt in verifying his assertions. His  zeal in collecting examples was probably stimulated by the fact that  some of the exploits which he attributes to the ancient Sargon had been  recently accomplished by a king of the same name: the brilliant career  of Sargon of Agade would seem to have been in his estimation something  like an anticipation of the still more glorious life of the Sargon of  Nineveh.* What better proof of the high veneration in which the learned  men of Assyria held the memory of the ancient Chaldaean conqueror?  Naramsin, who succeeded Sargon about 3750 B.C.** inherited his  authority, and to some extent his renown.         * Hommel (Gescamede, p. 307) believes that the life of our       Sargon was modelled, not on the Assyrian Sargon, but on a       second Sargon, whom he places about 2000 B.C. Tiele refuses       to accept the hypothesis, but his objections are not       weighty, in my opinion; Hilprecht and Sayce accepted the       authenticity of the facts in their details, and the recent       discoveries have shown that they were right in so doing.       There is a distant resemblance between the life of the       legendary Sargon and the account of the victories of Ramses       II. ending in a conspiracy on his return.           ** The date of Naramsin is given us by the cylinder of       Nabonidos, who is cited lower down. It was discovered by       Pinches. Its authenticity is maintained by Oppert, by       Latrille, by Tiele, by Hommel, who felt at first some       hesitation, by Delitzsch-Murdter; it has been called in       question, with hesitation, by Ed. Meyer, and more boldly by       Winckler. There is at present no serious reason to question       its accuracy, at least relatively, except the instinctive       repugnance of modern critics to consider as legitimate,       dates which carry them back further into the past than they       are accustomed to go.    The astrological tablets assert that he attacked the city of Apirak, on  the borders of Elam, killed the Sing, Rish-ramman, and led the people  away into slavery. He conquered at least part, if not the whole of Elam,  and one of the few monuments which have come down to us was raised at  Sippara in commemoration of his prowess against the mountaineers of the  Zagros. He is represented on it overpowering their chief: his warriors  follow after him and charge up the hill, carrying everything before  their steady onslaught. Another of his warlike expeditions is said to  have had as its field of operations a district of Magan, which, in the  view of the writer, undoubtedly represented the Sinaitic Peninsula and  perhaps Egypt. This expedition against Magan no doubt took place, and  one of the few monuments of Naramsin which have reached us refers to it.  Other inscriptions tell us incidentally that Naramsin reigned over the  \"four Houses of the world,\" Babylon, Sippara, Nipur, and Lagash. Like  his father, he had worked at the building of the Ekur of Nipur and the  Bulbar of Agade; he erected, moreover, at his own cost, the temple  of the Sun at Sippara.* The latter passed through many and varied  vicissitudes. Restored, enlarged, ruined on several occasions, the date  of its construction and the name of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17324"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 4 (of 12) (#15)"],[1,"legends of the race  placed the cradle of the Phoenicians; it was even believed, about the  time of Alexander, that the earliest ruins attributable to this people  had been discovered on the Bahrein Islands, the largest of which, Tylos  and Arados, bore names resembling the two great ports of Tyre and Arvad.  We are indebted to tradition for the cause of their emigration and the  route by which they reached the Mediterranean. The occurrence of violent  earthquakes forced them to leave their home; they travelled as far as  the Lake of Syria, where they halted for some time; then resuming their  march, did not rest till they had reached the sea, where they founded  Sidon. The question arises as to the position of the Lake of Syria on  whose shores they rested, some believing it to be the Bahr-i-Nedjif  and the environs of Babylon; others, the Lake of Bambykes near the  Euphrates, the emigrants doubtless having followed up the course of that  river, and having approached the country of their destination on its  north-eastern frontier. Another theory would seek to identify the lake  with the waters of Merom, the Lake of Galilee, or the Dead Sea; in this  case the horde must have crossed the neck of the Arabian peninsula,  from the Euphrates to the Jordan, through one of those long valleys,  sprinkled with oases, which afforded an occasional route for caravans.*  Several writers assure us that the Phoenician tradition of this exodus  was misunderstood by Herodotus, and that the sea which they remembered  on reaching Tyre was not the Persian Gulf, but the Dead Sea. If this had  been the case, they need not have hesitated to assign their departure to  causes mentioned in other documents. The Bible tells us that, soon after  the invasion of Kudur-lagamar, the anger of God being kindled by the  wickedness of Sodom and Gomorrah, He resolved to destroy the five cities  situated in the valley of Siddim. A cloud of burning brimstone broke  over them and consumed them; when the fumes and smoke, as \"of a  furnace,\" had passed away, the very site of the towns had disappeared.**  Previous to their destruction, the lake into which the Jordan empties  itself had had but a restricted area: the subsidence of the southern  plain, which had been occupied by the impious cities, doubled the size  of the lake, and enlarged it to its present dimensions. The earthquake  which caused the Phoenicians to leave their ancestral home may have been  the result of this cataclysm, and the sea on whose shores they sojourned  would thus be our Dead Sea.         * They would thus have arrived at the shores of Lake Merom,       or at the shores either of the Dead Sea or of the Lake of       Gennesareth; the Arab traditions speak of an itinerary which       would have led the emigrants across the desert, but they       possess no historic value is so far as these early epochs       are concerned.         ** _Gen._ xix. 24-29; the whole of this episode belongs to       the Jehovistic narrative.    One fact, however, appears to be certain in the midst of many  hypotheses, and that is that the Phoenicians had their origin in the  regions bordering on the Persian Gulf. It is useless to attempt, with  the inadequate materials as yet in our possession, to determine by what  route they reached the Syrian coast, though we may perhaps conjecture  the period of their arrival. Herodotus asserts that the Tyrians placed  the date of the foundation of their principal temple two thousand  three hundred years before the time of his visit, and the erection of a  sanctuary for their national deity would probably take place very soon  after their settlement at Tyre: this would bring their arrival there to  about the XXVIIIth century before our era. The Elamite and Babylonian  conquests would therefore have found the Phoenicians already established  in the country, and would have had appreciable effect upon them.    The question now arises whether the Beni-Israel belonged to the group of  tribes which included the Phoenicians, or whether they were of Chaldaean  race. Their national traditions leave no doubt upon that point. They are  regarded as belonging to an important race, which we find dispersed over  the country of Padan-Aram, in Northern Mesopotamia, near the base of  Mount Masios, and extending on both sides of the Euphrates.*         * The country of Padan-Aram is situated between the       Euphrates and the upper reaches of the Khabur, on both sides       of the Balikh, and is usually explained as the \"plain\" or       \"table-land\" of Aram, though the etymology is not certain;       the word seems to be preserved in that of Tell-Faddan, near       Harran.    Their earliest chiefs bore the names of towns or of peoples,--N  akhor, Peleg, and Serug:* all were descendants of Arphaxad,** and it  was related that Terakh, the direct ancestor of the Israelites, had  dwelt in Ur-Kashdim, the Ur or Uru of the Chaldaeans.*** He is said to  have had three sons--Abraham, Nakhor, and Haran. Haran begat Lot, but  died before his father in Ur-Kashdim, his own country; Abraham and  Nakhor both took wives, but Abraham's wife remained a long time barren.  Then Terakh, with his son Abraham, his grandson Lot, the son of Haran,  and his daughter-in-law Sarah,**** went forth from Ur-Kashdim (Ur of the  Chaldees) to go into the land of Canaan.         * Nakhor has been associated with the ancient village of       Khaura, or with the ancient village of Haditha-en-Naura, to       the south of Anah; Peleg probably corresponds with Phalga or       Phaliga, which was situated at the mouth of the Khabur;       Serug with the present Sarudj in the neighbourhood of       Edessa, and the other names in the genealogy were probably       borrowed from as many different localities.         ** The site of Arphaxad is doubtful, as is also its meaning:       its second element is undoubtedly the name of the Chaldaeans,       but the first is interpreted in several ways--\"frontier of       the Chaldaeans,\" \"domain of the Chaldaeans.\" The similarity of       sound was the cause of its being for a long time associated       with the Arrapakhitis of classical times; the tendency is       now to recognise in it the country nearest to the ancient       domain of the Chaldaeans, i.e. Babylonia proper.         *** Ur-Kashdim has long been sought for in the north, either       at Orfa, in accordance with the tradition of the Syrian       Churches still existing in the East, or in a certain Ur of       Mesopotamia, placed by Ammianus Marcellinus between Nisibis       and the Tigris; at the present day Halevy still looks for it       on the Syrian bank of the Euphrates, to the south-east of       Thapsacus. Rawlin-son's proposal to identify it with the       town of Uru has been successively accepted by nearly all       Assyriologists. Sayce remarks that the worship of Sin, which       was common to both towns, established a natural link between       them, and that an inhabitant of Uru would have felt more at       home in Harran than in any other town.         **** The names of Sarah and Abraham, or rather the earlier       form, Abram, have been found, the latter under the form       Abiramu, in the contracts of the first Chaldaean empire.    And they came unto Kharan, and dwelt there, and Terakh died in Kharan.*  It is a question whether Kharan is to be identified with Harran in  Mesopotamia, the city of the god Sin; or, which is more probable, with  the Syrian town of Hauran, in the neighbourhood of Damascus. The tribes  who crossed the Euphrates became subsequently a somewhat important  people. They called themselves, or were known by others, as the 'Ibrim,  or Hebrews, the people from beyond the river;** and this appellation,  which we are accustomed to apply to the children of Israel only,  embraced also, at the time when the term was most extended, the  Ammonites, Moabites, Edomites, Ishmaelites, Midianites, and many other  tribes settled on the borders of the desert to the east and south of the  Dead Sea.         * Gen. xi. 27-32. In the opinion of most critics, verses 27,       31 32 form part of the document which was the basis of the       various narratives still traceable in the Bible; it is       thought that the remaining verses bear the marks of a later       redaction, or that they may be additions of a later date.       The most important part of the text, that relating the       migration from Ur-Kashdim to Kharan, belongs, therefore, to       the very oldest part of the national tradition, and may be       regarded as expressing the knowledge which the Hebrews of       the times of the Kings possessed concerning the origin of       their race.         ** The most ancient interpretation identified this nameless       river with the Euphrates; an identification still admitted       by most critics; others prefer to recognise it as being the       Jordan. Halevy prefers to identify it with one of the rivers       of Damascus, probably the Abana.    These peoples all traced their descent from Abraham, the son of Terakh,  but the children of Israel claimed the privilege of being the only  legitimate issue of his marriage with Sarah, giving naive or derogatory  accounts of the relations which connected the others with their common  ancestor; Ammon and Moab were, for instance, the issue of the incestuous  union of Lot and his daughters. Midian and his sons were descended from  Keturah, who was merely a concubine, Ishmael was the son of an Egyptian  slave, while the \"hairy\" Esau had sold his birthright and the primacy of  the Edomites to his brother Jacob, and consequently to the Israelites,  for a dish of lentils. Abraham left Kharan at the command of Jahveh, his  God, receiving from Him a promise that his posterity should be blessed  above all others. Abraham pursued his way into the heart of Canaan  till he reached Shechem, and there, under the oaks of Moreh, Jahveh,  appearing to him a"]]]
