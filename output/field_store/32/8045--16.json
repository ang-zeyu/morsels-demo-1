Another specimen made within a few months and  supposed to be permanent has changed to brown. Complete exclusion of  air and light is certainly favorable to permanence.    _Physical Condition._--The brittleness of the substances B and C, the  facility with which they can be reduced to the finest powder, makes a  striking point of difference between allotropic and normal silver. It  is probable that normal silver, precipitated in fine powder and set  aside moist to dry gradually, may cohere into brittle lumps, but these  would be mere aggregations of discontinuous material. With allotropic  silver the case is very different, the particles dry in optical  contact with each other, the surfaces are brilliant, and the material  evidently continuous. That this should be brittle indicates a totally  different state of molecular constitution from that of normal silver.    _Specific Gravities._--The allotropic forms of silver show a lower  specific gravity than that of normal silver.    In determining the specific gravities it was found essential to keep  the sp. gr. bottle after placing the material in it for some hours  under the bell of an air pump. Films of air attach themselves  obstinately to the surfaces, and escape but slowly even in vacuo.    Taken with this precaution, the blue substance, B, gave specific  gravity 9.58, and the yellow substance, C, specific gravity 8.51. The  specific gravity of normal silver, after melting, was found by G. Rose  to be 10.5. That of finely divided silver obtained by precipitation is  stated to be 10.62.[1]       [Footnote 1: Watts' Dict., orig. ed., v. 277.]    I believe these determinations to be exact for the specimens employed.  But the condition of aggregation may not improbably vary somewhat in  different specimens. It seems, however, clear that these forms of  silver have a lower specific gravity than the normal, and this is what  would be expected.    Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, May, 1889.    --_Amer. Jour. of Science._           *       *       *       *       *          TURPENTINE AND ITS PRODUCTS.[1]       [Footnote 1: Read at a meeting of the Liverpool Chemists'     Association.]    By EDWARD DAVIES, F.C.S., F.I.C.      In treating this subject it is necessary to limit it within  comparatively narrow bounds, for bodies of the turpentine class are  exceedingly numerous and not well understood. In this definite class  turpentine means the exudation from various trees of the natural order  Coniferae, consisting of a hydrocarbon, C10 H16, and a resin. The  constitution of the hydrocarbons in turpentine from different sources,  though identical chemically, varies physically, the boiling point  ranging from 156 deg. C. to 163 deg. C., the density from 0.855 to 0.880, and  the action on polarized light from -40.3 to +21.5. They are very  unstable bodies in their molecular constitution, heat, sulphuric acid,  and other reagents modifying their properties. The resins are also  very variable bodies formed probably by oxidation of the hydrocarbons,  and as this oxidation is more or less complete, mixtures are formed  very difficult to separate and study.    Turpentine as met with in commerce is mainly derived from _Pinus  maritima_, yielding French turpentine, and _Pinus australis_,  furnishing most of the American turpentine. The latter is obtained  from North and South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama. In Hanbury and  Fluckiger's Pharmacographia there is a full description of the manner  in which the trees are wounded to obtain the turpentine. Besides these  there are Venice turpentine from the larch, _Pinus Larix_, Strassburg  turpentine from _Abies pectinata_, and Canada balsam from _Pinus  balsamea_.    The crude American turpentine is a viscid liquid of about the  consistence of honey, but varying to a soft solid, known as gum, thus,  according to the amount of exposure which it has undergone, it  contains about 10 to 25 per cent. of \"spirits,\" to which the name of  turpentine is commonly given, the rest being resin, or as it is  usually called, rosin.    In Liverpool almost all the spirits of turpentine comes from America,  so that it is almost impossible to get a sample of French.    The terpene from American turpentine is called austraterebenthene. It  possesses dextro-rotatory polarization of +21.5. Its density is 0.864.  Boiling point 156 deg. C.    In taking the boiling point of a commercial sample of spirits it is  necessary to wait until the thermometer becomes steady. Not more than  5 per cent. should pass over before this takes place, and then there  is not more than two or three degrees of rise until almost all is  distilled over.    The liquids of lower boiling point do not appear to have been much  studied. In French spirits they seem to be of the same composition as  the main product, but with more action on polarized light.    French spirits of turpentine is mainly composed of terebenthene. The  boiling point and sp. gr. are the same as those of the austraterebenthene,  but the polarization is left handed and amounts to -40.5.    Isomeric modifications. Heated to 300 deg. C. in a sealed tube for two  hours, it becomes an isomeric compound, boiling at 175 deg. C., while the  density is lowered, being only 0.8586 at 0 deg. C. The rotatory power is  only -9 deg.. It oxidizes much more rapidly. It is called isoterebenthene  and has a smell of essential oil of lemons.    By the action of a small quantity of sulphuric acid, among other  products terebene is formed. It has the same boiling point and sp. gr.  as terebenthene, but is without action on polarized light.  Austraterebenthene forms similar if not identical bodies.    Polymers. One part of boron fluoride BF3 instantly converts 160  parts of terebenthene into polymers boiling above 300 deg. C., and  optically inactive. H2 SO4 does the same on heating and forms  diterebene C20 H32.    Terchloride of antimony does the same, and also produces tetraterebene  C40H64, a solid brittle compound formed by the union of four  molecules of C10 H16. It does not boil below 350 deg. C. and  decomposes on heating.    Compound with H2O. Terpin C10 H18 2HO is formed when 1 volume  of spirits of turpentine is mixed with 6 of nitric acid and 1 of  alcohol, and exposed to air for some weeks. Crystals are formed which  are pressed, decolorized by animal charcoal, and recrystallized from  boiling water.    Compounds with HCl. When a slow current of HCl is passed through  cooled spirits of turpentine, two isomeric compounds are formed, one  solid, and one liquid. The lower the temperature is kept, the more of  the solid body is produced. To obtain the solid body pure it is  pressed and recrystallized from ether or alcohol. It is volatile and  has the odor of camphor. It is called artificial camphor, and has the  composition C10 H16 HCl. There is also a compound with 2HCl.    Oxidation products. By passing air into spirits of turpentine oxygen  is absorbed. It was thought at one time that ozone was produced, but  Kingzett's view is that camphoric peroxide is formed C10 H14 O4,  and that in presence of water it decomposes into camphoric acid and  H2 O2. This liquid constitutes the disinfectant known as  \"sanitas,\" which possesses the advantages of a pleasant smell and  non-poisonous properties. C10 H18 O2 may be obtained by  exposing spirits of turpentine in a flask full of oxygen with a little  water.    Camphor C16 H16 O has been made in small quantity by oxidizing spirits  of turpentine. Terebenthene belongs to the benzene or aromatic series,  which can be shown from its connection with cymene. Cymene is  methylpropyl-benzene, and can be made from terpenes by removing two  atoms of H. It has not yet been converted again into terpene, but the  connection is sufficiently proved. The presence of CH3 in terpenes is  shown by their yielding chloroform when distilled with bleaching  powder and water. The resin is imperfectly known. It was supposed to  consist of picric and sylvic acids. It is also stated to contain  abietic anhydride C44 H62 O4, but it is difficult to understand how a  compound containing C44 can be produced from C10 H16. The most  probable view is that it is the anhydride of sylvic acid, which is  probably C20 H30 O2.    The dark colored resin which is obtained when the turpentine is  distilled without water can be converted into a transparent slightly  yellow body by distillation with superheated steam. A small portion is  decomposed, but the greater part distills unchanged. It is used in  making soap which will lather with sea water.    When distilled alone, various hydrocarbons, resin oil and resin pitch,  are obtained.    I find that commercial spirits of turpentine varies in sp. gr. from  0.865 to 0.869 at 15 deg. C. The higher sp. gr. appears to be connected  with the presence of resinous bodies, the result of oxidation. The  boiling point is very uniform, ranging from 155 deg. C. to 157 deg. C. at 760  mm. Taking these two points together, it is hardly possible to  adulterate spirits of turpentine without detection. I give the figures  for a few imitations or adulterations:                                  Sp. gr.   B.P.    No. 1                        0.821  137 deg. C.

There is a considerable difference in the flashing point, no doubt due  to the longer or shorter exposure of the crude turpentine, by which  more or less of the volatile portion escapes.           *       *       *       *       *          ON THE OCCURRENCE OF PARAFFINE IN CRUDE PETROLEUM.[1]       [Footnote 1: An"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16983"],[0,"The Kitáb-i-Íqán (#15)"],[1,"re. Let it  now be seen what thy search and endeavours will achieve.    To resume: Our purpose in setting forth these truths hath been to  demonstrate the sovereignty of Him Who is the King of kings. Be fair: Is  this sovereignty which, through the utterance of one Word, hath manifested  such pervading influence, ascendancy, and awful majesty, is this  sovereignty superior, or is the worldly dominion of these kings of the  earth who, despite their solicitude for their subjects and their help of  the poor, are assured only of an outward and fleeting allegiance, while in  the hearts of men they inspire neither affection nor respect? Hath not  that sovereignty, through the potency of one word, subdued, quickened, and  revitalized the whole world? What! Can the lowly dust compare with Him Who  is the Lord of Lords? What tongue dare utter the immensity of difference  that lieth between them? Nay, all comparison falleth short in attaining  the hallowed sanctuary of His sovereignty. Were man to reflect, he would  surely perceive that even the servant of His threshold ruleth over all  created things! This hath already been witnessed, and will in future be  made manifest.    This is but one of the meanings of the spiritual sovereignty which We have  set forth in accordance with the capacity and receptiveness of the people.  For He, the Mover of all beings, that glorified Countenance, is the source  of such potencies as neither this wronged One can reveal, nor this  unworthy people comprehend. Immensely exalted is He above men's praise of  His sovereignty; glorified is He beyond that which they attribute unto  Him!    And now, ponder this in thine heart: Were sovereignty to mean earthly  sovereignty and worldly dominion, were it to imply the subjection and  external allegiance of all the peoples and kindreds of the earth--whereby  His loved ones should be exalted and be made to live in peace, and His  enemies be abased and tormented--such form of sovereignty would not be true  of God Himself, the Source of all dominion, Whose majesty and power all  things testify. For, dost thou not witness how the generality of mankind  is under the sway of His enemies? Have they not all turned away from the  path of His good-pleasure? Have they not done that which He hath  forbidden, and left undone, nay repudiated and opposed, those things which  He hath commanded? Have not His friends ever been the victims of the  tyranny of His foes? All these things are more obvious than even the  splendour of the noon-tide sun.    Know, therefore, O questioning seeker, that earthly sovereignty is of no  worth, nor will it ever be, in the eyes of God and His chosen Ones.  Moreover, if ascendency and dominion be interpreted to mean earthly  supremacy and temporal power, how impossible will it be for thee to  explain these verses: \"And verily Our host shall conquer.\"(92) \"Fain would  they put out God's light with their mouths: But God hath willed to perfect  His light, albeit the infidels abhor it.\"(93) \"He is the Dominant, above  all things.\" Similarly, most of the Qur'an testifieth to this truth.    Were the idle contention of these foolish and despicable souls to be true,  they would have none other alternative than to reject all these holy  utterances and heavenly allusions. For no warrior could be found on earth  more excellent and nearer to God than Husayn, son of 'Ali, so peerless and  incomparable was he. \"There was none to equal or to match him in the  world.\" Yet, thou must have heard what befell him. \"God's malison on the  head of the people of tyranny!\"(94)    Were the verse \"And verily Our host shall conquer\" to be literally  interpreted, it is evident that it would in no wise be applicable to the  chosen Ones of God and His hosts, inasmuch as Husayn, whose heroism was  manifest as the sun, crushed and subjugated, quaffed at last the cup of  martyrdom in Karbila, the land of Taff. Similarly, the sacred verse \"Fain  would they put out God's light with their mouths: But God hath willed to  perfect His light, albeit the infidels abhor it.\" Were it to be literally  interpreted it would never correspond with the truth. For in every age the  light of God hath, to outward seeming, been quenched by the peoples of the  earth, and the Lamps of God extinguished by them. How then could the  ascendancy of the sovereignty of these Lamps be explained? What could the  potency of God's will to \"perfect His light\" signify? As hath already been  witnessed, so great was the enmity of the infidels, that none of these  divine Luminaries ever found a place for shelter, or tasted of the cup of  tranquillity. So heavily were they oppressed, that the least of men  inflicted upon these Essences of being whatsoever he listed. These  sufferings have been observed and measured by the people. How, therefore,  can such people be capable of understanding and expounding these words of  God, these verses of everlasting glory?    But the purpose of these verses is not what they have imagined. Nay, the  terms \"ascendancy,\" \"power,\" and \"authority\" imply a totally different  station and meaning. For instance, consider the pervading power of those  drops of the blood of Husayn which besprinkled the earth. What ascendancy  and influence hath the dust itself, through the sacredness and potency of  that blood, exercised over the bodies and souls of men! So much so, that  he who sought deliverance from his ills, was healed by touching the dust  of that holy ground, and whosoever, wishing to protect his property,  treasured with absolute faith and understanding, a little of that holy  earth within his house, safeguarded all his possessions. These are the  outward manifestations of its potency. And were We to recount its hidden  virtues they would assuredly say: \"He verily hath considered the dust to  be the Lord of Lords, and hath utterly forsaken the Faith of God.\"    Furthermore, call to mind the shameful circumstances that have attended  the martyrdom of Husayn. Reflect upon his loneliness, how, to outer  seeming, none could be found to aid him, none to take up his body and bury  it. And yet, behold how numerous, in this day, are those who from the  uttermost corners of the earth don the garb of pilgrimage, seeking the  site of his martyrdom, that there they may lay their heads upon the  threshold of his shrine! Such is the ascendancy and power of God! Such is  the glory of His dominion and majesty!    Think not that because these things have come to pass after Husayn's  martyrdom, therefore all this glory hath been of no profit unto him. For  that holy soul is immortal, liveth the life of God, and abideth within the  retreats of celestial glory upon the Sadrih of heavenly reunion. These  Essences of being are the shining Exemplars of sacrifice. They have  offered, and will continue to offer up their lives, their substance, their  souls, their spirit, their all, in the path of the Well-Beloved. By them,  no station, however exalted, could be more dearly cherished. For lovers  have no desire but the good-pleasure of their Beloved, and have no aim  except reunion with Him.    Should We wish to impart unto thee a glimmer of the mysteries of Husayn's  martyrdom, and reveal unto thee the fruits thereof, these pages could  never suffice, nor exhaust their meaning. Our hope is that, God willing,  the breeze of mercy may blow, and the divine Springtime clothe the tree of  being with the robe of a new life; so that we may discover the mysteries  of divine Wisdom, and, through His providence, be made independent of the  knowledge of all things. We have, as yet, descried none but a handful of  souls, destitute of all renown, who have attained unto this station. Let  the future disclose what the Judgment of God will ordain, and the  Tabernacle of His decree reveal. In such wise We recount unto thee the  wonders of the Cause of God, and pour out into thine ears the strains of  heavenly melody, that haply thou mayest attain unto the station of true  knowledge, and partake of the fruit thereof. Therefore, know thou of a  certainty that these Luminaries of heavenly majesty, though their dwelling  be in the dust, yet their true habitation is the seat of glory in the  realms above. Though bereft of all earthly possessions, yet they soar in  the realms of immeasurable riches. And whilst sore tried in the grip of  the enemy, they are seated on the right hand of power and celestial  dominion. Amidst the darkness of their abasement there shineth upon them  the light of unfading glory, and upon their helplessness are showered the  tokens of an invincible sovereignty.    Thus Jesus, Son of Mary, whilst seated one day and speaking in the strain  of the Holy Spirit, uttered words such as these: \"O people! My food is the  grass of the field, wherewith I satisfy my hunger. My bed is the dust, my  lamp in the night the light of the moon, and my steed my own feet. Behold,  who on earth is richer than I?\" By the righteousness of God! Thousands of  treasures circle round this poverty, and a myriad kingdoms of glory yearn  for such abasement! Shouldst thou attain to a drop of the ocean of the  inner meaning of these words, thou wouldst surely forsake the world and  all that is therein, and, as the Phoenix wouldst consume thyself in the  flames of the undying Fire.    In like manner, it is related that on a certain day, one of the companions  of Sadiq complained of his poverty before him. Whereupon, Sadiq, that  immortal beauty, made reply: \"Verily thou art rich, and hast drunk the  draught of wealth.\" That poverty-stricken soul was perplexed at the words  uttered by that luminous countenance, and said: \"Where are my riches, I  who stand in need of a single coin?\" Sadiq thereupon observed: \"Dost thou  not possess our love?\" He replied: \"Yea, I possess it, O thou scion of the  Prophet of God!\" And Sadiq asked him saying: \"Exchangest thou this love  for one thousand dinars?\" He answered: \"Nay, never will I"]]]
