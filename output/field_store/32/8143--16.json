[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19116"],[0,"How to Sing (#15)"],[1,"syllable often  unites three vowels; for instance, \"tuoi\" (tuoy[=e]), \"miei\"  (myeay[=e]), \"muoja,\" etc.    The Italians mingle all their vowels. They rub them into and color  them with each other. This includes a great portion of the art of  song, which in every language, with due regard to its peculiar  characteristics, must be learned by practice.    To give only a single example of the difficulty of the German words,  with the everlasting consonant endings to the syllables, take the  recitative at the entrance of Norma:--    \"Wer laesst hier Aufruhrstimme_n_, Kriegsruf ertoene_n_, wollt Ihr die  Goetter zwinge_n_, Eurem Wahnwitz zu froehne_n_? Wer wagt vermesse_n_,  gleich der Propheti_n_ der Zukunft Nacht zu lichte_n_, wollt Ihr der  Goetter Pla_n_ vorschnell vernichte_n_? Nicht Menschenkraft Koenne_n_  die Wirre_n_ dieses Landes schlichte_n_.\"    Twelve endings on _n_!    \"Sediziosi voci, voci di guerra, avvi [Transcriber's Note: corrected  \"avoi\" in original] chi alzar si attenta presso all'ara del Dio! V'ha  chi presume dettar responsi alla vegente Norma, e di Roma affrettar il  fato arcano. Ei non dipende, no, non dipende da potere umano!\"    From the Italians we can learn the connection of the vowels, from the  French the use of the nasal tone. The Germans surpass the others in  their power of expressiveness. But he who would have the right to call  himself an artist must unite all these things; the _bel canto_, that  is, beautiful--I might say good--singing, and all the means of  expression which we cultivated people need to interpret master works  of great minds, should afford the public ennobling pleasure.    A tone full of life is to be produced only by the skilful mixture of  the vowels, that is, the unceasing leaning of one upon the others,  without, however, affecting any of its characteristics. This means, in  reality, only the complete use of the resonance of the breath, since  the mixture of the vowels can be obtained only through the elastic  conjunction of the organs and the varying division of the stream of  breath toward the palatal resonance, or that of the cavities of the  head, or the equalization of the two.    The larynx must rise and descend unimpeded by the tongue, soft palate  and pillars of the fauces rise and sink, the soft palate always able  more or less to press close to the hard. Strong and elastic  contractions imply very pliable and circumspect relaxation of the  same.    I think that the feeling I have of the extension of my throat comes  from the very powerful yet very elastic contraction of my muscles,  which, though feeling always in a state of relaxability, appear to me  like flexible steel, of which I can demand everything,--because never  too much,--and which I exercise daily. Even in the entr'actes of grand  operas I go through with such exercises; for they refresh instead of  exhausting me.    The unconstrained cooeperation of all the organs, as well as their  individual functions, must go on elastically without any pressure or  cramped action. Their interplay must be powerful yet supple, that the  breath which produces the tone may be diffused as it flows from one to  another of the manifold and complicated organs (such as the ventricles  of Morgagni), supporting itself on others, being caught in still  others, and finding all in such a state of readiness as is required in  each range for each tone. Everything must be combined in the right way  as a matter of habit.    The voice is equalized by the proper ramification of the breath and  the proper connection of the different resonances.    The tone is colored by the proper mixture of vowels; _oo_, _o_, and  _ah_ demanding more palatal resonance and a lower position of the  larynx, _a_ and _e_ more resonance of the head cavities and a higher  position of the larynx. With _oo_, _o_, _ue_, and _ah_ the palate is  arched higher (the tongue forming a furrow) than with _[=a]_, _[=e]_,  and _ue_, where the tongue lies high and flat.    There are singers who place the larynx too low, and, arching the  palate too high, sing too much toward _oo_. Such voices sound very  dark, perhaps even hollow; they lack the interposition of the  _[=a]_,--that is, the larynx is placed too low.    On the other hand, there are others who press it upward too high;  their _a_ position is a permanent one. Such voices are marked by a  very bright, sharp quality of tone, often like a goat's bleating.    Both are alike wrong and disagreeable. The proper medium between them  must be gained by sensitive training of the ear, and a taste formed by  the teacher through examples drawn from his own singing and that of  others.    If we wish to give a noble expression to the tone and the word, we  must mingle its vocal sound, if it is not so, with _o_ or _oo_. If we  wish to give the word merely an agreeable expression, we mingle it  with _ah_, _[=a]_, and _[=e]_. That is, we must use all the qualities  of tonal resonance, and thus produce colors which shall benefit the  tone and thereby the word and its expression.    Thus a single tone may be taken or sung in many different ways. In  every varying connection, consequently, the singer must be able to  change it according to the expression desired. But as soon as it is a  question of a _musical phrase_, in which several tones or words, or  tones alone, are connected, the law of progression must remain in  force; expression must be sacrificed, partly at least, to the beauty  of the musical passage.    If he is skilful enough, the singer can impart a certain expression of  feeling to even the most superficial phrases and coloratura passages.  Thus, in the coloratura passages of Mozart's arias, I have always  sought to gain expressiveness by _crescendi_, choice of significant  points for breathing, and breaking off of phrases. I have been  especially successful with this in the _Entfuehrung_, introducing a  tone of lament into the first aria, a heroic dignity into the second,  through the coloratura passages. Without exaggerating petty details,  the artist must exploit all the means of expression that he is  justified in using.          SECTION XXIX    AUXILIARY VOWELS      Like the auxiliary verbs \"will\" and \"have,\" _[=a]_, _[=e]_, and _oo_  are auxiliary vowels, of whose aid we are constantly compelled to  avail ourselves. It will perhaps sound exaggerated when I present an  example of this, but as a matter of fact pronunciation is consummated  in this way; only, it must not become noticeable. The method seems  singular, but its object is to prevent the leaving of any empty  resonance space, and to obviate any interruptions that could affect  the perfection of the tone.    For example, when I wish to sing the word \"Fraeulein,\" I must first,  and before all else, think of the pitch of the tone, before I attack  the _f_. With the _f_, the tone must be there already, _before_ I have  pronounced it; to pass from the _f_ to the _r_ I must summon to my  aid the auxiliary vowel _oo_, in order to prevent the formation of any  unvocalized interstices in the sound. The _r_ must not now drop off,  but must in turn be joined to the _oo_, while the tongue should not  drop down behind, [Illustration] but should complete the vibrations  thus, [Illustration] in a straight line. (See plate.)    [Illustration]    It is very interesting to note how much a word can gain or lose in  fulness and beauty of tone. Without the use of auxiliary vowels no  connection of the resonance in words can be effected; there is then no  beautiful tone in singing, only a kind of hacking. Since it must be  quite imperceptible, the use of auxiliary vowels must be very  artistically managed, and is best practised in the beginning very  slowly on single tones and words, then proceeding with great care to  two tones, two syllables, and so on. In this way the pupil learns to  _hear_. But he must learn to hear very slowly and for a long time,  until there is no failure of vibration in the tone and word, and it is  all so impressed upon his memory that it can never be lost. The  auxiliary vowels must always be present, but the listener should be  able to hear, from the assistance of the _oo_, only the warmth and  nobility of the tone, from the _a_ and _e_ only the carrying power and  brilliancy of it.          SECTION XXX    RESONANT CONSONANTS      _K_, _l_, _m_, _n_, _p_, _s_, and _r_ at the end of a word or syllable  must be made resonant by joining to the end of the word or syllable a  rather audible _[)e]_ (_eh_); for instance, Wandel^e, Gretel^e,  etc.    A thing that no one teaches any longer, or knows or is able to do, a  thing that only Betz and I knew, and with me will probably disappear  entirely, is the dividing and ending of syllables that must be  effected under certain conditions. It may have originated with the  Italian school.    I was taught it especially upon double consonants. When two come  together, they must be divided; the first, as in Him-mel, being  sounded dull, and without resonance, the syllable and tone being kept  as nasal as possible, the lips closed, and a pause being made between  the two syllables; not till then is the second syllable pronounced,  with a new formation of the second consonant.    And this is done, not only in case of a doubling of one consonant, but  whenever two consonants come together to close the syllable; for  instance, win-ter, dring-en, kling-en, bind-en; in these the nasal  sound plays a specially important part.    The tediousness of singing without proper separation of the syllables  is not appreciated till it has been learned how to divide the  consonants. The nasal close of itself brings a new color into the  singing, which must be taken into account; and moreover, the word is  much more clearly intelligible, especially in large auditoriums, where  an appreciable length of time is needed for it to reach the listener.  By the nasal close, also, an uninterrupted connection is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19138"],[0,"Resonance in Singing and Speaking (#15)"],[1,"of  Correct Breathing               Ange A.
