Robert Mowbray, Earl of Northumberland, gave the Priory of  Tynemouth, which he had founded, to the Abbey of St. Albans. Abbot Paul  died on his way home from a visit to this new priory, and was buried  magnificently in his own Abbey.    The \"Gesta Abbatum\" begins at this point to sum up the good and evil  deeds of the abbots. Among Paul's shortcomings the following are  mentioned: he lost property through negligence; he destroyed the tombs  of his English predecessors in the Abbey; he did not secure as he should  have done the bones of Offa for his new church; he alienated the woods  of Northame; he bestowed some of the property of the Abbey upon his  illiterate kinsfolk. Yet, on the whole, his good deeds outweighed his  evil ones. William II., after Paul's death, kept the Abbey in his own  hands for four years, using, as was his wont, the revenues for his own  advantage. His death in the New Forest was considered by the monks of  the Abbey as a special punishment for the extortion he had practised on  them.    15. #Richard d'Aubeny# or #d'Albini# (1097-1119). This Abbot, a Norman,  was a man of much influence, and during his rule the Abbey was very  prosperous. He presented many and valuable ornaments to the church: a  shrine wrought in gold for the relics of the apostles, which Germanus  had placed in St. Alban's coffin in the fifth century; another shrine of  ivory and gilt, for the relics of martyrs and saints; a great number of  vestments and many valuable books. During his time, 1104, the relics of  St. Cuthbert were translated from the temporary shrine which Bishop  Carileph had erected over them to the new Cathedral Church at Durham,  and Abbot Richard, as head of Tynemouth Priory, was present on that  occasion, and a miracle was worked upon him, for his withered arm was  cured by being brought into contact with St. Cuthbert's body. In  gratitude for this benefit, he built a chapel in honour of St. Cuthbert  in his own Abbey. For some reason the Abbey, though no doubt used, had  not hitherto been consecrated. This omission was made good on the  festival of the Holy Innocents, 1115, by Geoffrey, Archbishop of Rouen,  the Bishops of Lincoln, London, Durham and Salisbury assisting. Henry  III., his Queen Matilda, the chief nobles and prelates of the kingdom,  were present and stayed at the Abbey from December 27th until the Feast  of the Epiphany (January 6th). Wymondham Priory in Norfolk was founded  by William, Count of Arundel, and conferred on St. Albans during Abbot  Richard's rule. Like his predecessor, he enriched his relations at the  expense of the Abbey, and is further blamed by the chronicler for having  promised that the Abbey should be subject for the future not to the  Archbishop but to the Bishop of Lincoln.[11] This change seems to have  led to a stricter rule and so was displeasing to the monks, though it is  admitted that the Archbishop had not treated the Abbey well.        [11] The church remained in this diocese until 1845, when it was           handed over to Rochester, although, as will be seen afterwards,           the Abbey was made independent of the Bishop of Lincoln's           jurisdiction.    16. #Geoffrey of Gorham# (1119-1146). This Abbot came from Maine, where  he had been born. He had been invited to take charge of the monastery  school, but did not arrive in time, so he opened a school at Dunstable.  On one occasion, when a miracle play was being performed by his  scholars, he borrowed some vestments of the Abbey; these were  unfortunately destroyed in a fire; unable to pay for them, he offered  himself as a sacrifice and became a monk. He was unanimously elected  Abbot on the death of his predecessor, but at first was reluctant to  accept the office, though finally his reluctance was overcome. He made a  most energetic ruler. He increased the allowances to the kitchen,  cellars, and almonry. He ordered that the revenues of certain rectories  should be used for providing ornaments, for a fabric fund, and for the  infirmary. He founded and endowed the leper hospital of St. Julian on  the London Road, and established the nunnery of Sopwell (see Appendix)  for thirteen sisters. He built the guest hall, the infirmary, and its  chapel. He also began to construct a new shrine for the relics of the  saint, but after spending L60 on it discontinued the work to give  himself breathing time, and never went on with it again. He felt himself  constrained to sell some of the materials he had collected for this  purpose, to obtain money for the relief of the poor during a famine. A  long description is preserved of the decoration of the shrine. Among  other precious things worked into it was an eagle with outstretched  wings, the gift of King Ethelred. Although it was not quite finished, it  was sufficiently so as to be ready to receive the bones of the martyr.  The remains were examined in the presence of Alexander, Bishop of  Lincoln, and sundry Abbots in 1129. The genuineness of the relics, so it  is said, was established by appearances of the saint to divers persons  as well as by miracles. One shoulder blade was missing; but this, as it  afterwards appeared, had been given by a former Abbot, at the request of  King Canute, to the reigning duke of some foreign land, who had founded  a cathedral church on purpose to receive so precious a relic. A long  list is given of the valuable gifts this Abbot made to the monastery and  church. During his time lived the hermits Roger and Sigur, and the  recluse Christina, whose story has been told in Chapter III.    At this time also Henry I. granted to the Abbots the Liberty of St.  Albans, which gave them the power of trying minor offences, which had  hitherto been tried in the civil courts of the hundred and the shire.    There are only two faults that are recorded of this Abbot: first, he  gave some of the Abbey tithe to the support of the church that he had  rebuilt; and, secondly, he was too easy in business dealings and allowed  himself to be imposed upon.    17. #Randulf of Gobion# (1146-1151). This Abbot had previously been  chaplain and treasurer to the Bishop of Lincoln. He erected the Abbot's  chamber and other useful buildings, and freed the Abbey from debt. He  deposed the Prior because he suspected that a seal he found not yet  engraved had been prepared for a new Abbot, and that this indicated a  desire on the part of the Prior and monks to depose him. He is said to  have burnt a rich chasuble in order to obtain the gold with which it was  embroidered, and to have removed the gold plates from the shrine to  procure money to make a purchase of land--the rent of which, however,  went to the Abbey, not himself--while keeping the gold plate used at his  own table. He was allowed to nominate a successor, and then resigned,  dying shortly afterwards.    18. #Robert of Gorham# (1151-1166). He was a nephew of Geoffrey of  Gorham, sixteenth Abbot. He had been a monk abroad, but coming on a  visit to his uncle he obtained permission to \"migrate\" to St. Albans. In  time he became Prior. As Abbot he managed the affairs of the Abbey with  prudence. He repaired and releaded the church, whitened it within and  without, that is to say, renewed the plaster with which from the first  it had probably been covered. Matthew Paris tells us that one Nicholas  Breakspear, a clerk from Langley, applied to him for admission to the  Abbey, but was refused, as he failed to pass his entrance examination.  \"Wait, my son,\" said the Abbot, \"and go on with your schooling so as to  become more fit.\" Nicholas is spoken of as a youth, but he must have  been about fifty years of age when Robert became Abbot, and was  certainly Bishop of Albano within a year or two of that date, and became  Pope, under the name of Adrian IV., in 1154, the only Englishman that  has ever sat in St. Peter's chair. If there is any truth in the story of  his rejection at St. Albans, it must have happened earlier than the  abbacy of Robert. King Stephen visited the Abbey, and Robert obtained  his authority to level the remains of the camp, that is, the tower that  AElfric, the tenth Abbot, had allowed to remain standing at Kingsbury,  which had become a den of robbers.    Soon after Breakspear had become Pope, Robert and three bishops from the  foreign dominions of Henry II. went as envoys to him from the King; the  Abbot hoped that the Pope's connection with St. Albans, for his father  had become late in life a monk there, would induce him to enlarge its  privileges. Knowing that the dignitaries at Rome and the members of the  Pope's household were wellnigh insatiable, he distributed valuable gifts  among them to secure their good offices with the Pope. Robert complained  of the intolerable oppression of the Bishop of Lincoln, and the  insolence of his agents, and obtained from Adrian complete exemption  from episcopal supervision. The Abbey henceforth was to be subject to  Rome alone. When the Pope's letter granting this exemption was exhibited  at a council in London, the greatest indignation was expressed. An  agreement was, however, at last signed between the Bishop of Lincoln and  the Abbot, three bishops intervening in the interest of peace. Abbot  Robert then sent two of his nephews, monks, to Rome with still more  presents, and as a result of their mission further privileges and  liberties were granted to the Abbot; he was, among other things, allowed  to wear pontifical robes. The Bishop of Lincoln was exasperated, but did  not dare to defy the Pope's authority. Adrian IV. was poisoned in 1158,  and the next Pope granted a new and important privilege to St. Albans;  what it was is not stated. The Bishop of Lincoln now thought it was time  to assert himself. He declared his intention of visiting the Abbey as  its Bishop, and ordered that suitable preparations should be made for  his reception. The Abbot refused to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19499"],[0,"Music Notation and Terminology (#15)"],[1,"great majority of _concertos_ are for piano and orchestra,       but examples of concertos for violin, cello, flute, oboe, and       other solo instruments (all with orchestral accompaniment)       have also been written. A few modern composers have applied       the term _concerto_ to certain large organ works (with no       orchestral accompaniment, the composition being written for       just the one instrument), but this use of the word is so       contrary to the accepted definition that it is hardly       justifiable.         When a concerto is played on two pianos (without orchestra),       this does not mean that there is no orchestral part, but that       there is no orchestra to play it, and so the parts that should       be played by the orchestral instruments have simply been       arranged for a second piano (sometimes organ).    156. A _symphony_ is a sonata for full orchestra. In general its  construction is the same as that of the sonata, but it is usually of  much larger proportions and has in it much greater variety of both tonal  and rhythmic material. The symphony is generally conceded to be the  highest type of instrumental music ever evolved.         The _symphony_ was accepted as a standard form in the time of       Haydn (1732-1809) and was developed enormously by Haydn       himself, Mozart (1756-1791), and Beethoven (1770-1827),       reaching perhaps its highest point in the famous \"Nine       Symphonies\" of the last-named composer. Later symphony writers       whose works are at present being performed include Schumann,       Tschaikowsky, and Dvo[vr]ak.    The word _symphony_ was formerly used synonymously with _ritornelle_,  both words being applied to instrumental interludes between parts of  vocal works, but this usage has now entirely disappeared.    157. _Sonata-form_ (sometimes called _sonata-allegro_) is a plan for the  construction of instrumental music (sonatas, quartets, symphonies,  etc.), in which three rather definite divisions always occur, the third  division being a more or less literal repetition of the first.         These _three parts of sonata-form_ with their usual       subdivisions are:         I. EXPOSITION            (1) Principal theme (or first subject).            (2) Link-episode (or modulation group).            (3) Secondary theme (or song group), always in a nearly              related key.            (4) Closing group.            (5) Coda.         II. DEVELOPMENT SECTION         Treating the themes introduced in the exposition in an almost       infinite variety of fashions, according to the principles of       thematic development. (See Sec. 148).         III. RECAPITULATION (OR REPRISE)         Consisting essentially of the same subdivisions found in the       _exposition_, but differing from this first section in one       essential point, viz., that instead of stating the secondary       theme in a _related_ key, the entire recapitulation is in the       _principal_ key. This third section is always followed by a       coda (which may either be very short or quite extended),       bringing the whole movement to a more definite close.         The second part of _sonata-form_ (the development section) is       sometimes the longest and most intricate of the three       divisions, and it is at this point that the composer has an       opportunity of displaying to the full his originality and       inventive skill. It is principally because of this development       section that the sonata is so far superior as a _form_ to its       predecessors. For an analyzed example of _sonata-form_, see       Appendix E. The student is advised to take other sonatas and       go through the first movements with a view to finding at least       the three main divisions mentioned above. In some cases the       form will of course be so irregular that all the parts       indicated cannot be discovered, but the general outlines of       the scheme will always be present.    158. A _sonatina_, as its name implies, is a little sonata. It differs  from the sonata proper principally in having little or no development,  the second section being of slight importance as compared with the  corresponding section of a sonata.    A _grand sonata_ is like an ordinary sonata in form, but is of unusually  large dimensions.    159. _Program music_ is instrumental music which is supposed to convey  to the listener an image or a succession of images that will arouse in  him certain emotions which have been previously aroused in the  composer's mind by some scene, event, or idea. The clue to the general  idea is usually given at the beginning of the music in the form of a  poem or a short description of the thing in the mind of the composer,  but there are many examples in which there is no clue whatsoever except  the title of the composition.         _Program music_ represents a mean between _pure music_ (cf.       the piano sonata or the string quartet) on the one hand, and       _descriptive music_ (in which actual imitations of bird-calls,       whistles, the blowing of the wind, the galloping of horses,       the rolling of thunder, etc., occur), on the other. Most       program music is written for the orchestra, examples being       Liszt's \"The Preludes,\" Strauss' \"Till Eulenspiegel,\" etc.    160. A _symphonic poem_ (or _tone poem_) is an orchestral composition of  large dimensions (resembling the symphony in size), usually embodying  the program idea. It has no prescribed form and seems indeed to be often  characterized by an almost total lack of design, but there are also  examples of symphonic poems in which the same theme runs throughout the  entire composition, being adapted at the various points at which it  occurs to the particular moods expressed by the _program_ at those  points.         The _symphonic poem_ was invented by Liszt (1811-1886) and has       since been used extensively by Strauss, Saint-Saens and       others. It came into existence as a part of the general       movement which has caused the fugue and the sonata       successively to go out of fashion, viz., the tendency to       invent forms which would not hamper the composer in any way,       but would leave him absolutely free to express his ideas in       his own individual way.          CHAPTER XVI    TERMS RELATING TO VOCAL MUSIC      161. An _anthem_ is a sacred choral composition, usually based on  Biblical or liturgical[34] words. It may or may not have an instrumental  accompaniment, and is usually written in four parts, but may have five,  six, eight, or more.    [Footnote 34: A _liturgy_ is a prescribed form or method of conducting a  religious service, and the parts sung in such a service (as _e.g._, the  holy communion, baptism, etc.), are referred to as the _musical_  liturgy.]         The word _anthem_ is derived from _antifona_ (or _antiphona_),       meaning a psalm or hymn sung responsively, _i.e._,       _antiphonally_, by two choirs, or by choir and congregation.    A _full anthem_ is one containing no solo parts; a _solo anthem_ is one  in which the solo part is predominant over the chorus, while a _verse  anthem_ is one in which the chorus parts alternate with passages for  concerted solo voices (_i.e._, trios, quartets, etc.).    162. _A capella_ (sometimes spelled _cappella_) or _alla capella music_  is part-singing (either sacred or secular) without accompaniment.         This term means literally \"in chapel style,\" and refers to the       fact that in the early days of the church all singing was       unaccompanied.    163. _A motet_ is a sacred choral composition in contrapuntal style. It  has no solo parts, thus corresponding to the madrigal (q.v.) in secular  music. The motet is intended for _a capella_ performance, but is often  given with organ accompaniment.    164. A _choral_ is a hymn-tune of the German Protestant Church. It is  usually harmonized in four voices. The _choral_ (sometimes spelled  _chorale_) is described as having \"a plain melody, a strong harmony, and  a stately rhythm.\" It differs from the ordinary English and American  hymn-tune in being usually sung at a much slower tempo, and in having a  pause at the end of each line of text.    165. The _mass_ is the liturgy for the celebration of the Lord's Supper  in the service of the Roman Catholic Church. As used in the terminology  of music the word refers to the six hymns which are always included when  a composer writes a musical _mass_, and which form the basis of the  celebration of the Communion.[35] These six hymns are as follows:    [Footnote 35: It should be understood that this statement refers to the  service called \"the high mass\" only, there being no music at all in  connection with the so-called \"low mass.\"]         _Kyrie._         _Gloria_ (including the _Gratias agimus_, _Qui tollis_,       _Quoniam_, _Cum Sancto Spirito_).         _Credo_ (including the _Et Incarnatus_, _Crucifixus_, and _Et       Resurrexit_).         _Sanctus_ (including the _Hosanna_).         _Benedictus._         _Agnus Dei_ (including the _Dona nobis_).         The _requiem mass_ is the \"mass for the dead\" and differs       considerably from the ordinary mass. Both regular and requiem       _masses_ have been written by many of the great composers       (Bach, Beethoven, Verdi, Gounod), and in many cases these       _masses_ are so complex that they are not practicable for the       actual service of the Church, and are therefore performed only       by large choral societies, as concert works.    166. A _cantata_ is a vocal composition for chorus and soloists, the  text being either sacred or secular. The accompaniment may be written  for piano, organ, or orchestra.         When sacred in character the _cantata_ differs from the       oratorio in being shorter and less dramatic, in not usually       having definite characters, and in being written for church       use, while the oratorio is intended for concert"]]]
