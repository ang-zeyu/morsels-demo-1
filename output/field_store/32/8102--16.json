That gentle sex will never  repudiate a title bestowed by one, little given to the playful sports  of fancy, whose sorrows and unhappy fate have never wanted their  commiseration, and who distinguished himself on this memorable  occasion, at a period when            \"'twas the time's plague      That madmen led the blind,\"    --in days when philosophy stumbled and murder arrayed itself in the  robes of justice--by an enlightened exercise of the kingly prerogative  of mercy. Proceeding from such a fountain of honour, and purified by  such an appropriation, the title of witch has long lost its original  opprobrium in the County Palatine, and survives only to call forth the  gayest and most delightful associations. In process of time even the  term _witchfinder_ may lose the stains which have adhered to it from  the atrocities of Hopkins, and may be adopted by general usage, as a  sort of companion phrase, to signify the fortunate individual, who, by  an union with a Lancashire witch, has just asserted his indefeasible  title to be considered as the happiest of men.

Though publique iustice hath passed at these Assises vpon the  Capitall offendours, and after the Arraignement & tryall of them,  Iudgement being giuen, due and timely Execution succeeded; which doth  import and giue the greatest satisfaction that can be, to all men; yet  because vpon the caryage, and euent of this businesse, the Eyes of all  the partes of _Lancashire_, and other Counties in the North partes  thereunto adioyning were bent: And so infinite a multitude came to the  Arraignement & tryall of these Witches at _Lancaster_, the number of  them being knowen to exceed all others at any time heretofore, at one  time to be indicted, arraigned, and receiue their tryall,[B_a_]  especially for so many Murders, Conspiracies, Charmes, Meetinges,  hellish and damnable practises, so apparant vpon their owne  examinations & confessions. These my honourable & worthy Lords, the  Iudges of Assise, vpon great consideration, thought it necessarie &  profitable, to publish to the whole world, their most barbarous and  damnable practises, with the direct proceedinges of the Court against  them, aswell for that there doe passe diuers vncertaine reportes and  relations of such Euidences, as was publiquely giuen against them at  their Arraignement. As for that diuers came to prosecute against many  of them that were not found guiltie, and so rest very discontented,  and not satisfied. As also for that it is necessary for men to know  and vnderstande the meanes whereby they worke their mischiefe, the  hidden misteries of their diuelish and wicked Inchauntmentes, Charmes,  and Sorceries, the better to preuent and auoyde the danger that may  ensue. And lastly, who were the principall authors and actors in this  late woefull and lamentable _Tragedie_, wherein so much Blood was  spilt.    Therefore I pray you giue me leaue, (with your patience and fauour,)  before I proceed to the Indictment, Arraignement, and Tryall of such  as were prisoners in the Castle, to lay open the life and death of  this damnable and malicious Witch, of so long continuance (old  _Demdike_) of whom our whole businesse hath such dependence, that  without the particular Declaration and Record of her Euidence, with  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18269"],[0,"Pascal's Pensées (#15)"],[1,"God has set up in the Church visible signs to  make Himself known to those who should seek Him sincerely, and that He  has nevertheless so disguised them that He will only be perceived by  those who seek Him with all their heart; what advantage can they obtain,  when, in the negligence with which they make profession of being in  search of the truth, they cry out that nothing reveals it to them; and  since that darkness in which they are, and with which they upbraid the  Church, establishes only one of the things which she affirms, without  touching the other, and, very far from destroying, proves her doctrine?    In order to attack it, they should have protested that they had made  every effort to seek Him everywhere, and even in that which the Church  proposes for their instruction, but without satisfaction. If they talked  in this manner, they would in truth be attacking one of her pretensions.  But I hope here to show that no reasonable person can speak thus, and I  venture even to say that no one has ever done so. We know well enough  how those who are of this mind behave. They believe they have made great  efforts for their instruction, when they have spent a few hours in  reading some book of Scripture, and have questioned some priest on the  truths of the faith. After that, they boast of having made vain search  in books and among men. But, verily, I will tell them what I have often  said, that this negligence is insufferable. We are not here concerned  with the trifling interests of some stranger, that we should treat it in  this fashion; the matter concerns ourselves and our all.    The immortality of the soul is a matter which is of so great consequence  to us, and which touches us so profoundly, that we must have lost all  feeling to be indifferent as to knowing what it is. All our actions and  thoughts must take such different courses, according as there are or are  not eternal joys to hope for, that it is impossible to take one step  with sense and judgment, unless we regulate our course by our view of  this point which ought to be our ultimate end.    Thus our first interest and our first duty is to enlighten ourselves on  this subject, whereon depends all our conduct. Therefore among those who  do not believe, I make a vast difference between those who strive with  all their power to inform themselves, and those who live without  troubling or thinking about it.    I can have only compassion for those who sincerely bewail their doubt,  who regard it as the greatest of misfortunes, and who, sparing no effort  to escape it, make of this inquiry their principal and most serious  occupations.    But as for those who pass their life without thinking of this ultimate  end of life, and who, for this sole reason that they do not find within  themselves the lights which convince them of it, neglect to seek them  elsewhere, and to examine thoroughly whether this opinion is one of  those which people receive with credulous simplicity, or one of those  which, although obscure in themselves, have nevertheless a solid and  immovable foundation, I look upon them in a manner quite different.    This carelessness in a matter which concerns themselves, their eternity,  their all, moves me more to anger than pity; it astonishes and shocks  me; it is to me monstrous. I do not say this out of the pious zeal of a  spiritual devotion. I expect, on the contrary, that we ought to have  this feeling from principles of human interest and self-love; for this  we need only see what the least enlightened persons see.    We do not require great education of the mind to understand that here is  no real and lasting satisfaction; that our pleasures are only vanity;  that our evils are infinite; and, lastly, that death, which threatens us  every moment, must infallibly place us within a few years under the  dreadful necessity of being for ever either annihilated or unhappy.    There is nothing more real than this, nothing more terrible. Be we as  heroic as we like, that is the end which awaits the noblest life in the  world. Let us reflect on this, and then say whether it is not beyond  doubt that there is no good in this life but in the hope of another;  that we are happy only in proportion as we draw near it; and that, as  there are no more woes for those who have complete assurance of  eternity, so there is no more happiness for those who have no insight  into it.    Surely then it is a great evil thus to be in doubt, but it is at least  an indispensable duty to seek when we are in such doubt; and thus the  doubter who does not seek is altogether completely unhappy and  completely wrong. And if besides this he is easy and content, professes  to be so, and indeed boasts of it; if it is this state itself which is  the subject of his joy and vanity, I have no words to describe so silly  a creature.    How can people hold these opinions? What joy can we find in the  expectation of nothing but hopeless misery? What reason for boasting  that we are in impenetrable darkness? And how can it happen that the  following argument occurs to a reasonable man?    \"I know not who put me into the world, nor what the world is, nor what I  myself am. I am in terrible ignorance of everything. I know not what my  body is, nor my senses, nor my soul, not even that part of me which  thinks what I say, which reflects on all and on itself, and knows itself  no more than the rest. I see those frightful spaces of the universe  which surround me, and I find myself tied to one corner of this vast  expanse, without knowing why I am put in this place rather than in  another, nor why the short time which is given me to live is assigned to  me at this point rather than at another of the whole eternity which was  before me or which shall come after me. I see nothing but infinites on  all sides, which surround me as an atom, and as a shadow which endures  only for an instant and returns no more. All I know is that I must soon  die, but what I know least is this very death which I cannot escape.    \"As I know not whence I come, so I know not whither I go. I know only  that, in leaving this world, I fall for ever either into annihilation or  into the hands of an angry God, without knowing to which of these two  states I shall be for ever assigned. Such is my state, full of weakness  and uncertainty. And from all this I conclude that I ought to spend all  the days of my life without caring to inquire into what must happen to  me. Perhaps I might find some solution to my doubts, but I will not take  the trouble, nor take a step to seek it; and after treating with scorn  those who are concerned with this care, I will go without foresight and  without fear to try the great event, and let myself be led carelessly to  death, uncertain of the eternity of my future state.\"    Who would desire to have for a friend a man who talks in this fashion?  Who would choose him out from others to tell him of his affairs? Who  would have recourse to him in affliction? And indeed to what use in life  could one put him?    In truth, it is the glory of religion to have for enemies men so  unreasonable: and their opposition to it is so little dangerous that it  serves on the contrary to establish its truths. For the Christian faith  goes mainly to establish these two facts, the corruption of nature, and  redemption by Jesus Christ. Now I contend that if these men do not serve  to prove the truth of the redemption by the holiness of their behaviour,  they at least serve admirably to show the corruption of nature by  sentiments so unnatural.    Nothing is so important to man as his own state, nothing is so  formidable to him as eternity; and thus it is not natural that there  should be men indifferent to the loss of their existence, and to the  perils of everlasting suffering. They are quite different with regard to  all other things. They are afraid of mere trifles; they foresee them;  they feel them. And this same man who spends so many days and nights in  rage and despair for the loss of office, or for some imaginary insult to  his honour, is the very one who knows without anxiety and without  emotion that he will lose all by death. It is a monstrous thing to see  in the same heart and at the same time this sensibility to trifles and  this strange insensibility to the greatest objects. It is an  incomprehensible enchantment, and a supernatural slumber, which  indicates as its cause an all-powerful force.    There must be a strange confusion in the nature of man, that he should  boast of being in that state in which it seems incredible that a single  individual should be. However, experience has shown me so great a  number of such persons that the fact would be surprising, if we did not  know that the greater part of those who trouble themselves about the  matter are disingenuous, and not in fact what they say. They are people  who have heard it said that it is the fashion to be thus daring. It is  what they call shaking off the yoke, and they try to imitate this. But  it would not be difficult to make them understand how greatly they  deceive themselves in thus seeking esteem. This is not the way to gain  it, even I say among those men of the world who take a healthy view of  things, and who know that the only way to succeed in this life is to  make ourselves appear honourable, faithful, judicious, and capable of  useful service to a friend; because naturally men love only what may be  useful to them. Now, what do we gain by hearing it said of a man that he  has now thrown off the yoke, that he does not believe there is a God who  watches our actions, that he considers himself the sole master of his  conduct, and that he thinks he is accountable for it only to himself?  Does he think that he has thus brought us to have henceforth complete  confidence in him, and to look to him for consolation, advice, and help  in every need of life? Do they profess to have delighted us by telling  "]]]
