Chitin is a very indestructible substance; even fire will not  destroy it, but in course of time the moisture and the acids in the  earth destroy it, so that at last the millions of cicada shells and  grasshopper cast-off skins, which are also of chitin, and cricket  moults, and all the other little cast-aside chitinous overcoats of the  insects, return again to the earth and the air whence they came. The  minerals and gases that compose them let go of each other, as it were,  and the chitin is no longer chitin.    Amy says she has seen these little cicada shells hundreds of times but  did not know what they were.    Yes, we are sure to find them almost every summer.    If we look, we will also find other larvae shells. Down in the grass are  the cast-off coats of the grasshoppers and the crickets.    All we need do is to look, and we shall be sure to find them--like  unsubstantial ghosts of the active little wearers.    No doubt you all have heard of the seventeen-year locusts. They, too,  are cicadas, and they look very much like this one, only it takes the  young ones seventeen years to complete their growth.    Think of living in the ground and sucking the juices out of the earth  and of tree roots for seventeen years!    [Illustration]    How would you like to do it?    But no doubt the cicada is quite happy living in this way.    At the end of seventeen years the cicadas come up out of the earth in  great swarms.    They cast their skins for the last time. The queer little shells are  seen everywhere, and the air resounds with the songs of the freed  prisoners.    In the South it takes only thirteen years for these cicadas to develop.    [Illustration]    I once went up the side of a beautiful mountain in North Carolina, where  was such a mighty host of cicadas in the trees that I could not hear my  companion speak, and a little way off the noise sounded like a torrent  of rushing water.          THE ODD SPITTLE INSECT      Why, little Nell! What is the matter?    You do wish the frogs would stop spitting on the grass?    Let me see; why, poor child, she is all covered with frog spittle.    That is kind, Ned. See, he is wiping her apron off with some fresh,  clean leaves. Let us rest awhile under this shady tree.    John, pick that grass blade with the frog spittle on it. Be careful not  to disturb it.    [Illustration]    There is a surprise in store for you; this white frothy substance that  is so abundant in some places in the summer and that looks like spittle  is--guess what?    Frog spittle, May says. So you think the frogs spit on the grass do you?  They must be tall frogs to reach up so high.    With this little twig let us carefully brush away the white froth.    Now see.    Yes, there is something in the centre of it.    It is the larva of a--bug!    [Illustration]    The female bug, and here is one of the little things, lays the egg on  the leaf or twigs, and when it hatches the young bug sucks out the sap  of the plant which finally appears as this white froth.    The larva remains surrounded by the froth until its transformations are  complete.    Just before the last moult it stops sucking out sap. The froth dries  about it in the form of a little room, and in this it undergoes its last  moult and comes out--an adult bug.    The froth is supposed to be used as a protection, and it may be against  some enemies, but there are certain wasps that delight in invading the  frothy masses and hauling out the unwilling morsels within to feed to  their young.    No, little Nell, the frogs have nothing whatever to do with this frothy  substance which was called frog spittle before people understood about  the little insect that made it.    They really thought the frogs did it.    The adult spittle insect is called a frog hopper, and it has the power  of leaping very well.    [Illustration]          PRETTY LEAF HOPPERS      Just see this bush! Be careful not to shake it.    It is covered with such pretty, bright-colored little insects.    [Illustration]    There, May ran against the bush and see--they are hopping wildly off in  every direction.    Yes, little Nell, they do sound like rain drops pattering on the leaves.    They are prettier than the spittle insects and more slender, but they  hop about in very much the same way.    The larvae do not make froth, however.    These are the leaf hoppers.    What big heads they have!    And how daintily their green forms are pencilled with red lines.    There are a great many species of the leaf hoppers, and not all of them  are as pretty as these.    [Illustration]    Some of them are very small indeed, and some do great damage to the  grain crops and the fruits.    They suck out the juices of the plants.    If you sweep the insect net over bushes or through the grass in  midsummer, you will be pretty sure to draw in a good collection of leaf  hoppers.    Most of us are only too well acquainted with the rose-leaf hopper that  swarms on rose bushes and kills the leaves. If we have not noticed the  insect itself, we have not failed to notice the little white skins that  it has cast off and left clinging to the leaves.    Yes, these are the little skins it discards when it moults.    John says we can kill them by washing the bushes with strong soap suds.    [Illustration]    Ned says it is better yet to spray them.    It is better and also easier to spray them than to wash them.    You know there are machines for spraying trees and other plants. They  consist of a tank to hold the liquid that is to be sprayed and a pump to  force it through a rubber pipe with a sprinkler at the end.    Very often a mixture of soap and kerosene oil, known as \"kerosene  emulsion,\" is used to spray with.    Paris green and blue vitriol, both very poisonous, are often used on  grape vines before the grapes are formed, and very gaudy vines they are  for a little while after this bright poison has been sprayed upon them.    Although insects are so very interesting, we have to protect ourselves  against many species in order to live.    Yes, John, it is oftentimes merely a question which shall profit by the  crops we plant, the insects or ourselves.    Sometimes the insects win, sometimes we win, but it is a closely  contested warfare all the time.    We plough the land and take care of it, we plant the seeds and keep out  the weeds. Then, when we have a fine crop growing, along come certain  destructive insects, feeling very happy, no doubt, to have found such a  feast.    Now the fight begins. They attack the crop, we attack them. We spray  them with poisons, burn up their eggs, do everything we know how to get  rid of them.    Wise men have spent many years of close study finding out the habits of  the insects destructive to grains and fruits, in order to be able to  destroy them.    Although many of the plant hoppers are such nuisances to us, there is  one family of hoppers that is seldom a nuisance.          THE COMICAL TREE HOPPERS      Do you know the tree hoppers,--absurd little jokers that they are?    Oh, yes, they are hard and three cornered, like animated beechnuts, as  somebody has said.    Yes, some of them have humps on their backs and some have horns.    [Illustration]    John says he once made a collection of tree hoppers and put them in a  box with a reading glass over the top, and showed them to his friends to  make them laugh.    May says she saw them, and they reminded her of Brownies.    Would it not be fun to have a tree hopper Brownie book!    The tree hoppers jump about on the bushes and eat the juices of the  plants, but there are not usually enough of them to do damage. They  seldom come in swarms like some of the leaf hoppers, though sometimes  they do.          THE JUMPING PLANT LICE      The jumping plant lice are nearly related to the tree hoppers, but they  do not look at all like them.    Under the magnifying glass they look like tiny cicadas.    See, here is a picture of one enlarged.    [Illustration]    Their natural size is no larger than a plant louse.    Have you not often seen them clustered close together on the young twigs  of pear trees--tiny, light-colored things that jumped in all directions  when you touched the twig?    The name of the plant louse that infests pear trees is the pear-tree  psylla. It is very destructive to pear trees, sucking out the juices of  the young shoots.    The pear trees can be saved by spraying them with kerosene emulsion as  soon as the young leaves have opened in the spring.          THE APHIDS      Now, let us go in search of the aphids, or aphides, as they are also  called. We shall not have to search far.    [Illustration]    In a very dry season we generally need not search at all. All we need do  is to examine the nearest weed to find plenty of aphides.    Yes, they are the little plant lice that seem at times to cover every  growing thing.    Sometimes they are green, sometimes brown, or gray, or reddish, in  color.    They are tiny creatures, but what they lack in size they more than make  up in numbers.    Go now, and find some aphides.    Ah, here you all come, each bearing a leaf or a twig on which are  aphids.    There was no trouble in finding them!    They do not hop like the jumping plant lice when they are disturbed.  They remain where they are unless they are very much shaken up.    See, most of them are without wings, though here are a few with  beautiful transparent wings.    Antennae they have, long and threadlike. And see, the knowing little  eyes!    They seem to be anchored to the leaf.    Hold the leaf up to the light, and see if you can discover what they are  doing.    Ah, see those mouth tubes firmly stuck into the leaf. There they stand  all day long and suck out the juice.    [Illustration]    Ned says he should think they would burst.    But they do not; they grow. And they also get rid of a large part of the  superfluous sap in a curious way.    They use "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18794"],[0,"Three Years' War (#15)"],[1," days I received reinforcements, and was thus enabled to  surround the English completely. But their various positions were so  placed that it was impossible for me to shell any of them from both  sides, and thus to compel their occupants to surrender.    Day succeeded to day, and still the siege continued.    Before long we had captured some eight hundred of the trek-oxen, and  many of the horses of the enemy. Things were not going so badly for us  after all; and we plucked up our courage, and began to talk of the  probability of a speedy surrender on the part of the English.    To tell the truth, there was not a man amongst us who would have asked  better than to make prisoners of the Cape Mounted Rifles and of  Brabant's Horse. They were Afrikanders, and as Afrikanders, although  neither Free-Staters nor Transvaalers, they ought, in our opinion, to  have been ashamed to fight against us.    The English, we admitted, had a perfect right to hire such sweepings,  and to use them against us, but we utterly despised them for allowing  themselves to be hired. We felt that their motive was not to obtain the  franchise of the Uitlanders, but--five shillings a day! And if it should  by any chance happen that any one of them should find his grave  there--well, the generation to come would not be very proud of that  grave. No! it would be regarded with horror as the grave of an  Afrikander who had helped to bring his brother Afrikanders to their  downfall.    Although I never took it amiss if a colonist of Natal or of Cape Colony  was unwilling to fight with us against England, yet I admit that it  vexed me greatly to think that some of these colonists, for the sake of  a paltry five shillings a day, should be ready to shoot down their  fellow-countrymen. Such men, alas! there have always been, since, in the  first days of the human race, Cain killed his brother Abel. But Cain had  not long to wait for his reward!    Whilst we were besieging these Afrikanders, news came that large columns  from Reddersburg and Bloemfontein were drawing near. So overwhelming  were their numbers that the commandos of Generals A.P. Cronje and Piet  de Wet were far too weak to hold them in check, and I had to despatch  two reinforcing parties, the first under Commandant Fourie, the second  under General J.B. Wessels.    General Froneman had now returned from Smithfield, whither I had sent  him to attack the garrison. He told me that he had been unable to carry  out my orders, for, on his arrival at Smithfield, he had discovered that  the garrison--which had only consisted of some two or three hundred  men--had just departed. He learnt, however, that it was still possible  to overtake it before it reached Aliwal North. Unfortunately, he was  unable to persuade Commandant Swanepoel, who was in command of the  burghers, to pursue the retreating troops. He therefore had to content  himself with the fifteen men he had with him. He came in sight of the  enemy at Branziektekraal, two hours from Aliwal North; but with the  mere handful of men, which was all that he had at his command, an attack  upon them was not to be thought of, and he had to turn back.    His expedition, however, had not been without good result, for he  returned with about five hundred of those burghers who had gone home  after our commandos had left Stormberg.    We had to thank Lord Roberts for this welcome addition to our forces.  The terms of the proclamation in which Lord Roberts had guaranteed the  property and personal liberty of the non-combatant burghers had not been  abided by. In the neighbourhood of Bloemfontein, Reddersburg, and  Dewetsdorp, and at every other place where it was possible, his troops  had made prisoners of burghers who had remained quietly on their farms.  The same course of action had been pursued by the column which fell into  our hands at Mostertshoek--I myself had liberated David Strauss and four  other citizens whom I had found there. While peacefully occupied on  their farms they had been taken prisoners by the English column, which  was then on its way from Dewetsdorp to Reddersburg.    This disregard of his proclamations did not increase the respect which  the burghers felt for Lord Roberts. They felt that the word of the  English was not to be trusted, and, fearing for their own safety, they  returned to their commandos. I sent President Steyn a telegram,  informing him that our burghers were rejoining, and adding that Lord  Roberts was the best recruiting sergeant I had ever had!    General Froneman and the men whom he had collected soon found work to  do. The enemy was expecting a reinforcement from Aliwal North, and I  sent the General, with six hundred troops, to oppose it. He came into  touch with it at Boesmanskop, and a slight skirmish took place.    In the meanwhile I received a report from General Piet de Wet, who was  at Dewetsdorp, notifying me that the English forces outnumbered his own  so enormously that he could not withstand their advance. He suggested  that I ought at once to relinquish the siege and proceed in the  direction of Thaba'Nchu.    I also received discouraging news from General Piet Fourie, who had had  a short but severe engagement with the troops that were coming from  Bloemfontein, and had been compelled to give way before their superior  forces.    Piet de Wet's advice appealed to me all the more strongly since  reinforcements were pouring in upon the enemy from all sides. But I was  of opinion that I ought to go with a strong force after the enemy in the  direction of Norvalspont, as I was convinced that it was no longer  possible to check their advance. But General Piet de Wet differed from  me on this point, and held that we ought to keep in front of the  English, and I was at last compelled to give in to him.    Accordingly I issued orders to General Froneman to desist from any  further attack upon the reinforcement with which he had been engaged,  and to join me. When he arrived I fell back on Thaba'Nchu.    My siege of Colonel Dalgety, with his Brabant's Horse and Cape Mounted  Rifles, had lasted for sixteen days. Our total loss was only five killed  and thirteen wounded. The English, as I learnt from prisoners, had  suffered rather severely.    [Footnote 36: Cape Mounted Rifles.]          CHAPTER XII    The English Swarm over our Country      On April 25th we arrived at Alexandrie, six miles from Thaba'Nchu. The  latter place was already occupied by English outposts. General Philip  Botha now joined me; he had been engaging the enemy in the triangle  formed by Brandfort, Bloemfontein and Thaba'Nchu. My commandos numbered  some four thousand men, and I decided that it was time to concentrate my  forces.    Lord Roberts was about to carry out the plans which he had formed at  Bloemfontein, namely, to outflank us with large bodies of mounted  troops. He attempted to do this to the north-east of Thaba'Nchu, but at  first was not successful. On a second attempt, however, he managed,  after a fierce fight, to break through our lines. It was during this  action that Commandant Lubbe was shot in the leg, and had the misfortune  to be taken prisoner. At Frankfort also, Lord Roberts met with success,  and General De la Rey was forced to retreat northwards.    I was now firmly convinced, although I kept the belief to myself, that  the English would march to Kroonstad; and I could see, more clearly than  ever, the necessity of operating in their rear. I had suggested to  President Steyn when he had visited us at Alexandrie, that I should  proceed to Norvalspont, or even into Cape Colony, but he was against any  such project. This, however, was not because he disapproved of my  suggestion in itself, but because he feared that the Transvaalers might  say that the Free-Staters, now that their own country was in the  enemy's hands, were going to leave them in the lurch. Yet in spite of  his opposition, I had ultimately to carry out my own ideas, for, even if  I was misunderstood, I had to act as I thought best. I can only say that  each man of us who remained true to our great cause acted up to the best  of his convictions. If the results proved disastrous, one had best be  silent about them. There is no use crying over spilt milk.    We now pushed our commandos forward to Zand River. At Tabaksberg General  Philip Botha had a short but severe engagement with Lord Roberts'  advanced columns. I was the last of the Generals to leave Thaba'Nchu.    I was very anxious to prevent the \"granary\"[37] of the Orange Free State  from falling into the hands of the English; with this object in view, I  left behind me at Korannaberg General De Villiers, with Commandants De  Villiers, of Ficksburg, Crowther, of Ladybrand, Roux, of Wepener, and  Potgieter, of Smithfield, and ordered the General to carry on operations  in the south-eastern districts of the Free State.    This valiant General did some fine work, and fought splendidly at  Gouveneurskop and Wonderkop, inflicting very serious losses upon the  English. But nevertheless he had to yield to the superior numbers of the  enemy, who ultimately gained possession of the \"granary\" districts. But  he made them pay for it dearly.    General De Villiers followed the English to Senekal and Lindley, and at  Biddulphsberg, near the first named village, he again engaged them  successfully, killing and wounding many of them. But a grave misfortune  overtook us here, for the General received a dangerous wound on the  head.    There was still another most deplorable occurrence. In some way or other  the grass caught fire; and as it was very dry, and a high wind was  blowing, the flames ran along the ground to where many of the English  wounded were lying. There was no time to rescue them; and thus in this  terrible manner many a poor fellow lost his life.    General De Villiers' wound was so serious, that the only course open was  to ask the commanding officer of the Senekal garrison to"]]]
