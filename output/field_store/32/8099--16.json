Are religious ceremonies ever substituted to-day for the religion  of justice and right? If so, explain how.          CHAPTER XVI    A NEW KIND OF WORSHIP      Amos seemed to think of sacrifices and burnt-offerings as mere  formalities which distracted men's attention from the thing of real  importance, namely, just and righteous dealing between man and his  neighbor.    There was another prophet who lived a little later than Amos. Perhaps  as a youth he heard Amos speak. This was Hosea, who probably came from  Gilead east of the Jordan. This man saw even deeper into the truth of  religion than Amos, and his messages wonderfully completed and rounded  out the great true words which the older prophet had so bravely  spoken.      THE GOOD AND THE EVIL IN THE OLD SACRIFICES    The old religion of sacrifices was by no means wholly evil. When a  family in those days sat down to a happy feast and gave some of  everything in gratitude to Jehovah, God really was there, not in the  sacred rock, but in their love for one another and for him. When they  poured out libations and burned fat on the altar, God was indeed glad,  not because of the smell of the smoke or because he enjoyed drinking  the blood, but because his children were grateful.    =Wrong ideas of God.=--On the other hand, these sacrifices, when  misunderstood, tended to give people a wrong idea of God as one who  was greedy for food and gifts. There was the greater danger of this  wrong idea because of the character of the priests who were supposed  to represent Jehovah. Many of them were very greedy indeed. The story  of Eli's sons in 1 Samuel 2. 12-17 is an illustration. The priests  were supposed to receive for their own personal support a part of all  the gifts which were brought to the shrine. But the sons of Eli made  it the rule that whatever came out of the meat kettle on a  three-pronged fork stuck in by the priest should belong to him. Very  often, it is plain, the priest got everything. And naturally the  people came to think of Jehovah as like his priests--as a Being who  cared only for gifts.    =A worship based on greed.=--The worship of such a god, or of a god  who was thought of as being of such a character, would, of course, be  very far from the love and adoration which we Christians are taught to  offer to our Father, and was really far from the kind of worship  advocated by devout Hebrews. It would be a sort of bargain-hunting  worship: the people to bring gifts of the fat of lambs and libations  of blood and wine, and the god to give them in return good crops of  wheat and oil, and figs and grapes, and an abundance of silver and  gold. If Jehovah would give these things, then worship Jehovah. If  other gods and Baals would give more than Jehovah, worship them.    In short these sacrifices, as Hosea saw, were a kind of worship, and  no worship is a mere formality, but is a vast influence for good or  for ill. Because of these wrong ideas the sacrifices had come to be  more and more an influence for evil. And you cannot have a righteous  and happy human family in which men are just and kind to each other,  without a true worship, growing out of a true idea of God.      HOSEA'S EXPERIENCE AND MESSAGE    This young man from the lovely, grassy plains and valleys east of the  Jordan had had an experience which taught him much. He was by nature  a man with a loving heart. He loved his native land with a burning  patriotism. By and by there came to him, as to most young men, the  experience of a passionate love for a beautiful girl. All the deep  wells of tenderness in Hosea's loving heart were hers, and she became  his wife. For a time they were happy; then little by little it became  clear that this woman, Gomer, did not really love him as he loved her.  She only wanted his money. And when she could get nothing more from  him, or could get more elsewhere, she left him. She was like the woman  in Kipling's poem, \"The Vampire,\" \"she did not care.\" It hurt Hosea.  For a time the light of the whole world seemed darkened for him.    =Reading a meaning in sorrow.=--Then like a flash the thought came to  him; Jehovah is just like me in this regard. He wants love, not gifts,  from his people, a love which on their part does not fawn for other  gifts from him in return, like the cupboard love of kittens purring  for cream. He loves his people Israel just as I love Gomer. That is  why he asks us not to worship these other gods, the Baals; not because  he is jealous but because he is good. He wants us to learn a different  kind of worship altogether--a worship which is not prompted by greed  but by love.    With his whole soul aflame, Hosea poured these new ideas into the ears  of his countrymen.        =\"I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God      more than burnt-offerings.\"=    These great words were quoted by Jesus himself in one of his  controversies with the Pharisees; they are one of the supreme  utterances of human literature.      STORM CLOUDS ON THE HORIZON    This new insight of Hosea helped him to interpret hopefully the  troubles which at that time were coming thick and fast upon his  people. The forebodings of Amos were coming true. The kings of Assyria  were ambitious. They had set their hearts upon a great Assyrian empire  extending from Babylonia to Egypt. For more than two centuries each  new king at Nineveh sent his conquering armies farther west and south.  Already in Hosea's day they had more than once invaded northern Israel  and had taken away tribute. And the leaders of the nation did not have  the brains or the character to avoid a conflict with this merciless  and resistless foe.    =Jehovah loving even in punishment.=--Amos had declared that Jehovah  would surely punish his people because of injustices and wrongs which  they were inflicting on one another. Hosea agreed, but was able to go  further, and say that in these very punishments which were now coming  Jehovah was still showing not his anger but his love. He was punishing  in the hope that his children might learn their lesson and return to  him in love.    =Fall of the northern kingdom.=--The nation, as a nation, seemed to  pay no attention to Hosea's pleadings. They went right on living their  selfish and greedy and lustful lives. And in B.C. 721, as a result of  provoking the Assyrian king Shalmanezer to a fresh attack, the land  was again invaded and the city of Samaria was captured and sacked.  Thousands of the northern Hebrews were carried away as exiles to other  lands and never returned. The northern kingdom was a failure. The  religious ideals and dreams of Abraham and Moses had not yet been  fulfilled. The common people had had little opportunity for happiness  or growth in knowledge and goodness. But the southern kingdom still  existed. And many a disciple of Hosea, some of them carrying scraps  and rolls of papyrus on which his sayings were copied, fled to  Jerusalem, and there sowed the seed of his great message of a God not  only of justice but of love.      STUDY TOPICS    1. Read Genesis 4. 1-15. In this story of Cain and Abel is there any  hint as to how even an animal sacrifice might be true worship?    2. Look up Hosea in the Bible dictionary, or in the chapter on Hosea  in Cornill, The Prophets of Israel. Find out more about the times in  which he lived and about his personal history.    3. Read what you can in the book of Hosea. This is rather hard  reading, but chapter 11 is not very difficult, and gives a good idea  of Hosea's style.    4. Which kind of prayer counts more for the happiness of all, prayers  for personal advantage, or prayers of love and gratitude to our  Father?          CHAPTER XVII    JEHOVAH NOT A GOD OF ANGER      There are other mischievous delusions in regard to the character of  God which we find among all races in the early childhood of their  history. They think of their gods not only as greedy but as having  arbitrary whims and as often falling into fits of unreasonable and  cruel anger.      EARLY IDEAS OF JEHOVAH'S ANGER    The Hebrews were not entirely free from these wrong notions in their  conception of Jehovah. Even in the story of Moses, for example, there  is a strange narrative which declares Jehovah \"met Moses and sought to  kill him\" and would have killed him except for the ceremonial rite  which his wife Zipporah performed.    =The story of the ark and the men of Beth-shemesh.=--Similar to this  is the story of the wanderings of the ark in 1 Samuel. This ark, or  sacred chest, was regarded as the special dwelling place of Jehovah in  Canaan, his permanent home supposedly being on Mount Sinai in the  desert. When the ark was captured by the Philistines a plague broke  out in every city where it was taken. Finally it was placed on a new  cart with specially chosen cows to draw it, and sent back toward the  Hebrew border, and in the course of time it reached the Hebrew town of  Beth-shemesh. And we read that \"the sons of Jeconiah did not rejoice  with the men of Beth-shemesh, when they looked upon the ark of  Jehovah. So he smote among them seventy men.\"[4]      SACRIFICE AS A PROPITIATION OF JEHOVAH'S ANGER    It was just this idea of Jehovah as subject to fits of anger which  prompted many of the old sacrifices. It was not merely that Jehovah  was greedy and could be bribed with gifts to grant favors, but also  that he was dangerous when his anger was stirred and hence sacrifices  were necessary to placate him.    =Human sacrifices.=--An even "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18193"],[0,"Ways of Wood Folk (#15)"],[1," owl, and I had no need for further calling. _Haw! haw!_ he cried deep  down in his throat--_here he is! here's the rascal!_ In a moment he  had the whole flock there; and for nearly ten minutes they kept coming  in from every direction. A more frenzied lot I never saw. The _hawing_  was tremendous, and I hoped to settle at last the real cause and  outcome of the excitement, when an old crow flying close over my  hiding place caught sight of me looking out through the bushes. How he  made himself heard or understood in the din I do not know; but the  crow is never too excited to heed a danger note. The next moment the  whole flock were streaming away across the woods, giving the  scatter-cry at every flap.    There is another way in which the crows' love of variety is manifest,  though in a much more dignified way. Occasionally a flock may be  surprised sitting about in the trees, deeply absorbed in watching a  performance--generally operatic--by one of their number. The crow's  chief note is the hoarse _haw, haw_ with which everybody is familiar,  and which seems capable of expressing everything, from the soft  chatter of going to bed in the pine tops to the loud derision with  which he detects all ordinary attempts to surprise him. Certain crows,  however, have unusual vocal abilities, and at times they seem to use  them for the entertainment of the others. Yet I suspect that these  vocal gifts are seldom used, or even discovered, until lack of  amusement throws them upon their own resources. Certain it is that,  whenever a crow makes any unusual sounds, there are always several  more about, _hawing_ vigorously, yet seeming to listen attentively. I  have caught them at this a score of times.    One September afternoon, while walking quietly through the woods, my  attention was attracted by an unusual sound coming from an oak grove,  a favorite haunt of gray squirrels. The crows were cawing in the same  direction; but every few minutes would come a strange cracking  sound--_c-r-r-rack-a-rack-rack_, as if some one had a giant nutcracker  and were snapping it rapidly. I stole forward through the low woods  till I could see perhaps fifty crows perched about in the oaks, all  very attentive to something going on below them that I could not see.    Not till I had crawled up to the brush fence, on the very edge of the  grove, and peeked through did I see the performer. Out on the end of a  long delicate branch, a few feet above the ground, a small crow was  clinging, swaying up and down like a bobolink on a cardinal flower,  balancing himself gracefully by spreading his wings, and every few  minutes giving the strange cracking sound, accompanied by a flirt of  his wings and tail as the branch swayed upward. At every repetition  the crows _hawed_ in applause. I watched them fully ten minutes before  they saw me and flew away.    Several times since, I have been attracted by unusual sounds, and have  surprised a flock of crows which were evidently watching a performance  by one of their number. Once it was a deep musical whistle, much like  the _too-loo-loo_ of the blue jay (who is the crow's cousin, for all  his bright colors), but deeper and fuller, and without the trill that  always marks the blue jay's whistle. Once, in some big woods in Maine,  it was a hoarse bark, utterly unlike a bird call, which made me slip  heavy shells into my gun and creep forward, expecting some strange  beast that I had never before met.    The same love of variety and excitement leads the crow to investigate  any unusual sight or sound that catches his attention. Hide anywhere  in the woods, and make any queer sound you will--play a jews'-harp,  or pull a devil's fiddle, or just call softly--and first comes a blue  jay, all agog to find out all about it. Next a red squirrel steals  down and barks just over your head, to make you start if possible.  Then, if your eyes are sharp, you will see a crow gliding from thicket  to thicket, keeping out of sight as much as possible, but drawing  nearer and nearer to investigate the unusual sound. And if he is  suspicious or unsatisfied, he will hide and wait patiently for you to  come out and show yourself.    Not only is he curious about you, and watches you as you go about the  woods, but he watches his neighbors as well. When a fox is started you  can often trace his course, far ahead of your dogs, by the crows  circling over him and calling _rascal, rascal_, whenever he shows  himself. He watches the ducks and plover, the deer and bear; he knows  where they are, and what they are doing; and he will go far out of his  way to warn them, as well as his own kind, at the approach of danger.  When birds nest, or foxes den, or beasts fight in the woods, he is  there to see it. When other things fail he will even play jokes, as  upon one occasion when I saw a young crow hide in a hole in a pine  tree, and for two hours keep a whole flock in a frenzy of excitement  by his distressed cawing. He would venture out when they were at a  distance, peek all about cautiously to see that no one saw him, then  set up a heart-rending appeal, only to dodge back out of sight when  the flock came rushing in with a clamor that was deafening.    Only one of two explanations can account for his action in this case;  either he was a young crow who did not appreciate the gravity of  crying _wolf, wolf!_ when there was no wolf, or else it was a plain  game of hide-and-seek. When the crows at length found him they chased  him out of sight, either to chastise him, or, as I am inclined now to  think, each one sought to catch him for the privilege of being the  next to hide.    In fact, whenever one hears a flock of crows _hawing_ away in the  woods, he may be sure that some excitement is afoot that will well  repay his time and patience to investigate.           *       *       *       *       *    Since the above article was written, some more curious crow-ways have  come to light. Here is one which seems to throw light on the question  of their playing games. I found it out one afternoon last September,  when a vigorous cawing over in the woods induced me to leave the  orchard, where I was picking apples, for the more exciting occupation  of spying on my dark neighbors.    The clamor came from an old deserted pasture, bounded on three sides  by pine woods, and on the fourth by half wild fields that straggled  away to the dusty road beyond. Once, long ago, there was a farm there;  but even the cellars have disappeared, and the crows no longer fear  the place.    It was an easy task to creep unobserved through the nearest pine  grove, and gain a safe hiding place under some junipers on the edge of  the old pasture. The cawing meanwhile was intermittent; at times it  broke out in a perfect babel, as if every crow were doing his best to  outcaw all the others; again there was silence save for an occasional  short note, the _all's well_ of the sentinel on guard. The crows are  never so busy or so interested that they neglect this precaution.    When I reached the junipers, the crows--half a hundred of them--were  ranged in the pine tops along one edge of the open. They were quiet  enough, save for an occasional scramble for position, evidently  waiting for something to happen. Down on my right, on the fourth or  open side of the pasture, a solitary old crow was perched in the top  of a tall hickory. I might have taken him for a sentry but for a  bright object which he held in his beak. It was too far to make out  what the object was; but whenever he turned his head it flashed in the  sunlight like a bit of glass.    As I watched him curiously he launched himself into the air and came  speeding down the center of the field, making for the pines at the  opposite end. Instantly every crow was on the wing; they shot out from  both sides, many that I had not seen before, all cawing like mad. They  rushed upon the old fellow from the hickory, and for a few moments it  was impossible to make out anything except a whirling, diving rush of  black wings. The din meanwhile was deafening.    Something bright dropped from the excited flock, and a single crow  swooped after it; but I was too much interested in the rush to note  what became of him. The clamor ceased abruptly. The crows, after a  short practice in rising, falling, and wheeling to command, settled in  the pines on both sides of the field, where they had been before. And  there in the hickory was another crow with the same bright, flashing  thing in his beak.    There was a long wait this time, as if for a breathing spell. Then the  solitary crow came skimming down the field again without warning. The  flock surrounded him on the moment, with the evident intention of  hindering his flight as much as possible. They flapped their wings in  his face; they zig-zagged in front of him; they attempted to light on  his back. In vain he twisted and dodged and dropped like a stone.  Wherever he turned he found fluttering wings to oppose his flight. The  first object of the game was apparent: he was trying to reach the goal  of pines opposite the hickory, and the others were trying to prevent  it. Again and again the leader was lost to sight; but whenever the  sunlight flashed from the bright thing he carried, he was certain to  be found in the very midst of a clamoring crowd. Then the second  object was clear: the crows were trying to confuse him and make him  drop the talisman.    [Illustration]    They circled rapidly down the field and back again, near the watcher.  Suddenly the bright thing dropped, reaching the ground before it was  discovered. Three or four crows swooped upon it, and a lively  scrimmage began for its possession. In the midst of the struggle a  small crow shot under the contestants, and before they knew what was  up he was scurrying away to the hickory with the coveted trinket held  as high as he could carry it, as if in triumph at his sharp trick.
