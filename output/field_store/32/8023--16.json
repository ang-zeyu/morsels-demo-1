Whoso faileth to  recite them hath not been faithful to the Covenant of God and His  Testament, and whoso turneth away from these holy verses in this Day is of  those who throughout eternity have turned away from God. Fear ye God, O My  servants, one and all. Pride not yourselves on much reading of the verses  or on a multitude of pious acts by night and day; for were a man to read a  single verse with joy and radiance it would be better for him than to read  with lassitude all the Holy Books of God, the Help in Peril, the  Self-Subsisting. Read ye the sacred verses in such measure that ye be not  overcome by languor and despondency. Lay not upon your souls that which  will weary them and weigh them down, but rather what will lighten and  uplift them, so that they may soar on the wings of the Divine verses  towards the Dawning-place of His manifest signs; this will draw you nearer  to God, did ye but comprehend.    150 Teach your children the verses revealed from the heaven of majesty and  power, so that, in most melodious tones, they may recite the Tablets of  the All-Merciful in the alcoves within the Mas{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}riqu'l-Ad{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}kars. Whoever  hath been transported by the rapture born of adoration for My Name, the  Most Compassionate, will recite the verses of God in such wise as to  captivate the hearts of those yet wrapped in slumber. Well is it with him  who hath quaffed the Mystic Wine of everlasting life from the utterance of  his merciful Lord in My Name--a Name through which every lofty and majestic  mountain hath been reduced to dust.    151 Ye have been enjoined to renew the furnishings of your homes after the  passing of each nineteen years; thus hath it been ordained by One Who is  Omniscient and All-Perceiving. He, verily, is desirous of refinement, both  for you yourselves and for all that ye possess; lay not aside the fear of  God and be not of the negligent. Whoso findeth that his means are  insufficient to this purpose hath been excused by God, the Ever-Forgiving,  the Most Bounteous.    152 Wash your feet once every day in summer, and once every three days  during winter.    153 Should anyone wax angry with you, respond to him with gentleness; and  should anyone upbraid you, forbear to upbraid him in return, but leave him  to himself and put your trust in God, the omnipotent Avenger, the Lord of  might and justice.    154 Ye have been prohibited from making use of pulpits. Whoso wisheth to  recite unto you the verses of his Lord, let him sit on a chair placed upon  a dais, that he may make mention of God, his Lord, and the Lord of all  mankind. It is pleasing to God that ye should seat yourselves on chairs  and benches as a mark of honour for the love ye bear for Him and for the  Manifestation of His glorious and resplendent Cause.    155 Gambling and the use of opium have been forbidden unto you. Eschew  them both, O people, and be not of those who transgress. Beware of using  any substance that induceth sluggishness and torpor in the human temple  and inflicteth harm upon the body. We, verily, desire for you naught save  what shall profit you, and to this bear witness all created things, had ye  but ears to hear.    156 Whensoever ye be invited to a banquet or festive occasion, respond  with joy and gladness, and whoever fulfilleth his promise will be safe  from reproof. This is a Day on which each of God's wise decrees hath been  expounded.    157 Behold, the \"mystery of the Great Reversal in the Sign of the  Sovereign\" hath now been made manifest. Well is it with him whom God hath  aided to recognize the \"Six\" raised up by virtue of this \"Upright Alif\";  he, verily, is of those whose faith is true. How many the outwardly pious  who have turned away, and how many the wayward who have drawn nigh,  exclaiming: \"All praise be to Thee, O Thou the Desire of the worlds!\" In  truth, it is in the hand of God to give what He willeth to whomsoever He  willeth, and to withhold what He pleaseth from whomsoever He may wish. He  knoweth the inner secrets of the hearts and the meaning hidden in a  mocker's wink. How many an embodiment of heedlessness who came unto Us  with purity of heart have We established upon the seat of Our acceptance;  and how many an exponent of wisdom have We in all justice consigned to the  fire. We are, in truth, the One to judge. He it is Who is the  manifestation of \"God doeth whatsoever He pleaseth\", and abideth upon the  throne of \"He ordaineth whatsoever He chooseth\".    158 Blessed is the one who discovereth the fragrance of inner meanings  from the traces of this Pen through whose movement the breezes of God are  wafted over the entire creation, and through whose stillness the very  essence of tranquillity appeareth in the realm of being. Glorified be the  All-Merciful, the Revealer of so inestimable a bounty. Say: Because He  bore injustice, justice hath appeared on earth, and because He accepted  abasement, the majesty of God hath shone forth amidst mankind.    159 It hath been forbidden you to carry arms unless essential, and  permitted you to attire yourselves in silk. The Lord hath relieved you, as  a bounty on His part, of the restrictions that formerly applied to  clothing and to the trim of the beard. He, verily, is the Ordainer, the  Omniscient. Let there be naught in your demeanour of which sound and  upright minds would disapprove, and make not yourselves the playthings of  the ignorant. Well is it with him who hath adorned himself with the  vesture of seemly conduct and a praiseworthy character. He is assuredly  reckoned with those who aid their Lord through distinctive and outstanding  deeds.    160 Promote ye the development of the cities of God and His countries, and  glorify Him therein in the joyous accents of His well-favoured ones. In  truth, the hearts of men are edified through the power of the tongue, even  as houses and cities are built up by the hand and other means. We have  assigned to every end a means for its accomplishment; avail yourselves  thereof, and place your trust and confidence in God, the Omniscient, the  All-Wise.    161 Blessed is the man that hath acknowledged his belief in God and in His  signs, and recognized that \"He shall not be asked of His doings\". Such a  recognition hath been made by God the ornament of every belief and its  very foundation. Upon it must depend the acceptance of every goodly deed.  Fasten your eyes upon it, that haply the whisperings of the rebellious may  not cause you to slip.    162 Were He to decree as lawful the thing which from time immemorial had  been forbidden, and forbid that which had, at all times, been regarded as  lawful, to none is given the right to question His authority. Whoso will  hesitate, though it be for less than a moment, should be regarded as a  transgressor.    163 Whoso hath not recognized this sublime and fundamental verity, and  hath failed to attain this most exalted station, the winds of doubt will  agitate him, and the sayings of the infidels will distract his soul. He  that hath acknowledged this principle will be endowed with the most  perfect constancy. All honour to this all-glorious station, the  remembrance of which adorneth every exalted Tablet. Such is the teaching  which God bestoweth on you, a teaching that will deliver you from all  manner of doubt and perplexity, and enable you to attain unto salvation in  both this world and in the next. He, verily, is the Ever-Forgiving, the  Most Bountiful. He it is Who hath sent forth the Messengers, and sent down  the Books to proclaim \"There is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the  All-Wise\".    164 O Land of Kaf and Ra!(10) We, verily, behold thee in a state  displeasing unto God, and see proceeding from thee that which is  inscrutable to anyone save Him, the Omniscient, the All-Informed; and We  perceive that which secretly and stealthily diffuseth from thee. With Us  is the knowledge of all things, inscribed in a lucid Tablet. Sorrow not  for that which hath befallen thee. Erelong will God raise up within thee  men endued with mighty valour, who will magnify My Name with such  constancy that neither will they be deterred by the evil suggestions of  the divines, nor will they be kept back by the insinuations of the sowers  of doubt. With their own eyes will they behold God, and with their own  lives will they render Him victorious. These, truly, are of those who are  steadfast.    165 O concourse of divines! When My verses were sent down, and My clear  tokens were revealed, We found you behind the veils. This, verily, is a  strange thing. Ye glory in My Name, yet ye recognized Me not at the time  your Lord, the All-Merciful, appeared amongst you with proof and  testimony. We have rent the veils asunder. Beware lest ye shut out the  people by yet another veil. Pluck asunder the chains of vain imaginings,  in the name of the Lord of all men, and be not of the deceitful. Should ye  turn unto God and embrace His Cause, spread not disorder within it, and  measure not the Book of God with your selfish desires. This, verily, is  the counsel of God aforetime and hereafter, and to this God's witnesses  and chosen ones, yea, each and every one of Us, do solemnly attest.    166 Call ye to mind the s{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}ayk{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~} whose name was Muhammad-Hasan, who  ranked among the most learned divines of his day.

One of the messages[5]  contained a summary of the proceedings of the council, and was  addressed to the commanding officers of all stations in the Punjab,  with the view of imparting confidence, and letting them know what  steps were being taken for the protection of the British residents  throughout the province. This duty having been carried out, I returned  home in a not unpleasant frame of mind, for though the crisis was a  grave one, the outlook gloomy, and the end doubtful, the excitement  was great. There were stirring times in store for us, when every man's  powers would be tested, and the hopefulness of youth inclined me to  look only on the bright side of the situation.    My equanimity was somewhat disturbed later in the day by an occurrence  which caused me a good deal of annoyance at the time, though it  soon passed away. Nicholson came to my house and told me that the  proceedings at the meeting that morning had in some unaccountable  manner become known; and he added, much to my disgust, that it was  thought I might perhaps have been guilty of the indiscretion of  divulging them. I was very angry, for I had appreciated as much as  anyone the immense importance of keeping the decisions arrived at  perfectly secret; and I could not help showing something of the  indignation I felt at its having been thought possible that I could  betray the confidence reposed in me. I denied most positively having  done so; upon which Nicholson suggested that we should proceed  together to the telegraph office and see whether the information  could have leaked out from there. The signaller was a mere boy, and  Nicholson's imposing presence and austere manner were quite too much  for him; he was completely cowed, and, after a few hesitating denials,  he admitted having satisfied the curiosity of a friend who had  inquired of him how the authorities intended to deal with the  crisis. This was enough, and I was cleared. The result to me of this  unpleasant incident was a delightful increase of intimacy with the  man for whom above all others I had the greatest admiration and most  profound respect. As if to make up for his momentary injustice,  Nicholson was kinder to me than ever, and I felt I had gained in him a  firm and constant friend. So ended that eventful day.    At that time it was the custom for a staff officer, who had charge of  any Government property, to have a guard of Native soldiers in charge  of his house. That night it happened that my guard was furnished  by the 64th Native Infantry, a regiment with a particularly bad  reputation, and which had, in order to give effect to the measures  proposed at the morning's meeting, been ordered to leave Peshawar and  proceed to the outposts. The intercepted letters showed that this  regiment was on the point of mutinying, and I could not help feeling,  as I lay down on my bed, which, as usual in the hot weather, was  placed in the verandah for the sake of coolness, how completely I was  at the mercy of the sentry who walked up and down within a few feet of  me. Fortunately, he was not aware that his regiment was suspected, and  could not know the reason for the sudden order to march, or my career  might have been ended then and there.    Within a week from that time I had started for Rawal Pindi to be ready  to join the Movable Column, which was to be formed at Wazirabad as  soon as the troops could be got together. I took with me only just  enough kit for a hot-weather march, and left everything standing in my  house just as it was, little thinking that I should never return to it  or be quartered in Peshawar again.

There were  probably not more than 15,000 British soldiers in the Punjab available  for duty in May, 1857.]    [Footnote 4: The original proposal was that the Movable Column should  be formed at Jhelum, and composed of the 24th Foot from Rawal Pindi,  the 27th Foot from Nowshera, a troop of Horse Artillery from Peshawar,  a Native Field Battery from Jhelum, the Guides from Murdan, the 16th  Irregular Cavalry from Rawal Pindi, the Kumaon battalion from Murree,  the 1st Punjab Infantry from Bannu, and a wing of the 2nd Punjab  Cavalry from Kohat. But events developed so rapidly that before the  column was formed every one of these troops was otherwise employed. It  was thought unwise to unduly weaken the Peshawar valley; the troop of  Horse Artillery, therefore, stood fast, the 27th Foot was halted at  Attock, and the 24th Foot and Kumaon battalion were kept at their  stations ready to move towards the frontier. The Guides, 2nd Punjab  Cavalry, and 1st Punjab Infantry were ordered to Delhi, and the 16th  Irregular Cavalry and the Native Field Battery were not considered  sufficiently loyal to be employed on such a duty. Eventually, the  column was formed of one troop of Horse Artillery, one Field Battery,  and one Infantry regiment, all British and all from Sialkot.]    [Footnote 5: The full text of the message was as follows:        'To Sir John Lawrence, Rawal Pindi, the Commander-in-Chief, Simla,      and officers commanding all stations in the Punjab respectively;      to be forwarded by the assistant in charge of the telegraph      office, or post, as the case may be.        'The senior military officer in the Punjab, Major-General Reed,      having this morning received news of the disarming of the troops      at Mian Mir, a council of war was held, consisting of General      Reed, Brigadier Cotton, Brigadier Neville Chamberlain, Colonel      Edwardes, and Colonel Nicholson, and the following measures were      decided on, subject to the confirmation of the Commander-in-Chief.      General Reed assumes the chief military command in the Punjab;      his Head-Quarters will be the Head-Quarters of the Punjab Civil      Government, and a Movable Column will be formed at Jhelum at once,      consisting of [the troops were here detailed]. The necessary      orders for this column have been issued. The column will move on      every point in the Punjab where open mutiny requires to be put      down by force, and officers commanding at all stations in the      Punjab will co-operate with the column.']           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER VII.  1857      First symptoms of disaffection--Outbreak at Berhampur    --Mangal Pandy--Court-Martial at Meerut--Mutiny at Meerut    --The work of destruction--Want of energy    --Hugh Gough's experiences--Nothing could arrest the mutiny      Before proceeding with the account of my experiences with the Movable  Column, and the subsequent operations for the suppression of the  rebellion, in which I was fortunate enough to take part, it will,  I think, be advisable, for the better understanding of the whole  situation, to devote a little time to the consideration of the  progress of events from the first appearance of symptoms of  disaffection in Lower Bengal, to the crisis I have just been  describing, when Peshawar became involved in the general disturbance.    The substitution of a new rifle for the old musket with which the  sepoys had hitherto been armed entailed a different kind of drill;  and in order that this drill should be speedily learned by the  whole Native army, depots were formed at convenient places for the  instruction of selected men from every corps, who, on becoming  proficient, were to return and instruct their own regiments. One of  these depots was at Dum-Dum, and as early as the 24th January General  Hearsay, commanding the Presidency division, reported to Head-Quarters  that he perceived an 'unpleasant feeling' amongst the Native soldiers  learning the new drill, caused by a belief instilled into them 'by  designing persons, most likely Brahmins,' that they were to be forced  to embrace Christianity, and that for the furtherance of this object  the new ball-cartridges received from the arsenal at Fort William were  greased with the fat of pigs and cows, with the intention of violating  the religious prejudices and destroying the caste of those who would  have to bite them.
