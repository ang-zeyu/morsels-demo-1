With all his admiration for the Gaon, but for whom,  he claimed, the Torah would have been forgotten, he also had points of  sympathy with the Hasidim, for whose leader, Shneor Zalman of Ladi, he  had the highest respect. Like many of his contemporaries, he determined  to go to Berlin. He started on his way, but was stopped at Koenigsberg by  some orthodox coreligionists, and compelled to return to Russia. This  did not prevent his perfecting himself in German, Polish, natural  philosophy, mechanics, and even strategics. On the last subject he wrote  a book, which was burnt by his friends, \"lest the Government suspect  that Jews are making preparations for war!\" But it is not so much his  Talmudic or secular scholarship that makes him interesting to us to-day.  His true greatness is revealed by his attempts, the first made in his  generation perhaps, to reconcile the Hasidim with the Mitnaggedim, and  these in turn with the Maskilim. He spoke a good word for manual labor,  and proved from the Talmud that burdensome laws should be abolished. His  _Pesher Dabar_ (Vilna, 1807) and _Alfe Menasheh_ (ibid., 1827, 1860) are  monuments to the advanced views of the author. In the Hebrew literature  of his time, they are equalled only by the _'Ammude Bet Yehudah_ and the  _Hekal 'Oneg_ of Doctor Hurwitz.[15]    This short period of enlightenment and tolerance, inaugurated by a  semblance of equality, indicates the native optimism of the Slavonic  Jew. For a while a cessation of hostilities was evident in the camp of  Israel. The reforms introduced by the Gaon, and propagated by his  disciples, began to bear fruit. Hasidism itself underwent a radical  change under the leadership of Rabbi Shneor Zalman of Ladi (1747-1813)  and Jacob Joseph of Polonnoy, who, unlike their colleagues of the  Ukraine, were learned in the Talmud and familiar with the sciences.  Protests by Hasidim themselves against the irreverent spirit that  developed after the death of the Besht, had in fact been heard before.  The saintly and retiring Abraham Malak (d. 1780) had denounced, in no  uncertain terms, the gross conception held by the Hasidim of the sublime  teachings of their own sect. He drew a beautiful picture of the ideal  zaddik, who is \"so absorbed in meditation on the Divine wisdom that he  cannot descend to the lower steps upon which ordinary people stand.\"[16]  But the more active Rabbi Shneor, or Zalman Ladier, as he was usually  called, insisted on putting the zaddik on a par with the rabbi, whose  duty it is not to work miracles but to teach righteousness. Assuming for  his followers the name HaBaD, the three letters of which are the  initials of the Hebrew words for Wisdom, Reason, and Knowledge, he  furthered the cause of enlightenment in the only way possible among his  adherents.[17] How well he succeeded may be inferred from the fact,  trivial though it be, that the biography of the Besht, _The Praises of  the Besht_ (_Shibhe ha-Besht_), by Dob Baer, published in Berdichev  (1815), omits many of the legends about the Master included in the  version published the same year in Kopys. The omission can be explained  only on the ground that the editor, Judah Loeb, who was the son of the  author, did not wish to give offence, or he had outgrown the credulity  of his father.[18]    The feeling of tolerance manifested itself also in the Jewish attitude  towards the Gentiles. \"O that we were identified with the nations of our  time, created by the same God, children of one Father, and did not hate  each other because we are at variance in some views!\" This exclamation  of Doctor Hurwitz[19] found an echo in the works of the other Maskilim  that wrote in Hebrew, but more especially of those who used a European  language. They were deeply interested in whatever marked a step forward  in their country's civilization. The opening of a gymnasium in Mitau  (1775) was a joyful occasion, which inspired Hurwitz's Hebrew muse, and  at the centennial celebration of the surrender of Riga to Peter the  Great (July 4, 1810), the craving of the Jewish heart, avowed in a  German poem, was expressed \"in the name of the local Hebrew community to  their Christian compatriots.\" The last stanza runs as follows:      Grant us, who, like you, worship the God above,    Also on earth to enjoy equality with you!    To-day, while your hearts are open to love,    Let us seal our happiness with your love, too![20]    This desire for naturalization brought with it an attempt at  \"Russification.\" To show the beauty of the Russian language, Baruch  Czatzskes of Volhynia translated some of the poems of Khersakov into  Hebrew, and others published manuals for the study of Russian and  Polish.[21] Among the first books issued from the newly-established  printing-press in Shklov, the centre of Jewish wealth, refinement, and  culture at that time, was the _Zeker Rab_ with a German translation  (1804). In an appendix thereto the Shklov Maskilim announced their  intention to publish a weekly, the first in the Hebrew tongue. Yiddish  was also resorted to as a medium for educating the masses, and as early  as 1813 some Vilna Jews applied to the Government for permission to  publish a paper in that language, though it was not until ten years  later (1823-1824) that a Yiddish periodical, Der Beobachter an der  Weichsel, appeared in Warsaw. Nor do we hear of any opposition to the  Government decrees, issued probably at the request of Dillon, Notkin,  Peretz, or Nebakhovich, that the elders of the kahals in and after 1808,  and the rabbis of the congregations in and after 1812, be conversant  with either Russian, German, or Polish. This sudden Russification of the  Jews amounted sometimes to no more than a superficial imitation of  Russian civilization, which pious rabbis as well as liberal-minded men  like Schick, Margolioth, Ilye, and Hurwitz, felt impelled to call a halt  to. Jews, especially the rich, aped the Polish pans. Their wives dressed  in Parisian gowns of the latest fashion, and their homes were conducted  in a manner so luxurious as to arouse the envy of the noblemen. Israel  waxed fat and kicked. Their greatest care was to become wealthy; they  pampered their bodies at the expense of the impoverishment of their  souls, and some feared that \"with the passing away of the elder  generation there would not remain a man capable of filling the position  of rabbi.\"[22]    The privilege of attending public schools and colleges further  stimulated the Russification of the Jews. As soon as these institutions  of learning were thrown open to them, numerous Jewish youths made  headway in all branches taught, especially in medicine. That Alexander's  benign decree of November 10, 1811, issued through the Secretary of  State Speransky, was not always executed by his officials goes without  saying. Simeon Levy Wolf, one of the first Russo-Jewish graduates, was  denied his degree of doctor of jurisprudence in Dorpat unless he  embraced Christianity.[23] When, in 1819, some of the Vilna graduates  applied for the privilege of not paying the double tax, they were told  that they must first renounce their faith, an exception being made only  in favor of Arthur Parlovich. Still the number of Jewish graduate  physicians was on the increase. Osip Yakovlevich Liboschuets, who was the  son of the famous physician of Vilna, took his doctor degree at Dorpat  (1806), became court physician in St. Petersburg, where he founded a  hospital for children, and wrote extensively in French on the flora of  his country.[24] The medical institute of Vilna (1803-1833), afterwards  transferred to Kiev, became the centre of attraction for the Russian  Jewry. Padua, Berlin, Koenigsberg, Goettingen, Copenhagen, Halle,  Amsterdam, Cambridge, and London were for a third of a century replaced  by the home of the Gaon and of Doctor Liboschuets. The first students  were recruited from the bet ha-midrash, and they frequently joined, as  in former days, knowledge of the Law with the practice of their chosen  profession. Such were Isaac Markusevich, whose annotations to the  _Shulhan 'Aruk_ (ab. 1830) were published fifty years later;[25] Joseph  Rosensohn, the promising Talmudist who became rabbi of Pyosk at the age  of nineteen;[26] and Kusselyevsky of Nieszvicz, a stipendiary of a  Polish nobleman and a great favorite with Professor Frank. Because of  his proficiency, he was exempted from serving as a vratch (interne), and  for his piety and learning he was addressed by Jews and Gentiles as  \"rabbi.\"[27]    With what dreams such happenings filled the Jewish heart! \"Thank God,\"  writes a merchant of the first guild in reply to an inquiry from distant  Bokhara, \"thank God, we dwell in peace under the sovereignty of our czar  Alexander, who has shown us his mercy, and has put us in every respect  on an equality with all the inhabitants of the land.\"[28] But a rude  awakening was soon to make the Jews aware that their visions of better  days were still far from realization. In 1815, Alexander I formed the  acquaintance of Baroness Kruedener, and since then, to the satisfaction  of Prince Galitzin, \"with what giant strides the emperor advanced in the  pathway of religion!\" His humanitarian deeds gave way to a profound  religious mysticism. He experienced a revulsion of feeling toward  reforms in his vast empire, and, as always, the Jews were the first  victims of an ill-boding change. The kindly monarch who, at Paris, had  said to a Russo-Jewish deputation, _J'enleverai le joug de vos epaules_,  began to make their yoke heavier than he had found it. The enlightened  czar, who, in striking a medal commemorating the emancipation of the  Jews of his empire, had anticipated Napoleon by a year, suddenly became  a bigoted tyrant, whose efforts were devoted to converting the same Jews  to Christianity.

Come to thy beloved one, come to thy beloved  one, O Un-Nefer, whose word is truth. Come to thy wife, O thou whose  heart is still. Come to the lady of thy house; I am thy sister from thy  mother's [womb]. Go not thou far from me. The faces of gods and men are  turned towards thee, they all weep for thee together. As soon as I saw  thee I cried out to thee, weeping with a loud voice which pierced the  heavens, and thou didst not hear my voice.

Thy two  Sisters are nigh unto thee; they guard thy bier, they address thee with  words [full of] tears as thou liest prone on thy bier. Look thou at the  young women; speak to us, O our Sovereign Lord. Destroy thou all the  misery that is in our hearts; the chiefs among gods and men look upon  thee. Turn thou towards us thy face, O our Sovereign Lord. At the sight  of thy face life cometh to our faces; turn not thou thy face from us.  The joy of our heart is in the sight of thee. O Beautiful Sovereign, our  hearts would see thee. I am thy sister Nephthys who loveth thee. The  fiend Seba hath fallen, he hath not being. I am with thee, and I act as  the protectress of thy members for ever and ever.\"    The second work, the \"Festival Songs of Isis and Nephthys,\" was sung  during the great festival of Osiris, which took place in the fourth  month of the Season of Akhet and lasted five days (from the  twenty-second to the twenty-sixth day). It was sung by two virgins who  wore fillets of sheep's wool on their heads, and held tambourines in  their hands; one was called Isis and the other Nephthys. According to  the rubrical directions given in the British Museum papyrus, the  sections were sung by both women together. The following passage will  illustrate the contents of the work:    \"Come, come, run to me, O strong heart! Let me see thy divine face, for  I do not see thee, and make thou clear the path that we may see thee as  we see Ra in heaven, when the heavens unite with the earth, and cause  darkness to fall upon the earth each day. My heart burneth as with fire  at thy escape from the Fiend, even as my heart burneth with fire when  thou turnest thy side to me; O that thou wouldst never remove it from  me! O thou who unitest the Two Domains (_i.e._ Egypt, North and South),  and who turnest back those who are on the roads, I seek to see thee  because of my love for thee.... Thou fliest like a living being, O  Everlasting King; thou hast destroyed the fiend Anrekh. Thou art the  King of the South and of the North, and thou goest forth from  Tatchesert. May there never be a moment in thy life when I do not fill  thy heart, O my divine brother, my lord who goest forth from Aqert....  My arms are raised to protect thee, O thou whom I love. I love thee, O  Husband, Brother, lord of love; come thou in peace into thy house....  Thy hair is like turquoise as thou comest forth from the Fields of  Turquoise, thy hair is like unto the finest lapis-lazuli, and thou  thyself art more blue than thy hair. Thy skin and body are like southern  alabaster, and thy bones are of silver. The perfume of thy hair is like  unto new myrrh, and thy skull is of lapis-lazuli.\"    The third work, \"The Book of making splendid the Spirit of Osiris,\" was  also sung at the great festival of Osiris that took place during the  November-December at Abydos and other great towns in Egypt, and if it  were sung on behalf of any man, the resurrection and life, constantly  renewed, of that man were secured for his soul and spirit. This Book,  written in hieratic, is found in a papyrus in Paris, and the following  extract will illustrate its contents: \"Come to thy house, come to thy  house, O An. Come to thy house, O Beautiful Bull, lord of men and women,  the beloved one, the lord of women. O Beautiful Face, Chief of Akert,  Prince, Khenti Amentiu, are not all hearts drunk through the love of  thee, O Un-Nefer, whose word is truth? The hands of men and gods are  lifted up and seek thee, even as the hands of a babe are stretched out  to his mother. Come thou to them, for their hearts are sad, and make  them to rejoice. The lands of Horus exult, the domains of Set are  overthrown because of their fear of thee. Hail, Osiris Khenti Amentiu! I  am thy sister Isis. No god and no goddess have done for thee what I have  done. I, a woman, made a man child for thee, because of my desire to  make thy name to live upon the earth. Thy divine essence was in my body,  I brought him forth on the ground. He pleaded thy case, he healed thy  suffering, he decreed the destruction of him that caused it. Set fell  under his knife, and the Smamiu fiends of Set followed him. The throne  of the Earth-god is thine, O thou who art his beloved son.... There is  health in thy members, thy wounds are healed, thy sufferings are  relieved, thou shalt never groan again in pain. Come to us thy sisters,  come to us; our hearts will live when thou comest. Men shall cry out to  thee, and women shall weep glad tears, at thy coming to them.... The  Nile appeareth at the command of thy mouth; thou makest men to live on  the effluxes that proceed from thy members, and thou makest every field  to flourish. When thou comest that which is dead springeth into life,  and the plants in the marshes put forth blossoms. Thou art the Lord of  millions of years, the sustainer of wild creatures, and the lord of  cattle; every created thing hath its existence from thee. What is in the  earth is thine. What is in the heavens is thine. What is in the waters  is thine. Thou art the Lord of Truth, the hater of sinners, whom thou  overthrowest in their sins. The Goddesses of Truth are with thee; they  never leave thee. No sinful man can approach thee in the place where  thou art. Whatsoever appertaineth to life and to death belongeth to  thee, and to thee belongeth everything that concerneth man.\"    During the period of the occupation of Egypt by the Romans, the three  last-named works were still further abridged, and eventually the texts  that were considered essential for salvation were written upon small  sheets of papyrus from 9 to 12 inches high, and from 5 to 10 inches  wide.                                        CHAPTER VI                       THE EGYPTIAN STORY OF THE CREATION      If we consider for a moment the vast amount of thought which the  Egyptian gave to the problems of the future life, and their deep-seated  belief in resurrection and immortality, we cannot fail to conclude that  he must have theorised deeply about the constitution of the heaven in  which he hoped to live everlastingly, and about its Maker. The  translations given in the preceding pages prove that the theologians of  Egypt were ready enough to describe heaven, and the life led by the  blessed there, and the powers and the attributes of the gods, but they  appear to have shrunk from writing down in a connected form their  beliefs concerning the Creation and the origin of the Creator. The  worshippers of each great god proclaimed him to be the Creator of All,  and every great town had its own local belief on the subject. According  to the Heliopolitans, Atem, or Tem, and at a later period Ra, was the  Creator; according to Memphite theology he was Ptah; according to the  Hermopolitans he was Thoth; and according to the Thebans he was Amen  (Ammon). In only one native Egyptian work up to the present has there  been discovered any connected account of the Creation, and the means by  which it was effected, namely, the British Museum Papyrus, No. 10,188.  This papyrus was written about 305 B.C., and is therefore of a  comparatively late date, but the subject matter of the works contained  in it is thousands of years older, and it is only _their_ forms which  are of a late date. The Story of the Creation is found in the last work  in the papyrus, which is called the \"Book of overthrowing Aapep, the  Enemy of Ra, the Enemy of Un-Nefer\" (_i.e._ Osiris). This work is a  liturgy, which was said at certain times of the day and night in the  great temple of Amen-Ra at Thebes, with the view of preventing the  monster Aapep from obstructing the sunrise. Aapep was supposed to lie in  wait for the sun daily just before sunrise, with the view of doing  battle with him and overthrowing him. When the Sun-god arrived at the  place where Aapep was, he first of all cast a spell upon the monster,  which rendered him helpless, and then he cast his fiery rays upon him,  which shrivelled him up, and the fire of the god consumed him entirely.  In the temple of Amen-Ra the priests recited the spells that were  supposed to help the Sun-god to burn up Aapep, and they burnt waxen  figures of the monster in specially prepared fires, and, uttering  curses, they trampled them under foot and defiled them. These spells and  burnings were also believed to break up rain clouds, and to scatter fog  and mist and to dissipate thunder-storms, and to help the sun to rise on  this world in a cloudless sky. Aapep was a form of Set, the god of evil  of every kind, and his allies were the \"Red Fiends\" and the \"Black  Fiends,\" and every power of darkness. In the midst of the magical spells  of this papyrus we find two copies of the \"Book of knowing how Ra came  into being, and of overthrowing Aapep.\" One copy is a little fuller than  the other, but they agree substantially. The words of this book are said  in the opening line to have been spoken by the god Nebertcher, _i.e._  the \"Lord to the uttermost limit,\" or God Himself. The Egyptian  Christians, or Copts, in their religious writings use this name as an  equivalent of God Almighty, the Lord of All, the God of the Universe.  Nebertcher says: \"I am the creator of what hath come into being. I  myself came into being under the"]]]
