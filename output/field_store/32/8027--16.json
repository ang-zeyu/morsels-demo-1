Between November 22 and December  13 occurred the Battle of Cambrai in which the British employed \"tanks\"  to break down the wire entanglements instead of the usual artillery  preparations. Bourlon Wood dominating Cambrai was taken November 26. A  surprise counterattack by the Germans December 2, compelled the British  to give up one-fourth of the ground gained. Jerusalem was captured by  the British December 9.    The British national labor conference on December 29, approved a  continuation of the war for aims similar to those defined by President  Wilson.    Aside from the collapse of Russia, culminating in an armistice between  Germany and the Bolsheviki government of Russia at Brest-Litovsk,  December 15, the most important Teutonic success was in the big  German-Austrian counterdrive in Italy, October 24 to December 1. The  Italians suffered a loss of territory gained during the summer and their  line was shifted to the Piave river, Asiago plateau and Brenta river.    Brazil declared war on Germany October 26.          CHAPTER VII.    NEGROES RESPOND TO THE CALL.      SWIFT AND UNHALTING ARRAY--FEW PERMITTED TO VOLUNTEER--ONLY NATIONAL  GUARD ACCEPTED--NO NEW UNITS FORMED--SELECTIVE DRAFT THEIR  OPPORTUNITY--PARTIAL DIVISION OF GUARDSMEN--COMPLETE DIVISION OF  SELECTIVES--MANY IN TRAINING--ENTER MANY BRANCHES OF SERVICE--NEGRO  NURSES AUTHORIZED--NEGRO Y.M.C.A. WORKERS--NEGRO WAR  CORRESPONDENT--NEGRO ASSISTANT TO SECRETARY OF WAR--TRAINING CAMP FOR  NEGRO OFFICERS--FIRST TIME IN ARTILLERY--COMPLETE RACIAL SEGREGATION.      When the call to war was sounded by President Wilson, no response was  more swift and unhalting than that of the Negro in America. Before our  country was embroiled the black men of Africa had already contributed  their share in pushing back the Hun. When civilization was tottering and  all but overthrown, France and England were glad to avail themselves of  the aid of their Senegalese, Algerian, Soudanese and other troops from  the tribes of Africa. The story of their valor is written on the  battlefields of France in imperishable glory.    Considering the splendid service of the--in many cases--half wild blacks  from the region of the equator, it seems strange that our government did  not hasten sooner and without demur to enlist the loyal Blacks of this  country with their glowing record in former wars, their unquestioned  mental attainments, their industry, stamina and self reliance. Yet at  the beginning of America's participation in the war, it was plain that  the old feeling of intolerance; the disposition to treat the Negro  unfairly, was yet abroad in the land.    He was willing; anxious to volunteer and offered himself in large  numbers at every recruiting station, without avail. True, he was  accepted in numerous instances, but the condition precedent, that of  filling up and rounding out the few Negro Regular and National Guard  organizations below war strength, was chafing and humiliating. Had the  response to the call for volunteers been as ardent among all classes of  our people; especially the foreign born, as it was from the American  Negro, it is fair to say that the selective draft would not necessarily  have been so extensive.    It was not until the selective draft was authorized and the organization  of the National Army began, that the Negro was given his full  opportunity. His willingness and eagerness to serve were again  demonstrated. Some figures dealing with the matter, taken from the  official report of the Provost Marshall General (General E.H. Crowder)  will be cited later on.    Of the four colored regiments in the Regular Army, the 24th infantry had  been on the Mexican border since 1916; the 25th infantry in Hawaii all  the years of the war; the Ninth cavalry in the Philippines since 1916,  and the 10th cavalry had been doing patrol and garrison duty on the  Mexican border and elsewhere in the west since early in 1917. These four  regiments were all sterling organizations dating their foundation back  to the days immediately following the Civil war. Their record was and is  an enviable one. It is no reflection on them that they were not chosen  for overseas duty. The country needed a dependable force on the Mexican  border, in Hawaii, the Philippines, and in different garrisons at home.    A number of good white Regular Army regiments were kept on this side for  the same reasons; not however, overlooking or minimizing the fact not to  the honor of the nation in its final resolve, that there has always been  fostered a spirit in the counsels and orders of the Department of War,  as in all the other great government departments, to restrain rather  than to encourage the patriotic and civic zeal of their faithful and  qualified Negro aids and servants. That is to say, to draw before them  a certain imaginary line; beyond and over which the personal ambitions  of members of the race; smarting for honorable renown and promotion;  predicated on service and achievement, they were not permitted to go. A  virtual \"Dead Line\"; its parent and wet nurse being that strange thing  known as American Prejudice, unknown of anywhere else on earth, which  was at once a crime against its marked and selected victims, and a  burden of shame which still clings to it; upon the otherwise great  nation, that it has condoned and still remains silent in its presence.    Negro National Guard organizations had grown since the Spanish-American  war, but they still were far from being numerous in 1917. The ones  accepted by the war department were the Eighth Illinois Infantry, a  regiment manned and officered entirely by Negroes, the 15th New York  Infantry all Negroes with five Negro officers, all the senior officers  being white; the Ninth Ohio, a battalion manned and officered by  Negroes; the 1st Separate Battalion of the District of Columbia, an  infantry organization manned and officered by Negroes; and Negro  companies from the states of Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts and  Tennessee. Massachusetts also had a company known as the 101st  Headquarters company and Military Police. The Eighth Illinois became the  370th Infantry in the United States army; the 15th New York became the  369th Infantry; the Ninth Ohio battalion and the companies from  Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts and Tennessee, as well as the  District of Columbia battalion, were all consolidated into the 372nd  Infantry.    When the above organizations had been recruited up to war strength there  were between 12,000 and 14,000 colored men representing the National  Guard of the country. With a population of 12,000,000 Negroes to draw  from; the majority of those suitable for military service anxious to  enlist, it readily can be seen what a force could have been added to  this branch of the service had there been any encouragement of it. There  was not lacking a great number of the race, many of them college  graduates, competent to act as officers of National Guard units. Many of  those commissioned during the Spanish-American war had the experience  and age to fit them for senior regimental commands. The 8th Illinois was  commanded by Colonel Franklin A. Denison, a prominent colored attorney  of Chicago and a seasoned military man. He was the only colored man of  the rank of Colonel who was permitted to go to France in the combatant  or any other branch of the service. After a brief period in the earlier  campaigns he was invalided home very much against his will.    The 15th New York was commanded by Colonel William Hayward, a white man.  He was devoted to his black soldiers and they were very fond of him.  Officers immediately subordinate to him were white men. The District of  Columbia battalion might have retained its colored commander, Major  James E. Walker, as he was a fine soldierly figure and possessed of the  requisite ability, but he was removed by death while his unit was still  training near Washington. Some of the Negro officers of National Guard  organizations retained their commands, but the majority were superseded  or transferred before sailing or soon after arrival in France.    The 369th, the 370th and the 372nd infantry regiments in the United  States army, mentioned as having been formed from the colored National  Guard units, became a part of the 93rd division. Another regiment, the  371st, formed from the draft forces was also part of the same division.  This division was brigaded with the French from the start and saw  service through the war alongside the French poilus with whom they  became great friends. There grew up a spirit of which, side by side,  they faced and smashed the savage Hun, never wavered or changed. Besides  the soldiers from Illinois, New York, Ohio, District of Columbia,  Connecticut, Maryland and Tennessee, there were Negro contingents from  Mississippi and South Carolina in the 93rd division. One of the  regiments of this division, the 369th (15th New York) was of the first  of the American forces to reach France, following mutual admiration  between these two widely different representatives of the human family,  that during the period in the expeditionary force of Regulars which  reached France June 13, 1917; being among the first 100,000 that went  abroad. However, the 93rd division, exclusively Negro, had not been  fully formed then and the regiment did not see much real fighting until  the spring and summer of 1918.    [Illustration: NEGRO NURSES CARRYING BANNER OF FAMOUS NEGRO REGIMENT.  MARCHING DOWN FIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK. IN GREAT PARADE WHICH OPENED RED  CROSS DRIVE.]    The 92nd division was another exclusively Negro division. There were  many more Negro troops in training in France and large numbers at  training camps in this country, but the 92nd and 93rd, being the earlier  formed and trained divisions, saw practically all the fighting.

Despite its  abundant natural resources, output per capita is among the world's  lowest. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for  80%-90% of the population but accounts for about 12% of GDP. Oil  production and the supporting activities are vital to the economy,  contributing about 50% to GDP. Notwithstanding the signing of a peace  accord in November 1994, sporadic violence continues, millions of land  mines remain, and many farmers are reluctant to return to their  fields. As a result, much of the country's food must still be  imported. To take advantage of its rich resources - notably gold,  diamonds, extensive forests, Atlantic fisheries, arable land, and  large oil deposits - Angola will need to observe the cease-fire,  implement the peace agreement, and reform government policies. Despite  the high inflation and political difficulties, total output grew an  estimated 9% in 1996, largely due to increased oil production.
