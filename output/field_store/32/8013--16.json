To this Sutra 30 replies, 'The  complete shaking off of the works at the moment of death is possible,  since matters of that kind are observed in Scripture,' i.e. since  scriptural passages show that even he whose works are entirely  annihilated, and who has manifested himself in his true shape, is yet  connected with some kind of body; compare the passage, 'para/m/ jyotir  upasampadya svena rupe/n/abhinishpadyate sa tatra paryeti kri/d/an  ramamana/h/ sa svara/d/ bhavati tasya sarveshu lokeshu kama/k/aro  bhavati.' That subtle body is not due to karman, but to the soul's  vidyamahatmya.--That the explanation of the /S/ri-bhashya agrees with  the text as well as /S/a@nkara's, a comparison of the two will show;  especially forced is /S/a@nkara's explanation of 'arthavattvam  ubhayatha,' which is said to mean that there is arthavattva in one case,  and non-arthavattva in the other case.    The next Sutra (31) constitutes an adhikara/n/a (XVIII) deciding that  the road of the gods is followed not only by those knowing the vidyas  which specially mention the going on that road, but by all who are  acquainted with the sagu/n/a-vidyas of Brahman.--The explanation given  in the /S/ri-bhashya (in which Sutras 31 and 32 have exchanged places)  is similar, with the difference however that all who meditate on  Brahman--without any reference to the distinction of nirgu/n/a and  sagu/n/a--proceed after death on the road of the gods. (The  /S/ri-bhashya reads 'sarvesham,' i.e. all worshippers, not 'sarvasam,'  all sagu/n/a-vidyas.)    Adhik. XIX (32) decides that, although the general effect of true  knowledge is release from all forms of body, yet even such beings as  have reached perfect knowledge may retain a body for the purpose of  discharging certain offices.--In the /S/ri-bhashya, where the Sutra  follows immediately on Sutra 30, the adhikara/n/a determines, in close  connexion with 30, that, although those who know Brahman as a rule  divest themselves of the gross body--there remaining only a subtle body  which enables them to move--and no longer experience pleasure and pain,  yet certain beings, although having reached the cognition of Brahman,  remain invested with a gross body, and hence liable to pleasure and pain  until they have fully performed certain duties.    Adhik. XX (33) teaches that the negative attributes of Brahman mentioned  in some vidyas--such as its being not gross, not subtle, &c.--are to be  included in all meditations on Brahman.--Adhik. XXI (34) determines that  Ka/th/a Up. III, 1, and Mu. Up. III, 1, constitute one vidya only,  because both passages refer to the highest Brahman. According to  Ramanuja the Sutra contains a reply to an objection raised against the  conclusion arrived at in the preceding Sutra.--Adhik. XXII (35, 36)  maintains that the two passages, B/ri/. Up. III, 4 and III, 5,  constitute one vidya only, the object of knowledge being in both cases  Brahman viewed as the inner Self of all.--Adhik. XXIII (37) on the  contrary decides that the passage Ait. Ar. II, 2, 4, 6 constitutes not  one but two meditations.--Adhik. XXIV (38) again determines that the  vidya of the True contained in B/ri/. Up. V, 4, 5, is one  only--According to Ramanuja, Sutras 35-38 constitute one adhikara/n/a  only whose subject is the same as that of XXII according to /S/a@nkara.    Adhik. XXV (39) proves that the passages Ch. Up. VIII, 1 and B/ri/. Up.  IV, 4, 22 cannot constitute one vidya, since the former refers to  Brahman as possessing qualities, while the latter is concerned with  Brahman as destitute of qualities.--Adhik. XXVI (40, 41) treats,  according to /S/a@nkara, of a minor question connected with Ch. Up. V,  11 ff.--According to the /S/ri-bhashya, Sutras 39-41 form one  adhikara/n/a whose first Sutra reaches essentially the same conclusion  as /S/a@nkara under 39. Sutras 40, 41 thereupon discuss a general  question concerning the meditations on Brahman. The qualities, an  opponent is supposed to remark, which in the two passages discussed are  predicated of Brahman--such as va/s/itva, satyakamatva, &c.--cannot be  considered real (paramarthika), since other passages (sa esha neti neti,  and the like) declare Brahman to be devoid of all qualities. Hence those  qualities cannot be admitted into meditations whose purpose is final  release.--To this objection Sutra 40 replies, '(Those qualities) are not  to be left off (from the meditations on Brahman), since (in the passage  under discussion as well as in other passages) they are stated with  emphasis[17].'--But, another objection is raised, Scripture says that he  who meditates on Brahman as satyakama, &c. obtains a mere perishable  reward, viz. the world of the fathers, and similar results specified in  Ch. Up. VIII, 2; hence, he who is desirous of final release, must not  include those qualities of Brahman in his meditation.--To this objection  Sutra 41 replies, 'Because that (i.e. the free roaming in all the  worlds, the world of the fathers, &c.) is stated as proceeding therefrom  (i.e. the approach to Brahman which is final release) in the case of  (the soul) which has approached Brahman;' (therefore a person desirous  of release, may include satyakamatva, &c. in his meditations.)    Adhik. XXVII (42) decides that those meditations which are connected  with certain matters forming constituent parts of sacrificial actions,  are not to be considered as permanently requisite parts of the  latter.--Adhik. XXVIII (43) teaches that, in a B/ri/. Up. passage and a  similar Ch. Up. passage, Vayu and Pra/n/a are not to be identified, but  to be held apart.--Adhik. XXIX (44-52) decides that the firealtars made  of mind, &c., which are mentioned in the Agnirahasya, do not constitute  parts of the sacrificial action (so that the mental, &c. construction of  the altar could optionally be substituted for the actual one), but  merely subjects of meditations.    Adhik. XXX (53, 54) treats, according to /S/a@nkara, in the way of  digression, of the question whether to the Self an existence independent  of the body can be assigned, or not (as the Materialists  maintain).--According to the /S/ri-bhashya the adhikara/n/a does not  refer to this wide question, but is concerned with a point more  immediately connected with the meditations on Brahman, viz. the question  as to the form under which, in those meditations, the Self of the  meditating devotee has to be viewed. The two Sutras then have to be  translated as follows: 'Some (maintain that the soul of the devotee has,  in meditations, to be viewed as possessing those attributes only which  belong to it in its embodied state, such as j/n/at/ri/tva and the like),  because the Self is (at the time of meditation) in the body.'--The next  Sutra rejects this view, 'This is not so, but the separatedness (i.e.  the pure isolated state in which the Self is at the time of final  release when it is freed from all evil, &c.) (is to be transferred to  the meditating Self), because that will be[18] the state (of the Self in  the condition of final release).'    Adhik. XXXI (55, 56) decides that meditations connected with constituent  elements of the sacrifice, such as the udgitha, are, in spite of  difference of svara in the udgitha, &c., valid, not only for that  /s/akha in which the meditation actually is met with, but for all  /s/akhas.--Adhik. XXXII (57) decides that the Vai/s/vanara Agni of Ch.  Up. V, 11 ff. is to be meditated upon as a whole, not in his single  parts.--Adhik. XXXIII (58) teaches that those meditations which refer to  one subject, but as distinguished by different qualities, have to be  held apart as different meditations. Thus the daharavidya,  /S/a/nd/ilyavidya, &c. remain separate.    Adhik. XXXIV (59) teaches that those meditations on Brahman for which  the texts assign one and the same fruit are optional, there being no  reason for their being cumulated.--Adhik. XXXV (60) decides that those  meditations, on the other hand, which refer to special wishes may be  cumulated or optionally employed according to choice.--Adhik. XXXVI  (61-66) extends this conclusion to the meditations connected with  constituent elements of action, such as the udgitha.      PADA IV.      Adhik. I (1-17) proves that the knowledge of Brahman is not kratvartha,  i.e. subordinate to action, but independent.--Adhik. II (18-20) confirms  this conclusion by showing that the state of the pravrajins is enjoined  by the sacred law, and that for them vidya only is prescribed, not  action.--Adhik. III (21, 22) decides that certain clauses forming part  of vidyas are not mere stutis (arthavadas), but themselves enjoin the  meditation.--The legends recorded in the Vedanta-texts are not to be  used as subordinate members of acts, but have the purpose of  glorifying--as arthavadas--the injunctions with which they are connected  (Adhik. IV, 23, 24).--For all these reasons the urdhvaretasa/h/ require  no actions but only knowledge (Adhik. V, 25).--Nevertheless the actions  enjoined by Scripture, such as sacrifices, conduct of certain kinds,  &c., are required as conducive to the rise of vidya in the mind (Adhik.  VI, 26, 27).--Certain relaxations, allowed by Scripture, of the laws  regarding food, are meant only for cases of extreme need (Adhik. VII,  28-3l).--The a/s/ramakarma/n/i are obligatory on him also who does not  strive after mukti (Adhik. VIII, 32-35).--Those also who, owing to  poverty and so on, are ana/s/rama have claims to vidya (Adhik. IX,  36-39).--An urdhvaretas cannot revoke his vow (Adhik. X, 40).--Expiation  of the fall of an urdhvaretas (Ad"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16331"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War from the Beginning to March (#15)"],[1," He told the  Frenchman:         If Germany became involved and France became involved we had not       made up our minds what we should do; it was a case that we should       have to consider.... We were free from engagements and we should       have to decide what British interests required us to do.--(British       \"White Paper\" No. 87.)    M. Cambon remarked in reply that the Secretary of State had clearly  pictured the situation, but on the very following day the French  Ambassador took the liberty to remind Grey of the letter written in  1912. (British \"White Paper\" No. 105.)    Grey did not deny the claim implied in this reminder, but even as late  as July 31 he reports as follows concerning the conversation with  Cambon:         Up to the present moment we did not feel and public opinion       did not feel that any treaties or obligations of this country were       involved.... M. Cambon repeated his question whether we would help       France if Germany made an attack on her. I said I could only adhere       to the answer that, as far as things had gone at present, we could       not take any engagement.... I said that the Cabinet would certainly       be summoned as soon as there was some new development; that at the       present moment the only answer I could give was that we could not       undertake any definite engagement.--(British \"White Paper\" No.       119.)    Now, if we remember that even on the day before Grey had informed the  German Imperial Chancellor that it would be a shame for England to  remain neutral and allow France to be crushed, we here find a new proof  of the unreliability of his conduct. If he has been gullible, the  declaration of 1912, the dangerous character of which is increased by  its apparently undefined tenor, has enmeshed him more and more. Also the  military and naval circles, whose consultations with the representatives  of the French Army and Navy certainly have been continued diligently  since the beginning of the Servian crisis, were forcing toward a  decision.    At all events, it became more impossible with every hour for Germany to  keep England out of the way by any offers whatsoever. This is proved by  Grey's conversation of Aug. 1 with the German Ambassador:         He asked me whether if Germany gave a promise not to violate       Belgian neutrality we would engage to remain neutral. I replied       that I could not say that; our hands were still free, and we were       considering what our attitude should be.... The Ambassador pressed       me as to whether I could not formulate conditions on which we would       remain neutral. I said that I felt obliged to refuse definitely any       promise.... (British \"White Paper\" No. 123.)    Belgium Not the Cause.    Hence, only if Germany would permit herself to be humiliated war with  England could be avoided. The violation of Belgium's neutrality was in  no way the cause of England joining Germany's enemies, for while German  troops did not enter Belgium until the night from Aug. 3 to 4, Grey gave  on Aug. 2 the following memorandum to the French Ambassador after a  session of the Cabinet in London:         I am authorized to give an assurance that if the German fleet comes       into the Channel or through the North Sea to undertake hostile       operations against French coasts or shipping, the British fleet       will give all the protection in its power.--(British \"White Paper\"       No. 148.)    As the aim of this decision, of which M. Cambon was informed verbally,  was to give France an assurance that it would be placed in a position  \"to settle the disposition of its own Mediterranean fleet,\" Grey would  not accept the version of Cambon that England would take part in a war  with Germany. This is a case of splitting hairs in order to put the  blame of starting the war on Germany, for while England promised to  protect the French coast and to make it possible for the French fleet to  stay in the Mediterranean, she almost immediately proceeded to a warlike  action against Germany, especially as the English Minister  simultaneously refused to bind himself to maintain even this peculiar  neutrality.             *       *       *       *       *          IV.    BELGIAN NEUTRALITY.      The highest representatives of the German Empire with emphatic  seriousness declared that it was with a heavy heart and only following  the law of self-preservation that they decided to violate the neutrality  of the Kingdom of Belgium, guaranteed by the great powers in the  treaties of 1831 and 1839.    The German Secretary of State on Aug. 4 informed the English Government  through the embassy in London that Germany intended to retain no Belgian  territory, and added:         Please impress upon Sir E. Grey that German Army could not be       exposed to French attack across Belgium, which was planned,       according to absolutely unimpeachable information. Germany had       consequently to disregard Belgian neutrality, it being with her a       question of life or death to prevent French advance.--(British       \"White Paper\" No. 157.)    In answer Grey caused the English Ambassador in Berlin to demand his  passports and to tell the German Government that England would  take all steps for defense of Belgian neutrality. This, therefore,  represents, in the view which very cleverly has been spread broadcast by  British publicity, the real reason for the war. But in spite of the  moral indignation that is apparent against Germany, the consideration  for Belgium, up until very late, does not seem in any way to have been  in the foreground. We find on July 31 Grey stated to Cambon:         The preservation of the neutrality of Belgium might be, I would not       say a decisive, but an important, factor in determining our       attitude.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 119.)    Here, therefore, there was no talk about England grasping the sword on  account of Belgium. Now no one will claim that the assumption that the  German troops could march through Belgium would be new or unheard of.  For years this possibility had been discussed in military  literature.[04]    This expression on the part of the historical Faculty is very  interesting. It shows that a plan of campaign between the English and  French had long been considered, and that the Belgian entry into the  alliance against Germany was a matter agreed upon.    A Sudden Decision.    It must also be assumed that the Belgian Government knew toward the end  of July at the latest that the war between Germany and France was  probable and the march of Germans through Belgium very possible.    If England had not taken part in the war against Germany, it may be  assumed that it would have given Belgium the advice to permit the  marching through of the German Army, somewhat in the same manner as the  Grand Duchy of Luxemburg did, with a protest. In doing so the Belgian  people would have been spared a great deal of misery and loss of blood.  On Aug. 3 the Belgian Government replied to an offer of military help by  France as follows:         We are sincerely grateful to the French Government for offering       eventual support. In the actual circumstances, however, we do not       propose to appeal to the guarantee of the powers. Belgian       Government will decide later on the action which they may think       necessary to take.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 151.)    One day later London decided to make Belgian neutrality the cause of the  war against Germany before the eyes of the world. The Ambassador in  Brussels received the following orders:         You should inform Belgian Government that if pressure is applied to       them by Germany to induce them to depart from neutrality, his       Majesty's Government expects that they will resist by any means in       their power and that his Majesty's Government will support them in       offering such resistance, and that his Majesty's Government in this       event are prepared to join Russia and France.--(British \"White       Paper\" No. 155.)    Not until England thus stirred Belgium up, holding out the deceptive  hope of effective French and English help, did Belgian fanaticism break  loose against Germany. Without the intervention of England in Brussels  the events in Belgium, one may safely assert, would have taken an  entirely different course, which would have been far more favorable to  Belgium.    But, of course, England had thus found a very useful reason for war  against Germany. Even on the 31st of July Grey had spoken of the  violation of Belgian neutrality as not a decisive factor. On Aug. 1 he  declined to promise Prince Lichnowsky England's neutrality, even if  Germany would not violate Belgium's neutrality. On Aug. 4, however, the  Belgian question was the cause that suddenly drove England to maintain  the moral fabric of the world and to draw the sword.    This suddenly became the new development, which was still  lacking for Grey in order to justify this war before public opinion in  England.    Another English Advantage.    And something else was secured by the drawing of Belgium into the war by  the British Government, which had decided to make war on Germany for  entirely different reasons: the thankful part of the protector of the  weak and the oppressed.    As an English diplomat, when Russia was mobilizing, openly stated, the  interests of his country in Servia were nil, so for Grey even Belgium,  immediately before the break with Germany, was not decisive. However,  when England had irrevocably decided to enter the war it stepped out  before the limelight of the world as the champion of--the small nations.             *       *       *       *       *          [02] Recently a book entitled \"Why We Make War,\" in defense of Great  Britain, appeared at Oxford, as the authors of which \"Members of the  Faculty for Modern History in Oxford\" are mentioned.
