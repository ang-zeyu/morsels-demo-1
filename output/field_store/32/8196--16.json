As soon as a man died, his beard was shaved, his body washed, lime put  into his mouth, and women rubbed his face with rice. When the body was  burned, the deceased's ashes were thrown into the Ganges, for the  water of that river was supposed to have a virtuous and holy influence  on whatever it touched. The Brahmins believed that there were five  different degrees of glory after death. Bruma, with his wife  Sarassuadi, was in the fourth state attended by a large swan, on which  he rode abroad, this god being supposed to be exceedingly fond of  travelling. None but the most innocent were exalted to the fifth seat  of glory.    Cows' dung was spread over the floors of Indian temples; and such was  the people's reverence for the cow, that when sacrificing they poured  milk on their altars. Their priests pretended that their gods had  oracles, by which they could foretell future events. When several  persons were suspected of stealing anything, and the guilty one could  not be discovered by ordinary means, the priests wrote the names of  the suspected persons on different pieces of paper, and laid them down  before the altar, and invoked their oracle, after which they locked  the doors, so that no person could get in. When they returned and  found any paper removed, the person whose name was on it was declared  to be the criminal. On the priests addressing their oracles, they  became so excited that they remained for hours seemingly in great  agony. After recovering, they explained to the people the sayings of  the oracles. The Indians had tables of astronomy which they  consulted. When the moon was eclipsed, they believed she was fighting  with a black devil.    The Indians supposed that by means of magic a man could change himself  into the form of a lion or any other animal he chose. We have heard of  one John Gondalez, who changed himself into the shape of a lion, and  in that form was shot by a Spaniard. The day on which Gondalez was  fired at he was reported to be sick. A clergyman was called in to take  his confession. The pious man, in giving an account of what he saw and  heard, said, \"I saw Gondalez's face and nose all bruised, and asked  him how he had received the injuries. He told me that he had fallen  from a tree and nearly killed himself. After this he accused the  Spaniard of shooting at him. The affair was inquired into by a Spanish  justice of the peace. My evidence was taken, and I told what Gondalez  had said to me regarding his fall. The Spaniard swore that he had shot  at a lion in a thick wood, where an Indian was not likely to be.\"    Gondalez was examined as to how he was not seen by the Spaniard when  he went to look for the lion; to which he replied that he ran away  lest the Spaniard should kill him. As Gondalez's dealings with the  devil were well known to all in the neighbourhood, it was held that he  had received his injuries when roaming as a four-footed beast; and  therefore the justice discharged the Spaniard.

The gentleman (a clergyman) who told the story of John Gondalez, gives  another tale equally interesting. John Gomez, the chief of an Indian  town, was nearly eighty years of age, and reputed to be possessed of  more than ordinary shrewdness. His advice was preferred to that of all  other chiefs. He seemed to be a very godly Indian, and very seldom  missed morning and evening prayers in the church. \"He was suddenly  taken ill,\" proceeds the clergyman; \"and one of his friends, fearing  that he might die without making confession, called me up at midnight,  desiring me to go presently to John Gomez to help him to die. I  therefore visited Gomez, who lay with his face muffled. He confessed,  wept, and showed a willingness to die. I comforted him, after which I  returned home to refresh myself. Scarcely had I crossed the threshold  of my house than I was called on to visit the sick man a second time,  and give him extreme unction. As I anointed him on his nose, lips,  hands, eyes, and feet, I perceived he was swollen black and blue. I  went home again, and after I had rested a little, an Indian called to  buy candles to offer up for the soul of John Gomez, who, he told me,  had departed. I went to the church, and found the grave being prepared  for the deceased. Two Spaniards, to whom I spoke, told me of a great  stir being made in the town concerning the death of Gomez. Amused at  the information received, I desired a full and particular account of  the whole circumstances. They told me that Gomez was the chief wizard  of the town--that he was often changed into a tiger, and in that form  walked about the mountains. Wondering at this statement, I went  straight to the prison, where, I was told, I might obtain information  on the subject. At the stronghold the officers communicated to me the  whole matter. There were witnesses, they said, who saw a lion and a  tiger fighting, and presently lost sight of them, but saw in their  places Gomez and a man named Lopez. Gomez returned home much bruised,  and on his deathbed declared to his friends that Lopez had killed him.  Lopez was therefore taken into custody, and put in irons. The crown  officers investigated the case with great care, and found that the  body of Gomez was all bruised and torn in various places. Lopez, upon  this, was taken to Guatemala, and there hanged, the evidence against  him, in the estimation of the judges and people, being conclusive that  he had fatally injured Gomez while the former was in the shape of a  tiger, and the latter in the likeness of a lion.\"    The inhabitants of Bisnagar, Deccan, and elsewhere believed that the  moment a priest marked any one on the forehead with vermilion, the  devil had no power over the person thus distinguished. At Samorin  there was a statue to which children were sacrificed. It was of brass,  and, when heated by a furnace underneath it, the children were thrown  into its mouth and consumed. Flowers were scattered upon the altars  during the sacrifices, and herbs, steeped in the blood of a cock,  perfumed the idol. The cock's throat was cut with a silver knife  dipped in the blood of a hen. At the conclusion of the barbarous  ceremony, the priest walked backwards from the altar to the middle of  the chapel, where he threw a handful of corn over his head.    The Ganges, as is well known, was, and still is, worshipped by a large  number of people. Vast numbers of pilgrims continually visit this  great river. Formerly, if not now, they bathed in it in a peculiar  fashion, holding short straws in their hands while they were  performing their ablutions. Gold and silver were often thrown into the  stream, in testimony of admiration.    At Quailacara a remarkable ceremony took place once every twelve  years. On the morning of the important day, the rajah, who was both  high priest and sovereign, offered himself a sacrifice to the gods. He  first delivered an oration, and then with a sharp instrument cut off  his nose, lips, and ears, and concluded the tragical event by cutting  his throat. Similar ceremonies were performed in the same district by  scores of deluded devotees, who bent their steps to the most  celebrated temples, where they cut off their flesh, piece by piece,  and then stabbed themselves to death. Their bodies were burned, and  the ashes sold by the priests at high sums, as preservatives against  disease. When the people came to bathe in the Ganges in the month of  May, they erected piles of cows' dung, on which were placed baskets of  rice, roots, and every description of vegetables. These were  surrounded with wood besmeared with butter, and set on fire. From the  appearance of the smoke and flame, those present pretended to discover  whether the harvest was to be abundant or otherwise. At seed-time the  priests took branches from trees, and walked in procession with them,  going three times round the temples. A hole was then dug in the  ground, and water from the Ganges poured into it. In this hole cows'  dung and the branches were put and set on fire, and from the  appearance of the flames the arch-priest was enabled to foretell what  was to happen during the year. When a person was dying, he was carried  to a river and dipped into it, that his soul and body might be  purified. Happy was the individual who could be conveyed to the  Ganges, because its waters were supposed to be possessed of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19946"],[0,"Villa Elsa (#15)"],[1,"game, as Gard learned, was to obtain favors  in exchange for nothing as far as possible. Trickery, lies, abuse,  kicks, were employed to this purpose. Female chastity? A fable for  the impotent. Consequently all was fair.    Sisters of their respected fellows were inferentially appraised and  colloquially \"hefted\" as articles of social commerce ready to be  knocked off matrimonially to the best bidder under the material  rules of the German _Mitgift_ system. Through the garish films of  innuendo and braggadocio that day Kirtley was led to behold images  of these daughters as if they were languishing to become mates and  beating their breasts in their longing to become mothers. He had by  no means now forgotten Friedrich's equivocal remarks about Elsa.    Before Gard was to leave Deutschland he had to conclude that the  German puts himself in the attitude of thinking of his women as  sluttish and accordingly acting in that scale toward them. There  is no great gilding to these fancies. Girls are small inspiration  to him compared with what the _petites dames_ are to the amorous  Frenchman. Idealization of love in its ultimate fulfillment, the  poetizing of the ardent flesh crying out for its craving mate,  are characteristically ignored by the Teuton who seeks the baser  gratifications without illuminations of loveliness or hesitations  of delicate refinement.    Kirtley thought he knew young men, yet this revolting capacity in  them in Germany was proven to him to be not unnormal by its openness  and by the dearth of any loud voices in rebuke. The German is  conspicuously full of animal spirits. He affects the mighty in  physique. Exudations and emanations are frank and prominent  functions.    Under the Kaiser the Berlin dame who rented rooms to the foreign  student, offering them \"with\" or \"without,\" meaning sometimes her  own daughter in the bargain, considered herself respectable enough.  More than this she acted in line with what appeared to be the  purpose of acquiring a sympathetic control of the morals as well as  the minds of the alien sojourner, the one being accompanied by a  pandering to his lower nature with the doors of vice flagrantly ajar  while the other armed his mentality with a Teutonized equipment and  outlook. To sap the will, to galvanize the mind as from a German  electric battery, palsied resistance to aggressive Germania. It was  of a piece with that propaganda which the world was not to wake up  to until almost too late.    These downright animal phases pointed the way logically, in Gard's  mind, to that obscenity which is interwoven in the German  civilization. He had first come across such evidence in leading  comic journals. The drawings and jests that did not leave much to  be filled out, adorned many a German page with an Adamic candor. It  divorced him from _Simplicissimus_ and _Ulk_, not that he was  squeamish or a Miss Priscilla, but he saw no fun in that sort of  thing.    He talked of it later with Anderson. Though there were pleasant  delusions in Anderson's mind about Germany before he arrived, it was  not his fault if few seemed to be left after his seven years. He  bluntly defined the limited German wit and humor as  characteristically born of the latrine.    Gard's two young friends did not refrain from talk in the key of  indecency. Their complacent revelation of the extent to which the  pornographic enters into the German scene, suggested an unclosed  Priapean volume whose companion in America is as a sealed book.  Kirtley heard that stores filled with obscene objects publicly for  sale were to be found on frequented thoroughfares in German cities.    He saw that Frau Bucher's insistence on a chaperone, which he had  regarded a silly, outworn conventionality, appeared most wise.  Germany was a poor place for an unguarded German girl.    This ran through his mind:    \"Great Guns! What a country for me to study for the ministry, study  morality, best fit myself for life, as advised by Rebner and, it  seems--everybody!\"          CHAPTER XVIII    THE NAKED CULT      The German, in all this physical aspect, is not a little like an  unabashed ape. Accordingly the foreigner in Deutschland is impressed  by the popular worship of the wide-hipped female. The Teuton can  leave little to be inferred but that he is more interested in the  magnet of her developed hips than in the magic of her brain.    American women, with their slender waists and chaste frigidness born  of Plymouth Rock, with their rulership in the home, their influence  permeating conspicuously in matters of public interest out of the  home, their entire freedom to be courted and married or let alone in  unbounded respect--how long would these conditions have been  permitted by the Gothic Kaiser if heedless America had fallen into  his gradually tightening grip? Doubtless to his view Yankee women  were treated too much like dolls. They are not breeders of  soldiers, makers of kingdoms. They do not rear children for the  State. What have they desirably in common with the disciplined  Hausfrau who becomes the mother of the ruling future generations?  _She_ is properly the chattel of the Government.    And so it is not enough, as Gard recognized, for Frau or Fraeulein to  be massive of line and fond of being upholstered in dense colors in  order to satisfy the general grossness of her male. It is not enough  that she should be armed with strong hands, planted on large feet,  and decorated in the German's favorite rococo manner of abounding  breasts, to gratify his cyclopean aspirations.    \"Big hips mean big women and big women mean big empires.\" The sex  fecund, ardent for mating and offspring, is the type. And thus  fatness, which obviously and indisputably fills out the picture, is  a popular German female attribute. Von Tielitz and Messer made it  plain that obesity and width of girth characterized the transient  objects of their amours. And their allusions gave every evidence  that the famous Naked Cult, to the fascinations of which Fraeulein  Wasserhaus, with her bared and redundant bosom, was yielding, had  been claiming the German youth for its own.    Germany was recovering from this rage for nudity which had assumed  some proportions. Starting from the only artistic section of the  Empire, namely Bavaria, this cult had knocked even against the  gloomy portals of the Pommeranian churches in the north. The Teuton  had suddenly discovered that it was right and proper in his godship,  as it was in the realm of the Greek deities, to go about naked. It  was natural, healthful, and both beautiful and moral.    German men and women, in their divinity, should bathe, drink beer,  dance together nude. What else did Grecian sculpture teach to these  the modern Greeks--the true legatees of all that was Hellenic? What  else did painting inculcate but the beauty of undraped couples  wandering through landscapes? What more majestic spectacle than that  of the Teuton father, mother and children going out for an afternoon  promenade, clothed only in the ingenuous consciousness of their  human greatness?    In a race of beings so little modeled after the accepted lines of  pulchritude, all this was laughable. But to the German, condemned  to a vise-like seriousness and to childlikeness, it became  significant and weighty. It was such a grateful revelation not to  have to dream of his loved ones through the unsatisfactory medium of  German clothing.    With his customary excess of logic he plunged headlong into these  ardent waves of the realm of Venus rising unimpeachably from the sea  in her immortal bareness. He began to systematize this  demonstration. Some of the political parties seemed to be in line to  favor this revealment of another radical tenet. German philosophers  made ready to seize upon it with huge mental biceps and labor to  incorporate it beneficently into the Teuton pansophy. Even doctors  of theology were said to view the novel dispensation through the  blue spectacles of their didacticism, and to hesitate and stumble  over the question of greeting these glad visions of a glad  apocalypse. What was truer Protestantism than that there is the  natural body as well as the spiritual body, and that it would be  virtuous to behold outwardly the former as it was virtuous to  recognize inwardly the latter?    The campaign became almost lively. Of course the young Germans,  whose fathers and mothers in their youth had raved over Wagner and  thus shocked their elders, raved over a departure that linked such  possibilities of frankness and loveliness so delectably together.  The Von Tielitzes and Messers were in the seventh heaven.    But Germany, being a northern country ruled severely in the main by  old men, was bound to feel in the end more comfortable in clothes.  Climate governs male and female alike and shapes their habits to its  own tyrannical mandates. The Teutons were doomed to suggest flannel.  So a vast moral revulsion in the form of the much German clothedness  finally rose up and overwhelmed the religion of Nudity--the _Nackt  Kultur_. Although the Teuton male likes to contemplate himself and  be contemplated as candid Mother Nature made him, he could not adapt  himself to the idea of his fleshy women appearing naked before a  critical and commenting world. Momus had at last arrived in ancient  Deutschland and was feared.    While the movement, which was presuming to cover Germany with  sculptures of its heroes in complete undress, honored itself by  such fitting testimonials to their lordliness, Fritz curiously  shrank before public statues depicting his fat housewife in like  absence of attire. This was illogical besides being unsatisfactory  to those who had insisted on worshipping the German female form _al  fresco_. The vital point being thus dodged, there was left nothing  interesting in the way of legs for the Naked Cult to stand on, and  it dropped out of sight as suddenly as it had"]]]
