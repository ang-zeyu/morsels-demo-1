Paper gives a most comfortable look to  the rooms, more so than paint, and much less expensive, while nothing is  so sweet, tidy, and cheerful to the _working_ rooms of the house as a  _lime_ wash, either white, or softened down with some agreeable tint,  such as _light_ blue, green, drab, fawn, or russet, to give the shade  desired, and for which every _professional_ painter and whitewasher in  the vicinity, can furnish a proper recipe applicable to the place and  climate. On such subjects we choose to prescribe, rather than to play  the apothecary by giving any of the thousand and one recipes extant, for  the composition.    Our remarks upon the strength and durability of _material_ in  house-building do not apply exclusively to brick and stone. Wood is  included also; and of this, there is much difference in the kind. Sound  _white_ oak, is, perhaps the best material for the heavy frame-work of  any house or out-building, and when to be had at a moderate expense, we  would recommend it in preference to any other. If _white_ oak cannot be  had, the other varieties of oak, or chesnut are the next best. In  _light_ frame-timbers, such as studs, girts, joists, or rafters, oak is  inclined to spring and warp, and we would prefer hemlock, or chesnut,  which holds a nail equally as well, or, in its absence, pine, (which  holds a nail badly,) whitewood, or black walnut. The outside finish to a  wooden house, may be _lighter_ than in one of stone or brick. The wood  work on the outside of the latter should always be heavy, and in  character with the walls, giving an air of firmness and stability to the  whole structure. No elaborate carving, or beadwork should be permitted  on the outside work of a country house at all; and only a sufficient  quantity of ornamental _tracery_ of any kind, to break the monotony of a  plainness that would otherwise give it a formal, or uncouth expression,  and relieve it of what some would consider a pasteboard look. A farm  house, in fact, of any degree, either cheap or expensive, should wear  the same appearance as a well-dressed person of either sex; so that a  stranger, not looking at them for the purpose of inspecting their garb,  should, after an interview, be unable to tell what particular sort of  dress they wore, so perfectly in keeping was it with propriety.    In the design now under discussion, a cellar is made under the whole  body of the house; and this cellar is a _shallow_ one, so far as being  sunk into the ground is concerned, say 5-1/2 feet, leaving 2-1/2 feet of  cellar wall above ground--8 feet in all. A part of the wall above ground  should be covered by the excavated earth, and sloped off to a level with  the surrounding surface. A commodious, well-lighted, and well-ventilated  cellar is one of the most important apartments of the farm house. It  should, if the soil be compact, be well drained from some point or  corner within the walls into a lower level outside, to which point  within, the whole floor surface should incline, and the bottom be  floored with water-lime cement. This will make it hard, durable, and  dry. It may then be washed and scrubbed off as easily as an upper floor.  If the building site be high, and in a gravelly, or sandy soil, neither  drain nor flooring will be required. The cellar may be used for the  storage of root crops, apples, meats, and household vegetables. A  partitioned room will accommodate either a summer or a winter dairy, if  not otherwise provided, and a multitude of conveniences may be made of  it in all well arranged farmeries. But in all cases the cellar should be  well lighted, ventilated, and dry. Even the ash-house and smoke-house  may be made in it with perfect convenience, by brick or stone  partitions, and the smoke-house flue be carried up into one of the  chimney flues above, and thus make a more snug and compact arrangement  than to have separate buildings for those objects. A wash-room, in  which, also, the soap may be made, the tallow and lard tried up, and  other extraordinary labor when fire heat is to be used, may properly be  made in a cellar, particularly when on a sloping ground, and easy of  access to the ground level on one side. But, as a general rule, such  room is better on a level with the main floor of the dwelling, and there  are usually sufficient occupations for the cellar without them.    All cellar walls should be at least 18 inches thick, for even a wooden  house, and from that to 2 feet for a stone or brick one, and well laid  in strong lime-mortar. Unmortared cellar walls are frequently laid under  wooden buildings, and _pointed_ with lime-mortar inside; but this is  sometimes dug out by rats, and is apt to crumble and fall out otherwise.  A _complete_ cellar wall should be thoroughly laid in mortar.            [Illustration: FARM HOUSE. Pages 101-102.]    DESIGN III.      We here present the reader with a substantial, plain, yet  highly-respectable stone or brick farm house, of the second class,  suitable for an estate of three, to five hundred acres, and  accommodation for a family of a dozen or more persons. The style is  mixed rural Gothic, Italian, and bracketed; yet in keeping with the  character of the farm, and the farmer's standing and occupation.    The main body of this house is 42x24 feet on the ground, and one and  three quarter stories high--the chambers running two or three feet into  the roof, as choice or convenience may direct. The roof has a pitch of  30 to 40deg from a horizontal line, and broadly spread over the walls,  say two and a half feet, showing the ends of the rafters, bracket  fashion. The chimneys pass out through the peak of the roof, where the  hips of what would otherwise be the gables, connect with the long sides  of the roof covering the front and rear. On the long front is partly  seen, in the perspective, a portico, 16x10 feet--not the _chief_  entrance front, but rather a side front, practically, which leads into a  lawn or garden, as may be most desirable, and from which the best view  from the house is commanded. Over this porch is a small gable running  into the roof, to break its monotony, in which is a door-window leading  from the upper hall on to the deck of the porch. This gable has the same  finish as the main roof, by brackets. The chamber windows are two-thirds  or three-quarters the size of the lower ones; thus showing the upper  story not full height below the plates, but running two to four feet  into the garret. The rear wing, containing the entrance or business  front, is 24x32 feet, one and a half stories high, with a pitch of roof  not less than 35deg, and spread over the walls both at the eaves and  gable, in the same proportion as the roof to the main body. In front of  this is a porch or veranda eight feet wide, with a low, hipped roof. In  the front and rear roofs of this wing is a dormer window, to light the  chambers. The gable to this wing is bold, and gives it character by the  breadth of its roof over the walls, and the strong brackets by which it  is supported. The chimney is thrown up strong and boldly at the point of  the roof, indicating the every-day uses of the fireplaces below, which,  although distinct and wide apart in their location on the ground floors,  are drawn together in the chambers, thus showing only one escape through  the roof.    The wood-house in the rear of the wing has a roof of the same character,  and connects with the long building in the rear, which has the same  description of roof, but hipped at one end. That end over the workshop,  and next the wood-house, shows a bold gable like the wing of the house,  and affords room and light to the lumber room over the shop, and also  gives variety and relief to the otherwise too great sameness of  roof-appearance on the further side of the establishment.      [Illustration: GROUND PLAN. CHAMBER PLAN.]      INTERIOR ARRANGEMENT.    As has been remarked, the main entrance front to this house is from the  wing veranda, from which a well finished and sizeable door leads into  the principal hall, 24x8 feet in area, and lighted by a full-sized  window at the front end. Opposite the entrance door is the door leading  into the parlor; and farther along is the staircase, under the upper  landing of which a door leads into a dining or sitting-room, as may be  determined. This hall is 10 feet high, as are all the rooms of this  lower main story. In the chimney, which adjoins the parlor side of this  hall, may be inserted a thimble for a hall stovepipe, if this method of  warming should be adopted. The parlor, into which a door leads from the  hall, is 18x16 feet, with two windows on the side, shown in perspective,  and one on the front facing the lawn, or garden. It has also a fireplace  near the hall door. At the further angle is a door leading to an entry  or passage on to the portico. E is the entry just mentioned, six feet  square, and lighted by a short sash, one light deep, over the outside  door. This portico may be made a pleasant summer afternoon and evening  resort for the family, by which the occupied rooms connect with the lawn  or garden, thus adding to its retired and private character.    Opposite the parlor, on the other side of this entry, a door leads into  a room 18x12 feet, which may be occupied as a family bedroom, library,  or small sitting-room. This is lighted by two windows, and has a closet  of 6x5 feet. A fireplace is on the inner side of this room; and near to  that, a door connects with a dining-room of the same size, having a  window in one end, and a fireplace, and closet of the same size as the  last. Through the rear wall is a door leading into a pantry, which also  communicates with the kitchen; and another door leads to the hall, and  from the hall, under the staircases, (which, at that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/200"],[0,"The Project Gutenberg Encyclopedia, Volume 1 of 28 (#15)"],[1,") is a long building (C), probably  the almonry, with a dormitory above for the lower class of  guests.  On the other side is a chapel (D). As soon as the  porter heard a stranger knock at the gate, he rose, saying,  Deo gratias, the opportunity for the exercise of hospitality  being regarded as a cause for thankfulness.  On opening the  door he welcomed the new arrival with a blessing --Benedicite.  He fell on his knees before him, and then went to inform the  abbot.  However important the abbot's occupations might  be, he at once hastened to receive him whom heaven had  sent.  He also threw himself at his guest's feet, and  conducted him to the chapel (D) purposely built close to the  gate.  After a short prayer, the abbot committed the guest  to the care of the brother hospitaller, whose duty it was  to provide for his wants and conduct the beast on which he  might be riding to the stable (F), built adjacent to the inner  gatehouse (E). This inner gate conducted into the base court  (T), round which were placed the barns, stables, cow-sheds, &c.  On the eastern side stood the dormitory of the lay brothers,  fratres conversi (G), detached from the cloister, with  cellars and storehouses below.  At H, also outside the monastic  buildings proper, was the abbot's house, and annexed to it the  guest-house.  For these buildings there was a separate door  of entrance into the church (S). The large cloister, with its  surrounding arcades, is seen at V. On the south end projects  the refectory (K), with its kitchen at I, accessible from  the base court.  The long gabled building on the east side of  the cloister contained on the ground floor the chapter-house  and calefactory, with the monks' dormitory above (M),  communicating with the south transept of the church.  At L  was the staircase to the dormitory.  The small cloister is at  W, where were the carols or cells of the scribes, with the  library (P) over, reached by a turret staircase.  At R we see  a portion of the infirmary.  The whole precinct is surrounded  by a strong buttressed wall (XXX), pierced with arches,                FIG. 8.---Bird's-eye view of       A.

The tower, in  accordance with the Cistercian rule, is very low.  The windows  throughout accord with the studied simplicity of the order.    Kirkstall Abbey.    The English Cistercian houses, of which there are such extensive  and beautiful remains at Fountains, Rievaulx, Kirkstall,  Tintern, Netley, &c., were mainly arranged after the same  plan, with slight local variations.  As an example, we give  the groundplan of Kirkstall Abbey. which is one of the best  preserved.  The church here is of the Cistercian type, with  a short chancel of two squares, and transepts with three  eastward chapels to each, divided by solid walls (2 2 2).  The whole is of the most studied plainness.  The windows  are unornamented, and the nave has no triforium.  The  cloister to the south (4) occupies the whole length of the  nave.  On the east side stands the two-aisled chapter-house  (5), between which and the south transept is a small  sacristy (3), and on the other side two small apartments,  one of which was probably the parlour (6). Beyond this  stretches southward the calefactory or day-room of the monks  (14).  Above this whole range of building runs the monks'  dormitory, opening by stairs into the south transept of the  church.  At the other end were the necessaries.  On thc south  side of the cloister we have the remains of the old refectory  (11), running, as in Benedictine houses, from east to west,  and the new refectory (12), which, with the increase of the  inmates of the house, superseded it, stretching, as is usual  in Cistercian houses, from north to south.  Adjacent to this  apartment are the remains of the kitchen, pantry and buttery.  The arches of the lavatory are to be seen near the refectory  entrance.  The western side of the cloister is, as usual,  occupied by vaulted cellars, supporting on the upper story  the dormitory of the lay brothers (8).

Infirmary or abbot's house.      south-east angle of the main group of buildings are the  walls and foundations of a secondary group of considerable  extent.  These have been identified either with the hospitium  or with the abbot's house, but they occupy the position in  which the infirmary is more usually found.  The hall was  a very spacious apartment, measuring 83 ft. in length by  48 ft. 9 in. in breadth, and was divided by two rows of  columns.  The fish-ponds lay between the monastery and  the river to the south.  The abbey mill was situated  about 80 yards to the north-west.  The millpool may be  distinctly traced, together with the gowt or mill stream.    Fountains Abbey.    Fountains Abbey, first founded A.D. 1132, is one of the  largest and best preserved Cistercian houses in England.  But the earlier buildings received considerable additions  and alterations in the later period of the order, causing  deviations from the strict Cistercian type.  The church  stands a short distance to the north of the river Skell, the  buildings of the abbey stretching down to and even across the  stream.  We have the cloister (H) to the south, with the  three-aisled chapter-house (I) and calefactory (L) opening from  its eastern walk, and the refectory (S), with the kitchen (Q)  and buttery (T) attached, at right angles to its southern walk.

Parallel with the western walk is an immense vaulted substructure  (U), incorrectly styled the cloisters, serving as cellars and  store-rooms, and supporting the dormitory of the conversi  above.  This building extended across the river.  At its S.W.  corner were the necessaries (V), also built, as usual, above  the swiftly flowing stream.  The monks' dormitory was in its  usual position above the chapter-house, to the south of the  transept.  As peculiarities of arrangement may be noticed  the position of the kitchen (Q), between the refectory and  calefactory, and of the infirmary (W) (unless there is some  error in its designation) above the river to the west, adjoining  the guest-houses (XX).  We may also call attention to the  greatly lengthened choir, commenced by Abbot John of York,  1203-1211, and carried on by his successor, terminating, like  Durham Cathedral, in an eastern transept, the work of Abbot  John of Kent, 1220-1247, and to the tower (D), added not long  before the dissolution by Abbot Huby, 1494-1526, in a very  unusual position at the northern end of the north transept.  The abbot's house, the largest and most remarkable example of  this class of buildings in the kingdom, stands south to the  east of the church and cloister, from which it is divided by  the kitchen court (R), surrounded by the ordinary domestic  offices.  A considerable portion of this house was erected on  arches over the Skell.  The size and character of this house,  probably, at the time of its erection, the most spacious  house of a subject in the kingdom, not a castle, bespeaks  the wide departure of the Cistercian order from the stern  simplicity of the original foundation.  The hall (2) was one  of the most spacious and magnificent apartments in medieval  times, measuring 170 ft. by 70 ft.  Like the hall in the  castle at Winchester, and Westminster Hall, as originally  built, it was divided by 18 pillars and arches, with 3  aisles.  Among other apartments, for the designation of which  we must refer to the ground-plan, was a domestic oratory or  chapel, 46 1/2 ft. by 23 ft. and a kitchen (7), 50 ft. by 38  ft.  The whole arrangements and character of the building  bespeak the rich and powerful feudal lord, not the humble  father of a body of hard-working brethren, bound by vows to a  life of poverty and self-denying toil.
