[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18891"],[0,"Dot and the Kangaroo (#15)"],[1,"  Dot thought this chattering very stupid, so she went round a bush to  where the old fathers of the bower birds were perched. They were grave  old fellows, arrayed in their satin blue-black plumage, and she found  them all, more or less, in a grumbling humour.    \"Birds at our time of life should not have to attend parties,\" said  several, and Dot wondered why they came. \"How are you, old neighbour?\"  said one to another. \"Terribly bored!\" was the reply. \"How long must we  stay, do you think?\" asked another. \"Oh! until these young fools have  finished amusing themselves,\" answered its friend. The only satin birds  who seemed to Dot to be interested in one another, were some engaged in  discussing the scarcity of berries and the wrongs done to bower birds  by White Humans destroying the wild fig and lillipilli trees. This  grievance, and the question as to what berries or figs agreed best with  each old bower bird's digestion, were the only topics discussed with any  animation.    Dot soon tired of listening to the birds, and returned to the Kangaroo,  who asked her if she cared to stay any longer. The little girl said she  had seen and heard enough, and, judging by this one, she didn't care for  parties.    \"Neither do I,\" whispered the Kangaroo; \"they make me feel tired; and,  somehow, they seem to remind one of everything one knows that's sad, in  spite of all the gaiety.\"    \"Is it gay?\" enquired Dot, hesitating a little in her speech, for she  had felt rather dull and miserable.    \"Well, everyone says it's gay, and there is always a deal of noise, so I  suppose it is,\" answered the Kangaroo.    \"I'd rather be in your pouch, so let us go away,\" entreated Dot; and  they left the bower place without any of the birds noticing their  departure, for they were all busy gossiping, or discussing the great  berry or digestion questions.    It was towards evening when they reached an open plain, and here they  met an Emu. As both Dot and the Kangaroo were thirsty, they asked the  Emu the way to a waterhole or tank.    \"I am going to a tank now,\" replied the Emu; \"let us proceed together.\"    \"Do you think it will be safe to drink to-night\"; enquired the Kangaroo  anxiously.    \"Well, to tell the truth,\" said the Emu lightly, \"it is likely to be a  little difficult. There is a somewhat strained feeling between the White  Humans and ourselves just now. In consequence, we have to resort to a  little strategy on our visits to the tanks, and we avoid eating anything  tempting left about at camping places.\"    \"Are they laying poison for _you_?\" asked the Kangaroo in horrified tones.    \"They are doing something of the kind, we think,\" answered the Emu  airily, \"for some of us have had most unpleasant symptoms after picking  up morsels at camping grounds. Several have died. We were quite  surprised, for hitherto there has been no better cure for Emu  indigestion than wire nails, hoop iron, and preserved milk cans. The  worst symptoms have yielded to scraps of barbed wire in my own case. But  these Emus died in spite of all remedies.\"    \"But I heard,\" said the Kangaroo, \"that Emus were protected by the  Government. I never understood why.\"    \"We are protected,\" said the huge bird, \"because we form part of the  Australian Arms.\"    \"So do we,\" said the Kangaroo, \"but we are not protected.\"    \"True,\" said the bird, \"but the Humans can make some money out of you  when you are dead, whereas we serve no purpose at all, excepting alive,  when we add a charm to the scenery; and, moreover, each of our eggs will  make a pound cake. But the time will come, friend, when there will be  neither Emu nor Kangaroo for Australia's Arms; no creature will be left  to represent the land but the Bunny Rabbit and the Sheep.\"    \"I hate sheep!\" said the Kangaroo, \"they eat all our grass.\"    \"You have not studied them as we have,\" answered the Emu. \"They are most  entertaining. We have great fun with them, and we've learnt some capital  sheep games from those dogs Humans drive them with. It's really exciting  to drive a big mob, when they want to break and scatter. We were chasing  them, here and there, all over the plain to-day.\"    \"I don't like sheep!\" said Dot, \"they are so stupid.\"    \"So they are,\" agreed the Emu, \"and that is what puzzles me. What is it  about the sight of sheep that excites one so? When one gets into a big  flock, one has to dance, one can't help oneself. We had a great dance in  a flock to-day, and the lambs would get under our feet, so I'm sorry to  say a good many of them were killed.\"    \"Men will certainly kill you, if you do that,\" said Dot.    \"We know it,\" chuckled the Emu; \"that is why the tank is not quite safe  just now. But this evening I will show you a new plan by which to learn  if Humans are camped at a tank, or not. We have played the trick with  great success for several nights.\"    Conversing thus, the Emu, the Kangaroo, and Dot wandered on until the  Emu requested them to wait for a few minutes, whilst it peeped at the  tank, which was still a long way off.    It presently returned and said that it felt quite suspicious, because  everything looked so clear and safe. \"From this point of high ground,\"  said the bird, \"you can watch our proceedings. I will now give the  signal and return to my post here.\"    The Emu then ran at a great pace along the edge of the plain, and  emitted a strange rattling cry. After disappearing from sight for a  time, it returned hurriedly to where Dot and her friend were waiting.    \"Now, see!\" said the Emu, nodding at the distant side of the plain.    Dot's eyes were not so keen of sight as those of an Emu; but she thought  she could see something like a little cloud of dust, far, far away  across the dry brown grass of the plain. Soon she was quite sure that  the little cloud was advancing towards her side of the plain, and in the  direction of the tank. As it came nearer she could see the bobbing heads  of Emus, popping up above the dust, and she could see some of the birds  running round the little cloud.    \"What is the cause of all that dust?\" she asked the Emu.    \"Sheep!\" it answered with a merry chuckle.    \"But what are the Emus doing with the sheep?\" asked Dot and the  Kangaroo, now fully interested in the Emu's manoeuvre.    \"They are driving them to water at the tank,\" said the bird, highly  delighted with the scheme. \"The sheep will soon know that they are near  water, and will go to it without driving. Then we shall watch, and if  they quietly drink and scatter, it will be safe for us, but if they see  anything unusual and break, and run--well, we shan't drink at the tank  to-night. There will be Humans and dogs there, and we don't cultivate  their society just now.\"    \"Really that is the cleverest thing I have heard for a long time,\" said  the Kangaroo, full of admiration for the trick. \"How did you jump to  that conclusion?\"    \"The idea sprang upon us,\" answered the Emu, with an immense hop in the  air, and a dancing movement when it came to the ground again. \"Dear me!\"  it exclaimed, \"the sight of those sheep is beginning to excite me, and I  can hardly keep still! I wonder what there is so exciting about sheep!\"    Dot could now see the advancing flock of sheep, with their attendant mob  of Emu, quite well. The animals had got scent of the water, and with  contented bleatings were slowly moving with a rippling effect across the  dusty plain. The mob of Emu soon left the sheep to go their own way,  and, grouped in a cluster, watched, with bobbing heads, every movement  of the flock.    Dot, the Kangaroo, and the Emu looked towards the tank with silent  interest. \"I'm stationed here,\" whispered the bird, \"to give a warning  in case there is any danger in this direction. Emus are posted all round  the tank on the same duty.\"    Dot could see the whole scene well, for beyond a few low shrubs on the  opposite side of the sheet of water, there was no sheltering bush near  the great tank which had been excavated on the bare plain.    [Illustration: THE EMUS HUNTING THE SHEEP]    Onward came the sheep, and quite stationary in the distance remained the  Emu mob. Just as the first sheep were descending the deep slope of the  tank, a Plover rose from amongst the bushes with a shrill cry. The Emu  started at the sound, and whispered to the Kangaroo, \"There'll be no  drink to-night: watch!\"    The cry of the Plover seemed to arrest the advance of the timid sheep:  they waited in a closely-packed flock, looking around. But presently the  old leader gave a deep bleat, and they moved forward towards the water.  \"Shriek! Shriek!\" cried the Plover from the bushes, screaming as they  rose and flew away; and suddenly the flock of sheep broke and hurried  back to the open plain. At the same instant Dot could hear the sharp  barking of a sheep dog, a noise that produced an instant effect on the  creatures she was with. With lightning speed the Kangaroo had popped her  into her pouch and was hopping away, and the Emu was striding with its  long legs as fast as it could for the cover of the Bush.    Just as they entered the Bush shelter, Dot peeped out of the pouch,  across the plain, and could see the mob of Emu in a cloud of dust,  running, and almost out of sight.    When they had reached a place of safety, the friendly Emu bid the  Kangaroo and Dot good-night. \"We shall have to go thirsty to-night,\" it  said, \"but there will be a heavy dew, and the grass will be wet enough  to cool one's mouth. That pretty trick of ours was such a success that  it is almost worth one's while to lose one's drink in proving it.\"  Turning to Dot it said, \"You will be able to tell the big Humans that we  Emus are not such fools as they think, and that we find their flocks of  silly sheep most useful and entertaining animals.\"    Chuckling to itself, the Emu strode off, leaving Dot and the Kangaroo to  pass another night in the solitude of the Bush.          CHAPTER XI      The next day"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18900"],[0,"A Text-Book of the History of Painting (#15)"],[1," was undoubtedly influenced by Giovanni Bellini.  In subject he was more romantic and chivalric than religious, though  painting a number of altar-pieces. The legend was his delight, and his  great success, as the St. Ursula and St. George pictures in Venice  still indicate. He was remarkable for his knowledge of architecture,  costumes, and Oriental settings, put forth in a realistic way, with  much invention and technical ability in the handling of landscape,  perspective, light, and color. There is a truthfulness of  appearance--an out-of-doors feeling--about his work that is quite  captivating. In addition, the spirit of his art was earnestness,  honesty, and sincerity, and even the awkward bits of drawing which  occasionally appeared in his work served to add to the general naive  effect of the whole.    [Illustration: FIG. 37.--ANTONELLO DA MESSINA. UNKNOWN MAN. LOUVRE.]    Cima da Conegliano (1460?-1517?) was probably a pupil of Giovanni  Bellini, with some Carpaccio influence about him. He was the best of  the immediate followers, none of whom came up to the master. They were  trammelled somewhat by being educated in distemper work, and then  midway in their careers changing to the oil medium, that medium  having been introduced into Venice by Antonello da Messina in 1473.  Cima's subjects were largely half-length madonnas, given with strong  qualities of light-and-shade and color. He was not a great originator,  though a man of ability. Catena (?-1531) had a wide reputation in his  day, but it came more from a smooth finish and pretty accessories than  from creative power. He imitated Bellini's style so well that a number  of his pictures pass for works by the master even to this day. Later  he followed Giorgione and Carpaccio. A man possessed of knowledge, he  seemed to have no original propelling purpose behind him. That was  largely the make-up of the other men of the school, Basaiti  (1490-1521?), Previtali (1470?-1525?), Bissolo (14641528), Rondinelli  (1440?-1500?), Diana (?-1500?), Mansueti (fl. 1500).    Antonello da Messina (1444?-1493), though Sicilian born, is properly  classed with the Venetian school. He obtained a knowledge of Flemish  methods probably from Flemish painters or pictures in Italy (he never  was a pupil of Jan van Eyck, as Vasari relates, and probably never saw  Flanders), and introduced the use of oil as a medium in the Venetian  school. His early work was Flemish in character, and was very accurate  and minute. His late work showed the influence of the Bellinis. His  counter-influence upon Venetian portraiture has never been quite  justly estimated. That fine, exact, yet powerful work, of which the  Doge Loredano by Bellini, in the National Gallery, London, is a type,  was perhaps brought about by an amalgamation of Flemish and Venetian  methods, and Antonello was perhaps the means of bringing it about. He  was an excellent, if precise, portrait-painter.         PRINCIPAL WORKS: PADUANS--Andrea Mantegna, Eremitani Padua,       Madonna of S.

THE HIGHEST DEVELOPMENT: The word \"Renaissance\" has a broader meaning  than its strict etymology would imply. It was a \"new birth,\" but  something more than the revival of Greek learning and the study of  nature entered into it. It was the grand consummation of Italian  intelligence in many departments--the arrival at maturity of the  Christian trained mind tempered by the philosophy of Greece, and the  knowledge of the actual world. Fully aroused at last, the Italian  intellect became inquisitive, inventive, scientific, skeptical--yes,  treacherous, immoral, polluted. It questioned all things, doubted  where it pleased, saturated itself with crime, corruption, and  sensuality, yet bowed at the shrine of the beautiful and knelt at the  altar of Christianity. It is an illustration of the contradictions  that may exist when the intellectual, the religious, and the moral  are brought together, with the intellectual in predominance.    [Illustration: FIG. 38.--FRA BARTOLOMMEO. DESCENT FROM CROSS. PITTI.]    And that keen Renaissance intellect made swift progress. It remodelled  the philosophy of Greece, and used its literature as a mould for its  own. It developed Roman law and introduced modern science. The world  without and the world within were rediscovered. Land and sea, starry  sky and planetary system, were fixed upon the chart. Man himself, the  animals, the planets, organic and inorganic life, the small things of  the earth gave up their secrets. Inventions utilized all classes of  products, commerce flourished, free cities were builded, universities  arose, learning spread itself on the pages of newly invented books of  print, and, perhaps, greatest of all, the arts arose on strong wings  of life to the very highest altitude.    For the moral side of the Renaissance intellect it had its tastes and  refinements, as shown in its high quality of art; but it also had its  polluting and degrading features, as shown in its political and social  life. Religion was visibly weakening though the ecclesiastical still  held strong. People were forgetting the faith of the early days, and  taking up with the material things about them. They were glorifying  the human and exalting the natural. The story of Greece was being  repeated in Italy. And out of this new worship came jewels of rarity  and beauty, but out of it also came faithlessness, corruption, vice.    Strictly speaking, the Renaissance had been accomplished before the  year 1500, but so great was its impetus that, in the arts at least, it  extended half-way through the sixteenth century. Then it began to fail  through exhaustion.    MOTIVES AND METHODS: The religious subject still held with the  painters, but this subject in High-Renaissance days did not carry with  it the religious feeling as in Gothic days. Art had grown to be  something else than a teacher of the Bible. In the painter's hands it  had come to mean beauty for its own sake--a picture beautiful for its  form and color, regardless of its theme. This was the teaching of  antique art, and the study of nature but increased the belief. A new  love had arisen in the outer and visible world, and when the Church  called for altar-pieces the painters painted their new love,  christened it with a religious title, and handed it forth in the name  of the old. Thus art began to free itself from Church domination and  to live as an"]]]
