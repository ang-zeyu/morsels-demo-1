At length, in 1626, came Peter Minuit with an  ample commission from the all-powerful Company, who organized something  like a system of civil government comprehending all the settlements.  Evidences of prosperity and growing wealth began to multiply. But one is  impressed with the merely secular and commercial character of the  enterprise and with the tardy and feeble signs of religious life in the  colony. In 1626, when the settlement of Manhattan had grown to a village  of thirty houses and two hundred souls, there arrived two official  \"sick-visitors,\" who undertook some of the public duties of a pastor. On  Sundays, in the loft over the horse-mill, they would read from the  Scriptures and the creeds. And two years later, in 1628, the village,  numbering now about two hundred and seventy souls, gave a grateful  welcome to Jonas Michaelius, minister of the gospel. He rejoiced to  gather no less than fifty communicants at the first celebration of the  Lord's Supper, and to organize them into a church according to the  Reformed discipline. The two elders were the governor and the Company's  storekeeper, men of honest report who had served in like functions in  churches of the fatherland. The records of this period are scanty; the  very fact of this beginning of a church and the presence of a minister  in the colony had faded out of history until restored by the recent  discovery of a letter of the forgotten Michaelius.[69:1]    The sagacious men in control of the Dutch West India Company were quick  to recognize that weakness in their enterprise which in the splendid  colonial attempt of the French proved ultimately to be fatal. Their  settlements were almost exclusively devoted to the lucrative trade with  the Indians and were not taking root in the soil. With all its  advantages, the Dutch colony could not compete with New England.[70:1]  To meet this difficulty an expedient was adopted which was not long in  beginning to plague the inventors. A vast tract of territory, with  feudal rights and privileges, was offered to any man settling a colony  of fifty persons. The disputes which soon arose between these powerful  vassals and the sovereign Company had for one effect the recall of Peter  Minuit from his position of governor. Never again was the unlucky colony  to have so competent and worthy a head as this discarded elder of the  church. Nevertheless the scheme was not altogether a failure.    In 1633 arrived a new pastor, Everard Bogardus, in the same ship with a  schoolmaster--the first in the colony--and the new governor, Van  Twiller. The governor was incompetent and corrupt, and the minister was  faithful and plain-spoken; what could result but conflict? During Van  Twiller's five years of mismanagement, nevertheless, the church emerged  from the mill-loft and was installed in a barn-like meeting-house of  wood. During the equally wretched administration of Kieft, the governor,  listening to the reproaches of a guest, who quoted the example of New  England, where the people were wont to build a fine church as soon as  they had houses for themselves, was incited to build a stone church  within the fort. There seems to have been little else that he did for  the kingdom of heaven. Pastor Bogardus is entitled to the respect of  later ages for the chronic quarrel that he kept up with the worthless  representatives of the Company. At length his righteous rebuke of an  atrociously wicked massacre of neighboring Indians perpetrated by Kieft  brought matters to a head. The two antagonists sailed in the same ship,  in 1647, to lay their dispute before the authorities in Holland, the  Company and the classis. The case went to a higher court. The ship was  cast away and both the parties were drowned.    Meanwhile the patroon Van Rensselaer, on his great manor near Albany,  showed some sense of his duty to the souls of the people whom he had  brought out into the wilderness. He built a church and put into the  pastoral charge over his subjects one who, under his travestied name of  Megapolensis, has obtained a good report as a faithful minister of Jesus  Christ. It was he who saved Father Jogues, the Jesuit missionary, from  imminent torture and death among the Mohawks, and befriended him, and  saw him safely off for Europe. This is one honorable instance, out of  not a few, of personal respect and kindness shown to members of the  Roman clergy and the Jesuit society by men who held these organizations  in the severest reprobation. To his Jesuit brother he was drawn by a  peculiarly strong bond of fellowship, for the two were fellow-laborers  in the gospel to the red men. For Domine Megapolensis is claimed[71:1]  the high honor of being the first Protestant missionary to the Indians.    In 1647, to the joy of all the colonists, arrived a new governor, Peter  Stuyvesant, not too late to save from utter ruin the colony that had  suffered everything short of ruin from the incompetency and wickedness  of Kieft. About the time that immigration into New England ceased with  the triumph of the Puritan party in England, there began to be a  distinct current of population setting toward the Hudson River colony.  The West India Company had been among the first of the speculators in  American lands to discover that a system of narrow monopoly is not the  best nurse for a colony; too late to save itself from ultimate  bankruptcy, it removed some of the barriers of trade, and at once  population began to flow in from other colonies, Virginia and New  England. Besides those who were attracted by the great business  advantages of the Dutch colony, there came some from Massachusetts,  driven thence by the policy of exclusiveness in religious opinion  deliberately adopted there. Ordinances were set forth assuring to  several such companies \"liberty of conscience, according to the custom  and manner of Holland.\" Growing prosperously in numbers, the colony grew  in that cosmopolitan diversity of sects and races which went on  increasing with its years. As early as 1644 Father Jogues was told by  the governor that there were persons of eighteen different languages at  Manhattan, including Calvinists, Catholics, English Puritans, Lutherans,  Anabaptists (here called Mennonists), etc. No jealousy seems to have  arisen over this multiplication of sects until, in 1652, the Dutch  Lutherans, who had been attendants at the Dutch Reformed Church,  presented a respectful petition that they might be permitted to have  their own pastor and church. Denied by Governor Stuyvesant, the request  was presented to the Company and to the States-General. The two Reformed  pastors used the most strenuous endeavors through the classis of  Amsterdam to defeat the petition, under the fear that the concession of  this privilege would tend to the diminution of their congregation. This  resistance was successfully maintained until at last the petitioners  were able to obtain from the Roman Catholic Duke of York the religious  freedom which Dutch Calvinism had failed to give them.    Started thus in the wrong direction, it was easy for the colonial  government to go from bad to worse. At a time when the entire force of  Dutch clergy in the colony numbered only four, they were most  unapostolically zealous to prevent any good from being done by  \"unauthorized conventicles and the preaching of unqualified persons,\"  and procured the passing of an ordinance forbidding these under penalty  of fine and imprisonment. The mild remonstrances of the Company, which  was eager to get settlers without nice inquiries as to their religious  opinions, had little effect to restrain the enterprising orthodoxy of  Peter Stuyvesant. The activity of the Quakers among the Long Island  towns stirred him to new energy. Not only visiting missionaries, but  quiet dwellers at home, were subjected to severe and ignominious  punishments. The persecution was kept up until one of the banished  Friends, John Bowne, reached Amsterdam and laid the case before the  Company. This enlightened body promptly shortened the days of  tribulation by a letter to the superserviceable Stuyvesant, conceived in  a most commercial spirit. It suggested to him that it was doubtful  whether further persecution was expedient, unless it was desired to  check the growth of population, which at that stage of the enterprise  ought rather to be encouraged. No man, they said, ought to be molested  so long as he disturbed neither his neighbors nor the government. \"This  maxim has always been the guide of the magistrates of this city, and the  consequence has been that from every land people have flocked to this  asylum. Tread thus in their steps, and we doubt not you will be  blessed.\"    The stewardship of the interests of the kingdom of Christ in the New  Netherlands was about to be taken away from the Dutch West India  Company and the classis of Amsterdam. It will hardly be claimed by any  that the account of their stewardship was a glorious one. The supply of  ministers of the gospel had been tardy, inconstant, and scanty. At the  time when the Dutch ministers were most active in hindering the work of  others, there were only four of themselves in a vast territory with a  rapidly increasing population. The clearest sign of spiritual life in  the first generation of the colony is to be found in the righteous  quarrel of Domine Bogardus with the malignant Kieft, and the large  Christian brotherly kindness, the laborious mission work among the  Indians, and the long-sustained pastoral faithfulness of Domine  Megapolensis.    Doubtless there is a record in heaven of faithful living and serving of  many true disciples among this people, whose names are unknown on earth;  but in writing history it is only with earthly memorials that we have to  do.

CHAPTER V    THE CASTLE AND UNIVERSITY      No notice of Durham and its cathedral would seem complete without some  mention being made of its fortress, the growth of which has been  contemporary with, and, we might almost say, inseparable from that of  the monastery itself.    There can be little doubt that other than the miraculous considerations  assigned to them by tradition influenced the monks and the congregation  of S. Cuthbert in their final choice of a resting-place for the bones of  their beloved saint. The almost impregnable position of the rocky  promontory upon which both Cathedral and Castle stand suggests a careful  selection on their part, with a view to the prevention of attack and  consequent further disturbance of their sacred relics. What the first  fortification was is a matter of doubt; most probably it was merely a  wall or rampart of earth, with a large artificial mound at the weakest  point. This seems to have been the usual practice at an early date at  many other places in England, and in some cases their date is known and  corresponds to the time at which Durham was probably first fortified.  Whatever the earliest protections were, we know that in 1072 William the  Conqueror, on his way from Scotland, passed through Durham. He quickly  perceived the natural advantages and strength of the position, and gave  orders for the erection of a castle. This was at once set about, during  the episcopacy of Bishop Walcher, and continued under Carileph and  Flambard. Of this building, which might be styled \"The Conqueror's  Castle,\" not much remains. The most important is the #Chapel# or  Crypt, which belongs, no doubt, to the earlier part of the period named  (1080 to 1096). In plan the chapel has a nave and two aisles. The roof  is vaulted, the ribs being plain, semi-circular, and square recessed,  and is supported by six circular columns. The capitals of these columns  are a somewhat interesting feature, owing to their Lombardic character.  The abaci are square and moulded, while the caps proper carry at their  angles rudely carved volutes such as occur in the White Tower, London.  Each capital is also carved differently with curious and rude devices.  Of the three windows which terminated the nave and aisle at the east  end, one has been destroyed to make way for a staircase and the other  two are built up. The original windows of the chapel were very narrow  and widely splayed. In the walls are an aumbrey and the remains of two  altars.    [Illustration: The Chapel or Crypt, Durham Castle.]    Other remains of this date are somewhat scattered. Two windows in the  undercroft of Bishop Bek's, or what is now known as #Bishop Hatfield's  Hall#, are examples. They have converging jambs, the semi-circular  heads being cut from one stone and the inside very widely splayed. The  wall from the keep to the chapel, and that from the keep to the gateway  are also Norman work, as are also portions of the gateway itself.    The next important changes in the castle were made by Bishop Pudsey,  1153-1195, who not only repaired the existing work but built a hall,  known as #Pudsey's Hall#. Although this hall has now almost entirely  disappeared, through repairs and alterations, sufficient evidence as to  its whereabouts and general plan is forthcoming. It was of two storeys,  the lower and upper halls. Entrance to the lower hall was originally  gained by a staircase which led from the courtyard to the splendid  doorway now enclosed in Tunstall's Gallery. This magnificent entrance  having been covered with lath and plaster, and for long completely  forgotten, was unearthed by, and at the expense of Bishop Barrington,  early in the present century. It is in good preservation and is a  splendid specimen of rich Norman architecture. It consists of five  orders, all richly carved and moulded. Three orders rest on carved  capitals and shafts, and two are carried down the jambs of the doorway.  The stairway has entirely disappeared, but there is little room to doubt  that it would be of much the same character as that in the close at  Canterbury; and to the protection afforded by the staircase roof, we  are, no doubt, indebted for the good preservation of the arch mouldings  of the doorway itself.    What was originally Pudsey's Upper Hall is now styled the #Norman  Gallery#. The greater portion of this gallery is at the present time  divided into chambers of residence for the students of the university.  It is reached by the Black Staircase and a doorway in the Early English  Gothic style. The interior of the south and west walls are enriched by  arcades in groups of three, the central bay of each of which is larger  than those flanking it, and is pierced by a window. The arches of the  arcade rest on shafts and cushion capitals, and are carved with chevron  ornament. The whole arrangement hereabouts bears the impress of having  been a portion of one great building, which an examination of the roof,  lead, and general outline makes even more certain.    On the western side of the courtyard stands the great #Bek's Hall#,  built by the bishop of that name. It is above the Norman undercroft,  previously mentioned. Much of its original character is now lost, owing  to restorations, curtailments, and alterations. Bek's doorway is still  in existence, though much hidden by the porch erected later by Bishop  Cosin. It has a pointed arch of two orders, with detached shafts in the  jambs. Another original relic, unrestored, is part of the window nearest  the fireplace, which is valuable as evidence of the date of the erection  of the hall. The tracery is geometrical, and the shafts in the angles of  the splays are banded. About the year 1350 Bishop Hatfield enlarged and  altered Bek's hall. At the west end he inserted two light windows, which  are now blocked, though the tracery may be seen from students' rooms  inside, and partly from the outside. The open oak roof, with the  exception of some necessary later repairs, is of Bishop Hatfield's time.  Hatfield repaired and altered Pudsey's upper hall by the addition of  east and west windows, and probably a new roof. He also rebuilt the  #Keep#, which time and war had greatly injured. The existing keep,  which was"]]]
