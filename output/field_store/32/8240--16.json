CHAPTER VII      The comtesse and the duc d'Aiguillon--M. de Soubise--Louis XV and the  duc d'Aiguillon--Letter from the comtesse to the king--Answer of  the king-The \"_Nouvelles a la Main_\"--The comtesse and Louis XV--The  supper--The court ladies mystified--The comtesse and M. de Sartines    I was still triumphing at the skill which I had displayed in my  conference with the prince de Soubise when the duc d'Aiguillon entered.    \"Good heaven,\" said he, kissing my hand very tenderly, \"into what  inquietude did you throw me by your dear and cruel letter. The ambiguity  of your style has caused me inexpressible sorrow; and you have added to  it by not allowing me to come to you at the first moment.\"    \"I could not: I thought it would be dangerous for you to appear before  the king previously to having seen me.\"    \"Would the king have thought my visit strange?\" asked the duke, not  without some emotion.    \"That is not the point. The black spite of my enemies has not yet  deprived me of the counsels of a friend. But as it is necessary to speak  to the king in my favor, I wish that he should not know that you do so  at my request.\"    After this I related to the duke my conversation with the king.    \"Your situation is delicate,\" said he to me, \"but it should not trouble  you. The king is weak, we must give him courage. It is his pliancy of  disposition rather than his resistance that we must contend with, and I  go to act upon it.\"    I then instructed the duke with what had passed between me and the  prince de Soubise. When I had done, the duke replied:    \"Expect nothing from the prince de Soubise: he will speak, no doubt; but  how? In a jesting, laughing way. If, however, you think he can at all  serve you, give him all your confidence.\"    \"No, no, never,\" I replied with quickness; \"it is not a thing to be done  lightly; we do not select a confidant, counsellor, or friend, at random.  Do you not know this, M. le duc? It is requisite that the heart of  the one who speaks should repose itself on the heart of the friend who  listens. I repeat to you that I have no feeling of confidence towards  M. de Soubise. In fact,\" I added with visible and troubled emotion, \"my  choice is made, and you have too much heroism to wish to combat it.\"    At these flattering words the duke precipitated himself at my feet, and  swore to support my cause with all his power and interest. I replied  that I fully relied on his devotion and prudence. Comte Jean entered,  and it was agreed between us three that I should say no more to the king  of my presentation before the duc d'Aiguillon had spoken to him of it;  that I should content myself with complaining without peevishness, and  that we should leave the opening measure to the prince de Soubise, and  let him break the ice to his majesty.    The prince de Soubise behaved exactly as the duke had told me: he came  to me the next morning with a mysterious air, which already informed  me of all he had to say. He said that he had vainly tormented the king;  that his majesty wished things to remain just as they were, and desired  that until a new order of things nothing should be altered.    \"I am sorry for it, monsieur le marechal,\" I replied. \"Whilst I am in  this precarious situation, whilst I remain in a corner of the stage as a  confidante of tragedy, I can do nothing for my friends, particularly for  you, monsieur le marechal.\"    \"On the contrary, madame,\" he replied, \"the king will be more disposed  to listen to you whilst he will suppose that your influence is unknown.\"    \"Oh,\" cried I with a feeling of anger, \"you gentlemen courtiers think  of nothing but politics. As for me, who am a woman, I have other matters  for consideration: I must have honors, title, rank. My self-love suffers  cruelly when I see myself immolated by the fear which the ladies de  Grammont and three or four other intriguers of their party are able to  excite.\"    The prince was somewhat startled at the freedom of language which I  used towards ladies in such credit at court: he begged me to moderate my  feelings, and be less moved and excited. By this the prince de Soubise  lost the esteem which I might have accorded him, and the second place in  my counsels, which I might have given him.    I told the duke, who came to see me the moment afterwards, of the  failure of the prince's attempt. He told me that he had not hoped for  a better result. He went to the king, flattering himself with hopes of  better success, but did not find him.    The daughters of Louis XV had united against me with a fury which  nothing could justify. They were incessantly talking scandal of my past  life, as if there were only saints at court, as if they had no pranks  of their own to reproach themselves with. All the chateau knew of their  lovers, and there was _living_ evidence of the tenderness of madame  Adelaide: as for madame Louise she was an angel upon earth, and was the  only one who did not join in the cry against me. On the other hand, the  king, whilst he had but little love for his dear daughters, preserved  towards them a complaisance and external appearance of kindness which  was a substitute for parental love. When _mesdames royales_ cried out,  he stopped his ears with his two hands, and seemed, whilst looking  proudly at France, to say, \"Am not I a good father, and are not my  daughters very happy, for I let them cry out with all their might?\"    The next day the duc d'Aiguillon went again to the king, and found him  bewildered with family scenes and the murmurings of the Choiseuls. When  my ambassador had delivered his message, the king asked him if he, as  well as the prince de Soubise, had been set upon his haunches by me.    The duke, nothing intimidated at this, told the king that far from  having wished that he should be my interpreter, I had requested him not  to allude to the matter.    \"Why, then,\" said Louis XV laughing, \"do you not follow the advice of  the comtesse?\"    \"Because I entertain a sincere attachment for her, and that I am vexed  to hear it said that there are persons who lead your majesty.\"    \"Who are the insolents that hold such language?\"    \"They surround you, sire. There is not a female here but affirms that  you dare not decide on the presentation of the comtesse.\"    \"I alone am master, and will let them know it when the opportunity  arrives; but the present moment is not fitting. The comtesse knows how  well I love her; and if she will prove her friendship towards me, she  will remain quiet for some time.\"    The duke thought it best to be silent, and came to me. After relating  the conversation, he added, \"Do not appear at all dejected; the king  would not then visit you lest he should find you out of temper. Were I  you I should write to him; a word of peace would set him at ease.\"    I approved this advice, and instantly penned the following letter:--    \"Sire--They tell me that your majesty has been tormented on my account.  It is a treason of which I alone could believe myself capable. But why  should I complain? You have done so much for me that I ought to  esteem myself happy: your august friendship consoles me thro' all my  annoyances. Be assured that henceforth I shall pout no more; I will be  the best sheep in the world, relying on my shepherd for not having my  fleece cut too closely; for after all I think I am the petted ewe, etc.\"    A short time afterwards a page brought me a splendid box of _bonbons_  with a pair of ruby ear-rings surrounded with diamonds, and this short  billet:--    \"Yes, assuredly you are my pet ewe, and always shall be. The shepherd  has a strong crook with which he will drive away those who would injure  you. Rely on your shepherd for the care of your tranquillity, and the  peace of your future life.\"    In the evening the king visited me. He was embarrassed, but I set him at  ease by showing him a laughing countenance, talking only of his present,  which I had in my ears, and shaking my head about to keep the drops in  motion, which sparkled with great brilliancy. He was pleased at this,  and did not leave me all the evening. In the morning we were the best  friends in the world.    Some days elapsed, when comte Jean came to me, bringing two infamous  articles which had appeared in the \"_Nouvelles a la Main_,\" and were  directed against me. They were atrocious and deeply chagrined me: I  placed them on the mantel-piece, where all who came in could see them.  The duc de Duras read them, and said, \"Conceal these atrocities from the  king.\"    \"No,\" was my reply, \"I wish him to read them, that he may know how his  affections are respected, and how the police of Paris are employed in  doing their duty to the throne.\"    These last words annoyed M. de Duras, between whom and M. de Sartines  there was a connection: the duke was indebted to the lieutenant-general  of police for the special surveillance which he kept over a young girl  of whom he, the duc de Duras, was foolishly enamoured. Trembling for  his _dear friend_ M. de Sartines, he wrote to him in haste, but had not  courage or talent enough to undertake the defence of the guilty person.    The king came as usual; his general station was at the chimney-piece,  where he amused himself with looking at the baubles that ornamented it.  The \"_Nouvelles a la Main_\" fell in his way. He read them once, then  again; then, without uttering a word, threw them into the fire. I  observed him, and saw that he was full of emotion which he sought to  conceal, but the anger burst forth soon. The prince de Soubise, who  supped with us that evening, asked the duc de Duras if he had read the  \"_Gazette de France._\"    \"No,\" was the reply; \"I seldom read such nonsense.\"    \"And you are quite right,\" said the king. \"There is at present a most  inconceivable mania for writing. What is the use, I ask you, gentlemen,  of this deluge of books and pamphlets with which France is inundated?  They only"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20839"],[0,"The Mountain Chant, A Navajo Ceremony (#15)"],[1,"od--the form second from the north--threw into  it some powdered substance to make a cold decoction, and laid the  sprinkler on top of it. (Paragraph 106.)    113. The whistle was blown. The herald announced that all was ready. The  sick woman and her companion entered, and one after the other cast meal  upon the floor. The former took off her moccasins and sat on the ground  near the door while a song was sung. Then she sat on the form of the  white god, her companion sat on the form of the blue god, and the  singing and rattling were resumed. Without interrupting his song the  chanter sprinkled the picture with the infusion, applied the moistened  sprinkler to the breast, head, and brow of each of the gods in the  following order: white, blue, yellow, black, and sat down to finish his  chant. He administered the decoctions to his patient in two draughts, to  her companion in two draughts, to himself (honest physician!) in the  same manner, and gave as before (paragraph 106) the dregs to the  bystanders. He applied the dust from different parts of the divine  figures to the sick woman, in much the same manner as on the previous  day, and while doing this he obliterated the pictures of the little  animals over the head of the white god. The fumigation of both women was  repeated with exactly the same rites as on the second day, and the fumes  had precisely the same odor on this occasion as on that. When the coals  were extinguished and taken out, the chanter said to the women, \"kaÃ§\"  (now), whereat they arose and left the lodge.    114. As soon as they were gone the work of obliteration began. The  figures of the gods were rubbed out in the usual order (white, blue,  yellow, black, rainbow), the erasure in each case proceeding from foot  to head. The plumed wands fell as before, simultaneously with the  destruction of the rainbow. The sand was carried out at half past  2 o'clock and no further rites were performed during the day.      115. EIGHTH DAY. The picture painted on Monday (October 27) was of a  simple character, and hence did not occupy much time. The work was begun  at 7 a.m. and was finished at 10 a.m. Of the four shorter or interior  arrows (Plate XVIII), that which stands second from the north was  regarded as the arrow of the east and was begun first. On this arrow the  sick woman was placed, sitting with her face to the east, when she came  to be treated and fumigated. The bowl of infusion was laid on the point  of the arrow immediately to her left, regarded as the arrow of the  north. The medicine man put the pollen on the base, on the red cross  lines near the center, and on the white tips. All the ceremonies which  took place between the completion and the obliteration of the picture  (the planting of the five plumed wands, the sprinkling of the picture  with meal, the sprinkling and administration of the infusion, the  application of the colored dust to the person of the patient, the  fumigation of the two women, the whistling, the singing, and rattling)  were essentially the same as those observed on the previous day. In  taking the dust from the picture, however, the shaman applied his hands  only to the bases of the arrows. The ceremony of obliteration was also a  repetition of the rites of the previous day.      [Illustration: FIG. 53. The great wood pile.]    116. The building of the great stack of wood (Fig. 53) which was to  furnish the fire in the center of the corral on the last night went on  simultaneously with the painting of the picture. Both tasks were begun  and ended about the same time. The wood in the big pile was dead, long  seasoned juniper and cedar, fuel of the most inflammable character. The  pile was about twelve feet high and sixty paces in circumference. Large  quantities of this dry wood were also brought and placed outside the  space allotted to the corral, to replenish the fires when needed.    117. In the afternoon there were no ceremonies in the medicine lodge.  The qaÃ§Ã li and his assistants took a half holiday, and not without  deserving it, for they had wrought well for three days and they had a  long day's work and a long night's work still before them. A large  number of people had by this time assembled, and from time to time more  arrived. Throughout the sparse grove which surrounded us, little  temporary corrals and huts of boughs were going up in every direction.  In more secret spots in the rugged walls of a caÃ±on, about half a mile  from the medicine lodge, other shelters were erected, where visiting  performers were to prepare themselves on the last night. Many young men  were busy in the afternoon cutting down the trees and lopping off the  branches which were to form the great corral (the ilnÃ¡sjin, the dark  circle of branches) on the next day. Some of the visiting women were  busy grinding meal and attending to different household duties; others  played cards or engaged in the more aboriginal pastime of Ã¡zÂ¢ilÃ§il,  a game played with three sticks and forty stones, the latter for  counters.    118. The friends of the sick woman prepared the alkÃ n, a great corn cake  baked in the earth, the manufacture of which gave evidence of the  antiquity of the process. The batter was mixed in one large hole in the  ground lined with fresh sheepskin. It was baked in another hole in which  a fire had been burning for many hours, until the surrounding earth was  well heated. The fire was removed; the hole lined with corn husks; the  batter ladled in and covered with more cornhusks; hot earth and hot  coals were spread overall. The cake was not dug up until the following  day, and was designed chiefly for the special entertainment of those who  were at work in the medicine lodge.      119. NINTH DAY (UNTIL SUNSET). On Tuesday (October 28) the work in the  lodge consisted in preparing certain properties to be used in the  ceremonies of the night. These were the wands to be used in the first  dance, the kÃ¡tso-yisÃ§Ã n or great plumed arrows, and the trees which the  dancers pretended to swallow.    120. The wand of the nahikÃ Ã¯ was made by paring down a straight slender  stick of aromatic sumac, about three feet long, to the general thickness  of less than half an inch, but leaving a head or button at one end.  A ring was fashioned from a transverse slice of some hollow or pithy  plant, so that it would slide freely up and down the slender wand, but  would nob pass over the head. Eagle down was secured to the wooden head  and also to the ring. In the dance (paragraph 129) the eagle down on the  stick is burned off in the fire while the ring is held in the palm of  the hand. When the time comes for the wand to grow white again, as the  name nahikÃ Ã¯ expresses it, the ring is allowed to leave the palm and  slide to the other end of the stick.    121. The great plumed arrows were deceptions somewhat similar in  character to the wands. One-half of the arrow was made of a slender hard  twig of cliff rose; the other half was formed of some pithy suffruticose  herb which I could not determine satisfactorily, as I saw only the cut  sections and was not permitted to handle these. The pith was removed so  as to allow the wooden part to move into the herby part with a  telescopic mechanism. The herbaceous portion was so covered with  feathers that nothing could be seen of its surface. A large stone  arrowhead was attached to the wooden shaft. When the actor pretended to  swallow this he merely held the stone point firmly between his teeth and  forced the upper or plumed shaft down on the lower or wooden shaft. It  was an excellent deception, and presented to the ordinary observer all  the appearance of genuine arrow swallowing.    122. The piÃ±on saplings, which the dancers also pretended to swallow,  had no deceptive arrangement. They were slender little trees trimmed at  the butt into a broad, thin, wedge shaped point, which was carefully  smoothed by rubbing it with sandstone, so that no offensive splinters  should present themselves to the lips of the dancers. The smooth end was  painted red, probably to make the spectators, at night, by the uncertain  firelight, suppose that the dissemblers had torn their throats in their  great efforts. Sometimes the saplings have all their branches removed,  and are then trimmed with cross pieces and circles of evergreen sprays.  In most cases, however, I have seen the sapling used in its natural  condition.    123. As each set of implements was completed there was a ceremony with  singing and rattling, the men who were to use them at night partook of  powdered medicines on their extended tongues, from the hands of the  chanter, and then practiced themselves in the use of the implements.  Although they well knew the deceptive nature of these articles and fully  understood the frauds they were preparing to perpetrate on the public,  these young men seemed to view the whole work with high reverence and  treat it with the greatest seriousness. For instance, when, in the  secrecy of the lodge, they went through the motions of swallowing the  trees they showed indubitable signs of fear: all looked anxious, some  trembled quite perceptibly, and one looked as pale as a live Indian can  look. They probably dreaded the displeasure of the gods if all were not  done well.      124. LAST NIGHT. Just after sunset the old chanter posted himself some  paces to the east of the great woodpile, on the spot where the gate of  the corral was to be, and began a song. Simultaneous with the beginning  of the song was the commencement of the building of the dark circle. All  the young and middleaged men in camp assisted. They dragged the branches  from where they had been cut down in the neighboring woods and put them  in position in the circle with great celerity. The work was all done in  less than an hour, during which time the chanter ceased not for an  instant his song and rattle. When the fence was finished to his  satisfaction he stopped"]]]
