The whole had no connexion with myself, I sought for  nothing around me; I was them, I saw only the objects which existed for  them; it was a dream, without being awakened.\"--Metastasio describes a  similar situation. \"When I apply with a little attention, the nerves of  my sensorium are put into a violent tumult. I grow as red in the face as  a drunkard, and am obliged to quit my work.\" When Malebranche first took  up Descartes on Man, the germ and origin of his philosophy, he was  obliged frequently to interrupt his reading by a violent palpitation of  the heart. When the first idea of the Essay on the Arts and Sciences  rushed on the mind of Rousseau, it occasioned such a feverish agitation  that it approached to a delirium.    This delicious inebriation of the imagination occasioned the ancients,  who sometimes perceived the effects, to believe it was not short of  divine inspiration. Fielding says, \"I do not doubt but that the most  pathetic and affecting scenes have been writ with tears.\" He perhaps  would have been pleased to have confirmed his observation by the  following circumstances. The tremors of Dryden, after having written an  Ode, a circumstance tradition has accidentally handed down, were not  unusual with him; in the preface to his Tales he tells us, that in  translating Homer he found greater pleasure than in Virgil; but it was  not a pleasure without pain; the _continual agitation of the spirits_  must needs be a weakener to any constitution, especially in age, and  many pauses are required for refreshment betwixt the heats. In writing  the ninth scene of the second act of the Olimpiade, Metastasio found  himself in tears; an effect which afterwards, says Dr. Burney, proved  very contagious. It was on this occasion that that tender poet  commemorated the circumstance in the following interesting sonnet:--                             SONNET FROM METASTASIO.       \"_Scrivendo l'Autore in Vienna l'anno 1733 la sua Olimpiade si       senti commosa fino alle lagrime nell' esprimere la divisione di       due teneri amici: e meravigliandosi che un falso, e da lui       inventato disastro, potesse cagionargli una si vera passione,       si fece a riflettere quanto poco ragionevole e solido       fondamento possano aver le altre che soglion frequentamente       agitarci, nel corso di nostra vita_.        Sogni e favole io fingo, e pure in carte      Mentre favole, e sogni, orno e disegno,      In lor, (folle ch' io son!) prendo tal parte      Che del mal che inventai piango, e mi sdegno.      Ma forse allor che non m' inganna l'arte,      Piu saggio io sono e l'agitato ingegno      Forse allo piu tranquillo? O forse parte      Da piu salda cagion l'amor, lo sdegno?      Ah che non sol quelle, ch'io canto, o scrivo      Favole son; ma quanto temo, o spero,      Tutt' e manzogna, e delirando io vivo!      Sogno della mia vita e il corso intero.      Deh tu, Signor, quando a destarmi arrivo      Fa, ch'io trovi riposo in sen del VERO.         _In 1733, the Author, composing his Olimpiade, felt himself       suddenly moved, even to tears, in expressing the separation of       two tender lovers. Surprised that a fictitious grief, invented       too by himself, could raise so true a passion, he reflected how       little reasonable and solid a foundation the others had, which,       so frequently agitated us in this state of our existence._                        SONNET--IMITATED.        Fables and dreams I feign; yet though but verse        The dreams and fables that adorn this scroll,      Fond fool! I rave, and grieve as I rehearse;        While GENUINE TEARS for FANCIED SORROWS roll.      Perhaps the dear delusion of my heart        Is wisdom; and the agitated mind,      As still responding to each plaintive part,      With love and rage, a tranquil hour can find.      Ah! not alone the tender RHYMES I give        Are fictions: but my FEARS and HOPES I deem      Are FABLES all; deliriously I live,        And life's whole course is one protracted dream.      Eternal Power! when shall I wake to rest        This wearied brain on TRUTH'S immortal breast?          RICHARDSON.      The censure which the Shakspeare of novelists has incurred for the  tedious procrastination and the minute details of his fable; his slow  unfolding characters, and the slightest gestures of his personages, is  extremely unjust; for is it not evident that we could not have his  peculiar excellences without these accompanying defects? When characters  are fully delineated, the narrative must be suspended. Whenever the  narrative is rapid, which so much delights superficial readers, the  characters cannot be very minutely featured; and the writer who aims to  instruct (as Richardson avowedly did) by the glow and eloquence of his  feelings, must often sacrifice to this his local descriptions.  Richardson himself has given us the principle that guided him in  composing. He tells us, \"If I give speeches and conversations, I ought  to give them justly; for the _humours_ and _characters_ of persons  cannot be known unless I _repeat_ what they say, and their _manner_ of  saying.\"    Foreign critics have been more just to Richardson than many of his own  countrymen. I shall notice the opinions of three celebrated writers,  D'Alembert, Rousseau, and Diderot.    D'Alembert was a great mathematician. His literary taste was extremely  cold: he was not worthy of reading Richardson. The volumes, if he ever  read them, must have fallen from his hands. The delicate and subtle  turnings, those folds of the human heart, which require so nice a touch,  was a problem which the mathematician could never solve. There is no  other demonstration in the human heart, but an appeal to its feelings:  and what are the calculating feelings of an arithmetician of lines and  curves? He therefore declared of Richardson that \"La Nature est bonne A  imiter, mais non pas jusqu'a l'ennui.\"    But thus it was not with the other two congenial geniuses! The fervent  opinion of Rousseau must be familiar to the reader; but Diderot, in his  eloge on Richardson, exceeds even Rousseau in the enthusiasm of his  feelings. I extract some of the most interesting passages. Of Clarissa  he says, \"I yet remember with delight the first time it came into my  hands. I was in the country. How deliciously was I affected! At every  moment I saw my happiness abridged by a page. I then experienced the  same sensations those feel who have long lived with one they love, and  are on the point of separation. At the close of the work I seemed to  remain deserted.\"    The impassioned Diderot then breaks forth:--\"Oh, Richardson! thou  singular genius in my eyes! thou shalt form my reading in all times. If  forced by sharp necessity, my friend falls into indigence; if the  mediocrity of my fortune is not sufficient to bestow on my children the  necessary cares for their education, I will sell my books,--but thou  shalt remain! yes, thou shalt rest in the _same class_ with MOSES,  HOMER, EURIPIDES, and SOPHOCLES, to be read alternately.    \"Oh Richardson, I dare pronounce that the most veritable history is full  of fictions, and thy romances are full of truths. History paints some  individuals; thou paintest the human species. History attributes to some  individuals what they have neither said nor done; all that thou  attributest to man he has said and done. History embraces but a portion  of duration, a point on the surface of the globe; thou hast embraced all  places and all times. The human heart, which has ever been and ever  shall be the same, is the model which thou copiest. If we were severely  to criticise the best historian, would he maintain his ground as thou?  In this point of view, I venture to say, that frequently history is a  miserable romance; and romance, as thou hast composed it, is a good  history. Painter of nature, thou never liest!    \"I have never yet met with a person who shared my enthusiasm, that I was  not tempted to embrace, and to press him in my arms!    \"Richardson is no more! His loss touches me, as if my brother was no  more. I bore him in my heart without having seen him, and knowing him  but by his works. He has not had all the reputation he merited.  Richardson! if living thy merit has been disputed; how great wilt thou  appear to our children's children, when we shall view thee at the  distance we now view Homer! Then who will dare to steal a line from thy  sublime works! Thou hast had more admirers amongst us than in thine own  country, and at this I rejoice!\"    It is probable that to a Frenchman the _style_ of Richardson is not so  objectionable when translated, as to ourselves. I think myself that it  is very idiomatic and energetic; others have thought differently. The  misfortune of Richardson was, that he was unskilful in the art of  writing, and that he could never lay the pen down while his inkhorn  supplied it.    He was delighted by his own works. No author enjoyed so much the bliss  of excessive fondness. I heard from the late Charlotte Lenox the  anecdote which so severely reprimanded his innocent vanity, which  Boswell has recorded. This lady was a regular visitor at Richardson's  house, and she could scarcely recollect one visit which was not taxed by  our author reading one of his voluminous letters, or two or three, if  his auditor was quiet and friendly.    The extreme delight which he felt on a review of his own works the works  themselves witness. Each is an evidence of what some will deem a violent  literary vanity. To _Pamela_ is prefixed a _letter_ from the _editor_  (whom we know to be the _author_), consisting of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16351"],[0,"Critical and Historical Essays (#15)"],[1,"Dorian mode, were called _disjunct_,  the two outer ones which overlap the middle ones were called  _conjunct_ or _synemmenon_ tetrachords.    If we consider this new scale from octave to octave, commencing  with the lowest note, that is to say from B to B, we find that  it coincides exactly with the Mixolydian mode; therefore this  was called the Mixolydian octave. The octave in this scale  from the second note, C to C, coincides exactly with the Lydian  mode, and was called the Lydian octave; from the third note, D,  up to its octave gives the Phrygian; from the fourth note, E,  the Dorian; from the fifth, F, the Hypolydian; from the sixth,  G, the Hypophrygian; and from the seventh, A, the Aeolian  or Hypodorian octave. Add one note to the lower end of this  universal Greek scale, as it was called, and we see that the  whole tonal system was included within two octaves. To each of  the notes comprising it was given a name partly derived from  its position in the tetrachords, and partly from the fingering  employed in lyre playing, as shown in the diagram on page 87.    The fifteen strings of the _kithara_ were tuned according to  this scale, and the A, recurring three times in it, acquired  something of the importance of a tonic or key note. As yet,  however, this scale allowed of no transposition of a mode to  another pitch; in order to accomplish this the second tetrachord  was used as the first of another similar system. Thus,  considering the second tetrachord, E F G A, as first of the  new scale, it would be followed by A B[flat] C D, and the  two disjunct tetrachords would be formed. Followed by the two  upper conjunct tetrachords, and the _proslambanomenos_ added,  our system on a new pitch would be complete. This procedure  has come down almost unchanged to our times; for we have but  two modes, major and minor, which are used on every pitch,  constituting various keys. These Greek modes are the basis  on which all our modern ideas of tonality rest; for our major  mode is simply the Greek Lydian, and our minor mode the Aeolian.

To go into detailed explanation of the Greek enharmonic  and chromatic pitch will scarcely be worth while, and I will  therefore merely add that the instruments were sometimes tuned  differently, either to relieve the inevitable monotony of this  purely diatonic scale or for purposes of modulation. A Dorian  tetrachord is composed of semitone, tone, tone; to make it  chromatic, it was changed as follows: [G: e' f' g-' a'] the  _lichanos_, or index finger string, being lowered a semitone.    The enharmonic pitch consisted of tuning the _lichanos_ down  still further, almost a quarter-tone below the second string,  or _parhypate_, thus making the tetrachord run quarter-tone,  quarter-tone, two tones. Besides this, even in the diatonic,  the Greeks used what they called soft intervals; for example,  when the tetrachord, instead of proceeding by semitone, tone,  tone (which system was called the hard diatonic), was tuned  to semitone, three-quarter-tone, and tone and a quarter. The  chromatic pitch also had several forms, necessitating the use  of small fractional tones as well as semitones.    Our knowledge of the musical notation of the Greeks rests  entirely on the authority of Alypius, and dates from about the  fourth century A.D. That we could not be absolutely sure of  the readings of ancient Greek melodies, even if we possessed  any, is evident from the fact that these note characters,  which at first were derived from the signs of the zodiac,  and later from the letters of the alphabet, indicate only the  relative pitch of the sounds; the rhythm is left entirely to  the metrical value of the words in the lines to be sung. Two  sets of signs were used for musical notation, the vocal system  consisting of writing the letters of the alphabet in different  positions, upside down, sideways, etc.    Of the instrumental system but little is known, and that  not trustworthy.      [05] The fundamental doctrine of the Pythagorean philosophy       was that the essence of all things rests upon musical       relations, that numbers are the principle of all that       exists, and that the world subsists by the rhythmical       order of its elements. The doctrine of the \"Harmony of       the spheres\" was based on the idea that the celestial       spheres were separated from each other by intervals       corresponding with the relative length of strings       arranged so as to produce harmonious tones.    [06] Dionysus, the same as the Roman Bacchus.          VII    THE MUSIC OF THE ROMANS--THE EARLY CHURCH      The art history of the world makes it clear to us that when  the art of a country turns to over-elaboration of detail  and mechanical dexterity, when there is a general tendency  toward vividness of _impression_ rather than poignancy and  vitality of _expression_, then we have the invariable sign  of that decadence which inevitably drifts into revolution  of one kind or another. Lasus (500 B.C.), who, as previously  mentioned, was a great flute and lyre player as well as poet,  betrays this tendency, which reached its culmination under the  Romans. Lasus was more of a virtuoso than a poet; he introduced  into Greece a new and florid style of lyre and harp playing;  and it was he who, disliking the guttural Dorian pronunciation  of the letter S, wrote many of his choric poems without using  this letter once in them. Pindar, his pupil, followed in his  footsteps. In many of his odes we find intricate metrical  devices; for instance, the first line of most of the odes  is so arranged metrically that the same order of accents is  maintained whether the line be read backward or forward, the  short and long syllables falling into exactly the same places in  either case. The line \"Hercules, the patron deity of Thebes,\"  may be taken as an example, [(- ' ' ' - )'( - ' ' ' -)]. Such  devices occur all through his poems. We find in them also that  magnificence of diction which is the forerunner of \"virtuosity\";  for he speaks of his song as \"a temple with pillars of gold,  gold that glitters like blazing fire in the night time.\"    In the hands of Aristophanes (450-380 B.C.), the technique  of poetry continued to advance. In \"The Frogs,\" \"The  Wasps,\" and \"The Birds\" are to be found marvels of skill in  onomatopoetic[07] verse. His comedies called for many more  actors than the tragedies had required, and the chorus was  increased from fifteen to twenty-four. Purple skins were  spread across the stage, and the _parabasis_ (or topical song)  and satire vied with the noble lines of Aeschylus and Sophocles  for favour with the public.    Meanwhile, as might have been expected, instrumental music  became more and more independent, and musicians, especially  the flute players, prospered; for we read in Suidas that they  were much more proficient and sought after than the lyre and  kithara players. When they played, they stood in a conspicuous  place in the centre of the audience. Dressed in long, feminine,  saffron-coloured robes, with veiled faces, and straps round  their cheeks to support the muscles of the mouth, they exhibited  the most startling feats of technical skill. Even women became  flute players, although this was considered disgraceful.  The Athenians even went so far that they built a temple to the  flute player Lamia, and worshipped her as Venus. The prices  paid to these flute players surpassed even those given to  virtuosi in modern times, sometimes amounting to more than  one thousand dollars a day, and the luxury in which they lived  became proverbial.    During this period, Aristophanes of Alexandria (350 B.C.),  called \"the grammarian,\" devised a means for indicating the  inflection of the voice in speaking, by which the cadences  which orators found necessary in impassioned speech could be  classified, at least to some extent. When the voice was to fall,  a downward stroke [\\] was placed above the syllable; when the  voice was to be raised, an upward stroke [/] indicated it;  and when the voice was to rise and fall, the sign was [/\\],  which has become our accent in music. These three signs are  found in the French language, in the accent _aigu_, or high  accent, as in _passe_; the accent _grave_, or low accent,  as in _sincere_; or _circonflexe_, as in _Phaon_. The use of  dots[08] for punctuation is also ascribed to Aristophanes;  and our dots in musical notation, as well as the use of commas  to indicate breathings, may be traced to this system.    As I have said, all this tended toward technical skill and  analysis; what was lacking in inventive power it was sought  to cover by wonderful execution. The mania for flute playing,  for instance, seemed to spread all over the world; later we  even hear that the king of Egypt, Ptolemy"]]]
