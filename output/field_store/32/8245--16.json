When I said to myself: \"THEY have the manners to be silent, and  you, trusted as you are, the baseness to speak!\" I felt myself crimson  and I covered my face with my hands. After these secret scenes I  chattered more than ever, going on volubly enough till one of our  prodigious, palpable hushes occurred--I can call them nothing else--the  strange, dizzy lift or swim (I try for terms!) into a stillness, a pause  of all life, that had nothing to do with the more or less noise that at  the moment we might be engaged in making and that I could hear through  any deepened exhilaration or quickened recitation or louder strum of the  piano. Then it was that the others, the outsiders, were there. Though  they were not angels, they \"passed,\" as the French say, causing me,  while they stayed, to tremble with the fear of their addressing to their  younger victims some yet more infernal message or more vivid image than  they had thought good enough for myself.    What it was most impossible to get rid of was the cruel idea that,  whatever I had seen, Miles and Flora saw MORE--things terrible and  unguessable and that sprang from dreadful passages of intercourse in the  past. Such things naturally left on the surface, for the time, a chill  which we vociferously denied that we felt; and we had, all three, with  repetition, got into such splendid training that we went, each time,  almost automatically, to mark the close of the incident, through the  very same movements. It was striking of the children, at all events,  to kiss me inveterately with a kind of wild irrelevance and never to  fail--one or the other--of the precious question that had helped us  through many a peril. \"When do you think he WILL come? Don't you think  we OUGHT to write?\"--there was nothing like that inquiry, we found by  experience, for carrying off an awkwardness. \"He\" of course was their  uncle in Harley Street; and we lived in much profusion of theory that he  might at any moment arrive to mingle in our circle. It was impossible to  have given less encouragement than he had done to such a doctrine, but  if we had not had the doctrine to fall back upon we should have  deprived each other of some of our finest exhibitions. He never wrote to  them--that may have been selfish, but it was a part of the flattery of  his trust of me; for the way in which a man pays his highest tribute to  a woman is apt to be but by the more festal celebration of one of the  sacred laws of his comfort; and I held that I carried out the spirit of  the pledge given not to appeal to him when I let my charges understand  that their own letters were but charming literary exercises. They were  too beautiful to be posted; I kept them myself; I have them all to this  hour. This was a rule indeed which only added to the satiric effect of  my being plied with the supposition that he might at any moment be among  us. It was exactly as if my charges knew how almost more awkward than  anything else that might be for me. There appears to me, moreover, as  I look back, no note in all this more extraordinary than the mere fact  that, in spite of my tension and of their triumph, I never lost patience  with them. Adorable they must in truth have been, I now reflect, that I  didn't in these days hate them! Would exasperation, however, if relief  had longer been postponed, finally have betrayed me? It little matters,  for relief arrived. I call it relief, though it was only the relief that  a snap brings to a strain or the burst of a thunderstorm to a day of  suffocation. It was at least change, and it came with a rush.          XIV      Walking to church a certain Sunday morning, I had little Miles at my  side and his sister, in advance of us and at Mrs. Grose's, well in  sight. It was a crisp, clear day, the first of its order for some time;  the night had brought a touch of frost, and the autumn air, bright  and sharp, made the church bells almost gay. It was an odd accident of  thought that I should have happened at such a moment to be particularly  and very gratefully struck with the obedience of my little charges. Why  did they never resent my inexorable, my perpetual society? Something or  other had brought nearer home to me that I had all but pinned the boy to  my shawl and that, in the way our companions were marshaled before me,  I might have appeared to provide against some danger of rebellion. I  was like a gaoler with an eye to possible surprises and escapes. But all  this belonged--I mean their magnificent little surrender--just to the  special array of the facts that were most abysmal. Turned out for Sunday  by his uncle's tailor, who had had a free hand and a notion of  pretty waistcoats and of his grand little air, Miles's whole title to  independence, the rights of his sex and situation, were so stamped upon  him that if he had suddenly struck for freedom I should have had nothing  to say. I was by the strangest of chances wondering how I should meet  him when the revolution unmistakably occurred. I call it a revolution  because I now see how, with the word he spoke, the curtain rose on the  last act of my dreadful drama, and the catastrophe was precipitated.  \"Look here, my dear, you know,\" he charmingly said, \"when in the world,  please, am I going back to school?\"    Transcribed here the speech sounds harmless enough, particularly  as uttered in the sweet, high, casual pipe with which, at all  interlocutors, but above all at his eternal governess, he threw off  intonations as if he were tossing roses. There was something in  them that always made one \"catch,\" and I caught, at any rate, now so  effectually that I stopped as short as if one of the trees of the  park had fallen across the road. There was something new, on the spot,  between us, and he was perfectly aware that I recognized it, though,  to enable me to do so, he had no need to look a whit less candid and  charming than usual. I could feel in him how he already, from my at  first finding nothing to reply, perceived the advantage he had gained. I  was so slow to find anything that he had plenty of time, after a minute,  to continue with his suggestive but inconclusive smile: \"You know, my  dear, that for a fellow to be with a lady ALWAYS--!\" His \"my dear\" was  constantly on his lips for me, and nothing could have expressed more the  exact shade of the sentiment with which I desired to inspire my pupils  than its fond familiarity. It was so respectfully easy.    But, oh, how I felt that at present I must pick my own phrases! I  remember that, to gain time, I tried to laugh, and I seemed to see in  the beautiful face with which he watched me how ugly and queer I looked.  \"And always with the same lady?\" I returned.    He neither blanched nor winked. The whole thing was virtually out  between us. \"Ah, of course, she's a jolly, 'perfect' lady; but, after  all, I'm a fellow, don't you see? that's--well, getting on.\"    I lingered there with him an instant ever so kindly. \"Yes, you're  getting on.\" Oh, but I felt helpless!    I have kept to this day the heartbreaking little idea of how he seemed  to know that and to play with it. \"And you can't say I've not been  awfully good, can you?\"    I laid my hand on his shoulder, for, though I felt how much better it  would have been to walk on, I was not yet quite able. \"No, I can't say  that, Miles.\"    \"Except just that one night, you know--!\"    \"That one night?\" I couldn't look as straight as he.    \"Why, when I went down--went out of the house.\"    \"Oh, yes. But I forget what you did it for.\"    \"You forget?\"--he spoke with the sweet extravagance of childish  reproach. \"Why, it was to show you I could!\"    \"Oh, yes, you could.\"    \"And I can again.\"    I felt that I might, perhaps, after all, succeed in keeping my wits  about me. \"Certainly. But you won't.\"    \"No, not THAT again. It was nothing.\"    \"It was nothing,\" I said. \"But we must go on.\"    He resumed our walk with me, passing his hand into my arm. \"Then when AM  I going back?\"    I wore, in turning it over, my most responsible air. \"Were you very  happy at school?\"    He just considered. \"Oh, I'm happy enough anywhere!\"    \"Well, then,\" I quavered, \"if you're just as happy here--!\"    \"Ah, but that isn't everything! Of course YOU know a lot--\"    \"But you hint that you know almost as much?\" I risked as he paused.    \"Not half I want to!\" Miles honestly professed. \"But it isn't so much  that.\"    \"What is it, then?\"    \"Well--I want to see more life.\"    \"I see; I see.\" We had arrived within sight of the church and of various  persons, including several of the household of Bly, on their way to it  and clustered about the door to see us go in. I quickened our step;  I wanted to get there before the question between us opened up much  further; I reflected hungrily that, for more than an hour, he would have  to be silent; and I thought with envy of the comparative dusk of the pew  and of the almost spiritual help of the hassock on which I might bend  my knees. I seemed literally to be running a race with some confusion  to which he was about to reduce me, but I felt that he had got in first  when, before we had even entered the churchyard, he threw out--    \"I want my own sort!\"    It literally made me bound forward. \"There are not many of your own  sort, Miles!\" I laughed. \"Unless perhaps dear little Flora!\"    \"You really compare me to a baby girl?\"    This found me singularly weak. \"Don't you, then, LOVE our sweet Flora?\"    \"If I didn't--and you, too; if I didn't--!\" he repeated as if retreating  for a jump, yet leaving his thought so unfinished that, after we had  come into the gate, another stop, which he imposed on me by the pressure  of his arm, had become inevitable. Mrs. Grose and Flora had passed into  the church, the other worshippers had followed, and we were, for the  minute, alone among the old, thick graves. We had paused, on the path  from the gate, by a low,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20906"],[0,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 3, 1918 (#15)"],[1,"are not to be violated but with his wrath? Indeed, I tremble for       my country when I reflect that God is just; that his justice       cannot sleep forever; that considering numbers, nature and       natural means only, a revolution of the wheel of fortune, an       exchange of situation is among possible events; that it may       become probable by supernatural interference! The Almighty has no       attribute which can take side with us in such a contest.[67]         With the morals of the people, their industry also is destroyed.       For in a warm climate, no man will labor for himself who can make       another labor for him. This is so true that of the proprietors of       slaves a very small proportion indeed are ever seen to labor.[68]         It is impossible to be temperate and to pursue this subject       through the various considerations of policy, or morals, of       history, natural and civil. We must be contented to hope they       will force their way into every one's mind.... The way, I hope,       is preparing, under the auspices of heaven, for a total       emancipation, and that this is disposed, in the order of events,       to be with the consent of the masters, rather than by their       extirpation.[69]      IV    During the early part of Jefferson's public career he did not have a  good opinion of the Negro and his possibilities. This is his attitude  as expressed in his _Notes on Virginia_ in 1782, whenever he referred  to the Negro. Ignorant of the fact that science shows that no race is  superior to another, Jefferson considered the blacks inferior to the  Indians, believed that they lacked literary ability, the finer senses  of other races and although exhibiting a little aptitude in music were  both physically and mentally inferior to the whites.         It will probably be asked, why not retain and incorporate the       blacks into the State, and thus save the expense of supplying by       importation of white settlers, the vacancies they will leave?       Deep-rooted prejudices entertained by the whites; ten thousand       recollections, by the blacks, of the injuries they have       sustained; new provocations; the real distinctions which nature       has made; and many other circumstances will divide us into       parties, and produce convulsions, which will probably never end       but in the extermination of the one or the other race.[70]         To these objections, which are political may be added others,       which are physical and moral. Whether the black of the negro       resides in the reticular membrane between the skin and       scarf-skin, or in the scarf-skin itself; whether it proceeds from       the color of the blood, the color of the bile, or from that of       some other secretion, the difference is fixed in nature, and is       as real as if its seat and cause were better known to us. And is       this difference of no importance? Is it not the foundation of a       greater or less suffusions of color in the one, preferable to       that eternal monotony, which reign in the countenances, that       immovable veil of black which covers all the emotions of the       other race? Add to these, flowing hair, a more elegant symmetry       of form, their own judgment in favor of the whites, declared by       their preference of them, as uniformly as is the preference of       the Oranootan for the black woman over those of his own species.       The circumstance of superior beauty, is thought worthy attention       in the propagation of our horses, dogs, and other domestic       animals; why not in that of man? Besides those of color, figure,       and hair, there are other physical distinctions proving a       difference of race. They have less hair on the face and body.       They secrete less by the kidneys, and more by the glands of the       skin, which gives them a very strong and disagreeable odor. This       greater degree of transpiration renders them more tolerant of       heat, and less of cold than the whites. Perhaps, too, a       difference of structure in the pulmonary apparatus, which a late       ingenious experimentalist (Crawford) has discovered to be the       principal regulator of animal heat, may have disabled them from       extricating, in the act of inspiration, so much of that fluid       from the outer air, or obliged them in expiration, to part with       more of it.[71]         They seem to require less sleep. A black, after hard labor       through the day, will be induced by the slightest amusements to       sit up till midnight, or later, though knowing he must be out       with the first dawn of the morning.[72]         In general, their existence appears to participate more sensation       than reflection. To this must be ascribed their disposition to       sleep when abstracted from their diversions, and unemployed in       labor. An animal whose body is at rest, and who does not reflect,       must be disposed to sleep of course.[73]         Their griefs are transient. Those numberless afflictions, which       render it doubtful whether Heaven has given life to us in mercy       or in wrath, are less felt, and sooner forgotten with them.[74]         Comparing them by their faculties of memory, reason, and       imagination, it appears to me that in memory they are equal to       the whites; in reason much inferior, as I think one could       scarcely be found capable of tracing and comprehending the       investigations of Euclid; and that in imagination they are dull,       tasteless, and anomalous. It would be unfair to follow them to       Africa for this investigation. We will consider them here, on the       same stage with the whites, and where the facts are not       apocryphal on which a judgment is to be formed. It will be right       to make great allowances for the difference of condition, of       education, of conversation, of the sphere in which they move.       Many millions of them have been brought to, and born in America.       Most of them, indeed, have been confined to tillage, to their own       homes, and their own society; yet many of them have been so       situated that they might have availed themselves of the       conversation of their masters; many of them have been brought up       to the handicraft arts, and from that circumstance have always       been associated with the whites. Some have been liberally       educated, and all have lived in countries where the arts and       sciences are cultivated to a considerable degree, and have had       before their eyes samples of the best works from abroad. The       Indians, with no advantages of this kind, will often carve       figures on their pipes not destitute of design and merit. They       will crayon out an animal, a plant, or a country, so as to prove       the existence of a germ in their minds which only wants       cultivation. They astonish you with strokes of the most sublime       oratory; such as prove their reason and sentiment strong, their       imagination glowing and elevated. But never yet could I find that       a black had uttered a thought above the level of plain narration;       never saw ever an elementary trait of painting or sculpture.[75]         In music they are more generally gifted than the whites, with       accurate ears for tune and time, and they have been found capable       of imagining a small catch. Whether they will be equal to the       composition of a more extensive run of melody, or of complicated       harmony, is yet to be proved.[76]         Misery is often the parent of the most affecting touches in       poetry. Among the blacks is misery enough, God knows, but no       poetry. Their love is ardent, but it kindles the senses only, not       the imagination. Religion, indeed, has produced a Phyllis       Wheatley; but it could not produce a poet. The compositions       published under her name are below the dignity of criticism. The       heroes of the Dunciad are to her, as Hercules to the author of       that poem.[77]         Ignatius Sancho has approached nearer to merit in composition       (than Phyllis Wheatley); yet his letters do more honor to the       heart than the head. They breathe the purest effusions of       friendship and general philanthropy, and show how great a degree       of the latter may be compounded with strong religious zeal. He is       often happy in the turn of his compliments, and his style is easy       and familiar, except when he affects a Shandean fabrication of       words. But his imagination is wild and extravagant, escapes       incessantly from every restraint of reason and taste, and, in the       course of its vagaries, leaves a tract of thought as incoherent       and eccentric, as is the course of a meteor through the sky. His       subjects should often have led him to a process of sober       reasoning; yet we find him always substituting sentiment for       demonstration. Upon the whole, though we admit him to the first       place among those of his own color who have presented themselves       to the public judgment, yet when compare him with the writers of       the race among whom he lived and particularly with the epistolary       class in which he has taken his own stand, we are compelled to       enroll him at the bottom of the column. This criticism supposes       the letters published under the name to be genuine, and to have       received amendment from no other hand; points which would not be       of easy investigation.[78]         The improvement of the blacks in body and mind, in the first       instance of their mixture with the whites, has been observed by       every one, and proves that their inferiority is not the effect       merely of their condition in life.[79]         The opinion that they are inferior in the faculties of reason and       imagination, must be hazarded with great diffidence.
