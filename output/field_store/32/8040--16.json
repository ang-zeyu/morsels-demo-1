Be not  wrath, fair sir, I will set aside thine axe for thee, till thou bring  me the license, or bid me come see it, and thou shalt get the said  license at the Town Hall straight-way, when they may certify thee no  foeman of the Burg.\"    Ralph saw that it availed nothing to bicker with the smith, and so went  his way somewhat crestfallen, and that the more as he saw Roger  grinning a little.    Now they come into the market-place, on one side whereof was the master  church of the town, which was strongly built and with a tall tower to  it, but was not very big, and but little adorned.  Over against it they  saw the sign of the Flower de Luce, a goodly house and great.  Thitherward they turned; but in the face of the hostelry amidmost the  place was a thing which Roger pointed at with a grin that spoke as well  as words; and this was a high gallows-tree furnished with four forks or  arms, each carved and wrought in the fashion of the very bough of a  tree, from which dangled four nooses, and above them all was a board  whereon was written in big letters THE DRY TREE.  And at the foot of  this gallows were divers folk laughing and talking.    So Ralph understood at once that those four men whom he had seen led  away bound yesterday should be hanged thereon; so he stayed a franklin  who was passing by, and said to him, \"Sir, I am a stranger in the town,  and I would know if justice shall be done on the four woodmen to-day.\"  \"Nay,\" said the man, \"but to-morrow; they are even now before the  judges.\"    Then said Roger in a surly voice, \"Why art thou not there to look on?\"  \"Because,\" quoth the man, \"there is little to see there, and not much  more to hearken.  The thieves shall be speedily judged, and not  questioned with torments, so that they may be the lustier to feel what  the hangman shall work on them to-morrow; then forsooth the show shall  be goodly.  But far better had it been if we had had in our hands the  great witch of these dastards, as we looked to have her; but now folk  say that she has not been brought within gates, and it is to be feared  that she hath slipped through our fingers once more.\"    Roger laughed, and said:  \"Simple are ye folk of the Burg and know  nought of her shifts.  I tell thee it is not unlike that she is in the  Burg even now, and hath in hand to take out of your prison the four  whom ye have caught.\"    The franklin laughed scornfully in his turn and said: \"If we be simple,  thou art a fool merely:  are we not stronger and more than the Dry  Tree?  How should she not be taken?  How should she not be known if she  were walking about these streets?  Have we no eyes, fool-carle?\" And he  laughed again, for he was wroth.    Ralph hearkened, and a kind of fear seemed griping his heart, so he  asked the franklin:  \"Tell me, sir, are ye two speaking of a woman who  is Queen of these strong-thieves?\" \"Yea,\" said he, \"or it might better  be said that she is their goddess, their mawmet, their devil, the very  heart and soul of their wickedness.  But one day shall we have her body  and soul, and then shall her body have but an evil day of it till she  dieth in this world.\"    \"Yea, forsooth, if she can die at all,\" quoth Roger.    The franklin looked sourly on him and said:  \"Good man, thou knowest  much of her, meseemeth--Whence art thou?\" Said Roger speedily:  \"From  Hampton under Scaur; and her rebel I am, and her dastard, and her  runaway.  Therefore I know her forsooth.\"    \"Well,\" the Franklin said, \"thou seemest a true man, and yet I would  counsel thee to put a rein on thy tongue when thou art minded to talk  of the Devil of the Dry Tree, or thou mayst come to harm in the Burg.\"    He walked away towards the gallows therewith; and Roger said, almost as  if he were talking to himself; \"A heavy-footed fool goeth yonder; but  after this talk we were better hidden by the walls of the  Flower-de-Luce.\" So therewith they went on toward the hostel.    But the market place was wide, and they were yet some minutes getting  to the door, and ere they came there Ralph said, knitting his brows  anxiously: \"Is this woman fair or foul to look on?\"  \"That is nought so  easy to tell of,\" said Roger, \"whiles she is foul, whiles very fair,  whiles young and whiles old; whiles cruel and whiles kind.  But note  this, when she is the kindest then are her carles the cruellest; and  she is the kinder to them because they are cruel.\"    Ralph pondered what he said, and wondered if this were verily the woman  whom he had delivered, or some other.  As if answering to his unspoken  thought, Roger went on: \"They speak but of one woman amongst them of  the Dry Tree, but in sooth they have many others who are like unto her  in one way or other; and this again is a reason why they may not lay  hands on the very Queen of them all.\"    Therewithal they came unto the hostel, and found it fair enough within,  the hall great and goodly for such a house, and with but three  chapmen-carles therein.  Straightway they called for meat, for it was  now past noon, and the folk of the house served them when the grooms  had taken charge of Falcon.  And Roger served Ralph as if he were  verily his man.  Then Ralph went to his chamber aloft and rested a  while, but came down into the hall a little before nones, and found  Roger there walking up and down the hall floor, and no man else, so he  said to him:  \"Though thou art not of the Burg, thou knowest it; wilt  thou not come abroad then, and show it me? for I have a mind to learn  the ways of the folk here.\"    Said Roger, and smiled a little:  \"If thou commandest me as my lord, I  will come; yet I were better pleased to abide behind; for I am weary  with night-waking and sorrow; and have a burden of thought, one which I  must bear to the end of the road; and if I put it down I shall have to  go back and take it up again.\"    Ralph thought that he excused himself with more words than were needed;  but he took little heed of it, but nodded to him friendly, and went out  of the house afoot, but left his weapons and armour behind him by the  rede of Roger.        CHAPTER 13    The Streets of the Burg of the Four Friths      He went about the streets and found them all much like to the one which  they had entered by the north gate; he saw no poor or wretched houses,  and none very big as of great lords; they were well and stoutly  builded, but as aforesaid not much adorned either with carven work or  painting: there were folk enough in the streets, and now Ralph, as was  like to be, looked specially at the women, and thought many of them  little better-favoured than the men, being both dark and low; neither  were they gaily clad, though their raiment, like the houses, was stout  and well wrought.  But here and there he came on a woman taller and  whiter than the others, as though she were of another blood; all such  of these as he saw were clad otherwise than the darker women: their  heads uncoifed, uncovered save for some garland or silken band: their  gowns yellow like wheat-straw, but gaily embroidered; sleeveless withal  and short, scarce reaching to the ancles, and whiles so thin that they  were rather clad with the embroidery than the cloth; shoes they had  not, but sandals bound on their naked feet with white thongs, and each  bore an iron ring about her right arm.    The more part of the men wore weapons at their sides and had staves in  hand, and were clad in short jerkins brown or blue of colour, and  looked ready for battle if any moment should call them thereto; but  among them were men of different favour and stature from these, taller  for the most part, unarmed, and clad in long gowns of fair colours with  cloths of thin and gay-coloured web twisted about their heads.  These  he took for merchants, as they were oftenest standing in and about the  booths and shops, whereof there were some in all the streets, though  the market for victuals and such like he found over for that day, and  but scantily peopled.    Out of one of these markets, which was the fish and fowl market, he  came into a long street that led him down to a gate right over against  that whereby he had entered the Burg; and as he came thereto he saw  that there was a wide way clear of all houses inside of the wall, so  that men-at-arms might go freely from one part to the other; and he had  also noted that a wide way led from each port out of the great place,  and each ended not but in a gate.  But as to any castle in the town, he  saw none; and when he asked a burgher thereof, the carle laughed in his  face, and said to him that the whole Burg, houses and all, was a  castle, and that it would turn out to be none of the easiest to win.  And forsooth Ralph himself was much of that mind.    Now he was just within the south gate when he held this talk, and there  were many folk thereby already, and more flocking thereto; so he stood  there to see what should betide; and anon he heard great blowing of  horns and trumpets all along the wall, and, as he deemed, other horns  answered from without; and so it was; for soon the withoutward horns  grew louder, and the folk fell back on either side of the way, and next  the gates were thrown wide open (which before had been shut save for a  wicket) and thereafter came the first of a company of men-at-arms,  foot-men, with bills some, and some with bows, and all-armed knights  and sergeants a-horseback.    So streamed in these weaponed men till Ralph saw that it was a great  host that was entering the Burg; and his heart rose within him, so  warrior-like they were of men and array, though no big men of their  bodies; and many of them bore signs of battle about them, both in the  battering of their armour and the rending of their raiment, and the  clouts tied about the wounds on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16921"],[0,"Plague Ship (#15)"],[1,"  That was only too true as Dane could now recall. And the fact that the  steward had not been at the feast, had not sampled native food products,  wiped out the simplest and most comforting reasons for his present  collapse.    \"What's this about Frank?\" Ali stood in the doorway. \"He said yesterday  that he had a headache. But now Tau has him shut off--\"    \"But he wasn't at that feast.\" Ali stopped short as the implications of  that struck him. \"How's Tang feeling?\"    \"Fine--why?\" The Com-tech had come up behind Kamil and was answering for  himself. \"Why this interest in the state of my health?\"    \"Frank's down with something--in isolation,\" Rip replied bluntly. \"Did he  do anything out of the ordinary when we were off ship?\"    For a long moment the other stared at Shannon and then he shook his head.  \"No. And he wasn't dirt-side to any extent either. So Tau's running  tests--\" He lapsed into silence. None of them wished to put their  thoughts into words.    Dane picked up the microtape he had brought with him and went on down the  corridor to return it. The panel of the cargo office was ajar and to his  relief he found Van Rycke out. He shoved the tape back in its case and  pulled out the next one. Sinbad was there, not in his own private  hammock, but sprawled out on the Cargo-master's bunk. He watched Dane  lazily, mouthing a silent mew of welcome. For some reason since they had  blasted from Sargol the cat had been lazy--as if his adventures afield  there had sapped much of his vitality.    \"Why aren't you out working?\" Dane asked as he leaned over to scratch  under a furry chin raised for the benefit of such a caress. \"You inspect  the hold lately, boy?\"    Sinbad merely blinked and after the manner of his species looked  infinitely bored. As Dane turned to go the Cargo-master came in. He  showed no surprise at Dane's presence. Instead he reached out and  fingered the label of the tape Dane had just chosen. After a glance at  the identifying symbol he took it out of his assistant's hand, plopped it  back in its case, and stood for a moment eyeing the selection of past  voyage records. With a tongue-click of satisfaction he pulled out another  and tossed it across the desk to Dane.    \"See what you can make out of this tangle,\" he ordered. But Dane's  shoulders went back as if some weight had been lifted from them. The old  easiness was still lacking, but he was no longer exiled to the outer  darkness of Van Rycke's displeasure.    Holding the microtape as if it were a first grade Koros stone Dane went  back to his own cabin, snapped the tape into his reader, adjusted the ear  buttons and lay back on his bunk to listen.    He was deep in the intricacy of a deal so complicated that he was lost  after the first two moves, when he opened his eyes to see Ali at the door  panel. The Engineer-apprentice made an emphatic beckoning wave and Dane  slipped off the ear buttons.    \"What is it?\" His question lacked a cordial note.    \"I've got to have help.\" Ali was terse. \"Kosti's blacked out!\"    \"What!\" Dane sat up and dropped his feet to the deck in almost one  movement.    \"I can't shift him alone,\" Ali stated the obvious. The giant jetman was  almost double his size. \"We must get him to his quarters. And I won't ask  Stotz--\"    For a perfectly good reason Dane knew. An assistant--two of the  apprentices--could go sick, but their officers' continued good health  meant the most to the Queen. If some infection were aboard it would be  better for Ali and himself to be exposed, than to have Johan Stotz with  all his encyclopedic knowledge of the ship's engines contract any  disease.    They found the jetman half sitting, half lying in the short foot or so of  corridor which led to his own cubby. He had been making for his quarters  when the seizure had taken him. And by the time the two reached his side,  he was beginning to come around, moaning, his hands going to his head.    Together they got him on his feet and guided him to his bunk where he  collapsed again, dead weight they had to push into place. Dane looked at  Ali--    \"Tau?\"    \"Haven't had time to call him yet.\" Ali was jerking at the thigh straps  which fastened Kosti's space boots.    \"I'll go.\" Glad for the task Dane sped up the ladder to the next section  and threaded the narrow side hall to the Medic's cabin where he knocked  on the panel.    There was a pause before Craig Tau looked out, deep lines of weariness  bracketing his mouth, etched between his eyes.    \"Kosti, sir,\" Dane gave his bad news quickly. \"He's collapsed. We got him  to his cabin--\"    Tau showed no sign of surprise. His hand shot out for his kit.    \"You touched him?\" At the other's nod he added an order. \"Stay in your  quarters until I have a chance to look you over--understand?\"    Dane had no chance to answer, the Medic was already on his way. He went  to his own cabin, understanding the reason for his imprisonment, but  inwardly rebelling against it. Rather than sit idle he snapped on the  reader--but, although facts and figures were dunned into his ears--he  really heard very little. He couldn't apply himself--not with a new  specter leering at him from the bulkhead.    The dangers of the space lanes were not to be numbered, death walked  among the stars a familiar companion of all spacemen. And to the Free  Trader it was the extra and invisible crewman on every ship that raised.  But there were deaths and deaths--And Dane could not forget the gruesome  legends Van Rycke collected avidly as his hobby--had recorded in his  private library of the folk lore of space.    Stories such as that of the ghostly \"New Hope\" carrying refugees from the  first Martian Rebellion--the ship which had lifted for the stars but had  never arrived, which wandered for a timeless eternity, a derelict in free  fall, its port closed but the warning \"dead\" lights on at its nose--a  ship which through five centuries had been sighted only by a spacer in  similar distress. Such stories were numerous. There were other tales of  \"plague\" ships wandering free with their dead crews, or discovered and  shot into some sun by a patrol cruiser so that they might not carry their  infection farther. Plague--the nebulous \"worst\" the Traders had to face.  Dane screwed his eyes shut, tried to concentrate upon the droning voice  in his ears, but he could not control his thoughts nor--his fears.    At a touch on his arm he started so wildly that he jerked the cord loose  from the reader and sat up, somewhat shamefaced, to greet Tau. At the  Medic's orders he stripped for one of the most complete examinations he  had ever undergone outside a quarantine port. It included an almost  microscopic inspection of the skin on his neck and shoulders, but when  Tau had done he gave a sigh of relief.    \"Well, you haven't got it--at least you don't show any signs yet,\" he  amended his first statement almost before the words were out of his  mouth.    \"What were you looking for?\"    Tau took time out to explain. \"Here,\" his fingers touched the small  hollow at the base of Dane's throat and then swung him around and  indicated two places on the back of his neck and under his shoulder  blades. \"Kosti and Mura both have red eruptions here. It's as if they  have been given an injection of some narcotic.\" Tau sat down on the jump  seat while Dane dressed. \"Kosti was dirt-side--he might have picked up  something--\"    \"But Mura--\"    \"That's it!\" Tau brought his fist down on the edge of the bunk. \"Frank  hardly left the ship--yet he showed the first signs. On the other hand  you are all right so far and you were off ship. And Ali's clean and he  was with you on the hunt. We'll just have to wait and see.\" He got up  wearily. \"If your head begins to ache,\" he told Dane, \"you get back here  in a hurry and stay put--understand?\"    As Dane learned all the other members of the crew were given the same  type of inspection. But none of them showed the characteristic marks  which meant trouble. They were on course for Terra--but--and that but  must have loomed large in all their minds--once there would they be  allowed to land? Could they even hope for a hearing? Plague ship--Tau  must find the answer before they came into normal space about their own  solar system or they were in for such trouble as made a broken contract  seem the simplest of mishaps.    Kosti and Mura were in isolation. There were volunteers for nursing and  Tau, unable to be in two places at once, finally picked Weeks to look  after his crewmate in the engineering section.    There was doubling up of duties. Tau could no longer share with Mura the  care of the hydro garden so Van Rycke took over. While Dane found himself  in charge of the galley and, while he did not have Mura's deft hand at  disguising the monotonous concentrates to the point they resembled fresh  food, after a day or two he began to experiment cautiously and produced a  stew which brought some short words of appreciation from Captain Jellico.    They all breathed a sigh of relief when, after three days, no more signs  of the mysterious illness showed on new members of the crew. It became  routine to parade before Tau stripped to the waist each morning for the  inspection of the danger points, and the Medic's vigilance did not  relax.    In the meantime neither Mura nor Kosti appeared to suffer. Once the  initial stages of headaches and blackouts were passed, the patients  lapsed into a semi-conscious state as if they were under sedation of some  type. They would eat, if the food was placed in their mouths, but they  did not seem to know what was going on about them, nor did they answer  when spoken to.    Tau, between visits to them, worked feverishly in his tiny lab, analyzing  blood samples, reading the records of obscure diseases, trying to find  the reason for their attacks. But as yet his discoveries were exactly  nothing. He had come out of his quarters and sat in limp exhaustion at  the mess "]]]
