It is a beautiful palace built of crystal, and decorated with statues  and paintings. One of the paintings is thus described:    \"There is your Majesty at _pasa_ (dice) with the queen: behind you  stands one damsel with the betel box, whilst another is waving the  _chownri_ over your head: the dwarf is playing with the monkey, and the  parrot abusing the Vidushaka.\" The chamber also contains the portrait of  Mrigankavali, the damsel whom the prince has really seen in his supposed  dream. There is also a statue of her, whence the drama is named _Viddha  Salabhanjika_, meaning a curved statue or effigy.    The king discovers the statue. He thinks, \"Who will carve on the wall  the person I dreamed of? No one was present when I dreamt. Has anyone  carved the statue out of his fancy? A real person may exist in this  world or how can an exact figure come here?\"    He now verily believes the dream to be a reality. He then puts the  necklace of his dream on the neck of the carved statue.    Finally the lady is herself beheld through the transparent wall of the  pavilion, but runs away on being observed. The king becomes enamoured of  her. He and his friend follow her but in vain. The bards proclaim it at  noon, and the two friends repair to the queen's apartments to perform  the midday ceremonies.    Kuvalayamala, the object of the king's passion before encountering his  new flame, is the daughter of Chandramahasena, the king of Kuntala. She  has been sent to Vidyadhara Malla's queen, as the betrothed bride of the  supposed son of Chandraverma, who is the queen's maternal uncle.  Mekhala, the queen's foster-sister, practises a frolic on Charayana. He  is promised a new bride by the queen, and the ceremony is about to take  place when the spouse proves to be a \"lubberly boy\"; he is highly  indignant at the trick, and goes off threatening vengeance.    The king having followed and pacified his companion, they go off into  the garden, where they see the damsel Mrigankavali playing with ball:  she still however flies their advance. Presently they overhear a  conversation between her and one of her companions, from which it  appears, that notwithstanding her shyness she is equally enamoured of  the king.    Her dress is the contrivance of the minister, at whose instigation,  Mrigankavali is persuaded by Sulakshana to believe that she is to behold  the present deity of love, and is introduced by a sliding door into the  king's chamber. The consequence of the interview is to render  Mrigankavali passionately enamoured of the king.    One day, the queen, in order to deceive Charayana, manages to celebrate  a marriage between him and a son of a maid-servant veiled as a female.  The trick is discovered. He is highly indignant.    He now retaliates with the help of the king. He induces Sulakshana, one  of the female attendants of the queen, to ascend a _Bakula_ tree and  thence send a message in a nasal tone, as if from the sky, to Mekhala,  the foster-sister and chief attendant of the queen.    \"Thou shalt die at this spot on the full moon day of _Baisakh_.\" After  many entreaties, the heavenly voice prescribes a relief, \"Thou art safe  if thou canst pass through the legs of a Brahmin skilled in music and  gratified with a fee.\" Charayana, just the kind of Brahmin required,  arrives at this juncture. The king and the queen are present. Mekhala  and the queen, both overcome with concern, entreat Charayana to be the  Brahmin that shall preserve the life of the former. He consents. As  Mekhala tries to pass between his legs, he mounts on her back and says,  \"you are now caught in your turn. You deceived me once. Now marry me.\"  He triumphs in the humiliation he has inflicted on her. The queen now  perceives the intrigue of the king, is in her turn incensed, goes off in  a pet and resolves to take revenge.    Chandamahasen, the king of Kuntala as a defeated prince now resides with  his daughter Kubalayamala under the protection of the victorious king.  The king sees her one day as she rises after bathing in the Narbadda. He  becomes enamoured of her and wishes to marry her. The queen gets scent  of the matter. To prevent the curse of co-wifeship, the queen now  resolves to get her husband married to the son of her maternal uncle so  that he may be ashamed into abandoning his polygamous tendency.    The king and the Vidushaka seek the garden, where it is now moon-light.  Mrigankavali and her friend Vilakshana also come thither, and the lovers  meet: this interview is broken off by a cry that the queen is coming,  and they all separate abruptly.    At dawn, Charayana's wife is asleep. In her sleep, however, she is very  communicative, and repeats a supposed dialogue between the queen and the  Raja, in which the former urges the latter to marry Mrigankavali, the  sister of the supposed Mrigankavarma, come on a visit, it is pretended,  to her brother--this being a plot of the queen's to cheat the king into  a sham marriage, by espousing him to one she believes to be a boy.    The Vidushaka suspects the trick, however, and wakes his wife, who rises  and goes to the queen. The Vidushaka joins his master. The king, who is  already the husband of the princesses of Magadha, Malava, Panchala,  Avanti, Jalandhara and Kerala, is wedded to Mrigankavali. As soon as the  ceremony is gone through, a messenger from the court of Chandraverma  arrives to announce:--    \"O queen! His Majesty Chandravarma wishes it to be known that  Mrigankavarma is not his son but his daughter. In the absence of a son  he dressed her as such to satisfy his desire for a son. Now that a son  has been born to him, it is not necessary to keep up the pretence. The  king requests you to settle a suitable marriage for her. The sages have  prophesied paramount sovereignty for her husband.\"    The queen becomes stunned and soliloquises:--    \"What is play to me, Providence ordains to be a stern fact. Man  proposes, God disposes.\" She now finds that she has taken herself in,  and given herself another rival wife. As the matter is past remedy,  however, she assents with a good grace. The minister is glad that his  aims are fulfilled. All are happy, Why should Kuvalayamala alone be  sorry? The queen therefore allows her lord to marry Kuvalyamala.    To crown the king's happiness, a messenger, sent by the General of His  Majesty's forces, now arrives from the camp with the news that the  allied armies of Kernata, Simhala, Pandya, Murala, Andhra, and Konkana  have been defeated, and Virapala, king of Kuntala, the ally of  Vidyadhara Malla, reseated on a throne, from which his kinsman,  supported by those troops, had formerly expelled him. The authority of  Vidyadhara Malla as paramount sovereign is now declared to extend from  the mouths of the Ganges to the sea, and from the Narbada to the  Tamraperni in the Deccan.          RATNAVALI OR THE NECKLACE.      A holy seer announces to Yaugandharayana, the chief minister of Vatsa,  the king of Kausambi, that whoever shall wed Ratnavali, the fair  daughter of Vikramabahu, the king of _Sinhala_ or Ceylon and maternal  uncle of Vasavadatta, the queen of Vatsa, should become the emperor of  the world. The faithful minister, desirous of securing paramount  sovereignty for his master, sends, without his knowledge and consent, an  envoy to the court of Vikramabahu to negotiate the match. Vikramabahu  declines to inflict the curse of co-wifeship upon his daughter and  niece. The disappointed envoy returns home.    The premier is sorry, but does not lose hope. After much deliberation,  he hits upon an ingenious device. He proclaims in Ceylon by agents that  queen Vasavadatta is dead, being burnt by chance and that the king,  though much grieved, has at last consented, at the request of friends  and relatives, to marry again. The intelligence reaches the ears of  Vikramabahu who believes it.    The premier now sends Babhravya as envoy to the Court of Ceylon to  reopen the question of Ratnavali's marriage with Vatsa. Vikramabahu,  after consulting his queen, consents to the proposal. He has Ratnavali  decked in all ornaments including a single-stringed necklace round her  neck and sends her away on board a ship, in company with his own  ambassador Vasubhuti and Babhravya. He waits on the shore till the ship  is out of sight and then returns home sorry at parting with his  daughter.    A terrible tempest wrecks the ship. A merchant of Kausambi finds  Ratnavali floating in mid-sea, saves her life and brings her to the  minister who thanks him heartily for the favour and offers a reward. The  merchant thus expresses his unwillingness to accept it, \"Sir, under the  rule of our gracious king, the weak do not fear the strong; the rich  cannot oppress the poor; the word \"robber\" has become obsolete; the sick  and the orphans are being treated by the best of physicians and are free  from any want of food and clothing; children are being properly  educated; drought is never heard of; the highways are wide, clean, and  well-guarded; communications are safe. If any loyal subject can be of  any service to such a king, he does only his bare duty and should not  accept any reward.\" He at last accepts the reward at the repeated  requests of the minister and goes home.    Then the minister interviews the queen, conceals the real facts and  addresses her thus:--    \"May it please your Majesty. I have received this girl from a merchant  who told me that he had rescued her in the sea, but could not say  anything more about her and her whereabouts. From her appearance she  seems to be a respectable lady. I beseech your Majesty to take care of  her.\" The queen takes the girl as one of her attendants--the girl who is  destined to make her husband the lord of the world! The queen names her  Sagarika or the Ocean Maid. The princess, who has been attended by  hundreds of maidservants, is now reduced, by a strange irony of fate,  to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18297"],[0,"The Story of a Summer (#15)"],[1,"tion, though small, is  admirable, containing two or three _bona-fide_ old masters, purchased  at the sales of private galleries in Florence and Rome.    The pictures, like the books, have been kept hitherto in the house in  the woods, but this spring Ida moved them all to the roadside house  that we might constantly enjoy them, and the parlor now presents quite  the appearance of a museum.  It is over the music-room, and its long  French windows open upon a balcony, from which we daily admire our  tender, Italian-like sunsets.  To the right it is overhung by the  branches of our favorite apple-tree, from whose clusters of tiny fruit  we each chose an apple some days since.  Gabrielle then marked them  with the owner's initial cut out of paper, the form of which we will  find in the autumn indelibly impressed in the apple's rosy cheek.    But to return to our museum.  Upon ascending the stairs one's eyes  first rest upon the \"very saddest face ever painted or conceived,\" as  Hawthorne describes the beautiful Cenci.  While in Rome I resided upon  the Piazza Barberini, opposite the palace containing this exquisite  painting, and I visited it with a devotion almost equalling Hilda's.  Much excitement prevailed that winter in art circles concerning the  authenticity of this picture, and hot discussions took place wherever  the believers and unbelievers chanced to meet.  No possible proof  existed, one party would declare, that Guido had ever painted Beatrice  Cenci; and no one had thought of it as other than a fancy head until  Shelley had aroused the interest of the public in the half-forgotten  tragedy of poor Beatrice's sad life by the sombre drama, \"The Cenci.\"  From that time, they say, caprice has christened this picture Beatrice  Cenci, and Hawthorne has added much to its interest by the prominence  he gives it in the \"Marble Faun.\"  They, however, are unable to find  the traces of sorrow, the \"tear-stained cheeks\" and \"eyes that have  wept till they can weep no more,\" so eloquently described by all  writers and art-critics of the present day; and so far I agree with  them--the face does not impress me with such depths of woe.    Their opponents, however, hold the time-honored tradition that Guido  painted Beatrice in her cell upon the morning of her execution, or as  she stood upon the scaffold--for there are two versions of the  story--and that the gown and turban which she wears were made by her  own hands on the night preceding the fatal day.  But no words of mine  can give a fair idea of this celebrated painting: I will transcribe  Hawthorne's description of it.    \"The picture represented simply a female head; a very youthful,  girlish, perfectly beautiful face, enveloped in white drapery, from  beneath which strayed a lock or two of what seemed a rich though hidden  luxuriance of auburn hair.  The eyes were large and brown, and met  those of the spectator, but evidently with a strange, ineffectual  effort to escape.  There was a little redness about the eyes, very  slightly indicated, so that you would question whether or no the girl  had been weeping.  The whole face was quiet; there was no distortion or  disturbance of any single feature, nor was it easy to see why the  expression was not cheerful, or why a single touch of the artist's  pencil should not brighten it into joyousness.  But in fact it was the  very saddest picture ever painted or conceived; it involved an  unfathomable depth of sorrow, the sense of which came to the observer  by a sort of intuition.  It was a sorrow that removed this beautiful  girl out of the sphere of humanity, and set her in a far-off region,  the remoteness of which--while yet her face is so close before  us--makes us shiver as at a spectre.\"    Next to the Cenci a St. Francis hangs, his hands devoutly folded and  his head bowed in pious meditation upon the sufferings of his Redeemer,  whose figure bound upon the Cross lies before him.  The skull at his  feet and the dreary landscape surrounding him indicate his hermit-life  of isolation and penance.  The Saint is dressed in the coarse brown  habit of a mendicant friar, and his face is luminous with that  gentleness that distinguished his character after his conversion; for  it is recorded of him that he would step aside rather than harm the  smallest insect.    Above St. Francis is one of the most precious gems, historically and  intrinsically considered, of the collection.  The picture is  small--only cabinet size; but it is none the less valuable on that  account, when we reflect that it dates from the sixteenth or early in  the seventeenth century.  It is a portrait of Galileo painted from life  by Andrea Bartone, and was bought at a sale of the Santi Gallery.  Only  the head and bust are represented--the latter clothed in a dark-brown  open vest, with a scarlet mantle thrown over the shoulders; but the  face is one that would not easily be forgotten--a rugged, powerful  face, with great, earnest eyes, scant hair well sprinkled with gray,  and deep furrows lining the dark brow.    Over the doorway, opening into the room that was formerly Aunt Mary's,  is an antique marble medallion of Juno, the haughty Mother of the gods;  this was dug up near Tusculum.    Next comes an exquisite Madonna and Child by Carlo Dolce (a copy).  The  mother's face is youthful and radiant with divine beauty: the Infant  Jesus stands upon her knee, and extends a plump little hand in  benediction.    Next, a portrait of uncle painted in 1839--two years earlier than the  one that hangs in the dining-room.  This picture, mamma says, was an  excellent likeness of him when he was twenty-eight years old; and the  biographers who are so prone to describe him in his younger days as  having been \"uncouth\" and \"awkward,\" would be, I think, much startled  if they could see it.  His coat is black, with a black tie, like other  gentlemen, and his air, instead of being \"rustic\" or \"gawky,\" is  expressive of gentle dignity, while his face, so often described as  plain, is to me beautiful enough to have represented a young saint.    Next these pictures is another medallion--the \"Mother of the Gracchi,\"  and under them a small table upon which stand several marble  curiosities: a model of the tomb of Scipio, Minerva issuing from the  head of Jupiter, and two busts of Roman soldiers in the time of  Titus--antiques, and quite yellow and valuable.    In the centre of the parlor is a round table bought in Rome, and made  of variegated marble taken from the ruins of the palace of the Caesars.    In a corner, upon a handsome pedestal, stands Powers' bust of  Proserpine, of which uncle was especially proud.  He speaks of it in  his \"Glances at Europe,\" in these words:    \"I defy Antiquity to surpass--I doubt its ability to rival--Powers'  Proserpine and his Psyche with any models of the female head that have  come down to us; and while I do not see how they could be excelled in  their own sphere, I feel that Powers, unlike Alexander, has still  realms to conquer, and will fulfil his destiny.\"    A very prominent picture, and one that was a great favorite with uncle,  is an original portrait of Luther, by Lucas Cranach, one of the great  lights of the Flemish school of painting.  I have seen in the Dresden  Gallery the counterpart to this picture, painted by the same artist,  but representing Luther after death.  I much prefer the animated  expression of the _living_ picture, for it is hard to think of the  fiery reformer as dead, even at this late day.    Over the sofa is a large Holy Family, a painting in the school of  Raphael, and underneath it hangs one of our most valuable pictures--a  veritable Guercino, painted in 1648.  The subject is St. Mary Magdalen.    I wish that I had time to write in detail of all the beautiful things  in the parlor--a card-table made like the centre-table of classic  marble from the ruins of Rome, an exquisite moonlight view of a  Benedictine Convent upon the Bay of Naples, with a young girl kneeling  before the shrine of the Madonna; a Venetian scene--the Doge's palace  with its graceful, Moorish architecture; St. Peter and St. Paul; the  Cumaean Sybil, a beautiful female figure whose partly veiled face  seemed full of mystery; St. Agatha, and an Ecce Homo.  There are still  some more marble medallions that I have not mentioned; several valuable  antiques, portraits of Alexander the Great and Tacitus, and a  bas-relief representing the flight of Aeneas--the former found near the  Appian Way--and two others that are comparatively modern--likenesses of  Pope Clement XI., and Vittoria Colonna, the gifted Italian poetess of  the fifteenth century.    But I have not yet spoken of the pearl of our museum.  This piece of  sculpture was not one of uncle's Italian purchases, nor does it date  back for centuries, but it is priceless to us, especially as it is, we  believe, the only copy now existing.  I allude to the bust made of  uncle in 1846 by Hart, the Kentucky sculptor.  This bust was the first  work of importance that Mr. Hart had ever executed, for he was then in  the first flush of manhood, and the early vigor of that genius that has  since wrought out so many beautiful creations.  Then, however, he had  not modelled his fine statue of Henry Clay, ordered by the ladies of  Virginia, nor had he even dreamed of his lovely \"Triumph of Woman\" that  when finished will send his name down to posterity, as our greatest  _creative_ American sculptor.    Mamma was living with uncle when Mr. Hart arrived in New York with a  commission from Cassius M. Clay to make this bust, and she has often  told me all the circumstances of the sittings.  Uncle was then, as  ever, extremely busy, and it was very difficult for him to give Mr.  Hart an occasional half hour for a sitting.  As ordinary means failed,  Mr. Hart brought his clay and instruments to _The Tribune_ office, and  there he worked whilst uncle rested from his daily editorial labors;"]]]
