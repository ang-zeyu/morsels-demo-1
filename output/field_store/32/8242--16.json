It is not only not  true, but the very opposite of the truth. As to modern times, and I  date them from about 1000 after Christ, I can only say that, after  reading the accounts of the terrors and horrors of Mohammedan rule, my  wonder is that so much of native virtue and truthfulness should have  survived. You might as well expect a mouse to speak the truth before a  cat, as a Hindu before a Mohammedan judge.[82] If you frighten a  child, that child will tell a lie; if you terrorize millions, you must  not be surprised if they try to escape from your fangs. Truthfulness  is a luxury, perhaps the greatest, and let me assure you, the most  expensive luxury in our life--and happy the man who has been able to  enjoy it from his very childhood. It may be easy enough in our days  and in a free country, like England, never to tell a lie--but the  older we grow, the harder we find it to be always true, to speak the  truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. The Hindus too had  made that discovery. They too knew how hard, nay how impossible it is,  always to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  There is a short story in the _S_atapatha Brahma_n_a, to my mind full  of deep meaning, and pervaded by the real sense of truth, the real  sense of the difficulty of truth. His kinsman said to Aru_n_a  Aupave_s_i, \"Thou art advanced in years, establish thou the  sacrificial fires.\" He replied: \"Thereby you tell me henceforth to  keep silence. For he who has established the fires must not speak an  untruth, and only by not speaking at all, one speaks no untruth. To  that extent the service of the sacrificial fires consists in  truth.\"[83]    I doubt whether in any other of the ancient literatures of the world  you will find traces of that extreme sensitiveness of conscience which  despairs of our ever speaking the truth, and which declares silence  gold, and speech silver, though, in a much higher sense than our  proverb.    What I should wish to impress on those who will soon find themselves  the rulers of millions of human beings in India, is the duty to shake  off national prejudices, which are apt to degenerate into a kind of  madness. I have known people with a brown skin whom I could look up to  as my betters. Look for them in India, and you will find them, and if  you meet with disappointments, as no doubt you will, think of the  people with white skins whom you have trusted, and whom you can trust  no more. We are all apt to be Pharisees in international judgments. I  read only a few days ago in a pamphlet written by an enlightened  politician, the following words:        \"Experience only can teach that nothing is so truly      astonishing to a morally depraved people as the phenomenon of      a race of men in whose word perfect confidence may be      placed[84].... The natives are conscious of their inferiority      in nothing so much as in this. They require to be taught      rectitude of conduct much more than literature and science.\"    If you approach the Hindus with such feelings, you will teach them  neither rectitude, nor science, nor literature. Nay, they might appeal  to their own literature, even to their law-books, to teach us at least  one lesson of truthfulness, truthfulness to ourselves, or, in other  words, humility.    What does Ya_gn_avalkya say?[85]        \"It is not our hermitage,\" he says--our religion we might      say--\"still less the color of our skin, that produces virtue;      virtue must be practiced. Therefore let no one do to others      what he would not have done to himself.\"    And the laws of the Manavas, which were so much abused by Mill, what  do they teach?[86]        \"Evil-doers think indeed that no one sees them; but the gods      see them, and the old man within.\"        \"Self is the witness of Self, Self is the refuge of Self. Do      not despise thy own Self, the highest witness of men.\"[87]        \"If, friend, thou thinkest thou art self-alone, remember      there is the silent thinker (the Highest Self) always within      thy heart, and _he_ sees what is good and what is evil.\"[88]        \"O friend, whatever good thou mayest have done from thy very      birth, all will go to the dogs, if thou speak an untruth.\"    Or in Vasish_th_a, XXX. 1:        \"Practice righteousness, not unrighteousness; speak truth,      not untruth; look far, not near; look up toward the highest,      not toward anything low.\"    No doubt there is moral depravity in India, and where is there no  moral depravity in this world? But to appeal to international  statistics would be, I believe, a dangerous game. Nor must we forget  that our standards of morality differ, and, on some points, differ  considerably from those recognized in India; and we must not wonder if  sons do not at once condemn as criminal what their fathers and  grandfathers considered right. Let us hold by all means to _our_ sense  of what is right and what is wrong; but in judging others, whether in  public or in private life, whether as historians or politicians, let  us not forget that a kindly spirit will never do any harm. Certainly  I can imagine nothing more mischievous, more dangerous, more fatal to  the permanence of English rule in India, than for the young civil  servants to go to that country with the idea that it is a sink of  moral depravity, an ants' nest of lies; for no one is so sure to go  wrong, whether in public or in private life, as he who says in his  haste: \"All men are liars.\"    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 17: Mill's \"History of British India,\" ed.

These facts are expressed by writing the formulas for the two  substances with a period between them. Thus the formula for crystallized  copper sulphate is CuSO_{4}.5H_{2}O; that of gypsum is CaSO_{4}.2H_{2}O.    ~Heat of reaction.~ Attention has frequently been directed to the fact  that chemical changes are usually accompanied by heat changes. In  general it has been found that in every chemical action heat is either  absorbed or given off. By adopting a suitable unit for the measurement  of heat, the heat change during a chemical reaction can be expressed in  the equation for the reaction.    Heat cannot be measured by the use of a thermometer alone, since the  thermometer measures the intensity of heat, not its quantity. The  easiest way to measure a quantity of heat is to note how warm it will  make a definite amount of a given substance chosen as a standard. Water  has been chosen as the standard, and the unit of heat is called a  _calorie. A calorie is defined as the amount of heat required to raise  the temperature of one gram of water one degree._    By means of this unit it is easy to indicate the heat changes in a given  chemical reaction. The equation        2H + O = H_{2}O + 68,300 cal.    means that when 2.016 g. of hydrogen combine with 16 g. of oxygen,  18.016 g. of water are formed and 68,300 cal. are set free.        C + 2S = CS_{2} - 19,000 cal.    means that an expenditure of 19,000 cal. is required to cause 12 g. of  carbon to unite with 64.12 g. of sulphur to form 76.12 g. of carbon  disulphide. In these equations it will be noted that the symbols stand  for as many grams of the substance as there are units in the weights of  the atoms represented by the symbols. This is always understood to be  the case in equations where the heat of reaction is given.    ~Conditions of a chemical action are not indicated by equations.~  Equations do not tell the conditions under which a reaction will take  place. The equation        HgO = Hg + O    does not tell us that it is necessary to keep the mercuric oxide at a  high temperature in order that the decomposition may go on. The equation        Zn + 2HCl = ZnCl_{2} + 2H    in no way indicates the fact that the hydrochloric acid must be  dissolved in water before it will act upon the zinc. From the equation        H + Cl = HCl    it would not be suspected that the two gases hydrogen and chlorine will  unite instantly in the sunlight, but will stand mixed in the dark a long  time without change. It will therefore be necessary to pay much  attention to the details of the conditions under which a given reaction  occurs, as well as to the expression of the reaction in the form of an  equation.

CHAPTER VII    NITROGEN AND THE RARE ELEMENTS: ARGON, HELIUM, NEON, KRYPTON, XENON      ~Historical.~ Nitrogen was discovered by the English chemist Rutherford in  1772. A little later Scheele showed it to be a constituent of air, and  Lavoisier gave it the name _azote_, signifying that it would not support  life. The name _nitrogen_ was afterwards given it because of its  presence in saltpeter or niter. The term azote and symbol Az are still  retained by the French chemists.    ~Occurrence.~ Air is composed principally of oxygen and nitrogen in the  free state, about 78 parts by volume out of every 100 parts being  nitrogen. Nitrogen also occurs in nature in the form of potassium  nitrate (KNO_{3})--commonly called saltpeter or niter--as well as in  sodium nitrate (NaNO_{3}). Nitrogen is also an essential constituent of  all living organisms; for example, the human body contains about 2.4% of  nitrogen.    ~Preparation from air.~ Nitrogen can be prepared from air by the action of  some substance which will combine with the oxygen, leaving the nitrogen  free. Such a substance must be chosen, however, as will combine with the  oxygen to form a product which is not a gas, and which can be readily  separated from the nitrogen. The substances most commonly used for this  purpose are phosphorus and copper.    1. _By the action of phosphorus._ The method used for the preparation of  nitrogen by the action of phosphorus is as follows:    The phosphorus is placed in a little porcelain dish, supported on a cork  and floated on water (Fig. 26). It is then ignited by contact with a hot  wire, and immediately a bell jar or bottle is brought over it so as to  confine a portion of the air. The phosphorus combines with the oxygen to  form an oxide of phosphorus, known as phosphorus pentoxide. This is a  white solid which floats about in the bell jar, but in a short time it  is all absorbed by the water, leaving the nitrogen. The withdrawal of  the oxygen is indicated by the rising of the water in the bell jar.    [Illustration: Fig. 26]    2. _By the action of copper._ The oxygen present in the air may also be  removed by passing air slowly through a heated tube containing copper.  The copper combines with the oxygen to form copper oxide, which is a  solid. The nitrogen passes on and may be collected over water.         ~Nitrogen obtained from air is not pure.~ Inasmuch as air, in       addition to oxygen and nitrogen, contains small amounts of       other gases, and since the phosphorus as well as the copper       removes only the oxygen, it is evident that the nitrogen       obtained by these methods is never quite pure. About 1% of the       product is composed of other gases, from which it is very       difficult to separate the nitrogen. The impure nitrogen so       obtained may, however, be used for a study of most of the       properties of nitrogen, since these are not materially affected       by the presence of the other gases.    ~Preparation from compounds of nitrogen.~ Pure nitrogen may be obtained  from certain compounds of the element. Thus, if heat is applied to the  compound ammonium nitrite (NH_{4}NO_{2}), the change represented in the  following equation takes place:        NH_{4}NO_{2} = 2H_{2}O + 2N.    ~Physical properties.~ Nitrogen is similar to oxygen and hydrogen in that  it is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas. One liter of nitrogen  weighs 1.2501 g. It is almost insoluble in water. It can be obtained in  the form of a colorless liquid having a boiling point of -195 deg. at  ordinary pressure. At -214 deg. it solidifies.    ~Chemical properties.~ Nitrogen is characterized by its inertness. It is  neither combustible nor a supporter of combustion. At ordinary  temperatures it will not combine directly with any of the elements  except under rare conditions. At higher temperatures it combines with  magnesium, lithium, titanium, and a number of other elements. The  compounds formed are called _nitrides_, just as compounds of an element  with oxygen are called _oxides_. When it is mixed with oxygen and  subjected to the action of electric sparks, the two gases slowly combine  forming oxides of nitrogen. A mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen when  treated similarly forms ammonia, a gaseous compound of nitrogen and  hydrogen. Since we are constantly inhaling nitrogen, it is evident that  it is not poisonous. Nevertheless life would be impossible in an  atmosphere of pure nitrogen on account of the exclusion of the necessary  oxygen.         ~Argon, helium, neon, krypton, xenon.~ These are all rare       elements occurring in the air in very small quantities. Argon,       discovered in 1894, was the first one obtained. Lord Rayleigh,       an English scientist, while engaged in determining the exact       weights of various gases, observed that the nitrogen obtained       from the air is slightly heavier than pure nitrogen obtained       from its compounds. After repeating his experiments many times,       always with the same results, Rayleigh finally concluded that       the nitrogen which he had obtained from the air was not pure,       but was mixed with a small amount of some unknown gas, the       density of which is greater than that of nitrogen. Acting on       this assumption, Rayleigh, together with the English chemist       Ramsay, attempted to separate the nitrogen from the unknown       gas. Knowing that nitrogen would combine with"]]]
