You have no idea how jolly Philip looked in the mail coat and mailed  hood--just like a Crusader.    At the doorway of the dressing-room he met Lucy in a short white dress  and a coronal of pearls round her head. 'I always wanted to be a fairy,'  she said.    'Did you have any one to dress you?' he asked.    'Oh no!' said Lucy calmly. 'I always dress myself.'    'Ladies have the advantage there,' said Double-six, bowing and walking  backwards. 'The banquet is spread.'    It turned out to be spread on three tables, one along each side of a  great room, and one across the top of the room, on a dais--such a table  as that high one at which dons and distinguished strangers sit in the  Halls of colleges.    Mr. Noah was already in his place in the middle of the high table, and  Lucy and Philip now took their places at each side of him. The table was  spread with all sorts of nice-looking foods and plates of a  pink-and-white pattern very familiar to Philip. They were, in fact, as  he soon realised, the painted wooden plates from his sister's old dolls'  house. There was no food just in front of the children, only a great  empty bowl of silver.    Philip fingered his knife and fork; the pattern of those also was  familiar to him. They were indeed the little leaden ones out of the  dolls' house knife-basket of green and silver filagree. He hungrily  waited. Servants in straight yellow dresses and red masks and caps were  beginning to handle the dishes. A dish was handed to him. A beautiful  jelly it looked like. He took up his spoon and was just about to help  himself, when Mr. Noah whispered ardently, 'Don't!' and as Philip looked  at him in astonishment he added, still in a whisper, 'Pretend, can't  you? Have you never had a pretending banquet?' But before he had caught  the whisper, Philip had tried to press the edge of the leaden spoon into  the shape of jelly. And he felt that the jelly was quite hard. He went  through the form of helping himself, but it was just nothing that he put  on his plate. And he saw that Mr. Noah and Lucy and all the other guests  did the same. Presently another dish was handed to him. There was no  changing of plates. 'They _needn't_,' Philip thought bitterly. This time  it was a fat goose, not carved, and now Philip saw that it was attached  to its dish with glue. Then he understood.    (You know the beautiful but uneatable feasts which are given you in a  white cardboard box with blue binding and fine shavings to pack the  dishes and keep them from breaking? I myself, when I was little, had  such a banquet in a box. There were twelve dishes: a ham, brown and  shapely; a pair of roast chickens, also brown and more anatomical than  the ham; a glazed tongue, real tongue-shape, none of your tinned round  mysteries; a dish of sausages; two handsome fish, a little blue,  perhaps; a joint of beef, ribs I think, very red as to the lean and very  white in the fat parts; a pork pie, delicately bronzed like a traveller  in Central Africa. For sweets I had shapes, shapes of beauty, a jelly  and a cream; a Swiss roll too, and a plum pudding; asparagus there was  also and a cauliflower, and a dish of the greenest peas in all this grey  world. This was my banquet outfit. I remember that the woodenness of it  all depressed us wonderfully; the oneness of dish and food baffled all  make-believe. With the point of nurse's scissors we prised the viands  from the platters. But their wooden nature was unconquerable. One could  not pretend to eat a whole chicken any better when it was detached from  its dish, and the sausages were one solid block. And when you licked the  jelly it only tasted of glue and paint. And when we tried to re-roast  the chickens at the nursery grate, they caught fire, and then they smelt  of gasworks and india-rubber. But I am wandering. When you remember the  things that happened when you were a child, you could go on writing  about them for ever. I will put all this in brackets, and then you need  not read it if you don't want to.)    [Illustration: Mr. Noah whispered ardently, 'Don't!']    But those painted wooden foods adhering firmly to their dishes were the  kind of food of which the banquet now offered to Philip and Lucy was  composed. Only they had more dishes than I had. They had as well a  turkey, eight raspberry jam tarts, a pine-apple, a melon, a dish of  oysters in the shell, a piece of boiled bacon and a leg of mutton. But  all were equally wooden and uneatable.    Philip and Lucy, growing hungrier and hungrier, pretended with sinking  hearts to eat and enjoy the wooden feast. Wine was served in those  little goblets which they knew so well, where the double glasses  restrained and contained a red fluid which _looked_ like wine. They did  not want wine, but they were thirsty as well as hungry.    Philip wondered what the waiters were. He had plenty of time to wonder  while the long banquet went on. It was not till he saw a group of them  standing stiffly together at the end of the hall that he knew they must  be the matches with which he had once peopled a city, no other  inhabitants being at hand.    When all the dishes had been handed, speeches happened.    'Friends and fellow-citizens,' Mr. Noah began, and went on to say how  brave and clever Sir Philip was, and how likely it was that he would  turn out to be the Deliverer. Philip did not hear all this speech. He  was thinking of things to eat.    Then every one in the hall stood and shouted, and Philip found that he  was expected to take his turn at speech-making. He stood up trembling  and wretched.    'Friends and fellow-citizens,' he said, 'thank you very much. I want to  be the Deliverer, but I don't know if I can,' and sat down again amid  roars of applause.    Then there was music, from a grated gallery. And then--I cannot begin to  tell you how glad Lucy and Philip were--Mr. Noah said, once more in a  whisper, 'Cheer up! the banquet is over. _Now_ we'll have tea.'    'Tea' turned out to be bread and milk in a very cosy, blue-silk-lined  room opening out of the banqueting-hall. Only Lucy, Philip and Mr. Noah  were present. Bread and milk is very good even when you have to eat it  with the leaden spoons out of the dolls'-house basket. When it was much  later Mr. Noah suddenly said 'good-night,' and in a maze of sleepy  repletion (look that up in the dicker, will you?) the children went to  bed. Philip's bed was of gold with yellow satin curtains, and Lucy's was  made of silver, with curtains of silk that were white. But the metals  and colours made no difference to their deep and dreamless sleep.    And in the morning there was bread and milk again, and the two of them  had it in the blue room without Mr. Noah.    'Well,' said Lucy, looking up from the bowl of white floating cubes, 'do  you think you're getting to like me any better?'    '_No_,' said Philip, brief and stern like the skipper in the song.    'I wish you would,' said Lucy.    'Well, I can't,' said Philip; 'but I do want to say one thing. I'm sorry  I bunked and left you. And I did come back.'    'I know you did,' said Lucy.    'I came back to fetch you,' said Philip, 'and now we'd better get along  home.'    'You've got to do seven deeds of power before you can get home,' said  Lucy.    'Oh! I remember, Perrin told me,' said he.    'Well,' Lucy went on, 'that'll take ages. No one can go out of this  place _twice_ unless he's a King-Deliverer. You've gone out  _once_--without _me_. Before you can go again you've got to do seven  noble deeds.'    'I killed the dragon,' said Philip, modestly proud.    'That's only one,' she said; 'there are six more.' And she ate bread and  milk with firmness.    'Do you like this adventure?' he asked abruptly.    'It's more interesting than anything that ever happened to me,' she  said. 'If you were nice I should like it awfully. But as it is----'    'I'm sorry you don't think I'm nice,' said he.    'Well, what do _you_ think?' she said.    Philip reflected. He did not want not to be nice. None of us do. Though  you might not think it to see how some of us behave. True politeness, he  remembered having been told, consists in showing an interest in other  people's affairs.    'Tell me,' he said, very much wishing to be polite and nice. 'Tell me  what happened after I--after I--after you didn't come down the ladder  with me.'    'Alone and deserted,' Lucy answered promptly, 'my sworn friend having  hooked it and left me, I fell down, and both my hands were full of  gravel, and the fierce soldiery surrounded me.'    'I thought you were coming just behind me,' said Philip, frowning.    'Well, I wasn't.'    'And then.'    'Well, then---- You _were_ silly not to stay. They surrounded me--the  soldiers, I mean--and the captain said, \"Tell me the truth. Are you a  Destroyer or a Deliverer?\" So, of course, I said I wasn't a destroyer,  whatever I was; and then they took me to the palace and said I could be  a Princess till the Deliverer King turned up. They said,' she giggled  gaily, 'that my hair was the hair of a Deliverer and not of a Destroyer,  and I've been most awfully happy ever since. Have you?'    'No,' said Philip, remembering the miserable feeling of having been a  coward and a sneak that had come upon him when he found that he had  saved his own skin and left Lucy alone in an unknown and dangerous  world; 'not exactly happy, I shouldn't call it.'    'It's beautiful being a Princess,' said Lucy. 'I wonder what your next  noble deed will be. I wonder whether I could help you with it?' She  looked wistfully at him.    'If I'm going to do noble deeds I'll do them. I don't want any help,  thank you, especially from girls,' he answered.    'I wish you did,' said Lucy, and finished her bread and milk.    Philip's bowl also was empty. He stretched arms and legs and neck.    'It is rum,' he said; 'before this began"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2064"],[0,"A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (#15)"],[1," and went  away without knowing how far it was carried.  For this omission we shall  be blamed, as we perhaps have blamed other travellers; but the day was  rainy, and the ground was damp.  We had with us neither spades nor  pickaxes, and if love of ease surmounted our desire of knowledge, the  offence has not the invidiousness of singularity.    Edifices, either standing or ruined, are the chief records of an  illiterate nation.  In some part of this journey, at no great distance  from our way, stood a shattered fortress, of which the learned minister,  to whose communication we are much indebted, gave us an account.    Those, said he, are the walls of a place of refuge, built in the time of  James the Sixth, by Hugh Macdonald, who was next heir to the dignity and  fortune of his chief.  Hugh, being so near his wish, was impatient of  delay; and had art and influence sufficient to engage several gentlemen  in a plot against the Laird's life.  Something must be stipulated on both  sides; for they would not dip their hands in blood merely for Hugh's  advancement.  The compact was formerly written, signed by the  conspirators, and placed in the hands of one Macleod.    It happened that Macleod had sold some cattle to a drover, who, not  having ready money, gave him a bond for payment.  The debt was  discharged, and the bond re-demanded; which Macleod, who could not read,  intending to put into his hands, gave him the conspiracy.  The drover,  when he had read the paper, delivered it privately to Macdonald; who,  being thus informed of his danger, called his friends together, and  provided for his safety.  He made a public feast, and inviting Hugh  Macdonald and his confederates, placed each of them at the table between  two men of known fidelity.  The compact of conspiracy was then shewn, and  every man confronted with his own name.  Macdonald acted with great  moderation.  He upbraided Hugh, both with disloyalty and ingratitude; but  told the rest, that he considered them as men deluded and misinformed.  Hugh was sworn to fidelity, and dismissed with his companions; but he was  not generous enough to be reclaimed by lenity; and finding no longer any  countenance among the gentlemen, endeavoured to execute the same design  by meaner hands.  In this practice he was detected, taken to Macdonald's  castle, and imprisoned in the dungeon.  When he was hungry, they let down  a plentiful meal of salted meat; and when, after his repast, he called  for drink, conveyed to him a covered cup, which, when he lifted the lid,  he found empty.  From that time they visited him no more, but left him to  perish in solitude and darkness.    We were then told of a cavern by the sea-side, remarkable for the  powerful reverberation of sounds.  After dinner we took a boat, to  explore this curious cavity.  The boatmen, who seemed to be of a rank  above that of common drudges, inquired who the strangers were, and being  told we came one from Scotland, and the other from England, asked if the  Englishman could recount a long genealogy.  What answer was given them,  the conversation being in Erse, I was not much inclined to examine.    They expected no good event of the voyage; for one of them declared that  he heard the cry of an English ghost.  This omen I was not told till  after our return, and therefore cannot claim the dignity of despising it.    The sea was smooth.  We never left the shore, and came without any  disaster to the cavern, which we found rugged and misshapen, about one  hundred and eighty feet long, thirty wide in the broadest part, and in  the loftiest, as we guessed, about thirty high.  It was now dry, but at  high water the sea rises in it near six feet.  Here I saw what I had  never seen before, limpets and mussels in their natural state.  But, as a  new testimony to the veracity of common fame, here was no echo to be  heard.    We then walked through a natural arch in the rock, which might have  pleased us by its novelty, had the stones, which incumbered our feet,  given us leisure to consider it.  We were shown the gummy seed of the  kelp, that fastens itself to a stone, from which it grows into a strong  stalk.    In our return, we found a little boy upon the point of rock, catching  with his angle, a supper for the family.  We rowed up to him, and  borrowed his rod, with which Mr. Boswell caught a cuddy.    The cuddy is a fish of which I know not the philosophical name.  It is  not much bigger than a gudgeon, but is of great use in these Islands, as  it affords the lower people both food, and oil for their lamps.  Cuddies  are so abundant, at sometimes of the year, that they are caught like  whitebait in the Thames, only by dipping a basket and drawing it back.    If it were always practicable to fish, these Islands could never be in  much danger from famine; but unhappily in the winter, when other  provision fails, the seas are commonly too rough for nets, or boats.          TALISKER IN SKY      From Ulinish, our next stage was to Talisker, the house of colonel  Macleod, an officer in the Dutch service, who, in this time of universal  peace, has for several years been permitted to be absent from his  regiment.  Having been bred to physick, he is consequently a scholar, and  his lady, by accompanying him in his different places of residence, is  become skilful in several languages.  Talisker is the place beyond all  that I have seen, from which the gay and the jovial seem utterly  excluded; and where the hermit might expect to grow old in meditation,  without possibility of disturbance or interruption.  It is situated very  near the sea, but upon a coast where no vessel lands but when it is  driven by a tempest on the rocks.  Towards the land are lofty hills  streaming with waterfalls.  The garden is sheltered by firs or pines,  which grow there so prosperously, that some, which the present inhabitant  planted, are very high and thick.    At this place we very happily met Mr. Donald Maclean, a young gentleman,  the eldest son of the Laird of Col, heir to a very great extent of land,  and so desirous of improving his inheritance, that he spent a  considerable time among the farmers of Hertfordshire, and Hampshire, to  learn their practice.  He worked with his own hands at the principal  operations of agriculture, that he might not deceive himself by a false  opinion of skill, which, if he should find it deficient at home, he had  no means of completing.  If the world has agreed to praise the travels  and manual labours of the Czar of Muscovy, let Col have his share of the  like applause, in the proportion of his dominions to the empire of  Russia.    This young gentleman was sporting in the mountains of Sky, and when he  was weary with following his game, repaired for lodging to Talisker.  At  night he missed one of his dogs, and when he went to seek him in the  morning, found two eagles feeding on his carcass.    Col, for he must be named by his possessions, hearing that our intention  was to visit Jona, offered to conduct us to his chief, Sir Allan Maclean,  who lived in the isle of Inch Kenneth, and would readily find us a  convenient passage.  From this time was formed an acquaintance, which  being begun by kindness, was accidentally continued by constraint; we  derived much pleasure from it, and I hope have given him no reason to  repent it.    The weather was now almost one continued storm, and we were to snatch  some happy intermission to be conveyed to Mull, the third Island of the  Hebrides, lying about a degree south of Sky, whence we might easily find  our way to Inch Kenneth, where Sir Allan Maclean resided, and afterward  to Jona.    For this purpose, the most commodious station that we could take was  Armidel, which Sir Alexander Macdonald had now left to a gentleman, who  lived there as his factor or steward.    In our way to Armidel was Coriatachan, where we had already been, and to  which therefore we were very willing to return.  We staid however so long  at Talisker, that a great part of our journey was performed in the gloom  of the evening.  In travelling even thus almost without light thro' naked  solitude, when there is a guide whose conduct may be trusted, a mind not  naturally too much disposed to fear, may preserve some degree of  cheerfulness; but what must be the solicitude of him who should be  wandering, among the craggs and hollows, benighted, ignorant, and alone?    The fictions of the Gothick romances were not so remote from credibility  as they are now thought.  In the full prevalence of the feudal  institution, when violence desolated the world, and every baron lived in  a fortress, forests and castles were regularly succeeded by each other,  and the adventurer might very suddenly pass from the gloom of woods, or  the ruggedness of moors, to seats of plenty, gaiety, and magnificence.  Whatever is imaged in the wildest tale, if giants, dragons, and  enchantment be excepted, would be felt by him, who, wandering in the  mountains without a guide, or upon the sea without a pilot, should be  carried amidst his terror and uncertainty, to the hospitality and  elegance of Raasay or Dunvegan.    To Coriatachan at last we came, and found ourselves welcomed as before.  Here we staid two days, and made such inquiries as curiosity suggested.  The house was filled with company, among whom Mr. Macpherson and his  sister distinguished themselves by their politeness and accomplishments.  By him we were invited to Ostig, a house not far from Armidel, where we  might easily hear of a boat, when the weather would suffer us to leave  the Island.          OSTIG IN SKY      At Ostig, of which Mr. Macpherson is minister, we were entertained for  some days, then removed to Armidel, where we finished our observations on  the island of Sky.    As this Island lies in the fifty-seventh degree, the air cannot be  supposed to have much warmth.  The long continuance of the sun above the  horizon, does"]]]
