With a cry, that one flung itself at its companion in the  hunt, and they tangled in a body-to-body battle terrible in its utter  ferocity. Vye edged along the cliff determined to reach the cave and  Hume. And the two blue things seemed intent on finishing each other  off.    The one from the wood was done, the fangs of the other ripping out its  throat. Tearing viciously the victor made sure of its kill, then its  seared head came up, swung about to face Vye. He guessed it was aware  of his movements whether it could see or not.    But he was not prepared for the speed of its attacking lunge.  Heretofore the creatures had given the impression of brute strength  rather than agility. And he had been almost fatally deceived. He  jumped backwards, knowing he must elude that attack, for he could not  survive hand-to-hand combat with the alien thing.    There was a moment of dazed disorientation, a weird sensation of  falling through unstable space in which there had never been and never  would be firm footing again. He was rolling across rock--outside the  curtain of the gap.    He sat up, the feeling of being adrift in unmeasurable nothingness  making him sick, to watch mistily as the blue beast came to a halt.  Whimpering it turned, but before it reached the level of the woods, it  sagged to its knees, fell face forward and was still, a destructive  machine no longer controlled by life.    Vye tried to understand what had happened. He had somehow broken  through that barrier which made the valley a prison. For a moment all  that mattered was his freedom. Then he looked apprehensively behind  him along the road to the open, more than half expecting to see a  gathering of the globes, or of the less impressive lowland beasts that  acted as herders. But there was nothing.    Freedom! He dragged himself to his feet. Free to go! He slipped Hume's  ray tube back into his belt. Hume was still in the valley!    Vye rubbed his shaking hands across his face. Through the barrier and  free--but Hume was back there, without a weapon, defenseless against  any questing beast able to nose him out. Sickly, without water and  protection, he was a dead man even while he still breathed.    Keeping one hand against the wall of the gap in support, Vye started  to walk, not out of the gap towards the distant lowlands, but back  into the valley, forcing himself to that by his will alone and  screaming inside against such suicidal folly. He put out his hand  tentatively when he reached the two points of rock where that curtain  had hung. There was no obstruction--the barrier was down! He must get  back to Hume.    Still keeping his wall hold, Vye lurched through the gate, was once  more in the valley. He stood swaying, listening. But once again there  was silence, not even the wind moved through trees or bushes. Placing  one foot carefully before the other he went on towards Hume's cave.  The haze which had clouded his thinking processes since that first  morning's awakening in this bowl was gone now. Except for the physical  weakness that weighted his body, he felt once more entirely alive and  alert.    Wriggling in the cave's entrance was the Hunter. He had freed the  bonds Vye had put on his legs, but his hands were still tied. His  face, grimy, sweat-covered, was turned up to the sunlight, and his  eyes were again bright with reason.    Vye found the strength to run the last few feet between them. He was  fumbling with those ties about Hume's wrists as he blurted out the  news. The barrier was out--they could go.    Then he was bringing one of those precious bulbs, raising it to Hume's  eager mouth, squeezing a portion of its contents between the man's  cracked and bleeding lips.    Somehow they made that trip back to the valley gate. When they saw  their goal, Hume broke from Vye's hold, tottered forward with a cry  not far removed from a sob. He rebounded to slip full length to the  ground and lie there. Sobbing dryly, his gaunt face, eyes closed,  turned up to the sky. The trap had snapped shut once again.    \"Why--why?\" Vye found he was repeating the same words over and over,  his gaze blank, unfocussed, yet turned to the woods of the lake.    \"Tell me what happened again.\"    Vye's head came around. Hume had pulled himself up so that his  shoulders rested against the rock wall. His plasta-hand was out-flung,  slipping up and down what seemed empty air, but which was the barrier  against freedom. And now his eyes seemed entirely sane.    Slowly, hesitating between words, Vye went over the full account of  his visit to the lake, his retreat before the beasts, his fortunate  stumble through the gap.    \"But you came back.\"    Vye flushed. He was not going to try to explain that. Instead he said:    \"If it went away once, it can again.\"    Hume did not press the subject of his return. Rather he fastened upon  the end of that action with the wounded beast, made Vye go through it  verbally a third time.    \"There is just this,\" he said when the other was done. \"When you fell  you were not thinking of the barrier at all--and your wits were  working again. You had come out of the daze we both had.\"    Vye tried to remember, decided that the Hunter was correct. He had  been trying to elude the charge of the beast, only, fear and that  desperate desire had occupied his mind at that moment. But what did  that signify?    To test just what he did not know, he crawled now to Hume's side, put  up his own hand to the space where the plasta-flesh palm slid back and  forth on nothingness. But he almost fell on his face, forward into the  gap. Where he had been expecting the resistance of the unseen curtain  there had been nothing at all! He turned to Hume with the expression  of a man who had been stunned by an unexpected blow.          11      \"It is open for you!\" Hume broke the quiet first. His eyes were very  bleak in his bony face.    Vye stood up, took one step and was on the other side of the curtain  where Hume's hand still found substance. He came back with the same  lack of hindrance. Yes, to him there was no longer a barrier. But  why--why him when Hume was still a prisoner?    The Hunter raised his head so his eyes could meet Vye's with the  authority of an order. \"Go, get away while you can!\"    Instead Vye dropped down beside the other. \"Why?\" he asked baldly. And  then the most obvious of all answers came.    He glanced at Hume. The Hunter's head lolled back against the rock  which supported him, his eyes were closed now, and he had the look of  a man who had been driven to the edge of endurance and was now willing  to relinquish his grip and let go.    Deliberately Vye brought up his right hand, balled his fingers into a  fist. And just as deliberately he struck home, square on the point of  that defenseless chin. Hume sagged, would have slipped down the  surface of the rock had Vye's hands not caught in his armpits.    Since he had not the strength left to get to his feet with such a  burden, Vye crawled, dragging the inert body of the Hunter with him.  And this time, as he had hoped, there was no resistance at the gap.  Unconscious, Hume was able to cross the barrier. Vye stretched him as  comfortably flat as he could, used a portion of their water on his  face until he moaned, muttered, and raised his hand feebly to his  head.    Then those gray eyes opened, focussed on Vye.    \"What--\"    \"We're both through now, both of us!\" The younger man saw Hume glance  around him with waking belief.    \"But how--?\"    \"I knocked you out, that's how,\" Vye returned.    \"Knocked me out? I crossed when I was unconscious!\" Hume's voice  steadied, strengthened. \"Let me see!\" He rolled over on his side,  threw out his arm, and this time the hand found no wall. For him, too,  the barrier was gone.    \"Once through, you are free,\" he added wonderingly. \"Maybe they never  foresaw any escapes.\" He struggled up, sitting with his hands hanging  loosely between his knees.    Vye turned his head, looked down the trail. The length of distance  lying between them and the safari camp now faced them with a new  problem. Neither of them could make that trek on foot.    \"We're out, but we aren't back--yet,\" Hume echoed his thought.    \"I was wondering, if _this_ door is open--\" Vye began.    \"The flitter!\" Again Hume's mind matched his. \"Yes, if those globes  aren't hanging around just waiting for us to try.\"    \"They might act only to get us here, not to keep us once we're in.\"  That might be wishful thinking, they wouldn't know until they tried to  prove it.    \"Give me a hand.\" Hume held out his own, let Vye pull him to his feet.  Weak as he was, he was clear-eyed, plainly clear-headed once more.  \"Let's go!\"    Together they went back through the gap, then tested the absence of  the barrier once more, to make sure. Hume laughed. \"At least the front  door remains open, even if we find the back one closed.\"    Vye left him sitting by that entrance while he made a quick trip to  the cave to pick up the small pack of supplies left them. When he  returned they crammed tablets into their mouths, drank feverishly of  the lake water, and, with the stimulation of the new energy, set off  along the cliff face.    \"This wall in the lake,\" Hume asked suddenly, \"you are sure it is  artificial?\"    \"Runs too straight to be anything else, and those projections are  evenly spaced. I don't see how it could be natural.\"    \"We'll have to be sure.\"    Vye thought of that attacking water creature. \"No diving in there,\" he  protested. Hume smiled, a stretch of skin far too tight over his jaw  now.    \"Not us, at least not us now,\" he agreed. \"But the Guild will send  another survey.\"    \"What could be the reason for all this?\" Vye helped his companion over  the loose debris of a cliff slide.    \"Information.\"    \"What?\"    \"Someone--or something--picked"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19098"],[0,"Christmas in Ritual and Tradition, Christian and Pagan (#15)"],[1,"y,      By Thy presence, Christ our God,      Thou hast shined a Light on us.

God before all worlds, have mercy upon us!\"{27}    A beautiful rite called the \"Peace of God\" is performed in Slavonic  churches at the end of the \"Liturgy\" or Mass on Christmas morning--the  people kiss one another on both cheeks, saying, \"Christ is born!\" To this  the answer is made, \"Of a truth He is born!\" and the kisses are returned.  This is repeated till everyone has kissed and been kissed by all  present.{28}           *       *       *       *       *    We must pass rapidly over the feasts of saints within the Octave of the  western Christmas, St. Stephen (December 26), St. John the Evangelist  (December 27), the Holy Innocents (December 28), and St. Sylvester  (December 31). None of these, except the feast of the Holy Innocents,  have any special connection with the Nativity or the Infancy, and the  popular customs connected with them will come up for consideration in our  Second Part.    The commemoration of the Circumcision (\"when eight days were accomplished  for the circumcising of the child\") falls naturally on January 1, the  Octave of Christmas. It is not of Roman origin, and was not observed in  Rome until it had long been established in the Byzantine and Gallican  Churches.{29} In Gaul, as is shown by a decree of the Council of Tours  in 567, a solemn fast was held on the Circumcision and the two days  following it, in order to turn away the faithful from the pagan  festivities of the Kalends.{30}    The feast of the Epiphany on January 6, as we have seen, is in the  eastern Church a commemoration of the Baptism of Christ. In the West it  has become primarily the festival of the adoration |102| of the Magi,  the manifestation of Christ to the Gentiles. Still in the Roman offices  many traces of the baptismal commemoration remain, and the memory of yet  another manifestation of Christ's glory appears in the antiphon at  \"Magnificat\" at the Second Vespers of the feast:--        \"We keep holy a day adorned by three wonders: to-day a star led the      Magi to the manger; to-day at the marriage water was made wine;      to-day for our salvation Christ was pleased to be baptized of John in      Jordan. Alleluia.\"    On the Octave of the Epiphany at Matins the Baptism is the central idea,  and the Gospel at Mass bears on the same subject. In Rome itself even the  Blessing of the Waters, the distinctive ceremony of the eastern Epiphany  rite, is performed in certain churches according to a Latin ritual.{31}  At Sant' Andrea della Valle, Rome, during the Octave of the Epiphany a  Solemn Mass is celebrated every morning in Latin, and afterwards, on each  of the days from January 7-13, there follows a Mass according to one of  the eastern rites: Greco-Slav, Armenian, Chaldean, Coptic,  Greco-Ruthenian, Greco-Melchite, and Greek.{32} It is a week of great  opportunities for the liturgiologist and the lover of strange ceremonial.    The Blessing of the Waters is an important event in all countries where  the Greek Church prevails. In Greece the \"Great Blessing,\" as it is  called, is performed in various ways according to the locality; sometimes  the sea is blessed, sometimes a river or reservoir, sometimes merely  water in a church. In seaport towns, where the people depend on the water  for their living, the celebration has much pomp and elaborateness. At the  Piraeus enormous and enthusiastic crowds gather, and there is a solemn  procession of the bishop and clergy to the harbour, where the bishop  throws a little wooden cross, held by a long blue ribbon, into the water,  withdraws it dripping wet, and sprinkles the bystanders. This is done  three times. At Nauplia and other places a curious custom prevails: the  archbishop throws a wooden cross into the waters of the harbour, and the  fishermen |103| of the place dive in after it and struggle for its  possession; he who wins it has the right of visiting all the houses of  the town and levying a collection, which often brings in a large sum. In  Samos all the women send to the church a vessel full of water to be  blessed by the priest; with this water the fields and the trees are  sprinkled.{33}    The sense attached to the ceremony by the Church is shown in this  prayer:--        \"Thou didst sanctify the streams of Jordan by sending from Heaven Thy      Holy Spirit, and by breaking the heads of the dragons lurking there.      Therefore, O King, Lover of men, be Thou Thyself present also now by      the visitation of Thy Holy Spirit, and sanctify this water. Give also      to it the grace of ransom, the blessing of Jordan: make it a fountain      of incorruption; a gift of sanctification; a washing away of sins; a      warding off of diseases; destruction to demons; repulsion to the      hostile powers; filled with angelic strength; that all who take and      receive of it may have it for purification of souls and bodies, for      healing of sicknesses, for sanctification of houses, and meet for      every need.\"{34}    Though for the Church the immersion of the cross represents the Baptism  of Christ, and the blessings springing from that event are supposed to be  carried to the people by the sprinkling with the water, it is held by  some students that the whole practice is a Christianization of a  primitive rain-charm--a piece of sympathetic magic intended to produce  rain by imitating the drenching which it gives. An Epiphany song from  Imbros connects the blessing of rain with the Baptism of Christ, and  another tells how at the river Jordan \"a dove came down, white and  feathery, and with its wings opened; it sent rain down on the Lord, and  again it rained and rained on our Lady, and again it rained and rained on  its wings.\"{35}    The Blessing of the Waters is performed in the Greek church of St.  Sophia, Bayswater, London, on the morning of the Epiphany, which, through  the difference between the old and new \"styles,\" falls on our 19th of  January. All is done within the church; the water to be blessed is placed  on a table under |104| the dome, and is sanctified by the immersion of  a small cross; afterwards it is sprinkled on everyone present, and some  is taken home by the faithful in little vessels.{36}    In Moscow and St. Petersburg the Blessing is a function of great  magnificence, but it is perhaps even more interesting as performed in  Russian country places. Whatever may be the orthodox significance of the  rite, to the country people it is the chasing away of \"forest demons,  sprites, and fairies, once the gods the peasants worshipped, but now  dethroned from their high estate,\" who in the long dark winter nights  bewitch and vex the sons of men. A vivid and imaginative account of the  ceremony and its meaning to the peasants is given by Mr. F. H. E. Palmer  in his \"Russian Life in Town and Country.\" The district in which he  witnessed it was one of forests and of lakes frozen in winter. On one of  these lakes had been erected \"a huge cross, constructed of blocks of ice,  that glittered like diamonds in the brilliant winter sunlight.... At  length, far away could be heard the sound of human voices, singing a  strange, wild melody. Presently there was a movement in the snow among  the trees, and waving banners appeared as a procession approached, headed  by the pope in his vestments, and surrounded by the village dignitaries,  venerable, grey-bearded patriarchs.\" A wide space in the procession was  left for \"a strange and motley band of gnomes and sprites, fairies and  wood-nymphs,\" who, as the peasants believed, had been caught by the holy  singing and the sacred sign on the waving banner. The chanting still went  on as the crowd formed a circle around the glittering cross, and all  looked on with awe while half a dozen peasants with their axes cut a  large hole in the ice. \"And now the priest's voice is heard, deep and  sonorous, as he pronounces the words of doom. Alas for the poor sprites!  Into that yawning chasm they must leap, and sink deep, deep below the  surface of that ice-cold water.\"{37}           *       *       *       *       *    Following these eastern Epiphany rites we have wandered far from the  cycle of ideas generally associated with Christmas. We |105| must now  pass to those popular devotions to the Christ Child which, though they  form no part of the Church's liturgy, she has permitted and encouraged.  It is in the West that we shall find them; the Latin Church, as we have  seen, makes far more of Christmas than the Greek.    Rome is often condemned for using in her liturgy the dead language of  Latin, but it must not be forgotten that in every country she offers to  the faithful a rich store of devotional literature in their own tongue,  and that, supplementary to the liturgical offices, there is much public  prayer and praise in the vernacular. Nor, in that which appeals to the  eye, does she limit herself to the mysterious symbolism of the sacraments  and the ritual which surrounds them; she gives to the people concrete,  pictorial images to quicken their faith. How ritual grew in mediaeval  times into full-fledged drama we shall see in the next chapter; here let  us consider that cult of the Christ Child in which the scene of Bethlehem "]]]
