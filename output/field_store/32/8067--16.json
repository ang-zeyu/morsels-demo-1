It appears to have been at that time under the undisputed rule of a  certain Sharduris, son of Lutipri, and subsequently, about the middle  of Assur-nazir-pal's reign, to have passed into the hands of Arame, who  styled himself King of Nairi, and whose ambition may have caused those  revolts which forced Assur-nazir-pal to take up arms in the eighteenth  year of his reign. On this occasion the Assyrians again confined  themselves to the chastisement of their own vassals, and checked  their advance as soon as they approached Urartu. Their success was but  temporary; hardly had they withdrawn from the neighbourhood, when the  disturbances were renewed with even greater violence, very probably  at the instigation of Arame. Shalmaneser III. found matters in a very  unsatisfactory state both on the west and south of Lake Van: some of the  peoples who had been subject to his father--the Khubushkia, the pastoral  tribes of the Gordaean mountains, and the Aramaeans of the Euphrates--had  transferred their allegiance elsewhere. He immediately took measures to  recall them to a sense of their duty, and set out from Calah only a few  days after succeeding to the crown. He marched at first in an easterly  direction, and, crossing the pass of Simisi, burnt the city of Aridi,  thus proving that he was fully prepared to treat rebels after the  same fashion as his father. The lesson had immediate effect. All  the neighbouring tribes, Khargaeans, Simisaeans, the people of Simira,  Sirisha, and Ulmania, hastened to pay him homage even before he had  struck his camp near Aridi. Hurrying across country by the shortest  route, which entailed the making of roads to enable his chariots and  cavalry to follow him, he fell upon Khubushkia, and reduced a hundred  towns to ashes, pursuing the king Kakia into the depths of the forest,  and forcing him to an unconditional surrender. Ascending thence to  Shugunia, a dependency of Arame's, he laid the principality waste, in  spite of the desperate resistance made on their mountain slopes by the  inhabitants; then proceeding to Lake Van, he performed the ceremonial  rites incumbent on an Assyrian king whenever he stood for the first time  on the shores of a new sea. He washed his weapons in the waters, offered  a sacrifice to the gods, casting some portions of the victim into  the lake, and before leaving carved his own image on the surface of a  commanding rock. On his homeward march he received tribute from Gilzan.  This expedition was but the prelude of further successes. After a few  weeks' repose at Nineveh, he again set out to make his authority felt in  the western portions of his dominions.    [Illustration: 093.jpg THE PEOPLE OF SHUGUNIA FIGHTING AGAINST THE  ASSYRIANS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from one of the bas-reliefs on the       bronze gates of Balawat.    Akhuni, chief of Bit-Adini, whose position was the first to be menaced,  had formed a league with the chiefs of all the cities which had formerly  bowed before Assur-nazir-pal's victorious arms, Gurgum, Samalla, Kui,  the Patina, Car-chemish, and the Khati. Shalmaneser seized Lalati* and  Burmarana, two of Akhuni's towns, drove him across the Euphrates, and  following close on his heels, collected as he passed the tribute of  Gurgum, and fell upon Samalla.         * Lalati is probably the Lulati of the Egyptians. The modern       site is not known, nor is that of Burmarana.    Under the walls of Lutibu he overthrew the combined forces of Adini,  Samalla, and the Patina, and raised a trophy to commemorate his victory  at the sources of the Saluara; then turning sharply to the south, he  crossed the Orontes in pursuit of Shapalulme, King of the Patina.

Not far from Alizir he encountered a fresh army raised by Akhuni and  the King of Samalla, with contingents from Carchemish, Kui, Cilicia, and  Iasbuki:* having routed it, he burnt the fortresses of Shapalulme, and  after occupying himself by cutting down cedars and cypress trees on the  Amanos in the province of Atalur, he left a triumphal stele engraved on  the mountain-side.         * The country of Iasbuki is represented by Ishbak, a son of       Abraham and Keturah, mentioned in Genesis (xxv. 2) in       connection with Shuah.    [Illustration: 094b.jpg SACRIFICE OFFERED BY SHALMANESER III.]    [Illustration: 095.jpg COSTUMES FOUND IN THE FIFTH TOMB]    Next turning eastwards, he received the homage offered with alacrity by  the towns of Taia, Khazazu, Nulia, and Butamu, and, with a final tribute  from Agusi, he returned in triumph to Nineveh. The motley train which  accompanied, him showed by its variety the immense extent of country  he had traversed during this first campaign. Among the prisoners were  representatives of widely different races;--Khati with long robes and  cumbrous head-dresses, following naked mountaineers from Shugunia, who  marched with yokes on their necks, and wore those close-fitting helmets  with short crests which have such a strangely modern look on the  Assyrian bas-reliefs. The actual results of the campaign were, perhaps,  hardly commensurate with the energy expended. This expedition from  east to west had certainly inflicted considerable losses on the rebels  against whom it had been directed; it had cost them dearly in men  and cattle, and booty of all kinds, and had extorted from them a  considerable amount of tribute, but they remained, notwithstanding,  still unsubdued. As soon as the Assyrian troops had quitted their  neighbourhood, they flattered themselves they were safe from further  attack. No doubt they thought that a show of submission would satisfy  the new invader, as it had satisfied his father; but Shalmaneser was not  disposed to rest content with this nominal dependence. He intended to  exercise effective control over all the states won by his sword, and the  proof of their subjection was to be the regular payment of tribute  and fulfilment of other obligations to their suzerain. Year by year he  unfailingly enforced his rights, till the subject states were obliged to  acknowledge their master and resign themselves to servitude.    The narrative of his reiterated efforts is a monotonous one. The king  advanced against Adini in the spring of 859 B.C., defeated Akhuni near  Tul-barsip, transported his victorious regiments across the Euphrates  on rafts of skins, seized Surunu, Paripa, and Dabigu* besides six  fortresses and two hundred villages, and then advanced into the  territory of Carchemish, which he proceeded to treat with such severity  that the other Hittite chiefs hastened to avert a similar fate by  tendering their submission.         * Shalmaneser crossed the Euphrates near Tul-barsip, which       would lead him into the country between Birejik, Rum-kaleh,       and Aintab, and it is in that district that we must look for       the towns subject to Akhuni. Dabigu, I consider, corresponds       to Dehbek on Rey's map, a little to the north-east of       Aintab; the sites of Paripa and Surunu are unknown.    The very enumeration of their offerings proves not only their wealth,  but the terror inspired by the advancing Assyrian host: Shapalulme of  the Patina, for instance, yielded up three talents of gold, a hundred  talents of silver, three hundred talents of copper, and three hundred  of iron, and paid in addition to this an annual tribute of one talent  of silver, two talents of purple, and two hundred great beams of  cedar-wood. Samalla, Agusi, and Kummukh were each laid under tribute in  proportion to their resources, but their surrender did not necessarily  lead to that of Adini. Akhuni realised that, situated as he was on the  very borders of Assyrian territory, there was no longer a chance of  his preserving his semi-independence, as was the case with his kinsfolk  beyond the Euphrates; proximity to the capital would involve a stricter  servitude, which would soon reduce him from the condition of a vassal to  that of a subject, and make him merely a governor where he had hitherto  reigned as king. Abandoned by the Khati, he sought allies further north,  and entered into a league with the tribes of Nairi and Urartu. When, in  858 B.C., Shalmaneser III. forced an entrance into Tul-barsip, and drove  back what was left of the garrison on the right bank of the Euphrates,  a sudden movement of Arame obliged him to let the prey escape from  his grasp. Rapidly fortifying Tul-barsip, Nappigi, Aligu, Pitru, and  Mutkinu, and garrisoning them with loyal troops to command the fords  of the river, as his ancestor Shalmaneser I. had done six centuries  before,* he then re-entered Nairi by way of Bit-Zamani, devastated  Inziti with fire and sword, forced a road through to the banks of the  Arzania, pillaged Sukhmi and Dayaini, and appeared under the walls of  Arzashkun.         * Pitru, the Pethor of the Bible (Numb. xxii. 5), is       situated near the confluence of the Sajur and the Euphrates,       somewhere near the encampment called Osheriyeh by Sachau.       Mutkinu was on the other bank, perhaps at Kharbet-Beddai,       nearly opposite Pitru. Nappigi was on the left bank of the       Euphrates, which excludes its identification with Mabog-       Hierapolis, as proposed by Hommel; Nabigath, mentioned by       Tomkins, is too far east. Nappigi and Aligu must both be       sought in the district between the Euphrates and the town of       Saruj.    Arame withdrew to Mount Adduri and awaited his attack in an almost  impregnable position; he was nevertheless defeated: 3400 of his soldiers  fell on the field of battle; his camp, his treasures, his chariots, and  all his baggage passed into the hands of the conqueror, and he himself  barely escaped with his life. Shalmaneser ravaged the country \"as a  savage "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17328"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 8 (of 12) (#15)"],[1,"a pine tree:  thenceforward her priests made the sacrifice of their virility with  their own hands at the moment of dedicating themselves to the service of  the goddess.*         * Nana was made out to be the daughter of the river       Sangarios. She is said to have conceived Atys by placing in       her bosom the fruit of an almond tree which sprang from the       hermaphrodite Agdistis. This was the form--extremely ancient       in its main features--in which the legend was preserved at       Pessinus.    [Illustration: 098.jpg THE MOTHER-GODDESS AND ATYS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Chantre. One of       the bas-reliefs at Iasilikiaia, to which we shall have       occasion to refer later on in Chapter III. of the present       volume.    The gods introduced from Thrace by the Phrygians showed a close affinity  with those of the purely Asianic peoples. Precedence was universally  given to a celestial divinity named Bagaios, Lord of the Oak, perhaps  because he was worshipped under a gigantic sacred oak; he was king of  gods and men, then-father,* lord of the thunder and the lightning, the  warrior who charges in his chariot.         * In this capacity he bore the surname Papas.    He, doubtless, allowed a queen-regent of the earth to share his throne,*  but Sauazios, another, and, at first, less venerable deity had thrown  this august pair into the shade.         * The existence of such a goddess may be deduced from the       passage in which Dionysius of Halicarnassus states that       Manes, first king of the Phrygians, was the son of Zeus and       Demeter.    [Illustration: 099.jpg THE GOD MEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUN AND OTHER  DEITIES]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Perdrizet. The       last figure on the left is the god Men; the Sun overlooks       all the rest, and a god bearing an axe occupies the extreme       right of the picture. The shapes of these ancient aboriginal       deities have been modified by the influence of Graeco-Roman       syncretism, and I merely give these figures, as I do many       others, for lack of better representations.    The Greeks, finding this Sauazios at the head of the Phrygian Pantheon,  identified him with their Zeus, or, less frequently, with the Sun; he  was really a variant of their Dionysos. He became torpid in the autumn,  and slept a death-like sleep all through the winter; but no sooner did  he feel the warmth of the first breath of spring, than he again awoke,  glowing with youth, and revelled during his summer in the heart of the  forest or on the mountain-side, leading a life of riot and intoxication,  guarded by a band of Sauades, spirits of the springs and streams, the  Sileni of Greek mythology. The resemblances detected by the new-comers  between the orgies of Thrace and those of Asia quickly led to confusion  between the different dogmas and divinities. The Phrygians adopted Ma,  and made her their queen, the Cybele who dwells in the hills, and takes  her title from the mountain-tops which she inhabits--Dindymene on Mount  Dindymus, Sipylene on Mount Sipylus. She is always the earth, but the  earth untilled, and is seated in the midst of lions, or borne through  her domain in a car drawn by lions, accompanied by a troop of Corybantes  with dishevelled locks. Sauazios, identified with the Asianic Atys,  became her lover and her priest, and Men, transformed by popular  etymology into Manes, the good and beautiful, was looked upon as the  giver of good luck, who protects men after death as well as in life.  This religion, evolved from so many diverse elements, possessed a  character of sombre poetry and sensual fanaticism which appealed  strongly to the Greek imagination: they quickly adopted even its most  barbarous mysteries, those celebrated in honour of the goddess and Atys,  or of Sauazios. They tell us but little of the inner significance of  the symbols and doctrines taught by its votaries, but have frequently  described its outward manifestations. These consisted of aimless  wanderings through the forests, in which the priest, incarnate  representative of his god, led after him the ministers of the temple,  who were identified with the Sauades and nymphs of the heavenly host.  Men heard them passing in the night, heralded by the piercing notes  of the flute provoking to frenzy, and by the clash of brazen cymbals,  accompanied by the din of uproarious ecstasy: these sounds were broken  at intervals by the bellowing of bulls and the roll of drums, like the  rambling of subterranean thunder.    [Illustration: 101.jpg MIDAS OF PHRYGIA]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a specimen in the _Cabinet des       Medailles_. It is a bronze coin from Prymnessos in Phrygia,       belonging to the imperial epoch.    A Midas followed a Gordios, and a Gordios a Midas, in alternate  succession, and under their rule the Phrygian empire enjoyed a period  of prosperous obscurity. Lydia led an uneventful existence beside them,  under dynasties which have received merely passing notice at the hands  of the Greek chroniclers. They credit it at the outset with the almost  fabulous royal line of the Atyadae, in one of whose reigns the Tyrseni  are said to have migrated into Italy. Towards the twelfth century the  Atyadae were supplanted by a family of Heraclido, who traced their  descent to a certain Agron, whose personality is only a degree less  mythical than his ancestry; he was descended from Heracles through  Alcseus, Belus, and Ninus. Whether these last two names point to  intercourse with one or other of the courts on the banks of the  Euphrates, it is difficult to say. Twenty-one Heraclido, each one the  son of his predecessor, are said to have followed Agron on the throne,  their combined reigns giving a total of five hundred years.* Most of  these princes, whether Atyadae or Heraclidae, have for us not even a  shadowy existence, and what we know of the remainder is of a purely  fabulous nature. For instance, Kambles is reported to have possessed  such a monstrous appetite, that he devoured his own wife one night,  while asleep.**         * The number is a purely conventional one, and Gutschmid has       shown how it originated. The computation at first comprised       the complete series of 22 Heraclidae and 5 Mermnadae,       estimated reasonably at 4 kings to a century, i.e. 27 X 25 =       675 years, from the taking of Sardes to the supposed       accession of Agron. As it was known from other sources that       the 5 Mermnadae had reigned 170 years, these were subtracted       from the 675, to obtain the duration of the Heraclidae alone,       and by this means were obtained the 505 years mentioned by       Herodotus.         ** Another version, related by Nicolas of Damascus, refers       the story to the time of Lardanos, a contemporary of       Hercules; it shows that the Lydian chronographers considered       Kambles or Kamblitas as being one of the last of the Atyad       kings.    The concubine of Meles, again, is said to have brought forth a lion,  and the oracle of Telmessos predicted that the town of Sardes would be  rendered impregnable if the animal were led round the city walls; this  was done, except on the side of the citadel facing Mount Tmolus, which  was considered unapproachable, but it was by that very path that  the Persians subsequently entered the town. Alkimos, we are told,  accumulated immense treasures, and under his rule his subjects enjoyed  unequalled prosperity for fourteen years. It is possible that the story  of the expedition despatched into Palestine by a certain Akiamos, which  ended in the foundation of Ascalon, is merely a feeble echo of the raids  in Syrian and Egyptian waters made by the Tyrseni and Sardinians in the  thirteenth century B.C. The spread of the Phrygians, and the subsequent  progress of Greek colonisation, must have curtailed the possessions  of the Heraclidas from the eleventh to the ninth centuries, but the  material condition of the people does not appear to have suffered  by this diminution of territory. When they had once firmly planted  themselves in the ports along the Asianic littoral--at Kyme, at Phocae,  at Smyrna, at Clazomenae, at Colophon, at Ephesus, at Magnesia, at  Miletus--the AEolians and the Ionians lost no time in reaping the  advantages which this position, at the western extremities of the great  high-road through Asia Minor, secured to them. They overran all the  Lydian settlements in Phrygia--Sardes, Leontocephalos, Pessinus,  Gordioon, and Ancyra. The steep banks and the tortuous course of  the Halys failed to arrest them; and they pushed forward beyond the  mysterious regions peopled by the White Syrians, where the ancient  civilisation of Asia Minor still held its sway. The search for precious  metals mainly drew them on--the gold and silver, the copper, bronze, and  above all iron, which the Chalybae found in their mountains, and which  were conveyed by caravans from the regions of the Caucasus to the sacred  towns of Teiria and Pteria.*         * The site of Pteria has been fixed at Boghaz-keui by       Texier, an identification which has been generally adopted;       Euyuk is very probably Teiria, a town of the Lcucosyrians,       mentioned by Hecatsous of Miletus in his work.    The friendly relations into which they entered with the natives on these  journeys resulted before long in barter and intermarriage, though their  influence made itself felt in different ways, according to the character  of the people on whom it was brought to bear.
