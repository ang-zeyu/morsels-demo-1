The renunciation of  the traditional religious observances of the solar house involved also  the rejection of such personal names as implied an ardent devotion to  the banished god; in place of Amenothes, \"he to whom Amon is united,\"  the king assumed after a time the name of Khuniatonu, \"the Glory of the  Disk,\" and all the members of his family, as well as his adherents  at court, whose appellations involved the name of the same god, soon  followed his example. The proscription of Amon extended to inscriptions,  so that while his name or figure, wherever either could be got at, was  chiselled out, the vulture, the emblem of Mut, which expressed the idea  of mother, was also avoided.**         * The altar on which the king stands upright is one of those       cubes of masonry of which Naville discovered such a fine       example in the temple of Hatshopsitu at Deir el-Bahari.         ** We find, however, some instances where the draughtsman,       either from custom or design, had used the vulture to       express the word mailt, \"the mother,\" without troubling       himself to think whether it answered to the name of the       goddess.    The king would have nothing about him to suggest to eye or ear the  remembrance of the gods or doctrines of Thebes. It would consequently  have been fatal to them and their pretensions to the primacy of Egypt  if the reign of the young king had continued as long as might naturally  have been expected. After having been for nearly two centuries almost  the national head of Africa, Amon was degraded by a single blow to the  secondary rank and languishing existence in which he had lived before  the expulsion of the Hyksos. He had surrendered his sceptre as king of  heaven and earth, not to any of his rivals who in old times had enjoyed  the highest rank, but to an individual of a lower order, a sort of  demigod, while he himself had thus become merely a local deity, confined  to the corner of the Said in which he had had his origin. There was not  even left to him the peaceful possession of this restricted domain,  for he was obliged to act as host to the enemy who had deposed him:  the temple of Atonu was erected at the door of his own sanctuary, and  without leaving their courts the priests of Amon could hear at the hours  of worship the chants intoned by hundreds of heretics in the temple of  the Disk. Amon's priests saw, moreover, the royal gifts flowing into  other treasuries, and the gold of Syria and Ethiopia no longer came  into their hands. Should they stifle their complaints, and bow to this  insulting oppression, or should they raise a protest against the action  which had condemned them to obscurity and a restricted existence? If  they had given indications of resistance, they would have been obliged  to submit to prompt repression, but we see no sign of this. The bulk  of the people--clerical as well as lay--accepted the deposition with  complacency, and the nobles hastened to offer their adherence to that  which afterwards became the official confession of faith of the Lord  King.* The lord of Thebes itself, a certain Ramses, bowed his head to  the new cult, and the bas-reliefs of his tomb display to our eyes the  proofs of his apostasy: on the right-hand side Amon is the only subject  of his devotion, while on the left he declares himself an adherent of  Atonu. Religious formularies, divine appellations, the representations  of the costume, expression, and demeanour of the figures are at issue  with each other in the scenes on the two sides of the door, and if we  were to trust to appearances only, one would think that the two pictures  belonged to two separate reigns, and were concerned with two individuals  strangers to each other.**         * The political character of this reaction against the       growing power of the high priests and the town of Amon was       pointed out for the first time by Masporo in 1878. Ed. Meyer       and Tiele blond with the political idea a monotheistic       conception which does not seem to me to be fully justified,       at least at present, by anything in the materials we       possess.         ** His tomb was discovered in 1878 by Villiers-Stuart.    The rupture between the past and the present was so complete, in  fact, that the sovereign was obliged to change, if not his face and  expression, at least the mode in which they were represented.    [Illustration: 095.jpg THE MASK OF KIHUNIATONU]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Petrie. Petrie       thinks that the monument discovered by him, which is of fine       plaster, is a cast of the dead king, executed possibly to       enable the sculptors to make _Ushabtu_, \"Respondents,\" for       him.    The name and personality of an Egyptian were so closely allied that  interference with one implied interference with the other. Khuniatonu  could not continue to be such as he was when Amenothes, and, in fact,  their respective portraits differ from each other to that degree that  there is some doubt at moments as to their identity. Amenothes is  hardly to be distinguished from his father: he has the same regular and  somewhat heavy features, the same idealised body and conventional shape  as those which we find in the orthodox Pharaohs. Khuniatonu affects a  long and narrow head, conical at the top, with a retreating forehead,  a large aquiline and pointed nose, a small mouth, an enormous chin  projecting in front, the whole being supported by a long, thin neck.    His shoulders are narrow, with little display of muscle, but his breasts  are so full, his abdomen so prominent, and his hips so large, that one  would think they belonged to a woman. Etiquette required the attendants  upon the king, and those who aspired to his favour, to be portrayed in  the bas-reliefs of temples or tombs in all points, both as regards face  and demeanour, like the king himself. Hence it is that the majority of  his contemporaries, after having borne the likeness of Amenothes,  came to adopt, without a break, that of Khuniatonu. The scenes at Tel  el-Amarna contain, therefore, nothing but angular profiles, pointed  skulls, ample breasts, flowing figures, and swelling stomachs. The  outline of these is one that lends itself readily to caricature, and the  artists have exaggerated the various details with the intention, it  may be, of rendering the representations grotesque. There was nothing  ridiculous, however, in the king, their model, and several of his  statues attribute to him a languid, almost valetudinarian grace, which  is by no means lacking in dignity.    [Illustration: 096.jpg AMENOTHES IV., FROM THE STATUETTE IN THE LOUVRE.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a drawing by Petrie.    [Illustration: 097.jpg Page Image]    He was a good and affectionate man, and was passionately fond of his  wife, Nofrititi, associating her with himself in his sovereign acts. If  he set out to visit the temple, she followed him in a chariot; if he was  about to reward one of his faithful subjects, she stood beside him and  helped to distribute the golden necklaces. She joined him in his prayers  to the Solar Disk; she ministered to him in domestic life, when, having  broken away from the worries of his public duties, he sought relaxation  in his harem; and their union was so tender, that we find her on one  occasion, at least, seated in a coaxing attitude on her husband's  knees--a unique instance of such affection among all the representations  on the monuments of Egypt.    [Illustration: 098.jpg KHUNIATONU AND HIS WIFE REWARDING ONE OF THE  GREAT OFFICERS OF THE COURT]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Insinger.    They had six daughters, whom they brought up to live with them on  terms of the closest intimacy: they accompanied their father and mother  everywhere, and are exhibited as playing around the throne while their  parents are engaged in performing the duties of their office. The  gentleness and gaiety of the king were reflected in the life of his  subjects: all the scenes which they have left us consist entirely of  processions, cavalcades, banquets, and entertainments. Khuniatonu was  prodigal in the gifts of gold and the eulogies which he bestowed on  Mariri, the chief priest: the people dance around him while he is  receiving from the king the just recompense of his activity. When Huia,  who came back from Syria in the XIIth year of the king's reign, brought  solemnly before him the tribute he had collected, the king, borne in  his jolting palanquin on the shoulders of his officers, proceeded to the  temple to return thanks to his god, to the accompaniment of chants and  the waving of the great fans. When the divine father Ai had married the  governess of one of the king's daughters, the whole city gave itself  up to enjoyment, and wine flowed freely during the wedding feast.  Notwithstanding the frequent festivals, the king found time to watch  jealously over the ordinary progress of government and foreign affairs.  The architects, too, were not allowed to stand idle, and without taking  into account the repairs of existing buildings, had plenty to do in  constructing edifices in honour of Atonu in the principal towns of the  Nile valley, at Memphis, Heliopolis, Hermopolis, Hermonthis, and in  the Fayum. The provinces in Ethiopia remained practically in the  same condition as in the time of Amenothes III.;* Kush was pacified,  notwithstanding the raids which the tribes of the desert were accustomed  to make from time to time, only to receive on each occasion rigorous  chastisement from the king's viceroy.         * The name and the figure of Khuniatonu are met with on the       gate of the temple of Soleb, and he received in his       XIIth year the tributes of Kush, as well as those of Syria.    The sudden degradation of Amon had not "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17326"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 6 (of 12) (#15)"],[1," this period the most intricate of these systems. Like  most of the civilized nations of Western Asia, they had conducted their  diplomatic and commercial correspondence in the cuneiform character  impressed upon clay tablets. Their kings had had recourse to a  Babylonian model for communicating to the Amenothes Pharaohs the  expression of their wishes or their loyalty; we now behold them, after  an interval of four hundred years and more*--during which we have no  examples of their monuments--possessed of a short and commodious script,  without the encumbrance of ideograms, determinatives, polyphony and  syllabic sounds, such as had fettered the Egyptian and Chaldaean  scribes, in spite of their cleverness in dealing with them. Phonetic  articulations were ultimately resolved into twenty-two sounds, to each  of which a special sign was attached, which collectively took the place  of the hundreds or thousands of signs formerly required.         * The inscription on the bronze cup dedicated to the Baal of       the Lebanon, goes back probably to the time of Hiram I., say       the Xth century before our era; the reasons advanced by       Winckler for dating it in the time of Hiram II. have not       been fully accepted up to the present. By placing the       introduction of the alphabet somewhere between Amenothes IV.       in the XVth and Hiram I. in the Xth century before our era,       and by taking the middle date between them, say the       accession of the XXIs'dynasty towards the year 1100 B.C. for       its invention or adoption, we cannot go far wrong one way or       the other.    [Illustration: 106.jpg ONE OF THE MOST ANCIENT PHOENICIAN INSCRIPTIONS]         Drawn by Paucher-Gudin, from a heliogravure. This is the cup       of the Baal of the Lebanon.    This was an alphabet, the first in point of time, but so ingenious and  so pliable that the majority of ancient and modern nations have found  it able to supply all their needs--Greeks and Europeans of the western  Mediterranean on the one hand, and Semites of all kinds, Persians and  Hindus on the other.    [Illustration: 107.jpg Table of Alphabets]    It must have originated between the end of the XVIIIth and the beginning  of the XXIst dynasties, and the existence of Pharaonic rule in Phoenicia  during this period has led more than one modern scholar to assume that  it developed under Egyptian influence.*         * The hypothesis of an Egyptian origin, suggested casually       by Champollion, has been ably dealt with by E. de Rouge. E.       de Rouge derives the alphabet from the Hieratic, and his       identifications have been accepted by Lauth, by Brugsch, by       P. Lenormant, and by Isaac Taylor. Halevy would take it from       the Egyptian hieroglyphics directly without the intervention       of the Hieratic. The Egyptian origin, strongly contested of       late, has been accepted by the majority of scholars.    Some affirm that it is traceable directly to the hieroglyphs, while  others seek for some intermediary in the shape of a cursive script,  and find this in the Hieratic writing, which contains, they maintain,  prototypes of all the Phoenician letters. Tables have been drawn up,  showing at a glance the resemblances and differences which appear  respectively to justify or condemn their hypothesis. Perhaps the  analogies would be more evident and more numerous if we were in  possession of inscriptions going back nearer to the date of origin. As  it is, the divergencies are sufficiently striking to lead some scholars  to seek the prototype of the alphabet elsewhere--either in Babylon, in  Asia Minor, or even in Crete, among those barbarous hieroglyphs which  are attributed to the primitive inhabitants of the island. It is no easy  matter to get at the truth amid these conflicting theories. Two points  only are indisputable; first, the almost unanimous agreement among  writers of classical times in ascribing the first alphabet to the  Phoenicians; and second, the Phonician origin of the Greek, and  afterwards of the Latin alphabet which we employ to-day.    To return to the religion of the Phoenicians: the foreign deities were  not content with obtaining a high place in the estimation of priests  and people; they acquired such authority over the native gods that  they persuaded them to metamorphose themselves almost completely into  Egyptian divinities.    [Illustration: 109.jpg RASHUF ON HIS LION]         Drawn by Paucher-Gudin, from a photograph reproduced in       Clermont-Ganneau.    One finds among the majority of them the emblems commonly used in the  Pharaonic temples, sceptres with heads of animals, head-dress like the  Pschent, the _crux ansata_, the solar disk, and the winged scarab. The  lady of Byblos placed the cow's horns upon her head from the moment  she became identified with Hathor.* The Baal of the neighbouring  Arvad--probably a form of Bashuf--was still represented as standing  upright on his lion in order to traverse the high places: but while, in  the monument which has preserved the figure of the god, both lion and  mountain are given according to Chaldaean tradition, he himself, as the  illustration shows, is dressed after the manner of Egypt, in the striped  and plaited loin-cloth, wears a large necklace on his neck and bracelets  on his arms, and bears upon his head the white mitre with its double  plume and the Egyptian uraaus.**         * She is represented as Hathor on the stele of Iehav-melek,       King of Byblos, during the Persian period.         ** This monument, which belonged to the Peretie collection,       was found near Amrith, at the place called Nahr-Abrek. The       dress and bearing are so like those of the Rashuf       represented on Egyptian monuments, that I have no hesitation       in regarding this as a representation of that god.    He brandishes in one hand the weapon of the victor, and is on the point  of despatching with it a lion, which he has seized by the tail with  the other, after the model of the Pharaonic hunters, Amenothes I. and  Thutmosis III. The lunar disk floating above his head lends to him,  it is true, a Phonician character, but the winged sun of Heliopolis  hovering above the disk leaves no doubt as to his Egyptian antecedents.*         * The Phonician symbol represents the crescent moon holding       the darkened portion in its arms, like the symbol reserved       in Egypt for the lunar gods.    [Illustration: 110.jpg A PHOENICIAN GOD IN HIS EGYPTIAN SHRINE]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Renan.    The worship, too, offered to these metamorphosed gods was as much  changed as the deities themselves; the altars assumed something of the  Egyptian form, and the tabernacles were turned into shrines, which were  decorated at the top with a concave groove, or with a frieze made up of  repetitions of the uraeus. Egyptian fashions had influenced the better  classes so far as to change even their mode of dealing with the dead, of  which we find in not a few places clear evidence. Travellers arriving in  Egypt at that period must have been as much astonished as the tourist of  to-day by the monuments which the Egyptians erected for their dead.    [Illustration: 111.jpg AMENOTHES I. SEIZING A LION]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin. This monument was in the Louvre       Museum. Analogous figures of gods or kings holding a lion by       the tail are found on various monuments of the Theban       dynasties.    The pyramids which met their gaze, as soon as they had reached the apex  of the Delta, must have far surpassed their ideas of them, no matter how  frequently they may have been told about them, and they must have been  at a loss to know why such a number of stones should have been brought  together to cover a single corpse. At the foot of these colossal  monuments, lying like a pack of hounds asleep around their master, the  mastabas of the early dynasties were ranged, half buried under the sand,  but still visible, and still visited on certain days by the descendants  of their inhabitants, or by priests charged with the duty of keeping  them up. Chapels of more recent generations extended as a sort of screen  before the ancient tombs, affording examples of the two archaic types  combined--the mastaba more or less curtailed in its proportions, and the  pyramid with a more or less acute point. The majority of these monuments  are no longer in existence, and only one of them has come down to us  intact--that which Amenothes III. erected in the Serapeum at Memphis in  honour of an Apis which had died in his reign.    [Illustration: 112.jpg A PHOENICIAN MASTABA AT ARVAD]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the restoration by Thobois, as       given in Renan. The cuttings made in the lower stonework       appear to be traces of unfinished steps. The pyramid at the       top is no longer in existence, but its remains are scattered       about the foot of the monument, and furnished M. Thobois       with the means of reconstructing with exactness the original       form.    Phoenicians visiting the Nile valley must have carried back with them  to their native country a remembrance of this kind of burying-place, and  have suggested it to their architects as a model. One of the cemeteries  at Arvad contains a splendid specimen of this imported design.*         * Pietschmann thinks that the monument is not older than the       Greek epoch, and it must be admitted that the cornice is not       such as we usually meet with in Egypt in Theban times;       nevertheless, the very marked resemblance to the Theban       mastaba shows that it must have been directly connected with       the Egyptian type which prevailed from the XVIIIth to the       XXth dynasties.
