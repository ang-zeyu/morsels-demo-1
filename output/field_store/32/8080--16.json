But she looked straight at Laura and  waited.    Laura did not speak either. She looked at Maida as if she had never  seen her before. She carried her head at its highest and she moved  across the room with her most important air. As she stood a moment  gazing at the things in the show case, she had never seemed more  patronizing.    \"A cent's worth of dulse, please,\" she said airily.    \"Dulse?\" Maida repeated questioningly; \"I guess I haven't any. What  is dulse?\"    \"Haven't any dulse?\" Laura repeated with an appearance of being  greatly shocked. \"Do you mean to say you haven't any dulse?\"    Maida did not answer--she put her lips tight together.    \"This is a healthy shop,\" Laura went on in a sneering tone, \"no  mollolligobs, no apple-on-the-stick, no tamarinds, no pop-corn  balls, no dulse. Why don't you sell the things we want? Half the  children in the neighborhood are going down to Main Street to get  them now.\"    She bustled out of the shop. Maida stared after her with wide,  alarmed eyes. For a moment she did not stir. Then she ran into the  living-room and buried her face in Granny's lap, bursting into  tears.    \"Oh, Granny,\" she sobbed, \"Laura Lathrop says that half the children  don't like my shop and they're going down to Main Street to buy  things. What shall I do? What shall I do?\"    \"There, there, acushla,\" Granny said soothingly, taking the  trembling little girl on to her lap. \"Don't worry about anny t'ing  that wan says. 'Tis a foine little shop you have, as all the grown  folks says.\"    \"But, Granny,\" Maida protested passionately, \"I don't want to please  the grown people, I want to please the children. And papa said I  must make the store pay. And now I'm afraid I never will. Oh, what  shall I do?\"    She got no further. A tinkle of the bell, followed by pattering  footsteps, interrupted. In an instant, Rosie, brilliant in her  scarlet cape and scarlet hat, with cheeks and lips the color of  cherries, stood at her side.    \"I saw that hateful Laura come out of here,\" she said. \"I just knew  she'd come in to make trouble. What did she say to you?\"    Maida told her slowly between her sobs.    \"Horrid little smarty-cat!\" was Rosie's comment and she scowled  until her face looked like a thunder-cloud.    \"I shall never speak to her again,\" Maida declared fervently. \"But  what shall I do about it, Rosie?--it may be true what she said.\"    \"Now don't you get discouraged, Maida,\" Rosie said. \"Because I can  tell you just how to get or make those things Laura spoke of.\"    \"Oh, can you, Rosie. What would I do without you? I'll put  everything down in a book so that I shan't forget them.\"    She limped over to the desk. There the black head bent over the  golden one.    \"What is dulse?\" Maida demanded first.    \"Don't you know what dulse is?\" Rosie asked incredulously. \"Maida,  you are the queerest child. The commonest things you don't know  anything about. And yet I suppose if I asked you if you'd seen a  flying-machine, you'd say you had.\"    \"I have,\" Maida answered instantly, \"in Paris.\"    Rosie's face wrinkled into its most perplexed look. She changed the  subject at once. \"Well, dulse is a purple stuff--when you see a lot  of it together, it looks as if a million toy-balloons had burst.  It's all wrinkled up and tastes salty.\"    Maida thought hard for a moment. Then she burst into laughter,  although the big round tear-drops were still hanging from the tips  of her lashes. \"There was a whole drawerful here when I first came.  I remember now I thought it was waste stuff and threw it all away.\"    Rosie laughed too. \"The tamarinds you can get from the man who comes  round with the wagon. Mrs. Murdock used to make her own  apples-on-the-stick, mollolligobs and corn-balls. I've helped her many a  time. Now I'll write you a list of stuff to order from the grocer. I'll  come round after school and we'll make a batch of all those things.  To-night you get Billy to print a sign, '_apples on the stick and  mollolligobs to-day_.' You put that in the window to-morrow morning  and by to-morrow night, you'll be all sold out.\"    \"Oh, Rosie,\" Maida said happily, \"I shall be so much obliged to  you!\"    Rosie was as good as her word. She appeared that afternoon wearing a  long-sleeved apron under the scarlet cape. It seemed to Maida that  she worked like lightning, for she made batch after batch of candy,  moving as capably about the stove as an experienced cook. In the  meantime, Maida was popping corn at the fireplace. They mounted  fifty apples on skewers and dipped them, one at a time, into the  boiling candy. They made thirty corn-balls and twenty-five  mollolligobs, which turned out to be round chunks of candy, stuck on  the end of sticks.    \"I never did see such clever children anywhere as there are in  Primrose Court,\" Maida said that night with a sigh to Granny. \"Rosie  told me that she could make six kinds of candy. And Dicky can cook  as well as his mother. They make me feel so useless. Why, Granny, I  can't do a single thing that's any good to anybody.\"    The next day the shop was crowded. By night there was not an apple,  a corn-ball or a mollolligob left.    \"I shall have a sale like this once a week in the future,\" Maida  said. \"Why, Granny, lots and lots of children came here who'd never  been in the shop before.\"    And so what looked like serious trouble ended very happily.    Trouble number three was a great deal more serious and it did not,  at first, promise to end well at all. It had to do with Arthur  Duncan. It had been going on for a week before Maida mentioned it to  anybody. But it haunted her very dreams.    Early Monday morning, Arthur came into the shop. In his usual gruff  voice and with his usual surly manner, he said, \"Show me some of  those rubbers in the window.\"    Maida took out a handful of the rubbers--five, she thought--and put  them on the counter. While Arthur looked them over, she turned to  replace a paper-doll which she had knocked down.    \"Guess I won't take one to-day,\" Arthur said, while her back was  still turned, and walked out.    When Maida put the rubbers back, she discovered that there were only  four. She made up her mind that she had not counted right and  thought no more of the incident.    Two days later, Arthur Duncan came in again. Maida had just been  selling some pencils--pretty striped ones with a blue stone in the  end. Three of them were left lying out on the counter. Arthur asked  her to show him some penholders. Maida took three from the shelves  back of her. He bought one of these. After he had gone, she  discovered that there were only two pencils left on the counter.    \"One of them must have rolled off,\" Maida thought. But although she  looked everywhere, she could not find it. The incident of the rubber  occurred to her. She felt a little troubled but she resolved to put  both circumstances out of her mind.    A day or two later, Arthur Duncan came in for the third time. It  happened that Granny was out marketing.    Piled on the counter was a stack of blank-books--pretty books they  were, with a child's head in color on the cover. Arthur asked for  letter-paper. Maida turned back to the shelf. With her hand on the  sliding door, she stopped, half-stunned.    _Reflected in the glass she saw Arthur Duncan stow one of the blank  books away in his pocket._    Maida felt sick all over. She did not know what to do. She did not  know what to say.    She fumbled with trembling hands among the things on the shelf. She  dreaded to turn for fear her face would express what she had seen.    \"Perhaps he'll pay for it,\" she thought; \"I hope he will.\"    But Arthur made no offer to pay. He looked over the letter-paper  that Maida, with downcast eyes, put before him, decided that he did  not want any after all, and walked coolly from the shop.    Granny, coming in a few moments later, was surprised to find Maida  leaning on the counter, her face buried in her hands.    \"What's the matter with my lamb?\" the old lady asked cheerfully.    \"Nothing, Granny,\" Maida said. But she did not meet Granny's eye and  during dinner she was quiet and serious.    That night Billy Potter called. \"Well, how goes the _Bon Marche of_  Charlestown?\" he asked cheerfully.    \"Billy,\" Maida said gravely, \"if you found that a little boy--I can't  say what his name is--was stealing from you, what would you do?\"    Billy considered the question as gravely as she had asked it. \"Tell  the policeman on the beat and get him to throw a scare into him,\" he  said at last.    \"I guess that's what I'll have to do.\" But Maida's tone was  mournful.    But Granny interrupted.    \"Don't you do ut, my lamb--don't you do ut!\" She turned to them  both--they had never seen her blue eyes so fiery before. \"Suppose you  was one av these poor little chilthren that lives round here that's  always had harrd wurruds for their meals and hunger for their  pillow, wudn't you be afther staling yersilf if ut came aisy-loike  and nobody was luking?\"    Neither Billy nor Maida spoke for a moment.    \"I guess Granny's right,\" Billy said finally.    \"I guess she is,\" Maida said with a sigh.    It was three days before Arthur Duncan came into the shop again. But  in the meantime, Maida went one afternoon to play with Dicky. Dicky  was drawing at a table when Maida came in. She glanced at his work.  He was using a striped pencil with a blue stone in its end, a  blank-book with the picture of a little girl on the cover, a rubber of  a kind very familiar to her. Maida knew certainly that Dicky had  bought none of these things from her. She knew as certainly that  they were the things Arthur Duncan had stolen. What was the  explanation of the mystery? She went to bed that night miserably  unhappy.    Her heart beat pit-a-pat the next time she saw Arthur open the door.  She folded her hands close together so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17546"],[0,"The Lion of Saint Mark: A Story of Venice in the Fourteenth Century (#15)"],[1,"urd, when you spoke to me, that  the woman I have for years treated as a friend should thus betray me.  And yet your warning made me uneasy, so much so that I set off myself  to fetch them home at five o'clock, only to find that I was too late. I  scarcely know why I have sent for you, Francis, except that as I have  found, to my cost, that you were more clear sighted in this matter than  I, I want to know what you think now, and whether any plan offering  even a chance of success has occurred to you. That they have been  carried off by the friends of Mocenigo I have no doubt whatever.\"    \"I fear, signor,\" Francis said, \"that there is little hope of my  thinking of anything that has not already occurred to you. It seems to  me hardly likely that they can be in the city, although, of course,  they may be confined in the house of Mocenigo's agents. Still, they  would be sure that you would offer large rewards for their discovery,  and would be more likely to take them right away. Besides, I should  think that it was Mocenigo's intention to join them, wherever they may  be, as soon as he learned that they were in the hands of his  accomplices. Your fortunate discovery that they had gone, so soon after  they had been carried off, and your going straight to him armed with  the order of the council, probably upset his calculations, for it is  likely enough that his agents had not arrived at the house, and that he  learned from you, for the first time, that his plans had succeeded. Had  you arrived two or three hours later, you might have found him gone.\"    \"That is what I calculated, Francisco. His agents had but four hours'  start of me. They would, no doubt, carry the girls to the place of  concealment chosen, and would then bear the news to him; whereas I,  going direct in one of the state gondolas, might reach him before they  did, and I feel assured that I did so.    \"It was nigh midnight when I arrived, but he was still up, and I doubt  not awaiting the arrival of the villains he had employed. My first step  was to set a watch round the house, with the order to arrest any who  might come and inquire for him. No one, however, came.    \"The news, indeed, of the sudden arrival of a state galley, at that  hour, had caused some excitement in the place, and his agents might  well have heard of it upon their arrival. I agree with you in thinking  they are not in the town, but this makes the search all the more  difficult. The question is, what ought we to do next?\"    \"The reward that you have offered will certainly bring you news,  signor, if any, save those absolutely concerned, have observed anything  suspicious; but I should send to all the fishing villages, on the  islets and on the mainland, to publish the news of the reward you have  offered. Beyond that, I do not see that anything can be done; and I,  too, have thought of nothing else since Matteo brought me the news of  their being carried off. It will be of no use, that I can see, going  among the fishermen and questioning them, because, with such a reward  in view, it is certain that anyone who has anything to tell will come,  of his own accord, to do so.\"    \"I know that is the case already, Francisco. The authorities have been  busy all day with the matter, and a score of reports as to closed  gondolas being seen have reached them; but so far nothing has come of  it. Many of these gondolas have been traced to their destinations, but  in no case was there anything to justify suspicion. Happily, as long as  Mocenigo is in confinement, I feel that no actual harm will happen to  the girls; but the villain is as crafty as a fox, and may elude the  vigilance of the officer in charge of him. I am going to the council,  presently, to urge that he should be brought here as a prisoner; but  from what I hear there is little chance of the request being complied  with. His friends are already declaiming on the injustice of a man  being treated as a criminal, when there is no shadow of proof  forthcoming against him; and the disturbances last night have angered  many who have no great friendship for him, but who are indignant at the  attack of the populace upon the house of a noble. So you see that there  is but faint chance that they would bring him hither a prisoner.\"    \"I think, sir, that were I in your case, I should put some trusty men  to watch round the house where he is confined; so that in case he  should escape the vigilance of his guards they might seize upon him.  Everything depends, as you say, upon his being kept in durance.\"    \"I will do so, Francisco, at once. I will send to two of my officers at  the port, and tell them to pick out a dozen men on whom they can rely,  to proceed to Botonda, and to watch closely everyone who enters or  leaves the house, without at the same time making themselves  conspicuous. At any rate, they will be handy there in case Mocenigo's  friends attempt to rescue him by force, which might be done with  success, for the house he occupies stands at a short distance out of  the town, and the official in charge of Mocenigo has only eight men  with him.    \"Yes, your advice is excellent, and I will follow it at once. Should  any other idea occur to you, pray let me know it immediately. You saved  my daughters once, and although I know there is no reason why it should  be so, still, I feel a sort of belief that you may, somehow, be  instrumental in their again being brought back to me.\"    \"I will do my best, sir, you may depend upon it,\" Francis said  earnestly. \"Were they my own sisters, I could not feel more strongly  interested in their behalf.\"    Francis spent the next week almost entirely in his gondola. Starting  soon after daybreak with Giuseppi, he would row across to the villages  on the mainland, and make inquiries of all sorts there; or would visit  the little groups of fishermen's huts, built here and there on posts  among the shallows. He would scan every house as he passed it, with the  vague hope that a face might appear at the window, or a hand be waved  for assistance. But, during all that time, he had found nothing which  seemed to offer the slightest clue, nor were the inquiries set on foot  by Signor Polani more successful. Every piece of information which  seemed to bear, in the slightest degree, upon the affair was  investigated, but in no case was it found of the slightest utility.    One evening he was returning late, tired by the long day's work, and  discouraged with his utter want of success, when, just as he had passed  under the Ponto Maggiore, the lights on the bridge fell on the faces of  the sitters in a gondola coming the other way. They were a man and a  woman. The latter was closely veiled. But the night was close and  oppressive, and, just at the moment when Francis' eyes fell upon her,  she lifted her veil for air. Francis recognized her instantly. For a  moment he stopped rowing, and then dipped his oar in as before.  Directly the other gondola passed through the bridge behind him, and  his own had got beyond the circle of light, he swept it suddenly round.    Giuseppi gave an exclamation of surprise.    \"Giuseppi, we have luck at last. Did you notice that gondola we met  just now? The woman sitting in it is Castaldi, the woman who betrayed  the signoras.\"    \"What shall we do, Messer Francisco?\" Giuseppi, who had become almost  as interested in the search as his master, asked. \"There was only a  single gondolier and one other man. If we take them by surprise we can  master them.\"    \"That will not do, Giuseppi. The woman would refuse to speak, and  though they could force her to do so in the dungeons, the girls would  be sure to be removed the moment it was known she was captured. We must  follow them, and see where they go to. Let us get well behind them, so  that we can just make them out in the distance. If they have a  suspicion that they are being followed, they will land her at the first  steps and slip away from us.\"    \"They are landing now, signor,\" Giuseppi exclaimed directly afterwards.  \"Shall we push on and overtake them on shore?\"    \"It is too late, Giuseppi. They are a hundred and fifty yards away, and  would have mixed in the crowd, and be lost, long before we should get  ashore and follow them. Row on fast, but not over towards that side. If  the gondola moves off, we will make straight for the steps and try to  follow them, though our chance of hitting upon them in the narrow lanes  and turnings is slight indeed.    \"But if, as I hope, the gondola stops at the steps, most likely they  will return to it in time. So we will row in to the bank a hundred  yards farther up the canal and wait.\"    The persons who had been seen in the gondola had disappeared when they  came abreast of it, and the gondolier had seated himself in the boat,  with the evident intention of waiting. Francis steered his gondola at a  distance of a few yards from it as he shot past, but did not abate his  speed, and continued to row till they were three or four hundred yards  farther up the canal. Then he turned the gondola, and paddled  noiselessly back until he could see the outline of the boat he was  watching.    An hour elapsed before any movement was visible. Then Francis heard the  sound of footsteps, and could just make out the figures of persons  descending the steps and entering the gondola. Then the boat moved out  into the middle of the canal, where a few boats were still passing to  and fro. Francis kept his gondola close by the bank, so as to be in the  deep shade of the houses. The boat they were following again passed  under the Ponto Maggiore, and for some distance followed the line of  the Grand Canal.    \"Keep your eye upon it, Giuseppi. It is sure to turn off one way or the  other soon, and if it is too far ahead of us when it does so, then it  may give us the slip altogether.\"    But the gondola continued its course the whole length of the canal, and  then straight on until,"]]]
