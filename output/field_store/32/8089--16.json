A mark can  be reached by chance; but only an accustomed hand can string a bow as  unyielding as this one.    \"Who telephoned to Madame Duclos; and of what nature was the message  which sent her from the hotel so precipitately that she not only left the  most important part of her baggage behind but went away without making  adequate provision for the young girl confided to her charge?    \"Does this mean that she had been made acquainted with the fate of the  young girl; and if so, by whom?\"    \"Business enough for us all,\" was the Inspector's comment as Gryce paused  in this enumeration. \"As you put it, I am more and more convinced that  the key you spoke of a short time ago will be found in this missing  woman's tightly shut hand.\"    \"Which brings us round full-circle to our first conclusion: that Miss  Willetts' death is not only a crime, but a premeditated one.\"    \"Carried out, not by the one benefited, but by an agent selected for the  purpose.\"    \"An agent, moreover, who knew the ways and possibilities of the place.\"    \"A logical conclusion; but still too incredible for belief. I find it  hard to trust to appearances in this case.\"    \"And I also. But as we have both said, time may clear away some of its  incongruities. Meanwhile I have an experiment to propose.\" And leaning  close to the Inspector, notwithstanding the fact that there was nobody  within hearing and he knew it, he whispered a few words in his ear.    The Inspector stared.    \"To-night?\" he asked.    The detective nodded.          IX    WHILE THE CITY SLEPT      Night--the night of a great city with its myriad of garish lights and its  many curious and incongruous activities.    Who has not felt his imagination stirred by the contrasts thus  offered--contrasts never more apparent than at these hours of supposed  rest? Grim walls, with dimpled children sleeping behind them! Places of  merrymaking athrob with music and dazzling with jets of incandescent  light, with grief in the heart of the dancer and despair making raucous  the enforced laugh!    But nowhere in the great city of which we write on this night of May 23,  1913, was there to be found a scene of greater contradictions than in the  court and galleries of its famous museum.    Lighted as for a reception, the architectural beauties of its Moorish  arcades and carven balustrades flashed in full splendor. Gems of antique  art, casts in which genius had stored its soul and caused to live before  us the story of the ancients, pillars from desert sands, friezes from the  Parthenon and bas-reliefs from Nineveh and Heliopolis, filled every  corner, commanding the eye to satisfy itself in forms of deathless grace  or superhuman power. And no one to heed! Not an eye to note that the  Venus in one corner seemed to smile in the soft light with more than its  accustomed allurement, or that the armor in which kings had fought wore a  menacing sparkle exceeding that of other times and quieter days. Ghosts  of vanished ages might parade at will among the chattels of their time or  drain the iridescent beaker to their unknown gods--no one would have  noticed or turned aside to see. For there was something else within these  walls to-night for the men assembled there to look upon, and a story to  be read which shut the imagination upon the past by amply filling it with  the present.    What is this something? Let us follow the gaze of the half-dozen persons  grouped in front of the tapestry hanging in the northern gallery, and  see.    But first, of whom is this small and mystic group composed? Who are these  men who in the middle of the night, in the security of a completely  shuttered building, busy themselves, not with the inestimable treasures  surrounding them, but with an odd and seemingly mountebank adventure  totally out of keeping with the place and their absorbed demeanor? We  will name them:    Mr. Roberts and a second director seen here for the first time, Inspector  Jackson, Mr. Gryce, two lesser detectives, and a strange young man of  undoubted Indian extraction who kept much in the background and yet stood  always at attention like one awaiting orders.    Are these all? Yes, in the one gallery; but in the other, shadowy figures  are visible among the arches at one end, with whose identity we shall  probably soon be made acquainted.    At what are these various persons, in the one gallery as in the other,  looking so intently that all are turned one way--the way of greatest  interest--the way the fatal arrow had flown some fourteen hours before,  carrying death to the innocent girl smiling upon life in youthful  exuberance? Is it at some image of herself they see restored to hope and  joy? An image is there, but alas! it is but a dummy taken from one of the  exhibits and so set up as to present the same angle to the gallery-front  as her young body had done, according to Mr. Travis' reluctant  declaration.    Why so placed, and why regarded with such concentrated interest by the  men confronting it from the opposite gallery, will become apparent when,  upon the Indian's being summoned from his place of modest retirement, it  can be seen that the bow he carries in one hand is offset by the arrow he  holds in the other. A test is to be made which will settle, or so they  hope, the truth of Mr. Travis' story. If an arrow launched from before  the pedestal or even from behind it through the loophole made by the  curving-in of the vase toward its base can be made to reach its mark in  the breast of this dummy, then they would feel some justification in  doubting his statement that the arrow, whatever the appearances, was not  shot from this gallery. If it could not, belief in his statements would  be confirmed and their minds be cleared of a doubt which must hamper all  their future movements.    The second director, whose name was Clayton, stood at the left of the  Inspector and close against the tapestry. To him that official now turned  with this explanation:    \"The bow you see in Mr. La Fleche's hand is similar in length and weight  to the one found lying strung for use in the doorway back of where you  are now standing. The arrow is from the same quiver as the one which  entered Miss Willetts' breast.... Did you speak?\"    No, Mr. Clayton had not spoken; yet for some reason a thrill had passed  through the small group surrounding him, which had heightened the  consciousness of them all. Eyes and ears became alert; only the Indian  showed stolidity.    \"Mr. La Fleche, you will first stand here,\" continued the Inspector,  pointing to the spot which Mr. Travis had finally settled upon as the one  where he had been standing at the moment he saw Miss Willetts fall.    The Indian took the place, sighted the figure diagonally opposite and  laid his finger on the string.    \"An inch to the left of the bunch of flowers pinned on the dummy's  breast,\" murmured Mr. Gryce almost in his ear.    It was a breathless moment; even the two detectives showed excitement.    But the Indian failed to shoot. Instead, he looked around at the  Inspector and quietly remarked:    \"I will shoot standing, since you so request, but I think you will find  that the arrow which caused death was delivered by a man kneeling.\"    A flash of the eye between the two detectives, which only one man saw!  All the others were watching the lightning flight of the arrow. It struck  the dummy full and square. Everyone shuddered, even the Inspector; it  brought the real tragedy so vividly to mind.    Meanwhile a movement had taken place in the small group of men watching  from the other side. One of them stepped fully into view and approaching  the figure thus attacked, drew out the arrow and made close examination  of the hole it had made and shook his head. It was Coroner Price.    \"Try again, and from behind the pedestal this time,\" he called out across  the intervening space as he stepped back into his former place of  observation.    The Inspector motioned his wishes to the Indian, who with a subtle twist  of his body slipped behind the pedestal.    \"That's better,\" was the Inspector's quick comment. \"Can you handle the  bow easily from where you now stand?\"    \"There is plenty of room.\"    \"Very well. But wait! Before we proceed further, there is a matter to  which I wish to call the attention of these gentlemen. It must have been  apparent to you all that a person standing where Mr. La Fleche did a  moment ago would be easily visible to anyone looking up from the court or  across from the opposite gallery, or even from the broad corridors at  either end of the building. But would the same hold true if instead of  being in front he had been behind the pedestal, as Mr. La Fleche is now?  Run below, Barney; and, gentlemen, disperse yourselves in different  directions and give me your opinion. Now!\" he demanded after a few  minutes' wait, during which there had been a scattering to right and left  along the galleries, \"what do you say?\"    \"If anyone chanced to be looking directly there, yes,\" was shouted up  from below.    \"What do you say, Coroner Price?\"    \"Ask the man to kneel.\"    The Inspector gave the word.    \"Ah, that's different! The bulge of the vase hides the upper part of his  head, and the pedestal itself the lower. He might shoot from his present  position with impunity.\"    \"Do you all agree?\"    \"Yes, yes!\" came from different parts of the building.    \"Then, Mr. La Fleche, here's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17766"],[0,"With Wolfe in Canada: The Winning of a Continent (#15)"],[1," The idea is unnatural. It is downright  monstrous!    \"No, you and I understand each other at last; would to Heaven we had  done so eight years back! I feel how much more nobly you acted in that  unhappy matter than I did, and I esteem and honour you. We are both  getting on in life, we have one common love and interest, we stand in  the same relation to the child, and I say, emphatically, that you have  a right, and more than a right, to a half share in her. You must go  away no more, but remain here as my friend, and as joint guardian of  the child.    \"I will have no refusal, man,\" he went on, as the sergeant shook his  head. \"Your presence here will be almost as great a comfort, to me, as  to the child. I am a lonely man. For years, I have cut myself loose  from the world. I have neither associates nor friends. But now that  this great load is off my mind, my first want is a friend; and who  could be so great a friend, who could enter into my plans and hopes for  the future so well, as yourself, who would have an interest in them  equal to my own?\"    The sergeant was much moved by the squire's earnestness. He saw that  the latter had really at heart the proposal he made.    \"You are very good, squire,\" he said in a low voice; \"but even if I  could bring myself to eat another man's bread, as long as I can work  for my own, it would not do. I am neither by birth nor education fitted  for such a position as that you offer to me.\"    \"Pooh, nonsense!\" the squire said hotly. \"You have seen the world. You  have travelled and mixed with men. You are fit to associate as an equal  with anyone. Don't you deceive yourself; you certainly do not deceive  me.    \"It is pride that stands in your way. For that you are going to risk  the happiness of your granddaughter, to say nothing of mine; for you  don't suppose that either of us is going to feel comfortable and happy,  when the snow is whirling round, and the wind sweeping the moors, to  think of you trudging along about the country, while we are sitting  snugly here by a warm fire.    \"You are wanting to spoil everything, now that it has all come right at  last, by just the same obstinate pride which wrecked the lives of our  children. I won't have it, man. I won't hear of it.    \"Come, say no more. I want a friend badly, and I am sure we shall suit  each other. I want a companion. Why, man, if I were a rich old lady,  and you were a poor old lady, and I asked you to come as my companion,  you would see nothing derogatory in the offer. You shall come as my  companion, now, or if you like as joint guardian to the child. You  shall have your own rooms in the house; and when you feel inclined to  be grumpy, and don't care to take your meals with the child and me, you  can take them apart.    \"At any rate, try it for a month, and if you are not comfortable then I  will let you go, though your rooms shall always be in readiness for  you, whenever you are disposed to come back.    \"Come, give me your hand on the bargain.\"    Sergeant Wilks could resist no longer. The last two years work, without  the child, had indeed been heavy, and especially in winter, when the  wind blew strong across the uplands, he began to feel that he was no  longer as strong as he used to be. The prospect of having Aggie always  near him was, however, a far greater temptation than that of ending his  days in quiet and comfort.    His hand and that of the squire met in a cordial grip, and the matter  was settled. Fortunately, as the sergeant reflected, he had still his  pension of ten shillings a week, which would suffice to supply clothes  and other little necessaries which he might require, and would thus  save him from being altogether dependent on the squire.    Aggie was wild with delight, when she was called in and informed of the  arrangement. The thought of her grandfather tramping the country,  alone, had been the one drawback to the pleasure of her life at Mrs.  Walsham's, and many a time she had cried herself to sleep, as she  pictured to herself his loneliness. That he was to be with her always,  was to give up his work to settle down in comfort, was indeed a delight  to her.    Greatly pleased was she, also, to hear that Mrs. Walsham was to be  asked to come up to be her governess.    \"Oh, it will be nice!\" she exclaimed, clapping her hands. \"Just like  the fairy stories you used to tell me, grampa, when everyone was made  happy at the end by the good fairy. Grandpapa is the good fairy, and  you and I are the prince and princess; and James--and what is to be  done with James? Is he to come up, too?\"    \"No, my dear,\" the squire said, smiling. \"James is to go to a good  school, but you will see him when he comes home for his holidays. But  that part of it is not arranged yet, you know; but if you will put on  your hat, you can walk down with us to the town, and introduce me to  Mrs. Walsham.\"    Mrs. Walsham had just dismissed her pupils, when the party arrived, and  was thinking how quiet and dull the house was without Aggie, when the  door opened, and the child rushed in and threw her arms round her neck.    \"Oh, I have such good news to tell you! Grandpapa is so good and kind,  and grampa is going to live with us, and you are to come up, too, and  James is to go to school. Isn't it all splendid?\"    \"What are you talking about, Aggie?\" Mrs. Walsham asked, bewildered, as  the child poured out her news.    \"Aggie is too fast, madam,\" the squire said, entering the room  accompanied by the sergeant. \"She is taking it all for granted, while  it has yet to be arranged. I must apologize for coming in without  knocking; but the child opened the door and rushed in, and the best  thing to do was, we thought, to follow her.    \"I have come, in the first place, to thank you for your great kindness  to my little granddaughter, and to tell your son how deeply I feel  indebted to him, for having saved her life two years ago.    \"Now, Aggie, you run away and look for your friend, while I talk  matters over with Mrs. Walsham.\"    Aggie scampered away to find James, who was at work at his books, and  to tell him the news, while the squire unfolded his plans to Mrs.  Walsham.    His offers were so handsome that Mrs. Walsham accepted them, without an  instant's hesitation. She was to have the entire charge of the child  during the day, with the option of either returning home in the  evening, when Aggie went in to dessert after dinner, or of living  entirely at the Hall. The squire explained his intention of sending  James to a good school at Exeter, as an instalment of the debt he owed  him for saving the child's life, and he pointed out that, when he was  at home for his holidays, Aggie could have her holidays, too, and Mrs.  Walsham need only come up to the Hall when she felt inclined.    Mrs. Walsham was delighted with the offer, even more for James's sake  than her own, although the prospect for herself was most pleasant. To  have only Aggie to teach, and walk with, would be delightful after the  monotony of drilling successive batches of girls, often inordinately  tiresome and stupid. She said, at once, that she should prefer  returning home at night--a decision which pleased the squire, for he  had wondered what he should do with her in the evening.    The arrangement was at once carried into effect. The school was broken  up, and, as the parents of the children were almost all tenants of the  squire, they offered no objection to the girls being suddenly left on  their hands, when they heard that their teacher was going to live as  governess at the Hall. Indeed, the surprise of Sidmouth and the  neighbourhood, at learning that the little girl at Mrs. Walsham's was  the squire's granddaughter, and that the showman was therefore a  connection of the squire, and was going also to live at the Hall, was  so great, that there was no room for any other emotion. Save for  wrecks, or the arrival of shoals of fish off the coast, or of troubles  between the smugglers and the revenue officers, Sidmouth had few  excitements, and the present news afforded food for endless talk and  conjecture.    On comparing notes, it appeared that there was not a woman in the place  who had not been, all along, convinced that the little girl at Mrs.  Walsham's was something more than she seemed to be, and that the  showman was a man quite out of the ordinary way. And when, on the  following Sunday, the sergeant, who had in the meantime been to Exeter,  walked quietly into church with the squire, all agreed that the  well-dressed military-looking man was a gentleman, and that he had only  been masquerading under the name of Sergeant Wilks until, somehow or  other, the quarrel between him and the squire was arranged, and the  little heiress restored to her position; and Sidmouth remained in that  belief to the end.    The sergeant's military title was henceforth dropped. Mr. Linthorne  introduced him to his acquaintances--who soon began to flock in, when  it was known that the squire's granddaughter had come home, and that he  was willing to see his friends and join in society again--as \"My friend  Mr. Wilks, the father of my poor boy's wife.\"    And the impression made was generally favourable.    None had ever known the exact story of Herbert's marriage. It was  generally supposed that he had married beneath him; but the opinion now  was that this must have been a mistake, for there was nothing in any  way vulgar about the quiet, military-looking gentleman, with whom the  squire was evidently on terms of warm friendship.    The only person somewhat dissatisfied with the arrangement was James  Walsham. He loved his mother so much, that he had never offered the  slightest dissent to her plan, that he should follow in his father's  footsteps. She was so much set on the matter, that he could never bring  himself to utter a word in opposition. At heart, however, he longed for  a more stirring and more adventurous life, such"]]]
