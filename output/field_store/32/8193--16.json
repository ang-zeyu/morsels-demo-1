I shall leave at the  holidays, and then I will tell Dr. Wilkinson; will you--can you--to  save a fellow from such disgrace, spare me a little longer? There are  only four weeks--oh, Louis! I shall be eternally obliged--but if you  could tell--I have a father--just think how yours would feel. Louis,  will you, can you do this very great favor for me? I don't deserve any  mercy from you, I know; but you are better than I am.\"    All the bright visions of acknowledged innocence fled, and a blank  seemed to come over poor Louis' soul. The sacrifice seemed far too  great, and he felt as if he were not called to make it; and yet--a  glance at Ferrers' face--his distress, but not his meanness, struck  him. A minute before, he had indulged in bright dreams of more than  restoration to favor--of his brother's delight--of his father's and  mother's approbation--of his grandfather's satisfaction--and Hamilton's  friendly congratulations. And to give up this! it was surely too much  to expect.    During his silence, Ferrers kept squeezing, and even kissing, his now  cold hand, and repeating,    \"Dear Louis--be merciful--will you pity me?--think of all--I don't  deserve it, I know.\" And though the meanness and cowardliness were  apparent, Louis looked at little else than the extreme agony of the  suppliant.    \"Don't kiss my hand, Ferrers--I can't bear it,\" he said at length,  drawing his hand quickly away; and there was something akin to disgust  mingled with the sorrowful look he gave to his companion.    \"But Louis, will you?\"    \"Oh Ferrers! it is a hard thing to ask of me,\" said Louis, bitterly.    \"Just for a little longer,\" implored Ferrers, \"to save me from a  lasting disgrace.\"    Louis turned his head away--it was a hard, hard struggle: \"I will  try to bear it if God will help me,\" he said; \"I will not mention  it at present.\"    \"Oh! how can I thank you! how can I! how shall I ever be able!\"  cried Ferrers: \"but will Alfred tell?\"    \"He does not know,\" replied Louis, in a low tone.    \"But will he not mention what has passed?\"    \"I will warn him then,\" said Louis.    Ferrers then in broken sentences renewed his thanks, and Louis, after  hearing a few in silence, as if he heard nothing, turned his full moist  eyes on him with a sorrowful beseeching look,    \"You have done a very wicked thing, Ferrers. Oh do pray to God to  forgive you.\"    \"I will try to do any thing you wish,\" replied Ferrers.    \"A prayer because _I_ wished, could do you no good. You must feel you  have sinned against God. Do try to think of this. If it should make  you do so, I _think_ I could cheerfully bear this disgrace a little  longer for you, though what it is to bear I cannot tell you.\"    \"You are almost an angel, Louis!\" exclaimed Ferrers.    \"Oh don't say such things to me, Ferrers,\" said Louis, \"pray don't.  I am not more so than I was before this--I am but a sinful creature  like yourself, and it is the remembrance of this that makes me pity  you. Now do leave me alone; I cannot bear to hear you flatter me now.\"    Ferrers lingered yet, though Louis moved from him with a shuddering  abhorrence of the fawning, creeping manner of his school-fellow. Seeing  that Ferrers still loitered near him, he asked if there were any thing  more to say.    \"Will your brother know this?\"    \"Reginald?\" replied Louis. \"Of course--no--_I_ shall not tell him.\"    \"A thousand thousand times I thank you,--oh Louis, Louis, you are  too good!\"    \"Will you be kind enough to let me alone,\" said Louis gently,  but very decidedly.    This time the request was complied with, and Louis resumed his former  seat, and fixing his eyes vacantly on the sweet prospect before him,  ruminated with a full heart on the recent discovery; and, strange to  say, though he had voluntarily promised to screen Ferrers a little  longer from his justly merited disgrace, he felt as if it had been  only a compulsory sense of duty and not benevolence which had led him  to do so, and was inclined to murmur at his hard lot. For some time he  sat in a kind of sullen apathy, without being able to send up a prayer,  even though he felt he needed help to feel rightly. At length the kindly  tears burst forth, and covering his face with his hands he wept softly.  \"I am very wrong--very ungrateful to God for His love to me. He has borne  so much for me, and I am so unwilling to bear a little for poor Ferrers.  Oh what sinful feelings I have! My heavenly Father, teach me to feel pity  for him, for he has no one to help him; help him, teach him, Thyself.\"    Such, and many more, were the deep heart-breathings of the dear boy,  and who ever sought for guidance and grace, and was rejected? and how  unspeakably comfortable is the assurance, that for each of us there is  with Christ the very grace we need.    The sullen fit was gone, and Louis was his own happy self again, when  little Alfred came to tell him that Mr. Witworth had given the order to  return home,--\"And I came to tell you, dear Louis, for I wanted to walk  home with you. What a beast that Ferrers is! see if I won't tell Edward  of him.\"    \"Hush, Alfred!\" said Louis, putting his finger on the little boy's mouth.  \"Do you know that God is very angry when we call each other bad names,  and surely you do not wish to revenge yourself? I will tell you a very  sweet verse which our Saviour said: '_Love your enemies, bless them that  curse you, and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you,  that ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven._'\" As the  little monitor spoke, the soft consciousness of the comfort of those  sweet words rushed over his own mind, \"_children of your Father who is  in heaven_.\"    \"And am I a child--His child indeed! I will try to glorify my Saviour  who has given me that great name.\"    That is a sure promise that \"they who water shall be watered,\" and  who is there that has endeavored to lead another heavenward, that has  not felt, at one time or another, a double share of that living water  refreshing his own soul?    With one arm round his little friend's neck, Louis wandered home,  and, during the walk, easily persuaded Alfred not to say a word of  what had passed; and as for Louis--oh, his eye was brighter, his  step more buoyant, his heart full of gladness!    A little word, and I will close this long chapter. It is good for us  to consider how unable we are to think and to do rightly ourselves:  we must do so if we would be saved by Christ. When we have done all,  we are unprofitable servants; but oh, how gracious--how incomprehensible  is that love that puts into our minds good desires, brings the same to  good effect, and rewards us for those things which He Himself has enabled  us to do!          CHAPTER VIII.      \"Charity suffereth long, and is kind.\"--1 Cor. xiii. 4.      Louis entered the class-room sooner than usual one evening, and  sitting down by his brother, spread before him a few strawberries  and some sweet-cakes, inviting him and one of Salisbury's brothers  who was on the other side of him to partake of them.    \"What beauties they are!\" exclaimed John Salisbury; \"have you had a box,  Louis? How _did_ you get them?\"    \"Guess,\" said Louis.    \"Nay, I can't guess. Strawberries like these don't come at this time  of the year in boxes.\"    \"I guess,\" said Frank Digby from the opposite side of the table,  in a tone as if he had been speaking to some one behind him.  \"Fudge has a dinner party to-night, hasn't he?\"    \"Yes,\" said Louis, laughing; \"how did you know that?\"    \"Oh, I have the little green bird that tells every thing,\" replied Frank.    \"What's that, Frank?\" cried Salisbury; \"Fudge a dinner party? How snug  he's kept it!\"    \"Why you don't suppose that he's obliged to inform us all when he has  some idea of doing the genteel,\" remarked one of the first class.    \"Are Hamilton and Trevannion invited?\" asked Salisbury.    \"In good troth! thou art a bat of the most blind species,\" said Frank;  \"didn't you see them both just now in all their best toggery? Trevannion  went up to his room just after school, and has, I believe, at last  adorned his beauteous person to his mind--all graces and delicious  odors.--Faugh! he puts me in mind of a hair-dresser's shop.\"    \"He declares that his new perfumes are something expressly superior,\"  said another. \"_He_ wouldn't touch your vulgar scents.\"    \"His _millefleurs_ is at all events uncommonly like a muskrat,\"  said Salisbury.    \"And,\" remarked Frank, \"as that erudite youth, Oars, would say,  'puts me in mind of some poet, but I've forgotten his name.' However,  two lines borrowed from him, which my sister quotes to me when I am  genteel, will do as well as his name:        \"'I cannot talk with civet in the room--        A fine puss gentleman, that's all perfume.'\"    Reginald laughed. \"I often think of the overrun flower-pots in the  cottages at Dashwood, when Trevannion has been adorning himself.  I once mortally offended him by the same quotation.\"    \"Had you the amazing audacity! the intolerable presumption!\" cried  Frank, pretending to start. \"I perceive his magnificent scorn didn't  quite annihilate you; I think, though, he was three hours embellishing  himself to-night.\"    \"Frank, that's impossible!\" cried Louis, laughing, \"for it was four  o'clock when he went, and it's only half-past six now.\"    \"Cease your speech, and eat your booty: I dare say it is sweet enough;  sweetness is the usual concomitant of goods so obtained.\"    \"What do you mean, Frank?\" asked Louis.    \"Sweet little innocent; of course he don't know--no, in course he  don't--how should he? they came into his hand by accident,\" said Frank,  mockingly; \"I wish such fortunate accidents would happen to me.\"    \"The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19856"],[0,"A Study of Pueblo Architecture: Tusayan and Cibola (#15)"],[1,"trees, just  below the edge of the mesa and nearly opposite the center of the  village. These trees indicate the proximity of water, and mark the  probable site of the spring that furnished this village with at least  part of its water supply.    There are many fragments of pottery on this spot, but they are not so  abundant as at Awatubi.    Two partly excavated rooms were seen at this ruin, the work of some  earlier visitors who hoped to discover ethnologic or other treasure.    These afforded no special information, as the character of the masonry  exposed differed in no respect from that seen at other of the Tusayan  ruins. No traces of adobe construction or suggestions of foreign  influence were seen at this ruin.    SMALL RUIN BETWEEN HORN HOUSE AND BAT HOUSE.    On a prolongation of the mesa occupied by the Horn House, midway between  it and another ruined pueblo known as the Bat House, occur the remains  of a small and compact cluster of houses (Fig. 3). It is situated on the  very mesa edge, here about 40 feet high, at the head of a small canyon  which opens into the Jeditoh Valley, a quarter of a mile below.      [Illustration: Fig. 3. Ruin between Bat House and Horn House.]    The site affords an extended outlook to the south over a large part of  Jeditoh Valley. The topography about this point, which receives the  drainage of a considerable area of the mesa top, would fit it especially  for the establishment of a reservoir. This fact probably had much to do  with its selection as a dwelling site. The masonry is in about the same  state of preservation as that of the Horn House, and some of the stones  of the fallen walls seem to have been washed down from the mesa edge to  the talus below.    BAT HOUSE.    The Bat House is a ruin of nearly the same size as the Horn House,  although in its distribution it does not follow the mesa edge so closely  as the latter, and is not so elongated in its general form. The northern  portion is quite irregular, and the rooms seem to have been somewhat  crowded. The southern half, with only an occasional room traceable,  as indicated on the plan, Pl. VIII, still shows that the rooms were  distributed about a large open court.    The Bat House is situated on the northwest side of the Jeditoh Valley,  on part of the same mesa occupied by the two ruins described above. It  occupies the summit of a projecting spur, overlooking the main valley  for an extent of more than 5 miles. The ruin lies on the extreme edge of  the cliff, here about 200 feet high, and lying beneath it on the east  and south are large areas of arable land. Altogether it forms an  excellent defensive site, combined with a fair degree of convenience to  fields and water from the Tusayan point of view.    This ruin, near its northeastern extremity, contains a feature that is  quite foreign to the architecture of Tusayan, viz, a defensive wall.  It is the only instance of the use by the Hopituh of an inclosing wall,  though it is met with again at Payupki (Pl. XIII), which, however, was  built by people from the Rio Grande country.    MISHIPTONGA.    Mishiptonga is the Tusayan name for the southernmost, and by far the  largest, of the Jeditoh series of ruins (Pl. IX). It occurs quite close  to the Jeditoh spring which gives its name to the valley along whose  northern and western border are distributed the ruins above described,  beginning with the Horn house.      [Illustration: Plate XXI. View of Walpi.]    This village is rather more irregular in its arrangement than any other  of the series. There are indications of a number of courts inclosed by  large and small clusters of rooms, very irregularly disposed, but with a  general trend towards the northeast, being roughly parallel with the  mesa edge. In plan this village approaches somewhat that of the  inhabited Tusayan villages. At the extreme southern extremity of the  mesa promontory is a small secondary bench, 20 feet lower than the site  of the main village. This bench has also been occupied by a number of  houses. On the east side the pueblo was built to the very edge of the  bluff, where small fragments of masonry are still standing. The whole  village seems so irregular and crowded in its arrangement that it  suggests a long period of occupancy and growth, much more than do the  other villages of this (Jeditoh) group.    The pueblo may have been abandoned or destroyed prior to the advent of  the Spaniards in this country, as claimed by the Indians, for no  traditional mention of it is made in connection with the later feuds and  wars that figure so prominently in the Tusayan oral history of the last  three centuries. The pueblo was undoubtedly built by some of the ancient  gentes of the Tusayan stock, as its plan, the character of the site  chosen, and, where traceable, the quality of workmanship link it with  the other villages of the Jeditoh group.      [Illustration: Fig. 4. Ruin near Moen-kopi, plan.]    MOEN-KOPI RUINS.    A very small group of rooms, even smaller than the neighboring farming  pueblo of Moen-kopi, is situated on the western edge of the mesa summit  about a quarter of a mile north of the modern village of Moen-kopi. As  the plan shows (Fig. 4), the rooms were distributed in three rows around  a small court. This ruin also follows the general northeastern trend  which has been noticed both in the ruined and in the occupied pueblos of  Tusayan. The rows here were only one room deep and not more than a  single story high at any point, as indicated by the very small amount of  débris. As the plate shows, nearly the entire plan is clearly defined by  fragments of standing walls. The walls are built of thin tablets of the  dark-colored sandstone which caps the mesa. Where the walls have fallen  the débris is comparatively free from earth, indicating that adobe has  been sparingly used. The walls, in places standing to a height of 2 or 3  feet, as may be seen in the illustration, Pl. X, show unusual precision  of workmanship and finish, resembling in this respect some of the  ancient pueblos farther north. This is to some extent due to the  exceptional suitability of the tabular stones of the mesa summit. The  almost entire absence of pottery fragments and other objects of art  which are such a constant accompaniment of the ruins throughout this  region strongly suggest that it was occupied for a very short time. In  Chapter III it will be shown that a similar order of occupation took  place at Ojo Caliente, one of the Zuñi farming villages. This ruin is  probably of quite recent origin, as is the present village of Moen-kopi,  although it may possibly have belonged to an earlier colony of which  we have no distinct trace. This fertile and well watered valley, a  veritable garden spot in the Tusayan deserts, must have been one of the  first points occupied. Some small cliff-dwellings, single rooms in  niches of a neighboring canyon wall, attest the earlier use of the  valley for agricultural purposes, although it is doubtful whether these  rude shelters date back of the Spanish invasion of the province.    A close scrutiny of the many favorable sites in this vicinity would  probably reveal the sand-encumbered remains of some more important  settlement than any of those now known.    RUINS ON THE ORAIBI WASH.    The wagon road from Keam's Canyon to Tuba City crosses the Oraibi wash  at a point about 7 miles above the village of Oraibi. As it enters a  branch canyon on the west side of the wash it is flanked on each side by  rocky mesas and broken ledges. On the left or west side a bold  promontory, extending southward, is quite a conspicuous feature of the  landscape. The entire flat mesa summit, and much of the slope of a rocky  butte that rises from it, are covered with the remains of a small  pueblo, as shown on the plan, Fig. 5. All of this knoll except its  eastern side is lightly covered with scattered débris. On the west and  north sides there are many large masses of broken rock distributed over  the slope. There is no standing wall visible from below, but on closer  approach several interesting specimens of masonry are seen. On the north  side, near the west end, there is a fragment of curved wall which  follows the margin of the rock on which it is built. It is about 8 or 10  feet long and 3 feet high on the outer side. The curve is carefully  executed and the workmanship of the masonry good. Farther east, and  still on the north side, there is a fragment of masonry exhibiting a  reversed curve. This piece of wall spans the space between two adjoining  rocks, and the top of the wall is more than 10 feet above the rock on  which it stands. The shape of this wall and its relation to the  surroundings are indicated on the plan, Fig. 5. On the south side of the  ruin on the mesa surface, and near an outcropping rock, are the remains  of what appears to have been a circular room, perhaps 8 or 10 feet in  diameter, though it is too much broken down to determine this  accurately. Only a small portion of the south wall can be definitely  traced. On the south slope of the mesa are indications of walls, too  vaguely defined to admit of the determination of their direction.  Similar vestiges of masonry are found on the north and west, but not  extending to as great a distance from the knoll as those on the south.      [Illustration: Plate XXII. South passageway of Walpi.]      [Illustration: Fig. 5. Ruin 7 miles north of Oraibi.]    In that portion of the ruin which lies on top of the knoll, the walls so  far as traced conform to the shape of the site. The ground plan of the  buildings that once occupied the slopes can not be traced, and it is  impossible to determine whether its walls were carried through  continuously.    The masonry exhibited in the few surviving fragments of wall is of  unusually good quality, resembling somewhat that of the Fire House, Fig.  7, and other ruins of that class.
