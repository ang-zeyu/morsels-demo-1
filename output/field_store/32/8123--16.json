Reply Obj. 4: Some say that faith which is numbered among the  gratuitous graces is lifeless faith. But this is said without reason,  since the gratuitous graces, which are mentioned in that passage, are  not common to all the members of the Church: wherefore the Apostle  says: \"There are diversities of graces,\" and again, \"To one is given\"  this grace and \"to another\" that. Now lifeless faith is common to all  members of the Church, because its lifelessness is not part of its  substance, if we consider it as a gratuitous gift. We must,  therefore, say that in that passage, faith denotes a certain  excellency of faith, for instance, \"constancy in faith,\" according  to a gloss, or the \"word of faith.\"    Faith is numbered among the fruits, in so far as it gives a certain  pleasure in its act by reason of its certainty, wherefore the gloss  on the fifth chapter to the Galatians, where the fruits are  enumerated, explains faith as being \"certainty about the unseen.\"  _______________________    SIXTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 4, Art. 6]    Whether Faith Is One Virtue?    Objection 1: It would seem that faith is not one. For just as faith  is a gift of God according to Eph. 2:8, so also wisdom and knowledge  are numbered among God's gifts according to Isa. 11:2. Now wisdom and  knowledge differ in this, that wisdom is about eternal things, and  knowledge about temporal things, as Augustine states (De Trin. xii,  14, 15). Since, then, faith is about eternal things, and also about  some temporal things, it seems that faith is not one virtue, but  divided into several parts.    Obj. 2: Further, confession is an act of faith, as stated above (Q.  3, A. 1). Now confession of faith is not one and the same for all:  since what we confess as past, the fathers of old confessed as yet  to come, as appears from Isa. 7:14: \"Behold a virgin shall conceive.\"  Therefore faith is not one.    Obj. 3: Further, faith is common to all believers in Christ. But one  accident cannot be in many subjects. Therefore all cannot have one  faith.    _On the contrary,_ The Apostle says (Eph. 4:5): \"One Lord, one faith.\"    _I answer that,_ If we take faith as a habit, we can consider it in  two ways. First on the part of the object, and thus there is one  faith. Because the formal object of faith is the First Truth, by  adhering to which we believe whatever is contained in the faith.  Secondly, on the part of the subject, and thus faith is  differentiated according as it is in various subjects. Now it is  evident that faith, just as any other habit, takes its species from  the formal aspect of its object, but is individualized by its  subject. Hence if we take faith for the habit whereby we believe, it  is one specifically, but differs numerically according to its various  subjects.    If, on the other hand, we take faith for that which is believed,  then, again, there is one faith, since what is believed by all is one  same thing: for though the things believed, which all agree in  believing, be diverse from one another, yet they are all reduced to  one.    Reply Obj. 1: Temporal matters which are proposed to be believed, do  not belong to the object of faith, except in relation to something  eternal, viz. the First Truth, as stated above (Q. 1, A. 1). Hence  there is one faith of things both temporal and eternal. It is  different with wisdom and knowledge, which consider temporal and  eternal matters under their respective aspects.    Reply Obj. 2: This difference of past and future arises, not from  any difference in the thing believed, but from the different  relationships of believers to the one thing believed, as also we  have mentioned above (I-II, Q. 103, A. 4; I-II, Q. 107, A. 1, ad 1).    Reply Obj. 3: This objection considers numerical diversity of faith.  _______________________    SEVENTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 4, Art. 7]    Whether Faith Is the First of the Virtues?    Objection 1: It would seem that faith is not the first of the virtues.  For a gloss on Luke 12:4, \"I say to you My friends,\" says that  fortitude is the foundation of faith. Now the foundation precedes that  which is founded thereon. Therefore faith is not the first of the  virtues.    Obj. 2: Further, a gloss on Ps. 36, \"Be not emulous,\" says that hope  \"leads on to faith.\" Now hope is a virtue, as we shall state further  on (Q. 17, A. 1). Therefore faith is not the first of the virtues.    Obj. 3: Further, it was stated above (A. 2) that the intellect of the  believer is moved, out of obedience to God, to assent to matters of  faith. Now obedience also is a virtue. Therefore faith is not the  first virtue.    Obj. 4: Further, not lifeless but living faith is the foundation, as  a gloss remarks on 1 Cor. 3:11 [*Augustine, De Fide et Oper. xvi.].  Now faith is formed by charity, as stated above (A. 3). Therefore it  is owing to charity that faith is the foundation: so that charity is  the foundation yet more than faith is (for the foundation is the  first part of a building) and consequently it seems to precede faith.    Obj. 5: Further, the order of habits is taken from the order of acts.  Now, in the act of faith, the act of the will which is perfected by  charity, precedes the act of the intellect, which is perfected by  faith, as the cause which precedes its effect. Therefore charity  precedes faith. Therefore faith is not the first of the virtues.    _On the contrary,_ The Apostle says (Heb. 11:1) that \"faith is the  substance of things to be hoped for.\" Now the substance of a thing is  that which comes first. Therefore faith is first among the virtues.    _I answer that,_ One thing can precede another in two ways: first, by  its very nature; secondly, by accident. Faith, by its very nature,  precedes all other virtues. For since the end is the principle in  matters of action, as stated above (I-II, Q. 13, A. 3; I-II, Q. 34,  A. 4, ad 1), the theological virtues, the object of which is the last  end, must needs precede all the others. Again, the last end must of  necessity be present to the intellect before it is present to the  will, since the will has no inclination for anything except in so far  as it is apprehended by the intellect. Hence, as the last end is  present in the will by hope and charity, and in the intellect, by  faith, the first of all the virtues must, of necessity, be faith,  because natural knowledge cannot reach God as the object of heavenly  bliss, which is the aspect under which hope and charity tend towards  Him.    On the other hand, some virtues can precede faith accidentally. For  an accidental cause precedes its effect accidentally. Now that which  removes an obstacle is a kind of accidental cause, according to the  Philosopher (Phys. viii, 4): and in this sense certain virtues may be  said to precede faith accidentally, in so far as they remove  obstacles to belief. Thus fortitude removes the inordinate fear that  hinders faith; humility removes pride, whereby a man refuses to  submit himself to the truth of faith. The same may be said of some  other virtues, although there are no real virtues, unless faith be  presupposed, as Augustine states (Contra Julian. iv, 3).    This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.    Reply Obj. 2: Hope cannot lead to faith absolutely. For one cannot  hope to obtain eternal happiness, unless one believes this possible,  since hope does not tend to the impossible, as stated above (I-II, Q.  40, A. 1). It is, however, possible for one to be led by hope to  persevere in faith, or to hold firmly to faith; and it is in this  sense that hope is said to lead to faith.    Reply Obj. 3: Obedience is twofold: for sometimes it denotes the  inclination of the will to fulfil God's commandments. In this way it  is not a special virtue, but is a general condition of every virtue;  since all acts of virtue come under the precepts of the Divine law,  as stated above (I-II, Q. 100, A. 2); and thus it is requisite for  faith. In another way, obedience denotes an inclination to fulfil the  commandments considered as a duty. In this way it is a special  virtue, and a part of justice: for a man does his duty by his  superior when he obeys him: and thus obedience follows faith, whereby  man knows that God is his superior, Whom he must obey.    Reply Obj. 4: To be a foundation a thing requires not only to come  first, but also to be connected with the other parts of the building:  since the building would not be founded on it unless the other parts  adhered to it. Now the connecting bond of the spiritual edifice is  charity, according to Col. 3:14: \"Above all . . . things have charity  which is the bond of perfection.\" Consequently faith without charity  cannot be the foundation: and yet it does not follow that charity  precedes faith.    Reply Obj. 5: Some act of the will is required before faith, but not  an act of the will quickened by charity. This latter act presupposes  faith, because the will cannot tend to God with perfect love, unless  the intellect possesses right faith about Him.  _______________________    EIGHTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 4, Art. 8]    Whether Faith Is More Certain Than Science and the Other Intellectual  Virtues?    Objection 1: It would seem that faith is not more certain than  science and the other intellectual virtues. For doubt is opposed to  certitude, wherefore a thing would seem to be the more certain,  through being less doubtful, just as a thing is the whiter, the less  it has of an admixture of black. Now understanding, science and also  wisdom are free of any doubt about their objects; whereas the  believer may sometimes suffer a movement of doubt, and doubt about  matters of faith. Therefore faith is no more certain than the  intellectual virtues.    Obj. 2: Further, sight is more certain than hearing. But \"faith is  through hearing\" according to Rom. 10:17; whereas"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18757"],[0,"Prince Henry the Navigator, the Hero of Portugal and of Modern Discovery, (#15)"],[1,"first seen in the Scotch and Irish seas. Their discovery  of the White Sea, the North Cape, and the gulfs of Bothnia and Finland  was followed up by many Norsemen, such as Thorer Hund under St. Olaf, in  the next one hundred and fifty years,[21] but Ohthere's voyage was the  first and chief of these adventures both in motive and result.    [Footnote 21: And a certain number of Viking sailors seem to have  preceded Ohthere on his voyage to the Dwina.]    \"He told his lord King Alfred that he dwelt northmost of all Northmen on  the land by the Western Sea and he wished to find how far the land lay  right north, or whether any man dwelt north of the waste. So he went  right north near the land;--for three days he left the waste land on the  right and the wide sea on the left, as far as the whale hunters ever  go\"; and still he kept north three days more (to the North Cape of  Europe).    \"Then the land bent right east, and with a west wind he sailed four days  till the land bent south, and he sailed by it five days more to a great  river--the Dwina--that lay up into the land, and where beyond the river  it was all inhabited\"--the modern country of Perm and Archangel.    Here he trafficked with the people, the first he had met, except the  Finn hunters, since leaving his fiord. Besides his wish to see the  country, he was looking for walrus-ivory and hides.    The Finns and Biarma-men (men of Archangel), it seemed to him, spoke  nearly the same language, but between his home and this Biarmaland no  human being lived in any fixed dwelling, and all the Northman's land was  long and narrow and thinly peopled, decreasing in breadth as it  stretched northward, from sixty to three days' journey.    Again Alfred told how Ohthere, sailing south for a month from his house,  having _Ireland_ on his right and coasting Norway all the time on his  left, came to Jutland, \"where a great sea runs up into the land, so vast  that no man can see across it,\" whence in five days more he reached the  coast, \"from which the English came to Britain.\"    Wulfstan, in the service of the same king, told him how he sailed in  seven days from Sleswick to Truso and the Vistula, having Wendland (or  Pomerania and Prussia) on his right all the way. He described \"Witland  near the Vistula and Estland and Wendland and Estmere and the Ilfing  running from the Truso lake into Eastmere,\" but neither the king nor his  captains knew enough to contradict the old idea, found in Ptolemy and  Strabo, of Scandinavia as one vast island.    Thus it was for the satisfaction of their Saxon Lord that Wulfstan and  Ohthere, by their voyages along the coasts of Norway and Lapland, of  Pomerania and Prussia, round the White Sea and the Gulf of Riga and  southern Finland, added a more coherent view of north-east Europe, and  specially of the Baltic Gulf, to Western geography; but these Norse  discoveries, though in the service of an English king, were scarcely  used save by Norsemen, and they must partly go to the credit of Vikings,  as well as of Alfred the Great. Thus in 965 King Harold Grayskin of  Norway \"went and fought with the folk on the banks of the Dwina,\" and  plundered them, and in 1026 Thorer Hund joined himself to a fleet sent  by St. Olaf to the White Sea, pillaged the temple of the idol Jomala,  and destroyed his countrymen by treachery on their way home. Where two  expeditions are recorded they may well stand for twenty unknown and  uneventful ones, and the same must be equally granted as to the gradual  advance of knowledge through the unceasing attacks of the Norse kings  and pirates on the lands to the south of the Baltic, where lived the  Wends.    Thus on the west and east, north-west and north-east, the Northmen could  and did make a definite advance into the unknown; even the south-west  lines of Northern invasion and settlement, though they hardly yield any  general results to discovery, certainly led to a more thorough inclusion  of every part of the British isles in the civilised West, through the  Viking earldoms in Caithness, in the Orkneys and the Shetlands, in Man  and the Hebrides, and on the coast of Ireland, where the Ostman colonies  grew into kingdoms. From about 840, when the first of these settlements  was fairly and permanently started, to the eleventh century, when a  series of great defeats,--by Brian Boru at Clontarf in 1014, by Godwine  and Harold in England from 1042 to 1066, and by the Norman and Scottish  kings in the next generation,--practically destroyed the Norse dominion  outside the Orkneys,--for those two hundred years, Danes and Northmen  not only pillaged and colonised, but ruled and reorganised a good half  of the British isles.    By the time of Alfred the Viking principalities were scattered up and  down the northern and western coasts of the greater of our two islands,  and were fringing three sides of the lesser. About A.D. 900 the pioneer  of the Norse kings, Harold Fair-hair, pursued his traitors, first to  Shetlands and Orkneys, then to Caithness, the Hebrides, and Man. His son  Eric, who followed him, ranged the Northern seas from Archangel to  Bordeaux, and so Hakon the Good in 936 and other Norse princes in 946,  961, 965, above all, the two great Kings Olaf in 985-9 and 1009-14,  fought and triumphed through most of the world as known to the Northmen.  Thus, Frankland, England, Ireland, Scotland were brought into a closer  unity through the common danger, while as the sea-kings founded settled  states, and these grew by alliance, first with one another and then with  their older Christian victims, as the Norse kingdoms themselves became  parts of Latin Christendom, after Latin Christendom had itself been  revived and re-awakened by their attacks, the full value of the time of  trial came out on both sides, to conquered and to conquerors.    For the effects--formative, invigorative, provocative,--of the Northern  invasions had a most direct bearing on the expansion that was to come in  the next age even for those staid and sober Western countries, England  and France and Italy, which had long passed through their time of  migration, and where the Vikings could not, as in the far north-east and  north-west, extend the area of civilisation or geographical knowledge.    Lastly, the new start made by England in exploration, and trade, and  even in pilgrimage, is plainly the result--in action and reaction--of  the Norse and Danish attacks, waking up the old spirit of a kindred  race, of elder cousins that had sunk into lethargy and forgotten their  seamanship.    But from the Peace of Wedmore (878) Alfred first of all began to build  an English navy able to meet and chase and run down the Viking keels;  then established a yearly pilgrimage and alms-giving at the Threshold of  the Apostles in Rome; then sent out various captains in his service to  explore as much of the world as was practicable for his new description  of Europe. His crowning effort in religious extension was in 883, when  Sigehelm and Athelstan bore Alfred's gifts and letters to Jerusalem and  to India, to the Christians of San Thome; the corresponding triumph of  the King's scientific exploration, the discoveries in the White Sea and  the Baltic, seem to have happened nearer the end of the reign, somewhere  before 895.          CHAPTER III.    THE CRUSADES AND LAND TRAVEL.    CIRCA 1100-1300.      The pilgrims were the pioneers of the growth of Europe and of  Christendom until Charlemagne, in one sense, in another and a broader  sense until the Crusades.    Their original work, as far as it can be called original at all, was  entirely overshadowed by the Vikings, who made real discoveries of the  first importance in hunting for new worlds to conquer; but when first  the Viking rovers themselves, and then the Northmen, settled in the  colonies and the old home, took up Christianity as the Arabs had taken  up Islam, the pilgrim spirit was translated, as it were, into new and  more powerful forms. Through the conversion of Hungary and of  Scandinavia,[22]--Europe, Christian Europe, was compacted together in a  stronger Empire than that of Constantine or of Charlemagne--a spiritual  federation, not a political unity--one and undivided not in visible  subordination, but in a common zeal for a common faith. This was the  state of the Latin world, and in a measure of the Greek and Russian  world as well, by the middle of the eleventh century, when the Byzantine  Emperors had broken the strength of the Eastern Caliphate, and recovered  most of the realm of Heraclius; when the Roman Papacy under Leo IX.,  Hildebrand, and Urban began its political stage, aiming, and in great  part successfully aiming, at an Imperial Federation of Europe under  religion; when on every side, in Spain, in France, in England, in  Germany, and in Italy, the nations that had been slowly built into that  _Domus Dei_ were filled with fresh life and purpose from the Norsemen,  who, as pirates, or conquerors, or brothers, had settled among them. The  long crusade that had gone on for four hundred years in Spain and in  southern Italy and in the Levant, which had raged round the islands of  the Mediterranean, or the passes of the Alps and Pyrenees, or the banks  of the Loire and the Tiber,--was now, on the eve of the first Syrian  Crusade of 1096, rapidly tending to decisive victory. Toledo was won  back in 1084; the Norman dominion in the Two Sicilies had already taken  the place of a weak and halting Christian defence against Arab emirs;  pilgrims were going in thousands where there had been tens or units by  the reopened land route through Hungary; only in the far East the first  appearance of the Turks as Moslem champions,[23] threatened an ebb of  the tide. Christendom had seen a wonderful expansion of the Heathen  North; now that it had won the Northmen to itself, it was ready to  imitate their example.
