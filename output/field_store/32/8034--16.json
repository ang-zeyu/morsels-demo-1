Despair lent him strength to walk,  and to carry his burden. On his way, he passed a house, about which there  was a crowd. He drew nigh, asked what was going on, and received for an  answer, that there was to be a sale of many specimens of art, collected by  an amateur in the course of thirty years. It has often happened that  collections made with infinite pains by the proprietor, have been sold  without mercy or discrimination after his death.    Something whispered to the weary Duhobret, that here would be the market  for his picture. It was a long way yet to the house of the picture dealer,  and he made up his mind at once. He worked his way through the crowd,  dragged himself up the steps, and, after many inquiries, found the  auctioneer. That personage was a busy man, with a handful of papers; he  was inclined to notice somewhat roughly the interruption of the lean,  sallow hunchback, imploring as were his gesture and language.    \"What do you call your picture?\" at length, said he, carefully looking at  it.    \"It is a view of the Abbey of Newburg, with its village and the  surrounding landscape,\" replied the eager and trembling artist.    The auctioneer again scanned it contemptuously, and asked what it was  worth. \"Oh, that is what you please; whatever it will bring,\" answered  Duhobret.    \"Hem! it is too odd to please, I should think; I can promise you no more  than three thalers.\"    Poor Samuel sighed deeply. He had spent on that piece the nights of many  months. But he was starving now; and the pitiful sum offered would give  bread for a few days. He nodded his head to the auctioneer, and retiring  took his seat in a corner.    The sale began. After some paintings and engravings had been disposed of,  Samuel's was exhibited. \"Who bids at three thalers? Who bids?\" was the  cry. Duhobret listened eagerly, but none answered. \"Will it find a  purchaser?\" said he despondingly, to himself. Still there was a dead  silence. He dared not look up; for it seemed to him that all the people  were laughing at the folly of the artist, who could be insane enough to  offer so worthless a piece at a public sale.    \"What will become of me?\" was his mental inquiry. \"That work is certainly  my best;\" and he ventured to steal another glance. \"Does it not seem that  the wind actually stirs those boughs and moves those leaves! How  transparent is the water! What life breathes in the animals that quench  their thirst at that spring! How that steeple shines! How beautiful are  those clustering trees!\" This was the last expiring throb of an artist's  vanity. The ominous silence continued, and Samuel, sick at heart, buried  his face in his hands.    \"Twenty-one thalers!\" murmured a faint voice, just as the auctioneer was  about to knock down the picture. The stupefied painter gave a start of  joy. He raised his head and looked to see from whose lips those blessed  words had come. It was the picture dealer, to whom he had first thought of  applying.    \"Fifty thalers,\" cried a sonorous voice. This time a tall man in black was  the speaker. There was a silence of hushed expectation. \"One hundred  thalers,\" at length thundered the picture dealer.    \"Three hundred!\" \"Five hundred!\" \"One thousand!\" Another profound silence,  and the crowd pressed around the two opponents, who stood opposite each  other with eager and angry looks.    \"Two thousand thalers!\" cried the picture dealer, and glanced around him  triumphantly, when he saw his adversary hesitate. \"Ten thousand!\"  vociferated the tall man, his face crimson with rage, and his hands  clinched convulsively. The dealer grew paler; his frame shook with  agitation; he made two or three efforts, and at last cried out \"Twenty  thousand!\"    His tall opponent was not to be vanquished. He bid forty thousand. The  dealer stopped; the other laughed a low laugh of insolent triumph, and a  murmur of admiration was heard in the crowd. It was too much for the  dealer; he felt his peace was at stake. \"Fifty thousand!\" exclaimed he in  desperation. It was the tall man's turn to hesitate. Again the whole crowd  were breathless. At length, tossing his arms in defiance, he shouted \"One  hundred thousand!\" The crestfallen picture dealer withdrew; the tall man  victoriously bore away the prize.    How was it, meanwhile, with Duhobret, while this exciting scene was going  on? He was hardly master of his senses. He rubbed his eyes repeatedly, and  murmured to himself, \"After such a dream, my misery will seem more cruel!\"  When the contest ceased, he rose up bewildered, and went about asking  first one, then another, the price of the picture just sold. It seemed  that his apprehension could not at once be enlarged to so vast a  conception.    The possessor was proceeding homeward, when a decrepit, lame, and  humpbacked invalid, tottering along by the aid of a stick, presented  himself before him. He threw him a piece of money, and waved his hand as  dispensing with his thanks. \"May it please your honor,\" said the supposed  beggar, \"I am the painter of that picture!\" and again he rubbed his eyes.    The tall mall was Count Dunkelsback, one of the richest noblemen in  Germany. He stopped, took out his pocketbook, took out a leaf, and wrote  on it a few lines. \"Take it, friend,\" said he; \"it is a check for your  money. Adieu.\"    Duhobret finally persuaded himself that it was not a dream. He became the  master of a castle, sold it, and resolved to live luxuriously for the rest  of his life, and to cultivate painting as a pastime. But, alas, for the  vanity of human expectation! He had borne privation and toil; prosperity  was too much for him, as was proved soon after, when an indigestion  carried him off. His picture remained long in the cabinet of Count  Dunkelsback, and afterward passed into the possession of the King of  Bavaria.    Notes.--Albert Durer (b. 1471, d. 1528) lived at Nuremburg, Germany. He  was eminent as a painter, and as an engraver on copper and wood. He was  one of the first artists who studied anatomy and perspective. His  influence on art is clearly felt even at the present day.    Newburg, or Neuburg, is on the Danube, fifty miles south of Nuremburg.  Bergen Abbey was north of the village.        X. PICTURES OF MEMORY. (88)    Alice Cary, 1820-1871, was born near Cincinnati. One of her ancestors was  among the \"Pilgrim Fathers,\" and the first instructor of Latin at  Plymouth, Mass. Miss Cary commenced her literary career at her western  home, and, in 1849, published a volume of poems, the joint work of her  younger sister, Phoebe, and herself. In 1850, she moved to New York. Two  of her sisters joined her there, and they supported themselves by their  literary labor. Their home became a noted resort for their literary and  artistic friends. Miss Cary was the author of eleven volumes, besides many  articles contributed to periodicals. Her poetry is marked with great  sweetness and pathos. Some of her prose works are much admired, especially  her \"Clovernook Children.\"  ###      Among the beautiful pictures    That hang on Memory's wall,  Is one of a dim old forest,    That seemeth best of all;  Not for its gnarled oaks olden,    Dark with the mistletoe;  Not for the violets golden,    That sprinkle the vale below;  Not for the milk-white lilies,    That lean from the fragrant hedge,  Coquetting all day with the sunbeams,    And stealing their golden edge;  Not for the vines on the upland,    Where the bright red berries rest,  Nor the pinks, nor the pale, sweet cowslip,    It seemeth to me the best.    I once had a little brother,    With eyes that were dark and deep;  In the lap of that dim old forest,    He lieth in peace asleep:  Light as the down of the thistle,    Free as the winds that blow,  We roved there the beautiful summers,    The summers of long ago;  But his feet on the hills grew weary,    And, one of the autumn eves,  I made for my little brother,    A bed of the yellow leaves.    Sweetly his pale arms folded    My neck in a meek embrace,  As the light of immortal beauty    Silently covered his face;  And when the arrows of sunset    Lodged in the tree tops bright,  He fell, in his saintlike beauty,    Asleep by the gates of light.  Therefore, of all the pictures    That hang on Memory's wall,  The one of the dim old forest    Seemeth the best of all.        XI. THE MORNING ORATORIO. (90)    Wilson Flagg, 1806-1884, was born in Beverly, Mass. He pursued his  academical course in Andover, at Phillips Academy, and entered Harvard  College, but did not graduate. His chief Works are: \"Studies in the Field  and Forest,\" \"The Woods and Byways of New England,\" and \"The Birds and  Seasons of New England.\"  ###      Nature, for the delight of waking eyes, has arrayed the morning heavens in  the loveliest hues of beauty. Fearing to dazzle by an excess of delight,  she first announces day by a faint and glimmering twilight, then sheds a  purple tint over the brows of the rising morn, and infuses a transparent  ruddiness throughout the atmosphere. As daylight widens, successive groups  of mottled and rosy-bosomed clouds assemble on the gilded sphere, and,  crowned with wreaths of fickle rainbows, spread a mirrored flush over  hill, grove, and lake, and every village spire is burnished with their  splendor.    At length, through crimsoned vapors, we behold the sun's broad disk,  rising with a countenance so serene that every eye may view him ere he  arrays himself in his meridian brightness. Not many people who live in  towns are aware of the pleasure attending a ramble near the woods and  orchards at daybreak in the early part of summer. The drowsiness we feel  on rising from our beds is gradually dispelled by the clear and healthful  breezes of early day, and we soon experience an unusual amount of vigor  and elasticity.    During the night, the stillness of all things is the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16767"],[0,"Half-hours with the Telescope (#15)"],[1,"(given in the  almanac). By a little ingenuity it may be applied as well to morning as  to evening observations, the sun's passage of the cross-rod being taken  on one morning and Mercury's on the next, so many minutes _before_ the  hour of the first observation. In this way several views of Mercury may  be obtained during the year.    Such methods may appear very insignificant to the systematic observer  with the equatorial, but that they are effective I can assert from my  own experience. Similar methods may be applied to determine from the  position of a known object, that of any neighbouring unknown object even  at night. The cross-rod must be shifted (or else two cross-rods used)  when the unknown _precedes_ the known object. If two cross-rods are  used, account must be taken of the gradual diminution in the length of a  degree of right ascension as we leave the equator.    Even simpler methods carefully applied may serve to give a view of  Mercury. To show this, I may describe how I obtained my first view of  this planet. On June 1st, 1863, I noticed, that at five minutes past  seven the sun, as seen from my study window, appeared from behind the  gable-end of Mr. St. Aubyn's house at Stoke, Devon. I estimated the  effect of Mercury's northerly declination (different of course for a  vertical wall, than for the cross-rod in fig. 8, which, in fact, agrees  with a declination-circle), and found that he would pass out opposite a  particular point of the wall a certain time after the sun. I then turned  the telescope towards that point, and focussed for distinct vision of  distant objects, so that the outline of the house was seen out of focus.  As the calculated time of apparition approached, I moved the telescope  up and down so that the field swept the neighbourhood of the estimated  point of apparition. I need hardly say that Mercury did not appear  exactly at the assigned point, nor did I see him make his first  appearance; but I picked him up so soon after emergence that the outline  of the house was in the field of view with him. He appeared as a  half-disc. I followed him with the telescope until the sun had set, and  soon after I was able to see him very distinctly with the naked eye. He  shone with a peculiar brilliance on the still bright sky; but although  perfectly distinct to the view when his place was indicated, he escaped  detection by the undirected eye.[12]    Mercury does not present any features of great interest in ordinary  telescopes; though he usually appears better defined than Venus, at  least as the latter is seen on a dark sky. The phases are pleasingly  seen (as shown in Plate 6) with a telescope of moderate power. For their  proper observation, however, the planet must be looked for with the  telescope in the manner above indicated, as he always shows a nearly  semi-circular disc when he is visible to the naked eye.    We come next to Venus, the most splendid of all the planets to the eye.  In the telescope Venus disappoints the observer, however. Her intense  lustre brings out every defect of the instrument, and especially the  chromatic aberration. A dark glass often improves the view, but not  always. Besides, an interposed glass has an unpleasant effect on the  field of view.    Perhaps the best method of observing Venus is to search for her when she  is still high above the horizon, and when therefore the background of  the sky is bright enough to take off the planet's glare. The method I  have described for the observation of Mercury will prove very useful in  the search for Venus when the sun is above the horizon or but just set.  Of course, when an object is to be looked for high above the horizon,  the two rods which support the cross-rods must not be upright, but  square to the line of view to that part of the sky.    But the observer must not expect to see much during his observation of  Venus. In fact, he can scarcely do more than note her varying phases  (see Plate 6) and the somewhat uneven boundary of the terminator. Our  leading observers have done so little with this fascinating but  disappointing planet, that amateurs must not be surprised at their own  failure.    I suppose the question whether Venus has a satellite, or at any rate  whether the object supposed to have been seen by Cassini and other old  observers were a satellite, must be considered as decided in the  negative. That Cassini should have seen an object which Dawes and Webb  have failed to see must be considered utterly improbable.    Leaving the inferior planets, we come to a series of important and  interesting objects.    First we have the planet Mars, nearly the last in the scale of planetary  magnitude, but far from being the least interesting of the planets. It  is in fact quite certain that we obtain a better view of Mars than of  any object in the heavens, save the Moon alone. He may present a less  distinguished appearance than Jupiter or Saturn, but we see his surface  on a larger scale than that of either of those giant orbs, even if we  assume that we ever obtain a fair view of their real surface.    Nor need the moderately armed observer despair of obtaining interesting  views of Mars. The telescope with which Beer and Maedler made their  celebrated series of views was only a 4-inch one, so that with a 3-inch  or even a 2-inch aperture the attentive observer may expect interesting  views. In fact, more depends on the observer than on the instrument. A  patient and attentive scrutiny will reveal features which at the first  view wholly escape notice.    In Plate 6 I have given a series of views of Mars much more distinct  than an observer may expect to obtain with moderate powers. I add a  chart of Mars, a miniature of one I have prepared from a charming  series of tracings supplied me by Mr. Dawes. The views taken by this  celebrated observer in 1852, 1856, 1860, 1862, and 1864, are far better  than any others I have seen. The views by Beer and Maedler are good, as  are some of Secchi's (though they appear badly drawn), Nasmyth's and  Phillips'; Delarue's two views are also admirable; and Lockyer has given  a better set of views than any of the others. But there is an amount of  detail in Mr. Dawes' views which renders them superior to any yet taken.  I must confess I failed at a first view to see the full value of Mr.  Dawes' tracings. Faint marks appeared, which I supposed to be merely  intended to represent shadings scarcely seen. A more careful study  shewed me that every mark is to be taken as the representative of what  Mr. Dawes actually saw. The consistency of the views is perfectly  wonderful, when compared with the vagueness and inconsistency observable  in nearly all other views. And this consistency is not shown by mere  resemblance, which might have been an effect rather of memory  (unconsciously exerted) than observation. The same feature changes so  much in figure, as it appears on different parts of the disc, that it  was sometimes only on a careful projection of different views that I  could determine what certain features near the limb represented. But  when this had been done, and the distortion through the effect of  foreshortening corrected, the feature was found to be as true in shape  as if it had been seen in the centre of the planet's disc.    In examining Mr. Dawes' drawings it was necessary that the position of  Mars' axis should be known. The data for determining this were taken  from Dr. Oudemann's determinations given in a valuable paper on Mars  issued from Mr. Bishop's observatory. But instead of calculating Mars'  presentation by the formulae there given, I found it convenient rather to  make use of geometrical constructions applied to my 'Charts of the  Terrestrial Planets.' Taking Maedler's start-point for Martial  longitudes, that is the longitude-line passing near Dawes' forked bay, I  found that my results agreed pretty fairly with those in Prof. Phillips'  map, so far as the latter went; but there are many details in my charts  not found in Prof. Phillips' nor in Maedler's earlier charts.    I have applied to the different features the names of those observers  who have studied the physical peculiarities presented by Mars. Mr.  Dawes' name naturally occurs more frequently than others. Indeed, if I  had followed the rule of giving to each feature the name of its  discoverer, Mr. Dawes' name would have occurred much more frequently  than it actually does.    On account of the eccentricity of his orbit, Mars is seen much better in  some oppositions than in others. When best seen the southern hemisphere  is brought more into view than the northern because the summer of his  northern hemisphere occurs when he is nearly in aphelion (as is the case  with the Earth by the way).    The relative dimensions and presentation of Mars, as seen in opposition  in perihelion, and in opposition in aphelion, are shown in the two rows  of figures.    In and near quadrature Mars is perceptibly gibbous. He is seen thus  about two months before or after opposition. In the former case, he  rises late and comes to the meridian six hours or so after midnight. In  the latter case, he is well seen in the evening, coming to the meridian  at six. His appearance and relative dimensions as he passes from  opposition to quadrature are shown in the last three figures of the  upper row.    Mars' polar caps may be seen with very moderate powers.    I add four sets of meridians (Plate 6), by filling in which from the  charts the observer may obtain any number of views of the planet as it  appears at different times.    Passing over the asteroids, which are not very interesting objects to  the amateur telescopist, we come to Jupiter, the giant of the solar  system, surpassing our Earth more than 1400 times in volume, and  overweighing all the planets taken together twice over.    Jupiter is one of the easiest of all objects of telescopic observation.  No one can mistake this orb"]]]
