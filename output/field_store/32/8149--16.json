The _cuisine_ of the country does not tempt the  stomach to repletion, and the climate is decidedly peptic. So the  typhoid fever of Quito is due to filth, poor diet, and want of  ventilation. Corpulency, especially among the men, is astonishingly  rare.    According to Dr. Lombard, mountain districts favor the development of  diseases of the heart; and contagious diseases are not arrested by the  atmosphere of lofty regions. This is true in Quito. But while nervous  diseases are rare in the inhabited highlands of Europe, in Quito they  are common. Sleep is said to be more tranquil and refreshing, and the  circulation more regular at high altitudes; but our experience does not  sustain this. Goitre is quite common among the mountains. It is a sign  of constitutional weakness, for the children of goitred parents are  usually deaf and dumb, and the succeeding generation idiots.  Boussingault thinks it is owing to the lack of atmospheric air in the  water; but why is it nearly confined to the women? In the southern  provinces about Cuenca, cutaneous affections are quite frequent. In the  highlands generally, scrofulous diseases are more common than in the  plains. There are three hospitals for lepers; one at Cuenca with two  hundred patients, one at Quito with one hundred and twelve patients, and  one at Ambato. Near Riobamba is a community of dwarfs.    D'Orbigny made a _post-mortem_ examination of some Indians from the  highest regions, and found the lungs of extraordinary dimensions, the  cells larger and more in number. Hence the unnatural proportion of the  trunk, which is plainly out of harmony with the extremities. The  expanded chest of the mountaineers is evidently the result of larger  inspirations to secure the requisite amount of oxygen, which is much  less in a given space at Quito than on the coast. This is an instance,  observes Prichard, of long-continued habit, and the result of external  agencies modifying the structure of the body, and with it the state of  the most important functions of life. We tried the experiment of burning  a candle one hour at Guayaquil, and another part of the same candle for  the same period at Quito. Temperature at Guayaquil, 80 deg.; at Quito, 62 deg..  The loss at Guayaquil was 140 grains; at Quito, 114, or 26 grains less  at the elevation of 9500 feet. Acoustics will also illustrate the  thinness of the air. M. Godin found (1745) that a nine-pounder could not  be heard at the distance of 121,537 feet; and that an eight-pounder at  Paris, at the distance of 102,664 feet, was louder than a nine-pounder  at Quito at the distance of 67,240 feet.    According to Dr. Archibald Smith, the power of muscular exertion in a  native of the coast is greatly increased by living at the height of  10,000 feet. But it is also asserted by observing travelers that dogs  and bulls lose their combativeness at 12,000 feet, and that hence there  can never be a good bull-fight or dog-fight on the Sierras. This is  literally true: the dogs seem to partake of the tameness of their  masters. Cats do not flourish at all in high altitudes; and probably the  lion, transplanted from the low jungle to the table-lands, would lose  much of his ferocity. Still, cock-fights seem to prosper; and the battle  of Pichincha was fought on an elevation of nearly 11,000 feet. Bolivar  and the Spaniards, also, fought like tigers on the high plain of  Junin.[36]    [Footnote 36: Gibbon states that the temperature of the blood of a young  bull in Cuzco was 100 deg.; air, 57 deg.. At the base of the Andes a similar  experiment resulted in 101 deg. for the blood, air 78 deg.. The lieutenant  jocosely adds: \"The Spaniards have forced the hog so high up on the  Andes that he suffers every time he raises his bristles, and dies out of  place.\"--Puna has been attributed to the presence of arsenical vapor.]    The sickness felt by some travelers at great elevations--violent  headache and disposition to vomit--is called _veta_; and the difficulty  of breathing from the rarity of the air is termed _puna_. Gerard  complained of severe headache and depression of spirits at the height of  15,000 feet on the Himalayas; Dr. Barry, in ascending Mont Blanc (15,700  feet), speaks of great thirst, great dryness and constriction of skin,  loss of appetite, difficult breathing, tendency to syncope, and utter  indifference. Baron Mueller, in his ascent of Orizava (17,800 feet),  found great difficulty in breathing, and experienced the sensation of a  red-hot iron searing his lungs, and agonizing pains in the chest,  followed by fainting-fits and torrents of blood from his mouth;  Humboldt, in scaling Chimborazo, suffered from nausea akin to  sea-sickness, and a flow of blood from the nose and lips; while Herndon,  on the slope of Puy-puy (15,700 feet), said he thought his heart would  break from his breast with its violent agitation. Though ascending the  Andes to the height of 16,000 feet, and running up the last few rods, we  experienced nothing of this except a temporary difficulty in  respiration. We were exhilarated rather than depressed. The experience  of Darwin on the Portillo ridge (14,000 feet) was only \"a slight  tightness across the head and chest.\" \"There was some imagination even  in this (he adds); for, upon finding fossil shells on the highest ridge,  I entirely forgot the puna in my delight.\" De Saussure says truly: \"The  strength is repaired as speedily as it has been exhausted. Merely a  cessation of movement for three or four minutes, without even seating  one's self, seems to restore the strength so perfectly that, on resuming  progress, one feels able to climb at a single stretch to the very peak  of the mountain.\"          CHAPTER VI.         Astronomic Virtues of Quito.--Flora and Fauna of the Valley of       Quito.--Primeval Inhabitants of the Andes.--Quichua Indians.      Quito, with a position unparalleled for astronomical purposes, has no  observatory. The largest telescope in the city is about five feet long,  but the astute professor of natural philosophy in the Jesuit College who  has charge of it had not the most distant idea that an eclipse of the  sun would occur on the 29th of August, and an eclipse of the moon  fifteen days later. In ancient days this \"holy city\" had within it the  Pillar of the Sun, which cast no shadow at noon, and a temple was built  for the god of light. The title of the sovereign Inca was the Child of  the Sun; but there was very little knowledge of astronomy, for, being  the national religion, it was beyond the reach of scientific  speculation.    The atmosphere of Quito is of transparent clearness. Humboldt saw the  poncho of a horseman with the naked eye at a horizontal distance of  ninety thousand feet. The sky is of a dark indigo color; the azure is  less blended with white because of the extreme dryness of the air. The  stars stand out with uncommon brilliancy, and the dark openings between  them the great German compared to \"tubes through which we look into the  remotest depths of space.\" It is true at Quito, as Humboldt noticed at  Cumana, that the stars do not twinkle when they are more than fifteen  degrees high; \"the soft planetary light\" of the stars overhead is not  mere rhetoric.    Living under the equatorial line, Quitonians enjoy the peculiar  privilege of beholding the stars of both hemispheres, the guiding stars  of Ursa Major as well as the Magellanic Clouds and Southern Cross, not  omitting that black spot near the latter, \"the unappropriated region in  the skies reserved by Manager Bingham for deposed American presidents.\"    The zodiacal light here appears in all its glory. This strange  phenomenon has long puzzled philosophers, and they are still divided. It  is generally considered to be produced by a continuous zone of  infinitesimal asteroids. The majority place this zone beyond the orbit  of the earth, and concentric with the sun. But Rev. George Jones, of  Philadelphia, who has spent several years in observing this light,  including eight months in Quito, considers it geocentric, and possibly  situated between the earth and its satellite. At New York only a short  pyramidal light, and this only at certain seasons, is to be seen; but  here, an arch twenty degrees wide, and of considerable intensity, shoots  up to the zenith, and Mr. Jones affirms that a complete arch is visible  at midnight when the ecliptic is at right angles to the spectator's  horizon. We have not been so fortunate as to see it pass the zenith; and  Professor Barnard contends that it never does pass. We may remark that  the main part of the zodiacal light shifts to the south side of the  celestial equator as we cross the line. To us the most magnificent sight  in the tropical heavens is the \"Milky Way,\" especially near Sobieski's  Shield, where it is very luminous. We observed that this starry tract  divided at [Greek: a] Centauri, as Herschel says, and not at [Greek: b],  as many maps and globes have it. The brightest stars in the southern  hemisphere follow the direction of a great circle passing through  [Greek: e] Orionis and [Greek: a] Crucis.    Another thing which arrests the attention of the traveler is the  comparatively well-defined boundary-line between day and night. The  twilight at Quito lasts only an hour and a half; on the coast it is  still shorter. Nor is there any \"harvest moon,\" the satellite rising  with nearly equal intervals of forty-eight minutes.    From the stars we step down to the floral kingdom on the Andes, using as  our ladder of descent the following sentence from Humboldt, at the age  of seventy-five: \"If I might be allowed to abandon myself to the  recollections of my own distant travels, I would instance among the most  striking scenes of nature the calm sublimity of a tropical night, when  the stars--not sparkling, as in our Northern skies--shed their soft and  planetary light over the gently heaving ocean; or I would"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19211"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part A.

She had mixed  a cup of poison for a young nobleman, who had acquired her husband's  friendship, and had on that account become the object of her jealousy;  but unfortunately the king drank of the fatal cup along with his  favorite, and soon after expired.[****] This tragical incident, joined  to her other crimes, rendered Eadburga so odious, that she was obliged  to fly into France; whence Egbert was at the same time recalled by the  nobility, in order to ascend the throne of his ancestors.[*****] He  attained that dignity in the last year of the eighth century.         [* Chron. Sax. p. 16.]         [** H. Hunting. lib. iv.]         [*** Lib. ii. cap. 11.]         [**** Higden, lib. v. M West. p. 152. Asser. in       vita Alfiredi, p, 3. ex edit, Camdeni.]         [***** Chron. Sax. A.D. 800. Brompton, p. 801]    In the kingdoms of the Heptarchy, an exact rule of succession was either  unknown or not strictly observed; and thence the reigning prince was  continually agitated with jealousy against all the princes of the blood,  whom he still considered as rivals, and whose death alone could give him  entire security in his possession of the throne. From this fatal cause,  together with the admiration of the monastic life, and the opinion of  merit attending the preservation of chastity even in a married state,  the royal families had been entirely extinguished in all the kingdoms  except that of Wessex; and the emulations, suspicions, and conspiracies,  which had formerly been confined to the princes of the blood alone, were  now diffused among all the nobility in the several Saxon states. Egbert  was the sole descendant of those first conquerors who subdued Britain,  and who enhanced their authority by claiming a pedigree from Woden, the  supreme divinity of their ancestors. But that prince, though invited by  this favorable circumstance to make attempts on the neighboring Saxons,  gave them for some time no disturbance, and rather chose to turn his  arms against the Britons in Cornwall, whom he defeated in several  battles.[*] He was recalled from the conquest of that country by an  invasion made upon his dominions by Bernulf, king of Mercia.    The Mercians, before the accession of Egbert, had very nearly attained  the absolute sovereignty in the Heptarchy: they had reduced the East  Angles under subjection, and established tributary princes in the  kingdoms of Kent and Essex. Northumberland was involved in anarchy; and  no state of any consequence remained but that of Wessex, which,  much inferior in extent to Mercia, was supported solely by the great  qualities of its sovereign. Egbert led his army against the invaders;  and encountering them at Ellandun, in Wiltshire, obtained a complete  victory, and by the great slaughter which he made of them in their  flight, gave a mortal blow to the power of the Mercians. Whilst he  himself, In prosecution of his victory, entered their country on the  side of Oxfordshire, and threatened the heart of their dominions, he  sent an army into Kent, commanded by Ethelwolph, his eldest son,[**]  and, expelling Baldred. The tributary king, soon made himself master of  that county.         [* Chron. Sax. p. 69.]         [** Ethelwerd, lib iii. cap. 2.]    The kingdom of Essex was conquered with equal facility; and the East  Angles, from their hatred to the Mercian gov ernment, which had been  established over them by treachery and violence, and probably exercised  with tyranny, immediately rose in arms, and craved the protection of  Egbert.[*] Bernulf, the Mercian king, who marched against them, was  feated and siain; and two years after, Ludican, his successor, met  with the same fate. These insurrections and calamities facilitated  the enterprises of Egbert, who advanced into the centre of the Mercian  territories, and made easy conquests over a dispirited and divided  people. In order to engage them more easily to submission, he allowed  Wiglef, their countryman, to retain the title of king, whilst he  himself exercised the real powers of sovereignty.[**] The anarchy which  prevailed in Northumberland tempted him to carry still farther his  victorious arms; and the inhabitants, unable to resist his power,  and desirous of possessing some established form of government, were  forward, on his first appearance, to send deputies, who submitted to  his authority, and swore allegiance to him as their sovereign. Egbert,  however, still allowed to Northumberland, as he had done to Mercia, and  East Anglia, the power of electing a king, who paid him tribute, and was  dependent on him.    Thus were united all the kingdoms of the Heptarchy in one great state,  near four hundred years after the first arrival of the Saxons in  Britain; and the fortunate arms and prudent policy of Egbert at  last effected what had been so often attempted in vain by so many  princes.[***] Kent, Northumberland, and Mercia, which had successively  aspired to general dominion, were now incorporated in his empire; and  the other subordinate kingdoms seemed willingly to share the same fate.  His territories were nearly of the same extent with what is now  properly called England; and a favorable prospect was afforded to  the Anglo-Saxons of establishing a civilized monarchy, possessed of  tranquillity within itself, and secure against foreign invasion. This  great event happened in the year 827.[****]         [* Ethelwerd, lib. iii. cap. 2.]         [** Ingulph. p. 7, 8, 19.]         [*** Chron. Sax. p. 71.]         [**** Chron. Sax. p. 71.]    The Saxons, though they had been so long settled in the island, seem not  as yet to have been much improved beyond their German ancestors, either  hi arts, civility, knowledge, humanity, justice, or obedience to the  laws. Even Christianity, though it opened the way to connections between  their and the more polished states of Europe, had not hitherto been very  effectual in banishing their ignorance, or softening their barbarous  manners. As they received that doctrine through the corrupted channels  of Rome, it carried along with it a great mixture of credulity and  superstition, equally destructive to the understanding and to morals.  The reverence towards saints and relics seems to have almost supplanted  the idoration of the Supreme Being; monastic observances were esteemed  more meritorious than the active virtues; the knowledge of natural  causes was neglected, from the universal belief of miraculous  interpositions and judgments; bounty to the church atoned for every  violence against society; and the remorses for cruelty, murder,  treachery, assassination, and the more robust vices, were appeased, not  by amendment of life, but by penances, servility to the monks, and an  abject and illiberal devotion.[*] The reverence for the clergy had  been carried to such a height, that, wherever a person appeared in a  sacerdotal habit, though on the highway, the people flocked around him,  and, showing him all marks of profound respect, received every word he  uttered as the most sacred oracle.[**] Even the military virtues,  so inherent in all the Saxon tribes, began to be neglected; and the  nobility, preferring the security and sloth of the cloister to the  tumults and glory of war, valued themselves chiefly on endowing  monasteries, of which they assumed the government.[***] The several  kings too, being extremely impoverished by continual benefactions to the  church, to which the states of their kingdoms had weakly assented, could  bestow no rewards on valor or military services, and retained not even  sufficient influence to support their government.[****]         [* These abuses were common to all the European       churches; but the priests in Italy, Spain, and Gaul, made       some atonement for them by other advantages which they       rendered society. For several ages, they were almost all       Romans, or, in other words, the ancient natives; and they       preserved the Roman language and laws, with some remains of       the former civility. But the priests in the Heptarchy, after       the first missionaries, were wholly Saxons, and almost as       ignorant and Barbarous as the laity. They contributed,       therefore, little to no improvement of society in knowledge       or the arts.]         [** Bede, lib. iii. cap. 26.]         [*** Bede, lib. v. cap. 23. Bedae Epist. ad       Egbert.]         [**** Bedse Epist. ad Egbert.]    Another inconvenience which attended this corrupt species of  Christianity, was the superstitious attachment to Rome, and the gradual  subjection of the kingdom to a foreign jurisdiction. The Britons, having  never acknowledged any subordination to the Roman pontiff, had conducted  all ecclesiastical government by their domestic synods and councils;[*]  but the Saxons, receiving their religion from Roman monks, were taught  at the same time a profound reverence for that see, and were naturally  led to regard it as the capital of their religion. Pilgrimages to Rome  were represented as the most meritorious acts of devotion. Not only  noblemen and ladies of rank undertook this tedious journey,[**] but  kings themselves, abdicating their crowns, sought for a secure passport  to heaven at the feet of the Roman pontiff. New relics, perpetually sent  from that endless mint of superstition, and magnified by lying miracles,  invented in convents, operated on the astonished minds of the multitude.  And every prince has attained the eulogies of the monks, the only  historians of those ages, not in proportion to his civil and military  virtues, but to his devoted attachment towards their order, and his  superstitious reverence for Rome.    The sovereign pontiff, encouraged by this blindness and submissive  disposition of the people, advanced every day in his encroachments  on the independence of the English churches.
