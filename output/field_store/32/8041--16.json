At the colonies of Hispalis and Emerita[172]  he enrolled new families of settlers, granted the franchise to the  whole community of the Lingones,[173] and made over certain Moorish  towns as a gift to the province of Baetica. Cappadocia and Africa were  also granted new privileges, as showy as they were short-lived. All  these grants are excused by the exigences of the moment and the  impending crisis, but he even found time to remember his old amours  and passed a measure through the senate restoring Poppaea's  statues.[174] He is believed also to have thought of celebrating  Nero's memory as a means of attracting public sympathy. Some persons  actually erected statues of Nero, and there were times when the  populace and the soldiers, by way of enhancing his fame and dignity,  saluted him as Nero Otho. However, he refused to commit himself. He  was ashamed to accept the title, yet afraid to forbid its use.    While the whole of Rome was intent upon the civil war, foreign          79  affairs were neglected. Consequently a Sarmatian tribe called the  Rhoxolani,[175] who had cut up two cohorts of auxiliaries in the  previous winter, now formed the still more daring scheme of invading  Moesia. Inspirited by success, they assembled nearly 9,000 mounted  men, all more intent on plunder than on fighting. While they were  riding about aimlessly without any suspicion of danger, they were  suddenly attacked by the Third legion[176] and its native auxiliaries.  On the Roman side everything was ready for a battle: the Sarmatians  were scattered over the country; some in their greed for plunder were  heavily laden, and their horses could scarcely move on the slippery  roads. They were caught in a trap and cut to pieces. It is quite  extraordinary how all a Sarmatian's courage is, so to speak, outside  himself. Fighting on foot, no one is more cowardly; but their cavalry  charge would break almost any troops. On this occasion it was raining  and the ground was greasy with thaw; their pikes and their long  swords, needing both hands to wield, were useless; their horses  slipped and they were encumbered by the heavy coat of mail which all  their chiefs and nobles wear. Being made of iron plates and a very  hard kind of leather, it is impenetrable to blows, but most  inconvenient for any one who is knocked down by a charge of the enemy  and tries to get up. Besides, they sank into the deep, soft snow. The  Roman soldiers in their neat leather jerkins, armed with javelin and  lance, and using, if need be, their light swords, sprang on the  unarmed Sarmatians (they never carry shields) and stabbed them at  close quarters. A few, surviving the battle, hid themselves in the  marshes, and there perished miserably from the severity of the winter  and their wounds. When the news of this reached Rome, Marcus Aponius,  the governor of Moesia, was granted a triumphal statue,[177] while the  commanding officers of the legions, Fulvius Aurelius, Tettius  Julianus, and Numisius Lupus, received the insignia of consular rank.  Otho was delighted and took all the credit to himself, as if he had  been the successful general, and had himself employed his officers and  armies to enlarge the empire.    In the meantime a riot broke out in an unexpected quarter, and,         80  though trivial at first, nearly ended in the destruction of Rome. Otho  had given orders that the Seventeenth cohort[178] should be summoned  from the colony of Ostia to the city, and Varius Crispinus, a tribune  of the guards, was instructed to provide them with arms. Anxious to  carry out his instructions undisturbed while the camp was quiet, he  arranged that the arsenal was to be opened and the cohort's wagons  loaded after nightfall. The hour aroused suspicion; the motive was  questioned; his choice of a quiet moment resulted in an uproar. The  mere sight of swords made the drunken soldiers long to use them. They  began to murmur and accuse their officers of treachery, suggesting  that the senators' slaves were going to be armed against Otho. Some of  them were too fuddled to know what they were saying: the rascals saw  a chance of plunder: the mass of them, as usual, were simply eager for  a change: and such as were loyal could not carry out their orders in  the darkness. When Crispinus tried to check them, the mutineers killed  him together with the most determined of the centurions, seized their  armour, bared their swords, and mounting the horses, made off at full  speed for Rome and the palace.    It so happened that a large party of Roman senators and their           81  wives was dining with Otho. In their alarm they wondered whether the  soldiers' outbreak was unpremeditated or a ruse of the emperor's:  would it be safer to fly in all directions or to stay and be arrested?  At one moment they would make a show of firmness, at the next their  terror betrayed them. All the time they were watching Otho's face,  and, as happens when people suspect each other, he was just as afraid  himself as they were of him. But feeling no less alarm for the  senators than for himself, he promptly dispatched the prefects of the  Guards to appease the anger of the troops, and told all his guests to  leave immediately. Then on all sides Roman officials could be seen to  throw away their insignia, avoid their suite, and slink off  unattended. Old gentlemen and their wives roamed the dark streets in  all directions. Few went home, most of them fled to friends, or sought  an obscure refuge with the humblest of their clients.    The soldiers' onrush could not be stopped at the gates of the           82  palace. They demanded to see Otho and invaded the banquet-hall.  Julius Martialis, a tribune of the Guards, and Vitellius Saturninus,  the camp-prefect[179] of the legion, were wounded while endeavouring  to bar their progress. On every side they brandished swords and hurled  threats, now against their officers, now against the whole senate; and  since they could not select any one victim for their wrath, in a blind  frenzy of panic they clamoured for a free hand against all the  senators. At last Otho, sacrificing his dignity, stood up on a couch  and with great difficulty restrained them by means of prayers and  tears. They returned to their camp unwillingly, and with a guilty  conscience.    The next day Rome was like a captured city. The houses were all shut,  the streets almost deserted, and everybody looked depressed. The  soldiers, too, hung their heads, though they were more sulky than  sorry for what they had done. Their prefects, Licinius Proculus and  Plotius Firmus, harangued them by companies, the one mildly, the other  harshly, for they were men of different natures. They concluded by  announcing that the men were to receive five thousand sesterces[180]  apiece. After that Otho ventured to enter the camp. The tribunes and  centurions each flinging away the insignia of his rank,[181] crowded  round him begging for a safe discharge. Stung by the disgrace of this,  the troops soon quieted down, and even went the length of demanding  that the ringleaders should be punished. In the general disturbance  Otho's position was difficult.  The soldiers were by no means           83  unanimous. The better sort wanted him to put a stop to the prevalent  insubordination, but the great bulk of them liked faction-fighting and  emperors who had to court their favour, and with the prospect of  rioting and plunder were ready enough for civil war. He realized,  also, that one who wins a throne by violence cannot keep it by  suddenly trying to enforce the rigid discipline of earlier days.  However, the danger of the crisis both for the city and the senate  seriously alarmed him, so he finally delivered himself as follows:--    'Fellow soldiers, I have not come to fan the fire of your affection  for me, or to instil courage into your hearts: in both those qualities  you are more than rich. No, I have come to ask you to moderate your  courage and to set some bounds to your affection. These recent  disturbances did not originate in those passions of greed or violence,  which so often cause dissension in an army; nor was it that you  feared some danger and tried to shirk it. The sole cause was your  excessive loyalty, which you displayed with more ardour than  judgement. For with the best of motives, indiscretion often lands men  in disaster. We are preparing for war. Do you imagine that we could  publish all our dispatches, and discuss our plans in the presence of  the whole army, when we have to devise a systematic campaign and keep  up with the rapid changes of the situation? There are things a soldier  ought to know, but there is much of which he must be ignorant. It is  necessary for the maintenance of strict discipline and of the  general's authority that even his tribunes and centurions should often  obey blindly. If every one is going to inquire into his motives,  discipline is done for, and his authority falls to the ground. Suppose  in actual warfare you are called to arms at dead of night: shall a few  drunken blackguards--for I cannot believe that many lost their heads  in the recent panic--go and stain their hands with their officers'  blood, and then break into the general's tent?    'Now I know you did it to protect me, but the riot and the              84  darkness and the general confusion might easily have provided an  opportunity to kill me. Suppose Vitellius and his satellites had their  choice of the state of mind they would pray to find us in; what more  could they desire than mutiny and dissension, the men insubordinate to  the centurions, and the centurions to their superior officers, and the  whole force, horse and foot alike, rushing in headlong confusion to  their ruin? Good soldiering, my comrades, consists in obedience, not  in scrutinizing the general's orders; and the army which is most  orderly in peace is most courageous on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1694"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: The First Thousand Years: 600 - 1600 (#15)"],[1,". They had plots narrow in  frontage along the road and deep. Their shops faced the road,  with living space behind or above their stores. Town buildings  were typically part stone and part timber as a compromise between  fire precautions and expense.    Towns, as distinct from villages, had permanent markets. As towns  grew, they paid a fee to obtain a charter for self-government  from the King giving the town judicial and commercial freedom.  These various rights were typically expanded in future times.  Such a town was called a \"borough\" and its citizens or  landholding freemen \"burgesses\". They were literate enough to do  accounts. Selling wholesale could take place only in a borough.  The King assessed a tallage [ad hoc tax] usually at ten per cent  of property or income. Henry standardized the yard as the length  of his own arm.    London had at least twenty wards, each governed by its own  alderman. Most of them were named after people. London was ruled  by sixteen families linked by business and marriage ties. These  businesses supplied luxury goods to the rich and included the  goldsmiths [sold cups, dishes, girdles, mirrors, purses knives,  and metal wine containers with handle and spout], vintners [wine  merchants], mercers [sold textiles, haberdashery, combs,  mirrors, knives, toys, spices, ointments, and drugs], drapers,  and pepperers, which later merged with the spicerers to become  the \"grocers\". These businesses had in common four fears: royal  interference, foreign competition, displacement by new crafts,  and violence by the poor and escaped villeins who found their  way to the city.    London in Middlesex county received this charter for  self-government and freedom from the financial and judicial  organization of the shire:    \"Henry, by the grace of God, King of England, to the Archbishop  of Canterbury and the bishops, abbots, earls, barons,  justiciars, sheriffs and all his loyal subjects, both French and  English, throughout the whole of England - greeting.    1. Be it known to you that I have granted Middlesex to my  citizens of London to be held on lease by them and their heirs  of me and my heirs for 300 pounds paid by tale [yearly], upon  these terms: that the citizens themselves [may] appoint a  sheriff, such as they desire, from among themselves, and a  justiciar, such as they desire, from among themselves, to  safeguard the pleas of my Crown [criminal cases] and to conduct  such pleas. And there shall be no other justiciar over the men  of London.    2. And the citizens shall not take part in any [civil] case  whatsoever outside the City walls.      1) And they shall be exempt from the payment of scot and  danegeld and the murder fine.      2) And none of them shall take part in trial by combat.      3) And if any of the citizens has become involved in a plea  of the Crown, he shall clear himself, as a citizen of London, by  an oath which has been decreed in the city.      4) And no one shall be billeted [lodged in a person's house  by order of the King] within the walls of the city nor shall  hospitality be forcibly exacted for anyone belonging to my  household or to any other.      5) And all the citizens of London and all their effects  [goods] shall be exempt and free, both throughout England and in  the seaports, from toll and fees for transit and market fees and  all other dues.      6) And the churches and barons and citizens shall have and  hold in peace and security their rights of jurisdiction [in  civil and criminal matters] along with all their dues, in such a  way that lessees who occupy property in districts under private  jurisdiction shall pay dues to no one except the man to whom the  jurisdiction belongs, or to the official whom he has placed  there.      7) And a citizen of London shall not be amerced [fined by a  court when the penalty for an offense is not designated by  statute] to forfeiture of a sum greater than his wergeld,  [hereby assessed as] 100 shillings, in a case involving money.      8) And further there shall be no miskenning [false plea  causing a person to be summoned to court] in a husting or in a  folkmoot [meeting of the community], or in any other court  within the City.      9) And the Hustings [court] shall sit once a week on Monday.      10) And I assure to my citizens their lands and the property  mortgaged to them and the debts due to them both within the City  and without.      11) And with regard to lands about which they have plead in  suit before me, I shall maintain justice on their behalf,  according to the law of the City.      12) And if anyone has exacted toll or tax from citizens of  London, the citizens of London within the city shall [have the  right to] seize [by process of law] from the town or village  where the toll or tax was exacted a sum equivalent to that which  the citizen of London gave as toll and hence sustained as loss.      13) And all those who owe debts to citizens shall pay them or  shall clear themselves in London from the charge of being in  debt to them.      14) But if they have refused to pay or to come to clear  themselves, then the citizens to whom they are in debt shall  [have the right to] seize [by process of law] their goods  [including those in the hands of a third party, and bring them]  into the city from the [town, village or] county in which the  debtor lives [as pledges to compel appearance in court].      15) And the citizens shall enjoy as good and full hunting  rights as their ancestors ever did, namely, in the Chilterns, in  Middlesex, and in Surrey.    Witnessed at Westminster.\"    The above right not to take part in any case outside the city  relieved London citizens from the burden of traveling to  wherever the King's court happened to be, the disadvantage of  not knowing local customs, and the difficulty of speaking in the  language of the King's court rather than in English. The right  of redress for tolls exacted was new because the state of the law  was that the property of the inhabitants was liable to the King  or superior lord for the common debt.    Craft guilds grew up in the towns, such as the tanners at Oxford,  which later merged with the shoemakers into a cordwainers'  guild. There were weavers' guilds in several towns given royal  sanction. They paid an annual tribute and were given a monopoly  of weaving cloth within a radius of several miles. Guild rules  covered attendance of the members at church services, the  promotion of pilgrimages, celebration of masses for the dead,  common meals, relief of poor brethren and sisters, the hours of  labor, the process of manufacture, the wages of workmen, and  technical education.    Newcastle-on-Tyne was recognized by the King as having certain  customs, so the following was not called a grant:    \"These are the laws and customs which the burgesses of Newcastle  upon Tyne had in the time of Henry King of England and ought to  have.    [1] Burgesses can distrain [take property of another until the  other performs his obligation] upon foreigners within, or  without their own market, within or without their own houses,  and within or without their own borough without the leave of the  reeve, unless the county court is being held in the borough, and  unless [the foreigners are] on military service or guarding the  castle.    [2] A burgess cannot distrain upon a burgess without the leave of  the reeve.    [3] If a burgess have lent anything of his to a foreigner, let  the debtor restore it in the borough if he admits the debt, if  he denies it, let him justify himself in the borough.    [4] Pleas which arise in the borough shall be held and concluded  there, except pleas of the Crown.    [5] If any burgess be appealed [sued] of any plaint, he shall not  plead without the borough, unless for default of [the borough]  court.    [6] Nor ought he to answer without day and term, unless he have  fallen into 'miskenning'[error in pleading], except in matters  which pertain to the Crown.    [7] If a ship have put in at Tynemouth and wishes to depart, the  burgesses may buy what they will [from it].    [8] If a plea arise between a burgess and a merchant, it shall be  concluded before the third ebb of the tide.    [9] Whatever merchandise a ship has brought by sea must be  landed, except salt; and herring ought to be sold in the ship.    [10] If any man have held land in burgage for a year and a day,  lawfully and without claim, he shall not answer a claimant,  unless the claimant have been without the realm of England, or a  child not of age to plead.    [11] If a burgess have a son, he shall be included in his  father's freedom if he be with his father.    [12] If a villein come to dwell in the borough, and dwell there a  year and a day as a burgess, he shall abide altogether, unless  notice has been given by him or by his master that he is  dwelling for a term.    [13] If any man appeal [sue] a burgess of any thing, he cannot do  battle with the burgess, but the burgess shall defend himself by  his law, unless it be of treason, whereof he is bound to defend  himself by battle.    [14] Neither can a burgess do battle against a foreigner, unless  he first go out of the borough.    [15] No merchant, unless he be a burgess, may buy [outside] the  town either wool or leather or other merchandise, nor within the  borough except [from] burgesses.    [16] If a burgess incur forfeit, he shall give six ounces [10s.]  to the reeve.    [17] In the borough there is no merchet [payment for marrying off  a daughter] nor heriot nor bloodwite [fine for drawing blood]  nor stengesdint [fine for striking with a stick].    [18] Every burgess may have his own oven and hand-mill if he  will, saving the right of the King's oven.    [19] If a woman be in forfeit for bread or beer, no one ought to  interfere but the reeve. If she forfeit twice, she shall be  chastised by her forfeit. If three times, let justice be done on  her.    [20] No one but a burgess may "]]]
