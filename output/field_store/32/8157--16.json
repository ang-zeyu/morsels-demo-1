Supplicating blessings  for forthcoming conference with committees. Elated by magnificent success  achieved at European Conference, development of affiliation with United  Nations... Urge you devote special attention in current year to insure  rapid progress of Temple construction, maintenance of assembly status and  consolidation of newly formed assemblies.    [June 23, 1948]            PRAYING FOR ADDED FERVOR      Greatly welcome initiated plans for schools, delighted at progress of  Temple work, acceptance of resolutions by UNO Conference, election of  Ioas. Urge unrelaxing vigilance in maintenance of status and consolidation  of assemblies in North America, to insure steady expansion of manifold  activities in Latin America and Europe. Praying for added fervor, speedy  realization of high objectives of God-given mission of much-admired  American Baha'i Community.    [August 9, 1948]            COMPLETED TASKS RELEASE OUTPOURING OF GRACE      Welcome Assembly's high resolve to insure uninterrupted Temple  construction. Deeply moved and thankful for continued evidence of the  inflexible determination with which the rank and file of the  clear-sighted, high-minded, divinely sustained American Baha'i Community,  its representatives, national, local and regional, its pioneers at home  and overseas, discharge in distant fields, despite the smallness of their  numbers and their limited resources, tasks of such vast dimensions, of so  diversified a character, of such great moment, at so significant a stage  in the declining fortunes of an imperiled society. I feel convinced that  unflinching maintenance of so exalted a standard of stewardship at the  threshold of Baha'u'llah must release in still greater measure the  outpouring of His grace so essential and befitting the consummation of a  Divine Plan deriving its authority from the pen of the Center of His  Covenant and propelled by agencies created through the generative  influence of His Will and Testament.    [September 14, 1948]            APPEAL TO ENTIRE COMMUNITY TO PERSEVERE      Appreciate Assembly's message. Praying for success of plans. Urge special  effort to expedite work of Temple, reinforce pioneer endeavor in Europe  owing to deteriorating international situation. Appeal to entire community  wholeheartedly to persevere irrespective of darkened outlook.    [October 21, 1948]            SCALE NOBLER HEIGHTS OF HEROISM      The deepening crisis ominously threatening further to derange the  equilibrium of a politically convulsed, economically disrupted, socially  subverted, morally decadent and spiritually moribund society is testing  the tenacity, taxing the resources and challenging the spirit throughout  three continents of the chosen trustees and valiant executors of  'Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan. This present hour, however critical, fraught  with uncertainty, cannot and must not retard the unfoldment of the  manifold tasks so brilliantly inaugurated, so diligently prosecuted, so  dazzling in their prospects.    The record of the Baha'i community since inception of the Formative Age  conclusively demonstrates that accomplishment of signal acts accompanied,  or followed upon, periods of acute distress in European and American  contemporary history. The machinery of the Administrative Order was  established, and preliminary stage of construction of the House of Worship  was undertaken, by a grief-stricken community in the anxious years  following the sudden removal of its loving, watchful Founder. The  superstructure of the Temple was erected amid the strain and stress of an  economic depression of an unprecedented severity gripping the North  American continent. The first Seven Year Plan, opening stage in the  execution of the historic mission entrusted to the American Baha'i  Community, was launched in the face of a gathering storm culminating in  the direst conflict yet experienced by mankind. The Tablets of the Divine  Plan were revealed amidst the turmoil of the first World War involving  great danger to the life of their Author. The remains of 'Abdu'l-Baha's  mother and brother were transferred to site of monuments constituting  focus of institutions of future World Administrative Center and erected on  the morrow of the outbreak of hostilities while the Holy Land was  increasingly exposed to the perils precipitated by the second conflict.  The daughter communities of Latin America were called into being and  exterior ornamentation of the Temple was consummated while the American  mother community was in the throes of the last, most harassing stage of  the devastating struggle. The world-wide Centenary celebrations crowning  these enterprises were undertaken in such perilous circumstances and  carried out despite the formidable obstacles engendered through  prolongation of hostilities. National administrative headquarters were  established in Tihran, Cairo, Ba_gh_dad, Delhi and Sydney, national and  international endowments were enriched and assemblies incorporated in  countries confronted by growing threat of invasion and encirclement.    The Second Seven Year Plan inaugurating the transatlantic mission  embracing Scandinavia, the Low Countries, Switzerland, the Iberian and  Italian Peninsulas, was launched on the morrow of the catastrophic  upheaval despite the exhaustion, confusion, distress and restrictions  afflicting a war-shattered continent. The first fruits of this newly  launched Plan were garnered through convocation of first European Teaching  Conference and erection of the ninth pillar of the Universal House of  Justice in the Dominion of Canada despite premonitory rumblings of a third  ordeal threatening to engulf the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. The  central structure of the Bab's Sepulcher was built while the precious life  of its builder was hanging perilously in the balance. Plans were drawn,  contracts placed and foundations laid for its arcade while the holy places  were ravaged by flames of the civil strife burning fiercely in the Holy  Land.    Precious years are inexorably slipping by. The world outlook is steadily  darkening. The American Community's most arduous feats still lie ahead.  Disasters overtaking Europe and America, more afflictive than any  tribulations yet suffered in either continent, may yet attend still more  majestic revelations in the unfoldment of concluding stage of the Second  Seven Year Plan destined to witness successively the raising of the tenth  and eleventh pillars of the Universal House of Justice, and the  celebration of the Golden Jubilee of the Mother Temple of the West.    The champion builders of Baha'u'llah's rising World Order must scale  nobler heights of heroism as humanity plunges into greater depths of  despair, degradation, dissension and distress. Let them forge ahead into  the future serenely confident that the hour of their mightiest exertions  and the supreme opportunity for their greatest exploits must coincide with  the apocalyptic upheaval marking the lowest ebb in mankind's  fast-declining fortunes.    [November 3, 1948]            THE CITADEL OF THE FAITH OF BAHA'U'LLAH      As the threat of still more violent convulsions assailing a travailing age  increases, and the wings of yet another conflict, destined to contribute a  distinct, and perhaps a decisive, share to the birth of the new Order  which must signalize the advent of the Lesser Peace, darken the  international horizon, the eyes of the divers communities, comprising the  body of the organized followers of Baha'u'llah throughout the Eastern  Hemisphere, are being increasingly fixed upon the progressive unfoldment  of the tasks which the executors of 'Abdu'l-Baha's Mandate have been  summoned to undertake in the course of the second stage of their  world-girdling mission. Past experience, ranging over a period of many  years, has taught them that no matter how formidable the external  obstacles that have confronted them during the turbulent and eventful  decades since the Master's passing, and despite the strain and stress  which internal crises, precipitated by enemies from within and by adverse  economic circumstances afflicting their country, have imposed, the  stalwart occupants of the citadel of the Faith of Baha'u'llah have with  extraordinary steadfastness, enviable fidelity and magnificent courage,  not only shielded the interests, preserved the integrity and demonstrated  the worthiness, of the Cause they have embraced, but have sallied forth,  with dynamic and irrepressible energy, to implant its banner and establish  its outposts in countries and continents far beyond the original scene of  their operations.          STAUNCHNESS OF AMERICAN BELIEVERS      Neither the irreparable loss sustained by the termination of the earthly  life of a vigilant Master, nor the acute distress caused by the financial  collapse which suddenly swept their country, nor the unprecedented tragedy  of a world crisis that swept their land and its people into its vortex,  nor the perils and uncertainties, the exhaustion and the disillusionment  associated with its aftermath nor even the soul-shaking tests which  periodically assailed them, through the defection and the attacks of  Covenant-breakers, occupying, by virtue of their kinship to, or their long  association with, the Founder of their community, exalted positions at the  World Center of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19270"],[0,"Directives from the Guardian (#15)"],[1," lines of activity it would seem  more desirable that they should concentrate their efforts in acquiring the  full training for that type of work for which they are best suited by  nature. Such a specialization has the advantage of saving time and of  leading to greater efficiency, particularly at this early stage of our  development. The great danger, however, lies in that by so doing the  friends may tend to develop a sort of class consciousness which is  fundamentally contrary to both the spirit and actual teachings of the  Faith.    \"It is precisely in order to overcome such a danger that the Guardian  thinks it advisable that the friends should be encouraged to serve from  time to time in both the teaching and the administrative spheres of Baha'i  work, but only whenever they feel fit to do so.\"            188: TEACHERS, BAHA'I (A PRINCIPLE)      \"Regarding the principle that the Cause must not be allowed to center  around any Baha'i personality, the Guardian wishes to make it clear that  it was never intended that well qualified individual teachers should not  receive from local Assemblies every encouragement and facilities to  address the public. What the Guardian meant was that the personality and  popularity of such a speaker should never be allowed to eclipse the  authority or detract from the influence of the body of the elected  representatives in every local community. Such an individual should not  only seek the approval, advice and assistance of the body that represents  the Cause in his locality, but should strive to attribute any credit he  may obtain, to the collective wisdom and capacity of the Assembly under  whose jurisdiction he performs his services. Assemblies and not  individuals constitute the bedrock on which the Administration is built.  Everything else must be subordinated to, and be made to serve and advance  the best interests of these elected custodians and promoters of the laws  of Baha'u'llah.\"            189: TEACHING      \"The Cause of God is developing rapidly in the virgin areas of the  Crusade; but on the home front we seem to be not so successful. No doubt  this is due to the fact that the friends at home are not as diligently  taking advantage of every teaching opportunity as the pioneers do in  foreign lands. Success will crown the efforts of the friends on the home  front when they meditate on the teaching, pray fervently for divine  confirmations for their work, study the teachings so they may carry the  spirit to the seeker, and then act,--and above all persevere in action.  When these steps are followed, and the teaching work carried on  sacrificially and with devoted enthusiasm, the Faith will spread rapidly.\"            190: TEACHING (LOVE FOR BAHA'U'LLAH)      \"...Without the spirit of real love for Baha'u'llah, for His Faith and its  Institutions, and the believers for each other, the Cause can never really  bring in large numbers of people. For it is not preaching any rules the  world wants, but love and action...\"            191: TEACHING      \"Shoghi Effendi would urge every Baha'i who feels the urge to exercise his  right of teaching unofficially the Cause, to keep in close touch with the  Local Spiritual Assembly of the locality in which he is working. The Local  Spiritual Assembly, while reserving for itself the right to control such  activities on the part of individual Baha'is, should do its utmost to  encourage such teachers and to put at their disposal whatever facilities  they would need in such circumstances. Should any differences arise, the  National Spiritual Assembly would naturally have to intervene and adjust  matters.\"            192: TEACHING (ADVENT OF DIVINE JUSTICE)      \"In the matter of teaching, as repeatedly and emphatically stated,  particularly in his 'Advent of Divine Justice', the Guardian does not wish  the believers to make the slightest discrimination, even though this may  result in provoking opposition or criticism from any individual, class or  institution. The Call of Baha'u'llah, being universal, should be addressed  with equal force to all the peoples, classes and nations of the world,  irrespective of any religious, racial, political or class distinction or  difference...\"            193: TEACHING, CONCENTRATE ON (SOURCE OF JOY AND CONSOLATION)      \"We all have our petty material obstacles in this life. We cannot totally  get rid of them. The best thing to do, after all our efforts have failed  to deliver us, is to concentrate on that which can alone bring real  happiness and peace to our heart. And you should be thankful to God for  having enabled you to recognize and accept His Faith. For this is,  assuredly, the only source of joy and consolation you can have in your  moments of suffering. Is there anything more worthwhile to work for than  the Teachings of the Message?\"            194: TEACHING (THE CONCOURSE ON HIGH)      \"The invisible battalions of the Concourse on High, are mustered, in  serried ranks, ready to rush their reinforcements to the aid of the  vanguard of Baha'u'llah's crusaders in the hour of their greatest need,  and in anticipation of that Most Great, that Wondrous Jubilee in the  joyfulness of which both heaven and earth will partake.\"            195: TEACHING (DIRECT)      \"He approves of your desire to teach the principles of the Faith through  radio. But he urges you to do all you can to always, however small the  reference you are able to make to it may be, clearly identify or associate  what you are giving out with Baha'u'llah. The time is too short now for us  Baha'is to be able to first educate humanity and then tell it that the  source is this new World Faith. For their own spiritual protection people  must hear of the name Baha'i--then, if they turn blindly away they cannot  excuse themselves by saying they never even knew it existed! For dark days  seem still ahead of the world, and outside this Divine Refuge the people  will not, we firmly believe, find inner conviction, peace and security. So  they have a right to at least hear of the Cause as such.\"            196: TEACHING--DIVINE WORLD ORDER--THE SOLE PANACEA      \"In connection with your teaching work: What the Guardian wishes you to  particularly emphasize in all your talks is the supreme necessity for all  individuals and nations in this day to adopt in its entirety the social  program given by Baha'u'llah for the reconstruction of the religious,  economic and political life of mankind. He wishes you to explain and  analyze the elements that help in raising this Divine World Order in the  light of the present-day events and conditions in the world. Special  stress, he feels, should be laid on the impending necessity of  establishing a super-national, and sovereign world state, as the one  described by Baha'u'llah. With the world becoming increasingly subject to  tumults and convulsions never experienced before, the realization of such  a necessity is entering into the consciousness of not only the wise and  learned, but of the common people as well. The believers should,  therefore, seize this opportunity to make a supreme effort to present, in  convincing and eloquent language, those social and humanitarian teachings  of the Faith which we believe to constitute the sole panacea for the  innumerable ills afflicting our present-day world.\"            197: TEACHING (DUTY OF EVERY BELIEVER)      \"Indeed to bring this message to mankind in its darkest hour of need is  the paramount duty of every believer. All the agony, the suffering,  privation and spiritual blindness afflicting people today everywhere in  the world, to a greater or lesser degree, is because they are unaware of,  or indifferent to, the Remedy God has sent them. Only those who are aware  of it can carry its healing knowledge to others, so that each Baha'i has  an inescapable and sacred duty to perform.\"            198: TEACHING (GIVE THE MESSAGE)      \"The believers ought to give the message even to those who do not seem  ready for it, because they can never judge the real extent to which the  Word of God can influence the hearts and minds of the people, even those  who appear to lack any power of receptivity to the teachings.\"            199: TEACHING (GREATER UNITY AMONG THE FRIENDS)      \"Regarding your question about the need for greater unity among the  friends, there is no doubt that this is so, and the Guardian feels that  one of the chief instruments for promoting it is to teach the Baha'is  themselves, in classes and through precepts, that love of God, and  consequently of men, is the essential foundation of every religion, our  own included. A greater degree of love will produce a greater unity,  because it enables people to bear with each other, to be patient and  forgiving.\"            200: TEACHING (LOVE AND UNITY)      \"The most important thing for the believers is, of course, to be united  and to really love each other for the sake of God, (Otherwise it is not  possible to love everyone). However, if communities wait until love and  complete harmony are established before teaching, the teaching work will  come to a standstill. Both sides must be cultivated; whilst actively  teaching the friends must themselves be taught and deepened in the spirit  of the Faith, which brings love and unity.\"            201: TEACHING--BAHA'I FAITH (WHAT THE CAUSE NOW REQUIRES)      \"What the Cause now requires is not so much a group of highly cultured and  intellectual people who can adequately present its Teachings, but a number  of devoted, sincere and loyal supporters, who, in utter disregard of their  own weaknesses and limitations, and with hearts afire with the love of  God, forsake their all for the sake of spreading and establishing His  Faith. In other words, what is mostly needed nowadays is a Baha'i pioneer  and not so much a Baha'i philosopher or scholar. For the Cause is not a  system of philosophy; it is essentially a way of life, a religious faith  that "]]]
