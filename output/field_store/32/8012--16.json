The supporters of the shield of Richard III. were two boars rampant  argent, tusked and bristled or. Henry VII., as a descendant of the  Welch prince Cadwallader, assumed the red dragon as the supporter  of the dexter side of his shield; the sinister was supported by a  greyhound argent, collared gules. The shield of Henry VIII. was  supported on the dexter side by a lion guardant, crowned or; on the  sinister by a dragon gules. Edward VI. had the same supporters. Mary  on her marriage with Philip of Spain, empaled the arms of Spain  and England as baron and femme; the dexter side of the shield was  supported by the imperial eagle, the sinister by a lion rampant,  crowned or. Queen Elizabeth rescued England from this degradation; the  crowned lion rampant of England resumed his place as the supporter of  the dexter side of the shield, and the red dragon on the sinister. On  the union of England with Scotland, the supporters of the royal arms  were, on the dexter side a lion guardant, crowned or, on the sinister  maned and unguled or, white unicorn, gorged and chained of the same.  The supporters of the royal arms have continued the same to the  present time; and, as an emblem of union and strength, long may they  continue.    The reader may easily read the vicissitudes and changes of dynasty in  the great change of these emblems of support and dignity during the  period of time that elapsed from the reign of Richard II. to James  I.; and even the brief notice here given would enable the reader to  determine the date of any building if the royal arms and supporters  were placed within it.    Heraldry had taken too firm a hold of the minds of the higher classes  of society to escape the notice of the architects who were engaged by  the sovereigns of England and by the wealthy barons, to erect those  splendid ecclesiastical edifices that still exist as the architectural  gems of Britain. Westminster Abbey teems with heraldic ornament, not  only in the gorgeous chapel of Henry VII., but in those parts of the  structure erected at a much earlier period. During the time when  those styles of Gothic architecture prevailed that are now called the  decorated and the perpendicular, the roof, the columns, the stained  glass windows, the seats, altar, tombs, and even the flooring, were  filled with emblazonment. A branch of art which our forefathers found  so useful as an ornament to architecture cannot be beneath the notice  of those who are desirous of treading in their footsteps.    Nor was heraldic ornament confined to architecture. It formed the  grand embellishment of the interior of the palaces and baronial  castles,      \"The gorgeous halls which were on every side,    With rich array and costly arras dight.\"    The canopies of state, the furniture and plate, were all emblazoned  with the arms of the royal and noble owners. And even at the present  day, heraldry is far more effective for interior decoration than the  unmeaning Italian scroll-work that is substituted for it. Some idea of  the value of both may be formed by glancing at the interior decoration  of the new Royal Exchange; and it is to be regretted that the shields  containing the arms of the different countries should not have  occupied the walls, as an indication of the spot where the natives  of those countries might be found; and that the compartments of the  ceiling, if such ornament should be found in a building of this  kind at all, should not be filled with the Italian floral scroll  decoration.    In a preceding chapter of this Manual, the reader has been informed  that the arms of a knight were emblazoned on the surcoat or outer  garment that was worn over his armour, which was the origin of the  term Coat of Arms. Heraldic emblazonment was plentifully strewed over  the mantles of the nobility when they assembled on state solemnities.  Nor was this ornament confined to the garments of males. Ladies  delighted to appear in the cognizances of their lords, or in their own  paternal bearings. Armourists that have amused themselves by treating  on the curious and obsolete terms of heraldry, have supposed that the  flanch and flasque represent that part of female attire which covered  the body from the lower part of the neck to the waist, and that  this part of the ladies' dress contained the heraldic bearing. Our  contracted space will not allow our indulging in fanciful research,  nor would it benefit our readers if we did so. Suffice it that we have  ample proof that heraldry formed the decoration of female attire.    Numerous instances may be found, either in stained glass, monumental  brasses, or illuminated genealogies, of female figures bearing  heraldic devices on their apparel. A married lady or widow had her  paternal arms emblazoned upon the fore part of her vest, which by  ancient writers is called the kirtle, and the arms of the husband on  the mantle, being the outer and the most costly garment, and therefore  deemed the most honourable. This is called bearing arms kirtle and  mantle.    Our frontispiece contains two figures kneeling, taken from _Dallaway's  Heraldry_. They are to be found in an illuminated pedigree of the  Weston family. The male figure is that of Sir John de Weston, of  Weston-Lizars, in Staffordshire, and Isabel his wife, whose paternal  name was Bromley. In three quarterfoils beneath the figures are  shields: the first contains the arms of Weston, sable, an eagle  displayed or, with a lable argent, fretty gules; the centre shield  is argent, fretty gules; that under the lady is her paternal arms,  quarterly per fess dancette, or and gules. The figure of the knight  is represented in chain armour, over which is a surcoat, on which his  arms are emblazoned. The vest or kirtle of the lady is formed  entirely of the colours of her arms disposed quarterly, and parted  horizontally, or fessways, by the line dancette. As both the knight  and his lady appear together, each bears their own arms; but if either  had been drawn separately, the arms of both would have appeared on one  person; if on the male, they would have been empaled baron and femme  upon the surcoat; if on the female, they would have appeared on kirtle  and mantle. This lady is drawn with a kirtle only.    In some of the later monumental brasses, the arms on female figures  are arranged differently; the arms of the baron appearing on the  outside of the mantle, hanging over the dexter shoulder, the paternal  arms of the femme on the lining of the mantle turned outwards on the  sinister side of the figure.    The reader will find, by referring to the word TOURNAMENT in the  Dictionary, that Heraldry formed the great embellishment of that  animated and costly amusement: and that the attainment of heraldic  honours was the only means of gaining permission to join in it, and  by this means only was a passport obtained to high society. These  honours, which cost some trouble in gaining, could be lost by  misconduct. Arms were forfeited for uncourteous demeanour, disregard  of authority, falsehood, oppression, and ungentlemanly conduct; and  there can be little doubt but, in a semi-barbarous age, when prowess  in the field of battle was considered the highest acomplishment, that  the dread of a blot on the escutcheon, or a reversal of the shield of  arms, restrained many a proud baron in his tyrannical proceedings  to those beneath him, and tended to keep down the insolence of the  upstart favourites of royalty. Heraldry tended to soften and polish  the manners, and, by the introduction of the manufacture of silken  housings tapestry, and carpeting, to increase the comforts and  pleasures of society, and compelled those who were anxious to exhibit  the insignia of gentility, to seek distinction by other means than  rapine and violence.    The term Canting Heraldry frequently occurs in ancient and modern  authors. It is a term of contempt and derision, applied to symbolic  bearings that are assumed without the authority of the Heralds'  College. In many cases they allude to the name or occupation of the  bearer: the motto is probably a pun upon the figures contained in the  shield, or some technical expression used by the parties in their  agricultural or commercial pursuits.    No person, when heraldry was in its greatest repute, dared assume any  cognizance or bearing without permission of the Earl Marshal or the  Kings-at-Arms. Any individuals, who presumed, by assumption, to offend  the laws of the court of honour, were liable to heavy fines and  personal duresse, which in many instances have been rigidly enforced.

Do not, then, for the mere sake of  discipline, command attention from your pupils in thundering tones. Do  not too often beg it from them as a favor, nor claim it as a right, nor  try habitually to excite it by preaching the importance of the subject.  Sometimes, indeed, you must do these things; but, the more you have to  do them, the less skilful teacher you will show yourself to be. Elicit  interest from within, by the warmth with which you care for the topic  yourself, and by following the laws I have laid down.    If the topic be highly abstract, show its nature by concrete examples.  If it be unfamiliar, trace some point of analogy in it with the known.  If it be inhuman, make it figure as part of a story. If it be  difficult, couple its acquisition with some prospect of personal gain.  Above all things, make sure that it shall run through certain inner  changes, since no unvarying object can possibly hold the mental field  for long. Let your pupil wander from one aspect to another of your  subject, if you do not wish him to wander from it altogether to  something else, variety in unity being the secret of all interesting  talk and thought. The relation of all these things to the native genius  of the instructor is too obvious to need comment again.    One more point, and I am done with the subject of attention. There is  unquestionably a great native variety among individuals in the type of  their attention. Some of us are naturally scatterbrained, and others  follow easily a train of connected thoughts without temptation to swerve  aside to other subjects. This seems to depend on a difference between  individuals in the type of their field of consciousness. In some persons  this is highly focalized and concentrated, and the focal ideas  predominate in determining association. In others we must suppose the  margin to be brighter, and to be filled with something like meteoric  showers of images, which strike into it at random, displacing the focal  ideas, and carrying association in their own direction. Persons of the  latter type find their attention wandering every minute, and must bring  it back by a voluntary pull. The others sink into a subject of  meditation deeply, and, when interrupted, are 'lost' for a moment before  they come back to the outer world.    The possession of such a steady faculty of attention is unquestionably a  great boon. Those who have it can work more rapidly, and with less  nervous wear and tear. I am inclined to think that no one who is without  it naturally can by any amount of drill or discipline attain it in a  very high degree. Its amount is probably a fixed characteristic of the  individual. But I wish to make a remark here which I shall have occasion  to make again in other connections. It is that no one need deplore  unduly the inferiority in himself of any one elementary faculty. This  concentrated type of attention is an elementary faculty: it is one of  the things that might be ascertained and measured by exercises in the  laboratory. But, having ascertained it in a number of persons, we could  never rank them in a scale of actual and practical mental efficiency  based on its degrees. The total mental efficiency of a man is the  resultant of the working together of all his faculties. He is too  complex a being for any one of them to have the casting vote. If any  one of them do have the casting vote, it is more likely to be the  strength of his desire and passion, the strength of the interest he  takes in what is proposed. Concentration, memory, reasoning power,  inventiveness, excellence of the senses,--all are subsidiary to this.  No matter how scatter-brained the type of a man's successive fields  of consciousness may be, if he really _care_ for a subject, he will  return to it incessantly from his incessant wanderings, and first and  last do more with it, and get more results from it, than another  person whose attention may be more continuous during a given interval,  but whose passion for the subject is of a more languid and less  permanent sort. Some of the most efficient workers I know are of the  ultra-scatterbrained type. One friend, who does a prodigious quantity of  work, has in fact confessed to me that, if he wants to get ideas on any  subject, he sits down to work at something else, his best results coming  through his mind-wanderings. This is perhaps an epigrammatic  exaggeration on his part; but I seriously think that no one of us need  be too much distressed at his own shortcomings in this regard. Our mind  may enjoy but little comfort, may be restless and feel confused; but it  may be extremely efficient all the same.          XII. MEMORY      We are following a somewhat arbitrary order. Since each and every  faculty we possess is either in whole or in part a resultant of the play  of our associations, it would have been as natural, after treating of  association, to treat of memory as to treat of interest and attention  next. But, since we did take the latter operations first, we must take  memory now without farther delay; for the phenomena of memory are among  the simplest and most immediate consequences of the fact that our mind  is essentially an associating machine. There is no more pre-eminent  example for exhibiting the fertility of the laws of association as  principles of psychological analysis. Memory, moreover, is so important  a faculty in the schoolroom that you are probably waiting with some  eagerness to know what psychology has to say about it for your help.    In old times, if you asked a person to explain why he came to be  remembering at that moment some particular incident in his previous  life, the only reply he could make was that his soul is endowed with a  faculty called memory; that it is the inalienable function of this  faculty to recollect; and that, therefore, he necessarily at that moment  must have a cognition of that portion of the past. This explanation by a  'faculty' is one thing which explanation by association has superseded  altogether. If, by saying we have a faculty of memory, you mean nothing  more than the fact that we can remember, nothing more than an abstract  name for our power inwardly to recall the past, there is no harm done:  we do have the faculty; for we unquestionably have such a power. But if,  by faculty, you mean a principle of _explanation of our general power to  recall_, your psychology is empty. The associationist psychology, on the  other hand, gives an explanation of each particular fact of  recollection; and, in so doing, it also gives an explanation of the  general faculty. The 'faculty' of memory is thus no real or ultimate  explanation; for it is itself explained as a result of the association  of ideas.    Nothing is easier than to show you just what I mean by this. Suppose I  am silent for a moment, and then say in commanding accents: \"Remember!  Recollect!\" Does your faculty of memory obey the order, and reproduce  any definite image from your past? Certainly not. It stands staring into  vacancy, and asking, \"What kind of a thing do you wish me to remember?\"  It needs in short, a _cue_. But, if I say, remember the date of your  birth, or remember what you had for breakfast, or remember the  succession of notes in the musical scale; then your faculty of memory  immediately produces the required result: the _'cue'_ determines its  vast set of potentialities toward a particular point. And if you now  look to see how this happens, you immediately perceive that the cue is  something _contiguously associated_ with the thing recalled. The words,  'date of my birth,' have an ingrained association with a particular  number, month, and year; the words, 'breakfast this morning,' cut off  all other lines of recall except those which lead to coffee and bacon  and eggs; the words, 'musical scale,' are inveterate mental neighbors of  do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, etc. The laws of association govern, in fact,  all the trains of our thinking which are not interrupted by sensations  breaking on us from without. Whatever appears in the mind must be  _introduced_; and, when introduced, it is as the associate of something  already there. This is as true of what you are recollecting as it is of  everything else you think of.    Reflection will show you that there are peculiarities in your memory  which would be quite whimsical and unaccountable if we were forced to  regard them as the product of a purely spiritual faculty. Were memory  such a faculty, granted to us solely for its practical use, we ought to  remember easiest whatever we most _needed_ to remember; and frequency of  repetition, recency, and the like, would play no part in the matter.  That we should best remember frequent things and recent things, and  forget things that are ancient or were experienced only once, could only  be regarded as an incomprehensible anomaly on such a view. But if we  remember because of our associations, and if these are (as the  physiological psychologists believe) due to our organized brain-paths,  we easily see how the law of recency and repetition should prevail.  Paths frequently and recently ploughed are those that lie most open,  those which may be expected most easily to lead to results. The laws of  our memory, as we find them, therefore are incidents of our  associational constitution; and, when we are emancipated from the  flesh, it is conceivable that they may no longer continue to obtain.    We may assume, then, that recollection is a resultant of our associative  processes, these themselves in the last analysis being most probably due  to the workings of our brain.    Descending more particularly into the faculty of memory, we have to  distinguish between its potential aspect as a magazine or storehouse and  its actual aspect as recollection now of a particular event. Our memory  contains all sorts of items which we do not now recall, but"]]]
