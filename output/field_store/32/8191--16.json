MRS. MULLIGAN (_speaks to a lady in audience_). My, my, is it  yourself, Mrs. ----? Sure, I'm glad to see ye out. It's a long time  since I've had the pleasure of seeing you. (_Speaks to several  children._) And there's ---- and ---- and ----. I'm glad to see all of  yeez. Sure, some day yeez must come over to me house in Mulligan Alley  and I'll let you play with the goat, Shamus O'Brien.    MRS. O'TOOLE. I see the young ladies over there, and each one of them  has a young man. My, my, it does me ould heart good to see the young  folks enjoying themselves. It ain't so many years since me and Pat was  courting each other just like the rest of yeez.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Mrs. O'Toole, do you see that young man sitting there  all by his lonesome? Ain't it a shame? And him such a good looking  young feller, too. I've a good notion to go over there and cheer him  up a bit. Maybe his girl is here with another fellow.    MRS. O'TOOLE. Sure, there's plenty of girls here without any fellows  at all, at all. Why should a young man sit all alone like a bump on a  log, whin there's so many handsome colleens waiting for the chance at  him?    MRS. MULLIGAN. Whist, Mrs. O'Toole, it's making him embarrassed yeez  are. Will you look at the red color in his face?    MRS. O'TOOLE. If ye ask me my opinion, Mollie Mulligan, sure and I  think he's after waiting fer one of yer own lovely daughters.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Well, he might go further and fare worse. Nora Eudora's  a fine girl, if I do say it myself.    MRS. O'TOOLE. Whist, here comes Mary Ann out in front of the curtain  to spake her piece.    (MARY ANN _comes in front of the curtain, makes a bow and recites:_)         LETTER TO SANTA CLAUS.         Blessed old Santa Claus, king of delights,       What are you doing these long winter nights?       Filling your budgets with trinkets and toys,       Wonderful gifts for the girls and the boys.       While you are planning for everything nice,       Pray let me give you a bit of advice.         Don't take it hard if I say in your ear,       Santa, I thought you were partial last year;       Loading the rich folks with everything gay,       Snubbing the poor ones who came in your way.       Now of all times of the year I am sure       This is the time to remember the poor.         Plenty of children there are in our city,       Who have no fathers or mothers to pity;       Plenty of people whose working and heeding       Scarcely can keep all their dear ones from needing.       Now, if I came every year in December,       These are the ones I would surely remember.         Once on a beautiful Christmas you know       Jesus our Saviour was born here below,       Patiently stooping to hunger and pain,       So He might save us, His lost ones, from shame;       Now if we love Him, He bids us to feed       All His poor brothers and sisters who need.         Blessed old Nick! I was sure if you knew it,       You would remember and certainly do it;       This year, at least, when you empty your pack,       Pray give a portion to all who may lack.       Then, if there's anything left and you can       Bring a small gift to wee Peter Pan.         _--Emily H. Miller.--Adapted._    MRS. O'TOOLE (_applauding vigorously_). Wasn't that dandy? Sure,  little Mary Ann has a wonderful education, so she has!    MRS. MULLIGAN. She takes after her own mother. I was just like her  when I was that age.    MRS. O'TOOLE. And you're just like her still, Mollie Mulligan. Sure  you're the sunshine of Mulligan Alley and the belle of Shantytown.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Whist now! It's covered I am wid blushes. But, hush! I  think the show is about to begin.      ACT III.    _Curtain rises disclosing the same scene. Three long sheets hang on  the line, reaching down to the floor and extending clear across the  stage. The children are behind the sheets. The line is about three and  one-half feet high. The table sets obliquely in front of the door at  R. It is covered with a sheet or long cloth reaching to the ground._  PATSY _and_ TEDDY _form the dwarf._ PATSY, _coatless, has a long pair  of striped stockings on over his arms, and a pair of shoes on his  hands, ornamented on insteps with large rosettes._ TEDDY _stands  behind him and thrusts his arms as far as they will go under_ PATSY'S  _armpits. A kind of a tunic covers both. Wear a large crimped frill or  an enormous turned-down collar._    PATSY _stands behind table and places his shoe-clad hands upon it,  which represent the feet of the dwarf. The door curtains are fastened  together a few inches above his head, concealing_ TEDDY.    PATSY _must lean slightly over the table or the legs will not appear  to support the body._    _When the curtain is up, enter_ MATSY _from L. dressed as a Showman._    MATSY (_bows to audience, speaks in a loud voice, using megaphone_).         Come and see Jumbo, Samson symbolical!       Come and see Slivers, Clown really comical!       Come and see Zip, the foremost of freaks!       Come and see Palestine's Sinister Sheiks!       Eager Equestriennes, each unexcelled,       Most mammoth menagerie ever beheld,       The Giant, the Fat Girl, the Lion-faced Man,       Aerial Artists from far-off Japan,       Audacious Acrobats shot from a gun,       Don't miss the greatest show under the sun!    Now, if you will kindly lend me your ears for a moment, I will fill  them free of charge with a few words concerning the world's greatest  assortment of marvelous monstrosities. In the first cell we have Senor  Macaroni Spaghetti from the land of the banana. The senor is  thirty-nine inches high, and, strangely enough, thirty-nine years old,  to say nothing of the fact that he weighs thirty-nine pounds. (PATSY  _scratches his nose with his foot._) He arrived last week by parcel  post to join our circus. The senor is looking for a wife. Oh, you  needn't laugh! It's true. Some of you near-sighted ladies should have  brought magnifying glasses, for Senor Macaroni Spaghetti is the  smallest speck of humanity that ever lived in captivity. He stands on  a silver dollar and puts his hand in a thimble. (TEDDY _makes funny  gestures during this entire speech._) The senor will now entertain you  in his entertaining way.    PATSY (_sings_).         SPAGHETTI FROM OLD ITALY.         (Music on page 107)         Me name is Spaghetti, I came o'er the sea,       To visit this land from old Italy,       I have a small monkey, he jumps with a string,       And if he was here to you he would sing:       (_Dances._)       Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!    (_Repeat until end._)         I once fell in love with the sweet Antoinette,       She say she will marry the little Spaghett,       But she said she no like-a a hand-organ man,       So I stand on the corner and sell-a banan.       (_Dances._)       Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!    (_Repeat until end._)         I wed Antoinetta and live in a flat,       I buy-a fine clothes and a big silk-a hat,       I make-a much money and this little gent,       He maybe some day will be big President.       (_Dances._)       Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!    (_Repeat until end._)    MATSY. And now, ladies and gentlemen, I'll call your attention to the  seven little Sunbonnet babies. Behold them, them famous Mulligan  twins. (_Exits L._)    _The heads of_ NORA, MICKY, BRIDGET, MARY ANN, MELISSA, CLARISSA _and_  PETER _appear above the sheets at rear. Each wears a large sunbonnet.  They sing to the tune \"Tramp, Tramp, Tramp!\"_         Little Mulligans are we, and our hearts are light and free,         For it's Christmas Eve and soon we'll be in bed,       We're peculiar little folks, full of jollity and jokes,       And you ought to see us stand upon our head!             Tramp, tramp, tramp, we'll soon be marching,           We are going off to bed,           But before we leave you now,           Each of us will show you how           Little Mulligan can stand upon her head.    (_All disappear under sheet. They repeat chorus and hold up their arms  above the sheet. The arms are covered with stockings and shoes are on  their hands. They slap hands together, making feet dance, etc._)         Tramp, tramp, tramp, we'll soon be marching,       We are going off to bed,       But before we leave you now,       Each of us will show you how       Little Mulligan can stand upon her head.    (_Repeat._)    MRS. MULLIGAN (_from audience_). Nora! Bridget! Mary Ann! What do ye  mane! You'll kill yourselves entirely. (_Rushes to the stage, followed  by_ MRS. O'TOOLE.) If you stand on your head like that, all your  brains will rush down into your fate.    NORA (_head above curtain_). That's the way they did in the show.  (_All come out on stage._)    MRS. O'TOOLE. Well, well, well, wonders will never cease. Sure, I  niver spint such a fine Christmas Eve in all me life before.    MRS. MULLIGAN (_stands C. facing audience, surrounded by the ten  children._) Sure, I think we've had a fine Christmas celebration,  don't you? And before ye go let this sink down deep in your hearts and  minds--it doesn't take money and fine clothes and costly gifts to make  a fine Christmas at all, at all. All it takes is loving hearts and  loving hands, and merry faces of happy boys and girls. We didn't have  any money--but you see what a lovely time we've had--and it's all  because the spirit of Christmas was in our hearts--and the spirit of  Christmas means love, and love is the greatest thing in all the world.  Merry Christmas to all of yeez, and may ye never regret the time you  spent Christmas Eve with the ten little Mulligans.    CURTAIN.      NOTES TO THE MANAGER.    WHERE THE MULLIGANS LIVED.    The scenery is very simple or may be dispensed with entirely.  Entrances R. and L. and a window at the rear are necessary. An old  table stands in front of the window, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19831"],[0,"The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Volume 1 (#15)"],[1,"the fulfillment of the purposes for      which it was formed. Whenever we shall be taught that the      Democratic party is recreant to its principles; whenever we      shall learn that it can not be relied upon to maintain the great      measures which constitute its vitality--I for one shall be ready      to leave it. And so, when we declare our tenacious adherence to      the Union, it is the Union of the Constitution. If the compact      between the States is to be trampled into the dust; if anarchy      is to be substituted for the usurpation and consolidation which      threatened the Government at an earlier period; if the Union is      to become powerless for the purposes for which it was      established, and we are vainly to appeal to it for      protection--then, sir, conscious of the rectitude of our course,      the justice of our cause, self-reliant, yet humbly, confidingly      trusting in the arm that guided and protected our fathers, we      look beyond the confines of the Union for the maintenance of our      rights. An habitual reverence and cherished affection for the      Government will bind us to it longer than our interests would      suggest or require; but he is a poor student of the world's      history who does not understand that communities at last must      yield to the dictates of their interests. That the affection,      the mutual desire for the mutual good, which existed among our      fathers, may be weakened in succeeding generations by the denial      of right, and hostile demonstration, until the equality      guaranteed but not secured within the Union may be sought for      without it, must be evident to even a careless observer of our      race. It is time to be up and doing. There is yet time to remove      the causes of dissension and alienation which are now      distracting, and have for years past divided, the country.        \"If the Senator correctly described me as having at a former      period, against my own preferences and opinions, acquiesced in      the decision of my party; if, when I had youth, when physical      vigor gave promise of many days, and the future was painted in      the colors of hope, I could thus surrender my own convictions,      my own prejudices, and cooeperate with my political friends      according to their views of the best method of promoting the      public good--now, when the years of my future can not be many,      and experience has sobered the hopeful tints of youth's gilding;      when, approaching the evening of life, the shadows are reversed,      and the mind turns retrospectively, it is not to be supposed      that I would abandon lightly, or idly put on trial, the party to      which I have steadily adhered. It is rather to be assumed that      conservatism, which belongs to the timidity or caution of      increasing years, would lead me to cling to, to be supported by,      rather than to cast off, the organization with which I have been      so long connected. If I am driven to consider the necessity of      separating myself from those old and dear relations, of      discarding the accustomed support, under circumstances such as I      have described, might not my friends who differ from me pause      and inquire whether there is not something involved in it which      calls for their careful revision?        \"I desire no divided flag for the Democratic party.        \"Our principles are national; they belong to every State of the      Union; and, though elections may be lost by their assertion,      they constitute the only foundation on which we can maintain      power, on which we can again rise to the dignity the Democracy      once possessed. Does not the Senator from Illinois see in the      sectional character of the vote be received,[16] that his      opinions are not acceptable to every portion of the country? Is      not the fact that the resolutions adopted by seventeen States,      on which the greatest reliance must be placed for Democratic      support, are in opposition to the dogma to which he still      clings, a warning that, if he persists and succeeds in forcing      his theory upon the Democratic party, its days are numbered? We      ask only for the Constitution. We ask of the Democracy only from      time to time to declare, as current exigencies may indicate,      what the Constitution was intended to secure and provide. Our      flag bears no new device. Upon its folds our principles are      written in living light; all proclaiming the constitutional      Union, justice, equality, and fraternity of our ocean-bound      domain, for a limitless future.\"      [Footnote 14: The words, \"within the limits of its constitutional  powers,\" were subsequently added to this resolution, on the suggestion  of Mr. Toombs, of Georgia, with the approval of the mover.]    [Footnote 15: The speech of the author, delivered on the 7th of May  ensuing, in exposition of these resolutions, will be found in Appendix  F.]    [Footnote 16: In the Democratic Convention, which had been recently held  in Charleston.

It required all the  power of wisdom and patriotism, animated by the affection engendered by  common sufferings and dangers, to keep these rivalries under restraint,  and to effect those compromises which it was fondly hoped would insure  the harmony and mutual good offices of each for the benefit of all. It  was in this spirit of patriotism and confidence in the continuance of  such abiding good will as would for all time preclude hostile  aggression, that Virginia ceded, for the use of the confederated States,  all that vast extent of territory lying north of the Ohio River, out of  which have since been formed five States and part of a sixth. The  addition of these States has accrued entirely to the preponderance of  the Northern section over that from which the donation proceeded, and to  the disturbance of that equilibrium which existed at the close of the  war of the Revolution.    It may not be out of place here to refer to the fact that the grievances  which led to that war were directly inflicted upon the Northern  colonies. Those of the South had no material cause of complaint; but,  actuated by sympathy for their Northern brethren, and a devotion to the  principles of civil liberty and community independence, which they had  inherited from their Anglo-Saxon ancestry, and which were set forth in  the Declaration of Independence, they made common cause with their  neighbors, and may, at least, claim to have done their full share in the  war that ensued.    By the exclusion of the South, in 1820, from all that part of the  Louisiana purchase lying north of the parallel of thirty-six degrees  thirty minutes, and not included in the State of Missouri, by the  extension of that line of exclusion to embrace the territory acquired  from Texas; and by the appropriation of _all_ the territory obtained  from Mexico under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, both north and south  of that line, it may be stated with approximate accuracy that the North  had monopolized to herself more than three fourths of all that had been  added to the domain of the United States since the Declaration of  Independence. This inequality, which began, as has been shown, in the  more generous than wise confidence of the South, was employed to obtain  for the North the lion's share of what was afterward added at the cost  of the public treasure and the blood of patriots. I do not care to  estimate the relative proportion contributed by each of the two  sections.    Nor was this the only cause that operated to disappoint the reasonable  hopes and to blight the fair prospects under which the original compact  was formed. The effects of discriminating duties upon imports have been  referred to in a former chapter--favoring the manufacturing region,  which was the North; burdening the exporting region, which was the  South; and so imposing upon the latter a double tax: one, by the  increased price of articles of consumption, which, so far as they were  of home production, went into the pockets of the manufacturer; the  other, by the diminished value of articles of export, which was so much  withheld from the pockets of the agriculturist. In like manner the power  of the majority section was employed to appropriate to itself an unequal  share of the public disbursements. These combined causes--the possession  of more territory, more money, and a wider field for the employment of  special labor--all served to attract immigration; and, with increasing  population, the greed grew by what it fed on.    This became distinctly manifest when the so-called \"Republican\"  Convention assembled in Chicago, on May 16, 1860, to nominate a  candidate for the Presidency. It was a purely sectional body.
