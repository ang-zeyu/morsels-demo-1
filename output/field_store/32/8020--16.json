It was the news of Jackson's approaching departure  for Bombay that finally precipitated the catastrophe. The murderer  practised carefully with the pistol given to him and other precautions  were taken so that, even if the first attempt was foiled, Jackson should  not escape alive from the theatre--the native theatre which he had been  asked to honour with his attendance. So the young Chitpavan Brahman,  Ananta Luxman Kanhere, waylaid the Englishman as he was entering, shot  him first in the back, and then emptied the contents of his revolver  upon him, as he turned round. Mr. Jackson fell dead in front of the  friends who were accompanying him, two young English ladies and a young  civilian of his staff, who had only joined a month before from England  and faced without flinching this gruesome initiation into the service.  It all happened in a moment, and the native Deputy Collector, Mr.  Palshikar, who leapt forward to Mr. Jackson's assistance, was only able  to strike down the murderer and tear from him the second weapon with  which he was armed. Thanks also to Mr. Palshikar's presence of mind,  information was at once sent to the railway station, and the escape of  some of the accomplices prevented, whose confessions materially helped  in promoting the ends of justice.    But besides the facts which were brought out in evidence during the  trial at Bombay, there are some features connected with the crime to  which attention may be usefully directed, as they lie outside the  province of the Law Courts. In the first place, it must be noted that  not only the murderer but the majority of those implicated in the crime  were Chitpavan Brahmans, and at the same time they were the strange  products both of the Western education which we have imported into India  and of the religious revivalism which underlies the present political  agitation. They were certainly moral, if not physical, degenerates, and  most of them notoriously depraved, none bearing in this respect a worse  character than the actual murderer. I happened, when at Nasik, to see  the latter whilst he was performing his ablutions in front of the  Government building in which he was confined. Four policemen were in  charge of him, but he seemed absolutely unconcerned, and after having  washed himself leisurely, proceeded to discharges his devotions, looking  around all the while with a certain self-satisfied composure, before  returning to his cell. His appearance was puny, undergrown, and  effeminate, and his small, narrow, and elongated head markedly  prognathous, but he exercised over some of his companions a passionate,  if unnatural, fascination which, I have been told by one who was present  at the trial, betrayed itself shamelessly in their attitude and the  glances they exchanged with him during the proceedings. Distorted pride  of race and of caste combined with neuroticism and eroticism appear to  have co-operated here in producing as complete a type of moral  perversion as the records of criminal pathology can well show.    What are the secret forces by which these wretched puppets were set in  motion? Their activity was certainly not spontaneous. Who was it that  pulled the strings? There is reason to believe that the revolver with  which the murder was committed was one of a batch sent out by the Indian  ringleaders, who until the murder of Sir W. Curzon-Wyllie, had their  headquarters at the famous \"India House,\" in Highgate, of which Swami  Krishnavarma was originally one of the moving spirits. Upon this and  other cognate points the trial of Vinayak Savarkar, formerly the London  correspondent of one of Tilak's organs and a familiar of the \"India  House,\" and of some twenty-five other Hindus on various charges of  conspiracy which is now proceeding in the High Court of Bombay, may be  expected to throw some very instructive light.    The atmosphere of Nasik was no doubt exceptionally favourable for such  morbid growths. For Nasik is no ordinary provincial town of India. It is  one of the great strongholds of Hinduism. Its population is only about  25,000, but of these about 9,000 belong to the Brahmanical caste, though  only about 1,000 are Chitpavan Brahmans, the rest being mainly Deshastha  Brahmans, another great sept of the Deccanee sacerdotal caste. It is a  city of peculiar sanctity with the Hindus. The sacred Godavery--so  sacred that it is called there the _Ganga_--i.e. the Ganges--flows  through it, and its bathing _ghats_ which line the river banks and its  ancient temples and innumerable shrines attract a constant flow of  pilgrims from all parts of India. Indeed, many of the great Hindu  houses of India maintain there a family priest to look after their  spiritual interests. Nasik was, moreover, a city beloved of the Peshwas,  and, next to Poona preserves, perhaps, more intimate associations with  the great days of the Mahratta Empire than any other city of the Deccan.  But though no doubt these facts might account for a certain latent  bitterness against the alien rulers who dashed the cup of victory away  from the lips of the Mahrattas, just as the latter were establishing  their ascendency on the crumbling ruins of the Moghul Empire, they do  not suffice to account for the attitude of the people generally in  presence of such a crime as the assassination of Mr. Jackson. For if  murder is a heinous crime by whomsoever it may be committed, it ranks  amongst Hindus as specially heinous when committed by a Brahman. How is  it that in this instance, instead of outcasting the murderer, many  Brahmans continued more or less secretly to glorify his crime as \"the  striking down of the flag from the fort\"? How is it that, when there was  ample evidence to show that murder had been in the air of Nasik for  several months before the perpetration of the deed, not a single  warning, not a single hint, ever reached Mr. Jackson, except from the  police, whose advice, unfortunately, his blindly trustful nature led him  to ignore to the very end? How is it that, even after its perpetration,  though there was much genuine sympathy with the victim and many eloquent  speeches were delivered to express righteous abhorrence of the crime, no  practical help was afforded to the authorities in pursuing the  ramifications of the conspiracy which had \"brought disgrace on the holy  city of Nasik\"?    All this opens up wide fields for speculation, but there is one point  which a statement solemnly made by the murderer of Mr. Jackson has  placed beyond the uncertainties of speculation. In reply to the  magistrate who asked him why he committed the murder, Kanhere said:--       I read of many instances of oppression in the _Kesari_, the     _Rashtramat_ and the _Kal_ and other newspapers. I think     that by killing _sahibs_ [Englishmen] we people can get justice.     I never got injustice myself nor did any one I know. I now     regret killing Mr. Jackson. I killed a good man causelessly.    Can anything be much more eloquent and convincing than the terrible  pathos of this confession?[6] The three papers named by Kanhere were  Tilak's organs. It was no personal experience or knowledge of his own  that had driven Kanhere to his frenzied deed, but the slow persistent  poison dropped into his ear by the Tilak Press. Though it was Kanhere's  hand that struck down \"a good man causelessly,\" was not Tilak rather  than Kanhere the real author of the murder? It was merely the story of  the Poona murders of 1897 over again.    Other incidents besides the Nasik tragedy have occurred since Tilak's  conviction to show how dangerous was the spirit which his doctrines had  aroused. One of the, gravest, symptomatically, was the happily  unsuccessful attempt to throw a bomb at the Viceroy and Lady Minto  whilst they were driving through the streets of Ahmedabad during their  visit to the Bombay Presidency last November. For that outrage  constituted an ominous breach of all the old Hindu traditions which  invest the personal representative of the Sovereign with a special  sanctity.    But in spite of spasmodic outbreaks, of which we may not yet have seen  the end, aggressive disloyalty in the Deccan has been at least  temporarily set back since the downfall of Tilak. The firmer attitude  adopted by the Government of India and such repressive measures as the  Press Act, combined with judicious reforms, have done much; but it was  by the prosecution of Tilak that the forces of militant unrest lost  their ablest and boldest leader--perhaps the only one who might have  concentrated their direction, not only in the Deccan, but in the whole  of India, in his own hands and given to the movement, with all its  varied and often conflicting tendencies, an organization and unity which  it still happily seems to lack.          CHAPTER V.    POONA AND KOLHAPUR.      It is not, after all, in British India (i.e., in that part of India  which we directly administer) that the Brahmanical and reactionary  character of Indian unrest, at any rate in the Deccan, can best be  studied. There it can always be disguised under the \"patriotic\" aspects  of a revolt against alien rule. To appreciate its real tendencies we  must go to a Native State of the Deccan about 100 miles south of Poona.  Kolhapur is the most important of the Native States under the charge of  the Bombay Government, and its ruler is the only ruling Mahratta chief  who can claim direct descent from the great Shivaji, the  \"Shivaji-Maharaj\" whose cult Tilak made one of the central features of  his political propaganda. He is the \"Chhatrapati Maharajah,\" and is  acknowledged to be as such the head of the Mahratta Princes of India.  One would have thought that such a lineage"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16459"],[0,"Musical Memories (#15)"],[1,"about the Dante Symphony. I have read somewhere that Liszt  used pages to produce an effect which Berlioz accomplished in the  apparition of Mephistopheles in _Faust_ with three notes. This  comparison is unjust. Berlioz's happy discovery is a work of genius and  he alone could have invented it. But the sudden appearance of the Devil  is one thing and the depiction of Hell quite another. Berlioz tried such  a depiction at the end of the Damnation, and in spite of the strange  vocabulary of the chorus, \"Irimiru Karabrao, Sat raik Irkimour,\" and  other pretty tricks, he succeeded no better than Liszt. As a matter of  fact the opposite was the case.          CHAPTER XIII    BERLIOZ'S REQUIEM      The reading of the score of Berlioz's _Requiem_ makes it appear  singularly old-fashioned, but this is true of most of the romantic  dramas, which, like the _Requiem_, show up better in actual performance.  It is easy to rail at the vehemence of the Romanticists, but it is not  so easy to equal the effect of _Hernani_, _Lucrece Borgia_ and the  _Symphonie fantastique_ on the public. For with all their faults these  works had a marvellous success. The truth is that their vehemence was  sincere and not artificial. The Romanticists had faith in their works  and there is nothing like faith to produce lasting results.    Reicha and Leuseur were, as we know, Berlioz's instructors. Leuseur was  the author of numerous works and wrote a good deal of church music. Some  of his religious works were really beautiful, but he had strange  obsessions. Berlioz greatly admired his master and could not help  showing, especially in his earlier works, traces of this admiration.  That is the reason for the syncopated and jerky passages without rhyme  or reason and which can only be explained by his unconscious imitation  of Leuseur's faults. In imitating a model the resemblances occur in the  faults and not in the excellences, for the latter are inimitable. So the  excellences of the _Requiem_ are not due to Leuseur but to Berlioz. He  had already thrown off the trammels of school and shown all the richness  of his vigorous originality to which the value of his scores is due.    In his _Memoirs_ Berlioz related the tribulations of his _Requiem_. It  was ordered by the government, laid aside for a time, and, finally,  performed at the Invalides on the occasion of the capture of Constantine  (in Algeria) and the funeral services of General Damremont. He was  astonished at the lack of sympathy and even actual hostility that he  encountered. It would have been more astonishing if he had experienced  anything else.    [Illustration: Hector Berlioz]    We must remember that at this time Berton, who sang _Quand on est  toujours vertuex, on aime a voir lever l'aurore_, passed for a great  man. Beethoven's symphonies were a novelty, in Paris at least, and a  scandal. Haydn's symphonies inspired a critic to write, \"What a noise,  what a noise!\" Orchestras were merely collections of thirty or forty  musicians.    We can imagine, therefore, the stupefaction and horror when a young man,  just out of school, demanded fifty violins, twenty violas, twenty  violoncellos, eighteen contrabasses, four flutes, four oboes, four  clarinets, eight bassoons, twelve horns, and a chorus of two hundred  voices as a minimum. And that is not all. The _Tuba Mirum_ necessitates  an addition of thirty-eight trumpets and trombones, divided into four  orchestras and placed at the four cardinal points of the compass.  Besides, there have to be eight pairs of drums, played by ten drummers,  four tam-tams, and ten cymbals.    The story of this array of drums is rather interesting. Reicha,  Berlioz's first teacher, had the original idea of playing drum taps in  chords of three or four beats. In order to try out this effect, he  composed a choral piece, _L'Harmonie des Spheres_, which was published  in connection with his _Traite d'Harmonie_. But Reicha's genius did not  suffice for this task. He was a good musician, but no more than that.  His choral piece was insignificant and remained a dead letter. Berlioz  took this lost effect and used it in his _Tuba Mirum_.    However, it must be confessed that this effect does not come up to  expectations. In a church or a concert hall we hear a confused and  terrifying mingling of sounds, and from time to time we note a change in  the depth of tone but we are unable to distinguish the pitch of the  chords.    I shall never forget the impression this _Tuba Mirum_ made on me when I  first heard it at St. Eustache under Berlioz's own direction. It  amounted to an absolute neglect of the author's directions. The  beginning of the work is marked _moderato_, later, as the brass comes  in, the movement is quickened and becomes _andante maestro_. Most of the  time the _moderato_ was interpreted as an _allegro_, and the _andante  maestro_ as a simple _moderato_. If the terrific fanfare did not  become, as some one ventured to call it, a \"Setting Out for the Hunt,\"  it might well have been the accompaniment for a sovereign's entrance to  his capital. In order to give this fanfare its grandiose character, the  author did not take easy refuge in the wailings of a minor key, but he  burst into the splendors of a major key. A certain grandeur of movement  alone can preserve its gigantesque quality and impression of power.    Granting all his good intentions, in trying to give us a suggestion of  the last judgment by his accumulation of brass, drums, cymbals, and  tam-tams, Berlioz makes us think of Thor among the giants trying to  empty the drinking-horn which was filled from the sea, and only  succeeding in lowering it a little. Yet even that was an accomplishment.    Berlioz spoke scornfully of Mozart's _Tuba Mirum_ with its single  trombone. \"One trombone,\" he exclaimed, \"when a hundred would be none  too many!\" Berlioz wanted to make us really hear the trumpets of the  archangels. Mozart with the seven notes of his one trombone suggested  the same idea and the suggestion is sufficient.    We must not forget, however, that here we are in the midst of a world of  romanticism, in a world of color and picturesqueness, which could not  content itself with so little. And we must remember this fact, if we  would not be irritated by the oddities of _L'Hostias_, with its deep  trombone notes which seem to come from the very depths of Hell. There is  no use in trying to find out what these notes mean. Berlioz told us  himself that he discovered these notes at a time when they were almost  unknown and he wanted to use them. The contrast between these terrifying  notes and the wailing of the flutes is especially curious. We find  nothing analogous to this anywhere else.    The delightful _Purgatoire_, where the author sees a chorus of souls in  Purgatory, is much better. His Purgatory has no punishments nor any  griefs save the awaiting, the long and painful awaiting, of eternal  happiness. There is a processional in which the fugue and melody  alternate in the most felicitous manner. There are sighs and plaints,  all haunting in their extreme expressiveness, a great variety beneath an  appearance of monotony, and from time to time two wailing notes. These  notes are always the same, as the chorus gives them as a plaint, and  they are both affecting and artistic. At the end comes a dim ray of  light and hope. This is the only one in the work save the Amen at the  end, for Faith and Hope should not be looked for here. The supplications  sound like prayers which do not expect to be answered. No one would dare  to describe this work as profane, but whether it is religious or not is  a question. As Boschot has said, what it expresses above all is terror  in the presence of annihilation.    When the _Requiem_ was played at the Trocadero, the audience was greatly  impressed and filed out slowly. They did not say, \"What a masterpiece!\"  but \"What an orchestra leader!\" Nowadays people go to see a conductor  direct the orchestra just as they go to hear a tenor, and they arrogate  to themselves the right to judge the conductors as they do the tenors.  But what a fine sport it is! The qualities of an orchestra conductor  which the public appreciates are his elegance, his gestures, his  precision, and the expressiveness of his mimicry, all of which are more  often directed at the audience than at the orchestra. But all these  things are of secondary consideration. What makes up an orchestra  conductor's worth are the excellence of execution he obtains from the  musicians and the perfect interpretation of the author's meaning--which  the audience does not understand. If such an important detail as the  author's meaning is obscured and slighted, if a work is disfigured by  absurd movements and by an expression which is entirely different from  what the author wanted, the public may be dazzled and an execrable  conductor, provided his poses are good, may fascinate his audience and  be praised to the skies.    Formerly the conductor never saluted his audience. The understanding was  that the work and not the conductor was applauded. The Italians and  Germans changed all that. Lamoureux was the first to introduce this  exotic custom in France. The public was a little surprised at first, but  they soon got used to it. In Italy the conductor comes on the stage  with the artists to salute the audience. There is nothing more laughable  than to see him, as the last note of an opera dies away, jump down from  his stand and run like mad to reach the stage in time.    The excellence of the work of English choristers has been highly and  justly praised. Perhaps it would be fairer not to praise them so  unreservedly when we are so severe on our own. Justice often leaves  something to be desired. At all events it must be admitted that Berlioz  treated the voices in an unfortunate way. Like Beethoven, he made no  distinction between a part for a voice and an instrument. While except "]]]
