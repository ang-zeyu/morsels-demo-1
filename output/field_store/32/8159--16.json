Four months before the Bab's  martyrdom Tihran in its turn was to participate, to a lesser degree and  under less dramatic circumstances, in the carnage that was besmirching the  face of the country. A tragedy was being enacted in that city which was to  prove but a prelude to the orgy of massacre which, after the Bab's  execution, convulsed its inhabitants and sowed consternation as far as the  outlying provinces. It originated in the orders and was perpetrated under  the very eyes of the irate and murderous Amir-Nizam, supported by Mahmud  _Kh_an-i-Kalantar, and aided by a certain Husayn, one of the 'ulamas of  Ka_sh_an. The heroes of that tragedy were the Seven Martyrs of Tihran, who  represented the more important classes among their countrymen, and who  deliberately refused to purchase life by that mere lip-denial which, under  the name of taqiyyih, _Sh_i'ah Islam had for centuries recognized as a  wholly justifiable and indeed commendable subterfuge in the hour of peril.  Neither the repeated and vigorous intercessions of highly placed members  of the professions to which these martyrs belonged, nor the considerable  sums which, in the case of one of them--the noble and serene Haji Mirza  Siyyid 'Ali, the Bab's maternal uncle--affluent merchants of _Sh_iraz and  Tihran were eager to offer as ransom, nor the impassioned pleas of state  officials on behalf of another--the pious and highly esteemed dervish,  Mirza Qurban-'Ali--nor even the personal intervention of the Amir-Nizam,  who endeavored to induce both of these brave men to recant, could succeed  in persuading any of the seven to forego the coveted laurels of martyrdom.  The defiant answers which they flung at their persecutors; the ecstatic  joy which seized them as they drew near the scene of their death; the  jubilant shouts they raised as they faced their executioner; the poignancy  of the verses which, in their last moments, some of them recited; the  appeals and challenges they addressed to the multitude of onlookers who  gazed with stupefaction upon them; the eagerness with which the last three  victims strove to precede one another in sealing their faith with their  blood; and lastly, the atrocities which a bloodthirsty foe degraded itself  by inflicting upon their dead bodies which lay unburied for three days and  three nights in the Sabzih-Maydan, during which time thousands of  so-called devout _Sh_i'ahs kicked their corpses, spat upon their faces,  pelted, cursed, derided, and heaped refuse upon them--these were the chief  features of the tragedy of the Seven Martyrs of Tihran, a tragedy which  stands out as one of the grimmest scenes witnessed in the course of the  early unfoldment of the Faith of Baha'u'llah. Little wonder that the Bab,  bowed down by the weight of His accumulated sorrows in the Fortress of  _Ch_ihriq, should have acclaimed and glorified them, in the pages of a  lengthy eulogy which immortalized their fidelity to His Cause, as those  same \"Seven Goats\" who, according to Islamic tradition, should, on the Day  of Judgment, \"walk in front\" of the promised Qa'im, and whose death was to  precede the impending martyrdom of their true Shepherd.          Chapter IV: The Execution of the Bab      The waves of dire tribulation that violently battered at the Faith, and  eventually engulfed, in rapid succession, the ablest, the dearest and most  trusted disciples of the Bab, plunged Him, as already observed, into  unutterable sorrow. For no less than six months the Prisoner of _Ch_ihriq,  His chronicler has recorded, was unable to either write or dictate.  Crushed with grief by the evil tidings that came so fast upon Him, of the  endless trials that beset His ablest lieutenants, by the agonies suffered  by the besieged and the shameless betrayal of the survivors, by the woeful  afflictions endured by the captives and the abominable butchery of men,  women and children, as well as the foul indignities heaped on their  corpses, He, for nine days, His amanuensis has affirmed, refused to meet  any of His friends, and was reluctant to touch the meat and drink that was  offered Him. Tears rained continually from His eyes, and profuse  expressions of anguish poured forth from His wounded heart, as He  languished, for no less than five months, solitary and disconsolate, in  His prison.    The pillars of His infant Faith had, for the most part, been hurled down  at the first onset of the hurricane that had been loosed upon it. Quddus,  immortalized by Him as Ismu'llahi'l-A_kh_ir (the Last Name of God); on  whom Baha'u'llah's Tablet of Kullu't-Ta'am later conferred the sublime  appellation of Nuqtiy-i-U_kh_ra (the Last Point); whom He elevated, in  another Tablet, to a rank second to none except that of the Herald of His  Revelation; whom He identifies, in still another Tablet, with one of the  \"Messengers charged with imposture\" mentioned in the Qur'an; whom the  Persian Bayan extolled as that fellow-pilgrim round whom mirrors to the  number of eight Vahids revolve; on whose \"detachment and the sincerity of  whose devotion to God's will God prideth Himself amidst the Concourse on  high;\" whom 'Abdu'l-Baha designated as the \"Moon of Guidance;\" and whose  appearance the Revelation of St. John the Divine anticipated as one of the  two \"Witnesses\" into whom, ere the \"second woe is past,\" the \"spirit of  life from God\" must enter--such a man had, in the full bloom of his youth,  suffered, in the Sabzih-Maydan of Barfuru_sh_, a death which even Jesus  Christ, as attested by Baha'u'llah, had not faced in the hour of His  greatest agony. Mulla Husayn, the first Letter of the Living, surnamed the  Babu'l-Bab (the Gate of the Gate); designated as the \"Primal Mirror;\" on  whom eulogies, prayers and visiting Tablets of a number equivalent to  thrice the volume of the Qur'an had been lavished by the pen of the Bab;  referred to in these eulogies as \"beloved of My Heart;\" the dust of whose  grave, that same Pen had declared, was so potent as to cheer the sorrowful  and heal the sick; whom \"the creatures, raised in the beginning and in the  end\" of the Babi Dispensation, envy, and will continue to envy till the  \"Day of Judgment;\" whom the Kitab-i-Iqan acclaimed as the one but for whom  \"God would not have been established upon the seat of His mercy, nor  ascended the throne of eternal glory;\" to whom Siyyid Kazim had paid such  tribute that his disciples suspected that the recipient of such praise  might well be the promised One Himself--such a one had likewise, in the  prime of his manhood, died a martyr's death at Tabarsi. Vahid, pronounced  in the Kitab-i-Iqan to be the \"unique and peerless figure of his age,\" a  man of immense erudition and the most preeminent figure to enlist under  the banner of the new Faith, to whose \"talents and saintliness,\" to whose  \"high attainments in the realm of science and philosophy\" the Bab had  testified in His Dala'il-i-Sab'ih (Seven Proofs), had already, under  similar circumstances, been swept into the maelstrom of another upheaval,  and was soon to quaff in his turn the cup drained by the heroic martyrs of  Mazindaran. Hujjat, another champion of conspicuous audacity, of  unsubduable will, of remarkable originality and vehement zeal, was being,  swiftly and inevitably, drawn into the fiery furnace whose flames had  already enveloped Zanjan and its environs. The Bab's maternal uncle, the  only father He had known since His childhood, His shield and support and  the trusted guardian of both His mother and His wife, had, moreover, been  sundered from Him by the axe of the executioner in Tihran. No less than  half of His chosen disciples, the Letters of the Living, had already  preceded Him in the field of martyrdom. Tahirih, though still alive, was  courageously pursuing a course that was to lead her inevitably to her  doom.    A fast ebbing life, so crowded with the accumulated anxieties,  disappointments, treacheries and sorrows of a tragic ministry, now moved  swiftly towards its climax. The most turbulent period of the Heroic Age of  the new Dispensation was rapidly attaining its culmination. The cup of  bitter woes which the Herald of that Dispensation had tasted was now full  to overflowing. Indeed, He Himself had already foreshadowed His own  approaching death. In the Kitab-i-Panj-_Sh_a'n, one of His last works, He  had alluded to the fact that the sixth Naw-Ruz after the declaration of  His mission would be the last He was destined to celebrate on earth. In  His interpretation of the letter Ha, He had voiced His craving for  martyrdom, while in the Qayyumu'l-Asma He had actually prophesied the  inevitability of such a consummation of His glorious career. Forty days  before His final departure from _Ch_ihriq He had even collected all the  documents in His possession, and placed them, together with His pen-case,  His seals and His rings, in the hands of Mulla Baqir, a Letter of the  Living, whom He instructed to entrust them to Mulla  'Abdu'l-Karim-i-Qazvini, surnamed Mirza Ahmad, who was to deliver them to  Baha'u'llah in Tihran.    While the convulsions of Mazindaran and Nayriz were pursuing their bloody  course the Grand Vizir of Nasiri'd-Din _Sh_ah, anxiously pondering the  significance of these dire happenings, and apprehensive of their  repercussions on his countrymen, his government and his sovereign, was  feverishly revolving in his mind that fateful decision which was not only  destined to leave its indelible imprint on the fortunes of his country,  but was to be fraught with such incalculable consequences for the  destinies of the whole of mankind. The repressive measures taken against  the followers of the Bab, he was by now fully convinced, had but served to  inflame their zeal, steel their resolution and confirm their loyalty to  their persecuted Faith. The Bab's isolation and captivity had produced the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19279"],[0,"Memorials of the Faithful (#15)"],[1,"two are about to leave for Ba_gh_dad,\" his letter said. \"They have  shown me every courtesy, and have also asked me for an introduction. I had  no refuge or shelter except Your bounty; thus I beg of You to show them  favor.\" The superscription, that is, the address he had written on the  envelope was: \"To His Eminence Baha'u'llah, Leader of the Babis.\" The  merchants presented this letter to Baha'u'llah at the head of the bridge,  and when He inquired about it their reply was: \"In Diyarbakr, the  Il_kh_ani gave us particulars as to this Cause.\" Then they accompanied Him  to His house.    When the Blessed Beauty entered the family apartments, Aqay-i-Kalim was  there to meet Him. Baha'u'llah cried out, \"Kalim, Kalim! The fame of the  Cause of God has reached as far as Diyarbakr!\" And He was smiling,  jubilant.    Mirza Musa was indeed a true brother to the Blessed Beauty; this is why he  remained steadfast, under all conditions, to the very end. Unto him be  praise and salutations, and the breath of life, and glory; upon him be  mercy and grace.            HAJI MUHAMMAD KHAN      Another of those who left their homes and came to settle in the  neighborhood of Baha'u'llah was Haji Muhammad _Kh_an. This distinguished  man, a native of Sistan, was a Balu_ch_. When he was very young, he caught  fire and became a mystic--an arif, or adept. As a wandering dervish,  completely selfless, he went out from his home and, following the dervish  rule, traveled about in search of his mur_sh_id, his perfect leader. For  he yearned, as the Qalandar dervishes would say, to discover that \"priest  of the Magi,\" or spiritual guide.    Far and wide, he carried on his search. He would speak to everyone he met.  But what he longed for was the sweet scent of the love of God, and this he  was unable to detect in anyone, whether Gnostic or philosopher, or member  of the _Sh_ay_kh_i sect. All he could see in the dervishes was their  tufted beards, and their palms-up religion of beggary. They were  \"dervish\"--poor in all save God--in name only; all they cared about, it  seemed to him, was whatever came to hand. Nor did he find illumination  among the Illuminati; he heard nothing from them but idle argument. He  observed that their grandiloquence was not eloquence and that their  subtleties were but windy figures of speech. Truth was not there; the core  of inner meaning was absent. For true philosophy is that which produces  rewards of excellence, and among these learned men there was no such fruit  to be found; at the peak of their accomplishment, they became the slaves  of vice, led an unconcerned life and were given over to personal  characteristics that were deserving of blame. To him, of all that  constitutes the high, distinguishing quality of humankind, they were  devoid.    As for the _Sh_ay_kh_i group, their essence was gone, only the dregs  remained; the kernel of them had vanished, leaving the shell behind; most  of their dialectics was lumber and superfluities by now.    Thus at the very moment when he heard the call from the Kingdom of God, he  shouted, \"Yea, verily!\" and he was off like the desert wind. He traveled  over vast distances, arrived at the Most Great Prison and attained the  presence of Baha'u'llah. When his eyes fell upon that bright Countenance  he was instantly enslaved. He returned to Persia so that he could meet  with those people who professed to be following the Path, those friends of  other days who were seeking out the Truth, and deal with them as his  loyalty and duty required.    Both going and returning, the Haji betook himself to each one of his  friends, foregathered with them, and let each one hear the new song from  Heaven. He reached his homeland and set his family's affairs in order,  providing for all, seeing to the security, happiness and comfort of each  one. After that he bade them all goodby. To his relatives, his wife,  children, kin, he said: \"Do not look for me again; do not wait for my  return.\"    He took up a staff and wandered away; over the mountains he went, across  the plains, seeking and finding the mystics, his friends. On his first  journey, he went to the late Mirza Yusuf _Kh_an (Mustawfiyu'l-Mamalik), in  Tihran. When he had said his say, Yusuf _Kh_an expressed a wish, and  declared that should it be fulfilled, he would believe; the wish was to be  given a son. Should such a bounty become his, Yusuf _Kh_an would be won  over. The Haji reported this to Baha'u'llah, and received a firm promise  in reply. Accordingly, when the Haji met with Yusuf _Kh_an on his second  journey, he found him with a child in his arms. \"Mirza,\" the Haji cried,  \"praise be to God! Your test has demonstrated the Truth. You snared your  bird of joy.\" \"Yes,\" answered Yusuf _Kh_an, \"the proof is clear. I am  convinced. This year, when you go to Baha'u'llah, say that I implore His  grace and favor for this child, so that it may be kept safe in the  sheltering care of God.\"    Haji Muhammad then went to the blissful future martyr, the King of  Martyrs, and asked him to intercede, so that he, the Haji, might be  allowed to keep watch at the doorway of Baha'u'llah. The King of Martyrs  sent in this request by letter, after which Haji _Kh_an duly arrived at  the Most Great Prison and made his home in the neighborhood of his loving  Friend. He enjoyed this honor for a long time, and later, in the Mazra'ih  garden as well, he was very frequently in Baha'u'llah's presence. After  the Beloved had ascended, Haji _Kh_an remained faithful to the Covenant  and Testament, shunning the hypocrites. At last, when this servant was  absent on the journeys to Europe and America, the Haji made his way to the  travelers' hospice at the Haziratu'l-Quds; and here, beside the Shrine of  the Bab, he took his flight to the world above.    May God refresh his spirit with the musk-scented air of the Abha Paradise,  and the sweet savors of holiness that blow from the highest Heaven. Unto  him be greetings and praise. His bright tomb is in Haifa.            AQA MUHAMMAD-IBRAHIM AMIR      Muhammad-Ibrahim Amir came from Nayriz. He was a blessed person; he was  like a cup filled with the red wine of faith. At the time when he was  first made captive by the tender Loved One, he was in the flower of his  youth. Then he fell a prey to the oppressors, and following the upheaval  in Nayriz and all the suffering, his persecutors laid hold of him. Three  farra_sh_es pinned his arms and tied his hands behind him; but the Amir by  main strength burst his bonds, snatched a dagger from a farra_sh_'s belt,  saved himself and ran away to 'Iraq. There he engaged in writing down the  sacred verses and later won the honor of serving at the Holy Threshold.  Constant and steadfast, he remained on duty day and night. During the  journey from Ba_gh_dad to Constantinople, from there to Adrianople, and  from there to the Most Great Prison, he was always at hand to serve. He  married the handmaid of God, Habibih, who also served at the Threshold,  and his daughter Badi'ih became the helpmeet of the late Husayn-Aqa  Qahvih-_ch_i.    Thus the Amir was steadfast in service throughout his life; but after the  ascension of Baha'u'llah his health steadily declined, and at last he left  this world of dust behind him and hastened away to the unsullied world  above. May God illumine the place where he rests with rays from the  all-highest Realm. Unto him be salutations and praise. His bright shrine  is in Akka.            MIRZA MIHDIY-I-KASHANI      This honored man, Mirza Mihdi, was from Ka_sh_an. In early youth, under  his father's tutelage, he had studied sciences and arts, and had become  skilled in composing both prose and verse, as well as in producing  calligraphy in the style known as _sh_ikastih.(54) He was singled out from  his fellows, head and shoulders above the rest. When still a child, he  learned of the Lord's Advent, caught fire with love, and became one of  those who \"gave their all to purchase Joseph.\" He was chief of the  yearning seekers, lord of lovers; eloquently, he began to teach the Faith,  and to prove the validity of the Manifestation.    He made converts; and because he yearned after God, he became a  laughingstock in Ka_sh_an, disparaged by friend and stranger alike,  exposed to the taunts of his faithless companions. One of them said: \"He  has lost his mind.\" And another: \"He is a public disgrace. Fortune has  turned against him. He is done for.\" The bullies mocked him, and spared  him nothing. When life became untenable, and open war broke out, he left  his homeland and journeyed to 'Iraq, the focal center of the new Light,  where he gained the presence of all mankind's Beloved.    He spent some time here, in the friends' company, composing verses that  sang the praises of Baha'u'llah. Later he was given leave to return home,  and went back to live for a while in Ka_sh_an. But again, he was plagued  by yearning love, and could bear the separation no more. He returned,  therefore, to Ba_gh_dad, bringing with him his respected sister, the third  consort(55) .    Here he remained, under the bountiful protection of Baha'u'llah, until the  convoy left 'Iraq for Constantinople, at which time Mirza Mihdi was  directed to remain behind and guard the Holy House. Restless, consumed  with longing, he stayed on. When the friends were banished from Ba_gh_dad  to Mosul, he was among the prisoners, a victim along with the others. With  the greatest hardship, he got to Mosul, and here fresh calamities awaited  him; he was ill almost all the time, he was an outcast, and destitute.  Still he endured it for a considerable period, was patient, retained his  dignity, and continually offered thanks. Finally he could bear the absence  of Baha'u'llah no longer. He sought permission, was granted leave to come,  and set out for the Most Great Prison.    Because the way was long and hard, and he suffered cruelly on the journey,  when he finally reached the"]]]
