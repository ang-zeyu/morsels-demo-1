He did.    \"He jumped in, and the little buggy swung from side to side, precisely  as a swing does when you jump on the board and try to steady it by the  ropes. I looked at him, at the scale--that's it; it's exactly like a  pair of scales, with one scale--at the deep depths below us, and at  myself. I imagined the ticklish thrill which would permeate my body  when we started. I fancied the glories of the prospective perspective  before me.    \"'Come, hurry up, please,' interrupted Farrington, and with  resignation I hurried down. He stood up. I crouched down. Perhaps you  think you'd have stood up as he did. You're mistaken. I crouched down  and held on tight. Make no mistake. I held on tight and waited for my  thrill. It didn't come. Then I stood up, and Farrington gave the word  'Go.' 'Wouldn't you better take a rope along?' said one of the men.  'Yes, I think I would.' What did he want of a rope? He feared I would  be nervous. He meant to grapple me in the middle of the river, and tie  me in. I knew it. I felt it. But I didn't say a word.    \"With a gentle jerk we started--slow, slow, very slow. Farrington  stood in front and watched the wire. I stood behind and watched  myself. I felt nothing. I was'n't exhilarated. I was'n't scared. I  was'n't even timid. I can't look from the top of a house without  desiring to jump off, but I looked down from the buggy and hadn't the  least desire to jump. Farrington says: 'It's because it's so high up.'  Well, we went on without any special sensation till the buggy struck  against a stay rope which reaches from one of the cables to the tower.  In the effort to free the buggy, Mr. Farrington gave a push which  swung us out some little distance and back again, at which a little  piece of indigestion seemed to be monarch of my interior, and for a  moment I was on the verge of a sensation. Having passed the middle,  the ascent was more labored. I waved my handkerchief to the people on  the ferryboats. I looked out toward the sea. I looked up at the  heavens. I even looked toward Harlem, but, like the buyer in the  Bible, I said: 'It is naught, it is naught.'    \"In about eight minutes we touched the New York side--all but ten  feet. The red flag waved for the engine to stop. There we hung in  mid-air 275 feet above the level, swinging to and fro like a drunken  buggy, at an angle of forty degrees, and quite uneasy. The rope which  was to haul us on was fastened to the iron--blest be the tie that  binds--and with a few hearty pulls we were brought so near the New  York tower that without difficulty we clambered up. I had made the  trip, but I had not felt a feel. From the top of the New York tower I  saw much, but the chief point of interest was the innumerable jets of  steam which flourish in the air, and fantastically curl off into  space.    \"Again the steeples, the tower, and the long, narrow, dirty river  filled the prospect, and the bright sun of a charming day lightened up  the western sky That was all, except to say 'thanks and good-bye,' and  descend the stairs. There were 417 of them stairs, and before I  reached the bottom I was dizzy, faint, seasick, and filled with a  decoction of tickle, so that I had to shut my eyes and rest from my  labors.    \"Thus ends the trip which filled my anticipatory imagination as the  waters fill the sea, but which resolved itself in realization to a  simple, childlike faith in the fixtures on the wire, and in the skill  and competence of the man who guided them. MONSIEUR X.\"           *       *       *       *       *          BLUE GLASS SCIENCE.      There is nothing more reassuring in these days, when new \"isms\" of the  scientists are slowly sapping the foundations of cherished beliefs,  than to remember that, after all, the much vaunted dicta of Nature are  yet opposable by the sound operations of honest common sense. See for  example how one of our evening dailies, tossing the dogmas of  so-called science contemptuously aside, evolves such profoundly  original thoughts as these, to explain the lucid blue glass theory of  General Pleasonton: \"The blue glass presents an obstruction to the  sun's rays which can only be penetrated by one of the seven primary  rays--the blue ray; the remaining six rays, travelling with the  velocity of 186,000 miles a second, falling upon the blue glass, are  suddenly arrested; the impact evolves upon the surface of the glass  friction, heat, electricity and magnetism; the heat expands the  molecules of the glass, and a current of electricity and magnetism  passes through it into the room; this current, falling upon animal or  vegetable life within, stimulates it to unusual vigor. Certainly the  results achieved, and abundantly certified to, are marvellous, and  sufficient to provoke further experiments and inquiry.\" Prior to these  splendid original discoveries of our contemporary, we ignorantly  believed that blue glass only partially sifted out the orange and  yellow rays from the spectrum, and that with this exception, it acted  merely as a screen to diminish the intensity of all the rays. We also  supposed that there was a sharp distinction to be drawn between  sunlight after passing through blue glass and the blue spectral ray:  that in one case all the colored rays were more or less present, and  that in the other but one was. But think of the utter dismay of such  pretenders as Helmholtz, Tyndall, and Henry when they learn that the  undulatory theory of light with which they have so long taxed our  credulity is overthrown--that of the seven primary rays, six bounce  off from blue glass and distribute themselves over the adjoining  neighborhood. That the glass is heated by the impact; and as the sun  persistently emits more rays, there are more impacts and more heat.  The glass gets hotter and hotter; but--mark the scientific acumen  here--just as we are wondering whether it will reach the melting  point, the pores open. It is the Turkish bath of Nature. Electricity  and magnetism, no longer shut out, rush in between the separate  molecules. Hand in hand, these great curative powers seek a proper  subject. They meet (we learn from a report, also in our contemporary,  of Pleasonton's latest triumph) a pig or a young lady whose hair has  come out--a heifer, a rooster, or a rheumatic child. Forthwith the pig  fattens, hair equal to that produced by the finest _tricopherus_  pervades the female scalp, and \"unusual vigor\" and general happiness  prevail. Such is the boon which Pleasonton bestows on humanity, as  elucidated by the original genius of our contemporary.           *       *       *       *       *          INFECTIOUS DISEASE PROPAGATION.      In view of the alarming prevalence of scarlet fever in many parts of  the country, the following hints by the _British Medical Journal_ are  wholesome warnings: \"There are three common ways by means of which  infectious diseases may be very widely spread. It is a very usual  practice for parents to take children suffering from scarlet fever,  measles, etc., to a public dispensary, in order to obtain advice and  medicines. It is little less than crime to expose, in the streets of a  town and in the crowded waiting room of a dispensary, children  afflicted with such complaints. Again, persons who are recovering from  infectious disorders borrow books out of the lending departments of  public libraries; these books, on their reissue to fresh borrowers,  are sources of very great danger. In all libraries, notices should be  posted up informing borrowers that no books will be lent out to  persons who are suffering from diseases of an infectious character;  and that any person so suffering will be prosecuted if he borrow  during the time of his illness. Lastly, disease is spread by tract  distributors. It is the habit for such well meaning people to call at  a house where a person is ill and to leave him a tract. In a week or  so the tract is called for again, another left in its place, and the  old one is left with another person. It needs not much imagination to  know with what result to health such a practice will lead if the first  person be in scarlet fever or smallpox.\"    Dr. Hutton offers \"a warning on the reckless manner in which parents  allow their healthy children to run into the houses of acquaintances  who have members of their families suffering from scarlatina, etc.,  and states that he has seen the infection thus carried from the  patient, and several families attacked.\"           *       *       *       *       *          TOUGHENED GLASS MAKING IN BROOKLYN.      A _World_ reporter has lately visited the works in Brooklyn where the  manufacture of the La Bastie toughened glass is now in active  progress. The manufacturer states that, in June last, his factory was  destroyed by fire, and the introduction of the glass into our markets  has for that reason been delayed. Only one kind of goods, lamp  chimneys, are now made, and the process is as follows: A workman,  having in his hand a pole about eight feet long, with a knob on the  end of the size of a lamp burner, fits a chimney on the knob and  plunges it into the flame of a furnace. He with-draws it twice or  thrice that it may not heat too quickly, turning the pole rapidly the  while, and when the glass reaches a red heat quickly shoots it into  one of a dozen small baths fixed on a revolving table, and seizes  another chimney. A boy keeps the revolving table always in position,  and as the chimneys come around to him, having been the proper time in  the bath, he takes them out to be dried, sorted, cleaned, and packed.  The bath has to be of just the right temperature, as, if it be too hot  or too cold, the chimneys are liable to explode. In either case the  process of annealing is imperfect. By working the tables at a certain  rate, the baths are kept at the right temperature by the immersion of  the red hot glass. Oil or tallow is used in the bath.

At the centre of each pier rise three shafts to the point at which the  ribs of the vaulting spring: a large shaft in the middle, with a smaller  one on each side of it. There are small carved figures at the point at  which the smaller of these shafts touch the moulding of the arches. The  capitals of these shafts, though small, are of a very delicate design. A  few inches above the top of the main arch is a horizontal string course  or moulding dividing each bay into two storeys. As has been said, the  triforium is merely a prolongation of the lights of the clerestory  window. These lights are five in number. The division between clerestory  and triforium is marked by a band of stone ornamented with quatrefoils.  Below this is a cusped arch in each light of the triforium with a  crocketed gable ending in a finial above it. The centre lights of the  triforium in each bay originally contained figures, said to have been  the patron saints of European nations. Of these there only remains a  figure in the fourth bay from the west on the south side. Near the  triforium in the opposite bay to this there projects the head of a  dragon carved in wood, from which the covering of the font used to hang.  The clerestory windows are of uniform pattern of the style known as  geometrical Decorated. This pattern is very fine in design. It consists  of five lights, the two outer of which are grouped in a single arch,  with a quatrefoil piercing in its head. Between these two arches and on  the top of the arch of the central light is a circle fitting into the  arch of the window, and ornamented with four quatrefoils, four trefoil  piercings, and other smaller lights. There are capitals to the outside  shafts of the windows, and to the main shafts of the two inner mullions.  All these mullions are very delicately moulded. A separate account will  be given of the glass in these windows and those of the aisles, together  with the rest of the glass in the minster. There is a curious moulding  running round the arches of the windows and springing from the capitals  of the vaulting shafts, which bends towards those arches to a point a  little way above the capitals from which they spring, and then runs  parallel and close to their mouldings. The vault is of wood covered with  plaster. The ribs are elaborate in design, but not very successful. The  fact that the vaulting is not of stone deprives the mouldings and bosses  of all sharpness and delicacy. From the capital of the vaulting shafts  and for about 91/2 feet above them these ribs are of stone: the  division between wood and stone is marked by a curious and heavy  moulding. The aisles of the nave are bolder in design and altogether  more satisfactory than the nave itself. Like the nave they are unusually  wide and lofty. In the two farthest bays to the west, above which are  the western towers, the rough wooden roof, which has never been covered  with a vault, may be seen. These bays are separated from the bays next  to them by strong arches with thick shafts and mouldings, which were  built for the support of the towers. The shafts supporting this arch on  the outer side are five in number. The shafts corresponding to them in  the other bays of the aisle, to which the ribs of the aisle vaults  converge, are only three. All these shafts have finely-carved capitals  of leafage. The vault of the aisles is of stone, with only structural  ribs, finely moulded and with carved bosses. The aisle windows are, like  those of the clerestory, of the geometrical Decorated style, but of an  earlier and simpler, uniform, design. They each contain three lights,  and there is no variation or subordination of mouldings in the mullions.  Unlike the clerestory windows, they are somewhat deeply recessed. The  mouldings of their arches are broad and bold, and are supported by five  shafts with capitals. Above the three lights of the windows are three  quatrefoils, pyramidally arranged. On each side of these windows, in the  space between the windows and the vaulting shafts, is plain stone  panelling terminating in an arch with a crocketed gable above it, ending  in a finial which reaches to about the level of the spring of the window  arch. On each side of this gable are grotesque carved figures. A small  pinnacle is rather strangely inserted on each side of the arch at the  point at which it springs. Below the windows there is a rich arcade,  with buttresses between the divisions ending in pinnacles. Each division  is filled with a geometrical pattern of two panels, each panel ending in  a trefoil, with a circular trefoil in the head of each division, and a  crocketed gable, terminating in a rich finial above it. All the  mouldings of this arcade are very delicate. In the north aisle, and in  the second bay from the west, is a doorway, which opened to a Chapel of  the Holy Sepulchre, now altogether destroyed. Above this doorway is a  gable ornamented with foliage and a statue of the Virgin, which has lost  its head, with statues of angels on either side of her, also much  mutilated.    [Illustration: The Nave--South Aisle.]    #The Interior Of The West End Of The Nave# contains the famous window  with tracery of the curvilinear or flowing Decorated style, and of a  design only surpassed by the east window of Carlisle Cathedral. The  glass in this window was given by Archbishop Melton, and is almost the  finest in the cathedral. The tracery has been entirely and very  carefully restored. The window contains eight lights. These lights are  coupled in pairs by four arches with a quatrefoil in the head of each,  and again formed in groups of four by an ogee arch above the other  arches. The flowing curves of these ogee arches are most ingeniously and  beautifully worked into the pattern of the upper part of the window,  which contains five main divisions of stonework, each like the skeleton  of a leaf in shape and in the delicacy of its pattern. Of these five  divisions the top one is made by splitting up the central mullion; two  diverge from it at the top of the lower lights; and two others curve  inwards from the outside arch. The central mullion runs up almost to the  top of the arch. The mullions are alike in moulding and size. Below the  window is the west door, the head of which is filled with ancient  stained glass. There is a gable above it, running up to the bottom of  the window and containing three niches. There are kneeling figures on  each side of the gable, so that the top of it may have held a figure of  Christ. All that portion of the west end not occupied by the window and  the porch is filled with storeys of niches and arcading. The lowest  storey consists of a rich arcading, each division of which is ornamented  with geometrical tracery closely resembling that of the arcading of the  aisles. These divisions are marked by pinnacles. Above this is another  row of arcading of much the same character, except that it is about half  as high again as the lower storey. Each division of this arcading  contains two niches for statues, and above the niches are gables. Above  the gables the divisions are filled with tracery closely resembling that  of the lower arcade. This second arcade reaches to the bottom of the  great window, which is marked by a string course running across the  whole part. On each side of the gable of the porch is an extra niche  rather clumsily fitted in. Above the string course the arcading is not  so rich as below. The third storey consists of long niches ornamented  merely with arches, gables, and pinnacles between each niche. The fourth  is of much the same character, but that the divisions are shorter and  have no gable above them. The last storey consists of plain panelling  ornamented at intervals by gables. The west windows of the aisle are  shorter than the other aisle windows, but have tracery of the same  character. The aisle doorways are plain, but over both are some  sculptured figures. Those over the north door appear to represent a  hunt. In the middle a woman is setting a dog on to two beasts, and  behind them there is a man blowing a horn. At the sides are two  quatrefoils, set in which are figures (1) of a man attacking another man  drinking, and (2) one man driving another away. The sculpture over the  south door was destroyed in the fire of 1840, but a careful restoration  of it has been made. It consists of a man in the middle fighting with a  dragon, with sword and shield, and at the sides in the quatrefoils (1)  Delilah cutting the hair of Samson, and Samson and the lion; (2) a man  and woman fighting. The ends of the aisles are also ornamented with  arcading in three storeys, the lowest of which is like the lowest storey  of the arcading at the west end of the nave; the second a smaller series  of niches ornamented with gables and pinnacles; and the third a single  arcade on each side of the window, filled with geometrical tracery and"]]]
