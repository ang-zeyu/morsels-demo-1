In the first of these offices it gives precision and charm  to truth; in the second it gives precision and charm to service. For,  the moment we make anything useful thoroughly, it is a law of nature  that we shall be pleased with ourselves, and with the thing we have  made; and become desirous therefore to adorn or complete it, in some  dainty way, with finer art expressive of our pleasure.    And the point I wish chiefly to bring before you to-day is this close  and healthy connection of the fine arts with material use; but I must  first try briefly to put in clear light the function of art in giving  Form to truth.      98. Much that I have hitherto tried to teach has been disputed on the  ground that I have attached too much importance to art as representing  natural facts, and too little to it as a source of pleasure. And I wish,  in the close of these four prefatory lectures, strongly to assert to  you, and, so far as I can in the time, convince you, that the entire  vitality of art depends upon its being either full of truth, or full of  use; and that, however pleasant, wonderful or impressive it may be in  itself, it must yet be of inferior kind, and tend to deeper  inferiority, unless it has clearly one of these main objects,--either  _to state a true thing_, or to _adorn a serviceable one_. It must never  exist alone--never for itself; it exists rightly only when it is the  means of knowledge, or the grace of agency for life.      99. Now, I pray you to observe--for though I have said this often  before, I have never yet said it clearly enough--every good piece of  art, to whichever of these ends it may be directed, involves first  essentially the evidence of human skill and the formation of an actually  beautiful thing by it.    Skill, and beauty, always then; and, beyond these, the formative arts  have always one or other of the two objects which I have just defined to  you--truth, or serviceableness; and without these aims neither the skill  nor their beauty will avail; only by these can either legitimately  reign. All the graphic arts begin in keeping the outline of shadow that  we have loved, and they end in giving to it the aspect of life; and all  the architectural arts begin in the shaping of the cup and the platter,  and they end in a glorified roof.    Therefore, you see, in the graphic arts you have Skill, Beauty, and  Likeness; and in the architectural arts, Skill, Beauty, and Use; and you  _must_ have the three in each group, balanced and co-ordinate; and all  the chief errors of art consist in losing or exaggerating one of these  elements.      100. For instance, almost the whole system and hope of modern life are  founded on the notion that you may substitute mechanism for skill,  photograph for picture, cast-iron for sculpture. That is your main  nineteenth-century faith, or infidelity. You think you can get  everything by grinding--music, literature, and painting. You will find  it grievously not so; you can get nothing but dust by mere grinding.  Even to have the barley-meal out of it, you must have the barley first;  and that comes by growth, not grinding. But essentially, we have lost  our delight in Skill; in that majesty of it which I was trying to make  clear to you in my last address, and which long ago I tried to express,  under the head of ideas of power. The entire sense of that, we have  lost, because we ourselves do not take pains enough to do right, and  have no conception of what the right costs; so that all the joy and  reverence we ought to feel in looking at a strong man's work have ceased  in us. We keep them yet a little in looking at a honeycomb or a  bird's-nest; we understand that these differ, by divinity of skill, from  a lump of wax or a cluster of sticks. But a picture, which is a much  more wonderful thing than a honeycomb or a bird's-nest,--have we not  known people, and sensible people too, who expected to be taught to  produce that, in six lessons?      101. Well, you must have the skill, you must have the beauty, which is  the highest moral element; and then, lastly, you must have the verity or  utility, which is not the moral, but the vital element; and this desire  for verity and use is the one aim of the three that always leads in  great schools, and in the minds of great masters, without any exception.  They will permit themselves in awkwardness, they will permit themselves  in ugliness; but they will never permit themselves in uselessness or in  unveracity.      102. And farther, as their skill increases, and as their grace, so much  more, their desire for truth. It is impossible to find the three motives  in fairer balance and harmony than in our own Reynolds. He rejoices in  showing you his skill; and those of you who succeed in learning what  painter's work really is, will one day rejoice also, even to  laughter--that highest laughter which springs of pure delight, in  watching the fortitude and the fire of a hand which strikes forth its  will upon the canvas as easily as the wind strikes it on the sea. He  rejoices in all abstract beauty and rhythm and melody of design; he will  never give you a colour that is not lovely, nor a shade that is  unnecessary, nor a line that is ungraceful. But all his power and all  his invention are held by him subordinate,--and the more obediently  because of their nobleness,--to his true leading purpose of setting  before you such likeness of the living presence of an English gentleman  or an English lady, as shall be worthy of being looked upon for ever.      103. But farther, you remember, I hope--for I said it in a way that I  thought would shock you a little, that you might remember it--my  statement, that art had never done more than this, never more than given  the likeness of a noble human being. Not only so, but it very seldom  does so much as this; and the best pictures that exist of the great  schools are all portraits, or groups of portraits, often of very simple  and no wise noble persons. You may have much more brilliant and  impressive qualities in imaginative pictures; you may have figures  scattered like clouds, or garlanded like flowers; you may have light and  shade, as of a tempest, and colour, as of the rainbow; but all that is  child's play to the great men, though it is astonishment to us. Their  real strength is tried to the utmost, and as far as I know, it is never  elsewhere brought out so thoroughly, as in painting one man or woman,  and the soul that was in them; nor that always the highest soul, but  often only a thwarted one that was capable of height; or perhaps not  even that, but faultful and poor, yet seen through, to the poor best of  it, by the masterful sight. So that in order to put before you in your  Standard series, the best art possible, I am obliged, even from the very  strongest men, to take portraits, before I take the idealism. Nay,  whatever is best in the great compositions themselves has depended on  portraiture; and the study necessary to enable you to understand  invention will also convince you that the mind of man never invented a  greater thing than the form of man, animated by faithful life. Every  attempt to refine or exalt such healthy humanity has weakened or  caricatured it; or else consists only in giving it, to please our fancy,  the wings of birds, or the eyes of antelopes. Whatever is truly great in  either Greek or Christian art, is also restrictedly human; and even the  raptures of the redeemed souls who enter, \"celestemente ballando,\" the  gate of Angelico's Paradise, were seen first in the terrestrial, yet  most pure, mirth of Florentine maidens.      104. I am aware that this cannot but at present appear gravely  questionable to those of my audience who are strictly cognisant of the  phases of Greek art; for they know that the moment of its decline is  accurately marked, by its turning from abstract form to portraiture. But  the reason of this is simple. The progressive course of Greek art was in  subduing monstrous conceptions to natural ones; it did this by general  laws; it reached absolute truth of generic human form, and if this  ethical force had remained, would have advanced into healthy  portraiture. But at the moment of change the national life ended in  Greece; and portraiture, there, meant insult to her religion, and  flattery to her tyrants. And her skill perished, not because she became  true in sight, but because she became vile at heart.      105. And now let us think of our own work, and ask how that may become,  in its own poor measure, active in some verity of representation. We  certainly cannot begin by drawing kings or queens; but we must try, even  in our earliest work, if it is to prosper, to draw something that will  convey true knowledge both to ourselves and others. And I think you will  find greatest advantage in the endeavour to give more life and  educational power to the simpler branches of natural science: for the  great scientific men are all so eager in advance that they have no time  to popularise their discoveries, and if we can glean after them a  little, and make pictures of the things which science describes, we  shall find the service a worthy one. Not only so, but we may even be  helpful to science herself; for she has suffered by her proud severance  from the arts; and having made too little effort to realise her  discoveries to vulgar eyes, has herself lost true measure of what was  chiefly precious in them.      106. Take Botany, for instance. Our scientific botanists are, I think,  chiefly at present occupied in distinguishing species, which perfect  methods of distinction will probably in the future show to be  indistinct;--in inventing descriptive names of which a more advanced  science and more fastidious scholarship will show some to be  unnecessary, and others inadmissible;--and in microscopic investigations  of structure, which through"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19166"],[0,"The Quirt (#15)"],[1,"of ranching in the Sawtooth country might be classed as  extra hazardous, and for saying that it took nerve just to hang on.    That is why Al rode oblivious to his surroundings, meditating no doubt  upon the best means of preserving the \"integrity\" of the Sawtooth and at  the same time soothing effectively the ticklishness of the situation of  which he had complained. It was his business to find the best means. It  was for just such work that the Sawtooth paid him--secretly, to be  sure--better wages than the foreman, Hawkins, received. Al was  conscientious and did his best to earn his wages; not because he  particularly loved killing and spying as a sport, but because the  Sawtooth had bought his loyalty for a price, and so long as he felt that  he was getting a square deal from them, he would turn his hand against  any man that stood in their way. He was a Sawtooth man, and he fought  the enemies of the Sawtooth as matter-of-factly as a soldier will fight  for his country. To his unimaginative mind there was sufficient  justification in that attitude. As for the ease with which he planned to  kill and cover his killing under the semblance of accident, he would  have said, if you could make him speak of it, that he was not squeamish.  They'd all have to die some day, anyway.          CHAPTER TEN    ANOTHER SAWTOOTH \"ACCIDENT\"      Frank Johnson rose from the breakfast table, shaved a splinter off the  edge of the water bench for a toothpick and sharpened it carefully while  he looked at Brit.    \"You goin' after them posts, or shall I?\" he inquired glumly, which, by  the way, was his normal tone. \"Jim and Sorry oughta git the post holes  all dug to-day. One of us better take a look through that young stock in  the lower field, too, and see if there's any more sign uh blackleg.  Which you ruther do?\"    Brit tilted his chair backward so that he could reach the coffeepot on  the stove hearth. \"I'll haul down the posts,\" he decided carelessly.  \"They're easy loaded, and I guess my back's as good as yourn.\"    \"All you got to do is skid 'em down off'n the bank onto the wagon,\"  Frank said. \"I wisht you'd go on up where we cut them last ones and git  my sweater, Brit. I musta left it hanging on a bush right close to where  I was workin'.\"    Brit's grunt signified assent, and Frank went out. Jim and Sorry, the  two unpicturesque cowboys of whom Lorraine had complained to the cat had  already departed with pick and shovel to their unromantic task of  digging post holes. Each carried a most unattractive lunch tied in a  flour sack behind the cantle of his saddle. Lorraine had done her  conscientious best, but with lumpy, sour-dough bread, cold bacon and  currant jelly of that kind which is packed in wooden kegs, one can't do  much with a cold lunch. Lorraine wondered how much worse it would look  after it had been tied on the saddle for half a day; wondered too what  those two silent ones got out of life,--what they looked forward to,  what was their final goal. For that matter she frequently wondered what  there was in life for any of them, shut into that deadly monotony of  sagebrush and rocks interspersed with little, grassy meadows where the  cattle fed listlessly.    Even the sinister undercurrent of antagonism against the Quirt could not  whip her emotions feeling that she was doing anything more than live  the restricted, sordid little life of a poorly equipped ranch. She had  ridden once with Frank Johnson to look through a bunch of cattle, but it  had been nothing more than a hot, thirsty, dull ride, with a wind that  blew her hat off in spite of pins and tied veil, and with a companion  who spoke only when he was spoken to and then as briefly as possible.    Her father would not talk again as he had talked that night. She had  tried to make him tell her more about the Sawtooth and had gotten  nothing out of him. The man from Whisper, whom Brit had spoken of as Al,  had not returned. Nor had the promised saddle horse materialized. The  boys were too busy to run in any horses, her father had told her shortly  when she reminded him of his promise. When the fence was done, maybe he  could rustle her another horse,--and then he had added that he didn't  see what ailed Yellowjacket, for all the riding she was likely to do.    \"Straight hard work and minding your own business,\" her father had said,  and it seemed to Lorraine after three or four days of it that he had  summed up the life of a cattleman's daughter in a masterly manner which  ought to be recorded among Famous Sayings like \"War is hell\" and \"Don't  give up the ship.\"    On this particular morning Lorraine's spirits were at their lowest ebb.  If it were not for the new stepfather, she would return to the Casa  Grande, she told herself disgustedly. And if it were not for the belief  among all her acquaintances that she was queening it over the  cattle-king's vast domain, she would return and find work again in  motion pictures. But she could not bring herself to the point of facing  the curiosity and the petty gossip of the studios. She would be expected  to explain satisfactorily why she had left the real West for the mimic  West of Hollywood. She did not acknowledge to herself that she also  could not face the admission of failure to carry out what she had begun.    She had told her dad that she wanted to fight with him, even though  \"fighting\" in this case meant washing the coarse clothing of her father  and Frank, scrubbing the rough, warped boards of the cabin floor, and  frying ranch-cured bacon for every meal, and in making butter to sell,  and counting the eggs every night and being careful to use only the  cracked ones for cooking.    She hated every detail of this crude housekeeping, from the chipped  enamel dishpan to the broom that was all one-sided, and the pillow slips  which were nothing more nor less than sugar sacks. She hated it even  more than she had hated the Casa Grande and her mother's frowsy  mentality. But because she could see that she made life a little more  comfortable for her dad, because she felt that he needed her, she would  stay and assure herself over and over that she was staying merely  because she was too proud to go back to the old life and own the West a  failure.    She was sweeping the doorstep with the one-sided broom when Brit drove  out through the gate and up the trail which she knew led eventually to  Sugar Spring. The horses, sleek in their new hair and skittish with the  change from hay to new grass, danced over the rough ground so that the  running gear of the wagon, with its looped log-chain, which would later  do duty as a brake on the long grade down from timber line on the side  of Spirit Canyon, rattled and banged over the rocks with a clatter that  could be heard for half a mile. Lorraine looked after her father  enviously. If she were a boy she would be riding on that sack of hay  tied to the \"hounds\" for a seat. But, being a girl, it had never  occurred to Brit that she might like to go,--might even be useful to  him on the trip.    \"I suppose if I told dad I could drive that team as well as he can, he'd  just look at me and think I was crazy,\" she thought resentfully and gave  the broom a spiteful fling toward a presumptuous hen that had approached  too closely. \"If I'd asked him to let me go along he'd have made some  excuse--oh, I'm beginning to know dad! He thinks a woman's place is in  the house--preferably the kitchen. And here I've thought all my life  that cowgirls did nothing but ride around and warn people about stage  holdups and everything! I'd just like to know how a girl would ever have  a chance to know what was going on in the country, unless she heard the  men talking while she poured their coffee. Only this bunch don't talk at  all. They just gobble and go.\"    She went in then and shut the door with a slam. Up on the ridge Al  Woodruff lowered his small binocular and eased away from the spot where  he had been crouching behind a bush. Every one on the Quirt ranch was  accounted for. As well as if he had sat at their breakfast table Al knew  where each man's work would take him that day. As for the girl, she was  safe at the ranch for the day, probably. If she did take a ride later  on, it would probably be up the ridge between the Quirt and Thurman's  ranch, and sit for an hour or so just looking. That ride was beginning  to be a habit of hers, Al had observed, so that he considered her  accounted for also.    He made his way along the side hill to where his horse was tied to a  bush, mounted and rode away with his mind pretty much at ease. Much more  at ease than it would have been had he read what was in Lorraine's mind  when, she slammed that door.    Up above Sugar Spring was timber. By applying to the nearest Forest  Supervisor a certain amount could be had for ranch improvements upon  paying a small sum for the \"stumpage.\" The Quirt had permission to cut  posts for their new fence which Al Woodruff had reported to his boss.    As he drove up the trail, which was in places barely passable for a  wagon, Brit was thinking of that fence. The Sawtooth would object to it,  he knew, since it cut off one of their stock trails and sent them around  through rougher country. Just what form their objection would take,  Brit did not know. Deep in his intrepid soul he hoped that the Sawtooth  would at last show its hand openly. He had liked Fred Thurman, and what  Lorraine had told him went much deeper than she knew. He wanted to bring  them into the open where he could fight with some show of winning.    \"I'll git Bill Warfield yet--and git him right,\" was the gist of his  musings. \"He's bound to show his head, give him time enough. Him and his  killers can't always keep under cover. Let 'em come at me about that  fence! It's on my land--the Quirt's got a right to fence every foot of  land that belongs to 'em.\"    All the way over the ridge and across the flat and up the"]]]
