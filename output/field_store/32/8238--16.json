Clara, at the uncanny tale, immediately exclaimed that she would not  stay alone another moment and that she wished her father to come home.  The housekeeper arranged to sleep with the frightened child, while  Heidi, who did not know what ghosts were, was perfectly unmoved.  Another letter was despatched to Mr. Sesemann, telling him that the  excitement might have serious effects on his daughter's delicate  constitution, and mentioning several misfortunes that might probably  happen if he did not relieve the household from this terror.    This brought Mr. Sesemann. Going to his daughter's room after his  arrival, he was overjoyed to see her as well as ever. Clara was also  delighted to see her father.    \"What new tricks has the ghost played on you, Miss Rottenmeier?\" asked  Mr. Sesemann with a twinkle in his eye.    \"It is no joke, Mr. Sesemann,\" replied the lady seriously. \"I am sure  you will not laugh tomorrow. Those strange events indicate that  something secret and horrible has happened in this house in days gone  by.\"    \"Is that so? this is new to me,\" remarked Mr. Sesemann. \"But will you  please not suspect my venerable ancestors? Please call Sebastian; I  want to speak to him alone.\"    Mr. Sesemann knew that the two were not on good terms, so he said to  the butler:    \"Come here, Sebastian, and tell me honestly, if you have played the  ghost for Miss Rottenmeier's pastime?\"    \"No, upon my word, master; you must not think that,\" replied Sebastian  frankly. \"I do not like it quite myself.\"    \"Well, I'll show you and John what ghosts look like by day. You ought  to be ashamed of yourselves, strong young men like you! Now go at once  to my old friend, Dr. Classen, and tell him to come to me at nine  o'clock to-night. Tell him that I came from Paris especially to  consult him, and that I want him to sit up all night with me. Do you  understand me, Sebastian?\"    \"Yes indeed! I shall do as you say, Mr. Sesemann.\" Mr. Sesemann then  went up to Clara's room to quiet and comfort her.    Punctually at nine o'clock the doctor arrived. Though his hair was  grey, his face was still fresh, and his eyes were lively and kind.  When he saw his friend, he laughed aloud and said: \"Well, well, you  look pretty healthy for one who needs to be watched all night.\"    \"Have patience, my old friend,\" replied Mr. Sesemann. \"I am afraid the  person we have to sit up for will look worse, but first we must catch  him.\"    \"What? Then somebody _is_ sick in this house? What do you mean?\"    \"Far worse, doctor, far worse. A ghost is in the house. My house is  haunted.\"    When the doctor laughed, Mr. Sesemann continued: \"I call that  sympathy; I wish my friend Miss Rottenmeier could hear you. She is  convinced that an old Sesemann is wandering about, expiating some  dreadful deed.\"    \"How did she make his acquaintance?\" asked the doctor, much amused.    Mr. Sesemann then explained the circumstances. He said that the matter  was either a bad joke which an acquaintance of the servants was  playing in his absence, or it was a gang of thieves, who, after  intimidating the people, would surely rob his house by and by.    With these explanations they entered the room where the two servants  had watched before. A few bottles of wine stood on the table and two  bright candelabra shed a brilliant light. Two revolvers were ready for  emergencies.    They left the door only partly open, for too much light might drive  the ghost away. Then, sitting down comfortably, the two men passed  their time by chatting, taking a sip now and then.    \"The ghost seems to have spied us and probably won't come to-day,\"  said the doctor.    \"We must have patience. It is supposed to come at one,\" replied his  friend.    So they talked till one o'clock. Everything was quiet, and not a sound  came from the street. Suddenly the doctor raised his finger.    \"Sh! Sesemann, don't you hear something?\"    While they both listened, the bar was unfastened, the key was turned,  and the door flew open. Mr. Sesemann seized his revolver.    \"You are not afraid, I hope?\" said the doctor, getting up.    \"Better be cautious!\" whispered Mr. Sesemann, seizing the candelabrum  in the other hand. The doctor followed with his revolver and the  light, and so they went out into the hall.    On the threshhold stood a motionless white form, lighted up by the  moon.    \"Who is there?\" thundered the doctor, approaching the figure. It  turned and uttered a low shriek. There stood Heidi, with bare feet and  in her white night-gown, looking bewildered at the bright light and  the weapons. She was shaking with fear, while the two men were looking  at her in amazement.    \"Sesemann, this seems to be your little water carrier,\" said the  doctor.    \"Child, what does this mean?\" asked Mr. Sesemann. \"What did you want  to do? Why have you come down here?\"    Pale from fright, Heidi said: \"I do not know.\"    The doctor came forward now. \"Sesemann, this case belongs to my field.  Please go and sit down while I take her to bed.\"    Putting his revolver aside, he led the trembling child up-stairs.    \"Don't be afraid; just be quiet! Everything is all right; don't be  frightened.\"    When they had arrived in Heidi's room, the doctor put the little girl  to bed, covering her up carefully. Drawing a chair near the couch, he  waited till Heidi had calmed down and had stopped trembling. Then  taking her hand in his, he said kindly: \"Now everything is all right  again. Tell me where you wanted to go?\"    \"I did not want to go anywhere,\" Heidi assured him; \"I did not go  myself, only I was there all of a sudden.\"    \"Really! Tell me, what did you dream?\"    \"Oh, I have the same dream every night. I always think I am with my  grandfather again and can hear the fir-trees roar. I always think how  beautiful the stars must be, and then I open the door of the hut, and  oh, it is so wonderful! But when I wake up I am always in Frankfurt.\"  Heidi had to fight the sobs that were rising in her throat.    \"Does your back or your head hurt you, child?\"    \"No, but I feel as if a big stone was pressing me here.\"    \"As if you had eaten something that disagreed with you?\"    \"Oh no, but as if I wanted to cry hard.\"    \"So, and then you cry out, don't you?\"    \"Oh no, I must never do that, for Miss Rottenmeier has forbidden it.\"    \"Then you swallow it down? Yes? Do you like to be here?\"    \"Oh yes,\" was the faint, uncertain reply.    \"Where did you live with your grandfather?\"    \"Up on the Alp.\"    \"But wasn't it a little lonely there?\"    \"Oh no, it was so beautiful!\"--But Heidi could say no more. The  recollection, the excitement of the night and all the restrained  sorrow overpowered the child. The tears rushed violently from her eyes  and she broke out into loud sobs.    The doctor rose, and soothing her, said: \"It won't hurt to cry; you'll  go to sleep afterward, and when you wake up everything will come  right.\" Then he left the room.    Joining his anxious friend down-stairs, he said: \"Sesemann, the little  girl is a sleep-walker, and has unconsciously scared your whole  household. Besides, she is so home-sick that her little body has  wasted away. We shall have to act quickly. The only remedy for her is  to be restored to her native mountain air. This is my prescription,  and she must go tomorrow.\"    \"What, sick, a sleep-walker, and wasted away in my house! Nobody even  suspected it! You think I should send this child back in this  condition, when she has come in good health? No, doctor, ask  everything but that. Take her in hand and prescribe for her, but let  her get well before I send her back.\"    \"Sesemann,\" the doctor replied seriously, \"just think what you are  doing. We cannot cure her with powders and pills. The child has not a  strong constitution, and if you keep her here, she might never get  well again. If you restore her to the bracing mountain air to which  she is accustomed, she probably will get perfectly well again.\"    When Mr. Sesemann heard this he said, \"If that is your advice, we must  act at once; this is the only way then.\" With these words Mr. Sesemann  took his friend's arm and walked about with him to talk the matter  over. When everything was settled, the doctor took his leave, for the  morning had already come and the sun was shining in through the door.          XIII    UP THE ALP ON A SUMMER EVENING      Mr. Sesemann, going upstairs in great agitation, knocked at the  housekeeper's door. He asked her to hurry, for preparations for a  journey had to be made. Miss Rottenmeier obeyed the summons with the  greatest indignation, for it was only half-past four in the morning.  She dressed in haste, though with great difficulty, being nervous and  excited. All the other servants were summoned likewise, and one and  all thought that the master of the house had been seized by the ghost  and that he was ringing for help. When they had all come down with  terrified looks, they were most surprised to see Mr. Sesemann fresh  and cheerful, giving orders. John was sent to get the horses ready and  Tinette was told to prepare Heidi for her departure while Sebastian  was commissioned to fetch Heidi's aunt. Mr. Sesemann instructed the  housekeeper to pack a trunk in all haste for Heidi.    Miss Rottenmeier experienced an extreme disappointment, for she had  hoped for an explanation of the great mystery. But Mr. Sesemann,  evidently not in the mood to converse further, went to his daughter's  room. Clara had been wakened by the unusual noises and was listening  eagerly. Her father told her of what had happened and how the doctor  had ordered Heidi back to her home, because her condition was serious  and might get worse. She might even climb the roof, or be exposed to  similar dangers, if she was not cured at once.    Clara was painfully surprised and tried to prevent her father from  carrying out his plan."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20785"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#15)"],[1,"cloth he use for  everybody's clothes. He can do that 'cause he had lots of money. He  was big rich, and he keep a whole lot of hard money in the house all  the time, but none of the slaves know it but me. Sometimes I would  have the baby in the Mistress' room and she would go git three or four  big wood boxes full of hard money for us to play with. I would make  fences out of the money all across the floor, to keep the baby  satisfied, and when he go to sleep I would put the money back in the  boxes. I never did know how much they is, but a whole lot.    Even after the War start old Doctor have that money, and he would  exchange money for people. Sometimes he would go out and be gone a  long time, and come back with a lot more money he got from somewhar.    Right at the first they made him a high officer in the War and he done  doctoring somewhar at a hospital most of the time. But he could go on  both sides of the War, and sometime he would come in at night and  bring old Mistress pretty little things, and I heard him tell her he  got them in the North.    One day I was fanning him and I asked him is he been to the North and  he kick out at me and tell to shut up my black mouth, and it nearly  scared me to death the way he look at me! Nearly every time he been  gone and come in and tell Mistress he been in the North he have a lot  more hard money to put away in them boxes, too!    One evening long come a man and eat supper at the house and stay all  night. He was a nice mannered man, and I like to wait on him. The next  morning I hear him ask old Doctor what is my name, and old Doctor  start in to try to sell me to that man. The man say he can't buy me  'cause old Doctor say he want a thousand dollars, and then old Doctor  say he will bind me out to him.    I run away from the house and went out to the cabin whar my mammy and  pappy was, but they tell me to go on back to the Big House 'cause  maybe I am just scared. But about that time old Doctor and the man  come and old Doctor make me go with the man. We go in his buggy a long  ways off to the South, and after he stop two or three night at peoples  houses and put me out to stay with the niggers he come to his own  house. I ask him how far it is back home and he say about a hundred  miles or more, and laugh, and ask me if I know how far that is.    I wants to know if I can go back to my mammy some time, and he say  \"Sho', of course you can, some of these times. You don't belong to me,  Jo, I'se jest your boss and not your master.\"    He live in a big old rottendy house, but he aint farming none of the  land. Jest as soon as he git home he go off again, and sometimes he  only come in at night for a little while.    His wife's name was Kate and his name was Mr. John. I was there about  a week before I found out they name was Deeson. They had two children,  a girl about my size name Joanna like me, and a little baby boy name  Johnny. One day Mistress Kate tell me I the only nigger they got. I  been thinking maybe they had some somewhar on a plantation, but she  say they aint got no plantation and they aint been at that place very  long either.    That little girl Joanna and me kind of take up together, and she was a  mighty nice mannered little girl, too. Her mammy raised her good. Her  mammy was mighty sickly all the time, and that's the reason they bind  me to do the work.    Mr. John was in some kind of business in the War too, but I never see  him with no soldier clothes on but one time. One night he come in with  them on, but the next morning he come to breakfast in jest his plain  clothes again. Then he go off again.    I sho' had a hard row at that house. It was old and rackady, and I had  to scrub off the staircase and the floors all the time, and git the  breakfast for Mistress Kate and the two children. Then I could have my  own breakfast in the kitchen. Mistress Kate always get the supper,  though.    Some days she go off with the two children and leave me at the house  all day by myself, and I think maybe I run off, but I didn't know whar  to go.    After I been at that place two years Mr. John come home and stay. He  done some kind of trading in Jackson, Mississippi, and he would be  gone three or four days at a time, but I never did know what kind of  trading it was.    About the time he come home to stay I seen the first Ku Klux I ever  seen one night. I was going down the road in the moonlight and I heard  a hog grunting out in the bushes at the side of the road. I jest walk  right on and in a little ways I hear another hog in some more bushes.  This time I stop and listen, and they's another hog grunts across the  road, and about that time two mens dressed up in long white skirts  steps out into the road in front of me! I was so scared the goose  bumps jump up all over me 'cause I didn't know what they is! They  didn't say a word to me, but jest walked on past me and went on back  the way I had come. Then I see two more mens step out of the woods and  I run from that as fast as I can go!    I ast Miss Kate what they is and she say they Ku Klux, and I better  not go walking off down the road any more. I seen them two, three  times after that, though, but they was riding hosses them times.    I stayed at Mr. John's place two more years, and he got so grumpy and  his wife got so mean I make up my mind to run off. I bundle up my  clothes in a little bundle and hide them, and then I wait until Miss  Kate take the children and go off somewhere, and I light out on foot.  I had me a piece of that hard money what Master Dr. Alexander had give  me one time at Christmas. I had kept it all that time and nobody  knowed I had it, not even Joanna. Old Doctor told me it was fifty  dollars, and I thought I could live on it for a while.    I never had been away from that place, not even to another plantation  in all the four years I was with the Deesons, and I didn't know  which-a-way to go, so I jest started west.    I been walking about all evening it seem like, and I come to a little  town with jest a few houses. I see a nigger man and ask him whar I can  git something to eat, and I say I got fifty dollars.    \"What you doing wid fifty dollars, child? Where you belong at,  anyhow?\" He ask me, and I tell him I belong to Master John Deeson, but  I is running away. I explain that I jest bound out to Mr. John, but  Dr. Alexander my real master, and then that man tell me the first time  I knowed it that I aint a slave no more!    That man Deeson never did tell me, and his wife never did!    Well, dat man asked me about the fifty dollars, and then I found out  that it was jest fifty cents!    I can't begin to tell about all the hard times I had working for  something to eat and roaming around after that. I don't know why I  never did try to git back up around Hazelhurst and hunt up my pappy  and mammy, but I reckon I was jest ignorant and didn't know how to go  about it. Anyways I never did see them no more.    In about three years or a little over I met Bryce Draper on a farm in  Mississippi and we was married. His mammy had had a harder time than I  had. She had five children by a man that belong to her master, Mr.  Bryce and already named one of the boys--that my husband--Bryce after  him, and then he take her in and sell her off away from all her  children!    One was jest a little baby, and the master give it laudanum, but it  didn't die, and he sold her off and lied and said she was a young girl  and didn't have no husband, 'cause the man what bought her said he  didn't want to buy no woman and take her away from a family. That new  master name was Draper.    The last year of the War Mr. Draper die, and his wife already dead,  and he give all his farm to his two slaves and set them free. One of  them slaves was my husband's mammy.    Then right away the whites come and robbed the place of every thing  they could haul off, and run his mammy and the other niggers off! Then  she went and found her boy, that was my husband, and he live with her  until she died, jest before we is married.    We lived in Mississippi a long time, and then we hear about how they  better to the Negroes up in the North, and we go up to Kansas, but  they ain't no better there, and we come down to Indian Territory in  the Creek Nation in 1898, jest as they getting in that Spanish War.    We leased a little farm from the Creek Nation for $15 an acre, but  when they give out the allotments we had to give it up. Then we rent  100 acres from some Indians close to Wagoner, and we farm it all with  my family. We had enough to do it too!    For children we had John and Joe, and Henry, and Jim and Robert and  Will that was big enough to work, and then the girls big enough was  Mary, Nellie, Izora, Dora, and the baby. Dora married Max Colbert. His  people belonged to the Colberts that had Colbert's Crossin' on the Red  River way before the War, and he was a freedman and got allotment.    I lives with Dora now, and we is all happy, and I don't like to talk  about the days of the slavery times, 'cause they never did mean  nothing to me but misery, from the time I was eight years old.    I never will forgive that white man for not telling me I was free, and  not helping me to git back to my mammy and pappy! Lots of white people  done that.
