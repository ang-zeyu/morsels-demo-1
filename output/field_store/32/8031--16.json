Many of these accusations were so monstrous that they carried with them  their own refutation. It was too often the custom in the middle ages to  overwhelm an enemy with incredible charges for it to be fair to accuse  the enemies of Hubert of any excessive malignity. The substantial  innocence of Hubert is clear, for the only charges brought against him  were either errors of judgment and policy, or incredible crimes.  Nevertheless he was in such imminent danger that he took sanctuary with  the canons of Merton in Surrey. Thereupon the king called upon the  Londoners to march to Merton and bring their ancient foe, dead or  alive, to the city. Randolph of Chester interposed between his fallen  enemy and the royal vengeance. He persuaded Henry to countermand the  march to Merton and to suffer the fallen justiciar to leave his refuge  with some sort of safe conduct. But the king was irritated to hear that  Hubert had journeyed into Essex. Again he was pursued, and once more he  was forced to take sanctuary, this time in a chapel near Brentwood.  From this he was dragged by some of the king's household and brought to  London, where he was imprisoned in the Tower. The Bishop of London  complained to the king of this violation of the rights of the Church,  and Hubert was allowed to return to his chapel. However, the levies of  Essex surrounded the precincts, and he was soon forced by hunger to  surrender. He offered to submit himself to the king's will, and was for  a second time confined in the Tower. On November 10, he was brought  before a not unfriendly tribunal, in which the malice of the new  justiciar was tempered by the baronial instincts of the Earls of  Cornwall, Warenne, Pembroke, and Lincoln. He made no effort to defend  himself, and submitted absolutely to the judgment of the king. It was  finally agreed that he should be allowed to retain the lands which he  had inherited from his father, and that all his chattels and the lands  that he had acquired himself should be forfeited to the crown. Further,  he was to be kept in prison in the castle of Devizes under the charge  of the four earls who had tried him.    Peter des Roches was soon in difficulties. The earls who had saved  Hubert began to oppose the whole administration. Their leader was  Richard, Earl of Pembroke, the second son of the great regent, and  since his brother's death head of the house of Marshal. Richard was  bitterly prejudiced against the king and his courtiers by an attempt to  refuse him his brother's earldom. A gallant warrior, handsome and  eloquent, pious, upright, and well educated, Richard, the best of the  marshal's sons, stood for the rest of his short life at the head of the  opposition. He incited his friends to refuse to attend a council  summoned to meet at Oxford, on June 24, 1233. The king would have  sought to compel their presence, had not a Dominican friar, Robert  Bacon, when preaching before the court, warned him that there would be  no peace in England until Bishop Peter and his son were removed from  his counsels. The friar's boldness convinced him that disaffection was  widespread, and he promised the magnates at a later council at London  that he would, with their advice, correct whatever he found there was  need to reform. Meanwhile the Poitevins brought into England fresh  swarms of hirelings from their own land, and Peter des Roches urged  Henry to crush rebellion in the bud. As a warning to greater offenders,  Gilbert Basset was deprived of a manor which he had held since the  reign of King John, and an attempt was made to lay violent hands upon  his brother-in-law, Richard Siward. The two barons resisted, whereupon  all their estates were transferred to Peter of Rivaux. Yet Richard  Marshal still continued to hope for peace, and, after the failure of  earlier councils, set off to attend another assembly fixed for August  1, at Westminster. On his way he learnt from his sister Isabella, the  wife of Richard of Cornwall, that Peter des Roches was laying a trap  for him. In high indignation he took horse for his Welsh estates, and  prepared for rebellion.    The king summoned the military tenants to appear with horses and arms  at Gloucester on the 14th. There Richard Marshal was declared a traitor  and an invasion of his estates was ordered. But the king had not  sufficient resources to carry out his threats, and October saw the  barons once more wrangling with Henry at Westminster, and claiming that  the marshal should be tried by his peers. Peter of Winchester declared  that there were no peers in England as there were in France, and that  in consequence the king had power to condemn any disloyal subject  through his justices. This daringly unconstitutional doctrine provoked  a renewed outcry. The bishops joined the secular magnates, and  threatened their colleague with excommunication. A formidable civil war  broke out. Siward and Basset harried the lands of the Poitevins, while  the marshal made a close alliance with Llewelyn of Wales. The king  still had formidable forces on his side. Richard of Cornwall was  persuaded by Bishop Peter to take up arms for his brother, and the two  new earls, John the Scot of Chester, and John de Lacy of Lincoln,  joined the royal forces. Hubert de Burgh took advantage of the  increasing confusion to escape from Devizes castle to a church in the  town. Dragged back with violence to his prison, he was again, as at  Brentwood, restored to sanctuary through the exertions of the bishop of  the diocese. There he remained, closely watched by his foes, until  October 30, when Siward and Basset drove away the guard, and took him  off with them to the marshal's castle of Chepstow.    The tide of war flowed to the southern march of Wales. Llewelyn and  Richard Marshal devastated Glamorgan, which, as a part of the  Gloucester inheritance, was under the custody of the Bishop of  Winchester. They took nearly all its castles, including that of  Cardiff. Thence they subdued Usk, Abergavenny, and other neighbouring  strongholds, while an independent army, including the marshal's  Pembrokeshire vassals and the men of the princes of South Wales, wasted  months in a vain attack on Carmarthen. The king's vassals were again  summoned to Gloucester, whence Henry led them early in November towards  Chepstow, the centre of the marshal's estates in Gwent. Earl Richard  devastated his lands so effectively that the king could not support his  army on them, and was compelled to move up the Wye valley towards the  castles of Monmouth, Skenfrith, Whitecastle, and Grosmont, the strong  quadrilateral of Upper Gwent which still remained in the hands of the  king's friends. Marching to the most remote of these, Grosmont, on the  upper Monnow, Henry spent several days in the castle, while his army  lay around under canvas. On the night of November 11, the sleeping  soldiers were suddenly set upon by the barons and their Welsh allies;  they fled unarmed to the castle, or scattered in confusion. The  assailants seized their horses, harness, arms and provisions, but  refrained from slaying or capturing them. The royal forces never  rallied. Many gladly went home, giving as their excuse that they were  unable to fight since they had lost their equipment. Henry and his  ministers withdrew to Gloucester. More convinced than ever of the  treachery of Englishmen, the king entrusted the defence of the border  castles to mercenaries from Poitou.    The fighting centred round Monmouth, which Richard approached on the  25th with a small company. A sudden sortie almost overwhelmed the  little band. The marshal held his own heroically against twelve, until  at last Baldwin of Guines, the warden of the castle, took him prisoner.  Thereupon Baldwin fell to the ground, his armour pierced by a lucky  bolt from a crossbow. His followers, smitten with panic, abandoned the  marshal, and bore their leader home. By that time, however, the bulk of  the marshal's forces had come upon the scene. A general engagement  followed, in which the Anglo-Welsh army drove the enemy back into  Monmouth and took possession of the castle. This set the marshal free  to march northwards and join Llewelyn in a vigorous attack upon  Shrewsbury. In January, 1234, they burnt that town and retired to their  own lands loaded with booty. Meanwhile Siward devastated the estates of  the Poitevins and of Richard of Cornwall. Afraid to be cut off from his  retreat to England the king abandoned Gloucester, where he had kept his  melancholy Christmas court, and found a surer refuge in Bishop Peter's  cathedral city. Thereupon Gloucestershire suffered the fate of  Shropshire. \"It was a wretched sight for travellers in that region to  see on the highways innumerable dead bodies lying naked and unburied,  to be devoured by birds of prey, and so polluting the air that they  infected healthy men with mortal sickness.\"[1]        [1] Wendover, iv., 291.    The king swore that he would never make peace with the marshal, unless  he threw himself on the royal mercy as a confessed traitor with a rope  round his neck. Having, however, exhausted all his military resources,  he cunningly strove to entice Richard from Wales to Ireland. The two  Peters wrote to Maurice Fitzgerald, then justiciar of Ireland, and to  the chief foes of the marshal, urging them to fall upon his Irish  estates and capture the traitor, dead or alive. Many of the most  powerful nobles of Ireland lent themselves to the conspiracy.

Snap judgments are ever unsatisfactory. They have often to be reversed.  The present case, however, is too important to warrant a hasty decision.  The final judgment, if it is based on truth, will very strongly  influence the nature of the peace, which will either establish good-will  and stable conditions in the world, or lead to another and even more  complete breakdown of civilization.          What Gladstone Said About Belgium    By George Louis Beer.         Historian; winner of the first Loubat Prize, 1913, for his       book on the origins of the British Colonial system.      In the course of his solemn speech of Aug. 8, 1914, in the House of  Commons Sir Edward Grey quoted some remarks made by Gladstone in 1870 on  the extent of the obligation incurred by the signatory powers to the  Quintuple Treaty of 1839 guaranteeing the neutrality of Belgium. Shorn  from their context as they were, these sentences are by no means  illuminating, and it cannot be said that their citation in this form by  Sir Edward Grey was a very felicitous one. During the paper polemics of  the past months these detached words of Gladstone have been freely used  by Germany's defenders and apologists to maintain that Great Britain of  1870 would not have deemed the events of 1914 a casus belli, and that  its entrance into the present war on account of the violation of  Belgium's neutrality was merely a pretext. During the course of this  controversy Gladstone's attitude has in various ways been grossly  misrepresented, Dr. von Mach of Harvard even stating in the columns of  THE NEW YORK TIMES that Gladstone had declared the Treaty of 1839 \"to be  without force.\" But, apart from such patent distortions, Gladstone's  real position is apparently not clearly defined in the mind of the  general public, which is merely seeking for the unadulterated truth,  regardless of its effect upon the case of any one of the belligerents.    Shortly after the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war in 1870 the  Prussian Ambassador in London informed Gladstone, then Prime Minister,  that some time prior to the existing war France had asked Prussia to  consent to the former country's absorption of Belgium, and that there  was in the possession of the Prussian Government the draft of a treaty  to this effect in the handwriting of M. Benedetti, then French  Ambassador at Berlin. This communication was obviously made, as Lord  Morley tells us, with the object of prompting Gladstone to be the agent  in making the evil news public and thus of prejudicing France in the  judgment of Europe. Gladstone thought this \"no part of his duty,\" and  very shortly thereafter, at the direct instance of Bismarck, this draft  treaty of 1866-7 was communicated by Baron Krause of the Prussian  Embassy in London to Delane, the editor of The Times. On July 25, 1870,  it was published in the columns of that paper and aroused considerable  anxiety in England.    It immediately became imperative upon the British Government to take  some action. As Gladstone wrote to Bright, the publication of this  treaty         has thrown upon us the necessity of doing something fresh to       secure Belgium, or else of saying that under no circumstances       would we take any step to secure her from absorption. This       publication has wholly altered the feeling of the House of       Commons, and no Government could at this moment venture to       give utterance to such an intention about Belgium. But neither       do we think it would be right, even if it were safe, to       announce that we would in any case stand by with folded arms       and see actions done which would amount to a total extinction       of the public right in Europe.      The Special Identical Treaties.    A simple declaration of Great Britain's intention to defend the  neutrality of Belgium by arms in case it were infringed seemed to  Gladstone not to meet the special requirements of the case as revealed  by the proposed Treaty of 1866-7 between Prussia and France. His main  object was to prevent the actual execution of such an agreement, by  means of which the two belligerent powers would settle their quarrels  and satisfy their ambitions at the expense of helpless Belgium. Hence,  on July 30, the British Government opened negotiations with France and  Prussia and within a fortnight had concluded separate but identical  treaties with each of these powers. According to these treaties, in case  the neutrality of Belgium were violated by either France or Germany,  Great Britain agreed to co-operate with the other in its defense. The  preamble of these treaties states that the contracting powers         being desirous at the present time of recording in a solemn       act their fixed determination to maintain the independence and       neutrality of Belgium,    as provided in the Treaty of 1839, have concluded this separate treaty,  which,         without impairing or invalidating the conditions of the said       Quintuple Treaty, shall be subsidiary and accessory to it.    Article III. further provided that these Treaties of 1870 were to expire  twelve months after the conclusion of the existing war, and that  thereafter the independence and neutrality of Belgium would \"continue to  rest, as heretofore,\" on the Treaty of 1839.    These documents tell a plain tale, which is amply confirmed by the  proceedings in Parliament in connection with this matter. On Aug. 5,  1870, while the negotiations leading to the above-mentioned treaties  were still pending, questions were raised in the House of Commons about  the recently published abortive Treaty of 1866-7 between Prussia and  France. In reply Gladstone stated that         the Treaty of 1839 is that under which the relations of the       contracting powers with Belgium are at present regulated;    and that, while he could not explain the intentions of the Government  \"in a matter of this very grave character in answer to a question,\" he  hoped to be able to communicate some further information in an authentic  manner. Three days later, as these treaties with France and Prussia had  been virtually concluded, Gladstone was able to satisfy the anxiety of  the House and outlined their terms. He explicitly stated that, after  their expiration,         the respective parties, being parties to the Treaty of 1839,       shall fall back upon the obligations they took upon themselves       under that treaty.    After Gladstone had finished speaking the leader of the opposition,  Disraeli, took the floor and pointed out that, as a general proposition,         when there is a treaty guarantee so explicit as that expressed       in the Treaty of 1839, I think the wisdom of founding on that       another treaty which involves us in engagements may be open to       doubt.    But he accepted Gladstone's statement         as the declaration of the Cabinet, that they are resolved to       maintain the neutrality and independence of Belgium, I accept       it as a wise and spirited policy, and a policy, in my opinion,       not the less wise because it is spirited.    Gladstone then replied, saying that the reason the Government had not  made a general declaration of its intentions regarding Belgium was that  much danger might arise from such a declaration and that inadvertently  they might have given utterance to words         that might be held to import obligations almost unlimited and       almost irrespectively of circumstances.    We had made up our minds, he continued, that we had a duty to perform,  and we thought a specific declaration of what we thought the obligations  of this country better than any general declaration. Referring to the  two treaties in process of ratification, he concluded:         We thought that by contracting a joint engagement we might       remove the difficulty and prevent Belgium from being       sacrificed.    The policy of the Government continued, however, to be criticised,  mainly on the ground that the Treaty of 1839 amply covered the case. On  Aug. 10 Gladstone defended his policy in the House of Commons in a  speech pitched on a high moral plane, in which he dilated upon Belgium's  historic past and splendid present and on Great Britain's duty to this  little nation irrespective of all questions of its own self-interest.  With genuine fervor, he exclaimed:         If, in order to satisfy a greedy appetite for aggrandisement,       coming whence it may, Belgium were absorbed, the day that       witnessed that absorption would hear the knell of public right       and public law in Europe.... We have an interest in the       independence of Belgium which is wider than that which we may       have in the literal operation of the guarantee. It is found in       answer to the question whether under the circumstance of the       case this country, endowed as it is with influence and power,       would quietly stand by and witness the perpetration of the       direst crime that ever stained the pages of history, and thus       become participators in the sin.      What Gladstone Had in Mind.    What Gladstone had in mind was the scheme of 1866-7, by which France was  to absorb Belgium, with Prussia's consent and aid. He distinctly stated  that the Treaties of 1870 were devised to meet the new state of affairs  disclosed by the publication of this incomplete treaty. It was in order  to prevent the revival of such a conspiracy that Gladstone made separate  and identical treaties in 1870 with France and Prussia. They were a  practical device to secure an effectual enforcement of the Treaty of  1839 under unforeseen and difficult circumstances. The agreement of 1870  was, as Gladstone said, a cumulative treaty added to that of 1839, and  the latter treaty         loses nothing of its force, even during the existence of this       present treaty.
