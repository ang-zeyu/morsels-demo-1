And there are other things, worse things.\"    I sat up, surprised to find myself defending Terra to this girl. After  all these years I was back in my own world. And yet I heard myself say  quietly, \"The Terrans aren't exploiting Wolf. We haven't abolished the  rule of Shainsa. We've changed nothing.\"    It was true. Terra held Wolf by compact, not conquest. They paid, and  paid generously, for the lease of the lands where their Trade Cities  would rise, and stepped beyond them only when invited to do so.    \"We let any city or state that wants to keep its independence govern  itself until it collapses, Dallisa. And they do collapse after a  generation or so. Very few primitive planets can hold out against us.  The people themselves get tired of living under feudal or theocratic  systems, and they beg to be taken into the Empire. That's all.\"    \"But that's just it,\" Dallisa argued. \"You give the people all those  things we used to give them, and you do it better. Just by being here,  you are killing the Dry-towns. They're turning to you and leaving us,  and you let them do it.\"    I shook my head. \"We've kept the Terran Peace for centuries. What do you  expect? Should we give you arms, planes, bombs, weapons to hold your  slaves down?\"    \"Yes!\" she flared at me. \"The Dry-towns have ruled Wolf  since--since--you, you can't even imagine how long! And we made compact  with you to trade here--\"    \"And we have rewarded you by leaving you untouched,\" I said quietly.  \"But we have not forbidden the Dry-towns to come into the Empire and  work with Terra.\"    She said bitterly, \"Men like Kyral will die first,\" and pressed her face  helplessly against me. \"And I will die with them. Miellyn broke away,  but I cannot! Courage is what I lack. Our world is rotten, Race, rotten  all through, and I'm as rotten as the core of it. I could have killed  you today, and I'm here in your arms. Our world is rotten, but I've no  confidence that the new world will be better!\"    I put my hand under her chin, and looked down gravely into her face,  only a pale oval in the darkness. There was nothing I could say; she had  said it all, and truthfully. I had hated and yearned and starved for  this, and when I found it, it turned salty and bloody on my lips, like  Dallisa's despairing kisses. She ran her fingers over the scars on my  face, then gripped her small thin hands around my wrists so fiercely  that I grunted protest.    \"You will not forget me,\" she said in her strangely lilting voice. \"You  will not forget me, although you were victorious.\" She twisted and lay  looking up at me, her eyes glowing faintly luminous in darkness. I knew  that she could see me as clearly as if it were day. \"I think it was my  victory, not yours, Race Cargill.\"    Gently, on an impulse I could not explain, I picked up one delicate  wrist, then the other, unclasping the heavy jeweled bracelets. She let  out a stifled cry of dismay. And then I tossed the chains into a corner  before I drew her savagely into my arms again and forced her head back  under my mouth.           *       *       *       *       *    I said good-bye to her alone, in the reddish, windswept space before the  Great House. She pressed her head against my shoulder and whispered,  \"Race, take me with you!\"    For answer I only picked up her narrow wrists and turned them over on my  palm. The jeweled bracelets were clasped again around the thinly boned  joints, and on some self-punishing impulse she had shortened the chains  so that she could not even put her arms around me. I lifted the punished  wrists to my mouth and kissed them gently.    \"You don't want to leave, Dallisa.\"    I was desperately sorry for her. She would go down with her dying world,  proud and cold and with no place in the new one. She kissed me and I  tasted blood, her thin fettered body straining wildly against me, shaken  with tearing, convulsive sobs. Then she turned and fled back into the  shadow of the great dark house.    I never saw her again.          CHAPTER TEN      A few days later I found myself nearing the end of the trail.    It was twilight in Charin, hot and reeking with the gypsy glare of fires  which burned, smoking, at the far end of the Street of the Six  Shepherds. I crouched in the shadow of a wall, waiting.    My skin itched from the dirty shirtcloak I hadn't changed in days.  Shabbiness is wise in nonhuman parts, and Dry-towners think too much of  water to waste much of it in superfluous washing anyhow. I scratched  unobtrusively and glanced cautiously down the street.    It seemed empty, except for a few sodden derelicts sprawled in  doorways--the Street of the Six Shepherds is a filthy slum--but I made  sure my skean was loose. Charin is not a particularly safe town, even  for Dry-towners, and especially not for Earthmen, at any time.    Even with what Dallisa had told me, the search had been difficult.  Charin is not Shainsa. In Charin, where human and nonhuman live closer  together than anywhere else on the planet, information about such men as  Rakhal can be bought, but the policy is to let the buyer beware. That's  fair enough, because the life of the seller has a way of not being worth  much afterward, either.    A dirty, dust-laden wind was blowing up along the street, heavy with  strange smells. The pungent reek of incense from a street-shrine was in  the smells. The heavy, acrid odor that made my skin crawl. In the hills  behind Charin, the Ghost Wind was rising.    Borne on this wind, the Ya-men would sweep down from the mountains, and  everything human or nearly human would scatter in their path. They would  range through the quarter all night, and in the morning they would melt  away, until the Ghost Wind blew again. At any other time, I would  already have taken cover. I fancied that I could hear, borne on the  wind, the faraway yelping, and envision the plumed, taloned figures  which would come leaping down the street.    In that moment, the quiet of the street split asunder.    From somewhere a girl's voice screamed in shrill pain or panic. Then I  saw her, dodging between two of the chinked pebble-houses. She was a  child, thin and barefoot, a long tangle of black hair flying loose as  she darted and twisted to elude the lumbering fellow at her heels. His  outstretched paw jerked cruelly at her slim wrist.    The little girl screamed and wrenched herself free and threw herself  straight on me, wrapping herself around my neck with the violence of a  storm wind. Her hair got in my mouth and her small hands gripped at my  back like a cat's flexed claws.    \"Oh, help me,\" she gasped between sobs. \"Don't let him get me, don't.\"  And even in that broken plea I took it in that the little ragamuffin did  not speak the jargon of that slum, but the pure speech of Shainsa.    What I did then was as automatic as if it had been Juli. I pulled the  kid loose, shoved her behind me, and scowled at the brute who lurched  toward us.    \"Make yourself scarce,\" I advised. \"We don't chase little girls where I  come from. Haul off, now.\"    The man reeled. I smelled the rankness of his rags as he thrust one  grimy paw at the girl. I never was the hero type, but I'd started  something which I had to carry through. I thrust myself between them and  put my hand on the skean again.    \"You--you Dry-towner.\" The man set up a tipsy howl, and I sucked in my  breath. Now I was in for it. Unless I got out of there damned fast, I'd  lose what I'd come all the way to Charin to find.    I felt like handing the girl over. For all I knew, the bully could be  her father and she was properly in line for a spanking. This wasn't any  of my business. My business lay at the end of the street, where Rakhal  was waiting at the fires. He wouldn't be there long. Already the smell  of the Ghost Wind was heavy and harsh, and little flurries of sand went  racing along the street, lifting the flaps of the doorways.    But I did nothing so sensible. The big lunk made a grab at the girl, and  I whipped out my skean and pantomimed.    \"Get going!\"    \"Dry-towner!\" He spat out the word like filth, his pig-eyes narrowing to  slits. \"Son of the Ape! _Earthman!_\"    \"_Terranan!_\" Someone took up the howl. There was a stir, a rustle, all  along the street that had seemed empty, and from nowhere, it seemed, the  space in front of me was crowded with shadowy forms, human and  otherwise.    \"Earthman!\"    I felt the muscles across my belly knotting into a band of ice. I didn't  believe I'd given myself away as an Earthman. The bully was using the  time-dishonored tactic of stirring up a riot in a hurry, but just the  same I looked quickly round, hunting a path of escape.    \"Put your skean in his guts, Spilkar! Grab him!\"    \"Hai-ai! Earthman! _Hai-ai!_\"    It was the last cry that made me panic. Through the sultry glare at the  end of the street, I could see the plumed, taloned figures of the  Ya-men, gliding through the banners of smoke. The crowd melted open.    I didn't stop to reflect on the fact--suddenly very obvious--that Rakhal  couldn't have been at the fires at all, and that my informant had led me  into an open trap, a nest of Ya-men already inside Charin. The crowd  edged back and muttered, and suddenly I made my choice. I whirled,  snatched up the girl in my arms and ran straight toward the advancing  figures of the Ya-men.    Nobody followed me. I even heard a choked shout that sounded like a  warning. I heard the yelping shrieks of the Ya-men grow to a wild howl,  and at the last minute, when their stiff rustling plumes loomed only a  few yards away, I dived sidewise into an alley, stumbled on some rubbish  and spilled the girl down.    \"Run, kid!\"    She shook herself like a puppy climbing out of water. Her small fingers  closed like a steel trap on my wrist. \"This way,\" she urged in a hasty  whisper, and I found"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19734"],[0,"The Fairy Book (#15)"],[1,"them for  my sake, for they are things of great use. The coat will keep you  invisible, the cap will give you knowledge, the sword will cut  through anything, and the shoes are of vast swiftness; they may be  useful to you in all times of danger, so take them with all my heart.\"    Jack gave many thanks to the giant, and then set off to the prince.  When he had come up to the king's son, they soon arrived at the  dwelling of the beautiful lady, who was under the power of a wicked  magician. She received the prince very politely, and made a noble  feast for him: when it was ended, she rose, and, wiping her mouth with  a fine handkerchief, said, \"My lord, you must submit to the custom of  my palace; to-morrow morning I command you to tell me on whom I bestow  this handkerchief, or lose your head.\" She then left the room.    The young prince went to bed very mournful, but Jack put on his cap of  knowledge, which told him that the lady was forced, by the power of  enchantment, to meet the wicked magician every night in the middle of  the forest. Jack now put on his coat of darkness, and his shoes of  swiftness, and was there before her. When the lady came, she gave the  handkerchief to the magician. Jack, with his sword of sharpness, at  one blow cut off his head; the enchantment was then ended in a moment,  and the lady was restored to her former virtue and goodness. She was  married to the prince on the next day, and soon after went back, with  her royal husband and a great company, to the court of King Arthur,  where they were received with loud and joyful welcomes; and the  valiant hero Jack, for the many great exploits he had done for the  good of his country, was made one of the knights of the Round Table.    As Jack had been so lucky in all his adventures, he resolved not to be  idle for the future, but still to do what services he could for the  honour of the king and the nation. He therefore humbly begged his  majesty to furnish him with a horse and money, that he might travel in  search of new and strange exploits. \"For,\" said he to the king, \"there  are many giants yet living in the remote parts of Wales, to the great  terror and distress of your majesty's subjects; therefore, if it  please you, sire, to favour me in my design, I will soon rid your  kingdom of these giants and monsters in human shape.\"    Now when the king heard this offer, and began to think of the cruel  deeds of these blood-thirsty giants and savage monsters, he gave Jack  everything proper for such a journey. After this, Jack took leave of  the king, the prince, and all the knights, and set off; taking with  him his cap of knowledge, his sword of sharpness, his shoes of  swiftness, and his invisible coat, the better to perform the great  exploits that might fall in his way. He went along over hills and  mountains; and on the third day he came to a wide forest. He had  hardly entered it, when on a sudden he heard dreadful shrieks and  cries; and forcing his way through the trees, saw a monstrous giant  dragging along by the hair of their heads, a handsome knight and a  beautiful lady. Their tears and cries melted the heart of honest  Jack; he alighted from his horse, and tying him to an oak-tree, put on  his invisible coat, under which he carried his sword of sharpness.    When he came up to the giant, he made several strokes at him, but  could not reach his body, on account of the enormous height of the  terrible creature; but he wounded his thighs in several places; and at  length, putting both hands to his sword, and aiming with all his  might, he cut off both the giant's legs just below the garter; and the  trunk of his body, tumbling to the ground, made not only the trees  shake, but the earth itself tremble with the force of his fall. Then  Jack, setting his foot upon his neck, exclaimed: \"Thou barbarous and  savage wretch, behold, I come to execute upon thee the just reward for  all thy crimes;\" and instantly plunged his sword into the giant's  body. The huge monster gave a groan, and yielded up his life into the  hands of the victorious Jack the Giant-Killer, whilst the noble knight  and the virtuous lady were both joyful spectators of his sudden death.  They not only returned Jack hearty thanks for their deliverance, but  also invited him to their house, to refresh himself after his dreadful  encounter, as likewise to receive a reward for his good services.    \"No,\" said Jack, \"I cannot be at ease till I find out the den that was  the monster's habitation.\"    The knight, on hearing this, grew very sorrowful, and replied: \"Noble  stranger, it is too much to run a second hazard; this monster lived  in a den under yonder mountain, with a brother of his, more fierce and  cruel than himself; therefore, if you should go thither, and perish in  the attempt, it would be a heart-breaking thing to me and my lady; so  let me persuade you to go back with us, and desist from any further  pursuit.\"    \"Nay,\" answered Jack, \"if there be another, even if there were twenty,  I would shed the last drop of blood in my body before one of them  should escape. When I have finished this task, I will come and pay my  respects to you.\"    So when they had told him where to find them again, he got on his  horse and went after the dead giant's brother.    Jack had not ridden a mile and a half before he came in sight of the  mouth of the cavern; and, nigh the entrance of it, he saw the other  giant sitting on a huge block of timber, with a knotted iron club  lying by his side, waiting for his brother. His eyes looked like  flames of fire, his face was grim and ugly, and his cheeks were like  two flitches of bacon; the bristles of his beard seemed to be thick  rods of iron wire; and his long locks of hair hung down upon his broad  shoulders like curling snakes. Jack got down from his horse, and  turned him into a thicket; then he put on his coat of darkness, and  drew a little nearer to behold this figure, and said softly, \"Oh,  monster! are you there? It will not be long before I shall take you  fast by the beard.\"    The giant all this while could not see him, by reason of his invisible  coat; so Jack came quite close to him, and struck a blow at his head  with his sword of sharpness; but he missed his aim, and only cut off  his nose, which made him roar like loud claps of thunder. He rolled  his glaring eyes round on every side, but could not see who had given  him the blow; so he took up his iron club, and began to lay about him  like one that was mad with pain and fury.    \"Nay,\" said Jack, \"if this be the case, I will kill you at once.\" So  saying, he slipped nimbly behind him, and jumping upon the block of  timber, as the giant rose from it, he stabbed him in the back; when,  after a few howls, he dropped down dead. Jack cut off his head, and  sent it, with the head of his brother, to King Arthur, by a waggon  which he had hired for that purpose. When Jack had thus killed these  two monsters, he went into their cave in search of their treasure. He  passed through many turnings and windings, which led him to a room  paved with freestone; at the end of it was a boiling cauldron, and on  the right hand stood a large table, where the giants used to dine. He  then came to a window that was secured with iron bars, through which  he saw a number of wretched captives, who cried out when they saw  Jack: \"Alas! alas! young man, you are come to be one among us in this  horrid den.\"    \"I hope,\" said Jack, \"you will not stay here long: but pray tell me  what is the meaning of your being here at all?\"    \"Alas!\" said one poor old man, \"I will tell you, sir. We are persons  that have been taken by the giants who hold this cave, and are kept  till they choose to have a feast; then one of us is to be killed, and  cooked to please their taste. It is not long since they took three for  the same purpose.\"    \"Well,\" said Jack, \"I have given them such a dinner, that it will be  long enough before they have any more.\"    The captives were amazed at his words.    \"You may believe me,\" said Jack, \"for I have killed them both with the  edge of this sword, and have sent their large heads to the court of  King Arthur, as marks of my great success.\"    To show that what he said was true, he unlocked the gate, and set the  captives all free. Then he led them to the great room, placed them  round the table, and placed before them two quarters of beef, with  bread and wine; upon which they feasted their fill. When supper was  over, they searched the giant's coffers, and Jack divided among them  all the treasures. The next morning they set off to their homes, and  Jack to the knight's house, whom he had left with his lady not long  before.    He was received with the greatest joy by the thankful knight and his  lady, who, in honour of Jack's exploits, gave a grand feast, to which  all the nobles and gentry were invited. When the company were  assembled, the knight declared to them the great actions of Jack, and  gave him, as a mark of respect, a fine ring, on which was engraved the  picture of the giant dragging the knight and the lady by the hair,  with this motto round it:--        \"Behold in dire distress were we,        Under a giant's fierce command;      But gained our lives and liberty        From valiant Jack's victorious hand.\"    Among the guests then present were five aged gentlemen, who were  fathers to some of those captives who had been freed by Jack from the  dungeon of the giants. As soon as they heard that he was the person  who had done such wonders, they pressed round him with tears of joy,  to return him thanks for the happiness he had caused them. After this  the bowl went round, and every one drank the health and long life of  the gallant hero. Mirth increased, and the hall was filled with peals  of laughter. But, on a sudden, a herald, pale and breathless, rushed  into the midst of the company, and told them that Thundel, a savage  giant with two "]]]
