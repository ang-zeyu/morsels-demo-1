He had scarcely  accomplished half of his journey when a revolt broke out in his rear;  Paktyas, instead of obeying his instructions, intrigued with the  Ionians, and, with the mercenaries he had hired from them, besieged  Tabalos in the citadel of Sardes. If the place capitulated, the entire  conquest would have to be repeated; fortunately it held out, and  its resistance gave Cyrus time to send its governor reinforcements,  commanded by Mazares the Median. As soon as they approached the city,  Paktyas, conscious that he had lost the day, took refuge at Kyme. Its  inhabitants, on being summoned to deliver him up, refused, but helped  him to escape to Mytilene, where the inhabitants of the island attempted  to sell him to the enemy for a large sum of money. The Kymaeans saved him  a second time, and conveyed him to the temple of Athene Poliarchos  at Chios. The citizens, however, dragged him from his retreat, and  delivered him over to the Median general in exchange for Atarneus, a  district of Mysia, the possession of which they were disputing with the  Lesbians.* Paktyas being a prisoner, the Lydians were soon recalled  to order, and Mazares was able to devote his entire energies to the  reduction of the Greek cities; but he had accomplished merely the sack  of Priene,** and the devastation of the suburbs of Magnesia on the  aeander, when he died from some illness.         * A passage which has been preserved of Charon of Lampsacus       sums up in a few words the account given by Herodotus of the       adventures of Paktyas, but without mentioning the treachery       of the islanders: he confines himself to saying Cyrus caught       the fugitive after the latter had successively left Chios       and Mytilene.         ** Herodotus attributes the taking of this city to the       Persian Tabules, who is evidently the Tabalos of Herodotus.    The Median Harpagus, to whom tradition assigns so curious a part as  regards Astyages and the infant Cyrus, succeeded him as governor of the  ancient Lydian kingdom, and completed the work which he had begun.  The first two places to be besieged were Phocaea and Teos, but their  inhabitants preferred exile to slavery; the Phocaeans sailed away to  found Marseilles in the western regions of the Mediterranean, and  the people of Teos settled along the coast of Thracia, near to the  gold-mines of the Pangseus, and there built Abdera on the site of an  ancient Clazomenian colony. The other Greek towns were either taken by  assault or voluntarily opened their gates, so that ere long both Ionians  and AEolians were, with the exception of the Samians, under Persian rule.  The very position of the latter rendered them safe from attack; without  a fleet they could not be approached, and the only people who could have  furnished Cyrus with vessels were the Phoenicians, who were not as yet  under his power. The rebellion having been suppressed in this quarter,  Harpagus made a descent into Caria; the natives hastened to place  themselves under the Persian yoke, and the Dorian colonies scattered  along the coast, Halicarnas-sus, Cnidos, and the islands of Cos and  Rhodes, followed their examples, but Lycia refused to yield without a  struggle.    [Illustration: 083.jpg A LYCIAN CITY UPON ITS INACCESSIBLE ROCK]         The rock and tombs of Tlos, drawn by Boudier, from the view       in Fellows.    Its steep mountain chains, its sequestered valleys, its towns and  fortresses perched on inaccessible rocks, all rendered it easy for the  inhabitants to carry on a successful petty warfare against the enemy.  The inhabitants of Xanthos, although very inferior in numbers, issued  down into the plain and disputed the victory with the invaders for a  considerable time; at length their defeat and the capitulation of their  town induced the remainder of the Lycians to lay down arms, and brought  about the final pacification of the peninsula. It was parcelled out into  several governorships, according to its ethnographical affinities;  as for instance, the governorship of Lydia, that of Ionia, that of  Phrygia,* and others whose names are unknown to us. Harpagus appeared  to have resided at Sardes, and exercised vice-regal functions over the  various districts, but he obtained from the king an extensive property  in Lycia and in Caria, which subsequently caused these two provinces to  be regarded as an appanage of his family.         * Herodotus calls a certain Mitrobates satrap of Daskylion;       he had perhaps been already given this office by Cyrus.       Orcetes had been made governor of Ionia and Lydia by Cyrus.    While thus consolidating his first conquest, Cyrus penetrated into the  unknown regions of the far East. Nothing would have been easier for him  than to have fallen upon Babylon and overthrown, as it were by the way,  the decadent rule of Nabonidus; but the formidable aspect which the  empire still presented, in spite of its enfeebled condition, must have  deceived him, and he was unwilling to come into conflict with it until  he had made a final reckoning with the restless and unsettled peoples  between the Caspian and the slopes on the Indian side of the table-land  of Iran. As far as we are able to judge, they were for the most part of  Iranian extraction, and had the same religion, institutions, and customs  as the Medes and Persians. Tradition had already referred the origin of  Zoroaster, and the scene of his preaching, to Bactriana, that land of  heroes whose exploits formed the theme of Persian epic song. It is not  known, as we have already had occasion to remark, by what ties it was  bound to the empire of Cyaxares, nor indeed if it ever had been actually  attached to it. We do not possess, unfortunately, more than almost  worthless scraps of information on this part of the reign of Cyrus,  perhaps the most important period of it, since then, for the first  time, peoples who had been hitherto strangers to the Asiatic world were  brought within its influence. If Ctesias is to be credited, Bactriana  was one of the first districts to be conquered. Its inhabitants were  regarded as being among the bravest of the East, and furnished the best  soldiers. They at first obtained some successes, but laid down arms on  hearing that Cyrus had married a daughter of Astyages.* This tradition  was prevalent at a time when the Achaemenians were putting forward the  theory that they, and Cyrus before them, were the legitimate successors  of the old Median sovereigns; they welcomed every legend which tended to  justify their pretensions, and this particular one was certain to please  them, since it attributed the submission of Bactriana not to a mere  display of brute force, but to the recognition of an hereditary right.  The annexation of this province entailed, as a matter of course, that  of Margiana, of the Khoramnians,** and of Sogdiana. Cyrus constructed  fortresses in all these districts, the most celebrated being that  of Kyropolis, which commanded one of the principal fords of the  Iaxartes.***         * This is the campaign which Ctesias places before the       Lydian war, but which Herodotus relegates to a date after       the capture of Sardes.         ** Ctesias must have spoken of the submission of these       peoples, for a few words of a description which he gave of       the Khoramnians have been preserved to us.         *** Tomaschek identifies Kyra or Kyropolis with the present       Ura-Tepe, but distinguishes it from the Kyreskhata of       Ptolemy, to which he assigns a site near Usgent.    The steppes of Siberia arrested his course on the north, but to the  east, in the mountains of Chinese Turkestan, the Sakas, who were  renowned for their wealth and bravery, did not escape his ambitious  designs. The account which has come down to us of his campaigns against  them is a mere romance of love and adventure, in which real history  plays a very small part. He is said to have attacked and defeated  them at the first onset, taking their King Amorges prisoner; but this  capture, which Cyrus considered a decisive advantage, was supposed to  have turned the tide of fortune against him. Sparethra, the wife of  Amorges, rallied the fugitives round her, defeated the invaders in  several engagements, and took so many of their men captive, that they  were glad to restore her husband to her in exchange for the prisoners  she had made. The struggle finally ended, however, in the subjection of  the Sakae; they engaged to pay tribute, and thenceforward constituted  the advance-guard of the Iranians against the Nomads of the East. Cyrus,  before quitting their neighbourhood, again ascended the table-land, and  reduced Ariana, Thatagus, Harauvati, Zaranka, and the country of Cabul;  and we may well ask if he found leisure to turn southwards beyond Lake  Hamun and reach the shores of the Indian Ocean. One tradition, of little  weight, relates that, like Alexander at a later date, he lost his army  in the arid deserts of Gedrosia; the one fact that remains is that the  conquest of Gedrosia was achieved, but the details of it are lost. The  period covered by his campaigns was from five to six years, from 545 to  539, but Cyrus returned from these expeditions into the unknown only to  plan fresh undertakings. There remained nothing now to hinder him from  marching against the Chaldaeans, and the discord prevailing at Babylon  added to his chance of success. Nabonidus's passion for archaeology  had in no way lessened since the opening of his reign. The temple  restorations prompted by it absorbed the bulk of his revenues. He made  excavations in the sub-structures of the most ancient sanctuaries,  such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17330"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 10 (of 12) (#15)"],[1,"in place, and find as wide a field of usefulness, in governing  a kingdom as in the employments of the teacher, the lawyer, or the  physician, who so often claim them as their own.    His last public act, in the thirty-eighth year of his reign, was ordered  by the same forbearance which had governed every part of his life.  Feeling the weight of years press heavily upon him, that he was less  able than formerly to bear the duties of his office, and wishing to see  his son firmly seated on the throne, he laid aside his diadem and  his title, and, without consulting either the army or the capital,  proclaimed Ptolemy, his son by Berenice, king, and contented himself  with the modest rank of somatophylax, or satrap, to his successor. He  had used his power so justly that he was not afraid to lay it down;  and he has taught us how little of true greatness there is in rank by  showing how much more there is in resigning it. This is perhaps the most  successful instance known of a king, who had been used to be obeyed by  armies and by nations, willingly giving up his power when he found his  bodily strength no longer equal to it. Ptolemy Soter had the happiness  of having a son willing to follow in the track which he had laid down  for him, and of living to see the wisdom of his own laws proved by the  well-being of the kingdom under his son and successor.    But while we are watching the success of Ptolemy's plans, and the rise  of this Greek monarchy at Alexandria, we cannot help being pained with  the thought that the Kopts of Upper Egypt are forgotten, and asking  whether it would not have been still better to have raised Thebes to  the place which it once held, and to have recalled the days of Ramses,  instead of trying what might seem the hopeless task of planting Greek  arts in Africa. But a review of this history will show that, as far as  human forethought can judge, this could not have been done. A people  whose religious opinions were fixed against all change, like the pillars  upon which they were carved, and whose philosophy had not noticed that  men's minds were made to move forward, had no choice but to be left  behind and trampled on, as their more active neighbours marched onwards  in the path of improvement. If Thebes had fallen only on the conquest by  Cambyses, if the rebellions against the Persians had been those of Kopts  throwing off their chains and struggling for freedom, we might have  hoped to have seen Egypt, on the fall of Darius, again rise under kings  of the blood and language of the people; and we should have thought the  gilded and half-hid chains of the Ptolemies were little better than the  heavy yoke of the Persians. This, however, is very far from having been  the case. We first see the kings of Lower Egypt guarding their thrones  at Sais by Greek soldiers; and then, that every struggle of Inarus, of  Nectanebo, and of Tachos, against the Persians, was only made by the  courage and arms of Greeks hired in the Delta by Egyptian gold. During  the three hundred years before Alexander was hailed by Egypt as its  deliverer, scarcely once had the Kopts, trusting to their own courage,  stood up in arms against either Persians or Greeks; and the country was  only then con-quered without a battle because the power and arms were  already in the hands of the Greeks; because in the mixed races of  the Delta the Greeks were so far the strongest, though not the most  numerous, that a Greek kingdom rose there with the same ease, and for  the same reasons, that an Arab kingdom rose in the same place nine  centuries later.    [Illustration: 098.jpg NIT, GODDESS OF SAIS.]    [Illustration: 099.jpg A CAT MUMMY]    Moral worth, national pride, love of country, and the better feelings of  clanship are the chief grounds upon which a great people can be raised.  These feelings are closely allied to self-denial, or a willingness on  the part of each man to give up much for the good of the whole. By this,  chiefly, public monuments are built, and citizens stand by one another  in battle; and these feelings were certainly strong in Upper Egypt  in the days of its greatness. But, when the throne was moved to Lower  Egypt, when the kingdom was governed by the kings of Sais, and even  afterwards, when it was struggling against the Persians, these virtues  were wanting, and they trusted to foreign hirelings in their struggle  for freedom. The Delta was peopled by three races of men, Kopts, Greeks,  and Phoenicians, or Arabs; and even before the sceptre was given to the  Greeks by Alexander's conquests, we have seen that the Kopts had lost  the virtues needed to hold it.    [Illustration: 100.jpg TAILPIECE]          CHAPTER III.--PTOLEMY PHILADELPHUS. B.C. 284-246      We know of few princes who ever mounted a throne with such fair  prospects before them as the second Ptolemy. He was born in Cos, an  island on the coast of Caria, which the Ptolemies kept as a family  fortress, safe from Egyptian rebellion and Alexandrian rudeness, and,  while their fleets were masters of the sea, safe from foreign armies. He  had been brought up with great care, and, being a younger son, was not  spoilt by that flattery which in all courts is so freely offered to the  heir. He first studied letters and philosophy under Philetas of Cos,  an author of some elegies and epigrams now lost; and as he grew up, he  found himself surrounded by all the philosophers and writers with whom  his father mixed on the easiest terms of friendship. During the  long reign of Ptolemy Soter the people had been made happy by wise  regulations and good laws, trade had been flourishing, the cities had  greatly prospered, and the fortresses had been everywhere strengthened.    [Illustration: 102.jpg PHAROS IN OLD ALEXANDRIA]    The Grecian troops were well trained, their loyalty undoubted, and the  Egyptians were enrolled in a phalanx, armed and disciplined like  the Macedonians. The population of the country was counted at seven  millions. Alexandria, the capital of the kingdom, was not only the  largest trading city in the world, but was one of the most favoured  seats of learning. It surely must have been easy to foresee that the  prince, then mounting the throne, even if but slightly gifted with  virtues, would give his name to a reign which could not be otherwise  than remarkable in the history of Egypt. But Philadelphus, though like  his father he was not free from the vices of his times and of his rank,  had more of wisdom than is usually the lot of kings; and, though we  cannot but see that he was only watering the plants and gathering  the fruit where his father had planted, yet we must at the same time  acknowledge that Philadelphus was a successor worthy of Ptolemy Soter.  He may have been in the twenty-third year of his age when his father  gave up to him the cares and honours of royalty.    The first act of his reign, or rather the last of his father's reign,  was the proclamation, or the ceremony, of showing the new king to  the troops and people. All that was dazzling, all that was costly or  curious, all that the wealth of Egypt could buy or the gratitude of the  provinces could give, was brought forth to grace this religious show,  which, as we learn from the sculptures in the old tombs, was copied  rather from the triumphs of Ramses and Thutmosis than from anything that  had been seen in Greece.    The procession began with the pomp of Osiris, at the head of which were  the Sileni in scarlet and purple cloaks, who opened the way through the  crowd. Twenty satyrs followed on each side of the road, bearing torches;  and then Victories with golden wings, clothed in skins, each with  a golden staff six cubits long, twined round with ivy. An altar was  carried next, covered with golden ivy-leaves, with a garland of golden  vine-leaves tied with white ribands; and this was followed by a hundred  and twenty boys in scarlet frocks, carrying bowls of crocus, myrrh,  and frankincense, which made the air fragrant with the scent. Then came  forty dancing satyrs crowned with golden ivy-leaves, with their naked  bodies stained with gay colours, each carrying a crown of vine leaves  and gold; then two Sileni in scarlet cloaks and white boots, one having  the hat and wand of Mercury and the other a trumpet; and between them  walked a man, six feet high, in tragic dress and mask, meant for the  Year, carrying a golden cornucopia. He was followed by a tall and  beautiful woman, meant for the Lustrum of five years, carrying in one  hand a crown and in the other a palm-branch. Then came an altar, and a  troop of satyrs in gold and scarlet, carrying golden drinking-cups.    Then came Philiscus the poet, the priest of Osiris, with all the  servants of the god; then the Delphic tripods, the prizes which were  to be given in the wrestling matches; that for the boys was nine cubits  high, and that for the men twelve cubits high. Next came a four-wheeled  car, fourteen cubits long and eight wide, drawn along by one hundred  and eighty men, on which was the statue of Osiris, fifteen feet high,  pouring wine out of a golden vase, and having a scarlet frock down to  his feet, with a yellow transparent robe over it, and over all a scarlet  cloak. Before the statue was a large golden bowl, and a tripod with  bowls of incense on it. Over the whole was an awning of ivy and vine  leaves; and in the same chariot were the priests and priestesses of the  god.    This was followed by a smaller chariot drawn by sixty men, in which was  the statue of Isis in a robe of yellow and gold. Then came a chariot  full of grapes, and another with a large cask of wine, which was poured  out on the road, as the procession moved on, and at which the eager  crowd filled their jugs and drinking-cups. Then came another band of  satyrs and Sileni, and more chariots of wine; then eighty Delphic vases  of silver, and Panathenaic and other vases; and sixteen hundred dancing  boys in"]]]
