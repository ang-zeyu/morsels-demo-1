In what way can we recognize the  tenderness of a Father who created the majority of His children but for  the purpose of dragging out a life of pain, anxiety, and bitterness upon  this earth? Is there any more fatal boon than this pretended liberty  which, it is said, men can abuse, and thereby expose themselves to the  risk of eternal misery?          XCII.--THE LIFE OF MORTALS, ALL WHICH TAKES PLACE HERE BELOW, TESTIFIES  AGAINST MAN'S LIBERTY AND AGAINST THE JUSTICE AND GOODNESS OF A  PRETENDED GOD.    In calling mortals into life, what a cruel and dangerous game does the  Divinity force them to play! Thrust into the world without their wish,  provided with a temperament of which they are not the masters, animated  by passions and desires inherent in their nature, exposed to snares  which they have not the skill to avoid, led away by events which they  could neither foresee nor prevent, the unfortunate beings are obliged to  follow a career which conducts them to horrible tortures.    Travelers assert that in some part of Asia reigns a sultan full of  phantasies, and very absolute in his will. By a strange mania this  prince spends his time sitting before a table, on which are placed six  dice and a dice-box. One end of the table is covered with a pile of  gold, for the purpose of exciting the cupidity of the courtiers and of  the people by whom the sultan is surrounded. He, knowing the weak point  of his subjects, speaks to them in this way: \"Slaves! I wish you well;  my aim is to enrich you and render you all happy. Do you see these  treasures? Well, they are for you! try to win them; let each one in turn  take this box and these dice; whoever shall have the good luck to raffle  six, will be master of this treasure; but I warn you that he who has not  the luck to throw the required number, will be precipitated forever into  an obscure cell, where my justice exacts that he shall be burned by a  slow fire.\" Upon this threat of the monarch, they regarded each other in  consternation; no one willing to take a risk so dangerous. \"What!\" said  the angry sultan, \"no one wants to play? Oh, this does not suit me! My  glory demands that you play. You will raffle then; I wish it; obey  without replying!\" It is well to observe that the despot's dice are  prepared in such a way, that upon a hundred thousand throws there is but  one that wins; thus the generous monarch has the pleasure to see his  prison well filled, and his treasures seldom carried away. Mortals! this  Sultan is your God; His treasures are heaven; His cell is hell; and you  hold the dice!          XCIII.--IT IS NOT TRUE THAT WE OWE ANY GRATITUDE TO WHAT WE CALL  PROVIDENCE.    We are constantly told that we owe an infinite gratitude to Providence  for the countless blessings It is pleased to lavish upon us. They boast  above all that our existence is a blessing. But, alas! how many mortals  are really satisfied with their mode of existence? If life has its  sweets, how much of bitterness is mingled with it? Is not one bitter  trouble sufficient to blight all of a sudden the most peaceful and happy  life? Is there a great number of men who, if it depended upon them,  would wish to begin, at the same sacrifice, the painful career into  which, without their consent, destiny has thrown them? You say that  existence itself is a great blessing. But is not this existence  continually troubled by griefs, fears, and often cruel and undeserved  maladies. This existence, menaced on so many sides, can we not be  deprived of it at any moment? Who is there, after having lived for some  time, who has not been deprived of a beloved wife, a beloved child, a  consoling friend, whose loss fills his mind constantly? There are very  few mortals who have not been compelled to drink from the cup of  bitterness; there are but few who have not often wished to die. Finally,  it did not depend upon us to exist or not to exist. Would the bird be  under such great obligations to the bird-catcher for having caught it in  his net and for having put it into his cage, in order to eat it after  being amused with it?          XCIV.--TO PRETEND THAT MAN IS THE BELOVED CHILD OF PROVIDENCE, GOD'S  FAVORITE, THE ONLY OBJECT OF HIS LABORS, THE KING OF NATURE, IS FOLLY.    In spite of the infirmities, the troubles, the miseries to which man is  compelled to submit in this world; in spite of the danger which his  alarmed imagination creates in regard to another, he is still foolish  enough to believe himself to be God's favorite, the only aim of all His  works. He imagines that the entire universe was made for him; he calls  himself arrogantly the king of nature, and ranks himself far above other  animals. Poor mortal! upon what can you establish your high pretensions?  It is, you say, upon your soul, upon your reason, upon your sublime  faculties, which place you in a condition to exercise an absolute  authority over the beings which surround you. But weak sovereign of this  world, art thou sure one instant of the duration of thy reign? The least  atoms of matter which you despise, are they not sufficient to deprive  you of your throne and life? Finally, does not the king of animals  terminate always by becoming food for the worms?    You speak of your soul. But do you know what your soul is? Do you not  see that this soul is but the assemblage of your organs, from which life  results? Would you refuse a soul to other animals who live, who think,  who judge, who compare, who seek pleasure, and avoid pain even as you  do, and who often possess organs which are better than your own? You  boast of your intellectual faculties, but these faculties which render  you so proud, do they make you any happier than other creatures? Do you  often make use of this reason which you glory in, and which religion  commands you not to listen to? Those animals which you disdain because  they are weaker or less cunning than yourself, are they subject to  troubles, to mental anxieties, to a thousand frivolous passions, to a  thousand imaginary needs, of which your heart is continually the prey?  Are they, like you, tormented by the past, alarmed for the future?    Limited solely to the present, what you call their instinct, and what I  call their intelligence, is it not sufficient to preserve and to defend  them and to provide for their needs? This instinct, of which you speak  with disdain, does it not often serve them much better than your  wonderful faculties? Their peaceable ignorance, is it not more  advantageous than these extravagant meditations and these futile  investigations which render you miserable, and for which you are driven  to murdering beings of your own noble kind? Finally, these animals, have  they, like mortals, a troubled imagination which makes them fear not  only death, but even eternal torments? Augustus, having heard that  Herod, king of Judea, had murdered his sons, cried out: \"It would be  better to be Herod's pig than his son!\" We can say as much of men; this  beloved child of Providence runs much greater risks than all other  animals. After having suffered a great deal in this world, do we not  believe ourselves in danger of suffering for eternity in another?          XCV.--COMPARISON BETWEEN MAN AND ANIMALS.    What is the exact line of demarcation between man and the other animals  which he calls brutes? In what way does he essentially differ from the  beasts? It is, we are told, by his intelligence, by the faculties of his  mind, by his reason, that man is superior to all the other animals,  which in all they do, act but by physical impulsions, reason taking no  part. But the beasts, having more limited needs than men, do very well  without these intellectual faculties, which would be perfectly useless  in their way of living. Their instinct is sufficient for them, while all  the faculties of man are hardly sufficient to render his existence  endurable, and to satisfy the needs which his imagination, his  prejudices, and his institutions multiply to his torment.    The brute is not affected by the same objects as man; it has neither the  same needs, nor the same desires, nor the same whims; it early reaches  maturity, while nothing is more rare than to see the human being  enjoying all of his faculties, exercising them freely, and making a  proper use of them for his own happiness.          XCVI.--THERE ARE NO MORE DETESTABLE ANIMALS IN THIS WORLD THAN TYRANTS.    We are assured that the human soul is a simple substance; but if the  soul is such a simple substance, it ought to be the same in all the  individuals of the human race, who all ought to have the same  intellectual faculties; however, this is not the case; men differ as  much in qualities of mind as in the features of the face. There are in  the human race, beings as different from one another as man is from a  horse or a dog. What conformity or resemblance do we find between some  men? What an infinite distance between the genius of a Locke, of a  Newton, and that of a peasant, of a Hottentot, or of a Laplander!    Man differs from other animals but by the difference of his  organization, which causes him to produce effects of which they are not  capable. The variety which we notice in the organs of individuals of the  human race, suffices to explain to us the difference which is often  found between them in regard to the intellectual faculties. More or less  of delicacy in these organs, of heat in the blood, of promptitude in the  fluids, more or less of suppleness or of rigidity in the fibers and the  nerves, must necessarily produce the infinite diversities which are  noticeable in the minds of men. It is by exercise, by habitude, by  education, that the human mind is developed and succeeds in rising above  the beings which surround it; man, without culture and without  experience, is a being as devoid of reason and of industry as the brute.  A stupid individual is a man whose organs"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17615"],[0,"In Search of the Okapi (#15)"],[1,"even nearer. As they pulled the  Okapi closer into the shadows a boat swept into view, and, evidently  obeying directions given from the island where the fire was, took up  a position overlooking the first hiding-place of the Okapi.  All the  time the launch drew nearer, racing evidently to take advantage of  the brief spell of light before the dark, and the canoes raced from  the shore to take part in the great man-hunt. As they drew near, the  fleet scattered, some going up-stream, others down, and the  remainder dashing straight on in among the islands.    As they scattered to take up their positions, there came a report  from the launch's gun.    It was the signal for the drive to begin, and as the echo rolled  away, a deep silence followed the previous uproar. The savage look-  out men, standing erect in the sharp bows of the long canoes,  motioned to the paddlemen to  stop, and all heads were turned to the  wind to catch any sound in case the hunted should attempt to move  away. Fierce eyes were directed towards one spot, where the fire  blazed on the island over against the place where the Okapi had laid  up.    Not a whisper had come from the three in the boat. After they had  first seen the signal smoke, which told them so plainly that Mr.  Hume's suspicions were justified, they had crouched low, watching  every move that was visible to them.    A canoe rounded their hiding-place and crept stealthily by towards  the narrow passage with its screen of bushes, every man fixing his  gaze directly ahead, the broad nostrils quivering, and spears  grasped in the hands that were not busy with the paddles.    Then through the silence there came the sharp yap of a dog who has  struck the scent, and next the loud, excited bark. Too cautious to  land on the suspected island themselves, some of the canoe-men had  drawn near from the north side and thrown a cur on the island to  find the white men in their supposed hiding. The dog had, of course,  struck the spoor and found the dark hiding, empty, but suspicious-  looking. In his fear he gave tongue. The gun from the launch fired,  a yell rose from every side, and all the canoes near dashed forward.    Mr. Hume shoved out, and the Okapi slipped up-stream  undetected  under the uproar, darting from one island to another, and keeping as  near the banks as  possible.  They were doing splendidly!  The enemy  was behind; it seemed that they must reap the advantage of their  caution and resourcefulness, when, without any  intimation of  danger, they came right upon a canoe lying in mid-channel between  two of the innumerable islands.    \"Back-water!\" cried Mr. Hume, at once.    The boys obeyed without, of course, any knowledge of the course, and  the Okapi slackened down.    \"Well met, my friends,\" came a voice they knew; and the two looked  over their shoulders.    \"Dished, after all!\" muttered Compton, bitterly; then he snatched up  his rifle.    \"Hassan thought you would come along this way,\" went on the junior  officer--for it was he; \"but I doubted, and yet here you are.\"    \"The praise be to Allah,\" remarked Hassan, piously, as he glanced  along his rifle.    The Okapi had lost the little way she was making, and began to move  with the current away from the canoe. Mr. Hume suddenly spoke for  the first time since his order.    \"Turn that canoe round!\" he roared; and his Express leapt to his  shoulder. The boys followed suit.    The paddle-men promptly ducked their heads, and one of them called  out in his lingo that this was the slayer of crocodiles and of the  great bull.    \"But, my friend----\" began the Belgian, who now, together with  Hassan and several Arabs in the stern of the canoe, came under the  levelled barrels.    \"Oblige me,\" said the hunter. \"Compton, cover that Arab Hassan with  your rifle, and Venning, take the man to the right. If they move  their weapons, shoot.\"    Hassan snarled and turned a furious face to the Belgian. \"This is  your folly!\" he hissed. \"Why didn't you fire at once?\"    Mr. Hume repeated his orders in the native tongue, and the cowed  men, using their paddles, turned the long canoe round.    \"Now, keep straight on in silence, till I tell you to stop. Follow  them\"--this to the boys, who immediately picked up their sculls.    The Belgian glanced back. \"Come,\" he said, \"this is not amiable.  See, we could, had we liked, have caught you in an ambush.\"    \"And so your friend Hassan advised you, eh?\" replied Mr. Hume; \"but  you thought we would surrender at discretion. You see, you were  mistaken. Now just listen to me. Do not look back again, or this  rifle may go off. Out with the sculls, lads.\"    Hassan growled out curses at this complete turning of the tables  upon him, but the natives bent to their paddles. They bad no wish to  be shot down in the cause of the slave-hunter, however ready they  would have been to have fallen on the Englishmen if the advantage  had been with them.    The darkness was coming on fast as the strange procession passed up  the channel to thread the intricate passages among the clustering  islands. In a few minutes the canoe would be almost hidden from  sight; but the very last thing Mr. Hume wanted was to keep company.    \"Baleka!\" he cried. \"Quicker! I have your heads in one line. One  bullet would stretch you all dead. Quicker!\" he roared.    The broad paddles flashed, the water churned fiercely, and the long  canoe shot off into the dusk; and as it sped on the hunter pulled  the wheel over, altering the course of the Okapi, and taking it  towards the open water between the islands and the south bank.    \"By Jove! you did that splendidly,\" said Compton. \"I thought it was  all over.\"    Venning laughed that little nervous laugh of his. \"I wonder why they  gave in like that?\"    \"We had the drop on then,\" said Mr. Hume, grimly; \"and we knew our  own minds. Now, then! up with the sail, and, dark or not, we must  get on.\"    Very smartly and silently the boys hoisted the sail, and as the  Okapi beat up they heard a great uproar from the left. Apparently  Hassan was using violent language to the Belgian officer for not  having ambushed the \"dogs of Englishmen.\" Then several rifle-shots  were fired from the canoe, and answered from the people down-stream,  who were still searching for their prey. But the Okapi slipped on,  making a musical ripple under her bows, until she beat up under the  great wall of woods on the south bank, when she tacked away into the  gathering darkness, feeling for the wind. Down-river was the glare  of fires at different spots, where the men had landed from the  different canoes; but there was no light ahead through the whole  vast width of the river, and they dare not even rig up their own  lamp to get what little guidance it could give. The wind was fitful,  and the direct progress was slow, so that when the glow went out of  the sky they were still within hearing of the shouting.  Indeed, it  seemed that the shouting gained on them, as if the men in Hassan's  boat were keeping their place in the renewed pursuit, and directing  other crews as to the line they should take.    Then the sail napped idly against the mast as the wind died down,  and as they unstepped the mast before depending on the screw, a fire  sprang out right ahead, sending up a tall column of flame that flung  its reflection far across the waters.    \"We must make out into the islands again,\" said Mr. Hume; but, as  the boat pointed on the new course, an answering flame sprang up,  and then another and another at brief intervals, until from the fire  on the bank there was a semicircle of flame from island to island  barring their advance.    \"There must be an army out,\" muttered Venning.    \"It is one canoe, but most likely Hassan's, firing the dried reeds  as they pass from island to island.\"    \"Then the flames will die out soon.\"    \"Yes, they will die down; but in the mean time other canoes will  come up, and if there are men on the shore waiting, they will see us  outlined against the reflection.\"    Even as he finished there came a shrill cry from the shore, followed  by the wild beat of the war-drum, and next by the sound of paddling.    \"Shall we make a bolt for it?\" asked Compton.    \"Not yet,\" said the hunter; and he brought the Okapi stem on for the  deep shadows under the bank.    The oars moved softly, covered by the noise of the paddling, and the  Okapi slipped out of the reflection into the darkness, while the  canoes dashed straight on, passing about one hundred yards behind  her stem.    \"Easy now,\" whispered Mr. Hume, \"and keep quite still.\"    The oars were drawn in as the Okapi, caught in a current,  was borne  right into the bank at a spot where the trees came down to the  brink. Mr. Hume caught a branch, and the stern swung round. Before  them, about a quarter of a mile off perhaps, was the great fire they  had first seen, still fed by natives, whose dark figures stood out  and disappeared as they moved about. Out on the river they could  hear the noise of paddles, and of men calling to each other.    Near them on the bank something moved, and above the swishing of the  current they heard the low whine of an animal.    Mr. Hume pricked his ears at the sound, and crept into the well,  where the boys sat anxiously watching.    \"Put on your coats,\" he muttered.    Again there came the whine, then the sound of an animal scrambling,  and next the patter of feet.    \"A dog,\" whispered Venning.    \"I advise keeping on,\" said Compton.    \"And I,\" replied Mr. Hume, \"advise that we have something to eat.  Will you serve us, Venning?\"    They ate hungrily, for through the day they had been too much  excited to think of food. And as they feasted their eyes were on the  move, and their ears on the stretch. Their manoeuvre had apparently  succeeded, for the canoes were all beating up towards the fires  under the belief that the Okapi had kept on, and there was no  suspicious movement  by the "]]]
