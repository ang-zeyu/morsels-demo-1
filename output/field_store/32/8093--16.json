This end of the state couldn't support another arms-dealer, and  with the reputation he's made for himself, he'd be the one to go under.\"  She stubbed out her cigarette and finished her drink. \"If you don't mind,  Pierre, I think I'll go home.\"    \"I'm not feeling very festive, myself, right now.\" The ex-Marine rose and  held out his hand to Rand. \"Don't get the idea, Jeff, that anybody here  holds this against you. You have your clients' interests to look out  for.\"    \"Well, if this be treason make the most of it,\" Rand said, \"but I hope  Rivers doesn't go through with it. I'd like to see you people get the  collection, and I'd hate to see a lot of nice pistols like that get into  the hands of a damned swindler like Rivers.... Maybe I can catch him with  the hot-goods on him, and send him up for about three-to-five.\"    \"Oh, he's too smart for that,\" Karen despaired. \"He can get away with  faking, but the dumbest jury in the world would know what receiving  stolen goods was, and he knows it.\"    Dorothy and Irene Gresham accompanied Pierre and Karen downstairs. After  they had gone, Gresham tried, not very successfully, to inject more life  into the party with another round of drinks. For a while they discussed  the personal and commercial iniquities of Arnold Rivers. Trehearne and  MacBride, who had come together in the latter's car, left shortly, and  half an hour later, Philip Cabot rose and announced that he, too, was  leaving.    \"You haven't seen my collection since before the war, Jeff,\" he said. \"If  you're not sleepy, why don't you stop at my place and see what's new?  You're staying at the Flemings'; my house is along your way, about a mile  on the other side of the railroad.\"    They went out and got into their cars. Rand kept Cabot's taillight in  sight until the broker swung into his drive and put his car in the  garage. Rand parked beside the road, took the Leech & Rigdon out of the  glove-box, and got out, slipping the Confederate revolver under his  trouser-band. He was pulling down his vest to cover the butt as he went  up the walk and joined his friend at the front door.    Cabot's combination library and gunroom was on the first floor. Like  Rand's own, his collection was hung on racks over low bookcases on either  side of the room. It was strictly a collector's collection, intensely  specialized. There were all but a few of the U.S. regulation single-shot  pistols, a fair representation of secondary types, most of the revolvers  of the Civil War, and all the later revolvers and automatics. In  addition, there were British pistols of the Revolution and 1812,  Confederate revolvers, a couple of Spanish revolvers of 1898, the Lugers  and Mausers and Steyers of the first World War, and the pistols of all  our allies, beginning with the French weapons of the Revolution.    \"I'm having the devil's own time filling in for this last war,\" Cabot  said. \"I have a want-ad running in the _Rifleman_, and I've gotten a few:  that Nambu, and that Japanese Model-14, and the Polish Radom, and the  Italian Glisenti, and that Tokarev, and, of course, the P-'38 and the  Canadian Browning; but it's going to take the devil's own time. I hope  nobody starts another war, for a few years, till I can get caught up on  the last one.\"    Rand was looking at the Confederate revolvers. Griswold & Grier, Haiman  Brothers, Tucker & Sherrod, Dance Brothers & Park, Spiller & Burr--there  it was: Leech & Rigdon. He tapped it on the cylinder with a finger.    \"Wasn't it one of those things that killed Lane Fleming?\" he asked.    \"Leech & Rigdon? So I'm told.\" Cabot hesitated. \"Jeff, I saw that  revolver, not four hours before Fleming was shot. Had it in my hands;  looked it over carefully.\" He shook his head. \"It absolutely was not  loaded. It was empty, and there was rust in the chambers.\"    \"Then how the hell did he get shot?\" Rand wanted to know.    \"That I couldn't say; I'm only telling you how he didn't get shot. Here,  this is how it was. It was a Thursday, and I'd come halfway out from town  before I remembered that I hadn't bought a copy of _Time_, so I stopped  at Biddle's drugstore, in the village, for one. Just as I was getting  into my car, outside, Lane Fleming drove up and saw me. He blew his horn  at me, and then waved to me with this revolver in his hand. I went over  and looked at it, and he told me he'd found it hanging back of the  counter at a barbecue-stand, where the road from Rosemont joins Route 22.  There had been some other pistols with it, and I went to see them later,  but they were all trash. The Leech & Rigdon had been the only decent  thing there, and Fleming had talked it out of this fellow for ten  dollars. He was disgustingly gleeful about it, particularly as it was  a better specimen than mine.\"    \"Would you know it, if you saw it again?\" Rand asked.    \"Yes. I remember the serials. I always look at serials on Confederate  arms. The highest known serial number for a Leech & Rigdon is 1393; this  one was 1234.\"    Rand pulled the .36 revolver from his pants-leg and gave it a quick  glance; the number was 1234. He handed it to Cabot.    \"Is this it?\" he asked.    Cabot checked the number. \"Yes. And I remember this bruise on the left  grip; Fleming was saying that he was glad it would be on the inside, so  it wouldn't show when he hung it on the wall.\" He carried the revolver to  the desk and held it under the light. \"Why, this thing wasn't fired at  all!\" he exclaimed. \"I thought that Fleming might have loaded it, meaning  to target it--he had a pistol range back of his house--but the chambers  are clean.\" He sniffed at it. \"Hoppe's Number Nine,\" he said. \"And I can  see traces of partly dissolved rust, and no traces of fouling. What the  devil, Jeff?\"    \"It probably hasn't been fired since Appomattox,\" Rand agreed. \"Philip,  do you think all this didn't-know-it-was-loaded routine might be an  elaborate suicide build-up, either before or after the fact?\"    \"Absolutely not!\" There was a trace of impatience in Cabot's voice. \"Lane  Fleming wasn't the man to commit suicide. I knew him too well ever to  believe that.\"    \"I heard a rumor that he was about to lose control of his company,\" Rand  mentioned. \"You know how much Premix meant to him.\"    \"That's idiotic!\" Cabot's voice was openly scornful, now, and he seemed  a little angry that Rand should believe such a story, as though his  confidence in his friend's intelligence had been betrayed. \"Good Lord,  Jeff, where did you ever hear a yarn like that?\"    \"Quote, usually well-informed sources, unquote.\"    \"Well, they were unusually ill-informed, that time,\" Cabot replied. \"Take  my word for it, there's absolutely nothing in it.\"    \"So it wasn't an accident, and it wasn't suicide,\" Rand considered.  \"Philip, what is the prognosis on this merger of Premix and National  Milling & Packaging, now that Lane Fleming's opposition has been, shall  we say, liquidated?\"    Cabot's head jerked up; he looked at Rand in shocked surprise.    \"My God, you don't think...?\" he began. \"Jeff, are you investigating Lane  Fleming's death?\"    \"I was retained to sell the collection,\" Rand stated. \"Now, I suppose,  I'll have to find out who's been stealing those pistols, and recover  them, and jail the thief and the fence. But I was not retained to  investigate the death of Lane Fleming. And I do not do work for which  I am not paid,\" he added, with mendacious literalness.    \"I see. Well, the merger's going through. It won't be official until the  sixteenth of May, when the Premix stockholders meet, but that's just a  formality. It's all cut and dried and in the bag now. Better let me pick  you up a little Premix; there's still some lying around. You'll make a  little less than four-for-one on it.\"    \"I'd had that in mind when I asked you about the merger,\" Rand said. \"I  have about two thousand with you, haven't I?\" He did a moment's mental  arithmetic, then got out his checkbook. \"Pick me up about a hundred  shares,\" he told the broker. \"I've been meaning to get in on this ever  since I heard about it.\"    \"I don't see how you did hear about it,\" Cabot said. \"For obvious  reasons, it's being kept pretty well under the hat.\"    Rand grinned. \"Quote, usually well-informed sources, unquote. Not the  sources mentioned above.\"    \"Jeff, you know, this damned thing's worrying me,\" Cabot told him,  writing a receipt and exchanging it for Rand's check. \"I've been trying  to ignore it, but I simply can't. Do you really think Lane Fleming was  murdered by somebody who wanted to see this merger consummated and who  knew that that was an impossibility as long as Fleming was alive?\"    \"Philip, I don't know. And furthermore, I don't give a damn,\" Rand lied.  \"If somebody wants me to look into it, and pays me my possibly  exaggerated idea of what constitutes fair compensation, I will. And I'll  probably come up with Fleming's murderer, dead or alive. But until then,  it is simply no epidermis off my scrotum. And I advise you to adopt a  similar attitude.\"    They changed the subject, then, to the variety of pistols developed and  used by the opposing nations in World War II, and the difficulties ahead  of Cabot in assembling even a fairly representative group of them. Rand  promised to mail Cabot a duplicate copy of his list of the letter-code  symbols used by the Nazis to indicate the factories manufacturing arms  for them, as well as copies of some old wartime Intelligence dope on  enemy small-arms. At a little past one, he left Cabot's home and returned  to the Fleming residence.    There were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17897"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part I-II (Pars Prima Secundae) (#15)"],[1,"e; but for the purpose of a good operation, viz. that he may  do good to them; that he may delight in seeing them do good; and  again that he may be helped by them in his good work. For in order  that man may do well, whether in the works of the active life, or in  those of the contemplative life, he needs the fellowship of friends.    But if we speak of perfect Happiness which will be in our heavenly  Fatherland, the fellowship of friends is not essential to Happiness;  since man has the entire fulness of his perfection in God. But the  fellowship of friends conduces to the well-being of Happiness. Hence  Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 25) that \"the spiritual creatures  receive no other interior aid to happiness than the eternity, truth,  and charity of the Creator. But if they can be said to be helped from  without, perhaps it is only by this that they see one another and  rejoice in God, at their fellowship.\"    Reply Obj. 1: That glory which is essential to Happiness, is that  which man has, not with man but with God.    Reply Obj. 2: This saying is to be understood of the possession of  good that does not fully satisfy. This does not apply to the question  under consideration; because man possesses in God a sufficiency of  every good.    Reply Obj. 3: Perfection of charity is essential to Happiness, as to  the love of God, but not as to the love of our neighbor. Wherefore if  there were but one soul enjoying God, it would be happy, though  having no neighbor to love. But supposing one neighbor to be there,  love of him results from perfect love of God. Consequently,  friendship is, as it were, concomitant with perfect Happiness.  ________________________    QUESTION 5    OF THE ATTAINMENT OF HAPPINESS  (In Eight Articles)    We must now consider the attainment of Happiness. Under this heading  there are eight points of inquiry:    (1) Whether man can attain Happiness?    (2) Whether one man can be happier than another?    (3) Whether any man can be happy in this life?    (4) Whether Happiness once had can be lost?    (5) Whether man can attain Happiness by means of his natural powers?    (6) Whether man attains Happiness through the action of some higher  creature?    (7) Whether any actions of man are necessary in order that man may  obtain Happiness of God?    (8) Whether every man desires Happiness?  ________________________    FIRST ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 5, Art. 1]    Whether Man Can Attain Happiness?    Objection 1: It would seem that man cannot attain happiness. For just  as the rational is above the sensible nature, so the intellectual is  above the rational, as Dionysius declares (Div. Nom. iv, vi, vii) in  several passages. But irrational animals that have the sensitive  nature only, cannot attain the end of the rational nature. Therefore  neither can man, who is of rational nature, attain the end of the  intellectual nature, which is Happiness.    Obj. 2: Further, True Happiness consists in seeing God, Who is pure  Truth. But from his very nature, man considers truth in material  things: wherefore \"he understands the intelligible species in the  phantasm\" (De Anima iii, 7). Therefore he cannot attain Happiness.    Obj. 3: Further, Happiness consists in attaining the Sovereign Good.  But we cannot arrive at the top without surmounting the middle.  Since, therefore, the angelic nature through which man cannot mount  is midway between God and human nature; it seems that he cannot  attain Happiness.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Ps. 93:12): \"Blessed is the man  whom Thou shalt instruct, O Lord.\"    _I answer that,_ Happiness is the attainment of the Perfect Good.  Whoever, therefore, is capable of the Perfect Good can attain  Happiness. Now, that man is capable of the Perfect Good, is proved  both because his intellect can apprehend the universal and perfect  good, and because his will can desire it. And therefore man can  attain Happiness. This can be proved again from the fact that man is  capable of seeing God, as stated in the First Part (Q. 12, A. 1): in  which vision, as we stated above (Q. 3, A. 8) man's perfect Happiness  consists.    Reply Obj. 1: The rational exceeds the sensitive nature, otherwise  than the intellectual surpasses the rational. For the rational  exceeds the sensitive nature in respect of the object of its  knowledge: since the senses have no knowledge whatever of the  universal, whereas the reason has knowledge thereof. But the  intellectual surpasses the rational nature, as to the mode of knowing  the same intelligible truth: for the intellectual nature grasps  forthwith the truth which the rational nature reaches by the inquiry  of reason, as was made clear in the First Part (Q. 58, A. 3; Q. 79,  A. 8). Therefore reason arrives by a kind of movement at that which  the intellect grasps. Consequently the rational nature can attain  Happiness, which is the perfection of the intellectual nature: but  otherwise than the angels. Because the angels attained it forthwith  after the beginning of their creation: whereas man attains if after a  time. But the sensitive nature can nowise attain this end.    Reply Obj. 2: To man in the present state of life the natural way of  knowing intelligible truth is by means of phantasms. But after this  state of life, he has another natural way, as was stated in the First  Part (Q. 84, A. 7; Q. 89, A. 1).    Reply Obj. 3: Man cannot surmount the angels in the degree of nature  so as to be above them naturally. But he can surmount them by an  operation of the intellect, by understanding that there is above the  angels something that makes men happy; and when he has attained it,  he will be perfectly happy.  ________________________    SECOND ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 5, Art. 2]    Whether One Man Can Be Happier Than Another?    Objection 1: It would seem that one man cannot be happier than  another. For Happiness is \"the reward of virtue,\" as the Philosopher  says (Ethic. i, 9). But equal reward is given for all the works of  virtue; because it is written (Matt. 20:10) that all who labor in the  vineyard \"received every man a penny\"; for, as Gregory says (Hom. xix  in Evang.), \"each was equally rewarded with eternal life.\" Therefore  one man cannot be happier than another.    Obj. 2: Further, Happiness is the supreme good. But nothing can  surpass the supreme. Therefore one man's Happiness cannot be  surpassed by another's.    Obj. 3: Further, since Happiness is \"the perfect and sufficient good\"  (Ethic. i, 7) it brings rest to man's desire. But his desire is not  at rest, if he yet lacks some good that can be got. And if he lack  nothing that he can get, there can be no still greater good.  Therefore either man is not happy; or, if he be happy, no other  Happiness can be greater.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (John 14:2): \"In My Father's house  there are many mansions\"; which, according to Augustine (Tract. lxvii  in Joan.) signify \"the diverse dignities of merits in the one eternal  life.\" But the dignity of eternal life which is given according to  merit, is Happiness itself. Therefore there are diverse degrees of  Happiness, and Happiness is not equally in all.    _I answer that,_ As stated above (Q. 1, A. 8; Q. 2, A. 7), Happiness  implies two things, to wit, the last end itself, i.e. the Sovereign  Good; and the attainment or enjoyment of that same Good. As to that  Good itself, Which is the object and cause of Happiness, one  Happiness cannot be greater than another, since there is but one  Sovereign Good, namely, God, by enjoying Whom, men are made happy.  But as to the attainment or enjoyment of this Good, one man can be  happier than another; because the more a man enjoys this Good the  happier he is. Now, that one man enjoys God more than another,  happens through his being better disposed or ordered to the enjoyment  of Him. And in this sense one man can be happier than another.    Reply Obj. 1: The one penny signifies that Happiness is one in its  object. But the many mansions signify the manifold Happiness in the  divers degrees of enjoyment.    Reply Obj. 2: Happiness is said to be the supreme good, inasmuch as  it is the perfect possession or enjoyment of the Supreme Good.    Reply Obj. 3: None of the Blessed lacks any desirable good;  since they have the Infinite Good Itself, Which is \"the good of all  good,\" as Augustine says (Enarr. in Ps. 134). But one is said to be  happier than another, by reason of diverse participation of the same  good. And the addition of other goods does not increase Happiness,  since Augustine says (Confess. v, 4): \"He who knows Thee, and others  besides, is not the happier for knowing them, but is happy for knowing  Thee alone.\"  ________________________    THIRD ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 5, Art. 3]    Whether One Can Be Happy in This Life?    Objection 1: It would seem that Happiness can be had in this life. For  it is written (Ps. 118:1): \"Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who  walk in the law of the Lord.\" But this happens in this life. Therefore  one can be happy in this life.    Obj. 2: Further, imperfect participation in the Sovereign Good does  not destroy the nature of Happiness, otherwise one would not be  happier than another. But men can participate in the Sovereign Good  in this life, by knowing and loving God, albeit imperfectly.  Therefore man can be happy in this life.    Obj. 3: Further, what is said by many cannot be altogether false:  since what is in many, comes, apparently, from nature; and nature  does not fail altogether. Now many say that Happiness can be had in  this life, as appears from Ps. 143:15: \"They have called the people  happy that hath these things,\" to wit, the good things in this life.  Therefore one can be happy in this life.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Job 14:1): \"Man born of a woman,  living for a short time, is filled with many miseries.\" But Happiness  excludes misery. Therefore man cannot be happy in this life.    _I answer that,_ A certain"]]]
