Either the eaglehawk-crow myths were told before the phratry names came  into existence, or they were invented to explain the existence of the  phratry names. Let us assume that none of the unknown names mean  eaglehawk or crow, and that the eaglehawk-crow area has remained  approximately the same size, or has, at any rate, not diminished  (excluding, of course, those cases where it seems to have lost ground  owing to the disappearance of phratry names altogether, as among the  Kurnai); we must then, on the second theory, assume that the story of  the combat spread to tribes with completely different phratry names like  the Urabunna, and got mixed up with their ceremonies of initiation (the  most sacred part of the mythology of the Australian natives, and one not  likely to be much influenced by chance intruders); and that it came even  in some cases to be told of Baiame, the creator and institutor of the  rites of initiation, who is represented as himself taking part in the  conflict and gaining a victory over the foes of mankind[104]. On the  whole, therefore, this view of the case appears improbable.    To the theory that the Eaglehawk-Crow story was originally independent  of the phratry names no such objections apply. We are indefinitely  remote from the period at which the anthropologist will be able to do  for Australia what Franz Boas has done for the North-West of  America--draw up a table showing the resemblances and differences  between the stock of folktales of the different tribes, or, which is  more important for our present purpose, of the main divisions, eastern,  central, and western, which the analysis of initiation ceremonies gives  us--a tripartite division which Curr also makes on the linguistic side,  though Mathew's map shows considerable intermixture in this respect.  Until we know to what extent the Urabunna or the Ikula have folktales in  common with the Victorian area, or,--which is perhaps more important,  though we do not seem to hear of any communication on this line,--how  far there is a stock of folktales common to the Darling district and the  central area, it is obviously idle to speculate as to how it comes that  an Eaglehawk myth is told in both areas. The physical anthropology of  the Australian natives is at present a little-worked field, in which,  singularly enough, the French have done more than the English, to our  shame be it said. Possibly a somatological survey might disclose to what  extent the central tribes are distinct from the eastern group, and how  far we may assume movements of population, subsequent to the original  peopling of the country by the stocks in question, in either or both  directions. In the absence of such data, and until an Australian Grimm  has arisen to bring order into the present linguistic chaos, the  evidence from folktales seems to promise most light on the question of  migrations.    We are, of course, confronted by the difficulty that this evidence may  simply disclose the lines along which tribal intercommunication has been  most easy, whether in the way of simple interchange of commodities,  evidence of which we have over considerable areas in Australia, or in  the way of intermarriage, which, as we see by the example of the  Urabunna and the Arunta, is found in spite of fundamental differences of  tribal organisation. A common stock of folktales due to this cause would  leave unexplained the prominence of the bird myth in the sacred rites,  and leave the present hypothesis, in this regard, on a par with that of  post-phratriac dissemination, in respect of probability. On the other  hand we have the Scylla of tribal property in land, an idea so firmly  rooted in our own day in the minds of the Australians as to make wars of  conquest unthinkable to them, and to transform the practical part of  their intertribal feuds into mere raids. If, therefore, investigation  showed that the central and eastern tribes are in possession of a stock  of folktales with many items in common, we should always have to take  into consideration the possibility that these tales antedate the  complete occupation of Australia, and go back to a period when the  eastern and central divisions were in close relation. The probability of  this view would, of course, depend on the extent of the resemblance  between the two stocks of tales, or, perhaps, rather on the extent of  the resemblance between those tales which they have in common; for it is  clear that a close resemblance between comparatively few items would be  more effective proof of intercommunication than a less marked general  resemblance between the tale-stocks as a whole.    In spite of the deficiencies of our evidence we may perhaps incline to  the view that the bird myth dates back to a very early period. Until it  has been shown that intrusive elements are not only taken up into the  tribal stock of tales, but also incorporated in the more sacred portion  of those tales, which are told at the tribal mysteries, it will always  remain more probable that the myth belongs to the two divisions as a  result of lineal and not lateral transmission. If this is so the  differences between the initiation ceremonies, no less than the  anthropomorphic form of the myth in the eastern division, as compared  with the purely theriomorphic story of the central division and the  mixed form of the Ikula, will enable us to say that the period when the  separation of the divisions took place must be very remote.    There is, therefore, no inherent improbability in supposing that the  bird myth was told before the phratry names were invented or adopted,  and that the latter were in some cases taken from the principal  characters in the myth. This conclusion is supported by the fact that  the phratry names seem to be subsequent to the present grouping, if we  may take as our guide the fact that the frontiers of the phratry names  correspond with the boundaries between the central and eastern  divisions. The fact that there is a cross division, if we base our  reasoning on the class organisation, need not of course be taken into  account, for we have every reason to believe that the classes are  subsequent to the phratries.    In favour of the derivation of the phratry names from the myth tells  also the five-fold division of the eaglehawk-crow groups into Muquara  and Kilpara, Bunjil and Waa, Merung and Yuckembruk, Multa or Malian and  Umbe. For it is clearly more probable that the names should have been  taken from a common object than that they should have been in their  origin identical in form and subsequently differentiated, as the  languages changed; we have in fact direct evidence of a tendency to  preserve the old names, which we may perhaps regard as the sacred names,  after the bird has been rebaptised in the terminology of daily life.  Over and above this we have of course the fact that the sacred language  has, generally speaking, both in Australia and elsewhere, this  unchanging character. But this simple name-borrowing theory, it is  clear, is equally valid as an explanation of the facts.    Although we cannot determine the meaning of the names the quadripartite  division of the Mallera-Wuthera[105] and allied phratries in the north is  evidence of a similar tendency. It is by no means impossible that  Mallera, Yungaroo, and Pakoota all mean the same thing. (This ignorance  of the meaning of the phratry and class names is _prima facie_ evidence  of their high antiquity.) In the newly-discovered phratry names of the  eight-class tribes we have yet another instance of tripartite division.  If we may assume that Illitchi, Uluuru, and Wiliuku are from the same  root (which, as we have seen, is probably _welu_, the terminations  _-uku_, _-itchi_, and _-uru_ (=_-aree_) being formative suffixes), we  have here too a single phratry name on the one side and three sister  names on the other. While it is clear that the names cannot be in any  sense of the term recent, from the fact that linguistic differentiation  had already gone some distance in what we may call, for want of a better  term, groups speaking a stock language (in proof of which we have only  to look at the formative suffixes), it seems equally clear that the  present phratry names must be considerably later than the final  settlement of the country. At the same time it must not be forgotten  that the existence of numerous small phratries, the number of which may  yet be largely increased by more exact research, is _prima facie_ a  proof that the groups which adopted them had not reached the stage at  which anything like that tribal (still less national) organisation was  known, which is at the present day characteristic of the Arunta, and,  perhaps, we may say, of all groups organised on a class system with  class names known and used over an area far beyond that over which the  (in a restricted sense) tribal language extends.    The recurrence of crow in the phratry name of the far west lends further  support to the view that the phratry names were selected in some way,  and were not due to some accident of savage wit. The view has been taken  that the phratry animals were originally totems, or animals that became  totems at a later stage. In view of the large number of totems found in  many tribes, or even restricting their number to six or eight in each  phratry, it is not difficult to estimate the probability that cockatoo  and crow would recur in different areas, and that an opposition of  characters should be found in other cases. The hypothesis needs at any  rate to be combined with a theory, firstly, of borrowing of phratry  names, a process which must indeed have played a large part in the  development of the present system, but which does not necessarily  involve the supposition that the borrowed names replaced previously  existing home-made names;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17408"],[0,"The Florentine Painters of the Renaissance (#15)"],[1," (U.
