The war can't last very  long. England is mighty--but I wish the bloomin' capitalists would  come and do the fighting, if they want this country and its  gold-mines.\"    \"There are only a 'few marauding bands' left, so the English say,\"  Hansie answered bitterly. \"But remember what I tell you now. South  Africa will be soaked in blood and tears, and a hundred thousand  hearts will be broken here and in your country, before the mighty  British Army has subdued those 'few marauding bands.'\"    The soldier's face grew troubled once again.    It was a good, strong face--a patient face--and it bore the marks of  much suffering, endured in silence and alone.    He rose and took off his cap.    \"You've been very good to me, miss. I wish I could be of some use to  you.\"    \"Run away from Lord Kitchener!\" she said, laughing. \"I would be very  sorry indeed if you fell by the hand of one of my brothers.\"    He looked at her sympathetically.    \"How many brothers have you in the field?\"    \"God only knows,\" she answered sadly. \"There were two left when last  we heard of them. The third has been made a prisoner.\"    The soldier took his leave and Hansie lost herself in reverie.    And when at last she roused herself, she wrote with rapid pen:    \"Two Tommies have been in our garden, catching butterflies----\" We  know the rest.           *       *       *       *       *    That afternoon about ten or twelve young people assembled in the  garden and were later joined by several members of the Diplomatic  Corps--Consul Cinatti, Consul Aubert, and Consul Nieuwenhuis, the most  frequent visitors at Harmony.    _The_ topic of conversation was connected with General Botha's visit  to Lord Kitchener in Middelburg, and when Hansie told her friends what  she had heard from the soldier that morning, they expressed their  conviction that every word he said must have been true.    And the latest _official_ war news, in rhyme, the dispatch from  Kitchener to the Secretary of State for War, came in for its share of  attention, occasioning no small amount of merriment.    Oh, happy afternoon! Oh, memories sweet! Oh, long departed days of  good fellowship and mutual understanding! Bright spots of gold and  crimson in our sky of lead!           *       *       *       *       *    Mrs. van Warmelo never at any time encouraged evening visitors. They  were all early risers at Harmony and their life could not be adapted  to the artificial, the unnatural strain of modern civilisation.    So the quiet evenings were spent by the mother in reading and writing,  while the daughter gave herself up to the indulgence of her one great  passion, music. Scales and exercises, Schubert and Chopin, and  invariably at the end--before retiring for the night--Beethoven, the  Master, the King of Music.          CHAPTER XI    PRISONER OF WAR      How the routine of life at Harmony was broken in upon by news \"from  the front\" that April month in 1901, I shall endeavour to relate.    Hansie coming home one morning from a shopping expedition, found her  mother in a state of suppressed excitement.    Everything was as much as possible \"suppressed\" in those  days--goodness only knows why, for surely it would have been better  for the nervous and highly strung mind if an occasional outburst could  have been permitted. Hansie suffered from the same complaint, and had  to pay most dearly in after years for the suppression of her deepest  feelings.    There is a Dutch saying which forcibly expresses that condition of  tense self-control under circumstances of a particularly trying  nature. We say we are \"living on our nerves,\" and that describes the  case better than anything I have ever heard.    Our heroines, like so many other sorely tried women in South Africa,  were \"living on their nerves,\" those wise, understanding nerves, so  knowing and so delicate, which form the stronghold of the human frame.    The external symptoms of this state were only known by those who  lived in close and constant intercourse with one another. Hansie  therefore knew, by an inflection in her mother's voice, that something  out of the way had happened when she said:    \"I have had a note from General Maxwell.\"    \"Indeed! What does he say?\"    \"He writes that Dietlof has been made a prisoner, and he encloses a  telegram from the Assistant Provost-Marshal at Ventersdorp, in the  name of General Babington, to say that Dietlof is well, as was Fritz  when last seen. See for yourself.\"    Hansie grabbed--yes, grabbed--the papers from her mother's  outstretched hand.    \"'When last seen?' Mother, what can that mean? Why have the boys been  separated?\"    \"That is what I should like to know,\" her mother answered. \"I wonder  how we can find out. We must ask to see General Maxwell at once.\"    That afternoon the two women called at the Government Buildings and  were shown into the Governor's office.    He seemed to be expecting a visit from them, and Mrs. van Warmelo  apologised for troubling him, reminding him of the promise he had made  on the occasion of their very first visit to him, that he would help  them if they came to him in any trouble.    This he remembered perfectly.    \"What is it you want me to do?\" he asked.    \"If you will be so good, we want a permit to visit our prisoner in the  Johannesburg Fort, where he will probably be kept until he is sent to  Ceylon or where-ever he may have to go.\"    \"Certainly; I will do this with the greatest pleasure. But first we  must wire and find out his whereabouts. I'll see about the matter and  let you know at once.\"    Thanking him gratefully, mother and daughter took their leave.    \"We should have asked permission to take a box of clothes and other  little necessaries for our boy,\" the mother said.    \"Yes, what a pity we did not think of it! But surely there could be no  objection to that! Let us get everything ready at least, and ask  permission when we hear from General Maxwell again.\"    The largest portmanteau in the house was overhauled and carefully and  thoughtfully packed by the mother's yearning hands.    No article of comfort was overlooked, no detail of the wardrobe  considered too small for her closest attention and care.    Presently Hansie came with _her_ contribution, a thick exercise-book  and a couple of pencils.    \"Put these in, mother, if you still have room. I am going to ask  Dietlof to write down all his adventures in this book for us to read  afterwards. It will help him to get through his time of imprisonment.\"    (This small act, I may add here, led to the publication of her  brother's book, _Mijn Kommando en Guerilla-Kommando leven--On  Commando_, in the English edition--which was begun in Ladysmith and  written in the Indian Fort at Ahmednagar and smuggled out to Holland  under conditions of such romantic interest: the first book on the war,  written _during_ the war and devoured by the public in Holland long  before it was allowed to reach South African shores--a book famed for  its moderation and its truth, direct, sincere throughout.)           *       *       *       *       *    That Saturday night poor Mrs. van Warmelo never closed her eyes. She  feared, and she had good reason to fear, that her son would pass  through Johannesburg, and be transported to some foreign isle, before  a word of greeting and farewell could be made by her. The thought of  the morrow's Sabbath rest and inactivity intensified her fears.    The first thing she said to Hansie next morning was:    \"You must go to General Maxwell and ask whether there is no news for  us.\"    \"But, mother, this is Sunday!\"    \"I know that. You will have to go to his house.\"    \"Oh, I could not possibly do that. What does he care about our  anxieties? Besides, I think it would be most indiscreet.\"    \"I don't care,\" shortly.    In the end Hansie had to go, and when once she had made up her mind  she looked forward with some pleasure to her little adventure, for  there was no one of the officials known to her for whom she had a more  sincere regard than General Maxwell. His house was but a few minutes'  walk from Harmony, and Hansie, looking up at the gathering clouds,  hoped that she could be home again before the approaching storm broke  loose.    Our \"brave\" heroine _trembled_ when she rang the bell, for all her  distaste of the task had returned with redoubled force, but her  self-confidence was soon restored under the genial warmth of the  General's greetings.    He did not seem to be the least annoyed or displeased at this  intrusion on his Sabbath privacy. And he was quite alone--not, as  Hansie had feared to find him, surrounded by a crowd of officers.    He told her that though he had not been able to get news of her  brother direct, he knew that a large number of prisoners had arrived  at the Johannesburg Fort from Ventersdorp. He thought her brother  would probably be amongst them, and gave her special permits to  Johannesburg and back, and also a letter of introduction to the  Military Governor in Johannesburg, asking him as a personal favour to  assist the ladies in their quest.    \"If I were you, I would not wait for definite news, but go to-morrow  on the chance of finding him. Delay might bring you great  disappointment. But, tell me, Miss van Warmelo, are you not glad that  your brother has been captured and is out of danger now?\"    \"Glad? No, how can I be glad? It means a man less on our side--and _he  is a man_, I can assure you. If all the Boers were as brave and  true--and such unerring marksmen--the war would soon be over.\"    The Governor looked disturbed.    \"It seems to me a strange thing for a girl like you to feel so  strongly. Are all your women such staunch patriots?\"    \"Not all, perhaps, but there are many who feel even more strongly than  I do.\"    The General kept"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/202"],[0,"My Bondage and My Freedom (#15)"],[1," bitter curses, mingled with threats, that \"he would  teach the d--d b--h how to give a white man impudence.\" There is no  doubt that Nelly felt herself superior, in some respects, to the slaves  around her. She was a wife and a mother; her husband was a valued and  favorite slave. Besides, he was one of the first hands on board of the  sloop, and the sloop hands--since they had to represent the plantation  abroad--were generally treated tenderly. The overseer never was allowed  to whip Harry; why then should he be allowed to whip Harry's wife?  Thoughts of this kind, no doubt, influenced her; but, for whatever  reason, she nobly resisted, and, unlike most of the slaves,{73 COMBAT  BETWEEN MR. SEVIER AND NELLY} seemed determined to make her whipping  cost Mr. Sevier as much as possible. The blood on his (and her) face,  attested her skill, as well as her courage and dexterity in using her  nails. Maddened by her resistance, I expected to see Mr. Sevier  level her to the ground by a stunning blow; but no; like a savage  bull-dog--which he resembled both in temper and appearance--he  maintained his grip, and steadily dragged his victim toward the tree,  disregarding alike her blows, and the cries of the children for their  mother's release. He would, doubtless, have knocked her down with his  hickory stick, but that such act might have cost him his place. It is  often deemed advisable to knock a _man_ slave down, in order to tie him,  but it is considered cowardly and inexcusable, in an overseer, thus to  deal with a _woman_. He is expected to tie her up, and to give her what  is called, in southern parlance, a \"genteel flogging,\" without any very  great outlay of strength or skill. I watched, with palpitating interest,  the course of the preliminary struggle, and was saddened by every new  advantage gained over her by the ruffian. There were times when she  seemed likely to get the better of the brute, but he finally overpowered  her, and succeeded in getting his rope around her arms, and in firmly  tying her to the tree, at which he had been aiming. This done, and Nelly  was at the mercy of his merciless lash; and now, what followed, I have  no heart to describe. The cowardly creature made good his every threat;  and wielded the lash with all the hot zest of furious revenge. The cries  of the woman, while undergoing the terrible infliction, were mingled  with those of the children, sounds which I hope the reader may never be  called upon to hear. When Nelly was untied, her back was covered  with blood. The red stripes were all over her shoulders. She was  whipped--severely whipped; but she was not subdued, for she continued to  denounce the overseer, and to call him every vile name. He had bruised  her flesh, but had left her invincible spirit undaunted. Such floggings  are seldom repeated by the same overseer. They prefer to whip those{74}  who are most easily whipped. The old doctrine that submission is the  very best cure for outrage and wrong, does not hold good on the slave  plantation. He is whipped oftenest, who is whipped easiest; and that  slave who has the courage to stand up for himself against the overseer,  although he may have many hard stripes at the first, becomes, in the  end, a freeman, even though he sustain the formal relation of a slave.  \"You can shoot me but you can't whip me,\" said a slave to Rigby Hopkins;  and the result was that he was neither whipped nor shot. If the latter  had been his fate, it would have been less deplorable than the living  and lingering death to which cowardly and slavish souls are subjected.  I do not know that Mr. Sevier ever undertook to whip Nelly again. He  probably never did, for it was not long after his attempt to subdue her,  that he was taken sick, and died. The wretched man died as he had lived,  unrepentant; and it was said--with how much truth I know not--that in  the very last hours of his life, his ruling passion showed itself,  and that when wrestling with death, he was uttering horrid oaths, and  flourishing the cowskin, as though he was tearing the flesh off some  helpless slave. One thing is certain, that when he was in health, it was  enough to chill the blood, and to stiffen the hair of an ordinary man,  to hear Mr. Sevier talk. Nature, or his cruel habits, had given to  his face an expression of unusual savageness, even for a slave-driver.  Tobacco and rage had worn his teeth short, and nearly every sentence  that escaped their compressed grating, was commenced or concluded with  some outburst of profanity. His presence made the field alike the field  of blood, and of blasphemy. Hated for his cruelty, despised for his  cowardice, his death was deplored by no one outside his own house--if  indeed it was deplored there; it was regarded by the slaves as a  merciful interposition of Providence. Never went there a man to the  grave loaded with heavier curses. Mr. Sevier's place was promptly taken  by a Mr. Hopkins, and the change was quite a relief, he being a very  different man. He was, in{75} all respects, a better man than his  predecessor; as good as any man can be, and yet be an overseer. His  course was characterized by no extraordinary cruelty; and when he  whipped a slave, as he sometimes did, he seemed to take no especial  pleasure in it, but, on the contrary, acted as though he felt it to be  a mean business. Mr. Hopkins stayed but a short time; his place much  to the regret of the slaves generally--was taken by a Mr. Gore, of whom  more will be said hereafter. It is enough, for the present, to say, that  he was no improvement on Mr. Sevier, except that he was less noisy and  less profane.    I have already referred to the business-like aspect of Col. Lloyd's  plantation. This business-like appearance was much increased on the two  days at the end of each month, when the slaves from the different farms  came to get their monthly allowance of meal and meat. These were gala  days for the slaves, and there was much rivalry among them as to _who_  should be elected to go up to the great house farm for the allowance,  and, indeed, to attend to any business at this (for them) the capital.  The beauty and grandeur of the place, its numerous slave population,  and the fact that Harry, Peter and Jake the sailors of the sloop--almost  always kept, privately, little trinkets which they bought at Baltimore,  to sell, made it a privilege to come to the great house farm. Being  selected, too, for this office, was deemed a high honor. It was taken as  a proof of confidence and favor; but, probably, the chief motive of the  competitors for the place, was, a desire to break the dull monotony of  the field, and to get beyond the overseer's eye and lash. Once on the  road with an ox team, and seated on the tongue of his cart, with no  overseer to look after him, the slave was comparatively free; and, if  thoughtful, he had time to think. Slaves are generally expected to sing  as well as to work. A silent slave is not liked by masters or overseers.  _\"Make a noise,\" \"make a noise,\"_ and _\"bear a hand,\"_ are the words  usually addressed to the slaves when there is silence amongst them. This  may account for the almost constant singing{76} heard in the southern  states. There was, generally, more or less singing among the teamsters,  as it was one means of letting the overseer know where they were, and  that they were moving on with the work. But, on allowance day, those who  visited the great house farm were peculiarly excited and noisy. While  on their way, they would make the dense old woods, for miles around,  reverberate with their wild notes. These were not always merry because  they were wild. On the contrary, they were mostly of a plaintive cast,  and told a tale of grief and sorrow. In the most boisterous outbursts of  rapturous sentiment, there was ever a tinge of deep melancholy. I have  never heard any songs like those anywhere since I left slavery, except  when in Ireland. There I heard the same _wailing notes_, and was much  affected by them. It was during the famine of 1845-6. In all the songs  of the slaves, there was ever some expression in praise of the great  house farm; something which would flatter the pride of the owner, and,  possibly, draw a favorable glance from him.                _I am going away to the great house farm,              O yea!  O yea!  O yea!              My old master is a good old master,              O yea!  O yea!  O yea!_      This they would sing, with other words of their own improvising--jargon  to others, but full of meaning to themselves. I have sometimes thought,  that the mere hearing of those songs would do more to impress truly  spiritual-minded men and women with the soul-crushing and death-dealing  character of slavery, than the reading of whole volumes of its mere  physical cruelties. They speak to the heart and to the soul of the  thoughtful. I cannot better express my sense of them now, than ten years  ago, when, in sketching my life, I thus spoke of this feature of my  plantation experience:      I did not, when a slave, understand the deep meanings of those rude, and  apparently incoherent songs. I was myself within the circle, so that I  neither saw or heard as those without might see and hear. They told a  tale which was{77} then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they  were tones, loud, long and deep, breathing the prayer and complaint  of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. Every tone was a  testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from  chains. The hearing of those wild notes always depressed my spirits, and  filled my heart with ineffable sadness. The mere recurrence, even now,  afflicts my spirit, and while I am writing these lines, my tears are  falling. To those songs I trace my first glimmering conceptions of  the dehumanizing character of slavery. I can never get rid of that  conception. Those songs still follow me, to deepen my hatred of"]]]
