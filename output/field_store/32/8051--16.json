Art, we shall show later, is profoundly connected with life;  it is nowise superfluous. But, for all that, art, both its creation and  its enjoyment, is unpractical. Thanks be to God, life is not limited to  the practical.    When we say art is unpractical, we mean that art is _cut loose from  immediate action_. Take a simple instance. A man--or perhaps still  better a child--sees a plate of cherries. Through his senses comes the  stimulus of the smell of the cherries, and their bright colour urging  him, luring him to eat. He eats and is satisfied; the cycle of normal  behaviour is complete; he is a man or a child of action, but he is no  artist, and no art-lover. Another man looks at the same plate of  cherries. His sight and his smell lure him and urge him to eat. He does  _not_ eat; the cycle is not completed, and, because he does not eat, the  sight of those cherries, though perhaps not the smell, is altered,  purified from desire, and in some way intensified, enlarged. If he is  just a man of taste, he will take what we call an \"aesthetic\" pleasure in  those cherries. If he is an actual artist, he will paint not the  cherries, but his vision of them, his purified emotion towards them. He  has, so to speak, come out from the chorus of actors, of cherry-eaters,  and become a spectator.    I borrow, by his kind permission, a beautiful instance of what he well  calls \"Psychical Distance\" from the writings of a psychologist.[36]    \"Imagine a fog at sea: for most people it is an experience of acute  unpleasantness. Apart from the physical annoyance and remoter forms of  discomfort, such as delays, it is apt to produce feelings of peculiar  anxiety, fears of invisible dangers, strains of watching and listening  for distant and unlocalized signals. The listless movements of the ship  and her warning calls soon tell upon the nerves of the passengers; and  that special, expectant tacit anxiety and nervousness, always associated  with this experience, make a fog the dreaded terror of the sea (all the  more terrifying because of its very silence and gentleness) for the  expert seafarer no less than the ignorant landsman.    \"Nevertheless, a fog at sea can be a source of intense relish and  enjoyment. Abstract from the experience of the sea-fog, for the moment,  its danger and practical unpleasantness; ... direct the attention to the  features 'objectively' constituting the phenomena--the veil surrounding  you with an opaqueness as of transparent milk, blurring the outlines of  things and distorting their shapes into weird grotesqueness; observe the  carrying power of the air, producing the impression as if you could  touch some far-off siren by merely putting out your hand and letting it  lose itself behind that white wall; note the curious creamy smoothness  of the water, hypercritically denying as it were, any suggestion of  danger; and, above all, the strange solitude and remoteness from the  world, as it can be found only on the highest mountain tops; and the  experience may acquire, in its uncanny mingling of repose and terror, a  flavour of such concentrated poignancy and delight as to contrast  sharply with the blind and distempered anxiety of its other aspects.  This contrast, often emerging with startling suddenness, is like the  momentary switching on of some new current, or the passing ray of a  brighter light, illuminating the outlook upon perhaps the most ordinary  and familiar objects--an impression which we experience sometimes in  instants of direst extremity, when our practical interest snaps like a  wire from sheer over-tension, and we watch the consummation of some  impending catastrophe with the marvelling unconcern of a mere  spectator.\"           *       *       *       *       *    It has often been noted that two, and two only, of our senses are the  channels of art and give us artistic material. These two senses are  sight and hearing. Touch and its special modifications, taste and smell,  do not go to the making of art. Decadent French novelists, such as  Huysmann, make their heroes revel in perfume-symphonies, but we feel  that the sentiment described is morbid and unreal, and we feel rightly.  Some people speak of a cook as an \"artist,\" and a pudding as a \"perfect  poem,\" but a healthy instinct rebels. Art, whether sculpture, painting,  drama, music, is of sight or hearing. The reason is simple. Sight and  hearing are the distant senses; sight is, as some one has well said,  \"touch at a distance.\" Sight and hearing are of things already detached  and somewhat remote; they are the fitting channels for art which is cut  loose from immediate action and reaction. Taste and touch are too  intimate, too immediately vital. In Russian, as Tolstoi has pointed out  (and indeed in other languages the same is observable), the word for  beauty (_krasota_) means, to begin with, only that which pleases the  sight. Even hearing is excluded. And though latterly people have begun  to speak of an \"ugly deed\" or of \"beautiful music,\" it is not good  Russian. The simple Russian does not make Plato's divine muddle between  the good and the beautiful. If a man gives his coat to another, the  Russian peasant, knowing no foreign language, will not say the man has  acted \"beautifully.\"    To see a thing, to feel a thing, as a work of art, we must, then, become  for the time unpractical, must be loosed from the fear and the flurry of  actual living, must become spectators. Why is this? Why can we not live  and look at once? The _fact_ that we cannot is clear. If we watch a  friend drowning we do not note the exquisite curve made by his body as  he falls into the water, nor the play of the sunlight on the ripples as  he disappears below the surface; we should be inhuman, aesthetic fiends  if we did. And again, why? It would do our friend no harm that we should  enjoy the curves and the sunlight, provided we also threw him a rope.  But the simple fact is that we _cannot_ look at the curves and the  sunlight because our whole being is centred on acting, on saving him; we  cannot even, at the moment, fully feel our own terror and impending  loss. So again if we want to see and to feel the splendour and vigour of  a lion, or even to watch the cumbrous grace of a bear, we prefer that a  cage should intervene. The cage cuts off the need for motor actions; it  interposes the needful physical and moral distance, and we are free for  contemplation. Released from our own terrors, we see more and better,  and we feel differently. A man intent on action is like a horse in  blinkers, he goes straight forward, seeing only the road ahead.    Our brain is, indeed, it would seem, in part, an elaborate arrangement  for providing these blinkers. If we saw and realized the whole of  everything, we should want to do too many things. The brain allows us  not only to remember, but, which is quite as important, to forget and  neglect; it is an organ of oblivion. By neglecting most of the things we  see and hear, we can focus just on those which are important for action;  we can cease to be potential artists and become efficient practical  human beings; but it is only by limiting our view, by a great  renunciation as to the things we see and feel. The artist does just the  reverse. He renounces doing in order to practise seeing. He is by nature  what Professor Bergson calls \"distrait,\" aloof, absent-minded, intent  only, or mainly, on contemplation. That is why the ordinary man often  thinks the artist a fool, or, if he does not go so far as that, is made  vaguely uncomfortable by him, never really understands him. The artist's  focus, all his system of values, is different, his world is a world of  images which are his realities.           *       *       *       *       *    The distinction between art and ritual, which has so long haunted and  puzzled us, now comes out quite clearly, and also in part the relation  of each to actual life. Ritual, we saw, was a re-presentation or a  pre-presentation, a re-doing or pre-doing, a copy or imitation of life,  but,--and this is the important point,--always with a practical end. Art  is also a representation of life and the emotions of life, but cut loose  from immediate action. Action may be and often is represented, but it is  not that it may lead on to a practical further end. The end of art is in  itself. Its value is not mediate but _im_mediate. Thus ritual _makes, as  it were, a bridge between real life and art_, a bridge over which in  primitive times it would seem man must pass. In his actual life he hunts  and fishes and ploughs and sows, being utterly intent on the practical  end of gaining his food; in the _dromenon_ of the Spring Festival,  though his _acts_ are unpractical, being mere singing and dancing and  mimicry, his _intent_ is practical, to induce the return of his  food-supply. In the drama the representation may remain for a time the  same, but the intent is altered: man has come out from action, he is  separate from the dancers, and has become a spectator. The drama is an  end in itself.           *       *       *       *       *    We know from tradition that in Athens ritual became art, a _dromenon_  became the drama, and we have seen that the shift is symbolized and  expressed by the addition of the _theatre_, or spectator-place, to the  orchestra, or dancing-place. We have also tried to analyse the meaning  of the shift. It remains to ask what was its cause. Ritual does not  always develop into art, though in all probability dramatic art has  always to go through the stage of ritual. The leap from real life to the  emotional contemplation of life cut loose from action would otherwise be  too wide. Nature abhors a leap, she prefers to crawl over the ritual  bridge. There seem at Athens to have been two main "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17132"],[0,"The Makers of Canada: Champlain (#15)"],[1,"cabins, varied at times by  war. When they were free from these occupations, they visited other  tribes with whom they were acquainted for the purpose of traffic or  exchange, and their return was celebrated by dances and festivities.    They had a certain form of marriage which Champlain thus describes. When  a girl had reached the age of eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen or  fifteen years, she had suitors, more or less, according to her  attractions, who wooed her for some time. The consent of the parents was  then asked, to whose wills the girl did not always submit, although the  most discreet of them did so. The favoured lover or suitor then  presented to the girl some necklaces, bracelets or chains of porcelain,  which she accepted if the suitor was agreeable to her. The suitor then  resided with her for three or four days, without saying anything to her  in the meantime, but if they did not agree, the girl left her suitor,  who forfeited his necklaces and the other presents which he had made,  and each was free to seek another companion if so disposed. This term of  probation was often extended to eight, or even to fifteen days.    The children enjoyed great freedom. The parents indulged them too much  and never punished or corrected them. As a consequence they grew up bad  and vicious. They would often strike their mothers, and when they were  powerful enough they did not hesitate to strike their fathers.    The Hurons did not recognize any divine power or worship of God. They  were without belief, and lived like brute beasts, with this exception,  that they had a sort of fear of an evil spirit. They had _ogni_ or  _manitous_, who were medicine-men, and who healed the sick, bound up the  wounded, foretold future events, and practised all the abuses and  illusions of the black arts.    Champlain firmly believed that the conversion of the Hurons to  Christianity would have been easier if the country had been inhabited by  persons who would devote their energies to instructing them. Father Le  Caron and himself had often conversed with them regarding the Catholic  faith, the laws and customs of the French, and they had listened  attentively, sometimes saying:    \"You say things that pass our knowledge, and which we cannot understand  by words, being beyond our comprehension; but if you would do us a  service, come and dwell in this country, bringing your wives and  children, and when they are here, we shall see how you serve the God you  worship, and how you live with your wives and children, how you  cultivate and plant the soil, how you obey your laws, how you take care  of animals, and how you manufacture all that we see proceeding from your  inventive skill. When we see all this we shall learn more in a year than  in twenty by simply hearing your discourse; and if we cannot understand,  you shall take our children, who shall be as your own. And thus being  convinced that our life is a miserable one in comparison with yours, it  is easy to believe that we shall adopt yours, abandoning our own.\"    The following was their mode of government. The older and leading men  assembled in a council, in which they settled upon and proposed all that  was necessary for the affairs of the village. This was done by a  plurality of voices, or in accordance with the advice of some one among  them whose judgment they considered superior; such a one was requested  by the company to give his opinion on the propositions that had been  made, and his opinion was minutely obeyed. They had no particular chief  with absolute command, but they honoured the older and more courageous  men, of which there were several in a village, whom they named captains,  as a mark of distinction and respect.    They all deliberated in common, and whenever any member of the assembly  offered to do anything for the welfare of the village, or to go anywhere  for the service of the community, he was requested to present himself,  and if he was judged capable of carrying out what he proposed, they  exhorted him, by fair and favourable words, to do his duty. They  declared him to be an energetic man, fit for the undertaking, and  assured him that he would win honour in accomplishing his task. In a  word, they encouraged him by flatteries, in order that this favourable  disposition of his for the welfare of his fellow-citizens might continue  and increase. Then, according to his pleasure, he accepted or refused  the responsibility, and thereby he was held in high esteem.    They had, moreover, general assemblies with representatives from remote  regions. These representatives came every year, one from each province,  and met in a town designated as the rendezvous of the assembly. Here  were celebrated great banquets and dances, for three weeks or a month,  according as they might determine. On these occasions they renewed  their friendship, resolved upon and decreed what they thought best for  the preservation of their country against their enemies, and made each  other handsome presents, after which they retired to their own  districts.    In burying the dead, the Hurons took the body of the deceased, wrapped  it in furs, and covered it very carefully with the bark of trees. Then  they placed it in a cabin, of the length of the body, made of bark and  erected upon four posts. Others they placed in the ground, propping up  the earth on all sides that it might not fall on the body, which they  covered with the bark of trees, putting earth on top. Over this trench  they also made a little cabin. The bodies remained thus buried for a  period of eight or ten years. Then they held a general council, to which  all the people of the country were invited, for the purpose of  determining upon some place for the holding of a great festival. After  this they returned each to his own village, where they took all the  bones of the deceased, stripped them and made them quite clean. These  they kept very carefully, although the odour arising therefrom was  noxious. Then all the relatives and friends of the deceased took these  bones, together with their necklaces, furs, axes, kettles, and other  things highly valued, and carried them, with a quantity of edibles, to  the place assigned. Here, when all had assembled, they put the edibles  in a place designated by the men of the village, and engaged in banquets  and continual dancing. The festival lasted for the space of ten days,  during which other tribes from all quarters came to witness the  ceremonies. The latter were attended with great outlays.    These details on the manners and customs of the Hurons are quoted nearly  _verbatim_ from Champlain's Relations, so they must be considered as  accurate.[17]    FOOTNOTES:    [17] This volume contains the following title: _Voyages et  Descouvertures faites en la Nouvelle France depuis l'annee 1615, jusques  a la fin de l'annee 1618. Par le Sieur de Champlain, Capitaine ordinaire  pour le Roy en la Mer du Ponant. Seconde Edition, MDCXIX_. This original  edition bears the date of 1619, and the second edition is dated 1627.          CHAPTER VI    WAR AGAINST THE IROQUOIS, 1615      Champlain had promised for some years to assist the Hurons in their wars  against the Iroquois, and he found that the present time was opportune  for him to fulfil his pledge. He had visited every Huron tribe, and he  was aware that a general rendezvous had been fixed at Cahiague. On  August 14th, 1615, ten Frenchmen, under the command of Champlain,  started from Carhagouha. On their way they stopped at the villages of  the Tohontahenrats and Attignenonghacs, and found the country well  watered and cultivated, and the villages populous. The people, however,  were ignorant, avaricious and untruthful, and had no idea either of a  divinity or of a religion.    On August 17th, Champlain came in sight of Cahiague, where the Hurons  had gathered, and after some hesitation, they decided to go to war. The  departure was delayed until September 1st, pending the arrival of some  of their warriors and the Andastes, who had promised five hundred men.  On their journey they passed by Lake Couchiching and Lake Ouantaron or  Simcoe. From there they decided to proceed by way of Sturgeon Lake,  after travelling by land for a distance of ten leagues. From Sturgeon  Lake flows the river Otonabi, which discharges into Rice Lake.    They followed the river Trent to the Bay of Quinte in Lake Ontario or  Entouaronons. \"Here,\" says Champlain, \"is the entrance of the grand  river of St. Lawrence.\" They leisurely crossed Lake Ontario, and, having  hidden their canoes, penetrated the woods and crossed the river Chouagen  or Oswego, which flows from Lake Oneida where the Iroquois used to fish.    On October 7th the Hurons had approached within four leagues of the  fortifications of their enemies, and on that day eleven Iroquois fell  into the hands of Champlain's men, and were made prisoners. Iroquet, the  chief of the Petite Nation, prepared to torture the prisoners, among  whom were four women and four children, but Champlain strongly opposed  this course. The Iroquois were engaged in reaping their corn when the  Hurons and their allies appeared before them on October 10th, or five  weeks after Champlain had started from Cahiague. During this period  Champlain's army had undergone much fatigue, and it was desirable to  take some rest.    The first day was spent in petty skirmishes. Instead of fighting in  ranks, the Hurons disbanded, and were consequently liable to be seized  by the vigilance of their enemies. Champlain recognized the danger of  this method of warfare, and persuaded his companions to preserve their  ranks. The last combat continued for about three hours, during which  Ochateguin and Orani, two of the allied chiefs, were wounded. Champlain  also received two arrow wounds, one in the leg and one in the knee.  There was great disorder in the ranks of the Hurons, and the chiefs had  no control over"]]]
