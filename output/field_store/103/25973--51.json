[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9097"],[0,"Robert's Rules of Order (#9)"],[1," miniature assembly that must meet together in order to  transact business, and usually one of its members should be appointed  its clerk.  Whatever is not agreed to by the majority of the members  present at a meeting (at which a quorum, consisting of a majority of the  members of the committee, shall be present) cannot form a part of its  report.  The minority may be permitted to submit their views in writing  also, either together, or each member separately, but their reports can  only be acted upon, by voting to substitute one of them for the report  of the committee.  The rules of the assembly, as far as possible, shall  apply in committee; but a reconsideration [Sec. 27] of a vote shall be  allowed, regardless of the time elapsed, only when every member who  voted with the majority is present when the reconsideration is moved.*  [Both the English common parliamentary law and the rules of Congress  prohibit the reconsideration of a vote by a committee; but the strict  enforcement of this rule in ordinary committees, would interfere with  rather than assist the transaction of business.  The rule given above  seems more just, and more in accordance with the practice of ordinary  committees, who usually reconsider at pleasure.  No improper advantage  can be taken of the privilege, as long as every member who voted with  the majority must be present when the reconsideration is moved.] A  committee (except a committee    === Page 57 ============================================================    of the whole, Sec. 32] may appoint a sub-committee.  When through with the  business assigned them, a motion is made for the committee to \"rise\"  (which is equivalent to the motion to adjourn), and that the chairman  (or some member who is more familiar with the subject) make its report  to the assembly.  The committee ceases to exist as soon as the assembly  receives the report [Sec. 30].    The committee has no power to punish its members for disorderly conduct,  its resource being to report the facts to the assembly.  No allusion can  be made in the assembly to what has occurred in committee, except it be  by a report of the committee, or by general consent.  It is the duty of  a committee to meet on the call of any two its of members, if the  chairman be absent or decline to appoint such meeting.  When a committee  adjourns without appointing a time for the next meeting, it is called  together in the same way as at its first meeting.  When a committee  adjourns to meet at another time, it is not necessary (though    === Page 58 ============================================================    usually advisable) that absent members should be notified of the  adjourned meeting.    29. Forms of Reports of Committees.  The form of a report is usually  similar to the following:    A standing committee reports thus:  \"The committee on [insert name of  committee] respectfully report,\" [or \"beg leave to report,\" or \"beg  leave to submit the following report,\"] etc., letting the report follow.    A select or special committee reports as follows:  \"The committee to  which was referred [state the matter referred] having considered the  same respectfully report,\" etc.  Or for \"The committee\" is sometimes  written \"Your committee,\" or \"The undersigned, a committee.\"    When a minority report is submitted, it should be in this form (the  majority reporting as above):  \"The undersigned, a minority of a  committee to which was referred,\" etc.  The majority report is the  report of the committee, and should never be made out as the report of  the majority.    All reports conclude with, \"All of which is    === Page 59 ============================================================    respectfully submitted.\"  They are sometimes signed only by the chairman  of the committee, but if the matter is of much importance, it is better  that the report be signed by every member who concurs.  The report is  not usually dated, or addressed, but can he headed, as for example,  \"Report of the Finance Committee of the Y. P. A., on Renting a Hall.\"    30. Reception of Reports.  When the report of a committee is to be  made, the chairman (or member appointed to make the report) informs the  assembly that the committee to whom was referred such a subject or  paper, has directed him to make a report thereon, or report it with or  without amendment, as the case may be; either he or any other member may  move that it be \"received\"* [A very common error is, after a report has  been read, to move that it be received; whereas, the fact that it has  been read, shows that it has been already received by the assembly.  Another mistake, less common, but dangerous, is to vote that the report  be accepted (which is equivalent to adopting it, see Sec. 31), when the  intention is only to have the report up for consideration and afterwards  move its adoption.  Still a third error is to move that \"the report be  adopted and the committee discharged,\" when the committee have reported  in full and their report been received, so that the committee has  already ceased to exist.  If the committee however have made but a  partial report, or report progress, then it is in order to move that the  committee be discharged from the further consideration of the subject.]  now or at some other specified time.    === Page 60 ============================================================    Usually the formality of a vote on the reception of a report of a  committee is dispensed with, the time being settled by general consent.  Should any one object, a formal motion becomes necessary.  When the time  arrives for the assembly to receive the report, the chairman of the  committee reads it in his place, and then delivers it to the clerk, when  it lies on the table till the assembly sees fit to consider it.  If the  report consists of a paper with amendments, the chairman of the  committee reads the amendments with the coherence in the paper,  explaining the alterations and reasons of the committee for the  amendments, till he has gone through the whole.  If the report is very  long, it is not usually read until the assembly is ready to consider it  [see Sec.Sec. 31 and 44].    When the report has been received, whether it has been read or not, the  committee is thereby dissolved, and can act no more without it is  revived by a vote to recommit.  If the report is recommitted, all the  parts of the report that have not been agreed to by the assembly, are  ignored by the committee as if the report had never been made.    === Page 61 ============================================================    31. Adoption of Reports.  When the assembly is to consider a report, a  motion should be made to \"adopt,\" \"accept,\" or \"agree to\" the report,  all of which, when carried, have the same effect, namely, to make the  doings of the committee become the acts of the assembly, the same as if  done by the assembly without the intervention of a committee.  If the  report contains merely a statement of opinion or facts, the motion  should be to \"accept\" the report; if it also concludes with resolutions  or certain propositions, the motion should be to \"agree to\" the  resolutions, or to \"adopt\" the propositions.  After the above motion is  made, the matter stands before the assembly exactly the same as if there  had been no committee, and the subject had been introduced by the motion  of the member who made the report.  [See Sec. 34 for his privileges in  debate, and Sec. 44 for the method of treating a report containing several  propositions, when being considered by the assembly.]    32. Committee of the Whole.  When an assembly has to consider a subject  which it does not wish to refer to a committee, and yet where the  subject matter is not well digested    === Page 62 ============================================================    and put into proper form for its definite action, or, when for any other  reason, it is desirable for the assembly to consider a subject with all  the freedom of an ordinary committee, it is the practice to refer the  matter to the \"Committee of the Whole.\"* [In large assemblies, such as  the U. S. House of Representatives, where a member can speak to any  question but once, the committee of the whole seems almost a necessity,  as it allows the freest discussion of a subject, while at any time it  can rise and thus bring into force the strict rules of the assembly.]    If it is desired to consider the question at once, the motion is made,  \"That the assembly do now resolve itself into a committee of the whole  to take under consideration,\" etc., specifying the subject.  This is  really a motion to \"commit\" [see Sec. 22 for its order of precedence,  etc.] If adopted, the Chairman immediately calls another member to the  chair, and takes his place as a member of the committee.  The committee  is under the rules of the assembly, excepting as stated hereafter in  this section.    The only motions in order are to amend and adopt, and that the committee  \"rise and report,\" as it cannot adjourn; nor can it order the \"yeas and  nays\" [Sec. 38].  The only way to close or limit debate in committee of the  whole, is for the assembly to vote that the debate in committee shall  cease at a certain time, or that after a certain time no debate shall be  allowed excepting on new amendments, and then only one speech in favor  of    === Page 63 ============================================================    and one against it, of say, five minutes each; or in some other way  regulate the time for debate.* [In Congress no motion to limit debate in  committee of the whole is in order till after the subject has been  already considered in committee of the whole.  As no subject would  probably be considered more than once in committee of the whole, in an  ordinary society, the enforcement of this rule would practically prevent  such a society from putting any limit to debate in the committee.  The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9104"],[0,"The Naval War of 1812 (#9)"],[1,"with a 74._    During the early years of this century England's naval power stood  at a height never reached before or since by that of any other  nation. On every sea her navies rode, not only triumphant, but  with none to dispute their sway. The island folk had long claimed  the mastery of the ocean, and they had certainly succeeded in  making their claim completely good during the time of bloody  warfare that followed the breaking out of the French Revolution.  Since the year 1792 each European nation, in turn, had learned to  feel bitter dread of the weight of England's hand. In the Baltic,  Sir Samuel Hood had taught the Russians that they must needs keep  in port when the English cruisers were in the offing. The descendants  of the Vikings had seen their whole navy destroyed at Copenhagen.  No Dutch fleet ever put out after the day when, off Camperdown, Lord  Duncan took possession of De Winter's shattered ships. But a few  years before 1812, the greatest sea-fighter of all time had died  in Trafalgar Bay, and in dying had crumbled to pieces the navies  of France and of Spain.    From that day England's task was but to keep in port such of her  foes' vessels as she had not destroyed. France alone still possessed  fleets that could be rendered formidable, and so, from the Scheldt  to Toulon, her harbors were watched and her coasts harried by the  blockading squadrons of the English. Elsewhere the latter had no  fear of their power being seriously assailed; but their vast commerce  and numerous colonies needed ceaseless protection. Accordingly in  every sea their cruisers could be found, of all sizes, from the  stately ship-of-the-line, with her tiers of heavy cannon and her  many hundreds of men, down to the little cutter carrying but a  score of souls and a couple of light guns. All these cruisers, but  especially those of the lesser rates, were continually brought into  contact with such of the hostile vessels as had run through the  blockade, or were too small to be affected by it. French and Italian  frigates were often fought and captured when they were skirting  their own coasts, or had started off on a plundering cruise through  the Atlantic, or to the Indian Ocean; and though the Danes had lost  their larger ships they kept up a spirited warfare with brigs and  gun-boats. So the English marine was in constant exercise, attended  with almost invariable success.    Such was Great Britain's naval power when the Congress of the United  States declared war upon her. While she could number her thousand  sail, the American navy included but half a dozen frigates, and six  or eight sloops and brigs; and it is small matter for surprise that  the British officers should have regarded their new foe with  contemptuous indifference. Hitherto the American seamen had never  been heard of except in connection with two or three engagements  with French frigates, and some obscure skirmishes against the Moors  of Tripoli; none of which could possibly attract attention in the  years that saw Aboukir, Copenhagen, and Trafalgar. And yet these  same petty wars were the school which raised our marine to the  highest standard of excellence. A continuous course of victory, won  mainly by seamanship, had made the English sailor overweeningly  self-confident, and caused him to pay but little regard to manoeuvring  or even to gunnery. Meanwhile the American learned, by receiving  hard knocks, how to give them, and belonged to a service too young  to feel an over-confidence in itself. One side had let its training  relax, while the other had carried it to the highest possible point.  Hence our ships proved, on the whole, victorious in the apparently  unequal struggle, and the men who had conquered the best seamen of  Europe were now in turn obliged to succumb. Compared with the great  naval battles of the preceding few years, out bloodiest conflicts  were mere skirmishes, but they were skirmishes between the hitherto  acknowledged kings of the ocean, and new men who yet proved to be  more than their equals. For over a hundred years, or since the time  when they had contended on equal terms with the great Dutch admirals,  the British had shown a decided superiority to their various foes,  and during the latter quarter of the time this superiority, as  already said, was very marked, indeed; in consequence, the victories  of the new enemy attracted an amount of attention altogether  disproportionate to their material effects. And it is a curious fact  that our little navy, in which the art of handling and fighting the  old broadside, sailing frigate in single conflict was brought to  the highest point of perfection ever reached, that this same navy  should have contained the first representative of the modern war  steamer, and also the torpedo--the two terrible engines which were  to drive from the ocean the very whitewinged craft that had first  won honor for the starry flag. The tactical skill of Hull or Decatur  is now of merely archaic interest, and has but little more bearing  on the manoeuvring of a modern fleet than have the tactics of the  Athenian gallies. But the war still conveys some most practical  lessons as to the value of efficient ships and, above all, of  efficient men in them. Had we only possessed the miserable gun-boats,  our men could have done nothing; had we not possessed good men, the  heavy frigates would have availed as little. Poor ships and impotent  artillery had lost the Dutch almost their entire navy; fine ships  and heavy cannon had not saved the French and Spanish from the like  fate. We owed our success to putting sailors even better than the  Dutch on ships even finer than those built by the two Latin seaboard  powers.    The first point to be remembered in order to write a fair account  of this war is that the difference in fighting skill, which certainly  existed between the two parties, was due mainly to training, and  not to the nature of the men. It seems certain that the American  had in the beginning somewhat the advantage, because his surroundings,  partly physical and partly social and political, had forced him into  habits of greater self-reliance. Therefore, on the average, he  offered rather the best material to start with; but the difference  was very slight, and totally disappeared under good training. The  combatants were men of the same race, differing but little from one  another. On the New England coast the English blood was as pure as  in any part of Britain; in New York and New Jersey it was mixed with  that of the Dutch settlers--and the Dutch are by race nearer to the  true old English of Alfred and Harold than are, for example, the  thoroughly anglicized Welsh of Cornwall. Otherwise, the infusion  of new blood into the English race on this side of the Atlantic has  been chiefly from three sources--German, Irish, and Norse; and these  three sources represent the elemental parts of the composite English  stock in about the same proportions in which they were originally  combined,--mainly Teutonic, largely Celtic, and with a Scandinavian  admixture. The descendant of the German becomes as much an  Anglo-American as the descendant of the Strathclyde Celt has already  become an Anglo-Briton. Looking through names of the combatants it  would be difficult to find any of one navy that could not be matched  in the other--Hull or Lawrence, Allen, Perry, or Stewart. And among  all the English names on both sides will be found many Scotch, Irish,  or Welsh--Macdonough, O'Brien, or Jones. Still stranger ones appear:  the Huguenot Tattnall is one among the American defenders of the  _Constellation_, and another Huguenot Tattnall is among the British  assailants at Lake Borgne. It must always be kept in mind that the  Americans and the British are two substantially similar branches of  the great English race, which both before and after their separation  have assimilated, and made Englishmen of many other peoples. [Footnote:  The inhabitants of Great Britain are best designated as  \"British\"--English being either too narrow or too broad a term, in  one case meaning the inhabitants of but a part of Britain, and in  the other the whole Anglo-Saxon people.] The lessons taught by the  war can hardly be learned unless this identity is kept in mind.  [Footnote: It was practically a civil war, and was waged with much  harshness and bitterness on both sides. I have already spoken of  the numerous grievances of the Americans; the British, in turn,  looked upon our blockade-runners which entered the French ports  exactly as we regarded, at a later date, the British steamers that  ran into Wilmington and Charleston. It is curious to see how illogical  writers are. The careers of the _Argus_ and _Alabama_ for example,  were strikingly similar in many ways, yet the same writer who speaks  of one as an \"heroic little brig,\" will call the other a \"black  pirate.\" Of course there can be no possible comparison as to the  causes for which the two vessels were fighting; but the cruises  themselves were very much alike, both in character and history.]    To understand aright the efficiency of our navy, it is necessary to  take a brief look at the character and antecedents of the officers  and men who served in it.    When war broke out the United States Navy was but a few years old,  yet it already had a far from dishonorable history. The captains  and lieutenants of 1812 had been taught their duties in a very  practical school, and the flag under which they fought was endeared  to them already by not a few glorious traditions--though these,  perhaps, like others of their kind, had lost none of their glory  in the telling. A few of the older men had served in the war of the  Revolution, and all still kept fresh in mind the doughty deeds of  the old-time privateering war craft. Men still talked of Biddle's  daring cruises and Barney's stubborn fights, or told of Scotch Paul  and the grim work they"]]]
