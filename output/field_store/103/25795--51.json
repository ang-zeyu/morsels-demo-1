[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4973"],[0,"Frederick Chopin, as a Man and Musician â€” Complete (#9)"],[1," seen Justina Chopin in her old age, and conversed with her in French,  told me that she was then \"a neat, quiet, intelligent old lady, whose  activeness contrasted strongly with the languor of her son, who had  not a shadow of energy in him.\" With regard to the latter part of this  account, we must not overlook the fact that my informant knew Chopin  only in the last year of his life--i.e., when he was in a very suffering  state of mind and body. This is all the information I have been able to  collect regarding the character of Chopin's mother. Moreover, Karasowski  is not an altogether trustworthy informant; as a friend of the Chopin  family he sees in its members so many paragons of intellectual and moral  perfection. He proceeds on the de mortuis nil nisi bonum principle,  which I venture to suggest is a very bad principle. Let us apply this  loving tenderness to our living neighbours, and judge the dead according  to their merits. Thus the living will be doubly benefited, and no harm  be done to the dead. Still, the evidence before us--including that  exclamation about his \"best of mothers\" in one of Chopin's letters,  written from Vienna, soon after the outbreak of the Polish  insurrection in 1830: \"How glad my mamma will be that I did not come  back!\"--justifies us, I think, in inferring that Justina Chopin was a  woman of the most lovable type, one in whom the central principle of  existence was the maternal instinct, that bright ray of light which,  dispersed in its action, displays itself in the most varied and lovely  colours. That this principle, although often all-absorbing, is not  incompatible with the wider and higher social and intellectual interests  is a proposition that does not stand in need of proof. But who could  describe that wondrous blending of loving strength and lovable weakness  of a true woman's character? You feel its beauty and sublimity, and if  you attempt to give words to your feeling you produce a caricature.    The three sisters of Frederick all manifested more or less a taste  for literature. The two elder sisters, Louisa (who married Professor  Jedrzejewicz, and died in 1855) and Isabella (who married Anton  Barcinski--first inspector of schools, and subsequently director of  steam navigation on the Vistula--and died in 1881), wrote together for  the improvement of the working classes. The former contributed now and  then, also after her marriage, articles to periodicals on the education  of the young. Emilia, the youngest sister, who died at the early age of  fourteen (in 1827), translated, conjointly with her sister Isabella,  the educational tales of the German author Salzmann, and her poetical  efforts held out much promise for the future.        CHAPTER II        FREDERICK'S FIRST MUSICAL INSTRUCTION AND MUSIC-MASTER, ADALBERT  ZYWNY.--HIS DEBUT AND SUCCESS AS A PIANIST.--HIS EARLY INTRODUCTION INTO  ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY AND CONSTANT INTERCOURSE WITH THE ARISTOCRACY.--HIS  FIRST COMPOSITIONS.--HIS STUDIES AND MASTER IN HARMONY, COUNTERPOINT,  AND COMPOSITION, JOSEPH ELSNER.        OUR little friend, who, as we have seen, at first took up a hostile  attitude towards music--for his passionate utterances, albeit  inarticulate, cannot well be interpreted as expressions of satisfaction  or approval--came before long under her mighty sway. The pianoforte  threw a spell over him, and, attracting him more and more, inspired  him with such a fondness as to induce his parents to provide him,  notwithstanding his tender age, with an instructor. To lessen the  awfulness of the proceeding, it was arranged that one of the elder  sisters should join him in his lessons. The first and only pianoforte  teacher of him who in the course of time became one of the greatest and  most original masters of this instrument, deserves some attention from  us. Adalbert Zywny [FOOTNOTE: This is the usual spelling of the name,  which, as the reader will see further on, its possessor wrote Ziwny.  Liszt calls him Zywna.], a native of Bohemia, born in 1756, came to  Poland, according to Albert Sowinski (Les musiciens polonais et slaves),  during the reign of Stanislas Augustus Poniatowski (1764--1795), and  after staying for some time as pianist at the court of Prince Casimir  Sapieha, settled in Warsaw as a teacher of music, and soon got into good  practice, \"giving his lessons at three florins (eighteen pence) per hour  very regularly, and making a fortune.\" And thus teaching and composing  (he is said to have composed much for the pianoforte, but he never  published anything), he lived a long and useful life, dying in 1842 at  the age of 86 (Karasowski says in 1840). The punctual and, no doubt,  also somewhat pedantic music-master who acquired the esteem and goodwill  of his patrons, the best families of Warsaw, and a fortune at the same  time, is a pleasant figure to contemplate. The honest orderliness and  dignified calmness of his life, as I read it, are quite refreshing in  this time of rush and gush. Having seen a letter of his, I can imagine  the heaps of original MSS., clearly and neatly penned with a firm  hand, lying carefully packed up in spacious drawers, or piled up on  well-dusted shelves. Of the man Zywny and his relation to the Chopin  family we get some glimpses in Frederick's letters. In one of the year  1828, addressed to his friend Titus Woyciechowski, he writes: \"With us  things are as they used to be; the honest Zywny is the soul of all our  amusements.\" Sowinski informs us that Zywny taught his pupil according  to the classical German method--whatever that may mean--at that time in  use in Poland. Liszt, who calls him \"an enthusiastic student of Bach,\"  speaks likewise of \"les errements d'une ecole entierement classique.\"  Now imagine my astonishment when on asking the well-known pianoforte  player and composer Edouard Wolff, a native of Warsaw, [Fooynote: He  died at Paris on October 16, 1880.] what kind of pianist Zywny was,  I received the answer that he was a violinist and not a pianist.  That Wolff and Zywny knew each other is proved beyond doubt by the  above-mentioned letter of Zywny's, introducing the former to Chopin,  then resident in Paris. The solution of the riddle is probably this.  Zywny, whether violinist or not, was not a pianoforte virtuoso--at  least, was not heard in public in his old age. The mention of a single  name, that of Wenzel W. Wurfel, certainly shows that he was not the best  pianist in Warsaw. But against any such depreciatory remarks we have  to set Chopin's high opinion of Zywny's teaching capability. Zywny's  letter, already twice alluded to, is worth quoting. It still further  illustrates the relation in which master and pupil stood to each other,  and by bringing us in close contact with the former makes us better  acquainted with his character. A particularly curious fact about the  letter--considering the nationality of the persons concerned--is its  being written in German. Only a fac-simile of the original, with its  clear, firm, though (owing to the writer's old age) cramped penmanship,  and its quaint spelling and capricious use of capital and small  initials, could fully reveal the expressiveness of this document.  However, even in the translation there may be found some of the man's  characteristic old-fashioned formality, grave benevolence, and quiet  homeliness. The outside of the sheet on which the letter is written  bears the words, \"From the old music-master Adalbert Ziwny [at least  this I take to be the meaning of the seven letters followed by dots],  kindly to be transmitted to my best friend, Mr. Frederick Chopin, in  Paris.\" The letter itself runs as follows:--       DEAREST MR. F. CHOPIN,--Wishing you perfect health I have the     honour to write to you through Mr. Eduard Wolf. [FOOTNOTE:     The language of the first sentence is neither logical nor     otherwise precise. I shall keep throughout as close as     possible to the original, and also retain the peculiar     spelling of proper names.] I recommend him to your esteemed     friendship. Your whole family and I had also the pleasure of     hearing at his concert the Adagio and Rondo from your     Concerto, which called up in our minds the most agreeable     remembrance of you. May God give you every prosperity! We are     all well, and wish so much to see you again. Meanwhile I send     you through Mr. Wolf my heartiest kiss, and recommending     myself to your esteemed friendship, I remain your faithful     friend,       ADALBERT ZIWNY.       Warsaw, the 12th of June, 1835.       N.B.--Mr. Kirkow, the merchant, and his son George, who was     at Mr. Reinschmid's at your farewell party, recommend     themselves to you, and wish you good health. Adieu.    Julius Fontana, the friend and companion of Frederick, after stating (in  his preface to Chopin's posthumous works) that Chopin had never another  pianoforte teacher than Zywny, observes that the latter taught his  pupil only the first principles. \"The progress of the child was so  extraordinary that his parents and his professor thought they could do  no better than abandon him at the age of 12 to his own instincts, and  follow instead of directing him.\" The progress of Frederick must indeed  have been considerable, for in Clementina Tanska-Hofmanowa's Pamiatka po  dobrej matce (Memorial of a good Mother) [FOOTNOTE: Published in 1819.]  the writer relates that she was at a soiree at Gr----'s, where she found  a numerous party assembled, and heard in the course of the evening young  Chopin play the piano--\"a child not yet eight years old, who, in the  opinion of the connoisseurs of the art, promises to replace Mozart.\"  Before the boy had completed his ninth year his talents were already so  favourably known that he was invited to take part in a concert which was  got up by several persons of high rank for the benefit of the poor. The  bearer of the invitation was no less a person than Ursin Niemcewicz, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4974"],[0,"Australia Twice Traversed (#9)"],[1,"ard,  sent some of their warriers to creep unseen inside and slam the gates,  so as to prevent retreat. Then from the outside an attempt to massacre  was made; several whites were speared, some were killed on the spot,  others died soon afterwards, but the greatest wonder was that any at  all escaped.    The establishment at the Charlotte Waters stands on a large grassy and  pebbly plain, bounded on the north by a watercourse half a mile away.  The natives here have always been peaceful, and never displayed any  hostility to the whites. From this last station I made my way to  Chambers' Pillar, which was to be my actual starting-point for the  west.      BOOK 1.      CHAPTER 1.1. FROM 4TH TO 30TH AUGUST, 1872.    The party.

I  intended to engage the services of another white man at the furthest  outpost that I could secure one. From Port Augusta I despatched the  bulk of my stores by a team to the Peake, and made a leisurely  progress up the overland road via Beltana, the Finniss and Strangways  Springs stations. Our stores reached the Peake station before us. This  station was originally called Mount Margaret, but subsequently removed  to the mound-springs near the south bank of the Peake Creek; it was a  cattle station formed by Mr. Phillip Levi of Adelaide. The character  of the country is an open stony plateau, upon which lines of hills or  ranges rise; it is intersected by numerous watercourses, all trending  to Lake Eyre, and was an excellent cattle run. The South Australian  Government erected the telegraph station in the immediate vicinity of  the cattle station. When the cattle station was first formed in 1862  the natives were very numerous and very hostile, but at the time of my  visit, ten years later, they were comparatively civilised. At the  Peake we were enabled to re-shoe all our horses, for the stony road up  from Port Augusta had worn out all that were put on there. I also had  an extra set fitted for each horse, rolled up in calico, and marked  with its name. At the Peake I engaged a young man named Alec Robinson,  who, according to his account, could do everything, and had been  everywhere, who knew the country I was about to explore perfectly  well, and who had frequently met and camped with blacks from the west  coast, and declared we could easily go over there in a few weeks. He  died at one of the telegraph stations a year or two after he left me.  I must say he was very good at cooking, and shoeing horses. I am able  to do these useful works myself, but I do not relish either. I had  brought a light little spring cart with me all the way from Melbourne  to the Peake, which I sold here, and my means of transit from thence  was with pack-horses. After a rather prolonged sojourn at the Peake,  where I received great hospitality from Mr. Blood, of the Telegraph  Department, and from Messrs. Bagot, the owners, and Mr. Conway, the  manager, we departed for the Charlotte.    My little black boy Dick, or, as he used generally to write, and call  himself, Richard Giles Kew, 1872, had been at school at Kew, near  Melbourne. He came to me from Queensland; he had visited Adelaide,  Melbourne, and Sydney, and had been with me for nearly three years,  but his fears of wild natives were terribly excited by what nearly  everybody we met said to him about them. This was not surprising, as  it was usually something to this effect, in bush parlance: \"By G--,  young feller, just you look out when you get OUTSIDE! the wild blacks  will [adjective] soon cook you. They'll kill YOU first, you know--they  WILL like to cut out your kidney fat! They'll sneak on yer when yer  goes out after the horses, they'll have yer and eat yer.\" This being  the burden of the strain continually dinned into the boy's ears, made  him so terrified and nervous the farther we got away from  civilisation, that soon after leaving the Peake, as we were camping  one night with some bullock teams returning south, the same stories  having been told him over again, he at last made up his mind, and told  me he wanted to go back with one of the teamsters; he had hinted about  this before, and both Carmichael and Robinson seemed to be aware of  his intention. Force was useless to detain him; argument was lost on  him, and entreaty I did not attempt, so in the morning we parted. I  shall mention him again by-and-bye. He was a small, very handsome,  light-complexioned, very intelligent, but childish boy, and was  frequently mistaken for a half-caste; he was a splendid rider and  tracker, and knew almost everything. He was a great wit, as one remark  of his will show. In travelling up the country after he had been at  school, we once saw some old deserted native gunyahs, and he said to  me as we rode by, pointing to them, \"Gentleman's 'ouse, villa  residence, I s'pose, he's gone to his watering place for the season  p'r'aps.\" At another time, being at a place called Crowlands, he asked  me why it was called so. I replied pointing to a crow on a tree, \"Why,  there's the crow,\" and stamping with my foot on the ground, \"there's  the land;\" he immediately said, \"Oh, now I know why my country is  called Queensland, because it's land belonging to our Queen.\" I said,  \"Certainly it is;\" then he said, \"Well, ain't it funny? I never knew  that before.\" In Melbourne, one day, we were leaning out of a window  overlooking the people continually passing by. Dick said, \"What  for,--white fellow always walk about--walk about in town--when he  always rides in the bush?\" I said, \"Oh, to do their business.\"  \"Business,\" he asked, \"what's that?\" I said, \"Why, to get money, to be  sure.\" \"Money,\" he said; \"white fellow can't pick up money in the  street.\"    From the Peake we had only pack-horses and one little Scotch terrier  dog. Dick left us at Hann's Creek, thirty miles from the Peake. On our  road up, about halfway between the Peake and the Charlotte, we crossed  and camped at a large creek which runs into the Finke, called the  Alberga. Here we met a few natives, who were friendly enough, but who  were known to be great thieves, having stolen things from several  bullock drays, and committed other robberies; so we had to keep a  sharp look out upon them and their actions. One of their number, a  young man, could speak English pretty well, and could actually sing  some songs. His most successful effort in that line was the song of  \"Jim Crow,\" and he performed the \"turn about and wheel about and do  just so\" part of it until he got giddy, or pretended to be; and to get  rid of him and his brethren, we gave them some flour and a smoke of  tobacco, and they departed.    We arrived at the Charlotte Waters station on the 4th of August, 1872;  this was actually my last outpost of civilisation. My companion, Mr.  Carmichael, and I were most kindly welcomed by Mr. Johnstone, the  officer in charge of this depot, and by Mr. Chandler, a gentleman  belonging to a telegraph station farther up the line. In consequence  of their kindness, our stay was lengthened to a week. My horses were  all the better for the short respite, for they were by no means in  good fettle; but the country having been visited by rains, grass was  abundant, and the animals improving. The party consisted only of  myself, Carmichael, and Robinson; I could not now obtain another man  to make up our original number of four. We still had the little dog.  during our stay at the Charlotte I inquired of a number of the natives  for information concerning the region beyond, to the west and  north-west. They often used the words \"Larapinta and plenty black  fellow.\" Of the country to the west they seemed to know more, but it  was very difficult to get positive statements. The gist of their  information was that there were large waters, high mountains, and  plenty, plenty, wild black fellow; they said the wild blacks were very  big and fat, and had hair growing, as some said, all down their backs;  while others asserted that the hair grew all over their bodies, and  that they eat pickaninnies, and sometimes came eastward and killed any  of the members of the Charlotte tribe that they could find, and  carried off all the women they could catch. On the 12th we departed,  and my intended starting point being Chambers' Pillar, upon the Finke  River, I proceeded up the telegraph road as far as the crossing place  of the above-named watercourse, which was sixty miles by the road.    (ILLUSTRATION: CHAMBERS' PILLAR.)    In the evening of the day we encamped there, a Government party, under  the charge of Mr. McMinn, surveyor, and accompanied by Mr. Harley  Bacon, a son of Lady Charlotte Bacon, arrived from the north, and we  had their company at the camp. Close to this crossing-place a large  tributary joins the Finke near the foot of Mount Humphries. On the  following day Mr. McMinn, Mr. Bacon, and I rode up its"]]]
