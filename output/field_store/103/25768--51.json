Instead of thirty hours, we took  three mortal days and nights to reach Cairo, and we grounded with  painful regularity four or five times between sunrise and sunset. In  the scenery on the banks sketchers and describers have left you nought  to see. From Pompey's Pillar to the Maison Carree, Kariom and its  potteries, Al-Birkah[FN#1] of the night birds, Bastarah    [p.30]with the alleys of trees, even unto Atfah, all things are  perfectly familiar to us, and have been so years before the traveller  actually sees them. The Nil al-Mubarak itself-the Blessed Nile,-as  notably fails too at this season to arouse enthusiasm. You see nothing  but muddy waters, dusty banks, a sand mist, a milky sky, and a glaring  sun: you feel nought but a breeze like the blast from a potter's  furnace. You can only just distinguish through a veil of reeking  vapours the village Shibr Katt from the village Kafr al-Zayyat, and you  steam too far from Wardan town to enjoy the Timonic satisfaction of  enraging its male population with \"Haykal! ya ibn Haykal! O Haykal!-O  son of Haykal[FN#2]!\" You are nearly wrecked, as a matter of course, at  the Barrage; and you are certainly dumbfoundered by the sight of its  ugly little Gothic crenelles.[FN#3] The Pyramids of Khufa and Khafra  (Cheops    [p.31]and Cephren) \"rearing their majestic heads above the margin of  the Desert,\" only suggest of remark that they have been remarkably  well-sketched; and thus you proceed till with a real feeling of  satisfaction you moor alongside of the tumble-down old suburb \"Bulak.\"    To me there was double dulness in the scenery: it seemed to be Sind  over again-the same morning mist and noon-tide glare; the same hot wind  and heat clouds, and fiery sunset, and evening glow; the same pillars  of dust and \"devils\" of sand sweeping like giants over the plain; the  same turbid waters of a broad, shallow stream studded with sand-banks  and silt-isles, with crashing earth slips and ruins nodding over a kind  of cliff, whose base the stream gnaws with noisy tooth. On the banks,  saline ground sparkled and glittered like hoar-frost in the sun; and  here and there mud villages, solitary huts, pigeon-towers, or watch  turrets, whence litt1e brown boys shouted and slung stones at the  birds, peeped out from among bright green patches of palm-tree,  tamarisk, and mimosa, of maize, tobacco, and sugar-cane. Beyond the  narrow tongue of land on the river banks lay the glaring, yellow  Desert, with its low hills and sand slopes, bounded by innumerable  pyramids of Nature's architecture. The boats, with their sharp bows,  preposterous sterns, and lateen sails, might have belonged to the  Indus. So might the chocolate-skinned, blue-robed peasantry; the women  carrying progeny on their hips, with the eternal waterpot on their  heads; and the men sleeping in the shade or following the plough, to  which probably Osiris first put hand. The lower animals, like the  higher, were the same; gaunt, mange-stained camels, muddy buffaloes,  scurvied donkeys, sneaking jackals, and fox-like dogs. Even the  feathered creatures were perfectly familiar to my eye-    [p.32]paddy birds, pelicans, giant cranes, kites and wild water-fowl.    I had taken a third-class or deck-passage, whereby the evils of the  journey were exasperated. A roasting sun pierced the canvas awning like  hot water through a gauze veil, and by night the cold dews fell raw and  thick as a Scotch mist. The cooking was abominable, and the dignity of  Darwaysh-hood did not allow me to sit at meat with Infidels or to eat  the food which they had polluted. So the Pilgrim squatted apart,  smoking perpetually, with occasional interruptions to say his prayers  and to tell his beads upon the mighty rosary; and he drank the muddy  water of the canal out of a leathern bucket, and he munched his bread  and garlic[FN#4] with a desperate sanctimoniousness.    The \"Little Asthmatic\" was densely crowded, and discipline not daring  to mark out particular places, the scene on board of her was motley  enough. There were two Indian officers, who naturally spoke to none but  each other, drank bad tea, and smoked their cigars exclusively    [p.33]like Britons. A troop of the Kurd Kawwas,[FN#5] escorting  treasure, was surrounded by a group of noisy Greeks; these men's gross  practical jokes sounding anything but pleasant to the solemn Moslems,  whose saddle-bags and furniture were at every moment in danger of being  defiled by abominable drinks and the ejected juices of tobacco. There  was one pretty woman on board, a Spanish girl, who looked strangely  misplaced-a rose in a field of thistles. Some silent Italians, with  noisy interpreters, sat staidly upon the benches. It was soon found  out, through the communicative dragoman, that their business was to buy  horses for H. M. of Sardinia: they were exposed to a volley of  questions delivered by a party of French tradesmen returning to Cairo,  but they shielded themselves and fought shy with Machiavellian  dexterity. Besides these was a German, a \"beer-bottle in the morning  and a bottle of beer in the evening,\" to borrow a simile from his own  nation; a Syrian merchant, the richest and ugliest of Alexandria; and a  few French house-painters going to decorate the Pasha's palace at  Shubra. These last were the happiest of our voyagers,-veritable  children of Paris, Montagnards, Voltaireans, and thoroughbred  Sans-Soucis. All day they sat upon deck chattering as only their lively  nation can chatter, indulging in ultra-gallic maxims, such as \"on ne  vieillit jamais a table;\" now playing ecarte for love or nothing, then  composing \"des ponches un peu chiques;\" now reciting adventures of the  category \"Mirabolant,\" then singing, then dancing, then sleeping, and  rising to play, to drink, talk, dance, and sing again. One chaunted:    \"Je n'ai pas connu mon pere  Ce respectable vieillard.  Je suis ne trois ans trop tard,\" &.;    Whilst another trolled out:    \"Qu'est ce que je vois?  Un canard en robe de chambre!\"    [p.34]They being new comers, free from the western morgue so soon  caught by Oriental Europeans, were particularly civil to me, even  wishing to mix me a strong draught; but I was not so fortunate with all  on board. A large shopkeeper threatened to \"briser\" my \"figure\" for  putting my pipe near his pantaloons; but seeing me finger my dagger  curiously, though I did not shift my pipe, he forgot to remember his  threat. I had taken charge of a parcel for one M. P-, a student of  Coptic, and remitted it to him on board; of this little service the  only acknowledgment was a stare and a petulant inquiry why I had not  given it to him before. And one of the Englishmen, half publicly, half  privily, as though communing with himself, condemned my organs of  vision because I happened to touch his elbow. He was a man in my own  service; I pardoned him in consideration of the compliment paid to my  disguise.    Two fellow-passengers were destined to play an important part in my  comedy of Cairo. Just after we had started, a little event afforded us  some amusement. On the bank appeared a short, crummy, pursy kind of  man, whose efforts to board the steamer were notably ridiculous. With  attention divided between the vessel and a carpet-bag carried by his  donkey boy, he ran along the sides of the canal, now stumbling into  hollows, then climbing heights, then standing shouting upon the  projections with the fierce sun upon his back, till everyone thought  his breath was completely gone. But no! game to the backbone, he would  have perished miserably rather than lose his fare: \"patience and  perseverance,\" say the wise, \"got a wife for his Reverence.\" At last he  was taken on board, and presently he lay down to sleep. His sooty  complexion, lank black hair, features in which appeared beaucoup de  finesse, that is to say, abundant rascality, an eternal smile and  treacherous eyes, his gold[FN#6] ring, dress    [p.35]of showy colours, fleshy stomach, fat legs, round back, and a  peculiar manner of frowning and fawning simultaneously, marked him an  Indian. When he awoke he introduced himself to me as Miyan Khudabakhsh  Namdar, a native of Lahore: he had carried on the trade of a shawl  merchant in London and Paris, where he had lived two years, and, after  a pilgrimage intended to purge away the sins of civilised lands, he had  settled at Cairo.    My second friend, Haji Wali, I will introduce to the reader in a future  chapter; and my two expeditions to Midian have brought him once more  into notice.[FN#7]    Long conversations in Persian and Hindustani abridged the tediousness  of the voyage, and when we arrived at Bulak, the polite Khudabakhsh  insisted upon my making his house my home. I was unwilling to accept  the man's civility, disliking his looks; but he advanced cogent reasons  for changing my mind. His servant cleared my luggage through the  custom-house, and a few minutes after our arrival I found myself in his  abode near the Azbakiyah Gardens, sitting in a cool Mashrabiyah[FN#8]  that gracefully projected over a garden, and sipping the favourite  glass of pomegranate syrup.    As the Wakalahs or Caravanserais were at that time full of pilgrims, I  remained with Khudabakhsh ten days or a fortnight. But at the end of  that time my patience was thoroughly exhausted. My host had become a  civilised man, who sat on chairs, who ate with a fork, who talked  European politics, and who had learned to admire, if not to understand,  liberty-liberal ideas! and was I not flying from such things? Besides  which, we English have a    [p.36]peculiar national quality, which the Indians, with their  characteristic acuteness, soon perceived, and described by an  opprobrious name. Observing our solitary habits, that we could not, and  would not, sit and talk and sip sherbet and smoke with them, they  called us \"Jangli\"-wild men, fresh caught in the jungle and sent to  rule over the land of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4658"],[0,"Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah & Meccah â€” Volume 2 (#9)"],[1,"flight from Meccah [FN#34]    The Masjid al-FazikhÂ—of Date-liquorÂ—is so called because when Abu Ayyub and  others of the Ansar were sitting with cups in their hands, they heard  that intoxicating    [p.46] draughts were for the future forbidden, upon which they poured  the liquor upon the ground. Here the Prophet prayed six days whilst he  was engaged in warring down the Benu Nazir Jews. The Mosque derives its  other name, Al-ShamsÂ—of the SunÂ—because, being erected on rising ground  East of and near Kuba, it receives the first rays of morning light.    To the Eastward of the Masjid al-Fazikh lies the Masjid al-Kurayzah,  erected on a spot where the Prophet descended to attack the Jewish  tribe of that name. Returning from the battle of the Moat, wayworn and  tired with fighting, he here sat down to wash and comb his hair, when  suddenly appeared to him the Archangel Gabriel in the figure of a  horseman dressed in a corslet and covered with dust. Â“The Angels of Allah,Â”  said the preternatural visitor, Â“are still in Arms, O Prophet, and it is  AllahÂ’s Will that Thy foot return to the Stirrup. I go before Thee to  prepare a Victory over the Infidels, the Sons of Kurayzah.Â” The legend  adds that the dust raised by the angelic host was seen in the streets  of Al-Madinah, but that mortal eye fell not upon horsemanÂ’s form. The  Prophet ordered his followers to sound the battle-call, gave his flag  to Ali,Â—the Arab token of appointing a commander-in-chief,Â—and for  twenty-five days invested the habitations of the enemy. This hapless  tribe was exterminated, sentence of death being passed upon them by SaÂ’ad  ibn MaÂ’az, an Ausi whom they constituted their judge because he belonged  to an allied tribe. Six hundred men were beheaded in the Market-place  of Al-Madinah, their property was plundered, and their wives and  children were reduced to slavery.    Â“Tantane relligio potuit suadere malorum!Â”    The Masjid Mashrabat Umm Ibrahim, or Mosque of the garden of IbrahimÂ’s  mother, is a place where Mariyah the Copt had a garden, and became the  mother of    [p.47] Ibrahim, the ProphetÂ’s second son.[FN#35] It is a small building  in what is called the Awali, or highest part of the Al-Madinah plain,  to the North of the Masjid Benu Kurayzah, and near the Eastern Harrah  or ridge.[FN#36]    Northwards of Al-Bakia is, or was, a small building called the Masjid  al-IjabahÂ—of Granting,Â—from the following circumstance. One day the Prophet  stopped to perform his devotions at this place, which then belonged to  the Benu MuÂ’awiyah of the tribe of Aus. He made a long Dua or  supplication, and then turning to his Companions, exclaimed, Â“I have  asked of Allah three favours, two hath he vouchsafed to me, but the  third was refused!Â” Those granted were that the Moslems might never be  destroyed by famine or by deluge. The third was that they might not  perish by internecine strife.    The Masjid al-Fath (of Victory), vulgarly called the Â“Four Mosques,Â” is  situated in the Wady Al-Sayh,[FN#37] which comes from the direction of  Kuba, and about half a mile to the East of Â“Al-Kiblatayn.Â” The largest is  called the Masjid al-Fath, or Al-AhzabÂ—of the Troops,Â—and is alluded to in  the Koran. Here it is said the Prophet prayed for three days during the  Battle of the Moat, also called the affair Â“Al-Ahzab,Â” the last fought with  the Infidel Kuraysh under Abu Sufiyan. After three days of devotion, a  cold and violent blast arose, with rain    [p.48] and sleet, and discomfited the foe. The ProphetÂ’s prayer having  here been granted, it is supposed by ardent Moslems that no petition  put up at the Mosque Al-Ahzab is ever neglected by Allah. The form of  supplication is differently quoted by different authors. When Al-ShafeÂ’i  was in trouble and fear of Harun al-Rashid, by the virtue of this  formula he escaped all danger: I would willingly offer so valuable a  prophylactory to my readers, only it is of an unmanageable length. The  doctors of Al-Islam also greatly differ about the spot where the  Prophet stood on this occasion; most of them support the claims of the  Masjid al-Fath, the most elevated of the four, to that distinction.  Below, and to the South of the highest ground, is the Masjid Salman  al-Farsi, the Persian, from whose brain emanated the bright idea of the  Moat. At the mature age of two hundred and fifty, some say three  hundred and fifty, after spending his life in search of a religion,  from a Magus (fire-worshipper)[FN#38] becoming successively a Jew and a  Nazarene, he ended with being a Moslem, and a Companion of Mohammed.  During his eventful career he had been ten times sold into slavery.  Below SalmanÂ’s Mosque is the Masjid Ali, and the smallest building on the  South of the hill is called Masjid Abu Bakr. All these places owe their  existence to Al-Walid the Caliph: they were repaired at times by his  successors.    The Masjid al-RayahÂ—of the BannerÂ—was originally built by Al-Walid upon a  place where the Prophet pitched his tent during the War of the Moat.  Others call it Al-Zubab, after a hill upon which it stands. Al-Rayah is  separated from the Masjid al-Fath by a rising ground called Jabal Sula  or Jabal Sawab[FN#39]: the former    [p.49] being on the Eastern, whilst the latter lies upon the Western  declivity of the hill. The position of this place is greatly admired,  as commanding the fairest view of the Harim.    About a mile and a half South-east of Al-Bakia is a dome called Kuwwat  Islam, the Â“Strength of Al-Islam.Â” Here the Apostle planted a dry  palm-stick, which grew up, blossomed, and bore fruit at once. Moreover,  on one occasion when the Moslems were unable to perform the pilgrimage,  Mohammed here produced the appearance of a KaÂ’abah, an Arafat, and all  the appurtenances of the Hajj. I must warn my readers not to condemn  the founder of Al-Islam for these puerile inventions.    The Masjid Onayn lies South of HamzahÂ’s tomb. It is on a hill called  Jabal al-Rumat, the ShootersÂ’ Hill, and here during the battle of Ohod  stood the archers of Al-Islam. According to some, the Prince of Martyrs  here received his death-wound; others place that event at the Masjid  al-Askar or the Masjid al-Wady.[FN#40]    Besides these fourteen, I find the names, and nothing but the names, of  forty Mosques. The reader loses little by my unwillingness to offer him  a detailed list of such appellations as Masjid Benu Abd al-Ashhal,  Masjid Benu Harisah, Masjid Benu Harim, Masjid al-Fash, Masjid  al-Sukiya, Masjid Benu Bayazah, Masjid Benu Hatmah,    Â“Cum multis aliis quÃ¦ nunc perscribere longum est.Â”    [FN#1] The cholera. See chapter xviii.  [FN#2] The word Hawamid is plural of Hamidah, Hawazin of Hazimi.  [FN#3] Anciently there was a Caravan from Maskat to Al-Madinah. My  friends could not tell me when the line had been given up, but all were  agreed that for years they had not seen an Oman caravan, the pilgrims  preferring to enter Al-Hijaz via Jeddah.  [FN#4] According to Abulfeda, Khaybar is six stations N.E. of  Al-Madinah; it is four according to Al-Idrisi; but my informants  assured me that camels go there easily, as the Tarikh al-Khamisy says,  in three days. I should place it 80 miles N.N.E. of Al-Madinah.  Al-Atwal locates it in 65Â° 20' E. lon., and 25Â° 20' N. lat; Al-Kanun in  lon. 67Â° 30', and lat. 24Â° 20'; Ibn SaÂ’id in lon. 64Â° 56', and lat. 27Â°; and  DÂ’Anville in lon. 57Â°, and lat. 25Â°. In BurckhardtÂ’s map, and those copied from  it, Khaybar is placed about 2Â° distant from Al-Madinah, which I believe  to be too far.  [FN#5] The Parliamentary limit of an officerÂ’s leave from India is five  years: if he overstay that period, he forfeits his commission.  {to me the comfort of reflecting that possibly at Meccah some  opportunity of crossing the Peninsula might present itself. At any rate  I had the certainty of seeing the strange wild country of the Hijaz,  and of being present at the ceremonies of the Holy City. I must request  the reader to bear with a Visitation once more: we shall conclude it  with a ride to Al-Bakia.[FN#6] This venerable spot is frequented by the  pious every day after the prayer at the ProphetÂ’s Tomb, and especially on  Fridays.  [FN#6] The name means Â“the place of many roots.Â” It is also called Bakia  Al-GharkadÂ—the place of many roots of the tree Rhamnus. Gharkad is  translated in different ways: some term it the lote, others the tree of  the Jews (Forskal, sub voce).  [FN#7] See chapter xxi., ante.  [FN#8] The same is said of the Makbarah Benu Salmah or Salim, a  cemetery to the west of Al-Madinah, below rising ground called Jabal  Sula. It has long ago been deserted. See chapter xiv.  [FN#9] In those days Al-Madinah had no walls, and was clear of houses  on the East of the Harim.  [FN#10] These stones were removed by Al-Marwan, who determined that  OsmanÂ’s grave should not be distinguished from his fellows. For this act,  the lieutenant of MuÂ’awiyah was reproved and blamed by pious Moslems.  [FN#11] It ought to be high enough for the tenant to sit upright when  answering the interrogatory angels.  [FN#12] Because of this superstition, in every part of Al-Islam, some  contrivance is made to prevent the earth pressing upon the body.  [FN#13] This blessing is in MohammedÂ’s words, as the beauty of the Arabic  shows. Ayishah relates that in the month Safar, A.H. 11, one night the  Prophet, who was beginning to suffer from the headache which caused his  death, arose from his couch, and walked out into the darkness;  whereupon she followed him in a fit of jealousy, thinking he might be  about to visit some other wife. He went to Al-Bakia, delivered the  above benediction (which others give somewhat differently), raised his  hands three times, and turned to go home. Ayishah hurried back, but she  could not conceal her agitation from her husband, who asked her what  she had done. Upon her confessing her suspicions, he sternly informed  her that he had gone forth, by order of the Archangel"]]]
