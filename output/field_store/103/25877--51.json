As then we have determined these points, we will leave  the rest to be spoken to in another place, as if the subject was now  finished; and beginning again anew, first consider the sentiments of  those who have treated of the most perfect forms of government.          BOOK II          CHAPTER I      Since then we propose to inquire what civil society is of all others  best for those who have it in their power to live entirely as they wish,  it is necessary to examine into the polity of those states which are  allowed to be well governed; and if there should be any others which  some persons have described, and which appear properly regulated, to  note what is right and useful in them; and when we point out wherein  they have failed, let not this be imputed to an affectation of wisdom,  for it is because there are great defects in all those which are already  established, that I have been induced to undertake this work. We will  begin with that part of the subject which naturally presents itself  first to our consideration. The members of every state must of necessity  have all things in common, or some things common, and not others,  or nothing at all common. To have nothing in common is evidently  impossible, for society itself is one species of [1261a] community; and  the first thing necessary thereunto is a common place of habitation,  namely the city, which must be one, and this every citizen must have a  share in. But in a government which is to be well founded, will it be  best to admit of a community in everything which is capable thereof, or  only in some particulars, but in others not? for it is possible that the  citizens may have their wives, and children, and goods in common, as  in Plato's Commonwealth; for in that Socrates affirms that all these  particulars ought to be so. Which then shall we prefer? the custom which  is already established, or the laws which are proposed in that treatise?          CHAPTER II      Now as a community of wives is attended with many other difficulties, so  neither does the cause for which he would frame his government in this  manner seem agreeable to reason, nor is it capable of producing that end  which he has proposed, and for which he says it ought to take place; nor  has he given any particular directions for putting it in practice. Now  I also am willing to agree with Socrates in the principle which he  proceeds upon, and admit that the city ought to be one as much as  possible; and yet it is evident that if it is contracted too much, it  will be no longer a city, for that necessarily supposes a multitude; so  that if we proceed in this manner, we shall reduce a city to a family,  and a family to a single person: for we admit that a family is one in a  greater degree than a city, and a single person than a family; so that  if this end could be obtained, it should never be put in practice, as it  would annihilate the city; for a city does not only consist of a large  number of inhabitants, but there must also be different sorts; for were  they all alike, there could be no city; for a confederacy and a city are  two different things; for a confederacy is valuable from its numbers,  although all those who compose it are men of the same calling; for this  is entered into for the sake of mutual defence, as we add an additional  weight to make the scale go down. The same distinction prevails between  a city and a nation when the people are not collected into separate  villages, but live as the Arcadians. Now those things in which a city  should be one are of different sorts, and in preserving an alternate  reciprocation of power between these, the safety thereof consists (as  I have already mentioned in my treatise on Morals), for amongst freemen  and equals this is absolutely necessary; for all cannot govern at the  same time, but either by the year, or according to some other regulation  or time, by which means every one in his turn will be in office; as  if the shoemakers and carpenters should exchange occupations, and not  always be employed in the same calling. But as it is evidently better,  that these should continue to exercise their respective trades; so also  in civil society, where it is possible, it would be better that the  government should continue in the same hands; but where it [1261b] is  not (as nature has made all men equal, and therefore it is just, be the  administration good or bad, that all should partake of it), there it is  best to observe a rotation, and let those who are their equals by turns  submit to those who are at that time magistrates, as they will, in their  turns, alternately be governors and governed, as if they were different  men: by the same method different persons will execute different  offices. From hence it is evident, that a city cannot be one in the  manner that some persons propose; and that what has been said to be the  greatest good which it could enjoy, is absolutely its destruction, which  cannot be: for the good of anything is that which preserves it.  For another reason also it is clear, that it is not for the best  to endeavour to make a city too much one, because a family is more  sufficient in itself than a single person, a city than a family; and  indeed Plato supposes that a city owes its existence to that sufficiency  in themselves which the members of it enjoy. If then this sufficiency is  so desirable, the less the city is one the better.          CHAPTER III      But admitting that it is most advantageous for a city to be one as much  as possible, it does not seem to follow that this will take place by  permitting all at once to say this is mine, and this is not mine (though  this is what Socrates regards as a proof that a city is entirely one),  for the word All is used in two senses; if it means each individual,  what Socrates proposes will nearly take place; for each person will  say, this is his own son, and his own wife, and his own property, and  of everything else that may happen to belong to him, that it is his own.  But those who have their wives and children in common will not say so,  but all will say so, though not as individuals; therefore, to use the  word all is evidently a fallacious mode of speech; for this word is  sometimes used distributively, and sometimes collectively, on account  of its double meaning, and is the cause of inconclusive syllogisms in  reasoning. Therefore for all persons to say the same thing was their  own, using the word all in its distributive sense, would be well, but is  impossible: in its collective sense it would by no means contribute to  the concord of the state. Besides, there would be another inconvenience  attending this proposal, for what is common to many is taken least care  of; for all men regard more what is their own than what others share  with them in, to which they pay less attention than is incumbent on  every one: let me add also, that every one is more negligent of what  another is to see to, as well as himself, than of his own private  business; as in a family one is often worse served by many servants than  by a few. Let each citizen then in the state have a thousand children,  but let none of them be considered as the children of that individual,  but let the relation of father and child be common to them all, and they  will all be neglected. Besides, in consequence of this, [1262a] whenever  any citizen behaved well or ill, every person, be the number what it  would, might say, this is my son, or this man's or that; and in  this manner would they speak, and thus would they doubt of the whole  thousand, or of whatever number the city consisted; and it would be  uncertain to whom each child belonged, and when it was born, who was to  take care of it: and which do you think is better, for every one to say  this is mine, while they may apply it equally to two thousand or ten  thousand; or as we say, this is mine in our present forms of government,  where one man calls another his son, another calls that same person  his brother, another nephew, or some other relation, either by blood  or marriage, and first extends his care to him and his, while another  regards him as one of the same parish and the same tribe; and it is  better for any one to be a nephew in his private capacity than a son  after that manner. Besides, it will be impossible to prevent some  persons from suspecting that they are brothers and sisters, fathers and  mothers to each other; for, from the mutual likeness there is between  the sire and the offspring, they will necessarily conclude in what  relation they stand to each other, which circumstance, we are informed  by those writers who describe different parts of the world, does  sometimes happen; for in Upper Africa there are wives in common who  yet deliver their children to their respective fathers, being guided  by their likeness to them. There are also some mares and cows which  naturally bring forth their young so like the male, that we can easily  distinguish by which of them they were impregnated: such was the mare  called Just, in Pharsalia.          CHAPTER IV      Besides, those who contrive this plan of community cannot easily avoid  the following evils; namely, blows, murders involuntary or voluntary,  quarrels, and reproaches, all which it would be impious indeed to be  guilty of towards our fathers and mothers, or those who are nearly  related to us; though not to those who are not connected to us by any  tie of affinity: and certainly these mischiefs must necessarily happen  oftener amongst those who do not know how they are connected to each  other than those who do; and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6763"],[0,"Aristotle on the art of poetry (#9)"],[1,"'Truly ten thousand good deeds has Ulysses  wrought', where 'ten thousand', which is a particular large number,  is put in place of the generic 'a large number'. That from species to  species in 'Drawing the life with the bronze', and in 'Severing with the  enduring bronze'; where the poet uses 'draw' in the sense of 'sever' and  'sever' in that of 'draw', both words meaning to 'take away' something.  That from analogy is possible whenever there are four terms so related  that the second (B) is to the first (A), as the fourth (D) to the third  (C); for one may then metaphorically put B in lieu of D, and D in lieu  of B. Now and then, too, they qualify the metaphor by adding on to it  that to which the word it supplants is relative. Thus a cup (B) is  in relation to Dionysus (A) what a shield (D) is to Ares (C). The  cup accordingly will be metaphorically described as the 'shield _of  Dionysus_' (D + A), and the shield as the 'cup _of Ares_' (B + C). Or to  take another instance: As old age (D) is to life (C), so is evening (B)  to day (A). One will accordingly describe evening (B) as the 'old age  _of the day_' (D + A)--or by the Empedoclean equivalent; and old age (D)  as the 'evening' or 'sunset of life'' (B + C). It may be that some of  the terms thus related have no special name of their own, but for all  that they will be metaphorically described in just the same way. Thus to  cast forth seed-corn is called 'sowing'; but to cast forth its flame,  as said of the sun, has no special name. This nameless act (B), however,  stands in just the same relation to its object, sunlight (A), as sowing  (D) to the seed-corn (C). Hence the expression in the poet, 'sowing  around a god-created _flame_' (D + A). There is also another form of  qualified metaphor. Having given the thing the alien name, one may by a  negative addition deny of it one of the attributes naturally associated  with its new name. An instance of this would be to call the shield not  the 'cup _of Ares_,' as in the former case, but a 'cup _that holds no  wine_'. * * * A coined word is a name which, being quite unknown among  a people, is given by the poet himself; e.g. (for there are some words  that seem to be of this origin) _hernyges_ for horns, and _areter_ for  priest. A word is said to be lengthened out, when it has a short vowel  made long, or an extra syllable inserted; e. g. _polleos_ for _poleos_,  _Peleiadeo_ for _Peleidon_. It is said to be curtailed, when it has lost  a part; e.g. _kri_, _do_, and _ops_ in _mia ginetai amphoteron ops_.  It is an altered word, when part is left as it was and part is of the  poet's making; e.g. _dexiteron_ for _dexion_, in _dexiteron kata maxon_.    The Nouns themselves (to whatever class they may belong) are either  masculines, feminines, or intermediates (neuter). All ending in N, P,  S, or in the two compounds of this last, PS and X, are masculines. All  ending in the invariably long vowels, H and O, and in A among the vowels  that may be long, are feminines. So that there is an equal number of  masculine and feminine terminations, as PS and X are the same as S,  and need not be counted. There is no Noun, however, ending in a mute  or in either of the two short vowels, E and O. Only three (_meli, kommi,  peperi_) end in I, and five in T. The intermediates, or neuters, end in  the variable vowels or in N, P, X.          22      The perfection of Diction is for it to be at once clear and not mean.  The clearest indeed is that made up of the ordinary words for things,  but it is mean, as is shown by the poetry of Cleophon and Sthenelus. On  the other hand the Diction becomes distinguished and non-prosaic by  the use of unfamiliar terms, i.e. strange words, metaphors, lengthened  forms, and everything that deviates from the ordinary modes of  speech.--But a whole statement in such terms will be either a riddle or  a barbarism, a riddle, if made up of metaphors, a barbarism, if made  up of strange words. The very nature indeed of a riddle is this, to  describe a fact in an impossible combination of words (which cannot be  done with the real names for things, but can be with their metaphorical  substitutes); e.g. 'I saw a man glue brass on another with fire',  and the like. The corresponding use of strange words results in a  barbarism.--A certain admixture, accordingly, of unfamiliar terms  is necessary. These, the strange word, the metaphor, the ornamental  equivalent, etc.. will save the language from seeming mean and prosaic,  while the ordinary words in it will secure the requisite clearness. What  helps most, however, to render the Diction at once clear and non-prosaic  is the use of the lengthened, curtailed, and altered forms of words.  Their deviation from the ordinary words will, by making the language  unlike that in general use give it a non-prosaic appearance; and their  having much in common with the words in general use will give it the  quality of clearness. It is not right, then, to condemn these modes of  speech, and ridicule the poet for using them, as some have done; e.g.  the elder Euclid, who said it was easy to make poetry if one were to  be allowed to lengthen the words in the statement itself as much as  one likes--a procedure he caricatured by reading '_Epixarhon eidon  Marathonade Badi--gonta_, and _ouk han g' eramenos ton ekeinou helle  boron_ as verses. A too apparent use of these licences has certainly a  ludicrous effect, but they are not alone in that; the rule of moderation  applies to all the constituents of the poetic vocabulary; even with  metaphors, strange words, and the rest, the effect will be the same,  if one uses them improperly and with a view to provoking laughter. The  proper use of them is a very different thing. To realize the difference  one should take an epic verse and see how it reads when the normal words  are introduced. The same should be done too with the strange word, the  metaphor, and the rest; for one has only to put the ordinary words in  their place to see the truth of what we are saying. The same iambic, for  instance, is found in Aeschylus and Euripides, and as it stands in the  former it is a poor line; whereas Euripides, by the change of a single  word, the substitution of a strange for what is by usage the ordinary  word, has made it seem a fine one. Aeschylus having said in his  _Philoctetes_:     _phagedaina he mon sarkas hesthiei podos_    Euripides has merely altered the hesthiei here into thoinatai. Or  suppose     _nun de m' heon holigos te kai outidanos kai haeikos_    to be altered by the substitution of the ordinary words into     _nun de m' heon mikros te kai hasthenikos kai haeidos_    Or the line     _diphron haeikelion katatheis olingen te trapexan_    into     _diphron moxtheron katatheis mikran te trapexan_    Or heiones boosin into heiones kraxousin. Add to this that Ariphrades  used to ridicule the tragedians for introducing expressions unknown  in the language of common life, _doeaton hapo_ (for _apo domaton_),  _sethen_, _hego de nin_, _Achilleos peri_ (for _peri Achilleos_), and  the like. The mere fact of their not being in ordinary speech gives the  Diction a non-prosaic character; but Ariphrades was unaware of that. It  is a great thing, indeed, to make a proper use of these poetical forms,  as also of compounds and strange words. But the greatest thing by far  is to be a master of metaphor. It is the one thing that cannot be learnt  from others; and it is also a sign of genius, since a good metaphor  implies an intuitive perception of the similarity in dissimilars.    Of the kinds of words we have enumerated it may be observed that  compounds are most in place in the dithyramb, strange words in heroic,  and metaphors in iambic poetry. Heroic poetry, indeed, may avail itself  of them all. But in iambic verse, which models itself as far as possible  on the spoken language, only those kinds of words are in place which are  allowable also in an oration, i.e. the ordinary word, the metaphor, and  the ornamental equivalent.    Let this, then, suffice as an account of Tragedy, the art imitating by  means of action on the stage.          23      As for the poetry which merely narrates, or imitates by means of  versified language (without action), it is evident that it has several  points in common with Tragedy.    I. The construction of its stories should clearly be like that in a  drama; they should be based on a single action, one that is a complete  whole in itself, with a beginning, middle, and end, so as to enable the  work to produce its own proper pleasure with all the organic unity of a  living creature. Nor should one suppose that there is anything like them  in our usual histories. A history has to deal not with one action, but  with one period and all that happened in that to one or more persons,  however disconnected the several events may have been. Just as two  events may take place at the same time, e.g. the sea-fight off Salamis  and the battle with the Carthaginians in Sicily, without converging to  the same end, so too of two consecutive events one may sometimes come  after the other with no one end as their common issue. Nevertheless most  of our epic poets, one may say, ignore the distinction.    Herein, then, to repeat what we have said before, we have a further  proof of Homer's marvellous superiority to the rest. He did not attempt  to deal even with the Trojan war in its entirety, though it was a whole  with a definite beginning and end--through a feeling apparently that  it was too long a story to be taken in in one view, or if not that, too  complicated from the variety of incident in it. As it is, he has singled  out one section of the whole; many of the other incidents, however, he  brings in as episodes, using the Catalogue of the Ships, for instance,  and other episodes to relieve the uniformity of his narrative. As for  the other epic poets, they treat of one man, or one period; or else of  an"]]]
