But I'm going to do the best I can anyhow. Your Aunt  Olivia says I can have the job of gathering the eggs, and I'm to have  one egg out of every dozen to sell for myself.\"    Felicity made a similar bargain with her mother. The Story Girl and  Cecily were each to be paid ten cents a week for washing dishes in their  respective homes. Felix and Dan contracted to keep the gardens free from  weeds. I caught brook trout in the westering valley of spruces and sold  them for a cent apiece.    Sara Ray was the only unhappy one among us. She could do nothing. She  had no relatives in Carlisle except her mother, and her mother did not  approve of the school library project, and would not give Sara a cent,  or put her in any way of earning one. To Sara, this was humiliation  indescribable. She felt herself an outcast and an alien to our busy  little circle, where each member counted every day, with miserly  delight, his slowly increasing hoard of small cash.    \"I'm just going to pray to God to send me some money,\" she announced  desperately at last.    \"I don't believe that will do any good,\" said Dan. \"He gives lots of  things, but he doesn't give money, because people can earn that for  themselves.\"    \"I can't,\" said Sara, with passionate defiance. \"I think He ought to  take that into account.\"    \"Don't worry, dear,\" said Cecily, who always poured balm. \"If you can't  collect any money everybody will know it isn't your fault.\"    \"I won't ever feel like reading a single book in the library if I can't  give something to it,\" mourned Sara.    Dan and the girls and I were sitting in a row on Aunt Olivia's garden  fence, watching Felix weed. Felix worked well, although he did not like  weeding--\"fat boys never do,\" Felicity informed him. Felix pretended not  to hear her, but I knew he did, because his ears grew red. Felix's face  never blushed, but his ears always gave him away. As for Felicity, she  did not say things like that out of malice prepense. It never occurred  to her that Felix did not like to be called fat.    \"I always feel so sorry for the poor weeds,\" said the Story Girl  dreamily. \"It must be very hard to be rooted up.\"    \"They shouldn't grow in the wrong place,\" said Felicity mercilessly.    \"When weeds go to heaven I suppose they will be flowers,\" continued the  Story Girl.    \"You do think such queer things,\" said Felicity.    \"A rich man in Toronto has a floral clock in his garden,\" I said. \"It  looks just like the face of a clock, and there are flowers in it that  open at every hour, so that you can always tell the time.\"    \"Oh, I wish we had one here,\" exclaimed Cecily.    \"What would be the use of it?\" asked the Story Girl a little  disdainfully. \"Nobody ever wants to know the time in a garden.\"    I slipped away at this point, suddenly remembering that it was time to  take a dose of magic seed. I had bought it from Billy Robinson three  days before in school. Billy had assured me that it would make me grow  fast.    I was beginning to feel secretly worried because I did not grow. I had  overheard Aunt Janet say I was going to be short, like Uncle Alec. Now,  I loved Uncle Alec, but I wanted to be taller than he was. So when Billy  confided to me, under solemn promise of secrecy, that he had some \"magic  seed,\" which would make boys grow, and would sell me a box of it for ten  cents, I jumped at the offer. Billy was taller than any boy of his age  in Carlisle, and he assured me it all came from taking magic seed.    \"I was a regular runt before I begun,\" he said, \"and look at me now. I  got it from Peg Bowen. She's a witch, you know. I wouldn't go near her  again for a bushel of magic seed. It was an awful experience. I haven't  much left, but I guess I've enough to do me till I'm as tall as I want  to be. You must take a pinch of the seed every three hours, walking  backward, and you must never tell a soul you're taking it, or it won't  work. I wouldn't spare any of it to any one but you.\"    I felt deeply grateful to Billy, and sorry that I had not liked him  better. Somehow, nobody did like Billy Robinson over and above. But I  vowed I WOULD like him in future. I paid him the ten cents cheerfully  and took the magic seed as directed, measuring myself carefully every  day by a mark on the hall door. I could not see any advance in growth  yet, but then I had been taking it only three days.    One day the Story Girl had an inspiration.    \"Let us go and ask the Awkward Man and Mr. Campbell for a contribution  to the library fund,\" she said. \"I am sure no one else has asked them,  because nobody in Carlisle is related to them. Let us all go, and if  they give us anything we'll divide it equally among us.\"    It was a daring proposition, for both Mr. Campbell and the Awkward Man  were regarded as eccentric personages; and Mr. Campbell was supposed  to detest children. But where the Story Girl led we would follow to the  death. The next day being Saturday, we started out in the afternoon.    We took a short cut to Golden Milestone, over a long, green, dewy land  full of placid meadows, where sunshine had fallen asleep. At first all  was not harmonious. Felicity was in an ill humour; she had wanted to  wear her second best dress, but Aunt Janet had decreed that her school  clothes were good enough to go \"traipsing about in the dust.\" Then the  Story Girl arrived, arrayed not in any second best but in her very best  dress and hat, which her father had sent her from Paris--a dress of  soft, crimson silk, and a white leghorn hat encircled by flame-red  poppies. Neither Felicity nor Cecily could have worn it; but it became  the Story Girl perfectly. In it she was a thing of fire and laughter  and glow, as if the singular charm of her temperament were visible and  tangible in its vivid colouring and silken texture.    \"I shouldn't think you'd put on your best clothes to go begging for the  library in,\" said Felicity cuttingly.    \"Aunt Olivia says that when you are going to have an important interview  with a man you ought to look your very best,\" said the Story Girl,  giving her skirt a lustrous swirl and enjoying the effect.    \"Aunt Olivia spoils you,\" said Felicity.    \"She doesn't either, Felicity King! Aunt Olivia is just sweet. She  kisses me good-night every night, and your mother NEVER kisses you.\"    \"My mother doesn't make kisses so common,\" retorted Felicity. \"But she  gives us pie for dinner every day.\"    \"So does Aunt Olivia.\"    \"Yes, but look at the difference in the size of the pieces! And Aunt  Olivia only gives you skim milk. My mother gives us cream.\"    \"Aunt Olivia's skim milk is as good as your mother's cream,\" cried the  Story Girl hotly.    \"Oh, girls, don't fight,\" said Cecily, the peacemaker. \"It's such a nice  day, and we'll have a nice time if you don't spoil it by fighting.\"    \"We're NOT fighting,\" said Felicity. \"And I like Aunt Olivia. But my  mother is just as good as Aunt Olivia, there now!\"    \"Of course she is. Aunt Janet is splendid,\" agreed the Story Girl.    They smiled at each other amicably. Felicity and the Story Girl were  really quite fond of each other, under the queer surface friction that  commonly resulted from their intercourse.    \"You said once you knew a story about the Awkward Man,\" said Felix. \"You  might tell it to us.\"    \"All right,\" agreed the Story Girl. \"The only trouble is, I don't know  the whole story. But I'll tell you all I do know. I call it 'The Mystery  of the Golden Milestone.'\"    \"Oh, I don't believe that story is true,\" said Felicity. \"I believe Mrs.  Griggs was just romancing. She DOES romance, mother says.\"    \"Yes; but I don't believe she could ever have thought of such a thing  as this herself, so I believe it must be true,\" said the Story Girl.  \"Anyway, this is the story, boys. You know the Awkward Man has lived  alone ever since his mother died, ten years ago. Abel Griggs is his  hired man, and he and his wife live in a little house down the Awkward  Man's lane. Mrs. Griggs makes his bread for him, and she cleans up his  house now and then. She says he keeps it very neat. But till last fall  there was one room she never saw. It was always locked--the west one,  looking out over his garden. One day last fall the Awkward Man went to  Summerside, and Mrs. Griggs scrubbed his kitchen. Then she went over the  whole house and she tried the door of the west room. Mrs. Griggs is a  VERY curious woman. Uncle Roger says all women have as much curiosity  as is good for them, but Mrs. Griggs has more. She expected to find the  door locked as usual. It was NOT locked. She opened it and went in. What  do you suppose she found?\"    \"Something like--like Bluebeard's chamber?\" suggested Felix in a scared  tone.    \"Oh, no, NO! Nothing like THAT could happen in Prince Edward Island. But  if there HAD been beautiful wives hanging up by their hair all round the  walls I don't believe Mrs. Griggs could have been much more astonished.  The room had never been furnished in his mother's time, but now it was  ELEGANTLY furnished, though Mrs. Griggs says SHE doesn't know when or  how that furniture was brought there. She says she never saw a room  like it in a country farmhouse. It was like a bed-room and sitting-room  combined. The floor was covered with a carpet like green velvet. There  were fine lace curtains at the windows and beautiful pictures on the  walls. There was a little white bed, and a dressing-table, a bookcase  full of books, a stand with a work basket on it, and a rocking-chair.  There was a woman's picture above the bookcase. Mrs. Griggs says she  thinks it was a coloured photograph, but she didn't know who it was.  Anyway, it was a very pretty girl. But the most amazing thing of all was  that A"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53506"],[0,"A Collection of Kachári Folk-Tales and Rhymes (#9)"],[1,"as best you can.\" So the old man, seeing no other  way, went to seek for water. And after long search, seeing a tank,  he bound the old woman's eyes with a cloth and dragged her to the  water's edge and said to her \"Drink if you will, but look not upon  the tank.\" Now the ducks and other water fowls were playing in the  water, and were making a merry noise, clacking and quacking. And,  the old woman, being curious, like all her sex, peeped at them. And,  seeing them at their play, she too desired to be happy in her husband's  society, and, though he was very loth, prevailed with him. And so in  due course there were born to them many sons and daughters. And then,  in order to provide for their food, he journeyed to the Himalayas  and digged a great tank, stocked with many kinds of fishes.    Now, one day the god Sri, the god of good luck, came that way with  his white dog, ahunting for deer and hares and tortoises. And when  he came to the margin of the tank, behold he was very thirsty. But  when he stooped to drink, the fishes said to him eagerly that he must  grant them a boon in return for their water. To which he assented,  and when he had satisfied his thirst, the fishes said \"Take us to the  great river, the Brahmaputra (or Lohit).\" So the god Sri tied them  to his staff, and drew them after him, making runnels of water. And  that is how the rivers were made. And the fishes in return gave him a  pumpkin and a gourd. And, taking these with him to a friend's house,  his friend regaled him with rice beer and pig's flesh, and in the  morning he gave his friend the pumpkin. But when his friend cut open  the pumpkin, it contained nothing but pure silver. So he bade the  god Sri stay another day, and brewed fresh beer and killed another  pig, and when he was going away gave him a flitch of bacon to take  with him. So the god Sri gave him also the gourd. But when he cut  open the gourd, it contained nothing but pure gold. And so the god  Sri journeyed to his home. And when he got there, he found that his  little daughter was very ill. And that was because he had given away  the presents which the fishes had made him. But the fishes took pity  on him, and came to him in the guise of physicians, and told him  that if he would worship and do sacrifice on the banks of rivers,  then his daughter would be healed, which he did. And that is why we  Kacharis worship rivers. And that is all.            THE STORY OF THE LAZY BOY.    There was once a very lazy boy. And when everybody else had planted  out his paddy, he was only setting forth to plough. But the old man of  the season, [27] seeing him, said \"The season has gone; what are you  ploughing for now? The paddy is all planted out, and it is late.\" But  the boy would not listen to him, and ploughed sturdily ahead, beating  his cattle soundly as he went. And when the old man again and again  questioned him, he cried \"What sort of an old man is this? Can he not  see that I am busy? I know very well what I am about.\" But the old man  said gently \"Nay, my son: but it is for your good that I would speak  to you.\" And the boy said \"Speak quickly then, and have done with  it.\" And the old man said \"My son, the season is gone, what avails  it to plough now?\" And then the boy cried \"Where has it gone? And  when has it gone? And why has it gone? And how shall I find it?\" But  the old man of the season said \"You should have ploughed when others  did. The season has gone, and no man can bring it back.\" But the boy  said \"I must bring it back, else, how shall I eat, and how shall I  live? Do tell me where it is gone.\" And as he would not let the god go,  finally, losing patience, he said \"You go over there, and you will find  an old man with a snow-white head ploughing in a field. You get hold  of him and do as he tells you.\" So saying, he made his escape. Then  the lad hastened home to his mother and bade her cook supper quickly,  and tie him up some rice to take with him on the morrow, for he was  going to bring back the departed season for ploughing.    \"For\" said he \"when I was ploughing today, an old man told me that  the season was gone, and that if I went after him and pursued him I  would find him, and that I must do as he would tell me.\" So she rose  very early in the morning, and giving him to eat and drink, set him on  his way. And as he went, he asked all he met \"Can you tell me where  the old man of the season has gone?\" But they said \"Every one knows  that the season is gone, but where it has gone, or why it has gone,  who can say?\" At last, when he was nearly in despair, he saw an old  man ploughing afar off, and shouted to him \"Stay a moment, father,  stay; I want to ask you a question.\" But the old man was busy, and went  his ways. But the lad pursued him and never ceased calling after him  till at last the old man, losing patience, turned upon him, and said  \"What pertinacious noisy lad is this, who won't leave me alone?\" But  the lad said \"Be not angry, my father, I am fallen into great trouble,  and it behoves you to help me.\" \"Speak quickly, then,\" said the old  man. And the boy said \"I take you to be the old man of the season,  and I pray you not to slay me. All the others have planted out their  paddy, and I have fallen behind, and have planted nothing. Therefore,  unless you turn back, I cannot hope to get any harvest.\" But the old  man said \"It is too late for me to return. Go you back, and plant your  paddy as best you can.\" And so the lad hastened back and planted out  his seedlings in such heedless haste as became him. And that's all!            THE SEVEN CHAMPIONS.    An old man and an old woman had a son. But the father died while his  son was yet a child, and the mother brought up her boy by begging  from house to house. When he was big enough he begged his mother to  let him engage himself as a cowherd. But she said \"As long as I live,  I must not let you undergo any trouble.\" But the gallant boy would not  listen, and went and took service as a cowherd. But the other cowherd  boys would not let him go out herding with them, and hated him, and  beat him, in spite of the help of a good old man who took him into  his house, so, being unable to stay any longer for grief and vexation,  he went away into foreign lands.    And as he went his ways, he met Simli Bîr, the hero of the simul tree,  and when he saw him he said \"Ah! here is a hero indeed, seeing that  you bear a whole silk-cotton tree on your shoulder.\" But the other  replied \"Whom do you call a hero? I am no hero at all. If you want a  real hero, look out for Gilâ Charan.\" But the lad said \"As for Gilâ  Charan, why, I am Gilâ Charan.\" On which Simli Bîr got leave to go with  him. And as they went they met Dhop Bîr, and to him they said \"You are  something like a hero. Why, you are carrying a whole dhop tree all by  yourself.\" But the other said \"My brothers, of what account am I? The  man they call Gilâ Charan, he is a hero if you like.\" Then Gilâ Charan  said \"But I am he.\" On which Dhop Bîr said \"Let me come with you too.\"    And, so saying, he too joined the party. And in like manner they  were joined by other four champions, namely, Mustard, Monkey, Ocean,  and Fire, six in all, besides Gilâ Charan.    And when they had gone some way, one of them went into the house  of a Râkshashani to beg fire for cooking. But when the old wretch  saw that it was a man, she desired to devour him, and to that end  lay still, pretending to be ill, and said to him in a weak voice  \"The fire is quite close to me. Come and blow it up!\" and when he  came close, she gave him a kick and sent him flying into a pit;  and, seeing that he did not come, another champion went on the same  quest and was treated in like fashion. Then Gilâ Charan guessed that  something out of the way had happened, and went there himself; and,  perceiving that the old woman was a vampire, took her by the throat  and shook her well. But she cried \"Do not kill me, and I will show  you where your friends are.\" Then the old woman got a ladder and  released the two champions from the pit. Whereupon they killed her,  and went on their way rejoicing.    And presently they came to a place where Rakshashas dwelt. But,  not knowing this, they left Simli Bîr to cook rice and the rest went  hunting. And when the rice was ready, two Rakshashas came and gobbled  it up, so when the rest returned, hungry, for food, Simlî Bîr said  he was very sorry. He had quite forgotten to cook, being very busy  watching a beautiful white butterfly. But Gilâ Charan at once saw  that was only a pretext. So he bid the rest go, and, staying behind,  himself cooked rice afresh. On which the two Rakshashas came up  roaring, and said \"Here, my son, hand over that rice.\" \"But,\" said  Gilâ Charan, undaunted, \"we are hungry ourselves and have no rice to  spare!\" \"What!\" cried they \"shall a scarcely weaned child speak to  us like this?\" and they ran at him to eat him. But he seized them by  their necks and threw them a field's length. And when they attacked  him afresh, he slew them with his sword. And in like manner each  of the Bîrs slew each his Rakshasha, and then each married a fair  Rakshasha girl, and lived happily ever afterwards. And that's all!            THE STORY OF THE MERCHANT'S SON.    There was a lad whose father died while he was a child. And when, by  slow degrees, he came to man's estate, he asked his mother one day how  his father got a living. But she heaved a long sigh, and at last said  \"Your father traded in foreign countries, my dear; and if he were alive  now, we would not be in such distress now.\" But he said \"Ah! mother,  may not I work at the same trade? Give me all the money there is, and  let me too go trading.\" But his mother said \"Nay! my son, do not say  that. While I live, even if I have to beg, you shall not want. And if  you die in strange lands, what is to become of me?\" But her son would  not hearken to her, and, begging money from"]]]
