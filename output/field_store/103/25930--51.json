Even the able-bodied men are generally unfit for promoting the prosperity  of the colony. A very large proportion of them are slaves, just liberated.  Accustomed to be ruled and taken care of by others, they are no better  than mere children, as respects the conduct and economy of life. In  America, their clothes, food, medicines, and all other necessaries, have  been furnished without a thought on their own part; and when sent to  Liberia, with high notions of freedom and exemption from labor (ideas  which with many are synonymous), they prove totally inadequate to sustain  themselves. I perceive, in Colonization reports, that the owners of slaves  frequently offer to liberate them, on condition of their being sent to  Liberia; and that the Society has contracted debts, and embarrassed itself  in various ways, rather than let such offers pass. In my opinion, many of  the slaves, thus offered, are of little value to the donors, and of even  less to the cause of Colonization. Better to discriminate carefully in the  selection of emigrants, than to send out such numbers of the least  eligible class, to become burdens upon the industrious and intelligent,  who might otherwise enjoy comfort and independence. Many a colonist, at  this moment, sacrifices his interest to his humanity, and feels himself  kept back in life by the urgent claims of compassion.    The Society allows to new emigrants provisions for six months. After that  period, if unable to take care of themselves, they must either starve, or  be supported by the charitable. Fifty young or middle-aged men, who had  been accustomed to self-guidance in America, would do more to promote the  prosperity of the colony, than five hundred such emigrants as are usually  sent out. The thievish propensity of many of the poor and indolent  colonists is much complained of by the industrious. On this account, more  than any other, it is difficult to raise stock. The vice has been acquired  in America, and is not forgotten in Africa.    13.--A rainy morning. Last night we were all roused from sleep by the sea  coming into the starboard air-ports. We of the larboard side laughed at  the misfortune of our comrades, and closed our own ports, without taking  the precaution to screw them in. Half an hour afterwards, a very heavy  swell assailed us on the larboard, beat in all the loose ports, and  deluged the rooms. I found myself suddenly awakened and cooled by a  cataract of water pouring over me. Out jumped the larboard sleepers, in  dripping night-gear, and shouted lustily for lights, buckets, and swabs;  while the starboard gentlemen laughed long and loud, in their turn.    14.--Sailed for the leeward.    17.--Beautiful weather. This afternoon all hands were called to shorten  sail, in those earnest, startling tones, which are prompted by the sense  of danger alone. Every man sprang to his station with the instinctive  readiness of disciplined seamen. The idlers were all on deck, and looked  about for the cause. Had a man fallen overboard? No! Nor was there any  particular appearance of a squall. But the earnest gaze of the commander  and a passenger, towards the shore, drew all eyes in the same direction;  and, behold! a smoke was seen rising from the land, which had been  mistaken for the cloud that precedes the tornado. It is necessary to  prepare for many blows that do not come. In the tornado-seasons (which may  be estimated at four or five weeks, about the months of March and  November), there are frequent appearances of squalls, sometimes as often  as twice or thrice in twenty-four hours. The horizon grows black, with  very much the aspect of a thunder-shower in America. Generally, the  violence of the wind does not equal the apprehensions always entertained.  We could have carried royals through nineteen out of twenty of the  tornadoes that assailed our ship; but the twentieth might have taken the  sticks out of us. The harmless, as well as the heavy tornadoes, have the  same black and threatening aspect. They usually blow from the land,  although once, while at anchor, we experienced one from seaward.    19.--Anchored at Cape Palmas. This colony is independent, of Liberia  proper, and is under the jurisdiction and patronage of the Maryland State  Colonization Society. Its title is Maryland in Liberia. The local  government is composed of an agent and an assistant agent, both to be  appointed by the Society at home, for two years; a secretary, to be  appointed by the agent annually; and a vice-agent, two counsellors, a  register, a sheriff, a treasurer, and a committee on new emigrants, to be  chosen by the people. Several minor officers are appointed by the agent,  who is entrusted with great powers. The judiciary consists of the agent,  and a competent number of justices of the peace, who are appointed by him,  and two of whom, together with the agent, constitute the Supreme Court. A  single justice has jurisdiction in small criminal cases, and in all civil  cases where the claim does not exceed twenty dollars.    Male colored people, at twenty years of age, are entitled to vote, if they  hold land in their own right, or pay a tax of one dollar. Every emigrant  must sign a pledge to support the constitution, and to refrain from the  use of ardent spirits, except in case of sickness. By a provision of the  constitution, emigration is never to be prohibited.    Our boat attempted to land at some rocks, just outside of the port, in  order to avoid crossing the bar; but as the tide was low, and the surf  troublesome, we found it impracticable. I hate a bar; there is no fair  play about it. The long rollers come in from the sea, and, in consequence  of the shallowness of the water, seem to pile themselves up so as  inevitably to overwhelm you, unless you have skilful rowers, a good  helmsman, and a lively boat. At one moment, your keel, perhaps, touches  the sand; the next, you are lifted upon a wave and borne swiftly along for  many yards, while the men lie on their oars, or only pull an occasional  stroke, to keep the boat's head right. Now they give way with a will, to  escape a white-crested wave that comes trembling and roaring after them;  and now again they cease rowing, or back water, awaiting a favorable  moment to cross. Should you get into a trough of the sea, you stand a very  pretty chance to be swamped, and have your boat rolled over and over upon  its crew; while, perchance, a hungry shark may help himself to a leg or  arm.    Pulling across this ugly barrier, we landed at the only wharf of which the  colony can boast. There is here a stone warehouse, but of no great size.  In front of it lay a large log, some thirty feet long, on which twelve or  fourteen full grown natives were roosting, precisely like turkeys on a  pole. They are accustomed to sit for hours together in this position,  resting upon their heels. A girl presented us with a note, informing all  whom it might concern, that Mrs. ---- would do our washing; but, as the  ship's stay was to be short, we turned our attention to the cattle, of  which a score or two were feeding in the vicinity. They are small, but,  having been acclimated, are sleek and well-conditioned. As I have before  observed, it is a well-established fact, that all four-footed emigrants  are not less subject to the coast fever than bipeds. Horses, cattle, and  even fowls, whether imported or brought from the interior to the coast,  speedily sicken, and often die.    I dined with Mr. Russwurm, the colonial agent, a man of distinguished  ability and of collegiate education. He gave me, some monkey-skins and  other curiosities, and favored me with much information respecting the  establishment. The mean temperature of the place is eighty degrees of  Fahrenheit, which is something less than that of Monrovia, on account of  its being more open to the sea. The colony comprises six hundred and fifty  inhabitants, all of whom dwell within four miles of the Cape. Besides the  settlement of Harper, situated on the Cape itself, there is that of Mount  Tubman (named in honor of Mr. T. of Georgia), which lies beyond Mount  Vaughan, and three and a half miles from Cape Palmas. There is no road to  the interior of the country, except a native path. The agent, with a party  of twenty, recently penetrated about seventy miles into the Bush, passing  through two tribes, and coming to a third, of large numbers and strength.  The king of the latter tribe has a large town, where many manufactures are  carried on, such as iron implements and wooden furniture of various kinds.  He refused Mr. Russwurm an escort, alleging that there was war, but sent  his son to the coast, to see the _black-white_ people and their  improvements.    A large native tribe, the Grebo, dwells at Cape Palmas in the midst of the  colonists. Their conical huts, to the number of some hundreds, present the  most interesting part of the scene. Opposite the town, upon an uninhabited  island at no great distance, the dead are exposed, clad in their best  apparel, and furnished with food, cloth, crockery, and other articles. A  canoe is placed over the body. This island of the dead is called by a  name, which, in the plainest of English, signifies \"Go-to-Hell;\" a  circumstance that seems to imply very gloomy anticipations as to the fate  of their deceased brethren, on the part of these poor Grebos. As a badge  of mourning, they wear cloth of dark blue, instead of gayer colors. Dark  blue is universally, along the coast, the hue indicative of mourning.    The Fishmen, at Cape Palmas, as well as at most other places on the coast,  refuse to sell fish to be eaten on board of vessels, believing that the  remains of the dead fish will frighten away the living ones.    21.--Sailed at 5 o'clock A.M., with a good wind, and anchored at Sinoe at  6 P.M.          CHAPTER VI.    Settlement"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7947"],[0,"The Diary of a U-boat Commander (#9)"],[1," sneering  expression on his face. The navigator, who is quite a decent youngster,  though of no family, was, I could plainly see, struck by my  development, and asked to be initiated into the series of exercises. I  agreed willingly enough to show them to him. I will confess I wish Zoe  could have seen me as I perspired with healthy exercise.    At about 11 a.m. a couple of masts, then two more, then another,  appeared above the horizon. The visibility was extreme, so we at once  dived and proceeded at full speed, ten metres.    We had been going thus for perhaps half an hour when Alten remarked  that he would have another look at the convoy. We eased speed, came up  to six metres, and Alten proceeded up into the conning tower to use \"A\"  periscope.    He had hardly applied his eye to the lens when he sharply ordered the  boat to ten metres, accompanying this order with another to the motor  room demanding utmost speed (_Ausserste Kraft_). I went up to the  conning tower and found him white with excitement.    \"Look!\" he exclaimed, pointing to the periscope, entirely forgetful of  the fact that we were at ten metres. I looked, and of course saw  nothing; furious at the trick I considered he had played on me I turned  on him, to be disarmed by his apology.    \"Sorry! I forgot! The whole British battle cruiser force is there.\"    It was now my turn to be excited, and I rushed down to the motor room  determined to give her every amp she would take. The port foremost  motor was sparking like the devil, rings of cursed sparks shooting  round the commutator, but this was no time for ceremony. I relentlessly  ordered the field current to be still further reduced.    We were actually running with an F.C. of 3.75 amps, [1] for a period,  when the sparking assumed the appearance of a ring of fire and, fearing  a commutator strip would melt, I ordered an F.C. of five amps.    [Footnote 1: The lower the field current the faster the motor goes.  3.75 is almost incredibly low for a motor of this type--at least  according to British practice.--ETIENNE.]    We thus passed a quarter of an hour full of strain, the tension of  which was reflected in the attitude of all the men. Alten had announced  his intention of using the stern torpedo tube after his failure in the  morning, and the crew of this tube were crouched at their stations like  a gun's crew in the last few seconds preparatory to opening fire. The  switchboard attendants gripped the regulating rheostatts as if by their  personal efforts they could urge the boat on faster. Old Schmitt, at  the helm, never lifted his eyes from the compass repeater.    At length: \"Slow both!\" \"Bring her to six metres!\" came from the  conning tower, to which place I proceeded to hear the news.    Slowly the periscope was raised and I held my breath; a groan came from  Alten and he turned away. For a fraction of a second I was almost  pleased at his obvious pain, then, sick with disappointment, I took his  place.    Yes! it was all over. There they were, and with hungry eyes and  depressed heart I saw five great battle cruisers, of which I recognized  the _Tiger_ with her three great funnels, the _Princess Royal_, _Lion_  and two others, zigzagging along at 25 knots, at a distance of 12,000  metres, across our bow.    They were surrounded by a numerous screen of destroyers and light  cruisers, the former at that range through the periscope appearing as  black smudges.    It is not often one is permitted such a spectacle in modern war, and I  could not tear myself away from the sight of those great brutes, whom I  had fought when in the _Derflingger_ at Dogger Bank and again when in  the _Koenig_ at Jutland. So near and yet so far, and as they rapidly  drew away so did all the visions of an Iron Cross. As soon as they were  out of sight, we surfaced in order to report what we had seen to  Zeebrugge and Heligoland.    Everything seemed against us. I had gone on the bridge with the  navigator; Alten, with a face as black as hell, had gone to the  wardroom. About ten minutes elapsed when I heard a fearful altercation  going on below. I stepped down to find the young wireless operator  trembling in front of Alten, who was overwhelming him with a flood of  abuse. As I reached the wardroom, Alten shook his fist in the man's  face and bellowed:    \"Make the d---- thing work, I tell you.\"    \"Impossible, Captain, the main condenser----\" the man began.    Purple with rage, Alten seized a heavy pair of parallel rulers, and  before I could check him hurled them full in the operator's face.  Bleeding copiously, the youth fell to the deck in a stunned condition.    It was then, for the first time, that I noticed a half-empty bottle of  spirits on the table, which colossal quantity he must have consumed in  about a quarter of an hour.    Turning to me, this semi-madman pointed to the wireless operator with  his foot and growled:    \"Have him removed.\"    This I did, and then, lowering the periscope, I ordered the boat to  fifteen metres. We proceeded at this depth until 8 p.m., when I was  informed that the Captain was in his bunk and wished to see me.    I discovered him with his face to the ship's side, and upon my  reporting myself he ordered me, firstly to throw that blasted bottle  overboard (an unnecessary proceeding, as it was empty), and secondly to  surface and shape course for Zeebrugge.    At midnight he relieved me, apparently perfectly normal.    The wireless operator has been laid up all day and has a nasty cut on  the head. The navigator, a great scandal-monger, has heard from the  engineer that Alten was speaking to him alone this morning, and the  engineer believes that Alten has given him five hundred marks to say he  fell down a hatch.    Hooray! Blankenberg buoy has just been reported in sight! Soon I shall  see my Zoe!           *       *       *       *       *    With what high hopes did I write the last few lines a few hours ago,  and how they were dashed to the ground, for on going into the Mess at  Bruges I found amongst my letters a note from her, which was terrible  in its brevity. She simply said:      \"DEAR KARL,    \"I am going away for some days, and as I shall be travelling it is no  good giving you an address. To our next meeting!    \"ZOE.\"      How horribly vague; not an indication of her destination, her object,  or the probable length of her absence. Of course I rushed round to the  flat, but found the place shut up. The porter told me she had gone away  with her maid. He couldn't say when she'd be back--if at all! I gave  him ten marks, and he said she might be away a fortnight. If I'd given  him twenty he'd have said a week; he obviously didn't know.    I feel I could do anything to-night; any mad, evil thing would appeal  to me.    There is a most fearful uproar coming from the guest-room, where a  large and rowdy party are entertaining the chorus of a travelling  _revue_ company. I saw them when they arrived, horribly common-looking  women, with legs like mine tubes.           *       *       *       *       *    Another day and still no news; I don't know how I shall stick it. She  might have had the softness of heart to write to me. She knows my  address.    This evening a letter from the little mother, who asks whether I can  find time to go to Frankfurt when I have leave; at the end of the  letter she mentions that Rosa has joined the Women's Voluntary  Auxiliary Corps of Army Nurses. I suppose she thought she'd like her  photograph taken in some fancy uniform as \"Rosa Freinland, one of our  Frankfurt beauties, now on war work!\" Holding the patient's hand is  about the only work she intends doing.    Women as a class are the same the world over. We are well supplied with  English papers in the Mess here; they come regularly from Amsterdam,  and in their pages I see, just as in ours, pictures of the Countess  this and the Lord that, photographed in becoming attitudes doing war  work. It seems agricultural pursuits are the fashion in England at  present--wait till our U-boat war gets its knife well into their fat  guts, it will be more than fashionable to work in the fields then.    The British Empire is undeniably a great creation, or rather not so  much a creation as a thing arrived at accidentally, but it lacks  solidarity. It sprawls, a confused mass of races and creeds, around the  world. Its very immensity lays it open to attack, it has a dozen  Achilles heels from Ireland to Egypt and South Africa to India.    I met a man only yesterday who was recently at the propaganda  department of the Foreign Office, and without going into details he  gave me a very good idea of the good work that is going on in Britain's  canker spots.    Ireland is considered particularly promising to those in the know.    Now for an agitated night! To think that a girl should disturb me so!           *       *       *       *       *    Two days have passed, or, rather, dragged their interminable lengths  away, for there is still not a vestige of news. I have been twice to  the flat with no result, except to receive a piece of impertinence from  the porter the last time I was there.    No news.           *       *       *       *       *    Still no news, and we sail in forty-eight hours.          _At sea, off the Isle of Wight_.      It is some days since I turned for solace and enjoyment, amidst the  discomforts of this life, to my pen and notebook.    What strange tricks fate plays with us, and how lucky it is that one  cannot foresee the future.    Here I am in U.39--but I must start at the beginning. My last entry was  the depressing one of still no news. Well, I have had news, but it was  like a drop of water in the mouth of a parched-up man. Another  agonizing twenty-four hours passed, and I was sitting in my room about  ten o'clock, trying to resign myself to the idea that the next night I  should be starting out for my third trip without news of her, when the"]]]
