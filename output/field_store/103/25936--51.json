Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done             so?    10:016:011 And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my             son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much             more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him             curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.    10:016:012 It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that             the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.    10:016:013 And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on             the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and             threw stones at him, and cast dust.    10:016:014 And the king, and all the people that were with him, came             weary, and refreshed themselves there.    10:016:015 And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to             Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.    10:016:016 And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend,             was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save             the king, God save the king.    10:016:017 And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy             friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?    10:016:018 And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this             people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and             with him will I abide.    10:016:019 And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the             presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's             presence, so will I be in thy presence.    10:016:020 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what             we shall do.    10:016:021 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's             concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all             Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then             shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.    10:016:022 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and             Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of             all Israel.    10:016:023 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those             days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so             was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with             Absalom.    10:017:001 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out             twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David             this night:    10:017:002 And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed,             and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him             shall flee; and I will smite the king only:    10:017:003 And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom             thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be             in peace.    10:017:004 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of             Israel.    10:017:005 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let             us hear likewise what he saith.    10:017:006 And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,             saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do             after his saying? if not; speak thou.    10:017:007 And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath             given is not good at this time.    10:017:008 For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that             they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a             bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a             man of war, and will not lodge with the people.    10:017:009 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and             it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the             first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a             slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.    10:017:010 And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a             lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy             father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant             men.    10:017:011 Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto             thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the             sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own             person.    10:017:012 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be             found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the             ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there             shall not be left so much as one.    10:017:013 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel             bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river,             until there be not one small stone found there.    10:017:014 And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of             Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.             For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of             Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon             Absalom.    10:017:015 Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus             and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of             Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.    10:017:016 Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not             this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass             over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that             are with him.    10:017:017 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not             be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them;             and they went and told king David.    10:017:018 Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went             both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in             Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went             down.    10:017:019 And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's             mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not             known.    10:017:020 And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house,             they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said             unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they             had sought and could not find them, they returned to             Jerusalem.    10:017:021 And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came             up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said             unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus             hath Ahithophel counselled against you.    10:017:022 Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and             they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not             one of them that was not gone over Jordan.    10:017:023 And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he             saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to             his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself,             and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.    10:017:024 Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan,             he and all the men of Israel with him.    10:017:025 And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab:             which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an             Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash,             sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.    10:017:026 So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.    10:017:027 And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that             Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon,             and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the             Gileadite of Rogelim,    10:017:028 Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and             barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles,             and parched pulse,    10:017:029 And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for             David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they             said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the             wilderness.    10:018:001 And David numbered the people that were with him, and set             captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.    10:018:002 And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand             of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of             Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of             Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will             surely go forth with you myself also.    10:018:003 But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we             flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us             die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten             thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour             us out of the city.    10:018:004 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do.             And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came             out by hundreds and by thousands.    10:018:005 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying,             Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.             And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains             charge concerning Absalom.    10:018:006 So the people"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8018"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 18: Job (#9)"],[1,"valleys, in caves of the earth,             and in the rocks.    18:030:007 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were             gathered together.    18:030:008 They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they             were viler than the earth.    18:030:009 And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.    18:030:010 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in             my face.    18:030:011 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have             also let loose the bridle before me.    18:030:012 Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and             they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.    18:030:013 They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no             helper.    18:030:014 They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the             desolation they rolled themselves upon me.    18:030:015 Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind:             and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.    18:030:016 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction             have taken hold upon me.    18:030:017 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews             take no rest.    18:030:018 By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it             bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.    18:030:019 He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and             ashes.    18:030:020 I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and             thou regardest me not.    18:030:021 Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou             opposest thyself against me.    18:030:022 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon             it, and dissolvest my substance.    18:030:023 For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house             appointed for all living.    18:030:024 Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though             they cry in his destruction.    18:030:025 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul             grieved for the poor?    18:030:026 When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I             waited for light, there came darkness.    18:030:027 My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction             prevented me.    18:030:028 I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in             the congregation.    18:030:029 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.    18:030:030 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.    18:030:031 My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the             voice of them that weep.    18:031:001 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon             a maid?    18:031:002 For what portion of God is there from above? and what             inheritance of the Almighty from on high?    18:031:003 Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to             the workers of iniquity?    18:031:004 Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?    18:031:005 If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to             deceit;    18:031:006 Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine             integrity.    18:031:007 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked             after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;    18:031:008 Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be             rooted out.    18:031:009 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid             wait at my neighbour's door;    18:031:010 Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down             upon her.    18:031:011 For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be             punished by the judges.    18:031:012 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root             out all mine increase.    18:031:013 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my             maidservant, when they contended with me;    18:031:014 What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth,             what shall I answer him?    18:031:015 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one             fashion us in the womb?    18:031:016 If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused             the eyes of the widow to fail;    18:031:017 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath             not eaten thereof;    18:031:018 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a             father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)    18:031:019 If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor             without covering;    18:031:020 If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed             with the fleece of my sheep;    18:031:021 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw             my help in the gate:    18:031:022 Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be             broken from the bone.    18:031:023 For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of             his highness I could not endure.    18:031:024 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold,             Thou art my confidence;    18:031:025 If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine             hand had gotten much;    18:031:026 If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in             brightness;    18:031:027 And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath             kissed my hand:    18:031:028 This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I             should have denied the God that is above.    18:031:029 If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or             lifted up myself when evil found him:    18:031:030 Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to             his soul.    18:031:031 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his             flesh! we cannot be satisfied.    18:031:032 The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my             doors to the traveller.    18:031:033 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine             iniquity in my bosom:    18:031:034 Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families             terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?    18:031:035 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the             Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written             a book.    18:031:036 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a             crown to me.    18:031:037 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince             would I go near unto him.    18:031:038 If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise             thereof complain;    18:031:039 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have             caused the owners thereof to lose their life:    18:031:040 Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of             barley. The words of Job are ended.    18:032:001 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was             righteous in his own eyes.    18:032:002 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the             Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath             kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.    18:032:003 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because             they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.    18:032:004 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were             elder than he.    18:032:005 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these             three men, then his wrath was kindled.    18:032:006 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I             am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and             durst not shew you mine opinion.    18:032:007 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach             wisdom.    18:032:008 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the             Almighty giveth them understanding.    18:032:009 Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand             judgment.    18:032:010 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine             opinion.    18:032:011 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons,             whilst ye searched out what to say.    18:032:012 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you             that convinced Job, or that answered his words:    18:032:013 Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth             him down, not man.    18:032:014 Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I             answer him with your speeches.    18:032:015 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off             speaking.    18:032:016 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and             answered no more;)    18:032:017 I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine             opinion.    18:032:018 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.    18:032:019 Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to             burst like new bottles.    18:032:020 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and             answer.    18:032:021 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let             me give flattering titles unto man.    18:032:022 For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker             would soon take me away.    18:033:001 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to             all my words.    18:033:002 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue "]]]
