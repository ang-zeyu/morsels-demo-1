God made it  years ago. All the blackbirds used to sing it when I was young. It  was new then.\"          THE MESSENGERS      One wandering nigh Parnassus chasing hares heard the high Muses.    \"Take us a message to the Golden Town.\"    Thus sang the Muses.    But the man said: \"They do not call to me. Not to such as me speak  the Muses.\"    And the Muses called him by name.    \"Take us a message,\" they said, \"to the Golden Town.\"    And the man was downcast for he would have chased hares.    And the Muses called again.    And when whether in valleys or on high crags of the hills he still  heard the Muses he went at last to them and heard their message,  though he would fain have left it to other men and chased the fleet  hares still in happy valleys.    And they gave him a wreath of laurels carved out of emeralds as  only the Muses can carve. \"By this,\" they said, \"they shall know that  you come from the Muses.\"    And the man went from that place and dressed in scarlet silks  as befitted one that came from the high Muses. And through the  gateway of the Golden Town he ran and cried his message, and his  cloak floated behind him. All silent sat the wise men and the aged,  they of the Golden Town; cross-legged they sat before their houses  reading from parchments a message of the Muses that they sent long  before.    And the young man cried his message from the Muses.    And they rose up and said: \"Thou art not from the Muses. Otherwise  spake they.\" And they stoned him and he died.    And afterwards they carved his message upon gold; and read it in  their temples on holy days.    When will the Muses rest? When are they weary? They sent  another messenger to the Golden Town. And they gave him a  wand of ivory to carry in his hand with all the beautiful stories of  the world wondrously carved thereon. And only the Muses could  have carved it. \"By this,\" they said, \"they shall know that you come  from the Muses.\"    And he came through the gateway of the Golden Town with the  message he had for its people. And they rose up at once in the  Golden street, they rose from reading the message that they had  carved upon gold. \"The last who came,\" they said, \"came with a  wreath of laurels carved out of emeralds, as only the Muses can  carve. You are not from the Muses.\" And even as they had stoned  the last so also they stoned him. And afterwards they carved his  message on gold and laid it up in their temples.    When will the Muses rest? When are they weary? Even yet once  again they sent a messenger under the gateway into the Golden  Town. And for all that he wore a garland of gold that the high Muses  gave him, a garland of kingcups soft and yellow on his head, yet  fashioned of pure gold and by whom but the Muses, yet did they  stone him in the Golden Town. But they had the message, and what  care the Muses?    And yet they will not rest, for some while since I heard them call to me.    \"Go take our message,\" they said, \"unto the Golden Town.\"    But I would not go. And they spake a second time. \"Go take our  message,\" they said.    And still I would not go, and they cried out a third time: \"Go take  our message.\"    And though they cried a third time I would not go. But morning and  night they cried and through long evenings.    When will the Muses rest? When are they weary? And when they  would not cease to call to me I went to them and I said: \"The  Golden Town is the Golden Town no longer. They have sold their  pillars for brass and their temples for money, they have made coins  out of their golden doors. It is become a dark town full of trouble,  there is no ease in its streets, beauty has left it and the old songs are  gone.\"    \"Go take our message,\" they cried.    And I said to the high Muses: \"You do not understand. You have  no message for the Golden Town, the holy city no longer.\"    \"Go take our message,\" they cried.    \"What is your message?\" I said to the high Muses.    And when I heard their message I made excuses, dreading to speak  such things in the Golden Town; and again they bade me go.    And I said: \"I will not go. None will believe me.\"    And still the Muses cry to me all night long.    They do not understand. How should they know?          THE THREE TALL SONS      And at last Man raised on high the final glory of his civilization,  the towering edifice of the ultimate city.    Softly beneath him in the deeps of the earth purred his machinery  fulfilling all his needs, there was no more toil for man. There he sat  at ease discussing the Sex Problem.    And sometimes painfully out of forgotten fields, there came to his  outer door, came to the furthest rampart of the final glory of Man,  a poor old woman begging. And always they turned her away.  This glory of Man's achievement, this city was not for her.    It was Nature that came thus begging in from the fields, whom they  always turned away.    And away she went again alone to her fields.    And one day she came again, and again they sent her hence. But  her three tall sons came too.    \"These shall go in,\" she said. \"Even these my sons to your city.\"    And the three tall sons went in.    And these are Nature's sons, the forlorn one's terrible children,  War, Famine and Plague.    Yea and they went in there and found Man unawares in his city  still poring over his Problems, obsessed with his civilization, and  never hearing their tread as those three came up behind.          COMPROMISE      They built their gorgeous home, their city of glory, above the lair  of the earthquake. They built it of marble and gold in the shining  youth of the world. There they feasted and fought and called their  city immortal, and danced and sang songs to the gods. None heeded  the earthquake in all those joyous streets. And down in the deeps  of the earth, on the black feet of the abyss, they that would conquer  Man mumbled long in the darkness, mumbled and goaded the  earthquake to try his strength with that city, to go forth blithely at  night and to gnaw its pillars like bones. And down in those grimy  deeps the earthquake answered them, and would not do their  pleasure and would not stir from thence, for who knew who they  were who danced all day where he rumbled, and what if the lords  of that city that had no fear of his anger were haply even the gods!    And the centuries plodded by, on and on round the world, and one  day they that had danced, they that had sung in that city, remembered  the lair of the earthquake in the deeps down under their feet, and made  plans one with another and sought to avert the danger, sought to  appease the earthquake and turn his anger away.    They sent down singing girls, and priests with oats and wine, they  sent down garlands and propitious berries, down by dark steps to  the black depths of the earth, they sent peacocks newly slain, and  boys with burning spices, and their thin white sacred cats with collars  of pearls all newly drawn from sea, they sent huge diamonds down in  coffers of teak, and ointment and strange oriental dyes, arrows and  armor and the rings of their queen.    \"Oho,\" said the earthquake in the coolth of the earth, \"so they are  not the gods.\"          WHAT WE HAVE COME TO      When the advertiser saw the cathedral spires over the downs in the  distance, he looked at them and wept.    \"If only,\" he said, \"this were an advertisement of Beefo, so nice, so  nutritious, try it in your soup, ladies like it.\"          THE TOMB OF PAN      \"Seeing,\" they said, \"that old-time Pan is dead, let us now make  a tomb for him and a monument, that the dreadful worship of long  ago may be remembered and avoided by all.\"    So said the people of the enlightened lands. And they built a  white and mighty tomb of marble. Slowly it rose under the hands  of the builders and longer every evening after sunset it gleamed with  rays of the departed sun.    And many mourned for Pan while the builders built; many reviled  him. Some called the builders to cease and to weep for Pan and  others called them to leave no memorial at all of so infamous a god.  But the builders built on steadily.    And one day all was finished, and the tomb stood there like a  steep sea-cliff. And Pan was carved thereon with humbled head  and the feet of angels pressed upon his neck. And when the tomb  was finished the sun had already set, but the afterglow was rosy on  the huge bulk of Pan.    And presently all the enlightened people came, and saw the tomb  and remembered Pan who was dead, and all deplored him and his  wicked age. But a few wept apart because of the death of Pan.    But at evening as he stole out of the forest, and slipped like a shadow  softly along the hills, Pan saw the tomb and laughed."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7847"],[0,"Jack North's Treasure Hunt; Or, Daring Adventures in South America (#9)"],[1," on his uncertain journey without  telling any one his intentions, little dreaming of the result which was to  come of his secret movement.    He believed the mysterious island was nearly north of Resaca, so he shaped  his course in that direction, keeping a sharp lookout for any enemy that  might be in his pathway.    He was in the heart of the great dry region of South America, a district  of nearly a thousand miles in length, where rain seldom if ever falls, and  the country is afforded sufficient moisture by the sea vapors condensed on  the Andes and sent down upon the plains and lowlands. The desert of  Atacama lay many miles to the south, but as he progressed he often found  sections of the country without a thing growing upon the land, though  sometimes these spots were bordered by the most abundant growth he had  ever seen, even in that realm of grand forests and magnificent flora.    Everywhere, save on these dark patches of waste land, the vegetation was  on the boldest scale imaginable, the magnitude of the trees being simply  beyond the comprehension of him who had never seen them, while some of  even the largest were adorned with beautiful flowers, making them seem  like gardens of themselves.    On account of the density of the growth, Jack often found it difficult to  advance, and many times he was obliged to make long detours in order to  reach a certain point.    Zig-zagging about, always keeping his eyes open for bush-raiders, wild  beasts, and, above all, for the strange island, he had spent four days in  the wilderness, when he felt that it was time for him to think of  returning to civilization.    He had seen no sign of the looked-for body of inland water with its  treasure island, though the increasing presence of cinchona trees told him  that he was already ascending into the region of the Peruvian Andes.    \"I am sure it is at the foot of these mountains that the strange island  exists,\" he thought, as he paused on the summit of one of the foothills of  the snow-crowned Monarch of Mountains. \"But there is no sign of water, and  how can I expect to find an island where there is no water?\"    The involuntary speech brought a smile to his lips. As he would explain  his thoughts, he said aloud:    \"Somehow I got it into my head that there was a lake in this region, and  there I was to find my treasure island. But I have been a fool to look for  either. Come, Juan,\" patting the neck of his pony, \"let us go back while  we have sense enough to do so.\"    But while he spoke he lingered around the place, as if there was some  strong fascination for him. It was a beautiful scene, made up almost  entirely of forest, but such a forest as only Peru, with its wonderful  natural wealth, can produce.    The trees were composed largely of rosewoods in all their varied beauty,  the giant quassia in all their hues and tints of foliage, with a  sprinkling of cinchona, lending a happy blending of more sober coloring,  while from the lowlands was wafted to him on the gentle breeze of that  tropical clime the perfume of the tinga.    The finger of silence lay on the lip of Nature, even the broad leaves of  the quassia rising and falling on the shifting breaths of air, without  that peculiar rustling sound generally belonging to the forest domain.    It was the most beautiful scene he had ever looked upon, and as he allowed  his gaze to slowly move around the encircling country, he found himself  looking down upon the strangest valley or mountain pocket he had ever  beheld.    The singular feature of this isolated, wood-environed retreat was its  complete absence of all kinds of growth, except for a sort of silky grass  which covered its uneven surface like a rich carpet of the deepest green  tint. Near the centre was an oval elevation of rock and earth higher by a  few feet than knobs and miniature hills which dotted it elsewhere.    It was bare of vegetation, not even the silken tasia ornamenting its  sides, though a solitary tree did rise in lonely grandeur from its utmost  crest.    Jack uttered a low exclamation as he saw that this tree was a pimento.    In a moment his mind reverted to the description given in the strange  manuscript, but a look of disappointment succeeded his eager anticipation.    \"What a fool!\" he exclaimed. \"That tree stood on an island--\"    A rustle in the undergrowth arrested his attention at that moment, and,  before he could avoid the unexpected attack, a dark lissom body shot  through the air, to alight squarely upon his pony, that, with a snort of  terror, started madly through the growth.          Chapter XI    Under the Head of a Jaguar        Jack was nearly unseated by the sudden dash of his pony, and managing to  retain his position he was in imminent danger of being swept off by the  branches of the trees.    The deep growl of the creature at his back rang in his ears, and he could  feel the poor pony quiver in every muscle, as the fearful claws of the  brute were buried deep into its flesh.    This occupied but a moment's time from the attack of the wild beast to the  end of the pony's flight, but it was such a moment as Jack never forgot.    He had seen a precipice in the pathway of the terrified animal, but not in  season to stop the maddened creature or turn it aside, though he did make  a frantic effort to do so. As if bent upon its own destruction, the pony  made a suicidal leap down the precipitous descent.    The frightened creature struck upon its feet, but immediately fell over on  its right side, carrying its rider with it and pinning him under its body.    The savage beast had not lost its hold, and as Jack lay there within its  deadly reach he saw for the first time that it was the most dreaded of the  wild beasts of South America, the jaguar.    He had barely taken a swift glance at the furious brute before a warning  growl above him broke the momentary silence and then a second form, the  mate of that beside him, plunged down from the top of the cliff, landing  beside the first, that uttered a fierce growl at the same time.    Jack's heart fairly stopped its beating, and finding himself unable to  move his right limb, he felt that it was all over with him.    The pony had apparently been killed by its fall, together with the attack  of the jaguar, as it did not move after it fell over on its side.    The ferocious beasts, with a succession of sharp growls and snarls, began  to feast upon the still warm carcass of the poor horse.    It was fortunate, and showed Jack's remarkable presence of mind as well,  that at that critical moment he remembered that old hunters had said if  one feigned death he might escape the attack of a wild beast under  ordinary circumstances, the story of Dr. Livingstone lying under the  lion's paw coming vividly into his mind. But his left leg lay on top of  the pony's body and close to where the two jaguars were exercising their  teeth and claws on the flesh.    That morning before starting from Resaca he had put on a pair of boots  with stout tops as a means of protection from the bushes and brambles he  might encounter on his long ride. But he could not hope these would  protect him long, if at all, from the attacks of the voracious brutes.    Words cannot describe his feelings as he lay there listening to the  ominous growls and crunching of the hungry animals, expecting every moment  to feel their sharp teeth in his own flesh.    Two or three times he felt one or the other of the jaguars push savagely  against his foot, which was lifted and carried forward upon the pony's  neck in their eagerness to get at the warm meat.    All of that horrible scene Jack heard and felt rather than saw, for he did  not dare to open his eyes--dare to draw a full breath.    After awhile he heard one of the pair move away a short distance, and he  could hear it licking its dripping chops after its feast.    Its mate continued its voracious attacks upon the carcass, the grinding of  its jaws and the crackling of the pony's bones making horrible sounds for  the helpless boy.    When this had continued for several minutes longer, the second jaguar  stopped eating and began to lick Jack's boots.    Nothing so far had equaled the horror of that sensation.    It seemed to Jack that he must go mad if it continued long!    After what seemed a long time to him in his intense agony, the dull,  rasping sound ceased; the jaguar had ended its licking, but, as if loath  to leave the spot, it allowed its head to fall forward on the half eaten  body, with its nostrils lying on Jack's foot. Its slow and regular  breathing finally told that it had fallen asleep after eating its dinner.    Jack a little later heard the cat-like steps of its mate leaving the  place, until the pitter-patter died away in the distance.    Then, for the first time, he dared to open his eyes, though he did not  venture to move his head or hand a particle.    He could see the sleeping jaguar's head and that was all that was in sight  of the creature, that still remained motionless but likely to start up at  his first movement.    As Jack's gaze followed his narrow orbit of vision he soon saw his  firearm, which had slipped from him in his ride over the precipice and  fallen near where he lay in that terrible situation.    He had no sooner seen the weapon than a wild desire to get possession of  it filled his mind. If he only had that in his hands he believed he could  shoot the jaguar before it could do him harm.    The longer he pondered upon this the stronger became the desire to make  the attempt. Failure could not be any worse than that awful suspense,  which in all probability must end in death.    Then, as he realized that the jaguar's mate might return at any moment, he  resolved to make the bold venture without more delay.    He was first careful to make himself sure that the brute was still asleep,  when he slowly and cautiously raised his hand enough to reach for the  carbine,"]]]
