In this way the five Buddhist commandments for the laity not to kill any  living creature, not to steal, not to commit adultery, not to lie, and  not to use intoxicating liquor are propagated and made real to the  common man. The method is quite efficient. Whole provinces have been put  into a panic by such prophecies.    _2. Effect of Ideals of Mercy and Universal Love_    The command not to kill any living being has had considerable influence  in China. There are volumes of stories telling of the punishments which  will be visited upon those who disobey and of the rewards of those who  release living animals. Every monastery has a special place for animals  thus released by pious devotees.    There is a popular story about a fishmonger of the T'ang dynasty who was  taken sick and during his illness dreamed that he was taken to  purgatory. His body was aflame with fire and pained him as though he  were being roasted. Flying fiery chariots with darting flames swept  around him and burned his body. Ten thousand fish strove with one  another to get a bite of his flesh. The ruler of the lower regions  accused him of killing many fish and hence his punishment. For a number  of days he was hanging between life and death. His relatives were urged  to perform some works of penance. They had his fishing implements  burned. With reverent hearts they made two images of Kuan Yin, presented  offerings and repented. The whole family performed abstinence, stopped  killing living things, printed and gave away over a hundred copies of  the Diamond Sutra, and ferried over a large number of souls through  purgatory. As a result of their efforts the sick man became well.    The following comment was made on the above story by a scholar. If its  premises are granted, the conclusion is inevitable:    \"If the fiery chariots are seal, why does not man see them? If they are  false, how is it that man feels the pain? But where do the fiery  chariots come from? They come from the heart and head of the one who  kills fish. The fire in the heart (heart belongs to the element fire)  causes destruction. The chariot fire also causes destruction.\"    This attitude of mercy has been extended to human beings. There are  numerous tracts against the drowning of little girls in those regions  where this custom is prevalent. One tells the following story:    In the province of Kwangtung there lived a Mrs. Chang who daily burned  incense and repeated Buddha's name. One day she and her husband died.  Much to their surprise and consternation Yama (the potentate of hell)  decided that Mr. Chang must become a pig and Mrs. Chang a dog. Mrs.  Chang accordingly went to Yama and said, \"During life we honored Buddha  and so why should we become animals after death?\" Yama said, \"What use  is it to honor Buddha? During life you drowned three girls whom I sent  into life. People with the face of a man and the heart of a beast,  should they not be punished?\" The husband accordingly took on a pig's  skin and the wife a dog's. Then by a dream they revealed to their  brother Chang number two that, although they repeated Buddha's name,  they were not permitted to be reborn as men, because they had drowned  little girls.    Perhaps the extent of this spirit, of mercy and its possibilities may be  illustrated by the reverence for the ox. While there is a great deal of  cruelty in China to animals and men, it is rarely that one sees an ox  abused. Up to the advent of the foreigner an ox was not killed for meat.  In many places in China today the slaughter of an ox would bring the  punishments of the law upon the butcher. No doubt this reverence is due  to the great Indian reverence for the cow. The law of kindness has been  extended to other animals, taking the rather spectacular form of  releasing a few decrepit animals and allowing them to spend their last  days in a monastery compound. There are many kindly things done in  China. The dead are buried, the sick are provided with medicine. Every  year numerous wadded garments are given away to poor people. Various  groups carrying on a humble ministry of helpfulness have found a real  inspiration in the ideals held before them in Buddhism, the rewards  promised and punishments threatened.    _3. Relation to Confucian Ideals_    Why have not these ideals exercised a larger influence in China? The  answer is quite simple. The activities of the monks have been  strenuously opposed by the Confucian state system. The philosopher,  Chang Nan-hsiian, a contemporary of Chu-Hsi, states concisely for us the  differences betwen Confucianism and Buddhism in his comment on a passage  in the _Book of Records._    \"Strong drink is a thing intended to be-used in offering sacrifices and  entertaining guests,--such employment of it is what Heaven has  prescribed. But men by their abuse of such drink come to lose their  virtue and destroy their persons--such employment of it is what Heaven  has annexed its terrors to. The Buddhists, hating the use of things  where Heaven sends down its terrors, put away as well the use of them  which Heaven has prescribed.    \"For instance, in the use of meats and drinks, there is such a thing as  wildly abusing and destroying the creatures of Heaven. The Buddhists,  disliking this, confine themselves to a vegetable diet, while we only  abjure wild abuse and destruction. In the use of clothes, again, there  is such a thing as wasteful extravagance. The Buddhists, disliking this,  will have no clothes but those of a dark and sad color, while we only  condemn extravagance. They, further, through dislike of criminal  connection between the sexes, would abolish the relation between husband  and wife, while we denounce only the criminal connection.    \"The Buddhists, disliking the excesses to which the evil desires of men  lead, would put away, along with them, the actions which are in  accordance with the justice of heavenly principles, while we, the  orthodox, put away the evil desires of men, whereupon what are called  heavenly principles are the more brightly seen. Suppose the case of a  stream of water. The Buddhists, through dislike of its being foul with  mud, proceed to dam it up with earth. They do not consider that when the  earth has dammed up the stream, the supply of water will be cut off. It  is not so with us, the orthodox. We seek only to cleanse away the mud  and sand, so that the pure water may be available for use. This is the  difference between the Buddhists and the Learned School.\" [Footnote:  _Shu King,_ Pt. V, Bk. X, p. 122.]    This statement reveals at once the opposition of the sect of the Learned  and the influence which Buddhism exerted upon its members.    Buddhism while enjoying occasional favor from the state was often  zealously persecuted. In 819 Han Yii issued his celebrated act of  accusation. In 845 the emperor Wu Tsung issued his decree of  secularization. At that time 4600 monasteries and 40,000 smaller  establishments were pulled down and 265,000 monks and nuns were sent  back to lay life. Their rich lands were confiscated. Under the Ming  dynasty, as well as under the Ch'ing dynasty, Buddhism enjoyed a  precarious existence. Whether Buddhism would have improved the moral  conditions of the Chinese; if it had been given a free hand, is  difficult to affirm. Still its failure is at least partly due to the  opposition of Confucian orthodoxy.    _4. The Embodiment of Buddhist Ideals in the Vegetarian sects_    The state persecutions of Buddhism forced it to leave temporarily its  institutional life and trust itself to the people. These persecutions  were usually followed by a revival of piety and religion among the  people. The Buddhist teachers gathered about themselves a large number  of lay devotees who formed societies which practice religious rites in  secret. These sects have preserved the genuine Buddhist piety, not only  in times of persecution, but at times when the Buddhist organization  under imperial favor was departing from its simplicity.    A number of these sects have continued under different names for several  centuries. For example, the Tsai Li, a society now enjoying a quiet  existence in North China, is successor to the White Lotus society. The  latter started in the fifth century. Its members sought salvation in the  Pure Land of Amitabha. In the eleventh century it enjoyed imperial  favor. During the Mongol dynasty it fought against the throne with  rebels and placed one of its leaders, Chu Yüan-chang, a monk, on the  throne, who became the founder of the Ming dynasty. The sect was soon  proscribed and its members persecuted by the government. During the  Ch'ing dynasty it took part in a rebellion and was ruthlessly  exterminated. At present it goes under the name of _Tsai Li,_ i.e.,  within the Li or principles of the three religions. It is a mediator  among the three religions.    There are thirty-one organizations of this sect in Peking and branches  throughout North China. The society forbids the use of wine and opium,  though it does not forbid the use of meat. It usually has a Buddhist  image, Kuan Yin or some other. It uses Buddhist prayers and  incantations. The outstanding doctrines held during its long history  have been the hope of salvation in the Western Heaven of Amitâbha, the  early coming of Maitrêya, the Buddhist Messiah, and the large use of  magic formulas and incantations.    Another sect which embodies Buddhist ideals is the Chin Tan, the sect of  the philosopher's stone or pill of immortality. Its founder was the  writer of the Nestorian tablet and so the sect is related to  Christianity. It exalts the teaching of universal love. This is one of  several examples of a supposed contact between Buddhism and  Christianity.

I lay in the desert beyond all cities and sounds, and above me  flowed the River of Silence through the sky; and on the desert's  edge night fought against the Sun, and suddenly conquered.    Then on the River I saw the dream-built ship of the god Yoharneth-Lahai,  whose great prow lifted grey into the air above the River of Silence.    Her timbers were olden dreams dreamed long ago, and poets' fancies  made her tall, straight masts, and her rigging was wrought out of  the people's hopes.    Upon her deck were rowers with dream-made oars, and the rowers  were the people of men's fancies, and princes of old story and  people who had died, and people who had never been.    These swung forward and swung back to row Yoharneth-Lahai through  the Worlds with never a sound of rowing. For ever on every wind  float up to Pegana the hopes and the fancies of the people which  have no home in the Worlds, and there Yoharneth-Lahai weaves them  into dreams, to take them to the people again.    And every night in his dream-built ship Yoharneth-Lahai setteth  forth, with all his dreams on board, to take again their old hopes  back to the people and all forgotten fancies.    But ere the day comes back to her own again, and all the  conquering armies of the dawn hurl their red lances in the face of  the night, Yoharneth-Lahai leaves the sleeping Worlds, and rows  back up the River of Silence, that flows from Pegana into the Sea  of Silence that lies beyond the Worlds.    And the name of the River is Imrana the River of Silence. All they  that be weary of the sound of cities and very tired of clamour  creep down in the night-time to Yoharneth-Lahai's ship, and going  aboard it, among the dreams and the fancies of old times, lie down  upon the deck, and pass from sleeping to the River, while Mung,  behind them, makes the sign of Mung because they would have it so.  And, lying there upon the deck among their own remembered fancies,  and songs that were never sung, and they drift up Imrana ere the  dawn, where the sound of the cities comes not, nor the voice of  the thunder is heard, nor the midnight howl of Pain as he gnaws  at the bodies of men, and far away and forgotten bleat the small  sorrows that trouble all the Worlds.    But where the River flows through Pegana's gates, between the  great twin constellations Yum and Gothum, where Yum stands  sentinel upon the left and Gothum upon the right, there sits  Sirami, the lord of All Forgetting. And, when the ship draws near,  Sirami looketh with his sapphire eyes into the faces and beyond  them of those that were weary of cities, and as he gazes, as one  that looketh before him remembering naught, he gently waves his  hands. And amid the waving of Sirami's hands there fall from all  that behold him all their memories, save certain things that may  not be forgotten even beyond the Worlds.    It hath been said that when Skarl ceases to drum, and MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI  awakes, and the gods of Pegana know that it is THE END, that then the  gods will enter galleons of gold, and with dream-born rowers glide down  Imrana (who knows whither or why?) till they come where the River enters  the Silent Sea, and shall there be gods of nothing, where nothing is,  and never a sound shall come. And far away upon the River's banks shall  bay their old hound Time, that shall seek to rend his masters; while  MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI shall think some other plan concerning gods and worlds.        THE BIRD OF DOOM AND THE END      For at the last shall the thunder, fleeing to escape from the doom  of the gods, roar horribly among the Worlds; and Time, the hound  of the gods, shall bay hungrily at his masters because he is lean  with age.    And from the innermost of Pegana's vales shall the bird of doom,  Mosahn, whose voice is like the trumpet, soar upward with  boisterous beatings of his wings above Pegana's mountains and the  gods, and there with his trumpet voice acclaim THE END.    Then in the tumult and amid the fury of their hound the gods shall  make for the last time in Pegana the sign of all the gods, and go  with dignity and quiet down to Their galleons of gold, and sail  away down the River of Silence, not ever to return.    Then shall the River overflow its banks, and a tide come setting  in from the Silent Sea, till all the Worlds and the Skies are  drowned in silence; while MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI in the Middle of All  sits deep in thought. And the hound Time, when all the Worlds and  cities are swept away whereon he used to raven, having no more to  devour, shall suddenly die.    But there are some that hold--and this is the heresy of the  Saigoths--that when the gods go down at the last into their  galleons of gold Mung shall turn alone, and, setting his back  against Trehagobol and wielding the Sword of Severing which is  called Death, shall fight out his last fight with the hound Time,  his empty scabbard Sleep clattering loose beside him.    There under Trehagobol they shall fight alone when all the gods  are gone.    And the Saigoths say that for two days and nights the hound shall  leer and snarl before the face of Mung-days and nights that shall  be lit by neither sun nor moons, for these shall go dipping down  the sky with all the Worlds as the galleons glide away, because  the gods that made them are gods no more.    And then shall the hound, springing, tear out the throat of Mung,  who, making for the last time the sign of Mung, shall bring down  Death crashing through the shoulders of the hound, and in the  blood of Time that Sword shall rust away.    Then shall MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI be all alone, with neither Death nor  Time, and never the hours singing in his ears, nor the swish of  the passing lives.    But far away from Pegana shall go the galleons of gold that bear  the gods away, upon whose faces shall be utter calm, because They  are the gods knowing that it is THE END."]]]
