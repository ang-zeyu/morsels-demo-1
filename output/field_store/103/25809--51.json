I'll take him for my slave,\" said  a counselor.    \"I'll take Tiktok, the machine man,\" said another.    \"Give me the Tin Woodman,\" said a third.    They went on for some time, dividing up the people and the treasure of  Oz in advance of the conquest.  For they had no doubt at all that they  would be able to destroy Ozma's domain.  Were they not the strongest  people in all the world?    \"The deadly desert has kept us out of Oz before,\" remarked the Grand  Gallipoot, \"but now that the Nome King is building a tunnel we shall  get into the Emerald City very easily.  So let us send the little fat  General back to his King with our promise to assist him.  We will not  say that we intend to conquer the Nomes after we have conquered Oz, but  we will do so, just the same.\"    This plan being agreed upon, they all went home to dinner, leaving  General Guph still in prison.  The Nome had no idea that he had  succeeded in his mission, for finding himself in prison he feared the  Growleywogs intended to put him to death.    By this time the jailer had tired of sticking pins in the General, and  was amusing himself by carefully pulling the Nome's whiskers out by the  roots, one at a time.  This enjoyment was interrupted by the Grand  Gallipoot sending for the prisoner.    \"Wait a few hours,\" begged the jailer.  \"I haven't pulled out a quarter  of his whiskers yet.\"    \"If you keep the Grand Gallipoot waiting, he'll break your back,\"  declared the messenger.    \"Perhaps you're right,\" sighed the jailer.  \"Take the prisoner away, if  you will, but I advise you to kick him at every step he takes.  It will  be good fun, for he is as soft as a ripe peach.\"    So Guph was led away to the royal castle, where the Grand Gallipoot  told him that the Growleywogs had decided to assist the Nomes in  conquering the Land of Oz.    \"Whenever you are ready,\" he added, \"send me word and I will march with  eighteen thousand of my most powerful warriors to your aid.\"    Guph was so delighted that he forgot all the smarting caused by the  pins and the pulling of whiskers.  He did not even complain of the  treatment he had received, but thanked the Grand Gallipoot and hurried  away upon his journey.    He had now secured the assistance of the Whimsies and the Growleywogs;  but his success made him long for still more allies.  His own life  depended upon his conquering Oz, and he said to himself:    \"I'll take no chances.  I'll be certain of success.  Then, when Oz is  destroyed, perhaps I shall be a greater man than old Roquat, and I can  throw him away and be King of the Nomes myself.  Why not?  The Whimsies  are stronger than the Nomes, and they also are my friends.  There are  some people still stronger than the Growleywogs, and if I can but  induce them to aid me I shall have nothing more to fear.\"        9.  How the Wogglebug Taught Athletics    It did not take Dorothy long to establish herself in her new home, for  she knew the people and the manners and customs of the Emerald City  just as well as she knew the old Kansas farm.    But Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had some trouble in getting used to the  finery and pomp and ceremony of Ozma's palace, and felt uneasy because  they were obliged to be \"dressed up\" all the time.  Yet every one was  very courteous and kind to them and endeavored to make them happy.  Ozma, especially, made much of Dorothy's relatives, for her little  friend's sake, and she well knew that the awkwardness and strangeness  of their new mode of life would all wear off in time.    The old people were chiefly troubled by the fact that there was no work  for them to do.    \"Ev'ry day is like Sunday, now,\" declared Aunt Em, solemnly, \"and I  can't say I like it.  If they'd only let me do up the dishes after  meals, or even sweep an' dust my own rooms, I'd be a deal happier.  Henry don't know what to do with himself either, and once when he stole  out an' fed the chickens Billina scolded him for letting 'em eat  between meals.  I never knew before what a hardship it is to be rich  and have everything you want.\"    These complaints began to worry Dorothy; so she had a long talk with  Ozma upon the subject.    \"I see I must find them something to do,\" said the girlish Ruler of Oz,  seriously.  \"I have been watching your uncle and aunt, and I believe  they will be more contented if occupied with some light tasks.  While I  am considering this matter, Dorothy, you might make a trip with them  through the Land of Oz, visiting some of the odd corners and  introducing your relatives to some of our curious people.\"    \"Oh, that would be fine!\" exclaimed Dorothy, eagerly.    \"I will give you an escort befitting your rank as a Princess,\"  continued Ozma; \"and you may go to some of the places you have not yet  visited yourself, as well as some others that you know.  I will mark  out a plan of the trip for you and have everything in readiness for you  to start to-morrow morning.  Take your time, dear, and be gone as long  as you wish.  By the time you return I shall have found some occupation  for Uncle Henry and Aunt Em that will keep them from being restless and  dissatisfied.\"    Dorothy thanked her good friend and kissed the lovely Ruler gratefully.  Then she ran to tell the joyful news to her uncle and aunt.    Next morning, after breakfast, everything was found ready for their  departure.    The escort included Omby Amby, the Captain General of Ozma's army,  which consisted merely of twenty-seven officers besides the Captain  General.  Once Omby Amby had been a private soldier--the only private  in the army--but as there was never any fighting to do Ozma saw no need  of a private, so she made Omby Amby the highest officer of them all.  He was very tall and slim and wore a gay uniform and a fierce mustache.  Yet the mustache was the only fierce thing about Omby Amby, whose  nature was as gentle as that of a child.    The wonderful Wizard had asked to join the party, and with him came his  friend the Shaggy Man, who was shaggy but not ragged, being dressed in  fine silks with satin shags and bobtails.  The Shaggy Man had shaggy  whiskers and hair, but a sweet disposition and a soft, pleasant voice.    There was an open wagon, with three seats for the passengers, and the  wagon was drawn by the famous wooden Sawhorse which had once been  brought to life by Ozma by means of a magic powder.  The Sawhorse wore  wooden shoes to keep his wooden legs from wearing away, and he was  strong and swift.  As this curious creature was Ozma's own favorite  steed, and very popular with all the people of the Emerald City,  Dorothy knew that she had been highly favored by being permitted to use  the Sawhorse on her journey.    In the front seat of the wagon sat Dorothy and the Wizard.  Uncle Henry  and Aunt Em sat in the next seat and the Shaggy Man and Omby Amby in  the third seat.  Of course Toto was with the party, curled up at  Dorothy's feet, and just as they were about to start, Billina came  fluttering along the path and begged to be taken with them.  Dorothy  readily agreed, so the Yellow Hen flew up and perched herself upon the  dashboard.  She wore her pearl necklace and three bracelets upon each  leg, in honor of the occasion.    Dorothy kissed Ozma good-bye, and all the people standing around waved  their handkerchiefs, and the band in an upper balcony struck up a  military march.  Then the Wizard clucked to the Sawhorse and said:  \"Gid-dap!\" and the wooden animal pranced away and drew behind him the  big red wagon and all the passengers, without any effort at all.  A  servant threw open a gate of the palace enclosure, that they might pass  out; and so, with music and shouts following them, the journey was  begun.    \"It's almost like a circus,\" said Aunt Em, proudly.  \"I can't help  feelin' high an' mighty in this kind of a turn-out.\"    Indeed, as they passed down the street, all the people cheered them  lustily, and the Shaggy Man and the Wizard and the Captain General all  took off their hats and bowed politely in acknowledgment.    When they came to the great wall of the Emerald City, the gates were  opened by the Guardian who always tended them.  Over the gateway hung a  dull-colored metal magnet shaped like a horse-shoe, placed against a  shield of polished gold.    \"That,\" said the Shaggy Man, impressively, \"is the wonderful Love  Magnet.  I brought it to the Emerald City myself, and all who pass  beneath this gateway are both loving and beloved.\"    \"It's a fine thing,\" declared Aunt Em, admiringly.  \"If we'd had it in  Kansas I guess the man who held a mortgage on the farm wouldn't have  turned us out.\"    \"Then I'm glad we didn't have it,\" returned Uncle Henry.  \"I like Oz  better than Kansas, even; an' this little wood Sawhorse beats all the  critters I ever saw.  He don't have to be curried, or fed, or watered,  an' he's strong as an ox.  Can he talk, Dorothy?\"    \"Yes, Uncle,\" replied the child.  \"But the Sawhorse never says much.  He told me once that he can't talk and think at the same time, so he  prefers to think.\"    \"Which is very sensible,\" declared the Wizard, nodding approvingly.  \"Which way do we go, Dorothy?\"    \"Straight ahead into the Quadling Country,\" she answered.  \"I've got a  letter of interduction to Miss Cuttenclip.\"    \"Oh!\" exclaimed the Wizard, much interested.  \"Are we going there?  Then I'm glad I came, for I've always wanted to meet the Cuttenclips.\"    \"Who are they?\" inquired Aunt Em.    \"Wait till we get there,\" replied Dorothy, with a laugh; \"then you'll  see for yourself.  I've never seen the Cuttenclips, you know, so I  can't 'zactly 'splain 'em to you.\"    Once free of the Emerald City the Sawhorse dashed away at tremendous  speed.  Indeed, he went so fast that Aunt Em had hard work to catch her  breath, and Uncle Henry held fast to the seat of the red wagon.    \"Gently--gently, my boy!\" called the Wizard, and at this the Sawhorse  slackened his speed.    \"What"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5173"],[0,"The Religion of the Samurai (#9)"],[1," him the  doctrine of the Dharma-laksana.  It was Huen Tsang who advised Do-sho  to study Zen under Hwui Man (E-man).  After returning home, he built  a Meditation Hall for the purpose of practising Zen in the Gan-go  monastery, Nara.  Thus Zen was first transplanted into Japan by  Do-sho, but it took no root in the soil at that time.    Next a Chinese Zen teacher, I Kung (Gi-ku), came over to Japan in  about 810, and under his instruction the Empress Danrin, a most  enthusiastic Buddhist, was enlightened.  She erected a monastery  named Dan-rin-ji, and appointed I Kung the abbot of it for the sake  of propagating the faith.  It being of no purpose, however, I Kung  went back to China after some years.    Thirdly, Kaku-a in 1171 went over to China, where he studied Zen  under Fuh Hai (Buk-kai), who belonged to the Yang Ki (Yo-gi) school,  and came home after three years.  Being questioned by the Emperor  Taka-kura (1169-1180) about the doctrine of Zen, he uttered no word,  but took up a flute and played on it.  But his first note was too  high to be caught by the ordinary ear, and was gone without producing  any echo in the court nor in society at large.    [FN#69]  The three divisions of the Buddhist canon, viz.:    (1) Sutra-pitaka, or a collection of doctrinal books.  (2) Vinaya-pitaka, or a collection of works on discipline.  (3) Abhidharma-pitaka, or a collection of philosophical and  expository works.    [FN#70]  The great monastery erected in 788 by Sai-cho (767-822), the  founder of the Japanese Ten Dai Sect, known as Den Gyo Dai Shi.      After visiting holy places and great monasteries, he came home,  bringing with him over thirty different books on the doctrine of the  Ten-Dai Sect.[FN#71]  This, instead of quenching, added fuel to his  burning desire for adventurous travel abroad.  So he crossed the sea  over again in 1187, this time intending to make pilgrimage to India;  and no one can tell what might have been the result if the Chinese  authorities did not forbid him to cross the border.  Thereon he  turned his attention to the study of Zen, and after five years'  discipline succeeded in getting sanction for his spiritual attainment  by the Hu Ngan (Kio-an), a noted master of the Rin Zai school, the  then abbot of the monastery of Tien Tung Shan (Ten-do-san).  His  active propaganda of Zen was commenced soon after his return in 1191  with splendid success at a newly built temple[FN#72] in the province  of Chiku-zen.  In 1202 Yori-iye, the Shogun, or the real governor of  the State at that time, erected the monastery of Ken-nin-ji in the  city of Kyo-to, and invited him to proceed to the metropolis.  Accordingly he settled himself down in that temple, and taught Zen  with his characteristic activity.      [FN#71]  The sect was named after its founder in China, Chi I  (538-597), who lived in the monastery of Tien Tai Shan (Ten-dai-san),  and was called the Great Teacher of Tien Tai.  In 804 Den-gyo went  over to China by the Imperial order, and received the transmission of  the doctrine from Tao Sui (Do-sui), a patriarch of the sect.  After  his return he erected a monastery on Mount Hi-yei, which became the  centre of Buddhistic learning.    [FN#72]  He erected the monastery of Sho-fuku-ji in 1195, which is  still prospering.      This provoked the envy and wrath of the Ten Dai and the Shin  Gon[FN#73] teachers, who presented memorials to the Imperial court to  protest against his propagandism of the new faith.  Taking advantage  of the protests, Ei-sai wrote a book entitled Ko-zen-go-koku-ron  ('The Protection of the State by the Propagation of Zen'), and not  only explained his own position, but exposed the ignorance[FN#74] of  the protestants.  Thus at last his merit was appreciated by the  Emperor Tsuchi-mikado (1199-1210), and he was promoted to So Jo, the  highest rank in the Buddhist priesthood, together with the gift of a  purple robe in 1206.  Some time after this he went to the city of  Kama-kura, the political centre, being invited by Sane-tomo, the  Shogun, and laid the foundation of the so-called Kama-kura Zen, still  prospering at the present moment.      [FN#73]  The Shin Gon or Mantra Sect is based on  Mahavairocanabhi-sambodhi-sutra, Vajracekhara-sutra, and other  Mantra-sutras.  It was established in China by Vajrabodhi and his  disciple Amoahavajra, who came from India in 720.  Ku kai (774-835),  well known as Ko Bo Dai Shi, went to China in 804, and received the  transmission of the doctrine from Hwui Kwo (Kei-ka), a, disciple of  Amoghavajra.  In 806 he came back and propagated the faith almost all  over the country.  For the detail see 'A Short History of the Twelve  Japanese Buddhist Sects' (chap. viii.), by Dr. Nanjo.    [FN#74]  Sai-cho, the founder of the Japanese Ten Dai Sect, first  learned the doctrine of the Northern School of Zen under Gyo-hyo  (died in 797), and afterwards he pursued the study of the same faith  under Siao Jan in China.  Therefore to oppose the propagation of Zen  is, for Ten Dai priests, as much as to oppose the founder of their  own sect.        2. The Introduction of the So-To School[FN#75] of Zen.      [FN#75]  This school was started by Tsing-Yuen (Sei-gen), an eminent  disciple of the Sixth Patriarch, and completed by Tsing Shan (To-zan).      Although the Rin Zai school was, as mentioned above, established by  Ei-sai, yet he himself was not a pure Zen teacher, being a Ten Dai  scholar as well as an experienced practiser of Mantra.  The first  establishment of Zen in its purest form was done by Do-gen, now known  as Jo Yo Dai Shi.  Like Ei-sai, he was admitted into the Hi-yei  Monastery at an early age, and devoted himself to the study of the  Canon.  As his scriptural knowledge increased, he was troubled by  inexpressible doubts and fears, as is usual with great religious  teachers.  Consequently, one day he consulted his uncle, Ko-in, a  distinguished Ten Dai scholar, about his troubles.  The latter, being  unable to satisfy him, recommended him Ei-sai, the founder of the new  faith.  But as Ei-sai died soon afterwards, he felt that he had no  competent teacher left, and crossed the sea for China, at the age of  twenty-four, in 1223.  There he was admitted into the monastery of  Tien Tung Shan (Ten-do-san), and assigned the lowest seat in the  hall, simply because be was a foreigner.  Against this affront he  strongly protested.  In the Buddhist community, he said, all were  brothers, and there was no difference of nationality.  The only way  to rank the brethren was by seniority, and he therefore claimed to  occupy his proper rank.  Nobody, however, lent an ear to the poor  new-comer's protest, so he appealed twice to the Chinese Emperor Ning  Tsung (1195-1224), and by the Imperial order he gained his object.    After four years' study and discipline, he was Enlightened and  acknowledged as the successor by his master Ju Tsing (Nyo-jo died in  1228), who belonged to the Tsao Tung (So To) school.  He came home in  1227, bringing with him three important Zen books.[FN#76]  Some three  years he did what Bodhidharma, the Wall-gazing Brahmin, had done  seven hundred years before him, retiring to a hermitage at Fuka-kusa,  not very far from Kyo-to.  Just like Bodhidharma, denouncing all  worldly fame and gain, his attitude toward the world was  diametrically opposed to that of Ei-sai.  As we have seen above,  Ei-sai never shunned, but rather sought the society of the powerful  and the rich, and made for his goal by every means.  But to the Sage  of Fuka-kusa, as Do-gen was called at that time, pomp and power was  the most disgusting thing in the world.  Judging from his poems, be  seems to have spent these years chiefly in meditation; dwelling now  on the transitoriness of life, now on the eternal peace of Nirvana;  now on the vanities and miseries of the world; now listening to the  voices of Nature amongst the hills; now gazing into the brooklet that  was, as he thought, carrying away his image reflected on it into the  world.

The Characteristics of Do-gen, the Founder of the Japanese So To  Sect.    In the meantime seekers after a new truth gradually began to knock at  his door, and his hermitage was turned into a monastery, now known as  the Temple of Ko-sho-ji.[FN#77]  It was at this time that many  Buddhist scholars and men of quality gathered about him but the more  popular he became the more disgusting the place became to him.  His  hearty desire was to live in a solitude among mountains, far distant  from human abodes, where none but falling waters and singing birds  could disturb his delightful meditation.  Therefore he gladly  accepted the invitation of a feudal lord, and went to the province of  Echi-zen, where his ideal monastery was built, now known as  Ei-hei-ji.[FN#78]      [FN#77]  It was in this monastery (built in 1236) that Zen was first  taught as an independent sect, and that the Meditation Hall was first  opened in Japan.  Do-gen lived in the monastery for eleven years, and  wrote some of the important books.  Za-zen-gi ('The Method of  Practising the Cross-legged Meditation') was written soon after his  return from China, and Ben-do-wa and other essays followed, which are  included in his great work, entitled Sho-bo-gen-zo) ('The Eye and  Treasury of the Right Law').    [FN#78]  The monastery was built in 1244 by Yoshi-shige (Hatano), the  feudal lord who invited Do-gen.  He lived in Ei-hei-ji until his  death, which took place in"]]]
