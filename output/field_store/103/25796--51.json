Pheasant?\" \"Hum!  what about a little er--MINCED MUTTON--we've not had any for some time,  I think.\" In this way we added relish to our meal.    Amongst the hills we saw numerous kangaroos, but could never get a shot.  This must be a fine camp for natives. Near the soak was a camp of quite a  dozen blacks, but recently deserted. In fact we must have scared them  away, for their fires were still smouldering. We spent three days in  exploring the hills, but failed to see any auriferous indications,  excepting in the immediate neighbourhood of Mount Shenton. We had  therefore had our long tramp for nothing, and had to be content with  knowing that we had tried our best and had at least proved the useless  character of a large stretch of country. For this, however, one gets no  thanks.    On the 6th we moved to a rock-hole near Mount Grant, in the same range as  Mount Shenton, and spent another day tramping the hills with no result.  Here again we were in luck, for a mob of thirteen emus came to drink  whilst I was in the rock-hole. Having seen them early that morning and  knowing that they had had no drink, I felt sure they would return, and so  had patiently waited, crouched in the rock hole, waist deep in water.  This, perhaps, did not improve its flavour, but emu meat was worth  procuring at the small cost of tainting the water with the taste of  clothes. Presently I heard the drumming of the approaching birds, and,  cautiously looking up, found them attentively examining the bucket and  pannikin, I had left on the rock. They made such a quaint, pretty picture  that unless we had really wanted meat, I should not have disturbed them.  Had I been so inclined I could have shot several as they were bunched  together within a few feet of me; one, however, was sufficient, and as he  fell the rest streamed away up the slope with tremendous speed. This bird  we cut into strips of meat which we dried in the sun.    To celebrate this addition to our larder, we held a concert that night,  and took it in turns to be the audience. Luck had rather a good voice,  and treated me to French songs; his favourite started, \"J'ai souvent  parcouru le monde, les forets et les grandes savannes----\" This was always  loudly applauded. My songs were not a great success--in fact an audience  of one is all I can manage, that is if I am stronger, or fleeter of foot  than he is. Luck was polite enough to say he enjoyed my rendering of  \"The Scottish Cavalier.\" Then we used to read aloud to each other by the  light of the camp-fire. I did most of the reading, for my mate's English  was not as clear as it might have been.    Athletic sports, too, we used to indulge in, feats of strength, and so  forth, in most of which Luck was too good for me, but I always beat him at  cock-fighting, which was rather a sore point. In fact, considering that we  were alone and had been so for many weeks, and were a long way into the  interior, \"outside the tracks\" by a good many score of miles, we managed  to be fairly cheerful on the whole. I do not like writing about my  companion's crotchets, because it seems unfair, since one's own  shortcomings never find the light unless the other man writes a book too.  By freely conceding that sometimes I must have been a horrible nuisance  to him, I feel absolved in this matter. When Luck used to get sulky fits,  he really was most trying; for two or three days he wouldn't speak, and  for want of company I used to talk to the camels; at the end of that time,  when I saw signs of recovery, I used to address him thus, \"Well, Bismarck,  what's it all about?\" Then he would tell me how I had agreed to bake a  damper, and had gone off and done something else, leaving him to do it, or  some such trivial complaint. After telling me about it, he would regain  his usual cheerfulness. \"Bismarck\" was a sure draw, and made him so angry  that he had to laugh as the only way out of it without fighting someone.  Luck, you see, was from Alsace, and did not care about the Germans.          CHAPTER III        FROM MOUNT SHENTON TO MOUNT MARGARET      But to continue our journey. We left Mount Grant on May 8th, travelling  South-West, and once away from the hills came again into sand and  spinifex. From absence of feed we tied the camels down two nights running.  The second night we had a visit from a native gentleman, and by his tracks  in the morning we saw that he had been quite close to our heads at one  time.    On the 10th a great change occurred in the country, and on passing through  a thicket, we found a great wall of rock (decomposed granite) barring  further progress. Following along the wall we came upon a gap, and,  entering, reached a nice little plain of saltbush, surrounded by rocks and  cliffs. This remarkable gap in the apparently extensive wall of rock we  christened the \"Desert's Gate,\" for we hourly expected to see better  country. The next day we cut some recent horse tracks, the first signs of  prospectors we had seen since April 15th, and following them back, hoping  for water, came to an empty rock-hole amongst some rough hills of black  slate, and in places, blows of quartz. No colours of gold could be found,  nor signs of water, to induce us to stay longer prospecting. On the 12th  we crossed a narrow salt lake and bade adieu to the sand and spinifex. To  commemorate this longed-for day, we afterwards composed numerous poems(?)  illustrating our daily life in the desert. The one considered by us the  best, I beg to submit to the indulgent reader.       SPINIFEX AND SAND.       I will sing you a lay of W.A.   Of a wanderer, travelled and tanned   By the sun's fierce ray, through the livelong day   In the Spinifex and Sand.     At the day's first dawn, in earliest morn,   As a soldier obeys a command,   From his blanket he's torn, still weary and worn,   By the Spinifex and Sand.     Unrested still, he must put on the billy,   And eat of the meat that is canned,   He must take his full fill, he must face willy-nilly   The Spinifex and the Sand.     Then he gets on the tracks and sights the arched backs   Of his camels of true South Aus. brand,   And with saddle and sack he must hasten to pack   For the Spinifex and Sand.     From the start until night, till he's sick of the sight,   There seem to dance hand in hand   A lady so bright, and a green-armoured knight,   The Spinifex and the Sand.     He turns to his mate with \"It gets a bit late,\"   His mate, he just answers offhand--   \"It's the same soon or late, we'll camp 't any rate   In the Spinifex and Sand.\"     As the night drags along, a weird-looking throng   Fills his dreams of a far-off land,   And a voice loud and strong chants the same ceaseless song,   Of the SPINIFEX AND THE SAND.      Since this is one of the few attempts at rhyming that I have been guilty  of, I hope I may be excused for wishing to see it in print, for at the  time I was exceedingly proud of the composition. Ah! well, it served to  pass the time and afforded some amusement. Soon we had other matters to  think about, for on the 12th we found ourselves on the outskirts of  auriferous country and were lucky in reaching plenty of water. Being  lightly loaded we had made good marches, covering 103 miles from the last  water on May 8th, an average of twenty and a half miles per day.    From the 13th to the 21st we camped surrounded by hills, any one of which  might contain gold if only we could find it. Unremitting labours resulted  in nothing but a few colours here and there. We were now thirty miles to  the North-West of Mount Margaret (discovered and named by Forrest in 1869,  who on that journey reached a point some sixty miles further East than  that hill), and though we were the first, so far as I know, to prospect  this particular part of the district, it was reserved for subsequent  fossickers to find anything worth having.    Wandering about, pick in hand, one day I put up several turkeys from the  grass surrounding some granite rocks, and shortly after found their  watering-place, a nice little pool. The next day whilst Luck prospected I  returned to the pool with a gun, and, building a hide of bushes, waited  all day. Towards evening two fine emus came stalking along, and I shot  one. By the time I had him skinned and the legs cut off it was dark. A  most deceptive bird is an emu, for in reality he has but little meat on  his body. The legs, that is the thighs, are the only parts worth taking,  so shouldering these I started for camp a couple of miles off. It was  pretty late when I got back, and found Luck ringing a camel-bell violently  and frequently. He had been a bit anxious at my long absence, and had  taken a bell off one of the camels to guide me in case I was \"bushed.\"  A party of two is too small for a journey that takes them far from  settlements for if anything happens to one, the other has little chance by  himself. The man left in camp does not know what to do--if he goes far  from home, there is the danger of the camp being robbed by natives,  therefore he hesitates to go in search of his mate, who possibly is in  sore need of help from an accident, or bushed, or speared--so many things  might happen. If one broke a limb, as he easily might, what could his mate  do? Nothing. If in waterless country he would have to leave him, or kill  him, or die with him.    Though Luck and I were spared any catastrophes, we often thought of such  things, and therefore felt anxious when either was away for long.    On the 22nd we were surprised at cutting a freshly made dray-track, along  which it was clear that many had passed--and the next day arrived at the  Red Flag, an alluvial rush that had \"set in\" during our sojourn in the  sand. This came as a great surprise, as we had no idea that gold had been  found so far afield. This camp, some twelve miles North-East of Mount  Margaret, consisted then of only"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4985"],[0,"Ruth Fielding of the Red Mill; Or, Jasper Parloe's Secret (#9)"],[1," half way across the bridge;  he could barely have raised the other gate had he set about it  instantly. So they went through that, too, leaving him bawling and  shrieking after them, but soon to learn by looking up the river what  Tom meant by his excited words as the motor car swept by.    Helen slowed down at the smithy. There were several men there and a  number of wagons. The trio in the car screamed at them: \"The dam has  burst! The flood is coming!\" and then started up again and swept  through the little village, looking back to see the group at the  smithy running in all directions to give the alarm.    Now the road, clear to the Red Mill and beyond, ran within sight of  the river. The mill was all of ten miles away. The valley was low here  and as far as they could see ahead it broadened considerably on this  side of the Lumano. But the hills arose abruptly on the farther bank  and all the force and mass of the flood must sweep across these  meadows.    As the car moved on, Helen tooted the horn constantly. Its blasts  alone should have warned people of what threatened, without Tom's  frantic shouts and gesticulations. They were obliged, however, to slow  down before several houses to make the occupants understand their  danger.    They were not half way to the Red Mill when the roar of the advancing  tidal wave was apparent even above the noise of the auto. Then they  saw the crest of the flood appear around the bend and the already  heavily burdened waters dashed themselves upon the toll-bridge. It  crumpled up and disappeared like a spider-web bridge, and the flood  rolled on, the wave widening and overflowing the lowlands behind the  automobile.    Ahead of them now upon the road there was a single foot-passenger--a  man carrying a heavy basket. He seemed so far from the higher ground,  and so determined to keep to the road, that Ruth cried out and laid  her hand upon Helen's arm. The latter nodded and shut off the engine  so that the automobile ran down and almost stopped by this pedestrian.    \"Here, you!\" shouted Tom, from the tonneau. \"Get in here quick!  There's no time to lose!\"    Much of what he said was lost in the roaring of the waters; but the  fellow understood him well enough, and scrambled into the car with his  basket. It was Jasper Parloe, and the old man was shaking as with  palsy.    \"My goodness gracious!\" he croaked, falling back in the seat as the  car darted away again. \"Ain't this awful? Ain't this jest awful?\"    He was too scared, one would have supposed, to think of much else than  the peril of the flood sweeping the valley behind them; yet he stared  up at Tom Cameron again and again as the auto hurried them on toward  the safety of the higher ground about the Red Mill, and there was  something very sly in his look.    \"Ye warn't hurt so bad then, arter all, was ye, Master Cameron?\" he  croaked.    \"I reckon I shall live to get over it,\" returned the boy, shortly.    \"But no thanks to Jabe Potter--heh? Ha! I know, I know!\"    Tom stared in return angrily, but the old man kept shaking his head  and smiling up at him slily and in such a significant way that, had  the boy not been so disturbed by what was going on behind them, he  certainly would have demanded to know what the old fellow meant.    But the car was getting close to the long hill that mounted to the  crest on which the Red Mill stood. How much better would it have been  for Jabez Potter and all concerned had he taken Doctor Davison's  advice and let out the water behind his dam! But now he was not even  at home to do anything before the thousands upon thousands of tons of  water from the Minturn reservoir swept through the Red Mill dam.    They saw the foaming, yellow water spread over the country behind  them; but within half a mile of the mill it gathered into narrower  compass again because of the nature of the land, and the wave grew  higher as it rushed down upon Potter's dam. The motor car puffed up  the hill and halted before the mill door.    \"Will we be safe here, Tom?\" cried Helen, as pale as a ghost now, but  too brave to give way. \"Are we safe?\"    \"We're all right, I believe,\" said Tom.    Jasper Parloe was already out of the car and ran into the mill. Only  the hired man was there, and he came to the door with a face whiter  than it was naturally made by the flour dust.    \"Come in, quick!\" he cried to the young people. \"This mill can't go--  it's too solid.\"    Beyond the Red Mill the ground was low again; had the Camerons tried  to keep on the road for home the flood would have overtaken the car.  And to take the road that branched off for Cheslow would have  endangered the car, too. In a few seconds the knoll on which the mill  stood was an island!    The girls and Tom ran indoors. They could hardly hear each other shout  during the next few minutes. The waters rose and poured over the dam,  and part of it was swept out. Great waves beat upon the river-wall of  the mill. And then, with a tearing crash of rent timbers and masonry,  the front of the little office and the storeroom, built out over the  river, was torn away.    From that quarter Jasper Parloe ran, yelling wildly. Ruth saw him dart  out of the far door of the mill, stooping low and with his coat over  his head as though he expected the whole structure to fall about his  ears.    But only that wall and the loading platform for the boats were sliced  off by the flood. Then the bulk of the angry waters swept past,  carrying all sorts of debris before it, and no farther harm was done  to the mill, or to Mr. Potter's other buildings.      CHAPTER XI     UNCLE JABEZ IS EXCITED    So rapidly had all this taken place that the girls had remained in the  mill. But now Ruth, crying: \"Aunt Alvirah will be frightened to death,  Helen!\" led the way down the long passage and through the shed into  the kitchen porch. The water on this side of the building had swept up  the road and actually into the yard; but the automobile stood in a  puddle only and was not injured.    Aunt Alviry was sitting in her rocker by the window. The old woman was  very pale and wan. She had her Bible open on her knees and her lips  trembled in a smile of welcome when the girls burst into the room.    \"Oh, my dears! my dears!\" she cried. \"I am so thankful to see you both  safe!\" She started to rise, and the old phrase came to her lips: \"Oh,  my back and oh, my bones!\"    Then she rose and hobbled across the room. Her bright little, birdlike  eyes, that had never yet known spectacles, had seen something up the  Cheslow road.    \"Who's this a-coming? For the land's sake, what recklessness! Is that  Jabez and his mules, Ruthie? Bless us and save us! what's he going to  try and do?\"    The two girls ran to the door. Down the hill thundered a farm wagon  drawn by a pair of mules, said mules being on the dead run while their  driver stood in the wagon and snapped his long, blacksnake whip over  their ears. Such a descent of the hill was reckless enough in any  case; but now, at the foot, rolled the deep water. It had washed away  a little bridge that spanned what was usually a rill, but the banks of  this stream being overflowed for yards on either side, the channel was  at least ten feet deep.    It was Jabez Potter driving so recklessly down the hill from Cheslow.    \"Oh, oh!\" screamed the old lady. \"Jabez will be killed! Oh, my back  and oh, my bones! Oh, deary, deary me!\"    She had crossed the porch and was hobbling down the steps. Her  rheumatic twinges evidently caused her excruciating pain, but the fear  she felt for the miller's safety spurred her to get as far as the  fence. And there Ruth and Helen kept her from splashing into the muddy  water that covered the road.    \"You can do no good, Aunt Alvirah!\" cried Ruth.    \"The mules are not running away with him, Mrs. Boggs,\" urged Helen.    \"They'll kill him! He's crazy! It's his money--the poor, poor man!\"    It was evident that Aunt Alvirah read the miller's excitement aright.  Ruth remembered the cash-box and wondered if it had been left in the  mill while her uncle went to Cheslow? However that might be, her  attention--indeed, the attention of everybody about the mill--was  held by the reckless actions of Mr. Potter.    It was not fifteen minutes after the wave had hit the mill and torn  away a part of the outer office wall and the loading platform, or  wharf, when the racing mules came down to the turbulent stream that  lay between the Cheslow road and the Red Mill. The frightened animals  would have balked at the stream, but the miller, still standing in the  wagon, coiled the whip around his head and then lashed out with it,  laying it, like a tongue of living fire, across the mules' backs.    They were young animals and they had been unused, until this day, to  the touch of the blacksnake. They leaped forward with almost force  enough to break out of their harness, but landing in the deep water  with the wagon behind them. So far out did they leap that they went  completely under and the wagon dipped until the body was full of  water.    But there stood the miller, upright and silent, plying the whip when  they came to the surface, and urging them on. Ruth had noticed before  this that Uncle Jabez was not cruel to his team, or to his other  animals; but this was actual brutality.    However, the mules won through the flood. The turgid stream was not  wide and it was not a long fight. But there was the peril of mules,  wagon and man being swept out into the main stream of the flood and  carried over the dam.    \"He is awful! awful!\" murmured Helen, in Ruth's ear, as they clung  together and watched the miller and his outfit come through and the  mules scramble out upon solid ground.    The miller had brought his half-mad team to the mill and pulled the  mules down right beside the Cameron's automobile. Already the young  fellow who worked for him had flown out of the mill to Jabez's  assistance. He seized"]]]
