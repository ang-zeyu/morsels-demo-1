I was  getting very weak with scurvy towards the end; but as soon as the snow  melted plants began to shoot, and I was able to collect green stuff, so  that I was nearly well by the time I was picked up.\"    The weather continued fine all the time they were coasting up the  Chilian coast. They were a week at Valparaiso getting out the cargo  they had brought for that town, and did some trading at smaller ports;  but at last, just four months after leaving England, they dropped  anchor off Callao. \"Well, it has been a jolly voyage, Harry,\" his  brother said as they were rowed ashore, after a hearty farewell from  the captain and the first officer.    \"I am glad you enjoyed it, Bertie. I was sorry all the time I hadn't  taken a passage for you aft.\"    \"I am better pleased to have been at work; it would have been awfully  slow otherwise. The mates were both good fellows, and I got on well  with the other apprentices. I tried at first not to turn out on night  watch, as I was not obliged to do so, but I soon gave it up; it seemed  disgusting to be lying there when the others had to turn out. It has  been a jolly voyage, but I am glad that we are here at last, and are  going to set to work in search of treasures.\"    \"I had begun to think that we should not get on shore to-day,\" Harry  said as they neared the landing-place. \"What with three hours' waiting  for the medical officer, and another three for that bumptious official  whom they call the port officer, and without whose permission no one is  allowed to land, I think everyone on board was so disgusted that we  should have liked nothing better than to pitch the fellow overboard. It  was rather amusing to watch all those boatmen crowding round shouting  the praises of their own craft and running down the others. But a  little of it goes a long way. It is the same pretty nearly at every  port I have entered. Boatmen are harpies of the worst kind. It is lucky  that we had so little baggage; a tip of a couple of dollars was enough  to render the custom-house officer not only civil but servile.\"    As they mounted the steps they were assailed by a motley crowd, half of  whom struggled to get near them to hold out their hands for alms, while  the other half struggled and fought for the right of carrying their  baggage. Accustomed to such scenes, Harry at once seized upon two of  them, gave them the portmanteaux, and, keeping behind them, pushed them  through the crowd, telling them to lead the way to the hotel that the  captain had recommended as being the least filthy in the place. They  crossed a square covered with goods of all kinds. There were long rows  of great jars filled with native spirit, bales of cinchona bark, piles  of wheat from Chili, white and rose-coloured blocks of salt, pyramids  of unrefined sugar, and a block of great bars of silver; among these  again were bales and boxes landed from foreign countries, logs of  timber, and old anchors and chains. Numbers of people who appeared to  have nothing to do sauntered about or sat on logs. In odd corners were  native women engaged in making the picanties upon which the poor  largely exist; these were composed of fresh and salt meat, potatoes,  crabs, the juice of bitter oranges, lard, salt, and an abundance of  pepper pods.    \"That is the sort of thing we shall have to eat, Bertie.\"    \"Well, I should not mind if I had not got to look on at the making;  they smell uncommonly good.\"    The hotel was larger and even more dirty than the captain's description  had led them to expect. However, the dinner that was served to them was  better than they had looked for, and being very hungry after their long  wait, they did full justice to it.    \"It might have been a good deal worse, Bertie.\"    \"I should think so; after four months of salt junk it is splendid!\"    A cup of really good coffee, followed by a little glass of native  spirits, added to their satisfaction. They had hesitated before whether  to push on at once to Lima or wait there till next morning. Their meal  decided them--they would start at daybreak, so as to get to Lima before  the sun became really hot. Harry asked the landlord to bargain for two  riding mules and one for baggage to be ready at that hour, and they  then strolled out to view the place, although Bertie assured his  brother that there was nothing whatever to see in it.    \"That may be, Bertie; but we are not going to begin by being lazy.  There is always something to see in foreign lands by those who keep  their eyes open.\"    After an hour's walk Harry was inclined to think that his brother was  right. The houses were generally constructed of canes, plastered with  mud, and painted yellow. As the result of earthquakes, scarce a house  stood upright--some leaned sideways, and looked as if they were going  to topple over into the road; while others leaned back, as if, were you  to push against them, they would collapse and crush the inmates.    Their night was not a pleasant one. The beds were simple, consisting  only of hides stretched across wooden frames, but, as they very  speedily found, there were numerous other inhabitants. They therefore  slept but little, and were heartily glad when the first gleam of dawn  appeared.    Slipping on their clothes, they ran down to the shore and had a bath.  By the time they returned breakfast was ready--coffee, fish, and eggs.  The mules did not appear for another hour, by which time their patience  was all but exhausted. The portmanteaux were speedily strapped on to  the back of the baggage mule, and they mounted the two others. The  muleteer had brought one for himself, and, fastening the baggage animal  behind it, they started.    It was six miles to Lima, but as the city is five hundred and twelve  feet above the sea, the ascent was steady and somewhat steep. The road  was desperately bad, and the country uninteresting, being for the most  part dried up. Occasionally they saw great mounds of adobe bricks, the  remains of the ancient habitations. As they neared the town vegetation  became general, small canals irrigating the country. Here were fruit  and vegetable gardens, with oranges, plantains, vines, and flowers.    Passing through a gate in the walls they entered the town, which  afforded a pleasant contrast to the squalid misery of Callao. The city,  however, could not be called imposing; the houses were low and  irregular, fantastically painted in squares or stripes, and almost all  had great balconies shut in with trellis-work.    Few of the houses had any windows towards the street, the larger ones  being constructed with a central courtyard, into which the rooms all  opened. The streets were all built at right angles, the principal ones  leading from the grand square, in which stood the cathedral and the  palace of the Spanish viceroys, the other sides consisting of private  houses, with shops and arcades below them. The hotel to which they had  been recommended was a large building with a courtyard, with dining and  other rooms opening from it, and above them the bedrooms. In comparison  with the inn at Callao it was magnificent, but in point of cleanliness  it left a great deal to be desired. After settling themselves in their  room they went out. The change in temperature since they had left  Callao had been very great.    \"The first thing to do, Bertie, is to buy ourselves a couple of good  ponchos. You see all the natives are wearing them.\"    \"We certainly want something of the sort, Harry. I thought it was heat  that we were going to suffer from, but it seems just the other way. To  judge from the temperature we might be in Scotland, and this damp mist  chills one to the bone.\"    \"I am not much surprised, for of course I got the subject up as much as  I could before starting; and Barnett told me that Lima was altogether  an exceptional place, and that while it was bright and warm during the  winter months, from May till November on the plains only a few miles  away, even in the summer months there was almost always a clammy mist  at Lima, and that inside the house as well as outside everything  streamed with moisture. He said that this had never been satisfactorily  accounted for. Some say that it is due to the coldness of the river  here--the Rimac--which comes down from the snowy mountains. Others  think that the cold wind that always blows down the valley of the river  meets the winds from the sea here, and the moisture contained in them  is thus precipitated. I believe that a few miles higher up we shall get  out of this atmosphere altogether. Still, the ponchos will be very  useful, for it will be really cold up in the mountains. They serve for  cloaks in the daytime and blankets at night. The best are made of the  wool of the guanacos, a sort of llama. Their wool is very fine, and  before we start we will get two of coarser wool to use as blankets to  sleep on, while we have the finer ones to cover us.\"    There was no difficulty in finding a shop with the goods they wanted,  and the prices, even of the best, were very moderate. They next bought  two soft felt hats with broad brims.    \"That is ever so much more comfortable. We will wait until to-morrow  before we begin what we may call business, Bertie. Of course I shall  deliver the other letters of introduction that Mr. Barnett gave me; but  the principal one--that to his former muleteer--is more important than  all put together. If anything has happened to him, there is an end of  any chance whatever of finding treasure. Of course he may have moved  away, or be absent on a journey with his mules, in which case we shall  have either to follow him or wait for his return.\"    \"That would be a frightful nuisance.\"    \"Yes; still, it is one of the things that we foresaw might happen.\"    \"I vote we go at once, Harry, and see if he is here.\"    \"I don't think we shall find him here; for Barnett said that he lived  in the village of Miraflores, five"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/708"],[0,"The Princess and the Goblin (#9)"],[1,"hemmed him in.  His hand came upon a place where a tiny  stream of water was running down the face of the rock.  'What a stupid  I am!' he said to himself.  'I am actually at the end of my journey!  And there are the goblins coming back to fetch their things!' he added,  as the red glimmer of their torches appeared at the end of the long  avenue that led up to the cave.  In a moment he had thrown himself on  the floor, and wriggled backwards through the hole.  The floor on the  other side was several feet lower, which made it easier to get back.  It was all he could do to lift the largest stone he had taken out of  the hole, but he did manage to shove it in again.  He sat down on the  ore-heap and thought.    He was pretty sure that the latter plan of the goblins was to inundate  the mine by breaking outlets for the water accumulated in the natural  reservoirs of the mountain, as well as running through portions of it.  While the part hollowed by the miners remained shut off from that  inhabited by the goblins, they had had no opportunity of injuring them  thus; but now that a passage was broken through, and the goblins' part  proved the higher in the mountain, it was clear to Curdie that the mine  could be destroyed in an hour.  Water was always the chief danger to  which the miners were exposed.  They met with a little choke-damp  sometimes, but never with the explosive firedamp so common in  coal-mines.  Hence they were careful as soon as they saw any appearance  of water. As the result of his reflections while the goblins were busy  in their old home, it seemed to Curdie that it would be best to build  up the whole of this gang, filling it with stone, and clay or lie, so  that there should be no smallest channel for the water to get into.  There was not, however, any immediate danger, for the execution of the  goblins' plan was contingent upon the failure of that unknown design  which was to take precedence of it; and he was most anxious to keep the  door of communication open, that he might if possible discover what the  former plan was.  At the same time they could not resume their  intermitted labours for the inundation without his finding it out; when  by putting all hands to the work, the one existing outlet might in a  single night be rendered impenetrable to any weight of water; for by  filling the gang entirely up, their embankment would be buttressed by  the sides of the mountain itself.    As soon as he found that the goblins had again retired, he lighted his  lamp, and proceeded to fill the hole he had made with such stones as he  could withdraw when he pleased.  He then thought it better, as he might  have occasion to be up a good many nights after this, to go home and  have some sleep.    How pleasant the night air felt upon the outside of the mountain after  what he had gone through in the inside of it!  He hurried up the hill  without meeting a single goblin on the way, and called and tapped at  the window until he woke his father, who soon rose and let him in.  He  told him the whole story; and, just as he had expected, his father  thought it best to work that lode no farther, but at the same time to  pretend occasionally to be at work there still in order that the  goblins might have no suspicions.  Both father and son then went to bed  and slept soundly until the morning.        CHAPTER 10    The Princess's King-Papa    The weather continued fine for weeks, and the little princess went out  every day.  So long a period of fine weather had indeed never been  known upon that mountain.  The only uncomfortable thing was that her  nurse was so nervous and particular about being in before the sun was  down that often she would take to her heels when nothing worse than a  fleecy cloud crossing the sun threw a shadow on the hillside; and many  an evening they were home a full hour before the sunlight had left the  weather-cock on the stables.  If it had not been for such odd behaviour  Irene would by this time have almost forgotten the goblins.  She never  forgot Curdie, but him she remembered for his own sake, and indeed  would have remembered him if only because a princess never forgets her  debts until they are paid.    One splendid sunshiny day, about an hour after noon, Irene, who was  playing on a lawn in the garden, heard the distant blast of a bugle.  She jumped up with a cry of joy, for she knew by that particular blast  that her father was on his way to see her.  This part of the garden lay  on the slope of the hill and allowed a full view of the country below.  So she shaded her eyes with her hand and looked far away to catch the  first glimpse of shining armour. In a few moments a little troop came  glittering round the shoulder of a hill.  Spears and helmets were  sparkling and gleaming, banners were flying, horses prancing, and again  came the bugle-blast which was to her like the voice of her father  calling across the distance: 'Irene, I'm coming.'    On and on they came until she could clearly distinguish the king. He  rode a white horse and was taller than any of the men with him. He wore  a narrow circle of gold set with jewels around his helmet, and as he  came still nearer Irene could discern the flashing of the stones in the  sun.  It was a long time since he had been to see her, and her little  heart beat faster and faster as the shining troop approached, for she  loved her king-papa very dearly and was nowhere so happy as in his  arms.  When they reached a certain point, after which she could see  them no more from the garden, she ran to the gate, and there stood till  up they came, clanging and stamping, with one more bright bugle-blast  which said: 'Irene, I am come.'    By this time the people of the house were all gathered at the gate, but  Irene stood alone in front of them.  When the horsemen pulled up she  ran to the side of the white horse and held up her arms. The king  stopped and took her hands.  In an instant she was on the saddle and  clasped in his great strong arms.    I wish I could describe the king so that you could see him in your  mind.  He had gentle, blue eyes, but a nose that made him look like an  eagle.  A long dark beard, streaked with silvery lines, flowed from his  mouth almost to his waist, and as Irene sat on the saddle and hid her  glad face upon his bosom it mingled with the golden hair which her  mother had given her, and the two together were like a cloud with  streaks of the sun woven through it.  After he had held her to his  heart for a minute he spoke to his white horse, and the great beautiful  creature, which had been prancing so proudly a little while before,  walked as gently as a lady--for he knew he had a little lady on his  back--through the gate and up to the door of the house.  Then the king  set her on the ground and, dismounting, took her hand and walked with  her into the great hall, which was hardly ever entered except when he  came to see his little princess.  There he sat down, with two of his  counsellors who had accompanied him, to have some refreshment, and  Irene sat on his right hand and drank her milk out of a wooden bowl  curiously carved.    After the king had eaten and drunk he turned to the princess and said,  stroking her hair:    'Now, my child, what shall we do next?'    This was the question he almost always put to her first after their  meal together; and Irene had been waiting for it with some impatience,  for now, she thought, she should be able to settle a question which  constantly perplexed her.    'I should like you to take me to see my great old grandmother.'    The king looked grave And said:    'What does my little daughter mean?'    'I mean the Queen Irene that lives up in the tower--the very old lady,  you know, with the long hair of silver.'    The king only gazed at his little princess with a look which she could  not understand.    'She's got her crown in her bedroom,' she went on; 'but I've not been  in there yet.  You know she's there, don't you?'    'No,' said the king, very quietly.    'Then it must all be a dream,' said Irene.  'I half thought it was; but  I couldn't be sure.  Now I am sure of it.  Besides, I couldn't find her  the next time I went up.'    At that moment a snow-white pigeon flew in at an open window and  settled upon Irene's head.  She broke into a merry laugh, cowered a  little, and put up her hands to her head, saying:    'Dear dovey, don't peck me.  You'll pull out my hair with your long  claws if you don't mind.'    The king stretched out his hand to take the pigeon, but it spread its  wings and flew again through the open window, when its Whiteness made  one flash in the sun and vanished.  The king laid his hand on his  princess's head, held it back a little, gazed in her face, smiled half  a smile, and sighed half a sigh.    'Come, my child; we'll have a walk in the garden together,' he said.    'You won't come up and see my huge, great, beautiful grandmother, then,  king-papa?' said the princess.    'Not this time,' said the king very gently.  'She has not invited me,  you know, and great old ladies like her do not choose to be visited  without leave asked and given.'    The garden was a very lovely place.  Being upon a Mountainside there  were parts in it where the rocks came through in great masses, and all  immediately about them remained quite wild.  Tufts of heather grew upon  them, and other hardy mountain plants and flowers, while near them  would be lovely roses and lilies and all pleasant garden flowers.  This  mingling of the wild mountain with the civilized garden was very  quaint, and it was impossible for any number of gardeners to make such  a garden look formal and stiff.    Against one of these rocks was a garden seat, shadowed from the  afternoon sun by the overhanging of the rock itself.  There was a  little winding path up to the top of the rock, and on top another seat;  but they sat on the seat at its foot because the sun was hot; and"]]]
