The \"good\" people in our community didn't allow their boys and  girls to dance.  So, there were no dances in our neighborhood  because there were no families that wanted to be branded as being  \"not so good.\"  Instead of dances we had parties.  Many a Friday  night some good farm couple would give a party.  These parties  were always family affairs.  The young people didn't go to the  parties alone.  Their parents took them to the parties and then  the grown-ups took part in many of the games.    I remember two of the games they played.  They were \"snap\" and  \"cross questions and crooked answers.\"  There were many others  but I can't recall them just now.  I was only eleven when we  moved out of that community, and we never had such parties at any  place we lived after that.    One night at one of the parties, Frank's girl \"snapped\" me.  (We  didn't call them girl-friends as we do today, just \"Girls.\") But  I was so timid I just backed away like the bashful country kid  that I was.  She told them she got \"stood-up\" and would have to  pick someone else.    I wanted to play in the games, but I realized that I was much  smaller than any of the others who took part in them, and I was  afraid I might do something wrong and cause them to laugh at me.    Two of the party song-and-dance \"swings\" they did were \"Shoot the  Buffalo\" and \"Farmer by the Mill.\"  These were the promenade type  dances where they swung their partners kind of like in a square  dance.  Mr. Flint was about the best man in the neighborhood at  calling those dances.    Now I have gone and contradicted myself.  I first said we didn't  have dances.  Now I'm telling you we danced.  But this was not  the kind of dance where they waltzed around in each other's arms.  They were party dances.    When the party activities got under way, the people were seated  all around the room next to the walls.  Usually some were  standing in the adjoining rooms also, looking through the doors,  because the living room wasn't large enough to hold the crowd.  When that many came to a party, it was considered a good party.    A large crowd was just what they wanted.  More people meant more  games and more happy people playing games.  In general, when  there was a large crowd, things moved along at a faster pace.    The game of \"snap\" was usually played by the young set--that is,  the sweetheart set who enjoyed holding hands and chasing after  each other.    The game was easy to get started.  All it took was a girl and a  boy to stand in the middle of the room and hold hands, facing  each other.  Then the girls would \"volunteer\" one of their crowd  and push her forward to be \"it.\"  Then the \"it\" girl would circle  the room looking for the boy she wanted for a partner.  When she  found him, she would snap her fingers in front of his face, just  as you would in school when you wanted to get the teacher's  attention.    This snap told the boy that he was her chosen, at least for a few  minutes.  As soon as she snapped her fingers, she would hurry to  the couple in the middle of the room and the boy she \"snapped\"  would chase after her.  His object was to touch the girl, and her  object was to try to prevent his touching her.    She would try to prolong the chase by dodging and sometimes  swinging around the couple in the center of the room.  And  sometimes the couple would prolong the chase by favoring the  girl.  They might raise their arms to let the girl go through  between them and then lower their arms quickly to stop the boy.  Or, if the boy was having a hard time catching her, they might  let her start through between them and then lower their arms  quickly and trap her in their arms.    As soon as the boy touched the girl, the chase was ended.  Then  the couple who had held hands would leave and let the new couple  hold hands in the center of the room while another chase took  place.    This was not only a holding-hands game, at times it became a  body-  contact game.  And yet, not too much contact, because the grown-  ups were watching.  Anyway, snap was a popular game at our  parties.    Now, this Friday night the party might be at the Johnsons, but  before the party was over, you could bet good money that the  teen-  agers would have talked another family into giving a party next  Friday night.    These were strictly play parties.  There were no refreshments  served, not a lot of cooking and fixing.  Just make sure the  house is clean, the yard is clean, and there are plenty of places  to park buggies, hacks, and wagons.  Then hope a big crowd begins  gathering soon after sundown.    Parties were preferred over dances because it was considered  immoral for a boy to put his arm around a girl before they were  married.  Sweethearts could hold hands in the presence of adults,  if it were in the process of playing a game.  But just to sit  this one out and hold hands was unthinkable.    A \"good\" mother would never tell her daughter it was all right  for her to hold hands in public, or to hug and kiss anywhere, on  her way to church or anywhere else, either afoot or in a buggy--  not even at night.    Somehow, I just can't help but believe that parents knew these  little things were going on between lovers, but they seemed to  think that if they told their kids it was all right for them to  do these things, it would be like saying \"sic 'em\" to a dog.  Putting it another way, parents were saying, \"Don't ever let me  catch you doing such things.\"  And the kids were not actually  saying but were thinking, \"Okay, I'll try not to let you catch me  when I do them.\"    Dances were looked down upon because they attracted boys who  drank, and girls with loose morals.  There were some boys and  girls who lived six or eight miles from us who were not wanted at  some of the parties given in our neighborhood, and were not  invited by some of our neighbors who were giving the parties.    But when my parents gave a party at our house, they invited  everyone who would come.  They thought it unmannerly to invite  certain ones and leave others out.  They seemed to figure that  their integrity would demand respect from the worst of them--and  it did.  There never was any trouble at our house--no drinking,  no fighting, no \"cussing.\"    I remember one of those parties when some young people came in a  buggy from quite a distance away.  I think I was about nine years  old and, of course, I didn't know all about everything that went  on around me but I knew enough to realize there were some bad  feelings between their families and some of those in our  immediate neighborhood.  The main reason seemed to be that those  youngsters attended dances in other communities and some parents  in our neighborhood sure didn't approve of that.    The incident I remember had to do with their buggy horse which  got sick with a severe attack of colic while the party was going  on.  Someone had wandered outside and had discovered the horse in  great pain.  The boy who owned the animal had seen the disease  before and knew how quickly it could kill a good horse.  So he  offered to sell the animal to anyone for $10.  It would have been  a bargain for Papa, because he knew exactly what to do to cure  the horse.  And the horse was probably worth $50.    When Papa learned about the problem, he got a quart bottle,  filled it about a quarter-full of soda and then added about a  half-quart of kerosene.  Then he climbed up in a tree, pulled the  horse's head high in the air with the bridle reins and poured the  mixture down his throat.  Within ten minutes, the horse was  without pain and resting comfortably, except for a mighty bad  taste in his mouth.    I think the boy was truly grateful that Papa had not taken  advantage of him by buying the horse.  Will Johnson knew that a  good name was rather to be chosen than the value of a buggy  horse.    Along with sweethearts, there were a few other things I didn't  understand altogether.  One time during my younger days, I cut  out a picture of a baby buggy from a Sears, Roebuck catalog.  I  don't remember just how old I was at the time.  I was old enough  to do a pretty good job of cutting out, but I didn't do so well  with my reasoning.  I was disappointed to learn that the buggy  wouldn't sit up and roll.    That was not altogether a case of stupidity but rather, a lack of  research.  This was part of the research through which I learned  about the third dimension.    It's hard to believe a kid that stupid could become so smart  within the next few years and retain that smartness for the rest  of his life.    We also learned--not through research, but from concerned  parents, about the choice of words to use, the careful choice, I  might add.    Some words were strictly forbidden.  The word \"bull\" was one of  them.  We didn't dare use that word in the presence of Papa or  Mama.  And if any of the other kids heard us use it, they would  tattle on us.  So, we just didn't use it.  We were taught to use  the word \"surley\" instead.    As late as 1940 I knew middle-aged men who would not use the word  \"bull\" before a woman.  One old farmer said, \"I don't know what  the world is coming to.  I believe the time will come when men  and women will use the word 'bull' in mixed company and think  nothing of it.\"    But that was in farming country.  In cattle country it was  different.  I'll bet a ranch boy wouldn't have known what a  surley was.  One of my rancher uncles was talking to a farmer who  had some calves he wanted to sell to the rancher.  He told the  rancher, \"Three of those calves are still nursing.\"  Well, my  uncle and his daughter had to put forth an effort to hold back  their laughter.  They were not used to nursing calves.  In cattle  country calves don't nurse, they suck.    Continuing along that same line, up until I was a teenager, I  never heard the words \"sex\" or \"male\" or \"female\" used except by  some dirty-m"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54331"],[0,"Life of a Pioneer: Being the Autobiography of James S. Brown (#9)"],[1,"y, but should allow one  of the other boys to go in my stead. But I could not see it in that  light. While father was talking of the matter to mother I overheard  him say, \"We will have to let James go, for he will not be satisfied  without, but he will get enough of it when he has had a few days, and  has camped out and shaken a few times with the ague.\" I thought to  myself, \"You are mistaken, father, for I would rather die than be left  behind.\"          CHAPTER III.

MAY 1st, 1846, was a pleasant day, and we made our start for Nauvoo,  passing through Versailles to a point some ten miles from home to the  first night's camp. I was encouraged to think I had kept so well, but  about ten o'clock the second day I began to shake, and my teeth fairly  to crack. I prayed earnestly to the Lord to heal me. I was quite weak,  and all thought me very sick. But that was the last \"shake\" I had, for  I began to get well from that time.    It was on May 4th, I believe, that we reached Nauvoo, having passed  through Mount Sterling, the county seat of Brown County, also through  Carthage, where the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother the Patriarch  Hyrum Smith had been assassinated. We found the roads so muddy and such  hard traveling that we did not make more than fifteen miles a day. When  we came in sight of the Temple at Nauvoo our hearts were filled with  mingled joy and sorrow--joy that we had seen the Temple of the Lord,  and sorrow that the Saints had been so cruelly driven from it.    As we passed through the city we saw many houses which had been  abandoned--indeed, the city itself seemed almost deserted. At some of  the houses stood covered wagons, into which people were packing goods  preparatory to their flight into the wilderness, they knew not where.    Looking westward across the great Mississippi River, we saw long trains  of wagons strung out over the high rolling prairie. The country was  new, and the roads muddy, so we rested three or four days, visiting the  Temple and viewing the city that was beautiful for situation, but now  was left with few inhabitants. Everything in and about the city that  formerly hummed with industry and life was now lonely, saddened, and  forlorn, and silent but for the preparations for flight by the remnant  therein.    About the 8th of May we crossed the great \"father of waters\" and  joined the \"rolling kingdom\" on its westward journey. We found friends  and acquaintances, made up a company of our own, and passed and were  repassed on the trip. Climbing an eminence from which we looked east  and west, covered wagons could be seen as far as the eye could reach.  The teams were made up of oxen, milch cows, two-year-old steers and  heifers, and very few horses and mules. The teamsters were of both  sexes, and comprised young and old. The people who could walk did so,  and many were engaged in driving loose stock.    Hundreds of teams stuck in the mud, and we had to double-up and help  one another out. Many times we had to wade in mud half to our knees and  lift our wagons out of the mire. In this the women not infrequently  would join their husbands and sons, and the old adage came true in  numerous instances--women for a dead lift; when they plunged into the  mud and put their shoulders to the wheels the men were urged to do  double effort, and the wagon always rolled out and onward, at the rate  of twelve to fifteen miles per day.    At every creek we found campers, some repairing wagons, yokes, chains,  etc., doctoring sick cattle, washing clothes, or helping forward  friends whose teams were weak. In all this there was excellent order,  for the camps were organized in a general way by tens, fifties and  hundreds. Peace and harmony prevailed all along the line. Evening  prayers were attended to in each camp. There was much singing, mostly  of sacred hymns or sentimental songs; and from no quarter could coarse  songs be heard. Sometimes the camp would meet in a sociable dance in  the evenings, to drive dull care away; and then there always was good  order and the most perfect friendship and peace.    The camps were instructed not to kill game of any kind to waste its  flesh; they were not even to kill a snake on the road, for it was their  calling to establish peace on earth, and good will toward man and  beast. Thus all went on in peace and order.    At one of the headwaters of the Grand River, Iowa, we found some  hundreds of people putting in gardens and field crops (corn and  potatoes). A few cabins had been built, so father and our party decided  to stop there. We put in a few acres of corn and garden stuff, then  father returned to Illinois to bring up the rest of the family, leaving  my Uncle Alexander Stephens and myself to look after the crop and  stock, which we did faithfully.    About the 6th of July we heard that President Young and several of the  Twelve Apostles had returned from the most advanced companies, and  that there would be a meeting held at the white oak grove--the usual  place of meeting--the next day. There was also a rumor in camp that a  government recruiting officer had come to enlist volunteers, for the  United States had declared war against Mexico.    Of course this latter tidings was a great surprise, as the Mormons had  been denied protection against mob violence and had been forced beyond  the borders of civilization in the United States, and our camps were  stretched out in an Indian country, from the Mississippi River to the  Missouri. Surprised as we were at the government's demand, we were  still more so to think that our leaders would entertain for a moment  the idea of encouraging compliance therewith. Yet rumor said that  President Young and the prominent men with him had come as recruiting  officers as well.    All who could be spared from the tents went eagerly to the White Oak  grove, and there learned that the rumors were true. The United States  government demanded that a battalion of five hundred men be raised  by the Mormon Church, then fleeing from mob violence for the want of  protection by that government whose right and duty it was to protect  them. The men of the moving camp were required to leave their families  in the wilderness, almost unprotected, and go to a foreign land to  fight their country's battles.    But wonders never cease. The leading men among the Mormons--Brigham  Young, Heber C. Kimball, Wilford Woodruff, and others of the Twelve  Apostles--stood before the people and called for volunteers to engage  in the Mexican war, saying that the five hundred men must be raised if  it took the whole strength of the camp to do it. If the young men would  not enlist, the middle-aged and old men would, said President Young;  the demand of our country should be met if it took the Twelve Apostles  and the High Priests.    At the close of the meeting there were many who were enthused, while  others appeared confused and did not seem to catch the spirit of  the matter. I was not yet a member of the Church, but all the old  stories of the war of the Revolution and that of 1812, with the later  Black Hawk Indian wars, brightened in my memory so that the spirit  of the patriots awoke within me, and although I was averse to war  and bloodshed, I had a desire to serve my country in any legitimate  way. Yet I felt that, as I was under age, and, as my Uncle Alexander  Stephens had decided to enlist, the responsibility of my father's  affairs now rested on me.    My uncle and I were standing by the roadside talking over the  situation, when along came Ezra T. Benson, who had been recently  selected as one of the Twelve Apostles; there also came Richmond  Louder, one of my associates from boyhood, and Matthew Caldwell.  Richmond Louder and I had talked previously of being baptized together.  He said they were going down to attend to that sacred ordinance, and  invited me to accompany them, which I did gladly. We went to the south  fork of the Grand River, and with Uncle A. Stephens as a witness were  baptized. This was on the 7th of July, 1846. Then we went to the house  of General Charles C. Rich, where we were confirmed, I think under the  hands of Elders Willard Richards and Ezra T. Benson, in the presence of  President Brigham Young and others of the Twelve Apostles.    This done, the happiest feeling of my life came over me. I thought I  would to God that all the inhabitants of the earth could experience  what I had done as a witness of the Gospel. It seemed to me that, if  they could see and feel as I did, the whole of humankind would join  with us in one grand brotherhood, and the universe would be prepared  for the great Millennial morn.    When we returned to camp, my aunts partook of the same feeling that  had filled me. Then I got the spirit to enlist, and after a short  consultation with those most concerned they advised me to lay the  matter before Ezra T. Benson. Accordingly, the next morning Uncle A.  Stephens and I went over to the grove. I told the Elder my feelings,  and the responsibilities left upon me by my father. Elder Benson said  the Spirit's promptings to me were right, and I had started right. He  told me to go on, saying I would be blessed, my father would find  no fault with me, his business would "]]]
