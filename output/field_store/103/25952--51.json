[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/85"],[0,"The Beasts of Tarzan (#9)"],[1,", the ape-man raced after the  terror-stricken black.  In the white man's mind was a new plan,  awakened by sight of the war-canoe.  If these men had come to his  island from another, or from the mainland, why not utilize their craft  to make his way to the country from which they had come?  Evidently it  was an inhabited country, and no doubt had occasional intercourse with  the mainland, if it were not itself upon the continent of Africa.    A heavy hand fell upon the shoulder of the escaping Mugambi before he  was aware that he was being pursued, and as he turned to do battle with  his assailant giant fingers closed about his wrists and he was hurled  to earth with a giant astride him before he could strike a blow in his  own defence.    In the language of the West Coast, Tarzan spoke to the prostrate man  beneath him.    \"Who are you?\" he asked.    \"Mugambi, chief of the Wagambi,\" replied the black.    \"I will spare your life,\" said Tarzan, \"if you will promise to help me  to leave this island.  What do you answer?\"    \"I will help you,\" replied Mugambi.  \"But now that you have killed all  my warriors, I do not know that even I can leave your country, for  there will be none to wield the paddles, and without paddlers we cannot  cross the water.\"    Tarzan rose and allowed his prisoner to come to his feet.   The fellow  was a magnificent specimen of manhood--a black counterpart in physique  of the splendid white man whom he faced.    \"Come!\" said the ape-man, and started back in the direction from which  they could hear the snarling and growling of the feasting pack.  Mugambi drew back.    \"They will kill us,\" he said.    \"I think not,\" replied Tarzan.  \"They are mine.\"    Still the black hesitated, fearful of the consequences of approaching  the terrible creatures that were dining upon the bodies of his  warriors; but Tarzan forced him to accompany him, and presently the two  emerged from the jungle in full view of the grisly spectacle upon the  beach.  At sight of the men the beasts looked up with menacing growls,  but Tarzan strode in among them, dragging the trembling Wagambi with  him.    As he had taught the apes to accept Sheeta, so he taught them to adopt  Mugambi as well, and much more easily; but Sheeta seemed quite unable  to understand that though he had been called upon to devour Mugambi's  warriors he was not to be allowed to proceed after the same fashion  with Mugambi.   However, being well filled, he contented himself with  walking round the terror-stricken savage, emitting low, menacing growls  the while he kept his flaming, baleful eyes riveted upon the black.    Mugambi, on his part, clung closely to Tarzan, so that the ape-man  could scarce control his laughter at the pitiable condition to which  the chief's fear had reduced him; but at length the white took the  great cat by the scruff of the neck and, dragging it quite close to the  Wagambi, slapped it sharply upon the nose each time that it growled at  the stranger.    At the sight of the thing--a man mauling with his bare hands one of the  most relentless and fierce of the jungle carnivora--Mugambi's eyes  bulged from their sockets, and from entertaining a sullen respect for  the giant white man who had made him prisoner, the black felt an almost  worshipping awe of Tarzan.    The education of Sheeta progressed so well that in a short time Mugambi  ceased to be the object of his hungry attention, and the black felt a  degree more of safety in his society.    To say that Mugambi was entirely happy or at ease in his new  environment would not be to adhere strictly to the truth.  His eyes  were constantly rolling apprehensively from side to side as now one and  now another of the fierce pack chanced to wander near him, so that for  the most of the time it was principally the whites that showed.    Together Tarzan and Mugambi, with Sheeta and Akut, lay in wait at the  ford for a deer, and when at a word from the ape-man the four of them  leaped out upon the affrighted animal the black was sure that the poor  creature died of fright before ever one of the great beasts touched it.    Mugambi built a fire and cooked his portion of the kill; but Tarzan,  Sheeta, and Akut tore theirs, raw, with their sharp teeth, growling  among themselves when one ventured to encroach upon the share of  another.    It was not, after all, strange that the white man's ways should have  been so much more nearly related to those of the beasts than were the  savage blacks.  We are, all of us, creatures of habit, and when the  seeming necessity for schooling ourselves in new ways ceases to exist,  we fall naturally and easily into the manners and customs which long  usage has implanted ineradicably within us.    Mugambi from childhood had eaten no meat until it had been cooked,  while Tarzan, on the other hand, had never tasted cooked food of any  sort until he had grown almost to manhood, and only within the past  three or four years had he eaten cooked meat.  Not only did the habit  of a lifetime prompt him to eat it raw, but the craving of his palate  as well; for to him cooked flesh was spoiled flesh when compared with  the rich and juicy meat of a fresh, hot kill.    That he could, with relish, eat raw meat that had been buried by  himself weeks before, and enjoy small rodents and disgusting grubs,  seems to us who have been always \"civilized\" a revolting fact; but had  we learned in childhood to eat these things, and had we seen all those  about us eat them, they would seem no more sickening to us now than do  many of our greatest dainties, at which a savage African cannibal would  look with repugnance and turn up his nose.    For instance, there is a tribe in the vicinity of Lake Rudolph that  will eat no sheep or cattle, though its next neighbors do so.  Near by  is another tribe that eats donkey-meat--a custom most revolting to the  surrounding tribes that do not eat donkey.  So who may say that it is  nice to eat snails and frogs' legs and oysters, but disgusting to feed  upon grubs and beetles, or that a raw oyster, hoof, horns, and tail, is  less revolting than the sweet, clean meat of a fresh-killed buck?    The next few days Tarzan devoted to the weaving of a barkcloth sail  with which to equip the canoe, for he despaired of being able to teach  the apes to wield the paddles, though he did manage to get several of  them to embark in the frail craft which he and Mugambi paddled about  inside the reef where the water was quite smooth.    During these trips he had placed paddles in their hands, when they  attempted to imitate the movements of him and Mugambi, but so difficult  is it for them long to concentrate upon a thing that he soon saw that  it would require weeks of patient training before they would be able to  make any effective use of these new implements, if, in fact, they  should ever do so.    There was one exception, however, and he was Akut.  Almost from the  first he showed an interest in this new sport that revealed a much  higher plane of intelligence than that attained by any of his tribe.  He seemed to grasp the purpose of the paddles, and when Tarzan saw that  this was so he took much pains to explain in the meagre language of the  anthropoid how they might be used to the best advantage.    From Mugambi Tarzan learned that the mainland lay but a short distance  from the island.  It seemed that the Wagambi warriors had ventured too  far out in their frail craft, and when caught by a heavy tide and a  high wind from off-shore they had been driven out of sight of land.  After paddling for a whole night, thinking that they were headed for  home, they had seen this land at sunrise, and, still taking it for the  mainland, had hailed it with joy, nor had Mugambi been aware that it  was an island until Tarzan had told him that this was the fact.    The Wagambi chief was quite dubious as to the sail, for he had never  seen such a contrivance used.  His country lay far up the broad Ugambi  River, and this was the first occasion that any of his people had found  their way to the ocean.    Tarzan, however, was confident that with a good west wind he could  navigate the little craft to the mainland.  At any rate, he decided, it  would be preferable to perish on the way than to remain indefinitely  upon this evidently uncharted island to which no ships might ever be  expected to come.    And so it was that when the first fair wind rose he embarked upon his  cruise, and with him he took as strange and fearsome a crew as ever  sailed under a savage master.    Mugambi and Akut went with him, and Sheeta, the panther, and a dozen  great males of the tribe of Akut.          Chapter 6    A Hideous Crew      The war-canoe with its savage load moved slowly toward the break in the  reef through which it must pass to gain the open sea.  Tarzan, Mugambi,  and Akut wielded the paddles, for the shore kept the west wind from the  little sail.    Sheeta crouched in the bow at the ape-man's feet, for it had seemed  best to Tarzan always to keep the wicked beast as far from the other  members of the party as possible, since it would require little or no  provocation to send him at the throat of any than the white man, whom  he evidently now looked upon as his master.    In the stern was Mugambi, and just in front of him squatted Akut, while  between Akut and Tarzan the twelve hairy apes sat upon their haunches,  blinking dubiously this way and that, and now and then turning their  eyes longingly back toward shore.    All went well until the canoe had passed beyond the reef.   Here the  breeze struck the sail, sending the rude craft lunging among the waves  that ran higher and higher as they drew away from the shore.    With the tossing of the boat the apes became panic-stricken.  They  first moved uneasily about, and then commenced grumbling and whining.  With difficulty Akut kept them in hand for a time; but when a  particularly large wave struck the dugout"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8502"],[0,"Common Diseases of Farm Animals (#9)"],[1,"be  withheld. Morphine may be given hypodermically to the large animals after a  period of six to eight hours following the administration of the physic.    The following formula is quite useful in checking diarrhoea: salol one-half  ounce, bismuth subnitrate one ounce, and bicarbonate of soda two ounces.  The dose of this mixture is from one to four drachms, depending on the size  of the animal, three or four times a day.    WHITE SCOURS OR DIARRHOEA IN YOUNG ANIMALS.--Young animals, when nursing  the mother or fed by hand, frequently develop congestion and inflammation  of the stomach and intestines. This disorder is characterized by a  diarrhoea.    _The causes_ may be grouped under two heads: wrong methods of feeding and  care, and specific infection.    The first milk of the mother is a natural laxative and aids in ridding the  intestine of the young of such waste material (meconium) as collects during  fetal life. If this milk is withheld, the intestine becomes irritated,  constipation occurs, followed by a diarrhoea or serious symptoms of a  nervous character, caused by the poisonous effect of the toxic substances  absorbed from the intestine on the nervous system.    Changes in the ration fed the mother, excitement, unusual exercise and  disease change the composition of the mother's milk. Such milk is  irritating to the stomach and intestines of the young. This irritation does  not always develop into a diarrhoea, but may result in a congestion of the  stomach.    When the young are raised artificially or by hand, and fed milk from  different mothers of the same or different species, or changed from whole  to skim milk, acute and chronic digestive disorders that are accompanied by  a diarrhoea are common. Feeding calves from filthy pails, allowing them to  drink too rapidly and giving them fermented milk are common causes of  scours.    White scours caused by irritating germs is a highly infectious disease. The  disease-producing germs gain entrance to the body by way of the digestive  tract and the umbilical cord.    Insanitary conditions, such as dark, cold, damp, filthy quarters, lower the  vitality of young animals, and predispose them to digestive disorders as  well as other diseases.    _The symptoms_ are as follows: Constipation accompanied by a feverish  condition precedes the diarrhoea; colicky pains are sometimes manifested;  the diarrhoea is usually accompanied by depression, falling off in appetite  and weakness. At first the intestinal discharges are not very foul  smelling; later the odor is very disagreeable. The faeces may be made up  largely of undigested, decomposed milk that adheres to the tail and hind  parts. If the diarrhoea is severe, the animal refuses to suckle or drink  from the pail, and loses flesh rapidly. It is usually found lying down. The  ears droop and the depression is marked. The body temperature may vary from  several degrees above to below the average normal.    _The infectious form_ of white scours may be diagnosed by the history of  the outbreak. In this form of the disease, a large percentage of the young  are affected and the death-rate is very high.    Calves and lambs frequently die of an acute congestion of the fourth  stomach. In this disease, the symptoms appear shortly after feeding. It is  characterized by colicky pains, convulsions and coma.    _The treatment_ is largely preventive. Young animals should be provided  with dry, clean, well-ventilated quarters and allowed plenty of exercise.  Colts thrive best if allowed to run in a blue grass pasture with the  mother. If the mother is worked, suitable provisions in the way of quarters  and frequent nursing should be provided. Calves, lambs and pigs are the  most frequent sufferers from insanitary quarters. In breeding, we should  always strive to get strong, vigorous, healthy young. The care given the  mother in the way of exercise and feeding is an important factor here.    The first milk of the mother should not be withheld from the young,  especially if the animal is raised by hand. We must also feed it regularly  and not too much at any one time. Any change in the milk should be made  gradually, and it is usually advisable to reduce the ration slightly when  such a change is made, so as not to overwork the digestive organs. Pails  and bottles from which the animal feeds should be kept clean.    Colts raised on cow's milk must be fed and cared for carefully. The milk  must be sweet and made more digestible by diluting it with one-third water.  A little sugar may be added. It is very advisable to add from one-half to  one ounce of lime water to each pint of milk fed. Frequent feeding is very  necessary at first, and we must not underestimate the quantity of milk  necessary to keep the colt in good condition. It should be taught to eat  grain as soon as possible.    Because of the irritated condition of the stomach and intestine, the animal  suffering from diarrhoea is unable to digest its feed. For this reason it  is very important to withhold all feed for at least twelve hours. Water  should be provided. The alimentary tract is relieved of the irritating  material by giving the animal a physic of castor or linseed oil. The dose  varies from one-quarter to one-half ounce for the lamb and from one to four  ounces for the colt or calf. It is advisable in most cases to follow this  with the following mixture: bicarbonate of soda one ounce, bismuth  subnitrate one-half ounce, and salol one-quarter ounce. The dose for the  colt and calf is one teaspoonful three times a day. Lambs and pigs may be  given from one-fourth to one-half the above dose.    It is usually advisable to give ewes and sows a physic if their young  develop a diarrhoea. Mothers that are heavy milkers may be given a physic  the second or third day following birth. The ration should be reduced as  well during the first week.    DISEASES OF THE DIGESTIVE TRACT OF POULTRY    GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The digestive tract of poultry is composed of the  following organs: mouth, gullet, crop, stomach, gizzard and intestines,  with the two large glands, the liver and pancreas. The digestion of the  feed begins in the crop. Here the feed is held for a short time, mixed with  certain fluids and softened. On reaching the stomach it becomes mixed with  the digestive fluid secreted by the gastric glands. This second digestive  action consists in thoroughly soaking the feed in the gastric juice, making  it soft and preparing it for maceration by the heavily muscled gizzard.  Following maceration it passes into the intestine. It is here that the  digestive action is completed and absorption occurs.    Under the conditions of domestication, poultry are subject to a great  variety of intestinal disorders.    DISEASES OF THE CROP.--Impaction and inflammation are the two common  diseases of the crop. _Large, impacted crops_ are usually caused by the  feeding of too much dry feed, fermentation of the contents of the crop and  foreign bodies that obstruct the opening from the organ.    _Inflammation of the crop_ is caused by excessive use of condiments in the  feed, putrid or spoiled feeds and eating caustic drugs, such as lime and  rat poison.    _The symptoms_ are dulness, an indisposition to move about, drooping wings  and efforts to eject gases and liquids. The crop is found greatly distended  and either hard or soft, depending on the quantity of feed present and the  cause of the distention. If fermentation is present the crop usually feels  soft.    _The preventive treatment_ consists in practising proper methods of  feeding. The _curative treatment_ of a recent case consists in manipulating  the mass of feed, breaking it up and forcing it upwards toward the mouth.  If difficulty in breaking up the mass is experienced, it is advisable to  administer a tablespoonful of castor oil to the bird.    If the above manipulations are unsuccessful, an operation is necessary.  This consists in making an opening through the skin and the wall of the  crop and removing the contents with tweezers. The opening must be closed  with sutures. The proper aseptic precautions must be observed.    In inflammation of the crop, the bird should be dieted for at least one  day, and one teaspoonful of castor oil given as a laxative.    ACUTE AND CHRONIC INDIGESTION.--The recognition of special forms of  indigestion in poultry is difficult. A flock of poultry that is subject to  careless and indifferent care may not thrive and a number of the birds  develop digestive disorders. This may be indicated by an abnormal or  depraved appetite and emaciated condition. Constipation or diarrhoea may  occur. In the more severe cases the bird acts dull, the feathers are  ruffled and it moves about very little.    _The treatment_ consists in removing the cause, and giving the flock a  tonic mixture in the feed. The following mixture may be used: powdered  gentian and powdered ginger, eight ounces of each, Glauber's salts four  ounces, and sulfate of iron two ounces. One ounce of the above mixture may  be given in ten pounds of feed.    WHITE DIARRHOEA OF YOUNG CHICKENS.--White diarrhoea is of the greatest  economic importance to the poultryman. The loss of chicks from this disease  is greater than the combined loss resulting from all other diseases. It is  stated by some authors that not less than fifty per cent of the chickens  hatched die from white diarrhoea.    Such a heavy death-rate as is attributed to this disease can not result  from improper methods of handling and insanitary conditions. Before it was  proven that white diarrhoea was caused by specific germs, a great deal of  emphasis was placed on such causes as debilitated breeding stock, improper  incubation, poorly ventilated, overcrowded brooders, too high or too low  temperatures and filth. Such conditions are important predisposing factors,  and may, in isolated cases, result in serious intestinal disorders.    _The"]]]
