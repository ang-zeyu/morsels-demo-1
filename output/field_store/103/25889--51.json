Do you  send a man ashore to cast off the hawser at the bow. Let him take  a line ashore with him so as to ease the hawser off, and not let  the end fall in the water. The moment he has done that let him  come to the stern and get on board there, and do you and he get  the plank on board as noiselessly as you can. As soon as the bow  hawser is on board I will give the men in the boat the word to  row. Ned will be on board her, and see that they row in the right  direction. The moment you have got the plank in get out your knife  and cut the stern warp half through, and directly her head is out,  and you feel the strain, sever it. The stern is so close to the  wharf that the end will not be able to drop down into the water  and make a splash.\"    Ned's orders were that as soon as the vessel's head pointed seaward  he was to steer rather to the right, so as to prevent the stream,  which, however, ran but feebly, from carrying her down on the bows  of the French ship. Once beyond the latter he was to go straight  out, steering by the lights on shore. The men were enjoined to drop  their oars as quietly as possible into the water at each stroke,  and to row deeply, as having the vessel in tow they would churn up  the water unless they did so. The boat rowed off a stroke or two,  and then, as the rope tightened, the men sat quiet until Captain  Martin was heard to give the order to row in a low tone; then they  bent to their oars. Peters had chosen the six best rowers on board  the ship for the purpose, and so quietly did they dip their oars  in the water that Captain Martin could scarce hear the sound, and  only knew by looking over the other side, and seeing that the shore  was receding, that the ship was in motion. Two minutes later Peters  came forward.    \"I have cut the warp, Captain Martin, and she is moving out. I have  left Watson at the helm.\" Scarce a word was spoken for the next  five minutes. It was only by looking at the light ashore that they  could judge the progress they were making. Every one breathed more  freely now the first danger was over. They had got out from their  berth without attracting the slightest notice, either from the  shore or from the ships lying next to them. Their next danger was  from the ships lying at anchor off the port waiting their turn to  come in. Were they to run against one of these, the sound of the  collision, and perhaps the breaking of spars and the shouts of the  crew, would certainly excite attention from the sentries on shore.    So far the boat had been rowing but a short distance in advance of  the end of the bowsprit, but Captain Martin now made his way out  to the end of that spar, and told Ned that he was going to give  him a good deal more rope in order that he might keep well ahead,  and that he was to keep a sharp lookout for craft at anchor. Another  quarter of an hour passed, and Captain Martin thought that they  must now be beyond the line of the outer shipping. They felt the  wind more now that they were getting beyond the shelter of the  town, and its effect upon the hull and spars made the work lighter  for those in the boat ahead.    \"Now, Peters, I think that we can safely spread the foresail and  call them in from the boat.\"    The sail had been already loosed and was now let fall; it bellied  out at once.    \"Haul in the sheets, lads,\" Captain Martin said, and going forward  gave a low whistle. A minute later the boat was alongside. \"Let  her drop astern, Peters,\" the captain said, as Ned and the rowers  clambered on board; \"we may want her presently. Hullo! what's that?  It's one of the guard boats, I do believe, and coming this way.\"  The men heard the sound of coming oars, and silently stole to the  mast and armed themselves with the pikes, put the axes in their  belts, and ranged themselves along by the side of the ship towards  which the boat was approaching. \"Will she go ahead of us or astern?\"  Captain Martin whispered to the mate.    \"I cannot tell yet, sir. By the sound she seems making pretty nearly  straight for us.\"    \"How unfortunate,\" Captain Martin murmured; \"just as it seemed that  we were getting safely away.\"    In another minute the mate whispered, \"She will go astern of us,  sir, but not by much.\"    \"I trust that she will not see us,\" the captain said. \"But now we  are away from the town and the lights, it doesn't seem so dark,  besides their eyes are accustomed to it.\"    There was dead silence in the ship as the boat approached. She was  just passing the stern at the distance of about a ship's length,  when there was a sudden exclamation, and a voice shouted, \"What  ship is that? Where are you going?\" Captain Martin replied in Dutch.  \"We are taking advantage of the wind to make to sea.\"    \"Down with that sail, sir!\" the officer shouted: \"this is against  all regulations. No ship is permitted to leave the port between  sunrise and sunset. Pull alongside, lads; there is something strange  about this!\"    \"Do not come alongside,\" Captain Martin said sternly. \"We are  peaceable traders who meddle with no one, but if you interfere with  us it will be the worse for you.\"    \"You insolent hound!\" the officer exclaimed furiously, \"do you  dare to threaten me. Blow your matches, lads, and shoulder your  arquebuses. There is treason and rebellion here.\"    Those on board saw six tiny sparks appear, two in the bow and four  in the stern. A minute later the boat dashed alongside. As it did  so three great pieces of stone were cast into it, knocking down  two of the rowers.    \"Fire!\" the officer exclaimed as he sprang up to climb the ship's  side. The six muskets were discharged, and the men rose to follow  their leader, when there was a cry from the rowers \"The boat is  sinking! She is staved in!\"    At the same moment the officer fell back thrust through with a pike.  Two of the soldiers were cut down with axes, the other sprang back  into the sinking boat, which at once drifted astern.    \"Up with her sails, lads!\" Captain Martin shouted; \"it is a question  of speed now. The alarm is spread on shore already.\" The sentries  of the various batteries were discharging their muskets and shouting,  and the roll of a drum was heard almost immediately. The crew soon  had every stitch of sail set upon the brig. She was moving steadily  through the water; but the wind was still light, although occasionally  a stronger puff gave ground for hope that it would ere long blow  harder.    \"They will be some time before they make out what it is all about,  Peters,\" Captain Martin said. \"The galleys will be manned, and will  row to the spot where the firing was heard. Some of the men in the  boat are sure to be able to swim, and will meet them as they come  out and tell them what has happened. The worst of it is, the moon  will be up in a few minutes. I forgot all about that. That accounts  for its being lighter. However, we have got a good start. One or  two guard boats may be out here in a quarter of an hour, but it  will take the galleys twice as long to gather their crews and get  out. It all depends on the wind. It is lucky it is not light yet,  or the batteries might open on us; I don't think now they will get  sight of us until we are fairly out of range.\"    Now that there was no longer occasion for silence on board the Good  Venture, the crew laughed and joked at the expense of the Spaniards.  They were in high spirits at their success, and their only regret  was that the brush with their pursuers had not been a more serious  one. It was evident from the talk that there was quite as much hope  as fear in the glances that they cast astern, and that they would  have been by no means sorry to see a foe of about their own strength  in hot pursuit of them. A quarter of an hour after the shattered  boat had dropped astern the moon rose on the starboard bow. It was  three-quarters full, and would assuredly reveal the ship to those  on shore. Scarcely indeed did it show above the horizon when there  was the boom of a gun astern, followed a second or two later by a  heavy splash in the water close alongside.    \"That was a good shot,\" Captain Martin said; \"but luck rather than  skill I fancy. There is little chance of their hitting us at this  distance. We must be a mile and a half away; don't you think so,  Peters?\"    \"Quite that, captain; and they must have given their gun a lot of  elevation to carry so far. I almost wonder they wasted their powder.\"    \"Of course they can't tell in the least who they are firing at,\"  the captain said. \"They cannot have learnt anything yet, and can  have only known that there was firing off the port, and that a  craft is making out. We may be one of the sea beggars' vessels for  anything they know, and may have come in to carry off a prize from  under their very noses.\"    \"That is so,\" the mate replied; \"but the gun may have been fired  as a signal as much as with any hope of hitting us.\"    \"So it may, so it may, Peters; I did not think of that. Certainly  that is likely enough. We know they have several ships cruising in  the Zuider Zee keeping a lookout for the beggars. On a night like  this, and with the wind astern, the sound will be heard miles away.  We may have trouble yet. I was not much afraid of the galleys, for  though the wind is so light we are running along famously. You see  we have nothing in our hold, and that is all in our favour so long  as we are dead before the wind. Besides, if the galleys did come  up it would probably be singly, and we should be able to beat them  off, for high out of water as we are they would find it difficult  to climb the sides; but if we fall in with any of their ships it  is a different matter altogether.\"    Four or five more shots were fired, but they all fell astern; and  as they were fully two miles and a half away when the last"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6955"],[0,"The Prince and Betty (#9)"],[1,"prince want to marry a girl he has never seen?\"    \"He will,\" said Mr. Scobell confidently.    \"How do you know?\"    \"Because I know he's a sensible young skeesicks. That's how. See here,  Betty, you've gotten hold of wrong ideas about this place. You don't  understand the position of affairs. Your aunt didn't till I put her  wise.\"    \"He bit my head off, my dear,\" murmured Miss Scobell, knitting  placidly.    \"You're thinking that Mervo is an ordinary state, and that the Prince  is one of those independent, all-wool, off-with-his-darned-head rulers  like you read about in the best sellers. Well, you've got another guess  coming. If you want to know who's the big noise here, it's me--me! This  Prince guy is my hired man. See? Who sent for him? I did. Who put him  on the throne? I did. Who pays him his salary? I do, from the profits  of the Casino. Now do you understand? He knows his job. He knows which  side his bread's buttered. When I tell him about this marriage, do you  know what he'll say? He'll say 'Thank you, sir!' That's how things are  in this island.\"    Betty shuddered. Her face was white with humiliation. She half-raised  her hands with an impulsive movement to hide it.    \"I won't. I won't. I won't!\" she gasped.    Mr. Scobell was pacing the room in an ecstasy of triumphant rhetoric.    \"There's another thing,\" he said, swinging round suddenly and causing  his sister to drop another stitch. \"Maybe you think he's some kind of a  Dago, this guy? Maybe that's what's biting you. Let me tell you that  he's an American--pretty near as much an American as you are yourself.\"    Betty stared at him.    \"An American!\"    \"Don't believe it, eh? Well, let me tell you that his mother was born  and raised in Jersey, and that he has lived all his life in the States.  He's no little runt of a Dago. No, sir. He's a Harvard man, six-foot  high and weighs two hundred pounds. That's the sort of man he is. I  guess that's not American enough for you, maybe? No?\"    \"You do shout so, Bennie!\" murmured Miss Scobell. \"I'm sure there's no  need.\"    Betty uttered a cry. Something had told her who he was, this Harvard  man who had sold himself. That species of sixth sense which lies  undeveloped at the back of our minds during the ordinary happenings of  life wakes sometimes in moments of keen emotion. At its highest, it is  prophecy; at its lowest, a vague presentiment. It woke in Betty now.  There was no particular reason why she should have connected her  stepfather's words with John. The term he had used was an elastic one.  Among the visitors to the island there were probably several Harvard  men. But somehow she knew.    \"Who is he?\" she cried. \"What was his name before he--when he--?\"    \"His name?\" said Mr. Scobell. \"John Maude. Maude was his mother's name.  She was a Miss Westley. Here, where are you going?\"    Betty was walking slowly toward the door. Something in her face checked  Mr. Scobell.    \"I want to think,\" she said quietly. \"I'm going out.\"           *       *       *       *       *    In days of old, in the age of legend, omens warned heroes of impending  doom. But to-day the gods have grown weary, and we rush unsuspecting on  our fate. No owl hooted, no thunder rolled from the blue sky as John  went up the path to meet the white dress that gleamed between the  trees.    His heart was singing within him. She had come. She had not forgotten,  or changed her mind, or willfully abandoned him. His mood lightened  swiftly. Humility vanished. He was not such an outcast, after all. He  was someone. He was the man Betty Silver had come to meet.    But with the sight of her face came reaction.    Her face was pale and cold and hard. She did not speak or smile. As she  drew near she looked at him, and there was that in her look which set a  chill wind blowing through the world and cast a veil across the sun.    And in this bleak world they stood silent and motionless while eons  rolled by.    Betty was the first to speak.    \"I'm late,\" she said.    John searched in his brain for words, and came empty away. He shook his  head dumbly.    \"Shall we sit down?\" said Betty.    John indicated silently the sandstone rock on which he had been  communing with himself.    They sat down. A sense of being preposterously and indecently big  obsessed John. There seemed no end to him. Wherever he looked, there  were hands and feet and legs. He was a vast blot on the face of the  earth. He glanced out of the corner of his eye at Betty. She was gazing  out to sea.    He dived into his brain again. It was absurd! There must be something  to say.    And then he realized that a worse thing had befallen. He had no voice.  It had gone. He knew that, try he never so hard to speak, he would not  be able to utter a word. A nightmare feeling of unreality came upon  him. Had he ever spoken? Had he ever done anything but sit dumbly on  that rock, looking at those sea gulls out in the water?    He shot another swift glance at Betty, and a thrill went through him.  There were tears in her eyes.    The next moment--the action was almost automatic--his left hand was  clasping her right, and he was moving along the rock to her side.    She snatched her hand away.    His brain, ransacked for the third time, yielded a single word.    \"Betty!\"    She got up quickly.    In the confused state of his mind, John found it necessary if he were  to speak at all, to say the essential thing in the shortest possible  way. Polished periods are not for the man who is feeling deeply.    He blurted out, huskily, \"I love you!\" and finding that this was all  that he could say, was silent.    Even to himself the words, as he spoke them, sounded bald and  meaningless. To Betty, shaken by her encounter with Mr. Scobell, they  sounded artificial, as if he were forcing himself to repeat a lesson.  They jarred upon her.    \"Don't!\" she said sharply. \"Oh, don't!\"    Her voice stabbed him. It could not have stirred him more if she had  uttered a cry of physical pain.    \"Don't! I know. I've been told.\"    \"Been told?\"    She went on quickly.    \"I know all about it. My stepfather has just told me. He said--he said  you were his--\" she choked--\"his hired man; that he paid you to stay  here and advertise the Casino. Oh, it's too horrible! That it should be  you! You, who have been--you can't understand what you--have been to  me--ever since we met; you couldn't understand. I can't tell you--a  sort of help--something--something that--I can't put it into words.  Only it used to help me just to think of you. It was almost impersonal.  I didn't mind if I never saw you again. I didn't expect ever to see you  again. It was just being able to think of you. It helped--you were  something I could trust. Something strong--solid.\" She laughed  bitterly. \"I suppose I made a hero of you. Girls are fools. But it  helped me to feel that there was one man alive who--who put his honor  above money--\"    She broke off. John stood motionless, staring at the ground. For the  first time in his easy-going life he knew shame. Even now he had not  grasped to the full the purport of her words. The scales were falling  from his eyes, but as yet he saw but dimly.    She began to speak again, in a low, monotonous voice, almost as if she  were talking to herself. She was looking past him, at the gulls that  swooped and skimmed above the glittering water.    \"I'm so tired of money--money--money. Everything's money. Isn't there a  man in the world who won't sell himself? I thought that you--I suppose  I'm stupid. It's business, I suppose. One expects too much.\"    She looked at him wearily.    \"Good-by,\" she said. \"I'm going.\"    He did not move.    She turned, and went slowly up the path. Still he made no movement. A  spell seemed to be on him. His eyes never left her as she passed into  the shadow of the trees. For a moment her white dress stood out  clearly. She had stopped. With his whole soul he prayed that she would  look back. But she moved on once more, and was gone. And suddenly a  strange weakness came upon John. He trembled. The hillside flickered  before his eyes for an instant, and he clutched at the sandstone rock  to steady himself.    Then his brain cleared, and he found himself thinking swiftly. He could  not let her go like this. He must overtake her. He must stop her. He  must speak to her. He must say--he did not know what it was that he  would say--anything, so that he spoke to her again.    He raced up the path, calling her name. No answer came to his cries.  Above him lay the hillside, dozing in the noonday sun; below, the  Mediterranean, sleek and blue, without a ripple. He stood alone in a  land of silence and sleep.          CHAPTER VIII    AN ULTIMATUM FROM THE THRONE      At half-past twelve that morning business took Mr. Benjamin Scobell to  the royal Palace. He was not a man who believed in letting the grass  grow under his feet. He prided himself on his briskness of attack.  Every now and then Mr. Crump, searching the newspapers, would discover  and hand to him a paragraph alluding to his \"hustling methods.\" When  this happened, he would preserve the clipping and carry it about in his  vest-pocket with his cigars till time and friction wore it away. He  liked to think of himself as swift and sudden--the Human Thunderbolt.    In this matter of the royal alliance, it was his intention to have at  it and clear it up at once. Having put his views clearly before Betty,  he now proposed to lay them with equal clarity before the Prince. There  was no sense in putting the thing off. The sooner all parties concerned  understood the position of affairs, the sooner the business would be  settled.    That Betty had not received his information with joy did not distress  him. He had a poor opinion of the feminine intelligence. Girls got their  minds full of nonsense from reading novels and seeing plays--like Betty.  Betty objected to those who were wiser than herself"]]]
