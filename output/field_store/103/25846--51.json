But  after the world became a little acquainted with that notable history, the  man that was seen in that once celebrated drapery was pointed at as a Don  Quixote, and found himself the jest of high and low. And I verily believe  that to this, and this only, we owe that dampness and poverty of spirit  which has run through all our councils for a century past, so little  agreeable to those nobler actions of our famous ancestors.\"    To call \"Don Quixote\" a sad book, preaching a pessimist view of life,  argues a total misconception of its drift. It would be so if its moral  were that, in this world, true enthusiasm naturally leads to ridicule and  discomfiture. But it preaches nothing of the sort; its moral, so far as  it can be said to have one, is that the spurious enthusiasm that is born  of vanity and self-conceit, that is made an end in itself, not a means to  an end, that acts on mere impulse, regardless of circumstances and  consequences, is mischievous to its owner, and a very considerable  nuisance to the community at large. To those who cannot distinguish  between the one kind and the other, no doubt \"Don Quixote\" is a sad book;  no doubt to some minds it is very sad that a man who had just uttered so  beautiful a sentiment as that \"it is a hard case to make slaves of those  whom God and Nature made free,\" should be ungratefully pelted by the  scoundrels his crazy philanthropy had let loose on society; but to others  of a more judicial cast it will be a matter of regret that reckless  self-sufficient enthusiasm is not oftener requited in some such way for  all the mischief it does in the world.    A very slight examination of the structure of \"Don Quixote\" will suffice  to show that Cervantes had no deep design or elaborate plan in his mind  when he began the book. When he wrote those lines in which \"with a few  strokes of a great master he sets before us the pauper gentleman,\" he had  no idea of the goal to which his imagination was leading him. There can  be little doubt that all he contemplated was a short tale to range with  those he had already written, a tale setting forth the ludicrous results  that might be expected to follow the attempt of a crazy gentleman to act  the part of a knight-errant in modern life.    It is plain, for one thing, that Sancho Panza did not enter into the  original scheme, for had Cervantes thought of him he certainly would not  have omitted him in his hero's outfit, which he obviously meant to be  complete. Him we owe to the landlord's chance remark in Chapter III that  knights seldom travelled without squires. To try to think of a Don  Quixote without Sancho Panza is like trying to think of a one-bladed pair  of scissors.    The story was written at first, like the others, without any division and  without the intervention of Cide Hamete Benengeli; and it seems not  unlikely that Cervantes had some intention of bringing Dulcinea, or  Aldonza Lorenzo, on the scene in person. It was probably the ransacking  of the Don's library and the discussion on the books of chivalry that  first suggested it to him that his idea was capable of development. What,  if instead of a mere string of farcical misadventures, he were to make  his tale a burlesque of one of these books, caricaturing their style,  incidents, and spirit?    In pursuance of this change of plan, he hastily and somewhat clumsily  divided what he had written into chapters on the model of \"Amadis,\"  invented the fable of a mysterious Arabic manuscript, and set up Cide  Hamete Benengeli in imitation of the almost invariable practice of the  chivalry-romance authors, who were fond of tracing their books to some  recondite source. In working out the new ideas, he soon found the value  of Sancho Panza. Indeed, the keynote, not only to Sancho's part, but to  the whole book, is struck in the first words Sancho utters when he  announces his intention of taking his ass with him. \"About the ass,\" we  are told, \"Don Quixote hesitated a little, trying whether he could call  to mind any knight-errant taking with him an esquire mounted on ass-back;  but no instance occurred to his memory.\" We can see the whole scene at a  glance, the stolid unconsciousness of Sancho and the perplexity of his  master, upon whose perception the incongruity has just forced itself.  This is Sancho's mission throughout the book; he is an unconscious  Mephistopheles, always unwittingly making mockery of his master's  aspirations, always exposing the fallacy of his ideas by some  unintentional ad absurdum, always bringing him back to the world of fact  and commonplace by force of sheer stolidity.    By the time Cervantes had got his volume of novels off his hands, and  summoned up resolution enough to set about the Second Part in earnest,  the case was very much altered. Don Quixote and Sancho Panza had not  merely found favour, but had already become, what they have never since  ceased to be, veritable entities to the popular imagination. There was no  occasion for him now to interpolate extraneous matter; nay, his readers  told him plainly that what they wanted of him was more Don Quixote and  more Sancho Panza, and not novels, tales, or digressions. To himself,  too, his creations had become realities, and he had become proud of them,  especially of Sancho. He began the Second Part, therefore, under very  different conditions, and the difference makes itself manifest at once.  Even in translation the style will be seen to be far easier, more  flowing, more natural, and more like that of a man sure of himself and of  his audience. Don Quixote and Sancho undergo a change also. In the First  Part, Don Quixote has no character or individuality whatever. He is  nothing more than a crazy representative of the sentiments of the  chivalry romances. In all that he says and does he is simply repeating  the lesson he has learned from his books; and therefore, it is absurd to  speak of him in the gushing strain of the sentimental critics when they  dilate upon his nobleness, disinterestedness, dauntless courage, and so  forth. It was the business of a knight-errant to right wrongs, redress  injuries, and succour the distressed, and this, as a matter of course, he  makes his business when he takes up the part; a knight-errant was bound  to be intrepid, and so he feels bound to cast fear aside. Of all Byron's  melodious nonsense about Don Quixote, the most nonsensical statement is  that \"'t is his virtue makes him mad!\" The exact opposite is the truth;  it is his madness makes him virtuous.    In the Second Part, Cervantes repeatedly reminds the reader, as if it was  a point upon which he was anxious there should be no mistake, that his  hero's madness is strictly confined to delusions on the subject of  chivalry, and that on every other subject he is discreto, one, in fact,  whose faculty of discernment is in perfect order. The advantage of this  is that he is enabled to make use of Don Quixote as a mouthpiece for his  own reflections, and so, without seeming to digress, allow himself the  relief of digression when he requires it, as freely as in a commonplace  book.    It is true the amount of individuality bestowed upon Don Quixote is not  very great. There are some natural touches of character about him, such  as his mixture of irascibility and placability, and his curious affection  for Sancho together with his impatience of the squire's loquacity and  impertinence; but in the main, apart from his craze, he is little more  than a thoughtful, cultured gentleman, with instinctive good taste and a  great deal of shrewdness and originality of mind.    As to Sancho, it is plain, from the concluding words of the preface to  the First Part, that he was a favourite with his creator even before he  had been taken into favour by the public. An inferior genius, taking him  in hand a second time, would very likely have tried to improve him by  making him more comical, clever, amiable, or virtuous. But Cervantes was  too true an artist to spoil his work in this way. Sancho, when he  reappears, is the old Sancho with the old familiar features; but with a  difference; they have been brought out more distinctly, but at the same  time with a careful avoidance of anything like caricature; the outline  has been filled in where filling in was necessary, and, vivified by a few  touches of a master's hand, Sancho stands before us as he might in a  character portrait by Velazquez. He is a much more important and  prominent figure in the Second Part than in the First; indeed, it is his  matchless mendacity about Dulcinea that to a great extent supplies the  action of the story.    His development in this respect is as remarkable as in any other. In the  First Part he displays a great natural gift of lying. His lies are not of  the highly imaginative sort that liars in fiction commonly indulge in;  like Falstaff's, they resemble the father that begets them; they are  simple, homely, plump lies; plain working lies, in short. But in the  service of such a master as Don Quixote he develops rapidly, as we see  when he comes to palm off the three country wenches as Dulcinea and her  ladies in waiting. It is worth noticing how, flushed by his success in  this instance, he is tempted afterwards to try a flight beyond his powers  in his account of the journey on Clavileno.    In the Second Part it is the spirit rather than the incidents of the  chivalry romances that is the subject of the burlesque. Enchantments of  the sort travestied in those of Dulcinea and the Trifaldi and the cave of  Montesinos play a leading part in the later and inferior romances, and  another distinguishing feature is caricatured in Don Quixote's blind  adoration of Dulcinea. In the romances of chivalry love is either a mere  animalism or a fantastic idolatry. Only a coarse-minded man would care to  make merry with the former, but to one of Cervantes' humour the latter  was naturally an attractive"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5946"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 2, Complete (#9)"],[1,"I  can tell Senor Carrasco that my master would not throw the kingdom he  might give me into a sack all in holes; for I have felt my own pulse and  I find myself sound enough to rule kingdoms and govern islands; and I  have before now told my master as much.\"    \"Take care, Sancho,\" said Samson; \"honours change manners, and perhaps  when you find yourself a governor you won't know the mother that bore  you.\"    \"That may hold good of those that are born in the ditches,\" said Sancho,  \"not of those who have the fat of an old Christian four fingers deep on  their souls, as I have. Nay, only look at my disposition, is that likely  to show ingratitude to anyone?\"    \"God grant it,\" said Don Quixote; \"we shall see when the government  comes; and I seem to see it already.\"    He then begged the bachelor, if he were a poet, to do him the favour of  composing some verses for him conveying the farewell he meant to take of  his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, and to see that a letter of her name was  placed at the beginning of each line, so that, at the end of the verses,  \"Dulcinea del Toboso\" might be read by putting together the first  letters. The bachelor replied that although he was not one of the famous  poets of Spain, who were, they said, only three and a half, he would not  fail to compose the required verses; though he saw a great difficulty in  the task, as the letters which made up the name were seventeen; so, if he  made four ballad stanzas of four lines each, there would be a letter  over, and if he made them of five, what they called decimas or  redondillas, there were three letters short; nevertheless he would try to  drop a letter as well as he could, so that the name \"Dulcinea del Toboso\"  might be got into four ballad stanzas.    \"It must be, by some means or other,\" said Don Quixote, \"for unless the  name stands there plain and manifest, no woman would believe the verses  were made for her.\"    They agreed upon this, and that the departure should take place in three  days from that time. Don Quixote charged the bachelor to keep it a  secret, especially from the curate and Master Nicholas, and from his  niece and the housekeeper, lest they should prevent the execution of his  praiseworthy and valiant purpose. Carrasco promised all, and then took  his leave, charging Don Quixote to inform him of his good or evil  fortunes whenever he had an opportunity; and thus they bade each other  farewell, and Sancho went away to make the necessary preparations for  their expedition.          CHAPTER V.    OF THE SHREWD AND DROLL CONVERSATION THAT PASSED BETWEEN SANCHO PANZA AND  HIS WIFE TERESA PANZA, AND OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF BEING DULY RECORDED      The translator of this history, when he comes to write this fifth  chapter, says that he considers it apocryphal, because in it Sancho Panza  speaks in a style unlike that which might have been expected from his  limited intelligence, and says things so subtle that he does not think it  possible he could have conceived them; however, desirous of doing what  his task imposed upon him, he was unwilling to leave it untranslated, and  therefore he went on to say:    Sancho came home in such glee and spirits that his wife noticed his  happiness a bowshot off, so much so that it made her ask him, \"What have  you got, Sancho friend, that you are so glad?\"    To which he replied, \"Wife, if it were God's will, I should be very glad  not to be so well pleased as I show myself.\"    \"I don't understand you, husband,\" said she, \"and I don't know what you  mean by saying you would be glad, if it were God's will, not to be well  pleased; for, fool as I am, I don't know how one can find pleasure in not  having it.\"    \"Hark ye, Teresa,\" replied Sancho, \"I am glad because I have made up my  mind to go back to the service of my master Don Quixote, who means to go  out a third time to seek for adventures; and I am going with him again,  for my necessities will have it so, and also the hope that cheers me with  the thought that I may find another hundred crowns like those we have  spent; though it makes me sad to have to leave thee and the children; and  if God would be pleased to let me have my daily bread, dry-shod and at  home, without taking me out into the byways and cross-roads--and he could  do it at small cost by merely willing it--it is clear my happiness would  be more solid and lasting, for the happiness I have is mingled with  sorrow at leaving thee; so that I was right in saying I would be glad, if  it were God's will, not to be well pleased.\"    \"Look here, Sancho,\" said Teresa; \"ever since you joined on to a  knight-errant you talk in such a roundabout way that there is no  understanding you.\"    \"It is enough that God understands me, wife,\" replied Sancho; \"for he is  the understander of all things; that will do; but mind, sister, you must  look to Dapple carefully for the next three days, so that he may be fit  to take arms; double his feed, and see to the pack-saddle and other  harness, for it is not to a wedding we are bound, but to go round the  world, and play at give and take with giants and dragons and monsters,  and hear hissings and roarings and bellowings and howlings; and even all  this would be lavender, if we had not to reckon with Yanguesans and  enchanted Moors.\"    \"I know well enough, husband,\" said Teresa, \"that squires-errant don't  eat their bread for nothing, and so I will be always praying to our Lord  to deliver you speedily from all that hard fortune.\"    \"I can tell you, wife,\" said Sancho, \"if I did not expect to see myself  governor of an island before long, I would drop down dead on the spot.\"    \"Nay, then, husband,\" said Teresa; \"let the hen live, though it be with  her pip, live, and let the devil take all the governments in the world;  you came out of your mother's womb without a government, you have lived  until now without a government, and when it is God's will you will go, or  be carried, to your grave without a government. How many there are in the  world who live without a government, and continue to live all the same,  and are reckoned in the number of the people. The best sauce in the world  is hunger, and as the poor are never without that, they always eat with a  relish. But mind, Sancho, if by good luck you should find yourself with  some government, don't forget me and your children. Remember that  Sanchico is now full fifteen, and it is right he should go to school, if  his uncle the abbot has a mind to have him trained for the Church.  Consider, too, that your daughter Mari-Sancha will not die of grief if we  marry her; for I have my suspicions that she is as eager to get a husband  as you to get a government; and, after all, a daughter looks better ill  married than well whored.\"    \"By my faith,\" replied Sancho, \"if God brings me to get any sort of a  government, I intend, wife, to make such a high match for Mari-Sancha  that there will be no approaching her without calling her 'my lady.\"    \"Nay, Sancho,\" returned Teresa; \"marry her to her equal, that is the  safest plan; for if you put her out of wooden clogs into high-heeled  shoes, out of her grey flannel petticoat into hoops and silk gowns, out  of the plain 'Marica' and 'thou,' into 'Dona So-and-so' and 'my lady,'  the girl won't know where she is, and at every turn she will fall into a  thousand blunders that will show the thread of her coarse homespun  stuff.\"    \"Tut, you fool,\" said Sancho; \"it will be only to practise it for two or  three years; and then dignity and decorum will fit her as easily as a  glove; and if not, what matter? Let her be 'my lady,' and never mind what  happens.\"    \"Keep to your own station, Sancho,\" replied Teresa; \"don't try to raise  yourself higher, and bear in mind the proverb that says, 'wipe the nose  of your neigbbour's son, and take him into your house.' A fine thing it  would be, indeed, to marry our Maria to some great count or grand  gentleman, who, when the humour took him, would abuse her and call her  clown-bred and clodhopper's daughter and spinning wench. I have not been  bringing up my daughter for that all this time, I can tell you, husband.  Do you bring home money, Sancho, and leave marrying her to my care; there  is Lope Tocho, Juan Tocho's son, a stout, sturdy young fellow that we  know, and I can see he does not look sour at the girl; and with him, one  of our own sort, she will be well married, and we shall have her always  under our eyes, and be all one family, parents and children,  grandchildren and sons-in-law, and the peace and blessing of God will  dwell among us; so don't you go marrying her in those courts and grand  palaces where they won't know what to make of her, or she what to make of  herself.\"    \"Why, you idiot and wife for Barabbas,\" said Sancho, \"what do you mean by  trying, without why or wherefore, to keep me from marrying my daughter to  one who will give me grandchildren that will be called 'your lordship'?  Look ye, Teresa, I have always heard my elders say that he who does not  know how to take advantage of luck when it comes to him, has no right to  complain if it gives him the go-by; and now that it is knocking at our  door, it will not do to shut it out; let us go with the favouring breeze  that blows upon us.\"    It is this sort of talk, and what Sancho says lower down, that made the  translator of the history say he considered this chapter apocryphal.    \"Don't you see, you animal,\" continued Sancho, \"that it will be well for  me to drop into some profitable government that will lift us out of the  mire, and marry Mari-Sancha to whom I like; and you yourself will find  yourself called 'Dona Teresa Panza,' and sitting in church on a fine  carpet and cushions and draperies, in spite and in defiance of all the  born ladies of the town? No, stay as you are, growing neither greater nor  less, like a tapestry figure--Let us say no more about it, for Sanchica  shall be a countess, say what"]]]
