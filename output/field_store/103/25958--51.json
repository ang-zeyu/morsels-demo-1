In Sparta,  thought, in this respect as in all others, was expressed in the  characters of real life, and the women of Sparta were as much Spartans  as the men. The \"citoyen, citoyenne\" of France was here actualized.  Was not the calm equality they enjoyed as honorable as the devotion of  chivalry? They intelligently shared the ideal life of their nation.    Like the men they felt:        \"Honor gone, all's gone:    Better never have been born.\"      They were the true friends of men. The Spartan, surely, would not  think that he received only his body from his mother. The sage, had he  lived in that community, could not have thought the souls of \"vain and  foppish men will be degraded after death to the forms of women; and,  if they do not then make great efforts to retrieve themselves, will  become birds.\"    (By the way, it is very expressive of the hard intellectuality of the  merely _mannish_ mind, to speak thus of birds, chosen always by  the _feminine_ poet as the symbols of his fairest thoughts.)    We are told of the Greek nations in general, that Woman occupied there  an infinitely lower place than Man. It is difficult to believe this,  when we see such range and dignity of thought on the subject in the  mythologies, and find the poets producing such ideals as Cassandra,  Iphigenia, Antigone, Macaria; where Sibylline priestesses told the  oracle of the highest god, and he could not be content to reign with  a, court of fewer than nine muses. Even Victory wore a female form.    But, whatever were the facts of daily life, I cannot complain of the  age and nation which represents its thought by such a symbol as I see  before me at this moment. It is a zodiac of the busts of gods and  goddesses, arranged in pairs. The circle breathes the music of a  heavenly order. Male and female heads are distinct in expression, but  equal in beauty, strength and calmness. Each male head is that of a  brother and a king,--each female of a sister and a queen. Could the  thought thus expressed be lived out, there would be nothing more to be  desired. There would be unison in variety, congeniality in difference.    Coming nearer our own time, we find religion and poetry no less true  in their revelations. The rude man, just disengaged from the sod, the  Adam, accuses Woman to his God, and records her disgrace to their  posterity. He is not ashamed to write that he could be drawn from  heaven by one beneath him,--one made, he says, from but a small part  of himself. But in the same nation, educated by time, instructed by a  succession of prophets, we find Woman in as high a position as she has  ever occupied, No figure that has ever arisen to greet our eyes has  been received with more fervent reverence than that of the Madonna.  Heine calls her the _Dame du Comptoir_ of the Catholic church,  and this jeer well expresses a serious truth.    And not only this holy and significant image was worshipped by the  pilgrim, and the favorite subject of the artist, but it exercised an  immediate influence on the destiny of the sex. The empresses who  embraced the cross converted sons and husbands. Whole calendars of  female saints, heroic dames of chivalry, binding the emblem of faith  on the heart of the best-beloved, and wasting the bloom of youth in  separation and loneliness, for the sake of duties they thought it  religion to assume, with innumerable forms of poesy, trace their  lineage to this one. Nor, however imperfect may be the action, in our  day, of the faith thus expressed, and though we can scarcely think it  nearer this ideal than that of India or Greece was near their ideal,  is it in vain that the truth has been recognized, that Woman is not  only a part of Man, bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, born  that men might not be lonely--but that women are in themselves  possessors of and possessed by immortal souls. This truth undoubtedly  received a greater outward stability from the belief of the church  that the earthly parent of the Saviour of souls was a woman.    The Assumption of the Virgin, as painted by sublime artists, as also  Petrarch's Hymn to the Madonna, [Footnote: Appendix B.] cannot have  spoken to the world wholly without result, yet oftentimes those who  had ears heard not.    See upon the nations the influence of this powerful example. In Spain  look only at the ballads. Woman in these is \"very Woman;\" she is the  betrothed, the bride, the spouse of Man; there is on her no hue of the  philosopher, the heroine, the savante, but she looks great and noble.  Why? Because she is also, through her deep devotion, the betrothed of  Heaven. Her upturned eyes have drawn down the light that casts a  radiance round her. See only such a ballad as that of \"Lady Teresa's  Bridal,\" where the Infanta, given to the Moorish bridegroom, calls  down the vengeance of Heaven on his unhallowed passion, and thinks it  not too much to expiate by a life in the cloister the involuntary  stain upon her princely youth. [Footnote: Appendix C.] It was this  constant sense of claims above those of earthly love or happiness that  made the Spanish lady who shared this spirit a guerdon to be won by  toils and blood and constant purity, rather than a chattel to be  bought for pleasure and service.    Germany did hot need to _learn_ a high view of Woman; it was  inborn in that race. Woman was to the Teuton warrior his priestess,  his friend, his sister,--in truth, a wife. And the Christian statues  of noble pairs, as they lie above their graves in stone, expressing  the meaning of all the by-gone pilgrimage by hands folded in mutual  prayer, yield not a nobler sense of the place and powers of Woman than  belonged to the _altvater_ day. The holy love of Christ which  summoned them, also, to choose \"the better part--that which could not  be taken from them,\" refined and hallowed in this nation a native  faith; thus showing that it was not the warlike spirit alone that left  the Latins so barbarous in this respect.    But the Germans, taking so kindly to this thought, did it the more  justice. The idea of Woman in their literature is expressed both to a  greater height and depth than elsewhere.    I will give as instances the themes of three ballads:    One is upon a knight who had always the name of the Virgin on his  lips. This protected him all his life through, in various and  beautiful modes, both from sin and other dangers; and, when he died, a  plant sprang from his grave, which so gently whispered the Ave Maria  that none could pass it by with an unpurified heart.    Another is one of the legends of the famous Drachenfels. A maiden, one  of the earliest converts to Christianity, was carried by the enraged  populace to this dread haunt of \"the dragon's fabled brood,\" to be  their prey. She was left alone, but undismayed, for she knew in whom  she trusted. So, when the dragons came rushing towards her, she showed  them a crucifix and they crouched reverently at her feet. Next day the  people came, and, seeing these wonders, were all turned to the faith  which exalts the lowly.    The third I have in mind is another of the Rhine legends. A youth is  sitting with the maid he loves on the shore of an isle, her fairy  kingdom, then perfumed by the blossoming grape-vines which draped its  bowers. They are happy; all blossoms with them, and life promises its  richest vine. A boat approaches on the tide; it pauses at their foot.  It brings, perhaps, some joyous message, fresh dew for their flowers,  fresh light on the wave. No! it is the usual check on such great  happiness. The father of the count departs for the crusade; will his  son join him, or remain to rule their domain, and wed her he loves?  Neither of the affianced pair hesitates a moment. \"I must go with my  father,\"--\"Thou must go with thy father.\" It was one thought, one  word. \"I will be here again,\" he said, \"when these blossoms have  turned to purple grapes.\" \"I hope so,\" she sighed, while the prophetic  sense said \"no.\"    And there she waited, and the grapes ripened, and were gathered into  the vintage, and he came not. Year after year passed thus, and no  tidings; yet still she waited.    He, meanwhile, was in a Moslem prison. Long he languished there  without hope, till, at last, his patron saint appeared in vision and  announced his release, but only on condition of his joining the  monastic order for the service of the saint.    And so his release was effected, and a safe voyage home given. And  once more he sets sail upon the Rhine. The maiden, still watching  beneath the vines, sees at last the object of all this patient love  approach--approach, but not to touch the strand to which she, with  outstretched arms, has rushed. He dares not trust himself to land, but  in low, heart-broken tones, tells her of Heaven's will; and that he,  in obedience to his vow, is now on his way to a convent on the  river-bank, there to pass the rest of his earthly life in the service  of the shrine. And then he turns his boat, and floats away from her  and hope of any happiness in this world, but urged, as he believes, by  the breath of Heaven.    The maiden stands appalled, but she dares not murmur, and cannot  hesitate long. She also bids them"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8649"],[0,"Indian Tales (#9)"],[1," we fair blew them off their feet, for we had  expinded very little ammunition by reason av the knife work.\"    \"Hi used thirty rounds goin' down that valley,\" said Ortheris, \"an' it was  gentleman's work. Might 'a' done it in a white 'andkerchief an' pink silk  stockin's, that part. Hi was on in that piece.\"    \"You could ha' heard the Tyrone yellin' a mile away,\" said Mulvaney, \"an'  'twas all their Sargints cud do to get thim off. They was mad--mad--mad!  Crook sits down in the quiet that fell whin we had gone down the valley,  an' covers his face wid his hands. Prisintly we all came back again  accordin' to our natures and disposishins, for they, mark you, show  through the hide av a man in that hour.    \"'Bhoys! bhoys!' sez Crook to himself. 'I misdoubt we could ha' engaged at  long range an' saved betther men than me.' He looked at our dead an' said  no more.    \"'Captain dear,' sez a man av the Tyrone, comin' up wid his mouth bigger  than iver his mother kissed ut, spittin' blood like a whale; 'Captain  dear,' sez he, 'if wan or two in the shtalls have been discommoded, the  gallery have enjoyed the performinces av a Roshus.'    \"Thin I knew that man for the Dublin dockrat he was--wan av the bhoys that  made the lessee av Silver's Theatre grey before his time wid tearin' out  the bowils av the benches an' t'rowin' thim into the pit. So I passed the  wurrud that I knew when I was in the Tyrone an' we lay in Dublin. 'I don't  know who 'twas,' I whispers, 'an' I don't care, but anyways I'll knock the  face av you, Tim Kelly.'    \"'Eyah!' sez the man, 'was you there too? We'll call ut Silver's Theatre.'  Half the Tyrone, knowin' the ould place, tuk ut up: so we called ut  Silver's Theatre.    \"The little orf'cer bhoy av the Tyrone was thremblin' an' cryin', He had  no heart for the Coort-martials that he talked so big upon. 'Ye'll do well  later,' sez Crook, very quiet, 'for not bein' allowed to kill yourself for  amusemint.'    \"'I'm a dishgraced man!' sez the little orf'cer bhoy.    \"Put me undher arrest, sorr, if you will, but by my sowl, I'd do ut again  sooner than face your mother wid you dead,' sez the Sargint that had sat  on his head, standin' to attention an' salutin'. But the young wan only  cried as tho' his little heart was breakin'.    \"Thin another man av the Tyrone came up, wid the fog av fightin' on him.\"    \"The what, Mulvaney?\"    \"Fog av fightin'. You know, sorr, that, like makin' love, ut takes each  man diff'rint. Now I can't help bein' powerful sick whin I'm in action.  Orth'ris, here, niver stops swearin' from ind to ind, an' the only time  that Learoyd opins his mouth to sing is whin he is messin' wid other  people's heads; for he's a dhirty fighter is Jock. Recruities sometime  cry, an' sometime they don't know fwhat they do, an' sometime they are all  for cuttin' throats an' such like dirtiness; but some men get  heavy-dead-dhrunk on the fightin'. This man was. He was staggerin', an'  his eyes were half shut, an' we cud hear him dhraw breath twinty yards  away. He sees the little orf'cer bhoy, an' comes up, talkin' thick an'  drowsy to himsilf. 'Blood the young whelp!' he sez; 'blood the young  whelp;' an' wid that he threw up his arms, shpun roun', an' dropped at our  feet, dead as a Paythan, an' there was niver sign or scratch on him. They  said 'twas his heart was rotten, but oh, 'twas a quare thing to see!    \"Thin we wint to bury our dead, for we wud not lave thim to the Paythans,  an' in movin' among the haythen we nearly lost that little orf'cer bhoy.  He was for givin' wan divil wather and layin' him aisy against a rock. 'Be  careful, sorr,' sez I; 'a wounded Paythan's worse than a live wan.' My  troth, before the words was out of my mouth, the man on the ground fires  at the orf'cer bhoy lanin' over him, an' I saw the helmit fly. I dropped  the butt on the face av the man an' tuk his pistol. The little orf'cer  bhoy turned very white, for the hair av half his head was singed away.    \"'I tould you so, sorr!' sez I; an', afther that, whin he wanted to help a  Paythan I stud wid the muzzle contagious to the ear. They dare not do  anythin' but curse. The Tyrone was growlin' like dogs over a bone that had  been taken away too soon, for they had seen their dead an' they wanted to  kill ivry sowl on the ground. Crook tould thim that he'd blow the hide off  any man that misconducted himself; but, seeing that ut was the first time  the Tyrone had iver seen their dead, I do not wondher they were on the  sharp. 'Tis a shameful sight! Whin I first saw ut I wud niver ha' given  quarter to any man north of the Khaibar--no, nor woman either, for the  women used to come out afther dhark--Auggrh!    \"Well, evenshually we buried our dead an' tuk away our wounded, an' come  over the brow av the hills to see the Scotchies an' the Gurkys taking tay  with the Paythans in bucketsfuls. We were a gang av dissolute ruffians,  for the blood had caked the dust, an' the sweat had cut the cake, an' our  bay'nits was hangin' like butchers' steels betune ur legs, an' most av us  were marked one way or another.    \"A Staff Orf'cer man, clean as a new rifle, rides up an' sez: 'What damned  scarecrows are you?'    \"'A comp'ny av Her Majesty's Black Tyrone an' wan av the Ould Rig'mint,'  sez Crook very quiet, givin' our visitors the flure as 'twas.    \"'Oh!' sez the Staff Orf'cer; 'did you dislodge that Reserve?'    \"'No!' sez Crook, an' the Tyrone laughed.    \"'Thin fwhat the divil have ye done?'    \"'Disthroyed ut,' sez Crook, an' he took us on, but not before Toomey that  was in the Tyrone sez aloud, his voice somewhere in his stummick: 'Fwhat  in the name av misfortune does this parrit widout a tail mane by shtoppin'  the road av his betthers?'    \"The Staff Orf'cer wint blue, an' Toomey makes him pink by changin' to the  voice av a minowderin' woman an' sayin': 'Come an' kiss me, Major dear,  for me husband's at the wars an' I'm all alone at the Depot.'    \"The Staff Orf'cer wint away, an' I cud see Crook's shoulthers shakin'.    \"His Corp'ril checks Toomey. 'Lave me alone,' sez Toomey, widout a wink.  'I was his batman before he was married an' he knows fwhat I mane, av you  don't. There's nothin' like livin' in the hoight av society.'

Toomey, 'e died in 'orspital, next week it was, 'cause I bought  'arf his kit; an' I remember after that\"--    \"GUARRD, TURN OUT!\"    The Relief had come; it was four o'clock. \"I'll catch a kyart for you,  sorr,\" said Mulvaney, diving hastily into his accoutrements. \"Come up to  the top av the Fort an' we'll pershue our invistigations into M'Grath's  shtable.\" The relieved Guard strolled round the main bastion on its way to  the swimming-bath, and Learoyd grew almost talkative. Ortheris looked into  the Fort ditch and across the plain. \"Ho! it's weary waitin' for Ma-ary!\"  he hummed; \"but I'd like to kill some more bloomin' Paythans before my  time's up. War! Bloody war! North, East, South, and West.\"    \"Amen,\" said Learoyd, slowly.    \"Fwhat's here?\" said Mulvaney, checking at a blurr of white by the foot of  the old sentry-box. He stooped and touched it. \"It's Norah--Norah  M'Taggart! Why, Nonie, darlin', fwhat are ye doin' out av your mother's  bed at this time?\"    The two-year-old child of Sergeant M'Taggart must have wandered for a  breath of cool air to the very verge of the parapet of the Fort ditch, Her  tiny night-shift was gathered into a wisp round her neck and she moaned in  her sleep. \"See there!\" said Mulvaney; \"poor lamb! Look at the heat-rash  on the innocint skin av her. 'Tis hard--crool hard even for us. Fwhat must  it be for these? Wake up, Nonie, your mother will be woild about you.  Begad, the child might ha' fallen into the ditch!\"    He picked her up in the growing light, and set her on his shoulder, and  her fair curls touched the grizzled stubble of his temples. Ortheris and  Learoyd followed snapping their fingers, while Norah smiled at them a  sleepy smile. Then carolled Mulvaney, clear as a lark, dancing the baby on  his arm--      \"If any young man should marry you,       Say nothin' about the joke;     That iver ye slep' in a sinthry-box,       Wrapped up in a soldier's cloak.\"    \"Though, on my sowl, Nonie,\" he said, gravely, \"there was not much cloak  about you. Niver mind, you won't dhress like this ten years to come. Kiss  your friends an' run along to your mother.\"    Nonie, set down close to the Married Quarters, nodded with the quiet  obedience of the soldier's child, but, ere she pattered off over the  flagged path, held up her lips to be kissed by the Three Musketeers.  Ortheris wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and swore  sentimentally; Learoyd turned pink; and the two walked away together. The  Yorkshireman lifted up his voice and gave in thunder the chorus of _The  Sentry-Box_, while Ortheris piped at his side.    \"'Bin to a bloomin' sing-song, you two?\" said the Artilleryman, who was  taking his cartridge down to the Morning Gun, \"You're over merry for these  dashed days.\"       \"I bid ye take care o' the brat,\" said he,     \"For it comes of a noble race\"    Learoyd bellowed. The voices died out in the swimming-bath.    \"Oh, Terence!\" I said, dropping into Mulvaney's speech, when we were  alone, \"it's you that have the Tongue!\"    He looked at me wearily; his eyes were sunk in his head, and his face was  drawn and white, \"Eyah!\" said he; \"I've blandandhered thim through the  night somehow, but can thim that helps others help thimselves? Answer me  that, sorr!\"    And over the bastions of Fort Amara broke the pitiless day.
