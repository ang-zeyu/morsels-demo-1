[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6702"],[0,"Life of Harriet Beecher Stowe (#9)"],[1," in a      very epistolary humor in the evening, and if I had      been, I could not have written, for when I did not go      immediately to bed I was obliged to get a long French      lesson.        The seminary is finished, and the school going on      nicely. Miss Clarissa Brown is assisting Catherine in      the school. Besides her, Catherine, and myself, there      are two other teachers who both board in the family      with us: one is Miss Degan, an Italian lady who teaches      French and Italian; she rooms with me, and is very      interesting and agreeable. Miss Hawks is rooming with      Catherine. In some respects she reminds me very much      of my mother. She is gentle, affectionate, modest, and      retiring, and much beloved by all the scholars.... I      am still going on with my French, and carrying two      young ladies through Virgil, and if I have time, shall      commence Italian.        I am very comfortable and happy.        I propose, my dear grandmamma, to send you by the first      opportunity a dish of fruit of my own painting. Pray      do not now devour it in anticipation, for I cannot      promise that you will not find it sadly tasteless in      reality. If so, please excuse it, for the sake of the      poor young artist. I admire to cultivate a taste for      painting, and I wish to improve it; it was what my      dear mother admired and loved, and I cherish it for      her sake. I have thought more of this dearest of all      earthly friends these late years, since I have been old      enough to know her character and appreciate her worth.      I sometimes think that, had she lived, I might have      been both better and happier than I now am, but God is      good and wise in all his ways.    A letter written to her brother Edward in Boston, dated March 27, 1828,  shows how slowly she adopted the view of God that finally became one of  the most characteristic elements in her writings.    \"I think that those views of God which you have presented to me have  had an influence in restoring my mind to its natural tone. But still,  after all, God is a being afar off. He is so far above us that anything  but the most distant reverential affection seems almost sacrilegious.  It is that affection that can lead us to be familiar that the heart  needs. But easy and familiar expressions of attachment and that sort  of confidential communication which I should address to papa or you  would be improper for a subject to address to a king, much less for  us to address to the King of kings. The language of prayer is of  necessity stately and formal, and we cannot clothe all the little  minutiae of our wants and troubles in it. I wish I could describe to you  how I feel when I pray. I feel that I love God,--that is, that I love  Christ,--that I find comfort and happiness in it, and yet it is not  that kind of comfort which would arise from free communication of my  wants and sorrows to a friend. I sometimes wish that the Saviour were  visibly present in this world, that I might go to Him for a solution of  some of my difficulties.... Do you think, my dear brother, that there  is such a thing as so realizing the presence and character of God that  He can supply the place of earthly friends? I really wish to know what  you think of this.... Do you suppose that God really loves sinners  before they come to Him? Some say that we ought to tell them that God  hates them, that He looks on them with utter abhorrence, and that they  must love Him before He will look on them otherwise. Is it right to say  to those who are in deep distress, 'God is interested in you; He feels  for and loves you'?\"    Appended to this letter is a short note from Miss Catherine Beecher,  who evidently read the letter over and answered Harriet's questions  herself. She writes: \"When the young man came to Jesus, is it not said  that Jesus loved him, though he was unrenewed?\"    In April, 1828, Harriet again writes to her brother Edward:--    \"I have had more reason to be grateful to that friend than ever  before. He has not left me in all my weakness. It seems to me that  my love to Him is the love of despair. All my communion with Him,  though sorrowful, is soothing. I am painfully sensible of ignorance  and deficiency, but still I feel that I am willing that He should know  all. He will look on all that is wrong only to purify and reform. He  will never be irritated or impatient. He will never show me my faults  in such a manner as to irritate without helping me. A friend to whom I  would acknowledge all my faults must be perfect. Let any one once be  provoked, once speak harshly to me, once sweep all the chords of my  soul out of tune, I never could confide there again. It is only to the  most perfect Being in the universe that imperfection can look and hope  for patience. How strange!... You do not know how harsh and forbidding  everything seems, compared with his character. All through the day in  my intercourse with others, everything has a tendency to destroy the  calmness of mind gained by communion with Him. One flatters me, another  is angry with me, another is unjust to me.    \"You speak of your predilections for literature having been a snare to  you. I have found it so myself. I can scarcely think, without tears  and indignation, that all that is beautiful and lovely and poetical  has been laid on other altars. Oh! will there never be a poet with a  heart enlarged and purified by the Holy Spirit, who shall throw all the  graces of harmony, all the enchantments of feeling, pathos, and poetry,  around sentiments worthy of them?... It matters little what service He  has for me.... I do not mean to live in vain. He has given me talents,  and I will lay them at his feet, well satisfied, if He will accept  them. All my powers He can enlarge. He made my mind, and He can teach  me to cultivate and exert its faculties.\"    The following November she writes from Groton, Conn., to Miss May:--    \"I am in such an uncertain, unsettled state, traveling back and  forth, that I have very little time to write. In the first place, on  my arrival in Boston I was obliged to spend two days in talking and  telling news. Then after that came calling, visiting, etc., and then I  came off to Groton to see my poor brother George, who was quite out of  spirits and in very trying circumstances. To-morrow I return to Boston  and spend four or five days, and then go to Franklin, where I spend the  rest of my vacation.    \"I found the folks all well on my coming to Boston, and as to my new  brother, James, he has nothing to distinguish him from forty other  babies, except a very large pair of blue eyes and an uncommonly fair  complexion, a thing which is of no sort of use or advantage to a man or  boy.    \"I am thinking very seriously of remaining in Groton and taking care of  the female school, and at the same time being of assistance and company  for George. On some accounts it would not be so pleasant as returning  to Hartford, for I should be among strangers. Nothing upon this point  can be definitely decided till I have returned to Boston, and talked to  papa and Catherine.\"    Evidently papa and Catherine did not approve of the Groton plan, for  in February of the following winter Harriet writes from Hartford to  Edward, who is at this time with his father in Boston:--    \"My situation this winter (1829) is in many respects pleasant. I room  with three other teachers, Miss Fisher, Miss Mary Dutton, and Miss  Brigham. Ann Fisher you know. Miss Dutton is about twenty, has a fine  mathematical mind, and has gone as far into that science perhaps as  most students at college. She is also, as I am told, quite learned in  the languages.... Miss Brigham is somewhat older: is possessed of a  fine mind and most unconquerable energy and perseverance of character.  From early childhood she has been determined to obtain an education,  and to attain to a certain standard. Where persons are determined to  be anything, they will be. I think, for this reason, she will make a  first-rate character. Such are my companions. We spend our time in  school during the day, and in studying in the evening. My plan of study  is to read rhetoric and prepare exercises for my class the first half  hour in the evening; after that the rest of the evening is divided  between French and Italian. Thus you see the plan of my employment and  the character of my immediate companions. Besides these, there are  others among the teachers and scholars who must exert an influence  over my character. Miss Degan, whose constant occupation it is to make  others laugh; Mrs. Gamage, her room-mate, a steady, devoted, sincere  Christian.... Little things have great power over me, and if I meet  with the least thing that crosses my feelings, I am often rendered  unhappy for days and weeks.... I wish I could bring myself to feel  perfectly indifferent to the opinions of others. I believe that there  never was a person more dependent on the good and evil opinions of  those around than I am. This desire to be loved forms, I fear, the  great motive for all my actions.... I have been reading carefully the  book of Job, and I do not think that it contains the views of God which  you presented to me. God seems to have stripped a dependent creature  of all that renders life desirable, and then to have answered his  complaints from the whirlwind; and instead of showing mercy and pity,  to have overwhelmed him by a display of his power and justice.... With  the view I received from you, I should have expected that a being who  sympathizes with his guilty, afflicted creatures would not have spoken  thus. Yet, after all, I do believe that God is such a being as you  represent Him to be, and in the New Testament I find in the character  of Jesus Christ a revelation of God as merciful and compassionate; in  fact, just such a God as I need.    \"Somehow or another you have such a reasonable sort of way "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6753"],[0,"Psmith in the City (#9)"],[1," to myself, it does not enable me to secure Comrade  Rossiter's interest and win his esteem.'    'What Smith wants to know,' said Mike, 'is whether Rossiter has any  hobby of any kind. He thinks, if he has, he might work it to keep in  with him.'    Psmith, who had been listening with an air of pleased interest, much as  a father would listen to his child prattling for the benefit of a  visitor, confirmed this statement.    'Comrade Jackson,' he said, 'has put the matter with his usual  admirable clearness. That is the thing in a nutshell. Has Comrade  Rossiter any hobby that you know of? Spillikins, brass-rubbing, the  Near Eastern Question, or anything like that? I have tried him with  postage-stamps (which you'd think, as head of a postage department, he  ought to be interested in), and dried seaweed, Hall Caine, but I have  the honour to report total failure. The man seems to have no pleasures.  What does he do with himself when the day's toil is ended? That giant  brain must occupy itself somehow.'    'I don't know,' said Bannister, 'unless it's football. I saw him once  watching Chelsea. I was rather surprised.'    'Football,' said Psmith thoughtfully, 'football. By no means a scaly  idea. I rather fancy, Comrade Bannister, that you have whanged the nail  on the head. Is he strong on any particular team? I mean, have you ever  heard him, in the intervals of business worries, stamping on his desk  and yelling, \"Buck up Cottagers!\" or \"Lay 'em out, Pensioners!\" or  anything like that? One moment.' Psmith held up his hand. 'I will get  my Sherlock Holmes system to work. What was the other team in the  modern gladiatorial contest at which you saw Comrade Rossiter?'    'Manchester United.'    'And Comrade Rossiter, I should say, was a Manchester man.'    'I believe he is.'    'Then I am prepared to bet a small sum that he is nuts on Manchester  United. My dear Holmes, how--! Elementary, my dear fellow, quite  elementary. But here comes the lad in person.'    Mr Rossiter turned in from the central aisle through the counter-door,  and, observing the conversational group at the postage-desk, came  bounding up. Bannister moved off.    'Really, Smith,' said Mr Rossiter, 'you always seem to be talking. I  have overlooked the matter once, as I did not wish to get you into  trouble so soon after joining; but, really, it cannot go on. I must  take notice of it.'    Psmith held up his hand.    'The fault was mine,' he said, with manly frankness. 'Entirely mine.  Bannister came in a purely professional spirit to deposit a letter with  Comrade Jackson. I engaged him in conversation on the subject of the  Football League, and I was just trying to correct his view that  Newcastle United were the best team playing, when you arrived.'    'It is perfectly absurd,' said Mr Rossiter, 'that you should waste the  bank's time in this way. The bank pays you to work, not to talk about  professional football.'    'Just so, just so,' murmured Psmith.    'There is too much talking in this department.'    'I fear you are right.'    'It is nonsense.'    'My own view,' said Psmith, 'was that Manchester United were by far the  finest team before the public.'    'Get on with your work, Smith.'    Mr Rossiter stumped off to his desk, where he sat as one in thought.    'Smith,' he said at the end of five minutes.    Psmith slid from his stool, and made his way deferentially towards him.    'Bannister's a fool,' snapped Mr Rossiter.    'So I thought,' said Psmith.    'A perfect fool. He always was.'    Psmith shook his head sorrowfully, as who should say, 'Exit Bannister.'    'There is no team playing today to touch Manchester United.'    'Precisely what I said to Comrade Bannister.'    'Of course. You know something about it.'    'The study of League football,' said Psmith, 'has been my relaxation  for years.'    'But we have no time to discuss it now.'    'Assuredly not, sir. Work before everything.'    'Some other time, when--'    '--We are less busy. Precisely.'    Psmith moved back to his seat.    'I fear,' he said to Mike, as he resumed work, 'that as far as Comrade  Rossiter's friendship and esteem are concerned, I have to a certain  extent landed Comrade Bannister in the bouillon; but it was in a good  cause. I fancy we have won through. Half an hour's thoughtful perusal  of the \"Footballers' Who's Who\", just to find out some elementary facts  about Manchester United, and I rather think the friendly Native is  corralled. And now once more to work. Work, the hobby of the hustler  and the deadbeat's dread.'          9. The Haunting of Mr Bickersdyke      Anything in the nature of a rash and hasty move was wholly foreign to  Psmith's tactics. He had the patience which is the chief quality of the  successful general. He was content to secure his base before making any  offensive movement. It was a fortnight before he turned his attention  to the education of Mr Bickersdyke. During that fortnight he conversed  attractively, in the intervals of work, on the subject of League  football in general and Manchester United in particular. The subject is  not hard to master if one sets oneself earnestly to it; and Psmith  spared no pains. The football editions of the evening papers are not  reticent about those who play the game: and Psmith drank in every  detail with the thoroughness of the conscientious student. By the end  of the fortnight he knew what was the favourite breakfast-food of J.  Turnbull; what Sandy Turnbull wore next his skin; and who, in the  opinion of Meredith, was England's leading politician. These facts,  imparted to and discussed with Mr Rossiter, made the progress of the  _entente cordiale_ rapid. It was on the eighth day that Mr  Rossiter consented to lunch with the Old Etonian. On the tenth he  played the host. By the end of the fortnight the flapping of the white  wings of Peace over the Postage Department was setting up a positive  draught. Mike, who had been introduced by Psmith as a distant relative  of Moger, the goalkeeper, was included in the great peace.    'So that now,' said Psmith, reflectively polishing his eye-glass, 'I  think that we may consider ourselves free to attend to Comrade  Bickersdyke. Our bright little Mancunian friend would no more run us in  now than if we were the brothers Turnbull. We are as inside forwards to  him.'    The club to which Psmith and Mr Bickersdyke belonged was celebrated for  the steadfastness of its political views, the excellence of its  cuisine, and the curiously Gorgonzolaesque marble of its main  staircase. It takes all sorts to make a world. It took about four  thousand of all sorts to make the Senior Conservative Club. To be  absolutely accurate, there were three thousand seven hundred and  eighteen members.    To Mr Bickersdyke for the next week it seemed as if there was only one.    There was nothing crude or overdone about Psmith's methods. The  ordinary man, having conceived the idea of haunting a fellow clubman,  might have seized the first opportunity of engaging him in  conversation. Not so Psmith. The first time he met Mr Bickersdyke in  the club was on the stairs after dinner one night. The great man,  having received practical proof of the excellence of cuisine referred  to above, was coming down the main staircase at peace with all men,  when he was aware of a tall young man in the 'faultless evening dress'  of which the female novelist is so fond, who was regarding him with a  fixed stare through an eye-glass. The tall young man, having caught his  eye, smiled faintly, nodded in a friendly but patronizing manner, and  passed on up the staircase to the library. Mr Bickersdyke sped on in  search of a waiter.    As Psmith sat in the library with a novel, the waiter entered, and  approached him.    'Beg pardon, sir,' he said. 'Are you a member of this club?'    Psmith fumbled in his pocket and produced his eye-glass, through which  he examined the waiter, button by button.    'I am Psmith,' he said simply.    'A member, sir?'    '_The_ member,' said Psmith. 'Surely you participated in the  general rejoicings which ensued when it was announced that I had been  elected? But perhaps you were too busy working to pay any attention. If  so, I respect you. I also am a worker. A toiler, not a flatfish. A  sizzler, not a squab. Yes, I am a member. Will you tell Mr Bickersdyke  that I am sorry, but I have been elected, and have paid my entrance fee  and subscription.'    'Thank you, sir.'    The waiter went downstairs and found Mr Bickersdyke in the lower  smoking-room.    'The gentleman says he is, sir.'    'H'm,' said the bank-manager. 'Coffee and Benedictine, and a cigar.'    'Yes, sir.'    On the following day Mr Bickersdyke met Psmith in the club three times,  and on the day after that seven. Each time the latter's smile was  friendly, but patronizing. Mr Bickersdyke began to grow restless.    On the fourth day Psmith made his first remark. The manager was reading  the evening paper in a corner, when Psmith sinking gracefully into a  chair beside him, caused him to look up.    'The rain keeps off,' said Psmith.    Mr Bickersdyke looked as if he wished his employee would imitate the  rain, but he made no reply.    Psmith called a waiter.    'Would you mind bringing me a small cup of coffee?' he said. 'And for  you,' he added to Mr Bickersdyke.    'Nothing,' growled the manager.    'And nothing for Mr Bickersdyke.'    The waiter retired. Mr Bickersdyke became absorbed in his paper.    'I see from my morning paper,' said Psmith, affably, 'that you are to  address a meeting at the Kenningford Town Hall next week. I shall come  and hear you. Our politics differ in some respects, I fear--I incline  to the Socialist view--but nevertheless I shall listen to your remarks  with great interest, great interest.'    The paper rustled, but no reply came from behind it.    'I heard from father this morning,' resumed Psmith.    Mr Bickersdyke lowered his paper and glared at him.    '"]]]
