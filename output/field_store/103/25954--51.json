Every Sunday the class in Sunday school, and the bells ringing  and the same little walk of four blocks there and back. Every Tuesday and  Friday the club meeting--the Merry Maids, and the Mascot, both just alike,  where you did the same things. And the same round of calls with mamma,  on the same people, twice a month the year round. And the little social  festivities--ah, Manley, if you only knew how I tong for something rough  and real in my life!\" It was very nearly what she said to the tired-faced  teacher on the train.    \"Well, if that's what you want, you've come to the right place,\" he told  her dryly.    Later, when they drew close to a red coulee rim which he said was the far  side of Cold Spring Coulee, she forgot how tired she was, and felt every  nerve quiver with eagerness.    Later still, when in the glare of a July sun they drove around a low knoll,  dipped into a wide, parched coulee, and then came upon a barren little  habitation inclosed in a meager fence of the barbed wire she thought so  detestable, she shut her eyes mentally to something she could not quite  bring herself to face.    He lifted her out and tumbled the great trunks upon the ground before he  drove on to the corrals. \"Here's the key,\" he said, \"if you want to go in.  I won't be more than a minute or two.\" He did not look into her face when  he spoke.    Val stood just inside the gate and tried to adjust all this to her mental  picture. There was the front yard, for instance. A few straggling vines  against the porch, and a sickly cluster or two of blossoms--those were the  sweet peas, surely. The sun-baked bed of pale-green plants without so much  as a bud of promise, she recognized, after a second glance, as the poppies.  For the rest, there were weeds against the fence, sun-ripened grass trodden  flat, yellow, gravelly patches where nothing grew--and a glaring, burning  sun beating down upon it all.    The cottage--never afterward did she think of it by that name, but always  as a shack--was built of boards placed perpendicularly, with battens nailed  over the cracks to keep out the wind and the snow. At one side was a  \"lean-to\" kitchen, and on the other side was the porch that was just  a narrow platform with a roof over it. It was not wide enough for a  rocking-chair, to say nothing of swinging a hammock. In the first hasty  inspection this seemed to be about all. She was still hesitating before the  door when Manley came back from putting up the horses.    \"I'm afraid your flowers are a lost cause,\" he remarked cheerfully. \"They  were looking pretty good two or three weeks ago. This hot weather has dried  them up. Next year we'll have water down here to the house. All these  things take time.\"    \"Oh, of course they do.\" Val managed to smile into his eyes. \"Let's see how  many dishes you left dirty; bachelors always leave their dishes unwashed on  the table, don't they?\"    \"Sometimes--but I generally wash mine.\" He led the way into the house,  which smelled hot and close, with the odor of food long since cooked  and eaten, before he threw all the windows open. The front room was  clean--after a man's idea of cleanliness. The floor was covered with an  exceedingly dusty carpet, and a rug or two. Her latest photograph was  nailed to the wall; and when Val saw it she broke into hysterical laughter.    \"You've nailed your colors to the mast,\" she cried, and after that it was  all a joke. The home-made couch, with the calico cushions and the cowhide  spread, was a matter for mirth. She sat down upon it to try it, and was  informed that chicken wire makes a fine spring. The rickety table, with  tobacco, magazines, and books placed upon it in orderly piles, was  something to smile over. The chairs, and especially the one cane rocker  which went sidewise over the floor if you rocked in it long enough, were  pronounced original.    In the kitchen the same masculine idea of cleanliness and order obtained.  The stove was quite red, but it had been swept clean. The table was pushed  against the only window there, and the back part was filled with glass  preserve jars, cans, and a loaf of bread wrapped carefully in paper; but  the oilcloth cover was clean--did it not show quite plainly the marks of  the last washing? Two frying pans were turned bottom up on an obscure table  in an obscure corner of the room, and a zinc water pail stood beside them.    There were other details which impressed themselves upon her shrinking  brain, and though she still insisted upon smiling at everything, she stood  in the middle of the room holding up her skirts quite unconsciously, as if  she were standing at a muddy street crossing, wondering how in the world  she was ever going to reach the Other side.    \"Isn't it all--deliciously--primitive?\" she asked, in a weak little voice,  when the smile would stay no longer. \"I--love it, dear.\" That was a lie;  more, she was not in the habit of fibbing for the sake of politeness or  anything else, so that the words stood for a good deal.    Manley looked into the zinc water pail, took it up, and started for an  outer door, rattling the tin dipper as he went. \"Want to go up to the  spring?\" he queried, over his shoulder, \"Water's the first thing--I'm  horribly thirsty.\"    Val turned to follow him. \"Oh, yes--the spring!\" She stopped, however, as  soon as she had spoken. \"No, dear. There'll be plenty of other times. I'll  stay here.\"    He gave her a glance bright with love and blind happiness in her presence  there, and went off whistling and rattling the pail at his side.    Val did not even watch him go. She stood still in the kitchen and looked at  the table, and at the stove, and at the upturned frying pans. She watched  two great horseflies buzzing against a window-pane, and when she could  endure that no longer, she went into the front room and stared vacantly  around at the bare walls. When she saw her picture again, nailed  fast beside the kitchen door, her face lost a little of its frozen  blankness--enough so that her lips quivered until she bit them into  steadiness.    She went then to the door and stood looking dully out into the parched  yard, and at the wizened little pea vines clutching feebly at their  white-twine trellis. Beyond stretched the bare hills with the wavering  brown line running down the nearest one--the line that she knew was the  trail from town. She was guilty of just one rebellious sentence before she  struggled back to optimism.    \"I said I wanted it to be rough, but I didn't mean--why, this is just  squalid!\" She looked down the coulee and glimpsed the river flowing calmly  past the mouth of it, a majestic blue belt fringed sparsely with green.  It must be a mile away, but it relieved wonderfully the monotony of brown  hills, and the vivid coloring brightened her eyes. She heard Manley enter  the kitchen, set down the pail of water, and come on to where she stood.    \"I'd forgotten you said we could see the river from here,\" she told him,  smiling over her shoulder. \"It's beautiful, isn't it? I don't suppose,  though, there's a boat within millions of miles.\"    \"Oh, there's a boat down there. It leaks, though. I just use it for ducks,  close to shore. Admiring our view? Great, don't you think?\"    Val clasped her hands before her and let her gaze travel again over the  sweep of rugged hills. \"It's--wonderful. I thought I knew, but I see I  didn't. I feel very small, Manley; does one ever grow up to it?\"    He seemed dimly to catch the note of utter desolation. \"You'll get used to  all that,\" he assured her. \"I thought I'd reached the jumping-off place, at  first. But now--you couldn't dog me outa the country.\"    He was slipping into the vernacular, and Val noticed it, and wondered dully  if she would ever do likewise. She had not yet admitted to herself that  Manley was different. She had told herself many times that it would take  weeks to wipe out the strangeness born of three years' separation. He was  the same, of course; everything else was new and--different. That was all.  He seemed intensely practical, and he seemed to feel that his love-making  had all been done by letter, and that nothing now remained save the  business of living. So, when he told her to rest, and that he would get  dinner and show her how a bachelor kept house, she let him go with no reply  save that vague, impersonal smile which Kent had encountered at the depot.    While he rattled things about in the kitchen, she stood still in the  doorway with her fingers doubled into tight little fists, and stared out  over the great, treeless, unpeopled land which had swallowed her alive. She  tried to think--and then, in another moment, she was trying not to think.    Glancing quickly over her shoulder, to make sure Manley was too busy to  follow her, she went off the porch and stood uncertain in the parched  inclosure which was the front yard.    \"I may as well see it all, and be done,\" she whispered, and went stealthily  around the corner of the house, holding up her skirts as she had done in  the kitchen. There was a dim path beaten in the wiry grass--a path which  started at the kitchen door and wound away up the coulee. She followed it.  Undoubtedly it would lead her to the spring; beyond that she refused to let  her thoughts travel.    In five minutes--for she went slowly--she stopped beside a stock-trampled  pool of water and yellow mud. A few steps farther on, a barrel had been  sunk in the ground at the base of a huge gray rock; a barrel which filled  slowly and spilled the overflow into the mud. There was also a trough, and  there was a barrier made of poles and barbed wire to keep the cattle from  the barrel. One crawled between two wires, it would seem, to dip up water  for the house. There were no trees--not real trees. There were some  chokecherry bushes higher than her head, and there were other bushes that  did not look particularly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8547"],[0,"Pirke Avot: The Sayings of the Jewish Fathers (#9)"],[1,"and interchange no words of _Torah_, they are a meeting of scorners,  concerning whom it is said, 'The godly man sitteth not in the seat of  the scorners' (8); but if two sit together and interchange words of  _Torah_, the Divine Presence (9) abides among them; as it is said,  'Then they that feared the Lord spake one with the other; and the Lord  hearkened and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him,  for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon His name,' (10).  Now the Scripture enables me to draw this inference in respect to two  persons; whence can it be deduced that if even one person sedulously  occupies himself with the _Torah_, the Holy One, blessed be He,  appoints unto him a reward?  Because it is said, 'though he sit alone,  and meditate in stillness, yet he taketh it (the reward) upon him'\"  (11).          (7) He lived about 120 C.E.  He was the father of Beruriah,        the wife of Rabbi Meir.          (8) Ps. I, 1.  Verse 2 of this psalm continues, \"But his        delight is in the Law of the Lord.\"          (9) [shechinah] literally \"dwelling,\" is a name applied to God        when He is spoken of as dwelling among men.  See Schechter,        _Aspects, en passim_; Abelson, _Immanence of God_, p. 77 _et        seq._          (10) Mal. III, 16.          (11) Lam. III, 27.    4. R. Simeon (12) said, \"If three have eaten at a table and have  spoken there no words of _Torah_, it is as if they had eaten of  sacrifices to dead idols, of whom it is said, 'For all their tables  are full of vomit and filthiness; the All-present is not (in their  thoughts)' (13).  But if three have eaten at a table and have spoken  there words of _Torah_, it is as if they had eaten at the table of the  All-present, for Scripture says, 'And he said unto me, This is the  table that is before the Lord'\" (14).          (12) Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai lived about the middle of the        second century C.E., and was a pupil of Akiba.  See Danziger,        _ibid._, pp. 211-241.  He was long thought to be the author of        the well-known kabbalistic work _Zohar_, which was, however,        probably written in the thirteenth century by Moses Shem Tob        de Leon.  See the _Jewish Encyclopedia_, art. _Zohar;_ Graetz,        _History_, IV, p. 11 _et seq.;_ Schechter, _Studies_, I, pp.        18, 19, 133; and H. Sperling, in _Aspects of the Hebrew        Genius_, p. 165 _et seq._          (13) Isa. XXVIII, 8.  The literal interpretation of [bli        makom] is, there is \"no place\" clean of defilement; but the        word [makom] being used to designate God (see above, chapter        II, n. 35), suggests the interpretation, \"without mention of        the name of God.\"          (14) Ezek. XLI, 22.    5. R. Chanina, the son of Hakinai (15), said, \"He who keeps awake at  night, and goes on his way alone, while turning his heart to vanity,  such a one forfeits his own life\" (16).          (15) He lived about 120 C.E., and was a pupil of Akiba.  See        Bacher, _ibid._, 436 _et seq._          (16) Even the sleepless man and the solitary traveller must        turn their thoughts to the _Torah_.    6. R. Nechunya, son of ha-Kanah (17), said, \"Whoso receives upon  himself the yoke of the _Torah_, from the yoke of the kingdom and the  yoke of worldly care will be removed (18), but whoso breaks off from  him the yoke of the _Torah_, upon him will be laid the yoke of the  kingdom and the yoke of worldly care.\"          (17) He lived about 80 C.E.  See Bacher, _ibid._, pp. 58-61.          (18) The \"yoke of the kingdom\" refers to the taxes and burdens        exacted by the government; the \"yoke of worldly care\" is        anxiety of the struggle for existence.    7. R. Chalafta, the son of Dosa (19), of the village of Chanania said,  \"When ten people sit together and occupy themselves with the _Torah_,  the _Shechinah_ (20) abides among them, as it is said, 'God standeth  in the congregation (21) of the godly' (22).  And whence can it be  shown that the same applies to five?  Because it is said, 'He hath  found his band (23) upon the earth' (24).  And whence can it be shown  that the same applies to three?  Because it is said, 'He judgeth among  the judges' (25).  And whence can it be shown that the same applies to  two?  Because it is said, 'Then they that feared the Lord spake one  with the other; and the Lord hearkened, and heard' (26).  And whence  can it be shown that the same applies even to one?  Because it is  said, 'In every place where I cause my name to be remembered I will  come unto thee and I will bless thee'\" (27).          (19) He was probably a disciple of R. Meir.

See        Sulzburger, _The Ancient Hebrew Parliament_, chapter I.          (22) Ps. LXXXII, 1.          (23) An _agudah_ (lit., \"bundle,\" \"bunch\"), \"bond,\" \"union,\"        is constituted of at least five, though some authorities        maintain that it stands for three.  See Taylor, _Sayings_, p.        46, n. 15.  This word is used in the name of a number of        Jewish societies whose members bind themselves to brotherly        love and mutual assistance. as _Agudat Achim_, \"United        Brethren,\" etc.          (24) Amos, IX, 6.          (25) Ps. LXXXII, 1.  Every _bet din_, \"judicial tribunal,\"        consisted of at least three members (_Sanhedrin_, 3b).          (26) Mal. III, 16.          (27) Ex. XX, 24.    8. R. Eleazar of Bertota (28) said, \"Give unto Him of what is His, for  thou and thine are His: this is also found expressed by David, who  said, 'For all things come of Thee, and of Thine own we have given  Thee'\" (29).          (28) He lived during the second century C.E.  See Bacher,        _ibid._, pp. 442-445.          (29) I Chron. XXIX, 14.    9. R. Jacob said, \"He who is walking by the way and studying, and  breaks off his study and says, 'How fine is that tree, how fine is  that fallow,' him the Scripture regards as if he had forfeited his  life\" (30).          (30) One must not interrupt his studies even to admire the        beauties of nature.    10. R. Dostai (31), the son of Jannai, said in the name of R. Meir  (32), \"Whoso forgets one word of his study, him the Scripture regards  as if he had forfeited his life, for it is said, 'Only take heed to  thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things  which thine eyes have seen' (33).  Now, one might suppose (that the  same result follows) even if a man's study has been too hard for him.  (To guard against such an inference), it is said, 'And lest they  depart from thy heart all the days of thy life' (34).  Thus a person's  guilt is not established until he deliberately and of set purpose  removes those lessons from his heart.\"          (31) He lived about 160 C.E.          (32) Rabbi Meir was the celebrated pupil of Akiba.  His wife        was the well-known Bruriah.

(33) Deut. IV, 9.          (34) Deut. IV, 9.    11. R. Chanina, the son of Dosa (35), said, \"He in whom the fear of  sin precedes wisdom, his wisdom shall endure; but he in whom wisdom  comes before the fear of sin, his wisdom will not endure\" (36).  12.  He used to say, \"He whose works exceed his wisdom, his wisdom shall  endure; but he whose wisdom exceeds his works, his wisdom will not  endure\" (37).  13. He used to say, \"He in whom the spirit of his  fellow-creatures takes not delight, in him the Spirit of the  All-present takes not delight.\"          (35) A contemporary of Jochanan ben Zakkai (10 B.C.E.-90        C.E.).

CXI, 10: \"The beginning of wisdom is the fear of        the Lord.\"  \"A man's fear of sin should be instinctive, rather        than a result of calculation, . . . a man should build upon        the foundation of religious feeling, rather than upon        philosophy\" (Taylor).          (37) Cf. above, chapter I, 17, \"Not learning but doing is the        chief thing.\"    14. R. Dosa, the son of Horkinas (38), said, \"Morning sleep, midday  wine, childish babbling, and attending the houses of assembly of the  ignorant waste a man's life\" (39).          (38) A contemporary of Jochanan ben Zakkai.          (39) Idleness, etc., indispose one for the study of the        _Torah_ and for business.    15. R. Eleazar ha-Mudai said, \"He who profanes things sacred, and  despises the festivals, and puts his fellow-man to shame in public,  and makes void the covenant of Abraham, our father (40), and makes the  _Torah_ bear a meaning other than the right (41); (such a one) even  though knowledge of the _Torah_ and good deeds be his, has no share in  the world to come\" (42).          (40) _I.e._ circumcision.          (41) Or \"acts barefacedly against the _Torah_.\"          (42) Knowledge and moral excellence alone are not sufficient.    16. R. Ishmael (43) said, \"Be submissive to a superior (44), affable  to the young (45), and receive all men with cheerfulness\" (46).          (43) Lived about 120 C.E.  See Bacher, _ibid._, pp. 240-271.

Worterbuch, _sub_ [shachar (shin-chet-resh)], Fiebig), and \"a        suppliant\" (Singer).          (46) Cf. chapter I, 15.    17. R. Akiba (47) said, \"Jesting and levity lead a man on to lewdness.   The _Massorah_ (48) is a rampart around the _Torah_; tithes are a  safeguard to riches (49); good"]]]
