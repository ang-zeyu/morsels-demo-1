[Footnote: The disappearance of a vocal element from a  language is a phenomenon with which etymologists are familiar. The loss  of the Greek digamma is a well-known instance. The harsh guttural,  resembling the German ch. which formerly existed in the English  language, has vanished from it, leaving its traces in the uncouth  orthography of such words as _plough_, _high_, _though_, and the like.  Within the past three centuries the sound of _I_ has been lost from many  words, such as _walk_, _talk_, _balm_ and _calm_. The sound of _r_ is  disappearing from a large portion of the language. In ordinary speech,  _arm_ rhymes with _calm_, _morning_ with _fanning_, _higher_ with  _Sophia_. Modern French, as is well known, has attained its present  euphony through the disappearance of consonantal elements from many  words in which they formerly existed.]    The translation of La Fort's book was procured from him and another  educated member of his tribe; but there was not time to obtain all the  elucidations needed to ensure precise verbal accuracy throughout.          CHAPTER IV.    THE CONDOLING COUNCIL.--CLANS AND CLASSES.      The name usually given to the Book of Rites, or rather to its contents,  is, in the Canienga dialect, _Okayondonghsera Yondennase_ (or in the  French missionary orthography, _Okaiontonhstra Iontennase_), which may  be rendered \"Ancient Rites of the Condoling Council.\" [Footnote:  _Okaionlonhsera_ is a substantive derived from _akaion_, old, or  ancient. The termination _sera_ gives it an abstract sense. \"The  antiquities,\" or rather \"the ancientnesses,\" is the nearest literal  rendering which our language allows, _Iontennase_ is a verbal form,  derived from _kitenre_ (in Bruyas, _gentenron_), to pity, or sympathize  with. It may be rendered \"they who sympathize,\" or \"the condolers.\"  Both, words, however, have acquired a special meaning in their  application to these ceremonies.] Among the many councils, civil and  religious, tribal and federal, in which the public spirit and social  temper of the Iroquois found their most congenial and most popular mode  of display, the Yondennase, the Condoling (or Mourning) Council, held  the highest rank. It was, in a certain way, typical of the whole, and  comprised the elements of all the other councils. In its earlier form  this council was not peculiar to the Iroquois. We know, from the Jesuit  reports, that it was the custom of the Hurons to hold a public  lamentation for the death of a chief, and at the same time to appoint  another who should take his place and assume his name. But that which  among the Hurons was merely a tribal custom became, in the Iroquois form  of government, an important institution, essential to the maintenance of  their state. By the ordinances of their League, it was required that the  number of their federal senate should be maintained undiminished. On the  death of one of its members, it was the duty of the nation to which he  belonged to notify the other nations of the event, and of the time and  place at which he would be lamented and his successor installed. The  notice was given in the usual manner, by official messengers, who bore  for credentials certain strings of wampum, appropriate to the occasion.  The place of meeting was commonly the chief town of the nation which had  suffered the loss. In this nation a family council, under the  presidency, and subject, indeed (as has been shown), to the controlling  decision, of the chief matron of the deceased senator's kindred--usually  his mother, if she survived him--was in the meantime convened to select  his successor. The selection must be approved both by his clan and by  his nation; but as their sentiments were generally known beforehand,  this approval was rarely withheld. Indeed, the mischief resulting from  an unsuitable choice was always likely to be slight; for both the  national council and the federal senate had the right of deposing any  member who was found unqualified for the office.    At the appointed day the chiefs of the other nations approached the  place of meeting. A multitude of their people, men and women, usually  accompanied them, prepared to take part both in the exhibitions of grief  and in the festivities which always followed the installation of the new  councillor. The approaching chiefs halted when they reached the border  of the \"opening,\" or cleared space surrounding the town. Here took place  the \"preliminary ceremony,\" styled in the Book of Rites,  \"_Deyughnyonkwarakda_,\" a word which means simply \"at the edge of the  woods.\" At this point a fire was kindled, a pipe was lighted and passed  around with much formality, and an address of welcome was made by the  principal chief of the inviting nation. The topics of this address  comprised a singular mixture of congratulation and condolence, and seem  to have been prescribed forms, which had come down from immemorial  antiquity, as appropriate to the occasion.    The guests were then formally conducted--\"led by the hand,\" as the Book  recites--to the Council House of the town. They seem, anciently at  least, to have advanced in the order of their clans. The towns belonging  to the Wolf clan were first enumerated--probably as the chiefs belonging  to them took their places--then the towns of the Tortoise clan (or  double clan, as it is styled), and finally those of the Bear clan. In  all, twenty-three towns are named. Five of them are expressly stated to  have been \"added lately.\" The residue are supposed to be the names of  the towns in which the people of the Five Nations resided at the time  when the confederacy was formed, though this point is uncertain. That  few of these can now be identified, is what would naturally be expected.  It is well known that the Indians had the custom of removing their towns  from time to time, at intervals varying from ten to twenty years, as the  fuel in their neighborhood became exhausted, and as the diminished crops  under their primitive mode of agriculture showed the need of fresher  soil. Only those villages would be permanent whose localities offered  some special advantages, as fortresses, fishing places, or harbors.  [Footnote: See Appendix, note E.]    This list of towns has another peculiarity which arrests the attention.  It apparently comprises all the towns of the League, but these are  divided among only three clans, those of the Wolf, the Tortoise and the  Bear. The other clans of the confederacy are not once named in the book.  Yet there are indications which show that when the list of chiefs which  concludes the book was written, at a date long after this list of towns  was first recited, other clans existed in three of the nations. This is  an important point, which merits further consideration. Those who have  read the admirable account of the \"League of the Iroquois,\" by Morgan,  and his philosophic work on \"Ancient Society,\" are aware that he has  brought out and elucidated with much clearness and force the nature and  results of the remarkable clan system which prevails among the North  American Indians. It is not universal, as it does not seem to be known  among the widely scattered bands of the Crees and the Athapascans, or  among the Indians of Oregon. [Footnote: See _Ancient Society_, pp. 167,  175, 177.] It was found, however, among the great majority of tribes in  the region north of Mexico and east of the Rocky Mountains, and was  sufficiently alike in all to indicate a common origin. Mr. Morgan finds  this origin in a kinship, real or supposed, among the members of each  clan. He considers the clan, or gens, and not the single family, to be  the natural unit of primitive society. It is, in his view, a stage  through which the human race passes in its progress from the savage  state to civilization. It is difficult, however, to reconcile this  theory with the fact that among some races, as for example, the  Polynesian and Feejeean, which are in precisely the same stage of social  advancement as the North American Indians, this institution is unknown;  and even among the Indians, as has been said, it is not everywhere  found. There are many indications which seem to show that the system is  merely an artificial arrangement, instituted for social convenience. It  is natural, in the sense that the desire for association is natural to  man. The sentiment is one which manifests itself alike in all stages of  society. The guilds of the middle ages, the masonic and other secret  brotherhoods, religious organizations, trade unions, clubs, and even  political parties, are all manifestations of this associative instinct.  The Indian clan was simply a brotherhood, an aggregate of persons united  by a common tie, sometimes of origin, sometimes merely of locality.  These brotherhoods were not permanent, but were constantly undergoing  changes, forming, dividing, coalescing, vanishing. The names of many of  them show their recent origin. The Chicasas have a \"Spanish clan.\"  [Footnote: _Ancient Society_, p. 163.] The Shawnees had a \"Horse clan.\"  [Footnote: Ibid, p. 168.] The Iroquois, of Eastern Canada, made up of  fragments of all the Five Nations, had an \"Onondaga clan,\" and an  \"Oneida clan.\" [Footnote: Rotisennakete, and Rotinenhiotronon. See J. A.  Cuoq, _Lexique de la Langut Iroquoise_, p. 154. The proper meaning of  these names will be hereafter shown.] It is a curious fact that, as Mr.  Morgan states, \"the Iroquois claim to have originated a division of the  people into tribes [clans or gentes] as a means of creating new  relationships, to bind the people more firmly together. It is further  asserted by them that they forced or introduced this social organization  among the Cherokees, the Chippeways (Massasaugas) and several other  Indian nations, with whom, in ancient times, they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8599"],[0,"Fairy Tales from the Arabian Nights (#9)"],[1,"of  this,' added he, 'when you know that these horses, mules, and other  animals that you have seen are so many men, like you and me, whom  she has transformed by her diabolical art. And when young men like  you enter the city, she has persons stationed to stop and bring  them, either by fair means or force, before her. She receives them  in the most obliging manner; she caresses them, regales them, and  lodges them magnificently. But she does not suffer them long to  enjoy this happiness. There is not one of them whom she has not  transformed into some animal or bird at the end of forty days. You  told me all these animals opposed your landing and entering, the  city. This was the only way they could make you comprehend the  danger you were going to expose yourself to, and they did all in  their power to save you.'    This account exceedingly afflicted the young King of Persia.  'Alas!' cried he, 'to what extremities has my ill-fortune reduced  me! I am hardly freed from one enchantment, which I look back upon  with horror, but I find myself exposed to another much more  terrible.' This gave him occasion to relate his story to the old  man more at length, and to acquaint him with his birth, quality,  his falling in love with the Princess of Samandal, and her cruelty  in changing him into a bird the very moment he had seen her and  declared his love to her.    When the prince came to speak of his good fortune in finding a  queen who broke the enchantment, the old man, to encourage him,  said, 'Notwithstanding all I told you of the magic queen, that  ought not to give you the least disquiet, since I am generally  beloved throughout the city, and am not unknown to the queen  herself, who has much respect for me; therefore it was singularly  fortunate that you addressed yourself to me rather than elsewhere.  You are secure in my house, where I advise you to continue, if you  think fit; and provided you do not stray from hence, I dare assure  you you will have no just cause to complain; so that you are under  no sort of constraint whatsoever.'    King Beder thanked the old man for his kind reception, and the  protection he was pleased so readily to afford him. He sat down at  the entrance of the shop, where he no sooner appeared than his  youth and handsome looks drew the eyes of all that passed that way.  Many stopped and complimented the old man on his having acquired so  fine a slave, as they imagined the king to be; and they were the  more surprised, because they could not comprehend how so beautiful  a youth could escape the queen's knowledge. 'Believe not,' said the  old man, 'that this is a slave; you all know that I am not rich  enough. He is my nephew, son of a brother of mine that is dead; and  as I had no children of my own, I sent for him to keep me company.'    They congratulated his good fortune in having so fine a young man  for his relation; but could not help telling him they feared the  queen would take him from him. 'You know her well,' said they, 'and  you cannot be ignorant of the danger to which you are exposed,  after all the examples you have seen. How grieved would you be if  she should serve him as she has done so many others that we know  of!'    'I am obliged to you,' replied the old man, 'for your good will  towards me, and I heartily thank you for your care; but I shall  never entertain the least thought that the queen will do me any  injury, after all the kindness she has professed for me. In case  she happens to hear of this young man, and speaks to me about him,  I doubt not she will cease to think of him, so soon as she comes to  know he is my nephew.'    The old man was exceedingly glad to hear the commendations they  bestowed on the young King of Persia. He became as fond of him as  if he had been his own son. They had lived about a month together,  when, King Beder sitting at the shop-door, after his ordinary  manner, Queen Labe (so was this magic queen named) happened to come  by with great pomp. The young king no sooner perceived the guards  coming before her, than he arose, and, going into the shop, asked  the old man what all that show meant. 'The queen is coming by,'  answered he, 'but stand still and fear nothing.'    The queen's guards, clothed in purple uniform, and well armed and  mounted, marched in four files, with their sabres drawn, to the  number of a thousand, and every one of their officers, as they  passed by the shop, saluted the old man: then followed a like  number habited in brocaded silk, and better mounted, whose officers  did the old man the like honour. Next came as many young ladies on  foot, equally beautiful, richly dressed, and set off with precious  stones. They marched gravely, with half pikes in their hands; and  in the midst of them appeared Queen Labe, on a horse glittering  with diamonds, with a golden saddle, and a harness of inestimable  value. All the young ladies saluted the old man as they passed by  him; and the queen, struck with the good mien of King Beder,  stopped as soon as she came before the shop. 'Abdallah' (so was the  old man named), said she to him, 'tell me, I beseech thee, does  that beautiful and charming slave belong to thee? and is it long  that thou hast been in possession of him?'    Abdallah, before he answered the queen, threw himself on the  ground, and rising again, said, 'Madam, it is my nephew, son of a  brother I had, who has not long been dead. Having no children, I  look upon him as my son, and sent for him to come and comfort me,  intending to leave him what I have when I die.'    Queen Labe, who had never yet seen any one to compare with King  Beder, thought immediately of getting the old man to abandon him to  her. 'Father,' quoth she, 'will you not oblige me so far as to make  me a present of this young man? Do not refuse me, I conjure you;  and I swear by the fire and the light, I will make him so great and  powerful that no individual in the world ever arrived at such good  fortune. Although my purpose were to do evil to all mankind, yet he  shall be the sole exception. I trust you will grant me what I  desire, more on the account of the friendship I know you have for  me, than for the esteem you know I always had, and shall ever have  for you.'    'Madam,' replied the good Abdallah, 'I am infinitely obliged to  your majesty for all your kindness, and the honours you propose to  do my nephew. He is not worthy to approach so great a queen, and I  humbly beseech your majesty to excuse him.'    'Abdallah,' replied the queen, 'I all along flattered myself you  loved me; and I could never have thought you would have given me so  evident a token of your slighting my request. But I here swear once  more by the fire and light, and even by whatsoever is most sacred  in my religion, that I will pass on no farther till I have  conquered your obstinacy. I understand very well what raises your  apprehensions; but I promise you shall never have any occasion to  repent having obliged me in so sensible a manner.'    Old Abdallah was exceedingly grieved, both on his own account and  King Beder's, for being in a manner forced to obey the queen.  'Madam,' replied he, 'I would not willingly have your majesty  entertain an ill opinion of the respect I have for you, and my zeal  always to do whatever I can to oblige you. I put entire confidence  in your royal word, and I do not in the least doubt but you will  keep it. I only beg of your majesty to delay doing this great  honour to my nephew till you shall again pass this way.'    'That shall be to-morrow,' said the queen, who inclined her head,  as a token of being pleased, and so went forward towards her  palace.    When Queen Labe and all her attendants were out of sight, the good  Abdallah said to King Beder, 'Son, (for so he was wont to call him,  for fear of some time or other betraying him when he spoke of him  in public), 'it has not been in my power, as you may have observed,  to refuse the queen what she demanded of me with so great  earnestness, for fear I might force her to employ her magic both  against you and myself openly or secretly, and treat you, as much  from resentment to you as to me, with more signal cruelty than all  those she has had in her power before. But I have some reason to  believe she will treat you well, as she promised, on account of  that particular esteem she professes for me. This you may have seen  by the respect shown, and the honours paid me by all her court. She  would be a fiendish creature indeed, if she should deceive me; but  she shall not deceive me unrevenged, for I know how to be even with  her.'    These assurances, which appeared very doubtful, were not sufficient  to raise King Beder's spirits. 'After all you have told me of this  queen's wickedness,' replied he, 'you cannot wonder if I am  somewhat fearful to approach her: I might, it may be, make little  of all you could tell me of her, did I not know by experience what  it is to be at the mercy of a sorceress. The condition I was in,  through the enchantment of the Princess Giauhara, and from whence I  was delivered only to enter almost immediately into another, has  made me look upon such a fate with horror.    'Son,' replied old Abdallah, 'do not afflict yourself; for though I  must own there is no great faith to be put in the promises and  oaths of so perfidious a queen, yet I must withal tell you that her  power extends not to me. She knows it well herself; and that is the  reason, and no other, that she pays me such great respect. I can  quickly hinder her from doing you the least harm, if she should be  perfidious enough to attempt it. You may depend upon me; and,  provided you follow exactly the advice I shall give you before I  hand you over to her, she shall have no more power over you than  she has over me.'    The magic queen did not fail to pass by the old man's shop the next  day, with the same pomp as the day before, and Abdallah waited for  her with "]]]
