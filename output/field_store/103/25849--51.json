If, as it is supposed, the four sons of Lehi married the  four daughters of Ishmael then there were nine families that formed  the colony. Ishmael, however, died during the colony's wanderings in  Arabia, and hence there were eight families that reached America in the  Nephite colony. (For above facts see I.

Compare  these several passages from Nephi with the statement in the text.    29. This may simply be the traditional remembrance of the fact that the  sign of the birth of Jesus was made an epoch from which the Nephites  thenceforward reckoned their time. See III. Nephi ii: 4-8.    30. \"Priests after the order of Quetzalcohuatl.\" The Book of Mormon  teaches that the Nephites had the high Melchizedek priesthood among  them. That is to say, the priesthood of their high priests was after  the same order of priesthood as that held by the son of God. Hence  we have Alma saying: \"I am called to speak after this manner [he was  preaching obedience to the people] according to the holy order of God,  which is in Christ Jesus. * * * * * And now I say unto you that this  is the order after which I am called, yea to preach unto my beloved  brethren.\" (Alma v: 44, 49). \"I would that ye should remember that the  Lord God ordained priests after his holy order, which was after the  order of his Son, to teach these things unto the people.\" (Alma xii:  1). The whole chapter deals with this subject of the priesthood, and  should be considered as part of the reference. Jesus when instructing  the twelve he had chosen from among the Nephites, said to them: \"Ye  shall be judges of this people according to the judgement which I shall  give unto you, which shall be just; therefore what manner of men ought  ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am.\" (III. Nephi xxvii:  27). It is fairly clear, that Jesus appointed priests after his own  order even as the traditions of the Mexicans teach that their deity  Quetzalcohuatl appointed priests after his own order. The coincident of  the tradition and the Nephite record is remarkable, and affords an item  of incidental evidence of considerable importance.    31. Compare this statement with the following passage: \"Behold, verily,  verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always, lest ye enter  into temptation. * * * * * Therefore ye must always pray unto the  Father in my name; and whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name,  which is right, believing that ye shall receive, behold it shall be  given unto you. Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my  name, that your wives and your children may be blessed.\" (III. Nephi  xviii: 12, 21).    32.

Readers of the Book of Mormon will find in this circumstance a  resemblance to the fact of Jesus granting to three of the twelve  disciples chosen from among the Nephites the privilege of remaining on  earth without tasting death until he should return in glory. And when  it is remembered that in granting this request to the three Nephites  Jesus coupled the name of John, the beloved disciple, in Judea, to whom  had been granted the same privilege (St. John xxi), sufficient ground  work was laid for the tradition of the \"four\" \"most virtuous youths\"  who were given a special mission by Quetzalcohuatl to his followers.  The incident concerning the three Nephite disciples and the mention of  John in connection with them will be found in III. Nephi xxviii.        CHAPTER XXXII    EXTERNAL EVIDENCES--THE HEBREW ORIGIN OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN  RACES--HEBREW RELICS.    I next call attention to the evidences of the Hebrew origin of the  native Americans, which origin, of course, if established beyond  reasonable doubt, will be one more item of evidence--one, too, of very  great weight in the volume of cumulative evidence here being compiled,  since the Hebrew origin of the native American races is fundamental  as testimony to the truth of the Book of Mormon. The Hebrew origin of  those races in our book is so unequivocally stated and so emphasized  that if the said American races could be proven beyond doubt to be of  other than Hebrew origin, the claims of the Book of Mormon would be  shattered.    The chief sources of information on this subject are the writings of  Gregoria Garcia, Edward King (Lord Kingsborough), and James Adair. The  first is a Spanish Dominican author, born about 1560; he died 1627. He  spent some twelve years in Central American countries as a missionary  among the natives, during which time he gathered his materials for his  chiefest work, \"Origin de los Indios.\" While contending for the theory  that the Indians are descendants of the Ten Tribes, Garcia collected  evidences on both sides of the question, though both his evidences and  arguments tend to prove the theory of Hebrew origin.    Lord Kingsborough was born in 1795, and died at Dublin in 1837. His  \"Antiquities of Mexico,\" ten volumes, imperial folio, were published in  London between 1830-48, consequently, since he died in 1837, some of  the volumes were issued after his death. His theory is that the Indians  are descendants of the Lost Tribes of Israel, and to the establishment  of this view he bends all his energies. He is open to the charge of  being over zealous for his theory, and doubtless has been somewhat  extravagant in his assumptions of proofs--in matters of detail, at  least; but, after all proper discount is made for the over-zeal of an  enthusiast--fanatic, if you will,--there remains a body of evidence  in his works for the Hebrew origin of native American races which has  never been successfully disposed of by those who dispute his theory.  Even Bancroft, who holds his theory in contempt, is forced to admit  that his \"enthusiasm is never offensive,\" and further says of him,  \"There is a scholarly dignity about his work which has never been  attained by those who have jeered and railed at him.\" [1]    Adair's work, \"History of the North American Indians,\" is included in  the eighth volume of Kingsborough's works. James Adair was an English  trader among the North American Indians from 1735 to 1775--forty years.  It was in 1775 that his work was published. His observations were  confined to the North American Indians; hence these three authors may  be said to cover the entire field of our investigation. I shall give  extracts from all these writers, making use of Bancroft's abridgment of  their works as being at once accurate and most accessible to the reader.    I.    _Garcia._    I begin with Garcia:        The opinion that the Americans are of Hebrew origin is supported by      similarities in character, dress, religion, physical peculiarities,      condition, and customs. The Americans are at heart cowardly, and      so are the Jews; the history of both nations proves this. The Jews      did not believe in the miracles of Christ, and for their unbelief      were scattered over the face of the earth, and despised of all      men; in like manner the people of the New World did not readily      receive the true faith as preached by Christ's Catholic disciples,      and are therefore persecuted and being rapidly exterminated.      Another analogy presents itself in the ingratitude of the Jews for      the many blessings and special favors bestowed on them by God.      * * * * * * Both Jews and Americans are noted for their want of      charity and kindness to the poor, sick and unfortunate; both are      naturally given to idolatry; many customs are common to both such      as raising the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59970"],[0,"The Life of Joseph Smith, the Prophet (#9)"],[1,"and sacrifice, to overcome perplexing difficulties and delays,  seemed necessary. In this way more than any other was he taught a  patient trust, and was sanctified for the exalted destiny which awaited  him. Though he had been instructed by Moroni that Jehovah designed  the record to be translated for the edification and blessing of the  race, he did not experience the direct interposition of God in the  accomplishment of the work--except only as the power of the Heavens  was manifested through the Urim and Thummim. And much he marveled  that the Lord should permit His holy purposes to depend upon weak and  slow-moving man. But the Prophet lived to learn and to demonstrate  that God commits His decrees to His earthly children for fulfilment;  and though he may often work miracles in their behalf, yet are they  required to give their best endeavor--even though weak and human--to  the appointed deed; and out of their trials, their stumblings, their  failures and their ultimate successes, will he bring the triumph of  their devotion and His word.    Joseph had leisure and safety, after establishing himself at the house  of Isaac Hale, in Harmony, Susquehanna County, State of Pennsylvania,  in the month of December, 1827, to examine the sacred history and  treasure which had been committed to his ward. And he very soon began  a somewhat desultory labor of copying the different styles of strange  characters found upon the plates and translating some of them by the  aid of the Urim and Thummim. He thus prepared a considerable number of  characters on sheets; some of them being accompanied by translations  and others being alone. It does not appear that he had any more  definite object in this superficial work than to seek, half-blindly, to  fulfill the command delivered by the lips of Moroni, the angel of the  record. But the purpose, wisely ordained, was latter apparent.    Joseph continued his efforts until some time in the month of February,  1828. Then the man, Martin Harris, who had once before befriended him,  appeared at the Hale homestead.    Martin Harris had been deeply affected by his former intercourse with  Joseph; and he had come in the depth of winter from his home near  Lake Ontario, to seek out the young Prophet and to learn more of his  wondrous mission. Harris tarried a brief time with Joseph at the house  of Isaac Hale; and then in this same month of February, 1828, with the  Prophet's permission, he carried away some of the various copies and  translations which Joseph, laboriously and patiently, had made. It was  the purpose of Martin Harris to submit the characters to scientists  and linguists; and possibly by their verdict to decide to establish or  withdraw his half-yielded faith. In pursuance of this plan, he went  to New York City, and there visited Charles Anthon, a professor of  languages at Columbia College.    Anthon examined first a sheet of characters accompanied by Joseph's  translation; and declared that the characters were Ancient Egyptian  and that the interpretation was correct--more complete and perfect  than any other translation of that language which he had ever seen. He  then looked at the other sheets, not accompanied by translations, and  pronounced the characters to be genuine specimens of various ancient  written languages. He wrote a certificate which embodied the foregoing  assertions and presented it to Martin Harris.    Afterward, Anthon made inquiry of Martin regarding the origin of  the characters; and then for the first time the learned professor  discovered what endorsement he had bestowed upon an unlearned youth who  had received from the hands of an angel a golden record filled with  these ancient writings. Anthon hastily demanded the certificate which  he had given to Harris; implying in his request that he wished to give  the paper a final examination or to add something to it. And as soon  as the professor received it again into his hands, he destroyed it,  saying: \"There is no such thing in these days as ministering of angels.\"    He asked that \"the book which the young man had dug up\" might be  brought to him; and stated that out of his worldly learning he would  translate the whole work. Harris replied that a considerable portion  of the record was sealed and might not be opened to human gaze. Then  Anthon contemptuously responded.    \"_I cannot read a sealed book_!\"    And thus was fulfilled the word of Isaiah who wrote twenty-six  centuries ago:    \"AND THE VISION OF ALL IS BECOME UNTO YOU AS THE WORDS OF A BOOK THAT  IS SEALED, WHICH MEN DELIVER TO ONE THAT IS LEARNED, SAYING, READ THIS,  I PRAY THEE: AND HE SAITH, I CANNOT; FOR IT IS SEALED.\"    When the conference with Professor Anthon was ended, Martin Harris  carried his manuscripts to one Doctor Mitchell, who claimed a knowledge  of some of the characters; and learning what Anthon had said concerning  their genuineness, the learned doctor endorsed the statements of the  other scholar.    Harris returned to the Prophet's home, fully convinced. This  man--generous, skeptical naturally, but honest--was seized upon by  the spirit of the work. When he met Joseph he related the convincing  occurrences of his visits to the learned men, and he proffered his  services as a writer for the Prophet, in the great work of translation.    The proposal was gladly accepted; and Martin proceeded to Palmyra to  arrange for a long absence from home. It was the 12th day of April,  1828, when he returned to Harmony, prepared to serve as a scribe.    From this time forward until the 14th day of June, 1828, Joseph  dictated to Martin Harris from the plates of gold; as the characters  thereon assumed through the Urim and Thummim the forms of equivalent  modern words which were familiar to the understanding of the youthful  Seer.    Martin Harris was a critical man without superstition. Listening to the  words dictated day by day, and becoming familiar with Joseph, he sought  to make another test.    One of Joseph's aids in searching out the truths of the record was a  peculiar pebble or rock, which he called also a seer stone, and which  was sometimes used by him in lieu of the Urim and Thummim. This stone  had been discovered to himself and his brother Hyrum at the bottom of  a well; and under divine guidance they had brought it forth for use  in the work of translation. Martin determined to deprive the Prophet  of this stone. He obtained a rock resembling a seer-stone in shape  and color, and slily substituted it for the Prophet's real medium of  translation. When next they were to begin their labor, Joseph was at  first silent; and then he exclaimed: \"Martin, what is the matter? All  is dark.\"    Harris with shame confessed what he had attempted. And when the Prophet  demanded a reason for such conduct, Martin replied: \"I did it to either  prove the utterance or stop the mouths of fools who have said to me  that you had learned these sentences which you dictate and that you  were merely repeating them from memory.\"    The work progressed through the two months from April until June;  not steadily, for Martin was much called away. But at the expiration  of that time, on the 14th day of June, 1828, Martin had written one  hundred and sixteen pages foolscap of the translation.    And at this hour came a test, bitter in its experiences and  consequences to the Prophet of God.    A woman wrought a betrayal of the confidence reposed in Martin Harris  and a temporary destruction of Joseph's power.    The wife of the scribe was desirous to see the writings dictated to  her husband by Joseph: she importuned Martin until he, too, became  anxious to have in his own possession the manuscript. Long before the  14th day of June, he began to solicit from the Prophet the privilege of  taking the papers away that he might show them to curious and skeptical  friends; and thereby be able to give convincing to doubting persons, of  Joseph's divine mission.    A simple denial was not sufficient, and he insisted that Jehovah should  be asked to thus favor him. Once, twice, in answer to his demands,  the Prophet inquired; and each time the reply was that Martin Harris  ought not to be entrusted with the sacred manuscript. Even a third time  Martin required that Joseph should solicit permission in his behalf;  and on this occasion, which was near the 14th day of June, 1828, the  word of the Lord came that Joseph, at his own peril, might allow Harris  to take possession of the manuscript and exhibit it to a few other  persons who were designated by the Prophet in his supplication. But  because of Joseph's wearying applications to God, the Urim and Thummim  and seer-stone were taken from him. Accordingly the precious manuscript  was entrusted to the keeping of Martin Harris; and he bound himself  by a solemn oath to show it only to his wife, his brother Preserved  Harris, his father and mother, and Mrs. Cobb, his wife's sister.  After entering into this sacred covenant, Martin Harris departed from  Harmony, carrying with him the inspired writings.    Then came about the punishment of Martin for his importunacy and  of Joseph for his blindness. Wicked people, through the vanity and  treachery of Martin's wife and his own weakness, gained sight of the  precious manuscript and they contrived to steal it away from Harris, so  that his eyes and the eyes of the Prophet never again beheld it.    For his disobedient pertinacity in voicing to the Lord the request  of Martin Harris, Joseph had been deprived of the Urim and Thummim  and seer-stone; but this was not his only punishment. The pages of  manuscript which contained the translation he had been inspired to  make, and which thereby became the words of God, had been loaned to  Martin Harris and been stolen; and now the plates themselves were taken  from him by the angel of the record.    The sorrow and humiliation which Joseph felt were beyond description.  The Lord's rebukes for his conduct "]]]
