We were presently rejoined by Colonel Menendez and Paul Harley, and I  gathered that my surmise that it had been their voices which I had heard  proceeding from the top of the tower to have been only partly accurate.    \"I know you will excuse me, Mr. Harley,\" said the Colonel, \"for  detailing the duty to Pedro, but my wind is not good enough for the  stairs.\"    He used idiomatic English at times with that facility which some  foreigners acquire, but always smiled in a self-satisfied way when he  had employed a slang term.    \"I quite understand, Colonel,\" replied Harley. \"The view from the top  was very fine.\"    \"And now, gentlemen,\" continued the Colonel, \"if Miss Beverley will  excuse us, we will retire to the library and discuss business.\"    \"As you wish,\" said Harley; \"but I have an idea that it is your custom  to rest in the afternoon.\"    Colonel Menendez shrugged his shoulders. \"It used to be,\" he admitted,  \"but I have too much to think about in these days.\"    \"I can see that you have much to tell me,\" admitted Harley; \"and  therefore I am entirely at your service.\"    Val Beverley smiled and walked away swinging her book, at the same time  treating me to a glance which puzzled me considerably. I wondered if I  had mistaken its significance, for it had seemed to imply that she had  accepted me as an ally. Certainly it served to awaken me to the fact  that I had discovered a keen personal interest in the mystery which hung  over this queerly assorted household.    I glanced at my friend as the Colonel led the way into the house. I  saw him staring upward with a peculiar expression upon his face, and  following the direction of his glance I could see an awning spread over  one of the gray-stone balconies. Beneath it, reclining in a long cane  chair, lay Madame de Staemer. I think she was asleep; at any rate,  she gave no sign, but lay there motionless, as Harley and I walked in  through the open French window followed by Colonel Menendez.    Odd and unimportant details sometimes linger long in the memory. And  I remember noticing that a needle of sunlight, piercing a crack in the  gaily-striped awning rested upon a ring which Madame wore, so that the  diamonds glittered like sparks of white-hot fire.          CHAPTER VI    THE BARRIER        Colonel Menendez conducted us to a long, lofty library in which might  be detected the same note of un-English luxury manifested in the other  appointments of the house. The room, in common with every other which  I had visited in Cray's Folly, was carried out in oak: doors, window  frames, mantelpiece, and ceiling representing fine examples of this  massive woodwork. Indeed, if the eccentricity of the designer of Cray's  Folly were not sufficiently demonstrated by the peculiar plan of the  building, its construction wholly of granite and oak must have remarked  him a man of unusual if substantial ideas.    There were four long windows opening on to a veranda which commanded a  view of part of the rose garden and of three terraced lawns descending  to a lake upon which I perceived a number of swans. Beyond, in the  valley, lay verdant pastures, where cattle grazed. A lark hung carolling  blithely far above, and the sky was almost cloudless. I could hear a  steam reaper at work somewhere in the distance. This, with the more  intimate rattle of a lawn-mower wielded by a gardener who was not  visible from where I stood, alone disturbed the serene silence, except  that presently I detected the droning of many bees among the roses.  Sunlight flooded the prospect; but the veranda lay in shadow, and that  long, oaken room was refreshingly cool and laden with the heavy perfume  of the flowers.    From the windows, then, one beheld a typical English summer-scape, but  the library itself struck an altogether more exotic note. There were  many glazed bookcases of a garish design in ebony and gilt, and these  were laden with a vast collection of works in almost every European  language, reflecting perhaps the cosmopolitan character of the colonel's  household. There was strange Spanish furniture upholstered in perforated  leather and again displaying much gilt. There were suits of black armour  and a great number of Moorish ornaments. The pictures were fine but  sombre, and all of the Spanish school.    One Velasquez in particular I noted with surprise, reflecting that,  assuming it to be an authentic work of the master, my entire worldly  possessions could not have enabled me to buy it. It was the portrait  of a typical Spanish cavalier and beyond doubt a Menendez. In fact, the  resemblance between the haughty Spanish grandee, who seemed about  to step out of the canvas and pick a quarrel with the spectator, and  Colonel Don Juan himself was almost startling. Evidently, our host had  imported most of his belongings from Cuba.    \"Gentlemen,\" he said, as we entered, \"make yourselves quite at home, I  beg. All my poor establishment contains is for your entertainment and  service.\"    He drew up two long, low lounge chairs, the arms provided with  receptacles to contain cooling drinks; and the mere sight of these  chairs mentally translated me to the Spanish Main, where I pictured them  set upon the veranda of that hacienda which had formerly been our host's  residence.    Harley and I became seated and Colonel Menendez disposed himself upon a  leather-covered couch, nodding apologetically as he did so.    \"My health requires that I should recline for a certain number of hours  every day,\" he explained. \"So you will please forgive me.\"    \"My dear Colonel Menendez,\" said Harley, \"I feel sure that you are  interrupting your siesta in order to discuss the unpleasant business  which finds us in such pleasant surroundings. Allow me once again to  suggest that we postpone this matter until, shall we say, after dinner?\"    \"No, no! No, no,\" protested the Colonel, waving his hand deprecatingly.  \"Here is Pedro with coffee and some curacao of a kind which I can really  recommend, although you may be unfamiliar with it.\"    I was certainly unfamiliar with the liqueur which he insisted we must  taste, and which was contained in a sort of square, opaque bottle  unknown, I think, to English wine merchants. Beyond doubt it was potent  stuff; and some cigars which the Spaniard produced on this occasion and  which were enclosed in little glass cylinders resembling test-tubes and  elaborately sealed, I recognized to be priceless. They convinced me, if  conviction had not visited me already, that Colonel Don Juan Sarmiento  Menendez belonged to that old school of West Indian planters by whom  the tradition of the Golden Americas had been for long preserved in the  Spanish Main.    We discussed indifferent matters for a while, sipping this wonderful  curacao of our host's. The effect created by the Colonel's story faded  entirely, and when, the latter being unable to conceal his drowsiness,  Harley stood up, I took the hint with gratitude; for at that moment I  did not feel in the mood to discuss serious business or indeed business  of any kind.    \"Gentlemen,\" said the Colonel, also rising, in spite of our protests, \"I  will observe your wishes. My guests' wishes are mine. We will meet the  ladies for tea on the terrace.\"    Harley and I walked out into the garden together, our courteous host  standing in the open window, and bowing in that exaggerated fashion  which in another might have been ridiculous but which was possible in  Colonel Menendez, because of the peculiar grace of deportment which was  his.    As we descended the steps I turned and glanced back, I know not why. But  the impression which I derived of the Colonel's face as he stood there  in the shadow of the veranda was one I can never forget.    His expression had changed utterly, or so it seemed to me. He no longer  resembled Velasquez' haughty cavalier; gone, too, was the debonnaire  bearing, I turned my head aside swiftly, hoping that he had not detected  my backward glance.    I felt that I had violated hospitality. I felt that I had seen what I  should not have seen. And the result was to bring about that which no  story of West Indian magic could ever have wrought in my mind.    A dreadful, cold premonition claimed me, a premonition that this was a  doomed man.    The look which I had detected upon his face was an indefinable, an  indescribable look; but I had seen it in the eyes of one who had been  bitten by a poisonous reptile and who knew his hours to be numbered. It  was uncanny, unnerving; and whereas at first the atmosphere of Colonel  Menendez's home had seemed to be laden with prosperous security, now  that sense of ease and restfulness was gone--and gone for ever.    \"Harley,\" I said, speaking almost at random, \"this promises to be the  strangest case you have ever handled.\"    \"Promises?\" Paul Harley laughed shortly. \"It _is_ the strangest case,  Knox. It is a case of wheels within wheels, of mystery crowning mystery.  Have you studied our host?\"    \"Closely.\"    \"And what conclusion have you formed?\"    \"None at the moment; but I think one is slowly crystalizing.\"    \"Hm,\" muttered Harley, as we paced slowly on amid the rose trees. \"Of  one thing I am satisfied.\"    \"What is that?\"    \"That Colonel Menendez is not afraid of Bat Wing, whoever or whatever  Bat Wing may be.\"    \"Not afraid?\"    \"Certainly he is not afraid, Knox. He has possibly been afraid in the  past, but now he is resigned.\"    \"Resigned to what?\"    \"Resigned to death!\"    \"Good God, Harley, you are right!\" I cried. \"You are right! I saw it in  his eyes as we left the library.\"    Harley stopped and turned to me sharply.    \"You saw this in the Colonel's eyes?\" he challenged.    \"I did.\"    \"Which corroborates my theory,\" he said, softly; \"for _I_ had seen it  elsewhere.\"    \"Where do you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/64"],[0,"The Gods of Mars (#9)"],[1," that aroused me once more to the realities  of life.  For a moment I could neither place my surroundings nor locate  the sounds which had aroused me.  And then from beyond the blank wall  beside which I lay I heard the shuffling of feet, the snarling of grim  beasts, the clank of metal accoutrements, and the heavy breathing of a  man.    As I rose to my feet I glanced hurriedly about the chamber in which I  had just encountered such a warm reception.  The prisoners and the  savage brutes rested in their chains by the opposite wall eyeing me  with varying expressions of curiosity, sullen rage, surprise, and hope.    The latter emotion seemed plainly evident upon the handsome and  intelligent face of the young red Martian woman whose cry of warning  had been instrumental in saving my life.    She was the perfect type of that remarkably beautiful race whose  outward appearance is identical with the more god-like races of Earth  men, except that this higher race of Martians is of a light reddish  copper colour.  As she was entirely unadorned I could not even guess  her station in life, though it was evident that she was either a  prisoner or slave in her present environment.    It was several seconds before the sounds upon the opposite side of the  partition jolted my slowly returning faculties into a realization of  their probable import, and then of a sudden I grasped the fact that  they were caused by Tars Tarkas in what was evidently a desperate  struggle with wild beasts or savage men.    With a cry of encouragement I threw my weight against the secret door,  but as well have assayed the down-hurling of the cliffs themselves.  Then I sought feverishly for the secret of the revolving panel, but my  search was fruitless, and I was about to raise my longsword against the  sullen gold when the young woman prisoner called out to me.    \"Save thy sword, O Mighty Warrior, for thou shalt need it more where it  will avail to some purpose--shatter it not against senseless metal  which yields better to the lightest finger touch of one who knows its  secret.\"    \"Know you the secret of it then?\" I asked.    \"Yes; release me and I will give you entrance to the other horror  chamber, if you wish.  The keys to my fetters are upon the first dead  of thy foemen.  But why would you return to face again the fierce  banth, or whatever other form of destruction they have loosed within  that awful trap?\"    \"Because my friend fights there alone,\" I answered, as I hastily sought  and found the keys upon the carcass of the dead custodian of this grim  chamber of horrors.    There were many keys upon the oval ring, but the fair Martian maid  quickly selected that which sprung the great lock at her waist, and  freed she hurried toward the secret panel.    Again she sought out a key upon the ring.  This time a slender,  needle-like affair which she inserted in an almost invisible hole in  the wall.  Instantly the door swung upon its pivot, and the contiguous  section of the floor upon which I was standing carried me with it into  the chamber where Tars Tarkas fought.    The great Thark stood with his back against an angle of the walls,  while facing him in a semi-circle a half-dozen huge monsters crouched  waiting for an opening.  Their blood-streaked heads and shoulders  testified to the cause of their wariness as well as to the  swordsmanship of the green warrior whose glossy hide bore the same mute  but eloquent witness to the ferocity of the attacks that he had so far  withstood.    Sharp talons and cruel fangs had torn leg, arm, and breast literally to  ribbons.  So weak was he from continued exertion and loss of blood that  but for the supporting wall I doubt that he even could have stood  erect.  But with the tenacity and indomitable courage of his kind he  still faced his cruel and relentless foes--the personification of that  ancient proverb of his tribe: \"Leave to a Thark his head and one hand  and he may yet conquer.\"    As he saw me enter, a grim smile touched those grim lips of his, but  whether the smile signified relief or merely amusement at the sight of  my own bloody and dishevelled condition I do not know.    As I was about to spring into the conflict with my sharp long-sword I  felt a gentle hand upon my shoulder and turning found, to my surprise,  that the young woman had followed me into the chamber.    \"Wait,\" she whispered, \"leave them to me,\" and pushing me advanced, all  defenceless and unarmed, upon the snarling banths.    When quite close to them she spoke a single Martian word in low but  peremptory tones.  Like lightning the great beasts wheeled upon her,  and I looked to see her torn to pieces before I could reach her side,  but instead the creatures slunk to her feet like puppies that expect a  merited whipping.    Again she spoke to them, but in tones so low I could not catch the  words, and then she started toward the opposite side of the chamber  with the six mighty monsters trailing at heel.  One by one she sent  them through the secret panel into the room beyond, and when the last  had passed from the chamber where we stood in wide-eyed amazement she  turned and smiled at us and then herself passed through, leaving us  alone.    For a moment neither of us spoke.  Then Tars Tarkas said:    \"I heard the fighting beyond the partition through which you passed,  but I did not fear for you, John Carter, until I heard the report of a  revolver shot.  I knew that there lived no man upon all Barsoom who  could face you with naked steel and live, but the shot stripped the  last vestige of hope from me, since you I knew to be without firearms.  Tell me of it.\"    I did as he bade, and then together we sought the secret panel through  which I had just entered the apartment--the one at the opposite end of  the room from that through which the girl had led her savage companions.    To our disappointment the panel eluded our every effort to negotiate  its secret lock.  We felt that once beyond it we might look with some  little hope of success for a passage to the outside world.    The fact that the prisoners within were securely chained led us to  believe that surely there must be an avenue of escape from the terrible  creatures which inhabited this unspeakable place.    Again and again we turned from one door to another, from the baffling  golden panel at one end of the chamber to its mate at the  other--equally baffling.    When we had about given up all hope one of the panels turned silently  toward us, and the young woman who had led away the banths stood once  more beside us.    \"Who are you?\" she asked, \"and what your mission, that you have the  temerity to attempt to escape from the Valley Dor and the death you  have chosen?\"    \"I have chosen no death, maiden,\" I replied.  \"I am not of Barsoom, nor  have I taken yet the voluntary pilgrimage upon the River Iss.  My  friend here is Jeddak of all the Tharks, and though he has not yet  expressed a desire to return to the living world, I am taking him with  me from the living lie that hath lured him to this frightful place.    \"I am of another world.  I am John Carter, Prince of the House of  Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium.  Perchance some faint rumour of me may  have leaked within the confines of your hellish abode.\"    She smiled.    \"Yes,\" she replied, \"naught that passes in the world we have left is  unknown here.  I have heard of you, many years ago.  The therns have  ofttimes wondered whither you had flown, since you had neither taken  the pilgrimage, nor could be found upon the face of Barsoom.\"    \"Tell me,\" I said, \"and who be you, and why a prisoner, yet with power  over the ferocious beasts of the place that denotes familiarity and  authority far beyond that which might be expected of a prisoner or a  slave?\"    \"Slave I am,\" she answered.  \"For fifteen years a slave in this  terrible place, and now that they have tired of me and become fearful  of the power which my knowledge of their ways has given me I am but  recently condemned to die the death.\"    She shuddered.    \"What death?\" I asked.    \"The Holy Therns eat human flesh,\" she answered me; \"but only that  which has died beneath the sucking lips of a plant man--flesh from  which the defiling blood of life has been drawn.  And to this cruel end  I have been condemned.  It was to be within a few hours, had your  advent not caused an interruption of their plans.\"    \"Was it then Holy Therns who felt the weight of John Carter's hand?\" I  asked.    \"Oh, no; those whom you laid low are lesser therns; but of the same  cruel and hateful race.  The Holy Therns abide upon the outer slopes of  these grim hills, facing the broad world from which they harvest their  victims and their spoils.    \"Labyrinthine passages connect these caves with the luxurious palaces  of the Holy Therns, and through them pass upon their many duties the  lesser therns, and hordes of slaves, and prisoners, and fierce beasts;  the grim inhabitants of this sunless world.    \"There be within this vast network of winding passages and countless  chambers men, women, and beasts who, born within its dim and gruesome  underworld, have never seen the light of day--nor ever shall.    \"They are kept to do the bidding of the race of therns; to furnish at  once their sport and their sustenance.    \"Now and again some hapless pilgrim, drifting out upon the silent sea  from the cold Iss, escapes the plant men and the great white apes that  guard the Temple of Issus and falls into the remorseless clutches of  the therns; or, as was my misfortune, is coveted by the Holy Thern who  chances to be upon watch in the balcony above the river where it issues  from the bowels of the mountains through the cliffs of gold to empty  into the Lost Sea of Korus.    \"All who reach the Valley Dor are, by custom, the rightful prey of the  plant men and the apes, while their arms and ornaments become the  portion of the therns; but if one escapes the terrible"]]]
