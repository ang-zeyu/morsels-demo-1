But  he who is truly in the right state, is so in all circumstances, and  among all persons; he who is not in a good state, it is not right  with him in all places and among all persons. He who is as he should  be has God with him in truth, in all places and among all persons,  in the street as well as in the church; and then no man can hinder  him. (547)    It is often much harder for a man to be alone in a crowd than in the  desert; and it is often harder to leave a small thing than a great,  and to practise a small work than one which people consider very  great. (565)    PRAYER    GOOD and earnest prayer is a golden ladder which reaches up to  heaven, and by which man ascends to God.    The man who will pray aright should ask for nothing except what may  promote God's honour and glory, his own profit and the advantage of  his neighbours. When we ask for temporal things we should always  add, if it be God's will and if it be for my soul's health. But when  we pray for virtues, we need add no qualification, for these are  God's own working. (359)    LOVE OF OUR NEIGHBOUR    IT is a hard thing to practise this universal love, and to love our  neighbours as ourselves, as our Lord commanded us. But if you will  understand it rightly, there is a greater reward attached to this  command, than to any other. The commandment seems hard, but the  reward is precious indeed. (135)    LOVE    HE who has found this way of love, seeketh no other. He who turns on  this pivot is in such wise a prisoner that his foot and hand and  mouth and eyes and heart, and all his human faculties, belong to  God. And, therefore, thou canst overcome thy flesh in no better way,  so that it may not shame thee, than by love. This is why it is  written, Love is as strong as death, as hard as hell. Death  separates the soul from the body, but love separates all things from  the soul. She suffers nought to come near her, that is not God nor  God-like. Happy is he who is thus imprisoned; the more thou art a  prisoner, the more wilt thou be freed. That we may be so imprisoned,  and so freed, may He help us, Who Himself is Love. (30)    THE UNION WITH GOD    THE union of the soul with God is far more inward than that of the  soul and body. (566)    Now I might ask, how stands it with the soul that is lost in God?  Does the soul find herself or not? To this will I answer as it  appears to me, that the soul finds herself in the point, where every  rational being understands itself with itself. Although it sinks and  sinks in the eternity of the Divine Essence, yet it can never reach  the ground. Therefore God has left a little point wherein the soul  turns back upon itself and finds itself, and knows itself to be a  creature. (387)    God alone must work in thee without hindrance, that He may bring to  perfection His likeness in thee. So thou mayest understand with Him,  and love with Him. This is the essence of perfection. (471)    THE LAST JUDGMENT    PEOPLE say of the last day, that God shall give judgment. This is  true. But it is not true as people imagine. Every man pronounces his  own sentence; as he shows himself here in his essence, so will he  remain everlastingly. (471)    PRECEPT AND PRACTICE    BETTER one life-master than a thousand reading-masters (wger wre  ein lebemeister denne tûsent lesemeister). If I sought a master  in the scriptures, I should seek him in Paris and in the high  schools of high learning. But if I wished to ask questions about the  perfect life, that he could not tell me. Where then must I go?  Nowhere at all save to an utterly simple nature; he could answer my  question. (599)    RELICS    MY people, why seek ye after dead bones? Why seek ye not after  living holiness, which might give you everlasting life? The dead can  neither give nor take away. (599)    SAYINGS OF ECKHART    MASTER ECKHART saith: He who is always alone, he is worthy of God;  and he who is always at home, to him is God present; and be who  abides always in a present now, in him doth God beget His Son  without ceasing. (600)    Master Eckhart saith: I will never pray to God to give Himself to  me: I will pray Him to make me purer. If I were purer, God must give  Himself to me, of His own nature, and sink into me. (601)    Master Eckhart was asked, what were the greatest goods, that God had  done to him. He said, there are three. The first is, that the lusts  and desires of the flesh have been taken away from me. The second  is, that the Divine Light shines and gives me light in all my  doings. The third is, that I am daily renewed in virtue, grace and  holiness. (602)              TAULER            OUR AIM    THINK, and think earnestly, how great, how unutterable will be the  joy and blessedness, the glory and honour of those who shall see  clearly and without veil the gladsome and beauteous face of God, how  they will enjoy the best and highest good, which is God Himself. For  in Him is included all pleasure, might, joy, and all beauty, so that  the blessed in God will possess everything that is good and  desirable, with everlasting joy and security, without fear lest they  should ever be parted from Him. (138)[38]    CONSEQUENCES OF THE FALL    FROM the time when the first man gave a ready ear to the words of  the enemy, mankind have been deaf, so that none of us can hear or  understand the loving utterances of the eternal Word. Something has  happened to the ears of man, which has stopped up his ears, so that  he cannot hear the loving Word; and he has also been so blinded,  that he has become stupid, and does not know himself. If he wished  to speak of his own inner life, he could not do it; he knows not  where he is, nor what is his state. (91)    How can it be that the noble reason, the inner eye, is so blinded  that it cannot see the true light? This great shame has come about,  because a thick coarse skin and a thick fur has been drawn over him,  even the love and the opinion of the creatures, whether it be the  man himself or something that belongs to him; hence man has become  blind and deaf, in whatever position he may be, worldly or  spiritual. Yes, that is his guilt, that many a thick skin is drawn  over him, as thick as an ox's forehead, and it has so covered up his  inner man, that neither God nor himself can get inside; it has grown  into him. (92)    THE FALL    THROUGH two things man fell in Paradise--through pride, and through  inordinate affection. Therefore we too must return by two things,  that nature may recover her power: we must first sink our nature and  bring it down under God and under all men in deep humility, against  whom it had exalted itself in pride. We must also manfully die to  all inordinate lusts. (1)    LIFE A BATTLE    NOTHING in the world is so necessary for man as to be constantly  assailed; for in fighting he learns to know himself. As grace is  necessary to a man, so also is fighting. Virtue begins in fighting,  and is developed in fighting. In every state to which a man is  called, inward and outward, he must of necessity be assailed. A high  Master said: As little as meat can remain without salt and yet not  become corrupt, so little can a man remain without fighting. (104)    A man should in the first place act as when a town is besieged, and  it is certain that the besieging army is stronger than the town.  When the town is weakest, men take the very greatest care to guard  and defend the town; if they neglected to do so, they would lose the  town, and with it their lives and properties. So should every man  do: he should be most careful to find out in what things the evil  spirit most often besets him--that is, on what side the man is  weakest, and to what kind of errors and failings he is most prone,  and should manfully defend himself at those points.    Next, turn thyself earnestly away from sin; for I tell you of a  truth, by whatever temptation a man is assailed, if he turns not  from it heartily, but stands in it vacillating, he has no  wholehearted desire to leave his sins by God's will, and without  doubt the evil spirit is close upon him, who may make him fall into  endless perdition.    Know of a truth, that if thou wouldst truly overcome the evil  spirit, this can only be done by a complete manful turning away from  sin. Say then with all thy heart: Oh, everlasting God, help me and  give me Thy Divine grace to be my help, for it is my steadfast  desire never again to commit any deadly sin against Thy Divine will  and Thine honour. So with thy good will and intention thou entirely  overcomest the evil spirit, so that he must fly from thee ashamed.    Understand, however, that it is a miserable and pitiable thing for a  reasonable man to let himself be overcome by the evil spirit, and in  consequence of his attacks to fall voluntarily into grievous and  deadly sin, whereby man loses the grace of God. A reasonable man,  who allows himself voluntarily to be overcome by the evil spirit, is  like a well-armed man who voluntarily lets a fly bite him to death.  For man has many great and strong weapons, wherewith he may well and  manfully withstand the evil spirit--the holy faith, the blessed  sacrament, the holy word of God, the model and example of all good  and holy men, the prayers of holy Church, and other great supports  against the power of the evil spirit, whose power is much less than  that of a fly against a great bear. If a man will manfully and  boldly withstand the evil spirit, the evil one can gain no advantage  against his free will.    Turn, therefore, manfully and earnestly from your sins, and watch  diligently and earnestly; for I tell you of a truth, that when you  have come to the next world, if you have not withstood the evil  spirit, and if you are found there without repentance and sorrow,  you will be a mockery to all the devils and to yourself, and you  will be eternally punished and tormented.

One day he  told me that he knew a girl just out of the place who was subject to  fits, and wanted to know if I could do anything for her; that her father  was rich and would pay a good price to have her cured. I went to see the  girl and did at least enough to earn a fee of one hundred dollars,  which her father gladly paid me. Benson also introduced me to some other  people whom I found profitable patients. I thought he was a very good  friend to me, but he was a cool, calculating rascal. He meant to rob me  of my horse and buggy, and went deliberately to work about it. First, he  issued the handbill which caused my arrest in Troy, where he knew I was  going. Next, as appeared when he came up to Troy to prosecute the suit  against me, he forged a bill of sale. The case was tried and decided  in my favor. Benson appealed, and again it was decided that the horse  belonged to me. I then had him indicted for perjury and forgery, and he  was put under bonds of fourteen hundred dollars in each case to appear  for trial. Some how or other he never appeared, and whether he forfeited  his bonds, or otherwise slipped through the \"meshes of the law,\" I never  learned, nor have I ever seen him since he attempted to swindle me.  But these proceedings kept me in Troy more than a month, and to pay  my lawyer and other expenses, I actually sold the horse and buggy the  scoundrel tried to steal from me.    Taking my boy to Sidney and putting him under the care of my half  sister, I went to Boston, where I met two friends of mine who were  about going to Meredith Bridge, N.H., to fish through the ice on Lake  Winnipiseogee. It was early in January, 1853, and good, clear, cold  weather. They represented the sport to be capital, and said that plenty  of superb lake trout and pickerel could be taken every day, and urged me  to go with them. As I had nothing special to do for a few days, I went.  When we reached Meredith we stopped at a tavern near the lake, kept by  one of the oddest landlords I have ever met. After a good supper, as  we were sitting in the barroom, the landlord came up to me and at once  opened conversation in the following manner:    \"Waal, where do you come from, anyhow?\"    \"From Boston,\" I replied.    \"Waal, what be you, anyhow?\"    \"Well, I practice medicine, and take care of the sick.\"    \"Dew ye? Waal, do ye ever cure anybody?\"    \"O, sometimes; quite frequently, in fact.\"    \"Dew ye! waal, there's a woman up here to Lake Village, 'Squire  Blaisdell's wife, who has had the dropsy more'n twelve years; been  filling' all the time till they tell me she's bigger'n a hogshead now,  and she's had a hundred doctors, and the more doctors she has the bigger  she gets; what d' ye think of that now?\"    I answered that I thought it was quite likely, and then turned away  from the landlord to talk to my friends about our proposed sport for  to-morrow, mentally making note of 'Squire Blaisdell's wife in Lake  Village.    After breakfast next morning we went out on the lake, cut holes in the  ice, set our lines, and before dinner we had taken several fine trout  and pickerel, the largest and finest of which we put into a box with  ice, and sent as a present to President Pierce, in Washington. We had  agreed, the night before, to fish for him the first day, and to send  him the best specimens we could from his native state. After dinner my  friends started to go out on the ice again, and I told them \"I guess'd I  wouldn't go with them, I had fished enough for that day.\" They insisted  I should go, but I told them I preferred to take a walk and explore the  country. So they went to the lake and I walked up to Lake Village.    I soon found Mr. Blaisdell's house, and as the servant who came to the  door informed me that Mr. Blaisdell was not at home, I asked to see  Mrs. Blaisdell, And was shown in to that lady. She was not quite the  \"hogshead\" the landlord declared her to be, but she was one of the worst  cases of dropsy I had ever seen. I introduced myself to her, told her my  profession, and that I had called upon her in the hope of being able to  afford her some relief; that I wanted nothing for my services unless I  could really benefit her.    \"O, Doctor,\" said she, \"you can do nothing for me; in the past twelve  years I have had at least forty different doctors, and none of them have  helped me.\"    \"But there can be no harm in trying the forty-first;\" and as I said  it I took from my vest pocket and held out in the palm of my hand some  pills:    \"Here, madame, are some pills made from a simple blossom, which cannot  possibly harm you, and which, I am sure, will do you a great deal of  good.\"    \"O, Mary!\" she exclaimed to her niece, who was in attendance upon her,  \"this is my dream! I dreamed last night that my father appeared to me  and told me that a stranger would come with a blossom in his hand; that  he would offer it to me, and that if I would take it I should recover.  Go and get a glass of water and I will take these pills at once.\"    \"Surely,\" said Mary, \"you are not going to take this stranger's medicine  without knowing anything about it, or him?\"    \"I am indeed; go and get the water.\"    She took the medicine and then told me that her father, who had died two  years ago, was a physician, and had carefully attended to her case as  long as he lived; but that she had a will of her own, and had sent far  and near for other doctors, though with no good result.    \"You have come to me,\" she continued, \"and although I am not  superstitious, your coming with a blossom in your hand, figuratively  speaking, is so exactly in accordance with my dream, that I am going to  put myself under your care.\"    She then asked me if I lived in the neighborhood, and I told her no;  that I had merely come up from Boston with two friends to try a few  days' fishing through the ice on the lake.    \"You can fish to better purpose here, I think,\" she said; \"you can get  plenty of practice in the villages and farm houses about here: at any  rate, stay for the present and undertake my case, and I will pay you  liberally.\"    I went back to Meredith Bridge--I believe it is now called Laconia--and  had another day's fishing with my friends. When they were ready to pack  up and return to Boston, I astonished them by informing them that I  should stay where I was for the present, perhaps for months, and that I  believed I could find a good practice in Meredith and adjoining places.  So they left me and I went to Lake Village, and made that pleasant place  my headquarters.    The weeks wore on, and if Mrs. Blaisdell was a hogshead, as the Meredith  landlord said, when I first saw her, she soon became a barrel under my  treatment, and in four months she was entirely cured, and was as sound  as any woman in the State. I had as much other business too as I could  attend to, and was very busy and happy all the time.    In May I went to Exeter, alternating between there and Portsmouth, and  finding enough to do till the end of July. While I was in Portsmouth  on one of my last visits to that place, I received a call from a  sea-captain by the name of Brown, who told me that he had heard of my  success in dropsical cases, and that I must go to Newark, N. J., and  see his daughter. \"Pay,\" he said, \"was no object; I must go.\" I told him  that I had early finished my business in that vicinity, and that when I  went to New York, as I proposed to do shortly, I would go over to  Newark and see his daughter. A few days afterward, when I had settled my  business and collected my bills in Portsmouth and Exeter, I went to New  York, and from there to Newark.        CHAPTER VII. WEDDING A WIDOW, AND THE CONSEQUENCES.    I MARRY A WIDOW--SIX WEEKS OF HAPPINESS--CONFIDING A SECRET AND THE  CONSEQUENCES--THE WIDOW'S BROTHER--SUDDEN FLIGHT FROM NEWARK--IN  HARTFORD, CONN.--MY WIFE'S SISTER BETRAYS ME--TRIAL FOR  BIGAMY--SENTENCED TO TEN YEARS IMPRISONMENT--I BECOME A \"BOBBIN BOY\"--A  GOOD FRIEND--GOVERNOR PRICE VISITS ME IN PRISON--HE PARDONS ME--TEN  YEARS' SENTENCE FULFILLED IN SEVEN MONTHS.        Why in the world did Captain Brown ever tempt me with the prospect of  a profitable patient in Newark? I had no thought of going to that city,  and no business there except to see if I could cure Captain Brown's  daughter. With my matrimonial monomania it was like putting my hand into  the fire to go to a fresh place, where I should see fresh faces, and  where fresh temptations would beset me. And when I went to Newark, I  went only as I supposed, to see a single patient; but Captain Brown  prevailed upon me to stay to take care of his daughter, and assured me  that he and his friends would secure me a good practice. They did. In  two months I was doing as well in my profession as I had ever done in  any place where I had located. I might have attended strictly to my  business, and in a few years have acquired a handsome competence. But,  as ill luck, which, strangely enough, I then considered good luck, would  have it, when I had been in Newark some two months, I became acquainted  with a buxom, good-looking widow, Mrs. Elizabeth Roberts. I protest  to-day that she courted me--not I her. She was fair, fascinating, and  had a goodly share of property. I fell into the snare. She said she was  lonely; she sighed; she smiled, and I was lost.    Would that I had observed the elder Weller's injunction: \"Bevare of  vidders;\" would that I had never seen the Widow Roberts, or rather that  she had never seen me. Eight weeks after we first met we were married.  We had a great wedding in her own house, and all her friends were  present. I was in good practice with as many patients as I could attend  to; she had a good home and we settled down to be very happy.    For six weeks, only six weeks, I think we were so. We might have been  so for six weeks, six months, six years longer; but alas! I was "]]]
