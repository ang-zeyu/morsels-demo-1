For he desired to  find some pretext for war against the Dryopians for their bane, since  they dwelt there reckless of right. But these tales would lead me far  astray from my song. And quickly Hylas came to the spring which the  people who dwell thereabouts call Pegae. And the dances of the nymphs  were just now being held there; for it was the care of all the nymphs  that haunted that lovely headland ever to hymn Artemis in songs by  night. All who held the mountain peaks or glens, all they were ranged  far off guarding the woods; but one, a water-nymph was just rising from  the fair-flowing spring; and the boy she perceived close at hand with  the rosy flush of his beauty and sweet grace. For the full moon beaming  from the sky smote him. And Cypris made her heart faint, and in her  confusion she could scarcely gather her spirit back to her. But as soon  as he dipped the pitcher in the stream, leaning to one side, and the  brimming water rang loud as it poured against the sounding bronze,  straightway she laid her left arm above upon his neck yearning to kiss  his tender mouth; and with her right hand she drew down his elbow, and  plunged him into the midst of the eddy.    (ll. 1240-1256) Alone of his comrades the hero Polyphemus, son of  Eilatus, as he went forward on the path, heard the boy's cry, for he  expected the return of mighty Heracles. And he rushed after the cry,  near Pegae, like some beast of the wild wood whom the bleating of sheep  has reached from afar, and burning with hunger he follows, but does not  fall in with the flocks; for the shepherds beforehand have penned them  in the fold, but he groans and roars vehemently until he is weary.  Thus vehemently at that time did the son of Eilatus groan and wandered  shouting round the spot; and his voice rang piteous. Then quickly  drawing his great sword he started in pursuit, in fear lest the boy  should be the prey of wild beasts, or men should have lain in ambush for  him faring all alone, and be carrying him off, an easy prey. Hereupon as  he brandished his bare sword in his hand he met Heracles himself on  the path, and well he knew him as he hastened to the ship through the  darkness. And straightway he told the wretched calamity while his heart  laboured with his panting breath.    (ll. 1257-1260) \"My poor friend, I shall be the first to bring thee  tidings of bitter woe. Hylas has gone to the well and has not returned  safe, but robbers have attacked and are carrying him off, or beasts are  tearing him to pieces; I heard his cry.\"    (ll. 1261-1272) Thus he spake; and when Heracles heard his words, sweat  in abundance poured down from his temples and the black blood boiled  beneath his heart. And in wrath he hurled the pine to the ground and  hurried along the path whither his feet bore on his impetuous soul. And  as when a bull stung by a gadfly tears along, leaving the meadows and  the marsh land, and recks not of herdsmen or herd, but presses on, now  without cheek, now standing still, and raising his broad neck he bellows  loudly, stung by the maddening fly; so he in his frenzy now would ply  his swift knees unresting, now again would cease from toil and shout  afar with loud pealing cry.    (ll. 1273-1289) But straightway the morning star rose above the topmost  peaks and the breeze swept down; and quickly did Tiphys urge them to  go aboard and avail themselves of the wind. And they embarked eagerly  forthwith; and they drew up the ship's anchors and hauled the ropes  astern. And the sails were bellied out by the wind, and far from the  coast were they joyfully borne past the Posideian headland. But at the  hour when gladsome dawn shines from heaven, rising from the east, and  the paths stand out clearly, and the dewy plains shine with a bright  gleam, then at length they were aware that unwittingly they had  abandoned those men. And a fierce quarrel fell upon them, and violent  tumult, for that they had sailed and left behind the bravest of their  comrades. And Aeson's son, bewildered by their hapless plight, said  never a word, good or bad; but sat with his heavy load of grief, eating  out his heart. And wrath seized Telamon, and thus he spake:    (ll. 1290-1295) \"Sit there at thy ease, for it was fitting for thee to  leave Heracles behind; from thee the project arose, so that his glory  throughout Hellas should not overshadow thee, if so be that heaven  grants us a return home. But what pleasure is there in words? For I will  go, I only, with none of thy comrades, who have helped thee to plan this  treachery.\"    (ll. 1296-1314) He spake, and rushed upon Tiphys son of Hagnias; and  his eyes sparkled like flashes of ravening flame. And they would quickly  have turned back to the land of the Mysians, forcing their way through  the deep sea and the unceasing blasts of the wind, had not the two sons  of Thracian Boreas held back the son of Aeacus with harsh words. Hapless  ones, assuredly a bitter vengeance came upon them thereafter at the  hands of Heracles, because they stayed the search for him. For when they  were returning from the games over Pelias dead he slew them in sea-girt  Tenos and heaped the earth round them, and placed two columns above,  one of which, a great marvel for men to see, moves at the breath of  the blustering north wind. These things were thus to be accomplished in  after times. But to them appeared Glaucus from the depths of the sea,  the wise interpreter of divine Nereus, and raising aloft his shaggy head  and chest from his waist below, with sturdy hand he seized the ship's  keel, and then cried to the eager crew:    (ll. 1315-1325) \"Why against the counsel of mighty Zeus do ye purpose  to lead bold Heracles to the city of Aeetes? At Argos it is his fate to  labour for insolent Eurystheus and to accomplish full twelve toils and  dwell with the immortals, if so be that he bring to fulfilment a few  more yet; wherefore let there be no vain regret for him. Likewise it is  destined for Polyphemus to found a glorious city at the mouth of Cius  among the Mysians and to fill up the measure of his fate in the vast  land of the Chalybes. But a goddess-nymph through love has made Hylas  her husband, on whose account those two wandered and were left behind.\"    (ll. 1326-1331) He spake, and with a plunge wrapped him about with the  restless wave; and round him the dark water foamed in seething eddies  and dashed against the hollow ship as it moved through the sea. And the  heroes rejoiced, and Telamon son of Aeacus came in haste to Jason, and  grasping his hand in his own embraced him with these words:    (ll. 1332-1335) \"Son of Aeson, be not wroth with me, if in my folly  I have erred, for grief wrought upon me to utter a word arrogant and  intolerable. But let me give my fault to the winds and let our hearts be  joined as before.\"    (ll. 1336-1343) Him the son of Aeson with prudence addressed: \"Good  friend, assuredly with an evil word didst thou revile me, saying before  them all that I was the wronger of a kindly man. But not for long will  I nurse bitter wrath, though indeed before I was grieved. For it was not  for flocks of sheep, no, nor for possessions that thou wast angered  to fury, but for a man, thy comrade. And I were fain thou wouldst even  champion me against another man if a like thing should ever befall me.\"    (ll. 1344-1357) He spake, and they sat down, united as of old. But of  those two, by the counsel of Zeus, one, Polyphemus son of Eilatus, was  destined to found and build a city among the Mysians bearing the river's  name, and the other, Heracles, to return and toil at the labours of  Eurystheus. And he threatened to lay waste the Mysian land at once,  should they not discover for him the doom of Hylas, whether living or  dead. And for him they gave pledges choosing out the noblest sons of the  people and took an oath that they would never cease from their labour of  search. Therefore to this day the people of Cius enquire for Hylas the  son of Theiodamas, and take thought for the well-built Trachis. For  there did Heracles settle the youths whom they sent from Cius as  pledges.    (ll. 1358-1362) And all day long and all night the wind bore the ship  on, blowing fresh and strong; but when dawn rose there was not even a  breath of air. And they marked a beach jutting forth from a bend of  the coast, very broad to behold, and by dint of rowing came to land at  sunrise.          BOOK II    (ll. 1-10) Here were the oxstalls and farm of Amycus, the haughty  king of the Bebrycians, whom once a nymph, Bithynian Melie, united  to Poseidon Genethlius, bare the most arrogant of men; for even for  strangers he laid down an insulting ordinance, that none should depart  till they had made trial of him in boxing; and he had slain many of the  neighbours. And at that time too he went down to the ship and in his  insolence scorned to ask them the occasion of their voyage, and who they  were, but at once spake out among them all:    (ll. 11-18) \"Listen, ye wanderers by sea, to what it befits you to  know. It is the rule that no stranger who comes to the Bebrycians should  depart till he has raised his hands in battle against mine. Wherefore  select your bravest warrior from the host and set him here on the spot  to contend with me in boxing. But if ye pay no heed and trample my  decrees under foot, assuredly to your sorrow will stern necessity come  upon you.\"    (ll. 19-21) Thus he spake in his pride, but fierce anger seized them  when they heard it, and the challenge smote Polydeuces most of all. And  quickly he stood forth his comrades' champion, and cried:    (ll. 22-24) \"Hold now, and display not to us thy brutal violence,  whoever thou art; for we will obey thy rules, as thou sayest. Willingly  now do I myself undertake to meet thee.\"    (ll. 25-54) Thus he spake outright; but the other with rolling eyes  glared on him, like to a lion struck by a javelin when hunters in the  mountains are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/831"],[0,"Four Arthurian Romances (#9)"],[1,"them  some distance, he said: \"In God's name, farewell!\" Then the Count kisses  Erec and his niece, and commends them both to merciful God. Her father  and mother, too, kiss them again and again, and could not keep back  their tears: at parting, the mother weeps, the father and the daughter  too. For such is love and human nature, and such is affection between  parents and children. They wept from sorrow, tenderness, and love which  they had for their child; yet they knew full well that their daughter  was to fill a place from which great honour would accrue to them. They  shed tears of love and pity when they separated from their daughter, but  they had no other cause to weep. They knew well enough that eventually  they would receive great honour from her marriage. So at parting many  a tear was shed, as weeping they commend one another to God, and thus  separate without more delay.    (Vv. 1479-1690.) Erec quit his host; for he was very anxious to reach  the royal court. In his adventure he took great satisfaction; for now he  had a lady passing fair, discreet, courteous, and debonair. He could not  look at her enough: for the more he looks at her, the more she pleases  him. He cannot help giving her a kiss. He is happy to ride by her side,  and it does him good to look at her. Long he gazes at her fair hair, her  laughing eyes, and her radiant forehead, her nose, her face, and mouth,  for all of which gladness fills his heart. He gazes upon her down to the  waist, at her chin and her snowy neck, her bosom and sides, her arms and  hands. But no less the damsel looks at the vassal with a clear eye and  loyal heart, as if they were in competition. They would not have ceased  to survey each other even for promise of a reward! A perfect match they  were in courtesy, beauty, and gentleness. And they were so alike in  quality, manner, and customs, that no one wishing to tell the truth  could choose the better of them, nor the fairer, nor the more discreet.  Their sentiments, too, were much alike; so that they were well suited  to each other. Thus each steals the other's heart away. Law or marriage  never brought together two such sweet creatures. And so they rode along  until just on the stroke of noon they approached the castle of Cardigan,  where they were both expected. Some of the first nobles of the court had  gone up to look from the upper windows and see if they could see them.  Queen Guinevere ran up, and even the King came with Kay and Perceval of  Wales, and with them my lord Gawain and Tor, the son of King Ares; Lucan  the cupbearer was there, too, and many another doughty knight. Finally,  they espied Erec coming along in company with his lady. They all knew  him well enough from as far as they could see him. The Queen is greatly  pleased, and indeed the whole court is glad of his coming, because they  all love him so. As soon as he was come before the entrance hall, the  King and Queen go down to meet him, all greeting him in God's name. They  welcome Erec and his maiden, commending and praising her great beauty.  And the King himself caught her and lifted her down from her palfrey.  The King was decked in fine array and was then in cheery mood. He did  signal honour to the damsel by taking her hand and leading her up into  the great stone hall. After them Erec and the Queen also went up hand  in hand, and he said to her: \"I bring you, lady, my damsel and my  sweetheart dressed in poor garb. As she was given to me, so have I  brought her to you. She is the daughter of a poor vavasor. Through  poverty many an honourable man is brought low: her father, for instance,  is gentle and courteous, but he has little means. And her mother is a  very gentle lady, the sister of a rich Count. She has no lack of beauty  or of lineage, that I should not marry her. It is poverty that has  compelled her to wear this white linen garment until both sleeves are  torn at the side. And yet, had it been my desire, she might have had  dresses rich enough. For another damsel, a cousin of hers, wished to  give her a robe of ermine and of spotted or grey silk. But I would  not have her dressed in any other robe until you should have seen her.  Gentle lady, consider the matter now and see what need she has of a  fine becoming gown.\" And the Queen at once replies: \"You have done quite  right; it is fitting that she should have one of my gowns, and I will  give her straightway a rich, fair gown, both fresh and new.\" The Queen  then hastily took her off to her own private room, and gave orders  to bring quickly the fresh tunic and the greenish-purple mantle,  embroidered with little crosses, which had been made for herself. The  one who went at her behest came bringing to her the mantle and the  tunic, which was lined with white ermine even to the sleeves. At the  wrists and on the neck-band there was in truth more than half a mark's  weight of beaten gold, and everywhere set in the gold there were  precious stones of divers colours, indigo and green, blue and dark  brown. This tunic was very rich, but not a writ less precious, I trow,  was the mantle. As yet, there were no ribbons on it; for the mantle like  the tunic was brand new. The mantle was very rich and fine: laid about  the neck were two sable skins, and in the tassels there was more than an  ounce of gold; on one a hyacinth, and on the other a ruby flashed more  bright than burning candle. The fur lining was of white ermine; never  was finer seen or found. The cloth was skilfully embroidered with little  crosses, all different, indigo, vermilion, dark blue, white, green,  blue, and yellow. The Queen called for some ribbons four ells long, made  of silken thread and gold. The ribbons are given to her, handsome and  well matched. Quickly she had them fastened to the mantle by some one  who knew how to do it, and who was master of the art. When the mantle  needed no more touches, the gay and gentle lady clasped the maid with  the white gown and said to her cheerily: \"Mademoiselle, you must change  this frock for this tunic which is worth more than a hundred marks of  silver. So much I wish to bestow upon you. And put on this mantle, too.  Another time I will give you more.\" Not able to refuse the gift, she  takes the robe and thanks her for it. Then two maids took her aside into  a room, where she took off her frock as being of no further value; but  she asked and requested that it be given away (to some poor woman) for  the love of God. Then she dons the tunic, and girds herself, binding on  tightly a golden belt, and afterwards puts on the mantle. Now she looked  by no means ill; for the dress became her so well that it made her look  more beautiful than ever. The two maids wove a gold thread in amongst  her golden hair: but her tresses were more radiant than the thread of  gold, fine though it was. The maids, moreover, wove a fillet of flowers  of many various colours and placed it upon her head. They strove as best  they might to adorn her in such wise that no fault should be found with  her attire. Strung upon a ribbon around her neck, a damsel hung two  brooches of enamelled gold. Now she looked so charming and fair that I  do not believe that you could find her equal in any land, search as you  might, so skilfully had Nature wrought in her. Then she stepped out of  the dressing-room into the Queen's presence. The Queen made much of her,  because she liked her and was glad that she was beautiful and had such  gentle manners. They took each other by the hand and passed into the  King's presence. And when the King saw them, he got up to meet them.  When they came into the great hall, there were so many knights there who  rose before them that I cannot call by name the tenth part of them, or  the thirteenth, or the fifteenth. But I can tell you the names of some  of the best of the knights who belonged to the Round Table and who were  the best in the world.    (Vv. 1691-1750.) Before all the excellent knights, Gawain ought to be  named the first, and second Erec the son of Lac, and third Lancelot of  the Lake. [116] Gornemant of Gohort was fourth, and the fifth was the  Handsome Coward. The sixth was the Ugly Brave, the seventh Meliant of  Liz, the eighth Mauduit the Wise, and the ninth Dodinel the Wild. Let  Gandelu be named the tenth, for he was a goodly man. The others I shall  mention without order, because the numbers bother me. Eslit was there  with Briien, and Yvain the son of Uriien. And Yvain of Loenel was there,  as well as Yvain the Adulterer. Beside Yvain of Cavaliot was Garravain  of Estrangot. After the Knight with the Horn was the Youth with the  Golden Ring. And Tristan who never laughed sat beside Bliobleheris, and  beside Brun of Piciez was his brother Gru the Sullen. The Armourer sat  next, who preferred war to peace. Next sat Karadues the Shortarmed,  a knight of good cheer; and Caveron of Robendic, and the son of King  Quenedic and the Youth of Quintareus and Yder of the Dolorous Mount.  Gaheriet and Kay of Estraus, Amauguin and Gales the Bald, Grain,  Gornevain, and Carabes, and Tor the son of King Aras, Girflet the son  of Do, and Taulas, who never wearied of arms: and a young man of great  merit, Loholt the son of King Arthur, [117] and Sagremor the Impetuous,  who should not be forgotten, nor Bedoiier the Master of the Horse,  who was skilled at chess and trictrac, nor Bravain, nor King Lot, nor  Galegantin of Wales, nor Gronosis, versed in evil, who was son of Kay  the Seneschal, nor Labigodes the Courteous, nor Count Cadorcaniois, nor  Letron of Prepelesant, whose manners were so excellent, nor Breon the  son of Canodan, nor the Count of Honolan who had such a head of fine  fair hair; he it was who received the King's horn in an evil day; [118]  he never had any care for truth.    (Vv. 1751-1844.) When the stranger maiden saw all the knights arrayed  looking steadfastly at her, she bowed her head in embarrassment; nor was  it"]]]
