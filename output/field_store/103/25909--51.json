He is a  scrubby and ill-favoured scamp--a sneaking, crawling rascal, capable of  all the villany of his master, but not possessed of his courage.\"    Had the governor been looking at the visitor's face just then, he might  have had his suspicions aroused.    The sham German philanthropist glared ferociously as this description  was given.    The prisoner, who was seated at a rough deal table at the further end  of the cell, here arose at the gaoler's order, and came to the window.    A single glance sufficed to show that a very noticeable change had  taken place in the appearance of Mathias.    His face was pale and haggard, and the whole of one side of it, the  eye, cheek bone, and forehead were bruised.    This was the mark that Jefferson had set upon him.    This was the bold American's only vengeance for the deathblow which the  brigand had dealt upon his faithful friend and companion Magog Brand.    Jefferson's right arm came down like a steam hammer, and any man who  had felt its full force as the scoundrel Mathias had did not forget it  very readily.    Such a desperate shaking had it given Mathias that he had not yet  recovered.    The bold, defiant bearing of the man was gone, and he looked ten years  older than when Tomaso and he had last met.    It struck the visitor at once.    \"Dear, dear me,\" exclaimed the latter, \"is it possible that this can be  the redoubtable Mathias?\"    \"It is he,\" said the governor, \"yet scarcely so gay as is his wont, eh,  Mathias?\"    The prisoner shrugged his shoulders and sighed.    \"Laugh on, your excellency,\" he said, rather bitterly, \"it is your turn  now.\"    \"Now!\"    \"Aye, now. It may not always be.\"    \"Why, surely you never think of getting out of this?\"    \"Indeed, I think of nothing else morning, noon, and night.\"    The governor gave a sharp glance about.    He looked toward the gaoler.    Now the gaoler was a huge fellow, over six feet high and broad in  proportion, one who could have tackled Toro himself, as far as weight  and sheer brute strength went.    \"Your excellency,\" replied Mathias, \"when I leave this place, my exit  will be due to no violence. Bad as I am, I am not altogether what they  would make out.\"    \"Poor Mathias!\" said the governor ironically, \"one would almost think  that murder was not his line of business.\"    \"Your excellency,\" said the prison, drawing near to the grated window,  \"I repent sincerely of that poor little gentleman's death; it was no  assassin's stab in the dark, but a most unfortunate blow in a fight,  remember.\"    \"Bravo! Mathias! bravo!\" ejaculated the visitor.    The prisoner looked up.    A strange expression flitted across his face.    Mathias was an adept in the art of dissimulation, and his face was  schooled to tell neither more nor less than he wished.    \"Now, your excellency,\" said the visitor, \"this rascal appears  strangely self-possessed.\"    \"He does.\"    \"What does it mean?\"    \"Brag.\"    \"Humph!\"    \"Ah, you do not know him, sir, as well as I do.\"    \"Perhaps not; but it might just be possible that he is in league with  some of his comrades outside.\"    The governor smiled incredulously.    \"Impossible.\"    \"What if that scoundrel, Tomaso, of whom we were speaking, should be at  work?\"    The prisoner's eyes glistened at this word.    A slight flash of intelligence passed between the prisoner and the  visitor.    It was but momentary, and so slight as to be utterly unobserved by  either the gaoler or the governor.    \"And if such could be the case, sir, what could he possibly do, eh?  What on earth, that's what I ask.\"    \"There's no saying.\"    \"Indeed you're right.\"    \"Only he ought to be well guarded when you change him from one prison  to another, or--\"    \"Stop, stop, my dear sir, why change him? He will never leave this  place alive,\" said the governor.    \"Never?\"    \"Never!\"    \"But surely you don't keep your prisoners all confined in these  stifling places?\"    \"We do, though.\"    \"And never let them breathe the air? Why, it is torture.\"    \"They do breathe the air. At noon every day they are allowed to walk  for an hour in the prison yard.\"    \"At noon?\"    \"At noon.\"    The visitor fixed his eyes strangely upon the prisoner.    \"Very good; if I may be allowed to trespass again, I should like to see  how this fellow bears himself in the yard amongst his fellow-criminals.\"    \"By all means.\"    \"I'll come, then, at noon.\"           *       *       *       *       *    At noon next day the German traveller was as good as his word.    The governor, full of his wonted courtesy, accompanied him to the yard,  where all the prisoners were walking round two and two.    Some of the more desperate men were fastened by a single handcuff to  the wrist of another man--a warder.    Of this category was the brigand Mathias.    His companion was a huge fellow, who topped him by a head and  shoulders, and their wrists were linked securely together by a  strong--if slender--pair of handcuffs.    The visitor's countenance fell when he observed this.    It upset all his plans at one fell swoop.    However, he did not utterly despair, but made an effort to get over the  difficulty.    \"Your excellency,\" said he, \"this is indeed cruel.\"    \"What,\" demanded the governor, \"fastening them to the gaoler?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I only order it in special cases, such as that of Mathias.\"    \"He is then very dangerous?\"    \"Well, I scarcely believe that, only such precautions are the  established rules.\"    \"I regret that.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Partly on the score of humanity,\" was the reply.    \"Ah, you would be too tender-hearted,\" said the governor.    \"No. But I also regret it because I hoped to see the brigand more like  he appears when not under restraint. I suppose you would not like to  set him free?\"    The governor shook his head.    \"That is against custom, and I should really not like to do it.\"    The visitor reflected a moment as they walked on.    He could not abandon his scheme now that he had gone so far.    The effort should be made all the same.    They walked up to the porter's lodge beside the gates, where an eager  crowd had assembled for a glimpse of the prisoners.    \"And do you open those gates to admit the prisoners?\" asked the visitor  innocently.    \"No, sir,\" replied the governor; \"this little side door is all we open.  Now watch how it is done. This bar, which is like a lever, stops the  door, and renders it immovable, now--hah!\"    The fallacy of his words was shown ere they were fairly uttered.    The visitor whistled in a very peculiar way.    And there was a sudden silent rush at the door in question.    The bar, immovable as it was, fell before that desperate onslaught, and  the door was carried off its hinges.    The ragged and miserable-looking mob turned like magic into a crowd of  armed desperadoes. And in they pressed.    On they came, tearing down the gates and dashing every thing before  them.    The poor gatekeeper was trampled under foot, and the warders and  governor got hustled and cruelly handled.    The mob of armed invaders made for Mathias and his companion, and bore  them bodily outside the gates.    The brigands then wrenched off the handcuffs.    Once outside the gates, a horse was found waiting.    Suddenly there was a loud cry heard.    \"The soldiers--the soldiers!\"    The whole of the guard-room had turned out.    A charge was made, and it looked as though the rescue of Mathias were  likely to cost them dear.    Cries of defiance and rage were heard.    Just when matters were at the worst for the robber band, a deafening  explosion was heard, that shook the solid building to its base.    The soldiers turned back and re-formed at their officer's command.    Then it was that the brigands, headed by the sham visitor, Tomaso,  found their chance.    Up till now, the retreat had been cut off by the unpleasant appearance  of the military.    \"There goes the powder keg under the water gate,\" cried Tomaso. \"Lose  not a moment. Follow me.\"    A desperate rush was made, and the brigands got clear of the prison.    The soldiers were divided into two lots, one party being sent in  pursuit, the other remaining to guard the prison.    The roll-call of the prisoners made this discovery.    \"How many prisoners have escaped?\" inquired the governor.    \"Three absentees, your excellency,\" said the head man of the prison.  \"One is an Italian, calling himself Toro; another an Englishman,  calling himself Hunston; and the third, the brigand chief Mathias.\"          CHAPTER VIII.    A DEEP-LAID PLOT.      The news of the escape, or rescue--call it what you will--of the three  desperadoes soon became known.    Emily and Mrs. Harvey were much alarmed.    The dogged obstinacy with which attempt after attempt was made by the  villains made them imagine they were unsafe in such a lonely place.    Accordingly, a grand consultation was held, the result of which was  that the Prince of Limbi was sent into the town to take rooms for the  whole party at one of the two hotels the place could boast of.    And the next day they all quitted the villa.    The hotel in which our friends had secured apartments was a large  straggling building, right at the extremity of the ill-built street  which formed the chief part of the town.    Mr. Mole had been very particular when they went there in his inquiries  about the brigands.    Would the party be quite safe from molestation?    The urbane proprietor, with many low bows, assured his excellency the  Englishman that there was not the slightest possibility of their being  molested.    The other male members of the party really troubled themselves very  little about the brigands.    By ten o'clock, the day after the masquerade, hardly a person was  stirring in the town.    A casual observer would have said there was literally no one to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7346"],[0,"Among Malay Pirates : a Tale of Adventure and Peril (#9)"],[1,"take his country, and after they done that take the countries of  the others; make themselves kings of the river. He ask them to join him  in killing English, every man, then he would have no more quarrel with  them, no trouble trade any more; be good friends with all neighbors.  Some chiefs say one thing, some another. Some more afraid of rajah than  of English; some think better have English here than rajah.    \"Hassan says must take great care. Sehi very treacherous; attack when  they do not expect it. He thinks his prahus can easily take English  ship; but Hassan says Sehi wants the other chiefs to aid, so that if  the English send up more ships, then, can all join him in fighting them.  Hassan says he will do what he can. He has eight war canoes, but no good  against prahus--they run at canoes, and cut them in half; but will  come to help if English attack. He does not know where prahus are. Begs  Captain to attack these first; it is they that make Sehi master of the  river. If they destroyed, other chiefs not afraid of Sehi, and he might  get some of them to join against him. Hassan said tell Harry, and Dick,  and Doctor he does not forget their kindness, and will do what he can to  watch over them. Such is Hassan's message.\"    \"Ask him when he is going back to his chief,\" the captain said.    \"He go now,\" the interpreter said, after asking the question. \"He get as  far as he can before morning. He sure many eyes watch ship night and  day to see that no message comes, or any word of what rajah is doing. He  float down stream in sampan some distance, then paddle to opposite bank,  then keep in shadow of bushes up the river, and hide away till night  comes again.\"    \"Very well, then, tell him that he is to thank his master for sending  us warning; that we had already found out that what he told us before he  went away was true, and that Sehi is a very bad man. Say that we are not  afraid of prahus, and will make short work of them when we get a chance.  Tell him we will take great care, and not let ourselves be surprised,  and that when we have finished with this fellow here, the ship will come  as far up the river as she can go, and show the chiefs that the English  have no evil intentions against them, and will send his three friends  with a strong boat party to pay him a visit. By the way, ask the man if  he knows this part of the country.\"    \"Yes, Captain; he says that he has been since his boyhood a boatman, and  has worked for some years with a trader, who used to go up the creeks,  and trade with the villagers.\"    \"Ask him if he knows a creek that turns off from the river four or five  miles above this; it is a very small one, but it leads into a pool on  which is a large village.\"    The man nodded at once, when the question was put, then spoke for a  minute or two.    \"He says, Captain, that he knows the pool and village; but he has never  been up the small creek that you speak of. Did not know that a boat  could get through. He has been there by a large creek that runs into  the other branch of the river, the one that turns off twelve miles below  this; from that river it is an hour's paddle in a sampan to the pool.\"    \"How should we know the entrance?\" the captain asked.    \"Entrance difficult to find,\" the native replied; \"strip of land runs  out from both sides, covered with trees. One goes a little beyond  the other, so that anyone who did not know it would pass the entrance  without noticing it. It is just wide enough for a large craft to go in  and out. There is a village stands a hundred yards below the entrance;  it would be known by a big tree that grows before a large house close to  the bank. The water is deep on that side. You have only, after passing  the village, to keep close in shore, and you will then see the entrance  to the creek. It is called Alligator Creek, because, more than any  place, it swarms with these creatures.\"    \"Thank you,\" the captain said. \"Will you tell the chief that I say you  have rendered me a valuable service?\"    He opened a case in which he kept presents intended for the chiefs, and  took out a brace of handsome pistols, a powder flask, and a bullet mold.    \"Take these,\" he said, \"in token of the service you have rendered. When  I see your chief, you shall be well recompensed for the risk that you  have run in bearing me his message.\"    The Malay looked longingly at the pistols, and then said, \"I came by  order of my chief, and not for reward.\"    \"Quite so. I understand that, and am not offering you a reward for that  service, but for the information that you have given me, which may be of  value if I have trouble with the rajah here.\"    The man bowed and took the pistols offered. \"I will use them against  your enemies,\" he said warmly; \"but all of us know the creek, for it is  that which renders it so difficult for us to fight against Sehi. He is  master of the water, and we cannot attack him without first crossing  that creek. We should have to carry canoes with us, to do it, for the  creek is too full of alligators for anyone to swim across, and our small  canoes would have no chance of passing the creek when his war boats were  there.\"    The captain nodded when this was translated to him.    \"Sehi's place, in fact, stands upon an island formed by the two branches  of the river and this creek. As soon as he became master of the river,  he could hardly be assailed, while at any time he could sally out and  fall upon his enemies. Ask the man if he will take any refreshment  before he goes.\"    The man declined. He had, he said, sufficient fruit and dried fish for  his journey back. A few minutes later he took his place in the little  canoe and drifted away into the darkness, and was soon lost to sight.        CHAPTER VI.      \"Things are coming to a crisis, Harry,\" Dick Balderson said, in a tone  of delight, as they left the captain's cabin. \"We now know what we all  along suspected--the rajah is a rascal, and we have not only found out  where his prahus are hidden, but have them corked up in a bottle.\"    \"Nothing could be better, Dick, and I expect we shall have some pretty  hot work. Of course the Serpent cannot get up that creek, though she can  place herself at the entrance and prevent their getting away; but there  still remains the work of capturing or driving them down the creek, and  that is likely to be a very tough job.\"    The next morning the second lieutenant, the mate, and Harry Parkhurst  were sent for to the captain's cabin. The first lieutenant was there.  They were each asked their opinion as to whether the prahus could force  their way through the creek by which they had ascended.    \"It is a most important point,\" the captain said: \"and indeed,  everything might depend upon it.\"    \"I am sure, sir,\" Mr. Hopkins said, \"that they could not go straight  down it. They might cut their way through, but it would be a work of  considerable time, for with their masts they would have to clear away  the branches to a considerable height. Down near the water the branches  by which we pushed ourselves along were those of the undergrowth, with  many rattans and other creepers varying from the thickness of one's  thumb to that of one's wrist, and these would take a great deal of  chopping before one of their war boats could be pushed through, but  higher up they would probably have much thicker branches to contend  with. It may be that they can lower their masts; but even if they could  do so, I should think that it would take them over an hour's work, even  with the number of hands they carry, to get a passage through that bit  of thick undergrowth, fifty or sixty yards up the mouth of the creek.  There are two or three other places where some chopping would have to be  done, but that would be comparatively easy work.\"    The mate and Harry both agreed with the lieutenant.    \"Practically, then,\" the captain said, \"the Malays have but one mode of  escape, while we have two of attack. At any rate, if we send up a boat  beforehand, and fasten two or three iron chains from side to side among  the branches, that passage would be securely sealed.    \"Thank you, gentlemen; that is all I have to ask at present. It is a  very difficult nut we have to crack, Mr. Ferguson,\" he went on, when  he and the first lieutenant were alone. \"To attack six strongly armed  prahus with the boats of this ship would be a serious enterprise indeed,  and its success would be very doubtful, while the loss would certainly  be very heavy, especially as, if any of the boats were sunk, the crews  would have but little chance in a place swarming with alligators. I  don't think I should be justified in risking such an enterprise.\"    \"There is no doubt, sir, the loss would be very heavy indeed; by all  accounts, these Malays fight like demons on the decks of their own  boats, and, for aught we know, they may, after nightfall, trice up  rattans to prevent boarders getting on board. I have heard that it is  their custom when they expect an attack, and that these are far more  formidable obstacles than our boarding nets. Of course I should be quite  ready to lead an attack should you decide upon making one, but I cannot  conceal from myself that it would be a well nigh desperate undertaking.\"    \"I am glad that you are of that opinion,\" the captain said. \"There  seems to me but one course, and that a difficult one--namely, to carry  a couple of heavy guns through the forest to the edge of the pool. It  would be a serious undertaking, and we should have to send a strong  force to defend them, but if we could succeed in planting them in  position, we should soon drive the Malays out of the pool.\"    \"That would be a capital plan, Captain, if it could be managed. I  suppose before we attempt it, you will take possession of this place,  and capture the rajah?\"    \"That of course. I don't suppose we shall capture him. I have no doubt  that we are closely watched night"]]]
