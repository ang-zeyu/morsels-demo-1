This technique cannot be bound,  filed, and forgotten, in the manner of theoretical inspirations.  Continue ceaselessly on your path to liberation through KRIYA,  whose power lies in practice.'    \"I myself consider KRIYA the most effective device of salvation through  self-effort ever to be evolved in man's search for the Infinite.\"  Kebalananda concluded with this earnest testimony. \"Through its use,  the omnipotent God, hidden in all men, became visibly incarnated  in the flesh of Lahiri Mahasaya and a number of his disciples.\"    A Christlike miracle by Lahiri Mahasaya took place in Kebalananda's  presence. My saintly tutor recounted the story one day, his eyes  remote from the Sanskrit texts before us.    \"A blind disciple, Ramu, aroused my active pity. Should he have no  light in his eyes, when he faithfully served our master, in whom  the Divine was fully blazing? One morning I sought to speak to  Ramu, but he sat for patient hours fanning the guru with a hand-made  palm-leaf PUNKHA. When the devotee finally left the room, I followed  him.    \"'Ramu, how long have you been blind?'    \"'From my birth, sir! Never have my eyes been blessed with a glimpse  of the sun.'    \"'Our omnipotent guru can help you. Please make a supplication.'    \"The following day Ramu diffidently approached Lahiri Mahasaya. The  disciple felt almost ashamed to ask that physical wealth be added  to his spiritual superabundance.    \"'Master, the Illuminator of the cosmos is in you. I pray you  to bring His light into my eyes, that I perceive the sun's lesser  glow.'    \"'Ramu, someone has connived to put me in a difficult position. I  have no healing power.'    \"'Sir, the Infinite One within you can certainly heal.'    \"'That is indeed different, Ramu. God's limit is nowhere! He who  ignites the stars and the cells of flesh with mysterious life-effulgence  can surely bring luster of vision into your eyes.'    \"The master touched Ramu's forehead at the point between the eyebrows.  {FN4-7} \"'Keep your mind concentrated there, and frequently chant  the name of the prophet Rama {FN4-8} for seven days. The splendor  of the sun shall have a special dawn for you.'    \"Lo! in one week it was so. For the first time, Ramu beheld the  fair face of nature. The Omniscient One had unerringly directed his  disciple to repeat the name of Rama, adored by him above all other  saints. Ramu's faith was the devotionally ploughed soil in which  the guru's powerful seed of permanent healing sprouted.\" Kebalananda  was silent for a moment, then paid a further tribute to his guru.    \"It was evident in all miracles performed by Lahiri Mahasaya that  he never allowed the ego-principle {FN4-9} to consider itself a  causative force. By perfection of resistless surrender, the master  enabled the Prime Healing Power to flow freely through him.    \"The numerous bodies which were spectacularly healed through Lahiri  Mahasaya eventually had to feed the flames of cremation. But the  silent spiritual awakenings he effected, the Christlike disciples  he fashioned, are his imperishable miracles.\"    I never became a Sanskrit scholar; Kebalananda taught me a diviner  syntax.    {FN4-1} Literally, \"renunciate.\" From Sanskrit verb roots, \"to cast  aside.\"    {FN4-2} Effects of past actions, in this or a former life; from  Sanskrit KRI, \"to do.\"    {FN4-3} BHAGAVAD GITA, IX, 30-31. Krishna was the greatest prophet  of India; Arjuna was his foremost disciple.    {FN4-4} I always addressed him as Ananta-da. DA is a respectful  suffix which the eldest brother in an Indian family receives from  junior brothers and sisters.    {FN4-5} At the time of our meeting, Kebalananda had not yet joined  the Swami Order and was generally called \"Shastri Mahasaya.\" To avoid  confusion with the name of Lahiri Mahasaya and of Master Mahasaya  (../chapter 9), I am referring to my Sanskrit tutor only by his  later monastic name of Swami Kebalananda. His biography has been  recently published in Bengali. Born in the Khulna district of  Bengal in 1863, Kebalananda gave up his body in Benares at the age  of sixty-eight. His family name was Ashutosh Chatterji.    {FN4-6} The ancient four VEDAS comprise over 100 extant canonical  books. Emerson paid the following tribute in his JOURNAL to Vedic  thought: \"It is sublime as heat and night and a breathless ocean.  It contains every religious sentiment, all the grand ethics which  visit in turn each noble poetic mind. . . . It is of no use to put  away the book; if I trust myself in the woods or in a boat upon the  pond, Nature makes a BRAHMIN of me presently: eternal necessity,  eternal compensation, unfathomable power, unbroken silence. . . .  This is her creed. Peace, she saith to me, and purity and absolute  abandonment--these panaceas expiate all sin and bring you to the  beatitude of the Eight Gods.\"    {FN4-7} The seat of the \"single\" or spiritual eye. At death the  consciousness of man is usually drawn to this holy spot, accounting  for the upraised eyes found in the dead.    {FN4-8} The central sacred figure of the Sanskrit epic, RAMAYANA.    {FN4-9} Ahankara, egoism; literally, \"I do.\" The root cause of  dualism or illusion of MAYA, whereby the subject (ego) appears as  object; the creatures imagine themselves to be creators.        CHAPTER: 5    A \"PERFUME SAINT\" DISPLAYS HIS WONDERS    \"To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose  under the heaven.\"    I did not have this wisdom of Solomon to comfort me; I gazed  searchingly about me, on any excursion from home, for the face of  my destined guru. But my path did not cross his own until after  the completion of my high school studies.    Two years elapsed between my flight with Amar toward the Himalayas,  and the great day of Sri Yukteswar's arrival into my life. During  that interim I met a number of sages-the \"Perfume Saint,\" the \"Tiger  Swami,\" Nagendra Nath Bhaduri, Master Mahasaya, and the famous  Bengali scientist, Jagadis Chandra Bose.    My encounter with the \"Perfume Saint\" had two preambles, one  harmonious and the other humorous.    \"God is simple. Everything else is complex. Do not seek absolute  values in the relative world of nature.\"    These philosophical finalities gently entered my ear as I stood  silently before a temple image of Kali. Turning, I confronted a  tall man whose garb, or lack of it, revealed him a wandering SADHU.    \"You have indeed penetrated the bewilderment of my thoughts!\" I  smiled gratefully. \"The confusion of benign and terrible aspects  in nature, as symbolized by Kali, {FN5-1} has puzzled wiser heads  than mine!\"    \"Few there be who solve her mystery! Good and evil is the challenging  riddle which life places sphinxlike before every intelligence.  Attempting no solution, most men pay forfeit with their lives,  penalty now even as in the days of Thebes. Here and there, a towering  lonely figure never cries defeat. From the MAYA {FN5-2} of duality  he plucks the cleaveless truth of unity.\"    \"You speak with conviction, sir.\"    \"I have long exercised an honest introspection, the exquisitely  painful approach to wisdom. Self-scrutiny, relentless observance of  one's thoughts, is a stark and shattering experience. It pulverizes  the stoutest ego. But true self-analysis mathematically operates  to produce seers. The way of 'self-expression,' individual  acknowledgments, results in egotists, sure of the right to their  private interpretations of God and the universe.\"    \"Truth humbly retires, no doubt, before such arrogant originality.\"  I was enjoying the discussion.    \"Man can understand no eternal verity until he has freed himself  from pretensions. The human mind, bared to a centuried slime, is  teeming with repulsive life of countless world-delusions. Struggles  of the battlefields pale into insignificance here, when man first  contends with inward enemies! No mortal foes these, to be overcome  by harrowing array of might! Omnipresent, unresting, pursuing man  even in sleep, subtly equipped with a miasmic weapon, these soldiers  of ignorant lusts seek to slay us all. Thoughtless is the man who  buries his ideals, surrendering to the common fate. Can he seem  other than impotent, wooden, ignominious?\"    \"Respected Sir, have you no sympathy for the bewildered masses?\"    The sage was silent for a moment, then answered obliquely.    \"To love both the invisible God, Repository of All Virtues, and  visible man, apparently possessed of none, is often baffling! But  ingenuity is equal to the maze. Inner research soon exposes a unity  in all human minds-the stalwart kinship of selfish motive. In one  sense at least, the brotherhood of man stands revealed. An aghast  humility follows this leveling discovery. It ripens into compassion  for one's fellows, blind to the healing potencies of the soul  awaiting exploration.\"    \"The saints of every age, sir, have felt like yourself for the  sorrows of the world.\"    \"Only the shallow man loses responsiveness to the woes of others'  lives, as he sinks into narrow suffering of his own.\" The SADHU'S  austere face was noticeably softened. \"The one who practices a  scalpel self-dissection will know an expansion of universal pity.  Release is given him from the deafening demands of his ego. The  love of God flowers on such soil. The creature finally turns to  his Creator, if for no other reason than to ask in anguish: 'Why,  Lord, why?' By ignoble whips of pain, man is driven at last into  the Infinite Presence, whose beauty alone should lure him.\"    The sage and I were present in Calcutta's Kalighat Temple, whither  I had gone to view its famed magnificence. With a sweeping gesture,  my chance companion dismissed the ornate dignity.    \"Bricks and mortar sing us no audible"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7471"],[0,"The Man with Two Left Feet, and Other Stories (#9)"],[1,"there are so many girls that he falls in love with that his  holiday is up before he can, so to speak, concentrate.    But in Wilton's case this was out of the question. A man does not get  over the sort of blow he had had, not, at any rate, for many years: and  we had gathered that his tragedy was comparatively recent.    I doubt if I was ever more astonished in my life than the night when he  confided in me. Why he should have chosen me as a confidant I cannot  say. I am inclined to think that I happened to be alone with him at the  psychological moment when a man must confide in somebody or burst; and  Wilton chose the lesser evil.    I was strolling along the shore after dinner, smoking a cigar and  thinking of Grace Bates, Heloise Miller, and Clarice Wembley, when I  happened upon him. It was a beautiful night, and we sat down and drank  it in for a while. The first intimation I had that all was not well  with him was when he suddenly emitted a hollow groan.    The next moment he had begun to confide.    'I'm in the deuce of a hole,' he said. 'What would you do in my  position?'    'Yes?' I said.    'I proposed to Mary Campbell this evening.'    'Congratulations.'    'Thanks. She refused me.'    'Refused you!'    'Yes--because of Amy.'    It seemed to me that the narrative required footnotes.    'Who is Amy?' I said.    'Amy is the girl--'    'Which girl?'    'The girl who died, you know. Mary had got hold of the whole story. In  fact, it was the tremendous sympathy she showed that encouraged me to  propose. If it hadn't been for that, I shouldn't have had the nerve.  I'm not fit to black her shoes.'    Odd, the poor opinion a man always has--when he is in love--of his  personal attractions. There were times when I thought of Grace Bates,  Heloise Miller, and Clarice Wembley, when I felt like one of the beasts  that perish. But then, I'm nothing to write home about, whereas the  smallest gleam of intelligence should have told Wilton that he was a  kind of Ouida guardsman.    'This evening I managed somehow to do it. She was tremendously nice  about it--said she was very fond of me and all that--but it was quite  out of the question because of Amy.'    'I don't follow this. What did she mean?'    'It's perfectly clear, if you bear in mind that Mary is the most  sensitive, spiritual, highly strung girl that ever drew breath,' said  Wilton, a little coldly. 'Her position is this: she feels that, because  of Amy, she can never have my love completely; between us there would  always be Amy's memory. It would be the same as if she married a  widower.'    'Well, widowers marry.'    'They don't marry girls like Mary.'    I couldn't help feeling that this was a bit of luck for the widowers;  but I didn't say so. One has always got to remember that opinions  differ about girls. One man's peach, so to speak, is another man's  poison. I have met men who didn't like Grace Bates, men who, if Heloise  Miller or Clarice Wembley had given them their photographs, would have  used them to cut the pages of a novel.    'Amy stands between us,' said Wilton.    I breathed a sympathetic snort. I couldn't think of anything noticeably  suitable to say.    'Stands between us,' repeated Wilton. 'And the damn silly part of the  whole thing is that there isn't any Amy. I invented her.'    'You--what!'    'Invented her. Made her up. No, I'm not mad. I had a reason. Let me  see, you come from London, don't you?'    'Yes.'    'Then you haven't any friends. It's different with me. I live in a  small country town, and everyone's my friend. I don't know what it is  about me, but for some reason, ever since I can remember, I've been  looked on as the strong man of my town, the man who's _all right_.  Am I making myself clear?'    'Not quite.'    'Well, what I am trying to get at is this. Either because I'm a strong  sort of fellow to look at, and have obviously never been sick in my  life, or because I can't help looking pretty cheerful, the whole of  Bridley-in-the-Wold seems to take it for granted that I can't possibly  have any troubles of my own, and that I am consequently fair game for  anyone who has any sort of worry. I have the sympathetic manner, and  they come to me to be cheered up. If a fellow's in love, he makes a  bee-line for me, and tells me all about it. If anyone has had a  bereavement, I am the rock on which he leans for support. Well, I'm a  patient sort of man, and, as far as Bridley-in-the-Wold is concerned, I  am willing to play the part. But a strong man does need an occasional  holiday, and I made up my mind that I would get it. Directly I got here  I saw that the same old game was going to start. Spencer Clay swooped  down on me at once. I'm as big a draw with the Spencer Clay type of  maudlin idiot as catnip is with a cat. Well, I could stand it at home,  but I was hanged if I was going to have my holiday spoiled. So I  invented Amy. Now do you see?'    'Certainly I see. And I perceive something else which you appear to  have overlooked. If Amy doesn't exist--or, rather, never did exist--she  cannot stand between you and Miss Campbell. Tell her what you have told  me, and all will be well.'    He shook his head.    'You don't know Mary. She would never forgive me. You don't know what  sympathy, what angelic sympathy, she has poured out on me about Amy. I  can't possibly tell her the whole thing was a fraud. It would make her  feel so foolish.'    'You must risk it. At the worst, you lose nothing.'    He brightened a little.    'No, that's true,' he said. 'I've half a mind to do it.'    'Make it a whole mind,' I said, 'and you win out.'    I was wrong. Sometimes I am. The trouble was, apparently, that I didn't  know Mary. I am sure Grace Bates, Heloise Miller, or Clarice Wembley  would not have acted as she did. They might have been a trifle stunned  at first, but they would soon have come round, and all would have been  joy. But with Mary, no. What took place at the interview I do not know;  but it was swiftly perceived by Marois Bay that the Wilton-Campbell  alliance was off. They no longer walked together, golfed together, and  played tennis on the same side of the net. They did not even speak to  each other.          *      *      *      *      *    The rest of the story I can speak of only from hearsay. How it became  public property, I do not know. But there was a confiding strain in  Wilton, and I imagine he confided in someone, who confided in someone  else. At any rate, it is recorded in Marois Bay's unwritten archives,  from which I now extract it.          *      *      *      *      *    For some days after the breaking-off of diplomatic relations, Wilton  seemed too pulverized to resume the offensive. He mooned about the  links by himself, playing a shocking game, and generally comported  himself like a man who has looked for the escape of gas with a lighted  candle. In affairs of love the strongest men generally behave with the  most spineless lack of resolution. Wilton weighed thirteen stone, and  his muscles were like steel cables; but he could not have shown less  pluck in this crisis in his life if he had been a poached egg. It was  pitiful to see him.    Mary, in these days, simply couldn't see that he was on the earth. She  looked round him, above him, and through him, but never at him; which  was rotten from Wilton's point of view, for he had developed a sort of  wistful expression--I am convinced that he practised it before the  mirror after his bath--which should have worked wonders, if only he  could have got action with it. But she avoided his eye as if he had  been a creditor whom she was trying to slide past on the street.    She irritated me. To let the breach widen in this way was absurd.  Wilton, when I said as much to him, said that it was due to her  wonderful sensitiveness and highly strungness, and that it was just one  more proof to him of the loftiness of her soul and her shrinking horror  of any form of deceit. In fact, he gave me the impression that, though  the affair was rending his vitals, he took a mournful pleasure in  contemplating her perfection.    Now one afternoon Wilton took his misery for a long walk along the  seashore. He tramped over the sand for some considerable time, and  finally pulled up in a little cove, backed by high cliffs and dotted  with rocks. The shore around Marois Bay is full of them.    By this time the afternoon sun had begun to be too warm for comfort,  and it struck Wilton that he could be a great deal more comfortable  nursing his wounded heart with his back against one of the rocks than  tramping any farther over the sand. Most of the Marois Bay scenery is  simply made as a setting for the nursing of a wounded heart. The cliffs  are a sombre indigo, sinister and forbidding; and even on the finest  days the sea has a curious sullen look. You have only to get away from  the crowd near the bathing-machines and reach one of these small coves  and get your book against a rock and your pipe well alight, and you can  simply wallow in misery. I have done it myself. The day when Heloise  Miller went golfing with Teddy Bingley I spent the whole afternoon in  one of these retreats. It is true that, after twenty minutes of  contemplating the breakers, I fell asleep; but that is bound to happen.    It happened to Wilton. For perhaps half an hour he brooded, and then  his pipe fell from his mouth and he dropped off into a peaceful  slumber. And time went by.    It was a touch of cramp that finally woke him. He jumped up with a  yell, and stood there massaging his calf. And he had hardly got rid of  the pain, when a startled exclamation broke the primeval stillness; and  there, on the other side of the rock, was Mary Campbell.    Now, if Wilton had had any inductive reasoning in his composition at  all, he would have been tremendously elated. A girl does not creep out  to a distant cove at Marois Bay unless she is unhappy; and if Mary  Campbell was"]]]
