And to pay due regard to truth,  without prejudice to the judgment of any, although they lately at the  eleventh hour have entered the lord's vineyard, as the books that are  so fond of us eagerly declared in our sixth chapter, they have added  more in this brief hour to the stock of the sacred books than all the  other vine-dressers; following in the footsteps of Paul, the last to be  called but the first in preaching, who spread the gospel of Christ more  widely than all others.  Of these men, when we were raised to the  episcopate we had several of both orders, viz., the Preachers and  Minors, as personal attendants and companions at our board, men  distinguished no less in letters than in morals, who devoted themselves  with unwearied zeal to the correction, exposition, tabulation, and  compilation of various volumes.  But although we have acquired a very  numerous store of ancient as well as modern works by the manifold  intermediation of the religious, yet we must laud the Preachers with  special praise, in that we have found them above all the religious most  freely communicative of their stores without jealousy, and proved them  to be imbued with an almost Divine liberality, not greedy but fitting  possessors of luminous wisdom.    Besides all the opportunities mentioned above, we secured the  acquaintance of stationers and booksellers, not only within our own  country, but of those spread over the realms of France, Germany, and  Italy, money flying forth in abundance to anticipate their demands; nor  were they hindered by any distance or by the fury of the seas, or by  the lack of means for their expenses, from sending or bringing to us  the books that we required.  For they well knew that their expectations  of our bounty would not be defrauded, but that ample repayment with  usury was to be found with us.    Nor, finally, did our good fellowship, which aimed to captivate the  affection of all, overlook the rectors of schools and the instructors  of rude boys.  But rather, when we had an opportunity, we entered their  little plots and gardens and gathered sweet-smelling flowers from the  surface and dug up their roots, obsolete indeed, but still useful to  the student, which might, when their rank barbarism was digested heal  the pectoral arteries with the gift of eloquence.  Amongst the mass of  these things we found some greatly meriting to be restored, which when  skilfully cleansed and freed from the disfiguring rust of age, deserved  to be renovated into comeliness of aspect.  And applying in full  measure the necessary means, as a type of the resurrection to come, we  resuscitated them and restored them again to new life and health.    Moreover, we had always in our different manors no small multitude of  copyists and scribes, of binders, correctors, illuminators, and  generally of all who could usefully labour in the service of books.  Finally, all of both sexes and of every rank or position who had any  kind of association with books, could most easily open by their  knocking the door of our heart, and find a fit resting-place in our  affection and favour.  In so much did we receive those who brought  books, that the multitude of those who had preceded them did not lessen  the welcome of the after-comers, nor were the favours we had awarded  yesterday prejudicial to those of to-day.  Wherefore, ever using all  the persons we have named as a kind of magnets to attract books, we had  the desired accession of the vessels of science and a multitudinous  flight of the finest volumes.    And this is what we undertook to narrate in the present chapter.        CHAPTER IX    HOW, ALTHOUGH WE PREFERRED THE WORKS OF THE ANCIENTS, WE HAVE NOT  CONDEMNED THE STUDIES OF THE MODERNS    Although the novelties of the moderns were never disagreeable to our  desires, who have always cherished with grateful affection those who  devote themselves to study and who add anything either ingenious or  useful to the opinions of our forefathers, yet we have always desired  with more undoubting avidity to investigate the well-tested labours of  the ancients.  For whether they had by nature a greater vigour of  mental sagacity, or whether they perhaps indulged in closer application  to study, or whether they were assisted in their progress by both these  things, one thing we are perfectly clear about, that their successors  are barely capable of discussing the discoveries of their forerunners,  and of acquiring those things as pupils which the ancients dug out by  difficult efforts of discovery.  For as we read that the men of old  were of a more excellent degree of bodily development than modern times  are found to produce, it is by no means absurd to suppose that most of  the ancients were distinguished by brighter faculties, seeing that in  the labours they accomplished of both kinds they are inimitable by  posterity.   And so Phocas writes in the prologue to his Grammar:         Since all things have been said by men of sense       The only novelty is--to condense.    But in truth, if we speak of fervour of learning and diligence in  study, they gave up all their lives to philosophy; while nowadays our  contemporaries carelessly spend a few years of hot youth, alternating  with the excesses of vice, and when the passions have been calmed, and  they have attained the capacity of discerning truth so difficult to  discover, they soon become involved in worldly affairs and retire,  bidding farewell to the schools of philosophy.  They offer the fuming  must of their youthful intellect to the  difficulties of philosophy,  and bestow the clearer wine upon the money-making business of life.  Further, as Ovid in the first book of the De Vetula justly complains:      The hearts of all men after gold aspire;    Few study to be wise, more to acquire:    Thus, Science! all thy virgin charms are sold,    Whose chaste embraces should disdain their gold,    Who seek not thee thyself, but pelf through thee,    Longing for riches, not philosophy.    And further on:      Thus Philosophy is seen    Exiled, and Philopecuny is queen,    which is known to be the most violent poison of learning.    How the ancients indeed regarded life as the only limit of study, is  shown by Valerius, in his book addressed to Tiberius, by many examples.  Carneades, he says, was a laborious and lifelong soldier of wisdom:  after he had lived ninety years, the same day put an end to his life  and his philosophizing.  Isocrates in his ninety-fourth year wrote a  most noble work.  Sophocles did the same when nearly a hundred years  old.  Simonides wrote poems in his eightieth year.  Aulus Gellius did  not desire to live longer than he should be able to write, as he says  himself in the prologue to the Noctes Atticae.    The fervour of study which possessed Euclid the Socratic, Taurus the  philosopher used to relate to incite young men to study, as Gellius  tells in the book we have mentioned.  For the Athenians, hating the  people of Megara, decreed that if any of the Megarensians entered  Athens, he should be put to death.  Then Euclid, who was a Megarensian,  and had attended the lectures of Socrates before this decree,  disguising himself in a woman's dress, used to go from Megara to Athens  by night to hear Socrates, a distance of twenty miles and back.  Imprudent and excessive was the fervour of Archimedes, a lover of  geometry, who would not declare his name, nor lift his head from the  diagram he had drawn, by which he might have prolonged his life, but  thinking more of study than of life dyed with his life-blood the figure  he was studying.    There are very many such examples of our proposition, but the brevity  we aim at does not allow us to recall them.  But, painful to relate,  the clerks who are famous in these days pursue a very different course.  Afflicted with ambition in their tender years, and slightly fastening  to their untried arms the Icarian wings of presumption, they  prematurely snatch the master's cap; and mere boys become unworthy  professors of the several faculties, through which they do not make  their way step by step, but like goats ascend by leaps and bounds; and,  having slightly tasted of the mighty stream, they think that they have  drunk it dry, though their throats are hardly moistened.  And because  they are not grounded in the first rudiments at the fitting time, they  build a tottering edifice on an unstable foundation, and now that they  have grown up, they are ashamed to learn what they ought to have  learned while young, and thus they are compelled to suffer for ever for  too hastily jumping at dignities they have not deserved.  For these and  the like reasons the tyros in the schools do not attain to the solid  learning of the ancients in a few short hours of study, although they  may enjoy distinctions, may be accorded titles, be authorized by  official robes, and solemnly installed in the chairs of the elders.  Just snatched from the cradle and hastily weaned, they mouth the rules  of Priscian and Donatus; while still beardless boys they gabble with  childish stammering the Categorics and Peri Hermeneias, in the writing  of which the great Aristotle is said to have dipped his pen in his  heart's blood.  Passing through these faculties with baneful haste and  a harmful diploma, they lay violent hands upon Moses, and sprinkling  about their faces dark waters and thick clouds of the skies, they offer  their heads, unhonoured by the snows of age, for the mitre of the  pontificate. This pest is greatly encouraged, and they are helped to  attain this fantastic clericate with such nimble steps, by Papal  provisions obtained by insidious prayers, and also by the prayers,  which may not be rejected, of cardinals and great men, by the cupidity  of friends and relatives, who, building up Sion in blood, secure"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6260"],[0,"Donovan Pasha, and Some People of Egypt — Complete (#9)"],[1,"desert,  they and I. Coming to the tomb of Amshar the sheikh, by which was a  well, there I found a train of camels. One of these I stole, and again  I ran into the desert, and left the jackals behind. Hour after hour, day  and night, I rode on. But faintness was upon me, and dreams came.  For though only the sands were before me, I seemed to watch the Nile  running--running, and thou beside it, hastening with it, hastening,  hastening towards thy home. And Allah put a thorn into my heart, that a  sharp pain went through my body--and at last I fell.\"    Soada's eyes were on him now with a strange, swimming brilliancy.    \"Mahommed--Mahommed Selim, Allah touched thine eyes that thou didst see  truly,\" she said eagerly. \"Speak not till I have done,\" he answered.  \"When I waked again I was alone in the desert, no food, no water, and  the dead camel beside me. But I had no fear. 'If it be God's will,' said  I, 'then I shall come unto Soada. If it be not God's will, so be it: for  are we not on the cushion of His mercy, to sleep or to wake, to live or  to die?'\"    He paused, tottering, and presently sank upon the ground, his hands  drooped before him, his head bent down. Old Fatima touched him on the  shoulder.    \"Brother of vultures didst thou go forth; brother of eagles dost thou  return,\" she said. \"Eat, drink, in the house of thy child and its  mother.\"    \"Shall the unforgiven eat or drink?\" he asked, and he rocked his body  to and fro, like one who chants the Koran in a corner of El Azhar,  forgetting and forgotten.    Soada's eyes were on him now as though they might never leave him again;  and she dragged herself little by little towards him, herself and the  child--little by little, until at last she touched his feet, and the  child's face was turned towards him from its mother's breast.    \"Thou art my love, Mahommed Selim,\" she said. He raised his head from  his hands, a hunger of desire in his face.    \"Thou art my lord,\" she added: \"art thou not forgiven? The little one is  thine and mine,\" she whispered. \"Wilt thou not speak to him?\"    \"Lest Allah should strike me with blindness and dry up the juice of my  veins, I will not touch thee or the child until all be righted. Food  will I not eat, nor water drink until thou art mine--by the law of the  Prophet, mine.\"    Laying down the water-jar, and the plate of dourha bread, old Fatima  gathered her robe about her, and cried as she ran from the house:  \"Marriage and fantasia thou shalt have this hour.\"    The stiffness seemed to pass from her bones as she ran through the  village to the house of the Omdah. Her voice, lifting shrilly, sang the  Song of Haleel, the song of the newly married, till it met the chant of  the Muezzin on the tower of the mosque El Hassan, and mingled with it,  dying away over the fields of bersim and the swift-flowing Nile.    That night Mahommed Selim and Soada the daughter of Wassef the  camel-driver were married, but the only fantasia they held was their own  low laughter over the child. In the village, however, people were little  moved to smile, for they knew that Mahommed Selim was a deserter from  the army of the Khedive at Dongola, and that meant death. But no one  told Soada this, and she did not think; she was content to rest in the  fleeting dream.    \"Give them twenty-four hours,\" said the black-visaged fat sergeant of  cavalry come to arrest Mahommed Selim for desertion.    The father of Mahommed Selim again offered the Mamour a feddan of  land if the young man might go free, and to the sergeant he offered a  she-camel and a buffalo. To no purpose. It was Mahommed Selim himself  who saved his father's goods to him. He sent this word to the sergeant  by Yusef the drunken ghaffir: \"Give me to another sunset and sunrise,  and what I have is thine--three black donkeys of Assiout rented to old  Abdullah the sarraf.\"    Because with this offer he should not only have backsheesh but the  man also, the fat sergeant gave him leave. When the time was up, and  Mahommed Selim drew Soada's face to his breast, he knew that it was the  last look and last embrace.    \"I am going back,\" he said; \"my place is empty at Dongola.\"    \"No, no, thou shalt not go,\" she cried. \"See how the little one loves  thee,\" she urged, and, sobbing, she held the child up to him.    But he spoke softly to her, and at last she said: \"Kiss me, Mahommed  Selim. Behold now thy discharge shall be bought from the palace of the  Khedive, and soon thou wilt return,\" she cried.    \"If it be the will of God,\" he answered; \"but the look of thine eyes I  will take with me, and the face of the child here.\" He thrust a finger  into the palm of the child, and the little dark hand closed round it.  But when he would have taken it away, the little hand still clung,  though the eyes were scarce opened upon life.    \"See, Mahommed Selim,\" Soada cried, \"he would go with thee.\"    \"He shall come to me one day, by the mercy of God,\" answered Mahommed  Selim.    Then he went out into the market-place and gave himself up to the fat  sergeant. As they reached the outskirts of the village a sorry camel  came with a sprawling gallop after them, and swaying and rolling above  it was Yusef, the drunken ghaffir, his naboot of dom-wood across his  knees.    \"What dost thou come for, friend of the mercy of God?\" asked Mahommed  Selim.    \"To be thy messenger, praise be to God!\" answered Yusef, swinging his  water-bottle clear for a drink.      V    In Egypt, the longest way round is not the shortest way home, and that  was why Mahommed Selim's court-martial took just three minutes and a  half; and the bimbashi who judged him found even that too long, for he  yawned in the deserter's face as he condemned him to death.    Mahommed Selim showed no feeling when the sentence was pronounced. His  face had an apathetic look. It seemed as if it were all one to him. But  when they had turned him round to march to the shed where he was to  be kept, till hung like a pig at sunrise, his eyes glanced about  restlessly. For even as the sentence had been pronounced a new idea had  come into his mind. Over the heads of the Gippy soldiers, with their  pipestem legs, his look flashed eagerly, then a little painfully--then  suddenly stayed, for it rested on the green turban of Yusef, the drunken  ghaffir. Yusef's eyes were almost shut; his face had the grey look of  fresh-killed veal, for he had come from an awful debauch of hashish.    \"Allah! Allah!\" cried Mahommed Selim, for that was the sound which  always waked the torpid brain of Yusef since Wassef the camel-driver's  skull had crackled under his naboot.    Yusef's wide shoulders straightened back, his tongue licked his lips,  his eyes stared before him, his throat was dry. He licked his lips  again. \"Allah!\" he cried and ran forward.    The soldiers thrust Yusef back. Mahommed Selim turned and whispered to  the sergeant.    \"Backsheesh!\" he said; \"my grey Arab for a word with Yusef the ghaffir.\"    \"Malaish!\" said the sergeant; and the soldiers cleared a way for Yusef.    The palms of the men from Beni Souef met once, twice, thrice; they  touched their lips, their breasts, their foreheads, with their hands,  three times. Then Mahommed Selim fell upon the breast of Yusef and  embraced him. Doing so he whispered in his ear:    \"In the name of Allah, tell Soada I died fighting the Dervishes!\"    \"So be it, in God's name!\" said Yusef. \"A safe journey to you, brother  of giants.\"    Next morning at sunrise, between two dom-palms, stood Mahommed Selim;  but scarce a handful of the soldiers sent to see him die laughed when  the rope was thrown over his head. For his story had gone abroad, and  it was said that he was mad--none but a madman would throw away his life  for a fellah woman. And was it not written that a madman was one beloved  of Allah, who had taken his spirit up into heaven, leaving only the  disordered body behind?    If, at the last moment, Mahommed Selim had but cried out: \"I am mad;  with my eyes I have seen God!\" no man would have touched the rope that  hanged him up that day.    But, according to the sacred custom, he only asked for a bowl of  water, drank it, said \"Allah!\" and bowed his head three times towards  Mecca--and bowed his head no more.    Before another quarter was added to the moon, Yusef, the drunken  ghaffir, at the door of Soada's hut in Beni Souef, told old Fatima  the most wonderful tale, how Mahommed Selim had died on his sheepskin,  having killed ten Dervishes with his own hand; and that a whole regiment  had attended his funeral.    This is to the credit of Yusef's account, that the last half of his  statement was no lie.          ON THE REEF OF NORMAN'S WOE           \"It was the schooner Hesperus          That sailed the wintry sea;          And the skipper had taken his little daughter          To bear him company.          -------------------          Such was the wreck of the Hesperus          In the midnight and the snow!          Christ save us all from a death like this,          On the reef of Norman's woe!\"    Only it was not the schooner Hesperus, and she did not sail the wintry  sea. It was the stern-wheeled tub Amenhotep, which churned her way up  and down the Nile, scraping over sand banks, butting the shores with  gaiety embarrassing--for it was the time of cholera, just before the  annual rise of the Nile. Fielding Bey, the skipper, had not taken his  little daughter, for he had none; but he had taken little Dicky Donovan,  who had been in at least three departments of the Government, with  advantage to all.    Dicky was dining with Fielding at the Turf Club, when a telegram came  saying that cholera had appeared at a certain village on the Nile.  Fielding had dreaded this, had tried to make preparation for it, had  begged of the Government this reform and that--to no purpose. He knew  that the saving of the country from an epidemic lay with his handful  of Englishmen and the faithful"]]]
