[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/529"],[0,"Knights of Art: Stories of the Italian Painters (#9)"],[1,"    The summer days passed slowly by. The cheeks of the peaches grew soft  and pink under the kiss of the sun, the figs showed ripe and purple  beneath the green leaves, and the grapes hung in great transparent  clusters of purple and gold from the vines that swung between the  poplar-trees. Then came the merry days of vintage, and the juice was  pressed out of the ripe grapes.    'Now he will come back,' said Lucrezia, 'for he said \"by the time the  grapes are gathered I will return.\"'    The days went slowly by, and every evening she stood in the loggia and  gazed across the hills. Then she would point out the long white road to  little Filippino.    'Thy father will come along that road ere long,' she said, and joy sang  in her voice.    Then one evening as she watched as usual her heart beat quickly. Surely  that figure riding so slowly along was Fra Diamante? But where was  Filippo, and why did his friend ride so slowly?    When he came near and entered the house she looked into his face, and  all the joy faded from her eyes.    'You need not tell me,' she cried; 'I know that Filippo is dead.'    It was but too true. The faithful friend had brought the sad news  himself. No one could tell how Filippo had died. A few short hours of  pain and then all was over. Some talked of poison. But who could tell?    There had just been time to send his farewell to Lucrezia, and to pray  his friend to take charge of little Filippino.    So, as she listened, joy died out of Lucrezia's life. Spring might come  again, and summer sunshine make others glad, but for her it would be  ever cold, bleak winter. For never more should her heart grow warm in  the sunshine of Filippo's smile--that sunshine which had made every one  love him, in spite of his faults, ever since he ran about the streets,  a little ragged boy, in the old city of Florence.        SANDRO BOTTICELLI    We must now go back to the days when Fra Filippo Lippi painted his  pictures and so brought fame to the Carmine Convent.    There was at that time in Florence a good citizen called Mariano  Filipepi, an honest, well-to-do man, who had several sons. These sons  were all taught carefully and well trained to do each the work he  chose. But the fourth son, Alessandro, or Sandro as he was called, was  a great trial to his father. He would settle to no trade or calling.  Restless and uncertain, he turned from one thing to another. At one  time he would work with all his might, and then again become as idle  and fitful as the summer breeze. He could learn well and quickly when  he chose, but then there were so few things that he did choose to  learn. Music he loved, and he knew every song of the birds, and  anything connected with flowers was a special joy to him. No one knew  better than he how the different kinds of roses grew, and how the  lilies hung upon their stalks.    'And what, I should like to know, is going to be the use of all this,'  the good father would say impatiently, 'as long as thou takest no pains  to read and write and do thy sums? What am I to do with such a boy, I  wonder?'    Then in despair the poor man decided to send Sandro to a neighbour's  workshop, to see if perhaps his hands would work better than his head.    The name of this neighbour was Botticelli, and he was a goldsmith, and  a very excellent master of his art. He agreed to receive Sandro as his  pupil, so it happened that the boy was called by his master's name, and  was known ever after as Sandro Botticelli.    Sandro worked for some time with his master, and quickly learned to  draw designs for the goldsmith's work.    In those days painters and goldsmiths worked a great deal together, and  Sandro often saw designs for pictures and listened to the talk of the  artists who came to his master's shop. Gradually, as he looked and  listened, his mind was made up. He would become a painter. All his  restless longings and day dreams turned to this. All the music that  floated in the air as he listened to the birds' song, the gentle  dancing motion of the wind among the trees, all the colours of the  flowers, and the graceful twinings of the rose-stems--all these he  would catch and weave into his pictures. Yes, he would learn to paint  music and motion, and then he would be happy.    'So now thou wilt become a painter,' said his father, with a hopeless  sigh.    Truly this boy was more trouble than all the rest put together. Here he  had just settled down to learn how to become a good goldsmith, and now  he wished to try his hand at something else. Well, it was no use saying  'no.' The boy could never be made to do anything but what he wished.  There was the Carmelite monk Fra Filippo Lippi, of whom all, men were  talking. It was said he was the greatest painter in Florence. The boy  should have the best teaching it was possible to give him, and perhaps  this time he would stick to his work.    So Sandro was sent as a pupil to Fra Filippo, and he soon became a  great favourite with the happy, sunny-tempered master. The quick eye of  the painter soon saw that this was no ordinary pupil. There was  something about Sandro's drawing that was different to anything that  Filippo had ever seen before. His figures seemed to move, and one  almost heard the wind rustling in their flowing drapery. Instead of  walking, they seemed to be dancing lightly along with a swaying motion  as if to the rhythm of music. The very rose-leaves the boy loved to  paint, seemed to flutter down to the sound of a fairy song. Filippo was  proud of his pupil.    'The world will one day hear more of my Sandro Botticelli,' he said;  and, young though the boy was, he often took him to different places to  help him in his work.    So it happened that, in that wonderful spring of Filippo's life, Sandro  too was at Prato, and worked there with Fra Diamante. And in after  years when the master's little daughter was born, she was named  Alessandra, after the favourite pupil, to whom was also left the  training of little Filippino.    Now, indeed, Sandros good old father had no further cause to complain.  The boy had found the work he was most fitted for, and his name soon  became famous in Florence.    It was the reign of gaiety and pleasure in the city of Florence at that  time. Lorenzo the Magnificent, the son of Cosimo de Medici, was ruler  now, and his court was the centre of all that was most splendid and  beautiful. Rich dresses, dainty food, music, gay revels, everything  that could give pleasure, whether good or bad, was there.    Lorenzo, like his father, was always glad to discover a new painter,  and Botticelli soon became a great favourite at court.    But pictures of saints and angels were somewhat out of fashion at that  time, for people did not care to be reminded of anything but earthly  pleasures. So Botticelli chose his subjects to please the court, and  for a while ceased to paint his sad-eyed Madonnas.    What mattered to him what his subject was? Let him but paint his  dancing figures, tripping along in their light flowing garments,  keeping time to the music of his thoughts, and the subject might be one  of the old Greek tales or any other story that served his purpose.    All the gay court dresses, the rich quaint robes of the fair ladies,  helped to train the young painter's fancy for flowing draperies and  wonderful veils of filmy transparent gauze.    There was one fair lady especially whom Sandro loved to paint--the  beautiful Simonetta, as she is still called.    First he painted her as Venus, who was born of the sea foam. In his  picture she floats to the shore standing in a shell, her golden hair  wrapped round her. The winds behind blow her onward and scatter pink  and red roses through the air. On the shore stands Spring, who holds  out a mantle, flowers nestling in its folds, ready to enwrap the  goddess when the winds shall have wafted her to land.    Then again we see her in his wonderful picture of 'Spring,' and in  another called 'Mars and Venus.' She was too great a lady to stoop to  the humble painter, and he perhaps only looked up to her as a star  shining in heaven, far out of the reach of his love. But he never  ceased to worship her from afar. He never married or cared for any  other fair face, just as the great poet Dante, whom Botticelli admired  so much, dreamed only of his one love, Beatrice.    But Sandro did not go sadly through life sighing for what could never  be his. He was kindly and good-natured, full of jokes, and ready to  make merry with his pupils in the workshop.    It once happened that one of these pupils, Biagio by name, had made a  copy of one of Sandro's pictures, a beautiful Madonna surrounded by  eight angels. This he was very anxious to sell, and the master kindly  promised to help him, and in the end arranged the matter with a citizen  of Florence, who offered to buy it for six gold pieces.    'Well, Biagio,' said Sandro, when his pupil came into the studio next  morning, 'I have sold thy picture. Let us now hang it up in a good  light that the man who wishes to buy it may see it at its best. Then  will he pay thee the money.'    Biagio was overjoyed.    'Oh, master,' he cried, 'how well thou hast done.'    Then with hands which trembled with excitement the pupil arranged the  picture in the best light, and went to fetch the purchaser.    Now meanwhile Botticelli and his other pupils had made eight caps of  scarlet pasteboard such as the citizens of Florence then wore, and  these they fastened with wax on to the heads of the eight angels in the  picture.    Presently Biagio came back panting with joyful excitement, and brought  with him the citizen, who knew already of the joke. The poor boy looked  at his picture and then rubbed his eyes. What had happened? Where were  his angels? The picture must be bewitched, for instead of his angels he  saw only eight citizens in scarlet caps.    He looked wildly around, and then at the face of the man who had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5307"],[0,"The Letters of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart — Volume 01 (#9)"],[1,"music; I was therefore obliged to write this motett in  haste, to allow time for the score to be copied for his Highness, and to  arrange the parts so that it might be produced on the following Sunday  at grand mass at the offertory. Most dear and highly esteemed Maestro,  I do entreat you to give me unreservedly your candid opinion of the  motett. We live in this world in order always to learn industriously,  and to enlighten each other by means of discussion, and to strive  vigorously to promote the progress of science and the fine arts. Oh,  how many and many a time have I desired to be nearer you, that I might  converse and discuss with your Reverence! I live in a country where  music has very little success, though, exclusive of those who have  forsaken us, we have still admirable professors, and more particularly  composers of great solidity, knowledge, and taste. We are rather badly  off at the theatre from the want of actors. We have no MUSICI, nor shall  we find it very easy to get any, because they insist upon being well  paid, and generosity is not a failing of ours. I amuse myself in the  mean time by writing church and chamber music, and we have two excellent  contrapuntists here, Haydn and Adlgasser. My father is maestro at the  Metropolitan church, which gives me an opportunity to write for the  church as much as I please. Moreover, my father has been thirty-six  years in the service of this court, and knowing that our present  Archbishop neither can nor will endure the sight of elderly people, he  does not take it to heart, but devotes himself to literature, which was  always his favorite pursuit Our church music is rather different from  that of Italy, and the more so, as a mass including the Kyne, Gloria,  Credo, the Sonata all Epistola, the Offertory or Motett, Sanctus, and  Agnus Dei, and even a solemn mass, when the Prince himself officiates,  must never last more than three-quarters of an hour. A particular course  of study is required for this class of composition. And what must such  a mass be, scored with all the instruments, war-drums, cymbals, &c, &c!  Oh! why are we so far apart, dearest Signor Maestro? for how many things  I have to say to you! I devoutly revere all the Signori Filarmonici. I  venture to recommend myself to your good opinion, I shall never cease  regretting being so distant from the person in the world whom I most  love, venerate, and esteem. I beg to subscribe myself, reverend Father,  always your most humble and devoted servant,    \"WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART\"]          SECOND PART.--MUNICH, AUGSBURG, MANNHEIM.--SEPTEMBER 1771 TO MARCH 1778.      On the 22d of December, 1777, Mozart's father wrote as follows to Padre  Martini in Bologna:--\"My son has been now five years in the service of  our Prince, at a mere nominal salary, hoping that by degrees his earnest  endeavors and any talents he may possess, combined with the utmost  industry and most unremitting study, would be rewarded; but in this hope  we find ourselves deceived. I forbear all allusion to our Prince's mode  of thinking and acting; but he was not ashamed to declare that my son  knew nothing, and that he ought to go to the musical training school in  Naples to learn music. And why did he say all this? In order to intimate  that a young man should not be so absurd as to believe that he deserved  a rather higher salary after such a decisive verdict had issued from the  lips of a prince. This has induced me to sanction my son giving up his  present situation. He therefore left Salzburg on the 23d of September\"  [with his mother].        59.    Wasserburg, Sept. 23, 1777.    Mon Tres-Cher Pere,--    God be praised! we reached Waging, Stain, Ferbertshaim, and Wasserburg  safely. Now for a brief report of our journey. When we arrived at the  city gates, we were kept waiting for nearly a quarter of an hour till  they could be thrown open for us, as they were under repair. Near Schinn  we met a drove of cows, and one of these very remarkable, for each side  was a different color, which we never before saw. When at last we got to  Schinn, we met a carriage, which stopped, and ecce, our postilion called  out we must change. \"I don't care,\" said I. Mamma and I were parleying,  when a portly gentleman came up, whose physiognomy I at once recognized;  he was a Memmingen merchant. He stared at me for some time, and at last  said, \"You surely are Herr Mozart?\" \"At your service,\" said I; \"I  know you, too, by sight, but not your name. I saw you, a year ago, at  Mirabell's [the palace garden in Salzburg] at a concert.\" He then told  me his name, which, thank God! I have forgotten; but I retained one of  probably more importance to me. When I saw this gentleman in Salzburg,  he was accompanied by a young man whose brother was now with him, and  who lives in Memmingen. His name is Herr Unhold, and he pressed me very  much to come to Memmingen if possible. We sent a hundred thousand loves  to papa by them, and to my sister, the madcap, which they promised to  deliver without fail. This change of carriages was a great bore to me,  for I wished to send a letter back from Waging by the postilion. We then  (after a slight meal) had the honor of being conveyed as far as Stain,  by the aforesaid post-horses, in an hour and a half. At Waging I was  alone for a few minutes with the clergyman, who looked quite amazed,  knowing nothing of our history. From Stain we were driven by a most  tiresome phlegmatic postilion--N. B., in driving I mean; we thought we  never were to arrive at the next stage. At last we did arrive, as  you may see from my writing this letter. (Mamma is half asleep.) From  Ferbertshaim to Wasserburg all went on well. Viviamo come i principi;  we want nothing except you, dear papa. Well, this is the will of God; no  doubt all will go on right. I hope to hear that papa is as well as I am  and as happy. Nothing comes amiss to me; I am quite a second papa, and  look after everything.[Footnote: The father had been very uneasy at the  idea of allowing the inexperienced youth, whose unsuspicious good-nature  exposed him still more to danger, to travel alone; for the mother also  was not very expert in travelling.] I settled from the first to pay the  postilions, for I can talk to such fellows better than mamma. At the  Stern, in Wasserburg, we are capitally served; I am treated here like  a prince. About half an hour ago (mamma being engaged at the time) the  Boots knocked at the door to take my orders about various things, and  I gave them to him with the same grave air that I have in my portrait.  Mamma is just going to bed. We both beg that papa will be careful of  his health, not go out too early, nor fret, [Footnote: The Father was  strongly disposed to hypochondria.] but laugh and be merry and in good  spirits. We think the Mufti H. C. [the Archbishop Hieronymus Colloredo]  a MUFF, but we know God to be compassionate, merciful, and loving. I  kiss papa's hands a thousand times, and embrace my SISTER MADCAP as  often as I have to-day taken snuff. I think I have left my diplomas at  home? [his appointment at court.] I beg you will send them to me soon.  My pen is rude, and I am not refined.        60.    Munich, Sept. 26, 1777.    WE arrived safely in Munich on the afternoon of the 24th, at half-past  four o'clock. A complete novelty to me was being obliged to drive to the  Custom House, escorted by a grenadier with a fixed bayonet. The  first person we knew, who met us when driving, was Signor Consoli; he  recognized me at once, and showed the utmost joy at seeing me again.  Next day he called on us. I cannot attempt to describe the delight of  Herr Albert [the \"learned landlord\" of the Black Eagle, on the Kaufinger  Gasse, now Hotel Detzer]; he is indeed a truly honest man, and a very  good friend of ours. On my arrival I went to the piano, and did not  leave it till dinner-time. Herr Albert was not at home, but he soon  came in, and we went down to dinner together. There I met M. Sfeer and  a certain secretary, an intimate friend of his; both send their  compliments to you. Though tired by our journey, we did not go to bed  till late; we, however, rose next morning at seven o'clock. My hair was  in such disorder that I could not go to Count Seeau's till half-past  ten o'clock. When I got there I was told that he had driven out to the  chasse. Patience! In the mean time I wished to call on Chorus-master  Bernard, but he had gone to the country with Baron Schmid. I found  Herr von Belvall deeply engaged in business; he sent you a thousand  compliments. Rossi came to dinner, and at two o'clock Consoli, and  at three arrived Becke [a friend of Mozart's and an admirable  flute-player], and also Herr von Belvall. I paid a visit to Frau  von Durst [with whom Nannerl had lived], who now lodges with the  Franciscans. At six o'clock I took a short walk with Herr Becke. There  is a Professor Huber here, whom you may perhaps remember better than I  do; he says that the last time he either saw or heard me was at Vienna,  at Herr von Mesmer's, junior. He is neither tall nor short, pale,  with silvery-gray hair, and his physiognomy rather like that of Herr  Unterbereiter. This gentleman is vice-intendant of the theatre; his  occupation is to read through all the comedies to be acted, to improve  or to spoil, to add to or to put them aside. He comes every evening to  Albert's, and often talks to me. To-day, Friday, the 26th, I called on  Count Seeau at half-past eight o'clock. This was what passed. As I was  going into the house I met Madame Niesser, the actress, just coming out,  who said, \"I suppose you wish to see the Count?\" \"Yes!\" \"He is still in  his garden, and Heaven knows when he may come!\" I asked her where the  garden was. \"As I must see him also,\" said she, \"let us go together.\"  We had scarcely left the house when we saw the Count coming towards us  about twelve paces off; he recognized and instantly named me.
