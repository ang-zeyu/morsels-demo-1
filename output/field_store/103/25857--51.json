A man who buys, before its maturity, a lost or stolen note, may  collect the full amount from the maker, provided the note is  payable to \"bearer\" and no notice of the loss has been published.    When the maker of a lost note pays the amount to the original  owner, he should receive from him what is known as a \"bond of  indemnity.\"    This bond is to secure him against paying a second time.    NOTES ABOUT NOTES    There are some things worth remembering about promissory notes.    1. Never give one if you can pay cash.  2. A note made on Sunday is worthless in some states.  3. A note given under compulsion is worthless.  4. Notes made by a drunken person, or obtained by any form of  fraud cannot be collected under law.  5. Notes bear interest only when so stated in body of note.  6. The holder of a note has a legal claim against every indorser.  7. Each indorser is responsible to every indorser who follows him.  8. Notes are valid without reference to the kind of paper, or  whether they are written with pen or pencil.  9. Losing a note does not release the maker from payment.  10. If no time is set in a note for payment, it becomes due as  soon as it is made.  11. Where a note is made in one state and is payable in another,  it is governed by the laws of the state in which it is to be paid.  12. Notes payable on demand draw no interest until after they have  been presented for payment.  13. If a note reads \"with interest\" and no rate is specified then  it draws the legal interest in the state in which it was made.  14. Demand notes are not entitled to days of grace.  15. If no place of payment is named in a note, it should be  presented to the maker personally in business hours.  16. The misspelling of a word or words in no way invalidates a  note.  17. If a person who cannot write makes a note his mark should be  properly witnessed.  18. The makers of a joint note must be sued jointly.  19. If the words and the figures in a note disagree, the words  take precedence.  20. A note signed by a firm may be collected from either of the  partners.  21. When a payment is made on a note secured by a mortgage, the  amount is endorsed on the note, never on the mortgage.  22. A note given by a minor is void, unless given for actual  necessities, like food and clothing.  23. If a note made by a minor is acknowledged when he comes of age  it is binding and collectible.          CHAPTER XI    A DRAFT        A draft is a written order from the first party to the second  party to pay to the third party a certain sum of money at a  certain time.    The first party is called the \"drawer.\"    The second party is the \"drawee.\"    The third party is the \"payee.\"    There are two kinds of draft.    The first is usually where the cashier of one bank, through his  own check, draws on another bank for the cash difference in their  accounts with each other.    The second form of draft is the most usual and is the one we shall  here consider.    The cashier's draft is always for cash and the demand is always  honored. The ordinary business draft may be for cash or for goods.    The business draft is usually honored, but there are circumstances  under which it may be ignored.    TO MAKE A DRAFT    But let us suppose that the draft is all right and that a  merchant, let us call him Henry Thomas, and suppose him a resident  of Philadelphia, has a bill against James Taylor, of Cleveland,  and he wants to collect it, without recourse to law. How will he  go about it?    The bill is for $100.    Mr. Thomas writes this draft:         Philadelphia, Pa., Sept. 5, 1910.     At sight pay to the order of     Johnson National Bank of Philadelphia     One hundred................... dollars.                 With exchange               and charge same to                            Henry Thomas.     To James Taylor,         Cleveland, Ohio.    Having drawn his draft, Mr. Thomas takes it to the Johnson  National Bank for collection. The collection is actually made by  some bank in Cleveland to which the Johnson has endorsed it over.    If Mr. Thomas wished he might have sent his draft direct to the  Cleveland bank, but he no doubt thought it better to transact such  matters through his own bank.    Or if Mr. Thomas lived where he was not in touch with a bank, he  might have drawn through any person whom he knew in Cleveland.    On receiving the draft for collection, the Cleveland bank would at  once give it to a clerk who would without delay present it to Mr.  Taylor.    Mr. Taylor, having written his acceptance of the draft, is given  three days grace in which to make payment.    In states where days of grace are not allowed, he would have to  pay at once.    Mr. Taylor writes the word \"accepted,\" with the date and his name  across the face of the draft, and if he does not pay cash, he  states in the writing where payment will be made.    Of course, Mr. Taylor cannot be compelled to accept a draft. There  may be good and honest reasons for his not doing so, but having  accepted it, in business honor he is bound to pay it.    The term \"Sight draft\" explains itself, but the order to pay a  draft may indicate, and often does, the number of days allowed for  payment, after presentation.    FOR COLLECTION    What should be done by the man to whom a bill or a note is due,  when the debtor lives in a place where there is no bank?    In that case he must learn in some way the name of a promising  person to make the collection for him.    In this case he makes out the draft as before, and adds the words  \"for collection.\" This acts as a bar to any transfer of the paper.    Most banks refuse to handle a draft marked \"for collection.\"    DISHONOR    Drafts are not necessarily duns.    Some country merchants prefer to pay their bills to wholesalers in  that way, so that collecting drafts is no small part of the  business of the ordinary bank.    While men are not compelled to meet drafts when presented, if the  amount is due and he defaults or refuses to pay he injures his own  credit.    In refusing a just draft he is said to \"dishonor\" it.    So sure are wholesalers that their drafts will be met by their  distant debtors that they do not hesitate to draw against them  when deposited for collection, regarding them as cash to their  credit in bank.    PROTESTS    When a draft is not accepted or paid when due, if it be a time  draft, it is protested in the same way as a note.    The protest of a draft serves as a notice to the drawer of its  non-acceptance.    Like notes and checks, drafts may be transferred by a similar  endorsement.    BUYING DRAFTS    If I wanted to pay a bill for $150 to Albert Holt, living at  Wallace, Kansas, and did not wish to trouble him with a check, how  would I go about it?    1. I might express the cash, which would be expensive.  2. I might send it in postal order, not always certain.  3. I might send it by a trusted hand, but might have long to wait  before I found a friend going out to Wallace.    I am living in New York City, and am familiar enough with banking  to know that New York is a great financial center and is in  constant communication with nearly all the outside banks.    The outside banks keep money in deposit here, and the New York  banks, particularly in the spring and autumn, keep deposits with  their correspondents.    With my $150 and a small extra sum to pay my bank for drawing the  draft, I go thither and buy a draft for the sum I owe Mr. Holt.    I mail this draft to my creditor and he can cash it without loss  in his home bank. Here is the form:                                  No. 101.      Madison National Bank of New York.    Pay to the order of Albert Holt,    One hundred and fifty dollars ($150.)...    ..........               L. N. Jones,                                   Cashier.    To Prairie National Bank,      Wallace, Kansas.    A GOOD PLAN    When you buy a draft which you mean to send off in payment of a  debt, a good plan is to have it made payable to yourself.    Let us suppose it is the case of Albert Holt. You transfer the  draft to him by writing across the back, \"Pay to the order of  Albert Holt,\" and add your signature.    Now as all drafts are returned, as payment vouchers, to the banks  from which they were issued, and as Mr. Holt must have signed the  draft to get his money, it follows that there is a record of his  having received it, and this has all the force of a receipt.    Do not endorse a draft with just your name, for in that case,  anyone into whose hands it falls may collect. First write \"Pay to  the order of\" the person for whom it is intended.    GOOD AS CASH    A draft made payable to yourself is as good as cash, and far safer  to carry.    If you are identified at any bank between the Atlantic and  Pacific, you can have your draft cashed.    All banks furnish blank drafts.    Never endorse a draft made payable to yourself, and this applies  to a check, until you are about to use it.    It is a good plan never to sign your name until it is actually  necessary.    Some people have the foolish habit of signing their names on stray  bits of paper.    Do not get into this habit, even if there is no space to fill out  a note or order above the signature.          CHAPTER XII    JUST MONEY        As has been before stated, money in its broadest meaning is a  medium of exchange.    Anything that can pay a debt or purchase property, in any part of  a country, is the money of that country.    Every civilized country has its own minted or printed money.    The usual mediums of circulation are gold, silver, nickel and  copper, the latter alloyed more or less in the United States with  nickel.    Government and bank bills, while having all the purchasing power  of gold, are simply promises to pay in gold, or other coin of  \"redemption\", the amounts they represent.    The money of one country cannot legally be made to pay a debt in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6168"],[0,"Fifty Famous People: A Book of Short Stories (#9)"],[1,"planned to make a great feast  for the lad. The tables were to be laden with all kinds of food.  There was to be music and dancing; and Cyrus was to invite as many  guests as he chose. The hour for the feast came. Everything was ready.  The servants were there, dressed in fine uniforms. The musicians and  dancers were in their places. But no guests came.    \"How is this, my dear boy?\" asked the king. \"The feast is ready, but  no one has come to partake of it.\"    \"That is because I have not invited any one,\" said Cyrus.\" In Persia  we do not have such feasts. If any one is hungry, he eats some bread  and meat, with perhaps a few cresses, and that is the end of it. We  never go to all this trouble and expense of making a fine dinner in  order that our friends may eat what is not good for them.\"    King Astyages did not know whether to be pleased or displeased.    \"Well,\" said he, \"all these rich foods that were prepared for the feast  are yours. What will you do with them?\"    \"I think I will give them to our friends,\" said Cyrus.    So he gave one portion to the king's officer who had taught him to  ride. Another portion he gave to an old servant who waited upon his  grandfather. And the rest he divided among the young women who took  care of his mother.        II      The king's cupbearer, Sarcas, was very much offended because he was  not given a share of the feast. The king also wondered why this man,  who was his favorite, should be so slighted.    \"Why didn't you give something to Sarcas?\" he asked.    \"Well, truly,\" said Cyrus, \"I do not like him. He is proud and  overbearing. He thinks that he makes a fine figure when he waits on  you.\" \"And so he does,\" said the king. \"He is very skillful as a  cupbearer.\" \"That may be so,\" answered Cyrus, \"but if you will let me  be your cupbearer tomorrow, I think I can serve you quite as well.\"    King Astyages smiled. He saw that Cyrus had a will of his own, and  this pleased him very much.    \"I shall be glad to see what you can do,\" he said. \"Tomorrow, you shall  be the king's cupbearer.\"        III      You would hardly have known the young prince when the time came for  him to appear before his grandfather. He was dressed in the rich  uniform of the cupbearer, and he came forward with much dignity and  grace.    He carried a white napkin upon his arm, and held the cup of wine very  daintily with three of his fingers.    [Illustration]    His manners were perfect. Sarcas himself could not have served the  king half so well.    \"Bravo! bravo!\" cried his mother, her eyes sparkling with pride.    \"You have done well\" said his grandfather. \"But you neglected one  important thing. It is the rule and custom of the cupbearer to pour  out a little of the wine and taste it before handing the cup to me.  This you forgot to do.\"    \"Indeed, grandfather, I did not forget it,\" answered Cyrus.    \"Then why didn't you do it?\" asked his mother.    \"Because I believed there was poison in the wine.\"    \"Poison, my boy!\" cried King Astyages, much alarmed. \"Poison! poison!\"    \"Yes, grandfather, poison. For the other day, when you sat at dinner  with your officers, I noticed that the wine made you act queerly. After  the guests had drunk quite a little of it, they began to talk foolishly  and sing loudly; and some of them went to sleep. And you, grandfather,  were as bad as the rest. You forgot that you were king. You forgot all  your good manners. You tried to dance and fell upon the floor. I am  afraid to drink anything that makes men act in that way.\"    \"Didn't you ever see your father behave so?\" asked the king.    \"No, never,\" said Cyrus. \"He does not drink merely to be drinking. He  drinks to quench his thirst, and that is all.\"    When Cyrus became a man, he succeeded his father as king of Persia;  he also succeeded his grandfather Astyages as king of Media. He was  a very wise and powerful ruler, and he made his country the greatest  of any that was then known. In history he is commonly called Cyrus  the Great.          THE SONS OF THE CALIPH        There was a caliph of Persia whose name was Al Mamoun. [Footnote: Al  Mam'oun] He had two sons whom he wished to become honest and noble  men. So he employed a wise man whose name was Al Farra to be their  teacher. One day, after lesson hours, Al Farra rose to go out of the  house. The two boys saw him and ran to fetch his shoes. For in that  country, people never wear shoes in the house, but take them off at  the door. The two boys ran for the teacher's shoes, and each claimed  the honor of carrying them to him. But they dared not quarrel and at  last agreed that each should carry one shoe. Thus the honor would be  divided. When the caliph heard of this he sent for Al Farra and asked  him, \"Who is the most honored of men?\"    The teacher answered, \"I know of no man who is more honored than  yourself.\"    \"No, no,\" said the caliph. \"It is the man who rose to go out, and two  young princes contended for the honor of giving him his shoes but at  last agreed that each should offer him one.\"    Al Farra answered, \"Sir, I should have forbidden them to do this, but  I feared to discourage them. I hope that I shall never do anything to  make them careless of their duties.\"    \"Well,\" said the caliph, \"if you had forbidden them thus to honor you,  I should have declared you in the wrong. They did nothing that was  beneath the dignity of princes. Indeed, they honored themselves by  honoring you.\" Al Farra bowed low, but said nothing; and the caliph  went on. \"No young man nor boy,\" said he, \"can be so high in rank as  to neglect three great duties: he must respect his ruler, he must love  and obey his father, and he must honor his teacher.\"    Then he called the two young princes to him, and as a reward for their  noble conduct, filled their pockets with gold.          THE BOY AND THE ROBBERS        In Persia, when Cyrus the Great was king, boys were taught to tell the  truth. This was one of their first lessons at home and at school.    \"None but a coward will tell a falsehood,\" said the father of young  Otanes. [Footnote: Otanes (_pro._ o ta'n ez).]    \"Truth is beautiful. Always love it,\" said his mother.    When Otanes was twelve years old, his parents wished to send him to  a distant city to study in a famous school that was there. It would  be a long journey and a dangerous one. So it was arranged that the boy  should travel with a small company of merchants who were going  to the same place. \"Good-by, Otanes! Be always brave and truthful,\"  said his father. \"Farewell, my child! Love that which is beautiful.  Despise that which is base,\" said his mother.    The little company began its long journey. Some of the men rode on  camels, some on horses. They went but slowly, for the sun was hot and  the way was rough.    Suddenly, towards evening, a band of robbers swooped down upon them.  The merchants were not fighting men. They could do nothing but give  up all their goods and money.    \"Well, boy, what have you got?\" asked one of the robbers, as he pulled  Otanes from his horse.    \"Forty pieces of gold\" answered the lad.    The robber laughed. He had never heard of a boy with so much money as  that.    \"That is a good story\" he said. \"Where do you carry your gold?\"    \"It is in my hat, underneath the lining,\" answered Otanes.    \"Oh, well! You can't make me believe that,\" said the robber; and he  hurried away to rob one of the rich merchants.    Soon another came up and said, \"My boy, do you happen to have any gold  about you?\"    \"Yes! Forty pieces, in my hat, said Otanes.    \"You are a brave lad to be joking with robbers\" said the man; and he  also hurried on to a more promising field.    At length the chief of the band called to Otanes and said, \"Young  fellow, have you anything worth taking?\"    Otanes answered, \"I have already told two of your men that I have forty  pieces of gold in my hat. But they wouldn't believe me.\"    \"Take off your hat,\" said the chief.    [Illustration]    The boy obeyed. The chief tore out the lining and found the gold hidden  beneath it.    \"Why did you tell us where to find it?\" he asked. \"No one would have  thought that a child like you had gold about him.\"    \"If I had answered your questions differently, I should have told a  lie,\" said Otanes; \"and none but cowards tell lies\"    The robber chief was struck by this answer. He thought of the number  of times that he himself had been a coward. Then he said, \"You are a  brave boy, and you may keep your gold. Here it is. Mount your horse,  and my own men will ride with you and see that you reach the end of  your journey in safety.\"    Otanes, in time, became one of the famous men of his country. He was  the advisor and friend of two of the kings who succeeded Cyrus.        A LESSON IN JUSTICE    Alexander [Footnote: Al ex an'der.] the king of Macedon, [Footnote:  Macedon (pro. mas'e don).] wished to become the master of the whole  world. He led his armies through many countries. He plundered cities,  he burned towns, he destroyed thousands of lives.    At last, far in the East, he came to a land of which he had never  heard. The people there knew nothing about war and conquest. Although  they were rich, they lived simply and were at peace with all the world.    The shah, or ruler of these people, went out to meet Alexander and  welcome him to their country. He led the great king to his palace and  begged that he would dine with him.    When they were seated at the table the servants of the shah stood by  to serve the meal. They brought in what seemed to be fruits, nuts,  cakes, and other delicacies; but when Alexander would eat he found  that everything was made of gold.    \"What!\" said he, \"do you eat gold in this country?\"    \"We ourselves eat only common food,\" answered the shah. \"But we have  heard that it was the desire for gold which caused you to leave your  own country; and so, we wish to satisfy your appetite.\"    \"It was not for"]]]
