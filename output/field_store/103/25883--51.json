[Footnote: Pos-ei'don, another name for Neptune, the sea-god.]      In the old oak a Dryad dwelt;    The fingers of a nymph were felt        In the fine-rippled flood;    At drowsy noon, when all was still,    Faunus lay sleeping on the hill,    And strange and bright-eyed gamesome creatures,    With hairy limbs and goat-like features,        Peered from the prickly wood.      [Footnote: The Sa'tyrs.]      Thus every power that zones the sphere    With forms of beauty and of fear,    In starry sky, on grassy ground,    And in the fishy brine profound,    Were, to the hoar Pelasgic men    That peopled erst each Grecian glen,    GODS--or the actions of a god:    Gods were in every sight and sound    And every spot was hallowed ground    Where these far-wandering patriarchs trod.    But all this fairy world has passed away, to live only as shadows  in the realms of fancy and of song. SCHILLER gives expression to  the poet's lament in the following lines:      Art thou, fair world, no more?      Return, thou virgin-bloom on Nature's face!    Ah, only on the minstrel's magic shore      Can we the footsteps of sweet Fable trace!    The meadows mourn for the old hallowing life;      Vainly we search the earth, of gods bereft;    Where once the warm and living shapes were rife      Shadows alone are left.    The Latin poet OV'ID, who lived at the time of the Christian era,  has collected from the fictions of the early Greeks and Oriental  nations, and woven into one continuous history, the pagan accounts  of the Creation, embracing a description of the primeval world,  and the early changes it underwent, followed by a history of the  four eras or ages of primitive mankind, the deluge of Deuca'lion,  and then onward down to the time of Augustus Caesar. This great  work of the pagan poet, called The Metamorphoses, is not only the  most curious and valuable record extant of ancient mythology, but  some have thought they discovered, in every story it contains, a  moral allegory; while others have attempted to trace in it the  whole history of the Old Testament, and types of the miracles and  sufferings of our Savior. But, however little of truth there may  be in the last of these suppositions, the beautiful and impressive  account of the Creation given by this poet, of the Four Ages of  man's history which followed, and of the Deluge, coincides in so  many remarkable respects with the Bible narrative, and with  geological and other records, that we give it here as a specimen  of Grecian fable that contains some traces of true history. The  translation is by Dryden:      Account of the Creation.      Before the seas, and this terrestrial ball,    And heaven's high canopy, that covers all,    One was the face of Nature--if a face--    Rather, a rude and indigested mass;    A lifeless lump, unfashioned and unframed,    Of jarring elements, and CHAOS named.      No sun was lighted up the world to view,    Nor moon did yet her blunted horns renew,    Nor yet was earth suspended in the sky,    Nor, poised, did on her own foundations lie,    Nor seas about the shores their arms had thrown;    But earth, and air, and water were in one.    Thus air was void of light, and earth unstable,    And water's dark abyss unnavigable.    No certain form on any was impressed;    All were confused, and each disturbed the rest.      Thus disembroiled they take their proper place;    The next of kin contiguously embrace,    And foes are sundered by a larger space.    The force of fire ascended first on high,    And took its dwelling in the vaulted sky;    Then air succeeds, in lightness next to fire,    Whose atoms from inactive earth retire;    Earth sinks beneath and draws a numerous throng    Of ponderous, thick, unwieldy seeds along.    About her coasts unruly waters roar,    And, rising on a ridge, insult the shore.    Thus when the god--whatever god was he--    Had formed the whole, and made the parts agree,    That no unequal portions might be found,    He moulded earth into a spacious round;    Then, with a breath, he gave the winds to blow,    And bade the congregated waters flow.    He adds the running springs and standing lakes,    And bounding banks for winding rivers makes.    Some parts in earth are swallowed up; the most,    In ample oceans disembogued, are lost.    He shades the woods, the valleys he restrains    With rocky mountains, and extends the plains.      Then, every void of nature to supply,    With forms of gods Jove fills the vacant sky;    New herds of beasts sends the plains to share;    New colonies of birds to people air;    And to their cozy beds the finny fish repair.    A creature of a more exalted kind    Was wanting yet, and then was Man designed;    Conscious of thought, of more capacious breast,    For empire formed and fit to rule the rest;    Whether with particles of heavenly fire    The God of nature did his soul inspire,    Or earth, but new divided from the sky,    And pliant, still retained the ethereal energy.    Thus while the mute creation downward bend    Their sight, and to their earthly mother tend,    Man looks aloft, and with erected eyes    Beholds his own hereditary skies.      FOUR AGES OF MAN.    The poet now describes the Ages, or various epochs in the  civilization of the human race. The first is the Golden Age, a  period of patriarchal simplicity, when Earth yielded her fruits  spontaneously, and spring was eternal.      The GOLDEN AGE was first, when man, yet new,    No rule but uncorrupted reason knew,    And, with a native bent, did good pursue.    Unforced by punishment, unawed by fear.    His words were simple and his soul sincere;    Needless were written laws where none oppressed;    The law of man was written on his breast.    No suppliant crowds before the judge appeared,    No court erected yet, nor cause was heard,    But all was safe, for conscience was their guard.      No walls were yet, nor fence, nor moat, nor mound;    Nor drum was heard, nor trumpet's angry sound;    Nor swords were forged; but, void of care and crime,    The soft creation slept away their time.    The teeming earth, yet guiltless of the plough,    And unprovoked, did fruitful stores allow;    The flowers, unsown, in fields and meadows reigned,    And western winds immortal spring maintained.    The next; or the Silver Age, was marked by the change of seasons,  and the division and cultivation of lands.      Succeeding times a SILVER AGE behold,    Excelling brass, but more excelled by gold.    Then summer, autumn, winter did appear,    And spring was but a season of the year;    The sun his annual course obliquely made,    Good days contracted, and enlarged the bad.    Then air with sultry heats began to glow,    The wings of wind were clogged with ice and snow;    And shivering mortals, into houses driven,    Sought shelter from the inclemency of heaven.    Those houses then were caves or homely sheds,    With twining osiers fenced, and moss their beds.    Then ploughs for seed the fruitful furrows broke,    And oxen labored first beneath the yoke.    Then followed the Brazen Age, which was an epoch of war and  violence.      To this came next in course the BRAZEN AGE;    A warlike offspring, prompt to bloody rage,    Not impious yet.    According to He'siod, the next age is the Heroic, in which the  world began to aspire toward better things; but OVID omits this  altogether, and gives, as the fourth and last, the Iron Age, also  called the Plutonian Age, full of all sorts of hardships and  wickedness. His description of it is as follows:                 Hard steel succeeded then,    And stubborn as the metal were the men.    Truth, Modesty, and Shame the world forsook;    Fraud, Avarice, and Force their places took.    Then sails were spread to every wind that blew;    Raw were the sailors, and the depths were new:    Trees rudely hollowed did the waves sustain,    Ere ships in triumph plough'd the watery plain.        Then landmarks limited to each his right;    For all before was common as the light.    Nor was the ground alone required to bear    Her annual income to the crooked share;    But greedy mortals, rummaging her store,    Digged from her entrails first the precious ore;    (Which next to hell the prudent gods had laid),    And that alluring ill to sight displayed:    Thus cursed steel, and more accursed gold,    Gave mischief birth, and made that mischief bold;    And double death did wretched man invade,    By steel assaulted, and by gold betrayed.    Now ("]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6852"],[0,"Venus in Furs (#9)"],[1," Well, which do you prefer?\"    \"I believe that everything my imagination has dreamed lies latent in  your personality.\"    \"You are mistaken.\"    \"I believe,\" I continued, \"that you enjoy having a man wholly in  your power, torturing him--\"    \"No, no,\" she exclaimed quickly, \"or perhaps--.\" She pondered.    \"I don't understand myself any longer,\" she continued, \"but I have  a confession to make to you. You have corrupted my imagination and  inflamed my blood. I am beginning to like the things you speak of.  The enthusiasm with which you speak of a Pompadour, a Catherine the  Second, and all the other selfish, frivolous, cruel women, carries  me away and takes hold of my soul. It urges me on to become like those  women, who in spite of their vileness were slavishly adored during  their lifetime and still exert a miraculous power from their graves.    \"You will end by making of me a despot in miniature, a domestic  Pompadour.\"    \"Well then,\" I said in agitation, \"if all this is inherent in you,  give way to this trend of your nature. Nothing half-way. If you can't  be a true and loyal wife to me, be a demon.\"    I was nervous from loss of sleep, and the proximity of the beautiful  woman affected me like a fever. I no longer recall what I said, but  I remember that I kissed her feet, and finally raised her foot and  put my neck under it. She withdrew it quickly, and rose almost angrily.    \"If you love me, Severin,\" she said quickly, and her voice sounded  sharp and commanding, \"never speak to me of those things again.  Understand, never! Otherwise I might really--\" She smiled and sat  down again.    \"I am entirely serious,\" I exclaimed, half-raving. \"I adore you so  infinitely that I am willing to suffer anything from you, for the  sake of spending my whole life near you.\"    \"Severin, once more I warn you.\"    \"Your warning is vain. Do with me what you will, as long as you  don't drive me away.\"    \"Severin,\" replied Wanda, \"I am a frivolous young woman; it is  dangerous for you to put yourself so completely in my power. You will  end by actually becoming a plaything to me. Who will give warrant  that I shall not abuse your insane desire?\"    \"Your own nobility of character.\"    \"Power makes people over-bearing.\"    \"Be it,\" I cried, \"tread me underfoot.\"    Wanda threw her arms around my neck, looked into my eyes, and shook  her head.    \"I am afraid I can't, but I will try, for your sake, for I love you  Severin, as I have loved no other man.\"           *       *       *       *       *    To-day she suddenly took her hat and shawl, and I had to go shopping  with her. She looked at whips, long whips with a short handle, the  kind that are used on dogs.    \"Are these satisfactory?\" said the shopkeeper.    \"No, they are much too small,\" replied Wanda, with a side-glance at  me. \"I need a large--\"    \"For a bull-dog, I suppose?\" opined the merchant.    \"Yes,\" she exclaimed, \"of the kind that are used in Russia for  intractable slaves.\"    She looked further and finally selected a whip, at whose sight I  felt a strange creeping sensation.    \"Now good-by, Severin,\" she said. \"I have some other purchases to  make, but you can't go along.\"    I left her and took a walk. On the way back I saw Wanda coming out  at a furrier's. She beckoned me.    \"Consider it well,\" she began in good spirits, \"I have never made a  secret of how deeply your serious, dreamy character has fascinated  me. The idea of seeing this serious man wholly in my power, actually  lying enraptured at my feet, of course, stimulates me--but will this  attraction last? Woman loves a man; she maltreats a slave, and ends  by kicking him aside.\"    \"Very well then, kick me aside,\" I replied, \"when you are tired of  me. I want to be your slave.\"    \"Dangerous forces lie within me,\" said Wanda, after we had gone a  few steps further. \"You awaken them, and not to your advantage. You  know how to paint pleasure, cruelty, arrogance in glowing colors.  What would you say should I try my hand at them, and make you the  first object of my experiments. I would be like Dionysius who had the  inventor of the iron ox roasted within it in order to see whether his  wails and groans really resembled the bellowing of an ox.    \"Perhaps I am a female Dionysius?\"    \"Be it,\" I exclaimed, \"and my dreams will be fulfilled. I am yours  for good or evil, choose. The destiny that lies concealed within my  breast drives me on--demoniacally--relentlessly.\"    \"My Beloved,    I do not care to see you to-day or to-morrow, and not until evening  the day after tomorrow, and then _as my slave_.    Your mistress    Wanda.\"    \"As my slave\" was underlined. I read the note which I received early  in the morning a second time. Then I had a donkey saddled, an animal  symbolic of learned professors, and rode into the mountains. I wanted  to numb my desire, my yearning, with the magnificent scenery of the  Carpathians. I am back, tired, hungry, thirsty, and more in love than  ever. I quickly change my clothes, and a few moments later knock at  her door.    \"Come in!\"    I enter. She is standing in the center of the room, dressed in a gown  of white satin which floods down her body like light. Over it she  wears a scarlet _kazabaika_, richly edged with ermine. Upon her  powdered, snowy hair is a little diadem of diamonds. She stands with  her arms folded across her breast, and with her brows contracted.    \"Wanda!\" I run toward her, and am about to throw my arm about her to  kiss her. She retreats a step, measuring me from top to bottom.    \"Slave!\"    \"Mistress!\" I kneel down, and kiss the hem of her garment.    \"That is as it should be.\"    \"Oh, how beautiful you are.\"    \"Do I please you?\" She stepped before the mirror, and looked at  herself with proud satisfaction.    \"I shall become mad!\"    Her lower lip twitched derisively, and she looked at me mockingly  from behind half-closed lids.    \"Give me the whip.\"    I looked about the room.    \"No,\" she exclaimed, \"stay as you are, kneeling.\" She went over to  the fire-place, took the whip from the mantle-piece, and, watching  me with a smile, let it hiss through the air; then she slowly rolled  up the sleeve of her fur-jacket.    \"Marvellous woman!\" I exclaimed.    \"Silence, slave!\" She suddenly scowled, looked savage, and struck me  with the whip. A moment later she threw her arm tenderly about me, and  pityingly bent down to me. \"Did I hurt you?\" she asked, half-shyly,  half-timidly.    \"No,\" I replied, \"and even if you had, pains that come through you  are a joy. Strike again, if it gives you pleasure.\"    \"But it doesn't give me pleasure.\"    Again I was seized with that strange intoxication.    \"Whip me,\" I begged, \"whip me without mercy.\"    Wanda swung the whip, and hit me twice. \"Are you satisfied now?\"    \"No.\"    \"Seriously, no?\"    \"Whip me, I beg you, it is a joy to me.\"    \"Yes, because you know very well that it isn't serious,\" she  replied, \"because I haven't the heart to hurt you. This brutal game  goes against my grain. Were I really the woman who beats her slaves  you would be horrified.\"    \"No, Wanda,\" I replied, \"I love you more than myself; I am devoted  to you for death and life. In all seriousness, you can do with me  whatever you will, whatever your caprice suggests.\"    \"Severin!\"    \"Tread me underfoot!\" I exclaimed, and flung myself face to the  floor before her.    \"I hate all this play-acting,\" said Wanda impatiently.    \"Well, then maltreat me seriously.\"    An uncanny pause.    \"Severin, I warn you for the last time,\" began Wanda.    \"If you love me, be cruel towards me,\" I pleaded with upraised eyes.    \"If I love you,\" repeated Wanda. \"Very well!\" She stepped back and  looked at me with a sombre smile. _\"Be then my slave, and know what  it means to be delivered into the hands of a woman.\"_ And at the  same moment she gave me a kick.    \"How do you like that, slave?\"    Then she flourished the whip.    \"Get up!\"    I was about to rise.    \"Not that way,\" she commanded, \"on your knees.\"    I obeyed, and she began to apply the lash.    The blows fell rapidly and powerfully on my back and arms. Each one  cut into my flesh and burned there, but the pains enraptured me. They  came from her whom I adored, and for whom I was ready at any hour to  lay down my life.    She stopped. \"I am beginning to enjoy it,\" she said, \"but enough for  to-day. I am beginning to feel a demonic curiosity to see how far  your strength goes. I take a cruel joy in seeing you tremble and  writhe beneath my whip, and in hearing your groans and wails; I want  to go on whipping without pity until you beg for mercy, until you  lose your senses. You have awakened dangerous elements in my being.  But now get up.\"    I seized her hand to press it to my lips.    \"What impudence.\"    She shoved me away with her foot.    \"Out of my sight, slave!\"           *       *       *       *       *    After having spent a feverish night filled with confused dreams, I  awoke. Dawn was just beginning to break.    How much of what was hovering in my memory was true; what had I  actually experienced and what had I dreamed? That I had been whipped  was certain. I can still feel each blow, and count the burning red  stripes on my body. And _she_ whipped me. Now I know everything.    My dream has become truth. How does it make me feel? Am I  disappointed in the realization of my dream?    No, I am merely somewhat tired, but her cruelty has enraptured me.  Oh, how I love her, adore her! All this cannot express in the  remotest way my feeling for her, my complete devotion to her. What  happiness to be her slave!           *       *       *       *       *    She calls to me from her balcony. I hurry upstairs. She is standing  on the threshold, holding out her hand in friendly fashion. \"I am  ashamed of myself,\" she says, while I embrace her, and she hides her  head against my breast.    \"Why?\"    \"Please try to forget the ugly scene of yesterday,\" she said"]]]
