SPARTANS    Not that, O surely not that, never that.    LYSISTRATA    Agree! Now what are two legs more or less?    ATHENIANS    I want to strip at once and plough my land.    SPARTANS    And mine I want to fertilize at once.    LYSISTRATA    And so you can, when Peace is once declared.  If you mean it, get your allies' heads together  And come to some decision.    ATHENIANS    What allies?  There's no distinction in our politics:  We've risen as one man to this conclusion;  Every ally is jumping-mad to drive it home.    SPARTANS    And ours the same, for sure.    ATHENIANS    The Carystians first!  I'll bet on that.    LYSISTRATA    I agree with all of you.  Now off, and cleanse yourselves for the Acropolis,  For we invite you all in to a supper  From our commissariat baskets. There at table  You will pledge good behaviour and uprightness;  Then each man's wife is his to hustle home.    ATHENIANS    Come, as quickly as possible.    SPARTANS    As quick as ye like.  Lead on.    ATHENIANS    O Zeus, quick, quick, lead quickly on.  _They hurry off._    CHORUS.    Broidered stuffs on high I'm heaping,  Fashionable cloaks and sweeping  Trains, not even gold gawds keeping.  Take them all, I pray you, take them all (I do not care)  And deck your children--your daughter, if the Basket she's to bear.  Come, everyone of you, come in and take  Of this rich hoard a share.  Nought's tied so skilfully  But you its seal can break  And plunder all you spy inside.  I've laid out all that I can spare,  And therefore you will see  Nothing unless than I you're sharper-eyed.  If lacking corn a man should be  While his slaves clamour hungrily  And his excessive progeny,  Then I've a handfull of grain at home which is always to be had,  And to which in fact a more-than-life-size loaf I'd gladly add.  Then let the poor bring with them bag or sack  And take this store of food.  Manes, my man, I'll tell  To help them all to pack  Their wallets full. But O take care.  I had forgotten; don't intrude,  Or terrified you'll yell.  My dog is hungry too, and bites--beware!    Some _LOUNGERS_ from the Market with torches approach  the Banqueting hall. The _PORTER_ bars their entrance.    1ST MARKET-LOUNGER    Open the door.    PORTER    Here move along.    1ST MARKET-LOUNGER    What's this?  You're sitting down. Shall I singe you with my torch?  That's vulgar! O I couldn't do it ... yet  If it would gratify the audience,  I'll mortify myself.    2ND MARKET-LOUNGER    And I will too.  We'll both be crude and vulgar, yes we will.    PORTER    Be off at once now or you'll be wailing  Dirges for your hair. Get off at once,  And see you don't disturb the Spartan envoys  Just coming out from the splendid feast they've had.    _The banqueters begin to come out._    1ST ATHENIAN    I've never known such a pleasant banquet before,  And what delightful fellows the Spartans are.  When we are warm with wine, how wise we grow.    2ND ATHENIAN    That's only fair, since sober we're such fools:  This is the advice I'd give the Athenians--  See our ambassadors are always drunk.  For when we visit Sparta sober, then  We're on the alert for trickery all the while  So that we miss half of the things they say,  And misinterpret things that were never said,  And then report the muddle back to Athens.  But now we're charmed with each other. They might cap  With the Telamon-catch instead of the Cleitagora,  And we'd applaud and praise them just the same;  We're not too scrupulous in weighing words.    PORTER    Why, here the rascals come again to plague me.  Won't you move on, you sorry loafers there!    MARKET-LOUNGER    Yes, by Zeus, they're already coming out.    SPARTANS    Now hinnie dearest, please tak' up your pipe  That I may try a spring an' sing my best  In honour o' the Athenians an' oursels.    ATHENIANS    Aye, take your pipe. By all the gods, there's nothing  Could glad my heart more than to watch you dance.    SPARTANS.    Mnemosyne,  Let thy fire storm these younkers,  O tongue wi' stormy ecstasy  My Muse that knows  Our deeds and theirs, how when at sea  Their navies swooped upon  The Medes at Artemision--  Gods for their courage, did they strike  Wrenching a triumph frae their foes;  While at Thermopylae  Leonidas' army stood: wild-boars they were like  Wild-boars that wi' fierce threat  Their terrible tusks whet;  The sweat ran streaming down each twisted face,  Faen blossoming i' strange petals o' death  Panted frae mortal breath,  The sweat drenched a' their bodies i' that place,  For the hurly-burly o' Persians glittered more  Than the sands on the shore.    Come, Hunting Girl, an' hear my prayer--  You whose arrows whizz in woodlands, come an' bless  This Peace we swear.  Let us be fenced wi' age long amity,  O let this bond stick ever firm through thee  In friendly happiness.  Henceforth no guilefu' perjury be seen!  O hither, hither O  Thou wildwood queen.    LYSISTRATA    Earth is delighted now, peace is the voice of earth.  Spartans, sort out your wives: Athenians, yours.  Let each catch hands with his wife and dance his joy,  Dance out his thanks, be grateful in music,  And promise reformation with his heels.    ATHENIANS.    O Dancers, forward. Lead out the Graces,  Call Artemis out;  Then her brother, the Dancer of Skies,  That gracious Apollo.  Invoke with a shout  Dionysus out of whose eyes  Breaks fire on the maenads that follow;  And Zeus with his flares of quick lightning, and call,  Happy Hera, Queen of all,  And all the Daimons summon hither to be  Witnesses of our revelry  And of the noble Peace we have made,  Aphrodite our aid.  Io Paieon, Io, cry--  For victory, leap!  Attained by me, leap!  Euoi Euoi Euai Euai.    SPARTANS    Piper, gie us the music for a new sang.    SPARTANS.    Leaving again lovely lofty Taygetus  Hither O Spartan Muse, hither to greet us,  And wi' our choric voice to raise  To Amyclean Apollo praise,  And Tyndareus' gallant sons whose days  Alang Eurotas' banks merrily pass,  An' Athene o' the House o' Brass.    Now the dance begin;  Dance, making swirl your fringe o' woolly skin,  While we join voices  To hymn dear Sparta that rejoices  I' a beautifu' sang,  An' loves to see  Dancers tangled beautifully;  For the girls i' tumbled ranks  Alang Eurotas' banks  Like wanton fillies thrang,  Frolicking there  An' like Bacchantes shaking the wild air  To comb a giddy laughter through the hair,  Bacchantes that clench thyrsi as they sweep  To the ecstatic leap.    An' Helen, Child o' Leda, come  Thou holy, nimble, gracefu' Queen,  Lead thou the dance, gather thy joyous tresses up i' bands  An' play like a fawn. To madden them, clap thy hands,  And sing praise to the warrior goddess templed i' our lands,  Her o' the House o' Brass."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/775"],[0,"When the Sleeper Wakes (#9)"],[1,"of the galleries, and  the great structural lines of the interior. The facile grace of these  panels enhanced the mighty white effort that laboured in the centre  of the scheme. Graham's eyes came back to the Council, and Howard  was descending the steps. As he drew nearer his features could be  distinguished, and Graham saw that he was flushed and blowing out his  cheeks. His countenance was still disturbed when presently he reappeared  along the gallery.    \"This way,\" he said concisely, and they went on in silence to a little  door that opened at their approach. The two men in red stopped on either  side of this door. Howard and Graham passed in, and Graham, glancing  back, saw the white-robed Council still standing in a close group and  looking at him. Then the door closed behind him with a heavy thud, and  for the first time since his awakening he was in silence. The floor,  even, was noiseless to his feet.    Howard opened another door, and they were in the first of two contiguous  chambers furnished in white and green. \"What Council was that?\" began  Graham. \"What were they discussing? What have they to do with me?\"  Howard closed the door carefully, heaved a huge sigh, and said something  in an undertone. He walked slanting ways across the room and turned,  blowing out his cheeks again. \"Ugh!\" he grunted, a man relieved.    Graham stood regarding him.    \"You must understand,\" began Howard abruptly, avoiding Graham's eyes,  \"that our social order is very complex. A half explanation, a bare  unqualified statement would give you false impressions. As a matter of  fact--it is a case of compound interest partly--your small fortune, and  the fortune of your cousin Warming which was left to you--and certain  other beginnings--have become very considerable. And in other ways  that will be hard for you to understand, you have become a person of  significance--of very considerable significance--involved in the world's  affairs.\"    He stopped.    \"Yes?\" said Graham.    \"We have grave social troubles.\"    \"Yes?\"    \"Things have come to such a pass that, in fact, is advisable to seclude  you here.\"    \"Keep me prisoner!\" exclaimed Graham.    \"Well--to ask you to keep in seclusion.\"    Graham turned on him. \"This is strange!\" he said.    \"No harm will be done you.\"    \"No harm!\"    \"But you must be kept here--\"    \"While I learn my position, I presume.\"    \"Precisely.\"    \"Very well then. Begin. Why _harm?_\"    \"Not now.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"It is too long a story, Sire.\"    \"All the more reason I should begin at once. You say I am a person of  importance. What was that shouting I heard? Why is a great multitude  shouting and excited because my trance is over, and who are the men in  white in that huge council chamber?\"    \"All in good time, Sire,\" said Howard. \"But not crudely, not crudely.  This is one of those flimsy times when no man has a settled mind. Your  awakening. No one expected your awakening. The Council is consulting.\"    \"What council?\"    \"The Council you saw.\"    Graham made a petulant movement. \"This is not right,\" he said. \"I should  be told what is happening.    \"You must wait. Really you must wait.\"    Graham sat down abruptly. \"I suppose since I have waited so long to  resume life,\" he said, \"that I must wait a little longer.\"    \"That is better,\" said Howard. \"Yes, that is much better. And I must  leave you alone. For a space. While I attend the discussion in the  Council. I am sorry.\"    He went towards the noiseless door, hesitated and vanished.    Graham walked to the door, tried it, found it securely fastened in  some way he never came to understand, turned about, paced the room  restlessly, made the circuit of the room, and sat down. He remained  sitting for some time with folded arms and knitted brow, biting his  finger nails and trying to piece together the kaleidoscopic impressions  of this first hour of awakened life; the vast mechanical spaces, the  endless series of chambers and passages, the great struggle that roared  and splashed through these strange ways, the little group of remote  unsympathetic men beneath the colossal Atlas, Howard's mysterious  behaviour. There was an inkling of some vast inheritance already in  his mind--a vast inheritance perhaps misapplied--of some unprecedented  importance and opportunity. What had he to do? And this room's secluded  silence was eloquent of imprisonment!    It came into Graham's mind with irresistible conviction that this series  of magnificent impressions was a dream. He tried to shut his eyes and  succeeded, but that time-honoured device led to no awakening.    Presently he began to touch and examine all the unfamiliar appointments  of the two small rooms in which he found himself.    In a long oval panel of mirror he saw himself and stopped astonished. He  was clad in a graceful costume of purple and bluish white, with a little  greyshot beard trimmed to a point, and his hair, its blackness streaked  now with bands of grey, arranged over his forehead in an unfamiliar but  graceful manner. He seemed a man of five-and-forty perhaps. For a moment  he did not perceive this was himself.    A flash of laughter came with the recognition. \"To call on old Warming  like this!\" he exclaimed, \"and make him take me out to lunch!\"    Then he thought of meeting first one and then another of the few  familiar acquaintances of his early manhood, and in the midst of his  amusement realised that every soul with whom he might jest had died  many score of years ago. The thought smote him abruptly and keenly;  he stopped short, the expression of his face changed to a white  consternation.    The tumultuous memory of the moving platforms and the huge facade of  that wonderful street reasserted itself. The shouting multitudes came  back clear and vivid, and those remote, inaudible, unfriendly councilors  in white. He felt himself a little figure, very small and ineffectual,  pitifully conspicuous. And all about him, the world was--strange.        CHAPTER VII. IN THE SILENT ROOMS    Presently Graham resumed his examination of his apartments. Curiosity  kept him moving in spite of his fatigue. The inner room, he perceived,  was high, and its ceiling dome shaped, with an oblong aperture in the  centre, opening into a funnel in which a wheel of broad fans seemed to  be rotating, apparently driving the air up the shaft. The faint humming  note of its easy motion was the only clear sound in that quiet place. As  these vans sprang up one after the other, Graham could get transient  glimpses of the sky. He was surprised to see a star.    This drew his attention to the fact that the bright lighting of these  rooms was due to a multitude of very faint glow lamps set about the  cornices. There were no windows. And he began to recall that along  all the vast chambers and passages he had traversed with Howard he had  observed no windows at all. Had there been windows? There were windows  on the street indeed, but were they for light? Or was the whole city lit  day and night for evermore, so that there was no night there?    And another thing dawned upon him. There was no fireplace in either  room. Was the season summer, and were these merely summer apartments, or  was the whole City uniformly heated or cooled? He became interested in  these questions, began examining the smooth texture of the walls, the  simply constructed bed, the ingenious arrangements by which the labour  of bedroom service was practically abolished. And over everything was a  curious absence of deliberate ornament, a bare grace of form and  colour, that he found very pleasing to the eye. There were several very  comfortable chairs, a light table on silent runners carrying several  bottles of fluids and glasses, and two plates bearing a clear substance  like jelly. Then he noticed there were no books, no newspapers, no  writing materials. \"The world has changed indeed,\" he said.    He observed one entire side of the outer room was set with rows of  peculiar double cylinders inscribed with green lettering on white that  harmonized with the decorative scheme of the room, and in the centre of  this side projected a little apparatus about a yard square and having a  white smooth face to the room. A chair faced this. He had a transitory  idea that these cylinders might be books, or a modern substitute for  books, but at first it did not seem so.    The lettering on the cylinders puzzled him. At first sight it seemed  like Russian. Then he noticed a suggestion of mutilated English about  certain of the words.                       \"oi Man huwdbi Kin\"    forced itself on him as \"The Man who would be King.\" \"Phonetic  spelling,\" he said. He remembered reading a story with that title, then  he recalled the story vividly, one of the best stories in the world. But  this thing before him was not a book as he understood it. He puzzled out  the titles of two adjacent cylinders. 'The Heart of Darkness,' he had  never heard of before nor 'The Madonna of the Future'--no doubt if they  were indeed stories, they were by post Victorian authors.    He puzzled over this peculiar cylinder for some time and replaced it.  Then he turned to the square apparatus and examined that. He opened a  sort of lid and found one of the double cylinders within, and on the  upper edge a little stud like the stud of an electric bell. He pressed  this and a rapid clicking began and ceased. He became aware of voices  and music, and noticed a play of colour on the smooth front face. He  suddenly realised what this might be, and stepped back to regard it.    On the flat surface was now a little picture, very vividly coloured,  and in this picture were figures that moved. Not only did they move, but  they were conversing in clear small voices. It was exactly like reality  viewed through an inverted opera glass and heard through a long tube.  His interest was seized at once by the situation, which presented a  man pacing up and down and"]]]
