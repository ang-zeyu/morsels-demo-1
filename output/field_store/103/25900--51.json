He stepped forward and made a little speech, wishing us \"A long life  of many moons, sunshine, health, and rich possessions, and the smile of  the Good Spirit upon the blue-eyed papoose;\" finishing by shaking hands  all round. The others, with an \"Ugh!\" of acquiescence, and smiling faces,  followed his example. Our hostess was unable to give them wine or whisky,  because of the stringent prohibitory laws, but she regaled them on great  slices of cake, with which they were much pleased. When Mr. C---- came in  from the line with his dog-train--four strong beasts drawing a light  cariole or covered tobogan, more like a great shoe than anything  else--the blue and red coat of his Indian runner, Tommy Harper, was much  admired by our visitors; and he told us afterwards of their admiration  for everything they saw in the house. This Tommy was a good-tempered old  fellow, but, when not running, was invariably asleep or smoking over the  kitchen fire.    About the middle of January (1877) we had a terrible snow-storm, the  worst that had been known in Manitoba for years. At five o'clock in the  evening the wind rose suddenly, and in half an hour was blowing a gale,  sending the snow whirling through the air in such blinding volume, that  it was impossible to distinguish anything twenty yards off. As night  closed in, which it does early at that season, the storm increased in  violence, and although there was then little snow falling, the wind drove  in all directions the dry snow lying upon the ground.    Many people lost their way. A shop-boy running home to tea, only round  the corner of the block, missed the turning into the gateway, and  wandered till daylight on the prairie, knowing it was certain death to  lie down. A family crossing the prairie, and seeing the storm  approaching, hastened to reach a wayside inn four or five hundred yards  distant, but before they could do so lost sight of it. After driving  several hours they were obliged to stop; and digging a hole in the snow  with their hands, covered themselves with robes and sleigh-rugs, and  drawing the sleigh over them as a little protection from the wind, they  waited until daylight--to find themselves within a hundred yards of the  inn! All next day stories were continually reaching us of narrow escapes,  of frozen feet and hands, of lost horses, frozen oxen, and travellers'  miseries in general. But this certainly was an exceptional storm, or  \"blizzard,\" as the natives say.    Towards the end of winter it was proposed that some _tableaux_  should be exhibited in the town-hall for the benefit of a local charity.  The suggestion was hailed with delight, and every one likely to be useful  was invited to \"talk it over\" with Mrs. C----. And talk they did, at such  length and with such vivacity, that I wondered how the two stage-managers,  Captain H---- and Miss P----, could ever evolve order from such a chaos.  The great clatter of tongues in that small room reminded me of an old  Scotch nurse of ours, who, being summoned to keep house for a minister  cousin, was anxious first to learn how to play the lady and entertain her  guests. The cook advised her to listen at the drawing-room door when we  had a party: but she quitted her post in disgust, having heard nothing but  \"a muckle clackit.\"    At last it was settled that the _tableaux_ were to represent the  story of \"Beauty and the Beast,\" \"Elizabeth knighting Raleigh,\" scenes  from \"Hamlet\" and \"The Bohemian Girl,\" an emblematic group of the  nations included in the British Empire, surrounded by representatives of  the army and navy, and some well-known statues. Assuredly there was  variety enough in our programme to suit all tastes!    Our dress rehearsal, held in the old church before mentioned, was more  amusing--to the actors, at all events--than the performance itself. The  \"sides,\" which looked well enough to those without, proved a delusion and  a snare to those within. They were used as dressing-rooms, but their  partition from the stage being only partial, and their flooring stopping  far short of the front, a great gap was left--a pitfall down which  everything tumbled. Their appointments were primitive, consisting of a  small looking-glass, a pincushion, and a piece of comb in each room. The  \"properties\" on the ladies' side were an old straw bonnet wreathed with  artificial flowers, and a gaudy overskirt; and on that of the gentlemen,  two hats, and a pistol and tin mug--which had probably done duty for the  \"dagger and the bowl,\" in the last scene of a dreadful tragedy. Some of  our amateurs were fortunate enough to get complete costumes made, but  others appeared in a fragmentary condition, with a bodice of the time of  Elizabeth, and a petticoat of that of Victoria. Sir Walter Raleigh wore  the old felt hat belonging to his dressing-room, and pathetically  appealed to the spectators to imagine it adorned with a white feather and  jewelled clasp.    The girls who appeared in more than one scene had to change their  dresses, and it is impossible to describe the confusion of belongings  then thrown in a vast heap on the floor, or the despair of one young  performer whose polonaise had disappeared in the gulf. As all were in  different stages of _déshabille_, no gentleman could be called to  the rescue; so I lay down on my face and groped about with my hands till  I fished it up. But before I succeeded, two or three people were standing  on my skirts, and a pile of gipsy costumes was deposited on my legs. My  rising sent dismay to the owners' hearts, and they wailed that they would  \"never be able to find their things again!\"    When the great night arrived we, by means of jewellery constructed of  gold paper and glass buttons, and other ingenious devices, made a  brilliant show, and the general effect was pronounced excellent. We had  crowded houses for _two_ consecutive nights, and the only drawback  to the pleasure of our _tableaux_ was the sad and sudden death of  one of Captain H----'s children, which took place on the first night, and  aroused general sympathy.    Soon after our theatrical entertainments the snow almost entirely  disappeared, cricket was played on the prairie, and people began to look  forward to the reopening of navigation, and to bet actively on the day  and hour when the first steamboat would arrive; though the ice was still  so solid that horse-races were held on the river.    The 20th of April was a warm day, succeeding heavy rains, and it was  hoped that the ice would move next day. In the evening we were at our  assembly in the town-hall, which is built on the side of a broad, shallow  _coolé_, or gully. About ten o'clock, seeing several people look  anxiously from the windows, we went to inquire the cause, and found the  \"water was out.\" Freshets from the prairies were rushing down the  _coolé_ beneath, carrying everything before them--dog-kennels, logs,  broken furniture, boxes, and all the usual _débris_ found scattered  about the houses on the prairie. The freshets increased so rapidly, that  it was feared if we did not leave at once we should never get home, the  water being level with the bridge, which was in imminent danger of being  carried away. The lower story of the hall was also flooded, and  considered scarcely safe. So there was cloaking in hot haste, and the  gentlemen who lived near brought all the top-boots and goloshes they  could collect for the benefit of those who had to cross the partially  submerged roads.    The ice did move next day, and on the 27th, at the sound of the steamboat  whistle, I ran to the window. As if by one impulse, every door on the  main street opened, and the inmates poured forth, men putting on their  coats, women their bonnets, while holding the kicking, struggling  bare-headed babies they had snatched up in their haste to reach the  landing as soon as the boat; boys of all sizes, ages, and descriptions,  gentle and simple, rich and poor, mustered as though by magic. In five  minutes the streets and banks of the river were black with people rushing  to meet the steamer, and the shout that greeted her at the wharf was loud  and genuine. It was the last time her arrival caused such excitement, as  before another season the railway was running to St. Boniface, and  freight and passengers could get to Winnipeg all through the winter.    The spring of 1877 was wet and backward, and we looked forward to our  journey out to the contract, where a house was nearly ready for us, with  anything but unmixed pleasure. In the hope that the state of the roads  might improve, we delayed our departure until the first week in June. For  my own part, I rejoiced over every additional delay, as I was loth to  leave Winnipeg, and the many kind friends I had made there.          CHAPTER VII.    A Manitoban Travelling-carriage--The Perils of Short Cuts--The Slough of  Despond--Paddy to the Rescue!--\"Stick-in-the-Mud\" and his  Troubles--McQuade's--An Irish Welcome--Wretched Wanderers.      After many days of packing, general confusion, and disturbing dust,  culminating in breakfast in the kitchen, dinner on a packing-case in the  parlour, high tea at a neighbour's in our travelling-gear, and a night at  the hotel, we rose at five o'clock on the morning of the 5th of June to  be ready for our journey to Clear Water Bay. All the teams, with the  household goods and chattels, had started the day before, except two for  personal baggage, and the one we were to occupy.    Of course we were ready too soon, and hours were spent in standing idly  about, and going to the gate to see if the trams were coming. When they  were at last packed and off, it was decided to be altogether too late for  us to follow until after luncheon which with only an uncertain prospect  of a heavier meal later, we turned into dinner. Then some one remembered  half a dozen forgotten things which it was impossible to do without, and  it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7128"],[0,"Indian Fairy Tales (#9)"],[1,"the way, but they only founds jackals and birds.    The Raja of the Phalana country was called Munsuk Raja, and he had a  daughter named Laili, who was very beautiful; she had brown eyes and  black hair.    One night, some time before Prince Majnun came to her father's  kingdom, as she slept, Khuda sent to her an angel in the form of a man  who told her that she should marry Prince Majnun and no one else, and  that this was Khuda's command to her. When Laili woke she told her  father of the angel's visit to her as she slept; but her father paid  no attention to her story. From that time she began repeating,  \"Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,\" and would say nothing else. Even as  she sat and ate her food she kept saying, \"Majnun, Majnun; I want  Majnun.\" Her father used to get quite vexed with her. \"Who is this  Majnun? who ever heard of this Majnun?\" he would say.    \"He is the man I am to marry,\" said Laili. \"Khuda has ordered me to  marry no one but Majnun.\" And she was half mad.    Meanwhile, Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to hunt in the Phalana  country; and as they were riding about, Laili came out on her horse to  eat the air, and rode behind them. All the time she kept saying,  \"Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun.\" The prince heard her, and turned  round. \"Who is calling me?\" he asked. At this Laili looked at him, and  the moment she saw him she fell deeply in love with him, and she said  to herself, \"I am sure that is the Prince Majnun that Khuda says I am  to marry.\" And she went home to her father and said, \"Father, I wish  to marry the prince who has come to your kingdom; for I know he is the  Prince Majnun I am to marry.\"    \"Very well, you shall have him for your husband,\" said Munsuk Raja.  \"We will ask him to-morrow.\" Laili consented to wait, although she was  very impatient. As it happened, the prince left the Phalana kingdom  that night, and when Laili heard he was gone, she went quite mad. She  would not listen to a word her father, or her mother, or her servants  said to her, but went off into the jungle, and wandered from jungle to  jungle, till she got farther and farther away from her own country.  All the time she kept saying, \"Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun;\" and so  she wandered about for twelve years.    At the end of the twelve years she met a fakir--he was really an  angel, but she did not know this--who asked her, \"Why do you always  say, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun'?\" She answered, \"I am the  daughter of the king of the Phalana country, and I want to find Prince  Majnun; tell me where his kingdom is.\"    \"I think you will never get there,\" said the fakir, \"for it is very  far from hence, and you have to cross many rivers to reach it.\" But  Laili said she did not care; she must see Prince Majnun. \"Well,\" said  the fakir, \"when you come to the Bhagirathi river you will see a big  fish, a Rohu; and you must get him to carry you to Prince Majnun's  country, or you will never reach it.\"    She went on and on, and at last she came to the Bhagirathi river.  There was a great big fish called the Rohu fish. It was yawning just  as she got up to it, and she instantly jumped down its throat into its  stomach. All the time she kept saying, \"Majnun, Majnun.\" At this the  Rohu fish was greatly alarmed and swam down the river as fast as he  could. By degrees he got tired and went slower, and a crow came and  perched on his back, and said \"Caw, caw.\" \"Oh, Mr. Crow,\" said the  poor fish \"do see what is in my stomach that makes such a noise.\"    \"Very well,\" said the crow, \"open your mouth wide, and I'll fly down  and see.\" So the Rohu opened his jaws and the crow flew down, but he  came up again very quickly. \"You have a Rakshas in your stomach,\" said  the crow, and he flew away. This news did not comfort the poor Rohu,  and he swam on and on till he came to Prince Majnun's country. There  he stopped. And a jackal came down to the river to drink. \"Oh,  jackal,\" said the Rohu, \"do tell me what I have inside me.\"    [Illustration:]    \"How can I tell?\" said the jackal. \"I cannot see unless I go inside  you.\" So the Rohu opened his mouth wide, and the jackal jumped down  his throat; but he came up very quickly, looking much frightened and  saying, \"You have a Rakshas in your stomach, and if I don't run away  quickly, I am afraid it will eat me.\" So off he ran. After the jackal  came an enormous snake. \"Oh,\" says the fish, \"do tell me what I have  in my stomach, for it rattles about so, and keeps saying, 'Majnun,  Majnun; I want Majnun.'\"    The snake said, \"Open your mouth wide, and I'll go down and see what  it is.\" The snake went down: when he returned he said, \"You have a  Rakshas in your stomach, but if you will let me cut you open, it will  come out of you.\" \"If you do that, I shall die,\" said the Rohu. \"Oh,  no,\" said the snake, \"you will not, for I will give you a medicine  that will make you quite well again.\" So the fish agreed, and the  snake got a knife and cut him open, and out jumped Laili.    She was now very old. Twelve years she had wandered about the jungle,  and for twelve years she had lived inside her Rohu; and she was no  longer beautiful, and had lost her teeth. The snake took her on his  back and carried her into the country, and there he put her down, and  she wandered on and on till she got to Majnun's court-house, where  King Majnun was sitting. There some men heard her crying, \"Majnun,  Majnun; I want Majnun,\" and they asked her what she wanted. \"I want  King Majnun,\" she said.    So they went in and said to Prince Majnun, \"An old woman outside says  she wants you.\" \"I cannot leave this place,\" said he; \"send her in  here.\" They brought her in and the prince asked her what she wanted.  \"I want to marry you,\" she answered. \"Twenty-four years ago you came  to my father the Phalana Raja's country, and I wanted to marry you  then; but you went away without marrying me. Then I went mad, and I  have wandered about all these years looking for you.\" Prince Majnun  said, \"Very good.\"    \"Pray to Khuda,\" said Laili, \"to make us both young again, and then we  shall be married.\" So the prince prayed to Khuda, and Khuda said to  him, \"Touch Laili's clothes and they will catch fire, and when they  are on fire, she and you will become young again.\" When he touched  Laili's clothes they caught fire, and she and he became young again.  And there were great feasts, and they were married, and travelled to  the Phalana country to see her father and mother.    Now Laili's father and mother had wept so much for their daughter that  they had become quite blind, and her father kept always repeating,  \"Laili, Laili, Laili.\" When Laili saw their blindness, she prayed to  Khuda to restore their sight to them, which he did. As soon as the  father and mother saw Laili, they hugged her and kissed her, and then  they had the wedding all over again amid great rejoicings. Prince  Majnun and Laili stayed with Munsuk Raja and his wife for three years,  and then they returned to King Dantal, and lived happily for some time  with him.    They used to go out hunting, and they often went from country to  country to eat the air and amuse themselves.    One day Prince Majnun said to Laili, \"Let us go through this jungle.\"  \"No, no,\" said Laili; \"if we go through this jungle, some harm will  happen to me.\" But Prince Majnun laughed, and went into the jungle.  And as they were going through it, Khuda thought, \"I should like to  know how much Prince Majnun loves his wife. Would he be very sorry if  she died? And would he marry another wife? I will see.\" So he sent one  of his angels in the form of a fakir into the jungle; and the angel  went up to Laili, and threw some powder in her face, and instantly she  fell to the ground a heap of ashes.    Prince Majnun was in great sorrow and grief when he saw his dear Laili  turned into a little heap of ashes; and he went straight home to his  father, and for a long, long time he would not be comforted. After a  great many years he grew more cheerful and happy, and began to go  again into his father's beautiful garden with Husain Mahamat. King  Dantal wished his son to marry again. \"I will only have Laili for my  wife; I will not marry any other woman,\" said Prince Majnun.    \"How can you marry Laili? Laili is dead. She will never come back to  you,\" said the father.    \"Then I'll not have any wife at all,\" said Prince Majnun.    Meanwhile Laili was living in the jungle where her husband had left  her a little heap of ashes. As soon as Majnun had gone, the fakir had  taken her ashes and made them quite clean, and then he had mixed clay  and water with the ashes, and made the figure of a woman with them,  and so Laili regained her human form, and Khuda sent life into it. But  Laili had become once more a hideous old woman, with a long, long  nose, and teeth like tusks; just such an old woman, excepting her  teeth, as she had been when she came out of the Rohu fish; and she  lived in the jungle, and neither ate nor drank, and she kept on  saying, \"Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun.\"    At last the angel who had come as a fakir and thrown the powder at  her, said to Khuda, \"Of what use is it that this woman should sit in  the jungle crying, crying for ever, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,'  and eating and drinking nothing? Let me take her to Prince Majnun.\"  \"Well,\" said Khuda, \"you may do so; but tell her that she must not  speak to Majnun if he is afraid of her when he sees her; and that if  he is afraid when he sees her, she will become a little white dog the  next day. Then she must go to the palace, and she will only regain her  human shape when Prince Majnun loves her, feeds her with his own food,  and lets her sleep in his bed.\"    So the angel came to Laili again as a fakir and carried her to King  Dantal's garden. \"Now,\" he said, \"it is Khuda's command that you stay  here till Prince Majnun comes to walk in the garden, and then you may  show yourself to him. But you must"]]]
