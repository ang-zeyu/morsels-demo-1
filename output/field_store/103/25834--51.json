What more shall I  say? but that my Lord de Martigues never had an hour's rest after  he was wounded. ... These things considered, Gentlemen, no other  prognosis is possible, save that he will die in a few days, to my  great grief.    Having finished my discourse, I dressed him as I was accustomed.  When I displayed his wounds, the physicians and surgeons, and  other assistants present, knew the truth of what I had said. The  physicians, having felt his pulse and seen that the vital forces  were depressed and spent, agreed with me that in a few days he  would die. Then they all went to the Duc de Savoie, and told him  M. de Martigues would die in a short time. He answered them,  \"Possibly, if he had been well dressed, he might have escaped  death.\" Then they all with one voice said he had been very well  dressed and cared for altogether, and it could not be better, and  it was impossible to cure him, and his wound was of necessity  mortal. Then M. de Savoie was very angry with them, and cried,  and asked them again if for certain they all held his case  hopeless: they answered, yes.    Then a Spanish impostor came forward, who promised on his life to  cure him; and if he did not, they should cut him in an hundred  pieces; but he would have no physicians, nor surgeons nor  apothecaries with him: and M. le Duc de Savoie forthwith bade the  physicians and surgeons not go near M. de Martigues; and sent a  gentleman to bid me, under pain of death, not so much as to touch  him. Which I promised, and was very glad, for now he would not  die under my hands; and the impostor was told to dress him, and  to have with him no other physicians or surgeons, but only  himself. By and bye he came, and said to M. de Martigues, \"Senor  Cavallero, M. de Savoie has bid me come and dress your wound. I  swear to God, before eight days I will set you on horseback,  lance in hand, provided none touch you but I alone. You shall eat  and drink whatever you like. I will be dieted instead of you; and  you may trust me to perform what I promise. I have cured many who  had worse wounds than yours.\" And the Seigneurs answered him,  \"God give you His grace for it.\"    He asked for a shirt of M. de Martigues, and tore it in little  strips, which he laid cross-wise, muttering and murmuring certain  words over the wounds: having done this much for him, he let him  eat and drink all he would, saying he himself would be dieted in  his stead; which he did, eating but six prunes and six morsels of  bread for dinner, and drinking only beer. Nevertheless, two days  later, M. de Martigues died: and my friend the Spaniard, seeing  him at the point of death, eclipsed himself, and got away without  good-bye to any man. And I believe if he had been caught he would  have been hanged and strangled, for the false promise he made to  M. le Due de Savoie and many other gentlemen. M. de Martigues  died about ten o'clock in the morning; and after dinner M. de  Savoie sent the physicians and surgeons, and his apothecary, with  a store of drugs to embalm him. They came with many gentlemen and  captains of his army.    The Emperor's surgeon came to me, and asked me in a very friendly  way to make, the embalmment; which I refused, saying that I was  not worthy to carry his instrument-box after him. He begged me  again to do it to please him, and that he would be very glad of  it...Seeing his kindness, and fearing to displease him, I then  decided to show them the anatomist that I was, expounding to them  many things, which would here be too long to recite... Our  discourse finished, I embalmed the body; and it was placed in a  coffin. Then the Emperor's surgeon drew me aside, and told me, if  I would stop with him, he would treat me well, and give me a new  suit of clothes, and set me on horseback. I gave him many thanks,  and said I had no wish to serve any country but my own. Then he  told me I was a fool, and if he were a prisoner as I was, he  would serve a devil to get his freedom. In the end I told him  flat I would not stop with him. The Emperor's physician then went  back to M. de Savoie, and explained to him the causes of M. de  Martigues' death, and that it was impossible for all the men in  the world to have cured him; and assured him again I had done all  that was to be done, and besought him to take me into his  service; saying much more good of me than there was. He having  been persuaded to do this, sent to me one of his stewards, M. du  Bouchet, to tell me, if I would serve him, he would use me well;  I sent back my very humble thanks, and that I had decided not to  take service under any foreigner. When he heard my answer he was  very angry, and said I ought to be sent to the galleys.    M. de Vaudeville, Governor of Graveline, and colonel of seventeen  ensigns of infantry, asked him to send me to him, to dress an old  ulcer on his leg, that he had had for six or seven years. M. de  Savoie said he was willing, so far as I was concerned; and if I  used the cautery to his leg, it would serve him right. M. de  Vaudeville answered, if he saw me trying it, he would have my  throat cut. Soon after, he sent for me four German halberdiers of  his guard; and I was terrified, for I did not know where they  were taking me: they spoke no more French than I German. When I  was come to his lodging, he bade me welcome, and said, now I  belonged to him; and so soon as I had healed him, he would let me  go without ransom. I told him I had no means to pay any ransom.  He called his physician and his surgeon-in-ordinary, to show me  his leg; and when we had examined it, we withdrew into a room,  where I began my discourse to them. ... Then the physician left  me with the surgeon, and went back to M. de Vaudeville, and said  he was sure I could cure him, and told him all I had decided to  do; which pleased him vastly. He sent for me, and asked if I  thought I could cure him; I said yes, if he were obedient to what  was necessary. He promised to do only what I wished and ordered;  and so soon as he was healed, he would let me go home without  ransom. Then I asked him to make better terms with me, saying it  was too long to wait for my liberty: in fifteen days I hoped his  ulcer would be less than half its present size, and give no pain;  then his own surgeon and physician could finish the cure. He  granted this to me. Then I took a piece of paper to measure the  size of the ulcer, and gave it to him, and kept another by me; I  asked him to keep his promise, when I had done my work; he swore  by the faith of a gentleman he would. Then I set myself to dress  him properly, after the manner of Galen. ... He wished to know if  it were true, what I said of Galen, and bade his physician look  to it, for he would know it for himself; he had the book put on  the table, and found that what I said was true; so the physician  was ashamed, and I was glad. Within the fifteen days, it was  almost all healed; and I began to feel happy about the compact  made between us. He had me to eat and drink at his table, when  there were no more great persons than he and I only. He gave me a  big red scarf which I must wear; which made me feel something  like a dog when they give him a clog, to stop him eating the  grapes in the vineyards. His physician and surgeon took me  through the camp to visit their wounded; and I took care to  observe what our enemy was doing. I found they had no more great  cannons, but only twenty-five or thirty field-pieces.    M. de Vaudeville held prisoner M. de Bauge, brother of M. de  Martigues who died at Hesdin. M. de Bauge was prisoner at Chateau  de La Motte au Bois, belonging to the Emperor; he had been  captured at Therouenne by two Spanish soldiers; and M. de  Vaudeville, when he saw him there, concluded he must be some  gentleman of good family: he made him pull off his stockings, and  seeing his clean legs and feet, and his fine white stockings,  knew he was one to pay a good ransom. He told the soldiers he  would give them thirty crowns down for their prisoner: they  agreed gladly, for they had no place to keep him, nor food for  him, nor did they know his value: so they gave their man into his  hands, and he sent him off at once, guarded by four of his own  soldiers, to Chateau de La Motte au Bois, with others of our  gentlemen who were prisoners.    M. de Bauge would not tell who he was; and endured much hardship,  living on bread and water, with a little straw for his bed. When  Hesdin was taken, M. de Vaudeville sent the news of it to him and  to the other prisoners, and the list of the killed, and among  them M. de Martigues: and when M. de Bauge heard with his own  ears his brother was dead, he fell to crying, weeping, and  lamentation. His guards asked him why he was so miserable: he  told them, for love of M. de Martigues, his brother. When he  heard this, the captain of the castle sent straight to tell M. de  Vaudeville he had a good prisoner: who was delighted at this, and  sent me next day with four soldiers, and his own physician, to  the castle, to say that if M. de Bauge would pay him fifteen  thousand crowns ransom, he would send him home free: and he asked  only the security of two Antwerp merchants that he should name.  M. de Vaudeville persuaded me I should commend this offer to his  prisoner: that is why he sent me to the castle. He told the  captain to treat him well and put him in a room with hangings,  and strengthen his guard: and from that time onward they made a  great deal of him, at the expense of M. de Vaudeville.    M. de Bauge answered that he could not pay his ransom himself: it  depended on M. d' Estampes his uncle, and Mlle. de Bressure his  aunt: he had no means to pay such a ransom. I went back with my  guards, and gave this answer to M. de Vaudeville; who said,  \"Possibly he will not get away so cheap\": which was true, for  they knew who he was.

His trim, athletic figure was muffled in a big,  double-breasted, woolly overcoat, the collar turned up about his ears.  His neat bowler hat was tilted forward so as to shade the fierce blue  eyes. Indeed, in that imperfect light, little of the Chief Inspector's  countenance was visible except his large, gleaming white teeth, which he  constantly revealed in the act of industriously chewing mint gum.    He smiled as he chewed. Duty had called him out into the mist, and for  once he had obeyed reluctantly. That very afternoon had seen the return  of Dan Kerry, junior, home from school for the Christmas vacation, and  Dan was the apple of his father's eye.    Mrs. Kerry had reserved her dour Scottish comments upon the boy's school  report for a more seemly occasion than the first day of his holidays;  but Kerry had made no attempt to conceal his jubilation--almost immoral,  his wife had declared it to be--respecting the lad's athletic record.  His work on the junior left wing had gained the commendation of a  celebrated international; and Kerry, who had interviewed the gymnasium  instructor, had learned that Dan Junior bade fair to become an amateur  boxer of distinction.    \"He is faster on his feet than any boy I ever handled,\" the expert had  declared. \"He hasn't got the weight behind it yet, of course, but he's  developing a left that's going to make history. I'm of opinion that  there isn't a boy in the seniors can take him on, and I'll say that he's  a credit to you.\"    Those words had fallen more sweetly upon the ears of Chief Inspector  Kerry than any encomium of the boy's learning could have done. On the  purely scholastic side his report was not a good one, admittedly. \"But,\"  murmured Kerry aloud, \"he's going to be a man.\"    He remembered that he had promised, despite the lateness of the hour, to  telephone the lad directly he had received a certain report, and to tell  him whether he might wait up for his return or whether he must turn in.  Kerry, stamping his small, neatly shod feet upon the pavement, smiled  agreeably. He was thinking of the telephone which recently he had had  installed in his house in Brixton. His wife had demanded this as a  Christmas box, pointing out how many uneasy hours she would be spared by  the installation. Kerry had consented cheerfully enough, for was he not  shortly to be promoted to the exalted post of a superintendent of the  Criminal Investigation Department?    These reflections were cheering and warming; and, waiting until a gap  occurred in the stream of cabs and cars, he crossed Piccadilly and  proceeded along Bond Street, swinging his shoulders in a manner which  would have enabled any constable in the force to recognize \"Red Kerry\"  at a hundred yards.    The fierce eyes scrutinized the occupants of all the lighted cars. At  pedestrians also he stared curiously, and at another smaller group of  travellers waiting for the buses on the left-hand side of the street he  looked hard and long. He pursued his way, acknowledged the salutation  of a porter who stood outside the entrance to the Embassy Club, and  proceeded, glancing about him right and left and with some evident and  definite purpose.    A constable standing at the corner of Conduit Street touched his helmet  as Kerry passed and the light of an arc-lamp revealed the fierce red  face. The Chief Inspector stopped, turned, and:    \"What the devil's the idea?\" he demanded.    He snapped out the words in such fashion that the unfortunate constable  almost believed he could see sparks in the misty air.    \"I'm sorry, sir, but recognizing you suddenly like, I----\"    \"You did?\" the fierce voice interrupted. \"How long in the force?\"    \"Six months, sir.\"    \"Never salute an officer in plain clothes.\"    \"I know, sir.\"    \"Then why did you do it?\"    \"I told you, sir.\"    \"Then tell me again.\"    \"I forgot.\"    \"You're paid to remember; bear it in mind.\"    Kerry tucked his malacca under his arm and walked on, leaving the  unfortunate policeman literally stupefied by his first encounter with  the celebrated Chief Inspector.    Presently another line of cars proclaimed the entrance to a club, and  just before reaching the first of these Kerry paused. A man stood in a  shadowy doorway, and:    \"Good evening, Chief Inspector,\" he said quietly.    \"Good evening, Durham. Anything to report?\"    \"Yes. Lou Chada is here again.\"    \"With whom?\"    \"Lady Rourke.\"    Kerry stepped to the edge of the pavement and spat out a piece of  chewing-gum. From his overcoat pocket he drew a fresh piece, tore off  the pink wrapping and placed the gum between his teeth. Then:    \"How long?\" he demanded.    \"Came to dinner. They are dancing.\"    \"H'm!\" The Chief Inspector ranged himself beside the other detective in  the shadow of the doorway. \"Something's brewing, Durham,\" he said. \"I  think I shall wait.\"    His subordinate stared curiously but made no reply. He was not wholly  in his chief's confidence. He merely knew that the name of Lou Chada  to Kerry was like a red rag to a bull. The handsome, cultured young  Eurasian, fresh from a distinguished university career and pampered by a  certain section of smart society, did not conform to Detective Sergeant  Durham's idea of a suspect. He knew that Lou was the son of Zani Chada,  and he knew that Zani Chada was one of the wealthiest men in Limehouse.  But Lou had an expensive flat in George Street; Lou was courted by  society butterflies, and in what way he could be connected with the case  known as \"the Limehouse inquiry,\" Durham could not imagine.    That the open indiscretion of Lady \"Pat\" Rourke might lead to trouble  with her husband, was conceivable enough; but this was rather a matter  for underhand private inquiry than for the attention of the Criminal  Investigation Department of New Scotland Yard.    So mused Durham, standing cold and uncomfortable in the shadowy doorway,  and dreaming of a certain cosy fireside, a pair of carpet slippers and a  glass of hot toddy which awaited him. Suddenly:    \"Great flames! Look!\" he cried.    Kerry's fingers closed, steely, upon Durham's wrist. A porter was  urgently moving the parked cars farther along the street to enable one,  a French coupe, to draw up before the club entrance.    Two men came out, supporting between them a woman who seemed to be ill;  a slender, blonde woman whose pretty face was pale and whose wide-open  blue eyes stared strangely straight before her. The taller of her  escorts, while continuing to support her, solicitously wrapped her fur  cloak about her bare shoulders; the other, the manager of the club,  stepped forward and opened the door of the car.    \"Lady Rourke!\" whispered Durham.    \"With Lou Chada!\" rapped Kerry. \"Run for a cab. Brisk. Don't waste a  second.\"    Some little conversation ensued between manager and patron, then the  tall, handsome Eurasian, waving his hand protestingly, removed his hat  and stepped into the coupe beside Lady Rourke. It immediately moved away  in the direction of Piccadilly.    One glimpse Kerry had of the pretty, fair head lying limply back against  the cushions. The manager of the club was staring after the car.    Kerry stepped out from his hiding place. Durham had disappeared, and  there was no cab in sight, but immediately beyond the illuminated  entrance stood a Rolls-Royce which had been fifth in the rank of parked  cars before the adjustment had been made to enable the coupe to reach  the door. Kerry ran across, and:    \"Whose car, my lad?\" he demanded of the chauffeur.    The latter, resenting the curt tone of the inquiry, looked the speaker  up and down, and:    \"Captain. Egerton's,\" he replied slowly. \"But what business may it be of  yours?\"    \"I'm Chief Inspector Kerry, of New Scotland Yard,\" came the rapid reply.  \"I want to follow the car that has just left.\"    \"What about running?\" demanded the man insolently.    Kerry shot out a small, muscular hand and grasped the speaker's wrist.    \"I'll say one thing to you,\" he rapped. \"I'm a police officer, and I  demand your help. Refuse it, and you'll wake up in Vine Street.\"    The Chief Inspector was on the step now, bending forward so that his  fierce red face was but an inch removed from that of the startled  chauffeur. The quelling force of his ferocious personality achieved its  purpose, as it rarely failed to do.    \"I'm getting in,\" added the Chief Inspector, jumping back on to the  pavement. \"Lose that French bus, and I'll charge you with resisting and  obstructing an officer of the law in the execution of his duty. Start.\"    Kerry leaped in and banged the door--and the Rolls-Royce started.          II    AT MALAY JACK'S        When Kerry left Bond Street the mistiness of the night was developing  into definite fog. It varied in different districts. Thus, St. Paul's  Churchyard had been clear of it at a time when it had lain impenetrably  in Trafalgar Square. When, an hour and a half after setting out in the  commandeered Rolls-Royce, Kerry groped blindly along Limehouse Causeway,  it was through a yellow murk that he made his way--a vapour which could  not only be seen, smelled and felt, but tasted.    He was in one of his most violent humours. He found some slight solace  in the reflection that the impudent chauffeur, from whom he had parted  in West India Dock Road, must experience great difficulty in finding his  way back to the West End.    \"Damn the fog!\" he muttered, coughing irritably.    It had tricked him, this floating murk of London; for, while he had been  enabled to keep the coupe in view right to the fringe of dockland, here,  as if bred by old London's river, the fog had lain impenetrably.    Chief Inspector Kerry was a man who took many risks, but because of this  cursed fog he had no definite evidence that Chada's car had gone "]]]
