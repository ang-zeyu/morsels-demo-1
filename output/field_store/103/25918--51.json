GRANT.\"    On their parting, the Britannia steered to Sydney, while the Lady Nelson  stood to the southward, meeting with a southerly wind and being so  retarded that it was 8 A.M. on the 21st before Wilson's Promontory was  sighted. When close to the rock which he had named Rodondo, Grant  observed the latitude to be south 39 degrees 4 minutes.* (* The latitude  of Wilson's Promontory is 39 degrees 7 minutes 55 seconds and the  longitude 146 degrees 25 minutes east. In the log, Lieutenant Grant gives  the former as 38 degrees 59 minutes and longitude 146 degrees 6 minutes  east.) From Wilson's Promontory, the land sloped to the north-north-west  as far as eye could reach, becoming low and level towards Cape Liptrap  and from Glennie's Islands. The Lady Nelson now followed the coast  towards Western Port. On the way her commander named a point Cape  Paterson in honour of Colonel Paterson of the New South Wales Corps.    He thus describes the manner of his coming to Western Port: \"At 4 P.M. of  the 21st we had sight of the island which forms the south head of Western  Port having the likeness of a snapper's head or horseman's helmet. By  eight we were up with it. On opening the entrance of the port I found two  small islands situated about three quarters of a mile from the South Head  with apparently a good passage between them and the island forming the  harbour. From its likeness, as above mentioned, to a snapper's head, I  named it Snapper Island.* (* The Phillip Island of Bass which even at  that time was called Phillip Island, a name it is still known by. Its  eastern extremity resembled the head of a snapper and was known as  Snapper Head. Bass himself had, in discovering the Strait, noticed the  resemblance.) It falls in a high clay bluff down to the water's edge. The  small islands lying off it were covered with seals, numbers of which, on  our approach, precipitated themselves into the sea, covering the passage,  while others remained on the rocks making a very disagreeable noise,  something like the grunting of pigs. They were of a large size, many of  them being nearly equal to a bullock. I judged them to be of that species  of seal called by fishermen sea elephants, accordingly I named these  islands, Seal Islands. I sent a boat ahead to sound...and found between  the Seal Islands and the South Head, 12, 9, 6, 5 and 3 1/2 fathoms of  water which last was shoaled in mid channel. This passage will shorten  the distance when there is a leading wind but standing round to the  westward of Seal Islands there will be found sufficient room for any  number of vessels to beat in. Mr. Bass, when he visited this place in the  whale boat, entered the port by the eastern passage which is much the  smallest, and coasting the western shore, from whence he made his  remarks. It is probable that these islands, lying so close to the western  side of him, did not show themselves to be detached...It had rained  constantly and heavily all night and...we could not see any great  distance from the vessel therefore I kept the lead going as she worked up  the harbour.\"    At half-past five she was \"brought to\" opposite to a sandy point which he  named Lady Nelson's Point \"as a memorial of the vessel as she was the  first decked one that ever entered this port...Mr. Barrallier went on  shore with the second mate. They saw black swans and redbills, an aquatic  bird so called whose back is black, breast white, beak red and feet not  fully webbed. On Sunday 22nd or, according to our sea account the 23rd at  noon, I went with two of our crew in the smallest boat to search for a  river or stream described by Mr. Bass.\"    In proceeding along the shore Grant passed a muddy flat, and fell in with  an island* (* The log says this island bore north-north-west, 2 miles.)  \"separated from the main by a very narrow channel at low water.\"...On  this he landed. \"The situation of it was so pleasant that this together  with the richness of the spot made me conceive the idea that it was  excellently adapted for a garden.\" The island was called Churchill's  Island after John Churchill, Esquire, of Dawlish, in the county of Devon,  who, when the Lady Nelson left England, had given her commander vegetable  seeds, the stones of peaches, and the pips of several sorts of apples,  telling him \"to plant them for the future benefit of our fellow-men, be  they countrymen, Europeans or savages.\" Captain Schanck had also supplied  him with seeds. A very rare apple, having seldom more than one pip in  each fruit, was named by Grant \"Lady Elizabeth Percy's Apple,\" because,  \"it was owing to her Ladyship's care and attention in preparing the  pepins that I was enabled to introduce it.\"    On this day several good observations were obtained. Grant placed Western  Port in latitude 38 degrees 32 minutes south and (by chronometer) in 146  degrees 19 minutes east of Greenwich. He did not, however, discover the  stream for which he was looking. On the following morning the second mate  (Mr. Bowen) tried to find the stream but was also unsuccessful. During  his absence the Commander explored the banks of a creek \"which opened  abreast of the vessel\" and Barrallier and Murray surveyed the harbour  while Caley searched for new plants wandering as far as Snapper Island.  Barrallier and Grant also made collections but Governor King afterwards  wrote that \"Caley received everything they found--and refused to give up  or part with a duplicate.\"    Wet weather set in until the 25th. The day following, search was again  made for fresh water, and Grant went up the creek which was found to  terminate in a salt marsh. The trees on the bank were not large but the  underwood was thick. He penetrated inland for some distance and saw spots  \"as if cleared by manual labour...covered with good tender grass,\" a  delightful sight to him. The open land had the appearance of being  frequently overflowed and he thought it was well adapted for the purpose  of fattening cattle; numbers of black swans and other water-fowl were  seen in the creek, the length of which was about two miles and a half,  its waters, which were salt, ended in a small run some 12 feet in  breadth. It was Bowen, the second mate, who at length found the  fresh-water stream originally discovered by Bass, and on the same day he  captured a couple of cygnets one of which was presented to the Governor  at Sydney.    On 27th March, Murray accompanied by Barrallier and Caley set out to  explore the stream. They went up its windings as far as possible passing  no less than 42 short reaches. Its breadth at the entrance was about half  a cable's length and at the farthest part reached by the boat not more  than 18 or 20 feet, the passage being there impeded by trees lying across  it.    While his party were exploring, the commander with Euranabie made  excursions along the shore to the mouth of the harbour. \"The beach was  covered with shells, many of them beautiful and some of them entirely new  to me. I observed another creek not so large as the former which I have  described but having its entrance quite filled up...so that the sea could  not enter it...the land in general was above the level of the sea and the  soil was in some places light and black, in others a red clay. We fell in  with a rocky point about which I observed playing in the water a number  of fishes called salmon in New Holland. I expressed a desire to the  native of having some...and no sooner expressed my wish than I missed my  companion from behind me. I halloed...upon which he instantly presented  himself from the wood with a small stick in his hand. Asking for my knife  he presently sharpened one end to a point and then, stripping himself, he  leaped from one point of the rock to another until he met with an  opportunity of striking a fish which he did, the stick penetrating right  through it. I could not but admire the keenness of his sight and his  ability to preserve the steadiness of his position, standing as he did on  the rough edge of a sharp rock, the sea washing above his knees, his eyes  intent on the fish, very difficult to strike from the smallness of its  size, presented to him in a narrow back. Though I pressed him to take the  fish several times he constantly refused it but accepted some tobacco.\"    Next day Grant went on shore at Churchill's Island with a party to clear  a space for a garden. Some twenty rods were burnt after the larger trees  had been felled. The soil on the island was found to be rich and loose  and easy to dig. On the 29th Murray was sent to ascertain particulars  \"respecting the entrance of the port and with regard to Seal Islands\" on  which he was instructed to land. Barrallier accompanied him. Soon after  their departure bad weather set in which prevented their landing. They  eventually anchored off a sandy beach which appeared to have no surf, but  were suddenly surprised by a heavy swelling sea that rolled upon it,  followed by another which filled the boat, upsetting it upon the beach.  Fortunately no lives were lost though all \"were immersed in the water  from which the native Euranabie...first escaped to shore.\" The  provisions, however, and the ammunition were lost or spoiled. At turn of  tide they launched the boat and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7514"],[0,"A Guide to Stoicism (#9)"],[1,"'  was reserved for that which was partly occupied and partly  unoccupied. As there was no corner of the cosmos unfilled by body,  space, it will be seen, was another name for the All. Place was  compared to a vessel that was full, void to one that was empty, and  space to the vast wine-cask, such as that in which Diogenes made his  home, which was kept partly fully, but in which there was always room  for more. The last comparison must of course not be pressed. For if  space be a cask, it is one without top, bottom or sides.    But while the Stoics regarded our universe as an island of being in  an ocean of void, they did not admit the possibility that other such  islands might exist beyond our ken. The spectacle of the starry  heavens, which presented itself nightly to their gaze in all the  brilliancy of a southern sky--that was all there was of being, beyond  that lay nothingness. Democritus or the Epicureans might dream of  other worlds, but the Stoics contended for the unity of the cosmos as  staunchly as the Mahometans for the unity of God, for with them the  cosmos was God.    In shape they conceived of it as spherical, on the ground that the  sphere was the perfect figure and was also the best adapted for  motion. Not that the universe as a whole moved. The earth lay in its  centre, spherical and motionless, and round it coursed the sun, moon,  and planets, fixed each in its respective sphere as in so many  concentric rings, while the outermost ring of all, which contained  the fixed stars, wheeled round the rest with an inconceivable  velocity.    The tendency of all things in the universe to the centre kept the  earth fixed in the middle as being subject to an equal pressure on  every side. The same cause also, according to Zeno, kept the universe  itself at rest in the void. But in an infinite void, it could make no  difference whether the whole were at rest or in motion. It may have  been a desire to escape the notion of a migratory whole which led  Zeno to broach the curious doctrine that the universe has no weight,  as being composed of elements whereof two are heavy and two are  light. Air and fire did indeed tend to the centre like everything  else in the cosmos, but not till they had reached their natural home.  Till then they were of an upward-growing nature. It appears then that  the upward and downward tendencies of the elements were held to  neutralise one another and to leave the universe devoid of weight.    The universe was the only thing which was perfect in itself, the one  thing which was an end in itself. All other things were perfect  indeed as parts, when considered with reference to the whole, but  were none of them ends in themselves, unless man could be deemed so  who was born to contemplate the universe and imitate its perfections.  Thus, then, did the Stoics envisage the universe on its physical  side--as one, finite, fixed in space, but revolving round its own  centre, earth, beautiful beyond all things, and perfect as a whole.    But it was impossible for this order and beauty to exist without  mind. The universe was pervaded by intelligence as man's body is  pervaded by his soul. But as the human soul though everywhere present  in the body is not present everywhere in the same degree, so it was  with the world-soul. The human soul presents itself not only as  intellect, but also in the lower manifestations of sense, growth, and  cohesion. It is the soul which is the cause of the plant life, which  displays itself more particularly in the nails and hair; it is the  soul also which causes cohesion among the parts of the solid  substances such as bones and sinews, that make up our frame. In the  same way the world-soul displayed itself in rational beings as  intellect, in the lower animals as mere souls, in plants as nature or  growth, and in inorganic substances as 'holding' or cohesion. To this  lowest stage add change, and you have growth or plant nature;  super-add to this phantasy and impulse and you rise to the soul of  irrational animals; at a yet higher stage you reach the rational and  discursive intellect, which is peculiar to man among mortal natures.    We have spoken of soul as the cause of the plant life in our bodies,  but plants were not admitted by the Stoics to be possessed of soul in  the strict sense. What animated them was 'nature' or, as we have  called it above, 'growth'. Nature, in this sense of the principle of  growth, was defined by the Stoics as 'a constructive fire, proceeding  in a regular way to production,' or 'a fiery spirit endowed with  artistic skill'. That Nature was an artist needed no proof, since it  was her handiwork that human art essayed to copy. But she was an  artist who combined the useful with the pleasant, aiming at once at  beauty and convenience. In the widest sense, Nature was another name  for Providence, or the principle which held the universe together,  but, as the term is now being employed, it stood for that degree of  existence which is above cohesion and below soul. From this point of  view, it was defined as \"a cohesion subject to self originated change  in accordance with seminal reasons effecting and maintaining its  results in definite times, and reproducing in the offspring the  characteristics of the parent\". This sounds about as abstract as  Herbert Spencer's definition of life, but it must be borne in mind  that nature was all the time a 'spirit', and as such a body. It was a  body of a less subtle essence than soul. Similarly, when the Stoics  spoke of cohesion, they are not to be taken as referring to some  abstract principle like attraction. 'Cohesions,' said Chrysippus,  'are nothing else than airs, for it is by these that bodies are held  together, and of the individual qualities of things which are held  together by cohesion, it is the air which is the compressing cause  which in iron is called \"hardness\", in stone \"thickness\" and in  solver \"whiteness\"'. Not only solidarity then, but also colours,  which Zeno called 'the first schematisms' of matter were regarded as  due to the mysterious agency of air. In fact, qualities in general  were but blasts and tensions of the air, which gave form and figure  to the inert matter underlying them.    As the man is in one sense the soul, in another the body, and in a  third the union of both, so it was with the cosmos. The word was used  in three senses--      (1) God    (2) the arrangement of the stars, etc.    (3) the combination of both.    The cosmos as identical with God was described as an individual made  up of all being who is incorruptible and ungenerated, the fashioner  of the ordered frame of the universe, who at certain periods of time  absorbs all being into himself and again generates it from himself.  Thus the cosmos on its external side was doomed to perish and the  mode of its destruction was to be by fire, a doctrine which has been  stamped upon the world's belief down to the present day. What was to  bring about this consummation was the soul of the universe becoming  too big for its body, which it would eventually swallow up  altogether. In the efflagration, when everything went back to the  primeval aether, the universe would be pure soul and alive equally  through and through. In this subtle and attenuated state, it would  require more room than before and so expand into the void,  contracting again when another period of cosmic generation had set  in. Hence the Stoic definition of the Void or Infinite as that into  which the cosmos is resolved at the efflagration.    In this theory of the contraction of the universe out of an ethereal  state and ultimate return to the same condition one sees a  resemblance to the modern scientific hypothesis of the origin of our  planetary system out of the solar nebula, and its predestined end in  the same. Especially is this the case with the form in which the  theory was held by Cleanthes, who pictured the heavenly bodies as  hastening to their own destruction by dashing themselves, like so  many gigantic moths, into the sun. Cleanthes however did not conceive  mere mechanical force to be at work in this matter. The grand  apotheosis of suicide which he foresaw was a voluntary act; for the  heavenly bodies were Gods and were willing to lose their own in a  larger life.    Thus all the deities except Zeus were mortal, or at all events,  perishable. Gods, like men, were destined to have an end some day.  They would melt in the great furnace of being as though they were  made of wax or tin. Zeus then would be left alone with his own  thoughts, or as the Stoics sometimes put it, Zeus would fall back  upon Providence. For by Providence they meant the leading principle  or mind of the whole, and by Zeus, as distinguished from Providence,  this mind together with the cosmos, which was to it as body. In the  efflagration the two would be fused into one in the single substance  of aether. And then in the fulness of time there would be a  restitution of all things. Everything would come round regularly  again exactly as it had been before.    To us who have been taught to pant for progress, this seems a dreary  prospect. But the Stoics were consistent Optimists, and did not ask  for a change in what was best. They were content that the one drama  of existence should enjoy a perpetual run without perhaps too nice a  consideration for the actors. Death intermitted life, but did not end  it. For the candle of life, which was extinguished now, would be  kindled again hereafter. Being and not being came round in endless  succession for all save him, into whom all being was resolved, and  out of whom it emerged again, as from the vortex of some aeonian  Maelstrom.      CONCLUSION    When Socrates declared before his judges that \"there is no evil to a  good man either in life or after death, nor are his affairs neglected  by the gods\", he sounded the keynote of Stoicism, with its two main  doctrines of virtue as the"]]]
