'As a matter of fact,' said Welch, changing the conversation with a  jerk, 'I don't much care if the cups are stolen. One doesn't only run  for the sake of the pot.'    Charteris groaned. 'Oh, well,' said he, 'if you're going to take the  high moral standpoint, and descend to brazen platitudes like that, I  give you up.'    'It's a rum thing about those pots,' said Welch, meditatively.    'Seems to me,' Jim rejoined, 'the rum thing is that a man who considers  the Pav. a safe place to keep a lot of valuable prizes in should be  allowed at large. Why couldn't they keep them in the Board Room as they  used to?'    'Thought it 'ud save trouble, I suppose. Save them carting the things  over to the Pav. on Sports Day,' hazarded Tony.    'Saved the burglar a lot of trouble, I should say,' observed Jackson,  'I could break into the Pav. myself in five minutes.'    'Good old Jackson,' said Charteris, 'have a shot tonight. I'll hold the  watch. I'm doing a leader on the melancholy incident for next month's  _Glow Worm_. It appears that Master Reginald Robinson, a member of  Mr Merevale's celebrated boarding-establishment, was passing by the  Pavilion at an early hour on the morning of the second of April--that's  today--when his eye was attracted by an excavation or incision in one  of the windows of that imposing edifice. His narrative appears on  another page. Interviewed by a _Glow Worm_ representative, Master  Robinson, who is a fine, healthy, bronzed young Englishman of some  thirteen summers, with a delightful, boyish flow of speech, not wholly  free from a suspicion of cheek, gave it as his opinion that the outrage  was the work of a burglar--a remarkable display of sagacity in one so  young. A portrait of Master Robinson appears on another page.'    'Everything seems to appear on another page,' said Jim. 'Am I to do the  portrait?'    'I think it would be best. You can never trust a photo to caricature a  person enough. Your facial H.B.'s the thing.'    'Have you heard whether anything else was bagged besides the cups?'  asked Welch.    'Not that I know of,' said Jim.    'Yes there was,' said Jackson. 'It further appears that that lunatic,  Adamson, had left some money in the pocket of his blazer, which he had  left in the Pav. overnight. On enquiry it was found that the money had  also left.'    Adamson was in the same House as Jackson, and had talked of nothing  else throughout the whole of lunch. He was an abnormally wealthy  individual, however, and it was generally felt, though he himself  thought otherwise, that he could afford to lose some of the surplus.    'How much?' asked Jim.    'Two pounds.'    At this Jim gave vent to the exclamation which Mr Barry Pain calls the  Englishman's shortest prayer.    'My dear sir,' said Charteris. 'My very dear sir. We blush for you.  Might I ask _why_ you take the matter to heart so?'    Jim hesitated.    'Better have it out, Jim,' said Tony. 'These chaps'll keep it dark all  right.' And Jim entered once again upon the recital of his doings on  the previous night.    'So you see,' he concluded, 'this two pound business makes it all the  worse.'    'I don't see why,' said Welch.    'Well, you see, money's a thing everybody wants, whereas cups wouldn't  be any good to a fellow at school. So that I should find it much harder  to prove that I didn't take the two pounds, than I should have done to  prove that I didn't take the cups.'    'But there's no earthly need for you to prove anything,' said Tony.  'There's not the slightest chance of your being found out.'    'Exactly,' observed Charteris. 'We will certainly respect your incog.  if you wish it. Wild horses shall draw no evidence from us. It is, of  course, very distressing, but what is man after all? Are we not as the  beasts that perish, and is not our little life rounded by a sleep?  Indeed, yes. And now--with full chorus, please.       '\"We-e take him from the city or the plough.     We-e dress him up in uniform so ne-e-e-at.\"'    And at the third line some plaster came down from the ceiling, and  Merevale came up, and the meeting dispersed without the customary  cheers.          [7]    BARRETT EXPLORES      Barrett stood at the window of his study with his hands in his pockets,  looking thoughtfully at the football field. Now and then he whistled.  That was to show that he was very much at his ease. He whistled a  popular melody of the day three times as slowly as its talented  composer had originally intended it to be whistled, and in a strange  minor key. Some people, when offended, invariably whistle in this  manner, and these are just the people with whom, if you happen to share  a study with them, it is rash to have differences of opinion. Reade,  who was deep in a book--though not so deep as he would have liked the  casual observer to fancy him to be--would have given much to stop  Barrett's musical experiments. To ask him to stop in so many words was,  of course, impossible. Offended dignity must draw the line somewhere.  That is one of the curious results of a polite education. When two  gentlemen of Hoxton or the Borough have a misunderstanding, they  address one another with even more freedom than is their usual custom.  When one member of a public school falls out with another member, his  politeness in dealing with him becomes so Chesterfieldian, that one  cannot help being afraid that he will sustain a strain from which he  will never recover.    After a time the tension became too much for Barrett. He picked up his  cap and left the room. Reade continued to be absorbed in his book.    It was a splendid day outside, warm for April, and with just that  freshness in the air which gets into the blood and makes Spring the  best time of the whole year. Barrett had not the aesthetic soul to any  appreciable extent, but he did know a fine day when he saw one, and  even he realized that a day like this was not to be wasted in pottering  about the School grounds watching the 'under thirteen' hundred yards  (trial heats) and the 'under fourteen' broad jump, or doing occasional  exercises in the gymnasium. It was a day for going far afield and not  returning till lock-up. He had an object, too. Everything seemed to  shout 'eggs' at him, to remind him that he was an enthusiast on the  subject and had a collection to which he ought to seize this excellent  opportunity of adding. The only question was, where to go. The  surrounding country was a Paradise for the naturalist who had no absurd  scruples on the subject of trespassing. To the west, in the direction  of Stapleton, the woods and hedges were thick with nests. But then, so  they were to the east along the Badgwick road. He wavered, but a  recollection that there was water in the Badgwick direction, and that  he might with luck beard a water-wagtail in its lair, decided him. What  is life without a water-wagtail's egg? A mere mockery. He turned east.    'Hullo, Barrett, where are you off to?' Grey, of Prater's House,  intercepted him as he was passing.    'Going to see if I can get some eggs. Are you coming?'    Grey hesitated. He was a keen naturalist, too.    'No, I don't think I will, thanks. Got an uncle coming down to see me.'    'Well, cut off before he comes.'    'No, he'd be too sick. Besides,' he added, ingenuously, 'there's a  possible tip. Don't want to miss that. I'm simply stony. Always am at  end of term.'    'Oh,' said Barrett, realizing that further argument would be thrown  away. 'Well, so long, then.'    'So long. Hope you have luck.'    'Thanks. I say.'    'Well?'    'Roll-call, you know. If you don't see me anywhere about, you might  answer my name.'    'All right. And if you find anything decent, you might remember me. You  know pretty well what I've got already.'    'Right, I will.'    'Magpie's what I want particularly. Where are you going, by the way?'    'Thought of having a shot at old Venner's woods. I'm after a  water-wagtail myself. Ought to be one or two in the Dingle.'    'Heaps, probably. But I should advise you to look out, you know.  Venner's awfully down on trespassing.'    'Yes, the bounder. But I don't think he'll get me. One gets the knack  of keeping fairly quiet with practice.'    'He's got thousands of keepers.'    'Millions.'    'Dogs, too.'    'Dash his beastly dogs. I like dogs. Why are you such a croaker today,  Grey?'    'Well, you know he's had two chaps sacked for going in his woods to my  certain knowledge, Morton-Smith and Ainsworth. That's only since I've  been at the Coll., too. Probably lots more before that.'    'Ainsworth was booked smoking there. That's why he was sacked. And  Venner caught Morton-Smith himself simply staggering under dead  rabbits. They sack any chap for poaching.'    'Well, I don't see how you're going to show you've not been poaching.  Besides, it's miles out of bounds.'    'Grey,' said Barrett, severely, 'I'm surprised at you. Go away and meet  your beastly uncle. Fancy talking about bounds at your time of life.'    'Well, don't forget me when you're hauling in the eggs.'    'Right you are. So long.'    Barrett proceeded on his way, his last difficulty safely removed. He  could rely on Grey not to bungle that matter of roll-call. Grey had  been there before.    A long white ribbon of dusty road separated St Austin's from the lodge  gates of Badgwick Hall, the country seat of Sir Alfred Venner, M.P.,  also of 49A Lancaster Gate, London. Barrett walked rapidly for over  half-an-hour before he came in sight of the great iron gates, flanked  on the one side by a trim little lodge and green meadows, and on the  other by woods of a darker green. Having got so far, he went on up the  hill till at last he arrived at his destination. A small hedge, a  sloping strip of green, and then the famous Dingle. I am loath to  inflict any scenic rhapsodies on the reader, but really the Dingle"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6985"],[0,"A Prefect's Uncle (#9)"],[1,"known that he would not have been there  while the match was going on. But his brain, fatigued with his recent  calculations, had not noted this point.    The study was empty.    Most people, on finding themselves in a strange and empty room, are  seized with a desire to explore the same, and observe from internal  evidence what manner of man is the owner. Nowhere does character come  out so clearly as in the decoration of one's private den. Many a man,  at present respected by his associates, would stand forth unmasked at  his true worth, could the world but look into his room. For there they  would see that he was so lost to every sense of shame as to cover his  books with brown paper, or deck his walls with oleographs presented  with the Christmas numbers, both of which habits argue a frame of mind  fit for murderers, stratagems, and spoils. Let no such man be trusted.    The Bishop's study, which Farnie now proceeded to inspect, was not of  this kind. It was a neat study, arranged with not a little taste. There  were photographs of teams with the College arms on their plain oak  frames, and photographs of relations in frames which tried to look, and  for the most part succeeded in looking, as if they had not cost  fourpence three farthings at a Christmas bargain sale. There were  snap-shots of various moving incidents in the careers of the Bishop and  his friends: Marriott, for example, as he appeared when carried to the  Pavilion after that sensational century against the Authentics:  Robertson of Blaker's winning the quarter mile: John Brown, Norris's  predecessor in the captaincy, and one of the four best batsmen Beckford  had ever had, batting at the nets: Norris taking a skier on the  boundary in last year's M.C.C. match: the Bishop himself going out to  bat in the Charchester match, and many more of the same sort.    All these Farnie observed with considerable interest, but as he moved  towards the book-shelf his eye was caught by an object more interesting  still. It was a cash-box, simple and unornamental, but undoubtedly a  cash-box, and as he took it up it rattled.    The key was in the lock. In a boarding House at a public school it is  not, as a general rule, absolutely necessary to keep one's valuables  always hermetically sealed. The difference between _meum_ and  _tuum_ is so very rarely confused by the occupants of such an  establishment, that one is apt to grow careless, and every now and then  accidents happen. An accident was about to happen now.    It was at first without any motive except curiosity that Farnie opened  the cash-box. He merely wished to see how much there was inside, with a  view to ascertaining what his prospects of negotiating a loan with his  relative were likely to be. When, however, he did see, other feelings  began to take the place of curiosity. He counted the money. There were  ten sovereigns, one half-sovereign, and a good deal of silver. One of  the institutions at Beckford was a mission. The School by (more or  less) voluntary contributions supported a species of home somewhere in  the wilds of Kennington. No one knew exactly what or where this home  was, but all paid their subscriptions as soon as possible in the term,  and tried to forget about it. Gethryn collected not only for  Leicester's House, but also for the Sixth Form, and was consequently,  if only by proxy, a man of large means. _Too_ large, Farnie  thought. Surely four pounds, to be paid back (probably) almost at once,  would not be missed. Why shouldn't he--    'Hullo!'    Farnie spun round. Wilson was standing in the doorway.    'Hullo, Farnie,' said he, 'what are you playing at in here?'    'What are you?' retorted Farnie politely.    'Come to fetch a book. Marriott said I might. What are you up to?'    'Oh, shut up!' said Farnie. 'Why shouldn't I come here if I like?  Matter of fact, I came to see Gethryn.'    'He isn't here,' said Wilson luminously.    'You don't mean to say you've noticed that already? You've got an eye  like a hawk, Wilson. I was just taking a look round, if you really want  to know.'    'Well, I shouldn't advise you to let Marriott catch you mucking his  study up. Seen a book called _Round the Red Lamp_? Oh, here it is.  Coming over to the field?'    'Not just yet. I want to have another look round. Don't you wait,  though.'    'Oh, all right.' And Wilson retired with his book.    Now, though Wilson at present suspected nothing, not knowing of the  existence of the cash-box, Farnie felt that when the money came to be  missed, and inquiries were made as to who had been in the study, and  when, he would recall the interview. Two courses, therefore, remained  open to him. He could leave the money altogether, or he could take it  and leave himself. In other words, run away.    In the first case there would, of course, remain the chance that he  might induce Gethryn to lend him the four pounds, but this had never  been more than a forlorn hope; and in the light of the possibilities  opened out by the cash-box, he thought no more of it. The real problem  was, should he or should he not take the money from the cash-box?    As he hesitated, the recollection of Monk's veiled threats came back to  him, and he wavered no longer. He opened the box again, took out the  contents, and dropped them into his pocket. While he was about it, he  thought he might as well take all as only a part.    Then he wrote two notes. One--to the Bishop--he placed on top of the  cash-box; the other he placed with four sovereigns on the table in  Monk's study. Finally he left the room, shut the door carefully behind  him, and went to the yard at the back of the House, where he kept his  bicycle.    The workings of the human mind, and especially of the young human mind,  are peculiar. It never occurred to Farnie that a result equally  profitable to himself, and decidedly more convenient for all  concerned--with the possible exception of Monk--might have been arrived  at if he had simply left the money in the box, and run away without it.    However, as the poet says, you can't think of everything.          [7]    THE BISHOP GOES FOR A RIDE      The M.C.C. match opened auspiciously. Norris, for the first time that  season, won the toss. Tom Brown, we read, in a similar position, 'with  the usual liberality of young hands', put his opponents in first.  Norris was not so liberal. He may have been young, but he was not so  young as that. The sun was shining on as true a wicket as was ever  prepared when he cried 'Heads', and the coin, after rolling for some  time in diminishing circles, came to a standstill with the dragon  undermost. And Norris returned to the Pavilion and informed his  gratified team that, all things considered, he rather thought that they  would bat, and he would be obliged if Baker would get on his pads and  come in first with him.    The M.C.C. men took the field--O. T. Blackwell, by the way, had shrunk  into a mere brother of the century-making A. T.--and the two School  House representatives followed them. An amateur of lengthy frame took  the ball, a man of pace, to judge from the number of slips. Norris  asked for 'two leg'. An obliging umpire informed him that he had got  two leg. The long bowler requested short slip to stand finer, swung his  arm as if to see that the machinery still worked, and dashed wildly  towards the crease. The match had begun.    There are few pleasanter or more thrilling moments in one's school  career than the first over of a big match. Pleasant, that is to say, if  you are actually looking on. To have to listen to a match being started  from the interior of a form-room is, of course, maddening. You hear the  sound of bat meeting ball, followed by distant clapping. Somebody has  scored. But who and what? It may be a four, or it may be a mere single.  More important still, it may be the other side batting after all. Some  miscreant has possibly lifted your best bowler into the road. The  suspense is awful. It ought to be a School rule that the captain of the  team should send a message round the form-rooms stating briefly and  lucidly the result of the toss. Then one would know where one was. As  it is, the entire form is dependent on the man sitting under the  window. The form-master turns to write on the blackboard. The only hope  of the form shoots up like a rocket, gazes earnestly in the direction  of the Pavilion, and falls back with a thud into his seat. 'They  haven't started yet,' he informs the rest in a stage whisper.  'Si-_lence_,' says the form-master, and the whole business must be  gone through again, with the added disadvantage that the master now has  his eye fixed coldly on the individual nearest the window, your only  link with the outer world.    Various masters have various methods under such circumstances. One more  than excellent man used to close his book and remark, 'I think we'll  make up a little party to watch this match.' And the form, gasping its  thanks, crowded to the windows. Another, the exact antithesis of this  great and good gentleman, on seeing a boy taking fitful glances through  the window, would observe acidly, 'You are at perfect liberty, Jones,  to watch the match if you care to, but if you do you will come in in  the afternoon and make up the time you waste.' And as all that could be  seen from that particular window was one of the umpires and a couple of  fieldsmen, Jones would reluctantly elect to reserve himself, and for  the present to turn his attention to Euripides again.    If you are one of the team, and watch the match from the Pavilion, you  escape these trials, but there are others. In the first few overs of a  School match, every ball looks to the spectators like taking a wicket.  The fiendish ingenuity of the slow bowler, and the lightning speed of  the fast man at the other end, make one feel positively ill. When the  first ten has gone up on the scoring-board matters begin to right  themselves."]]]
