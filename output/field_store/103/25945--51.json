One man revived during the inquest, knocked  the foreman of the jury through the window, kicked the coroner in the  stomach, fed him a bottle of violet ink, and, with a shriek of laughter,  fled. He is now traveling under an assumed name with a mammoth circus,  feeding his bald head to the African lion twice a day at $9 a week and  found.    [Illustration]          Down East Rum.    Rum has always been a curse to the State of Maine. The steady fight that  Maine has made, for a century past, against decent rum, has been worthy of  a better cause.    Who hath woe? who hath sorrow and some more things of that kind? He that  monkeyeth with Maine rum; he that goeth to seek emigrant rum.    In passing through Maine the tourist is struck with the ever-varying  styles of mystery connected with the consumption of rum.    In Denver your friend says: \"Will you come with me and shed a tear?\" or  \"Come and eat a clove with me.\"    In Salt Lake City a man once said to me: \"William, which would you rather  do, take a dose of Gentile damnation down here on the corner, or go over  across the street and pizen yourself with some real old Mormon Valley tan,  made last week from ground feed and prussic acid?\" I told him that I had  just been to dinner, and the doctor had forbidden my drinking any more,  and that I had promised several people on their death beds never to touch  liquor, and besides, I had just taken a large drink, so he would have to  excuse me.    But in Maine none of these common styles of invitation prevail. It is all  shrouded in mystery. You give the sign of distress to any member in good  standing, pound three times on the outer gate, give two hard kicks and one  soft one on the inner door, give the password, \"Rutherford B. Hayes,\" turn  to the left, through a dark passage, turn the thumbscrew of a mysterious  gas fixture 90 deg. to the right, holding the goblet of the encampment  under the gas fixture, then reverse the thumbscrew, shut your eyes, insult  your digester, leave twenty-five cents near the gas fixture, and hunt up  the nearest cemetery, so that you will not have to be carried very far.    If a man really wants to drink himself into a drunkard's grave, he can  certainly save time by going to Maine. Those desiring the most prompt and  vigorous style of jim-jams at cut rates will do well to examine Maine  goods before going elsewhere. Let a man spend a week in Boston, where the  Maine liquor law, I understand, is not in force, and then, with no warning  whatever, be taken into the heart of Maine; let him land there a stranger  and a partial orphan, with no knowledge of the underground methods of  securing a drink, and to him the world seems very gloomy, very sad, and  extremely arid.    At the Bangor depot a woman came up to me and addressed me. She was rather  past middle age, a perfect lady in her manners, but a little full.    I said: \"Madam, I guess you will have to excuse me. You have the  advantage. I can't just speak your name at this moment. It has been now  thirty years since I left Maine, a child two years old. So people have  changed. You've no idea how people have grown out of my knowledge. I don't  see but you look just as young as you did when I went away, but I'm a poor  hand to remember names, so I can't just call you to mind.\"    She was perfectly ladylike in her manner, but a little bit drunk. It is  singular how drunken people will come hundreds of miles to converse with  me. I have often been alluded to as the \"drunkard's friend.\" Men have been  known to get intoxicated and come a long distance to talk with me on some  subject, and then they would lean up against me and converse by the hour.  A drunken man never seems to get tired of talking with me. As long as I am  willing to hold such a man up and listen to him, he will stand and tell me  about himself with the utmost confidence, and, no matter who goes by, he  does not seem to be ashamed to have people see him talking with me.    [Illustration: THAT BUTTONHOLE.]    I once had a friend who was very much liked by every one, so he drifted  into politics. For seven years he tried to live on free whiskey and  popular approval, but it wrecked him at last. Finally he formed the habit  of meeting me every day and explaining it to me, and giving me free  exhibitions of a breath that he had acquired at great expense. After he  got so feeble that he could not walk any more, this breath of his used to  pull him out of bed and drag him all over town. It don't seem hardly  possible, but it is so. I can show you the town yet.    He used to take me by the buttonhole when he conversed with me. This is a  diagram of the buttonhole.    If I had a son I would warn him against trying to subsist solely on  popular approval and free whiskey. It may do for a man engaged solely in  sedentary pursuits, but it is not sufficient in cases of great muscular  exhaustion. Free whiskey and popular approval on an empty stomach are  highly injurious.          Railway Etiquette.    Many people have traveled all their lives and yet do not know how to  behave themselves when on the road. For the benefit and guidance of such,  these few crisp, plain, horse-sense rules of etiquette have been framed.    In traveling by rail on foot, turn to the right on discovering an  approaching train. If you wish the train to turn out, give two loud toots  and get in between the rails, so that you will not muss up the right of  way. Many a nice, new right of way has been ruined by getting a pedestrian  tourist spattered all over its first mortgage.    On retiring at night on board the train, do not leave your teeth in the  ice-water tank. If every one should do so, it would occasion great  confusion in case of wreck. It would also cause much annoyance and delay  during the resurrection. Experienced tourists tie a string to their teeth  and retain them during the night.    If you have been reared in extreme poverty, and your mother supported you  until you grew up and married, so that your wife could support you, you  will probably sit in four seats at the same time, with your feet extended  into the aisles so that you can wipe them off on other people, while you  snore with your mouth open clear to your shoulder blades.    If you are prone to drop to sleep and breathe with a low death rattle,  like the exhaust of a bath tub, it would be a good plan to tie up your  head in a feather bed and then insert the whole thing in the linen closet;  or, if you cannot secure that, you might stick it out of the window and  get it knocked off against a tunnel. The stockholders of the road might  get mad about it, but you could do it in such a way that they wouldn't  know whose head it was.    Ladies and gentlemen should guard against traveling by rail while in a  beastly state of intoxication.    In the dining car, while eating, do not comb your moustache with your  fork. By all means do not comb your moustache with the fork of another. It  is better to refrain altogether from combing the moustache with a fork  while traveling, for the motion of the train might jab the fork into your  eye and irritate it.    If your desert is very hot and you do not discover it until you have  burned the rafters out of the roof of your mouth, do not utter a wild yell  of agony and spill your coffee all over a total stranger, but control  yourself, hoping to know more next time.    In the morning is a good time to find out how many people have succeeded  in getting on the passenger train, who ought to be in the stock car.    Generally, you will find one male and one female. The male goes into the  wash room, bathes his worthless carcass from daylight until breakfast  time, walking on the feet of any man who tries to wash his face during  that time. He wipes himself on nine different towels, because when he gets  home, he knows he will have to wipe his face on an old door mat. People  who have been reared on hay all their lives, generally want to fill  themselves full of pie and colic when they travel.    The female of this same mammal, goes into the ladies' department and  remains there until starvation drives her out. Then the real ladies have  about thirteen seconds apiece in which to dress.    If you never rode in a varnished car before, and never expect to again,  you will probably roam up and down the car, meandering over the feet of  the porter while he is making up the berths. This is a good way to let  people see just how little sense you had left after your brain began to  soften.    In traveling, do not take along a lot of old clothes that you know you  will never wear.          B. Franklin, Deceased.    Benjamin Franklin, formerly of Boston, came very near being an only child.  If seventeen children had not come to bless the home of Benjamin's  parents, they would have been childless. Think of getting up in the  morning and picking out your shoes and stockings from among seventeen  pairs of them. Imagine yourself a child, gentle reader, in a family where  you would be called upon, every morning, to select your own cud of spruce  gum from a collection of seventeen similar cuds stuck on a window sill.  And yet B. Franklin never murmured or repined. He desired to go to sea,  and to avoid this he was apprenticed to his brother James, who was a  printer. It is said that Franklin at once took hold of the great  Archimedean lever, and jerked it early and late in the interests of  freedom. It is claimed that Franklin at this time invented the deadly  weapon known as the printer's towel. He found that a common crash towel  could be saturated with glue, molasses, antimony, concentrated lye, and  roller composition, and that after a few years of time and perspiration it  would harden so that the \"Constant Reader\" or \"Veritas\" could be stabbed  with it and die soon.    [Illustration: A DEADLY ONSLAUGHT.]    Many believe that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8299"],[0,"Filipino Popular Tales (#9)"],[1,"eating-capacity; his parents (or guardian)  are driven by poverty to attempt to kill him (usually twice, sometimes  thrice), but their efforts are vain; he finally determines to leave  home, often taking with him some mighty weapon. From this point on,  the narratives differ widely. All are alike in this respect, however:  the hero never marries. Obviously this group of stories is connected  with two well-known European cycles of folk-tales,--\"Strong Hans\"  and \"John the Bear.\" The points of resemblance will be indicated  below in an analysis of the incidents found in the members of our  group. (Variants are referred to by italicized lower-case letters thus:  a [Pusong], b [Cabagboc], etc. No. 3 refers to our complete story of  \"Carancal.\")      A Hero is born as result of childless couple's unceasing petitions  to Heaven (3, a, f, g), and is only a span in length when born (c,  d, g). Three of the tales do not mention anything definite about the  hero's birth (b, e, h). In all, however, his name is significant,  indicating the fact that he is either a dwarf, or wonderfully strong,  or a glutton (3 Carancal, from Tag. dangkal, \"a palm;\" [a] Pusong,  from Vis. puso, \"paunch, belly;\" [b] Cabagboc, from Bicol, \"strong;\"  [c] Sandapal, from Tag. dapal, \"a span;\" [d] Sandangcal, from Pampangan  dangkal = Tag.; [f] Tapon, Ilocano for \"short;\" [g] and [h] Tangarangan  and Dangandangan, from Ilocano dangan, \"a span\"). a describes the  hero as having \"a big head and large stomach,\" but as being \"very,  very strong, he ate a sack of corn or rice every day.\" In b the hero  \"had great strength even when an infant.\" Sandangcal (d) required  a carabao-liver every meal. In e the hero's voracious appetite is  mentioned. The hero in c \"would eat everything in the house, leaving  no food for his parents.\" Juan Tapon (f), when three years old, \"used  to eat daily half a ganta of rice and a pound of meat, besides fish and  vegetables;\" the quantity of food he required increased steadily until,  when he was fourteen, his parents could no longer support him. However,  he never grew taller than a six-year-old boy. Dangandangan (g) could  walk and talk the day he was born. He could eat one cavan of rice  and one carabao daily. The hero of h was so greedy that by the time  he was a \"young man\" his father could no longer support him. He is  described as a \"dwarf\" In c and d there is nothing to indicate that  the hero was not always a Tom Thumb in size.    Nearly all these details may be found duplicated in Maerchen of the  \"John the Bear\" and \"Strong Hans\" types. For analogues, see Friedrich  Panzer's Beowulf, pp. 28-33, 47-48, 50-52. In Grimm's story of the  \"Young Giant\" (No. 90) the hero, when born, was only as big as a thumb,  and for several years did not grow one hair's breadth. But a giant  got hold of him and suckled him for six years, during which time he  grew tall and strong, after the manner of giants. It is interesting  to note that none of the nine Filipino versions make any reference to  an animal parentage or extraordinary source of nourishment of the hero.    B The poverty of the parents is the motive for their attempts on his  life in a, c, d, e, f, h. In a the mother proposes the scheme; in h,  the father; in g it is the boy's uncle, by whom he had been adopted  when his parents died. This \"unnatural parents\" motif is lacking in  the European variants.    B1-5 With the various attempts to destroy the hero may be discussed his  escapes (C1-3). The \"falling-tree\" episode occurs in all the stories  but one (b). The events of this incident are conducted in various  ways. In a, c, h, the hero is told to \"catch the tree when it falls,\"  so that he can carry it home (in c the hero is pushed clear into the  ground by the weight of the tree). In d the father directs his son to  stand in a certain place, \"so that the tree will not fall on him;\" but  when Sandangcal sees that he is about to be crushed, he nimbly jumps  aside unobserved by his father, who thinks him killed. In f the tree  is made to fall on the body of the sleeping hero. In g Darangdarang is  told to stand beside the tree being cut: it falls on him. In all the  stories but d the hero performs the feat of carrying home a tree on his  shoulders (C1). This episode is not uncommon in the European versions  (see Panzer, op. cit., p. 35), but there the hero performs it while  out at service. By the process of contamination these two incidents  (B1C1) have worked their way into another Filipino story not of our  cycle,--the Visayan story of \"Juan the Student\" (see JAFL 19 : 104).    B2 Of the other methods of putting an end to the hero's life, the  \"well\" episode is the most common. In d and h father and son go  to dig a well. When it is several metres deep, the father rains  stones on the boy, who is working at the bottom, and leaves him  for dead. In g the hero is sent down a well to find a lost ring;  and while he is there, stones and rocks are thrown on him by his  treacherous uncle. In all three the hero escapes, wiser, but none  the worse, for his adventure (C3). This incident is very common in  European members of the cycle. Bolte and Polivka (2 : 288-292) note  its occurrence in twenty-five different stories.    B3 In our story of \"Carancal,\" as has been remarked, and in e,  the father commands his son to dive into deep water to see if the  fishing-net is intact. Seeing blood and foam appear on the surface  of the water, the father goes home, confident that he is rid of his  son at last; but not long afterward, when the parents are eating, the  hero appears, carrying on his shoulder a huge crocodile he has killed  (C2). Analogous to this exploit is Sandapal's capture of the king of  the fishes, after his father has faithlessly pushed him overboard into  the deep sea (c). The hero's fight under water with a monstrous fish or  crocodile, the blood and foam telling the story of a desperate struggle  going on, reminds one strongly of Beowulf's fight with Grendel's dam.    B4 In c, as a last resort, the father takes his son to the king,  and has the best royal warrior fight the small boy. Sandapal  conquers in five minutes. In f the father persuades his son to  enter a wrestling-match held by the king. Juan easily throws all his  opponents. With this incident compare the Middle-English \"Tale of  Gamelyn\" (ll. 183-270) and Shakespeare's \"As You Like It\" (act i,  sc. ii).    B5 In a the father, at the instigation of his wife, pushes large  rocks from a cliff down upon his son by the seashore; but the son  returns home later, rolling an immense bowlder that threatens to  crush the house.    D, D1 Satisfied that he is no longer wanted at home, the hero sets  out on adventures (a, g, h), taking along with him as a weapon a bolo  five yards long (3), or a mighty bolo his father had given him,--such  a one that none but the hero could wield it (g), or a short stout club  (h). In b the parents are not cruel to their son. The hero leaves home  with the kindest of feeling for his father. He carries along with  him an enormous top, so heavy that four persons could not lift it,  and which, when spun, could be heard for miles; a long sword made  by a blacksmith; and a wooden sheath for it made by the father. In  the European versions of the story the weapons of the hero play an  important part (see Panzer, 39-43). In c the story ends with the sale  of Sandapal to the king. In d, after Sandangcal has escaped from the  well, he comes home at night, and, finding his parents asleep, shakes  the house. Thinking it is an earthquake, they jump from the windows  in terror, and are killed. (This incident is also told as a separate  story; see JAFL 20 : 305, No. 17.) After the hero has eaten up all  the livestock he had inherited by their death, he sells his property  and sets out on his travels. In e the father sells his greedy son to  merchants. In f the parents finally give up attempts on their son's  life, and he goes away to join the army.    E The companions--Carancal (3), Cabagboc (b), Sandangcal (d), and  Dangandangan (g)--meet with extraordinary men, who accompany them  on their travels. Cabagboc surpasses Cabual (\"Breaker\") and Cagabot  (\"Uprooter\") in a contest of skill, and they agree to go with him as  his servants. Dangandangan meets two strong men,--Paridis, who uproots  forests with his hands; and Aolo, [17] the mighty fisher for sharks,  whose net is so large that weights as big as mortars are needed to  sink it. But neither of these two can turn the hero's bolo over,  hence they become his servants. Sandangcal (d), who nowhere in the  story displays any great strength, rather only craftiness and greed,  meets one at a time three strong fellows, whom he persuades to go with  him by promising to double the sum they had been working for. These men  are Mountain-Destroyer, who could destroy a mountain with one blow of  his club; Blower, who could refresh the whole world with his breath;  and Messenger, whose steps were one hundred leagues apart. This story,  which seems to be far removed from the other tales of the group,  has obviously been influenced by stories of the \"Skilful Companions\"  cycle (see No. 11), where the hero merely directs his servants,  doing none of the work himself. On the other hand, in 3, b, g, the  wonderful companions are more or less impedimenta: the hero himself  does all the hard work; they are merely his foil. For the \"Genossen\"  in other Maerchen of \"John the Bear\" type, see Panzer, 66-74; Cosquin,  1 : 9, 23-27.    F1 The adventure with the demon in the house in the forest, related  in 3, is not found in the other Filipino versions of the tale. It  is found in the Islands, however, in the form of a separate story,  two widely different variants of which are printed below (4, [a]  and [b]). This incident occurs in nearly all the folk-tales of the  \"John the Bear\" type. Bolte and Polivka, in their notes to Grimm,  No. 91 (2 : 301-315),"]]]
