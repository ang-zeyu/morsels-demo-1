I was so tired I  scarcely could set down the jar and straighten my cramped arms  when I had the opportunity.  I had expected my family to be  delighted over my  treasure, but they  exhibited an astonishing  indifference, and were far more concerned over the state of my  blistered face.  I would not hear of putting my Half-luna on the  basement screen as they suggested, but enthroned it in state on  the best lace curtains at a parlour window, covered the sill with  leaves and flowers, and went to bed happy.  The following morning  my sisters said a curtain was ruined, and when they removed it to  attempt restoration, the general consensus of opinion seemed to be  that something was a nuisance, I could not tell whether it was I,  or the Half-luna.  On coming to the parlour a little later, ladened  with leaves and flowers, my treasure was gone.  The cook was sure  it had flown from the door over some one's head, and she said very  tersely that it was a burning shame, and if such carelessness as  that ever occurred again she would quit her job.  Such is the  confidence of a child that I accepted my loss as an inevitable accident,  and tried to be brave to comfort her, although my heart was almost  broken. Of course they freed my moth.  They never would have dared  but that the little mother's couch stood all day empty now, and her  chair unused beside it.  My  disappointment was so deep and  far-reaching it made me ill then they scolded me, and said I had half  killed myself carrying that heavy jar in the hot sunshine, although  the pain from which I suffered was neither in my arms nor sunburned face.    So I lost my first Cecropia, and from that day until a woman  grown and much of this material secured, in all my field work  among the birds, flowers, and animals, I never had seen another.  They had taunted me in museums, and been my envy in private  collections, but find one, I could not.  When in my field work  among the birds, so many moths of other families almost had thrust  themselves upon me that I began a collection of reproductions of  them, I found little difficulty in securing almost anything else.  I could picture Sphinx Moths in any position I chose, and Lunas  seemed eager to pose for me.  A friend carried to me a beautiful  tan-coloured Polyphemus with transparent moons like isinglass  set in its wings of softest velvet down, and as for butterflies,  it was not necessary  to go afield for them; they came to me.  I could pick a Papilio Ajax, that some of my friends were years  in securing, from the pinks in my  garden.  A pair of Antiopas spent  a night, and waited to be pictured in the morning, among the leaves  of my passion vine.  Painted Beauties swayed along my flowered walks,  and in September a Viceroy reigned in state on every chrysanthemum,  and a Monarch was enthroned on every sunbeam.  No luck was too good  for me, no butterfly or moth too rare, except forever and always  the coveted Cecropia, and by this time I had learned to my disgust  that it was one of the commonest of all.    Then one summer, late in June, a small boy, having an earnest,  eager little face, came to me tugging a large box.  He said he had  something for me.  He said \"they  called it a butterfly, but he  was sure it never was.\"  He was eminently correct.  He had a  splendid big Cecropia.  I was delighted.  Of course to have found  one myself would have filled my cup to overflowing, but to secure  a perfect, living specimen was good enough.  For the first time my  childish loss seemed in a measure compensated.  Then, I only could  study a moth to my  satisfaction and set it free; now, I could make  reproductions so perfect that every antler of its antennae could  be counted with the naked eye, and copy its colours accurately,  before giving back its liberty.    I asked him whether he wanted money or a picture of it, and as I  expected, he said 'money,' so he was paid.  An hour later he came  back and said he wanted the picture.  On being questioned as to his  change of heart, he said \"mamma told him to say he wanted the  picture, and she would give him the money.\"  My sympathy was with  her.  I wanted the studies I intended to make of that Cecropia  myself, and I wanted them very badly.    I opened the box to examine the moth, and found it so numb with the  cold over night, and so worn and helpless, that it could not cling  to a leaf or twig.  I tried repeatedly, and fearing that it had  been subjected to rough treatment, and soon would be lifeless, for  these moths live only a short time, I hastily set up a camera  focusing on a branch.  Then I tried posing my  specimen.  Until  the third time it fell, but the fourth it clung, and crept down a  twig, settling at last in a position that far, surpassed any  posing that I could do.  I was very  pleased, and yet it made a  complication.  It had gone so far that it might be off the plate  and from focus.  It seemed so stupid and helpless that I decided  to risk a peep at the glass, and hastily  removing the  plate and changing the shutter, a slight but most essential  alteration was made, everything replaced, and the bulb caught up.  There was only a breath of sound as I turned, and then I stood  horrified, for my Cecropia was sailing over a large elm tree in a  corner of the orchard, and for a block my gaze followed it skyward,  flying like a bird before it vanished in the distance, so quickly  had it recovered in fresh air and sunshine.    I have undertaken to describe some very difficult things, but I  would not attempt to portray my feelings, and three days later  there was no change.  It was in the height of my season of field  work, and I had several extremely interesting series of bird  studies on hand, and many  miscellaneous subjects.  In those days  some pictures were secured that I then thought, and yet feel, will  live, but nothing mattered to me.  There was a standing joke among  my  friends that I never would be satisfied with my field work  until I had made a study  of a 'Ha-ha bird,'  but I doubt if even  that specimen would have lifted the gloom of those days.  Everything  was a drag, and frequently I would think over it all in detail,  and roundly bless myself for taking a prize so rare, to me  at least, into the open.    The third day stands lurid in my memory.  It was the hottest,  most difficult day of all my years of experience afield.  The  temperature ranged from 104  to 108 in the village, and in  quarries open to the east, flat fields, and steaming swamps it  certainly could have been no cooler.  With set cameras I was  working for a shot at a hawk that was feeding on all the young  birds and rabbits in the vicinity of its nest.  I also wanted a  number of studies to fill a commission that was pressing me.  Subjects for several pictures had been found, and exposures made  on them when the weather was so hot that the rubber slide of a plate  holder would curl like a horseshoe if not laid on a case, and held  flat by a camera while I worked.  Perspiration dried, and the  landscape took on a sombre black velvet hue, with a liberal  sprinkling of gold stars.  I sank into a stupor going home,  and an old farmer aroused me, and disentangled my horse from a  thicket of wild briers into which it had strayed.  He said most  emphatically that if I did not know enough to remain indoors  weather like that, my friends should appoint me a 'guardeen.'    I reached the village more worn in body and spirit than I ever had  been.  I felt that I could not endure another degree of heat on the  back of my head, and I was much discouraged concerning my work.  Why not drop it all, and go where there were cool forests and  breezes sighing?  Perhaps my studies were not half so good as I  thought!  Perhaps people would not care for them!  For that matter,  perhaps the editors and publishers never would give the public an  opportunity to see my  work at all!    I dragged a heavy load up the steps and swung it to the veranda,  and there stood almost paralysed.  On the top step, where I could  not reach the Cabin door without seeing it, newly emerged, and  slowly exercising a pair of big wings, with every gaudy marking  fresh with new life, was the finest Cecropia I ever had seen  anywhere.  Recovering myself with a start, I had it under my net  that had waited twenty years to cover it!  Inside the door I dropped  the net, and the moth crept on my fingers.  What luck!  What extra  golden luck!  I almost felt that God had been sorry for me, and sent  it there to encourage me to keep on picturing the beauties and  wonders of His creations for people who could not go afield to see  for themselves, and to teach those who could to protect helpless,  harmless things for their use and beauty.    I walked down the hall, and vaguely scanned the solid rows of  books and specimens lining the library walls.  I scarcely  realized the thought that was in my mind, but what I was looking  for was not there.  The dining-room then, with panelled walls and  curtains of tapestry?  It was not there!  Straight to the white  and gold music room I went.  Then a realizing sense came to me.  It was BRUSSELS LACE for which I was searching!  On the most  delicate, snowiest place possible, on the finest curtain there, I  placed my Cecropia, and then stepped back and gazed at it with a  sort of \"Touch it over my dead body\" sentiment in my heart.  An effort was required to arouse myself, to realize that I was not  dreaming.  To search the fields and woods for twenty  years, and  then find the specimen I had sought awaiting me at my own door!  Well might it have been a dream, but that the Cecropia, clinging  to the meshes of the lace, slowly opening and closing its wings  to strengthen them for flight, could be nothing but a delightful  reality.    A few days later, in the valley of the Wood Robin, while searching  for its nest I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4908"],[0,"Five of Maxwell's Papers (#9)"],[1," the motion of immense numbers of  atoms, the limitation of our faculties forces us to abandon the  attempt to express the exact history of each atom, and to be content  with estimating the average condition of a group of atoms large enough  to be visible.  This method of dealing with groups of atoms, which I  may call the statistical method, and which in the present state of our  knowledge is the only available method of studying the properties of  real bodies, involves an abandonment of strict dynamical principles,  and an adoption of the mathematical methods belonging to the theory of  probability.  It is probable that important results will be obtained  by the application of this method, which is as yet little known and is  not familiar to our minds.  If the actual history of Science had been  different, and if the scientific doctrines most familiar to us had  been those which must be expressed in this way, it is possible that we  might have considered the existence of a certain kind of contingency a  self-evident truth, and treated the doctrine of philosophical  necessity as a mere sophism.    About the beginning of this century, the properties of bodies were  investigated by several distinguished French mathematicians on the  hypothesis that they are systems of molecules in equilibrium.  The  somewhat unsatisfactory nature of the results of these investigations  produced, especially in this country, a reaction in favour of the  opposite method of treating bodies as if they were, so far at least as  our experiments are concerned, truly continuous.  This method, in the  hands of Green, Stokes, and others, has led to results, the value of  which does not at all depend on what theory we adopt as to the  ultimate constitution of bodies.    One very important result of the investigation of the properties of  bodies on the hypothesis that they are truly continuous is that it  furnishes us with a test by which we can ascertain, by experiments on  a real body, to what degree of tenuity it must be reduced before it  begins to give evidence that its properties are no longer the same as  those of the body in mass.  Investigations of this kind, combined with  a study of various phenomena of diffusion and of dissipation of  energy, have recently added greatly to the evidence in favour of the  hypothesis that bodies are systems of molecules in motion.    I hope to be able to lay before you in the course of the term some of  the evidence for the existence of molecules, considered as individual  bodies having definite properties.  The molecule, as it is presented to  the scientific imagination, is a very different body from any of those  with which experience has hitherto made us acquainted.    In the first place its mass, and the other constants which define its  properties, are absolutely invariable; the individual molecule can  neither grow nor decay, but remains unchanged amid all the changes of  the bodies of which it may form a constituent.    In the second place it is not the only molecule of its kind, for there  are innumerable other molecules, whose constants are not  approximately, but absolutely identical with those of the first  molecule, and this whether they are found on the earth, in the sun, or  in the fixed stars.    By what process of evolution the philosophers of the future will  attempt to account for this identity in the properties of such a  multitude of bodies, each of them unchangeable in magnitude, and some  of them separated from others by distances which Astronomy attempts in  vain to measure, I cannot conjecture.  My mind is limited in its power  of speculation, and I am forced to believe that these molecules must  have been made as they are from the beginning of their existence.    I also conclude that since none of the processes of nature, during  their varied action on different individual molecules, have produced,  in the course of ages, the slightest difference between the properties  of one molecule and those of another, the history of whose  combinations has been different, we cannot ascribe either their  existence or the identity of their properties to the operation of any  of those causes which we call natural.    Is it true then that our scientific speculations have really  penetrated beneath the visible appearance of things, which seem to be  subject to generation and corruption, and reached the entrance of that  world of order and perfection, which continues this day as it was  created, perfect in number and measure and weight?    We may be mistaken.  No one has as yet seen or handled an individual  molecule, and our molecular hypothesis may, in its turn, be supplanted  by some new theory of the constitution of matter; but the idea of the  existence of unnumbered individual things, all alike and all  unchangeable, is one which cannot enter the human mind and remain  without fruit.    But what if these molecules, indestructible as they are, turn out to  be not substances themselves, but mere affections of some other  substance?    According to Sir W. Thomson's theory of Vortex Atoms, the substance of  which the molecule consists is a uniformly dense _plenum_, the  properties of which are those of a perfect fluid, the molecule itself  being nothing but a certain motion impressed on a portion of this  fluid, and this motion is shewn, by a theorem due to Helmholtz, to be  as indestructible as we believe a portion of matter to be.    If a theory of this kind is true, or even if it is conceivable, our  idea of matter may have been introduced into our minds through our  experience of those systems of vortices which we call bodies, but  which are not substances, but motions of a substance; and yet the idea  which we have thus acquired of matter, as a substance possessing  inertia, may be truly applicable to that fluid of which the vortices  are the motion, but of whose existence, apart from the vortical motion  of some of its parts, our experience gives us no evidence whatever.    It has been asserted that metaphysical speculation is a thing of the  past, and that physical science has extirpated it.  The discussion of  the categories of existence, however, does not appear to be in danger  of coming to an end in our time, and the exercise of speculation  continues as fascinating to every fresh mind as it was in the days of  Thales."]]]
