This was  artfully looped up on the right side and tied by a ribbon, in such a way  that when I came out ready dressed to mount, no one in the world could  have guessed that I had on any _cage_ beneath my short riding habit with  a loose tweed jacket over the body of the dress. Within the \"swag\"  was stowed a brush and comb, collar, cuffs and handkerchiefs, a little  necessary linen, a pair of shoes, and perhaps a ribbon for my hair if  I meant to be very smart. On this occasion we all found that our skates  occupied a terribly large proportion both of weight and space in our  modest kits, but still we were much too happy to grumble.    Where could you find a gayer quartette than started at an easy canter  up the valley that fresh bracing morning? From the very first our faces  were turned to the south-west, and before us rose the magnificent chain  of the Southern Alps, with their bold snowy peaks standing out in  a glorious dazzle against the cobalt sky. A stranger, or colonially  speaking, a \"new chum,\" would have thought we must needs cross that  barrier-range before we could penetrate any distance into the back  country, but we knew of long winding vallies and gullies running up  between the giant slopes, which would lead us, almost without our  knowing how high we had climbed, up to the elevated but sheltered  plateau among the back country ranges where Mr. C. H----'s homestead  stood. There was only one steep saddle to be crossed, and that lay  between us and Rockwood, six miles off. It was the worst part of the  journey for the horses, so we had easy consciences in dismounting and  waiting an hour when we reached that most charming and hospitable of  houses. I had just time for one turn round the beautiful garden, where  the flowers and shrubs of old England grew side by side with the wild  and lovely blossoms of our new island home, when the expected coo-e rang  out shrill and clear from the rose-covered porch. It was but little past  mid-day when we made our second start, and set seriously to work over  fifteen miles of fairly good galloping ground. This distance brought  us well up to the foot of a high range, and the last six miles of the  journey had to be accomplished in single file, and with great care and  discretion, for the track led through bleak desolate vallies, round  the shoulder of abutting spurs, through swamps, and up and down rocky  staircases. Mr. C. H---- and his cob both knew the way well however,  and my bay mare Helen had the cleverest legs and the wisest as well  as prettiest head of her race. If left to herself she seldom made a  mistake, and the few tumbles she and I ever had together, took place  only when she found herself obliged to go my way instead of her own. We  entered the gorges of the high mountains between us and the west,  and soon lost the sun; even the brief winter twilight faded away more  swiftly than usual amid those dark defiles; and it was pitch dark,  though only five o'clock, when we heard a sudden and welcome clamour of  dog voices.    These deep-mouthed tones invariably constitute the first notes of a  sheep-station's welcome; and a delightful sound it is to the belated and  bewildered traveller, for besides guiding his horse to the right spot,  the noise serves to bring out some one to see who the traveller may be.  On this occasion we heard one man say to the other, \"It's the boss:\" so  almost before we had time to dismount from our tired horses (remember  they had each carried a heavy \"swag\" besides their riders), lights  gleamed from the windows of the little house, and a wood fire sparkled  and sputtered on the open hearth. Mr. C. H---- only just guided me  to the door of the sitting-room, making an apology and injunction  together,--\"Its very rough I am afraid: but you can do what you  like;\"--before he hastened back to assist his guests in settling their  horses comfortably for the night. Labour used to be so dear and wages so  high, especially in the back country of New Zealand, that the couple of  men,--one for indoor work, to saw wood, milk, cook, sweep, _wash_,  etc., and the other to act as gardener, groom, ploughman, and do all  the numerous odd jobs about a place a hundred miles and more from the  nearest shop,--represented a wage-expenditure of at least 200 pounds a  year. Every gentleman therefore as a matter of course sees to his own  horse when he arrives unexpectedly at a station, and I knew I should  have at least half an hour to myself.    The first thing to do was to let down my crinoline, for I could only  walk like a crab in it when it was fastened up for riding, kilt up my  linsey gown, take off my hat and jacket, and set to work The curtains  must be drawn close, and the chairs moved out from their symmetrical  positions against the wall; then I made an expedition into the kitchen,  and won the heart of the stalwart cook, who was already frying chops  over the fire, by saying in my best German, \"I have come to help you  with the tea.\" Poor man! it was very unfair, for Mr. C. H---- had told  me during our ride that his servitor was a German, and I had employed  the last long hour of the journey in rubbing up my exceedingly  rusty knowledge of that language, and arranging one or two effective  sentences. Poor Karl's surprise and delight knew no bounds, and he burst  forth into a long monologue, to which I could find no readier answers  than smiles and nods, hiding my inability to follow up my brilliant  beginning under the pretence of being very busy. By the time the  gentlemen had stabled and fed the horses and were ready, Karl and I  between us had arranged a bright cosy little apartment with a capital  tea-dinner on the table. After this meal there were pipes and toddy, and  as I could not retire, like Mrs. Micawber at David Copperfield's supper  party, into the adjoining bedroom and sit by myself in the cold, I made  the best of the somewhat dense clouds of smoke with which I was soon  surrounded, and listened to the fragmentary plans for the next day. Then  we all separated for the night, and in two minutes I was fast asleep in  a little room no bigger than the cabin of a ship, with an opossum rug on  a sofa for my bed and bedding.    It was cold enough the next morning, I assure you: so cold that it was  difficult to believe the statement that all the gentlemen had been down  at daybreak to bathe in the great lake which spread like an inland sea  before the bay-window of the little sitting room. This lake, the largest  of the mountain chain, never freezes, on account partly of its great  depth, and also because of its sunny aspect. Our destination lay far  inland, and if we meant to have a good long day's skating we must start  at once. Such a perfect day as it was! I felt half inclined to beg off  the first day on the ice, and to spend my morning wandering along the  rata-fringed shores of Lake Coleridge, with its glorious enclosing  of hills which might fairly be called mountains; but I feared to seem  capricious or lazy, when really my only difficulty was in selecting  a pleasure. The sun had climbed well over the high barriers which lay  eastwards, and was shining brightly down through the quivering blue  ether overhead; the frost sparkled on every broad flax-blade or slender  tussock-spine, as if the silver side of earth were turned outwards that  winter morning.    No sooner had we mounted (with no \"swag\" except our skates this time)  than Mr. C. H---- set spurs to his horse, and bounded over the slip-rail  of the paddock before Karl could get it down. We were too primitive  for gates in those parts: they only belonged to the civilization nearer  Christchurch; and I had much ado to prevent my pony from following his  lead, especially as the other gentlemen were only too delighted to get  rid of some of their high spirits by a jump. However Karl got the  top rail down for me, and \"Mouse\" hopped over the lower one gaily,  overtaking the leader of the expedition in a very few strides. We could  not keep up our rapid pace long; for the ground became terribly broken  and cut up by swamps, quicksands, blind creeks, and all sorts of snares  and pit-falls. Every moment added to the desolate grandeur of the scene.  Bleak hills rose up on either hand, with still bleaker and higher peaks  appearing beyond them again. An awful silence, unbroken by the familiar  cheerful sound of the sheep calling to each other,--for even the hardy  merino cannot live in these ranges during the winter months,--brooded  around us, and the dark mass of a splendid \"bush,\" extending over many  hundred acres, only added to the lonely grandeur of the scene. We rode  almost the whole time in a deep cold shade, for between us and the warm  sun-rays were such lofty mountains that it was only for a few brief  noontide moments he could peep over their steep sides.    After two hour's riding, at the best pace which we could keep up through  these terrible gorges, a sharp turn of the track brought us full in view  of our destination. I can never forget that first glimpse of Lake Ida.  In the cleft of a huge, gaunt, bare hill, divided as if by a giant hand,  lay a large _black_ sheet of ice. No ray of sunshine ever struck it from  autumn until spring, and it seemed impossible to imagine our venturing  to skate merrily in such a sombre looking spot. But New-Zealand sheep  farmers are not sentimental I am afraid. Beyond a rapid thought of  self-congratulation that such \"cold country\" was not on _their_ run,  they did not feel affected by its eternal silence and gloom. The ice  would bear, and what more could skater's heart desire? At the end of the  dark tarn, nearest to the track by which we had approached it, stood a  neat little hut; and judge of my amazement when, as we rode up to it,  a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5994"],[0,"Our Nervous Friends — Illustrating the Mastery of Nervousness (#9)"],[1," her own son the heritage of  wholesome living.    We met father and grandmother as she arrived in New York to arrange  for the treatment, which even his beclouded brain recognized as  urgent; and we leave him with a darkening future, unless Fate snatches  away a great family's millions, or works the miracle of self-  revelation, or the greater miracle of late-life reformation in the son  of this nervously damaged mother.          CHAPTER VI    THE MESS OF POTTAGE      \"I know Clara puts too much butter in her fudge. It always gives me a  splitting headache, but gee, isn't it good! I couldn't help eating it  if I knew it was going to kill me the next day.\" The Pale Girl looks  the truth of her exclamations, as she strolls down the campus-walk  arm-in-arm with the Brown Girl, between lectures the morning after.    Clara Denny had given the \"Solemn Circle\" another of her swell fudge-  feasts in her room the night before, and, as usual, had wrecked sleep,  breakfast, and morning recitations for the elect half-dozen, with the  very richness of her hand-brewed lusciousness. They called Clara the  Buxom Lass, and they called her well. She was, physically, a mature  young woman at sixteen, healthy, vigorous, rose-cheeked, plump, and  not uncomely, frolicsome and care-free, with ten dollars a week, \"just  for fun.\" She was a worthy leader of the Solemn Circle of sophomores  which she had organized, each member of which was sacredly sworn to  meet every Friday night for one superb hour of savory sumptuousness--  in the vernacular, \"swell feeds.\"    Clara was a Floridian. Her father had shrewdly monopolized the  transfer business in the state's metropolis, and from an humble one-  horse start now operated two-score moving-vans and motor-trucks, and  added substantially, each year, to his real-estate holdings. Mr. Denny  let fall an Irish syllable from time to time, regularly took his  little \"nip o' spirits,\" and ate proverbially long and often. Year  after year passed, with the hardy man a literal cheer-leader in the  Denny household, till his gradually hardening arteries began to leak.  Then came the change which brought Clara home from college--home,  first to companion, then to nurse, and finally through ugly years, to  slave for this disintegrating remnant of humanity. Slowly,  reluctantly, this genial, old soul descended the scale of human life.  He was dear and pathetic in the early, unaccustomed awkwardness of his  painless weakness. \"Only a few days, darlin', and we'll have a spin in  the car and your father'll show thim upstarts how to rustle up the  business.\" The rustling days did not come, but short periods of  irritability did. He wanted his \"Clara-girl\" near and became impatient  in her absence. He objected to her mother's nursing, and later became  suspicious that she was conspiring to keep Clara from him, and often  greeted both mother and daughter with unreasonable words. His  interests narrowed pitiably, until they did not extend beyond the  range of his senses, and the senses themselves dulled, even as did his  feelings of fineness. He grew careless in his habits, and required  increasing attention to his beard and clothing. Coarseness first  peeped in, then became a permanent guest--a coarseness which the  wife's presence seemed to inflame, and which could be stilled finally  only by the actual caress of his daughter's lips. And with the slow  melting of brain-tissue went every vestige of decency; vile thoughts  which had never crossed the threshold of John Denny's normal mind  seemed bred without restraint in the caldron of his diseased brain.  His was a vital sturdiness which, for ten years, refused death, but  during the last of these he was physically and morally repellent.  Sentiment, that too-often fear of unkind gossip, or ignorant  falsifying of consequences, stood between this family and the proper  institutional and professional care, which could have given him more  than any family's love, and protected those who had their lives to  live from memories which are mercilessly cruel.    Clara's older brother had much of his father's good cheer and less of  his father's good sense. He, too, had money to use \"just for fun,\" and  Jacksonville was very wide open. So, after his father's misfortune had  eliminated paternal restraint, the boy's \"nips o' spirits\" multiplied  into full half-pints. For twelve years he drank badly, was cursed by  his father, prayed for by his mother, and wept over by Clara. The  wonderful power of a Christian revival saved him. He \"got religion\"  and got it right, and lives a sane, sober life.    The older sister had married while Clara was at school, and lived with  her little family in Charleston. Her \"duty\" was in her home, but this  duty became strikingly emphasized when things \"went wrong\" in  Jacksonville, and she frankly admitted that she was entirely \"too  nervous to be of any use around sickness\"; nor did she ever come to  help, even when Clara's cup of trouble seemed running over. And this  cup was filled with bitterness when, suddenly, the mother had a  \"stroke,\" and the care of two invalids and the presence of her  periodically drunk brother made ruthless demands on her twenty years.  The mother had been a sensible woman, for her advantages, and most  efficient, and under her teaching Clara had become exceptionally  capable. The two invalids now lay in adjoining rooms. \"Either one may  go at any time,\" the doctor said, and when alone in the house with  them the daughter was haunted with a morbid dread which frequently  caused her to hesitate before opening the door, with the fear that she  might find a parent gone. As it happened, she was away, taking  treatment, unable to return home, when grippe and pneumonia took the  mother, and the candle of the father's life finally flickered out.    Clara had handled the home situation with intermittent efficiency.  When she entered her father's sick-room, called suddenly from the  thoughtless hilarities of the Solemn Circle and fudge-feasts, and saw  him so altered, and, for him, so dangerously frail, in his invalid  chair, something went wrong with her breathing; the air could not get  into her lungs; there was a smothering in her throat and she toppled  over on the bed. It seemed to take smelling-salts and brandy to bring  her back. She said afterwards that she was not unconscious, that she  knew all that was happening, but felt a stifling sense of suffocation.  Later after one of her father's first unnatural outbreaks, she  suffered a series of chills and her mother thought, of course, it was  malaria; but many big doses of quinin did not break it up, and no  matter when the doctor came, his little thermometer revealed no fever.  She spent three months at Old Point Comfort and the chills were never  so bad again. Other distressing internal symptoms appeared closely  following the shock of her mother's sudden paralysis. An operation and  a month in a northern hospital were followed by comparative relief.  But her nervous symptoms finally became acute and she was spending the  spring and early summer on rest-cure in a sanitarium when her parents  died. The Jacksonville home was then closed.    Soon after, Clara was profoundly impressed at the same revival in  which her brother was converted. While she could not leave her church  to join this less formal denomination, she entered into Home  Missionary activities with much zest. At this time a friendship was  formed with a woman-physician who, as months of association passed,  attained a reasonably clear insight into her life and encouraged her  to enter a well-equipped, church training-school for deaconesses. The  spell of the religious influences of the past year's revival was still  strong; this, and the stimulation of new resolves, carried her along  well for six months. In her studies and practical work she showed  ability, efficiency and flashes of common sense. Then she became  enamored of a younger woman, a class-mate--her heart was empty and  hungry for the love which means so much to woman's life. Unhappily,  she overheard her unfaithful loved one comment to a confidante: \"It  makes me sick to be kissed by Clara Denny.\" Another damaging shock,  followed by another series of bad attacks--the old spells, chills and  internal revolutions had returned. She rapidly became useless and a  burden. The school-doctor sent her a thousand miles to another  specialist.    We first met Clara Denny effervescent, winning, almost charming--a  sixteen-year-old minx. Let us scrutinize her at thirty-six. What a  deformation! She weighs one hundred and seventy-three--she is only  five-feet-four; her face is heavy, soggy, vapid; her eyes, abnormally  small; her complexion is sallow, almost muddy; her chin, trembling and  double; strongly penciled, black eye-brows are the only remnant  apparent of the \"Buxom Lass\" of twenty years ago. Her hands are pudgy;  her figure soft, mushy, sloppy; her presence is unwholesome. The  specialist found her internally as she appeared externally. While not  organically diseased, the vital organs were functionally inert. Every  physical and chemical evidence pointed to the accumulation in a  naturally robust body of the twin toxins--food poison and under  oxidation. She was haunted by a fear of paralysis. She confused  feelings with ideas and was certain her mind was going. The spells  which had first started beside her invalid father were now of daily  occurrence. She, nor any one else knew when she would topple over. She  found another reason for her belief that her brain was affected in her  increasingly frequent headaches. For years she had been unable to read  or study without her glasses, because of the pain at the base of her  brain. When these wonderful glasses were tested, they were found to  represent one of the mildest corrections made by opticians; in fact,  her eyes were above the average. Her precious glasses were practically"]]]
