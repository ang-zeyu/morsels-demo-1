He had, as usual,  surrounded himself with a set of hungry dependants, several of whom  determined to accompany him. He had not heart to refuse them, and he  arrived at Vienna with five of them. Bernard sent a polite invitation  to the confessor, and gave him a sumptuous entertainment, at which  were present nearly all the alchymists of Vienna. Master Henry frankly  confessed that he had not discovered the philosopher's stone, but that  he had all his life been employed in searching for it, and would so  continue, till he found it;--or died. This was a man after Bernard's  own heart, and they vowed with each other an eternal friendship. It was  resolved, at supper, that each alchymist present should contribute a  certain sum towards raising forty-two marks of gold, which, in five  days, it was confidently asserted by Master Henry, would increase, in  his furnace, five fold. Bernard, being the richest man, contributed the  lion's share, ten marks of gold, Master Henry five, and the others one  or two a piece, except the dependants of Bernard, who were obliged to  borrow their quota from their patron. The grand experiment was duly  made; the golden marks were put into a crucible, with a quantity of  salt, copperas, aquafortis, egg-shells, mercury, lead, and dung. The  alchymists watched this precious mess with intense interest, expecting  that it would agglomerate into one lump of pure gold. At the end of  three weeks they gave up the trial, upon some excuse that the crucible  was not strong enough, or that some necessary ingredient was wanting.  Whether any thief had put his hands into the crucible is not known, but  it is certain that the gold found therein at the close of the experiment  was worth only sixteen marks, instead of the forty-two, which were put  there at the beginning.    Bernard, though he made no gold at Vienna, made away with a very  considerable quantity. He felt the loss so acutely, that he vowed to  think no more of the philosopher's stone. This wise resolution he kept  for two months; but he was miserable. He was in the condition of the  gambler, who cannot resist the fascination of the game while he has a  coin remaining, but plays on with the hope of retrieving former losses,  till hope forsakes him, and he can live no longer. He returned once  more to his beloved crucibles, and resolved to prosecute his journey  in search of a philosopher who had discovered the secret, and would  communicate it to so zealous and persevering an adept as himself. From  Vienna he travelled to Rome, and from Rome to Madrid. Taking ship at  Gibraltar, he proceeded to Messina; from Messina to Cyprus; from  Cyprus to Greece; from Greece to Constantinople; and thence into Egypt,  Palestine, and Persia. These wanderings occupied him about eight years.  From Persia he made his way back to Messina, and from thence into  France. He afterwards passed over into England, still in search of his  great chimera; and this occupied four years more of his life. He was now  growing both old and poor; for he was sixty-two years of age, and had  been obliged to sell a great portion of his patrimony to provide for his  expenses. His journey to Persia had cost upwards of thirteen thousand  crowns, about one-half of which had been fairly melted in his  all-devouring furnaces: the other half was lavished upon the sycophants  that he made it his business to search out in every town he stopped at.    On his return to Treves he found, to his sorrow, that, if not an actual  beggar, he was not much better. His relatives looked upon him as a  madman, and refused even to see him. Too proud to ask for favours from  any one, and still confident that, some day or other, he would be the  possessor of unbounded wealth, he made up his mind to retire to the  island of Rhodes, where he might, in the mean time, hide his poverty  from the eyes of all the world. Here he might have lived unknown and  happy; but, as ill luck would have it, he fell in with a monk as mad as  himself upon the subject of transmutation. They were, however, both  so poor that they could not afford to buy the proper materials to work  with. They kept up each other's spirits by learned discourses on the  Hermetic Philosophy, and in the reading of all the great authors who had  written upon the subject. Thus did they nurse their folly, as the good  wife of Tam O'Shanter did her wrath, \"to keep it warm.\" After Bernard  had resided about a year in Rhodes, a merchant, who knew his family,  advanced him the sum of eight thousand florins, upon the security of the  last-remaining acres of his formerly large estate. Once more provided  with funds, he recommenced his labours with all the zeal and enthusiasm  of a young man. For three years he hardly stepped out of his laboratory:  he ate there, and slept there, and did not even give himself time to  wash his hands and clean his beard, so intense was his application. It  is melancholy to think that such wonderful perseverance should have been  wasted in so vain a pursuit, and that energies so unconquerable should  have had no worthier field to strive in. Even when he had fumed away his  last coin, and had nothing left in prospective to keep his old age  from starvation, hope never forsook him. He still dreamed of ultimate  success, and sat down a greyheaded man of eighty, to read over all the  authors on the hermetic mysteries, from Geber to his own day, lest he  should have misunderstood some process, which it was not yet too late  to recommence. The alchymists say, that he succeeded at last, and  discovered the secret of transmutation in his eighty-second year. They  add, that he lived three years afterwards to enjoy his wealth. He lived,  it is true, to this great age, and made a valuable discovery--more  valuable than gold or gems. He learned, as he himself informs us, just  before he had attained his eighty-third year, that the great secret of  philosophy was contentment with our lot. Happy would it have been for  him if he had discovered it sooner, and before he became decrepit, a  beggar, and an exile!    He died at Rhodes, in the year 1490, and all the alchymists of Europe  sang elegies over him, and sounded his praise as the \"good Trevisan.\"  He wrote several treatises upon his chimera, the chief of which are,  the \"Book of Chemistry,\" the \"Verbum dimissum,\" and an essay \"De Natura  Ovi.\"      TRITHEMIUS.    The name of this eminent man has become famous in the annals of alchymy,  although he did but little to gain so questionable an honour. He was  born in the year 1462, at the village of Trittheim, in the electorate  of Treves. His father was John Heidenberg, a vine-grower, in easy  circumstances, who, dying when his son was but seven years old, left  him to the care of his mother. The latter married again very shortly  afterwards, and neglected the poor boy, the offspring of her first  marriage. At the age of fifteen he did not even know his letters,  and was, besides, half starved, and otherwise ill-treated by his  step-father; but the love of knowledge germinated in the breast of the  unfortunate youth, and he learned to read at the house of a neighbour.  His father-in-law set him to work in the vineyards, and thus occupied  all his days; but the nights were his own. He often stole out unheeded,  when all the household were fast asleep, poring over his studies in the  fields, by the light of the moon; and thus taught himself Latin and the  rudiments of Greek. He was subjected to so much ill-usage at home,  in consequence of this love of study, that he determined to leave it.  Demanding the patrimony which his father had left him, he proceeded to  Treves; and, assuming the name of Trithemius, from that of his native  village of Trittheim, lived there for some months, under the tuition of  eminent masters, by whom he was prepared for the university. At the  age of twenty, he took it into his head that he should like to see his  mother once more; and he set out on foot from the distant university for  that purpose. On his arrival near Spannheim, late in the evening of a  gloomy winter's day, it came on to snow so thickly, that he could not  proceed onwards to the town. He, therefore, took refuge for the night  in a neighbouring monastery; but the storm continued several days, the  roads became impassable, and the hospitable monks would not hear of his  departure. He was so pleased with them and their manner of life, that he  suddenly resolved to fix his abode among them, and renounce the world.  They were no less pleased with him, and gladly received him as a  brother. In the course of two years, although still so young, he  was unanimously elected their Abbot. The financial affairs of the  establishment had been greatly neglected, the walls of the building were  falling into ruin, and everything was in disorder. Trithemius, by his  good management and regularity, introduced a reform in every branch of  expenditure. The monastery was repaired, and a yearly surplus, instead  of a deficiency, rewarded him for his pains. He did not like to see the  monks idle, or occupied solely between prayers for their business, and  chess for their relaxation. He, therefore, set them to work to copy the  writings of eminent authors. They laboured so assiduously, that, in the  course of a few years, their library, which had contained only about  forty volumes, was enriched with several hundred valuable manuscripts,  comprising many of the classical Latin authors, besides the works of  the early fathers, and the principal historians and philosophers of  more modern date. He retained the dignity of Abbot of Spannheim for  twenty-one years, when the monks, tired of the severe discipline he  maintained, revolted against him, and chose another abbot in his place.

The Egyptian version of the Gospel story, being more appropriate to the  Nile Valley than to the region from whence they came, the Greek  colonists of Alexandria adopted it, but preferring to pay homage to  Serapis, one of the ninth incarnations of God Sol, which they imported  from Pontus, a Greek province of Asia Minor, they erected to his  worship that celebrated temple known as the Grand Serapium; and,  transferring the culture and refinement of Greece to the new city, it  became, under the Ptolemian dynasty, a great seat of learning; the arts  and sciences flourished, an immense library was collected, the various  forms of Astral worship were represented and schools for the  dissemination of the several phases of Grecian philosophy and Oriental  Gnosticism were founded.    Such being the environment of the Jewish residents of Alexandria, they  soon acquired the vernacular and adopted the religion of the Greeks,  who, having ever attached to their incarnate saviours the title  signifying the Christ, or the anointed, were known as Christians.  Encouraged by the liberal policy of Philadelphus, the second Ptolemy, a  body of their learned men, who had been educated in the Greek schools,  founded a college for the education of their own people, which  institution was ultimately known as the University of Alexandria. Under  the auspices of Philadelphus the professors of that institution  rendered their Hebrew sacred records into the Greek language, which  translation is known as the Septuagint, or Alexandrian version of the  Old Testament.    Having acquired from the Egyptian astrologers the arts of healing,  thaumaturgy and necromancy, and teaching them in their school, the  professors of the Jewish college of Alexandria assumed the title of  Essenes, or Therapeutae, the Egyptian and Greek words signifying  Doctors, Healers or Wonder Workers. Possessed of the sad and gloomy  characteristics of their race, they adopted the \"Contemplative Life,\"  or asceticism of the Oriental Gnosticism, from which they derived the  name of Ascetics. Founding a church for the propagation of their  peculiar tenets, those who were set apart for the ministry assumed the  title of Ecclesiastics. Inculcating rigid temperance and self-denial  among their people, they were known as Enchratites, Nazarites or  Abstainers; and the more devout among them retiring to monasteries, or  to the solitude of caves and other secluded places, were also  designated as Monks, Cenobites, Friars, Eremites, Hermits or  Solitaries.    The time having arrived, according to the cyclic teachings of Astral  worship, for the manifestation of the tenth and last incarnation of God  Sol, or, in other words, to, give a new name to the mythical genius of  the sun, the professors of the Jewish school of Alexandria is resolved  to inaugurate their own form of worship. While retaining the same title  under which they had paid homage to Serapis and known as Christians,  Essenes or Therapeutae, they substituted for their Christ the name of  the Grecian Bacchus, which, composed of the letters {Greek:  IOTA, ETA, SIGMA}, signifies Yes, Ies or Jes. In composing their version  of the Gospel story, having, like their race, no inventive genius, they  appropriated that of Serapis as its basis and laid its scene in the  land of their ancestry, but inconsistently retained the sign of the  cross and the phraseology connected there with, which, having special  reference to the Nile River and its annual inundation, had no  application whatever to the sterile land of Judea. Selecting what they  conceived to be the best from other versions of the Gospel story, and  assuming the title of Eclectics, they designated their system as the  Eclectic Philosophy. In proof of the eclectic character of the Gospel  and Epistles of ancient Christianity, we refer to the Asceticism  inculcated therein, which, derived from the Oriental Gnosticism, we  find perpetuated in the scriptures of modern Christianity; we also  refer to the miracle of converting water into wine, taken from the  Gospel story of Bacchus, and to the statements that the Saviour was the  son of a carpenter and was hung between two thieves, copied from the  story of Christna, the Eighth, Avatar of the East Indian astrolatry.  Thus we see that, although the scene of the Gospel story of ancient  Christianity was laid in the land of Judea, its authors having adopted  a Greek version of that story as its basis, given a Greek title and  name to their Messiah, perpetuated a Greek name for their sect and  quoted exclusively from the Septuagint, or Greek version of the Old  Testament, the facts show conclusively that it was not Jews of Judea,  but Hellenized Jews of Alexandria, who were the real authors of the  ancient Christianity.        THE PROPHECIES.    The clergy having ever claimed that the prophecies are Divine  revelations of events yet to occur, and having incessantly agitated  society by preaching their speedy fulfillment, we propose to expose the  fallacy of their teachings by showing that these scriptures are not the  records of future events, Divinely reavealed, but that they originated  with the founders of Astral worship, who predicated them upon  predetermined events of their own concoction, relative to the general  judgment, and setting up of the kingdom of heaven, which were to occur  as the finale of the plan of redemption and from which were derived the  doctrines of second adventism; and, in determining the exact time when  then were to occur, we have but to prove that it was coincident with  the conclusion of the last half of the grand cycle of 12,000 years,  which, as we have shown, was dedicated to man as the duration of his  race on earth.    As evidence that the founders of the Jewish or ancient Christianity  believed, like the votaries of other forms of Astral worship, that the  prophecies were soon to be fulfilled, we find that the New Testament,  of the original version of which they were the authors, is replete with  such texts as \"Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand,\" Matt. iv.  17; \"There be some standing here which shall not taste death till they  see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom,\" Matt. xxi. 28; \"The time is  fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand,\" Mark i. 15. That the  original version of the New Testament was composed when the Vernal  Equinox was in the sign of Aries we are assured by reason of the fact  that it inculcates homage to the Lord under the symbol of the Lamb; and  that it was during the last, or 30th degree of that sign, can readily  be proven by appealing to history and to astronomy, the former of which  teaches that the Jews were removed from Judea to Alexandria twenty-five  years before the accession to the throne of Philadelphus, the Second  Ptolemy, to whom we have referred in our preceding article, and who,  after reigning thirty-nine years, died 246 years before the beginning  of our era. By reference to the Celestial atlas we will find that the  Vernal Equinox will pass out of the sign of Pisces into that of  Aquarius, or in the year 1900, and we have but to deduct that period of  time from 2150, the number of years required for the cardinal points to  pass through one whole sign, to determine that the Spring Equinox  passed out of the sign of Aries into that of Pisces 250 years before  the beginning of our era, or about 2,100 years ago. Now, from the  projections of the astrological science, we are assured that the last  half of the grand cycle of 12,000 years, which was allotted to man as  the duration of his race on earth, was made to begin at a time  corresponding to the Autumnal Equinox, when that cardinal point was  passing out of the sign of Virgo, and that of necessity it had to come  to an end at a time corresponding to the Vernal Equinox, when that  cardinal point was passing out of the sign of Aries; from which we know  why, at the last judgment, the office of trumpeter was assigned to the  Archangel Gabriel, the genius of Spring, and why it was a ram's horn  with which he was to \"toot the crack o' doom.\"    When the time arrived for the fulfillment of the prophecies we can well  imagine that, fearing the wrath of the Lamb, there were weeping,  wailing and gnashing of teeth among the terror-stricken sinners, while  those who believed they had made their calling and election sure were  looking with feverish expectancy for the second advent of their Lord  and Saviour; and, doubtless, clothed with their ascension robes, they  watched and waited, with ears alert, to hear the sound of Gabriel's  trumpet, summoning the quick, and the dead to the general judgment. But  not a blast from the archangel's ram's horn was heard reverberating  along the skies, no Lord appeared descending upon the clouds to meet  the elect in the air, and, in the last act of the fearful drama of  \"judgment day,\" the curtain refused to be rung down upon a burning  world.    With the non-fulfillment of the prophecies, the more enlightened  elements of society began to scoff at the priests, who were temporarily  demoralized, but true to their deceptive instincts, soon rallying with  the plea of a mistake having been made in the calculations based upon  the prophecies, they undoubtedly concocted scripture to meet that very  emergency, for, to the taunts of the scoffers who, in reference to the  second advent of the Lord, enquired \"Where is "]]]
