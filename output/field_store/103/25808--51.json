Important too during this period was the Army's development of tank cars  for transporting helium. A large item of helium expense was freight, the  cost of hauling 130 pound metal containers which held 170 to 200 cu. ft.  of the gas. It took 250 such containers to inflate Goodyear's smallest  ship, the Pilgrim. The tank cars hold 200,000 cu. ft. of gas, almost  enough to inflate two Goodyear airships.    Experiments with specially woven fabric and the use of synthetic rubber  cut down the losses resulting from diffusion, and where formerly it was  necessary to remove the helium and purify it every six months, diffusion  losses were cut to one or two per cent a month, with purification needed  only every other year.    In addition to increasing safety, helium permitted improvements in  airship design. The wartime craft had its control cars suspended by  cables from finger patches cemented to the outside of the bag. But with  helium ships the car could be built into the bag, attached by an  internal catenary suspension system to the top of the gas section. Each  exposed suspension cable, no matter how small, creates parasitic  resistance from the air, so that the removal of yards of steel and rope  had the result of increasing the speed of the ship with the same  horsepower.    The second set of major improvements centers around the mooring mast.  The mooring mast idea was not new. The British had built the first ones  during the World War for its large rigid ships, found that a ship  attached to it would swing easily, like a weather vane, continuing to  point into the wind, and that a well streamlined ship would hold  securely even in winds of great velocity.    When Alfred E. Smith ordered a mooring mast built on top the Empire  State building, it was with the assurance from his engineers that even  with the tugging of the 150-ton Graf Zeppelin, the strain would be  little more than the normal push of the wind against the building  itself, that the added stresses would be negligible.    The Germans had had little occasion to use mooring masts.  Friedrichshafen, where most of the Zeppelins were built, lay in a  natural bowl, well protected from the winds, and ships could take off  and land, be walked in or out of the hangar with little risk from the  weather.    Lakehurst, on the other hand, lay in an exposed position, in the path of  coast-wise storms, a frequent battle-ground between onshore winds from  the ocean and storms breaking over the mountains from the west. A study  made later to determine bases for projected American passenger  operations showed that of weather conditions prevailing between Boston  and the Virginia Cape, those at Lakehurst were almost the most  unfavorable.        [Illustration: Four stages in the evolution of the mooring mast. At      the outset large ground crews held the ship on the ground.]        [Illustration: Then a stub mast was placed atop a truck, to hold the      ship on the ground, maneuver it in or out of the dock.]        [Illustration: A high mast, made in sections, can be erected      anywhere, anchored by guy wires, holds the airship securely against      winds of gale force.]        [Illustration: The little brother of the \"Iron Horse\", which will      receive the largest of the new Navy blimps, maneuver them on the      field.]    People knew little about airship operating when the Navy base was moved  from Pensacola to Lakehurst on a waste site in the Jersey pine lands  which the Army no longer needed after the war as a proving ground for  its artillery.    This defect proved an advantage. The Navy was forced by the very nature  of things to concentrate on a problem which had been no problem to  Doctor Eckener and his associates. At the urging of Admiral Moffett,  Commander Garland Fulton, Lieutenant Commander C. E. Rosendahl and  others, Navy engineers built a high mast, 180 feet tall, following  British practice, with a service elevator inside, then tackled the  problem of keeping the ship on even keel against up and down gusts.  Since the wind does not come out of the ground, a low mast was  suggested, half the height of the ship, so that when anchored the ship  would all but rest on the ground. The Navy was working on this when an  incident happened to strengthen the argument.    The co-incidence of a wind shift, and rising temperatures one afternoon  as the Los Angeles was resting comfortably at anchorage, started the  tail rising, and it continued to rise till it reached almost 90 degrees.  Then the ship turned gently on its swivel, and descended easily on the  other side, with no more damage than some broken china in the galley.  Still a 700-foot airship has no business doing head-stands, so the low  mast development was rushed through. It proved successful.    The next step was to make the low mast mobile, so that it could not only  hold the ship on the ground but take it in and out of the hangar. First  of these was Lakehurst's famous \"iron horse,\" a giant motor-driven  tripod, which rolled out on the airport, hauling incoming ships into the  hangar, took advantage of daylight calms to take ships out into the  field ahead of time so as to be ready to leave on schedule.    On the Graf Zeppelin's trip around the world in 1929, hangars were  available for fueling stops at Lakehurst, Friedrichshafen, and curiously  enough in Japan, a German shed turned over to the Nipponese after the  1918 Armistice, having been re-erected at Tokio. There was none however  on the American West Coast to house the ship after its long trip across  the Pacific. So the Navy, under direction of Lieutenant Commander T. G.  W. Settle, hauled a mast up to Los Angeles from San Diego (it had been  erected there for the Shenandoah's flight around the rim of the country  in 1923) anchored it with guy wires. It served the purpose perfectly.    The Germans, skeptical at first, became convinced of the value of the  mast, themselves erected masts at Frankfort, and Seville, at Pernambuco  and Rio de Janiero, used them as terminals.    Once the masting technique had been worked out, the Graf Zeppelin and  the Hindenburg, in the years 1930-6, made a record of regularity which  no other vehicle of transportation has approached. They took off at  times over the ocean for Europe when all other aircraft in the area was  grounded, when the fog hid the entire top half of the ship, and the ship  disappeared into the fog within a few seconds after the \"Up Ship\" signal  was given. What few delays appear on the record were due to waiting for  connecting airplanes to arrive with the latest European mail for the  Americas.    So far the use of masts had been entirely a matter for the large rigid  airships. The Army did the first development work on high and low masts  for its smaller ships at Scott Field, as well as a landing wheel for  them to ride on. A situation at Akron started experimentation along a  different line. At Goodyear's Wingfoot Lake Field, Mr. Litchfield  frowned over the expense of having a considerable crew on hand to land  and launch the blimps, with little to do after the ship was in the air.  To an Army or Navy post, with plenty of men in training, this surplus of  men was no difficulty, but any private corporation operating passenger  airship lines would find the expense burdensome.        [Illustration: The Navy L-2, one of the first ships under the      expanded program, lands at Wingfoot Lake, Akron, is walked to the      mooring mast.]        [Illustration: Close-up view of engine and cowling, and swiveled      landing wheel.]        [Illustration: With a drogue or sea anchor to hold the airship      steady, supplies or personnel may be taken aboard at sea. (U. S.

Out of many ideas, one clear-cut line of progress  appeared. This was to make the ground crew truck a maneuvering base,  with a mast on top, which could be folded down when not in use. The  truck then could not only hold the ship on the ground, but guide it in  and out of the hangar with more security than by using a large number of  men. Extra wheels mounted on outriggers kept the truck from being turned  over by side gusts. In succeeding years the ground crew truck became a  traveling mooring point which could follow the ship across country, give  it anchorage when night fell, and at the same time act as a traveling  supply depot, machine shop, radio cabin, and crew quarters.    A portable mast, built in sections, high enough for ships to mast at the  nose, was the next step. It could be set up on an hour's notice,  anchored by guy wires and screw stakes for more extended operations.  Gradually the airship became independent of the hangar, came to use it  only for overhaul and the purification of its helium gas. The blimp  could be fueled and serviced completely in the open.    Lacking a dock in San Francisco, at the time of the Exposition in 1939,  the Goodyear blimp Volunteer moved up from Los Angeles, based on a mast  for five months. The only time it sought shelter was when a splinter  from the propeller pierced the bag, causing a leak. The ship flew 60  miles down the bay to the Navy base at Sunnyvale, like a boy coming in  from play to have a splinter removed from his finger, went back again,  didn't even stay over night.    In the winter of 1940-41 the \"Reliance\" which had been spending its  winters in Miami, using a wartime Navy hangar which the city had moved  up from Key West, found that building commandeered for defense work. So  a mast was set up on the Causeway, and the ship operated with no other  home than that for six months, saw no shelter from the time it left  Wingfoot Lake in early December till it returned "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5157"],[0,"How I Found Livingstone (#9)"],[1,"get their  quota. \"If you,\" continued he, \"desire to depart quickly, you must pay  from 25 to 40 doti, and I can send you off before one month is ended.\"  In reply, I said, \"Here are my cloths for pagazis to the amount of  $1,750, or 3,500 doti, sufficient to give one hundred and forty men 25  doti each. The most I am willing to pay is 25 doti: send one hundred and  forty pagazis to Unyanyembe with my cloth and wire, and I will make  your heart glad with the richest present you have ever received.\" With a  refreshing naivete, the \"young man\" said he did not want any present,  he would get me my quota of pagazis, and then I could tell the \"Wasungu\"  what a good \"young man\" he was, and consequently the benefit he would  receive would be an increase of business. He closed his reply with the  astounding remark that he had ten pagazis at his house already, and if I  would be good enough to have four bales of cloth, two bags of beads,  and twenty coils of wire carried to his house, the pagazis could leave  Bagamoyo the next day, under charge of three soldiers.    \"For,\" he remarked, \"it is much better and cheaper to send many small  caravans than one large one. Large caravans invite attack, or are  delayed by avaricious chiefs upon the most trivial pretexts, while small  ones pass by without notice.\"    The bales and the beads were duly carried to Soor Hadji Palloo's house,  and the day passed with me in mentally congratulating myself upon my  good fortune, in complimenting the young Hindi's talents for business,  the greatness and influence of Tarya Topan, and the goodness of Mr.  Webb in thus hastening my departure from Bagamoyo. I mentally vowed a  handsome present, and a great puff in my book, to Soor Hadji Palloo, and  it was with a glad heart that I prepared these soldiers for their march  to Unyayembe.    The task of preparing the first caravan for the Unyanyembe road informed  me upon several things that have escaped the notice of my predecessors  in East Africa, a timely knowledge of which would have been of infinite  service to me at Zanzibar, in the purchase and selection of sufficient  and proper cloth.    The setting out of the first caravan enlightened me also on the subject  of honga, or tribute. Tribute had to be packed by itself, all of  choice cloth; for the chiefs, besides being avaricious, are also very  fastidious. They will not accept the flimsy cloth of the pagazi, but  a royal and exceedingly high-priced dabwani, Ismahili, Rehani, or a  Sohari, or dotis of crimson broad cloth. The tribute for the first  caravan cost $25. Having more than one hundred and forty pagazis to  despatch, this tribute money would finally amount to $330 in gold, with  a minimum of 25c. on each dollar. Ponder on this, O traveller! I lay  bare these facts for your special instruction.    But before my first caravan was destined to part company with me,  Soor Hadji Palloo--worthy young man--and I were to come to a definite  understanding about money matters. The morning appointed for departure  Soor Hadji Palloo came to my hut and presented his bill, with all the  gravity of innocence, for supplying the pagazis with twenty-five doti  each as their hire to Unyanyembe, begging immediate payment in money.  Words fail to express the astonishment I naturally felt, that this  sharp-looking young man should so soon have forgotten the verbal  contract entered into between him and myself the morning previous, which  was to the effect that out of the three thousand doti stored in my tent,  and bought expressly for pagazi hire, each and every man hired for me  as carriers from Bagamoyo to Unyanyembe, should be paid out of the store  there in my tent, when I asked if he remembered the contract, he replied  in the affirmative: his reasons for breaking it so soon were, that he  wished to sell his cloths, not mine, and for his cloths he should want  money, not an exchange. But I gave him to comprehend that as he was  procuring pagazis for me, he was to pay my pagazis with my cloths; that  all the money I expected to pay him, should be just such a sum I thought  adequate for his trouble as my agent, and that only on those terms  should he act for me in this or any other matter, and that the \"Musungu\"  was not accustomed to eat his words.    The preceding paragraph embodies many more words than are contained  in it. It embodies a dialogue of an hour, an angry altercation of  half-an-hour's duration, a vow taken on the part of Soor Hadji Palloo,  that if I did not take his cloths he should not touch my business, many  tears, entreaties, woeful penitence, and much else, all of which were  responded to with, \"Do as I want you to do, or do nothing.\" Finally came  relief, and a happy ending. Soor Hadji Palloo went away with a bright  face, taking with him the three soldiers' posho (food), and honga  (tribute) for the caravan. Well for me that it ended so, and that  subsequent quarrels of a similar nature terminated so peaceably,  otherwise I doubt whether my departure from Bagamoyo would have happened  so early as it did. While I am on this theme, and as it really engrossed  every moment of my time at Bagamoyo, I may as well be more explicit  regarding Boor Hadji Palloo and his connection with my business.    Boor Hadji Palloo was a smart young man of business, energetic, quick at  mental calculation, and seemed to be born for a successful salesman. His  eyes were never idle; they wandered over every part of my person, over  the tent, the bed, the guns, the clothes, and having swung clear round,  began the silent circle over again. His fingers were never at rest, they  had a fidgety, nervous action at their tips, constantly in the act of  feeling something; while in the act of talking to me, he would lean over  and feel the texture of the cloth of my trousers, my coat, or my shoes  or socks: then he would feel his own light jamdani shirt or dabwain  loin-cloth, until his eyes casually resting upon a novelty, his body  would lean forward, and his arm was stretched out with the willing  fingers. His jaws also were in perpetual motion, caused by vile habits  he had acquired of chewing betel-nut and lime, and sometimes tobacco and  lime. They gave out a sound similar to that of a young shoat, in the  act of sucking. He was a pious Mohammedan, and observed the external  courtesies and ceremonies of the true believers. He would affably greet  me, take off his shoes, enter my tent protesting he was not fit to sit  in my presence, and after being seated, would begin his ever-crooked  errand. Of honesty, literal and practical honesty, this youth knew  nothing; to the pure truth he was an utter stranger; the falsehoods he  had uttered during his short life seemed already to have quenched the  bold gaze of innocence from his eyes, to have banished the colour of  truthfulness from his features, to have transformed him--yet a stripling  of twenty--into a most accomplished rascal, and consummate expert in  dishonesty.    During the six weeks I encamped at Bagamoyo, waiting for my quota of  men, this lad of twenty gave me very much trouble. He was found out half  a dozen times a day in dishonesty, yet was in no way abashed by it. He  would send in his account of the cloths supplied to the pagazis, stating  them to be 25 paid to each; on sending a man to inquire I would find the  greatest number to have been 20, and the smallest 12. Soor Hadji Palloo  described the cloths to be of first-class quality, Ulyah cloths, worth  in the market four times more than the ordinary quality given to the  pagazis, yet a personal examination would prove them to be the flimsiest  goods sold, such as American sheeting 2 1/2 feet broad, and worth $2.75  per 30 yards a piece at Zanzibar, or the most inferior Kaniki, which is  generally sold at $9 per score. He would personally come to my camp  and demand 40 lbs. of Sami-Sami, Merikani, and Bubu beads for posho,  or caravan rations; an inspection of their store before departure from  their first camp from Bagamoyo would show a deficiency ranging from 5  to 30 lbs. Moreover, he cheated in cash-money, such as demanding $4 for  crossing the Kingani Ferry for every ten pagazis, when the fare was $2  for the same number; and an unconscionable number of pice (copper coins  equal in value to 3/4 of a cent) were required for posho. It was every  day for four weeks that this system of roguery was carried out. Each day  conceived a dozen new schemes; every instant of his time he seemed to  be devising how to plunder, until I was fairly at my wits' end how to  thwart him. Exposure before a crowd of his fellows brought no blush of  shame to his sallow cheeks; he would listen with a mere shrug of the  shoulders and that was all, which I might interpret any way it pleased  me. A threat to reduce his present had no effect; a bird in the hand was  certainly worth two in the bush for him, so ten dollars' worth of goods  stolen and in his actual possession was of more intrinsic value than the  promise of $20 in a few days, though it was that of a white man.    Readers will of course ask themselves why I did not, after the first  discovery of these shameless proceedings, close my business with him,  to which I make reply, that I could not do without him unless his equal  were forthcoming, that I never felt so thoroughly dependent on any one  man as I did upon him; without his or his duplicate's aid, I must have  stayed at Bagamoyo at least six months, at the end of which time the  Expedition would have become valueless, the rumour of it having been  blown abroad to the four winds. It was immediate departure that was  essential to my success--departure from Bagamoyo--after which it might  be possible for me to control my own future in a great measure.    These troubles were the greatest that I could at this time imagine.  I have already stated that I had $1,750 worth of pagazis' clothes,  or 3,500 doti, stored in my tent, and above what my"]]]
