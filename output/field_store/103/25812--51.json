When morning came Claus found himself thousands of miles from any human  being, a prisoner in the wild jungle of an unknown land.    From the limb of a tree above his head swayed a huge python, one of  those reptiles that are able to crush a man's bones in their coils.  A  few yards away crouched a savage panther, its glaring red eyes fixed  full on the helpless Claus.  One of those monstrous spotted spiders  whose sting is death crept stealthily toward him over the matted  leaves, which shriveled and turned black at its very touch.    But Claus had been reared in Burzee, and was not afraid.    \"Come to me, ye Knooks of the Forest!\" he cried, and gave the low,  peculiar whistle that the Knooks know.    The panther, which was about to spring upon its victim, turned and  slunk away.  The python swung itself into the tree and disappeared  among the leaves.  The spider stopped short in its advance and hid  beneath a rotting log.    Claus had no time to notice them, for he was surrounded by a band of  harsh-featured Knooks, more crooked and deformed in appearance than any  he had ever seen.    \"Who are you that call on us?\" demanded one, in a gruff voice.    \"The friend of your brothers in Burzee,\" answered Claus.  \"I have been  brought here by my enemies, the Awgwas, and left to perish miserably.  Yet now I implore your help to release me and to send me home again.\"    \"Have you the sign?\" asked another.    \"Yes,\" said Claus.    They cut his bonds, and with his free arms he made the secret sign of  the Knooks.    Instantly they assisted him to stand upon his feet, and they brought  him food and drink to strengthen him.    \"Our brothers of Burzee make queer friends,\" grumbled an ancient Knook  whose flowing beard was pure white.  \"But he who knows our secret sign  and signal is entitled to our help, whoever he may be.  Close your  eyes, stranger, and we will conduct you to your home.  Where shall we  seek it?\"    \"'Tis in the Laughing Valley,\" answered Claus, shutting his eyes.    \"There is but one Laughing Valley in the known world, so we can not go  astray,\" remarked the Knook.    As he spoke the sound of his voice seemed to die away, so Claus opened  his eyes to see what caused the change.  To his astonishment he found  himself seated on the bench by his own door, with the Laughing Valley  spread out before him.  That day he visited the Wood-Nymphs and related  his adventure to Queen Zurline and Necile.    \"The Awgwas have become your enemies,\" said the lovely Queen,  thoughtfully; \"so we must do all we can to protect you from their  power.\"    \"It was cowardly to bind him while he slept,\" remarked Necile, with  indignation.    \"The evil ones are ever cowardly,\" answered Zurline, \"but our friend's  slumber shall not be disturbed again.\"    The Queen herself came to the dwelling of Claus that evening and placed  her Seal on every door and window, to keep out the Awgwas.  And under  the Seal of Queen Zurline was placed the Seal of the Fairies and the  Seal of the Ryls and the Seals of the Knooks, that the charm might  become more powerful.    And Claus carried his toys to the children again, and made many more of  the little ones happy.    You may guess how angry the King Awgwa and his fierce band were when it  was known to them that Claus had escaped from the Forest of Ethop.    They raged madly for a whole week, and then held another meeting among  the rocks.    \"It is useless to carry him where the Knooks reign,\" said the King,  \"for he has their protection.  So let us cast him into a cave of our  own mountains, where he will surely perish.\"    This was promptly agreed to, and the wicked band set out that night to  seize Claus.  But they found his dwelling guarded by the Seals of the  Immortals and were obliged to go away baffled and disappointed.    \"Never mind,\" said the King; \"he does not sleep always!\"    Next day, as Claus traveled to the village across the plain, where he  intended to present a toy squirrel to a lame boy, he was suddenly set  upon by the Awgwas, who seized him and carried him away to the  mountains.    There they thrust him within a deep cavern and rolled many huge rocks  against the entrance to prevent his escape.    Deprived thus of light and food, and with little air to breathe, our  Claus was, indeed, in a pitiful plight.  But he spoke the mystic words  of the Fairies, which always command their friendly aid, and they came  to his rescue and transported him to the Laughing Valley in the  twinkling of an eye.    Thus the Awgwas discovered they might not destroy one who had earned  the friendship of the immortals; so the evil band sought other means of  keeping Claus from bringing happiness to children and so making them  obedient.    Whenever Claus set out to carry his toys to the little ones an Awgwa,  who had been set to watch his movements, sprang upon him and snatched  the toys from his grasp.  And the children were no more disappointed  than was Claus when he was obliged to return home disconsolate.  Still  he persevered, and made many toys for his little friends and started  with them for the villages.  And always the Awgwas robbed him as soon  as he had left the Valley.    They threw the stolen playthings into one of their lonely caverns, and  quite a heap of toys accumulated before Claus became discouraged and  gave up all attempts to leave the Valley.  Then children began coming  to him, since they found he did not go to them; but the wicked Awgwas  flew around them and caused their steps to stray and the paths to  become crooked, so never a little one could find a way into the  Laughing Valley.    Lonely days now fell upon Claus, for he was denied the pleasure of  bringing happiness to the children whom he had learned to love.  Yet he  bore up bravely, for he thought surely the time would come when the  Awgwas would abandon their evil designs to injure him.    He devoted all his hours to toy-making, and when one plaything had been  completed he stood it on a shelf he had built for that purpose.  When  the shelf became filled with rows of toys he made another one, and  filled that also.  So that in time he had many shelves filled with gay  and beautiful toys representing horses, dogs, cats, elephants, lambs,  rabbits and deer, as well as pretty dolls of all sizes and balls and  marbles of baked clay painted in gay colors.    Often, as he glanced at this array of childish treasures, the heart of  good old Claus became sad, so greatly did he long to carry the toys to  his children.  And at last, because he could bear it no longer, he  ventured to go to the great Ak, to whom he told the story of his  persecution by the Awgwas, and begged the Master Woodsman to assist him.        7.  The Great Battle Between Good and Evil    Ak listened gravely to the recital of Claus, stroking his beard the  while with the slow, graceful motion that betokened deep thought.  He  nodded approvingly when Claus told how the Knooks and Fairies had saved  him from death, and frowned when he heard how the Awgwas had stolen the  children's toys.  At last he said:    \"From the beginning I have approved the work you are doing among the  children of men, and it annoys me that your good deeds should be  thwarted by the Awgwas.  We immortals have no connection whatever with  the evil creatures who have attacked you.  Always have we avoided them,  and they, in turn, have hitherto taken care not to cross our pathway.  But in this matter I find they have interfered with one of our friends,  and I will ask them to abandon their persecutions, as you are under our  protection.\"    Claus thanked the Master Woodsman most gratefully and returned to his  Valley, while Ak, who never delayed carrying out his promises, at once  traveled to the mountains of the Awgwas.    There, standing on the bare rocks, he called on the King and his people  to appear.    Instantly the place was filled with throngs of the scowling Awgwas, and  their King, perching himself on a point of rock, demanded fiercely:    \"Who dares call on us?\"    \"It is I, the Master Woodsman of the World,\" responded Ak.    \"Here are no forests for you to claim,\" cried the King, angrily.  \"We  owe no allegiance to you, nor to any immortal!\"    \"That is true,\" replied Ak, calmly.  \"Yet you have ventured to  interfere with the actions of Claus, who dwells in the Laughing Valley,  and is under our protection.\"    Many of the Awgwas began muttering at this speech, and their King  turned threateningly on the Master Woodsman.    \"You are set to rule the forests, but the plains and the valleys are  ours!\" he shouted.  \"Keep to your own dark woods!  We will do as we  please with Claus.\"    \"You shall not harm our friend in any way!\" replied Ak.    \"Shall we not?\" asked the King, impudently.  \"You will see!  Our powers  are vastly superior to those of mortals, and fully as great as those of  immortals.\"    \"It is your conceit that misleads you!\" said Ak, sternly.  \"You are a  transient race, passing from life into nothingness.  We, who live  forever, pity but despise you.  On earth you are scorned by all, and in  Heaven you have no place!  Even the mortals, after their earth life,  enter another existence for all time, and so are your superiors.  How  then dare you, who are neither mortal nor immortal, refuse to obey my  wish?\"    The Awgwas sprang to their feet with menacing gestures, but their King  motioned them back.    \"Never before,\" he cried to Ak, while his voice trembled with rage,  \"has an immortal declared himself the master of the Awgwas!  Never  shall an immortal venture to interfere with our actions again!  For we  will avenge your scornful words by killing your friend Claus within  three days.  Nor you, nor all the immortals can save him from our  wrath.  We defy your powers!  Begone, Master Woodsman of the World!

As God is my witness, no.  Mas lleva ese hombre consigo            But that man goes to and fro  algún diablo familiar.                  with his familiar devil.    PASCUAL: Dadlo por asegurado.           Consider the matter done.    DON LUIS. ¡Oh!

Estriba en lo perentorio      The difficulty lies in the hour  del plazo, y en ser quien es.           and his being who he is.
