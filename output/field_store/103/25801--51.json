With this I heartily agree.    Now, when the statements were made, which you in a garbled manner both  quote and misquote, there was in Utah a class of individuals who spent  the greater part of their time in circulating wicked and malicious  reports about the Saints, threatening their lives, committing crimes  and attempting to make the Saints their scape-goats. The officers of  the law were General Government officials appointed by the President  of the United States, and I am sorry to say, some of these were among  the chief villifiers of the people. The most damnable and bloodthirsty  falsehoods were concocted and served up to the people of the United  States to stir them up to anger against the \"despised Mormons.\" Almost  every crime that was committed within a thousand miles of Salt Lake  City was charged to the leaders of the \"Mormon\" people and became the  foundation of a multitude of anti-\"Mormon\" publications that still  flood the world. Because of these false and highly colored tales, in  1857--one year later than the time that most of the utterances were  given on which you so delight to dwell--the Government of the United  States sent an army to suppress in Utah a rebellion that never existed,  and forced the Saints to defend themselves. When the Government found  out how it had blundered it was humiliated.    Now, in brief, these were the conditions at the time, and is it any  wonder that unwise and even harsh things were said? The wonder is  that the people bore it as patiently as they did. The officers were  non-\"Mormons,\" the Territory was under Federal control and contained  many Gentiles, many of whom were most bitter in their feelings and  ever ready to accuse the Saints of crime. The government was strong  enough to enforce the law if broken. Now, I ask you if you believe the  horrors, as they have been pictured, could have existed under such  conditions?    Such a state of affairs would have been a reproach and a shame to the  American government. And no such state of affairs existed.    The conditions at the time led Jacob Forney, superintendent of Indian  affairs in Utah, to declare in 1869:        I fear, and I regret to say it, that with certain parties here      there is a greater anxiety to connect Brigham Young and other      Church dignitaries with every criminal offense than dilgent      endeavor to punish the actual perpetrators of crime.        Bancroft's History of Utah, p. 561.        Whitney's History of Utah, p. 108, vol. 1.    Mr. Forney was a Gentile official and the truth of this statement can  be relied upon.    This being the case, Brigham Young and the \"Mormon\" people could not  have engaged in the crimes charged against them.    In connection with this let me quote from Bancroft:        It is not true that Mormons are not good citizens, lawabiding      and patriotic. Even when hunted down, and robbed and butchered      by the enemies to their faith, they have not retaliated. On this      score they are naturally very sore. When deprived of those sacred      rights given to them in common with all American citizens, when      disfranchised, their homes broken up, their families scattered,      their husband and father seized, fined and imprisoned, they have      not defended themselves by violence but have left their cause to      God and their country.--History of Utah, pp. 390-392.    Again, I repeat, that the presence in Utah of apostates and  anti-\"Mormons\" from the beginning and \"that there are men living in  Utah today who left the Church in the earliest history of our State,  who feel as secure and are just as secure and free from molestation  from their former associates as you or any other man could be,\" proves  the falseness of the malicious accusation that \"Utah was for years a  land of assassination and a field of blood.\"      MR. EVANS' FALSE QUOTATIONS        \"What shall be done with the sheep that stink the flock so? We will      take them, I was going to say, and cut off their tails two inches      behind their ears; however I will use a milder term, and say cut      off their ears.\"    Your conclusion is most certainly far fetched. Had you continued the  quotation your attempt would have appeared even more ridiculous. The  next sentence is:        \"But instead of doing this, we will try to cleanse them; and will      wash them with soap; that will come nigh taking off the skin; we      will then apply a little Scotch snuff, and a little tobacco, and      wash them again until we make them clean.\"    And you try to make this appear as threatening life! It is apparent  that your sense of humor has been sadly neglected. This whole passage  is humorous and you make yourself ridiculous by not having discovered  it.    Again from Parley P. Pratt, you quote:        \"My feelings are with those who have spoken, decidedly and firmly      so.\"    This from page 84. Then you skip to page 86 and add:        \"I need not repeat their doom, it has been told here today, they      have been faithfully warned.\"    Then three paragraphs off, the following:        \"It is too late in the day for us to stop and inquire whether such      an outcast has the truth.\"    This method of proving things reminds me of the reason why you should  be hanged:        And Judas \"went out and hanged himself.\"        \"Go thou and do likewise.\"    Now let me quote some extracts from this discourse which you purposely  left out.        \"Sooner than be subjected to a repetition of these wrongs, _I      for one_, would rather march out today and be shot down. These      are my feelings, and have been for some time. Talk about liberty      of conscience! Have not men liberty of conscience here? Yes. The      Presbyterian, Methodists, Quakers, etc., have _here_ the liberty to      worship God in their own way, and so has every man in the world.      People have the privilege of apostatizing from this Church and      worshiping devils, snakes, toads, or geese, if they please, and      only let their neighbors alone. But they have not the privilege      to disturb the peace, nor to endanger life or liberty; that is      the idea. If they will take that privilege, _I need not repeat      their doom, it has been told here today, they have been faithfully      warned_.\"    Again:        \"He (Gladden Bishop) was disfellowshiped, and received on his      professions of repentance, so often, that the Church at length      refused to admit him any more as a member. These apostates talk of      proof. Have we not proved Joseph Smith to be a prophet, a restorer,      standing at the head of this dispensation? Have we not proved the      priesthood which he placed upon others by the command of God?        \"I see no ground, then, to prove or to investigate the calling of      an apostate, who has always been trying to impose upon this people.      _It is too late in the day for us to stop and inquire whether such      an outcast has the truth_.        \"We have truths already developed, unfulfilled by us--unacted upon.      There are more truths poured out from the eternal fountain, already      than our minds can contain, or that we have places or preparations      to carry out. And yet we are called upon to prove--what? _Whether      an egg that was known to be rotten fifteen years ago, has really      improved by reason of age_!        \"'_You are going to be destroyed_,' say they. '_Destruction awaits      this city_.' Well! what if we are? We are as able to be destroyed      as any people living. What care we whether we are destroyed or not?      These old tabernacles will die of themselves, if left alone.        \"We have nothing to fear on that head, for we are as well prepared      to die as to live. One thing we have heard today, and I am glad      to hear it. We shall not be destroyed in the old way--as we have      been heretofore. We shall have a change in the manner, at least.      We shall probably be destroyed _standing, this time_, and not in      a _sitting_, or _lying position_. We can die as well as others      who are not as well prepared! I am glad that while we do live we      shall not submit to be yoked or saddled like a dumb ass. We shall      not stand still to see men, women, and children murdered, robbed,      plundered, and driven any more, as in the States heretofore. Nor      does God require it at our hands. That is the best news we have      heard today. * * *        \"It is the policy not to wait till you are killed, but act on      the defensive while you still live. I have said enough on this      subject.\"--pp. 86-87.    The vicious malignancy of a depraved mind is made so apparent in this  contrast between your garbled quotations and the whole truth, that it  scarcely deserves further comment.    I have quoted quite extensively in order to show the reason for these  remarks of which you quote such brief and disjointed extracts. You  should remember that the Saints had but a short time before being  driven from their homes at the cannon's mouth, and were forced to  traverse a desert under the most trying circumstances to find a new  abode where they could rest in peace and call their souls their own.  When followed, as they were, by a miserable class that were determined  to again have them driven, where heaven only knows, in their might  and righteous indignation they firmly took their stand for home and  liberty. I for one, say that they were justified in this course, the  protection of their liberty, honor and lives. Had the threats of  their enemies here in Utah been carried out as they boasted that they  would be, and as they were carried out in Missouri and Illinois, then  Brigham Young and his people would have been as thoroughly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50536"],[0,"Gospel Themes: A Treatise on Salient Features of \"Mormonism\" (#9)"],[1,"only pray with his lips,  his heart being far from God. It is therefore no prayer at all. \"The  soul's sincere desire\" is lacking.      \"My words fly up, my thoughts remain below;    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.\"    So says the murderous monarch, as he rises from his knees. Prior to  his ineffectual attempt to supplicate the Throne of Grace, he thus  soliloquizes:      \"My fault is past. But O what form of prayer    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder?'    That cannot be, since I am still possessed    Of those effects for which I did the murder,    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.    May one be pardoned and retain the offense?    * * * * * *    \"Try what repentance can: what can it not?    Yet what can it when one can not repent?\"    (\"Hamlet,\" Act. III, Scene III.)    The unpardonable sin involves utter recreancy to divine light and  power previously possessed. It is the sin against the Holy Ghost; but  one must first receive the Holy Ghost before he is capable of sinning  against it. Such a sin can be committed only by men who have been  equipped with every qualification for celestial glory.    The Sons of Perdition.--\"Thus saith the Lord, concerning all those who  know my power, and have been made partakers there of, and suffered  themselves, through the power of the devil, to be overcome, and to deny  the truth and defy my power--    \"They are they who are the sons of perdition, of whom I say that it had  been better for them never to have been born,    \"For they are vessels of wrath, doomed to suffer the wrath of God, with  the devil and his angels in eternity;    \"Concerning whom I have said there is no forgiveness in this world nor  in the world to come,    \"Having denied the Holy Spirit after having received it, and having  denied the Only Begotten Son of the Father--having crucified him unto  themselves, and put him to an open shame.    \"They are they who shall go away into the lake of fire and brimstone,  with the devil and his angels,    \"And the only ones on whom the second death shall have any power;    \"Wherefore, he saves all except them.\" (D.&C. 76:31-37,44.)    The Saved and Glorified.--But the saved are rewarded according to their  works. The glorified differ like the sun, moon, and stars, typifying,  respectively, celestial, terrestrial, and telestial conditions. They  who cannot abide any of these conditions, \"are not meet for a kingdom  of glory,\" and the utterly disobedient, who will to abide in sin, are  fated to \"remain filthy still\" (D&C 88:22-35).    The Celestial Glory.--The inheritors of celestial exaltation, the  highest degree of glory, are they who render to the Great Giver the  fulness of their obedience, manifesting a willingness to lay all upon  the altar at his bidding. In short, \"to do all things whatsoever the  Lord their God shall command them\" (Abr. 3:25).    \"They are they who received the testimony of Jesus, and believed on his  name and were baptized after the manner of his burial, being buried in  the water in his name, and this according to the commandment which he  has given,    \"That by keeping the commandments they might be washed and cleansed  from all their sins, and receive the Holy Spirit by the laying on of  hands of him who is ordained and sealed unto this power.    \"And who overcome by faith, and are sealed by the Holy Spirit of  promise, which the Father sheds forth upon all those who are just and  true.    \"They are they who are the Church of the first born.    \"They are they into whose hands the Father has given all things--    \"They are they who are Priests and Kings, who have received of his  fulness, and of his glory,    \"And are Priests of the Most High, after the order to Melchizedek,  which was after the order of Enoch, which was after the order of the  Only Begotten Son;    \"Wherefore, as it is written, they are Gods, even the sons of God--    \"Wherefore all things are theirs, whether life or death, or things  present, or things to come, all are theirs and they are Christ's and  Christ is God's. * * *    \"These shall dwell in the presence of God and his Christ for ever and  ever.    \"These are they whom he shall bring with him, when he shall come in the  clouds of heaven, to reign on the earth over his people.    \"These are they who shall have part in the first resurrection.    \"These are they who shall come forth in the resurrection of the just. *  * *    \"These are they whose bodies are celestial, whose glory is that of the  sun, even the glory of God, the highest of all, whose glory the sun of  the firmament is written of as being typical.\"--(D.&C. 76:51-59, 62-65,  70.)    The Terrestrial Glory.--They who receive not the gospel here, but  receive it hereafter; they who die without law; also \"honorable men of  the earth, blinded by the craftiness of men;\"--    \"These are they who receive of his glory, but not of his fulness;    \"These are they who receive of the presence of the Son, but not of the  fulness of the Father;    \"Wherefore they are bodies terrestrial, and not bodies celestial, and  differ in glory as the moon differs from the sun.    \"These are they who are not valiant in the testimony of Jesus;  wherefore they obtain not the crown over the kingdom of our God.\" (D.&  C. 76:76-79.)    The Telestial World.--Concerning the inhabitants of the telestial  world, it is written:    \"These are they who received not the gospel of Christ, neither the  testimony of Jesus.    \"These are they who deny not the Holy Spirit.    \"These are they who are thrust down to hell.    \"These are they who shall not be redeemed from the devil, until the  last resurrection, until the Lord, even Christ the Lamb, shall have  finished his work.    \"These are they who receive not of his fulness in the eternal world,  but of the Holy Spirit through the ministration of the terrestrial:    \"And also the telestial receive it of the administering of angels  who are appointed to minister for them, or who are appointed to be  ministering spirits for them, for they shall be heirs of salvation. * *  *    \"These are they who are liars, and sorcerers, and adulterers and  whoremongers, and whosoever loves and makes a lie.    \"These are they who suffer the wrath of God on the earth.    \"These are they who suffer the vengeance of eternal fire.    \"These are they who are cast down to hell and suffer the wrath of  Almighty God, until the fulness of times when Christ shall have subdued  all enemies under his feet, and shall have perfected his work. * * *    \"And they shall be servants of the Most High, but where God and Christ  dwell they cannot come, worlds without end.\" (D.&C. 76:82-88, 103-106,  112.)    \"And the glory of the celestial is one, even as the glory of the sun is  one.    \"And the glory of the terrestrial is one, even as the glory of the moon  is one.    \"And the glory of the telestial is one, even as the glory of the stars  is one, for as one star differs from another star in glory, even so  differs one from another in glory in the telestial world.\" (D.&C.  76:96-98; 1 Cor. 15:40,41.)    A Nautical Illustration.--Thirty years ago I was crossing the Atlantic  on an ocean liner. I was a first cabin passenger, and besides myself  there were forty or fifty others in that part of the vessel. The second  cabin had about twice as many passengers, and in the steerage were  several hundred more. I found that the first cabin berths--secured by a  fortunate few--were not only the best furnished, but the most favorably  situated for comfort, convenience, and safety. The food was of the  choicest, every possible courtesy was shown to the passengers, and they  had the full freedom of the ship. They might go down into the second  cabin, or lower down, into the steerage, at will, and return without  hindrance or question. They had paid for these privileges, and were  therefore entitled to them. The captain and other officers were their  associates.    It was different in the second cabin. There the food was not so good,  the berths were not so comfortable, and the privileges were fewer.  The passengers there might descend into the steerage, but were not  permitted upon the upper deck. In the steerage, conditions were even  less favorable. The food was still poorer, and the restrictions yet  more rigid. The occupants of that section were not allowed even in the  second cabin. Having paid only for steerage accommodations, these were  all they could consistently claim.    Viewing the situation, I said to myself, What a striking analogy of  the final destiny of the human race, as set forth in the revelations  of God! All men rewarded according to their works, and saved according  to their merits in the eternal mansions of the Father! And I then and  there resolved anew that I would be a first cabin passenger on the good  ship Zion, over the ocean of life, into the haven of celestial glory.    Men's Desires a Basis of Judgment.--At a date subsequent to February  16, 1832, when Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon received that wonderful  vision, portraying the celestial, terrestrial and telestial glories,  the heavens were again opened to the Prophet, who thus describes what  he saw:    \"I beheld the celestial kingdom of God, and the glory thereof, whether  in the body or out I cannot tell. I saw the transcendent beauty of the  gate through which the heirs of that kingdom will enter, which was like  unto circling flames of fire; also the blazing throne of God, whereon  was seated the Father and the Son. I saw the beautiful streets of that  kingdom, which had the appearance of being paved with gold. I saw  Fathers Adam and Abraham, and my father and mother, my brother, Alvin,  that has long since slept, and marveled how it was that he had obtained  an inheritance in that kingdom, seeing that he had departed this life  before the Lord had set His hand to gather Israel the second time, and  had not been baptized for the remission of sins.    \"Thus came the"]]]
