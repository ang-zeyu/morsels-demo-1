Then the damaged bicycle was placed in  the rear of the turnout, and Seth Dickerson drove off, while Sam  and Dick followed on their steeds of steel.    \"I see you air dressed in cadet uniforms,\" remarked the farmer, as  the party proceeded on its way.  \"Be you fellers from Pornell  school?\"    \"No; we come from Putnam Hall,\" answered Tom.    \"Oh, yes--'bout the same thing, I take it.  How is matters up to  the school--larnin' a heap?\"    \"We are trying to learn all we have to.\"    \"Had some trouble up thar, didn't ye?  My wife's brother was  a-tellin' me about it.  A darkey stole some money an' watches, an'  that like.\"    \"They think he stole them,\" said Tom.    \"We can hardly believe it.\"    \"Why don't Captain Putnam hunt around them air pawnshops fer the  watches?\" went on Seth Dickerson, after a pause.    \"The thief would most likely pawn 'em, to my way of thinkin'.\"    \"He hasn't much of a chance to do that.  But I presume the police  will keep their eyes open.\"    \"I was over to Auburn yesterday--had to go to see about a  mortgage on our farm--and I stopped into one of them pawnbrokin'  shops to buy a shot-gun, if I could git one cheap.  While I was in  there a big boy came in and pawned a gold watch an' two shirt  studs.\"    \"Is that so,\" returned Tom, with much interest.  \"What kind of a  looking boy was it?\"    \"A tall, slim feller, with reddish hair.  He had sech shifty eyes  I couldn't help but think that maybe he had stolen them things  jest to raise some spending money.\"    \"Did he give his name?\"    \"He said Jack Smith, but I don't think thet vas correct, for he  hesitated afore he gave it.\"    \"A tall, slim fellow, with reddish hair and shifty eyes,\" mused  Tom.  \"Do you remember how he was dressed?\"    \"He had on a rough suit of brownish-green and a derby hat with a  hole knocked in one side.\"    \"My gracious me!\" burst out the boy.  \"Can it be possible!\"    \"Can wot be possible, lad?\"    \"That description fits one of our students exactly.\"  Tom called  to Dick and Sam.  \"Come up here, both of you!\"    \"What's up, Tom; do you feel worse?\" asked Dick, as he wheeled as  closely to the seat of the wagon as possible.    \"No, I feel better.  But I've made a big discovery--at least, I  feel pretty certain that I have?\"    \"What discovery?\" questioned Sam.    \"I've discovered who stole that money and other stuff.\"    \"And who was it?\" came quickly from both brothers.    \"Jim Caven.\"          CHAPTER X    A STRANGE MESSAGE FROM THE SEA      \"Jim Caven!\" repeated Dick slowly, \"What makes you believe that he  is guilty?\"    \"From what Mr. Dickerson here says,\" answered Tom, and repeated  what the farmer had told him.    \"Gracious, that does look black for Caven!\" said Dick, when he had  finished.  He turned to the farmer.  \"Would you recognize that boy  again if you saw him?\"    \"I allow as how I would.  His eyes was wot got me--never saw  sech unsteady ones afore in my life.\"    \"Yes, those eyes put me down on Caven the minute I saw him,\"  answered Tom.  \"More than half of the boys at the Hall have put  him down as a first-class sneak, although we can't exactly tell  why.\"    \"See here,\" said Dick.  \"I think it would be best if Mr. Dickerson  would drive back to the Hall with us and tell Captain Putnam of  what he knows.\"    \"And see if he can identify Caven,\" finished Sam.  \"Are you  willing to do that, Mr. Dickerson?\"    \"Well, to tell the truth, I've got some business to attend to  now,\" was the slow reply.    \"I am sure Captain Putnam will pay you for your trouble,\" went on  Sam.  \"If he won't, we will.\"    \"You seem mighty anxious to bring this Caven to justice,\"  smiled  the farmer.    \"We are, for two reasons,\" said Tom.  \"The first is, because he  isn't the nice sort to have around, and the second is, because one  of the men working at the school, a colored waiter, whom we all  liked, has been suspected of this crime and had to run away to  avoid arrest.\"    \"I see. Well--\"  The farmer mused for a moment.  \"All right, I'll  go back with ye--and at once.\"    The team was turned around as well as the narrow confines of the  hilly road permitted, and soon the Rover boys were on their way  back to Putnam Hall, a proceeding which pleased Tom in more ways  than one, since he would not have now to put up at a strange  resort to have his ankle and his wheel cared for.  They bowled  along at a rapid gait, the horses having more speed in them than  their appearance indicated.  They were just turning into the road  leading to Putnam Hall grounds when Dick espied several cadets  approaching, bound for the lake shore.    \"Here come Caven, Willets, and several others!\" he cried.  \"Mr.  Dickerson, do you recognize any of those boys?\"    The farmer gave a searching glance, which lasted until the  approaching cadets were beside the wagon.  Then he pointed his  hand at Jim Caven.    \"Thet's the boy I seed over to Auburn, a-pawning thet watch an'  them studs,\" he announced.  \"He's got his sodger uniform on, but I  know him jest the same.\"    Jim Caven looked at the farmer in astonishment.  Then when he  heard Seth Dickerson's words he fell back and his face grew  deathly white.    \"I--I don't know you,\" he stammered.    \"I seed you over to Auburn, in a pawnshop,\" repeated Dickerson.    \"It--It isn't true!\" gasped Caven.  \"I was never over to Auburn  in my life.  Why should I go there to a pawnshop?\"    \"I guess you know well enough, Caven,\" said Tom.  \"You bad better  come back to the Hall with us and have a talk with Captain  Putnam.\"    \"I won't go with you.  This is--is a--a plot against me,\"  stammered the slim youth.    \"You will go back!\" cried Dick, and caught Caven by the arm.  But  with a jerk the seared boy freed himself and ran down the road at  the top of his speed.    Sam and Dick pursued him on their bicycles, while some of the  others came after on foot.  Seeing this, Jim Caven took to the  woods just as Dan Baxter had done, and the boys found it  impossible to track him any further.    \"I wonder if he'll come back tonight?\" said Dick, as the party  returned to where they had left Seth Dickerson and Tom.    \"I don't think he will,\" answered Sam.  \"I declare, he must be  almost as bad as the Baxters!\"    The farm wagon soon reached the Hall, and Dick ushered Seth  Dickerson into Captain Putnam's office.  The captain looked  surprised at the unexpected visitor, but listened with deep  concern to all the farmer and the Rover boys had to say.    \"This certainly looks black for Caven,\" he said at last.  \"I did  not think I had such a bad boy here.  And you say he got away from  you?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"It is a question if he will come back--providing he is really  guilty.  I will have his trunk and bag searched without delay.  But if he is guilty how did that ruby stud and the watch come into  Alexander Pop's possession?\"    \"He was down on Aleck,\" replied Tom, who had hobbled in after the  others.  \"And, besides, he thought if Aleck was arrested the  search for the criminal would go no further.\"    \"Perhaps you are right, Thomas.  It is a sad state of affairs at  the best.\"    The party ascended to the dormitory which Jim Caven occupied with  several smaller boy.  His trunk was found locked, but Captain Putnam  took upon himself the responsibility of hunting up a key to fit the  box.  Once open the trunk was found to contain, among other things,  a bit of heavy cloth tied with a piece of strong cord.    \"Here we are, sure enough!\" cried the captain, as he undid the  package and brought to light several of the missing watches and  also some of the jewelry.  \"I guess it is a clear case against  Caven, and Pop is innocent.\"    \"I wish we could tell Pop of it,\" put in Dick.    \"He must feel awfully bad.\"    \"I will do what I can for the negro, Rover.  I am very sorry  indeed, now, that I suspected him,\" said Captain Putnam, with a  slow shake of his head.    At the bottom of the trunk was a pocketbook containing nearly all  of the money which had been stolen.  A footing-up revealed the  fact that two watches and three gold shirt studs were still  missing.    \"And those were pawned in Auburn,\" said Sam.  \"Just wait and see  if I am not right.\"    A party was organized to hunt for Caven, and the captain himself  went to Auburn that very evening.  The hunt for the missing boy  proved unsuccessful, and it may be added here that he never turned  up at Putnam Hall again nor at his home in Middletown, having run  away to the West.    When Captain Putnam came back he announced that he had recovered  all but one watch.  The various goods and the money were distributed  among their rightful owners, and it must be confessed that a big  sigh of relief went up from the cadets who had suffered.  The  single missing timepiece was made good to the boy who had lost it,  by the captain buying a similar watch for the youth.    After this several weeks passed without anything of special  interest occurring outside of a stirring baseball match with a  club from Ithaca, which Putnam Hall won by a score of six to  three.  In this game Dick made a much-needed home run, thus  covering himself with glory.    \"The Rovers are out of sight!\" was Larry's comment.  \"Whatever  they do they do well.\"    \"And they hang together like links of a chain,\" added Fred.  \"The  friend of one is the friend of all, and the same can be said of an  enemy.\"    One morning a telegraph messenger from Cedarville was seen  approaching the Hall, just as the boys were forming for the  roll-call.    \"Here's a telegram for somebody,\" said Sam.    \"I hope it's not bad news.\"    \"A message for Richard Rover,\" announced George Strong, after"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5780"],[0,"The Rover Boys at School; Or, The Cadets of Putnam Hall (#9)"],[1,"decidedly harmful.  Come, the keys.\"    Josiah Crabtree's tones were so harsh that Tom's heart rebelled on  the moment.    \"I shan't give them to you, Mr. Crabtree.  You have no right to  place me here.  I wish to see the proprietor, Captain Putnam, at  once.\"    \"Do you--er--refuse to recognize my authority over you?\" cried  Josiah Crabtree passionately.    \"I do, sir.  When I have met Captain Putnam and been enrolled as a  cadet it may be different.  But at present I am not a cadet and  not under your authority.\"    \"We'll see, boy, we'll see!\" came hotly from the head assistant.  \"Before I am done with you, you will be sorry that you have defied  me!\"    And with these words he went out, slamming the door after him.  Tom had made an enemy at the very start of his career as a cadet.          CHAPTER VIII    A MEETING IN THE MESSROOM      In the meantime Dick, Sam, and Fred had been having quite a  different experience.  George Strong, the second assistant at  Putnam: Hall, was not only a first-class teacher, but a calm and  fair-minded gentleman as well; and in addition, and this was  highly important, he was not so old but that he could remember  perfectly well when he had been a boy himself.    \"Come this way, my lads,\" he said with a faint smile.  \"I trust  you will soon feel at home in Putnam Hall.  It is Captain Putnam's  desire to have all of his boys, as he calls them, feel that way.\"    \"What will Mr. Crabtree do with my brother?\" asked Dick anxiously.    \"I cannot say, Rover.  Probably he will place him in the guardroom  until Captain Putnam arrives.\"    \"I am sure he didn't do much that was wrong.\"    \"We had better not discuss that question, my boy.  Come this way;  I will conduct you to your room.\"    \"George Strong showed them into the main hallway and up the stairs  to the second story.  Passing through a side hall, they entered a  large, bright dormitory overlooking the parade- and the  playground.  Here were eight beds, four on either side, with as  many chairs, and also a table and two washbowls, with running  water supplied from a tower on the roof, the water being pumped up  by the aid of a windmill.    \"This room has not been occupied this year,\" said the teacher.  \"Captain Putnam and Mrs. Green, our housekeeper, thought it might  be as well to put you in here together, along with Lawrence Colby  and Frank Harrington, when they come.  I believe you are all  friends, at least Harrington and Colby intimated as much in their  letters.\"    \"They told the truth,\" cried Sam.  \"This just suits me, and we owe  Captain Putnam and Mrs. Green one for doing it.\"    George Strong smiled.  Then the smile faded as he remembered how  Josiah Crabtree once told Captain Putnam that he did not believe  in letting chums room together.  \"Place each boy among strangers,\"  Crabtree had said.  \"It will make him more reliant.\"  But Captain  Putnam had not listened to the crabbed old fellow, and Strong was  glad of it.    \"Here is a closet, in which each of you can stow his clothing when  it is dealt out to him.  Your ordinary suits will, of course, be  placed away for you, for during the academy term, you will as  cadets wear only your uniforms.\"    \"When will I get my uniform?\" asked Fred, who was anxious to don  his \"soldier fixings,\" as he put it.    \"Tomorrow, if we have any suit on hand that fits.\"    \"I don't want a second-handed suit,\" put in Sam.    George Strong laughed. \"Don't worry, my boy; every pupil gets new  clothing.  But, many boys are so nearly of a size that Captain  Putnam always keeps a dozen or more suits on hand.\"    \"Oh, that's different.\"    \"The beds are all numbered, and to avoid disputes we always put  the eldest boy in bed No. 1, and so on.  You can arrange this  between yourselves, and I feel certain you won't get into a dispute.\"    \"We won't quarrel,\" said Dick.  \"I don't how exactly how old Frank  and Larry are, though.\"    \"Then arrange to suit yourselves until they come,\" concluded Mr.  Strong.    Having shown then their dormitory he conducted them through the  building and exhibited the various class- and drill-rooms, and  then ended up by introducing them to several other pupils,  including Bart Conners, the major for the term, and Harry Blossom  and Dave Kearney, the two captains.    \"Welcome to Putnam Hall!\" cried Major Bart Conners, a tall youth  of nearly seventeen.  He shook hands all around, and so did the  two captains; and then the assistant teacher left the party.    \"Oh, it was a shame the way Crabtree treated your brother!\" said  Captain Harry to Dick.  \"It's a wonder to me that Captain Putnam  keeps him here.\"    \"I was in for getting up a petition to have Crabtree removed,\" put in  Captain Dave. \"I think every boy in the academy would sign it.\"    \"I hope Captain Putnam is not so severe,\" said Fred.    \"Not by a jugful, Garrison,\" came from Captain Harry.  \"He's  strict, and makes everybody toe the mark, but you couldn't find a  better all-around man.\"    \"Then he'll suit me.\"    It was now quite late, and presently a loud, clear bell rang out  in the belfry.    \"Six o'clock,\" said Captain Dave Kearney.  \"That is to bring in  the boys from the playground.  They have fifteen minutes in which  to wash up for supper.  Excuse me, I'll be needed in ten minutes  to form my company,\"  and soon the newcomers found themselves  alone with several others who had just arrived at Putnam Hall.    The cadets were rushing from everywhere to the lavatories, to make  themselves presentable on parade.  Soon they began to form on the  grounds before the building.  Dick and the others saw them divide  up into two companies, with Harry Blossom at the head of the first  and Dave Kearney leading the second.  The two companies, called a  battalion, were commanded by Major Bart.  In addition to the  officers, there were two drummers, a bass-drummer, and two fifers.    \"Companies, attention!\" came the command, and the lines became  rigid.  \"By column of fours--march!\"  The drums struck up, and  away went the columns of each company, to the front of the parade  ground.  Then they wheeled to the right, the fifers started up a  lively air, and the cadets marched around the hall three times,  and at last into the door nearest to the mess-hall or dining room.    \"By Jinks, that's fine!\" cried Sam.  \"Cadet life will suit me, I'm  sure of it.\"    The cadets had hardly disappeared before one of the waiters in the  mess-hall came forward.  \"Please come right in, gents,\" he said.  \"Mr. Strong will give you places at the tables.\" And they went  and soon found themselves seated among as jolly a set of boys as  they had ever encountered.    Of course there were exceptions; where would there not be in a  crowd of nearly a hundred?  There were pupils there who were  morose by nature, those who seldom or never smiled, and there were  likewise half a dozen of the Dan Baxter order--bullies and  worse.  We shall see more of all these characters as our tale  progresses.    \"I wonder if Tom is going to get any supper?\" said Dick to his  younger brother.    \"If they don't give him any, I'll raise a kick, Dick.\"    \"So will I.\"    \"Silence at the table!\" came in the sharp tones of Josiah  Crabtree, who presided over the particular board at which the  Rovers had been placed.    \"I was only wondering if my brother was going to get any supper,\"  returned Sam boldly.    \"Silence!  I will take care of that.\"    In the midst of the meal a newcomer appeared at the doorway to the  messroom.  It was Dan Baxter.    \"Well, Baxter, how is this?\" asked Mr. Strong, the teacher nearest  to him.    \"I--I was carried to Bar Landing,\" answered the bully sheepishly.    \"Bar Landing?  Then you were on the afternoon boat from Ithaca?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"How did you come to be carried past Cedarville?\"    \"I--er--fell asleep on the trip.\"    \"Indeed!  Well, when next you travel you had better try to keep  awake,\" was George Strong's comment, and a titter passed along the  table, which made Dan Baxter very angry.    \"Sit down here. Alexander, help Baxter to some supper.\"    \"Yes, sah,\" came from the waiter; and no more was said.  Presently  Baxter caught sight of Dick at the table opposite, and he looked  daggers at the youth.  \"He's got it in for me,\" thought Dick; and  he was right.    The supper at an end, the pupils were allowed two hours to  themselves--one hour outdoors if they wished it, or both hours  in the reading room, which was well supplied with books and all of  the best magazines.  The newcomers went out in a bunch, and  Captain Harry Blossom accompanied them.    \"I'll show you the gymnasium, if you wish to see it,\" he said.    \"I would like to know something about Tom,\" replied Dick.  \"Where  have they placed him?\"    \"Undoubtedly in the guardroom.\"    \"Where is that?\"    \"Do you see that window over there?\" and Captain Harry pointed  with his hand.    \"Yes,\" came from Dick and Sam together.    \"Well, that's the window to the place.\"    \"I wonder if I can't talk to my brother?\" went on Dick.    \"It's against the rules to talk to a prisoner.\"    \"Well, I'm going to talk anyway,\" said Dick with a recklessness  which was unusual to him.  \"I want to find out just what they are  doing with him.\"    \"I guess I had best leave this crowd,\" remarked the young captain  of Company A.    Dick was about to ask why, when Sam nudged him on the arm.  \"Let  him go,\" whispered the younger brother.    In a moment more Captain Harry had walked away.    \"Don't you see what he meant?\" asked Sam aloud.    \"Well hardly.\"    \"Then you are losing some of your wit, Dick.  He didn't want to  see us break the rules.  I suppose if he had seen us he would have  felt it was his duty to report us.\"    \"That's so, Sam.  How thick I was!  Well, I'm going over to the  window now.\"    \"So am I.\"    \"And I'll go too,\" added Fred.    Off the three hurried across the parade ground, the other new  cadets watching them curiously, for all had heard of what"]]]
