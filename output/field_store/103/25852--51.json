And  Elijah committed the keys of this dispensation of turning the hearts  of the fathers and children towards each other to Joseph Smith and to  Oliver Cowdery. This took place in the Kirtland Temple on the 3rd of  April, 1836. [28]    It was not, however, until the Nauvoo period that the doctrine of  salvation for the dead was fully developed and active steps taken  looking to the actual performance of ordinances in their behalf. In  the revelation that was given on the 19th of January, 1841, the Saints  {XXXVIII} were commanded to build a house unto the Lord, a Holy Temple  unto the Most High. \"For,\" said this revelation, \"there is not a place  found on earth that He may come to and restore again that which was  lost unto you, or which He hath taken away, even the fullness of the  Priesthood; for a baptismal font there is not upon the earth, that  they, my Saints, may be baptized for those who are dead; for this  ordinance belongeth to my house, and cannot be acceptable to me, only  in the days of your poverty, wherein ye are not able to build a house  unto me. But I command you, all ye my Saints, to build a house unto me;  and I grant unto you a sufficient time to build a house unto me, and  during this time your baptisms shall be acceptable unto me.\" That is,  the baptisms for the dead should be acceptable unto the Lord in other  places than the temple, until the temple should be prepared for that  ordinance, if the Saints would be diligent and build it according to  the Lord's appointment. Moreover, the information is imparted in the  revelation that, it is \"in Zion, and in her stakes, and in Jerusalem,  those places which I [the Lord] have appointed for refuge, shall be the  places for your baptisms for your dead.\"    After this revelation was given to the Church baptism for the dead  was a subject frequently expounded in Nauvoo, both by the Prophet and  other leading elders. It was a theme upon which the Twelve Apostles  dwelt in their Epistles to the Church both in America and in Great  Britain. Baptisms for the dead were performed for some time in the  Mississippi river, and later, in the latter part of November, 1841, in  the baptismal font erected in the basement of the Temple, and dedicated  for that sacred purpose. For a time some irregularities obtained in  relation to this ordinance owing to the fact that the perfect knowledge  of the order of it had not then been obtained, but was developed later  in this Nauvoo period of the History of the Church, as will appear in  Volume V of this work.    It was a mighty stride forward in the doctrinal development of the  Church, this idea of the possibility of salvation for the dead through  the administration of the ordinances of the Gospel for and in their  behalf by their kindred on earth; and greatly enlarged the views of  the Saints in relation to the importance and wide spread effects of  their work. The ends of the earth indeed converged in the labors of  the Saints henceforth, for their activities in the administrations of  the holy ordinances of the Gospel would affect all past generations as  well as affect all generations to come. It was a bringing into view the  full half of the work which up to this time had lain hidden behind the  horizon of men's conceptions of that \"great and marvelous work\" which  God from the beginning declared was about to be brought forth among the  children of men. [29]    {XXXIX} _Other Doctrines of the Prophet's Teaching_.    Other doctrines taught by the Prophet within the period covered by this  volume, relate to the Priesthood; to the Status of Translated Persons;  to Man's Personal Responsibility for his own conduct, to Election and  Reprobation. A word in relation to each of these doctrines must suffice  here since they do not reach their full development in the teachings  of the Prophet until the last two years of his eventful life, and must  therefore receive fuller treatment in the Introduction of Volume V.    Relative to the Priesthood, the most important items advanced by the  Prophet in this volume, are, first, the unity of all Priesthood, and  second, the place and power assigned to Adam in the order of the  dispensations of the Gospel granted to our earth. Treating on the  unity of the Priesthood, the Prophet said: \"There are two Priesthoods  spoken of in the Scriptures, viz., the Melchisedek and the Aaronic or  Levitical. Although there are two Priesthoods, yet the Melchisedek  Priesthood comprehends the Aaronic or Levitical Priesthood, and is  the grand head, and holds the highest authority which pertains to  the Priesthood, and the keys of the kingdom of God in all ages of  the world to the latest posterity on the earth, and is the channel  through which all knowledge, doctrine, the plan of salvation, and  every important matter is revealed from heaven. Its institution was  prior to 'the foundation of this earth, or the morning stars sang  together, or the Sons of God shouted for joy,' and is the highest and  holiest Priesthood, and is after the order of the Son of God, and all  other Priesthoods are only parts, ramifications, powers and blessings  belonging to the same, and are held, controlled, and directed by it. It  is the channel through which the Almighty commenced revealing His glory  at the beginning of the creation of this earth, and through which He  has continued to reveal Himself to the children of men to the present  time, and through which He will make known His purposes to the end of  time.\"    Respecting the place of Adam in the Priesthood and his relationship to  the dispensations of that Priesthood to our earth, the Prophet said:  \"Commencing with Adam, who was the first man, who is spoken of in  Daniel as being the 'Ancient of Days,' or in other words, the first  and oldest of all, the great, grand progenitor of whom it is said  in another place he is Michael, because he was the first and father  of all, not only by progeny, but the first to hold the spiritual  blessings, to whom was made known the plan of ordinances for the  salvation of his posterity unto the end, and to whom Christ was first  revealed, and through whom Christ has been revealed from heaven, and  will continue to be revealed from henceforth. Adam holds the keys of  the dispensation of the fullness of times; i. e., the dispensation  of all the times have been and will {XL} be revealed through him  from the beginning to Christ, and from Christ to the end of all the  dispensations that are to be revealed. 'Having made known unto us the  mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He hath  purposed in Himself: that in the dispensation of the fullness of times  He might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are  in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him (Ephesians, 1st chap.,  9th and 10th verses). Now the purpose in Himself in the winding up  scene of the last dispensation is that all things pertaining to that  dispensation should be conducted precisely in accordance with the  preceding dispensations. And again. God purposed in Himself that there  should not be an eternal fullness until every dispensation should be  fulfilled and gathered together in one, and that all things whatsoever,  that should be gathered together in one in those dispensations unto the  same fullness and eternal glory, should be in Christ Jesus; therefore  He set the ordinances to be the same forever and ever, and set Adam to  watch over them, to reveal them from heaven to man, or to send angels  to reveal them. * * * * These angels are under the direction of Michael  or Adam, who acts under the direction of the Lord. * * * * There are  many things which belong to the powers of the Priesthood and the keys  thereof, that have been kept hid from before the foundation of the  world; they are hid from the wise and prudent to be revealed in the  last times.\"    That it was the design of the Lord in building the Temple at Nauvoo,  that there should be other ordinances revealed besides \"baptism for  the dead,\" is clearly manifested in the revelation itself, for it  says: \"And again, verily I say unto you, how shall your washings be  acceptable unto me, except ye perform them in a house which you have  built to my name. * * * * Therefore, verily I say unto you, that  your anointings, and your washings, and your baptisms for the dead,  and your solemn assemblies, and your memorials for your sacrifices,  by the sons of Levi and for your oracles in your most holy places  wherein you receive conversations, and your statutes and judgments,  for the beginning of the revelations and foundation of Zion, and for  the glory, honor, and endowment of all her municipals, are ordained by  the ordinance of my holy house which my people are always commanded to  build unto my holy name. And verily I say unto you, let this house be  built unto my name, that I may reveal mine ordinances therein, unto my  people; for I deign to reveal unto my Church things which have been  kept hid from before the foundation of the word, things that pertain to  the dispensation of the fullness of times.\"    The ordinances here mentioned in addition to baptism for the dead are  chiefly connected with the Priesthood of the Church, and were fully  developed in the teachings of the Prophet before the close of his  eventful career.    {XLI} As to the status of translated personages, he said: \"Many have  supposed that the doctrine of translation was a doctrine whereby men  were taken immediately into the presence of God, and into an eternal  fulness, but this is a mistaken idea. Their place of habitation is that  of the terrestrial order, and a place prepared for such characters  He held in reserve to be ministering angels unto many planets,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60736"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 5 (#9)"],[1,"im. God in these  revelations deals with him indeed as with a son whom he loves, if it be  true--and we have warrant of holy writ that it is--that God chasteneth  whom he loveth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. (Heb. 12:  6-8.) The following quotations from the revelations will illustrate  what I mean. The Lord thus reproved the Prophet in 1829: \"And behold,  how oft you have transgressed the commandments and the laws of God, and  have gone on in the persuasions of men. * * * * You should not have  feared man more than God. * * * * Thou wast chosen to do the work of  the Lord, but because of transgression, if thou art not aware, thou  wilt fall. * * * Repent. * * * Except thou do this, thou shalt be  delivered up and become as other men, and have no more gift. * * * Thou  hast suffered the counsel of thy director to be trampled upon from the  beginning.\" (Doc. and Cov., Sec. 3.)    Again in 1829 this: \"I command you my servant Joseph to repent and walk  more uprightly before me, and yield to the persuasions of men no more.\"  (Doc. and Cov., Sec. 5.)    This was said of the Prophet in a revelation given in 1830: \"After  it was truly manifested unto this first elder (Joseph Smith) that  he had received a remission of his sins, he was entangled again in  the vanities of the world. But after repenting and humbling himself  sincerely, through faith, God ministered unto him by an holy angel,\"  etc. that is, took him again into divine favor. (See Doc. and Cov.,  Sec. 20.)    Again in 1830: \"Thou art not excusable in thy transgressions;  nevertheless, go thy way and sin no more.\" (Doc. and Cov., Sec. 24.)    In 1831 this was said of the Prophet: \"There are those who have sought  occasion against him without cause; nevertheless he has sinned, but  verily I say unto you, I the Lord, forgive sins unto those who confess  their sins before me and ask forgiveness, who have not sinned unto  death.\" (Doc. and Cov., Sec. 64.)    {XXXVII} In 1833, this: \"Verily, I say unto you, my son, thy sins are  forgiven thee, according to thy petition, for thy prayers, and the  prayers of thy brethren, have come up into my ears.\" (Doc. and Cov.,  Sec. 90.)    In the same year this: \"Verily, I say unto Joseph Smith, Jr., you have  not kept the commandments, and must needs stand rebuked before the  Lord.\" (Doc. and Cov., Sec. 93.)    In 1841 this was said to the Prophet: \"Verily thus saith the Lord unto  you my servant Joseph Smith, I am well pleased with your offering and  acknowledgments, which you have made, for unto this end have I raised  you up, that I might show forth my wisdom through the weak things of  the earth.\" (Doc. and Cov., Sec. 124.)    It is but in harmony then with the whole course of God with this man  that in this revelation on marriage his sins should be referred too.  It is particularly Joseph Smith-like that it should be done, and it is  done: \"Let my handmaid forgive my servant Joseph his trespasses; and  then shall she be forgiven her trespasses wherein she has trespassed  against me. * * * * * * Let no one, therefore, set on my servant  Joseph; for I will justify him; for he shall do the sacrifice which I  require at his hands, for his transgressions, saith the Lord your God.\"  (Doc. and Cov., Sec. 132: 56-60.)    Thus it will appear that all the frankness with which the Prophet was  reproved in other revelations is manifested in this revelation on  marriage; and hence, to the extent of that characteristic, identifies  this revelation on the marriage covenant with the other revelations  received by the Prophet.    _3. The Evidence of the Largeness of Range in the Revelation on  Marriage_.    The next characteristic to be noted is the largeness of range in this  revelation so characteristic of all the Prophet's revelations. His main  inquiry was why God justified the ancient patriarchs in having many  wives. The answer went far beyond the inquiry, and there was given to  the Prophet a new marriage law, so far transcending the conceptions of  men concerning marriage, as the thoughts of God transcend the thoughts  of men on all subjects. The marriage covenant must be an eternal one,  not marriage \"until death does you part.\" The marriage relation will  exist in heaven. Pro-creation within the marriage covenant of man  is to be an eternal, creative power. It shall people the increasing  heavens as it has the multiplying worlds with offspring of the Sons  of God. It is to be of the things that shall not pass away, but a  means of perpetuating the lives and all their purifying, and uplifting  relationships. And the power to establish these relationships is in the  Priesthood of God, the keys of which were restored through Joseph Smith.    {XXXVIII}_4. The Evidence of Identical Phraseology in This and  Other Revelations_.    The recurrence and peculiar use of certain phrases to be found in both  this revelation on Marriage and the other revelations given out by  Joseph Smith, establish clearly the authorship to be the same. Such,  for example, as the peculiar use of \"_mine_\" instead of \"my.\" In the  revelation on marriage we have this: \"Behold! _mine_ house is a house  of order\" (v. 8); \"If a man be called of my Father, * * * by _mine_ own  voice,\" etc., (v. 59). \"Through the medium of _mine_ anointed, whom I  have appointed,\" etc., (v. 7); and are sealed * * * according to _mine_  appointment (v. 26); and let _mine_ handmaid Emma Smith, (v. 54);  \"verily I say, let _mine_ handmaid forgive my servant Joseph,\" etc.,  (v. 56).    Let these expressions be compared with the following phrases from  various revelations: \"Behold this is _mine_ authority and the  authority of my servants\" (Doc. and Cov. sec. 1: 6); \"They have  strayed from _mine_ ordinances\" (v. 15); \"that _mine_ everlasting  covenant be established,\" etc., (v. 22); \"shall all be fulfilled,  whether by _mine_ own voice or the voice of my servants\" (v. 38); \"it  is meet unto you to know even as _mine_ apostles\" (sec. 19:8); \"ye  are called to bring to pass the gathering of _mine_ elect for _mine_  elect hear my voice\" (sec. 29: 7); \"it hath gone forth * * * that  _mine_ apostles, the Twelve,\" etc. (v. 12); \"it is the workmanship  of _mine_ hand\" (v. 25); \"Michael, _mine_ archangel, shall sound his  trump\" (v. 26); \"through faith on the name of _mine_ Only Begotten  Son\" (v. 42); \"from the foundation of the world through _mine_ Only  Begotten\" (v. 46); \"according to _mine_ own pleasure\" (v. 48). And so  on throughout the revelations this phrase occurs. It is used eight  times in the revelation on marriage and runs through nearly all the  revelations sometimes fewer, sometimes more than this. In section 101  it occurs eleven times, in section 103 six times. But it is always used  sufficiently to make it a characteristic of the revelations received by  Joseph Smith.    (2) The phrase \"as touching,\" is used several times in this revelation  on marriage; \"as touching the principle and doctrine,\" etc., (v. 1);  \"will answer thee as touching this matter\" (v. 2); \"and as touching  Abraham and his seed\" (v. 30); \"as touching the law of the priesthood,\"  etc., (v. 5). The same expression is found in Sec. 42--\"As ye * * * are  agreed as touching this one thing\" (v. 3). Also in the Book of Mormon:  \"He spake as touching all things concerning my people.\"    (3) Such phrases as \"I am the Lord thy God, and will answer thee,\"  etc., are frequent in this revelation. The above is in verse 2; then  again, \"I am the Lord thy God, and will give unto thee the law,\" etc.,  (v. 28); \"I am the Lord thy God, and I gave unto thee an appointment\"  (v. 40); the same in verse 57; indeed it comes in almost as a refrain  {XXXIX} of poetic emphasis at about equal distances throughout the  revelation, giving them in places almost rhythmic effect. This will be  found characteristic of several other revelations, notably section 1:  The Lord speaking of His servants says: \"I, the Lord, have commanded  them\" (v. 5); \"Wherefore I, the Lord, knowing the calamity which should  come,\" etc., (v. 17); \"for, I, the Lord, cannot look upon sin,\" etc.,  (v. 31.)    So also in slightly different form the peculiarity will be found in  section 12: \"Behold, I am God and give heed,\" etc., (v. 2); \"behold,  I speak unto you,\" etc., (v. 7); \"behold, I am the light and life of  the world,\" etc., (v. 9). Also in section 29: \"Thus did I the Lord God  appoint unto man\" (v. 43); \"wherefore I, the Lord God, will send forth  flies\" (v. 18); \"wherefore I, the Lord God, caused that he should be  cast out,\" (v. 41); \"and thus did I, the Lord God, appoint unto man  the days,\" etc., (v. 43). Again in section 50: \"Behold, I, the Lord,  have looked upon you\" (v. 4); \"wherefore I, the Lord, ask you this  question\" (v. 13). Also section 52; \"Behold, thus saith the Lord unto  the Elders,\" etc., (v. 1); \"I, the Lord, will make known unto you\" (v.  2); \"behold I, the Lord, will hasten the city,\" etc., (v. 43.)    The peculiar use of \"none other,\" in place of \"no other,\" and of  \"none\" instead of \"no one,\" is an expression both in the revelation  on marriage and a number of other revelations about which there is no  question of the authorship being Joseph Smith's. In the revelation on  marriage we have this: \"Abraham * * * abode in my law, as Isaac also,  and Jacob did _none other_ things than that which they were commanded;  and because they did _none other_ things than that which they were  commanded, they have entered into their exaltation\" (v. 37). In section  43 we have the same phrase: \"There is _none other_ appointed unto you,\"  etc., (v. 3); \"I say unto you that _none else_ shall be appointed unto  this gift\" (v. 4); also in Section 61, the following: \"It shall be said  in days to come that _none_ is able to go up to the land\" (v. 16);  also Section 82, \"and _none_ doeth good, for all have gone out of the  way (v. 6); and they * * * shall find _none_ inheritance in that day,\"  etc., (Sec. 85:9).    The use of the"]]]
