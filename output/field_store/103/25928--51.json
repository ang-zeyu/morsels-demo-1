He  selected three, who it is needless to say had no superiors in the whole  party. The little company then turned the heads of their horses toward  Laramie River.    At that day, the section abounded with beaver, and although the summer  is not the time when their fur is in the best condition, the party  trapped on the stream and its tributaries until cold weather set in.  They met with far greater success than could have come to them had they  stayed with the principal company of trappers. But they had no wish  to spend the winter alone in the mountains and gathering their stock  together, they set out to rejoin their old companions.    One day, after they had gone into camp, Carson, leaving his horse in  charge of his friends, set out on foot to hunt some game for their  evening meal. They had seen no signs of Indians, though they never  forgot to be on their guard against them. Game was not very abundant and  Carson was obliged to go a long ways before he caught sight of some elk  grazing on the side of a hill. Well aware of the difficulty of getting  within gunshot of the timid animals, the hunter advanced by a circuitous  course toward a clump of trees, which would give him the needed shelter;  but while creeping toward the point he had fixed upon as the one from  which to fire, the creatures scented danger and began moving off. This  compelled him to fire at long range, but he was successful and brought  down the finest of the group.    The smoke was curling upward from the rifle of Carson, when he was  startled by a tremendous crashing beside him, and, turning his head, he  saw two enormous grizzly bears making for him at full speed. They were  infuriated at this invasion of their home, and were evidently resolved  on teaching the hunter better manners by making their supper upon him.    Carson had no time to reload his gun: had it been given him he would  have made short work of one of the brutes at least, but as it was, he  was deprived of even that privilege. Fortunate indeed would he be if he  could escape their fury.    The grizzly bear is the most dreaded animal found on this continent.  He does not seem to feel the slightest fear of the hunter, no matter  whether armed or not, and, while other beasts are disposed to give man  a wide berth, old \"Ephraim,\" as the frontiersmen call him, always seems  eager to attack him. His tenacity of life is extraordinary. Unless  pierced in the head or heart, he will continue his struggles after a  dozen or score of rifle balls have been buried in his body. So terrible  is the grizzly bear, that an Indian can be given no higher honor  than the privilege of wearing a necklace made from his claws--that  distinction being permitted only to those who have slain one of the  animals in single handed combat.    No one understood the nature of these beasts better than Kit Carson and  he knew that if either of the animals once got his claws upon him, there  would not be the faintest chance of escape. The only thing therefore  that could be done was to run.    There were not wanting men who were fleeter of foot than Carson, but  few could have overtaken him when he made for the trees on which all his  hopes depended. Like the blockade runner, closely pursued by the man of  war, he threw overboard all the cargo that could impede his speed. His  long, heavy rifle was flung aside, and the short legs of the trapper  doubled under him with amazing quickness as he strove as never before to  reach the grove.    Fortunately the latter was not far off, and, though the fierce beasts  gained rapidly upon him, Carson arrived among the timber a few steps  in advance. He had no time even to select the tree, else he would  have chosen a different one, but making a flying leap, he grasped the  lowermost limb and swung upward, at the moment the foremost grizzly  was beneath him. So close in truth was his pursuer that the hunter  distinctly felt the sweeping blow of his paw aimed at the leg which  whisked beyond his reach just in the nick of time.    But the danger was not over by any means. The enthusiastic style in  which the bears entered into the proceedings proved they did not mean  that any trifles should stop them. They were able to climb the tree  which supported Carson, and he did not lose sight of the fact. Whipping  out his hunting knife, he hurriedly cut off a short thick branch and  trimmed it into a shape that would have made a most excellent shillelagh  for a native of the Green Isle.    He had hardly done so, when the heads of the bruins were thrust upward  almost against his feet. Carson grasped the club with both hands and  raising it above his shoulders brought it down with all his might upon  the nose of the foremost. The brute sniffed with pain, threw up his  head and drew back a few inches--just enough to place the other nose in  front. At that instant, a resounding whack landed on the rubber snout  and the second bear must have felt a twinge all through his body.    Though each blow caused the recipient to recoil, yet he instantly  returned, so that Carson was kept busy pounding the noses as if he was  an old fashioned farmer threshing wheat with a flail.    It was a question with Carson which would last the longer--the club or  the snouts, but in the hope of getting beyond their reach, he climbed to  the topmost bough, where he crouched into the smallest possible space.  It was idle, however, to hope they would overlook him, for they pushed  on up the tree which swayed with their weight.    The nose of the grizzly bear is one of the most sensitive portions of  his body, and the vigorous thumps which the hunter brought down upon  them, brought tears of pain to their eyes. But while they suffered, they  were roused to fury by the repeated rebuffs, and seemed all the more  set on crunching the flesh and bones of the insignificant creature who  defied them.    It must have been exasperating beyond imagination to the gigantic  beasts, who feared neither man nor animal to find themselves repeatedly  baffled by a miserable being whom they could rend to pieces with one  blow of their paws, provided they could approach nigh enough to reach  him.    They came up again and again; they would draw back so as to avoid those  stinging strokes, sniff, growl and push upward, more eager than ever to  clutch the poor fellow, who was compressing himself between the limb and  the trunk, and raining his blows with the persistency of a pugilist.    They were finally forced to desist for a few minutes in order to give  their snouts time to regain their tone. The bulky creatures looked at  each other and seemed to say, \"That's a mighty queer customer up there;  he doesn't fight fairly, but we'll fetch him yet.\"    Once more and for the last time, they returned to the charge, but the  plucky scout was awaiting them, and his club whizzed through the air  like the piston rod of a steam engine. The grizzlies found it more than  they could stand, and tumbling back to solid earth they gave up the  contract in disgust. Carson tarried where he was until they were beyond  sight, when he descended and hastily caught up and reloaded his rifle,  having escaped, as he always declared, by the narrowest chance of all  his life.        CHAPTER XI.       On the Green River--In the Blackfoot Country--The Blackfeet--An   Unwelcome Visit--The Pursuit and Parley--Dissolution of the Peace   Congress.    The day was drawing to a close when Carson set out for camp, which was  not reached until after dark. His companions did not feel any special  alarm over his continued absence, for the good reason that they were  confident he could take care of himself no matter in what labyrinth of  peril he might become involved.    It was too late to send for the carcass of the elk and more than likely  it had already been devoured by wolves. So the trappers made their  breakfast on one of the beavers found in their traps, and went into  camp to await the arrival of the main body of trappers, which Carson  was confident would come that way. Some days later they put in an  appearance, and the company proceeded to the general rendezvous on Green  River, where were found assembled the principal trappers of the Rocky  Mountains. There were fully two hundred divided into two camps. What a  history could have been written from the thrilling experiences of such a  body of men!    They had gathered at the rendezvous to buy what supplies they needed  and to dispose of their peltries. It was several weeks before the  negotiations were over, when the assemblage broke up into smaller  companies which started for their destinations hundreds of miles apart.    Carson joined a party numbering about fifty who intended to trap near  the headwaters of the Missouri. Hundreds of beavers had been taken in  that section, but poor success went with the large band of which Carson  was a member. That was bad enough, but they were in a neighborhood  which, it may be said, was the very heart of the Blackfoot country,  and those hostiles were never more active and vigilant in their warfare  against the invaders.    The Blackfeet or Satsika today, are the most westerly tribe of the  Algonquin family of Indians, extending from the Hudson Bay to the  Missouri and Yellowstone. They number over 12,000 warriors about equally  divided between Montana and British America. They have always been  a daring and warlike people, and the early explorers of the Far West  probably met with more trouble from them than from any other tribe on  the continent.    Carson and his companions ran in difficulty at once. The Blackfeet  seemed to swarm through the woods, and sent in their treacherous shots  from the most unexpected quarters. Whoever made the round of the traps  in the morning was almost certain to be fired upon. Matters became  so bad that after a time the trappers decided to leave the country.  Accordingly they made their "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7885"],[0,"Celtic Fairy Tales (#9)"],[1,"to Donald's door. Donald had  finished making the last pile of ten gold pieces. And he couldn't  finish because a piece had stuck to the scales.    In they walked without an \"If you please\" or \"By your leave.\"    \"Well, _I_ never!\" that was all _they_ could say.    \"Good-evening, Hudden; good-evening, Dudden. Ah! you thought you had  played me a fine trick, but you never did me a better turn in all your  lives. When I found poor Daisy dead, I thought to myself, 'Well, her  hide may fetch something;' and it did. Hides are worth their weight in  gold in the market just now.\"    Hudden nudged Dudden, and Dudden winked at Hudden.    \"Good-evening, Donald O'Neary.\"    \"Good-evening, kind friends.\"    The next day there wasn't a cow or a calf that belonged to Hudden or  Dudden but her hide was going to the fair in Hudden's biggest cart  drawn by Dudden's strongest pair of horses.    When they came to the fair, each one took a hide over his arm, and  there they were walking through the fair, bawling out at the top of  their voices: \"Hides to sell! hides to sell!\"    Out came the tanner:    \"How much for your hides, my good men?\"    \"Their weight in gold.\"    \"It's early in the day to come out of the tavern.\"    That was all the tanner said, and back he went to his yard.    \"Hides to sell! Fine fresh hides to sell!\"    Out came the cobbler.    \"How much for your hides, my men?\"    \"Their weight in gold.\"    \"Is it making game of me you are! Take that for your pains,\" and the  cobbler dealt Hudden a blow that made him stagger.    Up the people came running from one end of the fair to the other.  \"What's the matter? What's the matter?\" cried they.    \"Here are a couple of vagabonds selling hides at their weight in gold,\"  said the cobbler.    \"Hold 'em fast; hold 'em fast!\" bawled the innkeeper, who was the last  to come up, he was so fat. \"I'll wager it's one of the rogues who  tricked me out of thirty gold pieces yesterday for a wretched hide.\"    It was more kicks than halfpence that Hudden and Dudden got before they  were well on their way home again, and they didn't run the slower  because all the dogs of the town were at their heels.    Well, as you may fancy, if they loved Donald little before, they loved  him less now.    \"What's the matter, friends?\" said he, as he saw them tearing along,  their hats knocked in, and their coats torn off, and their faces black  and blue. \"Is it fighting you've been? or mayhap you met the police,  ill luck to them?\"    \"We'll police you, you vagabond. It's mighty smart you thought  yourself, deluding us with your lying tales.\"    \"Who deluded you? Didn't you see the gold with your own two eyes?\"    But it was no use talking. Pay for it he must, and should. There was a  meal-sack handy, and into it Hudden and Dudden popped Donald O'Neary,  tied him up tight, ran a pole through the knot, and off they started  for the Brown Lake of the Bog, each with a pole-end on his shoulder,  and Donald O'Neary between.    But the Brown Lake was far, the road was dusty, Hudden and Dudden were  sore and weary, and parched with thirst. There was an inn by the  roadside.    \"Let's go in,\" said Hudden; \"I'm dead beat. It's heavy he is for the  little he had to eat.\"    If Hudden was willing, so was Dudden. As for Donald, you may be sure  his leave wasn't asked, but he was lumped down at the inn door for all  the world as if he had been a sack of potatoes.    \"Sit still, you vagabond,\" said Dudden; \"if we don't mind waiting, you  needn't.\"    Donald held his peace, but after a while he heard the glasses clink,  and Hudden singing away at the top of his voice.    \"I won't have her, I tell you; I won't have her!\" said Donald. But  nobody heeded what he said.    \"I won't have her, I tell you; I won't have her!\" said Donald, and this  time he said it louder; but nobody heeded what he said.    \"I won't have her, I tell you; I won't have her!\" said Donald; and this  time he said it as loud as he could.    \"And who won't you have, may I be so bold as to ask?\" said a farmer,  who had just come up with a drove of cattle, and was turning in for a  glass.    \"It's the king's daughter. They are bothering the life out of me to  marry her.\"    \"You're the lucky fellow. I'd give something to be in your shoes.\"    \"Do you see that now! Wouldn't it be a fine thing for a farmer to be  marrying a princess, all dressed in gold and jewels?\"    \"Jewels, do you say? Ah, now, couldn't you take me with you?\"    \"Well, you're an honest fellow, and as I don't care for the king's  daughter, though she's as beautiful as the day, and is covered with  jewels from top to toe, you shall have her. Just undo the cord, and let  me out; they tied me up tight, as they knew I'd run away from her.\"    Out crawled Donald; in crept the farmer.    \"Now lie still, and don't mind the shaking; it's only rumbling over the  palace steps you'll be. And maybe they'll abuse you for a vagabond, who  won't have the king's daughter; but you needn't mind that. Ah! it's a  deal I'm giving up for you, sure as it is that I don't care for the  princess.\"    \"Take my cattle in exchange,\" said the farmer; and you may guess it  wasn't long before Donald was at their tails driving them homewards.    Out came Hudden and Dudden, and the one took one end of the pole, and  the other the other.    \"I'm thinking he's heavier,\" said Hudden.    \"Ah, never mind,\" said Dudden; \"it's only a step now to the Brown Lake.\"    \"I'll have her now! I'll have her now!\" bawled the farmer, from inside  the sack.    \"By my faith, and you shall though,\" said Hudden, and he laid his stick  across the sack.    \"I'll have her! I'll have her!\" bawled the farmer, louder than ever.    \"Well, here you are,\" said Dudden, for they were now come to the Brown  Lake, and, unslinging the sack, they pitched it plump into the lake.    \"You'll not be playing your tricks on us any longer,\" said Hudden.    \"True for you,\" said Dudden. \"Ah, Donald, my boy, it was an ill day  when you borrowed my scales.\"    Off they went, with a light step and an easy heart, but when they were  near home, who should they see but Donald O'Neary, and all around him  the cows were grazing, and the calves were kicking up their heels and  butting their heads together.    \"Is it you, Donald?\" said Dudden. \"Faith, you've been quicker than we  have.\"    \"True for you, Dudden, and let me thank you kindly; the turn was good,  if the will was ill. You'll have heard, like me, that the Brown Lake  leads to the Land of Promise. I always put it down as lies, but it is  just as true as my word. Look at the cattle.\"    Hudden stared, and Dudden gaped; but they couldn't get over the cattle;  fine fat cattle they were too.    \"It's only the worst I could bring up with me,\" said Donald O'Neary;  \"the others were so fat, there was no driving them. Faith, too, it's  little wonder they didn't care to leave, with grass as far as you could  see, and as sweet and juicy as fresh butter.\"    \"Ah, now, Donald, we haven't always been friends,\" said Dudden, \"but,  as I was just saying, you were ever a decent lad, and you'll show us  the way, won't you?\"    \"I don't see that I'm called upon to do that; there is a power more  cattle down there. Why shouldn't I have them all to myself?\"    \"Faith, they may well say, the richer you get, the harder the heart.  You always were a neighbourly lad, Donald. You wouldn't wish to keep  the luck all to yourself?\"    \"True for you, Hudden, though 'tis a bad example you set me. But I'll  not be thinking of old times. There is plenty for all there, so come  along with me.\"    Off they trudged, with a light heart and an eager step. When they came  to the Brown Lake, the sky was full of little white clouds, and, if the  sky was full, the lake was as full.    \"Ah! now, look, there they are,\" cried Donald, as he pointed to the  clouds in the lake.    \"Where? where?\" cried Hudden, and \"Don't be greedy!\" cried Dudden, as  he jumped his hardest to be up first with the fat cattle. But if he  jumped first, Hudden wasn't long behind.    They never came back. Maybe they got too fat, like the cattle. As for  Donald O'Neary, he had cattle and sheep all his days to his heart's  content.        THE SHEPHERD OF MYDDVAI    Up in the Black Mountains in Caermarthenshire lies the lake known as  Lyn y Van Vach. To the margin of this lake the shepherd of Myddvai once  led his lambs, and lay there whilst they sought pasture. Suddenly, from  the dark waters of the lake, he saw three maidens rise. Shaking the  bright drops from their hair and gliding to the shore, they wandered  about amongst his flock. They had more than mortal beauty, and he was  filled with love for her that came nearest to him. He offered her the  bread he had with him, and she took it and tried it, but then sang to  him:      Hard-baked is thy bread,    'Tis not easy to catch me,    and then ran off laughing to the lake.    Next day he took with him bread not so well done, and watched for the  maidens. When they came ashore he offered his bread as before, and the  maiden tasted it and sang:      Unbaked is thy bread,    I will not have thee,    and again disappeared in the waves.    A third time did the shepherd of Myddvai try to attract the maiden, and  this time he offered her bread that he had found floating about near  the shore. This pleased her, and she promised to become his wife if he  were able to pick her out from among her sisters on the following day.  When the time came the shepherd knew his love by the strap of her  sandal. Then she told him she would be as good a wife to him as any  earthly maiden could be unless he should strike her three times without  cause. Of course he deemed that this could never be; and she, summoning  from the lake three cows, two oxen, and a bull, as her marriage  portion, was led homeward by him as his bride.    The years passed happily, and three children were born to the shepherd  and the lake-maiden. But one day here"]]]
