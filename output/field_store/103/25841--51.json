A moment or two later the bolts and bars of the front door were  unfastened, a key grated in the rusty lock, a chain rattled in its  socket, and then the door was opened slowly and cautiously.    The woman Leridan appeared in the doorway. She held a guttering tallow  candle high above her head. Its flickering light illumined Chauvelin's  slender figure.    \"Ah! the citizen Representative!\" the woman ejaculated, as soon as she  recognised him. \"We did not expect you again to-day, and at this late  hour, too. I'll tell my man--\"    \"Never mind your man,\" broke in Chauvelin impatiently, and pushed  without ceremony past the woman inside the house. \"The child? Is it  safe?\"    He could scarcely control his excitement. There was a buzzing, as of an  angry sea, in his ears. The next second, until the woman spoke, seemed  like a cycle of years.    \"Quite safe, citizen,\" she said placidly. \"Everything is quite safe. We  were so thankful for those men of the Surete. We had been afraid before,  as I told the citizen Representative, and my man and I could not rest  for anxiety. It was only after they came that we dared go to bed.\"    A deep sigh of intense relief came from the depths of Chauvelin's heart.  He had not realised himself until this moment how desperately anxious he  had been. The woman's reassuring words appeared to lift a crushing  weight from his mind. He turned to the man behind him.    \"You did not tell me,\" he said, \"that some of you had been here  already.\"    \"We have not been here before,\" the sergeant in charge of the little  platoon said in reply. \"I do not know what the woman means.\"    \"Some of your men came about three hours ago,\" the woman retorted; \"less  than an hour after the citizen Representative was here. I remember that  my man and I marvelled how quickly they did come, but they said that  they had been on duty at the Barriere du Combat when the citizen  arrived, and that he had dispatched them off at once. They said they had  run all the way. But even so, we thought it was quick work--\"    The words were smothered in her throat in a cry of pain, for, with an  almost brutal gesture, Chauvelin had seized her by the shoulders.    \"Where are those men?\" he queried hoarsely. \"Answer!\"    \"In there, and in there,\" the woman stammered, well-nigh faint with  terror as she pointed to two doors, one on each side of the passage.  \"Three in each room. They are asleep now, I should say, as they seem so  quiet. But they were an immense comfort to us, citizen ... we were so  thankful to have them in the house....\"    But Chauvelin had snatched the candle from her hand. Holding it high  above his head, he strode to the door on the right of the passage. It  was ajar. He pushed it open with a vicious kick. The room beyond was in  total darkness.    \"Is anyone here?\" he queried sharply.    Nothing but silence answered him. For a moment he remained there on the  threshold, silent and immovable as a figure carved in stone. He had just  a sufficiency of presence of mind and of will power not to drop the  candle, to stand there motionless, with his back turned to the woman and  to the men who had crowded in, in his wake. He would not let them see  the despair, the rage and grave superstitious fear, which distorted  every line of his pallid face.    He did not ask about the child. He would not trust himself to speak, for  he had realised already how completely he had been baffled. Those  abominable English spies had watched their opportunity, had worked on  the credulity and the fears of the Leridans and, playing the game at  which they and their audacious chief were such unconquerable experts,  they had made their way into the house under a clever ruse.    The men of the Surete, not quite understanding the situation, were  questioning the Leridans. The man, too, corroborated his wife's story.  Their anxiety had been worked upon at the moment that it was most acute.  After the citizen Representative left them, earlier in the evening, they  had received another mysterious message which they had been unable to  read, but which had greatly increased their alarm. Then, when the men of  the Surete came.... Ah! they had no cause to doubt that they were men of  the Surete!... their clothes, their speech, their appearance ... figure  to yourself, even their uniforms! They spoke so nicely, so reassuringly.  The Leridans were so thankful to see them! Then they made themselves  happy in the two rooms below, and for additional safety the Lannoy child  was brought down from its attic and put to sleep in the one room with  the men of the Surete.    After that the Leridans went to bed. Name of a dog! how were they to  blame? Those men and the child had disappeared, but they (the Leridans)  would go to the guillotine swearing that they were not to blame.    Whether Chauvelin heard all these jeremiads, he could not afterwards  have told you. But he did not need to be told how it had all been done.  It had all been so simple, so ingenious, so like the methods usually  adopted by that astute Scarlet Pimpernel! He saw it all so clearly  before him. Nobody was to blame really, save he himself--he, who alone  knew and understood the adversary with whom he had to deal.    But these people here should not have the gratuitous spectacle of a man  enduring the torments of disappointment and of baffled revenge. Whatever  Chauvelin was suffering now would for ever remain the secret of his own  soul. Anon, when the Leridans' rasping voices died away in one of the  more distant portions of the house and the men of the Surete were busy  accepting refreshment and gratuity from the two terrified wretches, he  had put down the candle with a steady hand and then walked with a firm  step out of the house.    Soon the slender figure was swallowed up in the gloom as he strode back  rapidly towards the city.    XII    Citizen Fouquier-Tinville had returned home from the Palais at a very  late hour that same evening. His household in his simple lodgings in the  Place Dauphine was already abed: his wife and the twins were asleep. He  himself had sat down for a moment in the living-room, in dressing-gown  and slippers, and with the late edition of the Moniteur in his hand, too  tired to read.    It was half-past ten when there came a ring at the front door bell.  Fouquier-Tinville, half expecting citizen Chauvelin to pay him a final  visit, shuffled to the door and opened it.    A visitor, tall, well-dressed, exceedingly polite and urbane, requested  a few minutes' conversation with citizen Fouquier-Tinville.    Before the Public Prosecutor had made up his mind whether to introduce  such a late-comer into his rooms, the latter had pushed his way through  the door into the ante-chamber, and with a movement as swift as it was  unexpected, had thrown a scarf round Fouquier-Tinville's neck and wound  it round his mouth, so that the unfortunate man's call for help was  smothered in his throat.    So dexterously and so rapidly indeed had the miscreant acted, that his  victim had hardly realised the assault before he found himself securely  gagged and bound to a chair in his own ante-room, whilst that dare-devil  stood before him, perfectly at his ease, his hands buried in the  capacious pockets of his huge caped coat, and murmuring a few casual  words of apology.    \"I entreat you to forgive, citizen,\" he was saying in an even and  pleasant voice, \"this necessary violence on my part towards you. But my  errand is urgent, and I could not allow your neighbours or your  household to disturb the few minutes' conversation which I am obliged to  have with you. My friend Paul Mole,\" he went on, after a slight pause,  \"is in grave danger of his life owing to a hallucination on the part of  our mutual friend citizen Chauvelin; and I feel confident that you  yourself are too deeply enamoured of your own neck to risk it wilfully  by sending an innocent and honest patriot to the guillotine.\"    Once more he paused and looked down upon his unwilling interlocutor,  who, with muscles straining against the cords that held him, and with  eyes nearly starting out of their sockets in an access of fear and of  rage, was indeed presenting a pitiful spectacle.    \"I dare say that by now, citizen,\" the brigand continued imperturbably,  \"you will have guessed who I am. You and I have oft crossed invisible  swords before; but this, methinks, is the first time that we have met  face to face. I pray you, tell my dear friend M. Chauvelin that you have  seen me. Also that there were two facts which he left entirely out of  his calculations, perfect though these were. The one fact was that there  were two Paul Moles--one real and one factitious. Tell him that, I pray  you. It was the factitious Paul Mole who stole the ring and who stood  for one moment gazing into clever citizen Chauvelin's eyes. But that  same factitious Paul Mole had disappeared in the crowd even before your  colleague had recovered his presence of mind. Tell him, I pray you, that  the elusive Pimpernel whom he knows so well never assumes a fanciful  disguise. He discovered the real Paul Mole first, studied him, learned  his personality, until his own became a perfect replica of the miserable  caitiff. It was the false Paul Mole who induced Jeannette Marechal to  introduce him originally into the household of citizen Marat. It was he  who gained the confidence of his employer; he, for a consideration,  borrowed the identity papers of his real prototype. He again who for a  few francs induced the real Paul Mole to follow him into the house of  the murdered demagogue and to mingle there with the throng. He who  thrust the identity papers back into the hands of their rightful owner  whilst he himself was swallowed up by the crowd.

When they find 'em in that are  pickle, they go and get ropes, and tie 'em tight round  their necks, and half hang 'em to make 'em float, and  then haul 'em out. Awful looking critters they be, you  may depend, when they do come out; for all the world like  half drowned kittens--all slinkey--slimey--with their  great long tails glued up like a swab of oakum dipped in  tar. If they don't look foolish its a pity? Well, they  have to nurse these critters all winter, with hot mashes,  warm covering, and what not, and when spring comes, they  mostly die, and if they don't they are never no good  arter. I wish with all my heart half the horses in the  country were barrelled up in these here 'honey pots,'  and then there'd be near about one half too many left  for profit. Jist look at one of these barn yards in the  spring--half a dozen half starved colts, with their hair  lookin a thousand ways for Sunday, and their coats hangin  in tatters, and half a dozen good for nothin old horses,  a crowdin out the cows and sheep.    Can you wonder that people who keep such an unprofitable  stock, come out of the small eend of the horn in the long  run?          No. X    The Road to a Woman's Heart--The Broken Heart.    As we approached the Inn at Amherst, the Clockmaker grew  uneasy. Its pretty well on in the evening, I guess, said  he, and Marm Pugwash is as onsartain in her temper as a  mornin in April; its all sunshine or all clouds with her,  and if she's in one of her tantrums, she'll stretch out  her neck and hiss, like a goose with a flock of goslins.  I wonder what on airth Pugwash was a thinkin on, when he  signed articles of partnership with that are woman; she's  not a bad lookin piece of furniture neither, and its a  proper pity sich a clever woman should carry such a stiff  upper lip--she reminds me of our old minister Joshua  Hopewell's apple trees. The old minister had an orchard  of most particular good fruit, for he was a great hand  at buddin, graftin, and what not, and the orchard (it  was on the south side of the house) stretched right up  to the road. Well, there were some trees hung over the  fence, I never seed such bearers, the apples hung in  ropes, for all the world like strings of onions, and the  fruit was beautiful. Nobody touched the minister's  apples, and when other folks lost theirn from the boys,  hisn always hung there like bait to a hook, but there  never was so much as a nibble at em. So I said to him  one day, Minister, said I, how on airth do you manage to  keep your fruit that's so exposed, when no one else cant  do it nohow. Why, says he, they are dreadful pretty  fruit, ant they? I guess, said I, there ant the like on  em in all Connecticut. Well, says he, I'll tell you the  secret, but you need'nt let on to no one about it. That  are row next the fence, I grafted it myself, I took great  pains to get the right kind, I sent clean up to Roxberry,  and away down to Squaw-neck Creek, (I was afeared he was  agoin to give me day and date for every graft, being a  terrible long-winded man in his stories,) so says I, I  know that, minister, but how do you preserve them? Why  I was a goin to tell you, said he, when you stopped me.  That are outward row I grafted myself with the choicest  kind I could find, and I succeeded. They are beautiful,  but so etarnal sour, no human soul can eat them. Well,  the boys think the old minister's graftin has all succeeded  about as well as that row, and they sarch no farther.  They snicker at my graftin, and I laugh in my sleeve, I  guess, at their penetration.    Now, Marm Pugwash is like the Minister's apples, very  temptin fruit to look at, but desperate sour. If Pugwash  had a watery mouth when be married, I guess its pretty  puckery by this time. However, if she goes to act ugly,  I'll give her a dose of 'soft sawder,' that will take  the frown out of her frontispiece, and make her dial-plate  as smooth as a lick of copal varnish. Its a pity she's  such a kickin devil, too, for she has good points--good  eye--good foot--neat pastern--fine chest--a clean set  of limbs, and carries a good ---. But here we are, now  you'll see what' soft sawder' will do. When we entered  the house, the traveller's room was all in darkness, and  on opening the opposite door into the sitting room, we  found the female part of the family extinguishing the  fire for the night. Mrs. Pugwash had a broom in her hand,  and was in the act (the last act of female housewifery)  of sweeping the hearth. The strong flickering light of  the fire, as it fell upon her tall fine figure and  beautiful face, revealed a creature worthy of the  Clockmaker's comments. Good evening, Marm, said Mr. Slick,  how do you do, and how's Mr. Pugwash? He, said she, why  he's been abed this hour, you don't expect to disturb--him  this time of night I hope. Oh no, said Mr. Stick, certainly  not, and I am sorry to have disturbed you, but we got  detained longer than we expected; I am sorry that --. So  am I, said she, but if Mr. Pugwash will keep an Inn when  he has no occasion to, his family cant expect no rest.  Here the Clockmaker, seeing the storm gathering, stooped  down suddenly, and staring intently, held out his hand  and exclaimed, well if that aint a beautiful child--come  here, my little man and shake hands along with me--well  I declare if that are little feller aint the finest child  I ever seed--what, not abed yet? ah you rogue, where did  you get them are pretty rosy cheeks; stole them from  mamma, eh? Well, I wish my old mother could see that  child, it is such a treat In our country, said he, turning  to me, the children are all as pale as chalk, or as yeller  as an orange. Lord, that are little feller would be a  show in our country--come to me my man. Here the soft  sawder began to operate. Mrs. Pugwash said in a milder  tone than we had yet heard, 'go my dear to the gentleman,  go dear.' Mr. Slick kissed him, asked him if he would go  to the States along with him, told him all the little  girls there would fall in love with him, for they didn't  see such a beautiful face once in a month of Sundays.  Black eyes, let me see, ah mamma's eyes too, and black  hair also; as I am alive, why you are mamma's own boy,  the very image of mamma. Do be seated, gentlemen, said  Mrs. Pugwash--Sally make a fire in the next room. She  ought to be proud of you, he continued. Well, if I live  to return here, I must paint your face, and have it put  on my clocks, and our folks will buy the clocks for the  sake of the face. Did you ever see, said he, again  addressing me, such a likeness between one human and  another, as between this beautiful little boy and his  mother. I am sure you have had no supper, said Mrs.  Pugwash to me; you must be hungry and weary, too--I will  get you a cup of tea. I am sorry to give you so much  trouble, said I. Not the least trouble in the world,  she replied, on the contrary a pleasure. We were then  shown into the next room, where the fire was now blazing  up, but Mr. Slick protested he could not proceed without  the little boy, and lingered behind me to ascertain his  age, and concluded by asking the child if he had any  aunts that looked like mamma.    As the door closed, Mr. Slick said, it's a pity she don't  go well in gear. The difficulty with those critters is  to get them to start, arter that there is no trouble with  them if you don't check 'em too short If you do, they'll  stop again, run back and kick like mad, and then Old Nick  himself would'nt start 'em. Pugwash, I guess, don't  understand the natur of the critter; she'll never go kind  in harness for him. When I see a child, said the Clockmaker,  I always feel safe with these women folk; for I have  always found that the road to a woman's heart lies through  her child.    You seem, said I, to understand the female heart so well,  I make no doubt you are a general favorite among the fair  sex. Any man, he replied, that understands horses, has  a pretty considerable fair knowledge of women, for they  are jist alike in temper, and require the very identical  same treatment. Incourage the timid ones, be gentle and  steady with the fractious, but lather the sulky ones like  blazes. People talk an everlastin sight of nonsense about  wine, women and horses. I've bought and sold 'em all,  I've traded in all of them, and I tell you, there aint  one in a thousand that knows a grain about either on 'em.  You hear folks say, oh, such a man is an ugly grained  critter--he'll break his wife's heart; jist as if a  woman's heart was as brittle as a pipe stalk. The female  heart, as far as my experience goes, is just like a new  India Rubber Shoe; you may pull and pull at it, till it  stretches out a yard long, and then let go, and it will  fly right back to its old shape. Their hearts are made  of stout leather, I tell you; there's a plaguy sight of  wear in 'em, I never knowed but one case of a broken  heart, and that was in tother sex, one Washington Banks.  He was a sneezer. He was tall enough to spit down on the  heads of your grenadiers, and near about high enough to  wade across Charlestown River, and as strong as a tow  boat. I guess he was somewhat less than a foot longer  than the moral law and catechism too. He was a perfect  pictur of a man; you could'nt falt him in no particular;  be was so just a made critter; folks used to run to the  winder when he passed, and say there goes Washington  Banks, beant he lovely? I do believe there was'nt a gall  in the Lowell factories, that warnt in love with him.  Sometimes, at intermission, on Sabbath days, when they  all came out together, (an"]]]
