When he thought they had played enough,  Johnny Chuck would lead the way along a little private path which he had  made through the grass. After him, one behind another, would trot the  three little Chucks, and behind them would march Polly Chuck, to see  that none went astray.    When they reached the patch of tender, sweet, young clover, Johnny Chuck  would sit up very straight and still, watching as sharp as he knew how  for the least sign of danger. When the three little stomachs were full  of sweet, tender, young clover, he would proudly lead the way home  again, and then as before he would sit up very straight and watch for  danger, while the three baby Chucks sprawledout on the doorstep for a  sun-nap.    Oh, those were busy days for Johnny Chuck, and anxious days, too! You  see he had not forgotten that Sammy Jay had found out his secret, and he  hadn't the least doubt in the world that Sammy Jay would tell Reddy Fox.  So, from the first thing in the morning until the very last thing at  night, Johnny Chuck was on the watch for danger.    And all the time, though Johnny didn't know it, a pair of sharp  eyes were watching him from a snug hiding-place in one of the old  apple-trees. Whose were they? Why, Sammy Jay's, to be sure. You see,  Sammy Jay hadn't told Johnny Chuck's great secret, after all.          XXIII. THE SCHOOL IN THE OLD ORCHARD           Little Foxes, little Chucks,       Little Squirrels, Mice and Mink,       Just like little boys and girls,       Go to school to learn to think.    You didn't know that, did you? Well, it's a fact. Yes, Sir, it's a  fact. All the babies born in the Green Forest or on the Green Meadows  or around the Smiling Pool have to go to school just as soon as they are  big enough to leave their own doorsteps. They go to the greatest school  in the world, and it is called the School of Experience.    Old Mother Nature has charge of it, but the teachers usually are father  and mother for the first few weeks, anyway. After that Old Mother Nature  herself gives them a few lessons, and a very stern teacher she is. They  just HAVE to learn her lessons. If they don't, something dreadful is  almost sure to happen.    Of course Sammy Jay knew all this, because he had had to go to school  when he was a little fellow. So Sammy was not much surprised when, from  his snug hiding-place in one of the old apple-trees, he discovered that  there was a school in Farmer Brown's old orchard. Johnny Chuck was the  teacher and his three baby Chucks were the pupils. Sammy Jay was so  interested in that funny little school in the old orchard that he quite  forgot to think about mischief.    The very first lesson that the three little Chucks had to learn was  obedience. Johnny Chuck was very particular about that. You see he knew  that unless they learned this first of all, none of the other lessons  would do them much good. They must first learn to mind instantly,  without asking questions. Dear me, dear me, Johnny Chuck certainly did  have his hands full, teaching those three little Chucks to mind! They  were such lively little chaps, and there was so much that was new and  wonderful to see, that it was dreadfully hard work to sit perfectly  still, just because Johnny Chuck told them to. But if they didn't  mind instantly, they were sure to have their ears soundly boxed, and  sometimes were sent back to the house without a taste of the sweet,  tender, young clover of which they were so fond.    After a few lessons of this kind, they found out that it was always best  to obey instantly, and then Johnny began to teach them other things,  things which it is very important that every Chuck should know.    First, there were signals. When Johnny whistled a certain way, it meant  \"A stranger in sight; possible danger!\"    Then each little Chuck would sit up very straight and not move the  teeniest, weeniest bit, so that from a little distance they looked for  all the world like tiny stumps. But all the time their sharp little eyes  would be looking this way and that way, to see what the danger might  be. After a while Johnny would give another little whistle, which meant  \"Danger past.\" Then they would once more begin to fill their little  stomachs with sweet, tender, young clover.    Sometimes, however, Johnny would whistle sharply. That meant \"Run!\" Then  they would scamper as fast as they could along the nearest little path  to the house under the old apple-tree in the far corner, and never once  look around. They would dive head first, one after the other, in at the  doorway, and not show their noses outside again until Johnny or Polly  Chuck told them they could.    Then there was a still different whistle. It meant \"Danger very near;  lie low!\" When they heard that, they flattened themselves right down in  the grass just wherever they happened to be, and held their breath and  didn't move until Johnny signaled that they might. Of course, there  never was any real danger. Johnny was just teaching them, so that when  danger did come, as it surely would, sooner or later, they would know  just what to do.    It surely was a funny little school, and sometimes Sammy Jay had hard  work to keep from laughing right out.          XXIV. SAMMY JAY PROVES THAT HE IS NOT ALL BAD      Sammy Jay hadn't had so much fun for a long time as he found in watching  the funny little school in Farmer Brown's old orchard, where Johnny  Chuck was teaching his three baby Chucks the things that every little  Chuck must learn, if he would grow up into a big Chuck. When they had  learned to mind without waiting to ask why, and had learned the signals  which told them just what to do when danger was near, Johnny began to  lead them farther and farther away from home.    He took them up along the old stone wall and showed them how to find  safe hiding-places among the stones. Then he took them off a little way  and suddenly gave the danger signal. It was funny, very funny indeed to  see the three little Chucks scamper for the old stone wall and crawl out  of sight.    The first time, two of them tried to squeeze into the same hole  together, and each was in such a hurry that he wouldn't let the other  go first. Then both lost their tempers and they began to fight about it,  quite forgetting that if there was really any danger near, they surely  would come to harm. Such a scolding as Johnny Chuck did give those two  little Chucks! Then he made them try it all over again.    Once he found a foot print which Reddy Fox had made in some soft earth  during the night, and made each little Chuck smell of it, while he told  them all about Reddy and old Granny Fox and how smart and sly they were  and how very, very fond they were of tender young Chucks for dinner.    The three little Chucks shivered when they smelled of Reddy's track, and  the hair along their backs stood up in a way that was very funny to see.    Then Johnny Chuck took them over to the edge of the old orchard, where  they could peep out over the Green Meadows. He pointed out old Whitetail  the Marshhawk, sailing back and forth over the meadows, and told them  how once, when he was a little Chuck and had run away from home, old  Whitetail had nearly caught him. He told them about Farmer Brown's boy  and about Bowser the Hound and a great many other things that little  Chucks should learn about.    Now all the time that Johnny Chuck was teaching these things, he was  keeping the sharpest kind of a watch for danger, and there were many  times when he would give the danger signal. Then they would all lie flat  down in the grass and keep perfectly still, or else scamper as fast as  they could along the little paths which Johnny had made, to the safety  of the snug home under the old apple-tree. But even the most watchful  are surprised sometimes.    One morning, when Johnny Chuck had led the three little Chucks farther  from home than usual, Farmer Brown's boy took it into his head to visit  the old orchard. Johnny Chuck did not see him coming. You see, the  orchard grass had grown so tall that even when he sat up his very  straightest, Johnny could not always see over the top of it. So this  morning he failed to see Farmer Brown's boy coming.    But Sammy Jay, sitting in his snug hiding-place in the top of one of  the old apple-trees, saw him. At first Sammy Jay's sharp eyes twinkled.  There would be some fun now! Perhaps Farmer Brown's boy would catch one  of the little Chucks! Sammy Jay could picture to himself the fright of  Johnny Chuck and the three little Chucks. He fairly hugged himself in  delight, for you know Sammy Jay dearly loves to see other people in  trouble.    Then he thought of all the fun he had had watching those three little  Chucks learn their lessons, and suddenly the thought of anything  happening to them made Sammy Jay feel uncomfortable. Almost without  stopping to think, he screamed at the top of his lungs:    \"Run, Johnny Chuck, run! Here comes Farmer Brown's boy!\"    And Johnny Chuck ran. He didn't wait to ask questions or even to look.  He started the three little Chucks ahead of him, and he nipped their  heels to make them run faster. And just in time they reached the snug  house under the old apple-tree in the far corner.    Farmer Brown's boy was just in time to see them disappear. He watched  Sammy Jay flying over to the Green Forest and screaming \"Thief! thief!\"  as he flew.    \"I wonder now if that jay warned those chucks purposely,\" said he, as he  scratched his head thoughtfully.    If Peter Rabbit had been there, he could have told him that Sammy Jay  did, for he knows all about Sammy Jay and his tricks. But Peter wasn't  there. The fact is, Peter was very busy doing the most foolish of all  the foolish things he has ever done--trying to change his name.

Principe is said to be the most  unhealthy, and the reason of the difference in this particular  between Principe and Anno Bom is said to arise from the fact that  the former is on the Guinea Current--a hot current--and Anno Bom on  the Equatorial, which averages 10 degree cooler than its neighbour.    The shores of San Thome are washed by both currents, and the  currents round Fernando Po are in a mixed and uncertain state.  It  is difficult, unless you have haunted these seas, to realise the  interest we take down there in currents; particularly when you are  navigating small sailing boats, a pursuit I indulge in necessarily  from my fishing practices.  Their effect on the climate too is very  marked.  If we could only arrange for some terrific affair to take  place in the bed of the Atlantic, that would send that precious  Guinea current to the place it evidently comes from, and get the  cool Equatorial alongside the mainland shore, West Africa would be  quite another place.    Fernando Po is the most important island as regards size on the West  African coast, and at the same time one of the most beautiful in the  world.  It is a great volcanic mass with many craters, and  culminates in the magnificent cone, Clarence Peak, called by the  Spaniards, Pico de Santa Isabel, by the natives of the island O  Wassa.  Seen from the sea or from the continent it looks like an  immense single mountain that has floated out to sea.  It is visible  during clear weather (and particularly sharply visible in the  strange clearness you get after a tornado) from a hundred miles to  seawards, and anything more perfect than Fernando Po when you sight  it, as you occasionally do from far-away Bonny Bar, in the sunset,  floating like a fairy island made of gold or of amethyst, I cannot  conceive.  It is almost equally lovely at close quarters, namely  from the mainland at Victoria, nineteen miles distant.  Its moods of  beauty are infinite; for the most part gentle and gorgeous, but I  have seen it silhouetted hard against tornado-clouds, and grandly  grim from the upper regions of its great brother Mungo.  And as for  Fernando Po in full moonlight--well there! you had better go and see  it yourself.    The whole island is, or rather I should say was, heavily forested  almost to its peak, with a grand and varied type of forest, very  rich in oil palms and tree-ferns, and having an undergrowth  containing an immense variety and quantity of ferns and mosses.  Sugar-cane also grows wild here, an uncommon thing in West Africa.  The last botanical collection of any importance made from these  forests was that of Herr Mann, and its examination showed that  Abyssinian genera and species predominated, and that many species  similar to those found in the mountains of Mauritius, the Isle de  Bourbon, and Madagascar, were present.  The number of European  plants (forty-three genera, twenty-seven species) is strikingly  large, most of the British forms being represented chiefly at the  higher elevations.  What was more striking was that it showed that  South African forms were extremely rare, and not one of the  characteristic types of St. Helena occurred.    Cocoa, coffee, and cinchona, alas! flourish in Fernando Po, as the  coffee suffers but little from the disease that harasses it on the  mainland at Victoria, and this is the cause of the great destruction  of the forest that is at present taking place.  San Thome, a few  years ago, was discovered by its surprised neighbours to be amassing  great wealth by growing coffee, and so Fernando Po and Principe  immediately started to amass great wealth too, and are now hard at  work with gangs of miscellaneous natives got from all parts of the  Coast save the Kru.  For to the Kruboy, \"Panier,\" as he calls  \"Spaniard,\" is a name of horror worse even than Portugee, although  he holds \"God made white man and God made black man, but dem debil  make Portugee,\" and he also remembers an unfortunate affair that  occurred some years ago now, in connection with coffee-growing.    A number of Krumen engaged themselves for a two years' term of  labour on the Island of San Thome, and when they arrived there, were  set to work on coffee plantations by the Portuguese.  Now  agricultural work is \"woman's palaver,\" but nevertheless the Krumen  made shift to get through with it, vowing the while no doubt, as  they hopefully notched away the moons on their tally-sticks, that  they would never let the girls at home know that they had been  hoeing.  But when their moons were all complete, instead of being  sent home with their pay to \"We country,\" they were put off from  time to time; and month after month went by and they were still on  San Thome, and still hoeing.  At last the home-sick men, in despair  of ever getting free, started off secretly in ones and twos to try  and get to \"We country\" across hundreds of miles of the storm-  haunted Atlantic in small canoes, and with next to no provisions.  The result was a tragedy, but it might easily have been worse; for a  few, a very few, were picked up alive by English vessels and taken  back to their beloved \"We country\" to tell the tale.  But many a  canoe was found with a dead Kruboy or so in it; and many a one  which, floating bottom upwards, graphically spoke of madness caused  by hunger, thirst, and despair having driven its occupants overboard  to the sharks.    My Portuguese friends assure me that there was never thought of  permanently detaining the boys, and that they were only just keeping  them until other labourers arrived to take their place on the  plantations.  I quite believe them, for I have seen too much of the  Portuguese in Africa to believe that they would, in a wholesale way,  be cruel to natives.  But I am not in the least surprised that the  poor Krumen took the Portuguese logo and amanha for Eternity itself,  for I have frequently done so.    The greatest length of the island lies N.E. and S.W., and amounts to  thirty-three miles; the mean breadth is seventeen miles.  The port,  Clarence Cove, now called Santa Isabel by the Spaniards--who have  been giving Spanish names to all the English-named places without  any one taking much notice of them--is a very remarkable place, and  except perhaps Gaboon the finest harbour on the West Coast.  The  point that brings Gaboon anchorage up in line with Clarence Cove is  its superior healthiness; for Clarence is a section of a circle, and  its shores are steep rocky cliffs from 100 to 200 feet high, and the  place, to put it very mildly, exceedingly hot and stuffy.  The cove  is evidently a partly submerged crater, the submerged rim of the  crater is almost a perfect semi-circle seawards--having on it 4, 5,  7, 8, and 10 fathoms of water save almost in the centre of the arc  where there is a passage with 12 to 14 fathoms.  Inside, in the  crater, there is deeper water, running in places from 30 to 45  fathoms, and outside the submerged rim there is deeper water again,  but rocky shoals abound.  On the top of the shore cliffs stands the  dilapidated little town of Clarence, on a plateau that falls away  slightly towards the mountain for about a mile, when the ground  commences to rise into the slopes of the Cordillera.  On the narrow  beach, tucked close against the cliffs, are a few stores belonging  to the merchants, where goods are placed on landing, and there is a  little pier too, but as it is usually having something done to its  head, or else is closed by the authorities because they intend doing  something by and by, the chances are against its being available for  use.  Hence it usually comes about that you have to land on the  beach, and when you have done this you make your way up a very steep  path, cut in the cliffside, to the town.  When you get there you  find yourself in the very dullest town I know on the Coast.  I  remember when I first landed in Clarence I found its society in a  flutter of expectation and alarm not untinged with horror.  Clarence, nay, the whole of Fernando Po, was about to become so  rackety and dissipated as to put Paris and Monte Carlo to the blush.  Clarence was going to have a cafe; and what was going to go on in  that cafe I shrink from reciting.    I have little hesitation now in saying this alarm was a false one.  When I next arrived in Clarence it was just as sound asleep and its  streets as weed-grown as ever, although the cafe was open.  My idea  is that the sleepiness of the place infected the cafe and took all  the go out of it.  But again it may have been that the inhabitants  were too well guarded against its evil influence, for there are on  the island fifty-two white laymen, and fifty-four priests to take  charge of them {44}--the extra two being, I presume, to look after  the Governor's conduct, although this worthy man made a most  spirited protest against this view when I suggested it to him; and  in addition to the priests there are several missionaries of the  Methodist mission, and also a white gentleman who has invented a new  religion.  Anyhow, the cafe smoulders like a damp squib.    When you spend the day on shore and when, having exhausted the  charms of the town,--a thing that usually takes from between ten  minutes to a quarter of an hour,--you apply to an inhabitant for  advice as to the disposal of the rest of your shore leave, you are  told to \"go and see the coals.\"  You say you have not come to  tropical islands to see a coal heap, and applying elsewhere for  advice you probably get the same.  So, as you were told to \"go and  see the coals\" when you left your ship, you do as you are bid.  These coals, the remnant of the store that was kept here for the  English men-of-war, were left here when the naval station was  removed.  The Spaniards at first thought of using them, and ran a  tram-way from Clarence to them.  But when the tramway was finished,  their activity had run"]]]
