Informed of his arrival, the Helvetii, who were  probably not yet all assembled, sent their men of noblest rank to demand  a passage through the country of the Allobroges, promising to commit no  injury there; they had, they said, no other road to quit their country.  Caesar was inclined to refuse their demand at once, but he called to mind  the defeat and death of the Consul L. Cassius; and wishing to obtain  time to collect the troops of which he had ordered the levy, he gave  them hopes of a favourable reply, and adjourned it to the Ides of April  (8th of April). By this delay he gained a fortnight; it was employed in  fortifying the left bank of the Rhone, between Lake Leman and the  Jura.[161] If we estimate at 5,000 men the legion which was in the  province, and at 5,000 or 6,000 the number of soldiers of the new  levies, we see that Caesar had at his disposal, to defend the banks of  the Rhone, about 10,000 or 11,000 infantry.[162]      [Sidenote: Description of the Retrenchment of the Rhone.]    III. The distance from Lake Leman to the Jura, following the  sinuosities of the river, is 291/2 kilometres, or 19,000 Roman paces  (_millia passuum decem novem_).[163] It is on the space comprised  between these two points that a retrenchment was raised which is called  in the \"Commentaries\" _murus fossaque_. This could not be a continuous  work, as the ground to be defended is intersected by rivers and ravines,  and the banks of the Rhone are almost everywhere so precipitous that it  would have been useless to fortify them. Caesar, pressed for time, can  only have made retrenchments on the weakest points of the line where the  passage of the river was easy; indeed, this is what Dio Cassius tells  us.[164] The labours of the Romans were only supplementary, on certain  points, to the formidable natural obstacles which the Rhone presents in  the greater part of its course. The only places where an attempt could  be made to pass it, because the heights there sink towards the banks of  the river into practicable declivities, are situated opposite the modern  villages of Russin, Cartigny, Avully, Chancy, and Cologny. In these  places they cut the upper part of the slope into a perpendicular, and  afterwards hollowed a trench, the scarp of which thus gained an  elevation of sixteen feet. These works, by uniting the escarpments of  the Rhone, formed, from Geneva to the Jura, a continuous line, which  presented an impassable barrier. Behind and along this line, at certain  distances, posts and closed redoubts rendered it impregnable. (_See  Plate 3._)[165]    This retrenchment, which required only from two to three days' labour,  was completed when the deputies returned, at the time appointed, to hear  Caesar's reply. He flatly refused the passage, declaring that he would  oppose it with all his means.    Meanwhile the Helvetii, and the people who took part in their  enterprise, had assembled on the right bank of the Rhone. When they  learnt that they must renounce the hope of quitting their country  without opposition, they resolved to open themselves a passage by  force. Several times--sometimes by day, and sometimes by night--they  crossed the Rhone, some by fording, others with the aid of boats joined  together, or of a great number of rafts of timber, and attempted to  carry the heights, but, arrested by the strength of the retrenchment  (_operis munitione_), and by the efforts and missiles of the soldiers  who hastened to the threatened points (_concursu et telis_), they  abandoned the attack.[166]      [Sidenote: The Helvetii begin their March towards the Saone. Caesar  unites his Troops.]    IV. The only road which now remained was that which lay across the  country of the Sequani (the Pas-de-l'Ecluse); but this narrow defile  could not be passed without the consent of its inhabitants. The Helvetii  charged the AEduan Dumnorix, the son-in-law of Orgetorix, to solicit it  for them. High in credit among the Sequani, Dumnorix obtained it; and  the two peoples entered into an engagement, one to leave the passage  free, the other to commit no disorder; and, as pledges of their  convention, they exchanged hostages.[167]    When Caesar learned that the Helvetii were preparing to pass through the  lands of the Sequani and the AEdui on their way to the Santones, he  resolved to oppose them, unwilling to suffer the establishment of  warlike and hostile men in a fertile and open country, neighbouring upon  that of the Tolosates, which made part of the Roman province.[168]    But, as he had not at hand sufficient forces, he resolved on uniting all  the troops he could dispose of in his vast command. He entrusts,  therefore, the care of the retrenchments on the Rhone to his lieutenant  T. Labienus, hastens into Italy by forced marches, raises there in great  haste two legions (the 11th and 12th), brings from Aquileia, a town of  Illyria,[169] the three legions which were there in winter quarters (the  7th, 8th, and 9th), and, at the head of his army, takes across the Alps  (_see Plate 4_) the shortest road to Transalpine Gaul.[170] The  Centrones, the Graioceli, and the Caturiges (see _page_ 24, _note_),  posted on the heights,[171] attempt to bar his road; but he overthrows  them in several engagements, and from Ocelum (_Usseau_),[172] the  extreme point of the Cisalpine, reaches in seven days the territory of  the Vocontii, making thus about twenty-five kilometres a day. He next  penetrates into the country of the Allobroges, then into that of the  Segusiavi, who bordered on the Roman province beyond the Rhone.[173]    These operations took two months;[174] the same time had been employed  by the Helvetii in negotiating the conditions of their passage through  the country of the Sequani, moving from the Rhone to the Saone, and  beginning to pass the latter river. They had passed the Pas-de-l'Ecluse,  followed the right bank of the Rhone as far as Culoz, then turned to the  east through Virieu-le-Grand, Tenay, and Saint-Rambert, and, thence  crossing the plains of Amberieux, the river Ain, and the vast plateau of  the Dombes, they had arrived at the Saone, the left bank of which they  occupied from Trevoux to Villefranche. (_See Plate 4._) The slowness of  their march need not surprise us if we consider that an agglomeration of  368,000 individuals, men, women, and children, dragging after them from  8,000 to 9,000 wagons, through a defile where carriages could only pass  one abreast, would necessarily employ several weeks in passing it.[175]  Caesar, no doubt, calculated beforehand, with sufficient accuracy, the  time it would take them to gain the banks of the Saone; and we may  therefore suppose that, at the moment when he repaired into Italy, he  hoped to bring thence his army in time to prevent them from passing that  river.    He established his camp near the confluence of the Rhone and the Saone,  on the heights which command Sathonay; thence he could equally  manoeuvre on the two banks of the Saone, take the Helvetii in flank as  they marched towards that river, or prevent them, if they crossed it,  from entering into the Roman province by the valley of the Rhone. It was  probably at this point that Labienus joined him with the troops which  had been left with him, and which raised to six the number of his  legions. His cavalry, composed principally of AEdui and men raised in the  Roman province, amounted to 4,000 men. During this time the Helvetii  were ravaging the lands of the Ambarri, those of the AEdui, and those  which the Allobroges possessed on the right bank of the Rhone. These  peoples implored the succour of Caesar. He was quite disposed to listen  to their prayers.[176]      [Sidenote: Defeat of the Helvetii on the Saone.]    V. The Saone, which crossed the countries of the AEdui and the  Sequani,[177] flowed, then as now, in certain places with an extreme  sluggishness. Caesar says that people could not distinguish the direction  of the current. The Helvetii, who had not learned to make bridges,  crossed the river, between Trevoux and Villefranche, on rafts and boats  joined together. As soon as the Roman general had ascertained by his  scouts that three-quarters of the barbarians were on the other side of  the river, and the others were still on his side, he left his camp  towards midnight (_de tertia vigilia_) (_see note 1 on page 69_) with  three legions, came upon those of the Helvetii who were still on the  left bank, to the north of Trevoux, in the valley of the Formans,  towards six o'clock in the morning, after a march of eighteen  kilometres, attacked them by surprise in the midst of the confusion of  passing the river, and slew a great number. Those who could escape  dispersed, and concealed themselves in the neighbouring forests. This  disaster fell upon the Tigurini (_the inhabitants of the Cantons of  Vaud, Friburg, and a part of the Canton of Berne_), one of the four  tribes of which the nation of the Helvetii was composed, the same which,  in an expedition out of Helvetia, had formerly slain the Consul L.  Cassius, and made his army pass under the yoke.[178]    After this combat, Caesar, in order to pursue the other part of the  enemy's army, and prevent its marching towards the south, threw a bridge  across the Saone, and transported his troops to the right bank. The  barques which followed him for the conveyance of provisions would  necessarily facilitate this operation. It is probable that a detachment  established in the defiles on the right bank of the Saone, at the spot  where Lyons now stands, intercepted the road which would have conducted  the Helvetii towards the Roman province. As to the three legions which  remained in the camp of Sathonay, they soon rejoined Caesar. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45542"],[0,"Eighteen Months in the War Zone (#9)"],[1,"fires, like all winds and  sunshine, or thunder and rain, are consolingly the same!), only instead  of soft pile carpets and arm-chairs I have a packing-case for seat  and an inverted saucepan on my knee for table. Instead of flowers,  the trestled table is adorned with bandages and bottles of lotion and  packets of dressings.    Instead of a gong to announce \"dressing time,\" and soft _decolletee_  frocks donned before long mirrors, and well-appointed dining-tables  and the announcement that \"Dinner is served,\" there are only the  promptings of my hungry inside to tell me mealtime is due, and it would  be as well to scrub up, remove the mackintosh apron, and smooth my hair  under the unbecoming white cap before the dinner is gobbled up!    Yet, until one has worked five hours to earn five minutes' rest, one  does not know the meaning of leisure.    Until one has felt the clinging of the helpless hand, or run to the  call of a feeble voice, one does not know the greatest of all joys--the  joy of service.    The rapidity with which the Gare Maritime Hospital is developing  is marvellous. Instead of wallowing to our ankles in a slush of  disinfectant and rain-water, the wards are well swept, with two strips  of cheery red carpet on either side. Instead of boards and blankets,  some 200 real beds have been installed, with sheets of coarse calico  and pillows. Instead of empty crates (and those at a premium) there are  chairs, whilst towels supplant the red handkerchiefs which now hang  desolately from the lamps by night _and_ day.    Just at present the casualty ward, in which an emergency operation  theatre has been opened, is lying empty, so are the other wards. One  wonders why? The truth is, things are looking fairly bad. The enemy  is only forty-five miles from Calais and still presses on to the goal.  There is a rumour that the Germans are through the lines everywhere,  that we have no men to send (though the French are supposed to be  reinforcing) until the 8th Division of \"K's\" untrained army comes out,  and the evacuation of Boulogne is imminent. We are told to be prepared  to leave at a minute's notice, for once through the lines the enemy can  march here unmolested. Despite the violent storm, all the wounded whom  it is possible to move have been sent home (an ominous fact, for their  removal should betoken an advance on our part), and still the ambulance  trains come back from the front empty. A pestilential battle rages at  Arras; Dixmude has fallen (yes, several of the Censor's censors have  been dismissed for letting us know this!) A hundred questions assail  us. Will the hopeless cases have to be left behind? What will be done  to the many millions' worth of stores in this spy-ridden place?    Heaven knows! We can but \"wait and see.\"    We are lost in amazement at the lukewarmness of the masses at home who  do not seem to realise the significance of this move.    But let me return to No. ---- Stationary Hospital, where the staff is  greatly augmented and Army nurses work side by side with those of the  Red Cross.    If there is some slight friction between the two it is easily  understood, for how can the newly arrived Army sisters be expected to  find in a dirty, evil-smelling barn anything but the violation of all  the laws of hygiene? Whereas to those Red Cross sisters, who have built  it up with their life's blood, so to speak, who have watched it evolve  under their weary fingers, it is a place of supreme beauty and first  importance.    If there is some slight friction amongst the authorities, too, it is  soon explained. For it is as much the duty of the Red Cross to cherish  its own rights as it is for the Army to centralise and control, at a  time like this, every existing institution to prevent the misuse of  public funds.    Both are in the right.    At home no one seemed quite to realise the exact position of the Red  Cross and the various Army medical services. Out here, except that  a distinct antagonism between the two organisations prevails, the  position is equally vague.    The British Red Cross Society and the St. John Ambulance Association  were originally formed to supplement the requirements of the military  and naval medical services in war time, thus obviating the expense  of keeping up an exceptionally large staff in days of peace. On this  understanding the War Office took nominal control of the various  B.R.C.S. enterprises, supervising the First Aid examinations and  keeping a register of all its members. The value of that registration  of B.R.C.S. members by the War Office is not quite obvious at present,  for the War Office appears to disclaim all responsibility for the Red  Cross. There are even rumours that a large portion of its personnel is  to be greatly reduced and eventually sent from the base. In fact, no  one's work or position is clearly defined.    The work of the Royal Army Medical Corps, the Nursing Service,  \"Q.A.I.M.N.S.,\" Reserve, Indian and Territorial, was well defined  enough. Field ambulances, clearing stations, stationary hospitals  (so-called because they are movable!) and base hospitals were  their sphere, and vaguely it was understood that the Voluntary Aid  Detachments were destined for use with the Territorial Forces.    Then, when at the outbreak of hostilities there came the call for more  workers, many doctors and fully-trained nurses, anxious to get to that  mysterious and alluring unknown, the Front, threw up their good posts  and sold their patiently built-up practices in order to join the Red  Cross.    Many of them are already regretting their impetuousness. Not only the  members of the Voluntary Aid Detachments, who have hitherto played at  work under War Office supervision and with War Office sanction, but the  much-needed trained nurses and doctors (many of them specialists of  the first order) find themselves somewhat shelved, oftentimes deprived  of the best surgical work by those of their juniors who had had the  foresight or good luck to join the Reserve or Territorials instead of  a volunteer concern whose position is, as yet, indefinite and whose  scope, so far, limited. Many even find themselves on the Reserve Staff  and waiting for work. A certain restlessness that prevails amongst  these is easily explained, for it is not always possible to console  oneself with the idea that inaction is merely a respite and preparation  for the next call upon one's energies, when that call is lying all  around in understaffed hospitals.      _November 13th._ Perhaps it was the unconquerable instinct to help lame  dogs over stiles that prompted the Matron to ask after some German  literature for a prisoner whose two legs had been amputated. I, as  linguist and jack-of-all-trades, was deputed to forage for Hun books,  and, for the first time, found my conversance with the language a  matter of embarrassment rather than of pride.    As I entered the French bookseller's, and asked for what I wanted, the  girl eyed me with suspicion. Then, \"We are not pro-German,\" she said  with _hauteur_.    Fearful to return, my mission unaccomplished, I tried shop after shop.    \"You can climb on that ladder and see for yourself,\" said a young girl,  pointing to a high ladder and daring me up it with her scornful eyes. I  unearthed and returned with an old paper-backed novel for the prisoner,  with a heavy heart, wondering if I was unpatriotic to have carried out  my orders--but the legless man had died in the meantime.    Such is the spirit of France--vengeance on a ruthless, untrustworthy  enemy.    Such the spirit of England, maybe hyper-quixotic--never to hit a man  when he is down.      _November 15th._ Last night Lord Roberts died. The little wrinkled old  man, who only a week ago was in our midst, walking round our wards,  cheering on the wounded, encouraging the Indians, has finished as he  began, in the sphere of action.      _November 17th._ This morning the mail boat is accompanied by six  French destroyers. In the town all flags are flying half-mast; in the  station are massed guards, French, English, Indian. The Sikhs are  fine-looking specimens of humanity, and objects of great interest to  the peasants who crowd round exchanging souvenirs. The smaller hillmen  look as if they would be very formidable foes, though at present many  of them lie curled up asleep on sacks, and covered with sacks, as  peacefully as children.      _Later._ After the coffin of the great little man, who has, alas! lived  to see his worst fears for his country realised, had been borne on  board, we went to look at the armoured train that is in hospital. A  strange, formidable-looking thing, too, is this vehicle of destruction,  daubed with many-hued, very futuristic patches, and guarded by  sentries.     [Illustration: LORD ROBERTS'S FUNERAL: THE SCENE ON THE QUAY]    A large legend announced the train's destination as \"Berlin,\" whilst  great guns, daubed with their appropriate names, \"Homeless Hector\" and  \"Weary Willie,\" pointed their inquiring noses innocuously at the sky.    This, we were told, was the armoured train which, under Commander  Samson's guidance, played such havoc with the enemy and caused the  Kaiser to put a price worth having on that gallant officer's head.      _November 23rd._ The baths closed most suddenly and unexpectedly last  night. The owners' exorbitant demands for money--damages for towels  which we have not even used, walls, ceilings, windows, etc., that are  in the same good repair as when we came--have made it imperative to  commandeer the place or, to avoid friction and expense, erect new ones.    After the Major and his interpreter driver (a dentist who volunteered  his services) had spent nearly two hours haranguing Madame and her  _homme d'affaires_, we cleared the place out.    Snow fell for the first time during the night, and it is freezing so  hard this morning that the hot water thrown over the stones outside  for cleansing"]]]
