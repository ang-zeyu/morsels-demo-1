With him was a girl of  about his own age--a certain characterful young lady whom Bryce knew  as Betty Campany, daughter of the librarian to the Dean and Chapter and  therefore custodian of one of the most famous cathedral libraries in  the country. She, too, was apparently brimming with excitement, and her  pretty and vivacious face puckered itself into a frown as the policeman  smiled and shook his head.    \"Oh, I say, what's that for?\" exclaimed Dick Bewery. \"Shut up?--what a  lot of rot! I say!--can't you let us go in--just for a minute?\"    \"Not for a pension, sir!\" answered the policeman good-naturedly. \"Don't  you see the notice? The Dean 'ud have me out of the force by tomorrow if  I disobeyed orders. No admittance, nowhere, nohow! But lor' bless  yer!\" he added, glancing at the two young people. \"There's nothing to  see--nothing!--as Dr. Bryce there can tell you.\"    Dick, who knew nothing of the recent passages between his guardian and  the dismissed assistant, glanced at Bryce with interest.    \"You were on the spot first, weren't you?\" he asked: \"Do you think it  really was murder?\"    \"I don't know what it was,\" answered Bryce. \"And I wasn't first on the  spot. That was Varner, the mason--he called me.\" He turned from the lad  to glance at the girl, who was peeping curiously over the gate into  the yews and cypresses. \"Do you think your father's at the Library just  now?\" he asked. \"Shall I find him there?\"    \"I should think he is,\" answered Betty Campany. \"He generally goes down  about this time.\" She turned and pulled Dick Bewery's sleeve. \"Let's go  up in the clerestory,\" she said. \"We can see that, anyway.\"    \"Also closed, miss,\" said the policeman, shaking his head. \"No  admittance there, neither. The public firmly warned off--so to speak. 'I  won't have the Cathedral turned into a peepshow!' that's precisely what  I heard the Dean say with my own ears. So--closed!\"    The boy and the girl turned away and went off across the Close, and the  policeman looked after them and laughed.    \"Lively young couple, that, sir!\" he said. \"What they call healthy  curiosity, I suppose? Plenty o' that knocking around in the city today.\"    Bryce, who had half-turned in the direction of the Library, at the other  side of the Close, turned round again.    \"Do you know if your people are doing anything about identifying the  dead man?\" he asked. \"Did you hear anything at noon?\"    \"Nothing but that there'll be inquiries through the newspapers, sir,\"  replied the policeman. \"That's the surest way of finding something out.  And I did hear Inspector Mitchington say that they'd have to ask the  Duke if he knew anything about the poor man--I suppose he'd let fall  something about wanting to go over to Saxonsteade.\"    Bryce went off in the direction of the Library thinking. The  newspapers?--yes, no better channel for spreading the news. If Mr. John  Braden had relations and friends, they would learn of his sad death  through the newspapers, and would come forward. And in that case--    \"But it wouldn't surprise me,\" mused Bryce, \"if the name given at the  Mitre is an assumed name. I wonder if that theory of Archdale's is a  correct one?--however, there'll be more of that at the inquest tomorrow.  And in the meantime--let me find out something about the tomb of Richard  Jenkins, or Jenkinson--whoever he was.\"    The famous Library of the Dean and Chapter of Wrychester was housed in  an ancient picturesque building in one corner of the Close, wherein, day  in and day out, amidst priceless volumes and manuscripts, huge folios  and weighty quartos, old prints, and relics of the mediaeval ages,  Ambrose Campany, the librarian, was pretty nearly always to be found,  ready to show his treasures to the visitors and tourists who came from  all parts of the world to see a collection well known to bibliophiles.  And Ambrose Campany, a cheery-faced, middle-aged man, with booklover and  antiquary written all over him, shockheaded, blue-spectacled, was there  now, talking to an old man whom Bryce knew as a neighbour of his  in Friary Lane--one Simpson Barker, a quiet, meditative old fellow,  believed to be a retired tradesman who spent his time in gentle  pottering about the city. Bryce, as he entered, caught what Campany was  just then saying.    \"The most important thing I've heard about it,\" said Campany, \"is--that  book they found in the man's suit-case at the Mitre. I'm not a  detective--but there's a clue!\"          CHAPTER VI. BY MISADVENTURE      Old Simpson Harker, who sat near the librarian's table, his hands  folded on the crook of his stout walking stick, glanced out of a pair  of unusually shrewd and bright eyes at Bryce as he crossed the room and  approached the pair of gossipers.    \"I think the doctor was there when that book you're speaking of was  found,\" he remarked. \"So I understood from Mitchington.\"    \"Yes, I was there,\" said Bryce, who was not unwilling to join in the  talk. He turned to Campany. \"What makes you think there's a clue--in  that?\" he asked.    \"Why this,\" answered the librarian. \"Here's a man in possession of  an old history of Barthorpe. Barthorpe is a small market-town in the  Midlands--Leicestershire, I believe, of no particular importance that I  know of, but doubtless with a story of its own. Why should any one but a  Barthorpe man, past or present, be interested in that story so far as to  carry an old account of it with him? Therefore, I conclude this stranger  was a Barthorpe man. And it's at Barthorpe that I should make inquiries  about him.\"    Simpson Harker made no remark, and Bryce remembered what Mr. Dellingham  had said when the book was found.    \"Oh, I don't know!\" he replied carelessly. \"I don't see that  that follows. I saw the book--a curious old binding and queer old  copper-plates. The man may have picked it up for that reason--I've  bought old books myself for less.\"    \"All the same,\" retorted Campany, \"I should make inquiry at Barthorpe.  You've got to go on probabilities. The probabilities in this case are  that the man was interested in the book because it dealt with his own  town.\"    Bryce turned away towards a wall on which hung a number of charts and  plans of Wrychester Cathedral and its precincts--it was to inspect one  of these that he had come to the Library. But suddenly remembering that  there was a question which he could ask without exciting any suspicion  or surmise, he faced round again on the librarian.    \"Isn't there a register of burials within the Cathedral?\" he inquired.  \"Some book in which they're put down? I was looking in the Memorials of  Wrychester the other day, and I saw some names I want to trace.\"    Campany lifted his quill pen and pointed to a case of big leather-bound  volumes in a far corner of the room.    \"Third shelf from the bottom, doctor,\" he replied. \"You'll see two books  there--one's the register of all burials within the Cathedral itself  up to date: the other's the register of those in Paradise and the  cloisters. What names are you wanting to trace?\"    But Bryce affected not to hear the last question; he walked over to  the place which Campany had indicated, and taking down the second book  carried it to an adjacent table. Campany called across the room to him.    \"You'll find useful indexes at the end,\" he said. \"They're all brought  up to the present time--from four hundred years ago, nearly.\"    Bryce turned to the index at the end of his book--an index written out  in various styles of handwriting. And within a minute he found the name  he wanted--there it was plainly before him--Richard Jenkins, died March  8th, 1715: buried, in Paradise, March 10th. He nearly laughed aloud  at the ease with which he was tracing out what at first had seemed a  difficult matter to investigate. But lest his task should seem too easy,  he continued to turn over the leaves of the big folio, and in order to  have an excuse if the librarian should ask him any further questions, he  memorized some of the names which he saw. And after a while he took the  book back to its shelf, and turned to the wall on which the charts and  maps were hung. There was one there of Paradise, whereon was marked the  site and names of all the tombs and graves in that ancient enclosure;  from it he hoped to ascertain the exact position and whereabouts of  Richard Jenkins's grave.    But here Bryce met his first check. Down each side of the old  chart--dated 1850--there was a tabulated list of the tombs in Paradise.  The names of families and persons were given in this list--against each  name was a number corresponding with the same number, marked on the  various divisions of the chart. And there was no Richard Jenkins on  that list--he went over it carefully twice, thrice. It was not there.  Obviously, if the tomb of Richard Jenkins, who was buried in Paradise in  1715, was still there, amongst the cypresses and yew trees, the name and  inscription on it had vanished, worn away by time and weather, when that  chart had been made, a hundred and thirty-five years later. And in that  case, what did the memorandum mean which Bryce had found in the dead  man's purse?    He turned away at last from the chart, at a loss--and Campany glanced at  him.    \"Found what you wanted?\" he asked.    \"Oh, yes!\" replied Bryce, primed with a ready answer. \"I just wanted to  see where the Spelbanks were buried--quite a lot of them, I see.\"    \"Southeast corner of Paradise,\" said Campany. \"Several tombs. I could  have spared you the trouble of looking.\"    \"You're a regular encyclopaedia about the place,\" laughed Bryce. \"I  suppose you know every spout and gargoyle!\"    \"Ought to,\" answered the librarian. \"I've been fed on it, man and boy,  for five-and-forty years.\"    Bryce made some fitting remark and went out and home to his rooms--there  to spend most of the ensuing evening in trying to puzzle out the various  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5311"],[0,"Parnassus on Wheels (#9)"],[1,"men. But this book I'm worrying about now really deserves  to be written, I think, for it has a message of its own.\"    He gazed almost wistfully across the sunny valley. In the distance  I caught a glint of the Sound. The Professor's faded tweed cap was  slanted over one ear, and his stubby little beard shone bright red  in the sun. I kept a sympathetic silence. He seemed pleased to have  some one to talk to about his precious book.    \"The world is full of great writers about literature,\" he said,  \"but they're all selfish and aristocratic. Addison, Lamb, Hazlitt,  Emerson, Lowell--take any one you choose--they all conceive the love  of books as a rare and perfect mystery for the few--a thing of the  secluded study where they can sit alone at night with a candle,  and a cigar, and a glass of port on the table and a spaniel on the  hearthrug. What I say is, who has ever gone out into high roads and  hedges to bring literature home to the plain man? To bring it home  to his business and bosom, as somebody says? The farther into the  country you go, the fewer and worse books you find. I've spent  several years joggling around with this citadel of crime, and by  the bones of Ben Ezra I don't think I ever found a really good book  (except the Bible) at a farmhouse yet, unless I put it there myself.  The mandarins of culture--what do they do to teach the common folk  to read? It's no good writing down lists of books for farmers and  compiling five-foot shelves; you've got to go out and visit the  people yourself--take the books to them, talk to the teachers and  bully the editors of country newspapers and farm magazines and tell  the children stories--and then little by little you begin to get  good books circulating in the veins of the nation. It's a great  work, mind you! It's like carrying the Holy Grail to some of these  way-back farmhouses. And I wish there were a thousand Parnassuses  instead of this one. I'd never give it up if it weren't for my book:  but I want to write about my ideas in the hope of stirring other  folk up, too. I don't suppose there's a publisher in the country  will take it!\"    \"Try Mr. Decameron,\" I said. \"He's always been very nice to Andrew.\"    \"Think what it would mean,\" he cried, waving an eloquent hand, \"if  some rich man would start a fund to equip a hundred or so wagons  like this to go huckstering literature around through the rural  districts. It would pay, too, once you got started. Yes, by the  bones of Webster! I went to a meeting of booksellers once, at some  hotel in New York, and told 'em about my scheme. They laughed at me.  But I've had more fun toting books around in this Parnassus than I  could have had in fifty years sitting in a bookstore, or teaching  school, or preaching. Life's full of savour when you go creaking  along the road like this. Look at today, with the sun and the air  and the silver clouds. Best of all, though, I love the rainy days. I  used to pull up alongside the road, throw a rubber blanket over Peg,  and Bock and I would curl up in the bunk and smoke and read. I used  to read aloud to Bock: we went through 'Midshipman Easy' together,  and a good deal of Shakespeare. He's a very bookish dog. We've seen  some queer experiences in this Parnassus.\"    The hill road from Shelby to Port Vigor is a lonely one, as most  of the farmhouses lie down in the valley. If I had known better we  might have taken the longer and more populous way, but as a matter  of fact I was enjoying the wide view and the solitary road lying  white in the sunshine. We jogged along very pleasantly. Once more we  stopped at a house where Mifflin pleaded for a chance to exercise  his art. I was much amused when he succeeded in selling a copy of  \"Grimm's Fairy Tales\" to a shrewish spinster on the plea that she  would enjoy reading the stories to her nephews and nieces who were  coming to visit her.    \"My!\" he chuckled, as he gave me the dingy quarter he had extracted.  \"There's nothing in that book as grim as she is!\"    A little farther on we halted by a roadside spring to give Peg a  drink, and I suggested lunch. I had laid in some bread and cheese in  Shelby, and with this and some jam we made excellent sandwiches. As  we were sitting by the fence the motor stage trundled past on its  way to Port Vigor. A little distance down the road it halted, and  then went on again. I saw a familiar figure walking back toward us.    \"Now I'm in for it,\" I said to the Professor. \"Here's Andrew!\"        CHAPTER SEVEN      Andrew is just as thin as I am fat, and his clothes hang on him in  the most comical way. He is very tall and shambling, wears a ragged  beard and a broad Stetson hat, and suffers amazingly from hay fever  in the autumn. (In fact, his essay on \"Hay Fever\" is the best thing  he ever wrote, I think.) As he came striding up the road I noticed  how his trousers fluttered at the ankles as the wind plucked at  them. The breeze curled his beard back under his chin and his face  was quite dark with anger. I couldn't help being amused; he looked  so funny.    \"The Sage looks like Bernard Shaw,\" whispered Mifflin.    I always believe in drawing first blood.    \"Good-morning, Andrew,\" I called cheerfully. \"Want to buy any  books?\" I halted Pegasus, and Andrew stood a little in front of  the wheel--partly out of breath and mostly out of temper.    \"What on earth is this nonsense, Helen?\" he said angrily. \"You've  led me the deuce of a chase since yesterday. And who is this--this  person you're driving with?\"    \"Andrew,\" I said, \"you forget your manners. Let me introduce Mr.  Mifflin. I have bought his caravan and am taking a holiday, selling  books. Mr. Mifflin is on his way to Port Vigor where he takes the  train to Brooklyn.\"    Andrew stared at the Professor without speaking. I could tell by the  blaze in his light-blue eyes that he was thoroughly angry, and I  feared things would be worse before they were better. Andrew is slow  to wrath, but a very hard person to deal with when roused. And I had  some inkling by this time of the Professor's temperament. Moreover,  I am afraid that some of my remarks had rather prejudiced him  against Andrew, as a brother at any rate and apart from his  excellent prose.    Mifflin had the next word. He had taken off his funny little cap,  and his bare skull shone like an egg. I noticed a little sort of  fairy ring of tiny drops around his crown.    \"My dear sir,\" said Mifflin, \"the proceedings look somewhat unusual,  but the facts are simple to narrate. Your sister has bought this van  and its contents, and I have been instructing her in my theories of  the dissemination of good books. You as a literary man...\"    Andrew paid absolutely no attention to the Professor, and I saw a  slow flush tinge Mifflin's sallow cheek.    \"Look here, Helen,\" said Andrew, \"do you think I propose to have my  sister careering around the State with a strolling vagabond? Upon my  soul you ought to have better sense--and at your age and weight! I  got home yesterday and found your ridiculous note. I went to Mrs.  Collins, and she knew nothing. I went to Mason's, and found him  wondering who had bilked his telephone. I suppose you did that. He  had seen this freight car of yours and put me on the track. But my  God! I never thought to see a woman of forty abducted by gypsies!\"    Mifflin was about to speak but I waved him back.    \"Now see here Andrew,\" I said, \"you talk too quickly. A woman of  forty (you exaggerate, by the way) who has compiled an anthology  of 6,000 loaves of bread and dedicated it to you deserves some  courtesy. When _you_ want to run off on some vagabond tour or other  you don't hesitate to do it. You expect me to stay home and do  the Lady Eglantine in the poultry yard. By the ghost of Susan B.  Anthony, I won't do it! This is the first real holiday I've had in  fifteen years, and I'm going to suit myself.\"    Andrew's mouth opened, but I shook my fist so convincingly that he  halted.    \"I bought this Parnassus from Mr. Mifflin fair and square for four  hundred dollars. That's the price of about thirteen hundred dozen  eggs,\" I said. (I had worked this out in my head while Mifflin was  talking about his book.)    \"The money's mine, and I'm going to use it my own way. Now, Andrew  McGill, if you want to buy any books, you can parley with me.  Otherwise, I'm on my way. You can expect me back when you see me.\"  I handed him one of Mifflin's little cards, which were in a pocket  at the side of the van, and gathered up the reins. I was really  angry, for Andrew had been both unreasonable and insulting.    Andrew looked at the card, and tore it in halves. He looked at the  side of Parnassus where the fresh red lettering was still damp.    \"Well, upon my word,\" he said, \"you must be crazy.\" He burst into a  violent fit of sneezing--a last touch of hay fever, I suspect, as  there was still goldenrod in the meadows. He coughed and sneezed  furiously, which made him madder than ever. At last he turned to  Mifflin who was sitting bald-headed with a flushed face and very  bright eyes. Andrew took him all in, the shabby Norfolk jacket, the  bulging memorandum book in his pocket, the stuffed portmanteau under  his foot, even the copy of \"Happiness and Hayseed\" which had dropped  to the floor and lay back up.    \"Look here, you,\" said Andrew, \"I don't know by what infernal arts  you cajoled my sister away to go vagabonding in a huckster's wagon,  but I know this, that if you've cheated her out of her money I'll  have the law on you.\"    I tried to insert a word of protest, but matters had gone too far.  The Professor was as mad as Andrew now.    \"By the bones of Piers Plowman,\" he said, \"I had expected to meet a  man of letters and the author of this book\"--he held up \"Happiness  and Hayseed\"--\"but I see I was mistaken. I tell you, sir, a man who  would insult his sister before a stranger, as you have done, is an  oaf and a cad.\" He threw the book over the"]]]
