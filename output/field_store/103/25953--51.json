Matter can not move, unless moved  upon; nor stop of itself, when once in motion. Absolutely powerless!  The power of attraction, which we may call a property of matter, is  really the power of God. The effects are the results of power and  intelligence. Law has neither power nor intelligence.  Human law marks  out the course man _should_ pursue.  Divine law records the  course God _has_ pursued. Human law must be enforced by all the  executive power of the nation. God executes his own will, with perfect  regularity; and, by courtesy of language, we call it \"law.\" He is the  great executor of the universe, not far removed, but proven present  everywhere, by the power and wisdom necessary to produce the results.  These results are found in the boundless universe, and in the  microscopic world.  They are found in the world far below the power of  the most powerful microscope to detect. All the combinations of  chemical elements are made, hidden from the eye of the microscope.  Substances are dissolved and new combinations made, atoms are  numbered, counted and combined with mathematical precision, and with  an intelligence difficult for man to compute. No law could do  this. Only a Being who has sufficient power and intelligence is equal  to it. Law has no power, nor intelligence. Water is composed of two  atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen, combined with absolute precision  everywhere. All chemical reactions require computations of an  intelligent being. All nature teems with proofs that God is every  where present.  The elements in a high explosive are arranged  instantly in new combinations, each atom taking its proper partners,  in the proper proportion, with unerring precision. Countless  calculations of the most difficult kind are made instantly and  continually by the divine mind. Thus God's presence everywhere in the  minutest forms of matter is clearly proved. It is a mathematical  demonstration. God is not wearied by the care of worlds and suns, and  systems and snow-drifts of stars on the highway of heaven, and takes  just as perfect notice of atoms and electrons. They who think God is  unable or unwilling to take care of the minutest division of matter as  well as the rolling suns, must have a very diluted idea of God. It is  now claimed that the atom, formerly believed to be the smallest  division of matter, consists of 1740 parts. Sir Oliver Lodge says that  the structure of an atom is as complex as that of a piano. This latest  scientific discovery detects the power and wisdom of God, controlling,  for ages, this minutest division of matter, undetected by the most  powerful microscope.    It staggers one to think of the countless and difficult calculations  that are made instantly by the divine mind in every part of the  universe. The path of every snowflake that lazily pursues its tortuous  course, and rests upon the lap of earth, is marked out, not by any law  or agent, but by God himself. He calculates instantly the cyclone's  path, the movement of every particle of air, the direction, velocity  and path of every raindrop. A law could not do it. The wisest man  could not do it. But God can do it, with the ease with which the  tempest carries a feather on its bosom, or the ocean floats a straw!  Every second, about 16,000,000 tons of rain and snow fall to the  earth; and God calculates the paths of the myriad flakes of snow and  drops of rain instantly and unerringly.    The Conservation of Energy and the inter-convertibility of  forces--light, heat, electricity,--taking place constantly everywhere,  often on a stupendous scale, require bewildering calculations by an  ever-present God. No energy, not even potential energy, can be lost in  converting one force into another. It must be computed exactly.    Who but an infinite God could have calculated the enormous potential  energy of the nebulous gases, required by contraction to cause the  prodigious heat of a universe of suns?    The earth turns over noiselessly every 24 hours, carrying on its  bosom, at the rate of 1000 mi. an hour, at dizzy heights, a most  tenuous atmosphere, without a rustle, without the loss of a second in  1000 years. The earth with its satellite, is traveling around the sun  at the rate of 18.5 mi. per second--75 times as fast as a cannon  ball,--bearing a load of 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons, and  arriving at a given point in its orbit, on exact time every tropical  year. It has arrived so promptly on time following its elliptical  course, at such a rate that the radius vector, a line from the sun to  the earth, passes over equal areas in equal times, furnishing every  moment an abtruse problem difficult for a scholar to solve. The orbit  is so vast that it varies from a straight line, but 4 in. in 666 mi.,  the distance from Philadelphia to Chicago.    The sun also, with its family of worlds and their satellites, is  plunging through space at the rate of 8.5 mi. per second; moreover,  there are swarms of huge suns, many larger than ours, moving in  straight-lines like a universe on a journey, and countless millions of  suns in swiftest flight through the skies, whose orbits and rates of  motion must all be calculated and controlled by a mind of amazing  power and intelligence.    Is not the so-called \"scientist\" either a madman or a fool, who  believes that all this can be accounted for, without the presence of a  God of infinite power and intelligence?    Water contracts as the temperature falls. But when within four degrees  of the freezing point, water expands and ice becomes lighter than  water, and floats, and saves all bodies of water from becoming solid  bodies of ice.    Who can say that God does not intervene, in this case, to save all  life? It is a striking proof that God is not absent nor inactive.    Gravitation requires the computation of countless millions of the most  complex and difficult problems, every instant, by the divine mind. The  attraction of all matter for all other matter is in proportion  directly to the mass and inversely to the square of the distance. The  exact weight of every object is determined by the attraction of the  earth and every particle thereof, the mountain that may be nearby, the  elevation and altitude of the place, the attraction of the sun and the  moon, and every star in heaven, even though too small to be computed  by man,--all these are computed precisely by the divine mind. These  innumerable calculations prove that God is everywhere.  We are  continually in the immediate awesome presence of an Infinite God.    Every computation that man ever made, was made long before by a great  Intelligence, that excels all others combined. How intricate is the  calculation of the divine mind, which causes the water of every ocean,  sea, lake, pond, and vessel, when at rest, to correspond with the  exact sphericity of the earth. In the face of innumerable and  difficult calculations,--proofs of the intense activity of the divine  mind,--who can be so reckless as to say that God is absent or  inactive?    Not only does God make endless calculations in executing his will in  the material universe, but in the intellectual, moral and spiritual  world as well. We can not measure, with any human instruments, the  amount of mental discipline and improvement, resulting from a certain  amount of study. But God calculates unerringly the precise amount of  mental discipline or improvement earned by every mental exertion. The  amount is in precise proportion to the mental effort. The gain is  definite, exact and unerring, the calculation is instantaneous, and  beyond the power of the profoundest mathematician to compute. So also,  the effect of every moral act, wish, desire, purpose, intention or  affection, is instantly computed, and the moral character modified in  exact proportion to their weight. If a man indulges in vice, he  becomes vicious in proportion.  If he commits a crime, he becomes more  criminal in nature. Every theft is computed at its proper value.  Every good and noble act ennobles the character in proportion to its  worth. There is a settlement, every instant, and all deeds, wishes,  desires, purposes, and affections go into the character, and affect it  in precise proportion to their weight. Who but an infinite God, can  keep all accounts of his innumerable creatures instantaneously, and  have them complete, exact and unerring? No man, nor angel, nor \"law,\"  could do it. In like manner, every spiritual act, wish, purpose,  motive,--all go in to make up the spiritual life of man, in exact  proportion to their worth.  Not all the mathematicians and scribes in  the universe could together solve the problems, that the great  intellect of the Supreme Ruler is solving every instant of time.    This theory of an absent or inactive God leaves no place for prayer,  an almost universal instinct of mankind.  If a blind, deaf, and dumb  and helpless law is in control, it is useless to pray for help. All  nations, races and peoples instinctively believe that God hears and  answers prayer. This is a scientific fact with which evolutionists  must reckon, even if it has a pious or otherwise offensive sound. No  use to pray to an inexorable \"law,\" which, like the gods of the  heathen, can neither see, nor hear, nor taste, nor smell.    How unscientific then seems the following declaration of Darwin: \"To  my mind, it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on  matter [How could that be?] by the Creator, that the production and  extinction of the past and present inhabitants of the world should  have been due to secondary causes, like those determining the birth  and death of the individual.\" It does not remove the First Great Cause  from active control of the world to call his acts \"secondary causes.\"        14. CHANCE OR DESIGN?      Evolution is the old heathen doctrine of chance. It professes to  eliminate"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/852"],[0,"Democracy and Education: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education (#9)"],[1,"knowledge of the physical world with knowledge of persons.  The purport of our discussion is that such a view makes an absurd and  impossible separation between persons and things. Interaction with  things may form habits of external adjustment. But it leads to activity  having a meaning and conscious intent only when things are used to  produce a result. And the only way one person can modify the mind of  another is by using physical conditions, crude or artificial, so as  to evoke some answering activity from him. Such are our two main  conclusions. It is desirable to amplify and enforce them by placing them  in contrast with the theory which uses a psychology of supposed direct  relationships of human beings to one another as an adjunct to the  psychology of the supposed direct relation of an individual to physical  objects. In substance, this so-called social psychology has been built  upon the notion of imitation. Consequently, we shall discuss the nature  and role of imitation in the formation of mental disposition.    According to this theory, social control of individuals rests upon the  instinctive tendency of individuals to imitate or copy the actions of  others. The latter serve as models. The imitative instinct is so strong  that the young devote themselves to conforming to the patterns set by  others and reproducing them in their own scheme of behavior. According  to our theory, what is here called imitation is a misleading name for  partaking with others in a use of things which leads to consequences of  common interest. The basic error in the current notion of imitation is  that it puts the cart before the horse. It takes an effect for the  cause of the effect. There can be no doubt that individuals in forming a  social group are like-minded; they understand one another. They tend  to act with the same controlling ideas, beliefs, and intentions, given  similar circumstances. Looked at from without, they might be said to  be engaged in \"imitating\" one another. In the sense that they are doing  much the same sort of thing in much the same sort of way, this would be  true enough. But \"imitation\" throws no light upon why they so act; it  repeats the fact as an explanation of itself. It is an explanation of  the same order as the famous saying that opium puts men to sleep because  of its dormitive power.    Objective likeness of acts and the mental satisfaction found in being in  conformity with others are baptized by the name imitation. This social  fact is then taken for a psychological force, which produced the  likeness. A considerable portion of what is called imitation is simply  the fact that persons being alike in structure respond in the same way  to like stimuli. Quite independently of imitation, men on being insulted  get angry and attack the insulter. This statement may be met by citing  the undoubted fact that response to an insult takes place in different  ways in groups having different customs. In one group, it may be met by  recourse to fisticuffs, in another by a challenge to a duel, in a third  by an exhibition of contemptuous disregard. This happens, so it is said,  because the model set for imitation is different. But there is no need  to appeal to imitation. The mere fact that customs are different means  that the actual stimuli to behavior are different. Conscious instruction  plays a part; prior approvals and disapprovals have a large influence.  Still more effective is the fact that unless an individual acts in the  way current in his group, he is literally out of it. He can associate  with others on intimate and equal terms only by behaving in the way in  which they behave. The pressure that comes from the fact that one is  let into the group action by acting in one way and shut out by acting  in another way is unremitting. What is called the effect of imitation  is mainly the product of conscious instruction and of the selective  influence exercised by the unconscious confirmations and ratifications  of those with whom one associates.    Suppose that some one rolls a ball to a child; he catches it and rolls  it back, and the game goes on. Here the stimulus is not just the  sight of the ball, or the sight of the other rolling it. It is the  situation--the game which is playing. The response is not merely rolling  the ball back; it is rolling it back so that the other one may catch and  return it,--that the game may continue. The \"pattern\" or model is not  the action of the other person. The whole situation requires that each  should adapt his action in view of what the other person has done and is  to do. Imitation may come in but its role is subordinate. The child has  an interest on his own account; he wants to keep it going. He may then  note how the other person catches and holds the ball in order to improve  his own acts. He imitates the means of doing, not the end or thing to be  done. And he imitates the means because he wishes, on his own behalf, as  part of his own initiative, to take an effective part in the game. One  has only to consider how completely the child is dependent from his  earliest days for successful execution of his purposes upon fitting his  acts into those of others to see what a premium is put upon behaving as  others behave, and of developing an understanding of them in order that  he may so behave. The pressure for likemindedness in action from this  source is so great that it is quite superfluous to appeal to imitation.  As matter of fact, imitation of ends, as distinct from imitation of  means which help to reach ends, is a superficial and transitory affair  which leaves little effect upon disposition. Idiots are especially apt  at this kind of imitation; it affects outward acts but not the meaning  of their performance. When we find children engaging in this sort of  mimicry, instead of encouraging them (as we would do if it were an  important means of social control) we are more likely to rebuke them  as apes, monkeys, parrots, or copy cats. Imitation of means of  accomplishment is, on the other hand, an intelligent act. It involves  close observation, and judicious selection of what will enable one to do  better something which he already is trying to do. Used for a purpose,  the imitative instinct may, like any other instinct, become a factor in  the development of effective action.    This excursus should, accordingly, have the effect of reinforcing the  conclusion that genuine social control means the formation of a certain  mental disposition; a way of understanding objects, events, and acts  which enables one to participate effectively in associated activities.  Only the friction engendered by meeting resistance from others leads  to the view that it takes place by forcing a line of action contrary to  natural inclinations. Only failure to take account of the situations  in which persons are mutually concerned (or interested in acting  responsively to one another) leads to treating imitation as the chief  agent in promoting social control.    4. Some Applications to Education. Why does a savage group perpetuate  savagery, and a civilized group civilization? Doubtless the first answer  to occur to mind is because savages are savages; being of low-grade  intelligence and perhaps defective moral sense. But careful study  has made it doubtful whether their native capacities are appreciably  inferior to those of civilized man. It has made it certain that native  differences are not sufficient to account for the difference in culture.  In a sense the mind of savage peoples is an effect, rather than a cause,  of their backward institutions. Their social activities are such as to  restrict their objects of attention and interest, and hence to limit  the stimuli to mental development. Even as regards the objects that come  within the scope of attention, primitive social customs tend to arrest  observation and imagination upon qualities which do not fructify in the  mind. Lack of control of natural forces means that a scant number of  natural objects enter into associated behavior. Only a small number of  natural resources are utilized and they are not worked for what they are  worth. The advance of civilization means that a larger number of natural  forces and objects have been transformed into instrumentalities of  action, into means for securing ends. We start not so much with superior  capacities as with superior stimuli for evocation and direction of  our capacities. The savage deals largely with crude stimuli; we have  weighted stimuli. Prior human efforts have made over natural conditions.  As they originally existed they were indifferent to human endeavors.  Every domesticated plant and animal, every tool, every utensil, every  appliance, every manufactured article, every esthetic decoration,  every work of art means a transformation of conditions once hostile  or indifferent to characteristic human activities into friendly and  favoring conditions. Because the activities of children today are  controlled by these selected and charged stimuli, children are able to  traverse in a short lifetime what the race has needed slow, tortured  ages to attain. The dice have been loaded by all the successes which  have preceded.    Stimuli conducive to economical and effective response, such as our  system of roads and means of transportation, our ready command of heat,  light, and electricity, our ready-made machines and apparatus for every  purpose, do not, by themselves or in their aggregate, constitute a  civilization. But the uses to which they are put are civilization,  and without the things the uses would be impossible. Time otherwise  necessarily devoted to wresting a livelihood from a grudging environment  and securing a precarious protection against its inclemencies is  freed. A body of knowledge is transmitted, the legitimacy of which  is guaranteed by the fact that the physical equipment in which it is  incarnated leads to"]]]
