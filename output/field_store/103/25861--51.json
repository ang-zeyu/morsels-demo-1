Fuerteventura is twenty-seven hundred feet high, and  in fine weather is visible many leagues away.    The wind freshened in the night, and the _Spray_ had a fine run  through the channel. By daylight, September 3, she was twenty-five  miles clear of all the islands, when a calm ensued, which was the  precursor of another gale of wind that soon came on, bringing with it  dust from the African shore. It howled dismally while it lasted, and  though it was not the season of the harmattan, the sea in the course  of an hour was discolored with a reddish-brown dust. The air remained  thick with flying dust all the afternoon, but the wind, veering  northwest at night, swept it back to land, and afforded the _Spray_  once more a clear sky. Her mast now bent under a strong, steady  pressure, and her bellying sail swept the sea as she rolled scuppers  under, courtesying to the waves. These rolling waves thrilled me as  they tossed my ship, passing quickly under her keel. This was grand  sailing.    September 4, the wind, still fresh, blew from the north-northeast, and  the sea surged along with the sloop. About noon a steamship, a  bullock-droger, from the river Plate hove in sight, steering  northeast, and making bad weather of it. I signaled her, but got no  answer. She was plunging into the head sea and rolling in a most  astonishing manner, and from the way she yawed one might have said  that a wild steer was at the helm.    On the morning of September 6 I found three flying-fish on deck, and a  fourth one down the fore-scuttle as close as possible to the  frying-pan. It was the best haul yet, and afforded me a sumptuous  breakfast and dinner.    The _Spray_ had now settled down to the tradewinds and to the business  of her voyage. Later in the day another droger hove in sight, rolling  as badly as her predecessor. I threw out no flag to this one, but got  the worst of it for passing under her lee. She was, indeed, a stale  one! And the poor cattle, how they bellowed! The time was when ships  passing one another at sea backed their topsails and had a \"gam,\" and  on parting fired guns; but those good old days have gone. People have  hardly time nowadays to speak even on the broad ocean, where news is  news, and as for a salute of guns, they cannot afford the powder.  There are no poetry-enshrined freighters on the sea now; it is a prosy  life when we have no time to bid one another good morning.    My ship, running now in the full swing of the trades, left me days to  myself for rest and recuperation. I employed the time in reading and  writing, or in whatever I found to do about the rigging and the sails  to keep them all in order. The cooking was always done quickly, and  was a small matter, as the bill of fare consisted mostly of  flying-fish, hot biscuits and butter, potatoes, coffee and  cream--dishes readily prepared.    On September 10 the _Spray_ passed the island of St. Antonio, the  northwesternmost of the Cape Verdes, close aboard. The landfall was  wonderfully true, considering that no observations for longitude had  been made. The wind, northeast, as the sloop drew by the island, was  very squally, but I reefed her sails snug, and steered broad from the  highland of blustering St. Antonio. Then leaving the Cape Verde  Islands out of sight astern, I found myself once more sailing a lonely  sea and in a solitude supreme all around. When I slept I dreamed that  I was alone. This feeling never left me; but, sleeping or waking, I  seemed always to know the position of the sloop, and I saw my vessel  moving across the chart, which became a picture before me.    One night while I sat in the cabin under this spell, the profound  stillness all about was broken by human voices alongside! I sprang  instantly to the deck, startled beyond my power to tell. Passing close  under lee, like an apparition, was a white bark under full sail. The  sailors on board of her were hauling on ropes to brace the yards,  which just cleared the sloop's mast as she swept by. No one hailed  from the white-winged flier, but I heard some one on board say that he  saw lights on the sloop, and that he made her out to be a fisherman. I  sat long on the starlit deck that night, thinking of ships, and  watching the constellations on their voyage.    On the following day, September 13, a large four-masted ship passed  some distance to windward, heading north.    The sloop was now rapidly drawing toward the region of doldrums, and  the force of the trade-winds was lessening. I could see by the ripples  that a counter-current had set in. This I estimated to be about  sixteen miles a day. In the heart of the counter-stream the rate was  more than that setting eastward.    September 14 a lofty three-masted ship, heading north, was seen from  the masthead. Neither this ship nor the one seen yesterday was within  signal distance, yet it was good even to see them. On the following  day heavy rain-clouds rose in the south, obscuring the sun; this was  ominous of doldrums. On the 16th the _Spray_ entered this gloomy  region, to battle with squalls and to be harassed by fitful calms; for  this is the state of the elements between the northeast and the  southeast trades, where each wind, struggling in turn for mastery,  expends its force whirling about in all directions. Making this still  more trying to one's nerve and patience, the sea was tossed into  confused cross-lumps and fretted by eddying currents. As if something  more were needed to complete a sailor's discomfort in this state, the  rain poured down in torrents day and night. The _Spray_ struggled and  tossed for ten days, making only three hundred miles on her course in  all that time. I didn't say anything!    On September 23 the fine schooner _Nantasket_ of Boston, from Bear  River, for the river Plate, lumber-laden, and just through the  doldrums, came up with the _Spray_, and her captain passing a few  words, she sailed on. Being much fouled on the bottom by shell-fish,  she drew along with her fishes which had been following the _Spray_,  which was less provided with that sort of food. Fishes will always  follow a foul ship. A barnacle-grown log adrift has the same  attraction for deep-sea fishes. One of this little school of deserters  was a dolphin that had followed the _Spray_ about a thousand miles,  and had been content to eat scraps of food thrown overboard from my  table; for, having been wounded, it could not dart through the sea to  prey on other fishes. I had become accustomed to seeing the dolphin,  which I knew by its scars, and missed it whenever it took occasional  excursions away from the sloop. One day, after it had been off some  hours, it returned in company with three yellowtails, a sort of cousin  to the dolphin. This little school kept together, except when in  danger and when foraging about the sea. Their lives were often  threatened by hungry sharks that came round the vessel, and more than  once they had narrow escapes. Their mode of escape interested me  greatly, and I passed hours watching them. They would dart away, each  in a different direction, so that the wolf of the sea, the shark,  pursuing one, would be led away from the others; then after a while  they would all return and rendezvous under one side or the other of  the sloop. Twice their pursuers were diverted by a tin pan, which I  towed astern of the sloop, and which was mistaken for a bright fish;  and while turning, in the peculiar way that sharks have when about to  devour their prey, I shot them through the head.    Their precarious life seemed to concern the yellowtails very little,  if at all. All living beings, without doubt, are afraid of death.  Nevertheless, some of the species I saw huddle together as though they  knew they were created for the larger fishes, and wished to give the  least possible trouble to their captors. I have seen, on the other  hand, whales swimming in a circle around a school of herrings, and  with mighty exertion \"bunching\" them together in a whirlpool set in  motion by their flukes, and when the small fry were all whirled nicely  together, one or the other of the leviathans, lunging through the  center with open jaws, take in a boat-load or so at a single mouthful.  Off the Cape of Good Hope I saw schools of sardines or other small  fish being treated in this way by great numbers of cavally-fish. There  was not the slightest chance of escape for the sardines, while the  cavally circled round and round, feeding from the edge of the mass. It  was interesting to note how rapidly the small fry disappeared; and  though it was repeated before my eyes over and over, I could hardly  perceive the capture of a single sardine, so dexterously was it done.    Along the equatorial limit of the southeast trade winds the air was  heavily charged with electricity, and there was much thunder and  lightning. It was hereabout I remembered that, a few years before, the  American ship _Alert_ was destroyed by lightning. Her people, by  wonderful good fortune, were rescued on the same day and brought to  Pernambuco, where I then met them.    On September 25, in the latitude of 5 degrees N., longitude 26 degrees  30' W., I spoke the ship _North Star_ of London. The great ship was  out forty-eight days from Norfolk, Virginia, and was bound for Rio,  where we met again about two months later. The _Spray_ was now thirty  days from Gibraltar.    The _Spray's_ next companion of the voyage was a swordfish, that swam  alongside, showing its tall fin out of the water, till I made a stir  for my harpoon, when it hauled its black flag down and disappeared.  September 30, at half-past eleven in the morning, the _Spray_ crossed  the equator in longitude 29 degrees 30' W. At noon she was two miles  south of the line. The southeast trade-winds, met, rather light, in  about 4 degrees N., gave her sails now a stiff full sending her  handsomely over the sea toward the coast of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6322"],[0,"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the (#9)"],[1,"we had intelligence  that only a few hours previously an English squadron had been seen  from the watch-tower of Sisarga, appearing to stand towards the  mouth of the Tagus. Those who saw our ship weigh anchor asserted  that we should be captured in three days, and that, forced to  follow the fate of the vessel, we should be carried to Lisbon. This  prognostic gave us the more uneasiness, as we had known some  Mexicans at Madrid, who, in order to return to Vera Cruz, had  embarked three times at Cadiz, and having been each time taken at  the entrance of the port, were at length obliged to return to Spain  through Portugal.    The Pizarro set sail at two in the afternoon. As the long and  narrow passage by which a ship sails from the port of Corunna opens  towards the north, and the wind was contrary, we made eight short  tacks, three of which were useless. A fresh tack was made, but very  slowly, and we were for some moments in danger at the foot of fort  St. Amarro, the current having driven us very near the rock, on  which the sea breaks with considerable violence. We remained with  our eyes fixed on the castle of St. Antonio, where the unfortunate  Malaspina was then a captive in a state prison. On the point of  leaving Europe to visit the countries which this illustrious  traveller had visited with so much advantage, I could have wished  to have fixed my thoughts on some object less affecting.    At half-past six we passed the Tower of Hercules, which is the  lighthouse of Corunna, as already mentioned, and where, from a very  remote time, a coal-fire has been kept up for the direction of  vessels. The light of this fire is in no way proportionate to the  noble construction of so vast an edifice, being so feeble that  ships cannot perceive it till they are in danger of striking on the  shore. Towards the close of day the wind increased and the sea ran  high. We directed our course to north-west, in order to avoid the  English frigates, which we supposed were cruising off these coasts.  About nine we spied the light of a fishing-hut at Sisarga, which  was the last object we beheld in the west of Europe.    On the 7th we were in the latitude of Cape Finisterre. The group of  granitic rocks, which forms part of this promontory, like that of  Torianes and Monte de Corcubion, bears the name of the Sierra de  Torinona. Cape Finisterre is lower than the neighbouring lands, but  the Torinona is visible at seventeen leagues' distance, which  proves that the elevation of its highest summit is not less than  300 toises (582 metres). Spanish navigators affirm that on these  coasts the magnetic variation differs extremely from that observed  at sea. M. Bory, it is true, in the voyage of the sloop Amaranth,  found in 1751, that the variation of the needle determined at the  Cape was four degrees less than could have been conjectured from  the observations made at the same period along the coasts. In the  same manner as the granite of Galicia contains tin disseminated in  its mass, that of Cape Finisterre probably contains micaceous iron.  In the mountains of the Upper Palatinate there are granitic rocks  in which crystals of micaceous iron take the place of common mica.    On the 8th, at sunset, we descried from the mast-head an English  convoy sailing along the coast, and steering towards south-east. In  order to avoid it we altered our course during the night. From this  moment no light was permitted in the great cabin, to prevent our  being seen at a distance. This precaution, which was at the time  prescribed in the regulations of the packet-ships of the Spanish  navy, was extremely irksome to us during the voyages we made in the  course of the five following years. We were constantly obliged to  make use of dark-lanterns to examine the temperature of the water,  or to read the divisions on the limb of the astronomical  instruments. In the torrid zone, where twilight lasts but a few  minutes, our operations ceased almost at six in the evening. This  state of things was so much the more vexatious to me as from the  nature of my constitution I never was subject to sea-sickness, and  feel an extreme ardour for study during the whole time I am at sea.    On the 9th of June, in latitude 39 degrees 50 minutes, and  longitude 16 degrees 10 minutes west of the meridian of the  observatory of Paris, we began to feel the effects of the great  current which from the Azores flows towards the straits of  Gibraltar and the Canary Islands. This current is commonly  attributed to that tendency towards the east, which the straits of  Gibraltar give to the waters of the Atlantic Ocean. M. de Fleurieu  observes that the Mediterranean, losing by evaporation more water  than the rivers can supply, causes a movement in the neighbouring  ocean, and that the influence of the straits is felt at the  distance of six hundred leagues. Without derogating from the  respect I entertain for the opinion of that celebrated navigator, I  may be permitted to consider this important object in a far more  general point of view.    When we cast our eyes over the Atlantic, or that deep valley which  divides the western coasts of Europe and Africa from the eastern  coasts of the new world, we distinguish a contrary direction in the  motion of the waters. Within the tropics, especially from the coast  of Senegal to the Caribbean Sea, the general current, that which  was earliest known to mariners, flows constantly from east to west.  This is called the equinoctial current. Its mean rapidity,  corresponding to different latitudes, is nearly the same in the  Atlantic and in the Pacific, and may be estimated at nine or ten  miles in twenty-four hours, consequently from 0.59 to 0.65 of a  foot every second! In those latitudes the waters run towards the  west with a velocity equal to a fourth of the rapidity of the  greater part of the larger rivers of Europe. The movement of the  ocean in a direction contrary to that of the rotation of the globe,  is probably connected with this last phenomenon only as far as the  rotation converts into trade winds* (* The limits of the trade  winds were, for the first time, determined by Dampier in 1666.) the  polar winds, which, in the low regions of the atmosphere bring back  the cold air of the high latitudes toward the equator. To the  general impulsion which these trade-winds give the surface of the  sea, we must attribute the equinoctial current, the force and  rapidity of which are not sensibly modified by the local variations  of the atmosphere.    In the channel which the Atlantic has dug between Guiana and  Guinea, on the meridian of 20 or 23 degrees, and from the 8th or  9th to the 2nd or 3rd degrees of northern latitude, where the  trade-winds are often interrupted by winds blowing from the south  and south-south-west, the equinoctial current is more inconstant in  its direction. Towards the coasts of Africa, vessels are drawn in  the direction of south-east; whilst towards the Bay of All Saints  and Cape St. Augustin, the coasts of which are dreaded by  navigators sailing towards the mouth of the Plata, the general  motion of the waters is masked by a particular current (the effects  of which extend from Cape St. Roche to the Isle of Trinidad)  running north-west with a mean velocity of a foot and a half every  second.    The equinoctial current is felt, though feebly, even beyond the  tropic of Cancer, in the 26th and 28th degrees of latitude. In the  vast basin of the Atlantic, at six or seven hundred leagues from  the coasts of Africa, vessels from Europe bound to the West Indies,  find their sailing accelerated before they reach the torrid zone.  More to the north, in 28 and 35 degrees, between the parallels of  Teneriffe and Ceuta, in 46 and 48 degrees of longitude, no constant  motion is observed: there, a zone of 140 leagues in breadth  separates the equinoctial current (the tendency of which is towards  the west) from that great mass of water which runs eastward, and is  distinguished for its extraordinary high temperature. To this mass  of waters, known by the name of the Gulf-stream,* (* Sir Francis  Drake observed this extraordinary movement of the waters, but he  was unacquainted with their high temperature.) the attention of  naturalists was directed in 1776 by the curious observations of  Franklin and Sir Charles Blagden.    The equinoctial current drives the waters of the Atlantic towards  the coasts inhabited by the Mosquito Indians, and towards the  shores of Honduras. The New Continent, stretching from south to  north, forms a sort of dyke to this current. The waters are carried  at first north-west, and passing into the Gulf of Mexico through  the strait formed by Cape Catoche and Cape St. Antonio, follow the  bendings of the Mexican coast, from Vera Cruz to the mouth of the  Rio del Norte, and thence to the mouths of the Mississippi, and the  shoals west of the southern extremity of Florida. Having made this  vast circuit west, north, east, and south, the current takes a new  direction northward, and throws itself with impetuosity into the  Gulf of Florida. At the end of the Gulf of Florida, in the parallel  of Cape Cannaveral, the Gulf-stream, or current of Florida, runs  north-east. Its rapidity resembles that of a torrent, and is  sometimes five miles an hour. The pilot may judge, with some  certainty, of the proximity of his approach to New York,  Philadelphia, or Charlestown when he reaches the edge of the  stream; for the elevated temperature of the waters, their saltness,  indigo-blue colour, and the shoals of seaweed which cover their  surface, as well as the heat of the surrounding atmosphere, all  indicate the Gulf-stream. Its rapidity diminishes towards the  north, at the same time that its breadth increases and the waters  become cool. Between Cayo Biscaino and the bank of Bahama the  breadth is only 15 leagues, whilst in the latitude of 28 1/2  degrees, it is 17, and in"]]]
