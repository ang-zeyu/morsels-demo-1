When the Pokeweed is \"all on fire with ripeness,\" as Thoreau said; when  the stout vigorous stem (which he coveted for a cane), the large leaves,  and even the footstalks, take on splendid tints of crimson lake, and the  dark berries hang heavy with juice in the thickets, then the birds, with  increased hungry families, gather in flocks as a preliminary step to  travelling southward. Has the brilliant, strong-scented plant no  ulterior motive in thus attracting their attention at this particular  time? Surely! Robins, flickers, and downy woodpeckers, chewinks and  rose-breasted grosbeaks, among other feathered agents, may be detected  in the act of gormandizing on the fruit, whose undigested seeds they  will disperse far and wide. Their droppings form the best of fertilizers  for young seedlings; therefore the plants which depend on birds to  distribute seeds, as most berry-bearers do, send their children abroad  to found new colonies, well equipped for a vigorous start in life. What  a hideous mockery to continue to call this fruit the Pigeon-berry, when  the exquisite bird whose favorite food it once was, has been annihilated  from this land of liberty by the fowler's net! And yet flocks of wild  pigeons, containing not thousands but millions of birds, nested here  even thirty years ago. When the market became glutted with them, they  were fed to hogs in the West!    Children, and some grown-ups, find the deep magenta juice of the  Ink-berry useful. Notwithstanding the poisonous properties of the root,  in some sections the young shoots are boiled and eaten like asparagus,  evidently with no disastrous consequences.          PINK FAMILY _(Caryophyllaceae)_      Common Chickweed    _Stellaria media (Alsine media)_    _Flowers_--Small, white, on slender pedicels from leaf axils, also in  terminal clusters. Calyx (usually) of 5 sepals, much longer than the 5  (usually) 2-parted petals; 2-10 stamens; 3 or 4 styles. _Stem:_ Weak,  branched, tufted, leafy, 4 to 6 in. long, a hairy fringe on one side.  _Leaves:_ Opposite, actually oval, lower ones petioled, upper ones  seated on stem.    _Preferred Habitat_--Moist, shady soil; woods; meadows.    _Flowering Season_--Throughout the year.    _Distribution_--Almost universal.    The sole use man has discovered for this often pestiferous weed with  which nature carpets moist soil the world around is to feed caged  song-birds. What is the secret of the insignificant little plant's  triumphal progress? Like most immigrants that have undergone ages of  selective struggle in the Old World, it successfully competes with our  native blossoms by readily adjusting itself to new conditions filling  places unoccupied, and chiefly by prolonging its season of bloom beyond  theirs, to get relief from the pressure of competition for insect trade  in the busy season. Except during the most cruel frosts, there is  scarcely a day in the year when we may not find the little star-like  chickweed flowers.      Corn Cockle; Corn Rose; Corn or Red Campion; Crown-of-the-Field    _Agrostemma Githago_    _Flowers_--Magenta or bright purplish crimson, 1 to 3 in. broad,  solitary at end of long, stout footstem; 5 lobes of calyx leaf-like,  very long and narrow, exceeding petals. Corolla of 5 broad, rounded  petals; 10 stamens; 5 styles alternating with calyx lobes, opposite  petals. _Stem,:_ 1 to 3 ft. high, erect, with few or no branches,  leafy, the plant covered with fine white hairs. _Leaves:_ Opposite,  seated on stem, long, narrow, pointed, erect. _Fruit:_ a 1-celled,  many-seeded capsule.    _Preferred Habitat_--Wheat and other grain fields; dry, waste places.    _Flowering Season_--July-September.    _Distribution_--United States at large; most common in Central and  Western states. Also in Europe and Asia.    \"Allons! allons! sow'd cockle, reap'd no corn,\" exclaims Byron in  \"Love's Labor's Lost.\" Evidently the farmers even in Shakespeare's day  counted this brilliant blossom the pest it has become in many of our own  grain fields just as it was in ancient times, when Job, after solemnly  protesting his righteousness, called on his own land to bear record  against him if his words were false. \"Let thistles grow instead of  wheat, and _cockle_ instead of barley,\" he cried, according to James the  First's translators; but the \"noisome weeds\" of the original text seem  to indicate that these good men were more anxious to give the English  people an adequate conception of Job's willingness to suffer for his  honor's sake than to translate literally. Possibly the cockle grew in  Southern Asia in Job's time: to-day its range is north.      Starry Campion    _Silene stellata_    _Flowers_--White, about 1/2 in. broad or over, loosely clustered in a  showy, pyramidal panicle. Calyx bell-shaped, swollen, 5-toothed, sticky;  5 fringed and clawed petals; 10 long, exserted stamens; 3 styles.  _Stem:_ Erect, leafy, 2 to 3-1/2 ft. tall, rough-hairy. _Leaves:_ Oval,  tapering to a point, 2 to 4 in. long, seated in whorls of 4 around  stem, or loose ones opposite.    _Preferred Habitat_--Woods, shady banks.    _Flowering Season_--June-August.    _Distribution_--Rhode Island westward to Mississippi, south to the  Carolinas and Arkansas.    Feathery white panicles of the Starry Campion, whose protruding stamens  and fringed petals give it a certain fleeciness, are dainty enough for  spring; by midsummer we expect plants of ranker growth and more gaudy  flowers. To save the nectar in each deep tube for the moths and  butterflies which cross-fertilize all this tribe of night and day  blossoms, most of them--and the campions are notorious examples--spread  their calices, and some their pedicels as well, with a sticky substance  to entrap little crawling pilferers. Although a popular name for the  genus is catchfly, it is usually the ant that is glued to the viscid  parts, for the fly that moves through the air alights directly on the  flower it is too short-lipped to suck. An ant catching its feet on the  miniature lime-twig, at first raises one foot after another and draws it  through its mouth, hoping to rid it of the sticky stuff, but only with  the result of gluing up its head and other parts of the body. In ten  minutes all the pathetic struggles are ended. Let no one guilty of  torturing flies to death on sticky paper condemn the Silenes!      Wild Pink or Catchfly    _Silene pennsylvanica (S. caroliniana)_    _Flowers_--Rose pink, deep or very pale; about 1 inch broad, on slender  footstalks, in terminal clusters. Calyx tubular, 5-toothed, much  enlarged in fruit, sticky; 5 petals with claws enclosed in calyx,  wedge-shaped above, slightly notched. Stamens 10; pistil with 3 styles.  _Stem:_ 4 to 10 in. high, hairy, sticky above, growing in tufts.  _Leaves:_ Basal ones spatulate; 2 or 3 pairs of lance-shaped, smaller  leaves seated on stem.    _Preferred Habitat_--Dry, gravelly, sandy, or rocky soil.    _Flowering Season_--April-June.    _Distribution_--New England, south to Georgia, westward to Kentucky.    Fresh, dainty, and innocent-looking as Spring herself are these bright  flowers. Alas, for the tiny creatures that try to climb up the rosy  tufts to pilfer nectar, they and their relatives are not so innocent as  they appear! While the little crawlers are almost within reach of the  cup of sweets, their feet are gummed to the viscid matter that coats it,  and here their struggles end as flies' do on sticky fly-paper, or birds'  on limed twigs. A naturalist counted sixty-two little corpses on the  sticky stem of a single pink. All this tragedy to protect a little  nectar for the butterflies which, in sipping it, transfer the pollen  from one flower to another, and so help them to produce the most  beautiful and robust offspring.      Soapwort; Bouncing Bet; Hedge Pink; Bruisewort; Old Maid's Pink;  Fuller's Herb    _Saponaria officinalis_    _Flowers_--Pink or whitish, fragrant, about 1 inch broad, loosely  clustered at end of stem, also sparingly from axils of upper leaves.  Calyx tubular, 5-toothed, about 3/4 in. long; 5 petals, the claws  inserted in deep tube. Stamens 10, in 2 sets; 1 pistil with 2 styles.  Flowers frequently double. _Stem:_ 1 to 2 ft. high, erect, stout,  sparingly branched, leafy. _Leaves:_ Opposite, acutely oval, 2 to 3 in.  long, about 1 in. wide, 3 to 5 ribbed. _Fruit:_ An oblong capsule,  shorter than calyx, opening at top by 4 short teeth or valves.    _Preferred Habitat_--Roadsides, banks, and waste places.    _Flowering Season_--June-September.    _Distribution_--Generally common. Naturalized from Europe.    A stout, buxom, exuberantly healthy lassie among flowers is Bouncing  Bet, who long ago escaped from gardens whither she was brought from  Europe, and ran wild beyond colonial farms to roadsides, along which she  has travelled over nearly our entire area. Underground runners and  abundant seed soon form thrifty colonies. This plant, to which our  grandmothers ascribed healing virtues, makes a cleansing, soap-like  lather when its bruised leaves are agitated in water.          PURSLANE FAMILY _(Portulacaceae)_      Spring Beauty; Claytonia    _Claytonia virginica_    _Flowers_--White veined with pink, or all pink, the veinings of deeper  shade, on curving, slender pedicels, several borne in a terminal loose  raceme, the flowers mostly turned one way (secund). Calyx of 2 ovate  sepals; corolla of 5 petals slightly united by their bases; 5 stamens,  1 inserted on base of each petal; the style 3-cleft. _Stem:_ Weak, 6 to  12 in. long, from a deep, tuberous root. _Leaves:_ Opposite above,  linear to lance-shaped, shorter than basal ones, which are 3 to 7 in.,  long; breadth variable.    _Preferred Habitat_--Moist woods, open groves, low meadows.    _Flowering Season_--March-May.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia and far westward, south to Georgia  and Texas.    Very early in the spring a race is run with the hepatica, arbutus,  adder's tongue, bloodroot, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8909"],[0,"The System of Nature, or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World. Volume 1 (#9)"],[1,", either acquire or lose: in short, they are  obliged to undergo continual variations in their essences, in their  properties, in their energies, in their masses, in their qualities, in  their mode of existence.    Animals, after they have been expanded in, and brought out of, the wombs  that are suitable to the elements of their machine, enlarge, strengthen,  acquire new properties, new energies, new faculties; either by deriving  nourishment from plants analogous to their being, or by devouring other  animals whose substance is suitable to their preservation; that is to  say, to repair the continual deperdition or loss of some portion of  their own substance, that is disengaging itself every instant. These  same animals are nourished, preserved, strengthened, and enlarged, by  the aid of air, water, earth, and fire. Deprived of air, or of the fluid  that surrounds them, that presses on them, that penetrates them, that  gives them their elasticity, they presently cease to live. Water,  combined with this air, enters into their whole mechanism of which  it facilitates the motion. Earth serves them for a basis, by giving  solidity to their texture: it is conveyed by air and water, which carry  it to those parts of the body with which it can combine. Fire itself,  disguised and enveloped under an infinity of forms, continually received  into the animal, procures him heat, continues him in life, renders him  capable of exercising his functions. The aliments, charged with these  various principles, entering into the stomach, re-establish the nervous  system, and restore, by their activity, and the elements which compose  them, the machine which begins to languish, to be depressed, by the loss  it has sustained. Forthwith the animal experiences a change in his  whole system; he has more energy, more activity; he feels more courage;  displays more gaiety; he acts, he moves, he thinks, after a different  manner; all his faculties are exercised with more ease. This igneous  matter, so congenial to generation--so restorative in its effect--so  necessary to life, was the JUPITER of the ancients: from all that has  preceded, it is clear, that what are called the elements, or primitive  parts of matter, variously combined, are, by the agency of motion,  continually united to, and assimilated with, the substance of  animals--that they visibly modify their being--have an evident influence  over their actions, that is to say, upon the motion they undergo,  whether visible or concealed.    The same elements, which under certain circumstances serve to nourish,  to strengthen, to maintain the animal, become, under others, the  principles of his weakness, the instruments of his dissolution--of his  death: they work his destruction, whenever they are not in that just  proportion which renders them proper to maintain his existence: thus,  when water becomes too abundant in the body of the animal, it enervates  him, it relaxes the fibres, and impedes the necessary action of the  other elements: thus, fire admitted in excess, excites in him disorderly  motion destructive of his machine: thus, air, charged with principles  not analogous to his mechanism, brings upon him dangerous diseases and  contagion. In fine, the aliments modified after certain modes, in the  room of nourishing, destroy the animal, and conduce to his ruin: the  animal is preserved no longer than these substances are analogous to his  system. They ruin him when they want that just equilibrium that renders  them suitable to maintain his existence.    Plants that serve to nourish and restore animals are themselves  nourished by earth; they expand on its bosom, enlarge and strengthen at  its expense, continually receiving into their texture, by their  roots and their pores, water, air, and igneous matter: water visibly  reanimates them whenever their vegetation or genus of life languishes;  it conveys to them those analogous principles by which they are enabled  to reach perfection: air is requisite to their expansion, and furnishes  them with water, earth, and the igneous matter with which it is charged.  By these means they receive more or less of the inflammable matter; the  different proportions of these principles, their numerous combinations,  from whence result an infinity of properties, a variety of forms,  constitute the various families and classes into which botanists have  distributed plants: it is thus we see the cedar and the hyssop develop  their growth; the one rises to the clouds, the other creep humbly on  the earth. Thus, by degrees, from an acorn springs the majestic oak,  accumulating, with time, its numerous branches, and overshadowing us  with its foliage. Thus, a grain of corn, after having drawn its own  nourishment from the juices of the earth, serves, in its turn, for  the nourishment of man, into whose system it conveys the elements or  principles by which it has been itself expanded, combined, and modified  in such a manner, as to render this vegetable proper to assimilate and  unite with the human frame; that is to say, with the fluids and solids  of which it is composed.    The same elements, the same principles, are found in the formation  of minerals, as well as in their decomposition, whether natural or  artificial. We find that earth, diversely modified, wrought, and  combined, serves to increase their bulk, and give them more or less  density and gravity. Air and water contribute to make their particles  cohere; the igneous matter, or inflammable principle, tinges them with  colour, and sometimes plainly indicates its presence, by the brilliant  scintillation which motion elicits from them. These stones and metals,  these bodies, so compact and solid, are disunited, are destroyed, by  the agency of air, water, and fire; which the most ordinary analysis is  sufficient to prove, as well as a multitude of experience, to which our  eyes are the daily evidence.    Animals, plants, and minerals, after a lapse of time, give back to  Nature; that is to say, to the general mass of things, to the universal  magazine, the elements, or principles, which they have borrowed: The  earth retakes that portion of the body of which it formed the basis  and the solidity; the air charges itself with these parts, that are,  analogous to it, and with those particles which are light and subtle;  water carries off that which is suitable to liquescency; fire, bursting  its chains, disengages itself, and rushes into new combinations with  other bodies.    The elementary particles of the animal, being thus dissolved, disunited,  and dispersed; assume new activity, and form new combinations: thus,  they serve to nourish, to preserve, or destroy new beings; among others,  plants, which arrived at their maturity, nourish and preserve new  animals; these in their turn yielding to the same fate as the first.    Such is the constant, the invariable course, of Nature; such is  the eternal circle of mutation, which all that exists is obliged  to describe. It is thus motion generates, preserves for a time, and  successively, destroys, one part of the universe by the other; whilst  the sum of existence remains eternally the same. Nature, by its  combinations, produces suns, which place themselves in the centre of  so many systems: she forms planets, which, by their peculiar essence,  gravitate and describe their revolutions round these suns: by degrees  the motion is changed altogether, and becomes eccentric: perhaps the day  may arrive when these wondrous masses will disperse, of which man, in  the short space of his existence, can only have a faint and transient  glimpse.    It is clear, then, that the continual motion inherent in matter, changes  and destroys all beings; every instant depriving them of some of their  properties, to substitute others: it is motion, which, in thus changing  their actual essence, changes also their order, their direction, their  tendency, and the laws which regulate their mode of acting and being:  from the stone formed in the bowels of the earth, by the intimate  combination and close coherence of similar and analogous particles, to  the sun, that vast reservoir of igneous particles, which sheds torrents  of light over the firmament; from the benumbed oyster, to the thoughtful  and active man; we see an uninterrupted progression, a perpetual chain  of motion and combination; from which is produced, beings that only  differ from each other by the variety of their elementary matter--by the  numerous combinations of these elements, from whence springs modes  of action and existence, diversified to infinity. In generation, in  nutrition, in preservation, we see nothing more than matter, variously  combined, of which each has its peculiar motion, regulated by fixed and  determinate laws, which oblige them to submit to necessary changes. We  shall find, in the formation, in the growth, in the instantaneous  life, of animals, vegetables, and minerals, nothing but matter; which  combining, accumulating, aggregating, and expanding by degrees, forms  beings, who are either feeling, living, vegetating, or else destitute  of these faculties; which, having existed some time under one particular  form, are obliged to contribute by their ruin to the production of other  forms.    Thus, to speak strictly, nothing in Nature is either born, or dies,  according to the common acceptation of those terms. This truth was  felt by many of the ancient philosophers. PLATO says, that according to  tradition, \"the living were born of the dead, the same as the dead did  come of the living; and that this is the constant routine of Nature.\" He  adds from himself, \"who knows, if to live, be not to die; and if to die,  be not to live?\" This was the doctrine of PYTHAGORAS, a man of great  talent and no less note. EMPEDOCLES asserts, \"there is neither birth nor  death, for any mortal; but only a combination, and a separation of that  which was combined, and that this "]]]
