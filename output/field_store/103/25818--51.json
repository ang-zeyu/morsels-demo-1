THE LANGUAGE OF FORM AND COLOUR        The man that hath no music in himself, Nor is not mov'd with  concord of sweet sounds, Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and  spoils; The motions of his spirit are dull as night, And his  affections dark as Erebus: Let no such man be trusted. Mark the  music. (The Merchant of Venice, Act v, Scene I.)    Musical sound acts directly on the soul and finds an echo there because,  though to varying extents, music is innate in man.    [Footnote: Cf. E. Jacques-Dalcroze in The Eurhythmics of  Jacques-Dalcroze. London, Constable.--M.T.H.S.]    \"Everyone knows that yellow, orange, and red suggest ideas of joy and  plenty\" (Delacroix). [Footnote: Cf. Paul Signac, D'Eugene Delacroix au  Neo-Impressionisme. Paris. Floury. Also compare an interesting article  by K. Schettler: \"Notizen uber die Farbe.\" (Decorative Kunst, 1901,  February).]    These two quotations show the deep relationship between the arts,  and especially between music and painting. Goethe said that  painting must count this relationship her main foundation, and by  this prophetic remark he seems to foretell the position in which  painting is today. She stands, in fact, at the first stage of the  road by which she will, according to her own possibilities, make  art an abstraction of thought and arrive finally at purely  artistic composition. [Footnote: By \"Komposition\" Kandinsky here  means, of course, an artistic creation. He is not referring to  the arrangement of the objects in a picture.--M.T.H.S.]    Painting has two weapons at her disposal:         1. Colour.       2. Form.    Form can stand alone as representing an object (either real or  otherwise) or as a purely abstract limit to a space or a surface.    Colour cannot stand alone; it cannot dispense with boundaries of some  kind. [Footnote: Cf. A. Wallace Rimington. Colour music (OP. CIT.) where  experiments are recounted with a colour organ, which gives symphonies of  rapidly changing colour without boundaries--except the unavoidable ones  of the white curtain on which the colours are reflected.--M.T.H.S.] A  never-ending extent of red can only be seen in the mind; when the word  red is heard, the colour is evoked without definite boundaries. If such  are necessary they have deliberately to be imagined. But such red, as is  seen by the mind and not by the eye, exercises at once a definite and an  indefinite impression on the soul, and produces spiritual harmony. I say  \"indefinite,\" because in itself it has no suggestion of warmth or cold,  such attributes having to be imagined for it afterwards, as  modifications of the original \"redness.\" I say \"definite,\" because the  spiritual harmony exists without any need for such subsequent attributes  of warmth or cold. An analogous case is the sound of a trumpet which one  hears when the word \"trumpet\" is pronounced. This sound is audible to  the soul, without the distinctive character of a trumpet heard in the  open air or in a room, played alone or with other instruments, in the  hands of a postilion, a huntsman, a soldier, or a professional musician.    But when red is presented in a material form (as in painting) it  must possess (1) some definite shade of the many shades of red  that exist and (2) a limited surface, divided off from the other  colours, which are undoubtedly there. The first of these  conditions (the subjective) is affected by the second (the  objective), for the neighbouring colours affect the shade of red.    This essential connection between colour and form brings us to  the question of the influences of form on colour. Form alone,  even though totally abstract and geometrical, has a power of  inner suggestion. A triangle (without the accessory consideration  of its being acute-or obtuse-angled or equilateral) has a  spiritual value of its own. In connection with other forms, this  value may be somewhat modified, but remains in quality the same.  The case is similar with a circle, a square, or any conceivable  geometrical figure. [Footnote: The angle at which the triangle  stands, and whether it is stationary or moving, are of importance  to its spiritual value. This fact is specially worthy of the  painter's consideration.] As above, with the red, we have here a  subjective substance in an objective shell.    The mutual influence of form and colour now becomes clear. A  yellow triangle, a blue circle, a green square, or a green  triangle, a yellow circle, a blue square--all these are different  and have different spiritual values.    It is evident that many colours are hampered and even nullified  in effect by many forms. On the whole, keen colours are well  suited by sharp forms (e.g., a yellow triangle), and soft, deep  colours by round forms (e.g., a blue circle). But it must be  remembered that an unsuitable combination of form and colour is  not necessarily discordant, but may, with manipulation, show the  way to fresh possibilities of harmony.    Since colours and forms are well-nigh innumerable, their  combination and their influences are likewise unending. The  material is inexhaustible.    Form, in the narrow sense, is nothing but the separating line  between surfaces of colour. That is its outer meaning. But it has  also an inner meaning, of varying intensity, [Footnote: It is  never literally true that any form is meaningless and \"says  nothing.\" Every form in the world says something. But its message  often fails to reach us, and even if it does, full understanding  is often withheld from us.] and, properly speaking, FORM IS THE  OUTWARD EXPRESSION OF THIS INNER MEANING. To use once more the  metaphor of the piano--the artist is the hand which, by playing  on this or that key (i.e., form), affects the human soul in this  or that way. SO IT IS EVIDENT THAT FORM-HARMONY MUST REST ONLY ON  A CORRESPONDING VIBRATION OF THE HUMAN SOUL; AND THIS IS A SECOND  GUIDING PRINCIPLE OF THE INNER NEED.    The two aspects of form just mentioned define its two aims. The  task of limiting surfaces (the outer aspect) is well performed if  the inner meaning is fully expressed.    [Footnote: The phrase \"full expression\" must be clearly  understood. Form often is most expressive when least coherent. It  is often most expressive when outwardly most imperfect, perhaps  only a stroke, a mere hint of outer meaning.]    The outer task may assume many different shapes; but it will  never fail in one of two purposes: (1) Either form aims at so  limiting surfaces as to fashion of them some material object; (2)  Or form remains abstract, describing only a non-material,  spiritual entity. Such non-material entities, with life and value  as such, are a circle, a triangle, a rhombus, a trapeze, etc.,  many of them so complicated as to have no mathematical  denomination.    Between these two extremes lie the innumerable forms in which  both elements exist; with a preponderance either of the abstract  or the material. These intermediate forms are, at present, the  store on which the artist has to draw. Purely abstract forms are  beyond the reach of the artist at present; they are too  indefinite for him. To limit himself to the purely indefinite  would be to rob himself of possibilities, to exclude the human  element and therefore to weaken his power of expression.    On the other hand, there exists equally no purely material form.  A material object cannot be absolutely reproduced. For good or  evil, the artist has eyes and hands, which are perhaps more  artistic than his intentions and refuse to aim at photography  alone. Many genuine artists, who cannot be content with a mere  inventory of material objects, seek to express the objects by  what was once called \"idealization,\" then \"selection,\" and which  tomorrow will again be called something different.    [Footnote: The motive of idealization is so to beautify the organic form  as to bring out its harmony and rouse poetic feeling. \"Selection\" aims  not so much at beautification as at emphasizing the character of the  object, by the omission of non-essentials. The desire of the future will  be purely the expression of the inner meaning. The organic form no  longer serves as direct object, but as the human words in which a divine  message must be written, in order for it to be comprehensible to human  minds.]    The impossibility and, in art, the uselessness of attempting to  copy an object exactly, the desire to give the object full  expression, are the impulses which drive the artist away from  \"literal\" colouring to purely artistic aims. And that brings us  to the question of composition. [Footnote: Here Kandinsky means  arrangement of the picture.--M.T.H.S.]    Pure artistic composition has two elements:    1. The composition of the whole picture.    2. The creation of the various forms which, by standing in  different relationships to each other, decide the composition of  the whole. [Footnote: The general composition will naturally  include many little compositions which may be antagonistic to  each other, though helping--perhaps by their very antagonism--the  harmony of the whole. These little compositions have themselves  subdivisions of varied inner meanings.] Many objects have to be  considered in the light of the whole, and so ordered as to suit  this whole. Singly they will have little meaning, being of  importance only in so far as they help the general effect. These  single objects must be fashioned in one way only; and this, not  because their own inner meaning demands that particular  fashioning, but entirely because they have to serve as building  material for the whole composition. [Footnote: A good example is  Cezanne's \"Bathing Women,\" which is built in the form of a  triangle. Such building is an old principle, which was being  abandoned only because academic usage had made it lifeless. But  Cezanne has given "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/533"],[0,"The Song of the Cardinal (#9)"],[1,"  vicinity of the sumac, and occasionally she took a bit from his beak,  though oftenest he was compelled to lay it on a limb beside her.  At  dusk she repeatedly dashed toward the underbrush; but the Cardinal,  with endless patience and tenderness, maneuvered her to the sumac,  until she gave up, and beneath the shelter of a neighbouring grapevine,  perched on a limb that was the Cardinal's own chosen resting-place,  tucked her tired head beneath her wing, and went to rest.  When she was  soundly sleeping, the Cardinal crept as closely as he dared, and with  one eye on his little gray love, and the other roving for any possible  danger, he spent a night of watching for any danger that might approach.    He was almost worn out; but this was infinitely better than the  previous night, at any rate, for now he not only knew where she was,  but she was fast asleep in his own favourite place.  Huddled on the  limb, the Cardinal gloated over her.  He found her beauty perfect.  To  be sure, she was dishevelled; but she could make her toilet.  There  were a few feathers gone; but they would grow speedily.  She made a  heart-satisfying picture, on which the Cardinal feasted his love-sick  soul, by the light of every straying moonbeam that slid around the  edges of the grape leaves.    Wave after wave of tender passion shook him.  In his throat half the  night he kept softly calling to her: \"Come here! Come here!\"    Next morning, when the robins announced day beside the shining river,  she awoke with a start; but before she could decide in which direction  to fly, she discovered a nice fresh grub laid on the limb close to her,  and very sensibly remained for breakfast.  Then the Cardinal went to  the river and bathed.  He made such delightful play of it, and the  splash of the water sounded so refreshing to the tired draggled bird,  that she could not resist venturing for a few dips.  When she was wet  she could not fly well, and he improved the opportunity to pull her  broken quills, help her dress herself, and bestow a few extra caresses.  He guided her to his favourite place for a sun bath; and followed the  farmer's plow in the corn field until he found a big sweet beetle.  He  snapped off its head, peeled the stiff wing shields, and daintily  offered it to her.  He was so delighted when she took it from his beak,  and remained in the sumac to eat it, that he established himself on an  adjoining thorn-bush, where the snowy blossoms of a wild morning-glory  made a fine background for his scarlet coat.  He sang the old pleading  song as he never had sung it before, for now there was a tinge of hope  battling with the fear in his heart.    Over and over he sang, rounding, fulling, swelling every note, leaning  toward her in coaxing tenderness, flashing his brilliant beauty as he  swayed and rocked, for her approval; and all that he had suffered and  all that he hoped for was in his song.  Just when his heart was growing  sick within him, his straining ear caught the faintest, most timid call  a lover ever answered.  Only one imploring, gentle \"Chook!\" from the  sumac!  His song broke in a suffocating burst of exultation.  Cautiously he hopped from twig to twig toward her.  With tender throaty  murmurings he slowly edged nearer, and wonder of wonders!  with tired  eyes and quivering wings, she reached him her beak for a kiss.    At dinner that day, the farmer said to his wife:    \"Maria, if you want to hear the prettiest singin', an' see the cutest  sight you ever saw, jest come down along the line fence an' watch the  antics o' that redbird we been hearin'.\"    \"I don't know as redbirds are so scarce 'at I've any call to wade  through slush a half-mile to see one,\" answered Maria.    \"Footin's pretty good along the line fence,\" said Abram, \"an' you never  saw a redbird like this fellow.  He's as big as any two common ones.  He's so red every bush he lights on looks like it was afire.  It's past  all question, he's been somebody's pet, an' he's taken me for the man.  I can get in six feet of him easy.  He's the finest bird I ever set  eyes on; an' as for singin', he's dropped the weather, an' he's askin'  folks to his housewarmin' to-day.  He's been there alone for a week,  an' his singin's been first-class; but to-day he's picked up a mate,  an' he's as tickled as ever I was.  I am really consarned for fear  he'll burst himself.\"    Maria sniffed.    \"Course, don't come if you're tired, honey,\" said the farmer.  \"I  thought maybe you'd enjoy it.  He's a-doin' me a power o' good.  My  joints are limbered up till I catch myself pretty near runnin', on the  up furrow, an' then, down towards the fence, I go slow so's to stay  near him as long as I can.\"    Maria stared.  \"Abram Johnson, have you gone daft?\" she demanded.    Abram chuckled.  \"Not a mite dafter'n you'll be, honey, once you set  eyes on the fellow.  Better come, if you can.  You're invited. He's  askin' the whole endurin' country to come.\"    Maria said nothing more; but she mentally decided she had no time to  fool with a bird, when there were housekeeping and spring sewing to do.  As she recalled Abram's enthusiastic praise of the singer, and had a  whiff of the odour-laden air as she passed from kitchen to  spring-house, she was compelled to admit that it was a temptation to  go; but she finished her noon work and resolutely sat down with her  needle.  She stitched industriously, her thread straightening with a  quick nervous sweep, learned through years of experience; and if her  eyes wandered riverward, and if she paused frequently with arrested  hand and listened intently, she did not realize it.  By two o'clock, a  spirit of unrest that demanded recognition had taken possession of her.  Setting her lips firmly, a scowl clouding her brow, she stitched on.  By half past two her hands dropped in her lap, Abram's new hickory  shirt slid to the floor, and she hesitatingly arose and crossed the  room to the closet, from which she took her overshoes, and set them by  the kitchen fire, to have them ready in case she wanted them.    \"Pshaw!\" she muttered, \"I got this shirt to finish this afternoon.  There's butter an' bakin' in the mornin', an' Mary Jane Simms is comin'  for a visit in the afternoon.\"    She returned to the window and took up the shirt, sewing with unusual  swiftness for the next half-hour; but by three she dropped it, and  opening the kitchen door, gazed toward the river.  Every intoxicating  delight of early spring was in the air.  The breeze that fanned her  cheek was laden with subtle perfume of pollen and the crisp fresh odour  of unfolding leaves.  Curling skyward, like a beckoning finger, went a  spiral of violet and gray smoke from the log heap Abram was burning;  and scattered over spaces of a mile were half a dozen others, telling a  story of the activity of his neighbours.  Like the low murmur of  distant music came the beating wings of hundreds of her bees, rimming  the water trough, insane with thirst.  On the wood-pile the guinea cock  clattered incessantly: \"Phut rack! Phut rack!\" Across the dooryard came  the old turkey-gobbler with fan tail and a rasping scrape of wing,  evincing his delight in spring and mating time by a series of explosive  snorts.  On the barnyard gate the old Shanghai was lustily challenging  to mortal combat one of his kind three miles across country.  From the  river arose the strident scream of her blue gander jealously guarding  his harem.  In the poultry-yard the hens made a noisy cackling party,  and the stable lot was filled with cattle bellowing for the freedom of  the meadow pasture, as yet scarcely ready for grazing.    It seemed to the little woman, hesitating in the doorway, as if all  nature had entered into a conspiracy to lure her from her work, and  just then, clear and imperious, arose the demand of the Cardinal: \"Come  here! Come here!\"    Blank amazement filled her face.  \"As I'm a livin' woman!\" she gasped.  \"He's changed his song!  That's what Abram meant by me bein' invited.  He's askin' folks to see his mate.  I'm goin'.\"    The dull red of excitement sprang into her cheeks.  She hurried on her  overshoes, and drew an old shawl over her head.  She crossed the  dooryard, followed the path through the orchard, and came to the lane.  Below the barn she turned back and attempted to cross. The mud was deep  and thick, and she lost an overshoe; but with the help of a stick she  pried it out, and replaced it.    \"Joke on me if I'd a-tumbled over in this mud,\" she muttered.    She entered the barn, and came out a minute later, carefully closing  and buttoning the door, and started down the line fence toward the  river.    Half-way across the field Abram saw her coming.  No need to recount how  often he had looked in that direction during the afternoon.  He slapped  the lines on the old gray's back and came tearing down the slope, his  eyes flashing, his cheeks red, his hands firmly gripping the plow that  rolled up a line of black mould as he passed.    Maria, staring at his flushed face and shining eyes, recognized that  his whole being proclaimed an inward exultation.    \"Abram Johnson,\" she solemnly demanded, \"have you got the power?\"    \"Yes,\" cried Abram, pulling off his old felt hat, and gazing into the  crown as if for inspiration.  \"You've said it, honey!  I got the power!  Got it of a little red bird! Power o' spring!  Power o' song!  Power o'  love!  If that poor little red target for some ornery cuss's bullet can  get all he's getting out o' life to-day, there's no cause why a  reasonin' thinkin' man shouldn't realize some o' his blessings.  You  hit it, Maria; I got the power.  It's the power o' God, but I learned  how to lay hold of it from that little red bird.  Come here, Maria!\"    Abram wrapped the lines around the plow handle, and cautiously led his  wife to the fence.  He found a piece of thick bark for her to stand on,  and placed her where she would be screened by a"]]]
