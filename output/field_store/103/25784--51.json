And if by purchase behold  you are blessed; and if by blood, _as you are forbidden to shed blood,  lo, your enemies are upon you, and ye shall be scourged from city to  city, and from synagogue to synagogue, and but few shall stand to  receive an inheritance_.\" [16]    About a month after this word, the Lord said: \"Behold the Lord  requireth the heart and a willing mind; and the willing and obedient  shall eat the good of the land of Zion in these last days; and the  rebellious shall be cut off out of the land of Zion, and shall be sent  away, and shall not inherit the land; for, verily, I say that the  rebellious are not of the blood of Ephraim, wherefore they shall be  plucked out.\" [17]    All this makes it very clear that while great things were promised  concerning the establishment of Zion and the glory that is to be hers,  yet all was predicated upon the faithfulness of the Saints in keeping  the commandments of the Lord--in purchasing the lands that constituted  the center place of Zion, and living upon them in all righteousness.    This they failed to do. In a revelation given in November, 1831, a  few months after the land had been dedicated unto the Lord for the  gathering of His people, He thus complained of those who had assembled  in western Missouri:    {XXXVII} \"And the inhabitants of Zion shall also observe the Sabbath  day to keep it holy. And the inhabitants of Zion also shall remember  their labors, inasmuch as they are appointed to labor, in all  faithfulness; for the idler shall be had in remembrance before the  Lord. Now, I, the Lord, am not well pleased with the inhabitants of  Zion, for there are idlers among them; and their children are also  growing up in wickedness; they also seek not earnestly the riches of  eternity, but their eyes are full of greediness. These things ought  not to be, and must be done away from among them: wherefore let my  servant, Oliver Cowdery carry these sayings unto the land of Zion. And  a commandment I give unto them, that he that observeth not his prayers  before the Lord in the season thereof, let him be had in remembrance  before the judge of my people. These sayings are true and faithful;  wherefore transgress them not, neither take therefrom.\" [18]    In addition to these evils there were jealousies and bickerings among  some of the brethren in Zion, and also between some of the Elders in  Zion, and leading Elders in Kirtland. In the spring of 1832 the Prophet  visited the Saints in Jackson county, and there were reconciliations  among the brethren, and forgiveness of sins obtained from the Lord;  [19] but shortly after the Prophet's departure for Kirtland these ill  feelings broke out again with renewed bitterness; carelessness as  to keeping the commandments of God characterized the conduct of the  Saints in Zion, and there arose some confusion also in the government  of the Church there, owing to conflicting claims of authority between  traveling Elders and the standing ministry in the branches of the  Church. This led to the following reproof from the Lord in a revelation  given on the 22nd and 23rd of September, 1832:    \"And your minds in times past have been darkened because of unbelief,  and because you have treated lightly the things you have received,  which vanity and unbelief hath brought the whole Church under  condemnation. And this condemnation resteth upon the children of Zion,  even all: and they shall remain under this condemnation until they  repent and remember the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon, and the  former commandments which I have given them, [20] not only to say, but  to do according to that which I have written, that they may bring forth  fruit meet for their Father's kingdom, _otherwise there remaineth a  scourge and a judgment to be poured out upon the children of Zion_: for  shall the children of the kingdom pollute my holy land? Verily, I say  unto you, Nay.\" [21]    When this revelation, given early in January, 1833, was sent to the  Elders in Zion, it was accompanied also by a letter from the Prophet  sharply reproving the brethren and Saints in Zion, in which the  following passage occurs:    \"Let me say unto you, seek to purify yourselves, and also the  inhabitants of Zion, lest the Lord's anger be kindled to fierceness.  _Repent repent, it is the voice of God to Zion_; and strange as it may  appear, yet it is true, mankind will persist in self-justification  until all their iniquity is exposed, and their character past being  redeemed, and that which is treasured up in their hearts be exposed  to the gaze of mankind. I say to you (and what I say to you, I say to  all), hear the warning voice of God, _lest Zion fall, and the Lord  swear in His wrath, 'The inhabitants of Zion shall not enter into my  rest_.'\" [22]    Hyrum Smith and Orson Hyde were appointed by a Council of the High  Priests in Kirtland at this time, to write a letter of reproof and  warning to the brethren in Zion. In this communication the conduct of  the Saints in Zion was reviewed in great plainness. The whole spirit of  the communication may be judged by the following paragraph:    \"We feel more like weeping over Zion than rejoicing over her, _for we  know that the judgments of God hang over her, and will fall upon her  except she repent_, and purify herself before the Lord, and put away  from her every foul spirit. We now say to Zion, this once, in the  name of the Lord, Repent! repent! awake! awake! put on thy beautiful  garments, before you are made to feel the chastening rod of Him whose  anger is kindled against you. Let not Satan tempt you to think we want  to make you bow to us, to domineer over you, for God knows this is not  the case; our eyes are watered with tears, and our hearts are poured  out to God in prayer for you, that He will spare you, and turn away His  anger from you. * * * Therefore, with the feelings of inexpressible  anxiety for your welfare, we say again Repent, repent, _or Zion must  suffer, for the scourge and judgment must come upon her_.\" [23]    All this reproof and warning, however, only produced a partial  repentance, and in July following acts of violence began to be  perpetrated upon the Saints by the old settlers of Missouri, and in the  month of November, under circumstances of great cruelty, all the Saints  were driven from Jackson county, and later more than two hundred of  their homes, together with their public improvements, were destroyed.    When the Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph why this affliction had  befallen the people, He said: \"Verily I say unto you concerning your  {XXXIX} brethren who have been afflicted, and persecuted, and cast  out from the land of their inheritance, I, the Lord, have suffered  the affliction to come upon them wherewith they have been afflicted,  in consequence of their transgressions; yet I will own them, and they  shall be mine in that day when I shall come to make up my jewels.  Therefore, they must needs be chastened and tried, even as Abraham,  who was commanded to offer up his only son; for all those who will  not endure chastening, but deny me, cannot be sanctified. Behold, I  say unto you, there were jarrings, and contentions, and envyings,  and strifes and lustful and covetous desires among them; therefore,  by these things they polluted their inheritances. They were slow to  hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God, therefore the Lord their  God is slow to hearken unto their prayers, to answer them in the day  of their trouble. In the day of their peace they esteemed lightly my  counsel; but in the day of their trouble, of necessity they feel after  me. Verily I say unto you, notwithstanding their sins my bowels are  filled with compassion towards them; I will not utterly cast them off;  and in the day of wrath I will remember mercy.\" [24]    From this it is very clear that the reason why the Saints were  prevailed against by their enemies and driven from the center place of  Zion, was because of their failure to live up to the high requirements  made of them by the Lord. In subsequent efforts to redeem Zion, by  attempting to return the exiles to Jackson county, the Saints in all  parts of the land again failed to respond with sufficient promptness  and fulness to the requirements of the Lord, for He commanded them  again to consecrate money to purchase lands in Jackson county and in  the counties round about, saying to the Church: \"There is even now  already in store a sufficient, yea even abundance, to redeem Zion,  and establish her waste places, no more to be thrown down, were the  churches who call themselves after my name willing to hearken to my  voice.\" [25]    The Lord also commanded them to gather up their forces and to go in  sufficient strength to possess the land, and maintain their inheritance  against their enemies. This, however, they failed to do. Instead of  raising five hundred men, as they were commanded to do, [26] they  started from Kirtland in \"Zion's Camp\" with a company of only about  one hundred and thirty men, and twenty baggage wagons. This number  was increased by additions _en route_ to one hundred and eighty-two  men, but even this number fell far short of the strength required to  accomplish the purpose for which the camp was organized. In the matter  of {XL} raising money for the purchase of lands the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47708"],[0,"Biography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow (#9)"],[1,"State's warrant, but fortunately for him he was placed in the custody  of Luke Johnson, who, although one of the apostates, was averse to the  bitter spirit of persecution which characterized others. Naturally of  a jovial turn, he was more inclined to ridicule than hostility. Having  been somewhat conversant with law usages, he volunteered his services  as legal adviser for Father Smith, although his custodian. He privately  told Father Smith's friends that the suit was instigated through  malice--that he knew Father Smith was innocent, and he was determined  to do all he could for him; and he was true to his word.    A room adjoining the one in which the court was in session, was lighted  by one window. Before Father Smith was brought for trial, Mr. Johnson  had examined the premises, and under the aforesaid window, on the  outside, he had cautiously made preparation so that the old gentleman  could reach the ground without injury. Before the court proceeded  to business, Mr. Johnson said he would like a few minutes private  conversation with his client. Permission was granted for him to take  the prisoner into the room aforementioned. When in, he drew the nail  which was the only fastening to the window--raised the window, and said  to Father Smith, \"Go right up to Esquire Snow's--he is a quiet man, and  no one will think of going there for you.\" The old gentleman did his  bidding, and came directly to our father's, who had purchased a home in  Kirtland, and was living a mile and a quarter distant from the court  scene; when he arrived, it was nearly midnight.    Mr. Johnson replaced the nail in the window, and, after giving Father  Smith time to clear the premises, proceeded to the court room, where  he soon discovered that his client had not followed him; whereupon he  hurried back to the room to see what was detaining him. After hunting  about there a short time, he came back to the court room, apparently  very much disconcerted, and reported the unaccountable fact that the  prisoner was not to be found. After close search by those present,  who found the nail fastening in the window all right, the question  was, \"How did he make his escape?\" The constable, who manifested the  greatest astonishment of all present, finally settled the question by  saying, \"It is another Mormon miracle.\"    Father Smith remained between two and three weeks at our father's  house, \"hid up\" from his enemies; but during the time, with the  legal assistance of the justice of the peace (an honorable Gentile),  he arranged his business matters preparatory to leaving for the  west. Before he left, he was joined by six others, whose lives were  threatened by apostates.    Before closing this subject, I think a further notice is due the  unantagonistic apostate, Luke Johnson. I happened to meet him the day  after the scene in the court room--he enquired after his released  prisoner, and after hearing that he reached his destination all right,  he, in a jocose manner, related the foregoing circumstances, and closed  with, \"Father Smith will bless me for it, all the days of his life.\" To  which, when I repeated it to Father Smith on my return home, he replied  in the affirmative; and Luke Johnson is the only one of those five  Apostles that returned to the Church. He was re-baptized, and lived a  faithful member--was much respected, and died an honorable death in the  midst of his friends, in Salt Lake City.        Chapter V.

Towards the last of April, 1838, our father left Kirtland with  twenty-one souls in company, to wit: his own family, consisting of his  wife, two daughters, three sons, and two grand-daughters, children of  our eldest sister who was at this time a widow; Brother Huntington and  family; Brother James Moses and family; Brother Pearce and family,  and Julian Moses, brother to James. We started with horse and ox teams,  my brother Lorenzo having charge of one of our father's teams, which he  drove until about one hundred miles from Far West, Missouri, when he  was taken very sick with bilious fever.    On our first night out from Kirtland, our whole company stopped,  in accordance with a previous pressing invitation, with one of our  father's sisters, Mrs. Charlotte S. Granger. Had we been a bridal  party we could not have been treated with more respect, or served more  bountifully, although we were \"Mormons\" and she a popular Presbyterian.  She was too noble minded to be a bigot. She and her husband are dead.  Lorenzo has been baptized for her husband--I for her, and we have had  the sealing ordinances performed in their behalf.    Our journey from Kirtland to Far West was rendered tedious in  consequence of rainy weather. We arrived in Far West on the sixteenth  of July, with my brother very sick in bed. For nearly one hundred miles  he suffered such a racking pain in his head that when we traveled I  held it as steady as possible to prevent excruciating suffering being  produced by the motion of the wagon. On our arrival in Far West, Elder  Rigdon met us and requested our father to take my sick brother to his  house, which was gratefully accepted, and I was to stop with him, as  Adam-ondi-Ahman, thirty miles distant, was father's destination; and  as he had considerable stock which he could not keep in Far West, he  started out the next morning, to return for us when Lorenzo should have  so far recovered as to be able to ride that distance. Dr. Avord, who  afterwards made himself notorious as an unscrupulous apostate, spent  most of his time sitting under an awning in front of Elder Rigdon's  house, and as I was under the necessity of obtaining some medicine for  my brother, as a matter of convenience I applied to him, at the same  time endeavoring to make him understand that it was the medicine  I wanted, and not his medical attendance; but come he would, and  continued to come. My brother grew worse--the fever increased until he  became quite delirious, and I determined to get rid of Avord, and to  accomplish this desirable yet disagreeable task, I asked him for his  bill as kindly and politely as possible. The idea struck him at once  that this request signified non-attendance, and he was very angry and  tried to frighten me concerning my brother's condition, by telling me  that his skill was needed more then than when he first saw the patient.  I tried to be as pacific as possible, but thought that this concession  did not recommend him to further attendance. However, when the doctor  found me unyielding, he presented his bill, and although sitting in  front of the house day after day, he neither called in to see nor  inquire after the sick man. I realized that the family of Elder Rigdon,  himself included, at that time had more faith in medical treatment  than in the healing ordinances, and they all thought me to blame  for discharging the physician. But my trust was in God, the prayer  of faith, and good, sisterly nursing. As soon as the fever abated,  my brother's consciousness returned, and in two weeks from the time  father left us he was sufficiently restored, was sent for, and we took  a pleasant wagon ride to Adam-ondi-Ahman, Daviess County, although my  brother had to ride on a bed.    I will here mention one little incident with which convalescents, many  of them, will sympathize. As his fever began to break, my brother tried  to think of something he could relish, and his memory went back to  college associations and college scenes, and to one college _dish_. At  one time while attending college, he and three of his fellow students  took it into their heads to try the novelty of bachelor boarding, each  taking his turn in the cooking department. One particular dish, which  at that time was relished very exquisitely, now haunted my brother's  recollection--if he had a dish precisely like that he felt certain he  could eat. His sister at that time, was his only nurse and night  watcher, for the people of the house were so displeased with me for  discharging the doctor that they were but little disposed to assist,  and I was as little disposed to trouble them, although in every other  respect they were hospitable and kind, and in fact for years had been  quite partial to our family. But the dish; it must be precisely after  the pattern, and could I do it? Certainly; for \"what has been done can  be done,\" and I am not afraid to try. The ingredients, as he named  them, were all at my command, and, after listening anxiously to his  description, I went to work and a dish was produced, but alas! it  was not THE dish--\"it did not _taste_ like the bachelor dish.\" Try,  try again, was my motto, and after listening attentively to a more  critical description, I went at it again, and although that effort  was a pronounced improvement on the first, it was not quite up to the  original, but the third time trying proved a success--not so much from  improvement in the skill of the cook as improvement in the appetite of  the patient.    The following is copied from his journal: In Adam-ondi-Ahman, while  gradually recovering from the effects of a malignant fever which had  detained me a fortnight in Far West, under the constant and skilful  nursing of my sister Eliza, for some time I was unable to either do, or  read much. One day, to while away the slowly passing hours, I took my  gun with the intention of indulging in a little amusement in hunting  turkeys, with which that section of the country abounded. From boyhood  I had been particularly, and I may say strangely "]]]
