[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6687"],[0,"From the Caves and Jungles of Hindostan (#9)"],[1," said Gulab-Lal-Sing, \"you behold the  majestic Bhao Mallin. That deserted spot was once the abode of a holy  hermit; now it is visited yearly by crowds of pilgrims. According to  popular belief the most wonderful things happen there--miracles. At the  top of the mountain, two thousand feet above the level of the sea, is  the platform of a fortress. Behind it rises another rock two hundred and  seventy feet in height, and at the very summit of this peak are to be  found the ruins of a still more ancient fortress, which for seventy-five  years served as a shelter for this hermit. Whence he obtained his food  will for ever remain a mystery. Some think he ate the roots of wild  plants, but upon this barren rock there is no vegetation. The only mode  of ascent of this perpendicular mountain consists of a rope, and holes,  just big enough to receive the toes of a man, cut out of the living  rock. One would think such a pathway accessible only to acrobats and  monkeys. Surely fanaticism must provide wings for the Hindus, for no  accident has ever happened to any of them. Unfortunately, about forty  years ago, a party of Englishmen conceived the unhappy thought of  exploring the ruins, but a strong gust of wind arose and carried them  over the precipice. After this, General Dickinson gave orders for the  destruction of all means of communication with the upper fortress, and  the lower one, once the cause of so many losses and so much bloodshed,  is now entirely deserted, and serves only as a shelter for eagles and  tigers.\"    Listening to these tales of olden times, I could not help comparing the  past with the present. What a difference!    \"Kali-Yug!\" cry old Hindus with grim despair. \"Who can strive against  the Age of Darkness?\"    This fatalism, the certainty that nothing good can be expected now, the  conviction that even the powerful god Shiva himself can neither appear  nor help them are all deeply rooted in the minds of the old generation.  As for the younger men, they receive their education in high schools and  universities, learn by heart Herbert Spencer, John Stuart Mill, Darwin  and the German philosophers, and entirely lose all respect, not only for  their own religion, but for every other in the world.    The young \"educated\" Hindus are materialists almost without exception,  and often achieve the last limits of Atheism. They seldom hope to attain  to anything better than a situation as \"chief mate of the junior clerk,\"  as we say in Russia, and either become sycophants, disgusting flatterers  of their present lords, or, which is still worse, or at any rate  sillier, begin to edit a newspaper full of cheap liberalism, which  gradually develops into a revolutionary organ.    But all this is only en passant. Compared with the mysterious and  grandiose past of India, the ancient Aryavarta, her present is a  natural Indian ink background, the black shadow of a bright picture, the  inevitable evil in the cycle of every nation. India has become decrepit  and has fallen down, like a huge memorial of antiquity, prostrate and  broken to pieces. But the most insignificant of these fragments will for  ever remain a treasure for the archeologist and the artist, and, in  the course of time, may even afford a clue to the philosopher and the  psychologist. \"Ancient Hindus built like giants and finished their work  like goldsmiths,\" says Archbishop Heber, describing his travel in India.  In his description of the Taj-Mahal of Agra, that veritable eighth  wonder of the world, he calls it \"a poem in marble.\" He might have added  that it is difficult to find in India a ruin, in the least state of  preservation, that cannot speak, more eloquently than whole volumes, of  the past of India, her religious aspirations, her beliefs and hopes.    There is not a country of antiquity, not even excluding the Egypt of  the Pharaohs, where the development of the subjective ideal into  its demonstration by an objective symbol has been expressed more  graphically, more skillfully, and artistically, than in India. The whole  pantheism of the Vedanta is contained in the symbol of the bisexual  deity Ardhanari. It is surrounded by the double triangle, known in India  under the name of the sign of Vishnu. By his side lie a lion, a bull,  and an eagle. In his hands there rests a full moon, which is reflected  in the waters at his feet. The Vedanta has taught for thousands of years  what some of the German philosophers began to preach at the end of last  century and the beginning of this one, namely, that everything objective  in the world, as well as the world itself, is no more than an illusion,  a Maya, a phantom created by our imagination, and as unreal as the  reflection of the moon upon the surface of the waters. The phenomenal  world, as well as the subjectivity of our conception concerning our  Egos, are nothing but, as it were, a mirage. The true sage will never  submit to the temptations of illusion. He is well aware that man will  attain to self-knowledge, and become a real Ego, only after the entire  union of the personal fragment with the All, thus becoming an immutable,  infinite, universal Brahma. Accordingly, he considers the whole cycle of  birth, life, old age, and death as the sole product of imagination.    Generally speaking, Indian philosophy, split up as it is into numerous  metaphysical teachings, possesses, when united to Indian ontological  doctrines, such a well developed logic, such a wonderfully refined  psychology, that it might well take the first rank when contrasted with  the schools, ancient and modern, idealist or positivist, and eclipse  them all in turn. That positivism expounded by Lewis, that makes each  particular hair on the heads of Oxford theologians stand on end,  is ridiculous child's play compared with the atomistic school of  Vaisheshika, with its world divided, like a chessboard, into six  categories of everlasting atoms, nine substances, twenty-four qualities,  and five motions. And, however difficult, and even impossible may  seem the exact representation of all these abstract ideas, idealistic,  pantheistic, and, sometimes, purely material, in the condensed shape of  allegorical symbols, India, nevertheless, has known how to express all  these teachings more or less successfully. She has immortalized them in  her ugly, four-headed idols, in the geometrical, complicated forms of  her temples, and even in the entangled lines and spots on the foreheads  of her sectaries.    We were discussing this and other topics with our Hindu  fellow-travellers when a Catholic padre, a teacher in the Jesuit College  of St. Xavier in Bombay, entered our carriage at one of the stations.  Soon he could contain himself no longer, and joined in our conversation.  Smiling and rubbing his hands, he said that he was curious to know  on the strength of what sophistry our companions could find anything  resembling a philosophical explanation \"in the fundamental idea of the  four faces of this ugly Shiva, crowned with snakes,\" pointing with his  finger to the idol at the entrance to a pagoda.    \"It is very simple,\" answered the Bengali Babu. \"You see that its four  faces are turned towards the four cardinal points, South, North, West,  and East--but all these faces are on one body and belong to one god.\"    \"Would you mind explaining first the philosophical idea of the four  faces and eight hands of your Shiva,\" interrupted the padre.    \"With great pleasure. Thinking that our great Rudra (the Vedic name  for this god) is omnipresent, we represent him with his face turned  simultaneously in all directions. Eight hands indicate his omnipotence,  and his single body serves to remind us that he is One, though he is  everywhere, and nobody can avoid his all-seeing eye, or his chastising  hand.\"    The padre was going to say something when the train stopped; we had  arrived at Narel.    It is hardly twenty-five years since, for the first time, a white man  ascended Mataran, a huge mass of various kinds of trap rock, for the  most part crystalline in form. Though quite near to Bombay, and only  a few miles from Khandala, the summer residence of the Europeans, the  threatening heights of this giant were long considered inaccessible. On  the north, its smooth, almost vertical face rises 2,450 feet over the  valley of the river Pen, and, further on, numberless separate rocks  and hillocks, covered with thick vegetation, and divided by valleys and  precipices, rise up to the clouds. In 1854, the railway pierced one of  the sides of Mataran, and now has reached the foot of the last mountain,  stopping at Narel, where, not long ago, there was nothing but a  precipice. From Narel to the upper plateau is but eight miles, which you  may travel on a pony, or in an open or closed palanquin, as you choose.    Considering that we arrived at Narel about six in the evening, this  course was not very tempting. Civilization has done much with inanimate  nature, but, in spite of all its despotism, it has not yet been able to  conquer tigers and snakes. Tigers, no doubt, are banished to the  more remote jungles, but all hinds of snakes, especially cobras and  coralillos, which last by preference inhabit trees, still abound in  the forests of Mataran as in days of old, and wage a regular guerilla  warfare against the invaders. Woe betide the belated pedestrian, or even  horseman, if he happens to pass under a tree which forms the ambuscade  of a coralillo snake! Cobras and other reptiles seldom attack men, and  will generally try to avoid them, unless accidentally trodden upon,  but these guerilleros of the forest, the tree serpents, lie in wait for  their victims. As soon as the head of a man comes under the branch which  shelters the coralillo, this enemy of man, coiling its tail round  the branch, dives down into space with all the length of is body, and  strikes with its fangs at the man's forehead. This curious fact was long"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6693"],[0,"People of Africa (#9)"],[1,"to read and write at home, and sometimes when they are big enough they  are sent away to school in some town.  There they will live with  children from many other parts of South Africa, and will learn that  their farm is only a little part of a very big country.  Europeans are  Christians, and the children are taught that they must love and help  their country and other people always.  It is because European  children are taught to be ready to give up everything, even their  lives, to help their country to be good and great, that the Christian  European nations have grown as strong and wise as they are.  The  countries of Europe learnt about Christ many hundreds of years ago.    We said that South Africa was ruled by Europeans.  Their king is King  George who lives in England, but he does not rule or make laws by  himself.  In South Africa and in each of his other countries, King  George sends a Governor, because he himself is so far away.  Then the  people of South Africa choose someone in each district to go and help  the Governor to rule wisely.  When all these men from different parts  meet together it is called a Parliament.  This Council or Parliament  decides everything about ruling the country, and tells the Governor  what it is best to do for all the people in South Africa.    So in thinking of South Africa we have to think of a nation of people,  each doing one particular kind of work which is needed both by himself  and by everyone else.  Everyone's work is useful to the whole nation,  whether he works in a town, or on a farm, or on a railway.  The great  towns are where people sell what they have made and buy what else they  need.  The farm families live far away from one another, growing food  or wool for the nation.  But they, too, meet from time to time, and  they read newspapers about what is done in the great towns.  Then,  when the time comes to choose the men for the Parliament to help the  Governor, farmers and townsmen in each district say which man they  wish to go to it.  In this way everyone can help the nation by his  work, and everyone can help to keep peace and justice in the country  and to prevent bad people hurting the weaker ones.                                     VIII                               -----------                                CONCLUSION    Now our book is finished, and we have read about some of the other  people who also live in our country of Africa.  There in the north are  the Bedouin and the traders, always moving from waterspring to  waterspring across the sand of the great Sahara, ever on the watch  against robbers.  Next there are the Egyptians living on the great  River Nile: some in towns with shops and trades; some very poor in the  villages, planting their seed when the river rises.  All these  Northern people are Mohammedans and the men marry several wives, and  the women are veiled and live apart.    Farther south it is very hot, and is a land of great lakes and rivers.  Here we read about the Baganda, the dark-skinned Africans who learned  to make a strong nation where all the people helped each other and  obeyed their king.  These are now Christian, and are quickly learning  other things from the Christian European nations who trade with them.  Then we read about the tribes farther west in the land of the River  Congo.  These people still move their villages from time to time, and  each man makes only what he needs in his own home.  There is often  fighting between the tribes, and many people are killed.  These Congo  people have learnt very little, and some eat the flesh of men and  women, and the little Pigmies do not even live in villages, but each  family by itself.    Farther south still is the great country of South Africa.  Here it is  not so hot, and Europeans have made their homes in it.  There are  Africans living in tribes and villages, but learning to be peaceful  and to help each other by their work.  Many of these at times go to  work in the mines to find useful things deep down in the ground.  There are also the Europeans: some in towns, some in farms, all  European and African bound together in the great nation of South  Africa, each doing his own part of the nation's work.    So that in this great land of Africa we have people living very  different kinds of life, in the deserts, in the forests of the Congo,  in Uganda and on the Nile, in the mines of South Africa, and on the  great farms on the veld and in the great towns.  The country itself is  different in different parts: the sand in the north; Central Africa,  with its hot sun and its lakes and rivers and mountains and forests;  South Africa, with its great grassy plains, and the mines and towns  joined by the railways which make it easy to get quickly to places far  away.  Yet, although the people of Africa have such different homes,  we must remember that they are very much like ourselves.  They wear  other clothes and speak other languages, but all love their families,  and each is doing his best to make his home a happy place in which he  can live.
