It is affirmed by the Iroquois that the confederacy was formed by a  council of wise men and chiefs of the five tribes which met for that  purpose on the north shore of Onondaga Lake, near the site of  Syracuse; and that before its session was concluded the organization  was perfected and set in immediate operation. At their periodical  councils for raising up sachems they still explain its origin as the  result of one protracted effort of legislation. It was probably a  consequence of a previous alliance for mutual defense, the  advantages of which they had perceived and which they sought to  render permanent.    The origin of the plan is ascribed to a mythical, or, at least,  traditionary person, Ha-yo-went-ha, the Hiawatha of Longfellow's  celebrated poem, who was present at this council and the central  person in its management. In his communications with the council he  used a wise man of the Onondagas, Da-ga-no-we'-da, as an interpreter  and speaker to expound the structure and principles of the proposed  confederacy. The same tradition further declares that when the work  was accomplished Ha-yo-went-ha miraculously disappeared in a white  canoe, which arose with him in the air and bore him out of their  sight. Other prodigies, according to this tradition, attended and  signalized the formation of the confederacy, which is still  celebrated among them as a masterpiece of Indian wisdom. Such in  truth it was; and it will remain in history as a monument of their  genius in developing gentile institutions. It will also be  remembered as an illustration of what tribes of mankind have been  able to accomplish in the art of government while in the Lower  Status of barbarism, and under the disadvantages this condition  implies.    Which of the two persona was the founder of the confederacy it is  difficult to determine. The silent Ha-yo-went'-ha was, not unlikely,  a real person of Iroquois lineage, but tradition has enveloped his  character so completely in the supernatural that he loses his place  among them as one of their number. If Hiawatha were a real person,  Da-ga-no-we'-da must hold a subordinate place; but if a mythical  person invoked for the occasion, then to the latter belongs the  credit of planning the confederacy. [Footnote: My friend Horatio Hale,  the eminent philologist, came, as he informed me, to this conclusion]    The Iroquois affirm that the confederacy, as formed by this council,  with its powers, functions, and mode of administration, has come  down to them through many generations to the present time with  scarcely a change in its internal organization. When the Tuscaroras  were subsequently admitted, their sachems were allowed by courtesy  to sit as equals in the general council, but the original number of  sachems was not increased, and in strictness those of the Tuscaroras  formed no part of the ruling body.    The general features of the Iroquois Confederacy may be summarized  in the following propositions:    I. The Confederacy was a union of Five Tribes, composed of common  gentes, under one government on the basis of equality; each Tribe  remaining independent in all matters pertaining to local  self-government.    II. It created a General Council of Sachems, who were limited in  number, equal in rank and authority, and invested with supreme  powers over all matters pertaining to the Confederacy.    III. Fifty Sachemships were created and named in perpetuity in  certain gentes of the several Tribes; with power in these gentes to  fill vacancies, as often as they occurred, by election from among  their respective members, and with the further power to depose from  office for cause; but the right to invest these Sachems with office  was reserved to the General Council.    IV. The Sachems of the Confederacy were also Sachems in their  respective Tribes, and with the Chiefs of these Tribes formed the  Council of each, which was supreme over all matters pertaining to  the Tribe exclusively.    V. Unanimity in the Council of the Confederacy was made essential to  every public act.    VI. In the General Council the Sachems voted by Tribes, which gave  to each Tribe a negative upon the others.    VII. The Council of each Tribe had power to convene the General  Council; but the latter had no power to convene itself.    VIII. The General Council was open to the orators of the people for  the discussion of public questions; but the Council alone decided.    IX. The Confederacy had no chief Executive Magistrate or official  head.    X. Experiencing the necessity for a General Military Commander, they  created the office in a dual form, that one might neutralize the  other. The two principal War-chiefs created were made equal in powers.    These several propositions will be considered and illustrated, but  without following the precise form or order in which they are stated.    At the institution of the confederacy fifty permanent sachemships  were created and named, and made perpetual in the gentes to which  they were assigned. With the exception of two, which were filled but  once, they have been held by as many different persons in succession  as generations have passed away between that time and the present.  The name of each sachemship is also the personal name of each sachem  while he holds the office each one in succession taking the name of  his predecessor. These sachems, when in session, formed the council  of the confederacy in which the legislative, executive, and judicial  powers were vested, although such a discrimination of functions had  not come to be made. To secure order in the succession, the several  gentes in which these offices were made hereditary were empowered to  elect successors from among their respective members when vacancies  occurred as elsewhere explained. As a further measure of protection  to their own body, each sachem, after his election and its  confirmation, was invested with his office by a council of the  confederacy. When thus installed his name was \"taken away\" and that  of the sachemship was bestowed upon him. By this name he was  afterwards known among them. They were all upon equality in rank  authority, and privileges.    These sachemships were distributed unequally among the five tribes;  but without giving to either a preponderance of power; and unequally  among the gentes of the last three tribes. The Mohawks had nine  sachems, the Oneidas nine, the Onondagas fourteen, the Cayugas ten,  and the Senecas eight. This was the number at first, and it has  remained the number to the present time. A table of these sachemships,  founded at the institution of the Confederacy with the names which  have been borne by their sachems in succession from its formation to  the present time, is subjoined, with their names in the Seneca  dialect, and their arrangement in classes to facilitate the  attainment of unanimity in council. In foot-notes will be found the  signification of these names, and the gentes to which they belonged:  [Footnote: These names signify as follows:]      Table of sachemships of the Iroquois.

Meanwhile news of the death of the wooers had run through the city. The  father of Antinous raised a tumult and led a body of armed men to demand  satisfaction. The threatening uproar was stopped by the intervention of  Athena who thus completed the restoration of her favourite as she had  begun it.           *       *       *       *       *    It is strange that this poem, which is such a favourite with modern  readers, should have made a less deep impression on the Greeks. To  them, Homer is nearly always the _Iliad_, possibly because Achilles was  semi-divine, whereas Odysseus was a mere mortal. But the latter is for  that very reason of more importance to us, we feel him to be more akin  to our own life. Further, the type of character which Odysseus stands  for is really far nobler than the fervid and somewhat incalculable  nature of the son of Thetis. Odysseus is patient endurance, common  sense, self-restraint, coolness, resource and strength; he is indeed  a manifold personality, far more complex than anything attempted  previously in Greek literature and therefore far more modern in  his appeal. It is only after reading the _Odyssey_ that we begin to  understand why Diomedes chose Odysseus as his companion in the famous  Dolon adventure in Noman's land. Achilles would have been the wrong man  for this or any other situation which demanded first and last a cool  head.    The romantic elements which are so necessary a part of all Epic are much  more convincing in the _Odyssey_; the actions and adventures are indeed  beyond experience, but they are treated in such a masterly style that  they are made inevitable; it would be difficult to improve on any of the  little details which force us to believe the whole story. Added to them  is another genuine romantic feature, the sense of wandering in strange  new lands untrodden before of man's foot; the beings who move in these  lands are gracious, barbarous, magical, monstrous, superhuman, dreamy,  or prophetic by turns; they are all different and all fascinating. The  reader is further introduced to the life of the dead as well as of the  living and the memory of his visit is one which he will retain for ever.  Not many stories of adventure can impress themselves indelibly as does  the _Odyssey_.    To English readers the poem has a special value, for it deals with the  sea and its wonders. The native land of its hero is not very unlike our  own, \"full of mist and rain\", yet able to make us love it far more than  a Calypso's isle with an offer of immortality to any who will exchange  his real love of home for an unnatural haven of peace. A splendid hero,  a good love-story, admirable narrative, romance and excitement, together  with a breath of the sea which gives plenty of space and pure air have  made the _Odyssey_ the companion of many a veteran reader in whom the  Greek spirit cannot die.           *       *       *       *       *    Of the impression which Homer has made upon the mind of Europe it would  be difficult to give an estimate. The Greeks themselves early came to  regard his text with a sort of veneration; it was learned by heart and  quoted to spellbound audiences in the cities and at the great national  meetings at Olympia. Every Greek boy was expected to know some portion  at least by heart; Plato evidently loved Homer and when he was obliged  to point out that the system of morality which he stood for was  antiquated and needed revision, apologised for the criticism he could  not avoid. It is sometimes said that Homer was the Bible of the Greeks;  while this statement is probably inaccurate--for no theological system  was built on him nor did he claim any divine revelation--yet it is  certain that authors of all ages searched the text for all kinds of  purposes, antiquarian, ethical, social, as well as religious. This  careful study of Homer culminated in the learned and accurate work of  the great Alexandrian school of Zenodotus and Aristarchus.    In Roman times Homer never failed to inspire lesser writers; Ennius  is said to have translated the _Odyssey_, while Virgil's _Aeneid_ is  clearly a child of the Greek Homeric tradition. In the Middle Ages the  Trojan legend was one of the four great cycles which were treated over  and over again in the Chansons. Even drama was glad to borrow the great  characters of the _Iliad_, as Shakespeare did in _Troilus and Cressida_.  In England a number of famous translations has witnessed to the undying  appeal of the first of the Greek masters. Chapman published his _Iliad_  in 1611, his _Odyssey_ in 1616; Pope's version appeared between 1715  and 1726; Cowper issued his translation in 1791. In the next century the  Earl Derby retranslated the _Iliad_, while an excellent prose version of  the _Odyssey_ by Butcher and Lang was followed by a prose version of the  _Iliad_ by Lang Myers and Leaf. At a time when Europe had succeeded in  persuading itself that the whole story of a siege of Troy was an obvious  myth, a series of startling discoveries on the site of Troy and on  the mainland of Greece proved how lamentably shallow is some of the  cleverest and most destructive Higher Criticism.    The marvellous rapidity and vigour of these two poems will save them  from death; the splendid qualities of direct narration, constructive  skill, dignity and poetical power will always make Homer a name to love.  Those who know no Greek and therefore fear that they may lose some of  the directness of the Homeric appeal might recall the famous sonnet  written by Keats who had had no opportunity to learn the great  language. His words are no doubt familiar enough; that they have become  inseparable from Homer must be our apology for inserting them here.      Much have I travelled in the realms of gold,    And many goodly states and Kingdoms seen;    Round many western islands have I been    Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.      Oft of one wide expanse had I been told    That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne:    Yet never did I breathe its pure serene    Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold.      Then felt I like some watcher of the skies    When a new planet swims into his ken,    Or like stout Cortes, when with eagle eyes    He stared at the Pacific--and all his men    Look'd at each other with a wild surmise--    Silent, upon a peak in Darien.      TRANSLATIONS. As INDICATED IN THE TEXT OF THE ESSAY.    The whole of the Homeric tradition is affected by the recent discoveries  made in Crete. The civilisation there unearthed raises questions of  great interest; the problems it suggests are certain to modify current  ideas of Homeric study.    See _Discoveries in Crete_, by R. Burrows (Murray, 1907).    A very good account of the early age of European literature is in _The  Heroic Age_, by Chadwick (Cambridge, 1912).    The best interpretation of Greek poetry is Symonds' _Greek Poets_, 2  vols. (Smith Elder).    Jebb's _Homer_ is the best introduction to the many difficulties  presented by the poems.    Flaxman's engravings for the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ are of the highest  order.          AESCHYLUS      Towards the end of the sixth century before Christ, one of the most  momentous advances in literature was made by the genius of Aeschylus.  European drama was created and a means of utterance was given to the  rapidly growing democratic spirit of Greece. Before Aeschylus wrote,  rude public exhibitions had been given of the life and adventures of  Dionysus, the god of wine. Choruses had sung odes to the deity and  variety was obtained by a series of short dialogues between one of the  Chorus and the remainder. Aeschylus added a second actor to converse  with the first; he thus started a movement which eventually ousted  the Chorus from its place of importance, for the interest now began to  concentrate on the two actors; it was their performance which gave drama  its name. In time more characters were added; the Chorus became less  necessary and in the long run was felt to be a hindrance to the movement  of the story. This process is plainly visible in the extant works of the  Attic tragedians.    Aeschylus was born at Eleusis in 525; before the end of the century he  was writing tragedies. In 490 he fought in the great battle of Marathon  and took part in the victory of Salamis in 480. This experience of the  struggle for freedom against Persian despotism added a vigour and  a self-reliance to his writing which is characteristic of a growing  national spirit. He is said to have visited Sicily in 468 and again in  458, various motives being given for his leaving Athens. His death  at Gela in 456 is said to have been due to an eagle, which dropped a  tortoise upon his head which he mistook for a stone. He has left to  the world seven plays in which the rapid development of drama is  conspicuous.    One of the earliest of his plays is the _Suppliants_, little read  owing to the uncertainty of the text and the meagreness of the dramatic  interest. The plot is simple enough. Danaus, sprung from Io of Argos,  flees from Egypt with his fifty daughters who avoid wedlock with the  fifty sons of Aegyptus. He sails to Argos and lays suppliant boughs on  the altars of the gods, imploring protection. The King of Argos after  consultation with his people decides to admit the fugitives and to  secure them from Aegyptus' violence. A herald from the latter threatens  to take the Danaids back with him, but the King intervenes and saves  them. There is little in this play but long choral odes; yet one or two  Aeschylean features are evident. The King dreads offending the god of  suppliants        \"lest he should make him to haunt his house, a dread visitor who      quits not sinners even in the world to come.\"    The Egyptian"]]]
