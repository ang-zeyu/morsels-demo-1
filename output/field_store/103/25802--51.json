Yes,  I suppose it does. They're running all the time, anyway. Why, you are  not sick, are you, Miss Williams?\"    There was genuine concern in his tone. This girl, with her sweet,  vibrant voice, her clear gray eyes, seemed very charming to him. She  wasn't beautiful, perhaps, but she was the kind of girl he liked. There  was a steady earnestness in the gray eyes that made him think of his  mother.    \"No,\" said Maidie, slowly. \"I'm all right, thank you. But I wish I could  find that man again. I know sometimes they have to make it up if their  accounts are wrong, and I couldn't--we couldn't feel very comfortable--\"    Frank Armstrong interrupted her. \"Maidie,\" he said, with the studied  calmness with which one speaks to an unreasonable child, \"you are  perfectly absurd. Here it is within five minutes of the tune for the  concert to begin. It is impossible to tell when that car is coming back.  You are making us all very uncomfortable. Mrs. Tirrell, won't you please  tell her not to spoil our afternoon?\"    \"I think he's right, Maidie,\" said Mrs. Tirrell. \"It's very nice of you  to feel so sorry for the poor man, but he really was very careless. It  was all his own fault. And just think how far he made us walk! My feet  are quite damp. We ought to go in directly or we shall all take cold,  and I'm sure you wouldn't like that, my dear.\"    She led the way as she spoke, the two girls and young Armstrong  following. Maidie hesitated. It was so easy to go in, to forget  everything in the light and warmth and excitement.    \"No,\" said she, very firmly, and as much to herself as to the young man  who stood waiting for her. \"I must go back and try to make it right. I'm  so sorry, Mr. Harris, but if you will tell them--\"    \"Why, I'm going with you, of course\" said the young fellow, impulsively.  \"If I'd only looked once at the man I'd go alone, but I shouldn't know  him from Adam.\"    Maidie laughed. \"Oh, I don't want to lose the whole concert, Mr. Harris,  and Frank, has all the tickets. You must go after them and try to make  my peace. I'll come just as soon as I can. Don't wait for me, please.  If you'll come and look for me here the first number, and not let them  scold me too much--\" She ended with an imploring little catch in her  breath that was almost a sob.    \"They sha'n't say a word, Miss Williams!\" cried Walter Harris, with  honest admiration in his eyes.    But she was gone already, and conscious that further delay was only  making matters worse, he went on into the hall.    Meanwhile, the car swung heavily along the wet rails on its way to the  turning-point. It was nearly empty now. An old gentleman and his nurse  were the only occupants. Jim Stevens, the conductor, had stepped inside  the car.    \"Too bad I forgot those young people wanted to get off at Music Hall,\"  he was thinking to himself. \"I don't see how I came to do it. That chap  looked as if he wanted to complain of me, and I don't know as I blame  him. I'd have said I was sorry if he hadn't been so sharp with his  tongue. I hope he won't complain just now. 'Twould be a pretty bad time  for me to get into trouble, with Mary and the baby both sick. I'm too  sleepy to be good for much, that's a fact. Sitting up three nights  running takes hold of a fellow somehow when he's at work all day. The  rent's paid, that's one thing, if it hasn't left me but half a dollar to  my name. Hullo!\" He was struck by a sudden distinct recollection of the  coins he had returned. \"Why, I gave him fifty cents too much!\"    He glanced up at the dial which indicated the fares and began to count  the change in his pocket. He knew exactly how much money he had had at  the beginning of the trip. He counted carefully. Then he plunged his  hand into the heavy canvas pocket of his coat. Perhaps he had half a  dollar there. No, it was empty!    He faced the fact reluctantly. Fifty cents short, ten fares! Gone into  the pocket of the young gentleman with the fur collar! The conductor's  hand shook as he put the money back in his pocket. It meant--what did it  mean? He drew a long breath.    Christmas Eve! A dark dreary little room upstairs in a noisy tenement  house. A pale, thin woman on a shabby lounge vainly trying to quiet a  fretful child. The child is thin and pale, too, with a hard, racking  cough. There is a small fire in the stove, a very small fire; coal is so  high. The medicine stands on the shelf. \"Medicine won't do much good,\"  the doctor had said; \"he needs beef and cream.\"    Jim's heart sank at the thought. He could almost hear the baby asking;  \"Isn't papa coming soon? Isn't he, mamma?\"    \"Poor little kid!\" Jim said, softly, under his breath. \"And I shan't  have a thing to take home to him; nor Mary's violets, either. It'll be  the first Christmas that ever happened. I suppose that chap would think  it was ridiculous for me to be buying violets. He wouldn't understand  what the flowers mean to Mary. Perhaps he didn't notice I gave him too  much. That kind don't know how much they have. They just pull it out as  if it was newspaper.\"    The conductor went out into the snow to help the nurse, who was  assisting the old gentleman to the ground. Then the car swung on again.  Jim turned up the collar of his coat about his ears and stamped his  feet. There was the florist's shop where he had meant to buy the  violets, and the toy-shop was just around the corner.    A thought flashed across his tired brain. \"Plenty of men would do it;  they do it every day. Nobody ever would be the poorer for it. This car  will be crowded going home. I needn't ring in every fare; nobody could  tell. But Mary! She wouldn't touch those violets if she knew. And she'd  know. I'd have to tell her. I couldn't keep it from her, she's that  quick.\"    He jumped off to adjust the trolley with a curious sense of unreality.  It couldn't be that he was really going home this Christmas Eve with  empty hands. Well, they must all suffer together for his carelessness.  It was his own fault, but it was hard. And he was so tired!    To his amazement he found his eyes were blurred as he watched the people  crowding into the car. What? Was he going to cry like a baby--he, a  great burly man of thirty years?    \"It's no use,\" he thought. \"I couldn't do it. The first time I gave Mary  violets was the night she said she'd marry me. I told her then I'd do  my best to make her proud of me. I guess she wouldn't be very proud of a  man who could cheat. She'd rather starve than have a ribbon she couldn't  pay for.\"    He rang up a dozen fares with a steady hand. The temptation was over.  Six more strokes--then nine without a falter. He even imagined the bell  rang more distinctly than usual, even encouragingly. The car stopped.  Jim flung the door open with a triumphant sweep of his arm. He felt  ready to face the world. But the baby--his arm dropped. It was hard.    He turned to help the young girl who was waiting at the step. Through  the whirling snow he saw her eager face, with a quick recognition  lighting the steady eyes, and wondered dimly, as he stood with his hand  on the signal-strap, where he could have seen her before.    He knew immediately.    \"There was a mistake,\" she said, with a shy tremor in her voice. \"You  gave us too much change and here it is.\" She held out to Jim the piece  of silver which had given him such an unhappy quarter of an hour.    He took it like one dazed. Would the young lady think he was crazy to  care so much about so small a coin? He must say something. \"Thank you,  miss,\" he stammered as well as he could. \"You see, I thought it was  gone--and there's the baby--and it's Christmas Eve--and my wife's  sick--and you can't understand--\"    It certainly was not remarkable that she couldn't.    \"But I do,\" she said, simply. \"I was afraid of that. And I thought  perhaps there was a baby, so I brought my Christmas present for her,\"  and something else dropped into Jim's cold hand.    \"What you waiting for?\" shouted the motorman from the front platform.  The girl had disappeared in the snow.    Jim rang the bell to go ahead, and gazed again at the two shining half  dollars in his hand.    \"I didn't have a chance to tell her,\" he explained to his wife late in  the evening, as he sat in a tiny rocking-chair several sizes too small  for him, \"that the baby wasn't a her at all, though if I thought he'd  grow up into such a lovely one as she is, I don't know but I almost wish  he was.\"    \"Poor Jim!\" said Mary, with a little laugh as she put up her hand to  stroke his rough cheek. \"I guess you're tired.\"    \"And I should say,\" he added, stretching out his long legs toward the  few red sparks in the bottom of the grate, \"I should say she had tears  in her eyes, too, but I was that near crying myself I couldn't be sure.\"    The little room was sweet with the odour of English violets. Asleep in  the bed lay the boy, a toy horse clasped close to his breast.    \"Bless her heart!\" said Mary, softly.    \"Well, Miss Williams,\" said Walter Harris, as he sprang to meet a  snow-covered figure coming swiftly along the sidewalk. \"I can see  that you found him. You've lost the first number, but they won't scold  you--not this time.\"    The girl turned a radiant face upon him. \"Thank you,\" she said, shaking  the snowy crystals from her skirt. \"I don't care now if they do. I  should have lost more than that if I had stayed.\"          VIII. TOINETTE AND THE ELVES*    * Published by arrangement with Little, Brown & Co.

However, that's the blasted sticker about this thing. It's no  more and no less than a blind stab in the dark. It may gain us nothing,  and then again, it may gain us a lot. And ... it may get you both a  knife in your back before you've been in the place five minutes. I  pray to God not, but that's the chance you'll be taking. To sum it up  bluntly, you'll simply be grabbing at possible straws, and....\"    \"And there may not be any to grab,\" Dave grunted as the other hesitated.    \"Precisely!\" the senior officer said and made a wry face. \"You'll be  taking a wild, blind shot in the dark to connect with something that  will lead you to the top rankers in the Axis espionage system working  in Singapore.\"    \"It would certainly be a break if the spy you're gunning for at  Singapore R.A.F. Base uses Serrangi's as a contact place,\" Dave said.  \"I think I could spot an R.A.F. lad with my eyes shut.\"    \"Not this one, I fancy,\" the Air Vice Marshal said. \"He may be R.A.F.  on the surface when he's on duty, but the blighter is Nazi at heart.  He'll be clever, and twice as cruel, too. But, if you should be lucky  enough to contact him ... rather, spot him ... a lot of my worries  would be over. Once I find out that beggar's identity I've got a very  neat little plan already to be put into operation. That, however, would  be like asking for a miracle on a silver platter.\"    \"But, supposing we do tag him,\" Dave persisted. \"How do you plan for us  to get word to you, sir?\"    \"I've arranged for that,\" the senior officer said. \"In front of the  Raffles Hotel, which is perhaps the easiest thing to find in all  Singapore, there's always a gathering of peddlers and hawkers who will  sell anything to soldiers and civilians alike. In peace times they made  quite a good thing out of it from the tourist trade, but they are not  doing so well now that half the world is at war. However they still  cluster about in front of the Raffles hoping to make a few pennies.  Anyway, one of them is a horrible looking creature. He is not more than  five feet tall, and bent over at that. He wears a dirty white patch  over his right eye, and the thumb on the left hand is missing. He is  always there, and you couldn't possibly miss him. Put any message you  have for me in Air Intelligence Code Six-X-Seven, walk past the man  with the patch over his right eye, and toss the wadded message into  the gutter, as though it were a bit of paper you were throwing away.  And.... By the by, you know the Air Intelligence Code Six-X-Seven, of  course?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" Freddy spoke for both of them. \"By heart, sir.\"    \"Good,\" Air Vice Marshal Bostworth said and gave them a pleased nod.  \"Well, do as I say, if you have any message you want transmitted to me.  However, be sure and just walk by the beggar, and toss the bit of paper  into the gutter. Do not turn to him or look at him. And for heaven's  sake don't speak to him. You'll probably lose the man his life if you  speak to him. And I hasten to tell you that he is one of the best  British counter espionage agents in Singapore. Well, so much for that.  Now, any other questions?\"    Dave looked at Freddy Farmer and nodded.    \"Go ahead with that question you asked awhile back,\" he said. \"I guess  that's the important one, now.\"    The English youth looked blank for a moment, then his face brightened  as he realized what Dave was talking about.    \"Oh, yes, quite,\" he said and turned to Air Vice Marshal Bostworth.  \"It's that question I asked about getting ashore from this Catalina,  and clothes, sir.\"    \"Simple, quite simple,\" the senior officer replied with a faint wave  of his hand. \"I only hope the rest of this blasted business will be  equally as simple. Well....\"    The man paused, looked at his watch, and then glanced out the porthole  at the blood red sun that was balancing like a ball on the western  horizon line. Its flaming red rays fanned out across the sky to bathe  everything in a pinkish glow. Even the wings of the Catalina were  touched by the glow that bounced off their glossy surfaces and seeped  in through the ports to the interior of the compartment. The dying sun  was a beautiful, breath catching sight ... but not right at the moment  for Dave Dawson and Freddy Farmer. Their thoughts were not on beautiful  things, now, but on many other things, not the least of which was  possible death by tomorrow's setting sun.    \"Well, in an hour it will be darkish, sort of,\" the Air Vice Marshal  continued speaking. \"When it is we're going to head back toward  Singapore. I will have the radio operator send word that our search  failed, and that I'm having this flyingboat land in Keppel Harbor as  I wish to go direct to the Government buildings in the city. We will  land in the harbor and the crew will break out two of the collapsible  boats we carry aboard. I will go ashore in one. You two will use the  other. Under cover of darkness you can easily reach some section of  Singapore's waterfront undetected. Simply go ashore and release the  air valve in your boat. It will fill up and sink at once. As for  clothes....\"    The senior officer paused and smiled faintly.    \"This is not the first time I have used this Catalina for Intelligence  work,\" he said. \"In fact, it is used almost exclusively for such jobs.  You'd be surprised the stuff we have aboard this craft. We carry all  kinds of clothes, from a German soldier's uniform on up to almost  anything you could mention. Don't worry, before you leave this Catalina  you'll look so much like a couple of rescued sailors from a China to  Australia boat your own families wouldn't recognize you. Later I'll  give you facts of an actual sinking to make your story ring true. Now,  what else, eh?\"    Dave started to speak, but thought better of it after an instant's  hesitation, and closed his mouth. Air Vice Marshal Bostworth gave him a  sharp quizzical glance.    \"Yes, Dawson?\" he encouraged. \"What is it? Ask anything you like.  After all, this is not going to be any tea party that you two are  setting out on. If you've got something to ask me, go right ahead.  Later on, you might regret not having asked it.\"    Dave hesitated a couple of more seconds, then shrugged.    \"Well, maybe it's a crazy question, sir,\" he said slowly, \"but somehow  I always like to be on the safe side. I mean, I like to be sure about a  couple of things in advance, when I stick my neck out, if you get what  I mean?\"    \"I think I understand, a little,\" the other said. \"But perhaps you'd  better make yourself a bit clearer, eh?\"    The American born R.A.F. ace took a deep breath as though he were about  to dive off into icy waters. Then he blurted it out.    \"The crew of this Catalina, sir,\" he said. \"You admit that there is  some Nazi agent at the Singapore R.A.F. Base. A lad you haven't been  able to lay by the heels yet. Well, what I mean is this. Those aboard  this flyingboat know who we are. The sergeant gunner asked us if we  were Dawson and Farmer when we came aboard. Well.... That is to say....  I mean....\"    Dave stumbled to a halt and flushed a deep red.    \"You mean, how about the loyalty of the crew of this Catalina?\" the Air  Vice Marshal helped him out.    \"Yes, sir,\" Dave said with a nod.    \"A perfectly fair question,\" the other replied. \"I'll describe their  loyalty in this way, then. _I_ would reveal your true identity to the  Nazi agents in Singapore before any one of them would.\"    \"That's all I want to know,\" Dave said. \"Fair enough. Any better  wouldn't do. How about you, Freddy?\"    \"Quite,\" the English youth said. \"Oh, very definitely and absolutely!\"    \"Then what are we waiting for?\" Dave said, turning back to Air Vice  Marshal Bostworth with a grin. \"Let's get going and not keep old  Serrangi waiting any longer than we have to!\"          CHAPTER SEVEN    _The Jaws Of Death_      Night had come again to Singapore. From one end of the Island to the  other all was cloaked in velvety darkness save where light made by  man thrust aside the shadows. At Raffles Hotel they still danced, and  at the famous city cafes they still drank and watched worn out floor  shows, even though the nearness of war in the Far East seemed to hang  in the very air like a shroud. Even in the poorer sections, and in the  slums, there were sounds of merry-making. It was almost as though rich  man and beggar alike were enjoying themselves as much as they could  before the sword of Mars came slashing down on that section of the  earth.    In the unspeakably smelly alley that is known as Bukum Street two  figures slouched along as though they didn't have an idea in the world  where they were going, and cared even less when they got there. At  every little opened front shop they paused and gaped vacant eyed at the  collection of wares on display. Sometimes they muttered things to each  other in low tones. Sometimes they said nothing, and just stared. And  more times than not the storekeepers instantly sized them up as very  poor prospects for a sale and waved them on their way.    Presently they both halted in their tracks as though by unspoken signal  and stared half a block ahead at a two story wooden building on the  other side of the street. It was much the same as all the others save  there was no shop on the lower floor of this building, and therefore it  had no open front. On the contrary, it had a front door and windows,  and hanging from a bracket that protruded from the door was a sign with  somebody's idea of His Satanic Majesty painted on it in red.    \"That's us, Freddy!\" muttered the taller of the pair. \"A crummy looking  joint, isn't it?\"    \"Much worse!\" came the half muffled reply. \"And good Lord, this awful  smell does come from there! So blasted thick and heavy, I can almost  see it coming out the front door.\"    \"Yeah,\" Dave Dawson murmured. \"And if it's from the brand of coffee  "]]]
