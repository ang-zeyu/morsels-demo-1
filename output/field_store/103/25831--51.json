Because so often you have hearkened to    My selfish prayers, I ask but one thing now,  That these harsh hands of mine add not unto    The crown of thorns upon your bleeding brow.        WAVE-WON      To-night I hunger so,  Beloved one, to know  If you recall and crave again the dream  That haunted our canoe,  And wove its witchcraft through  Our hearts as 'neath the northern night we sailed the northern stream.    Ah! dear, if only we  As yesternight could be  Afloat within that light and lonely shell,  To drift in silence till  Heart-hushed, and lulled and still  The moonlight through the melting air flung forth its fatal spell.    The dusky summer night,  The path of gold and white  The moon had cast across the river's breast,  The shores in shadows clad,  The far-away, half-sad  Sweet singing of the whip-poor-will, all soothed our souls to rest.    You trusted I could feel  My arm as strong as steel,  So still your upturned face, so calm your breath,  While circling eddies curled,  While laughing rapids whirled  From boulder unto boulder, till they dashed themselves to death.    Your splendid eyes aflame  Put heaven's stars to shame,  Your god-like head so near my lap was laid--  My hand is burning where  It touched your wind-blown hair,  As sweeping to the rapids verge, I changed my paddle blade.    The boat obeyed my hand,  Till wearied with its grand  Wild anger, all the river lay aswoon,  And as my paddle dipped,  Thro' pools of pearl it slipped  And swept beneath a shore of shade, beneath a velvet moon.    To-night, again dream you  Our spirit-winged canoe  Is listening to the rapids purling past?  Where, in delirium reeled  Our maddened hearts that kneeled  To idolize the perfect world, to taste of love at last.        THE HAPPY HUNTING GROUNDS      Into the rose gold westland, its yellow prairies roll,  World of the bison's freedom, home of the Indian's soul.  Roll out, O seas! in sunlight bathed,  Your plains wind-tossed, and grass enswathed.    Farther than vision ranges, farther than eagles fly,  Stretches the land of beauty, arches the perfect sky,  Hemm'd through the purple mists afar  By peaks that gleam like star on star.    Fringing the prairie billows, fretting horizon's line,  Darkly green are slumb'ring wildernesses of pine,  Sleeping until the zephyrs throng  To kiss their silence into song.    Whispers freighted with odour swinging into the air,  Russet needles as censers swing to an altar, where  The angels' songs are less divine  Than duo sung twixt breeze and pine.    Laughing into the forest, dimples a mountain stream,  Pure as the airs above it, soft as a summer dream,  O! Lethean spring thou'rt only found  Within this ideal hunting ground.    Surely the great Hereafter cannot be more than this,  Surely we'll see that country after Time's farewell kiss.  Who would his lovely faith condole?  Who envies not the Red-skin's soul,    Sailing into the cloud land, sailing into the sun,  Into the crimson portals ajar when life is done?  O! dear dead race, my spirit too  Would fain sail westward unto you.        IN THE SHADOWS      I am sailing to the leeward,  Where the current runs to seaward      Soft and slow,  Where the sleeping river grasses  Brush my paddle as it passes      To and fro.    On the shore the heat is shaking  All the golden sands awaking      In the cove;  And the quaint sand-piper, winging  O'er the shallows, ceases singing      When I move.    On the water's idle pillow  Sleeps the overhanging willow,      Green and cool;  Where the rushes lift their burnished  Oval heads from out the tarnished      Emerald pool.    Where the very silence slumbers,  Water lilies grow in numbers,      Pure and pale;  All the morning they have rested,  Amber crowned, and pearly crested,      Fair and frail.    Here, impossible romances,  Indefinable sweet fancies,      Cluster round;  But they do not mar the sweetness  Of this still September fleetness      With a sound.    I can scarce discern the meeting  Of the shore and stream retreating,      So remote;  For the laggard river, dozing,  Only wakes from its reposing      Where I float.    Where the river mists are rising,  All the foliage baptizing      With their spray;  There the sun gleams far and faintly,  With a shadow soft and saintly,      In its ray.    And the perfume of some burning  Far-off brushwood, ever turning      To exhale  All its smoky fragrance dying,  In the arms of evening lying,      Where I sail.    My canoe is growing lazy,  In the atmosphere so hazy,      While I dream;  Half in slumber I am guiding,  Eastward indistinctly gliding      Down the stream.        NOCTURNE      Night of Mid-June, in heavy vapours dying,  Like priestly hands thy holy touch is lying  Upon the world's wide brow;  God-like and grand all nature is commanding  The \"peace that passes human understanding\";  I, also, feel it now.    What matters it to-night, if one life treasure  I covet, is not mine! Am I to measure  The gifts of Heaven's decree  By my desires? O! life for ever longing  For some far gift, where many gifts are thronging,  God wills, it may not be.    Am I to learn that longing, lifted higher,  Perhaps will catch the gleam of sacred fire  That shows my cross is gold?  That underneath this cross--however lowly,  A jewel rests, white, beautiful and holy,  Whose worth can not be told.    Like to a scene I watched one day in wonder:--  A city, great and powerful, lay under  A sky of grey and gold;  The sun outbreaking in his farewell hour,  Was scattering afar a yellow shower  Of light, that aureoled    With brief hot touch, so marvellous and shining,  A hundred steeples on the sky out-lining,  Like network threads of fire;  Above them all, with halo far outspreading,  I saw a golden cross in glory heading  A consecrated spire:    I only saw its gleaming form uplifting,  Against the clouds of grey to seaward drifting,  And yet I surely know  Beneath the seen, a great unseen is resting,  For while the cross that pinnacle is cresting,  An Altar lies below.           .        .        .        .        .    Night of Mid-June, so slumberous and tender,  Night of Mid-June, transcendent in thy splendour  Thy silent wings enfold  And hush my longing, as at thy desire  All colour fades from round that far-off spire,  Except its cross of gold.        MY ENGLISH LETTER      When each white moon, her lantern idly swinging,    Comes out to join the star night-watching band,  Across the grey-green sea, a ship is bringing    For me a letter, from the Motherland.    Naught would I care to live in quaint old Britain,    These wilder shores are dearer far to me,  Yet when I read the words that hand has written,    The parent sod more precious seems to be.    Within that folded note I catch the savour    Of climes that make the Motherland so fair,  Although I never knew the blessed favour    That surely lies in breathing English air.    Imagination's brush before me fleeing,    Paints English pictures, though my longing eyes  Have never known the blessedness of seeing    The blue that lines the arch of English skies.    And yet my letter brings the scenes I covet,    Framed in the salt sea winds, aye more in dreams  I almost see the face that bent above it,    I almost touch that hand, so near it seems.    Near, for the very grey-green sea that dashes    'Round these Canadian coasts, rolls out once more  To Eastward, and the same Atlantic splashes    Her wild white spray on England's distant shore.    Near, for the same young moon so idly swinging    Her threadlike crescent bends the selfsame smile  On that old land from whence a ship is bringing    My message from the transatlantic Isle.    Thus loves my heart that far old country better,    Because of those dear words that always come,  With love enfolded in each English letter    That drifts into my sun-kissed Western home.          CANADIAN BORN    (The following poems are from the author's second book, \"Canadian  Born,\" first published in 1903.)        CANADIAN BORN      We first saw light in Canada, the land beloved of God;  We are the pulse of Canada, its marrow and its blood:  And we, the men of Canada, can face the world and brag  That we were born in Canada beneath the British flag.    Few of us have the blood of kings, few are of courtly birth,  But few are vagabonds or rogues of doubtful name and worth;  And all have one credential that entitles us to brag--  That we were born in Canada beneath the British flag.    We've yet to make our money, we've yet to make our fame,  But we have gold and glory in our clean colonial name;  And every man's a millionaire if only he can brag  That he was born in Canada beneath the British flag.    No title and no coronet is half so proudly worn  As that which we inherited as men Canadian born.  We count no man so noble as the one who makes the brag  That he was born in Canada beneath the British flag.    The Dutch may have their Holland, the Spaniard have his Spain,  The Yankee to the south of us must south of us remain;  For not a man dare lift a hand against the men who brag  That they were born in Canada beneath the British flag.        WHERE LEAPS THE STE. MARIE      I    What dream you in the night-time    When you whisper to the moon?  What say you in the morning?    What do you sing at noon?  When I hear your voice uplifting,  Like a breeze through branches sifting,  And your ripples softly drifting    To the August airs a-tune.    II    Lend me your happy laughter,    Ste. Marie, as you leap;  Your peace that follows after    Where through the isles you creep.  Give to me your splendid dashing,  Give your sparkles and your splashing,  Your uphurling waves down crashing,    Then, your aftermath of sleep.        HARVEST TIME      Pillowed and hushed on the silent plain,  Wrapped in her mantle of golden grain,    Wearied of pleasuring weeks away,  Summer is lying asleep "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5630"],[0,"The Story of \"Mormonism\" and The Philosophy of \"Mormonism\" (#9)"],[1,"immediately hastened westward.    On the 24th of July, 1857, the people had assembled in  celebration of Pioneer Day.  Silver Lake, a mountain gem set  amidst the snows and forests and towering peaks of the  Cottonwoods, had been selected as a fitting site for the  festivities.  The Stars and Stripes streamed above the camp;  bands played; choirs sang; there were speeches, and picnics, and  prayers.  Experiences were compared as to the journeyings on the  plains; stories were told of the shifts to which the people had  been put by the vicissitudes of famine; but these dread  experiences seemed to them now like a dream of the night; on this  day all were happy.  Were they not safe from savage foes both red  and white?  There had been peace for a season; and their desert  homes were already smiling in wealth of flower and tree; the  wilderness was blossoming under their feet; their consciences  were void of offense toward their fellows.  Yet at that very  hour, all unbeknown to themselves, and without the opportunity of  speaking a word in defense, these people had been convicted of  insurrection and treason.    It was midday and the festivities were at their height, when a  party of men rode into camp and sought an interview with Governor  Young.  Three of them had plainly ridden hard and far; they gave  their report;--an armed force of thousands was at that hour  approaching the territory; the boasts of officers and men as to  what they would do when they found themselves in \"Mormon\" towns  were reported; and these stories called up, in the minds of those  who heard, the dread scenes of Far West and Nauvoo.  Had these  colonists of the wilderness not gone far enough to satisfy the  hatred of their fellow-citizens in this republic of liberty?  They had halted between the civilization of the east and that of  the west, they had fled from the country that refused them a  home, and now the nation would eject them from their desert  lodgings.    A council was called and the situation was freely discussed.  Had  they not seen, lo, these many times, organized battalions and  companies surpassing fiendish mobs in villainy?  The evidence  warranted their conclusion that invasion meant massacre.  With  tense calmness the plan of action was decided upon.  It was the  general conviction that war was inevitable, and it was decided to  resist to the last.  Then, if the army forced its way into the  valleys of Utah on hostile purpose bent, it should find the land  as truly a desert as it was when the pioneers first took  possession.  To this effect was the decision:--We have built  cities in the east for our foes to occupy; our very temples have  been desecrated and destroyed by them; but, with the help of  Israel's God, we will prevent them enriching themselves with the  spoils of our labors in these mountain retreats.    There seemed to be no room for doubt that war was about to break  upon them; and with such a prospect, men may be expected to take  every advantage of their situation.  Brigham Young was still  governor of Utah, and the militia was subject to his order.  Promptly he proclaimed the territory under martial law, and  forbade any armed body to cross its boundaries.  Echo Canyon, the  one promising route of ingress, was fortified.  In those defiles  an army might easily be stopped by a few; ammunition stations  were established; provisions were cached; boulders were collected  upon the cliffs beneath which the invaders must pass if they held  to their purpose of forcing an entrance.  The people had been  roused to desperation, and force was to be met with force.  In  the settlements, combustibles were placed in readiness, and if  the worst came, every \"Mormon\" house would be reduced to ashes,  every tree would be hewn down.    With an experience of suffering that would have well served a  better cause, this picked detachment of the United States army  made its way to the Green River country; and there, counting well  the cost of proceeding farther, went into camp at Fort Bridger.  Many of the troops had almost perished in the storms, for it was  late in November, and the winter had closed in early.  Colonel  Cooke reported to the commandant that half his horses had  perished through cold and lack of food; hundreds of beef cattle  had died; yet the region was so wild and forbidding that scarcely  a wolf ventured there to glut itself upon the carcasses.  In  Cooke's own words we read that for thirty miles the road was  blocked with carcasses--and \"with abandoned and shattered  property, they mark, perhaps beyond example in history, the steps  of an advancing army with the horrors of a disastrous retreat.\"    With the army traveled the new federal appointees to offices in  the territory.  Cumming, the governor-to-be, issued a  proclamation from his dug-out lodgings, and sent it to Salt Lake  City by courier; he signed it as \"Governor of Utah Territory.\"  This but belittled him, for by the very terms of the Organic Act,  to uphold which was the professed purpose of his coming, he was  not governor until the oath of office had been duly administered  and subscribed.  A few days later he went before his  fellow-sufferer Eckles, the appointee for chief justice of Utah,  and took an oath; but why did he swear so recklessly when the one  before whom he swore was no more an official than himself?    The army wintered at a satisfactory distance from Salt Lake City,  and such a winter, according to official reports, the soldiers of  our nation have rarely had to brave.  It was soon apparent that  they need fear no \"Mormon\" attack; orders had been issued to the  territorial militia to take no life except in cases of absolute  necessity; but General Johnston and his staff had more than their  match in battling with the elements.  Communications between  Governor Young and the commandant were frequent; safe conduct was  assured any and all officers who chose to enter the city; and if  necessary hostages were to be given; but the governor was  inexorable in his ultimatum that, as an organized body with  hostile purpose, the soldiers should not pass the mountain  gateway.  In the meantime, a full account of the situation was  reported by Governor Young to the President of the United States,  and the truth slowly made its way into the eastern press.  President Buchanan tacitly admitted his mistake; but to recall  the troops at that juncture would be to confess humiliating  failure.    A peace commissioner, in the person of Colonel Kane, was  dispatched to Salt Lake City; his coming being made known to  Governor Young, an escort was sent to meet him and conduct him  through the \"Mormon\" lines.  The result of the conference was  that the \"Mormon\" leaders but reiterated their statement that the  President's appointees would be given safe entry to the city, and  be duly installed in their offices, provided they would enter  without the army.  This ultimatum was carried to the federal  camp; and to the open chagrin of the commandant, Governor Cumming  and his fellow appointees moved to Salt Lake City under \"Mormon\"  escort, after a five months' halt in the wilderness.    I believe that strategy is usually allowed in war, and I am free  to say the \"Mormons\" availed themselves of this license.  At  short intervals in the course of the night-passage through the  canyon, the party was challenged, and the password demanded;  bon-fires were blazing down in the gorges, and the impression was  made that the mountains were full of armed men; whereas the  sentries were members of the escort, who, preceding by short cuts  the main party, continued to challenge and to pass.  On their  arrival, the gentlemen were met by the retiring officials, and  were peaceably installed.  The new governor called upon the clerk  of the court, and ascertained the truth of the statement that the  records were entirely safe.  He promptly reported his conclusions  to General Johnston that there was no further need for the army.  It was decided, however, that the soldiers should be permitted to  march through the city, and straightway the \"Mormons\" began their  exodus to the south.    Governor Cumming tried in vain to induce the people to remain,  assuring them that the troops would commit no depredations.  \"Not  so,\" said Brigham Young, \"we have had experience with troops in  the past, Governor Cumming; we have seen our leaders shot down by  the demoralized soldiery; we have seen mothers with babes at  their breasts sent to their last home by the same bullet; we have  witnessed outrages beyond description.  You are now Governor of  Utah; we can no longer command the militia for our own defense.  We do not wish to fight, therefore we depart.\"  Leaving a few men  to apply the brand to the combustibles stored in every house, at  the first sign of plunder by the soldiers, the people again  deserted their homes and moved into the desert anew.    But the officers of the army kept their word; the troops were put  into camp forty miles from the settlements, and the settlers  returned.  The President's commissioners brought the official  pardon, unsolicited, for all acts committed by the \"Mormons\" in  opposing the entrance of the army.  The people asked what they  had done that needed pardon; they had not robbed, they had not  killed.  But a critical analysis of these troublous events  revealed at least one overt act--some \"Mormon\" scouts had  challenged a supply train; and, being opposed, they had destroyed  some of the wagons and provisions; and for this they accepted the  President's most gracious pardon.        CHAPTER V    After all, the \"Mormon\" people regard the advent of the Buchanan  army as one of the greatest material blessings ever brought to  them.    The troops, once in Utah, had to be provisioned; and everything  the settlers could spare was eagerly bought at an unusual price.  The gold changed hands.  Then, in their hasty departure, the  soldiers"]]]
