Women and children sit at their doors  drinking mate and watching the slowly drawn bullock-carts go up and  down the uneven, unmade roads, bordered, not by the familiar maple, but  with huge dust-covered cactus plants, The bullocks all draw with their  horns, and the indolent driver sits on the yoke, urging forward his  sleepy animals with a poke of his cane, on the end of which he has  fastened a sharp nail. The _buey_ is very thick-skinned and would not  heed a whip. The wheels of the cart are often cut from a solid piece of  wood, and are fastened on with great hardwood pins in a most primitive  style. Soon after sunset all retire to their trestle beds.    In early morning the women hurry to mass. The Criollo does not break  his fast until nearly mid-day, so they have no early meal to prepare.  Even before it is quite light it is difficult to pass along the streets  owing to the custom they have of carrying their praying-chairs with  them to mass. The rich lady will be followed by her dark-skinned maid  bearing a sumptuously upholstered chair on her head. The middle classes  carry their own, and the very poor take with them a palm-leaf mat of  their own manufacture. When mass is over religion is over for the day.  After service they make their way down to the river or pond, carrying  on their heads the soiled linen. Standing waist-high in the water, they  wash out the stains with black soap of their own manufacture, beating  each article with hardwood boards made somewhat like a cricketer's bat.  The cloths are then laid on the sand or stones of the shore. The women  gossip and smoke until these are dry and ready to carry home again ere  the heat becomes too intense.    In a description of Argentine village life, I could not possibly omit  the priest, the \"all in all\" to the native, the temporal and spiritual  king, who bears in his hands the destinies of the living and the dead.  These men are the potentates of the people, who refer everything to  them, from the most trivial matter to the weightier one of the saving  of their souls after death. Bigotry and superstition are extreme.    Renous, the naturalist, tells us that he visited one of these towns and  left some caterpillars with a girl. These she was to feed until his  return, that they might change to butterflies. When this was rumored  through the village, priest and governor consulted together and agreed  that it must be black heresy. When poor Renous returned some time  afterwards he was arrested.    The Argentine village priest is a dangerous enemy to the Protestant.  Many is the time he has insulted me to my face, or, more cowardly,  charged the school-boys to pelt and annoy me. In the larger towns the  priest has defamed me through the press, and when I have answered him  also by that means, he has heaped insult upon injury, excluded me from  society, and made me a pariah and a byword to the superstitious people.  I have been stoned and spat upon, hurled to the ground, had half-wild  dogs set on me, and my horse frightened that he might throw me. I have  been refused police help, or been called to the office to give an  account of myself, all because I was a Protestant, or infidel, as they  prefer to term it. At those times great patience was needed, for at the  least sign of resistance on my part I should have been attacked by the  whole village in one mass. The policeman on the street has looked  expectantly on, eager to see me do this, and on one occasion he  escorted me to the station for snatching a bottle from the hand of a  boy who was in the act of throwing it at my head. Arriving there I was  most severely reprimanded, although, fortunately, not imprisoned.    Women have crossed themselves and run from me in terror to seek the  holy water bottle blessed by the father. Doors have been shut in my  face, and angry voices bade me begone, at the instigation of this  black-robed believer in the Virgin. Congregations of worshippers in the  dark-aisled church have listened to a fabulous description of my  mission and character, until the barber would not cut my hair or the  butcher sell me his meat! Many a mother has hurriedly called her  children in and precipitately shut the door, that my shadow in passing  might not enter and pollute her home. Perhaps a senorita, more  venturesome, with her black hair hanging in two long plaits behind each  shoulder, has run to her iron-barred window to smile at me, and then  penitently fallen before her patron saint imploring forgiveness, or  hurried to confess her sin to the wily _padre_. If the confession was  accompanied by a gift, she has been absolved by him; if she were poor,  her tear-stained face, perhaps resembling that of the suffering Madonna  over the confessional, has moved his heart to tenderness, for well he  knows that         \"Maidens, like moths, are ever caught by glare,       And Mammon wins his way where seraphs might despair.\"    The punishment imposed has only been that she repeat fifty or a hundred  _Ave Marias_ or _Paternosters_. Poor deluded creature! Her sin only  consisted in permitting her black eyes to gaze on me as I passed down  the street.    \"These poor creatures often go to confession, not to be forgiven the  wretched past, but to get a new license to commit sin. One woman, to  whom we offered a tract, refused it, and, showing us an indulgence of  three hundred days, said: 'These are the papers I like.'\"    A young university man in the capital confessed that he had never read  the New Testament and never would read it, because he knew it was  against the Church of Rome. The mass of the people have not the  slightest notion of goodness, as we count piety, and lying is not  considered wrong. A native will often entreat the help of his favorite  saint to commit a theft.    \"To the Protestant the idea of religion without morals is  inconceivable; but in South America Romanism divorces morals and  religion. It is quite possible to break every command of the Decalogue  and yet be a devoted, faithful Romanist.\" [Footnote: Rev. J. H. La  Fetra, in \"Protestant Missions in South America\"]    I can only describe Roman Catholicism on the South American continent  as a species of heathenism. The Church, to gain proselytes, accepted  the old gods of the Indians as saints, and we find idolatrous  superstition and Catholic display blended together. The most ignorant  are invariably the most pious. The more civilized the Criollo becomes,  the less he believes in the Church, and the priest in return condemns  him to eternal perdition.    \"It is not necessary to detail the multitude of pagan superstitions  with which the religion of South America is encumbered. It is enough to  point out that it does not preach Christ crucified and risen again. It  preaches Mary, whom it proclaims from the lips of thousands of  lecherous priests to be of perpetual virginity. And it is by its  deliberate falsehood and deceit, as well as by its misrepresentation,  that the Roman Catholic Church in South America has not only not taught  Christianity, but has directly fostered deception and untruth of  character.\" [Footnote: Missions in South America. Robert E. Speer.]    When I desired respectfully to enter a church with bared head and  deferential mien, they have followed me to see that I did not steal the  trinkets from the saints or desecrate the altar. If I have touched the  font of holy water, instead of it purifying me, I have defiled it for  their use; and when I have looked at the images of the saints the  people have seen them frown at me. After my exit the priest would  sprinkle holy water on the spots where I had stood, to drive away \"the  evil influence.\"    In those churches one may see an image, with inscription beneath,  stating that those who kiss it receive an indulgence for sin and a  promise of heaven. When preaching in Parana I inadvertently dropped a  word in disparagement of the worship of the Virgin, when, quick as  thought, a man dashed towards me with gleaming steel. The Criollo's  knife never errs, and one sharp lunge too well completes his task; but  an old Paraguayan friend then with me sprang upon him and dashed the  knife to the ground, thus leaving my heart's blood warm within me, and  not on the pavement. I admired my antagonist for the strength of his  convictions--true loyalty he displayed for his goddess, who, however,  does not, I am sure, teach her devotees to assassinate those who prefer  to put their faith rather in her Divine Son. Had I been killed the  priest would on no account have buried me, and would most willingly  have absolved the assassin and kept him from the \"arm of justice.\" That  arm in those places is very short indeed, for I have myself met dozens  of murderers rejoicing in their freedom. Hell is only for Protestants.    On the door of my lodging I found one morning a written paper, well  pasted on, which read:    MUERA! VIVA LA VIRGEN CON TODOS LOS SANTOS!    \"_Die! Live the Virgin and all the Saints!_\" That paper I took from the  door and keep as a souvenir of fanaticism.    The Bible is an utterly unknown book, except to the priests, who forbid  its entrance to the houses. It, however, could do little good or harm,  for the masses of the people are utterly unlettered. All Protestant  literature stolen into the town is invariably gathered and burned by  the priest, who would not hesitate also to burn the bringer if he could  without fear of some after-enquiry into the matter.      [Illustration: THE WORLD'S LARGFST ROCKING STONE, TANDIL, ARGENTINA.  This immense stone is so evenly poised that the wind or the slightest  touch of the hand sets it in motion but the storms of the centuries  have failed to dislodge it.]      Rome is to-day just what she always was. Her own claim and motto is:  _Semper idem_ (Always the same). But for this age of enlightenment her  inquisitorial fires would still burn. \"Rome's contention is, not "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7506"],[0,"The Huge Hunter; Or, The Steam Man of the Prairies (#9)"],[1,"airings over the  prairies. To the east and south the plains stretched away till the  horizon shut down upon them, as the sky does on the sea. To the west,  some twenty odd miles distant, a range of mountains was visible, the  peaks being tinged with a faint blue in the distance, while some of  the more elevated looked like white conical clouds resting against the  clear sky beyond.    From the first, young Brainerd expressed a desire to visit these  mountains. There was something in their rugged grandeur which invited  a close inspection, and he proposed to the trapper that they should  make a hunting excursion in that direction.    'No need of goin' so fur for game,' he replied, 'takes too much time,  and thar's sure to be red-skins.'    'But if we go with the steam man we shall frighten them all away,' was  the reply.    'Yas,' laughed Baldy, 'and we'll skear the game away too.'    'But we can overtake that as we did the poor Indian the other day.'    'Not if he takes to the mountains. Leastways yer isn't him that would  like to undertake to ride up the mountain behind that old gintle-man.'    'Nor I either, but we can leave the wagon when we get to the base of  the mountain.'    'And give the reds time to come down and run off with yer whole team.'    'Do you think there is danger of that?'    'Dunno as thar be, but ef they catched sight of yourself, they'd raise  yer ha'r quicker'n lightning.'    Seeing that the little fellow was considerably discouraged, Baldy  hastened to add:    'Ef you're keerful, younker, and I b'lieve yer generally be, take a  ride thar yerself, behind yer jumping-jack, but remember my advice and  stick to yer wagon.'    Having thus obtained permission of the hunter, Johnny Brainerd, as may  well be supposed, did not wait long before availing himself of his  privilege.    The weather, which had been threatening toward the latter part of the  day, entirely cleared away, and the next morning dawned remarkably  clear and beautiful. So the boy announced his intention of making the  expected visit, after which, he promised to devote himself entirely to  performing the duty of sentinel.    'Abeout what time may we look for you, neow!' asked Ethan, as he was  on the point of starting.    'Sometime this afternoon.'    'Come in before dark, as me mither used to observe to meself, when I  wint out shparkin',' added Mickey.    The boy promised to heed their warnings, and began firing up again.  The tank was completely filled with water, and the wagon filled nearly  full of wood, so that the two were capable of running the contrivance  for the entire day, provided there was no cessation, and that he was  on the 'go' continually.    Before starting, it was thoroughly oiled through and through, and put  in the best possible condition, and then waving them all a pleasant  farewell, he steamed gayly toward the mountains.    The ground was admirable, and the steam man traveled better than ever.  Like a locomotive, he seemed to have acquired a certain smoothness and  steadiness of motion, from the exercise he had already had, and the  sharp eye of the boy detected it at once. He saw that he had been very  fortunate indeed in constructing his wonderful invention, as it was  impossible for any human skill to give it any better movement than it  now possessed.    The first three or four miles were passed at a rattling gait, and the  boy was sitting on the front of his wagon, dreamily watching the play  of the huge engine, when it suddenly paused, and with such abruptness  that he was thrown forward from his seat, with violence, falling  directly between the legs of the monster, which seemed to stand  perfectly motionless, like the intelligent elephant that is fearful of  stirring a limb, lest he might crush his master lying beneath him.    The boy knew at once that some accident had happened, and unmindful of  the severe scratch he had received, he instantly clambered to his  feet, and began examining the machinery, first taking the precaution  to give vent to the surplus steam, which was rapidly gathering.    It was some time before he could discover the cause of difficulty, but  he finally ascertained that a small bolt had slipped loose, and had  caught in such a manner as to check the motion of the engine on the  instant.    Fortunately no permanent injury was done, and while he was making  matters right, he recollected that in chatting with the trapper as he  was on the point of starting, he had begun to screw on the bolt, when  his attention had been momentarily diverted, when it escaped his mind  altogether, so that he alone was to blame for the accident, which had  so narrowly escaped proving a serious one.    Making sure that everything was right, he remounted the wagon, and  cautiously resumed his journey, going very slowly at first, so as to  watch the play of the engine.    Everything moved with its usual smoothness, and lifting his gaze he  descried three buffaloes, standing with erect heads, staring  wonderingly at him.    'If you want a chase you may have it!' exclaimed the boy as he headed  toward them.                     CHAPTER XI. THE STEAM MAN ON A BUFFALO HUNT.    WITH A WILD snort of alarm, the three buffaloes turned tail and dashed  over the prairie, with the shrieking steam man in pursuit.    The boy had taken the precaution to bring a rifle with him. When he  saw them flee in this terrified manner, the thought came to him at  once that he would shoot one of them, and take a portion back to his  friends for their supper.    It would to a grand exploit for him, and he would be prouder of its  performance than he was of the construction of the wonderful steam  man.    The lumbering, rolling gait of the buffaloes was not a very rapid one,  and the boy found himself speedily overhauling them without  difficulty. They did not know enough to separate, but kept close  together, sometimes crowding and striking against each other in their  furious efforts to escape.    But, after the chase had continued some time, one of the animals began  to fall in the rear, and Johnny directed his attention toward him, as  he would be the most easy to secure.    This fellow was a huge bull that was slightly lame, which accounted  for his tardiness of gait. Frightened as he was, it was not that blind  terror which had seized the Indians when they discovered the steam man  so close at their heels. The bull was one of those creatures that if  closely pressed would turn and charge the monster. He was not one to  continue a fruitless flight, no matter who or what was his pursuer.    The boy was not aware of this sturdy trait in the animal, nor did he  dream of anything like resistance.    So he steadily drew toward him, until within twenty yards, when he let  go of his controlling rod, and picked up the rifle beside him. A  bullet from this, he supposed, would kill any animal, however large,  no matter at what portion of his body he aimed.    So raising partly to his feet, and steadying himself as well as he  could, he aimed for the lumping haunch of the animal. The ball buried  itself in his flank, and so retarded his speed, that the next moment  the boy found himself beside him.    The instant this took place, the bull lowered his head, and without  further warning, charged full at the steam man.    The boy saw the danger, but too late to stave it off. His immense head  struck the rear of the monster with such momentum that he was lifted  fully a foot from the ground, the concussion sounding like the crack of  a pistol.    Fortunately the shock did not materially injure the machine, although  the frightened boy expected to be capsized and killed by the  infuriated buffalo.    The latter, when he had made his plunge, instantly drew back for  another, which was sure to be fatal if made as fairly as the first.  The boy retained his presence of mind enough to let on full steam, and  the concern shot away at an extraordinary rate, bounding over the  ground so furiously that the billets of wood were thrown and scattered  in every direction, so that now, from being the pursuer, he had  speedily become the pursued. The tables were turned with a vengeance!    It was only by providential good fortune that young Brainerd escaped  instant destruction. The wonder was that the steam man was not so  injured as to be unable to travel, in which case the maddened bull  would have left little of him.    As it was, the experience of the boy was such as he could never  forget. When he turned his affrighted glance behind he saw the enraged  animal plunging furiously after him, his head lowered, his tongue out,  his eyes glaring, and his whole appearance that of the most brutal  ferocity.    Had the bull come in collision with the horse or man while in that  mood he would have made short work of him.    But great as was his speed, it could not equal that of the wonderful  steam man, who took such tremendous strides that a few minutes  sufficed to carry him beyond all danger.    Johnny quietly slacked off steam, but he kept up a good swinging gait,  not caring to renew his close acquaintance with his wounded enemy. The  latter speedily discovered he was losing ground, and finally gave up  the pursuit and trotted off at a leisurely rate to join his  companions, apparently none the worse for the slight wound he had  received.    As soon as the boy found himself beyond the reach of the animal's fury  he halted the man and made a minute examination of the machinery.    The head and horns of the buffalo had dented the iron skin of the  steam man, but the blow being distributed over a large area, inflicted  no other damage, if indeed this could be called damage of itself.    The boy was greatly pleased, not only at his escape but at the  admirable manner in which his invention had borne the shock of  collision. It gave him a confidence in it which hitherto he had not  felt.    Turning his face more toward the mountains, he"]]]
