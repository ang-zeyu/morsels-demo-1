But to make him some indemnification, MacGregor presented him  every year with a cow and a fat sheep; and no scruples as to the mode in  which the donor came by them are said to have affected the reverend  gentleman's conscience.    The following amount of the proceedings of Rob Roy, on an application to  him from one of his contractors, had in it something very interesting to  me, as told by an old countryman in the Lennox who was present on the  expedition. But as there is no point or marked incident in the story, and  as it must necessarily be without the half-frightened, half-bewildered  look with which the narrator accompanied his recollections, it may  possibly lose, its effect when transferred to paper.    My informant stated himself to have been a lad of fifteen, living with  his father on the estate of a gentleman in the Lennox, whose name I have  forgotten, in the capacity of herd. On a fine morning in the end of  October, the period when such calamities were almost always to be  apprehended, they found the Highland thieves had been down upon them, and  swept away ten or twelve head of cattle. Rob Roy was sent for, and came  with a party of seven or eight armed men. He heard with great gravity all  that could be told him of the circumstances of the _creagh,_ and  expressed his confidence that the _herd-widdiefows_* could not have  carried their booty far, and that he should be able to recover them.    * Mad herdsmen--a name given to cattle-stealers [properly one who  deserves to fill a _widdie,_ or halter].    He desired that two Lowlanders should be sent on the party, as it was not  to be expected that any of his gentlemen would take the trouble of  driving the cattle when he should recover possession of them. My  informant and his father were despatched on the expedition. They had no  good will to the journey; nevertheless, provided with a little food, and  with a dog to help them to manage the cattle, they set off with  MacGregor. They travelled a long day's journey in the direction of the  mountain Benvoirlich, and slept for the night in a ruinous hut or bothy.  The next morning they resumed their journey among the hills, Rob Roy  directing their course by signs and marks on the heath which my informant  did not understand.    About noon Rob commanded the armed party to halt, and to lie couched in  the heather where it was thickest. \"Do you and your son,\" he said to the  oldest Lowlander, \"go boldly over the hill;--you will see beneath you, in  a glen on the other side, your master's cattle, feeding, it may be, with  others; gather your own together, taking care to disturb no one else, and  drive them to this place. If any one speak to or threaten you, tell them  that I am here, at the head of twenty men.\"--\"But what if they abuse us,  or kill us?\" said the Lowland, peasant, by no means delighted at finding  the embassy imposed on him and his son. \"If they do you any wrong,\" said  Rob, \"I will never forgive them as long as I live.\" The Lowlander was by  no means content with this security, but did not think it safe to dispute  Rob's injunctions.      [Illustration: Cattle Lifting--000]      He and his son climbed the hill therefore, found a deep valley, where  there grazed, as Rob had predicted, a large herd of cattle. They  cautiously selected those which their master had lost, and took measures  to drive them over the hill. As soon as they began to remove them, they  were surprised by hearing cries and screams; and looking around in fear  and trembling they saw a woman seeming to have started out of the earth,  who _flyted_ at them, that is, scolded them, in Gaelic. When they  contrived, however, in the best Gaelic they could muster, to deliver the  message Rob Roy told them, she became silent, and disappeared without  offering them any further annoyance. The chief heard their story on their  return, and spoke with great complacency of the art which he possessed of  putting such things to rights without any unpleasant bustle. The party  were now on their road home, and the danger, though not the fatigue, of  the expedition was at an end.    They drove on the cattle with little repose until it was nearly dark,  when Rob proposed to halt for the night upon a wide moor, across which a  cold north-east wind, with frost on its wing, was whistling to the tune  of the Pipers of Strath-Dearn.*    * The winds which sweep a wild glen in Badenoch are so called.    The Highlanders, sheltered by their plaids, lay down on the heath  comfortably enough, but the Lowlanders had no protection whatever. Rob  Roy observing this, directed one of his followers to afford the old man a  portion of his plaid; \"for the callant (boy), he may,\" said the  freebooter, \"keep himself warm by walking about and watching the cattle.\"  My informant heard this sentence with no small distress; and as the frost  wind grew more and more cutting, it seemed to freeze the very blood in  his young veins. He had been exposed to weather all his life, he said,  but never could forget the cold of that night; insomuch that, in the  bitterness of his heart, he cursed the bright moon for giving no heat  with so much light. At length the sense of cold and weariness became so  intolerable that he resolved to desert his watch to seek some repose and  shelter. With that purpose he couched himself down behind one of the most  bulky of the Highlanders, who acted as lieutenant to the party. Not  satisfied with having secured the shelter of the man's large person, he  coveted a share of his plaid, and by imperceptible degrees drew a corner  of it round him. He was now comparatively in paradise, and slept sound  till daybreak, when he awoke, and was terribly afraid on observing that  his nocturnal operations had altogether uncovered the dhuiniewassell's  neck and shoulders, which, lacking the plaid which should have protected  them, were covered with _cranreuch_ (_i.e._ hoar frost). The lad rose in  great dread of a beating, at least, when it should be found how  luxuriously he had been accommodated at the expense of a principal person  of the party. Good Mr. Lieutenant, however, got up and shook himself,  rubbing off the hoar frost with his plaid, and muttering something of a  _cauld neight._ They then drove on the cattle, which were restored to  their owner without farther adventure--The above can hardly be termed a  tale, but yet it contains materials both for the poet and artist.    It was perhaps about the same time that, by a rapid march into the  Balquhidder hills at the head of a body of his own tenantry, the Duke of  Montrose actually surprised Rob Roy, and made him prisoner. He was  mounted behind one of the Duke's followers, named James Stewart, and made  fast to him by a horse-girth. The person who had him thus in charge was  grandfather of the intelligent man of the same name, now deceased, who  lately kept the inn in the vicinity of Loch Katrine, and acted as a guide  to visitors through that beautiful scenery. From him I learned the story  many years before he was either a publican, or a guide, except to  moorfowl shooters.--It was evening (to resume the story), and the Duke  was pressing on to lodge his prisoner, so long sought after in vain, in  some place of security, when, in crossing the Teith or Forth, I forget  which, MacGregor took an opportunity to conjure Stewart, by all the ties  of old acquaintance and good neighbourhood, to give him some chance of an  escape from an assured doom. Stewart was moved with compassion, perhaps  with fear. He slipt the girth-buckle, and Rob, dropping down from behind  the horse's croupe, dived, swam, and escaped, pretty much as described in  the Novel. When James Stewart came on shore, the Duke hastily demanded  where his prisoner was; and as no distinct answer was returned, instantly  suspected Stewart's connivance at the escape of the Outlaw; and, drawing  a steel pistol from his belt, struck him down with a blow on the head,  from the effects of which, his descendant said, he never completely  recovered.    In the success of his repeated escapes from the pursuit of his powerful  enemy, Rob Roy at length became wanton and facetious. He wrote a mock  challenge to the Duke, which he circulated among his friends to amuse  them over a bottle. The reader will find this document in the Appendix.*  It is written in a good hand, and not particularly deficient in grammar  or spelling.    * Appendix, No. III.    Our Southern readers must be given to understand that it was a piece of  humour,--a _quiz,_ in short,--on the part of the Outlaw, who was too  sagacious to propose such a rencontre in reality. This letter was written  in the year 1719.    In the following year Rob Roy composed another epistle, very little to  his own reputation, as he therein confesses having played booty during  the civil war of 1715. It is addressed to General Wade, at that time  engaged in disarming the Highland clans, and making military roads  through the country. The letter is a singular composition. It sets out  the writer's real and unfeigned desire to have offered his service to  King George, but for his liability to be thrown into jail for a civil  debt, at the instance of the Duke of Montrose. Being thus debarred from  taking the right side, he acknowledged he embraced the wrong one, upon  Falstaff's principle, that since the King wanted men and the rebels  soldiers, it were worse shame to be idle in such a stirring world, than  to embrace the worst side, were it as black as rebellion could make it.  The impossibility of his being neutral in such a debate, Rob seems to lay  down as an undeniable proposition. At the same time, while he  acknowledges having been forced into an unnatural rebellion against King  George, he pleads that he not only avoided acting offensively against his  Majesty's forces on all occasions, but, on the contrary, sent to them  what intelligence he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7026"],[0,"Children's Edition of Touching Incidents and Remarkable Answers to Prayer (#9)"],[1,"ing. I said \"Sing?\" She looked so happy and bowed her head.  I began singing: \"I am Jesus' little lamb.\" She bowed her head again.  In the forenoon she kept looking at her aunts, Ollie and Belle, and  pointing up. Oh! it meant so much. It seemed to me that she was saying,  that it meant: \"Meet me in heaven.\" Finally she motioned for me to raise  the window curtain. I did so and she looked out the window so eagerly,  as though she was expecting to see the little children. Then the little  blue eyes closed to open no more in this world, but in heaven.    --Mrs. L. Jones.        SHE DIED FOR HIM    [Illustration]    A poor emigrant had gone to Australia to \"make his fortune,\" leaving a  wife and little son in England. When he had made some money, he wrote  home to his wife: \"Come out to me here; I send the money for your passage;  I want to see you and my boy.\" The wife took ship as soon as she could,  and started for her new home. One night, as they were all asleep there  sounded the dreaded cry of \"Fire, fire!\" Everyone rushed on deck and the  boats were soon filled. The last one was just pushing off then a cry of  \"there are two more on deck,\" arose. They were the mother and her son.  Alas! \"Only room for one,\" the sailors shouted. Which was to go? The  mother thought of her far away home, her husband looking out lovingly  and longingly for his wife. Then she glanced at the boy, clinging  frightened to her skirts. She could not let him die. There was no time  to lose. Quick! quick! The flames were getting around. Snatching the  child, she held him to her a moment. \"Willie, tell Father I died for  you!\" Then the boy as lowered into the sailor's willing arms. She died  for him.    --Selected.    \"I DON'T LOVE YOU NOW, MOTHER\"    A great many years ago, I knew a lady who had been sick for two years,  as you have seen many a one, all the while slowly dying with consumption.  She had one child--a little boy named Henry.    One afternoon I was sitting by her side and it seemed as if she would  cough her life away. Her little boy stood by the post of the bed, his  blue eyes filled with tears to see her suffer so. By and by the terrible  cough ceased. Henry came and put his arms around his mother's neck,  nestled his head in his mother's bosom, and said, \"Mother, I do love  you; I wish you wasn't sick.\"    An hour later, the same loving, blue-eyed boy came in all aglow, stamping  the snow off his feet.    \"Oh, Mother, may I go skating? it is so nice--Ed and Charlie are going.\"      \"Henry,\" feebly said the mother, \"the ice is not hard enough yet.\"    \"But, Mother,\" very pettishly said the boy, \"you are sick all the time--  how do you know?\"    \"My child, you must obey me,\" gently said his mother.    \"It is too bad,\" angrily sobbed the boy, who an hour ago had so loved  his mother.    \"I would not like to have my little boy go,\" said the mother, looking  sadly at the little boy's face, all covered with frowns; \"you said you  loved me--be good.\"    \"No, I don't love you now, Mother,\" said the boy, going out and slamming  the door.    Again that dreadful coughing came upon her, and _we_ thought no  more of the boy. After the coughing had commenced, I noticed tears falling  thick upon her pillow, but she sank from exhaustion into a light sleep.      In a little while muffled steps of men's feet were heard coming into the  house, as though carrying something; and they were carrying the almost  lifeless body of Henry.    Angrily had he left his mother and gone to skate--disobeying her; and  then broken through the ice, sunk under the water, and now saved by a  great effort, was brought home barely alive to his sick mother.    I closed the doors feeling more danger for her life than the child's and  coming softly in, drew back the curtains from the bed. She spoke, \"I  heard them--it is Henry; oh, I knew he went--is he dead?\" But she never  seemed to hear the answer I gave her. She commenced coughing--she died  in agony--strangled to death. The poor mother! The boy's disobedience  killed her.    After a couple of hours I sought the boy's room.    [Illustration]    \"Oh, I wish I had not told mother I did not love her. Tomorrow I will  tell her I do,\" said the child sobbing painfully. My heart ached; tomorrow  I knew we must tell him she was dead. We did not till the child came  fully into the room, crying, \"Mother, I do love you.\"    Oh! may I never see agony like that child's, as the lips he kissed gave  back no kiss, as the hands he took fell lifeless from his hand, instead  of shaking his hand as it always had, and the boy knew she was dead.    \"Mother, I do love you now,\" all the day he sobbed and cried, \"O Mother,  Mother, forgive me.\" Then he would not leave his mother. \"Speak to me,  Mother!\" but she could never speak again, and he--the last words she had  ever heard him say, were, \"Mother, I don't love you now.\"    That boy's whole life was changed; sober and sad he was ever after. He  is now a gray haired old man, with one sorrow over his one act of  disobedience, one wrong word embittering all his life--with those words  ever ringing in his ears, \"Mother, I don't love you now.\"    Will the little ones who read this remember, if they disobey their mother,  if they are cross and naughty, they say every single time they do so,  to a tender mother's heart, by their actions if not in the words of  Henry, the very same thing, \"I don't love you now, Mother.\"        \"LITTLE MOTHER\"    She was a clear-eyed, fresh-cheeked little maiden, living on the banks  of the great Mississippi, the oldest of four children, and mother's  \"little woman\" always. They called her so because of her quiet, matronly  care of the younger Mayfields--that was the father's name. Her own name  was the beautiful one of Elizabeth, but they shortened it to Bess.    She was thirteen when one day Mr. Mayfield and his wife were called to  the nearest town, six miles away. \"Be mother's little woman, dear,\" said  Mrs. Mayfield as she kissed the rosy face. Her husband added: \"I leave  the children in your care, Bess; be a little mother to them.\"    Bess waved her old sun-bonnet vigorously, and held up the baby Rose,  that she might watch them to the last. Old Daddy Jim and Mammy had been  detailed by Mr. Mayfield to keep an unsuspected watch on the little  nestlings, and were to sleep at the house. Thus two days went by, when  Daddy Jim and Mammy begged to be allowed to go to the quarters where the  Negroes lived, to see their daughter, \"Jennie, who was pow'ful bad wid  the toothache.\" They declared they would be back by evening, so Bess was  willing. She put the little girls to bed and persuaded Rob to go; then  seated herself by the table with her mother's work-basket, in quaint  imitation of Mrs. Mayfield's industry in the evening time. But what was  this? Her feet touched something cold! She bent down and felt around  with her hand. A pool of water was spreading over the floor. She knew  what it was; the Mississippi had broken through the levee. What should  she do? Mammy's stories of how homes had been washed away and broken in  pieces were in her mind. \"Oh, if I had a boat!\" she exclaimed. \"But there  isn't anything of the sort on the place.\" She ran wildly out to look for  Mammy; and stumbled over something sitting near the edge of the porch.  A sudden inspiration took her. Here was her boat! a very large,  old-fashioned, oblong tub. The water was now several inches deep on the  porch and she contrived to half-float, half-row the tub into the room.    Without frightening the children she got them dressed in the warmest  clothes they had. She lined the oblong tub with a blanket, and made ready  bread and cold meat left from supper. With Rob's assistance she dragged  the tub upstairs. There was a single large window in the room, and they  set the tub directly by it, so that when the water rose the tub would  float out. There was no way for the children to reach the roof, which  was a very steep, inclined one. It did not seem long before the water  had very nearly risen to the top of the stairs leading from below.    Bess flung the window open, and made Rob get into their novel boat; then  she lifted in Kate, and finally baby Rose, who began to cry, was given  into Rob's arms, and now the little mother, taking the basket of food,  made ready to enter, too; but, lo! there was no room for her with safety  to the rest. Bess paused a moment, drew a long breath, and kissed the  children quietly. She explained to Rob that he must guard the basket,  and that they must sit still. \"Goodbye, dears. Say a prayer for sister,  Rob. If you ever see father and mother, tell them I took care of you.\"  Then the water seized the insecure vessel, and out into the dark night  it floated.    [Illustration: ]    The next day Mr. Mayfield, who, with his neighbors, scoured the broad  lake of eddying water that represented the Mississippi, discovered the  tub lodged in the branches of a sycamore with the children weeping and  chilled, but safe.    And Bess? Ah, where was Bess, the \"little mother,\" who in that brief  moment resigned herself to death? They found her later, floating on the  water with her brave childish face turned to the sky; and as strong arms  lifted her into the boat, the tears from every eye paid worthy tribute  to the \"little mother.\"    --_Detroit Free Press_        ROBBIE GOODMAN'S PRAYER    \"What can be the matter with Walter,\" thought Mama Ellis as she sat  sewing in her pleasant sitting-room. \"He came in so very quietly, closed  the door gently and I think I even heard him go to the closet to hang  up his books. Oh! dear. I hope he isn't going to have another attack of  'Grippe,'\" and Mrs. Ellis shivered as she glanced out at the snow-covered  landscape. As her eyes turned once more to the warm, luxurious room in  which she was seated, the portieres were pushed aside and a little boy of  ten years of age entered.
