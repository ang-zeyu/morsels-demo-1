He was a tall, weather beaten, sour looking man of  sixty or more.  His eyes were narrow and evil.  Captain Jacot did not  relish his appearance.    \"Well?\" he asked, tentatively.    The Arab came directly to the point.    \"Achmet ben Houdin is my sister's son,\" he said.  \"If you will give him  into my keeping I will see that he sins no more against the laws of the  French.\"    Jacot shook his head.  \"That cannot be,\" he replied.  \"I must take him  back with me.  He will be properly and fairly tried by a civil court.  If he is innocent he will be released.\"    \"And if he is not innocent?\" asked the Arab.    \"He is charged with many murders.  For any one of these, if he is  proved guilty, he will have to die.\"    The Arab's left hand was hidden beneath his burnous.  Now he withdrew  it disclosing a large goatskin purse, bulging and heavy with coins.  He  opened the mouth of the purse and let a handful of the contents trickle  into the palm of his right hand--all were pieces of good French gold.  From the size of the purse and its bulging proportions Captain Jacot  concluded that it must contain a small fortune.  Sheik Amor ben Khatour  dropped the spilled gold pieces one by one back into the purse.  Jacot  was eyeing him narrowly.  They were alone.  The sergeant, having  introduced the visitor, had withdrawn to some little distance--his back  was toward them.  Now the sheik, having returned all the gold pieces,  held the bulging purse outward upon his open palm toward Captain Jacot.    \"Achmet ben Houdin, my sister's son, MIGHT escape tonight,\" he said.  \"Eh?\"    Captain Armand Jacot flushed to the roots of his close-cropped hair.  Then he went very white and took a half-step toward the Arab.  His  fists were clenched.  Suddenly he thought better of whatever impulse  was moving him.    \"Sergeant!\" he called.  The non-commissioned officer hurried toward  him, saluting as his heels clicked together before his superior.    \"Take this black dog back to his people,\" he ordered.  \"See that they  leave at once.  Shoot the first man who comes within range of camp  tonight.\"    Sheik Amor ben Khatour drew himself up to his full height.  His evil  eyes narrowed.  He raised the bag of gold level with the eyes of the  French officer.    \"You will pay more than this for the life of Achmet ben Houdin, my  sister's son,\" he said.  \"And as much again for the name that you have  called me and a hundred fold in sorrow in the bargain.\"    \"Get out of here!\" growled Captain Armand Jacot, \"before I kick you  out.\"    All of this happened some three years before the opening of this tale.  The trail of Achmet ben Houdin and his accomplices is a matter of  record--you may verify it if you care to.  He met the death he  deserved, and he met it with the stoicism of the Arab.    A month later little Jeanne Jacot, the seven-year-old daughter of  Captain Armand Jacot, mysteriously disappeared.  Neither the wealth of  her father and mother, or all the powerful resources of the great  republic were able to wrest the secret of her whereabouts from the  inscrutable desert that had swallowed her and her abductor.    A reward of such enormous proportions was offered that many adventurers  were attracted to the hunt.  This was no case for the modern detective  of civilization, yet several of these threw themselves into the  search--the bones of some are already bleaching beneath the African sun  upon the silent sands of the Sahara.    Two Swedes, Carl Jenssen and Sven Malbihn, after three years of  following false leads at last gave up the search far to the south of  the Sahara to turn their attention to the more profitable business of  ivory poaching.  In a great district they were already known for their  relentless cruelty and their greed for ivory.  The natives feared and  hated them.  The European governments in whose possessions they worked  had long sought them; but, working their way slowly out of the north  they had learned many things in the no-man's-land south of the Sahara  which gave them immunity from capture through easy avenues of escape  that were unknown to those who pursued them.  Their raids were sudden  and swift.  They seized ivory and retreated into the trackless wastes  of the north before the guardians of the territory they raped could be  made aware of their presence.  Relentlessly they slaughtered elephants  themselves as well as stealing ivory from the natives.  Their following  consisted of a hundred or more renegade Arabs and Negro slaves--a  fierce, relentless band of cut-throats.  Remember them--Carl Jenssen  and Sven Malbihn, yellow-bearded, Swedish giants--for you will meet  them later.      In the heart of the jungle, hidden away upon the banks of a small  unexplored tributary of a large river that empties into the Atlantic  not so far from the equator, lay a small, heavily palisaded village.  Twenty palm-thatched, beehive huts sheltered its black population,  while a half-dozen goat skin tents in the center of the clearing housed  the score of Arabs who found shelter here while, by trading and  raiding, they collected the cargoes which their ships of the desert  bore northward twice each year to the market of Timbuktu.    Playing before one of the Arab tents was a little girl of ten--a  black-haired, black-eyed little girl who, with her nut-brown skin and  graceful carriage looked every inch a daughter of the desert.  Her  little fingers were busily engaged in fashioning a skirt of grasses for  a much-disheveled doll which a kindly disposed slave had made for her a  year or two before.  The head of the doll was rudely chipped from  ivory, while the body was a rat skin stuffed with grass.  The arms and  legs were bits of wood, perforated at one end and sewn to the rat skin  torso.  The doll was quite hideous and altogether disreputable and  soiled, but Meriem thought it the most beautiful and adorable thing in  the whole world, which is not so strange in view of the fact that it  was the only object within that world upon which she might bestow her  confidence and her love.    Everyone else with whom Meriem came in contact was, almost without  exception, either indifferent to her or cruel.  There was, for example,  the old black hag who looked after her, Mabunu--toothless, filthy and  ill tempered.  She lost no opportunity to cuff the little girl, or even  inflict minor tortures upon her, such as pinching, or, as she had twice  done, searing the tender flesh with hot coals.  And there was The  Sheik, her father.  She feared him more than she did Mabunu.  He often  scolded her for nothing, quite habitually terminating his tirades by  cruelly beating her, until her little body was black and blue.    But when she was alone she was happy, playing with Geeka, or decking  her hair with wild flowers, or making ropes of grasses.  She was always  busy and always singing--when they left her alone.  No amount of  cruelty appeared sufficient to crush the innate happiness and sweetness  from her full little heart.  Only when The Sheik was near was she quiet  and subdued.  Him she feared with a fear that was at times almost  hysterical terror. She feared the gloomy jungle too--the cruel jungle  that surrounded the little village with chattering monkeys and  screaming birds by day and the roaring and coughing and moaning of the  carnivora by night.  Yes, she feared the jungle; but so much more did  she fear The Sheik that many times it was in her childish head to run  away, out into the terrible jungle forever rather than longer to face  the ever present terror of her father.    As she sat there this day before The Sheik's goatskin tent, fashioning  a skirt of grasses for Geeka, The Sheik appeared suddenly approaching.  Instantly the look of happiness faded from the child's face.  She  shrunk aside in an attempt to scramble from the path of the  leathern-faced old Arab; but she was not quick enough.  With a brutal  kick the man sent her sprawling upon her face, where she lay quite  still, tearless but trembling.  Then, with an oath at her, the man  passed into the tent.  The old, black hag shook with appreciative  laughter, disclosing an occasional and lonesome yellow fang.    When she was sure The Sheik had gone, the little girl crawled to the  shady side of the tent, where she lay quite still, hugging Geeka close  to her breast, her little form racked at long intervals with choking  sobs.  She dared not cry aloud, since that would have brought The Sheik  upon her again.  The anguish in her little heart was not alone the  anguish of physical pain; but that infinitely more pathetic anguish--of  love denied a childish heart that yearns for love.    Little Meriem could scarce recall any other existence than that of the  stern cruelty of The Sheik and Mabunu.  Dimly, in the back of her  childish memory there lurked a blurred recollection of a gentle mother;  but Meriem was not sure but that even this was but a dream picture  induced by her own desire for the caresses she never received, but  which she lavished upon the much loved Geeka.  Never was such a spoiled  child as Geeka.  Its little mother, far from fashioning her own conduct  after the example set her by her father and nurse, went to the extreme  of indulgence.  Geeka was kissed a thousand times a day.  There was  play in which Geeka was naughty; but the little mother never punished.  Instead, she caressed and fondled; her attitude influenced solely by  her own pathetic desire for love.    Now, as she pressed Geeka close to her, her sobs lessened gradually,  until she was able to control her voice, and pour out her misery into  the ivory ear of her only confidante.    \"Geeka loves Meriem,\" she whispered.  \"Why does The Sheik, my father,  not love me, too?  Am I so naughty?  I try to be good; but I never know  why he strikes me, so I cannot tell what I have done which displeases  him.  Just now "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/903"],[0,"The White Company (#9)"],[1," was completed by a peasant in a rude dress of  undyed sheepskin, with the old-fashioned galligaskins about his legs,  and a gayly dressed young man with striped cloak jagged at the edges  and parti-colored hosen, who looked about him with high disdain upon his  face, and held a blue smelling-flask to his nose with one hand, while he  brandished a busy spoon with the other. In the corner a very fat man was  lying all a-sprawl upon a truss, snoring stertorously, and evidently in  the last stage of drunkenness.    \"That is Wat the limner,\" quoth the landlady, sitting down beside  Alleyne, and pointing with the ladle to the sleeping man. \"That is he  who paints the signs and the tokens. Alack and alas that ever I should  have been fool enough to trust him! Now, young man, what manner of a  bird would you suppose a pied merlin to be--that being the proper sign  of my hostel?\"    \"Why,\" said Alleyne, \"a merlin is a bird of the same form as an eagle or  a falcon. I can well remember that learned brother Bartholomew, who is  deep in all the secrets of nature, pointed one out to me as we walked  together near Vinney Ridge.\"    \"A falcon or an eagle, quotha? And pied, that is of two several colors.  So any man would say except this barrel of lies. He came to me, look  you, saying that if I would furnish him with a gallon of ale, wherewith  to strengthen himself as he worked, and also the pigments and a board,  he would paint for me a noble pied merlin which I might hang along with  the blazonry over my door. I, poor simple fool, gave him the ale and all  that he craved, leaving him alone too, because he said that a man's mind  must be left untroubled when he had great work to do. When I came back  the gallon jar was empty, and he lay as you see him, with the board in  front of him with this sorry device.\" She raised up a panel which was  leaning against the wall, and showed a rude painting of a scraggy and  angular fowl, with very long legs and a spotted body.    \"Was that,\" she asked, \"like the bird which thou hast seen?\"    Alleyne shook his head, smiling.    \"No, nor any other bird that ever wagged a feather. It is most like a  plucked pullet which has died of the spotted fever. And scarlet too!  What would the gentles Sir Nicholas Boarhunte, or Sir Bernard Brocas, of  Roche Court, say if they saw such a thing--or, perhaps, even the King's  own Majesty himself, who often has ridden past this way, and who loves  his falcons as he loves his sons? It would be the downfall of my house.\"    \"The matter is not past mending,\" said Alleyne. \"I pray you, good dame,  to give me those three pigment-pots and the brush, and I shall try  whether I cannot better this painting.\"    Dame Eliza looked doubtfully at him, as though fearing some other  stratagem, but, as he made no demand for ale, she finally brought the  paints, and watched him as he smeared on his background, talking the  while about the folk round the fire.    \"The four forest lads must be jogging soon,\" she said. \"They bide at  Emery Down, a mile or more from here. Yeomen prickers they are, who tend  to the King's hunt. The gleeman is called Floyting Will. He comes from  the north country, but for many years he hath gone the round of the  forest from Southampton to Christchurch. He drinks much and pays little  but it would make your ribs crackle to hear him sing the 'Jest of Hendy  Tobias.' Mayhap he will sing it when the ale has warmed him.\"    \"Who are those next to him?\" asked Alleyne, much interested. \"He of the  fur mantle has a wise and reverent face.\"    \"He is a seller of pills and salves, very learned in humors, and rheums,  and fluxes, and all manner of ailments. He wears, as you perceive, the  vernicle of Sainted Luke, the first physician, upon his sleeve. May good  St. Thomas of Kent grant that it may be long before either I or mine  need his help! He is here to-night for herbergage, as are the others  except the foresters. His neighbor is a tooth-drawer. That bag at his  girdle is full of the teeth that he drew at Winchester fair. I warrant  that there are more sound ones than sorry, for he is quick at his work  and a trifle dim in the eye. The lusty man next him with the red head  I have not seen before. The four on this side are all workers, three  of them in the service of the bailiff of Sir Baldwin Redvers, and the  other, he with the sheepskin, is, as I hear, a villein from the midlands  who hath run from his master. His year and day are well-nigh up, when he  will be a free man.\"    \"And the other?\" asked Alleyne in a whisper. \"He is surely some very  great man, for he looks as though he scorned those who were about him.\"    The landlady looked at him in a motherly way and shook her head. \"You  have had no great truck with the world,\" she said, \"or you would have  learned that it is the small men and not the great who hold their noses  in the air. Look at those shields upon my wall and under my eaves. Each  of them is the device of some noble lord or gallant knight who hath  slept under my roof at one time or another. Yet milder men or easier to  please I have never seen: eating my bacon and drinking my wine with a  merry face, and paying my score with some courteous word or jest which  was dearer to me than my profit. Those are the true gentles. But your  chapman or your bearward will swear that there is a lime in the wine,  and water in the ale, and fling off at the last with a curse instead of  a blessing. This youth is a scholar from Cambrig, where men are wont to  be blown out by a little knowledge, and lose the use of their hands in  learning the laws of the Romans. But I must away to lay down the beds.  So may the saints keep you and prosper you in your undertaking!\"    Thus left to himself, Alleyne drew his panel of wood where the light of  one of the torches would strike full upon it, and worked away with all  the pleasure of the trained craftsman, listening the while to the talk  which went on round the fire. The peasant in the sheepskins, who had  sat glum and silent all evening, had been so heated by his flagon of ale  that he was talking loudly and angrily with clenched hands and flashing  eyes.    \"Sir Humphrey Tennant of Ashby may till his own fields for me,\" he  cried. \"The castle has thrown its shadow upon the cottage over long.  For three hundred years my folk have swinked and sweated, day in and day  out, to keep the wine on the lord's table and the harness on the lord's  back. Let him take off his plates and delve himself, if delving must be  done.\"    \"A proper spirit, my fair son!\" said one of the free laborers. \"I would  that all men were of thy way of thinking.\"    \"He would have sold me with his acres,\" the other cried, in a  voice which was hoarse with passion. \"'The man, the woman and their  litter'--so ran the words of the dotard bailiff. Never a bullock on the  farm was sold more lightly. Ha! he may wake some black night to find  the flames licking about his ears--for fire is a good friend to the  poor man, and I have seen a smoking heap of ashes where over night there  stood just such another castlewick as Ashby.\"    \"This is a lad of mettle!\" shouted another of the laborers. \"He dares to  give tongue to what all men think. Are we not all from Adam's loins, all  with flesh and blood, and with the same mouth that must needs have food  and drink? Where all this difference then between the ermine cloak and  the leathern tunic, if what they cover is the same?\"    \"Aye, Jenkin,\" said another, \"our foeman is under the stole and the  vestment as much as under the helmet and plate of proof. We have as much  to fear from the tonsure as from the hauberk. Strike at the noble and  the priest shrieks, strike at priest and the noble lays his hand upon  glaive. They are twin thieves who live upon our labor.\"    \"It would take a clever man to live upon thy labor, Hugh,\" remarked one  of the foresters, \"seeing that the half of thy time is spent in swilling  mead at the 'Pied Merlin.'\"    \"Better that than stealing the deer that thou art placed to guard, like  some folk I know.\"    \"If you dare open that swine's mouth against me,\" shouted the woodman,  \"I'll crop your ears for you before the hangman has the doing of it,  thou long-jawed lackbrain.\"    \"Nay, gentles, gentles!\" cried Dame Eliza, in a singsong heedless voice,  which showed that such bickerings were nightly things among her guests.  \"No brawling or brabbling, gentles! Take heed to the good name of the  house.\"    \"Besides, if it comes to the cropping of ears, there are other folk who  may say their say,\" quoth the third laborer. \"We are all freemen, and  I trow that a yeoman's cudgel is as good as a forester's knife. By  St. Anselm! it would be an evil day if we had to bend to our master's  servants as well as to our masters.\"    \"No man is my master save the King,\" the woodman answered. \"Who is  there, save a false traitor, who would refuse to serve the English  king?\"    \"I know not about the English king,\" said the man Jenkin. \"What sort of  English king is it who cannot lay his tongue to a word of English? You  mind last year when he came down to Malwood, with his inner marshal and  his outer marshal, his justiciar, his seneschal, and his four and twenty  guardsmen. One noontide I was by Franklin Swinton's gate, when up he  rides with a yeoman pricker at his heels. 'Ouvre,' he cried, 'ouvre,' or  some such word, making signs for me to open the gate; and then 'Merci,'  as though he were adrad of me. And you talk of an English king?\"    \"I do not marvel at it,\" cried the Cambrig scholar, speaking in the high  drawling voice which was common among his class. \"It is not a tongue  for men of sweet birth and delicate upbringing. It is a foul, snorting,  snarling manner of speech. For myself, I swear by the learned Polycarp  that I have most ease with Hebrew, and after that perchance with  Arabian.\"    \"I will not hear a word said against old King Ned,\" cried Hordle John"]]]
