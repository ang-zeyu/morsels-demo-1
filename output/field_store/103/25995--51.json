Marionetta made many ineffectual attempts to extract from Scythrop the  secret of his mystery; and, in despair of drawing it from himself,  began to form hopes that she might find a clue to it from Mr Flosky,  who was Scythrop's dearest friend, and was more frequently than any  other person admitted to his solitary tower. Mr Flosky, however, had  ceased to be visible in a morning. He was engaged in the composition  of a dismal ballad; and, Marionetta's uneasiness overcoming her  scruples of decorum, she determined to seek him in the apartment which  he had chosen for his study. She tapped at the door, and at the sound  'Come in,' entered the apartment. It was noon, and the sun was shining  in full splendour, much to the annoyance of Mr Flosky, who had  obviated the inconvenience by closing the shutters, and drawing  the window-curtains. He was sitting at his table by the light of a  solitary candle, with a pen in one hand, and a muffineer in the other,  with which he occasionally sprinkled salt on the wick, to make it burn  blue. He sat with 'his eye in a fine frenzy rolling,' and turned his  inspired gaze on Marionetta as if she had been the ghastly ladie of  a magical vision; then placed his hand before his eyes, with an  appearance of manifest pain--shook his head--withdrew his hand--rubbed  his eyes, like a waking man--and said, in a tone of ruefulness most  jeremitaylorically pathetic, 'To what am I to attribute this very  unexpected pleasure, my dear Miss O'Carroll?'      MARIONETTA    I must apologise for intruding on you, Mr Flosky; but the interest  which I--you--take in my cousin Scythrop--      MR FLOSKY    Pardon me, Miss O'Carroll; I do not take any interest in any person or  thing on the face of the earth; which sentiment, if you analyse it,  you will find to be the quintessence of the most refined philanthropy.      MARIONETTA    I will take it for granted that it is so, Mr Flosky; I am not  conversant with metaphysical subtleties, but--      MR FLOSKY    Subtleties! my dear Miss O'Carroll. I am sorry to find you  participating in the vulgar error of the _reading public,_ to whom  an unusual collocation of words, involving a juxtaposition of  antiperistatical ideas, immediately suggests the notion of  hyperoxysophistical paradoxology.      MARIONETTA    Indeed, Mr Flosky, it suggests no such notion to me. I have sought you  for the purpose of obtaining information.      MR FLOSKY _(shaking his head)_    No one ever sought me for such a purpose before.      MARIONETTA    I think, Mr Flosky--that is, I believe--that is, I fancy--that is, I  imagine--      MR FLOSKY    The [Greek: toytesti], the _id est_, the _cioe_, the _c'est a dire_,  the _that is_, my dear Miss O'Carroll, is not applicable in this  case--if you will permit me to take the liberty of saying so. Think  is not synonymous with believe--for belief, in many most important  particulars, results from the total absence, the absolute negation of  thought, and is thereby the sane and orthodox condition of mind; and  thought and belief are both essentially different from fancy, and  fancy, again, is distinct from imagination. This distinction between  fancy and imagination is one of the most abstruse and important points  of metaphysics. I have written seven hundred pages of promise to  elucidate it, which promise I shall keep as faithfully as the bank  will its promise to pay.      MARIONETTA    I assure you, Mr Flosky, I care no more about metaphysics than I do  about the bank; and, if you will condescend to talk to a simple girl  in intelligible terms--      MR FLOSKY    Say not condescend! Know you not that you talk to the most humble of  men, to one who has buckled on the armour of sanctity, and clothed  himself with humility as with a garment?      MARIONETTA    My cousin Scythrop has of late had an air of mystery about him, which  gives me great uneasiness.      MR FLOSKY    That is strange: nothing is so becoming to a man as an air of mystery.  Mystery is the very key-stone of all that is beautiful in poetry, all  that is sacred in faith, and all that is recondite in transcendental  psychology. I am writing a ballad which is all mystery; it is 'such  stuff as dreams are made of,' and is, indeed, stuff made of a dream;  for, last night I fell asleep as usual over my book, and had a vision  of pure reason. I composed five hundred lines in my sleep; so that,  having had a dream of a ballad, I am now officiating as my own Peter  Quince, and making a ballad of my dream, and it shall be called  Bottom's Dream, because it has no bottom.      MARIONETTA    I see, Mr Flosky, you think my intrusion unseasonable, and are  inclined to punish it, by talking nonsense to me. (_Mr Flosky gave a  start at the word nonsense, which almost overturned the table._) I  assure you, I would not have intruded if I had not been very much  interested in the question I wish to ask you.--(_Mr Flosky listened  in sullen dignity._)--My cousin Scythrop seems to have some secret  preying on his mind.--(_Mr Flosky was silent._)--He seems very  unhappy--Mr Flosky.--Perhaps you are acquainted with the cause.--(_Mr  Flosky was still silent._)--I only wish to know--Mr Flosky--if it is  any thing--that could be remedied by any thing--that any one--of whom  I know any thing--could do.      MR FLOSKY (_after a pause_)    There are various ways of getting at secrets. The most approved  methods, as recommended both theoretically and practically in  philosophical novels, are eavesdropping at key-holes, picking the  locks of chests and desks, peeping into letters, steaming wafers, and  insinuating hot wire under sealing wax; none of which methods I hold  it lawful to practise.      MARIONETTA    Surely, Mr Flosky, you cannot suspect me of wishing to adopt or  encourage such base and contemptible arts.      MR FLOSKY    Yet are they recommended, and with well-strung reasons, by writers of  gravity and note, as simple and easy methods of studying character,  and gratifying that laudable curiosity which aims at the knowledge of  man.      MARIONETTA    I am as ignorant of this morality which you do not approve, as of the  metaphysics which you do: I should be glad to know by your means, what  is the matter with my cousin; I do not like to see him unhappy, and I  suppose there is some reason for it.      MR FLOSKY    Now I should rather suppose there is no reason for it: it is the  fashion to be unhappy. To have a reason for being so would be  exceedingly common-place: to be so without any is the province of  genius: the art of being miserable for misery's sake, has been brought  to great perfection in our days; and the ancient Odyssey, which held  forth a shining example of the endurance of real misfortune, will  give place to a modern one, setting out a more instructive picture of  querulous impatience under imaginary evils.      MARIONETTA    Will you oblige me, Mr Flosky, by giving me a plain answer to a plain  question?      MR FLOSKY    It is impossible, my dear Miss O'Carroll. I never gave a plain answer  to a question in my life.      MARIONETTA    Do you, or do you not, know what is the matter with my cousin?      MR FLOSKY    To say that I do not know, would be to say that I am ignorant of  something; and God forbid, that a transcendental metaphysician, who  has pure anticipated cognitions of every thing, and carries the whole  science of geometry in his head without ever having looked into  Euclid, should fall into so empirical an error as to declare himself  ignorant of any thing: to say that I do know, would be to pretend to  positive and circumstantial knowledge touching present matter of fact,  which, when you consider the nature of evidence, and the various  lights in which the same thing may be seen--      MARIONETTA    I see, Mr Flosky, that either you have no information, or are  determined not to impart it; and I beg your pardon for having given  you this unnecessary trouble.      MR FLOSKY    My dear Miss O'Carroll, it would have given me great pleasure to have  said any thing that would have given you pleasure; but if any person  living could make report of having obtained any information on any  subject from Ferdinando Flosky, my transcendental reputation would be  ruined for ever.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER IX      Scythrop grew every day more reserved, mysterious, and distrait; and  gradually lengthened the duration of his diurnal seclusions in his  tower. Marionetta thought she perceived in all this very manifest  symptoms of a warm love cooling.    It was seldom that she found herself alone with him in the morning,  and, on these occasions, if she was silent in the hope of his speaking  first, not a syllable would he utter; if she spoke to him indirectly,  he assented monosyllabically; if she questioned him, his answers  were brief, constrained, and evasive. Still, though her spirits were  depressed, her playfulness had not so totally forsaken her, but that  it illuminated at intervals the gloom of Nightmare Abbey; and if, on  any occasion, she observed in Scythrop tokens of unextinguished or  returning passion, her love of tormenting her lover immediately got  the better both of her grief and her sympathy, though not of her  curiosity, which Scythrop seemed determined not to satisfy. This  playfulness, however, was in a great measure artificial, and usually  vanished with the irritable Strephon, to whose annoyance it had been  exerted. The Genius Loci, the _tutela_ of Nightmare Abbey, the  spirit of black melancholy, began to set his seal on her pallescent  countenance. Scythrop perceived the change, found his tender  sympathies awakened, and did his utmost to comfort the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9914"],[0,"The Babylonian Legends of the Creation (#9)"],[1,"spear, he attached it to [his belly],    37.

He set the lightning in front of him.    40. His body was filled with a glancing flame of fire.    41. He made a net wherewith to enclose Tiamat.    42. He made the four winds to take up their position so that no part  of her might escape,    [Illustration: Portion of a tablet inscribed in Babylonian with a text  of the Fourth Tablet of the Creation Series.

The Lord raised up the wind storm, his mighty weapon.    50. He went up into his chariot, the unequalled and terrible  tempest.[1]    [Footnote 1: Compare Psalms xviii, 7-15; civ, i ff.]    51. He equipped it, he yoked thereto a team of four horses,    52. Pawing the ground, champing, foaming [eager to] fly,    53. ... [the odour] of their teeth bore foetidness,    54. They were skilled [in biting], they were trained to trample under  foot.    [Lines 55-57 too fragmentary to translate; they continue the  description of Marduk's equipment.]    58.

On his lips ... he restrained    62. ... his hand grasped.    63. At that moment the gods were gazing upon him with fixed intensity,    64. The gods, his fathers, gazed upon him, they gazed upon him.    65. The Lord approached, he looked upon the middle of Tiamat,    66. He searched out the plan of Kingu, her husband.    67. Marduk looked, Kingu staggered in his gait,    68. His will was destroyed, his motion was paralysed.    69. And the gods his helpers who were marching by his side    70. Saw the [collapse of] their chief and their sight was troubled.    71. Tiamat [shrieked but] did not turn her head.    72. With lips full of [rebellious words] she maintained her  stubbornness    73. [Saying], \"... that thou hast come as the Lord of the gods,  [forsooth],    74. \"They have appointed thee in the place which should be theirs.\"    75. The Lord raised up the wind-storm, his mighty weapon,    76. [Against] Tiamat, who was furious (?), he sent it, [saying]:    77. \"[Thou hast made thyself] mighty, thou art puffed upon high,    78. \"Thy heart [hath stirred thee up] to invoke battle    79. \"... their fathers ...    80. \"...    81. \"[Thou hast exalted Kingu to be [thy] husband,    82. \"[Thou hast made him to usurp] the attributes of Anu    83. \"... thou hast planned evil.    84. \"[Against] the gods, my fathers, thou hast wrought evil.    85. \"Let now thy troops gird themselves up, let them bind on their  weapons.    86. \"Stand up! Thou and I, let us to the fight!\"    87. On hearing these words Tiamat    88. Became like a mad thing, her senses became distraught,    89. Tiamat uttered shrill cries again and again.    90. That on which she stood split in twain at the words,    91. She recited an incantation, she pronounced her spell.    92. The gods of battle demanded their weapons.[1]    [Footnote 1: I.e., the gods were impatient to begin the fight.]    93. Tiamat and Marduk, the envoy of the gods, roused themselves,    94. They advanced to fight each other, they drew nigh in battle.    95. The Lord cast his net and made it to enclose her,    96. The evil wind that had its place behind him he let out in her  face.    97. Tiamat opened her mouth to its greatest extent,    98. Marduk made the evil wind to enter [it] whilst her lips were  unclosed.    99. The raging winds filled out her belly,    100. Her heart was gripped, she opened wide her mouth [panting].    101. Marduk grasped the spear, he split up her belly,    102. He clave open her bowels, he pierced [her] heart,    103. He brought her to nought, he destroyed her life.    104. He cast down her carcase, he took up his stand upon it,    105. After Marduk had slain Tiamat the chief,    106. Her host was scattered, her levies became fugitive,    107. And the gods, her allies, who had marched at her side,    108. Quaked with terror, and broke and ran    109. And betook themselves to flight to save their lives.    110. But they found themselves hemmed in, they could not escape,    111. Marduk tied them up, he smashed their weapons.    112. They were cast into the net, and they were caught in the snare,    113.

He crushed, he esteemed him [as little worth] as the god Dugga,  (as a dead god?).    121. Marduk took from him the TABLET OF DESTINIES, which should never  have been his,    122. He sealed it with a seal[1] and fastened it on his breast    [Footnote 1: By impressing his seal on the Tablet Marduk proved his  ownership of the Tablet, and made his claim to it legal.]    123. After he had crushed and overthrown his enemies,    124. He made the haughty enemy to be like the dust underfoot.    125. He established completely Anshar's victory over the enemy,    126. The valiant Marduk achieved the object of Nudimmud (Ea),[1]    [Footnote 1: This is an oblique way of saying that Marduk succeeded  where Ea failed.]    127. He imposed strict restraint on the gods whom he had made captive.    128. He turned back to Tiamat whom he had defeated,    129. The Lord [Marduk] trampled on the rump of Tiamat,    130. With his unsparing club he clave her skull.    131. He slit open the channels (i.e., arteries) of her blood.    132. He caused the North Wind to carry it away to a place underground.    133. His fathers (i.e., the gods) looked on, they rejoiced, they were  glad.    134. They brought unto him offerings of triumph and peace,    135. The Lord [Marduk] paused, he examined Tiamat's carcase.    136. He separated flesh [from] hair,[1] he worked cunningly.    [Footnote 1: The word is _kupu_, i.e., \"reed\" or \"sedge.\"  It is possible that Marduk skinned Tiamat.]    137. He slit Tiamat open like a flat (?) fish [cut into] two pieces,    138. The one half he raised up and shaded the heavens therewith,    139. He pulled the bolt, he posted a guard,    140. He ordered them not to let her water escape.    141. He crossed heaven, he contemplated the regions thereof.    142. He betook himself to the abode of Nudimmud (Ea) that is opposite  to the Deep (Apsu),    143. The Lord Marduk measured the dimensions of the Deep,    144. He founded E-Sharra, a place like unto it,    145. The abode E-Sharra, which he made to be heaven.    146. He made the-gods Anu, Bel and Ea to inhabit their [own] cities.        FIFTH TABLET.    1. He appointed the Stations for the great gods,    2. He set in heaven the Stars of the Zodiac which are their  likenesses.    3. He fixed the year, he appointed the limits thereof.    4. He set up for the twelve months three stars apiece.    5. According to the day of the year he ... figures.    6. He founded the Station of Nibir (Jupiter) to settle their  boundaries,    7. That none might exceed or fall short.    8. He set the Station of Bel and Ea thereby.    9. He opened great gates under shelter on both sides.    10. He made a strong corridor on the left and on the right.    11. He fixed the zenith in the heavenly vault (?)    12. He gave the god Nannar (i.e., the Moon-god) his brightness  and committed the night to his care.    [Illustration: Portion of a tablet inscribed in Assyrian with a text  of the Fifth Tablet of the Creation Series. [K. 3567.]]    13. He set him for the government of the night, to determine the day    14. Monthly, without fail, he set him in a crown (i.e., disk)  [saying]:    15. \"At the beginning of the month when thou risest over the land,    16. \"Make [thy] horns to project to limit six days [of the month]    17. \"On the seventh day make thyself like a crown.    18. \"On the fourteenth day ...

The gods, his (Marduk's) fathers, looked on the net which he had  made,    76. They observed how craftily the bow had been constructed,    77. They extolled the work which he had done.    78. [Then] the god Anu lifted up [the bow] in the company of the gods,    79. He kissed the bow [saying]: \"That ...\"    80. He proclaimed [the names] of the bow to be as follows:--    81. \"Verily, the first is 'Long Wood,' the second is ...    82. \"Its third name is 'Bow Star in heaven' ...\"    83. He fixed a station for it ...    [Of the remaining 57 lines of this tablet only fragments of 17 lines  are preserved, and these yield no connected sense.]        SIXTH TABLET.    1.
