In addition to these officers of the wards and  the stakes, there is in each stake a quorum of High Priests, and one  or more quorums of Elders. These constitute the standing ministry in  the stakes of Zion, and are authorized to teach the gospel, to warn  all men against evil, and to invite and persuade all men to come  unto Christ. These are the provisions made for the home ministry, in  the Church organization proper. Time will not admit reference to the  auxiliary organizations--the Sabbath schools, Improvement associations,  Relief societies, Primary societies, and Religion classes. But from  the fireside of the people to the public assembly of worship; from the  cradle to the grave, every provision is made for carrying on the work  of the ministry, at home, instructing the Saints in the things of God,  inviting all to come unto Christ; the object of the Church being to  lift to higher, and ever higher levels the lives of the Saints of God,  until they shall become perfect men and women in Christ Jesus the Lord.  Such are the arrangements, in brief, for the home ministry.    Notwithstanding the clear distinction between the foreign ministry  and the home ministry, the lines that separate them may be crossed  on occasion. You remember how Paul compares the Church of Christ to  the body of a man, and insists that every member and every organ is  necessary to the perfect working of that organism; that the head cannot  say to the feet, I have no need of thee; neither can the feet say to  the head, I have no need of thee; nor the hand to the eye, I have no  need of thee; all the members of the body, he argues, are necessary.  Now, what would you think of a body that possessed a right hand and  left hand, yet the right hand would not at need come to the help of  the left hand; or the left hand refuse to come to the aid of the right  hand? You expect the two hands and arms of a man's body to help each  other, under the direction of the intelligence of the mind. And so in  the Church of Christ: the home ministry and the foreign ministry cross  the line of separation as occasion requires, and come to the assistance  of one another in accomplishing the purposes of God. Sometimes the  officers who are particularly charged with the foreign ministry help at  home; the home ministry sometimes help in the foreign ministry; but all  work harmoniously together.    Rising above both these great divisions of the Priesthood, the home  ministry and the foreign ministry, stands, as the keystone in the arch,  the Presidency of the Church, having control over both departments,  and directing the work of God in all the world. No branch of the  Church, however remote, is beyond their oversight. No Elder, let him be  travelling where he will, is outside the pale of their authority. Talk  of catholicity being one of the marks of the true Church of Christ, as  our Catholic friends sometimes do, they shall find here in the Church  of Christ a catholicity equal at least to their own claims. The Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the church universal; and the  President of the Church holds universal jurisdiction. Moreover, as  Prophet, Seer and Revelator of the Church he is the source through  which God speaks, not only to this people, not only to the Church of  Christ, but to all the inhabitants of the earth, and God will hold them  accountable for the use they make of the words he shall speak through  his appointed mouthpiece. Do not think that this man's authority is  limited to this Church alone. All the inhabitants of the earth are  children of God, and he will deliver his word unto them through his  prophet. I rather like the idea that all the inhabitants of the earth  belong to us--they are God's children, though some of them are in  rebellion and will not heed the commandments of their Father just  now. But here in the Church of Christ is the center of ecclesiastical  government. Here shine forth those rays of light that will grow  brighter and brighter until all the inhabitants of the earth are  enlightened by them.    Now, what do you think of this effort of philosophy, as set forth by  Mr. Riley, to account for Mormonism? How insipid, how foolish, how  inadequate are the theories of men to account for the organization of  this Church! The Church is its own witness! As the stars, \"singing  ever as they shine, proclaim the hand that made them is divine,\"  so, too, this work,--the restored latter-day gospel--the Church of  Christ--proclaims that it has a divine origin, and that there is in it  a divine power working out the purposes of God. Then let the imitators  go on. Let them choose \"apostles,\" if they want to--and some of them  have them; let them have \"seventies,\" if they want to, and some of them  have them; let them accept this doctrine and that doctrine until they  shall have the complete organization and the complete doctrine in form,  if they want to; but there is one thing they never can get, worlds  without end, and that is the spirit of this work, which gives it life  and power. This work will always be distinguished from the works of  men, in that there will be imminent in it the Spirit of God working his  sovereign will. And that is something they cannot imitate.    My brethren and sisters, I rejoice in the truth. I rejoice in the  gospel of Jesus Christ. It satisfies me completely. It responds to the  hungering of my spirit. It meets the demands also of my intellectual  nature. And as I see the growth of intelligence among men, an increase  of scientific knowledge, a broader understanding of the universe, a  comprehension of the extent and grandeur of the works of God, I see in  Mormonism that which rises up to meet this enlarged knowledge of men.  Mormonism teaches man that he is a child of God; it tells him that he  has in him divine elements that partake of the nature of God; that  after the resurrection he will live forever; and that he may go on  from one degree of excellence unto another until he shall attain unto  something that is truly great, worthy of a God to give, and worthy of a  son of God to receive.    I rejoice in these truths. They cannot be accounted for by any theory  that refers their origin to hallucinations of an epileptic's mind: They  are too substantial, too grand, too rational, too sublime, too soul  inspiring, to have any such contemptible origin. Their own intrinsic  value--their own self evident truth--the institution to which they are  committed as to a sacred depository for the benefit of mankind--The  Church--all this proclaims their divine origin.    NOTE. At the close of the above remarks, President Joseph F. Smith  arose and said:    \"While I realize, as you all do, doubtless, that it may be wholly  unnecessary for me to say what I am going to say, yet I feel prompted  to say it, and let it go for what it is worth. I have been delighted  with the most excellent discourse that we have listened to; but I  desire to say that it is a wonderful revelation to the Latter-day  Saints, and especially to those who were familiar with the Prophet  Joseph Smith, to learn in these latter days that he was an epileptic! I  will simply remark, God be praised, that there are so many still living  who knew the Prophet Joseph well, and who are in a position to bear  testimony, to the truth that no such condition [as that suggested in  Mr. Riley's hypothesis] ever existed in the man. He was never troubled  with epilepsy. Of course, this may be unnecessary to say, after this  fallacious, foolish, nonsensical theory--this \"fried froth\"--gotten  up by vain philosophers to account for something they would like to  destroy from off the face of the earth, but are impotent to do it.\"    FOREWORD.    \"The Mormon Prophet,\" is by Lily Dougall, author of \"The Mermaid,\" \"The  Zeitgeist,\" \"The Madonna of a Day,\" \"Beggars All,\" etc. The review  of the book which follows was written at the request of the editor  of the \"New York Times Saturday Review,\" and appeared in that paper,  impression of September 23, 1899.    II.    \"THE MORMON PROPHET.\"    It was expected that sooner or later some attempt would be made to  explain Joseph Smith, the \"Mormon Prophet.\" Such was his character,  such the importance of the religion he founded, so remarkable and  thrilling the history of his people, that he could not be ignored.    Already of biographies there have been many, some written from the  side of sympathy and belief in his prophetic calling; more from the  standpoint of the polemic contemner. Even fiction before now has found  incidents in his career and elements in his character that promised  material for its purpose. But the fiction in the main has been \"sorry  stuff,\" utterly contemptible from its distortion of facts and sickening  in its childish efforts to deny the Mormon leader or his people any  honesty of purpose, uprightness of intention, or praise for what they  have achieved. The latest work of Miss Lily Dougall, \"The Mormon  Prophet,\" however, does not belong to that class of fiction. Here,  at least, we have a strong, clear-cut, purpose story, lofty in tone;  its incidents easily within the lines of probability, and singularly  free from the vulgarity of nearly all the writers of fiction who have  made their work at any point touch Mormonism. It is an honest effort  to account for Joseph Smith and his work; and, I may add, without  depreciating any one worthy of consideration, that it enjoys the  distinction of being about the first honest effort in the department of  fiction to account for the Mormon Prophet. This, it must be explained,  is not said in approval of the entire book or its purpose, but is said  of the story as unobjectionable fiction and the honesty of effort upon  the part of the authoress to solve what must have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4776"],[0,"Political Ideals (#9)"],[1,"of a  reasoned defense.  It is the innovators who have difficulty in being  allowed to exist and work.  Each generation believes that this  difficulty is a thing of the past, but each generation is only  tolerant of _past_ innovations.  Those of its own day are met with the  same persecution as though the principle of toleration had never been  heard of.    \"In early society,\" says Westermarck, \"customs are not only moral  rules, but the only moral rules ever thought of.  The savage strictly  complies with the Hegelian command that no man must have a private  conscience.  The following statement, which refers to the Tinnevelly  Shanars, may be quoted as a typical example: 'Solitary individuals  amongst them rarely adopt any new opinions, or any new course of  procedure.  They follow the multitude to do evil, and they follow the  multitude to do good.  They think in herds.'\"[3]    [3] \"The Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas,\" 2d edition,  Vol. I, p. 119.    Those among ourselves who have never thought a thought or done a deed  in the slightest degree different from the thoughts and deeds of our  neighbors will congratulate themselves on the difference between us  and the savage.  But those who have ever attempted any real innovation  cannot help feeling that the people they know are not so very unlike  the Tinnevelly Shanars.    Under the influence of socialism, even progressive opinion, in recent  years, has been hostile to individual liberty.  Liberty is associated,  in the minds of reformers, with _laissez-faire_, the Manchester School,  and the exploitation of women and children which resulted from what  was euphemistically called \"free competition.\" All these things were  evil, and required state interference; in fact, there is need of an  immense increase of state action in regard to cognate evils which  still exist.  In everything that concerns the economic life of the  community, as regards both distribution and conditions of production,  what is required is more public control, not less--how much more, I  do not profess to know.    Another direction in which there is urgent need of the substitution of  law and order for anarchy is international relations.  At present,  each sovereign state has complete individual freedom, subject only to  the sanction of war.  This individual freedom will have to be  curtailed in regard to external relations if wars are ever to cease.    But when we pass outside the sphere of material possessions, we find  that the arguments in favor of public control almost entirely  disappear.    Religion, to begin with, is recognized as a matter in which the state  ought not to interfere.  Whether a man is Christian, Mahometan, or Jew  is a question of no public concern, so long as he obeys the laws; and  the laws ought to be such as men of all religions can obey.  Yet even  here there are limits.  No civilized state would tolerate a religion  demanding human sacrifice.  The English in India put an end to suttee,  in spite of a fixed principle of non-interference with native  religious customs.  Perhaps they were wrong to prevent suttee, yet  almost every European would have done the same.  We cannot _effectively_  doubt that such practices ought to be stopped, however we may theorize  in favor of religious liberty.    In such cases, the interference with liberty is imposed from without  by a higher civilization.  But the more common case, and the more  interesting, is when an independent state interferes on behalf of  custom against individuals who are feeling their way toward more  civilized beliefs and institutions.    \"In New South Wales,\" says Westermarck, \"the first-born of every lubra  used to be eaten by the tribe 'as part of a religious ceremony.' In  the realm of Khai-muh, in China, according to a native account, it was  customary to kill and devour the eldest son alive.  Among certain  tribes in British Columbia the first child is often sacrificed to the  sun.  The Indians of Florida, according to Le Moyne de Morgues,  sacrificed the first-born son to the chief....'\"[4]    [4] _Op cit._, p. 459.    There are pages and pages of such instances.    There is nothing analogous to these practices among ourselves.  When  the first-born in Florida was told that his king and country needed  him, this was a mere mistake, and with us mistakes of this kind do not  occur.  But it is interesting to inquire how these superstitions died  out, in such cases, for example, as that of Khai-muh, where foreign  compulsion is improbable.  We may surmise that some parents, under the  selfish influence of parental affection, were led to doubt whether the  sun would really be angry if the eldest child were allowed to live.  Such rationalism would be regarded as very dangerous, since it was  calculated to damage the harvest.  For generations the opinion would  be cherished in secret by a handful of cranks, who would not be able  to act upon it.  At last, by concealment or flight, a few parents  would save their children from the sacrifice.  Such parents would be  regarded as lacking all public spirit, and as willing to endanger the  community for their private pleasure.  But gradually it would appear  that the state remained intact, and the crops were no worse than in  former years.  Then, by a fiction, a child would be deemed to have  been sacrificed if it was solemnly dedicated to agriculture or some  other work of national importance chosen by the chief.  It would be  many generations before the child would be allowed to choose its own  occupation after it had grown old enough to know its own tastes and  capacities.  And during all those generations, children would be  reminded that only an act of grace had allowed them to live at all,  and would exist under the shadow of a purely imaginary duty to the  state.    The position of those parents who first disbelieved in the utility of  infant sacrifice illustrates all the difficulties which arise in  connection with the adjustment of individual freedom to public  control.  The authorities, believing the sacrifice necessary for the  good of the community, were bound to insist upon it; the parents,  believing it useless, were equally bound to do everything in their  power toward saving the child.  How ought both parties to act in such  a case?    The duty of the skeptical parent is plain: to save the child by any  possible means, to preach the uselessness of the sacrifice in season  and out of season, and to endure patiently whatever penalty the law  may indict for evasion.  But the duty of the authorities is far less  clear.  So long as they remain firmly persuaded that the universal  sacrifice of the first-born is indispensable, they are bound to  persecute those who seek to undermine this belief.  But they will, if  they are conscientious, very carefully examine the arguments of  opponents, and be willing in advance to admit that these arguments  _may_ be sound.  They will carefully search their own hearts to see  whether hatred of children or pleasure in cruelty has anything to do  with their belief.  They will remember that in the past history of  Khai-muh there are innumerable instances of beliefs, now known to be  false, on account of which those who disagreed with the prevalent view  were put to death.  Finally they will reflect that, though errors  which are traditional are often wide-spread, new beliefs seldom win  acceptance unless they are nearer to the truth than what they replace;  and they will conclude that a new belief is probably either an  advance, or so unlikely to become common as to be innocuous.  All  these considerations will make them hesitate before they resort to  punishment.      II    The study of past times and uncivilized races makes it clear beyond  question that the customary beliefs of tribes or nations are almost  invariably false.  It is difficult to divest ourselves completely of  the customary beliefs of our own age and nation, but it is not very  difficult to achieve a certain degree of doubt in regard to them.  The  Inquisitor who burnt men at the stake was acting with true humanity if  all his beliefs were correct; but if they were in error at any point,  he was inflicting a wholly unnecessary cruelty.  A good working maxim  in such matters is this: Do not trust customary beliefs so far as to  perform actions which must be disastrous unless the beliefs in  question are wholly true.  The world would be utterly bad, in the  opinion of the average Englishman, unless he could say \"Britannia  rules the waves\"; in the opinion of the average German, unless he  could say \"Deutschland ueber alles.\" For the sake of these beliefs,  they are willing to destroy European civilization.  If the beliefs  should happen to be false, their action is regrettable.    One fact which emerges from these considerations is that no obstacle  should be placed in the way of thought and its expression, nor yet in  the way of statements of fact.  This was formerly common ground among  liberal thinkers, though it was never quite realized in the practice  of civilized countries.  But it has recently become, throughout  Europe, a dangerous paradox, on account of which men suffer  imprisonment or starvation.  For this reason it has again become worth  stating.  The grounds for it are so evident that I should be ashamed  to repeat them if they were not universally ignored.  But in the  actual world it is very necessary to repeat them.    To attain complete truth is not given to mortals, but to advance  toward it by successive steps is not impossible.  On any matter of  general interest, there is usually, in any given community at any  given time, a received opinion, which is accepted as a matter of  course by all who give no special thought to the matter.  Any  questioning of the received opinion rouses hostility, for a number of  reasons.    The most important of these is the instinct of conventionality, which  exists in all"]]]
