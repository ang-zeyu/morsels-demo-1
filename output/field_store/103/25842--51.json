SIR ISAAC NEWTON wore his black and gold waistcoat,    AND Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought a salad with him in a string  bag.    AND instead of a nice dish of minnows--they had a roasted grasshopper  with lady-bird sauce; which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but _I_  think it must have been nasty!    THE END          THE TALE OF TIMMY TIPTOES    FOR MANY UNKNOWN LITTLE FRIENDS, INCLUDING MONICA      ONCE upon a time there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel,  called Timmy Tiptoes. He had a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a  tall tree; and he had a little squirrel wife called Goody.    TIMMY TIPTOES sat out, enjoying the breeze; he whisked his tail and  chuckled--\"Little wife Goody, the nuts are ripe; we must lay up a store  for winter and spring.\" Goody Tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the  thatch--\"The nest is so snug, we shall be sound asleep all winter.\"  \"Then we shall wake up all the thinner, when there is nothing to eat in  spring-time,\" replied prudent Timothy.    WHEN Timmy and Goody Tiptoes came to the nut thicket, they found other  squirrels were there already.    Timmy took off his jacket and hung it on a twig; they worked away  quietly by themselves.    EVERY day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts. They  carried them away in bags, and stored them in several hollow stumps near  the tree where they had built their nest.    WHEN these stumps were full, they began to empty the bags into a hole  high up a tree, that had belonged to a wood-pecker; the nuts rattled  down--down--down inside.    \"How shall you ever get them out again? It is like a money-box!\" said  Goody.    \"I shall be much thinner before spring-time, my love,\" said Timmy  Tiptoes, peeping into the hole.    THEY did collect quantities--because they did not lose them! Squirrels  who bury their nuts in the ground lose more than half, because they  cannot remember the place.    The most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called Silvertail. He began  to dig, and he could not remember. And then he dug again and found some  nuts that did not belong to him; and there was a fight. And other  squirrels began to dig,--the whole wood was in commotion!    UNFORTUNATELY, just at this time a flock of little birds flew by, from  bush to bush, searching for green caterpillars and spiders. There were  several sorts of little birds, twittering different songs.    The first one sang--\"Who's bin digging-up MY nuts? Who's-been-digging-up  MY nuts?\"    And another sang--\"Little bita bread and-NO-cheese! Little bit-a-bread  an'-NO-cheese!\"    THE squirrels followed and listened. The first little bird flew into the  bush where Timmy and Goody Tiptoes were quietly tying up their bags, and  it sang--\"Who's-bin digging-up MY nuts? Who's been digging-up MY-nuts?\"    Timmy Tiptoes went on with his work without replying; indeed, the little  bird did not expect an answer. It was only singing its natural song, and  it meant nothing at all.    BUT when the other squirrels heard that song, they rushed upon Timmy  Tiptoes and cuffed and scratched him, and upset his bag of nuts. The  innocent little bird which had caused all the mischief, flew away in a  fright!    Timmy rolled over and over, and then turned tail and fled towards his  nest, followed by a crowd of squirrels shouting--\"Who's-been digging-up  MY-nuts?\"    THEY caught him and dragged him up the very same tree, where there was  the little round hole, and they pushed him in. The hole was much too  small for Timmy Tiptoes' figure. They squeezed him dreadfully, it was a  wonder they did not break his ribs. \"We will leave him here till he  confesses,\" said Silvertail Squirrel, and he shouted into the hole--    \"Who's-been-digging-up MY-nuts?\"    TIMMY TIPTOES made no reply; he had tumbled down inside the tree, upon  half a peck of nuts belonging to himself. He lay quite stunned and  still.    GOODY TIPTOES picked up the nut bags and went home. She made a cup of  tea for Timmy; but he didn't come and didn't come.    Goody Tiptoes passed a lonely and unhappy night. Next morning she  ventured back to the nut-bushes to look for him; but the other unkind  squirrels drove her away.    She wandered all over the wood, calling--    \"Timmy Tiptoes! Timmy Tiptoes! Oh, where is Timmy Tiptoes?\"    IN the meantime Timmy Tiptoes came to his senses. He found himself  tucked up in a little moss bed, very much in the dark, feeling sore; it  seemed to be under ground. Timmy coughed and groaned, because his ribs  hurted him. There was a chirpy noise, and a small striped Chipmunk  appeared with a night light, and hoped he felt better?    It was most kind to Timmy Tiptoes; it lent him its nightcap; and the  house was full of provisions.    THE Chipmunk explained that it had rained nuts through the top of the  tree--\"Besides, I found a few buried!\" It laughed and chuckled when it  heard Timmy's story. While Timmy was confined to bed, it 'ticed him to  eat quantities--\"But how shall I ever get out through that hole unless I  thin myself? My wife will be anxious!\" \"Just another nut--or two nuts;  let me crack them for you,\" said the Chipmunk. Timmy Tiptoes grew fatter  and fatter!    NOW Goody Tiptoes had set to work again by herself. She did not put any  more nuts into the woodpecker's hole, because she had always doubted how  they could be got out again. She hid them under a tree root; they  rattled down, down, down. Once when Goody emptied an extra big bagful,  there was a decided squeak; and next time Goody brought another bagful,  a little striped Chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry.    \"IT is getting perfectly full-up down-stairs; the sitting-room is full,  and they are rolling along the passage; and my husband, Chippy Hackee,  has run away and left me. What is the explanation of these showers of  nuts?\"    \"I am sure I beg your pardon; I did not not know that anybody lived  here,\" said Mrs. Goody Tiptoes; \"but where is Chippy Hackee? My husband,  Timmy Tiptoes, has run away too.\" \"I know where Chippy is; a little bird  told me,\" said Mrs. Chippy Hackee.    SHE led the way to the woodpecker's tree, and they listened at the hole.    Down below there was a noise of nut crackers, and a fat squirrel voice  and a thin squirrel voice were singing together--        \"My little old man and I fell out,      How shall we bring this matter about?      Bring it about as well as you can,      And get you gone, you little old man!\"    \"You could squeeze in, through that little round hole,\" said Goody  Tiptoes. \"Yes, I could,\" said the Chipmunk, \"but my husband, Chippy  Hackee, bites!\"    Down below there was a noise of cracking nuts and nibbling; and then the  fat squirrel voice and the thin squirrel voice sang--        \"For the diddlum day      Day diddle dum di!      Day diddle diddle dum day!\"    THEN Goody peeped in at the hole, and called down--\"Timmy Tiptoes! Oh  fie, Timmy Tiptoes!\" And Timmy replied, \"Is that you, Goody Tiptoes?  Why, certainly!\"    He came up and kissed Goody through the hole; but he was so fat that he  could not get out.    Chippy Hackee was not too fat, but he did not want to come; he stayed  down below and chuckled.    AND so it went on for a fortnight; till a big wind blew off the top of  the tree, and opened up the hole and let in the rain.    Then Timmy Tiptoes came out, and went home with an umbrella.    BUT Chippy Hackee continued to camp out for another week, although it  was uncomfortable.    AT last a large bear came walking through the wood. Perhaps he also was  looking for nuts; he seemed to be sniffing around.    CHIPPY HACKEE went home in a hurry!    AND when Chippy Hackee got home, he found he had caught a cold in his  head; and he was more uncomfortable still.    And now Timmy and Goody Tiptoes keep their nut-store fastened up with a  little padlock.    AND whenever that little bird sees the Chipmunks, he  sings--\"Who's-been-digging-up MY-nuts? Who's been digging-up MY-nuts?\"  But nobody ever answers!    THE END        THE PIE AND THE PATTY-PAN        Pussy-cat sits by the fire--how should she be fair?      In walks the little dog--says \"Pussy are you there?      How do you do mistress Pussy? Mistress Pussy, how do you do?\"      \"I thank you kindly, little dog, I fare as well as you!\"                                         Old Rhyme.      ONCE upon a time there was a Pussy-cat called Ribby, who invited a  little dog called Duchess to tea.    \"Come in good time, my dear Duchess,\" said Ribby's letter, \"and we will  have something so very nice. I am baking it in a pie-dish--a pie-dish  with a pink rim. You never tasted anything so good! And YOU shall eat it  all! _I_ will eat muffins, my dear Duchess!\" wrote Ribby.    Duchess read the letter and wrote an answer:--\"I will come with much  pleasure at a quarter past four. But it is very strange. _I_ was just  going to invite you to come here, to supper, my dear Ribby, to eat  something MOST DELICIOUS.\"    \"I will come very punctually, my dear Ribby,\" wrote Duchess; and then at  the end she added--\"I hope it isn't mouse?\"    And then she thought that did not look quite polite; so she scratched  out \"isn't mouse\" and changed it to \"I hope it will be fine,\" and she  gave her letter to the postman.    But she thought a great deal about Ribby's pie, and she read Ribby's  letter over and over again.    \"I am dreadfully afraid it WILL be mouse!\" said Duchess to herself--\"I  really couldn't, COULDN'T eat mouse pie. And I shall have to eat it,  because it is a party. And MY pie was going to be veal and ham. A pink  and white pie-dish! and so is mine; just like Ribby's dishes; they were  both bought at Tabitha Twitchit's.\"    Duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at  it.    \"It is all ready to put into the oven. Such lovely pie-crust; and I put  in a little tin patty-pan to hold up the crust; and I made a hole in the  middle with a fork to let"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5827"],[0,"The Problems of Philosophy (#9)"],[1,"tes),  or of here and there, or of what others have told us. Thus it would seem  that, in some way or other, a description known to be applicable to a  particular must involve some reference to a particular with which we  are acquainted, if our knowledge about the thing described is not to be  merely what follows _logically_ from the description. For example, 'the  most long-lived of men' is a description involving only universals,  which must apply to some man, but we can make no judgements concerning  this man which involve knowledge about him beyond what the description  gives. If, however, we say, 'The first Chancellor of the German Empire  was an astute diplomatist', we can only be assured of the truth of our  judgement in virtue of something with which we are acquainted--usually a  testimony heard or read. Apart from the information we convey to others,  apart from the fact about the actual Bismarck, which gives importance  to our judgement, the thought we really have contains the one or more  particulars involved, and otherwise consists wholly of concepts.    All names of places--London, England, Europe, the Earth, the Solar  System--similarly involve, when used, descriptions which start from some  one or more particulars with which we are acquainted. I suspect that  even the Universe, as considered by metaphysics, involves such a  connexion with particulars. In logic, on the contrary, where we are  concerned not merely with what does exist, but with whatever might or  could exist or be, no reference to actual particulars is involved.    It would seem that, when we make a statement about something only known  by description, we often _intend_ to make our statement, not in the form  involving the description, but about the actual thing described. That  is to say, when we say anything about Bismarck, we should like, if we  could, to make the judgement which Bismarck alone can make, namely,  the judgement of which he himself is a constituent. In this we are  necessarily defeated, since the actual Bismarck is unknown to us. But  we know that there is an object B, called Bismarck, and that B was an  astute diplomatist. We can thus _describe_ the proposition we should  like to affirm, namely, 'B was an astute diplomatist', where B is the  object which was Bismarck. If we are describing Bismarck as 'the first  Chancellor of the German Empire', the proposition we should like to  affirm may be described as 'the proposition asserting, concerning the  actual object which was the first Chancellor of the German Empire, that  this object was an astute diplomatist'. What enables us to communicate  in spite of the varying descriptions we employ is that we know there is  a true proposition concerning the actual Bismarck, and that however we  may vary the description (so long as the description is correct) the  proposition described is still the same. This proposition, which is  described and is known to be true, is what interests us; but we are not  acquainted with the proposition itself, and do not know it, though we  know it is true.    It will be seen that there are various stages in the removal from  acquaintance with particulars: there is Bismarck to people who knew him;  Bismarck to those who only know of him through history; the man with  the iron mask; the longest-lived of men. These are progressively further  removed from acquaintance with particulars; the first comes as near to  acquaintance as is possible in regard to another person; in the second,  we shall still be said to know 'who Bismarck was'; in the third, we do  not know who was the man with the iron mask, though we can know many  propositions about him which are not logically deducible from the fact  that he wore an iron mask; in the fourth, finally, we know nothing  beyond what is logically deducible from the definition of the man. There  is a similar hierarchy in the region of universals. Many universals,  like many particulars, are only known to us by description. But here,  as in the case of particulars, knowledge concerning what is known by  description is ultimately reducible to knowledge concerning what is  known by acquaintance.    The fundamental principle in the analysis of propositions containing  descriptions is this: _Every proposition which we can understand must be  composed wholly of constituents with which we are acquainted_.    We shall not at this stage attempt to answer all the objections which  may be urged against this fundamental principle. For the present, we  shall merely point out that, in some way or other, it must be possible  to meet these objections, for it is scarcely conceivable that we can  make a judgement or entertain a supposition without knowing what it is  that we are judging or supposing about. We must attach _some_ meaning  to the words we use, if we are to speak significantly and not utter mere  noise; and the meaning we attach to our words must be something with  which we are acquainted. Thus when, for example, we make a statement  about Julius Caesar, it is plain that Julius Caesar himself is not  before our minds, since we are not acquainted with him. We have in mind  some description of Julius Caesar: 'the man who was assassinated on the  Ides of March', 'the founder of the Roman Empire', or, perhaps, merely  'the man whose name was _Julius Caesar_'. (In this last description,  _Julius Caesar_ is a noise or shape with which we are acquainted.)  Thus our statement does not mean quite what it seems to mean, but means  something involving, instead of Julius Caesar, some description of him  which is composed wholly of particulars and universals with which we are  acquainted.    The chief importance of knowledge by description is that it enables us  to pass beyond the limits of our private experience. In spite of the  fact that we can only know truths which are wholly composed of terms  which we have experienced in acquaintance, we can yet have knowledge by  description of things which we have never experienced. In view of the  very narrow range of our immediate experience, this result is vital, and  until it is understood, much of our knowledge must remain mysterious and  therefore doubtful.        CHAPTER VI. ON INDUCTION    In almost all our previous discussions we have been concerned in  the attempt to get clear as to our data in the way of knowledge of  existence. What things are there in the universe whose existence is  known to us owing to our being acquainted with them? So far, our answer  has been that we are acquainted with our sense-data, and, probably,  with ourselves. These we know to exist. And past sense-data which  are remembered are known to have existed in the past. This knowledge  supplies our data.    But if we are to be able to draw inferences from these data--if we are  to know of the existence of matter, of other people, of the past before  our individual memory begins, or of the future, we must know general  principles of some kind by means of which such inferences can be drawn.  It must be known to us that the existence of some one sort of thing, A,  is a sign of the existence of some other sort of thing, B, either at  the same time as A or at some earlier or later time, as, for example,  thunder is a sign of the earlier existence of lightning. If this were  not known to us, we could never extend our knowledge beyond the  sphere of our private experience; and this sphere, as we have seen, is  exceedingly limited. The question we have now to consider is whether  such an extension is possible, and if so, how it is effected.    Let us take as an illustration a matter about which none of us, in fact,  feel the slightest doubt. We are all convinced that the sun will rise  to-morrow. Why? Is this belief a mere blind outcome of past experience,  or can it be justified as a reasonable belief? It is not easy to find  a test by which to judge whether a belief of this kind is reasonable or  not, but we can at least ascertain what sort of general beliefs would  suffice, if true, to justify the judgement that the sun will rise  to-morrow, and the many other similar judgements upon which our actions  are based.    It is obvious that if we are asked why we believe that the sun will rise  to-morrow, we shall naturally answer 'Because it always has risen every  day'. We have a firm belief that it will rise in the future, because it  has risen in the past. If we are challenged as to why we believe that  it will continue to rise as heretofore, we may appeal to the laws of  motion: the earth, we shall say, is a freely rotating body, and such  bodies do not cease to rotate unless something interferes from outside,  and there is nothing outside to interfere with the earth between now and  to-morrow. Of course it might be doubted whether we are quite certain  that there is nothing outside to interfere, but this is not the  interesting doubt. The interesting doubt is as to whether the laws  of motion will remain in operation until to-morrow. If this doubt is  raised, we find ourselves in the same position as when the doubt about  the sunrise was first raised.    The _only_ reason for believing that the laws of motion will remain in  operation is that they have operated hitherto, so far as our knowledge  of the past enables us to judge. It is true that we have a greater body  of evidence from the past in favour of the laws of motion than we have  in favour of the sunrise, because the sunrise is merely a particular  case of fulfilment of the laws of motion, and there are countless other  particular cases. But the real question is: Do _any_ number of cases  of a law being fulfilled in the past afford evidence that it will be  fulfilled in the future? If not, it becomes plain that we have no ground  whatever for expecting the sun to rise to-morrow, or for expecting the  bread we shall eat at our next meal not to poison us, or for any of the  other scarcely conscious expectations that control our daily lives.
