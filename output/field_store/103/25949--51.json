Words, in fact,  equivalent to saying I had come into a land of robbers, and therefore  must submit to being robbed; and this I plainly told him. Further, I  even threatened the sultan with a pretended determination to return to  Aden, where I said the matter would be settled at our police court  without bias or favour. I then desired the interpreter to look out for  any vessel that would give me a passage to Aden, as it was obvious to  me Sumunter had more power in the land than the sultan. This took them  all by surprise, abashed the old sultan and his family--for they were  proud of their strength--and induced them to say I need not fear  anything on that score;--was the sultan of the Warsingali, indeed, not  the greatest chief in the land, and, moreover, a great ally of the  English? This, of course, was only a feint on my part to bring them to  a proper sense of their duty towards me; for I had brought letters of  recommendation from the Government at Aden to their chief, and knew  they would rather do anything than let me go back in a huff.    29th.--I had been now nine days waiting here, and had taken many walks  about the hill-sides, investigating the place, and making sundry  collections. The most interesting amongst these was a small lizard, a  new species, afterwards named by Mr E. Blyth, the Curator of the  Asiatic Society, _Tiloqua Burtoni_, after my commandant. The Somali  brought a leopard into camp, which they said they had destroyed in a  cave by beating it to death with sticks and stones. They have a mortal  antipathy to these animals, as they sometimes kill defenceless men,  and are very destructive to their flocks. Besides the little antelope  described, I only saw the Saltiana antelope, and the tracks of two  other species which were said to be very scarce. Rhinoceroses were  formerly very abundant here, but have been nearly all killed down with  spear and bow (they do not use firearms) by the Somali hunters, in  consequence of the great demand for their skins for making shields.  Amongst the bush and trees there were several gum-producing ones, of  which the frankincense, I think, ranked first. These gums are usually  plucked by the women and transported to Aden. The barks of various  other trees are also very useful; for instance, they strip down the  bark of the acacia in long slips, and chew it until only fibres  remain, which, when twisted in the hand, make strong cordage. The  acacia bark also makes a good tan for preserving leather; but of far  greater account than this is the bark of a squat stunted tree, like  the \"elephant's foot,\" called by the Somali mohur, which has a smooth  skin, with knotty-looking warts upon it like a huge turnip, reddish  inside, with a yellowish-green exterior. It has a highly aromatic  flavour, and is a powerful astringent. When making mussacks, the  Somali pull a sheep or goat out of his skin; tie its legs and tail,  where incisions had been made, to make it a waterproof bag, and then  fill it with bits of this bark, chopped up and mixed with water. They  then suspend it in a tree to dry, and afterwards render it soft and  pliable by a severe course of manipulation. The taste of the bark is  considered very wholesome, and a corrective to bad and fetid water.  Besides possessing this quality, the mohur is useful as a  poultice-when mashed and mixed with water; and the Somali always have  recourse to it when badly wounded.    During my peregrinations at this place, I often dropped bits of paper  about the jungle, little suspecting what would become of them; and, to  my surprise, one day the interpreter came to me in some alarm, to say  that several Dulbahantas had arrived at Bunder Gori, and were sharply  canvassing amongst themselves the probable objects of my visit. I  could not be travelling without a purpose, at so much expense; and  they thought these bits of paper, which they had carefully picked up,  conclusive evidence I was marking out some spots for future purposes.  They abused the Warsingali for being such fools as to let me travel in  their country, and said I should never cross over to them. This little  incident of dropping paper, though fully explained to them, was ever  afterwards brought up in accusation against me, and proved very  perplexing.    30th.--Camp Habal Ishawalé. Altitude 5052 feet.--We were now all  together, and I thought ready to march; but the men had first to be  paid their hire in advance--a monthly stipend of five tobes each. When  that was settled, many other men, and amongst them the sultan's second  brother Hassan, coveting my clothes, wished to be engaged. Some  tedious hours were wasted on this subject. The sultan, at the  instigation of these advocates for service, would have it, if I wished  to travel according to the custom of the country, I must take more men  with me as a guard. I, on the other hand, neither wanted them nor  could afford to pay them, as I had been so extensively plundered--but  wished to exchange Sumunter for his brother, and promised high rewards  if he would take me through the journey. To put an end to the  discussion, I struck my tent, never to be pitched again, and waited  patiently until the camels came. It was not until near sundown that  the camels were ready and the march commenced. The sultan then ordered  Hassan and the naughty boy Abdullah, against my wish, to accompany me  on the journey; and we set off, leaving two or three loads behind to  be brought up on the morrow. The march was a short one, made to  relieve the one beyond; for the spring of water we were now drinking  from was the last on this side the range. It led us up a gradual but  tortuous ascent, very thickly clad with strong bushes, to a kraal or  ring-fence of prickly acacias, which was evidently made to protect the  Somali's sheep from lions, leopards, hyenas, and freebooters suddenly  pouncing on them.    We remained here three days, sending the things I had brought in  relays across the mountain, and fetching up the rear ones. The sultan  could not lose the opportunity afforded by my detention to come again  and beg for presents, and I gave him a razor to shave his head with  and make a clean Mussulman of him. On finding he could get nothing  further from me gratis, he demanded that a cloth should be paid to the  man whom my camel-drivers had robbed of the goat at Adhai, and, before  retiring, wished me urgently to take a letter for him to Aden,  petitioning the English to allow him to form an expedition by sea, and  take retribution on the Musa Abokr at Héis, who had recently killed  one of his subjects.

It was a double march, and a very stiff one for the  camels. Directly in our front lay an easy, flattish ground, with  moderate undulations, densely wooded with such trees as I had already  seen; but beyond it, about three miles from camp, the face of the  mountain-top, towering to a great height, stood frowning over us like  a huge bluff wall, which at first sight it appeared quite impossible  any camel could surmount. At 9 A.M. we reached this steep, and  commenced the stiffest and last ascent up a winding, narrow goat-path,  having sharp turns at the extremity of every zigzag, and with huge  projecting stones, which seemed to bid defiance to the passage of the  camels' bodies. Indeed, it was very marvellous, with their long  spindle-shanks and great splay feet, and the awkward boxes on their  backs striking constantly against every little projection in the hill,  that they did not tumble headlong over the pathway; for many times, at  the corners, they fell upon their chests, with their hind-legs  dangling over the side, and were only pulled into the path again by  the combined exertions of all the men. Like Tibet ponies, when they  felt their bodies slipping helplessly over the precipices--down which,  had they fallen, they would have met instantaneous and certain  death--they invariably seized hold of anything and everything with  their teeth to save their equilibrium. The ascent was at length  completed after an infinity of trouble, and our view from the top of  the mountain repaid me fully for everything of the past. It was a  glorious place! In one glance round I had a complete survey of all the  country I was now destined to travel over, and what I had already gone  over.    The pass was called Yafir, and, by the boiling thermometer, showed an  altitude of 6704 feet. It was almost the highest point on this range.  From a cedar tree I cooked my breakfast under, on facing to the north  I saw at once the vast waters of the Gulf, all smooth and glassy as a  mill-pond, the village of Bunder Gori, and the two buggaloes lying in  its anchorage-ground, like little dots of nut-shells, immediately  below the steep face of the mountain. So deep and perpendicular was  it, that it had almost the effect of looking down a vast precipice.  But how different was the view on turning to the south! Instead of  this enormous grandeur--a deep rugged hill, green and fresh in  verdure, with the sea like a large lake below--it was tame in the  extreme; the land dropped gently to scarcely more than half its depth,  with barely a tree visible on its surface; and at the foot of the  hill, stretched out"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8419"],[0,"The Journals of Lewis and Clark, 1804-1806 (#9)"],[1,"the point of one from the active exertions of  the men, prevented her turning, if She had turned She must have  overset. we met a Causseu from the Pania on the River Platt, we  detained 2 hours with a view of engageing one of the hands to go to the  Pania nation with a View to get those people to meet us on the river.
