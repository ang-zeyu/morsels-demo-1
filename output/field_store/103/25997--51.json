COAL, STOVES AND THEIR OPERATION    65. GENERAL CONSTRUCTION.--In Fig. 3 is illustrated the general  construction of the type of coal stove used for cooking. The principal  parts of such a stove, which is commonly referred to as a _cook stove_,  or range, are the firebox _a_; the grate _b_; the ash pit _c_, which  usually contains an ash-pan _d_; the oven _e_; the dampers _f_, _g_,  _h_, and _i_; the flue opening _j_ and flue _k_; openings in the top and  suitable lids, not shown, for kettles and pans; and the air space  extending from the firebox around three sides of the oven, as shown by  the arrows. To prevent the stove from wearing out rapidly, the firebox,  in which the fuel is burned, is lined with a material, such as fireclay,  that will withstand great heat. The fire in the firebox is supported by  the grate, which is in the form of metal teeth or bars, so as to permit  air to pass through the fuel from underneath. The grate is usually so  constructed that when the fire is raked it permits burnt coal or ashes  to fall into the ash-pan, by means of which they can be readily removed  from the stove. The oven, which lies directly back of the firebox and is  really an enclosed chamber in which food may be cooked, receives its  heat from the hot air that passes around it. The dampers are devices  that control the flow of air in and out of the stove. Those shown at _f_  and _g_ serve to admit fresh air into the stove or to keep it out, and  those shown at _h_ and _i_ serve to keep heated air in the stove or to  permit it to pass out through the flue.    [Illustration: Fig. 3]    66. Building a Coal Fire.--To build a coal fire is a simple matter. So  that the draft will be right for rapid combustion, it is first necessary  to close the dampers _f_ and _h _and to open the bottom damper _g_ and  the chimney damper _i_. With these dampers arranged, place crushed paper  or shavings on the grate; then on top of the paper or shavings place  kindling, and on top of the kindling put a small quantity of coal. Be  careful to place the fuel on the grate loosely enough to permit currents  of air to pass through it, because it will not burn readily if it is  closely packed. Light the fire by inserting a flame from below. When  this is done, the flame will rise and ignite the kindling, and this, in  turn, will cause the coal to take fire. When the fire is burning well,  close the dampers _g_ and _i_ so that the fuel will not burn too rapidly  and the heat will surround the oven instead of passing up the chimney;  also, before too much of the first supply of coal is burned out, add a  new supply, but be sure that the coal is sufficiently ignited before the  new supply is added so as not to smother the fire. If only a thin layer  is added each time, this danger will be removed. Experience has proved  that the best results are secured if the fire is built only 4 inches  high. When hot coals come near the top of the stove, the lids are  likely to warp and crack from the heat and the cooking will not be done  any more effectively. Another thing to avoid in connection with a fire  is the accumulation of ashes. The ash-pan should be kept as nearly empty  as possible, for a full ash-pan will check the draft and cause the grate  in the firebox to burn out.    67. ADJUSTING THE DAMPERS.--To get the best results from a cook stove,  and at the same time overcome the wasting of fuel, the ways in which to  adjust the dampers should be fully known. If it is desired to heat the  oven for baking, close dampers _f_ and _i_ and open dampers _g_ and _h_.  With the dampers so arranged, the heated air above the fire is forced  around the oven and up the flue, as is clearly shown by the arrows in  Fig. 3. A study of this diagram will readily show that the lower  left-hand corner of the oven is its coolest part, since the heated air  does not reach this place directly, and that the top center is the  hottest part, because the hottest air passes directly over this portion  of the oven and the heated air in the oven rises to it.    [Illustration: Fig. 4]    If it is desired to heat the surface of the stove, so that cooking may  be done on top of it, close dampers _f_, _h_, and _i_ and open damper  _g_. With the dampers so arranged, the heated air does not pass around  the oven, but is confined in the space above it and the firebox, as  shown in Fig. 4. While the damper _i_ in the flue is closed in order to  confine the heated air as much as possible to the space under the top of  the stove, it contains openings that allow just enough air to pass up  the flue to maintain the draft necessary for combustion. When the  dampers are arranged as mentioned, the hottest place on the surface of  the stove is between the firebox and the stovepipe, and the coolest  place is behind the damper _h_.    68. BANKING A COAL FIRE.--To economize in the use of fuel, as well as to  save the labor involved in building a new fire, it is advisable to keep  a fire burning low from one meal to another and from one day to the  next. As the nature of hard coal is such that it will hold fire for a  long time, this can be done by what is called _banking_ the fire. To  achieve this, after the fire has served to cook a meal, shake the ashes  out of the grate so that the glowing coals are left. Then put fresh coal  on this bed of coals, and, with the dampers arranged as for building a  new fire, allow the coal to burn well for a short time. Finally, cover  the fire with a layer of fine coal and adjust the dampers properly; that  is, close dampers _g_ and _h_ and open dampers _f_ and _i_. If the  banking is carefully done the fire should last 8 or 10 hours without  further attention. Care should be taken, however, to use sufficient coal  in banking the fire, so that when it is to be used again the coal will  not be completely burned, but enough burning coals will remain to ignite  a fresh supply. When the fire is to be used again, rake it slightly, put  a thin layer of coal over the top, and arrange the dampers as for  starting a fire. As soon as this layer of coal has begun to burn, add  more until the fire is in good condition.      GAS STOVES AND THEIR OPERATION    69. GAS RANGES.--A gas stove for cooking, or _gas range_, as it is  frequently called, consists of an oven, a broiler, and several burners  over which are plates to hold pans, pots, and kettles in which food is  to be cooked. As is true of a coal range, a gas range also requires a  flue to carry off the products of unburned gas. Gas stoves, or ranges,  are of many makes, but in principle all of them are practically the  same; in fact, the chief difference lies in the location or arrangement  of the oven, broiler, and burners. In Fig. 5 is illustrated a simple  type of gas range. The oven _a_ of this stove is located above the top  of the stove, instead of below it, as in some stoves. An oven so located  is of advantage in that it saves stooping or bending over. The door of  this oven contains a glass, which makes it possible to observe the food  baking inside without opening the door and thereby losing heat. The  broiler _b_, which may also be used as a toaster, is located directly  beneath the oven, and to the right are the burners _c_ for cooking. The  gas for these parts is contained in the pipe _d_, which is connected to  a pipe joined to the gas main in the street. To get heat for cooking it  is simply necessary to turn on the stop-cocks and light the gas. The  four burners are controlled by the stop-cocks _e_, and the oven and the  broiler by the stop-cock _f_. The stove is also equipped with a  simmering burner for the slow methods of cooking on top of the stove,  gas to this burner being controlled by the stop-cock _g_. To catch  anything that may be spilled in cooking, there is a removable metal or  enamel sheet _h_. Such a sheet is a great advantage, as it aids  considerably in keeping the stove clean.    [Illustration: Fig. 5]    70. Some gas stoves are provided with a _pilot_, which is a tiny flame  of gas that is controlled by a button on the gas pipe to which the  stop-cocks are attached. The pilot is kept lighted, and when it is  desired to light a burner, pressing the button causes the flame to shoot  near enough to each burner to ignite the gas. However, whether the  burners are lighted in this way or by applying a lighted match, they  should never be lighted until heat is required; likewise, in order to  save gas, they should be turned off as soon as the cooking is completed.    [Illustration: Fig. 6]    To produce the best results, the flame given off by gas should be blue.  A flame that is yellow and a burner that makes a noise when lighted,  indicate that the gas flame has caught in the pipe, and to remedy this  the gas must be turned out and relighted. When the gas flame coming from  a new burner is yellow, it may be taken for granted that not enough air  is being admitted to make the proper mixture. To permit of the proper  mixture, each gas pipe extending from the stop-cock and terminating in  the burner is provided with what is called a _mixer_. This device, as  shown in Fig. 6, consists of several slots that may be opened or closed  by turning part _a_, thus making it a simple matter to admit the right  amount of air to produce the desired blue flame. If burners that have  been in use for some time give off a yellow flame, it is probable that  the trouble is caused by a deposit of soot or burned material. Such  burners should be removed, boiled in a solution of washing soda or lye  until the holes in the top are thoroughly cleaned, and then replaced and  adjusted. As long as the flame remains yellow, the gas is not giving off  as much heat as it should produce and is liable to smoke cooking  utensils black. Therefore, to get"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9938"],[0,"Woman's Institute Library of Cookery. Volume 4: Salads and Sandwiches; Cold and (#9)"],[1," remove a sufficient portion  of the tomato to accommodate the end of an egg. Place each tomato with  this part uppermost on a salad plate garnished with lettuce. Cut the  hard-cooked eggs into halves, crosswise, remove the yolk and mash and  season it with salt, pepper, and a little vinegar. Replace the yolk in  the white and force this into the depression in the tomato. Place a  stuffed olive in the egg yolk and serve with French or other desired  salad dressing.    91. WATER-LILY SALAD.--A means of using eggs in salad without the  addition of other foods is found in water-lily salad, which is  illustrated in Fig. 17. If eggs are to be served for a luncheon or some  other light meal, this method may add a little variety to the usual ways  of serving them.    [Illustration: Fig. 17]    Hard-cook one egg for each person to be served, remove the shells, and  cut the eggs into halves, lengthwise. Remove the yolks, mash them, and  season with salt, pepper, and vinegar. Cut the halves of egg whites into  three or four pointed pieces, cutting from end to end of the half. Place  these in a star shape on salad plates garnished with lettuce. Form the  seasoned egg yolk into a ball and place it in the center over the ends  of the egg whites. Serve with any desired salad dressing.    92. EASTER SALAD.--Cream cheese makes an attractive salad when formed  into egg-shaped balls and served in a nest of shredded lettuce. To  prepare this salad, which is known as Easter salad, shred lettuce finely  and place it in the shape of a nest on salad plates. Make tiny  egg-shaped balls of cream cheese moistened with sufficient cream to  handle. Place three or four of these in the inside of the lettuce. Dust  with paprika and serve with any desired dressing.    93. SALMON SALAD.--Persons who are fond of salmon will find salmon salad  a very agreeable dish. In addition to affording a means of varying the  diet, this salad makes a comparatively cheap high-protein dish that is  suitable for either supper or luncheon.    SALMON SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    2 c. salmon  1 c. diced celery  1/4 c. diced Spanish onion  3 or 4 sweet pickles, chopped fine  French dressing  Salad dressing  Lettuce    Look the salmon over carefully, removing any skin and bones. Break into  medium-sized pieces and mix carefully with the celery, onion, and  chopped pickles. Marinate this with the French dressing, taking care not  to break up the salmon. Drain and serve with any desired salad dressing  on salad plates garnished with lettuce.      94. TUNA-FISH SALAD.--A salad that is both attractive and appetizing can  be made by using tuna fish as a foundation. This fish, which is  grayish-white in color, can be obtained in cans like salmon. As it is  not high in price, it gives the housewife another opportunity to provide  her family with an inexpensive protein dish.    TUNA-FISH SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 c. tuna fish  1/2 c. diced celery  1 c. diced cucumber  Salt and pepper  Vinegar  Lettuce  Mayonnaise    Open a can of tuna fish, measure 1 cupful, and place in a bowl. Dice the  celery and cucumber, mix with the fish, and sprinkle with salt and  pepper. Dilute some vinegar with water, using half as much water as  vinegar, and sprinkle enough of this over the mixture to flavor it  slightly. Allow the mixture to stand for about 1/2 hour in a  refrigerator or some other cold place and just before serving pour off  this liquid. Heap the salad on lettuce leaves, pour a spoonful of  mayonnaise over each portion, and serve.      95. LOBSTER OR CRAB SALAD.--Lobster salad and crab salad are made in  practically the same way, so that a recipe for one may be used for the  other. The meat may be either fresh or canned, but, of course, fresh  lobster or crab meat is more desirable if it can be obtained.    LOBSTER OR CRAB SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    2 c. lobster or crab meat  1 c. diced celery  French dressing  Lettuce  Mayonnaise  1 hard-cooked egg    Chill lobster or crab meat and add the diced celery. Marinate with  French dressing, and allow this mixture to stand for 1/2 hour or so  before serving. Keep as cold as possible. Drain off the French dressing  and heap the salad mixture on garnished salad plates or in a salad bowl  garnished with lettuce. Pour mayonnaise dressing over the top, garnish  with slices of hard-cooked egg, and serve.      [Illustration: Fig. 18]    96. SHRIMP SALAD.--Shrimps may be used in an attractive salad in the  manner shown in Fig. 18. Persons who care for sea food find this a most  appetizing dish. Like lobster and crab, shrimp may be purchased in cans,  and so it is possible to have this salad at any season.    First marinate the shrimps with French dressing and then heap them on a  plate garnished with lettuce leaves. Add thin slices of hard-cooked egg  whites, and place a tender heart of celery in the center of the plate.  If desired, some thin slices of celery may be marinated with the shrimp.  Serve with mayonnaise dressing.      97. CHICKEN SALAD.--A favored means of using left-over chicken is to  make chicken salad of it. It is well, however, if the chicken can be  prepared especially for the salad and the nicer pieces of meat used.  This is usually done when chicken salad is to be served at a party or  special dinner. If the chicken is scarce, veal or pork may be  substituted for one-third or one-fourth of the meat.    CHICKEN SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    2 c. chicken  1 c. diced celery  1 green pepper  French dressing  Lettuce  Mayonnaise  1 pimiento    Cut the meat from the bones of a chicken and dice it. Dice the celery,  clean the green pepper, and cut it into small pieces. Mix the pepper and  the celery with the chicken. Marinate with French dressing, chill, and  allow to stand for about 1/2 hour. Drain the dressing from the salad  mixture, serve in a garnished salad bowl or on garnished salad plates,  pour mayonnaise over the top, and garnish with strips of pimiento.    [Illustration: FIG. 19]    98. STUFFED CELERY.--An appetizing relish may be prepared by stuffing  celery in the manner shown in Fig. 19. Stuffed celery is not exactly a  salad, but it may be used to take the place of a salad in a meal. It is  often served with soup as an appetizer, but since it is high in food  value it deserves a place of greater prominence in the meal. Any  desirable cheese may be used to make the stuffing. Roquefort cheese is  probably the most popular one, but many persons do not care for it.  Cream cheese, ordinary American cheese, or even cottage cheese finely  mashed may be used for this purpose.    Put into a bowl the quantity of cheese needed to fill the number of  stalks of celery desired, mash it finely with a fork, and mix it with  cream or salad dressing until it is of a thick, creamy consistency.  Season highly with a dash of red pepper and salt and, if desired, mix  with very finely chopped nuts. Fill the hollows of the stems of celery  with the mixture, sprinkle with paprika, and serve on a plate garnished  with lettuce.           *       *       *       *       *      SANDWICHES    NATURE OF SANDWICHES    99. When salads are mentioned, Sandwiches naturally come to the mind,  for while they have many other uses, they are often served as an  accompaniment to a salad. Sandwiches are generally thought of as two  thin slices of bread put together with a filling, such as meat, cheese,  fruit, etc. However, there are as many varieties of sandwiches as of  salads and they serve a large number of purposes. For instance, they may  be merely two pieces of buttered bread put together or they may be  elaborate both as to shape and contents. In reality, many different  things are considered as sandwiches. Sometimes one piece of bread spread  with a filling and usually decorated in some way is served with  afternoon tea or a very light luncheon. Then, again, sandwiches often  consist of three layers of bread instead of two, and for other kinds the  bread is toasted instead of being used plain.    As in the case of salads, the housewife must determine from their  composition, the place that sandwiches should take in the meal, for  their food value depends on what is used with the bread. A sandwich that  is high in food value may be used as the main dish in a light meal,  while one that is comparatively low in this respect generally  accompanies another dish, as, for instance, a salad, or is used to take  the place of plain bread.      GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF SANDWICH MAKING    100. BREAD FOR SANDWICHES.--Although sandwiches vary greatly in both  form and contents, bread or something that may be substituted for it  always forms the foundation of this class of food. White bread is much  employed for this purpose, but rye, graham, brown, or whole-wheat bread,  or in fact any other desirable kind, may be used, depending on the  nature of the sandwich or the kind preferred. Several matters concerning  the bread that is used, however, should receive attention if successful  sandwiches are to be the result.    101. In the first place, the bread used should be at least 24 hours old,  as difficulty will be experienced in cutting bread that is any fresher.  Another requirement is that the bread should be firm and of a  comparatively fine texture. The shape of the loaf must also be taken  into consideration. As is easily understood, there will be a  considerable waste of bread if a round sandwich is made from a square  loaf or a square sandwich is cut from a round loaf. When round  sandwiches are desired, it is advisable to bake the bread in round  loaves, unless some good use can be made of the bread that is trimmed  off in cutting the sandwiches.    [Illustration: Fig. 20]    102. For sandwich making, bakers often sell special sandwich bread. Some  persons prefer sandwiches made of such bread, but, as a rule, it will be  found easier to use the ordinary bread baked by the baker or bread that  is baked in the home for"]]]
