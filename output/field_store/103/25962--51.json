But as my gracious lords presently walked on toward the  drawbridge, we went to look at the mount where they had stood; of a sudden  my little girl shouted loudly for joy, seeing that she found on the earth  a costly signet-ring, which one of their Princely Highnesses doubtless  had dropped. I therefore said, \"Come and we will follow our gracious lords  with all speed, and thou shall say to them in Latin, '_Serenissimi  principes, quis vestrum hunc annulum deperdidit_?' (for, as I have  mentioned above, I had instructed her in the Latin tongue ever since her  seventh year); and if one of them says '_Ego_,' give to him the ring.  _Item_.--Should he ask thee in Latin to whom thou belongest, be not  abashed, and say '_Ego sum filia pastoris Coserowiensis_'; for thou wilt  thus find favour in the eyes of their Princely Highnesses, for they are  both gracious gentlemen, more especially the taller one, who is our  gracious ruler, Philippus Julius himself.\" This she promised to do; but as  she trembled sorely as she went, I encouraged her yet more and promised  her a new gown if she did it, seeing that even as a little child she would  have given a great deal for fine clothes. As soon, then, as we were come  into the courtyard, I stood by the statue of his Princely Highness Ernest  Ludewig, and whispered her to run boldly after them, as their Princely  Highnesses were only a few steps before us, and had already turned toward  the great entrance. This she did, but of a sudden she stood still, and  would have turned back, because she was frightened by the spurs of their  Princely Highnesses, as she afterwards told me, seeing that they rattled  and jingled very loudly.    But my gracious lady the Duchess Agnes saw her from the open window  wherein she lay, and called to his Princely Highness, \"My lord, there is a  little maiden behind you, who, it seems, would speak with you,\" whereupon  his Princely Highness straightway turned him round, smiling pleasantly, so  that my little maid presently took courage, and, holding up the ring,  spoke in Latin as I had told her. Hereat both the princes wondered beyond  measure, and after my gracious Duke Philippus had felt his finger, he  answered, \"_Dulcissima puella, ego perdidi_\"; whereupon she gave it to  him. Then he patted her cheek, and again asked, \"_Sed quaenam es, et unde  venis?_\" whereupon she boldly gave her answer, and at the same time  pointed with her finger to where I stood by the statue; whereupon his  Princely Highness motioned me to draw near. My gracious lady saw all that  passed from the window, but all at once she left it. She, however,  came back to it again before I had time even humbly to draw near to my  gracious lord, and beckoned to my child, and held a cake out of the window  for her. On my telling her, she ran up to the window, but her Princely  Highness could not reach so low nor she so high above her as to take it,  wherefore my gracious lady commanded her to come up into the castle, and  as she looked anxiously round after me, motioned me also, as did my  gracious lord himself, who presently took the timid little maid by the  hand and went up with his Princely Highness the Duke Bogislaff. My  gracious lady came to meet us at the door, and caressed and embraced my  little daughter, so that she soon grew quite bold and ate the cake. When  my gracious lord had asked me my name, _item_, why I had in so singular a  manner taught my daughter the Latin tongue, I answered that I had heard  much from a cousin at Cologne of Maria Schurman, and as I had observed a  very excellent _ingenium_ in my child, and also had time enough in my  lonely cure, I did not hesitate to take her in hand, and teach her from  her youth up, seeing I had no boy alive. Hereat their Princely Highnesses  marvelled greatly, and put some more questions to her in Latin, which she  answered without any prompting from me. Whereupon my gracious lord Duke  Philippus said in the vulgar tongue, \"When thou art grown up and art one  day to be married, tell it to me, and thou shall then have another ring  from me, and whatsoever else pertains to a bride, for thou hast this day  done me good service, seeing that this ring is a precious jewel to me, as  I had it from my wife.\" Hereupon I whispered her to kiss his Princely  Highness' hand for such a promise, and so she did.    (But alas! most gracious God, it is one thing to promise, and quite  another to hold. Where is his Princely Highness at this time? Wherefore  let me ever keep in mind that \"thou only art faithful, and that which thou  hast promised thou wilt surely hold.\" Psalm xxxiii. 4. Amen.)    _Item_. When his Princely Highness had also inquired concerning myself  and my cure, and heard that I was of ancient and noble family, and my  _salarium_ very small, he called from the window to his chancellor,  D. Rungius, who stood without, looking at the sun-dial, and told him that  I was to have an addition from the convent at Pudgla, _item_ from the  crown-lands at Ernsthoff, as I mentioned above; but, more's the pity, I  never have received the same, although the _instrumentum donationis_ was  sent me soon after by his Princely Highness' chancellor.    Then cakes were brought for me also, _item_, a glass of foreign wine in a  glass painted with armorial bearings, whereupon I humbly took my leave,  together with my daughter.    However, to come back to my bargain, anybody may guess what joy my child  felt when I showed her the fair ducats and florins I had gotten for the  amber. To the maid, however, we said that we had inherited such riches  from my brother in Holland; and after we had again given thanks to the  Lord on our knees, and eaten our dinner, we bought in a great store of  bread, salt, meat, and stock-fish: _item_, of clothes, seeing that I  provided what was needful for us three throughout the winter from the  cloth-merchant. Moreover, for my daughter I bought a hair-net and a  scarlet silk bodice, with a black apron and white petticoat, _item_, a  fine pair of earrings, as she begged hard for them; and as soon as I had  ordered the needful from the cordwainer we set out on our way homewards,  as it began to grow very dark; but we could not carry nearly all we had  bought. Wherefore we were forced to get a peasant from Bannemin to help  us, who likewise was come into the town; and as I found out from him  that the fellow who gave me the piece of bread was a poor cotter called  Pantermehl, who dwelt in the village by the roadside, I shoved a couple of  loaves in at his house-door without his knowing it, and we went on our way  by the bright moonlight, so that by the help of God we got home about ten  o'clock at night. I likewise gave a loaf to the other fellow, though truly  he deserved it not, seeing that he would go with us no further than to  Zitze. But I let him go, for I, too, had not deserved that the Lord should  so greatly bless me.          _The Eleventh Chapter_      HOW I FED ALL THE CONGREGATION:  _ITEM_, HOW I JOURNEYED TO THE HORSE FAIR AT GUeTZKOW, AND WHAT BEFELL  ME THERE    Next morning my daughter cut up the blessed bread, and sent to every one  in the village a good large piece. But as we saw that our store would  soon run low, we sent the maid with a truck, which we bought of Adam  Lempken, to Wolgast to buy more bread, which she did. _Item_, I gave  notice throughout the parish that on Sunday next I should administer the  blessed sacrament, and in the meantime I bought up all the large fish  that the people of the village had caught. And when the blessed Sunday  was come I first heard the confessions of the whole parish, and after  that I preached a sermon on Matt. xv. 32--\"I have compassion on the  multitude ... for they have nothing to eat.\" I first applied the same to  spiritual food only, and there arose a great sighing from both the men  and the women, when, at the end, I pointed to the altar, whereon stood  the blessed food for the soul, and repeated the words, \"I have compassion  on the multitude ... for they have nothing to eat.\" (N.B.--The pewter  cup I had borrowed at Wolgast, and bought there a little earthenware  plate for a paten till such time as Master Bloom should have made ready  the silver cup and paten I had bespoke.) Thereupon as soon as I had  consecrated and administered the blessed sacrament, _item_, led the  closing hymn, and every one had silently prayed his \"Our Father\" before  going out of church, I came out of the confessional again, and motioned  the people to stay yet a while, as the blessed Saviour would feed not  only their souls, but their bodies also, seeing that he still had the  same compassion on his people as of old on the people at the Sea of  Galilee, as they should presently see. Then I went into the tower and  fetched out two baskets which the maid had bought at Wolgast, and which I  had hidden there in good time; set them down in front of the altar, and  took off the napkins with which they were covered, whereupon a very loud  shout arose, inasmuch as they saw one filled with broiled fish and the  other with bread, which we had put into them privately. Hereupon, like  our Saviour, I gave thanks and brake it, and gave it to the churchwarden  Hinrich Seden, that he might distribute it among the men, and to my  daughter for the women. Whereupon I made application of the text, \"I have  compassion on the multitude ... for they have nothing to eat,\" to the  food of the body also; and walking up and down in the church, amid great  outcries from all, I exhorted them alway to trust in God's mercy, to pray  without ceasing, to work diligently, and to consent to no sin. What was  left I made them gather up for their children and the old people who were  left at home.    After church, when I had scarce put off my surplice, Hinrich Seden his "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8745"],[0,"Wulf the Saxon: A Story of the Norman Conquest (#9)"],[1,"am glad you thought of it, for our steeds would have been  heavily burdened had all that baggage been divided between them.\"    \"We go back more heavily laden than we came,\" Osgod remarked. \"My  wardrobe was then of the scantiest, and your own has been considerably  added to since we came here. Truly, Wulf, I feel that I have changed  mightily in this year, and can scarce believe that it is but a  twelvemonth back since I flung down my hammer and started on my  tramp to Guildford with a change of clothes dangling from the end  of my cudgel. I was glad when you and your party overtook me, for  I was badly scared once or twice when I met a rough fellow or two  on the way, though, fortunately, they did not deem me worth robbing.  We could give a good account of four or five of such knaves now.\"    \"There has been a change indeed, Osgod, and in me as much as in  you, though I have not shot up into such huge proportions. I was a  page then, and had learned but to obey. I am a boy still, but I  have begun to learn to rule; at any rate, to rule myself. I have  not conquered my fault of hastiness altogether.\"    Osgod smiled broadly.    \"You are quick in temper still, Wulf. You remember it was but  yesterday that you rated me soundly because I had fed your hawks  early, and they were too lazy to fly when you wanted them.\"    \"Well, it was annoying,\" Wulf laughed; \"and you deserved rating,  since you have been told over and over again that the hawks were  not to be fed early in the morning. Besides, the rating did you no  harm.\"    \"None at all, master. I know that you mean not what you say, and  hard words break no bones. I should have thought no more of it had  you yourself not remarked that you were still somewhat hasty of  temper.\"    \"I was wrong, Osgod,\" Wulf said, holding out his hand, \"but you  know that I love you, and that though your carelessness and  forgetfulness chafe me sorely at times, I mean not what I say.\"    \"I know it, master, and I would not have you other than you are. I  suppose it is the thickness of my skull that prevents me from taking  in all that I am told, and perhaps if I had more to do I might do  it better. I shall be able to play my part when it comes to hard  blows, and you must remember that no one can excel in all things.  A staghound is trusty and sure when on the chase, but he could not  be taught to fetch and to carry and to perform all sorts of tricks  such as were done by the little mongrel cur that danced to the order  of the mountebank the other evening. My father always said I was a  fool, and that, though for a piece of rough hammering I was by no  means amiss, I should never learn the real intricacies of repairing  fine armour. Everything has its good, you see, Master Wulf; for had  my father thought better of me in his trade, I doubt if he would  ever have given me leave to quit it, and go as your man.\"    \"I have no doubt that is so, Osgod, and heartily glad am I that you  showed no genius for smith's work. Nature evidently intended you  to damage casques and armour rather than to repair them. You have  not got all my clothes with you,\" he added, as he looked round at  the led horse.    \"No indeed, Wulf,\" Osgod said, \"nor a quarter of them, for in truth  your wardrobe has grown prodigiously since we came here. I had to  talk it over with Egbert, having but little faith in my own wits.  He advised me to take the two suits that were most fitted for court,  saying that if he heard you were going to remain there he would  send on the rest in charge of a couple of well-armed men.\"    \"That is the best plan, doubtless,\" Wulf agreed. \"My hawking suit  and some of the others would be useless to me at court, and it would  have been folly to have burdened ourselves with them if we are  likely to return hither shortly.\"    \"Where shall we stop to-night?\" Osgod asked.    \"At the monastery of the Grey Friars, where we put up on our way  from London. It will not be a long ride, but we started late.  To-morrow we shall of course make a long day's journey to Guildford.  I don't know what travellers would do were it not for the priories.\"    \"Sleep in the woods, Wulf, and be none the worse for it. For myself,  I would rather lie on the sward with a blazing fire and the greenwood  overhead, than sleep on the cold stones in a monk's kitchen,  especially if it happened to be a fast-day and one had gone to rest  on a well-nigh empty stomach.\"    \"It is never so bad as that,\" Wulf laughed; \"as a rule, however  much the monks may fast, they entertain their guests well.\"    \"If it is an English monastery they do,\" Osgod admitted, \"but not  where there is a Norman prior, with his new-fangled notions, and  his vigils and fasts and flagellations. If I ever become a monk,  which I trust is not likely, I will take care to enter a Saxon  house, where a man may laugh without its being held to be a deadly  sin, and can sleep honestly without being wakened up half a dozen  times by the chapel bell.\"    \"You would assuredly make but a bad monk, Osgod, and come what will  I do not think you will ever take to that vocation. But let us urge  on our horses to a better pace, or the kitchen will be closed, and  there will be but a poor chance of supper when we reach the priory.\"    \"Well, Osgod,\" Wulf asked the next morning as they rode on their  way, \"how did you fare last night?\"    \"Well enough as to the eating, there was a haunch of cold venison  that a king needn't have grumbled at, but truly my bones ache now  with the hardness of my couch. Couch! there was but the barest  handful of rushes on the cold stone floor, and I woke a score of  times feeling as if my bones were coming through the skin.\"    \"You have been spoilt, Osgod, by a year of sleeping softly. I marked  more than once how thickly the rushes were strewn in that corner  in which you always slept. How will it be when you have to stand  the hardships of a soldier's life?\"    \"I can sleep well on the ground with my cloak round me,\" Osgod said  steadily, \"and if the place be hard you have but to take up a sod  under your hip-bone and another under your shoulder, and you need  not envy one who sleeps on a straw bed. As to cold and wet, I have  never tried sleeping out of doors, but I doubt not that I can stand  it as well as another. As to eating and drinking, they say that  Earl Harold always looks closely after his men, and holds that if  soldiers are to fight well they must be fed well. At any rate,  Master Wulf, I shall be better off than you will, for I have never  been accustomed, as you have, to such luxuries as a straw bed; and  I doubt whether you ever went hungry to bed as I have done many and  many a time, for in the days when my father hoped to make an armourer  of me I was sent off supperless whenever I bungled a job or neglected  his instructions. I wonder what the earl can want you for in such  haste?\"    \"I do not suppose he wants me in any haste at all. He may have  spoken to the king about me, and when Edward again spoke of my  returning he would simply send for me to come at once.\"    Such indeed proved to be the case. When he waited on Harold as soon  as he arrived the latter held out his hand; \"I am glad to see you  back again, Wulf. A year of country air and exercise has done wonders  for you, and though you are not as tall as you might be, you have  truly widened out into fair proportions, and should be able to swing  a battle-axe of full weight. Thinking it was time for you to return  here, I spoke to the king, who was in high good-humour, for he had  been mightily pleased that morning at some of the figures the monks  have wrought in stone for the adornment of his Church of St. Peter;  therefore he not only consented to your return, but chided me gently  for not having called you up to town before. 'The matter had  altogether slipped my mind,' he said; 'I told you that he might  return directly it was shown that it was the bishop's page who was  in fault, and from that day I have never thought of it.'    \"I told the king that I had purposely kept silence, for I thought  the day had come when you should learn your duties down there instead  of dawdling away your time at court. You need not put on a page's  attire any more. You will remain here as my ward, and I have had  so good an account from the good prior of Bramber that in a short  time I shall be able to receive your oath as Thane of Steyning. You  will attend me to court this evening as one of my gentlemen, and I  will then present you to the king, whom it is well that you should  thank for having pardoned you. I hear from the prior that the varlet  you took down with you has grown into a big man, and is well-nigh  as tall as I am already. He must have lodging with my followers  while you are here.\"    Finding that he was to remain for the present at Westminster, Wulf  sent off a messenger at once to request Egbert to forward the rest  of his clothes immediately. That evening the earl took him into a  chamber, where the king was seated surrounded by a few of his  favourites.    \"This is Wulf of Steyning, my lord king,\" Harold said, \"the youth  who was unfortunate enough to incur your royal displeasure a year  since, and who has upon your order returned from his estates. I  have had excellent accounts of him from my good friend the prior  of Bramber, who speaks well alike of his love of study and his  attention to the affairs of his estate. I have also heard from other  hands of his progress in military exercises, and that he bids fair  to become a valiant and skilful soldier of your majesty. He has  prayed me to express his thanks to your majesty for having pardoned  him, and having authorized me to enrol him again in the ranks of  my followers here.\"    The king nodded pleasantly in answer to the deep bow that Wulf made.  \"I was somewhat hasty in your matter,\" he said graciously, \"and  dealt out somewhat hard measure to you, but doubtless, as Earl  Harold said, "]]]
