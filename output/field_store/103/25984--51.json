[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/960"],[0,"The Tin Woodman of Oz (#9)"],[1," it!\" cried Woot the Monkey. \"I'll try it this very night, if  I can manage to steal into her bedroom.\"    \"You mustn't think about it, though,\" warned the bird, \"for she can  read your thoughts whenever she cares to do so. And do not forget,  before you escape, to take me with you. Once I am out of the power of  the Giantess, I may discover a way to save us all.\"    \"We won't forget our fairy friend,\" promised the boy; \"but perhaps you  can tell me how to get into the bedroom.\"    \"No,\" declared Polychrome, \"I cannot advise you as to that. You must  watch for a chance, and slip in when Mrs. Yoop isn't looking.\"    They talked it over for a while longer and then Mrs. Yoop returned.  When she entered, the door opened suddenly, at her command, and closed  as soon as her huge form had passed through the doorway. During that  day she entered her bedroom several times, on one errand or another,  but always she commanded the door to close behind her and her prisoners  found not the slightest chance to leave the big hall in which they were  confined.    The Green Monkey thought it would be wise to make a friend of the big  woman, so as to gain her confidence, so he sat on the back of her chair  and chattered to her while she mended her stockings and sewed silver  buttons on some golden shoes that were as big as row-boats. This  pleased the Giantess and she would pause at times to pat the Monkey's  head. The little Brown Bear curled up in a corner and lay still all  day. The Owl and the Canary found they could converse together in the  bird language, which neither the Giantess nor the Bear nor the Monkey  could understand; so at times they twittered away to each other and  passed the long, dreary day quite cheerfully.    After dinner Mrs. Yoop took a big fiddle from a big cupboard and played  such loud and dreadful music that her prisoners were all thankful when  at last she stopped and said she was going to bed.    After cautioning the Monkey and Bear and Owl to behave themselves  during the night, she picked up the cage containing the Canary and,  going to the door of her bedroom, commanded it to open. Just then,  however, she remembered she had left her fiddle lying upon a table, so  she went back for it and put it away in the cupboard, and while her  back was turned the Green Monkey slipped through the open door into her  bedroom and hid underneath the bed. The Giantess, being sleepy, did not  notice this, and entering her room she made the door close behind her  and then hung the bird-cage on a peg by the window. Then she began to  undress, first taking off the lace apron and laying it over the  bedpost, where it was within easy reach of her hand.    As soon as Mrs. Yoop was in bed the lights all went out, and Woot the  Monkey crouched under the bed and waited patiently until he heard the  Giantess snoring. Then he crept out and in the dark felt around until  he got hold of the apron, which he at once tied around his own waist.    Next, Woot tried to find the Canary, and there was just enough  moonlight showing through the window to enable him to see where the  cage hung; but it was out of his reach. At first he was tempted to  leave Polychrome and escape with his other friends, but remembering his  promise to the Rainbow's Daughter Woot tried to think how to save her.    A chair stood near the window, and this--showing dimly in the  moonlight--gave him an idea. By pushing against it with all his might,  he found he could move the giant chair a few inches at a time. So he  pushed and pushed until the chair was beneath the bird-cage, and then  he sprang noiselessly upon the seat--for his monkey form enabled him to  jump higher than he could do as a boy--and from there to the back of  the chair, and so managed to reach the cage and take it off the peg.  Then down he sprang to the floor and made his way to the door. \"Open!\"  he commanded, and at once the door obeyed and swung open, But his voice  wakened Mrs. Yoop, who gave a wild cry and sprang out of bed with one  bound. The Green Monkey dashed through the doorway, carrying the cage  with him, and before the Giantess could reach the door it slammed shut  and imprisoned her in her own bed-chamber!    The noise she made, pounding upon the door, and her yells of anger and  dreadful threats of vengeance, filled all our friends with terror, and  Woot the Monkey was so excited that in the dark he could not find the  outer door of the hall. But the Tin Owl could see very nicely in the  dark, so he guided his friends to the right place and when all were  grouped before the door Woot commanded it to open. The Magic Apron  proved as powerful as when it had been worn by the Giantess, so a  moment later they had rushed through the passage and were standing in  the fresh night air outside the castle, free to go wherever they willed.          Chapter Eight    The Menace of the Forest      \"Quick!\" cried Polychrome the Canary; \"we must hurry, or Mrs. Yoop may  find some way to recapture us, even now. Let us get out of her Valley  as soon as possible.\"    So they set off toward the east, moving as swiftly as they could, and  for a long time they could hear the yells and struggles of the  imprisoned Giantess. The Green Monkey could run over the ground very  swiftly, and he carried with him the bird-cage containing Polychrome  the Rain-bow's Daughter. Also the Tin Owl could skip and fly along at a  good rate of speed, his feathers rattling against one another with a  tinkling sound as he moved. But the little Brown Bear, being stuffed  with straw, was a clumsy traveler and the others had to wait for him to  follow.    However, they were not very long in reaching the ridge that led out of  Mrs. Yoop's Valley, and when they had passed this ridge and descended  into the next valley they stopped to rest, for the Green Monkey was  tired.    \"I believe we are safe, now,\" said Polychrome, when her cage was set  down and the others had all gathered around it, \"for Mrs. Yoop dares  not go outside of her own Valley, for fear of being captured by her  enemies. So we may take our time to consider what to do next.\"    \"I'm afraid poor Mrs. Yoop will starve to death, if no one lets her out  of her bedroom,\" said Woot, who had a heart as kind as that of the Tin  Woodman. \"We've taken her Magic Apron away, and now the doors will  never open.\"    \"Don't worry about that,\" advised Polychrome. \"Mrs. Yoop has plenty of  magic left to console her.\"    \"Are you sure of that?\" asked the Green Monkey.    \"Yes, for I've been watching her for weeks,\" said the Canary. \"She has  six magic hairpins, which she wears in her hair, and a magic ring which  she wears on her thumb and which is invisible to all eyes except those  of a fairy, and magic bracelets on both her ankles. So I am positive  that she will manage to find a way out of her prison.\"    \"She might transform the door into an archway,\" suggested the little  Brown Bear.    \"That would be easy for her,\" said the Tin Owl; \"but I'm glad she was  too angry to think of that before we got out of her Valley.\"    \"Well, we have escaped the big woman, to be sure,\" remarked the Green  Monkey, \"but we still wear the awful forms the cruel yookoohoo gave us.  How are we going to get rid of these shapes, and become ourselves  again?\"    None could answer that question. They sat around the cage, brooding  over the problem, until the Monkey fell asleep. Seeing this, the Canary  tucked her head under her wing and also slept, and the Tin Owl and the  Brown Bear did not disturb them until morning came and it was broad  daylight.    \"I'm hungry,\" said Woot, when he wakened, for his knapsack of food had  been left behind at the castle.    \"Then let us travel on until we can find something for you to eat,\"  returned the Scarecrow Bear.    \"There is no use in your lugging my cage any farther,\" declared the  Canary. \"Let me out, and throw the cage away. Then I can fly with you  and find my own breakfast of seeds. Also I can search for water, and  tell you where to find it.\"    So the Green Monkey unfastened the door of the golden cage and the  Canary hopped out. At first she flew high in the air and made great  circles overhead, but after a time she returned and perched beside them.    \"At the east in the direction we were following,\" announced the Canary,  \"there is a fine forest, with a brook running through it. In the forest  there may be fruits or nuts growing, or berry bushes at its edge, so  let us go that way.\"    They agreed to this and promptly set off, this time moving more  deliberately. The Tin Owl, which had guided their way during the night,  now found the sunshine very trying to his big eyes, so he shut them  tight and perched upon the back of the little Brown Bear, which carried  the Owl's weight with ease. The Canary sometimes perched upon the Green  Monkey's shoulder and sometimes fluttered on ahead of the party, and in  this manner they traveled in good spirits across that valley and into  the next one to the east of it.    This they found to be an immense hollow, shaped like a saucer, and on  its farther edge appeared the forest which Polychrome had seen from the  sky.    \"Come to think of it,\" said the Tin Owl, waking up and blinking  comically at his friends, \"there's no object, now, in our traveling to  the Munchkin Country. My idea in going there was to marry Nimmie Amee,  but however much the Munchkin girl may have loved a Tin Woodman, I  cannot reasonably expect her to marry a Tin Owl.\"    \"There is some truth in that, my friend,\" remarked the Brown Bear. \"And  to think that I, who was considered the handsomest Scarecrow in the  world, am now condemned to be a scrubby, no-account beast, whose only  redeeming feature is that he is stuffed with straw!\"    \"Consider my case, please,\" said Woot. \"The cruel Giantess has made a  Monkey of a Boy, and that is the most dreadful deed of all!\"    \"Your color is rather pretty,\" said the Brown Bear, eyeing Woot "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/961"],[0,"Glinda of Oz (#9)"],[1,"having  muttered a magic phrase in a strange tongue, she left the room and  walked slowly around the outside of the house, making a complete circle  and waving her wand in mystic curves as she walked. Lady Aurex watched  her curiously and, when Ozma had again entered the room and seated  herself, she asked:    \"What have you done?\"    \"I've enchanted this house in such a manner that Queen Coo-ee-oh, with  all her witchcraft, cannot hear one word we speak within the magic  circle I have made,\" replied Ozma. \"We may now speak freely and as  loudly as we wish, without fear of the Queen's anger.\"    Lady Aurex brightened at this.    \"Can I trust you?\" she asked.    \"Ev'rybody trusts Ozma,\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"She is true and honest,  and your wicked Queen will be sorry she insulted the powerful Ruler of  all the Land of Oz.\"    \"The Queen does not know me yet,\" said Ozma, \"but I want you to know  me, Lady Aurex, and I want you to tell me why you, and all the  Skeezers, are unhappy. Do not fear Coo-ee-oh's anger, for she cannot  hear a word we say, I assure you.\"    Lady Aurex was thoughtful a moment; then she said: \"I shall trust you,  Princess Ozma, for I believe you are what you say you are--our supreme  Ruler. If you knew the dreadful punishments our Queen inflicts upon us,  you would not wonder we are so unhappy. The Skeezers are not bad  people; they do not care to quarrel and fight, even with their enemies  the Flatheads; but they are so cowed and fearful of Coo-ee-oh that they  obey her slightest word, rather than suffer her anger.\"    \"Hasn't she any heart, then?\" asked Dorothy.    \"She never displays mercy. She loves no one but herself,\" asserted Lady  Aurex, but she trembled as she said it, as if afraid even yet of her  terrible Queen.    \"That's pretty bad,\" said Dorothy, shaking her head gravely. \"I see  you've a lot to do here, Ozma, in this forsaken corner of the Land of  Oz. First place, you've got to take the magic away from Queen  Coo-ee-oh, and from that awful Su-dic, too. My idea is that neither of  them is fit to rule anybody, 'cause they're cruel and hateful. So  you'll have to give the Skeezers and Flatheads new rulers and teach all  their people that they're part of the Land of Oz and must obey, above  all, the lawful Ruler, Ozma of Oz. Then, when you've done that, we can  go back home again.\"    Ozma smiled at her little friend's earnest counsel, but Lady Aurex said  in an anxious tone:    \"I am surprised that you suggest these reforms while you are yet  prisoners on this island and in Coo-ee-oh's power. That these things  should be done, there is no doubt, but just now a dreadful war is  likely to break out, and frightful things may happen to us all.  Our  Queen has such conceit that she thinks she can overcome the Su-dic and  his people, but it is said Su-dic's magic is very powerful, although  not as great as that possessed by his wife Rora, before Coo-ee-oh  transformed her into a Golden Pig.\"    \"I don't blame her very much for doing that,\" remarked Dorothy, \"for  the Flatheads were wicked to try to catch your beautiful fish and the  Witch Rora wanted to poison all the fishes in the lake.\"    \"Do you know the reason?\" asked the Lady Aurex.    \"I don't s'pose there was any reason, 'cept just wickedness,\" replied  Dorothy.    \"Tell us the reason,\" said Ozma earnestly.    \"Well, your Majesty, once--a long time ago--the Flatheads and the  Skeezers were friendly. They visited our island and we visited their  mountain, and everything was pleasant between the two peoples. At that  time the Flatheads were ruled by three Adepts in Sorcery, beautiful  girls who were not Flatheads, but had wandered to the Flat Mountain and  made their home there. These three Adepts used their magic only for  good, and the mountain people gladly made them their rulers. They  taught the Flatheads how to use their canned brains and how to work  metals into clothing that would never wear out, and many other things  that added to their happiness and content.    \"Coo-ee-oh was our Queen then, as now, but she knew no magic and so had  nothing to be proud of. But the three Adepts were very kind to  Coo-ee-oh. They built for us this wonderful dome of glass and our  houses of marble and taught us to make beautiful clothing and many  other things. Coo-ee-oh pretended to be very grateful for these favors,  but it seems that all the time she was jealous of the three Adepts and  secretly tried to discover their arts of magic. In this she was more  clever than anyone suspected. She invited the three Adepts to a banquet  one day, and while they were feasting Coo-ee-oh stole their charms and  magical instruments and transformed them into three fishes--a gold  fish, a silver fish and a bronze fish. While the poor fishes were  gasping and flopping helplessly on the floor of the banquet room one of  them said reproachfully: 'You will be punished for this, Coo-ee-oh, for  if one of us dies or is destroyed, you will become shrivelled and  helpless, and all your stolen magic will depart from you.' Frightened  by this threat, Coo-ee-oh at once caught up the three fish and ran with  them to the shore of the lake, where she cast them into the water. This  revived the three Adepts and they swam away and disappeared.    \"I, myself, witnessed this shocking scene,\" continued Lady Aurex, \"and  so did many other Skeezers. The news was carried to the Flatheads, who  then turned from friends to enemies. The Su-dic and his wife Rora were  the only ones on the mountain who were glad the three Adepts had been  lost to them, and they at once became Rulers of the Flatheads and stole  their canned brains from others to make themselves the more powerful.  Some of the Adepts' magic tools had been left on the mountain, and  these Rora seized and by the use of them she became a witch.    \"The result of Coo-ee-oh's treachery was to make both the Skeezers and  the Flatheads miserable instead of happy. Not only were the Su-dic and  his wife cruel to their people, but our Queen at once became proud and  arrogant and treated us very unkindly. All the Skeezers knew she had  stolen her magic powers and so she hated us and made us humble  ourselves before her and obey her slightest word. If we disobeyed, or  did not please her, or if we talked about her when we were in our own  homes she would have us dragged to the whipping post in her palace and  lashed with knotted cords. That is why we fear her so greatly.\"    This story filled Ozma's heart with sorrow and Dorothy's heart with  indignation.    \"I now understand,\" said Ozma, \"why the fishes in the lake have brought  about war between the Skeezers and the Flatheads.\"    \"Yes,\" Lady Aurex answered, \"now that you know the story it is easy to  understand. The Su-dic and his wife came to our lake hoping to catch  the silver fish, or gold fish, or bronze fish--any one of them would  do--and by destroying it deprive Coo-ee-oh of her magic. Then they  could easily conquer her. Also they had another reason for wanting to  catch the fish--they feared that in some way the three Adepts might  regain their proper forms and then they would be sure to return to the  mountain and punish Rora and the Su-dic. That was why Rora finally  tried to poison all the fishes in the lake, at the time Coo-ee-oh  transformed her into a Golden Pig. Of course this attempt to destroy  the fishes frightened the Queen, for her safety lies in keeping the  three fishes alive.\"    \"I s'pose Coo-ee-oh will fight the Flatheads with all her might,\"  observed Dorothy.    \"And with all her magic,\" added Ozma, thoughtfully.    \"I do not see how the Flatheads can get to this island to hurt us,\"  said Lady Aurex.    \"They have bows and arrows, and I guess they mean to shoot the arrows  at your big dome, and break all the glass in it,\" suggested Dorothy.    But Lady Aurex shook her head with a smile.    \"They cannot do that,\" she replied.    \"Why not?\"    \"I dare not tell you why, but if the Flatheads come to-morrow morning  you will yourselves see the reason.\"    \"I do not think they will attempt to harm the island,\" Ozma declared.  \"I believe they will first attempt to destroy the fishes, by poison or  some other means. If they succeed in that, the conquest of the island  will not be difficult.\"    \"They have no boats,\" said Lady Aurex, \"and Coo-ee-oh, who has long  expected this war, has been preparing for it in many astonishing ways.  I almost wish the Flatheads would conquer us, for then we would be free  from our dreadful Queen; but I do not wish to see the three transformed  fishes destroyed, for in them lies our only hope of future happiness.\"    \"Ozma will take care of you, whatever happens,\" Dorothy assured her.  But the Lady Aurex, not knowing the extent of Ozma's power--which was,  in fact, not so great as Dorothy imagined--could not take much comfort  in this promise.    It was evident there would be exciting times on the morrow, if the  Flatheads really attacked the Skeezers of the Magic Isle.          Chapter Ten    Under Water      When night fell all the interior of the Great Dome, streets and houses,  became lighted with brilliant incandescent lamps, which rendered it  bright as day. Dorothy thought the island must look beautiful by night  from the outer shore of the lake. There was revelry and feasting in the  Queen's palace, and the music of the royal band could be plainly heard  in Lady Aurex's house, where Ozma and Dorothy remained with their  hostess and keeper. They were prisoners, but treated with much  consideration.    Lady Aurex gave them a nice supper and when they wished to retire  showed them to a pretty room with comfortable beds and wished them a  good night and pleasant dreams.    \"What do you think of all this, Ozma?\" Dorothy anxiously inquired when  they were alone.    \"I am glad we came,\" was the reply, \"for although there may be mischief  done to-morrow, it was necessary I should know about these people,  whose"]]]
