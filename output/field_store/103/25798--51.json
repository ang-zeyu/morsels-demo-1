They shook  their heads at the visitors' plan to stand guard at the Frye ruins near  the glen; and as they left, had little expectancy of ever seeing the  watchers again.    There were rumblings under the hills that night, and the whippoorwills  piped threateningly. Once in a while a wind, sweeping up out of Cold  Spring Glen, would bring a touch of ineffable fetor to the heavy night  air; such a fetor as all three of the watchers had smelled once before,  when they stood above a dying thing that had passed for fifteen years  and a half as a human being. But the looked-for terror did not appear.  Whatever was down there in the glen was biding its time, and Armitage  told his colleagues it would be suicidal to try to attack it in the  dark.    Morning came wanly, and the night-sounds ceased. It was a gray, bleak  day, with now and then a drizzle of rain; and heavier and heavier  clouds seemed to be piling themselves up beyond the hills to the  northwest. The men from Arkham were undecided what to do. Seeking  shelter from the increasing rainfall beneath one of the few undestroyed  Frye outbuildings, they debated the wisdom of waiting, or of taking the  aggressive and going down into the glen in quest of their nameless,  monstrous quarry. The downpour waxed in heaviness, and distant peals of  thunder sounded from far horizons. Sheet lightning shimmered, and then  a forky bolt flashed near at hand, as if descending into the accursed  glen itself. The sky grew very dark, and the watchers hoped that the  storm would prove a short, sharp one followed by clear weather.    It was still gruesomely dark when, not much over an hour later, a  confused babel of voices sounded down the road. Another moment brought  to view a frightened group of more than a dozen men, running, shouting,  and even whimpering hysterically. Someone in the lead began sobbing out  words, and the Arkham men started violently when those words developed  a coherent form.    \"Oh, my Gawd, my Gawd!\" the voice choked out; \"it's a-goin' agin, _an'  this time by day_! It's aout--it's aout an' a-movin' this very minute,  an' only the Lord knows when it'll be on us all!\"    The speaker panted into silence, but another took up his message.    \"Nigh on a haour ago Zeb Whateley here heerd the 'phone a-ringin', an'  it was Mis' Corey, George's wife that lives daown by the junction.  She says the hired boy Luther was aout drivin' in the caows from the  storm arter the big bolt, when he see all the trees a-bendin' at the  maouth o' the glen--opposite side ter this--an' smelt the same awful  smell like he smelt when he faound the big tracks las' Monday mornin'.  An' she says he says they was a swishin', lappin' saound, more nor  what the bendin' trees an' bushes could make, an' all on a suddent the  trees along the rud begun ter git pushed one side, an' they was a awful  stompin' an' splashin' in the mud. But mind ye, Luther he didn't see  nothin' at all, only jest the bendin' trees an' underbrush.    \"Then fur ahead where Bishop's Brook goes under the rud he heerd a  awful creakin' an' strainin' on the bridge, an' says he could tell the  saound o' wood a-startin' to crack an' split. An' all the whiles he  never see a thing, only them trees an' bushes a-bendin'. An' when the  swishin' saound got very fur off--on the rud towards Wizard Whateley's  an' Sentinel Hill--Luther he had the guts ter step up whar he'd heerd  it fust an' look at the graound. It was all mud an' water, an' the sky  was dark, an' the rain was wipin' aout all tracks abaout as fast as  could be; but beginnin' at the glen maouth, whar the trees bed moved,  they was still some o' them awful prints big as bar'ls like he seen  Monday.\"    At this point the first excited speaker interrupted.    \"But _that_ ain't the trouble naow--that was only the start. Zeb here  was callin' folks up an' everybody was a-listenin' in when a call from  Seth Bishop's cut in. His haousekeeper Sally was carryin' on fit ter  kill--she'd jest seed the trees a-bendin' beside the rud, an' says  they was a kind o' mushy saound, like a elephant puffin' an' treadin',  a-headin' fer the haouse. Then she up an' spoke suddent of a fearful  smell, an' says her boy Cha'ncey was a-screamin' as haow it was jest  like what he smelt up to the Whateley rewins Monday mornin'. An' the  dogs was all barkin' an' whinin' awful.    \"An' then she let aout a turrible yell, an' says the shed daown the  rud hed jest caved in like the storm hed blowed it over, only the wind  wa'n't strong enough to dew that. Everybody was a-listenin', an' ye  could hear lots o' folks on the wire a-gaspin'. All to onct Sally she  yelled agin, an' says the front yard picket fence bed jest crumpled up,  though they wa'n't no sign o' what done it. Then everybody on the line  could hear Cha'ncey an' ol' Seth Bishop a-yellin', tew, an' Sally was  shriekin' aout that suthin' heavy hed struck the haouse--not lightnin'  nor nothin', but suthin' heavy agin' the front, that kep' a-launchin'  itself agin an' agin, though ye couldn't see nuthin' aout the front  winders. An' then ... an' then....\"    Lines of fright deepened on every face; and Armitage, shaken as he was,  had barely poise enough to prompt the speaker.    \"An' then ... Sally she yelled aout, 'O help, the haouse is a-cavin'  in' ... an' on the wire we could hoar a turrible crashin', an' a hull  flock o' screamin' ... jest like when Elmer Frye's place was took, only  wuss....\"    The man paused, and another of the crowd spoke.    \"That's all--not a saound nor squeak over the 'phone arter that. Jest  still-like. We that heerd it got aout Fords an' wagons an' raounded  up as many able-bodied men-folks as we could get, at Corey's place,  an' come up here ter see what yew thought best ter dew. Not but what I  think it's the Lord's judgment fer our iniquities, that no mortal kin  ever set aside.\"    Armitage saw that the time for positive action had come, and spoke  decisively to the faltering group of frightened rustics.    \"We must follow it, boys.\" He made his voice as reassuring as possible.  \"I believe there's a chance of putting it out of business. You men  know that those Whateleys were wizards--well, this thing is a thing  of wizardry, and must be put down by the same means. I've seen Wilbur  Whateley's diary and read some of the strange old books he used to  read, and I think I know the right kind of a spell to recite to make  the thing fade away. Of course, one can't be sure, but we can always  take a chance. It's invisible--I knew it would be--but there's a powder  in this long-distance sprayer that might make it show up for a second.  Later on we'll try it. It's a frightful thing to have alive, but it  isn't as bad as what Wilbur would have let in if he'd lived longer.  You'll never know what the world has escaped. Now we've only this one  thing to fight, and it can't multiply. It can, though, do a lot of  harm; so we mustn't hesitate to rid the community of it.    \"We must follow it--and the way to begin is to go to the place that has  just been wrecked. Let somebody lead the way--I don't know your roads  very well, but I've an idea there might be a shorter cut across lots.  How about it?\"    The men shuffled about a moment, and then Earl Sawyer spoke softly,  pointing with a grimy finger through the steadily lessening rain.    \"I guess ye kin git to Seth Bishop's quickest by cuttin' acrost the  lower medder here, wadin' the brook at the low place, an' climbin'  through Carrier's mowin' an' the timber-lot beyont. That comes aout on  the upper rud mighty nigh Seth's--a leetle t'other side.\"    Armitage, with Rice and Morgan, started to walk in the direction  indicated; and most of the natives followed slowly. The sky was growing  lighter, and there were signs that the storm had worn itself away. When  Armitage inadvertently took a wrong direction, Joe Osborn warned him  and walked ahead to show the right one. Courage and confidence were  mounting; though the twilight of the almost perpendicular wooded hill  which lay toward the end of their short cut, and among whose fantastic  ancient trees they had to scramble as if up a ladder, put these  qualities to a severe test.    At length they emerged on a muddy road to find the sun coming out.  They were a little beyond the Seth Bishop place, but bent trees and  hideously unmistakable tracks showed what had passed by. Only a few  moments were consumed in surveying the ruins just around the bend. It  was the Frye incident all over again, and nothing dead or living was  found in either of the collapsed shells which had been the Bishop house  and barn. No one cared to remain there amidst the stench and the tarry  stickiness, but all turned instinctively to the line of horrible prints  leading on toward the wrecked Whateley farmhouse and the altar-crowned  slopes of Sentinel Hill.    As the men passed the site of Wilbur Whateley's abode they shuddered  visibly, and seemed again to mix hesitancy with their zeal. It was  no joke tracking down something as big as a house that one could not  see, but that had all the vicious malevolence of a demon. Opposite the  base of Sentinel Hill the tracks left the road, and there was a fresh  bending and matting visible along the broad swath marking the monster's  former route to and from the summit.    Armitage produced a pocket telescope of considerable power and scanned  the steep green side of the hill. Then he handed the instrument to  Morgan, whose sight was keener. After a moment of gazing Morgan cried  out sharply, passing the glass to Earl Sawyer and indicating a certain  spot on the slope with his finger. Sawyer, as clumsy as most non-users  of optical devices are, fumbled a while; but eventually focused the  lenses with Armitage's aid. When he did so his cry was less restrained  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/502"],[0,"Desert Gold (#9)"],[1,"failed.  But her hands  flew up; quick as a flash she raised her face--kissed him.  Then she  turned and with a sob fell into Thorne's arms.    There ensued a silence broken only by Mercedes' sobbing.  Gale walked  some paces away.  If he were not stunned, he certainly was agitated.  The strange, sweet fire of that girl's lips remained with him.  On the  spur of the moment he imagined he had a jealousy of Thorne.  But  presently this passed.  It was only that he had been deeply  moved--stirred to the depths during the last hour--had become conscious  of the awakening of a spirit.  What remained with him now was the  splendid glow of gladness that he had been of service to Thorne.  And  by the intensity of Mercedes' abandon of relief and gratitude he  measured her agony of terror and the fate he had spared her.    \"Dick, Dick, come here!\" called Thorne softly.  \"Let's pull ourselves  together now.  We've got a problem yet.  What to do?  Where to go? How  to get any place?  We don't dare risk the station--the corrals where  Mexicans hire out horses.  We're on good old U.S. ground this minute,  but we're not out of danger.\"    As he paused, evidently hoping for a suggestion from Gale, the silence  was broken by the clear, ringing peal of a bugle.  Thorne gave a  violent start.  Then he bent over, listening.  The beautiful notes of  the bugle floated out of the darkness, clearer, sharper, faster.    \"It's a call, Dick!  It's a call!\" he cried.    Gale had no answer to make.  Mercedes stood as if stricken.  The bugle  call ended.  From a distance another faintly pealed.  There were other  sounds too remote to recognize.  Then scattering shots rattled out.    \"Dick, the rebels are fighting somebody,\" burst out Thorne, excitedly.  \"The little federal garrison still holds its stand. Perhaps it is  attacked again.  Anyway, there's something doing over the line.  Maybe  the crazy Greasers are firing on our camp.  We've feared it--in the  dark.... And here I am, away without leave--practically a deserter!\"    \"Go back!  Go back, before you're too late!\" cried Mercedes.    \"Better make tracks, Thorne,\" added Gale.  \"It can't help our  predicament for you to be arrested.  I'll take care of Mercedes.\"    \"No, no, no,\" replied Thorne.  \"I can get away--avoid arrest.\"    \"That'd be all right for the immediate present.  But it's not best for  the future.  George, a deserter is a deserter!... Better hurry. Leave  the girl to me till tomorrow.\"    Mercedes embraced her lover, begged him to go.  Thorne wavered.    \"Dick, I'm up against it,\" he said.  \"You're right.  If only I can get  back in time.  But, oh, I hate to leave her!  Old fellow, you've saved  her!  I already owe you everlasting gratitude.  Keep out of Casita,  Dick.  The U.S. side might be safe, but I'm afraid to trust it at  night.  Go out in the desert, up in the mountains, in some safe place.  Then come to me in camp.  We'll plan.  I'll have to confide in Colonel  Weede.  Maybe he'll help us.  Hide her from the rebels--that's all.\"    He wrung Dick's hand, clasped Mercedes tightly in his arms, kissed her,  and murmured low over her, then released her to rush off into the  darkness.  He disappeared in the gloom.  The sound of his dull  footfalls gradually died away.    For a moment the desert silence oppressed Gale.  He was unaccustomed to  such strange stillness.  There was a low stir of sand, a rustle of  stiff leaves in the wind.  How white the stars burned!  Then a coyote  barked, to be bayed by a dog.  Gale realized that he was between the  edge of an unknown desert and the edge of a hostile town. He had to  choose the desert, because, though he had no doubt that in Casita there  were many Americans who might befriend him, he could not chance the  risks of seeking them at night.    He felt a slight touch on his arm, felt it move down, felt Mercedes  slip a trembling cold little hand into his.  Dick looked at her. She  seemed a white-faced girl now, with staring, frightened black eyes that  flashed up at him.  If the loneliness, the silence, the desert, the  unknown dangers of the night affected him, what must they be to this  hunted, driven girl?  Gale's heart swelled.  He was alone with her.  He  had no weapon, no money, no food, no drink, no covering, nothing except  his two hands.  He had absolutely no knowledge of the desert, of the  direction or whereabouts of the boundary line between the republics; he  did not know where to find the railroad, or any road or trail, or  whether or not there were towns near or far.  It was a critical,  desperate situation.  He thought first of the girl, and groaned in  spirit, prayed that it would be given him to save her.  When he  remembered himself it was with the stunning consciousness that he could  conceive of no situation which he would have exchanged for this  one--where fortune had set him a perilous task of loyalty to a friend,  to a helpless girl.    \"Senor, senor!\" suddenly whispered Mercedes, clinging to him. \"Listen!  I hear horses coming!\"        III    A FLIGHT INTO THE DESERT    UNEASY and startled, Gale listened and, hearing nothing, wondered if  Mercedes's fears had not worked upon her imagination.  He felt a  trembling seize her, and he held her hands tightly.    \"You were mistaken, I guess,\" he whispered.    \"No, no, senor.\"    Dick turned his ear to the soft wind.  Presently he heard, or imagined  he heard, low beats.  Like the first faint, far-off beats of a drumming  grouse, they recalled to him the Illinois forests of his boyhood.  In a  moment he was certain the sounds were the padlike steps of hoofs in  yielding sand.  The regular tramp was not that of grazing horses.    On the instant, made cautious and stealthy by alarm, Gale drew Mercedes  deeper into the gloom of the shrubbery.  Sharp pricks from thorns  warned him that he was pressing into a cactus growth, and he protected  Mercedes as best he could.  She was shaking as one with a severe chill.  She breathed with little hurried pants and leaned upon him almost in  collapse.  Gale ground his teeth in helpless rage at the girl's fate.  If she had not been beautiful she might still have been free and happy  in her home.  What a strange world to live in--how unfair was fate!    The sounds of hoofbeats grew louder.  Gale made out a dark moving mass  against a background of dull gray.  There was a line of horses. He  could not discern whether or not all the horses carried riders. The  murmur of a voice struck his ear--then a low laugh.  It made him  tingle, for it sounded American.  Eagerly he listened.  There was an  interval when only the hoofbeats could be heard.    \"It shore was, Laddy, it shore was,\" came a voice out of the darkness.  \"Rough house!  Laddy, since wire fences drove us out of Texas we ain't  seen the like of that.  An' we never had such a call.\"    \"Call?  It was a burnin' roast,\" replied another voice.  \"I felt low  down.  He vamoosed some sudden, an' I hope he an' his friends shook the  dust of Casita.  That's a rotten town Jim.\"    Gale jumped up in joy.  What luck!  The speakers were none other than  the two cowboys whom he had accosted in the Mexican hotel.    \"Hold on, fellows,\" he called out, and strode into the road.    The horses snorted and stamped.  Then followed swift rustling sounds--a  clinking of spurs, then silence.  The figures loomed clearer in the  gloom.. Gale saw five or six horses, two with riders, and one other, at  least, carrying a pack.  When Gale got within fifteen feet of the group  the foremost horseman said:    \"I reckon that's close enough, stranger.\"    Something in the cowboy's hand glinted darkly bright in the starlight.    \"You'd recognize me, if it wasn't so dark,\" replied Gale, halting. \"I  spoke to you a little while ago--in the saloon back there.\"    \"Come over an' let's see you,\" said the cowboy curtly.    Gale advanced till he was close to the horse.  The cowboy leaned over  the saddle and peered into Gale's face.  Then, without a word, he  sheathed the gun and held out his hand.  Gale met a grip of steel that  warmed his blood.  The other cowboy got off his nervous, spirited horse  and threw the bridle.  He, too, peered closely into Gale's face.    \"My name's Ladd,\" he said.  \"Reckon I'm some glad to meet you again.\"    Gale felt another grip as hard and strong as the other had been.  He  realized he had found friends who belonged to a class of men whom he  had despaired of ever knowing.    \"Gale--Dick Gale is my name,\" he began, swiftly.  \"I dropped into  Casita to-night hardly knowing where I was.  A boy took me to that  hotel.  There I met an old friend whom I had not seen for years. He  belongs to the cavalry stationed here.  He had befriended a Spanish  girl--fallen in love with her.  Rojas had killed this girl's  father--tried to abduct her.... You know what took place at the hotel.  Gentlemen, if it's ever possible, I'll show you how I appreciate what  you did for me there.  I got away, found my friend with the girl.  We  hurried out here beyond the edge of town.  Then Thorne had to make a  break for camp.  We heard bugle calls, shots, and he was away without  leave.  That left the girl with me.  I don't know what to do.  Thorne  swears Casita is no place for Mercedes at night.\"    \"The girl ain't no peon, no common Greaser?\" interrupted Ladd.    \"No.  Her name is Castaneda.  She belongs to an old Spanish family,  once rich and influential.\"    \"Reckoned as much,\" replied the cowboy.  \"There's more than Rojas's  wantin' to kidnap a pretty girl.  Shore he does that every day or so.  Must be somethin' political or feelin' against class.  Well, Casita  ain't no place for your friend's girl at night or day, or any time.  Shore, there's Americans who'd take her in an' fight for her, if  necessary.  But it ain't wise to risk that.  Lash, what do you say?\"    \"It's been gettin' hotter round this Greaser corral for some weeks,\"  replied the other cowboy.  \"If that two-bit of a"]]]
