Yet a third point has to come into consideration in connexion with the  woman voter. This is, that she would be pernicious to the State also  by virtue of her defective moral equipment.    Let me make clear what is the nature of the defect of morality which  is here imputed to woman.    Conduct may be appraised by very different standards.    We may appraise it by reference to a transcendental religious ideal  which demands that the physical shall be subordinated to the  spiritual, and that the fetters of self should be flung aside.    Or again, we may bring into application purely mundane utilitarian  standards, and may account conduct as immoral or moral according as it  seeks only the happiness of the agent, or the happiness of the narrow  circle of humanity which includes along with him also his relatives  and intimate friends, or again, the welfare of the wider circle which  includes all those with whom he may have come into contact, or whom he  may affect through his work; or again, the welfare of the whole  body-politic of which we are members; or lastly, that of the general  body of mankind.    Now it might be contended that all these different moralities are in  their essence one and the same; and that one cannot comply with the  requirements of any one of these systems of morality without  fulfilling in a measure the requirements of all the other moralities.    It might, for example, be urged that if a man strive after the  achievement of a transcendental ideal in which self shall be annulled,  he will _pro tanto [to such extent]_ be bringing welfare to his  domestic circle; or again, that it would be impossible to promote  domestic welfare without, through this, promoting the welfare of the  nation, and through that the general welfare of the world.    In like manner it might be argued that all work done for abstract  principles of morality like liberty and justice, for the advancement  of knowledge, and for whatever else goes to the building up of a  higher civilisation, will, by promoting the welfare of the general  body of mankind, redound to the advantage of each several nation, and  ultimately to the advantage of each domestic circle.    But all this would be true only in a very superficial and strictly  qualified sense. In reality, just as there is eternal conflict between  egoism and altruism, so there is conflict between the different  moralities.    To take examples, the attempt to actualise the transcendental  religious ideal may, when pursued with ardour, very easily conflict  with the morality which makes domestic felicity its end. And again--as  we see in the anti-militarist movement in France, in the history of  the early Christian Church, in the case of the Quakers and in the  teachings of Tolstoy--it may quite well set itself in conflict with  national ideals, and dictate a line of conduct which is, from the  point of view of the State, immoral.    We need no further witness of the divorce between idealistic and  national morality than that which is supplied in the memorable  utterance of Bishop Magee, \"No state which was conducted on truly  Christian principles could hold together for a week.\"    And domestic morality will constantly come into conflict with public  morality.    To do everything in one's power to advance one's relatives and friends  irrespectively of all considerations of merit would, no doubt, be  quite sound domestic morality; it could, however, not always be  reconciled with public morality. In the same way, to take one's  country's part in all eventualities would be patriotic, but it might  quite well conflict with the higher interests of humanity.    Now, the point towards which we have been winning our way is that each  man's moral station and degree will be determined by the election  which he makes where egoism and altruism, and where a narrower and a  wider code of morality, conflict.    That the moral law forbids yielding to the promptings of egoism or to  those of the narrower moralities when this involves a violation of the  precepts of the wider morality is axiomatic. Criminal and anti-social  actions are not excused by the fact that motives which impelled their  commission were not purely egoistic.    But the ethical law demands more than abstention from definitely  anti-social actions. It demands from every individual that he shall  recognise the precepts of public morality as of superior obligation to  those of egoism and domestic morality.    By the fact that her public men recognised this ethical law Rome won  for herself in the ancient world spectacular grandeur. By an  unexampled national obedience to it glory has in our time accrued to  Japan. And, in truth, there is not anywhere any honour or renown but  such as comes from casting away the bonds of self and of the narrower  moralities to carry out the behests of the wider morality.    Even in the strongholds of transcendental religion where it was  axiomatic that morality began and was summed up in personal morality,  it is gradually coming to be recognised that, where we have two  competing moralities, it is always the wider morality which has the  prior claim upon our allegiance.    Kingsley's protest against the morality of \"saving one's dirty soul\"  marked a step in advance. And we find full recognition of the superior  claim of the larger morality in that other virile dictum of Bishop  Magee, \"I would rather have England free, than England sober.\" That  is, \"I would maintain the conditions which make for the highest  civilisation even at the price of a certain number of lapses in  personal and domestic morality.\"    What is here new, let it be noted, is only the acknowledgment by those  whose official allegiance is to a transcendental ideal of personal  morality that they are called upon to obey a higher allegiance. For  there has always existed, in the doctrine that guilty man could not be  pardoned and taken back into favour until the claims of eternal  justice had been satisfied, theoretical recognition of the principle  that one must conform to the precepts of abstract morality before one  may ethically indulge oneself in the lower moralities of philanthropy  and personal benevolence.    The view point from which I would propose to survey the morality of  woman has now been reached. It has, however, still to be pointed out  that we may appropriately, in comparing the morals of man and woman,  confine our survey to a comparatively narrow field. That is to say, we  may here rule out all that relates to purely personal and domestic  morality--for this is not relevant to the suffrage. And we may also  rule out all that relates to offences against the police laws--such as  public drunkenness and offences against the criminal law--for these  would come into consideration only in connexion with an absolutely  inappreciable fraction of voters.    It will be well to begin by signalising certain points in the moral  psychology of man.    When morality takes up its abode in a man who belongs to the  intellectual caste it will show itself in his becoming mindful of his  public obligations. He will consider the quality of his work as  affecting the interest of those who have to place dependence upon it;  behaviour to those who are casually brought into relations with him;  the discharge of his indebtedness to the community; and the proper  conduct of public affairs.    In particular, it will be to him a matter of concern that the law  shall be established upon classifications which are just (in the sense  of being conformable to public advantage); and that the laws shall  everywhere be justly, that is to say rigorously and impartially,  administered.    If we now turn to the man in the street we shall not find him  especially sensible to the appeals of morality. But when the special  call comes it will generally be possible to trust him: as an elector,  to vote uninfluenced by considerations of private advantage; and, when  called to serve on a jury, to apply legal classifications without  distinction of person.    Furthermore, in all times of crisis he may be counted upon to apply  the principles of communal morality which have been handed down in the  race.    The _Titanic_ disaster, for example, showed in a conspicuous manner  that the ordinary man will, \"letting his own life go,\" obey the  communal law which lays it upon him, when involved in a catastrophe,  to save first the women and children.    Lastly, we come to the man who is intolerant of all the ordinary  restraints of personal and domestic morality. Even in him the seeds of  communal morality will often be found deeply implanted.    Time and again a regiment of scallawags, who have let all other  morality go hang, have, when the proper chord has been made to vibrate  in them, heard the call of communal morality, and done deeds which  make the ears of whosoever heareth of them to tingle.    We come into an entirely different land when we come to the morality  of woman. It is personal and domestic, not public, morality which is  instinctive in her.    In other words, when egoism gives ground to altruism, that altruism is  exercised towards those who are linked up to her by a bond of sexual  affection, or a community in blood, or failing this, by a relation of  personal friendship, or by some other personal relation.    And even when altruism has had her perfect work, woman feels no  interest in, and no responsibility towards, any abstract moral ideal.    And though the suffragist may protest, instancing in disproof of this  her own burning enthusiasm for justice, we, for our part, may  legitimately ask whether evidence of a moral enthusiasm for justice  would be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51854"],[0,"The Rat Race (#9)"],[1," He nearly caught me. Signing checks was something I simply could not do  until I had learned to imitate Winnie Tompkins' signature. I had tried  in the guest-room at Bedford Hills, the previous evening, and found  that my original signature as Frank E. Jacklin was completely unchanged  by my transmigration, and that my own copy-desk scrawl was the only  handwriting I could commit. I had burned the note-paper on which I had  made the crucial experiments and flushed the ashes down the toilet. One  of my objects in coming to the Pond had been to see if I couldn't get  money by simply initialing a chit.    I hastily looked in my bill-fold. There was still a fair amount of  money left. It would last me until I found a way to draw on Winnie's  bank-account.    \"Never mind, after all,\" I told Tammy. \"I guess I have enough to last  me until I get down to the office. If anybody asks for me, you haven't  seen me since Monday and don't know where I am.\"    \"Very good, sir,\" he agreed. \"I'll take any messages that come for you,  sir, and not let on I've set eyes on you.\"    My next stop was at an old hang-out of mine and Dorothy's from my  early newspaper days: a place on East 53rd Street, where you can get  a good meal if you have the money to pay for it and the time to wait  for it--and I had both. I knew that none of Winnie's friends would be  seen dead in the place and I didn't want to try lunch at the Harvard  Club, where I'd have to sign the dining-room order or the bar-check.  The place was reasonably uncrowded--it was not quite noon--and I had a  pleasant lunch.    It was a little after one o'clock when I reached the Harvard Club. The  door-man glanced at my face and automatically stuck a little ivory  peg in the hole opposite the name of Tompkins on the list of members.  I checked my hat and coat and strolled through the sitting-rooms into  the large lounge-library beside the dining-room. A couple of men  nodded and smiled as I passed them, so I nodded back and said, \"Hi!\"  in a conversational tone. In the lounge I found a chair and a copy  of the World-Telegram, so I decided to catch up with the war-news.  The German Armies were beginning to crumble but there was still talk  of a stand along the Elbe and Hitler was reported fortifying the  mountain-districts of Southern Germany into a redoubt for a last  Valhalla Battle. The Pacific news was good. The fighting on Okinawa was  going our way and the clean-up in the Philippines was well in hand. The  Navy Department discounted enemy reports of heavy damage to American  warships by Jap suicide-pilots but, as an old Navy P.R.O., I could tell  that it had been plenty. I'd heard about the Kamikazes from some of our  pilots who had seen them off Leyte and I had no doubt that they were  doing a job on the 7th Fleet. Roosevelt had gone South for a couple of  weeks rest at Warm Springs, Georgia, and Ed Stettinius was in the final  throes of organizing the United Nations Conference at San Francisco--    \"Hi, Winnie? Don't you speak to your old friends any more?\"    I looked up to see a lean, wolfish-looking man, with a gray moustache,  a slightly bald head and definitely Bond Street clothes.    \"Oh, hullo!\" I said and returned to reading the paper.    The newspaper was firmly taken out of my hands and the man sat down  beside me.    \"We've got to have a talk,\" he said.    \"Why? What's happened?\"    \"There's been a lot of talk about you running around town in the last  twenty-four hours, Winnie. None of the other alleged friends we know  had the guts to tell you. But I thought your room-mate--\"    \"So you're Merry Vail,\" I said stupidly.    \"You're in worse shape than I thought you were, Winnie,\" he replied.  \"Yes, I'm Merriwether Vail who started his life-long career of rescuing  Winfred Tompkins from blondes and booze at Harvard in 1916. Now, if  you'll just crawl out of your alcoholic coma and listen to me for five  minutes before you take off for your next skirt, you'll learn something  to your advantage.\"    \"How about a drink, Merry?\" I asked, to keep in character.    \"Not before five, so help me, and you'd better lay off liquor till you  hear this. Here it is. There's a story going the rounds that the F.B.I.  is after you. At any rate, at least one obvious G-man has been reported  in full cry on your foot-prints.\"    I sat up, startled. This was too much, even for purgatory. What _had_  Winnie been up to?    \"What am I supposed to have done, Merry?\" I asked. \"Trifled with the  Mann Act? Told fibs on my income tax return? Failed to notify the local  draft board that I was taking the train to New York? Bought black  market nylons for my mistress? or what?\"    Vail looked mysterious. \"For all I know I may be letting myself in  for Alcatraz, old man, but the dope is that you've been violating the  Espionage Act, communicating with the enemy, or stealing official  secrets.\"    I leaned back in my chair and shook with laughter. \"Of all the pure,  unadulterated b.s. I've ever heard! I give you my word of honor as a  Porcellian that there's not a syllable of truth in it.\"    Vail looked increasingly distressed. \"If you're really innocent, you'd  better be careful. Ten-to-one you haven't an alibi, and you'll need  a lawyer. Slip me a bill now and retain me as your counsel. No, this  isn't a gag. Something's cooking, even if it's only mistaken identity,  and I've seen enough of the law in war-time to know that you'll be  better off with the old cry, 'I demand to see my attorney,' when they  march you down to the F.B.I. headquarters to answer a few questions.\"    \"Thanks, Merry,\" I said, \"and here's twenty bucks to go on with. If  the police are looking for me, I'd better go down to my office and see  that things are apple-pie before they lock up the brains of our outfit.    \"Besides,\" I added, \"you've just given me an idea of how I can make a  hell of a lot of money.\"          CHAPTER 7      Tompkins, Wasson & Cone maintained sincere-looking offices on one  of the upper floors of No. 1 Wall Street. The rooms were carefully  furnished in dark wood and turkey-red upholstery, in a style calculated  to reassure elderly ladies of great wealth that the firm was careful  and conservative.    The girl at the reception desk looked as though she had graduated with  honor from Wellesley in the class of 1920 and still had it--pince-nez  and condescension--but she was thoroughly up-to-date in her  office-technique.    \"Oh, Mr. Tompkins,\" she murmured in a clear, low voice, \"there's a  gentleman waiting to see you in the customer's room, a Mr. Harcourt.  He's been here since ten o'clock this morning.\"    \"He's had no lunch?\" I inquired.    She shook her head.    I clucked my tongue. \"We can't have our customers starve to death, can  we? Send out for a club sandwich and some hot coffee. Give me five  minutes to take a look at my mail and then send him in. When the food  arrives, send that in, too.\"    She blinked her hazel eyes behind her pince-nez to show that she  understood, and I walked confidently down to the end of the corridor to  where a \"Mr. Tompkins\" stared at me conservatively from a glazed door.    My office lived up to my fondest dream of Winnie. It was an ingenious  blend of the 1870's and functional furniture--like a cocktail of port  wine and vodka. There were electric clocks, a silenced stock-ticker  in a glass-covered mahogany coffin, an elaborate Sheraton radio  with short-wave reception, tuned in on WQXR, and desks and chairs  and divans and a really good steel engraving showing General Grant  receiving Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House, with a chart  underneath to explain who was who in the picture.    The desk I was glad to note, was bare except for an electric  clock-calendar which told me that it was 3:12 p.m. of April 4, 1945,  and a handsome combination humidor, cigarette case and automatic  lighter in aluminum and synthetic tortoise-shell. A glance out the  window gave me a reassuring glimpse of the spire of Trinity Church.  There was a single typed memo on the glass top of the desk, which read:  \"Mr. Harcourt, 10:13 a.m. Would not state business. Will wait.\"    I pushed one of the array of buttons concealed underneath the edge of  the desk and a door opened to admit a largish blonde in a tight-fitting  sweater.    \"Yes, Mr. Tompkins?\"    \"Please have Mr. Harcourt sent in,\" I said, \"And when he comes, bring  your notebook and take a stenographic record of our conversation  and--er--what's your name?\"    She raised her well-plucked eyebrows. \"I'm Eleanor Roosevelt, my  parents named me Arthurjean--after both of them--Arthurjean--Miss  Briggs to you!\"    \"Very well, Miss Briggs, tell Mr. Harcourt I'll see him now.\"    A moment later, she reappeared holding a card in her fingers as though  it was a live cockroach. \"Sure you want to see this?\" she asked.    The card read: \"Mr. A. J. Harcourt, Special Agent. Federal Bureau of  Investigation, U. S. Department of Justice, U. S. Court House, Foley  Square, New York 23, N. Y.\"    \"Of course,\" I replied, \"I've been expecting him for some time.\"    A. J. Harcourt was neat but not gaudy: a clean-cut, Hart, Shaffner and  Marx tailored man of about thirty-five, with that indefinable family  resemblance to J. Edgar Hoover which always worries me about the F.B.I.    \"Good afternoon, Mr. Harcourt,\" I said pleasantly, \"and what can I do  for the F.B.I.?\"    Harcourt shook my hand, took a seat, refused a cigarette and cast a  doubtful glance over his shoulder at Arthurjean Briggs, who was working  semi-silently away at a stenotype machine.    \"Oh, that's my secretary,\" I explained. \"I always have her take a  record of important conversations in this office. I hope the machine  doesn't disturb you, Mr. Harcourt.\"    \"If it's all right with you it's all right with me,\" he said  grudgingly. \"I thought perhaps you'd rather have this private.\"    \"Not in the least,\" I replied. \"Miss Briggs is the soul of discretion  and I can"]]]
