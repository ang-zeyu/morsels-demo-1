The only thing whose  existence we deny IS THAT WHICH PHILOSOPHERS CALL MATTER or corporeal  substance. And in doing of this there is no damage done to the rest  of mankind, who, I dare say, will never miss it. The Atheist indeed  will want the colour of an empty name to support his impiety; and  the Philosophers may possibly find they have lost a great handle for  trifling and disputation.    36. READILY EXPLAINED.--If any man thinks this detracts from the existence  or reality of things, he is very far from understanding what has been  premised in the plainest terms I could think of. Take here an  abstract of what has been said:--There are spiritual substances,  minds, or human souls, which will or excite ideas in themselves at  pleasure; but these are faint, weak, and unsteady in respect of  others they perceive by sense--which, being impressed upon them  according to certain rules or laws of nature, speak themselves the  effects of a mind more powerful and wise than human spirits. These  latter are said to have more REALITY in them than the former:--by  which is meant that they are more affecting, orderly, and distinct,  and that they are not fictions of the mind perceiving them. And  in this sense the sun that I see by day is the real sun, and that which I  imagine by night is the idea of the former. In the sense here given of  REALITY it is evident that every vegetable, star, mineral, and in general  each part of the mundane system, is as much a REAL BEING by our  principles as by any other. Whether others mean anything by the term  REALITY different from what I do, I entreat them to look into their own  thoughts and see.    37. THE PHILOSOPHIC, NOT THE VULGAR SUBSTANCE, TAKEN AWAY.--I will  be urged that thus much at least is true, to wit, that we take  away all corporeal substances. To this my answer is, that if the word  SUBSTANCE be taken in the vulgar sense--for a combination of sensible  qualities, such as extension, solidity, weight, and the like--this we  cannot be accused of taking away: but if it be taken in a philosophic  sense--for the SUPPORT of accidents or QUALITIES WITHOUT THE MIND--then  indeed I acknowledge that we take it away, if one may be said to take  away that which never had any existence, not even in the imagination.    38. But, say you, it sounds very harsh to say we eat and drink  ideas, and are clothed with ideas. I acknowledge it does so--the word  IDEA not being used in common discourse to signify the several  combinations of sensible qualities which are called THINGS; and it is  certain that any expression which varies from the familiar use of  language will seem harsh and ridiculous. But this doth not concern the  truth of the proposition, which in other words is no more than to say, we  are fed and clothed with those things which we perceive immediately by  our senses. The hardness or softness, the colour, taste, warmth, figure,  or suchlike qualities, which combined together constitute the several  sorts of victuals and apparel, have been shown to exist only in the mind  that perceives them; and this is all that is meant by calling them IDEAS;  which word if it was as ordinarily used as THING, would sound no harsher  nor more ridiculous than it. I am not for disputing about the propriety,  but the truth of the expression. If therefore you agree with me that we  eat and drink and are clad with the immediate objects of sense, which  cannot exist unperceived or without the mind, I shall readily grant it is  more proper or conformable to custom that they should be called things  rather than ideas.    39. THE TERM IDEA PREFERABLE TO THING.--If it be demanded why I make  use of the word IDEA, and do not rather in compliance with custom  call them THINGS. I answer, I do it for two reasons:--first, because  the term THING in contra-distinction to IDEA, is generally supposed  to denote somewhat existing without the mind; secondly, because  THING has a more comprehensive signification than IDEA, including  SPIRIT or thinking things as well as IDEAS. Since therefore the  objects of sense exist only in the mind, and are withal thoughtless  and inactive, I chose to mark them by the word IDEA, which implies  those properties.    40. THE EVIDENCE OF THE SENSES NOT DISCREDITED.--But, say what we can,  some one perhaps may be apt to reply, he will still believe his  senses, and never suffer any arguments, how plausible soever,  to prevail over the certainty of them. Be it so; assert the evidence  of sense as high as you please, we are willing to do the same.  That what I see, hear, and feel DOTH EXIST, THAT IS to say, IS PERCEIVED  BY ME, I no more doubt than I do of my own being. But I do not see how  the testimony of sense can be alleged as a proof for the existence of  anything which is not perceived by sense. We are not for having any man  turn SCEPTIC and disbelieve his senses; on the contrary, we give them all  the stress and assurance imaginable; nor are there any principles more  opposite to Scepticism than those we have laid down [Note.], as shall be  hereafter clearly shown.    [Note: They extirpate the very root of scepticism, \"the fallacy  of the senses.\"--Ed.]    41. SECOND OBJECTION.--ANSWER.--Secondly, it will be OBJECTED  that there is a great difference betwixt real fire for instance,  and the idea of fire, betwixt dreaming or imagining oneself burnt,  and actually being so: if you suspect it to be only the idea of  fire which you see, do but put your hand into it and you will be  convinced with a witness. This and the like may be urged in opposition  to our tenets. To all which the ANSWER is evident from what has  been already said; and I shall only add in this place, that if real  fire be very different from the idea of fire, so also is the real pain  that it occasions very different from the idea of the same pain, and yet  nobody will pretend that real pain either is, or can possibly be, in an  unperceiving thing, or without the mind, any more than its idea.    42. THIRD OBJECTION.--ANSWER.--Thirdly, it will be objected that  we see things actually without or at distance from us, and which  consequently do not exist in the mind; it being absurd that those  things which are seen at the distance of several miles should be  as near to us as our own thoughts. In answer to this, I desire it  may be considered that in a DREAM we do oft perceive things as  existing at a great distance off, and yet for all that, those things  are acknowledged to have their existence only in the mind.    43. But, for the fuller clearing of this point, it may be worth while to  consider how it is that we perceive distance and things placed at a  distance by sight. For, that we should in truth see EXTERNAL space, and  bodies actually existing in it, some nearer, others farther off, seems to  carry with it some opposition to what has been said of their existing  nowhere without the mind. The consideration of this difficulty it was  that gave birth to my \"Essay towards a New Theory of Vision,\" which was  published not long since, wherein it is shown (1) that DISTANCE or outness  is NEITHER IMMEDIATELY of itself PERCEIVED by sight, nor yet apprehended  or judged of by lines and angles, or anything that has a necessary  connexion with it; but (2) that it is ONLY SUGGESTED to our thoughts by  certain visible ideas and sensations attending vision, which in their own  nature have no manner of similitude or relation either with distance or  things placed at a distance; but, by a connexion taught us BY EXPERIENCE,  they come to signify and suggest them to us, after the same manner that  WORDS of any language suggest the ideas they are made to stand for;  insomuch that a man BORN blind and afterwards made to see, would not, at  first sight, think the things he saw to be without his mind, or at any  distance from him. See sect. 41 of the fore-mentioned treatise.    44. The ideas of sight and touch make two species entirely distinct and  heterogeneous. THE FORMER ARE MARKS AND PROGNOSTICS OF THE LATTER. That  the proper objects of sight neither exist without mind, nor are the  images of external things, was shown even in that treatise. Though  throughout the same the contrary be supposed true of tangible  objects--not that to suppose that vulgar error was necessary for  establishing the notion therein laid down, but because it was beside my  purpose to examine and refute it in a discourse concerning VISION. So  that in strict truth the ideas of sight, when we apprehend by them  distance and things placed at a distance, do not suggest or mark out to  us things ACTUALLY existing at a distance, but only admonish us what  ideas of touch will be imprinted in our minds at such and such distances  of time, and in consequence of such or such actions. It is, I say,  evident from what has been said in the foregoing parts of this Treatise,  and in sect. 147 and elsewhere of the Essay concerning Vision, that  visible ideas are the Language whereby the governing Spirit on whom we  depend informs us what tangible ideas he is about to imprint upon us, in  case we excite this or that motion in our own bodies. But for a fuller  information in this point I refer to the Essay itself.    45. FOURTH OBJECTION, FROM PERPETUAL ANNIHILATION AND  CREATION.--ANSWER.--Fourthly, it will be objected that from the foregoing  principles it follows things are every moment annihilated and created  anew. The objects of sense exist only when they are perceived; the trees  therefore are in the garden, or the chairs in the parlour, no longer than  while there is somebody by to perceive them. Upon SHUTTING MY EYES all  the furniture in the room is reduced to nothing, and barely upon opening  them it is again created. In ANSWER to all which, I refer the reader to  what has been said in sect. 3, 4, &c., and desire he will consider  whether he means anything "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4724"],[0,"Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous in Opposition to Sceptics and (#9)"],[1,"to right reason? Truth and  beauty are in this alike, that the strictest survey sets them both off to  advantage; while the false lustre of error and disguise cannot endure  being reviewed, or too nearly inspected.    HYL.  I own there is a great deal in what you say. Nor can any one be  more entirely satisfied of the truth of those odd consequences, so long  as I have in view the reasonings that lead to them. But, when these are  out of my thoughts, there seems, on the other hand, something so  satisfactory, so natural and intelligible, in the modern way of  explaining things that, I profess, I know not how to reject it.    PHIL.  I know not what way you mean.    HYL.  I mean the way of accounting for our sensations or ideas.    PHIL.  How is that?    HYL.  It is supposed the soul makes her residence in some part of the  brain, from which the nerves take their rise, and are thence extended to  all parts of the body; and that outward objects, by the different  impressions they make on the organs of sense, communicate certain  vibrative motions to the nerves; and these being filled with spirits  propagate them to the brain or seat of the soul, which, according  to the various impressions or traces thereby made in the brain, is  variously affected with ideas.    PHIL.  And call you this an explication of the manner whereby we are  affected with ideas?    HYL.  Why not, Philonous? Have you anything to object against it?    PHIL.  I would first know whether I rightly understand your hypothesis.  You make certain traces in the brain to be the causes or occasions of our  ideas. Pray tell me whether by the BRAIN you mean any sensible thing.    HYL.  What else think you I could mean?    PHIL.  Sensible things are all immediately perceivable; and those things  which are immediately perceivable are ideas; and these exist only in the  mind. Thus much you have, if I mistake not, long since agreed to.    HYL.  I do not deny it.    PHIL.  The brain therefore you speak of, being a sensible thing, exists  only in the mind. Now, I would fain know whether you think it reasonable  to suppose that one idea or thing existing in the mind occasions all  other ideas. And, if you think so, pray how do you account for the origin  of that primary idea or brain itself?    HYL.  I do not explain the origin of our ideas by that brain which is  perceivable to sense--this being itself only a combination of sensible  ideas--but by another which I imagine.    PHIL.  But are not things imagined as truly IN THE MIND as things  perceived?    HYL.  I must confess they are.    PHIL.  It comes, therefore, to the same thing; and you have been all  this while accounting for ideas by certain motions or impressions of the  brain; that is, by some alterations in an idea, whether sensible or  imaginable it matters not.    HYL.  I begin to suspect my hypothesis.    PHIL.  Besides spirits, all that we know or conceive are our own ideas.  When, therefore, you say all ideas are occasioned by impressions in the  brain, do you conceive this brain or no? If you do, then you talk of  ideas imprinted in an idea causing that same idea, which is absurd. If  you do not conceive it, you talk unintelligibly, instead of forming a  reasonable hypothesis.    HYL.  I now clearly see it was a mere dream. There is nothing in it.    PHIL.  You need not be much concerned at it; for after all, this way of  explaining things, as you called it, could never have satisfied any  reasonable man. What connexion is there between a motion in the nerves,  and the sensations of sound or colour in the mind? Or how is it possible  these should be the effect of that?    HYL.  But I could never think it had so little in it as now it seems to  have.    PHIL.  Well then, are you at length satisfied that no sensible things  have a real existence; and that you are in truth an arrant sceptic?    HYL.  It is too plain to be denied.    PHIL.  Look! are not the fields covered with a delightful verdure? Is  there not something in the woods and groves, in the rivers and clear  springs, that soothes, that delights, that transports the soul? At the  prospect of the wide and deep ocean, or some huge mountain whose top is  lost in the clouds, or of an old gloomy forest, are not our minds filled  with a pleasing horror? Even in rocks and deserts is there not an  agreeable wildness? How sincere a pleasure is it to behold the natural  beauties of the earth! To preserve and renew our relish for them, is not  the veil of night alternately drawn over her face, and doth she not  change her dress with the seasons? How aptly are the elements disposed!  What variety and use in the meanest productions of nature! What  delicacy, what beauty, what contrivance, in animal and vegetable bodies I  How exquisitely are all things suited, as well to their particular ends,  as to constitute opposite parts of the whole I And, while they mutually  aid and support, do they not also set off and illustrate each other?  Raise now your thoughts from this ball of earth to all those glorious  luminaries that adorn the high arch of heaven. The motion and situation  of the planets, are they not admirable for use and order? Were those  (miscalled ERRATIC) globes once known to stray, in their repeated  journeys through the pathless void? Do they not measure areas round the  sun ever proportioned to the times? So fixed, so immutable are the laws  by which the unseen Author of nature actuates the universe. How  vivid and radiant is the lustre of the fixed stars! How magnificent and  rich that negligent profusion with which they appear to be scattered  throughout the whole azure vault! Yet, if you take the telescope, it  brings into your sight a new host of stars that escape the naked eye.  Here they seem contiguous and minute, but to a nearer view immense orbs  of fight at various distances, far sunk in the abyss of space. Now you  must call imagination to your aid. The feeble narrow sense cannot descry  innumerable worlds revolving round the central fires; and in those worlds  the energy of an all-perfect Mind displayed in endless forms. But,  neither sense nor imagination are big enough to comprehend the boundless  extent, with all its glittering furniture. Though the labouring mind  exert and strain each power to its utmost reach, there still stands out  ungrasped a surplusage immeasurable. Yet all the vast bodies that compose  this mighty frame, how distant and remote soever, are by some secret  mechanism, some Divine art and force, linked in a mutual dependence and  intercourse with each other; even with this earth, which was almost slipt  from my thoughts and lost in the crowd of worlds. Is not the whole system  immense, beautiful, glorious beyond expression and beyond thought! What  treatment, then, do those philosophers deserve, who would deprive these  noble and delightful scenes of all REALITY? How should those Principles  be entertained that lead us to think all the visible beauty of the  creation a false imaginary glare? To be plain, can you expect this  Scepticism of yours will not be thought extravagantly absurd by all men  of sense?    HYL.  Other men may think as they please; but for your part you have  nothing to reproach me with. My comfort is, you are as much a sceptic as  I am.    PHIL.  There, Hylas, I must beg leave to differ from you.    HYL.  What! Have you all along agreed to the premises, and do you now  deny the conclusion, and leave me to maintain those paradoxes by myself  which you led me into? This surely is not fair.    PHIL.  _I_ deny that I agreed with you in those notions that led to  Scepticism. You indeed said the REALITY of sensible things consisted in  AN ABSOLUTE EXISTENCE OUT OF THE MINDS OF SPIRITS, or distinct from  their being perceived. And pursuant to this notion of reality, YOU are  obliged to deny sensible things any real existence: that is,  according to your own definition, you profess yourself a sceptic. But I  neither said nor thought the reality of sensible things was to be defined  after that manner. To me it is evident for the reasons you allow of, that  sensible things cannot exist otherwise than in a mind or spirit. Whence I  conclude, not that they have no real existence, but that, seeing they  depend not on my thought, and have all existence distinct from being  perceived by me, THERE MUST BE SOME OTHER MIND WHEREIN THEY EXIST. As  sure, therefore, as the sensible world really exists, so sure is there an  infinite omnipresent Spirit who contains and supports it.    HYL.  What! This is no more than I and all Christians hold; nay, and all  others too who believe there is a God, and that He knows and comprehends  all things.    PHIL.  Aye, but here lies the difference. Men commonly believe that all  things are known or perceived by God, because they believe the being of a  God; whereas I, on the other side, immediately and necessarily conclude  the being of a God, because all sensible things must be perceived by Him.    HYL.  But, so long as we all believe the same thing, what matter is it  how we come by that belief?    PHIL.  But neither do we agree in the same opinion. For philosophers,  though they acknowledge all corporeal beings to be perceived by God, yet  they attribute to them an absolute subsistence distinct from their being  perceived by any mind whatever; which I do not. Besides, is there no  difference between saying, THERE IS A GOD, THEREFORE HE PERCEIVES ALL  THINGS; and saying, SENSIBLE THINGS DO REALLY EXIST; AND, IF THEY  REALLY EXIST, THEY ARE NECESSARILY PERCEIVED BY AN INFINITE MIND:  THEREFORE THERE IS AN INFINITE MIND OR GOD? This furnishes you with a  direct and immediate demonstration, from a most evident principle, of the  BEING OF A GOD. Divines and philosophers had proved beyond all  controversy, from the beauty and usefulness of the several parts of the  creation, that it was the workmanship of God.
