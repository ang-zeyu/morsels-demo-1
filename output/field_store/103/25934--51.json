Why, how came that about?      DIO. He threw a river in, like some wool-seller    Wetting his wool, to make it weight the more.    But _you_ threw in a light and winged word.      EUR. Come, let him match another verse with mine.      DIO. Each to his scale.      AESCH. EUR. We're ready.      DIO. Speak your lines.      EUR. _Persuasion's only shrine is eloquent speech._      AESCH. _Death loves not gifts, alone amongst the gods_      DIO. Let go, let go. Down goes his scale again. He threw in Death, the    heaviest ill of all.      EUR. And I Persuasion, the most lovely word.      DIO. A vain and empty sound, devoid of sense.    Think of some heavier-weighted line of yours,    To drag your scale down: something strong and big.      EUR. Where have I got one? Where? Let's see.      DIO. I'll tell you. _\"Achilles threw two singles and a four_.\"    Come, speak your lines: this is your last set-to.      EUR. _In his right hand he grasped an iron-clamped mace_.      AESCH. _Chariot on chariot, corpse on corpse was hurled_.      DIO. There now! again he has done you.      EUR. Done me? How?      DIO. He threw two chariots and two corpses in;    Five-score Egyptians could not lift that weight.      AESCH. No more of \"line for line\"; let him--himself,    His children, wife, Cephisophon--get in,    With all his books collected in his arms,    Two lines of mine shall overweigh the lot.      DIO. Both are my friends; I can't decide between them:    I don't desire to be at odds with either:    One is so clever, one delights me so.      PLUTO. Then you'll effect nothing for which you came?      DIO. And how, if I decide?      PLUTO. Then take the winner;    So will your journey not be made in vain.      DIO. Heaven bless your Highness! Listen, I came down    After a poet.      EUR. To what end?      DIO. That so The city, saved, may keep her choral games.    Now then, whichever of you two shall best    Advise the city, _he_ shall come with me.    And first of Alcibiades, let each    Say what he thinks; the city travails sore.      EUR. What does she think herself about him?      DIO. What? She loves, and hates, and longs to have him back.    But give me _your_ advice about the man.      EUR. I loathe a townsman who is slow to aid,    And swift to hurt, his town: who ways and means    Finds for himself, but finds not for the state.      DIO. Poseidon, but that's smart! (_To Aesch_.) And what say _you?_      AESCH. 'Twere best to rear no lion in the state:    But having reared, 'tis best to humour him.      DIO. By Zeus the Saviour, still I can't decide.    One is so clever, and so clear the other.    But once again. Let each in turn declare    What plan of safety for the state ye've got.      EUR. [First with Cinesias wing Cleocritus,    Then zephyrs waft them o'er the watery plain.      DIO. A funny sight, I own: but where's the sense?      EUR. If, when the fleets engage, they holding cruets    Should rain down vinegar in the foemen's eyes,]    I know, and I can tell you.      DIO. Tell away.      EUR. When things, mistrusted now, shall trusted be,    And trusted things, mistrusted.      DIO. How! I don't quite comprehend.    Be clear, and not so clever.      EUR. If we mistrust those citizens of ours    Whom now we trust, and those employ whom now    We don't employ, the city will be saved.    If on our present tack we fail, we surely    Shall find salvation in the opposite course.      DIO. Good, O Palamedes! Good, you genius you. [Is this _your_    cleverness or Cephisophon's?      EUR. This is my own: the cruet-plan was his.]      DIO. (_To Aesch._) Now, you.      AESCH. But tell me whom the city uses. The good and useful?      DIO. What are you dreaming of? She hates and loathes them.      AESCH. Does she love the bad?      DIO. Not love them, no: she uses them perforce.      AESCH. How can one save a city such as this,    Whom neither frieze nor woollen tunic suits?      DIO. O, if to earth you rise, find out some way.      AESCH. There will I speak: I cannot answer here.      DIO. Nay, nay; send up your guerdon from below.      AESCH. When they shall count the enemy's soil their own,    And theirs the enemy's: when they know that ships    Are their true wealth, their so-called wealth delusion.      DIO. Aye, but the justices suck that down, you know.      PLUTO. Now then, decide.      DIO. I will; and thus I'll do it. I'll choose the man in whom my soul    delights.      EUR. O, recollect the gods by whom you swore    You'd take me home again; and choose your friends.      DIO. 'Twas my tongue swore; my choice is--Aeschylus.      EUR. Hah! what have you done?      DIO. Done? Given the victor's prize    To Aeschylus; why not?      EUR. And do you dare look in my face, after that shameful deed?      DIO. What's shameful, if the audience think not so?      EUR. Have you no heart? Wretch; would you leave me dead?      DIO. Who knows if death be life, and life be death, And breath be    mutton broth, and sleep a sheepskin?      PLUTO. Now, Dionysus, come ye in.      DIO. What for?      PLUTO. And sup before ye go.      DIO. A bright idea. I' faith, I'm nowise indisposed for that.        CHOR. Blest the man who possesses a      Keen intelligent mind.      This full often we find.      He, the bard of renown,      Now to earth reascends,      Goes, a joy to his town,      Goes, a joy to his friends,      Just because he possesses a      Keen intelligent mind.      RIGHT it is and befitting,      Not by Socrates sitting,      Idle talk to pursue,      Stripping tragedy-art of      All things noble and true,      Surely the mind to school      Fine-drawn quibbles to seek,      Fine-set phrases to speak,      Is but the part of a fool!      PLUTO. Farewell then, Aeschylus, great and wise,    Go, save our state by the maxims rare    Of thy noble thought; and the fools chastise,      For many a fool dwells there.    And _this_ to Cleophon give, my friend,    And _this_ to the revenue-raising crew,    Nicomachus, Myrmex, next I send,    And _this_ to Archenomus too.    And bid them all that without delay,    To my realm of the dead they hasten away.    For if they loiter above, I swear    I'll come myself and arrest them there.    And branded and fettered the slaves shall go    With the vilest rascal in all the town,    Adeimantus, son of Leucolophus, down,    Down, down to the darkness below.      AESCH. I take the mission. This chair of mine    Meanwhile to Sophocles here commit,    (For I count him next in our craft divine,)    Till I come once more by thy side to sit.    But as for that rascally scoundrel there,    That low buffoon, that worker of ill,    O let him not sit in my vacant chair,    Not even against his will.      PLUTO. (To the Chorus.) Escort him up with your mystic throngs,    While the holy torches quiver and blaze.    Escort him up with his own sweet songs and his noble festival lays.      CHOR. First, as the poet triumphant is passing away to the light,    Grant him success on his journey, ye powers that are ruling below.    Grant that he find for the city good counsels to guide her aright;    So we at last shall be freed from the anguish, the fear, and the woe,    Freed from the onsets of war. Let Cleophon now and his band    Battle, if battle they must, far away in their own fatherland."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7999"],[0,"The Bible, King James Version, Complete Contents (#9)"],[1,"023:002 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land  of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.    01:023:003 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the  sons of Heth, saying,    01:023:004 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a  possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my  sight.    01:023:005 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,    01:023:006 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the  choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from  thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.    01:023:007 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the  land, even to the children of Heth.    01:023:008 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I  should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to  Ephron the son of Zohar,    01:023:009 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath,  which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he  shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.    01:023:010 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the  Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even  of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,    01:023:011 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave  that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my  people give I it thee: bury thy dead.    01:023:012 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.    01:023:013 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the  land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will  give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead  there.    01:023:014 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,    01:023:015 My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred  shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy  dead.    01:023:016 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to  Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of  Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.    01:023:017 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was  before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the  trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about,  were made sure    01:023:018 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children  of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.    01:023:019 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of  the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of  Canaan.    01:023:020 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure  unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.    01:024:001 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD  had blessed Abraham in all things.    01:024:002 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that  ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:    01:024:003 And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven,  and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of  the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:    01:024:004 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and  take a wife unto my son Isaac.    01:024:005 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will  not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son  again unto the land from whence thou camest?    01:024:006 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my  son thither again.    01:024:007 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house,  and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware  unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his  angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.    01:024:008 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then  thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither  again.    01:024:009 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his  master, and sware to him concerning that matter.    01:024:010 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master,  and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he  arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.    01:024:011 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a  well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go  out to draw water.    01:024:012 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee,  send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.    01:024:013 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters  of the men of the city come out to draw water:    01:024:014 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say,  Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say,  Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that  thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that  thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.    01:024:015 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that,  behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the  wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.    01:024:016 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither  had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her  pitcher, and came up.    01:024:017 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray  thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.    01:024:018 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down  her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.    01:024:019 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw  water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.    01:024:020 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and  ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.    01:024:021 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether  the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.    01:024:022 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that  the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets  for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;    01:024:023 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is  there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?    01:024:024 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son  of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.    01:024:025 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender  enough, and room to lodge in.    01:024:026 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.    01:024:027 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham,  who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I  being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.    01:024:028 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these  things.    01:024:029 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban  ran out unto the man, unto the well.    01:024:030 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets  upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his  sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man;  and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.    01:024:031 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore  standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the  camels.    01:024:032 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels,  and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet,  and the men's feet that were with him.    01:024:033 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will  not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.    01:024:034 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.    01:024:035 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become  great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold,  and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.    01:024:036 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she  was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.    01:024:037 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a  wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I  dwell:    01:024:038 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred,  and take a wife unto my son.    01:024:039 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not  follow me.    01:024:040 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send  his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for  my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:    01:024:041 Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest  to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from  my oath.    01:024:042 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my  master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:    01:024:043 Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to  pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her,  Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;    01:024:044 And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for  thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out  for my master's son.    01:024:045 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah  came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the  well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.    01:024:046 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her  shoulder,"]]]
