Vol. 1 (of 3) (#9)"],[1,"of Heaven in music, and\"--    \"Captain Egerton,\" cried Miss Vernon, holding up a menacing finger,  \"are you taking that renegade's part?\"    \"Far from it, Miss Vernon; no art can surpass music in my estimation;  but as to the lives of its professors, there is, alas! no mistake.\"    \"I was a member of the Beefsteak Club in Dublin,\" said the Colonel; \"we  used to begin our evenings with the most divine duets and trios, glees  and choruses, &c.; but towards the end, earth assumed the ascendant,  and so great was its attraction, that by far the greater number of us  were generally floored before the finale.\"    \"But,\" said Winter, with a slightly contemptuous look, \"I do not speak  of mere performers, I mean composers, creators, men of genius!\"    \"_They_ surely were men of good report, at least,\" began Miss Vernon.    \"Miss Kate, if you please,\" said Nurse, looking in, \"little Mr. Gilpin  wants to spake to you.\"    \"Oh, show him in, Nurse; say Grandpapa particularly wishes to speak to  him.\"    The Colonel rose, and advanced a step or two towards the door, through  which entered a little man, deformed and slightly lame, with the pale  angular face usual in deformed persons, a pair of deep set vivid dark  eyes, and a certain mild sad expression, which conveyed itself to you  at once--though it could not be said to strike you--and saved him from  the appearance of utter ugliness. He came forward with an uncertain  timid manner, holding a broad dusky-looking book. The Colonel shook  his hand with an air of extreme cordiality and high-bred respect,  exclaiming, \"We had almost given you up.\" Miss Vernon, who had also  risen, now greeted him. \"Did you not get my message, Mr. Gilpin? I  called at your house to-day to beg you would join us this evening.\"    \"No,\" said a remarkably rich soft voice, \"none was given to me. I came  here to show you a treasure I lately discovered in an old chest in the  Chapter house,\" and he handed her the book.    Miss Vernon opened it with looks and exclamations of delight, and  Winter joined the group.    I was left seated with his wife, the only member of the party who had  not risen to greet the new comer. I turned an enquiring glance towards  her, to which she answered, in a low tone, \"Mr. Gilpin, the Organist of  the Priory Church; he is an excellent musician, and a great favorite  with the Colonel and Miss Vernon.\"    Here Miss Vernon interrupting her examination of the book and laying  it on the piano, said, \"But I am forgetting to offer you any tea,  Mr. Gilpin,\"--and placing a chair beside her own, returned to the  tea table; while Colonel Vernon, with a wave of the hand towards me,  exclaimed, \"There is the reason we particularly wished you to join us  this evening, my dear sir; in order to make our old and new friends  acquainted. Let me introduce Captain Egerton to you, Mr. Gilpin;  Captain Egerton, an old Dungar friend of ours, whom I picked up very  curiously this morning.\"    Mr. Gilpin returned my salute, and looking at me somewhat keenly,  drank his tea; continuing to converse in a low tone with Miss  Vernon, who turned on him, from time to time, such beaming looks of  kindliness, that it required all my consciousness of his great personal  disadvantages, and grey hair to boot, to prevent the \"green-eyed  monster\" from taking possession of me.    The Colonel devoted himself to Mrs. Winter; sometimes joining in Miss  Vernon's conversation, while Mr. Winter, turning to me with much  civility, placed himself at my service, so far as directing me to the  antiquities and scenery, best worth viewing went; \"further would be  useless, for every eye sees its own beauty and its own sketch!\"    Fully assenting to this, we glided into pleasant conversation on the  respective merits of ancient and modern painters, till, at last, Miss  Vernon rang the bell, to dismiss the tea apparatus, and order lights;  \"although it is almost sacrilege to shut out that lovely moon,\" she  added, smiling.    \"No,\" said Winter, \"a soliloquy or a _tête à tête_ is best by  moon-light; but for a social party, large or small, it is too bold and  pure a light; we'd find our spirits flag under its influence.\"    \"Then let us shut it out speedily,\" said the Colonel, drawing the  curtains and opening the piano; \"I suppose, Egerton, we may include you  among the lovers of music?\"    Assenting to this readily, I moved to where Miss Vernon was again  inspecting the dusky book. \"May I see the treasure you have found?\"    \"Oh yes, you see it is an old book of chants, how curious the  square-headed notes are! I suppose they are genuine Gregorian; have you  tried any of them yet, Mr. Gilpin?\"    \"Almost all; some are very rude, but many of them are beautiful; I long  to try their effect with several voices; and with your assistance,  as you say you will be so good, I hope soon to have the children in  training.\"    \"If you think I am capable.\"    \"Kate,\" said her grandfather, \"Winter has brought his violin; give us  that German duet I like so much.\"    After a little tuning, they began, and kept most perfectly together;  I have seldom heard a more charming performance. Both evidently  understood, not only the music, but each other's feeling of it, while  Miss Vernon's round white fingers seemed to make a living, feeling  creature of the inanimate instrument.    \"Well, that is well done; you improve,\" I heard the Organist say, in  tones of great satisfaction, while we were more noisily applauding;  and Kate looked up in his face with such complete reliance on his  judgment, and delight in his approbation, that I felt a strange thrill  of vexation to think how dubious it was that such would ever be called  forth by me.    Mr. Gilpin, now taking Miss Vernon's place at the piano, poured forth a  beautiful \"_sinfonia_,\" I think they call it; and Miss Vernon accepting  the seat I vacated for her, sat listening and abstracted, her full eyes  gazing on some imaginary object, unconscious of all around her; a  slight tremor sometimes passing over her curved upper lip.    Rousing herself with an almost imperceptible sigh, she turned her  eyes full on me, interrupting abruptly the long gaze in which I had  indulged, \"How beautiful! what a story that music seems to tell.\" At  this moment the music, slow and of touching sadness, had glided by a  succession of sweeping chords into a bolder and more martial strain.    \"You have a great deal of imagination, Miss Vernon.\"    \"That is a polite way of saying you are a visionary.\"    \"No, no, there is nothing visionary about you, but I respect  imagination.\"    \"Then you are a rare specimen of your sex, Captain Egerton.\"    \"Yes, we have less imagination, but then our life is much more  practical.\"    \"Has yours been a very practical life?\"    \"Mine! do not ask me to look at it.\"    She laughed low but merrily.    \"This has been a delightful evening to me; I have to thank you for a  peep into a new world, Miss Vernon.\"    \"Oh, you like it because it is new; you would soon tire of our quiet  world, and I do not see why I am to be thanked for it, grandpapa\"--    \"What was it brought me to A----? solely my wish to see and apologise  to you.\"    \"Captain Egerton, you cannot suppose I will credit such a _conte_;  besides, it is not necessary; you see how welcome an old Dungar friend  is; why seek to render assurance doubly sure, by trying to persuade me  you came here in search of a person to whose address neither you nor  any one had the slightest clue?\"    \"Doubt my word if you will, Miss Vernon, I can only say that not many  hours after you left the Angel Hotel, I there discovered traces,  certainly faint enough, which were the cause of my visit here.\"    At the name of \"The Angel,\" Miss Vernon started, colored slightly, and  then with a smile said,    \"Well, I can say nothing more. What a pity such energies as yours  should be lost in H.M. Light Dragoons.\"    \"Then you have no very high opinion of my profession?\"    \"Far otherwise, it is necessary, and what is necessary--\"    \"Kate, my dear, give us that serenade I like so much,\" said her  grandfather.    Many a year is past since first those rich soft tones swelled on my  ear, as Miss Vernon sang the following words, but they come back as  vividly to my memory as if they had been heard but an hour ago!        \"Sleep, Oh, beloved! while with Angel guard        I watch o'er thy soft repose;      May the silent sense of my sleepless love        Tinge thy dreams as thine eye lids close!                    Sleep, Oh, beloved one! sleep.        \"Breathe o'er her hushed and slumbering soul,        Spirit of truth and peace!      Whisper of Heaven, and love, and faith,        Bid doubt and dread to cease.                    Sleep, Oh, sleep!        \"Then wake with dewy rosy lips,        And eyes of deep calm bliss,      To greet the heart that yearns for thee,        With morning's loving kiss!                    Sleep, oh, beloved! sleep.\"    The music was peculiar, and the last note of each verse sustained,  and dying away with an expression of unutterable tenderness, made an  indelible impression on me. \"What a heart that girl must have,\" was my  only clear idea, as I stood silent with folded arms, utterly unable to  say a word of the exquisite pleasure she had afforded me.    \"After that,\" said Winter, at the end of a chorus of applause, \"not  another word or note. Good night, Colonel; you Nightingale, _la vostra  bocca sana qual che tocca!_\"    I joined the others in making my adieus; heard something about Mr.  Winter calling on me the next day, and walked to my hotel, through  the moonlit streets in a state of trance, lulled by the music and  indescribable effect of the whole evening, into a delicious calm, which  raised me _pro tem._ far above all sublunary interests.          CHAPTER V.    SKETCHERS AND SKETCHES.      How well I remember the philosophic contempt for wealth with which I  awoke the following morning! Here, I thought, is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47449"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 8 (of 8) (#9)"],[1,"upon, certain rights are reserved to  the owner of the farm wherein the area is situated. These rights are in  effect to select certain portions of the proclaimed area as mining  \"claims\" belonging to the owner, and to mark off these portions. The  remainder of the area is then open to appropriation by the public, the  first comer having the first right. Shortly before the war of 1899, in  consequence of scenes of disorder attending the marking off of these  \"claims\" by the general public, steps were taken to introduce a system  of assigning the mining areas by lot among the residents in each  district.    The taxation of the mineral grounds was, and is, based on a dual system.  The one is taxation, by means of levying a monthly due, called a \"claim  licence,\" in the mere possession of a mining area, called a \"claim,\"  whether or not the area is being developed. The other principle,  superadded to the first, was that of taxing the profits of each mine.  Before the war this latter tax amounted to five per cent.    In relation to gold mining, in one very important respect the Law of the  Transvaal, like that of Cape Colony, is in striking opposition to the  rules of civilised law all over the world. The famous I. D. B. (Illicit  Diamond Buying) enactments passed to protect diamond mining in Kimberley  have a parallel in the I. G. B. (Illicit Gold Buying) provisions of the  Transvaal Law. It is incumbent on the possessor of rough diamonds to  prove his innocence. Similarly, under the Gold Law of the Transvaal,  \"Any one who is found in possession of amalgam or unwrought gold, or  uncut precious stones, and can give no proof that he obtained possession  of the same in a lawful manner,\" is punishable with fine and  imprisonment. For a third offence, the amount of fine and imprisonment  with hard labour is at the discretion of the Court, and forfeiture of  the unwrought gold, or uncut precious stones, follows conviction.    It is true that in England, for instance, a similar exception is in  force with reference to the possession of explosives, a measure intended  to prevent Anarchist outrages. But the difference is very great between  the two classes of cases. The manufacture and sale of explosives is not  the staple industry of England, as the production of gold and diamonds  is in South Africa. The chief occupation of the industrial population of  England is not affected; the provision remains only one of some  inconsiderable exceptions to the general rule, that every one is  presumed innocent until he is proved guilty.    The law relating to natives, under which head are included all the  coloured races, is equally strange to those familiar only with the Law  of England. The so-called Pass Law provides that every native in  districts or towns inhabited by Europeans--everywhere, in fact, except  in the native villages--must be in possession of an official passport,  showing he is registered in an official State registry. Other  regulations limit the action of the native--the Curfew regulations,  compelling Kaffirs in town districts to remain indoors after sunset.  Municipal rules, prohibiting Kaffirs from walking on the footpath of the  street, and special rules of the Criminal Law affect them. The lash is  presented as the penalty for various offences. The death penalty is  inflicted for Kaffir outrages on women of the European race. By the  imposition of a Hut Tax, payable annually, the Kaffir is induced to  labour; an occupation which, if left to himself, he prefers to leave to  women.    The Law of Universal Military Service, applying to all Europeans who are  burghers--a law of all the States of South Africa--furnishes another  point of divergence from the Law of England. In the Transvaal all  burghers over the age of sixteen and up to the age of sixty are under  the military command of the elected Field Cornet of the district. In  time of war the age begins at fourteen and has no fixed limit for  ending. This, be it noted, is not a case of conscription; it is a levy  _en masse_, taken as a normal condition of life. Burghers on commando  are exempt from civil process, and are exempt from the obligation of  paying claim licenses for the period they are on commando.      III.--RECENT BRITISH MODIFICATIONS    It is, of course, in the present stage of our information impossible to  state fully the various modifications which have been introduced in the  new Colonies since the British annexation two years ago.    Some changes worth noticing have, however, been published.    In Private Law, the chief change of which we have information appears to  have been the abolition of the Orphan Chamber of Roman Dutch Law--a  State department concerned with the administration of infants' estates.  The change, however, seems only to have been one of administration and  title, the duties of the abolished Chamber being transferred to the  Attorney-General's Department.    As regards the Gold Law, an enactment by the late Republic of a war-tax  on the gold output of from forty to fifty per cent. has been abolished.  The British tax on the mines has been fixed by proclamation at ten per  cent. on the profits of each mine. The system of claim licenses--taxation  on the possession of mining areas--is continued.    Minor modifications of the details of the Native Pass Law have also been  announced, including the restriction of the number of cases, and of the  power of magistrates to sentence Kaffirs to the punishment of the lash.    The Law of Military Service appears to remain up to the present  unmodified. Indeed, a recent decision in the newly established British  High Court of the Transvaal has very rigidly construed a provision of  the Gold Law, protecting burghers on commando from liability to pay  license dues. The Court refuses to allow to Uitlanders the same  privilege as that allowed to burghers in arms. The Uitlander, according  to that decision, is liable to pay these arrears accruing during the war  to the present British administration.      IV.--PRINCIPLES OF IMPERIAL POLICY--OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF THEIR BEING  CARRIED OUT    Before considering specific suggestions as to actual legislation  required in the new Colonies, it is necessary to set clearly before us  what are the objects to be aimed at by Imperial statesmen. Most of the  errors of the past century of Imperial rule in South Africa are  traceable to the fact that no steady and consistent policy has been  adopted for any definite period. With every change of government in the  United Kingdom the British policy in South Africa altered. As I have  written elsewhere, it swung with bewildering inconsistency, according to  whether an Imperialist or a Little Englander Government was in power,  from an expansionist to a \"retrenchment\" policy. Alternately  negrophilist and anti-Kaffir, alternately conciliatory to the Dutch and  aggressively British. \"Nothing more fixed than the certainty of Imperial  change, unless, indeed, it were the cruelty of Imperial ingratitude.\"    I shall take it, then, that consistency is the least we may expect as  the result of the late war. The maintenance of the integrity of the  world-wide Empire, plainly bound up with the retention of South Africa,  involving the possession of the only secure sea-route to Australia and  India; the upholding of the banner of European justice and humanity in  Africa, the British portion of the mission of the European race the  world over--to this end, the fusion of all strains of the European  people in a new nationality to form a constituent part of the  Empire--these I take to be the objects of Imperial statesmen in the  United Kingdom and the Colonies, and of all loyal citizens of the  Empire.    Now, these principles being fixed, we have next to consider what are the  dangers threatening the successful carrying out of a policy based on  these principles.    The first, and most formidable, danger is that arising from the  existence in all the Colonies of South Africa of a Separatist party  among the Boer section of the population, usually described as the Young  Afrikander party. Its origin is due to many historic causes; among which  not the least has been the unwise and vacillating policy of the Imperial  Government. That party is by no means extinct as a result of the late  war. No matter what professions are made in the Land of Diplomatists, it  has to be reckoned with for our time and generation. It relies for the  ultimate success of its policy of substituting a Boer-ruled independent  State for British citizenship of the Empire on many causes. In the first  place, the stubborn tenacity of the Boer people, and their slowness to  abandon any long-held purpose. Again, on their military skill, their  religious fanaticism, their conviction that they are the Lord's elect,  and that His sword will smite not in vain. Yet again, and most of all,  on the enormous birth-rate among the Boers--families of twelve sons  being not uncommon. Boer ignorance of the power and purpose of the  Empire--of the real character of that federation of freemen--figures  also in their calculations; and as well the barrier against fusion of  the European strains kept up by the use of that _patois_ of the  Hollander tongue, the South African _Taal_. Lastly, their main reliance  is on future inefficiency of the Imperial administration--marred by  negrophilist British missionaries and English society nepotism and  favouritism--on the see-saw of British party politics, and on the  prospects of the Empire becoming involved in war with some great  European Power.    The next danger is that arising from the presence on the goldfields of  the Transvaal of vast agglomerations of cosmopolitan finance owning most  of the mineral wealth of the State. On many points, the interest of  these groups is not the same as those of the Imperial Government and  those of the rank and file of the British settlers. Taxation of the  mines for"]]]
