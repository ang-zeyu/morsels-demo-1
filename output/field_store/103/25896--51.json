Mortimer, I forgot to say, wore  glasses; and, if there is one time more than another when a man should  not wear glasses, it is while a strong-faced, keen-eyed wanderer in the  wilds is telling a beautiful girl the story of his adventures.    For this was what Denton was doing. My arrival seemed to have  interrupted him in the middle of narrative. He shook my hand in a  strong, silent sort of way, and resumed:    \"Well, the natives seemed fairly friendly, so I decided to stay the  night.\"    I made a mental note never to seem fairly friendly to an explorer. If  you do, he always decides to stay the night.    \"In the morning they took me down to the river. At this point it widens  into a _kongo_, or pool, and it was here, they told me, that the  crocodile mostly lived, subsisting on the native oxen--the short-horned  _jongos_--which, swept away by the current while crossing the ford  above, were carried down on the _longos_, or rapids. It was not,  however, till the second evening that I managed to catch sight of his  ugly snout above the surface. I waited around, and on the third day I  saw him suddenly come out of the water and heave his whole length on to  a sandbank in mid-stream and go to sleep in the sun. He was certainly a  monster--fully thirty--you have never been in Central Africa, have you,  Miss Weston? No? You ought to go there!--fully fifty feet from tip to  tail. There he lay, glistening. I shall never forget the sight.\"    He broke off to light a cigarette. I heard Betty draw in her breath  sharply. Mortimer was beaming through his glasses with the air of the  owner of a dog which is astonishing a drawing-room with its clever  tricks.    \"And what did you do then, Mr. Denton?\" asked Betty, breathlessly.    \"Yes, what did you do then, old chap?\" said Mortimer.    Denton blew out the match and dropped it on the ash-tray.    \"Eh? Oh,\" he said, carelessly, \"I swam across and shot him.\"    \"Swam across and shot him!\"    \"Yes. It seemed to me that the chance was too good to be missed. Of  course, I might have had a pot at him from the bank, but the chances  were I wouldn't have hit him in a vital place. So I swam across to the  sandbank, put the muzzle of my gun in his mouth, and pulled the  trigger. I have rarely seen a crocodile so taken aback.\"    \"But how dreadfully dangerous!\"    \"Oh, danger!\" Eddie Denton laughed lightly. \"One drops into the habit  of taking a few risks out there, you know. Talking of _danger_,  the time when things really did look a little nasty was when the  wounded _gongo_ cornered me in a narrow _tongo_ and I only had  a pocket-knife with everything in it broken except the corkscrew  and the thing for taking stones out of horses' hoofs. It was like  this----\"    I could bear no more. I am a tender-hearted man, and I made some excuse  and got away. From the expression on the girl's face I could see that  it was only a question of days before she gave her heart to this  romantic newcomer.           *       *       *       *       *    As a matter of fact, it was on the following afternoon that she called  on me and told me that the worst had happened. I had known her from a  child, you understand, and she always confided her troubles to me.    \"I want your advice,\" she began. \"I'm so wretched!\"    She burst into tears. I could see the poor girl was in a highly nervous  condition, so I did my best to calm her by describing how I had once  done the long hole in four. My friends tell me that there is no finer  soporific, and it seemed as though they may be right, for presently,  just as I had reached the point where I laid my approach-putt dead from  a distance of fifteen feet, she became quieter. She dried her eyes,  yawned once or twice, and looked at me bravely.    \"I love Eddie Denton!\" she said.    \"I feared as much. When did you feel this coming on?\"    \"It crashed on me like a thunderbolt last night after dinner. We were  walking in the garden, and he was just telling me how he had been  bitten by a poisonous _zongo_, when I seemed to go all giddy. When  I came to myself I was in Eddie's arms. His face was pressed against  mine, and he was gargling.\"    \"Gargling?\"    \"I thought so at first. But he reassured me. He was merely speaking in  one of the lesser-known dialects of the Walla-Walla natives of Eastern  Uganda, into which he always drops in moments of great emotion. He soon  recovered sufficiently to give me a rough translation, and then I knew  that he loved me. He kissed me. I kissed him. We kissed each other.\"    \"And where was Mortimer all this while?\"    \"Indoors, cataloguing his collection of vases.\"    For a moment, I confess, I was inclined to abandon Mortimer's cause. A  man, I felt, who could stay indoors cataloguing vases while his  _fiancee_ wandered in the moonlight with explorers deserved all  that was coming to him. I overcame the feeling.    \"Have you told him?\"    \"Of course not.\"    \"You don't think it might be of interest to him?\"    \"How can I tell him? It would break his heart. I am awfully fond of  Mortimer. So is Eddie. We would both die rather than do anything to  hurt him. Eddie is the soul of honour. He agrees with me that Mortimer  must never know.\"    \"Then you aren't going to break off your engagement?\"    \"I couldn't. Eddie feels the same. He says that, unless something can  be done, he will say good-bye to me and creep far, far away to some  distant desert, and there, in the great stillness, broken only by the  cry of the prowling _yongo_, try to forget.\"    \"When you say 'unless something can be done,' what do you mean? What  can be done?\"    \"I thought you might have something to suggest. Don't you think it  possible that somehow Mortimer might take it into his head to break the  engagement himself?\"    \"Absurd! He loves you devotedly.\"    \"I'm afraid so. Only the other day I dropped one of his best vases, and  he just smiled and said it didn't matter.\"    \"I can give you even better proof than that. This morning Mortimer came  to me and asked me to give him secret lessons in golf.\"    \"Golf! But he despises golf.\"    \"Exactly. But he is going to learn it for your sake.\"    \"But why secret lessons?\"    \"Because he wants to keep it a surprise for your birthday. Now can you  doubt his love?\"    \"I am not worthy of him!\" she whispered.    The words gave me an idea.    \"Suppose,\" I said, \"we could convince Mortimer of that!\"    \"I don't understand.\"    \"Suppose, for instance, he could be made to believe that you were, let  us say, a dipsomaniac.\"    She shook her head. \"He knows that already.\"    \"What!\"    \"Yes; I told him I sometimes walked in my sleep.\"    \"I mean a secret drinker.\"    \"Nothing will induce me to pretend to be a secret drinker.\"    \"Then a drug-fiend?\" I suggested, hopefully.    \"I hate medicine.\"    \"I have it!\" I said. \"A kleptomaniac.\"    \"What is that?\"    \"A person who steals things.\"    \"Oh, that's horrid.\"    \"Not at all. It's a perfectly ladylike thing to do. You don't know you  do it.\"    \"But, if I don't know I do it, how do I know I do it?\"    \"I beg your pardon?\"    \"I mean, how can I tell Mortimer I do it if I don't know?\"    \"You don't tell him. I will tell him. I will inform him tomorrow that  you called on me this afternoon and stole my watch and\"--I glanced  about the room--\"my silver matchbox.\"    \"I'd rather have that little vinaigrette.\"    \"You don't get either. I merely say you stole it. What will happen?\"    \"Mortimer will hit you with a cleek.\"    \"Not at all. I am an old man. My white hairs protect me. What he will  do is to insist on confronting me with you and asking you to deny the  foul charge.\"    \"And then?\"    \"Then you admit it and release him from his engagement.\"    She sat for a while in silence. I could see that my words had made an  impression.    \"I think it's a splendid idea. Thank you very much.\" She rose and moved  to the door. \"I knew you would suggest something wonderful.\" She  hesitated. \"You don't think it would make it sound more plausible if I  really took the vinaigrette?\" she added, a little wistfully.    \"It would spoil everything,\" I replied, firmly, as I reached for the  vinaigrette and locked it carefully in my desk.    She was silent for a moment, and her glance fell on the carpet. That,  however, did not worry me. It was nailed down.    \"Well, good-bye,\" she said.    \"_Au revoir_,\" I replied. \"I am meeting Mortimer at six-thirty  tomorrow. You may expect us round at your house at about eight.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mortimer was punctual at the tryst next morning. When I reached the  tenth tee he was already there. We exchanged a brief greeting and I  handed him a driver, outlined the essentials of grip and swing, and  bade him go to it.    \"It seems a simple game,\" he said, as he took his stance. \"You're sure  it's fair to have the ball sitting up on top of a young sand-hill like  this?\"    \"Perfectly fair.\"    \"I mean, I don't want to be coddled because I'm a beginner.\"    \"The ball is always teed up for the drive,\" I assured him.    \"Oh, well, if you say so. But it seems to me to take all the element of  sport out of the game. Where do I hit it?\"    \"Oh, straight ahead.\"    \"But isn't it dangerous? I mean, suppose I smash a window in that house  over there?\"    He indicated a charming bijou residence some five hundred yards down  the fairway.    \"In that case,\" I replied, \"the owner comes out in his pyjamas and  offers you the choice between some nuts and a cigar.\"    He seemed reassured, and began to address the ball. Then he paused  again.    \"Isn't there something you say before you start?\" he asked. \"'Five', or  something?\"    \"You may say 'Fore!' if it makes you feel any easier. But it isn't  necessary.\"    \"If I am going to learn this silly game,\" said Mortimer, firmly, \"I am  going to learn it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7037"],[0,"Beric the Briton : a Story of the Roman Invasion (#9)"],[1,"wolves were  slain without mercy, and at the end of the operations that portion  of the country was completely cleared of these savage beasts, for  those who had escaped the beating parties had fled far away through  the forest to more quiet quarters.    The work had been laborious; for each day some forty miles had been  traversed in the march from the last place of slaughter to the next  beat, and in the subsequent proceedings. It had, however, been full  of interest and excitement, especially during the second week, when,  having cleared all the country in the neighbourhood of the rivers,  the men were ranged in wide circles some ten miles in diameter,  advancing gradually towards a centre. Occasionally many of the wolves  escaped before the lines had narrowed sufficiently for the men to  be near enough to each other to oppose a successful resistance, but  in each case the majority continued to slink from the approaching  noises until the cordon was too close for them to break through.    Altogether over four thousand wolves were slain. All those whose  coats were in good condition were skinned, the skins being valuable  for linings to the huts, for beds, and winter mantles. Many men  had been bitten more or less severely by them, but none had been  killed; and there was much rejoicing at the complete clearance from  the district of a foe that had, since the arrival of the large packs  from the north, made terrible inroads among the herds of cattle  and swine, and had killed a considerable number of men, women, and  children. The previous winter had been a very severe one, and had  driven great numbers of wolves down from North Britain. The fighting  that had been going on for years in the south and west, and at times  in the midlands, had put a stop to the usual chases of wolves in  those districts, and they had consequently multiplied exceedingly  and had become a serious scourge even before the arrival of the  fresh bands from the north. However, after so great a slaughter it  was hoped that for a time at least they would not again make their  appearance in that neighbourhood.    Returning home at the end of their expedition Beric was surprised  as he entered the hall to see a Druid standing upon the dais  conversing with his mother, who was pacing up and down with angry  gestures. That their conference was an important one he did not  doubt; for the Druids dwelt in the recesses of the forests or near  their temples, and those who wished to consult them must journey  to them to ask their counsel beneath a sacred oak or in the circle  of the magic stones. When great events were impending, or when  tribes took up arms against each other, the Druids would leave  their forest abodes, and, interposing between the combatants,  authoritatively bid them desist. They acted as mediators between  great chiefs, and were judges upon all matters in dispute. He was  sure, therefore, that the Druid was the bearer of news of importance.  He stood waiting in the centre of the hall until his mother's eye  fell upon him.    \"Come hither, Beric,\" she said, \"and hear the news that the holy  Druid has brought. Think you not that the Romans have carried their  oppression far enough when they have seized half the land of our  island, enslaved the people, and exacted tribute from the free  Britons? What think you, now? The Roman governor Severus, knowing  that it is our religion as well as love of our country that arms  us against them, and that the Druids ever raise their voices to bid  us defend our altars and our homes, have resolved upon an expedition  against the Sacred Island, and have determined to exterminate our  priests, to break down our altars, and to destroy our religion.  Ten days since the legion marched from Camalodunum to join the army  he is assembling in the west. From all other parts he has drawn  soldiers, and he has declared his intention of rooting out and  destroying our religion at its centre.\"    \"The news is terrible,\" the Druid said, \"but our gods will fight  for us, and doubtless a terrible destruction will fall upon the  impious men who thus dream of profaning the Sacred Island; but it  may be otherwise, or perchance the gods may see that thus, and thus  only, can the people of Britain be stirred to take up arms and to  annihilate the worshippers of the false gods of Rome. Assuredly we  are on the eve of great events, and every Briton must prepare to  take up arms, either to fall upon the legions whom our gods have  stricken or to avenge the insult offered to our faith.\"    \"It is terrible news, indeed,\" Beric said; \"and though I am but a  lad, father, I am ready when the call comes to fight in the front  ranks of the Iceni with our people. My father fell fighting for  his country by the sword of the Romans, and I am ready to follow  his example when my mother shall say, 'Go out to war.'\"    \"For the present, Beric, we must remain quiet; we must await news  of the result of this expedition; but the word has gone round,  and I and my brethren are to visit every chief of the Iceni, while  the Druids of the north stir up the Brigantes; the news, too, that  the time of their deliverance is at hand, and that they must hold  themselves in readiness to rise against the oppressors, is passing  through the Trinobantes and the tribes of the south and southwest.  This time it must be no partial rising, and we must avoid the ruinous  error of matching a single tribe against the whole strength of the  Romans. It must be Britain against Rome--a whole people struggling  for their homes and altars against those who would destroy their  religion and reduce them to slavery.\"    \"I would that it could have been postponed for a time, father,\" Beric  said. \"During the four years I passed as a hostage at Camalodunum  I have been learning the tactics that have enabled the Romans  to conquer us. I have learned their words of command, and how the  movements were executed, and I hope when I become a man to train  the Sarci to fight in solid order, to wheel and turn as do the  Romans, so that we might form a band which might in the day of  battle oppose itself to the Roman onset, check pursuit, and perhaps  convert a reverse into a victory.\"    \"Heed not that,\" the Druid said enthusiastically. \"It would be  useful indeed, but there is but scant time for it now. Our gods  will fight for us. We have numbers and valour. Our warriors will  sweep their soldiers aside as a wave dashes over a rock.\"    The conversation between the Druid and Parta had been heard by  others in the hall, and the news spread rapidly among the tribesmen  as they returned from the chase. Shouts of fury and indignation  rose outside, and several of the minor chiefs, followed by a crowd  of excited men, poured into the hall, demanding with loud shouts  that war should be declared against the Romans. The Druid advanced  to the edge of the dais.    \"Children,\" he said, \"the time has not yet come, nor can the Sarci  do aught until the word is given by Prasutagus, and the whole of  the Iceni rise in arms, and not the Iceni alone, but Britons from  sea to sea. Till then hold yourselves in readiness. Sharpen your  arms and prepare for the contest. But you need a chief. In the  ordinary course of things years would have elapsed before Beric, the  son of your last brave prince, would have been associated with his  mother in the rule of the tribe; but on the eve of such a struggle  ordinary customs and usages must be set at nought. I therefore,  in virtue of my sacred authority, now appoint Beric as chief next  to his mother in the tribe, and I bid you obey him in all things  relating to war. He has learned much of Roman ways and methods,  and is thus better fitted than many far older than he to instruct  you how best to stand their onset, and I prophesy that under him no  small honour and glory will fall to the tribe, and that they will  bear a signal share in avenging our gods and winning our freedom.  Come hither, Beric;\" and the Druid, laying a hand upon the lad's  head, raised the other to heaven and implored the gods to bestow  wisdom and strength upon him, and to raise in him a mighty champion  of his country and faith. Then he uttered a terrible malediction upon  any who should disobey Beric's orders, or question his authority,  who should show faint heart in the day of battle, or hold his life  of any account in the cause of his country.    \"Now,\" he concluded, \"retire to your homes. We must give no cause  or pretext for Roman aggression until the signal is given. You  will not be idle. Your young chief will teach you somewhat of the  discipline that has rendered the Roman soldiers so formidable, so  that you may know how to set yourselves in the day of battle, how  to oppose rank to rank, to draw off in good order, or to press  forward to victory. The issue is ever in the hands of the gods,  but we should do all we can to deserve it. It is good to learn even  from our enemies. They have studied war for ages, and if they have  conquered brave peoples, it has not been by superior valour, but  because they have studied war, while others have trusted solely to  their native valour. Therefore deem not instruction useless, or  despise methods simply because you do not understand them. None  could be braver than those who fought under Caractacus, yet they  were conquered, not by the valour, but by the discipline of the  Romans. It was the will of the gods that your young chief should  dwell for four years a hostage among the Romans, and doubtless  they willed it should be so in order that he might be fitted to be  a worthy champion of his country, and so to effect what even the  valour of Caractacus failed to do. The gods have spoken by me. See  that you obey them, and woe to the wretch who murmurs even in his  own heart against their decrees!\"    As he concluded a loud shout was raised throughout the crowded hall,  and swelled into a mighty roar outside, for "]]]
