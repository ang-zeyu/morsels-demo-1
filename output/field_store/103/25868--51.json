These two young men were bred to the legal  profession, and the former, afterwards Sir Joseph Arnould, became  a judge in Bombay. But the father of Alfred Domett had been one of  Nelson's captains, and the roving sailor spirit was apparent in his  son; for he had scarcely been called to the Bar when he started for New  Zealand on the instance of a cousin who had preceded him, but who was  drowned in the course of a day's surveying before he could arrive. He  became a member of the New Zealand Parliament, and ultimately, for a  short time, of its Cabinet; only returning to England after an absence  of thirty years. This Mr. Domett seems to have been a very modest man,  besides a devoted friend of Robert Browning's, and on occasion a warm  defender of his works. When he read the apostrophe to 'Alfred, dear  friend,' in the 'Guardian Angel', he had reached the last line before it  occurred to him that the person invoked could be he. I do not think that  this poem, and that directly addressed to him under the pseudonym of  'Waring', were the only ones inspired by the affectionate remembrance  which he had left in their author's mind.    Among his boy companions were also the three Silverthornes, his  neighbours at Camberwell, and cousins on the maternal side. They appear  to have been wild youths, and had certainly no part in his intellectual  or literary life; but the group is interesting to his biographer.  The three brothers were all gifted musicians; having also, probably,  received this endowment from their mother's father. Mr. Browning  conceived a great affection for the eldest, and on the whole most  talented of the cousins; and when he had died--young, as they all  did--he wrote 'May and Death' in remembrance of him. The name of  'Charles' stands there for the old, familiar 'Jim', so often uttered by  him in half-pitying, and all-affectionate allusion, in his later years.  Mrs. Silverthorne was the aunt who paid for the printing of 'Pauline'.    It was at about the time of his short attendance at University College  that the choice of poetry as his future profession was formally made. It  was a foregone conclusion in the young Robert's mind; and little less  in that of his father, who took too sympathetic an interest in his son's  life not to have seen in what direction his desires were tending. He  must, it is true, at some time or other, have played with the thought of  becoming an artist; but the thought can never have represented a wish.  If he had entertained such a one, it would have met not only with no  opposition on his father's part, but with a very ready assent, nor  does the question ever seem to have been seriously mooted in the family  councils. It would be strange, perhaps, if it had. Mr. Browning became  very early familiar with the names of the great painters, and also  learned something about their work; for the Dulwich Gallery was within a  pleasant walk of his home, and his father constantly took him there. He  retained through life a deep interest in art and artists, and became a  very familiar figure in one or two London studios. Some drawings made  by him from the nude, in Italy, and for which he had prepared himself by  assiduous copying of casts and study of human anatomy, had, I believe,  great merit. But painting was one of the subjects in which he never  received instruction, though he modelled, under the direction of his  friend Mr. Story; and a letter of his own will presently show that, in  his youth at least, he never credited himself with exceptional artistic  power. That he might have become an artist, and perhaps a great one,  is difficult to doubt, in the face of his brilliant general ability and  special gifts. The power to do a thing is, however, distinct from the  impulse to do it, and proved so in the present case.    More importance may be given to an idea of his father's that he should  qualify himself for the Bar. It would naturally coincide with the  widening of the social horizon which his University College classes  supplied; it was possibly suggested by the fact that the closest friends  he had already made, and others whom he was perhaps now making, were  barristers. But this also remained an idea. He might have been placed in  the Bank of England, where the virtual offer of an appointment had been  made to him through his father; but the elder Browning spontaneously  rejected this, as unworthy of his son's powers. He had never, he said,  liked bank work himself, and could not, therefore, impose it on him.    We have still to notice another, and a more mistaken view of the  possibilities of Mr. Browning's life. It has been recently stated,  doubtless on the authority of some words of his own, that the Church was  a profession to which he once felt himself drawn. But an admission of  this kind could only refer to that period of his childhood when natural  impulse, combined with his mother's teaching and guidance, frequently  caused his fancy and his feelings to assume a religious form. From the  time when he was a free agent he ceased to be even a regular churchgoer,  though religion became more, rather than less, an integral part of his  inner life; and his alleged fondness for a variety of preachers meant  really that he only listened to those who, from personal association  or conspicuous merit, were interesting to him. I have mentioned Canon  Melvill as one of these; the Rev. Thomas Jones was, as will be  seen, another. In Venice he constantly, with his sister, joined the  congregation of an Italian minister of the little Vaudois church there.*         * Mr. Browning's memory recalled a first and last effort at       preaching, inspired by one of his very earliest visits to a       place of worship. He extemporized a surplice or gown,       climbed into an arm-chair by way of pulpit, and held forth       so vehemently that his scarcely more than baby sister was       frightened and began to cry; whereupon he turned to an       imaginary presence, and said, with all the sternness which       the occasion required, 'Pew-opener, remove that child.'    It would be far less surprising if we were told, on sufficient  authority, that he had been disturbed by hankerings for the stage. He  was a passionate admirer of good acting, and would walk from London to  Richmond and back again to see Edmund Kean when he was performing there.  We know how Macready impressed him, though the finer genius of Kean  became very apparent to his retrospective judgment of the two; and it  was impossible to see or hear him, as even an old man, in some momentary  personation of one of Shakespeare's characters, above all of Richard  III., and not feel that a great actor had been lost in him.    So few professions were thought open to gentlemen in Robert Browning's  eighteenth year, that his father's acquiescence in that which he had  chosen might seem a matter scarcely less of necessity than of kindness.  But we must seek the kindness not only in this first, almost inevitable,  assent to his son's becoming a writer, but in the subsequent unfailing  readiness to support him in his literary career. 'Paracelsus',  'Sordello', and the whole of 'Bells and Pomegranates' were published at  his father's expense, and, incredible as it appears, brought no return  to him. This was vividly present to Mr. Browning's mind in what Mrs.  Kemble so justly defines as those 'remembering days' which are the  natural prelude to the forgetting ones. He declared, in the course of  these, to a friend, that for it alone he owed more to his father than to  anyone else in the world. Words to this effect, spoken in conversation  with his sister, have since, as it was right they should, found their  way into print. The more justly will the world interpret any incidental  admission he may ever have made, of intellectual disagreement between  that father and himself.    When the die was cast, and young Browning was definitely to adopt  literature as his profession, he qualified himself for it by reading and  digesting the whole of Johnson's Dictionary. We cannot be surprised to  hear this of one who displayed so great a mastery of words, and so deep  a knowledge of the capacities of the English language.          Chapter 5    1833-1835    'Pauline'--Letters to Mr. Fox--Publication of the Poem; chief  Biographical and Literary Characteristics--Mr. Fox's Review in the  'Monthly Repository'; other Notices--Russian Journey--Desired diplomatic  Appointment--Minor Poems; first Sonnet; their Mode of Appearance--'The  Trifler'--M. de Ripert-Monclar--'Paracelsus'--Letters to Mr. Fox  concerning it; its Publication--Incidental Origin of 'Paracelsus'; its  inspiring Motive; its Relation to 'Pauline'--Mr. Fox's Review of it in  the 'Monthly Repository'--Article in the 'Examiner' by John Forster.        Before Mr. Browning had half completed his twenty-first year he had  written 'Pauline, a Fragment of a Confession'. His sister was in the  secret, but this time his parents were not. This is why his aunt,  hearing that 'Robert' had 'written a poem,' volunteered the sum  requisite for its publication. Even this first instalment of success did  not inspire much hope in the family mind, and Miss Browning made pencil  copies of her favourite passages for the event, which seemed only too  possible, of her never seeing the whole poem again. It was, however,  accepted by Saunders and Otley, and appeared anonymously in 1833.  Meanwhile the young author had bethought himself of his early  sympathizer, Mr. Fox, and he wrote to him as follows (the letter is  undated):      Dear Sir,--Perhaps by the aid of the subjoined initials and a little  reflection, you may recollect an oddish sort of boy, who had the honour  of being introduced to you at Hackney some years back--at that time  a sayer of verse and a doer of it, and whose doings you had a little"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6574"],[0,"Watchers of the Sky (#9)"],[1,"phrases from the Shepherd King,  And fluttering morsels from Catullus sang.  Much was fantastic. All was touched with light  That only genius knows to steal from heaven.  He spoke of poetry, as the \"flowering time  Of knowledge,\" called it \"thought in passionate tune  With those great rhythms that steer the moon and sun;  Thought in such concord with the soul of things  That it can only move, like tides and stars,  And man's own beating heart, and the wings of birds,  In law, whose service only sets them free.\"  Therefore it often leaps to the truth we seek,  Clasping it, as a lover clasps his bride  In darkness, ere the sage can light his lamp.  And so, in music, men might find the road  To truth, at many a point, where sages grope.  One day, a greater Plato would arise  To write a new philosophy, he said,  Showing how music is the golden clue  To all the windings of the world's dark maze.  Himself had used it, partly proved it, too,  In his own book,--_the Harmonies of the World._  'All that the years discover points one way  To this great ordered harmony,\" he said,  \"Revealed on earth by music. Planets move  In subtle accord like notes of one great song  Audible only to the Artificer,  The Eternal Artist. There's no grief, no pain,  But music--follow it simply as a clue,  A microcosmic pattern of the whole--  Can show you, somewhere in its golden scheme,  The use of all such discords; and, at last,  Their exquisite solution. Then darkness breaks  Into diviner light, love's agony climbs  Through death to life, and evil builds up heaven.  Have you not heard, in some great symphony,  Those golden mathematics making clear  The victory of the soul? Have you not heard  The very heavens opening?                            Do those fools  Who thought me an infidel then, still smile at me  For trying to read the stars in terms of song,  Discern their orbits, measure their distances,  By musical proportions? Let them smile,  My folly at least revealed those three great laws;  Gave me the golden vases of the Egyptians,  To set in the great new temple of my God  Beyond the bounds of Egypt.                              They will forget  My methods, doubtless, as the years go by,  And the world's wisdom shuts its music out.  The dust will gather on all my harmonies;  Or scholars turn my pages listlessly,  Glance at the musical phrases, and pass on,  Not troubling even to read one Latin page.  Yet they'll accept those great results as mine.  I call them mine. How can I help exulting,  Who climbed my ladder of music to the skies  And found, by accident, let them call it so,  Or by the inspiration of that Power  Which built His world of music, those three laws:--  First, how the speed of planets round the sun  Bears a proportion, beautifully precise  As music, to their silver distances;  Next, that although they seem to swerve aside  From those plain circles of old Copernicus  Their paths were not less rhythmical and exact,  But followed always that most exquisite curve  In its most perfect form, the pure ellipse;  Third, that although their speed from point to point  Appeared to change, their radii always moved  Through equal fields of space in equal times.  Was this my infidelity, was this  Less full of beauty, less divine in truth,  Than their dull chaos? You, the poet will know  How, as those dark perplexities grew clear,  And old anomalous discords changed to song,  My whole soul bowed and cried, _Almighty God  These are Thy thoughts, I am thinking after Thee!_  I hope that Tycho knows. I owed so much  To Tycho Brahe; for it was he who built  The towers from which I hailed those three great laws.  How strange and far away it all seems now.  The thistles grow upon that little isle  Where Tycho's great Uraniborg once was.  Yet, for a few sad years, before it fell  Into decay and ruin, there was one  Who crept about its crumbling corridors,  And lit the fire of memory on its hearth.\"--  Wotton looked quickly up, \"I think I have heard  Something of that. You mean poor Jeppe, his dwarf.  Fynes Moryson, at the Mermaid Inn one night  Showed a most curious manuscript, a scrawl  On yellow parchment, crusted here and there  With sea-salt, or the salt of those thick tears  Creatures like Jeppe, the crooked dwarf, could weep.  It had been found, clasped in a crooked hand,  Under the cliffs of Wheen, a crooked hand  That many a time had beckoned to passing ships,  Hoping to find some voyager who would take  A letter to its master.                          The sailors laughed  And jeered at him, till Jeppe threw stones at them.  And now Jeppe, too, was dead, and one who knew  Fynes Moryson, had found him, and brought home  That curious crooked scrawl. Fynes Englished it  Out of its barbarous Danish. Thus it ran:  'Master, have you forgotten Jeppe, your dwarf,  Who used to lie beside the big log-fire  And feed from your own hand? The hall is dark,  There are no voices now,--only the wind  And the sea-gulls crying round Uraniborg.  I too am crying, Master, even I,  Because there is no fire upon the hearth,  No light in any window. It is night,  And all the faces that I knew are gone.    Master, I watched you leaving us. I saw  The white sails dwindling into sea-gull's wings,  Then melting into foam, and all was dark.  I lay among the wild flowers on the cliff  And dug my nails into the stiff white chalk  And called you, Tycho Brahe. You did not hear;  But gulls and jackdaws, wheeling round my head,  Mocked me with _Tycho Brahe_, and _Tycho Brahe_!    You were a great magician, Tycho Brahe;  And, now that they have driven you away,  I, that am only Jeppe,--the crooked dwarf,  You used to laugh at for his matted hair,  And head too big and heavy--take your pen  Here in your study. I will write it down  And send it by a sailor to the King  Of Scotland, and who knows, the mouse that gnawed  The lion free, may save you, Tycho Brahe.'\"  \"He is free now,\" said Kepler, \"had he lived  He would have sent for Jeppe to join him there  At Prague. But death forestalled him, and your King.  The years in which he watched that planet Mars,  His patient notes and records, all were mine;  And, mark you, had he clipped or trimmed one fact  By even a hair's-breadth, so that his results  Made a pure circle of that planet's path  It might have baffled us for an age and drowned  All our new light in darkness. But he held  To what he saw. He might so easily,  So comfortably have said, 'My instruments  Are crude and fallible. In so fine a point  Eyes may have erred, too. Why not acquiesce?  Why mar the tune, why dislocate a world,  For one slight clash of seeming fact with faith?'  But no, though stars might swerve, he held his course,  Recording only what his eyes could see  Until death closed them.                           Then, to his results,  I added mine and saw, in one wild gleam,  Strange as the light of day to one born blind,  A subtler concord ruling them and heard  Profounder tones of harmony resolve  Those broken melodies into song again.\"--  \"Faintly and far away, I, too, have seen  In music, and in verse, that golden clue  Whereof you speak,\" said Wotton. \"In all true song,  There is a hidden logic. Even the rhyme  That, in bad poets, wrings the neck of thought,  Is like a subtle calculus to the true,  An instrument of discovery. It reveals  New harmonies, new analogies. It links  Far things and near, not in unnatural chains,  But in those true accords which still escape  The plodding reason, yet unify the world.  I caught some glimpses of this mystic power  In verses of your own, that elegy  On Tycho, and that great quatrain of yours--  I cannot quite recall the Latin words,  But made it roughly mine in words like these:    _'I know that I am dust, and daily die;    Yet, as I trace those rhythmic spheres at night,  I stand before the Thunderer's throne on high    And feast on nectar in the halls of light.'_    My version lacks the glory of your lines  But...\"          \"Mine too was a version,\"    Kepler laughed,  \"Turned into Latin from old Ptolemy's Greek;  For, even in verse, half of the joy, I think,  Is just to pass the torch from hand to hand  An undimmed splendour. But, last night, I tried  Some music all my own. I had a dream  That I was wandering in some distant world.  I have often dreamed it Once it was the moon.  I wrote that down in prose. When I am dead,  It may be printed. This was a fairer dream:  For I was walking in a far-off spring  Upon the planet, Venus. Only verse  Could spread true wings for that delicious world;  And so I wrote it--for no eyes but mine,  Or 'twould be seized on, doubtless, as fresh proof  Of poor old Kepler's madness.\"--                                   \"Let me hear,  Madman to madman; for I, too, write verse.\"  Then Kepler, in a rhythmic murmur, breathed  His rich enchanted memories of that dream:    \"Beauty burned before me     Swinging a lanthorn through that fragrant night.   I followed a distant singing,     And a dreaming light   How she led me, I cannot tell     To that strange world afar,   Nor how I walked, in that wild glen     Upon the sunset star.     Winged creatures floated     Under those rose-red boughs of violet bloom,   With delicate forms unknown on Earth     'Twixt irised plume and plume;   Human-hearted, angel-eyed,     And crowned with unknown flowers;   For nothing in that enchanted world     Followed the way of ours.     Only I saw that Beauty,     On Hesper, as on earth, still held command;   And though, as one in slumber,     I roamed that radiant land,   With all these earth-born senses sealed     To what the Hesperians knew,   The faithful lanthorn of her law     Was mine on Hesper too.     Then, half at home with wonder,     I saw strange flocks of flowers like birds take flight;   Great trees that burned like opals     To lure their loves at night;   Dark beings that could move in realms     No dream of ours has known.
