First of all Nuth wanted to see a business reference, and when he was  shown one from a jeweller with whom he happened to be hand-in-glove  the upshot of it was that he agreed to take young Tonker (for this was  the surname of the likely lad) and to make him his apprentice. And the  old woman whose bonnet was lined with red went back to her little  cottage in the country, and every evening said to her old man,  \"Tonker, we must fasten the shutters of a night-time, for Tommy's a  burglar now.\"    The details of the likely lad's apprenticeship I do not propose to  give; for those that are in the business know those details already,  and those that are in other businesses care only for their own, while  men of leisure who have no trade at all would fail to appreciate the  gradual degrees by which Tommy Tonker came first to cross bare boards,  covered with little obstacles in the dark, without making any sound,  and then to go silently up creaky stairs, and then to open doors, and  lastly to climb.    Let it suffice that the business prospered greatly, while glowing  reports of Tommy Tonker's progress were sent from time to time to the  old woman whose bonnet was lined with red in the labourious  handwriting of Nuth. Nuth had given up lessons in writing very early,  for he seemed to have some prejudice against forgery, and therefore  considered writing a waste of time. And then there came the  transaction with Lord Castlenorman at his Surrey residence. Nuth  selected a Saturday night, for it chanced that Saturday was observed  as Sabbath in the family of Lord Castlenorman, and by eleven o'clock  the whole house was quiet. Five minutes before midnight Tommy Tonker,  instructed by Mr. Nuth, who waited outside, came away with one  pocketful of rings and shirt-studs. It was quite a light pocketful,  but the jewellers in Paris could not match it without sending  specially to Africa, so that Lord Castlenorman had to borrow bone  shirt-studs.    Not even rumour whispered the name of Nuth. Were I to say that this  turned his head, there are those to whom the assertion would give  pain, for his associates hold that his astute judgment was unaffected  by circumstance. I will say, therefore, that it spurred his genius to  plan what no burglar had ever planned before. It was nothing less than  to burgle the house of the gnoles. And this that abstemious man  unfolded to Tonker over a cup of tea. Had Tonker not been nearly  insane with pride over their recent transaction, and had he not been  blinded by a veneration for Nuth, he would have--but I cry over spilt  milk. He expostulated respectfully; he said he would rather not go; he  said it was not fair; he allowed himself to argue; and in the end, one  windy October morning with a menace in the air found him and Nuth  drawing near to the dreadful wood.    Nuth, by weighing little emeralds against pieces of common rock, had  ascertained the probable weight of those house-ornaments that the  gnoles are believed to possess in the narrow, lofty house wherein they  have dwelt from of old. They decided to steal two emeralds and to  carry them between them on a cloak; but if they should be too heavy  one must be dropped at once. Nuth warned young Tonker against greed,  and explained that the emeralds were worth less than cheese until they  were safe away from the dreadful wood.    Everything had been planned, and they walked now in silence.    No track led up to the sinister gloom of the trees, either of men or  cattle; not even a poacher had been there snaring elves for over a  hundred years. You did not trespass twice in the dells of the gnoles.  And, apart from the things that were done there, the trees themselves  were a warning, and did not wear the wholesome look of those that we  plant ourselves.    The nearest village was some miles away with the backs of all its  houses turned to the wood, and without one window at all facing in  that direction. They did not speak of it there, and elsewhere it is  unheard of.    Into this wood stepped Nuth and Tommy Tonker. They had no firearms.  Tonker had asked for a pistol, but Nuth replied that the sound of a  shot \"would bring everything down on us,\" and no more was said about  it.    Into the wood they went all day, deeper and deeper. They saw the  skeleton of some early Georgian poacher nailed to a door in an oak  tree; sometimes they saw a fairy scuttle away from them; once Tonker  stepped heavily on a hard, dry stick, after which they both lay still  for twenty minutes. And the sunset flared full of omens through the  tree trunks, and night fell, and they came by fitful starlight, as  Nuth had foreseen, to that lean, high house where the gnoles so  secretly dwelt.    All was so silent by that unvalued house that the faded courage of  Tonker flickered up, but to Nuth's experienced sense it seemed too  silent; and all the while there was that look in the sky that was  worse than a spoken doom, so that Nuth, as is often the case when men  are in doubt, had leisure to fear the worst. Nevertheless he did not  abandon the business, but sent the likely lad with the instruments of  his trade by means of the ladder to the old green casement. And the  moment that Tonker touched the withered boards, the silence that,  though ominous, was earthly, became unearthly like the touch of a  ghoul. And Tonker heard his breath offending against that silence, and  his heart was like mad drums in a night attack, and a string of one of  his sandals went tap on a rung of a ladder, and the leaves of the  forest were mute, and the breeze of the night was still; and Tonker  prayed that a mouse or a mole might make any noise at all, but not a  creature stirred, even Nuth was still. And then and there, while yet  he was undiscovered, the likely lad made up his mind, as he should  have done long before, to leave those colossal emeralds where they  were and have nothing further to do with the lean, high house of the  gnoles, but to quit this sinister wood in the nick of time and retire  from business at once and buy a place in the country. Then he  descended softly and beckoned to Nuth. But the gnoles had watched him  through knavish holes that they bore in trunks of the trees, and the  unearthly silence gave way, as it were with a grace, to the rapid  screams of Tonker as they picked him up from behind--screams that came  faster and faster until they were incoherent. And where they took him  it is not good to ask, and what they did with him I shall not say.    Nuth looked on for a while from the corner of the house with a mild  surprise on his face as he rubbed his chin, for the trick of the holes  in the trees was new to him; then he stole nimbly away through the  dreadful wood.    \"And did they catch Nuth?\" you ask me, gentle reader.    \"Oh, no, my child\" (for such a question is childish). \"Nobody ever  catches Nuth.\"        HOW ONE CAME, AS WAS FORETOLD, TO THE CITY OF NEVER      The child that played about the terraces and gardens in sight of the  Surrey hills never knew that it was he that should come to the  Ultimate City, never knew that he should see the Under Pits, the  barbicans and the holy minarets of the mightiest city known. I think  of him now as a child with a little red watering-can going about the  gardens on a summer's day that lit the warm south country, his  imagination delighted with all tales of quite little adventures, and  all the while there was reserved for him that feat at which men  wonder.    Looking in other directions, away from the Surrey hills, through all  his infancy he saw that precipice that, wall above wall and mountain  above mountain, stands at the edge of the World, and in perpetual  twilight alone with the Moon and the Sun holds up the inconceivable  City of Never. To tread its streets he was destined; prophecy knew it.  He had the magic halter, and a worn old rope it was; an old wayfaring  woman had given it to him: it had the power to hold any animal whose  race had never known captivity, such as the unicorn, the hippogriff  Pegasus, dragons and wyverns; but with a lion, giraffe, camel or  horse it was useless.    How often we have seen that City of Never, that marvel of the Nations!  Not when it is night in the World, and we can see no further than the  stars; not when the sun is shining where we dwell, dazzling our eyes;  but when the sun has set on some stormy days, all at once repentant at  evening, and those glittering cliffs reveal themselves which we almost  take to be clouds, and it is twilight with us as it is for ever with  them, then on their gleaming summits we see those golden domes that  overpeer the edges of the World and seem to dance with dignity and  calm in that gentle light of evening that is Wonder's native haunt.  Then does the City of Never, unvisited and afar, look long at her  sister the World.    It had been prophecied that he should come there. They knew it when  the pebbles were being made and before the isles of coral were given  unto the sea. And thus the prophecy came unto fulfilment and passed  into history, and so at length to Oblivion, out of which I drag it as  it goes floating by, into which I shall one day tumble. The  hippogriffs dance before dawn in the upper air; long before sunrise  flashes upon our lawns they go to glitter in light that has not yet  come to the World, and as the dawn works up from the ragged hills and  the stars feel it they go slanting earthwards, till sunlight touches  the tops of the tallest trees, and the hippogriffs alight with a  rattle of quills and fold their wings and gallop and gambol away till  they come to some prosperous, wealthy, detestable town, and they leap  at once from the fields and soar away from the sight of it, pursued by  the horrible smoke of it until they come again to the pure blue air.    He whom prophecy had named from of old to come to the City of Never,  went down one midnight with his magic halter to a lake-side where"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7498"],[0,"Five Little Peppers Grown Up (#9)"],[1,". And somebody else peered down the  row of vehicles, and answered, \"Mr. Bayley's driving her.\"    And they were all off.    Polly kept saying to herself, \"Oh, dear, dear, what could I have said to  make him think I would go with him?\" And Livingston Bayley smiled  happily to himself under the collar of his driving coat; and the  sparkling snow cut into little crystals by the horse's flying feet,  dashed into their faces, and the scraps of laughter and merry nonsense  from the other sleighs, made Polly want nothing so much as to cower down  into the corner of the big fur robes, for a good cry.    And before she knew it, Mr. Bayley had turned off, leaving the gay  procession on the main road.    \"Oh!\" cried Polly then, and starting forward, \"Mr. Bayley, why, we're  off the road!\"    \"I know a short cut to the depot,\" he answered hastily, \"it's a better  way.\"    \"But we may miss the train--oh, do turn back, and overtake them,\" begged  Polly, in a tremor.    \"This is a vastly better road,\" said Mr. Bayley, and instead of turning  back, he flicked the horse lightly with his whip. \"You'll say, Miss  Mary, that it's much better this way.\" He tried to laugh. \"Isn't the  sleighing superb?\"    \"Oh, yes--oh dear me!\" cried poor Polly, straining her eyes to catch a  sight of the last vehicle with its merry load. \"Indeed, Mr. Bayley, I'm  afraid we sha'n't get to the depot in time. There may be drifts on this  road, or something to delay us.\"    \"Oh, no, indeed!\" cried Livingston Bayley confidently, now smiling again  at his forethought in driving over this very identical piece of roadway,  when the preparations for the Christmas festivity were keeping all the  other people busy at Dunraven, and leaving him free to provide himself  with sleighing facilities for the evening. \"Don't be troubled, I know  all about it; I assure you, Miss Mary, we shall reach the depot as soon  as the rest of the party do, for it's really a shorter cut.\"    Polly beat her foot impatiently on the warm foot-muff he had wrung with  difficulty from the livery keeper, and counted the moments, unable to  say a word.    \"Miss Mary\"--suddenly Mr. Livingston Bayley turned--\"everything is  forgiven under such circumstances, I believe,\" and he laughed.    Polly didn't speak, only half hearing the words, her heart on the rest  of the party, every instant being carried further from her.    \"And you must have seen--'pon me word it is impossible that you didn't  see that--that\"--    \"Oh, dear,\" burst out Polly suddenly, and peering anxiously down the  white winding highway. \"If there should be a drift on the road!\"    Livingston Bayley bit his lip angrily. \"'Pon me word, Miss Mary,\" he  began, \"you are the first girl I ever cared to speak to, and now you  can't think of anything but the roads.\"    Still Polly peered into the unbroken whiteness of the thoroughfare,  lined by the snow-laden pines and spruces, all inextricably mixed as the  sleigh spun by. It was too late to turn back now, she knew; the best  that could be done, was to hurry on--and she began to count the  hoof-beats and to speculate how long it would be before they would see  the lights of the little station, and find the lost party again.    \"I might have spoken to a great many other girls,\" Livingston Bayley was  saying, \"and I really don't know why I didn't choose one of them.  Another man in my place would, and you must do me the justice to  acknowledge it; 'pon me word, you must, Miss Mary.\"    Polly tore off her gaze from the snowy fields where the branches of the  trees were making little zigzag paths in the moonlight, to fasten it on  as much of his face as was visible between his cap and his high collar.    \"And I really shouldn't think you would play with me,\" declared Mr.  Bayley, nervously fingering the whip-handle, \"I shouldn't, don't you  know, because you are not the sort of girl to do that thing. 'Pon me  word, you're not, Miss Mary.\"    \"I? what do you mean?\" cried poor Polly, growing more and more  bewildered.    \"Why I--I--of course you must know; 'pon me word, you must, Miss Mary,  for it began five years ago, before you went abroad, don't you know?\"    Polly sank back among her fur robes while he went on.    \"And I've done what no other fellow would, I'm sure,\" he said  incoherently, \"in my place, kept constant, don't you know, to one idea.  Been with other girls, of course, but only really made up my mind to  marry you. 'Pon me word, I didn't, Miss Mary.\"    \"And you've brought me out, away from the rest of the party, to tell me  this,\" exclaimed Polly, springing forward to sit erect with flashing  eyes. \"How good of you, Mr. Bayley, to announce your intention to marry  me.\"    \"You can't blame me,\" cried Mr. Bayley in an injured way. \"That cad of a  Loughead means to speak soon--'pon me word, the fellow does. And I've  never changed my mind about it since I made it up, even when you began  to give music lessons.\"    \"Oh, how extremely kind,\" cried Polly.    \"Don't put it that way,\" he began deprecatingly. \"I couldn't help it,  don't you know, for I liked you awfully from the first, and always  intended to marry you. You shall have everything in the world that you  want, and go everywhere. And my family, you know, has an _entree_  to any society that's worth anything.\"    \"I wouldn't marry you,\" cried Polly stormily, \"if you could give me all  the gold in the world; and as for family,\" here she sat quite erect with  shining eyes, \"the Peppers have always been the loveliest people that  ever lived--the very loveliest--oh\"--she broke off suddenly, starting  forward--\"there's something on the road; see, Mr. Bayley!\"    And spinning along, the horse now making up his mind to get to the depot  in time, they both saw a big wagon out of which protruded two or three  bags evidently containing apples and potatoes; one of the wheels  determining to perform no more service for its master, was resting  independently on the snowy thoroughfare, for horse and driver were gone.    \"I beg your pardon,\" exclaimed Mr. Livingston Bayley suddenly, at sight  of this, \"for bringing you around here. But how was I to know of that  beastly wreck?\"    \"We must get out,\" said Polly, springing off from her side of the  sleigh, \"and lead the horse around.\"    But this was not so easy a matter; for the farmer's wagon had stopped in  the narrowest part of the road, either side shelving off, under its  treacherous covering of snow. At last, after all sorts of ineffectual  attempts on Mr. Bayley's part to induce the horse to stir a step, Polly  desperately laid her hand on the bridle. \"Let me try,\" she said. \"There,  you good creature,\" patting the horse's nose; \"come, that's a dear old  fellow,\" and they never knew quite how, but in the course of time, they  were all on the other side of the wreck, and Mr. Livingston Bayley was  helping her into the sleigh, and showering her with profuse apologies  for the whole thing.    \"Never mind,\" said Polly, as she saw his distress, \"only never say such  perfectly dreadful things to me again. And now, hurry just as fast as  you can, please!\"    And presently a swift turn brought the twinkling lights of the little  station to view, and there was the entire party calling to them as they  now spied their approach, to \"Hurry up!\" and there also was the train,  holding its breath in curbed impatience to be off.          CHAPTER V.    BAD NEWS.      \"Oh, Mamsie,\" cried Polly in dismay, \"must Papa Fisher know?\"    \"Certainly,\" said Mrs. Fisher firmly, \"your father must be told every  thing.\"    \"Dear me!\" exclaimed Polly, turning off in dismay, \"it seems so--so  unfair to Mr. Bayley. Mightn't it be just as if he hadn't spoken,  Mamsie?\" She came back now to her mother's side, and looked anxiously  into the black eyes.    \"But he has spoken,\" said Mother Fisher, \"and your father must be told.  Why, Polly, that isn't like you, child, to want to keep anything from  him,\" she added reproachfully.    \"Oh! I don't--I couldn't ever in all this world keep anything from  Father Fisher,\" declared Polly vehemently, \"only,\" and the color flew in  rosy waves over her face, \"this doesn't seem like my secret, Mamsie. And  Mr. Bayley would feel so badly to have it known,\" and her head drooped.    \"Still it must be known by your father,\" said her mother firmly, \"and I  must tell Mr. King. Then it need go no further.\"    \"Oh, Mamsie!\" exclaimed Polly, in a sharp tone of distress, \"you  wouldn't ever in all this world tell Grandpapa!\"    \"I most certainly shall,\" declared Mrs. Fisher. \"He ought to know  everything that concerns you, Polly, and each one of you children. It is  his right.\"    Polly sat down in the nearest chair and clasped her hands. \"Grandpapa  will show Mr. Bayley that he doesn't like it,\" she mourned, \"and it will  hurt his feelings.\"    Mrs. Fisher's lip curled. \"No more do I like it,\" she said curtly. \"In  the first place to speak to you at all; and then to take such a way to  do it; it wasn't a nice thing at all, child, for Mr. Bayley to do,\" here  Mrs. Fisher walked to the window, her irritation getting the better of  her, so that Polly might not see her face.    \"But he didn't mean to speak then--that is\"--began Polly.    \"He should have spoken to your father or to Mr. King,\" said Mrs. Fisher,  coming back to face Polly, \"but I presume the young man didn't know any  better, or at least, he didn't think, and that's enough to say about  that. But as for not telling Mr. King about it, why, it isn't to be  thought of for a minute. So I best have it over with at once.\" And with  a reassuring smile at Polly she went out, and closed the door.    \"Oh, dear me,\" cried poor Polly, left alone; and springing out of her  chair, she began to pace the floor. \"Now it will be perfectly dreadful  for Mr. Bayley. Grandpapa will be very angry; he never liked him; and  now he can't help showing what he feels. Oh! why did Mr. Bayley speak.\"    \"Polly,\" called Jasper's voice, out in the"]]]
