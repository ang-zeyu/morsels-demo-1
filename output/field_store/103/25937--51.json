Selah.    19:044:009 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not             forth with our armies.    19:044:010 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which             hate us spoil for themselves.    19:044:011 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast             scattered us among the heathen.    19:044:012 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy             wealth by their price.    19:044:013 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a             derision to them that are round about us.    19:044:014 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the             head among the people.    19:044:015 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my             face hath covered me,    19:044:016 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by             reason of the enemy and avenger.    19:044:017 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,             neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.    19:044:018 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined             from thy way;    19:044:019 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and             covered us with the shadow of death.    19:044:020 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our             hands to a strange god;    19:044:021 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of             the heart.    19:044:022 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are             counted as sheep for the slaughter.    19:044:023 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for             ever.    19:044:024 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction             and our oppression?    19:044:025 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth             unto the earth.    19:044:026 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.    19:045:001 My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things             which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a             ready writer.    19:045:002 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into             thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.    19:045:003 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory             and thy majesty.    19:045:004 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and             meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach             thee terrible things.    19:045:005 Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies;             whereby the people fall under thee.    19:045:006 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy             kingdom is a right sceptre.    19:045:007 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore             God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness             above thy fellows.    19:045:008 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of             the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.    19:045:009 Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy             right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.    19:045:010 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear;             forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;    19:045:011 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy             Lord; and worship thou him.    19:045:012 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the             rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.    19:045:013 The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of             wrought gold.    19:045:014 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework:             the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought             unto thee.    19:045:015 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall             enter into the king's palace.    19:045:016 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest             make princes in all the earth.    19:045:017 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations:             therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.    19:046:001 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in             trouble.    19:046:002 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and             though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;    19:046:003 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the             mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.    19:046:004 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city             of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.    19:046:005 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall             help her, and that right early.    19:046:006 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his             voice, the earth melted.    19:046:007 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.             Selah.    19:046:008 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath             made in the earth.    19:046:009 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh             the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the             chariot in the fire.    19:046:010 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the             heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.    19:046:011 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.             Selah.    19:047:001 O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the             voice of triumph.    19:047:002 For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over             all the earth.    19:047:003 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our             feet.    19:047:004 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of             Jacob whom he loved. Selah.    19:047:005 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a             trumpet.    19:047:006 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King,             sing praises.    19:047:007 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with             understanding.    19:047:008 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of             his holiness.    19:047:009 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the             people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth             belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.    19:048:001 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of             our God, in the mountain of his holiness.    19:048:002 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount             Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.    19:048:003 God is known in her palaces for a refuge.    19:048:004 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.    19:048:005 They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and             hasted away.    19:048:006 Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in             travail.    19:048:007 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.    19:048:008 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of             hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever.             Selah.    19:048:009 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of             thy temple.    19:048:010 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends             of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.    19:048:011 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad,             because of thy judgments.    19:048:012 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers             thereof.    19:048:013 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may             tell it to the generation following.    19:048:014 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our             guide even unto death.    19:049:001 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the             world:    19:049:002 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.    19:049:003 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart             shall be of understanding.    19:049:004 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark             saying upon the harp.    19:049:005 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity             of my heels shall compass me about?    19:049:006 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the             multitude of their riches;    19:049:007 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to             God a ransom for him:    19:049:008 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth             for ever:)    19:049:009 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.    19:049:010 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the             brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.    19:049:011 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for             ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call             their lands after their own names.    19:049:012 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the             beasts that perish.    19:049:013 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve             their sayings.

eat so much as is sufficient for thee,             lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.    20:025:017 Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary             of thee, and so hate thee.    20:025:018 A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a             maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.    20:025:019 Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a             broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.    20:025:020 As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as             vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy             heart.    20:025:021 If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be             thirsty, give him water to drink:    20:025:022 For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD             shall reward thee.    20:025:023 The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance             a backbiting tongue.    20:025:024 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with             a brawling woman and in a wide house.    20:025:025 As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far             country.    20:025:026 A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a             troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.    20:025:027 It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their             own glory is not glory.    20:025:028 He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that             is broken down, and without walls.    20:026:001 As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not             seemly for a fool.    20:026:002 As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the             curse causeless shall not come.    20:026:003 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the             fool's back.    20:026:004 Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be             like unto him.    20:026:005 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his             own conceit.    20:026:006 He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off             the feet, and drinketh damage.    20:026:007 The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the             mouth of fools.    20:026:008 As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth             honour to a fool.    20:026:009 As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a             parable in the mouths of fools.    20:026:010 The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool,             and rewardeth transgressors.    20:026:011 As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his             folly.    20:026:012 Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope             of a fool than of him.    20:026:013 The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is             in the streets.    20:026:014 As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon             his bed.    20:026:015 The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to             bring it again to his mouth.    20:026:016 The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that             can render a reason.    20:026:017 He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to             him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.    20:026:018 As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,    20:026:019 So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not             I in sport?    20:026:020 Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is             no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.    20:026:021 As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a             contentious man to kindle strife.    20:026:022 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into             the innermost parts of the belly.    20:026:023 Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered             with silver dross.    20:026:024 He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit             within him;    20:026:025 When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven             abominations in his heart.    20:026:026 Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be             shewed before the whole congregation.    20:026:027 Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a             stone, it will return upon him.    20:026:028 A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a             flattering mouth worketh ruin.    20:027:001 Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a             day may bring forth.    20:027:002 Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a             stranger, and not thine own lips.    20:027:003 A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is             heavier than them both.    20:027:004 Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to             stand before envy?    20:027:005 Open rebuke is better than secret love.    20:027:006 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an             enemy are deceitful.    20:027:007 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul             every bitter thing is sweet.    20:027:008 As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that             wandereth from his place.    20:027:009 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness             of a man's friend by hearty counsel.    20:027:010 Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not;             neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy             calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a             brother far off.    20:027:011 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him             that reproacheth me.    20:027:012 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the             simple pass on, and are punished.    20:027:013 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a             pledge of him for a strange woman.    20:027:014 He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in             the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.    20:027:015 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious             woman are alike.    20:027:016 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his             right hand, which bewrayeth itself.    20:027:017 Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of             his friend.    20:027:018 Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he             that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.    20:027:019 As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to             man.    20:027:020 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are             never satisfied.    20:027:021 As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is             a man to his praise.    20:027:022 Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with             a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.    20:027:023 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look             well to thy herds.    20:027:024 For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to             every generation?    20:027:025 The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and             herbs of the mountains are gathered.    20:027:026 The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of             the field.    20:027:027 And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the             food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy             maidens.    20:028:001 The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are             bold as a lion.    20:028:002 For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof:             but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof             shall be prolonged.    20:028:003 A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain             which leaveth no food.    20:028:004 They "]]]
