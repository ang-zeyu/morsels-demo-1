Alas, Lycinus, I am only just beginning to get an inkling of  the right way. Very far off dwells Virtue, as Hesiod says, and long and  steep and rough is the way thither, and travellers must bedew it with  sweat.    _Ly_. And you have not yet sweated and travelled enough?    _Her_. Surely not; else should I have been on the summit, with  nothing left between me and bliss; but I am only starting yet, Lycinus.    _Ly_. Ah, but Hesiod, your own authority, tells us, Well begun is  half done; so we may safely call you half-way by this time.    _Her_. Not even there yet; that would indeed have been much.    _Ly_. Where _shall_ we put you, then?    _Her_. Still on the lower slopes, just making an effort to get on;  but it is slippery and rough, and needs a helping hand.    _Ly_. Well, your master can give you that; from his station on the  summit, like Zeus in Homer with his golden cord, he can let you down his  discourse, and therewith haul and heave you up to himself and to the  Virtue which he has himself attained this long time.    _Her_. The very picture of what he is doing; if it depended on him  alone, I should have been hauled up long ago; it is my part that is still  wanting.    _Ly_. You must be of good cheer and keep a stout heart; gaze at the  end of your climb and the Happiness at the top, and remember that he is  working with you. What prospect does he hold out? when are you to be up?  does he think you will be on the top next year--by the Great Mysteries,  or the Panathenaea, say?    _Her_. Too soon, Lycinus.    _Ly_. By next Olympiad, then?    _Her_. All too short a time, even that, for habituation to Virtue  and attainment of Happiness.    _Ly_. Say two Olympiads, then, for an outside estimate. You may fairly be  found guilty of laziness, if you cannot get it done by then; the time  would allow you three return trips from the Pillars of Heracles to India,  with a margin for exploring the tribes on the way instead of sailing  straight and never stopping. How much higher and more slippery, pray, is  the peak on which your Virtue dwells than that Aornos crag which Alexander  stormed in a few days?    _Her_. There is no resemblance, Lycinus; this is not a thing, as you  conceive it, to be compassed and captured quickly, though ten thousand  Alexanders were to assault it; in that case, the sealers would have been  legion. As it is, a good number begin the climb with great confidence,  and do make progress, some very little indeed, others more; but when they  get half-way, they find endless difficulties and discomforts, lose heart,  and turn back, panting, dripping, and exhausted. But those who endure to  the end reach the top, to be blessed thenceforth with wondrous days,  looking down from their height upon the ants which are the rest of  mankind.    _Ly_. Dear me, what tiny things you make us out--not so big as the Pygmies  even, but positively grovelling on the face of the earth. I quite  understand it; your thoughts are up aloft already. And we, the common men  that walk the earth, shall mingle you with the Gods in our prayers; for  you are translated above the clouds, and gone up whither you have so long  striven.    _Her_. If but that ascent might be, Lycinus! but it is far yet.    _Ly_. But you have never told me _how_ far, in terms of time.    _Her_. No; for I know not precisely myself. My guess is that it will  not be more than twenty years; by that time I shall surely be on the  summit.    _Ly_. Mercy upon us, you take long views!    _Her_. Ay; but, as the toil, so is the reward.    _Ly_. That may be; but about these twenty years--have you your master's  promise that you will live so long? is he prophet as well as philosopher?  or is it a soothsayer or Chaldean expert that you trust? such things are  known to them, I understand. You would never, of course, if there were any  uncertainty of your life's lasting to the Virtue-point, slave and toil  night and day like this; why, just as you were close to the top, your fate  might come upon you, lay hold of you by the heel, and lug you down with  your hopes unfulfilled.    _Her_. God forbid! these are words of ill omen, Lycinus; may life be  granted me, that I may grow wise, and have if it be but one day of  Happiness!    _Ly_. For all these toils will you be content with your one day?    _Her_. Content? yes, or with the briefest moment of it.    _Ly_. But is there indeed Happiness up there--and worth all the pains? How  can you tell? You have never been up yourself.    _Her_. I trust my master's word; and he knows well; is he not on the  topmost height?    _Ly_. Oh, do tell me what he says about it; what is Happiness like?  wealth, glory, pleasures incomparable?    _Her_. Hush, friend! all these have nought to do with the Virtuous  life.    _Ly_. Well, if these will not do, what _are_ the good things he offers to  those who carry their course right through?    _Her_. Wisdom, courage, true beauty, justice, full and firm knowledge of  all things as they are; but wealth and glory and pleasure and all bodily  things--these a man strips off and abandons before he mounts up, like  Heracles burning on Mount Oeta before deification; he too cast off  whatever of the human he had from his mother, and soared up to the Gods  with his divine part pure and unalloyed, sifted by the fire. Even so those  I speak of are purged by the philosophic fire of all that deluded men  count admirable, and reaching the summit have Happiness with never a  thought of wealth and glory and pleasure--except to smile at any who count  them more than phantoms.    _Ly_. By Heracles (and his death on Oeta), they quit themselves like  men, and have their reward, it seems. But there is one thing I should  like to know: are they allowed to come down from their elevation  sometimes, and have a taste of what they left behind them? or when they  have once got up, must they stay there, conversing with Virtue, and  smiling at wealth and glory and pleasure?    _Her_. The latter, assuredly; more than that, a man once admitted of  Virtue's company will never be subject to wrath or fear or desire any  more; no, nor can he feel pain, nor any such sensation.    _Ly_. Well, but--if one might dare to say what one thinks--but no--let me  keep a good tongue in my head--it were irreverent to pry into what wise  men do.    _Her_. Nay, nay; let me know your meaning.    _Ly_. Dear friend, I have not the courage.    _Her_. Out with it, my good fellow; we are alone.    _Ly_. Well, then--most of your account I followed and accepted--how  they grow wise and brave and just, and the rest--indeed I was quite  fascinated by it; but then you went on to say they despised wealth and  glory and pleasure; well, just there (quite between ourselves, you know)  I was pulled up; I thought of a scene t'other day with--shall I tell you  whom? Perhaps we can do without a name?    _Her_. No, no; we must have that too.    _Ly_. Your own professor himself, then,--a person to whom all  respect is due, surely, not to mention his years.    _Her_. Well?    _Ly_. You know the Heracleot, quite an old pupil of his in philosophy by  this time--red-haired--likes an argument?    _Her_. Yes; Dion, he is called.    _Ly_. Well, I suppose he had not paid up punctually; anyhow the other day  the old man haled him before the magistrate, with a halter made of his own  coat; he was shouting and fuming, and if some friends had not come up and  got the young man out of his hands, he would have bitten off his nose, he  was in such a temper.    _Her_. Ah, _he_ is a bad character, always an unconscionable time paying  his debts. There are plenty of others who owe the professor money, and he  has never treated any of them so; they pay him his interest punctually.    _Ly_. Not so fast; what in the world does it matter to him, if they do not  pay up? he is purified by philosophy, and has no further need of the cast  clothes of Oeta.    _Her_. Do you suppose his interest in such things is selfish? no, but he  has little ones; his care is to save them from indigence.    _Ly_. Whereas he ought to have brought them up to Virtue too, and let them  share his inexpensive Happiness.    _Her_. Well, I have no time to argue it, Lycinus; I must not be late for  lecture, lest in the end I find myself left behind.    _Ly_. Don't be afraid, my duteous one; to-day is a holiday; I can save you  the rest of your walk.    _Her_. What do you mean?    _Ly_. You will not find him just now, if the notice is to be trusted;  there was a tablet over the door announcing in large print, No meeting  this day. I hear he dined yesterday with the great Eucrates, who was  keeping his daughter's birthday. He talked a good deal of philosophy  over the wine, and lost his temper a little with Euthydemus the  Peripatetic; they were debating the old Peripatetic objections to the  Porch. His long vocal exertions (for it was midnight before they broke  up) gave him a bad headache, with violent perspiration. I fancy he had  also drunk a little too much, toasts being the order of the day, and  eaten more than an old man should. When he got home, he was very ill,  they said, just managed to check and lock up carefully the slices of meat  which he had conveyed to his servant at table, and then, giving orders  that he was not at home, went to sleep, and has not waked since. I  overheard Midas his man telling this to some of his pupils; there were a  number of them coming away.    _Her_. Which had the victory, though, he or Euthydemus--if Midas said  anything about that?    _Ly_. Why, at first, I gathered, it was very even between them; but you  Stoics had it in the end, and your master was much too hard for him.  Euthydemus did not even get off whole; he had a great cut on his head. He  was pretentious, insisted on proving his point, would not give in, and  proved a hard nut to crack; so your"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6593"],[0,"History of Tom Jones, a Foundling (#9)"],[1,"her lips, either to her master or his  sister, till she had first sounded their inclinations, with which her  sentiments were always consonant. Here, however, she thought she might  have launched forth with safety; and the sagacious reader will not  perhaps accuse her of want of sufficient forecast in so doing, but  will rather admire with what wonderful celerity she tacked about, when  she found herself steering a wrong course.    \"Nay, madam,\" said this able woman, and truly great politician, \"I  must own I cannot help admiring the girl's spirit, as well as your  ladyship. And, as your ladyship says, if she was deceived by some  wicked man, the poor wretch is to be pitied. And to be sure, as your  ladyship says, the girl hath always appeared like a good, honest,  plain girl, and not vain of her face, forsooth, as some wanton husseys  in the neighbourhood are.\"    \"You say true, Deborah,\" said Miss Bridget. \"If the girl had been one  of those vain trollops, of which we have too many in the parish, I  should have condemned my brother for his lenity towards her. I saw two  farmers' daughters at church, the other day, with bare necks. I  protest they shocked me. If wenches will hang out lures for fellows,  it is no matter what they suffer. I detest such creatures; and it  would be much better for them that their faces had been seamed with  the smallpox; but I must confess, I never saw any of this wanton  behaviour in poor Jenny: some artful villain, I am convinced, hath  betrayed, nay perhaps forced her; and I pity the poor wretch with all  my heart.\"    Mrs Deborah approved all these sentiments, and the dialogue concluded  with a general and bitter invective against beauty, and with many  compassionate considerations for all honest plain girls who are  deluded by the wicked arts of deceitful men.        Chapter ix.    Containing matters which will surprize the reader.      Jenny returned home well pleased with the reception she had met with  from Mr Allworthy, whose indulgence to her she industriously made  public; partly perhaps as a sacrifice to her own pride, and partly  from the more prudent motive of reconciling her neighbours to her, and  silencing their clamours.    But though this latter view, if she indeed had it, may appear  reasonable enough, yet the event did not answer her expectation; for  when she was convened before the justice, and it was universally  apprehended that the house of correction would have been her fate,  though some of the young women cryed out \"It was good enough for her,\"  and diverted themselves with the thoughts of her beating hemp in a  silk gown; yet there were many others who began to pity her condition:  but when it was known in what manner Mr Allworthy had behaved, the  tide turned against her. One said, \"I'll assure you, madam hath had  good luck.\" A second cryed, \"See what it is to be a favourite!\" A  third, \"Ay, this comes of her learning.\" Every person made some  malicious comment or other on the occasion, and reflected on the  partiality of the justice.    The behaviour of these people may appear impolitic and ungrateful to  the reader, who considers the power and benevolence of Mr Allworthy.  But as to his power, he never used it; and as to his benevolence, he  exerted so much, that he had thereby disobliged all his neighbours;  for it is a secret well known to great men, that, by conferring an  obligation, they do not always procure a friend, but are certain of  creating many enemies.    Jenny was, however, by the care and goodness of Mr Allworthy, soon  removed out of the reach of reproach; when malice being no longer able  to vent its rage on her, began to seek another object of its  bitterness, and this was no less than Mr Allworthy, himself; for a  whisper soon went abroad, that he himself was the father of the  foundling child.    This supposition so well reconciled his conduct to the general  opinion, that it met with universal assent; and the outcry against his  lenity soon began to take another turn, and was changed into an  invective against his cruelty to the poor girl. Very grave and good  women exclaimed against men who begot children, and then disowned  them. Nor were there wanting some, who, after the departure of Jenny,  insinuated that she was spirited away with a design too black to be  mentioned, and who gave frequent hints that a legal inquiry ought to  be made into the whole matter, and that some people should be forced  to produce the girl.    These calumnies might have probably produced ill consequences, at the  least might have occasioned some trouble, to a person of a more  doubtful and suspicious character than Mr Allworthy was blessed with;  but in his case they had no such effect; and, being heartily despised  by him, they served only to afford an innocent amusement to the good  gossips of the neighbourhood.    But as we cannot possibly divine what complection our reader may be  of, and as it will be some time before he will hear any more of Jenny,  we think proper to give him a very early intimation, that Mr Allworthy  was, and will hereafter appear to be, absolutely innocent of any  criminal intention whatever. He had indeed committed no other than an  error in politics, by tempering justice with mercy, and by refusing to  gratify the good-natured disposition of the mob,[*] with an object for  their compassion to work on in the person of poor Jenny, whom, in  order to pity, they desired to have seen sacrificed to ruin and  infamy, by a shameful correction in Bridewell.      [*]Whenever this word occurs in our writings, it intends persons    without virtue or sense, in all stations; and many of the highest    rank are often meant by it.    So far from complying with this their inclination, by which all hopes  of reformation would have been abolished, and even the gate shut  against her if her own inclinations should ever hereafter lead her to  chuse the road of virtue, Mr Allworthy rather chose to encourage the  girl to return thither by the only possible means; for too true I am  afraid it is, that many women have become abandoned, and have sunk to  the last degree of vice, by being unable to retrieve the first slip.  This will be, I am afraid, always the case while they remain among  their former acquaintance; it was therefore wisely done by Mr  Allworthy, to remove Jenny to a place where she might enjoy the  pleasure of reputation, after having tasted the ill consequences of  losing it.    To this place therefore, wherever it was, we will wish her a good  journey, and for the present take leave of her, and of the little  foundling her child, having matters of much higher importance to  communicate to the reader.        Chapter x.    The hospitality of Allworthy; with a short sketch of the characters of  two brothers, a doctor and a captain, who were entertained by that  gentleman.      Neither Mr Allworthy's house, nor his heart, were shut against any  part of mankind, but they were both more particularly open to men of  merit. To say the truth, this was the only house in the kingdom where  you was sure to gain a dinner by deserving it.    Above all others, men of genius and learning shared the principal  place in his favour; and in these he had much discernment: for though  he had missed the advantage of a learned education, yet, being blest  with vast natural abilities, he had so well profited by a vigorous  though late application to letters, and by much conversation with men  of eminence in this way, that he was himself a very competent judge in  most kinds of literature.    It is no wonder that in an age when this kind of merit is so little in  fashion, and so slenderly provided for, persons possessed of it should  very eagerly flock to a place where they were sure of being received  with great complaisance; indeed, where they might enjoy almost the  same advantages of a liberal fortune as if they were entitled to it in  their own right; for Mr Allworthy was not one of those generous  persons who are ready most bountifully to bestow meat, drink, and  lodging on men of wit and learning, for which they expect no other  return but entertainment, instruction, flattery, and subserviency; in  a word, that such persons should be enrolled in the number of  domestics, without wearing their master's cloathes, or receiving  wages.    On the contrary, every person in this house was perfect master of his  own time: and as he might at his pleasure satisfy all his appetites  within the restrictions only of law, virtue, and religion; so he  might, if his health required, or his inclination prompted him to  temperance, or even to abstinence, absent himself from any meals, or  retire from them, whenever he was so disposed, without even a  sollicitation to the contrary: for, indeed, such sollicitations from  superiors always savour very strongly of commands. But all here were  free from such impertinence, not only those whose company is in all  other places esteemed a favour from their equality of fortune, but  even those whose indigent circumstances make such an eleemosynary  abode convenient to them, and who are therefore less welcome to a  great man's table because they stand in need of it.    Among others of this kind was Dr Blifil, a gentleman who had the  misfortune of losing the advantage of great talents by the obstinacy  of a father, who would breed him to a profession he disliked. In  obedience to this obstinacy the doctor had in his youth been obliged  to study physic, or rather to say he studied it; for in reality books  of this kind were almost the only ones with which he was unacquainted;  and unfortunately for him, the doctor was master of almost every other  science but that by which he was to get his bread; the consequence of  which was, that the doctor at the age of forty had no bread to eat.    Such a person as this was certain to find a welcome at Mr Allworthy's  table, to whom misfortunes were ever a recommendation, when"]]]
