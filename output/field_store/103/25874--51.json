Beat your egg; pour the milk and butter into your pan of  flour, then the egg, then the rose-water and spice, and lastly the  yeast. Stir all well together with a knife.    Spread some flour on your paste-board: lay the dough on it, and  knead it well. Then divide it into small pieces of an equal size,  and knead each piece into a little thick round cake. Butter an  iron pan, lay the cakes in it, and set them in a warm place to  rise. Prick the tops with a fork. When they are quite light, bake  them in a moderate oven.      INDIAN POUND CAKE.      Eight eggs.    One pint of powdered sugar.    One pint of Indian meal, sifted, and half a pint of wheat-flour.    Half a pound of butter.    One nutmeg, grated,--and a tea-spoonful of cinnamon.    Half a glass of mixed wine and brandy.    Stir the butter and sugar to a cream. Beat the eggs very light.  Stir the meal and eggs, alternately, into the butter and sugar.  Add the spice and liquor. Stir all well. Butter a tin pan, put in  the mixture, and bake it in a moderate oven.    This cake should be eaten while fresh.      CUP CAKE.      Five eggs.    Two large tea-cups full of molasses.    The same of brown sugar rolled fine.    The same of fresh butter.    One cup of rich milk.    Five cups of flour sifted.    Half a cup of powdered allspice and cloves.    Half a cup of ginger.    Cut up the butter in the milk, and warm them slightly. Warm also  the molasses, and stir it into the milk and butter: then stir in,  gradually, the sugar, and set it away to get cool.    Beat the eggs very light, and stir them into the mixture  alternately with the flour. Add the ginger and other spice, and  stir the whole very hard.    Butter small tins, nearly fill them with the mixture, and bake the  cakes in a moderate oven.        LOAF CAKE.      Two pounds of sifted flour, setting aside half a pound to      sprinkle in at the last.    One pound of fresh butter.    One pound of powdered sugar.    Four eggs.    One pound of raisins, stoned, and cut in half.    One pound of currants, washed and dried.    Half a pint of milk.    Half a glass of wine.    Half a glass of brandy.    A tablespoon of mixed spice, mace, nutmeg, and cinnamon.    Half a pint of the best brewer's yeast; or more, if the      yeast is not very strong.    Cut up the butter in the milk, and warm it till the butter is  quite soft; then stir it together, and set it away to cool. It  must not be made too warm. After you have beaten the eggs, mix  them with the butter and milk, and stir the whole into the pan of  flour. Add the spice and liquor, and stir in the sugar gradually.  Having poured off the thin part from the top, stir the yeast, and  pour it into the mixture. Then sprinkle in the remainder of the  flour.    Have ready the fruit, which must be well floured, stir it  gradually into the mixture. Butter a large tin pan, and put the  cake into it. Cover it, and set in a warm place for five or six  hours to rise. When quite light, bake it in a moderate oven.      SUGAR BISCUITS.      Three pounds of flour, sifted.    One pound of butter.    A pound and a half of powdered sugar.    Half a pint of milk.    Two table-spoonfuls of brandy.    A small tea-spoonful of pearl-ash dissolved in water.    Four table-spoonfuls of carraway seeds.    Cut the butter into the flour. Add the sugar and carraway seeds.  Pour in the brandy, and then the milk. Lastly, put in the  pearl-ash. Stir all well with a knife, and mix it thoroughly, till  it becomes a lump of dough.    Flour your paste-board, and lay the dough on it. Knead it very  well. Divide it into eight or ten pieces, and knead each piece  separately. Then put them all together, and knead them very well  in one lump.    Cut the dough in half, and roll it out into sheets, about half an  inch thick. Beat the sheets of dough very hard, on both sides,  with the rolling-pin. Cut them out into round cakes with the edge  of a tumbler. Butter iron pans, and lay the cakes in them. Bake  them a very pale brown. If done too much, they will lose their  taste.    These cakes kept in a stone jar, closely covered from the air,  will continue perfectly good for several months.      MILK BISCUITS.      Two pounds of flour, sifted.    Half a pound of butter.    Two eggs.    Six wine-glasses of milk.    Two wine-glasses of the best brewer's yeast, or three      of good home-made yeast.    Cut the butter into the milk, and warm it slightly on the top of  the stove, or near the fire. Sift the flour into a pan, and pour  the milk and butter into it. Beat the eggs, and pour them in also.  Lastly the yeast. Mix all well together with a knife.    Flour your paste-board, put the lump of dough on it, and knead it  very hard. Then cut the dough in small pieces, and knead them into  round balls. Stick the tops of them with a fork.    Lay them in buttered pans and set them to rise. They will probably  be light in an hour. When they are quite light, put them in a  moderate oven and bake them.    They are best when quite fresh.      BUTTER BISCUITS.      Half a pound of butter.    Two pounds of flour, sifted    Half a pint of milk, or cold water.    A salt-spoonful of salt.    Cut up the butter in the flour, and put the salt to it. Wet it to  a stiff dough with the milk or water. Mix it well with a knife.    Throw some flour on the paste-board, take the dough out of the  pan, and knead it very well.    Roll it out into a large thick sheet, and beat it very hard on  both sides with the rolling-pin. Beat it a long time.    Cut it out with a tin, or cup, into small round thick cakes. Beat  each cake on both sides, with the rolling-pin. Prick them, with a  fork. Put them in buttered pans, and bake them of a light brown in  a slow oven.      GINGERBREAD NUTS      Two pounds of flour, sifted.    One pound of fresh butter.    One quart of sugar-house molasses.    Two ounces of ginger, or more, if it is not very strong.    Twelve dozen grains of allspice, powdered and sifted    Six dozen cloves, powdered and sifted.    Half an ounce of cinnamon, powdered and sifted.    A half tea-spoonful of pearl-ash or salaeratus, dissolved in a      little vinegar.    Cut up the butter in the flour, and mix it with the ginger and  other spice. Wet the whole with the molasses, and stir all well  together with a knife. Then add the dissolved pearl-ash or  salaeratus.    Throw some flour on your paste-board, take the dough (a large  handful at a time) and knead it in separate cakes. Then put all  together, and knead It very hard for a long time, in one large  lump. Cut the lump in half, roll it out in two even sheets, about  half an inch thick, and cut it out in little cakes, with a very  small tin, about the size of a cent. Lay them in buttered pans,  and bake them in a moderate oven, taking care they do not scorch,  as gingerbread is more liable to burn than any other cake,    You may, if you choose, shape the gingerbread nuts, by putting  flour in your hand, taking a very small piece of the dough, and  rolling it into a little round ball.      COMMON GINGERBREAD.      A pint of molasses.    One pound of fresh butter.    Two pounds and a half of flour, sifted.    A pint of milk,    A small tea-spoonful of pearl-ash, or less if it is strong.    A tea-cup full of ginger.    Cut the butter into the flour. Add the ginger. Having dissolved  the pearl-ash in a little vinegar, stir it with the milk and  molasses alternately into the other ingredients. Stir it very hard  for a long lime, till it is quite light.    Put some flour on your paste-board, take out small portions of the  dough, and make it with your hand into long rolls. Then curl up  the rolls into round cakes, or twist two rolls together, or lay  them in straight lengths or sticks side by side, and touching each  other. Put them carefully in buttered pans, and bake them in a  moderate oven, not hot enough to burn them. If they should get  scorched, scrape off with a knife, or grater, all the burnt parts,  before you put the cakes away.    You can, if you choose, cut out the dough with tins, in the shape  of hearts, circles, ovals, &c. or you may bake it all in one, and  cut it in squares when cold.    If the mixture appears to be too thin, add, gradually, a little  more sifted flour.      LAFAYETTE GINGERBREAD      Five eggs.    Half a pound of brown sugar.    Half a pound of fresh butter.    A pint of sugar-house molasses    A pound and a half of flour.    Four table-spoonfuls of ginger.    Two large sticks of cinnamon, powered and sifted.    Three dozen grains of allspice, powdered and sifted.    Three dozen of cloves, powdered and sifted.    The juice and grated peel of two large lemons.    A little pearl-ash or salaeratus.    Stir the butter and sugar to a cream. Beat the eggs very well.  Pour the molasses, at once, into the butter and sugar. Add the  ginger and other spice, and stir all well together.    Put in the egg and flour alternately, stirring all the time. Stir  the whole very hard, and put in the lemon at the last. When the  whole is mixed, stir it till very light.    Butter an earthen pan, or a thick tin or iron one, and put the  gingerbread in it. Bake it in a moderate oven, an hour or more,  according to its thickness. Take care that it do not burn.    Or you may bake it in small cakes, or little tins.    Its lightness will be much improved by a small tea-spoonful of  pearl-ash dissolved in a tea-spoonful of vinegar, and stirred  lightly in at the last. [Footnote: If the pearl-ash is strong,  half a tea-spoonful will be sufficient, or less even will do. It  is better stir the pearl-ash in, a little at a time, and you can  tell by the taste of the mixture, when there is enough.] Too much  pearl-ash, will give it an unpleasant taste.    If you use pearl-ash, you must omit the lemon, as its taste will  be entirely destroyed by the pearl-ash. You may substitute for the  lemon, some raisins and currants, well floured to prevent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6684"],[0,"Uneasy Money (#9)"],[1,"development which Bill had not  foreseen, and he was feeling baffled. What was the next step? He  had smoked many pipes in the endeavour to find an answer to this  problem, and was lighting another when the door-bell rang.    He opened the door and found himself confronting an extraordinarily  tall and thin young man in evening-dress.    Lord Dawlish was a little startled. He had taken it for granted,  when the bell rang, that his visitor was Tom, the liftman from  downstairs, a friendly soul who hailed from London and had been  dropping in at intervals during the past two days to acquire the  latest news from his native land. He stared at this changeling  inquiringly. The solution of the mystery came with the stranger's  first words--    'Is Gates in?'    He spoke eagerly, as if Gates were extremely necessary to his  well-being. It distressed Lord Dawlish to disappoint him, but  there was nothing else to be done.    'Gates is in London,' he said.    'What! When did he go there?'    'About four months ago.'    'May I come in a minute?'    'Yes, rather, do.'    He led the way into the sitting-room. The stranger gave abruptly  in the middle, as if he were being folded up by some invisible  agency, and in this attitude sank into a chair, where he lay back  looking at Bill over his knees, like a sorrowful sheep peering  over a sharp-pointed fence.    'You're from England, aren't you?'    'Yes.'    'Been in New York long?'    'Only a couple of days.'    The stranger folded himself up another foot or so until his knees  were higher than his head, and lit a cigarette.    'The curse of New York,' he said, mournfully, 'is the way  everything changes in it. You can't take your eyes off it for a  minute. The population's always shifting. It's like a railway  station. You go away for a bit and come back and try to find your  old pals, and they're all gone: Ike's in Arizona, Mike's in a  sanatorium, Spike's in jail, and nobody seems to know where the  rest of them have got to. I came up from the country two days ago,  expecting to find the old gang along Broadway the same as ever,  and I'm dashed if I've been able to put my hands on one of them!  Not a single, solitary one of them! And it's only six months since  I was here last.'    Lord Dawlish made sympathetic noises.    'Of course,' proceeded the other, 'the time of year may have  something to do with it. Living down in the country you lose count  of time, and I forgot that it was July, when people go out of the  city. I guess that must be what happened. I used to know all sorts  of fellows, actors and fellows like that, and they're all away  somewhere. I tell you,' he said, with pathos, 'I never knew I  could be so infernally lonesome as I have been these last two  days. If I had known what a rotten time I was going to have I  would never have left Brookport.'    'Brookport!'    'It's a place down on Long Island.'    Bill was not by nature a plotter, but the mere fact of travelling  under an assumed name had developed a streak of wariness in him.  He checked himself just as he was about to ask his companion if he  happened to know a Miss Elizabeth Boyd, who also lived at  Brookport. It occurred to him that the question would invite a  counter-question as to his own knowledge of Miss Boyd, and he knew  that he would not be able to invent a satisfactory answer to that  offhand.    'This evening,' said the thin young man, resuming his dirge, 'I  was sweating my brain to try to think of somebody I could hunt up  in this ghastly, deserted city. It isn't so easy, you know, to  think of fellows' names and addresses. I can get the names all  right, but unless the fellow's in the telephone-book, I'm done.  Well, I was trying to think of some of my pals who might still be  around the place, and I remembered Gates. Remembered his address,  too, by a miracle. You're a pal of his, of course?'    'Yes, I knew him in London.'    'Oh, I see. And when you came over here he lent you his flat? By  the way, I didn't get your name?'    'My name's Chalmers.'    'Well, as I say, I remembered Gates and came down here to look him  up. We used to have a lot of good times together a year ago. And  now he's gone too!'    'Did you want to see him about anything important?'    'Well, it's important to me. I wanted him to come out to supper.  You see, it's this way: I'm giving supper to-night to a girl who's  in that show at the Forty-ninth Street Theatre, a Miss Leonard,  and she insists on bringing a pal. She says the pal is a good  sport, which sounds all right--' Bill admitted that it sounded all  right. 'But it makes the party three. And of all the infernal  things a party of three is the ghastliest.'    Having delivered himself of this undeniable truth the stranger  slid a little farther into his chair and paused. 'Look here, what  are you doing to-night?' he said.    'I was thinking of going to bed.'    'Going to bed!' The stranger's voice was shocked, as if he had  heard blasphemy. 'Going to bed at half-past ten in New York! My  dear chap, what you want is a bit of supper. Why don't you come  along?'    Amiability was, perhaps, the leading quality of Lord Dawlish's  character. He did not want to have to dress and go out to supper,  but there was something almost pleading in the eyes that looked at  him between the sharply-pointed knees.    'It's awfully good of you--' He hesitated.    'Not a bit; I wish you would. You would be a life-saver.'    Bill felt that he was in for it. He got up.    'You will?' said the other. 'Good boy! You go and get into some  clothes and come along. I'm sorry, what did you say your name  was?'    'Chalmers.'    'Mine's Boyd--Nutcombe Boyd.'    'Boyd!' cried Bill.    Nutty took his astonishment, which was too great to be concealed,  as a compliment. He chuckled.    'I thought you would know the name if you were a pal of Gates's. I  expect he's always talking about me. You see, I was pretty well  known in this old place before I had to leave it.'    Bill walked down the long passage to his bedroom with no trace of  the sleepiness which had been weighing on him five minutes before.  He was galvanized by a superstitious thrill. It was fate,  Elizabeth Boyd's brother turning up like this and making friendly  overtures right on top of that letter from her. This astonishing  thing could not have been better arranged if he had planned it  himself. From what little he had seen of Nutty he gathered that  the latter was not hard to make friends with. It would be a simple  task to cultivate his acquaintance. And having done so, he could  renew negotiations with Elizabeth. The desire to rid himself of  half the legacy had become a fixed idea with Bill. He had the  impression that he could not really feel clean again until he had  made matters square with his conscience in this respect. He felt  that he was probably a fool to take that view of the thing, but  that was the way he was built and there was no getting away from  it.    This irruption of Nutty Boyd into his life was an omen. It meant  that all was not yet over. He was conscious of a mild surprise  that he had ever intended to go to bed. He felt now as if he never  wanted to go to bed again. He felt exhilarated.    In these days one cannot say that a supper-party is actually given  in any one place. Supping in New York has become a peripatetic  pastime. The supper-party arranged by Nutty Boyd was scheduled to  start at Reigelheimer's on Forty-second Street, and it was there  that the revellers assembled.    Nutty and Bill had been there a few minutes when Miss Daisy  Leonard arrived with her friend. And from that moment Bill was  never himself again.    The Good Sport was, so to speak, an outsize in Good Sports. She  loomed up behind the small and demure Miss Leonard like a liner  towed by a tug. She was big, blonde, skittish, and exuberant; she  wore a dress like the sunset of a fine summer evening, and she  effervesced with spacious good will to all men. She was one of  those girls who splash into public places like stones into quiet  pools. Her form was large, her eyes were large, her teeth were  large, and her voice was large. She overwhelmed Bill. She hit his  astounded consciousness like a shell. She gave him a buzzing in  the ears. She was not so much a Good Sport as some kind of an  explosion.    He was still reeling from the spiritual impact with this female  tidal wave when he became aware, as one who, coming out of a  swoon, hears voices faintly, that he was being addressed by Miss  Leonard. To turn from Miss Leonard's friend to Miss Leonard  herself was like hearing the falling of gentle rain after a  thunderstorm. For a moment he revelled in the sense of being  soothed; then, as he realized what she was saying, he started  violently. Miss Leonard was looking at him curiously.    'I beg your pardon?' said Bill.    'I'm sure I've met you before, Mr Chalmers.'    'Er--really?'    'But I can't think where.'    'I'm sure,' said the Good Sport, languishingly, like a sentimental  siege-gun, 'that if I had ever met Mr Chalmers before I shouldn't  have forgotten him.'    'You're English, aren't you?' asked Miss Leonard.    'Yes.'    The Good Sport said she was crazy about Englishmen.    'I thought so from your voice.'    The Good Sport said that she was crazy about the English accent.    'It must have been in London that I met you. I was in the revue at  the Alhambra last year.'    'By George, I wish I had seen you!' interjected the infatuated  Nutty.    The Good Sport said that she was crazy about London.    'I seem to remember,' went on Miss Leonard, 'meeting you out at  supper. Do you know a man named Delaney in the Coldstream Guards?'    Bill would have liked to deny all knowledge of Delaney, though the  latter was one of his best friends, but his natural honesty  prevented him.    'I'm sure I met you at a supper he gave at Oddy's one Friday  night. We all went on to Covent Garden. Don't you remember?'   "]]]
