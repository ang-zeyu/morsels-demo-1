Was he descended from King  Richard's favourite?\"    \"He had no pretensions,\" he said, \"to call himself a whelp of that  litter; his father was a north-of-England gentleman. He was at present  travelling to Fairport (the town near to which Monkbarns was situated),  and, if he found the place agreeable, might perhaps remain there for  some weeks.\"    \"Was Mr. Lovel's excursion solely for pleasure?\"    \"Not entirely.\"    \"Perhaps on business with some of the commercial people of Fairport?\"    \"It was partly on business, but had no reference to commerce.\"    Here he paused; and Mr. Oldbuck, having pushed his inquiries as far  as good manners permitted, was obliged to change the conversation. The  Antiquary, though by no means an enemy to good cheer, was a determined  foe to all unnecessary expense on a journey; and upon his companion  giving a hint concerning a bottle of port wine, he drew a direful  picture of the mixture, which, he said, was usually sold under that  denomination, and affirming that a little punch was more genuine and  better suited for the season, he laid his hand upon the bell to order  the materials. But Mackitchinson had, in his own mind, settled their  beverage otherwise, and appeared bearing in his hand an immense double  quart bottle, or magnum, as it is called in Scotland, covered with  saw-dust and cobwebs, the warrants of its antiquity.    \"Punch!\" said he, catching that generous sound as he entered the  parlour, \"the deil a drap punch ye'se get here the day, Monkbarns, and  that ye may lay your account wi'.\"    \"What do you mean, you impudent rascal?\"    \"Ay, ay, it's nae matter for that--but do you mind the trick ye served me  the last time ye were here!\"    \"I trick you!\"    \"Ay, just yoursell, Monkbarns. The Laird o' Tamlowrie and Sir Gilbert  Grizzlecleuch, and Auld Rossballoh, and the Bailie, were just setting in  to make an afternoon o't, and you, wi' some o' your auld-warld stories,  that the mind o' man canna resist, whirl'd them to the back o' beyont to  look at the auld Roman camp--Ah, sir!\" turning to Lovel, \"he wad wile the  bird aff the tree wi' the tales he tells about folk lang syne--and did  not I lose the drinking o' sax pints o' gude claret, for the deil ane  wad hae stirred till he had seen that out at the least?\"    \"D'ye hear the impudent scoundrel!\" said Monkbarns, but laughing at  the same time; for the worthy landlord, as he used to boast, know the  measure of a guest's foot as well as e'er a souter on this side Solway;  \"well, well, you may send us in a bottle of port.\"    \"Port! na, na! ye maun leave port and punch to the like o' us, it's  claret that's fit for you lairds; and, I dare say, nane of the folk ye  speak so much o' ever drank either of the twa.\"    \"Do you hear how absolute the knave is? Well, my young friend, we must  for once prefer the Falernian to the vile Sabinum.\"    The ready landlord had the cork instantly extracted, decanted the wine  into a vessel of suitable capaciousness, and, declaring it parfumed the  very room, left his guests to make the most of it.    Mackitchinson's wine was really good, and had its effect upon the  spirits of the elder guest, who told some good stories, cut some sly  jokes, and at length entered into a learned discussion concerning the  ancient dramatists; a ground on which he found his new acquaintance  so strong, that at length he began to suspect he had made them his  professional study. \"A traveller partly for business and partly for  pleasure?--why, the stage partakes of both; it is a labour to the  performers, and affords, or is meant to afford, pleasure to the  spectators. He seems, in manner and rank, above the class of young men  who take that turn; but I remember hearing them say, that the little  theatre at Fairport was to open with the performance of a young  gentleman, being his first appearance on any stage.--If this should be  thee, Lovel!--Lovel? yes, Lovel or Belville are just the names which  youngsters are apt to assume on such occasions--on my life, I am sorry  for the lad.\"    Mr. Oldbuck was habitually parsimonious, but in no respects mean; his  first thought was to save his fellow-traveller any part of the expense  of the entertainment, which he supposed must be in his situation more  or less inconvenient. He therefore took an opportunity of settling  privately with Mr. Mackitchinson. The young traveller remonstrated  against his liberality, and only acquiesced in deference to his years  and respectability.    The mutual satisfaction which they found in each other's society induced  Mr. Oldbuck to propose, and Lovel willingly to accept, a scheme for  travelling together to the end of their journey. Mr. Oldbuck intimated  a wish to pay two-thirds of the hire of a post-chaise, saying, that a  proportional quantity of room was necessary to his accommodation; but  this Mr. Lovel resolutely declined. Their expense then was mutual,  unless when Lovel occasionally slipt a shilling into the hand of a  growling postilion; for Oldbuck, tenacious of ancient customs, never  extended his guerdon beyond eighteen-pence a stage. In this manner they  travelled, until they arrived at Fairport* about two o'clock on the  following day.    * [The \"Fairport\" of this novel is supposed to refer to the town of *  Arbroath, in Forfarshire, and \"Musselcrag,\" post, to the fishing village  of * Auchmithie, in the same county.]    Lovel probably expected that his travelling companion would have invited  him to dinner on his arrival; but his consciousness of a want of ready  preparation for unexpected guests, and perhaps some other reasons,  prevented Oldbuck from paying him that attention. He only begged to  see him as early as he could make it convenient to call in a forenoon,  recommended him to a widow who had apartments to let, and to a person  who kept a decent ordinary; cautioning both of them apart, that he only  knew Mr. Lovel as a pleasant companion in a post-chaise, and did not  mean to guarantee any bills which he might contract while residing at  Fairport. The young gentleman's figure and manners; not to mention  a well-furnished trunk, which soon arrived by sea, to his address  at Fairport, probably went as far in his favour as the limited  recommendation of his fellow-traveller.          CHAPTER THIRD.                     He had a routh o' auld nick-nackets,                   Rusty airn caps, and jinglin-jackets,                 Would held the Loudons three in tackets,                              A towmond gude;                 And parritch-pats, and auld sayt-backets,                             Afore the flude.                                             Burns.    After he had settled himself in his new apartments at Fairport,  Mr. Lovel bethought him of paying the requested visit to his  fellow-traveller. He did not make it earlier, because, with all the old  gentleman's good-humour and information, there had sometimes glanced  forth in his language and manner towards him an air of superiority,  which his companion considered as being fully beyond what the difference  of age warranted. He therefore waited the arrival of his baggage from  Edinburgh, that he might arrange his dress according to the fashion  of the day, and make his exterior corresponding to the rank in society  which he supposed or felt himself entitled to hold.    It was the fifth day after his arrival, that, having made the necessary  inquiries concerning the road, he went forth to pay his respects at  Monkbarns. A footpath leading over a heathy hill, and through two  or three meadows, conducted him to this mansion, which stood on the  opposite side of the hill aforesaid, and commanded a fine prospect of  the bay and shipping. Secluded from the town by the rising ground, which  also screened it from the north-west wind, the house had a solitary, and  sheltered appearance. The exterior had little to recommend it. It was an  irregular old-fashioned building, some part of which had belonged to a  grange, or solitary farm-house, inhabited by the bailiff, or steward,  of the monastery, when the place was in possession of the monks. It  was here that the community stored up the grain, which they received  as ground-rent from their vassals; for, with the prudence belonging to  their order, all their conventional revenues were made payable in kind,  and hence, as the present proprietor loved to tell, came the name of  Monkbarns. To the remains of the bailiff's house, the succeeding  lay inhabitants had made various additions in proportion to the  accommodation required by their families; and, as this was done with  an equal contempt of convenience within and architectural regularity  without, the whole bore the appearance of a hamlet which had suddenly  stood still when in the act of leading down one of Amphion's, or  Orpheus's, country dances. It was surrounded by tall clipped hedges of  yew and holly, some of which still exhibited the skill of the topiarian  artist,* and presented curious arm-chairs, towers, and the figures of  Saint George and the Dragon.    * Ars Topiaria, the art of clipping yew-hedges into fantastic figures.  A Latin poem, entitled Ars Topiaria, contains a curious account of the  process.    The taste of Mr. Oldbuck did not disturb these monuments of an art now  unknown, and he was the less tempted so to do, as it must necessarily  have broken the heart of the old gardener. One tall embowering holly  was, however, sacred from the shears; and, on a garden seat beneath its  shade, Lovel beheld his old friend with spectacles on nose, and pouch on  side, busily employed in perusing the London Chronicle, soothed by the  summer breeze through the rustling leaves, and the distant dash of the  waves as they rippled upon the sand.    Mr. Oldbuck immediately rose, and advanced to greet his travelling  acquaintance with a hearty shake of the hand. \"By"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7010"],[0,"Graded Lessons in English (#9)"],[1,"fiers; the other, for the _and_  connecting the two _phrase_ modifiers.    +Written Parsing+.

PUNCTUATION AND CAPITAL LETTERS.    +COMMA--RULE.--Phrases that are placed out of their natural order  [Footnote: A phrase in its natural order follows the word it modifies.] and  made emphatic, or that are loosely connected with the rest of the sentence,  should be set off by the comma+.

SENTENCE-BUILDING.    +To the Teacher.--+Call attention to the agreement of verbs with compound  subjects. Require the pupils to justify the verb-forms in Lesson 36 and  elsewhere. See Notes, pp. 165-167.    Write _predicates_ for the following _compound subjects_.    Snow and hail; leaves and branches; a soldier or a sailor; London and  Paris.    Write _compound predicates_ for the following _subjects_.    The sun; water; fish; steamboats; soap; farmers; fences; clothes.    Write _subjects_ for the following _compound predicates_.    Live, feel, and grow; judges and rewards; owes and pays; inhale and exhale;  expand and contract; flutters and alights; fly, buzz, and sting; restrain  or punish.    Write _compound subjects_ before the following _predicates_.    May be seen; roar; will be appointed; have flown; has been recommended.    _Write compound predicates_ after the following _compound subjects_.    Boys, frogs, and horses; wood, coal, and peat; Maine and New Hampshire;  Concord, Lexington, and Bunker Hill; pins, tacks, and needles.    Write _compound subjects_ before the following _compound predicates_.    Throb and ache; were tried, condemned, and hanged; eat, sleep, and dress.    Choose your own material and write five sentences, each having a _compound  subject_ and a _compound predicate_.          LESSON 39.    COMPLEMENTS.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--When we say, _The sun gives_, we express no  complete thought. The subject _sun_ is complete, but the predicate _gives_  does not make a complete assertion. When we say, _The sun gives light_, we  do utter a complete thought. The predicate _gives_ is completed by the word  _light_. Whatever fills out, or _completes_, we call a +Complement+. We  will therefore call _light_ the complement of the predicate. As _light_  completes the predicate by naming the thing acted upon, we call it the  +Object Complement+.    Expressions like the following may be written on the board, and by a series  of questions the pupils may be made to dwell upon these facts till they are  thoroughly understood.    The officer arrested -----;  the boy found -----;  Charles saw -----;  coopers make -----.    Besides these verbs requiring object complements, there are others that do  not make complete sense without the aid of a complement of _another_  kind.    A complete predicate does the asserting and expresses what is asserted. In  the sentence, _Armies march_, _march_ is a complete predicate, for it does  the asserting and expresses what is asserted; viz., _marching_. In the  phrase, _armies marching_, _marching_ expresses the same act as that  denoted by _march_, but it _asserts_ nothing. In the sentence, _Chalk is  white_, _is_ does the asserting, but it does not express what is asserted.  We do not wish to assert merely that chalk _is_ or _exists_. What we wish  to assert of chalk, is the quality expressed by the adjective _white_. As  _white_ expresses a quality or attribute, we may call it an +Attribute  Complement+.    Using expressions like the following, let the facts given above be drawn  from the class by means of questions.    Grass growing; grass grows; green grass; grass is green.    +DEFINITION.--The _Object Complement of a sentence_ completes the  predicate, and names that which receives the act+.    +DEFINITION.--The _Attribute Complement_ of a sentence completes the  predicate and belongs to the subject+.    The complement with all its modifiers is called the +_Modified  Complement_+.    Analysis and Parsing.    +Model+.--_Fulton invented the first steamboat_.     Fulton | invented | steamboat  ========|======================          |             \\      \\                         \\the   \\first    +Explanation of the Diagram+.--You will see that the line standing for the  _object complement_ is a continuation of the predicate line, and that the  little vertical line only touches this without cutting it.    +Oral Analysis.--+_Fulton_ and _invented_, as before. _Steamboat_ is the  _object complement_, because it completes the predicate, and names that  which receives the act. _The_ and _first_, as before. _The first steamboat_  is the _modified complement_.    1. Caesar crossed the Rubicon.  2. Morse invented the telegraph.  3. Ericsson built the Monitor.  4. Hume wrote a history.  5. Morn purples the east,  6. Antony beheaded Cicero.    +Model+.--_Gold is malleable_.    Gold | is \\ malleable  =====|===============       |    In this diagram, the line standing for the _attribute complement_,  like the _object line_, is a continuation of the predicate line; but  notice the difference in the little mark separating the  _incomplete_[Footnote: Hereafter we shall call the _verb_ the  _predicate_, but, when followed by a complement, it must be regarded  as an _incomplete_ predicate.] predicate from the complement.    +Oral Analysis+.---_Gold_ and _is_, as before.    _Malleable_ is the _attribute complement_, because it completes  the predicate, and expresses a quality belonging to gold.    7. Pure water is tasteless.  8. The hare is timid.  9. Fawns are graceful.  10. This peach is delicious.  11. He was extremely prodigal.  12. The valley of the Mississippi is very fertile.    +To the Teacher+--See Notes, pp. 183,184.           *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 40.

I feel badly.  Marble feels coldly.  She looks nicely.  It was sold cheaply.  It appears still more plainly.  That sounds harshly.  I arrived at home safely.    +Caution+.--_Adjectives_ must not be used _for adverbs_.    ERRORS TO BE CORRECTED.    The bells ring merry.  The curtain hangs graceful.  That is a decided weak point.
