The movement was organised in Sweden a quarter of a century ago  as an effort to prevent the extinction by machinery of peasant home  industry during the long winter night. Home sloyd was installed in an  institution of its own for training teachers at Naeaes. It works in wood  only, with little machinery, and is best developed for children of  from eleven to fifteen. It no longer aims to make artisans; but its  manipulations are meant to be developmental, to teach both sexes not  only to be useful but self-active and self-respecting, and to revere  exactness as a form of truthfulness. It assumes that all and  especially the motor-minded can really understand only what they make,  and that one can work like a peasant and think like a philosopher. It  aims to produce wholes rather than parts like the Russian system, and  to be so essentially educational that, as a leading exponent says, its  best effects would be conserved if the hands were cut off. This change  of its original utilitarianism from the lower to the liberal motor  development of the middle and upper classes and from the land where it  originated to another, has not eliminated the dominant marks of its  origin in its models, the Penates of the sloyd household, the unique  features of which persist like a national school of art, despite  transplantation and transformation.[1]    Sloyd at its best tries to correlate several series, viz., exercises,  tools, drawing, and models. Each must be progressive, so that every  new step in each series involves a new and next developmental step in  all the others, and all together, it is claimed, fit the order and  degree of development of each power appealed to in the child. Yet  there has been hardly an attempt to justify either the physiological  or the psychological reason of a single step in any of these series,  and the coordination of the series even with each other, to say  nothing of their adaptation to the stages of the child's development.  This, if as pat and complete as is urged, would indeed constitute on  the whole a paragon of all the harmony, beauty, totality in variety,  etc., which make it so magnificent in the admirer's eyes. But the \"45  tools, 72 exercises, 31 models, 15 of which are joints,\" all learned  by teachers in one school year of daily work and by pupils in four  years, are overmethodic; and such correlation is impossible in so many  series at once. Every dual order, even of work and unfoldment of  powers, is hard enough, since the fall lost us Eden; and woodwork,  could it be upon that of the tree of knowledge itself, incompatible  with enjoying its fruit. Although a philosopher may see the whole  universe in its smallest part, all his theory can not reproduce  educational wholes from fragments of it. The real merits of sloyd have  caused its enthusiastic leaders to magnify its scope and claims far  beyond their modest bounds; and although its field covers the great  transition from childhood to youth, one searches in vain both its  literature and practise for the slightest recognition of the new  motives and methods that puberty suggests. Especially in its partially  acclimatized forms to American conditions, it is all adult and almost  scholastic; and as the most elaborate machinery may sometimes be run  by a poor power-wheel, if the stream be swift and copious enough, so  the mighty rent that sets toward motor education would give it some  degree of success were it worse and less economic of pedagogic  momentum than it is. It holds singularly aloof from other methods of  efferent training and resists coordination with them, and its  provisions for other than hand development are slight. It will be one  of the last to accept its true but modest place as contributing  certain few but precious elements in the greater synthesis that  impends. Indian industries, basketry, pottery, bead, leather, bows and  arrows, bark, etc., which our civilization is making lost arts by  forcing the white man's industries upon red men at reservation schools  and elsewhere, need only a small part of the systemization that  Swedish peasant work has received to develop even greater educational  values; and the same is true of the indigenous household work of the  old New England farm, the real worth and possibilities of which are  only now, and perhaps too late, beginning to be seen by a few  educators.    This brings us to the arts and crafts movement, originating with  Carlyle's gospel of work and Ruskin's medievalism, developed by  William Morris and his disciples at the Red House, checked awhile by  the ridicule of the comic opera \"Patience,\" and lately revived in some  of its features by Cobden-Sanderson, and of late to some extent in  various centers in this country. Its ideal was to restore the day of  the seven ancient guilds and of Hans Sachs, the poet cobbler, when  conscience and beauty inspired work, and the hand did what machines  only imitate and vulgarize. In the past, which this school of motor  culture harks back to, work, for which our degenerate age lacks even  respect, was indeed praise. Refined men and women have remembered  these early days, when their race was in its prime, as a lost paradise  which they would regain by designing and even weaving tapestries and  muslins; experimenting in vats with dyes to rival Tyrian purple;  printing and binding by hand books that surpass the best of the  Aldine, and Elzevirs; carving in old oak; hammering brass; forging  locks, irons, and candlesticks; becoming artists in burned wood and  leather; seeking old effects of simplicity and solidity in furniture  and decoration, as well as architecture, stained glass, and to some  extent in dress and manners; and all this toil and moil was _ad  majorem gloriam hominis_ [To the greater glory of man] in a new  socialistic state, where the artist, and even the artisan, should take  his rightful place above the man who merely knows. The day of the mere  professor, who deals in knowledge, is gone; and the day of the doer,  who creates, has come. The brain and the hand, too long divorced and  each weak and mean without the other; use and beauty, each alone  vulgar; letters and labor, each soulless without the other, are  henceforth to be one and inseparable; and this union will lift man to  a higher level. The workman in his apron and paper hat, inspired by  the new socialism and the old spirit of chivalry as revived by Scott,  revering Wagner's revival of the old _Deutschenthum_ that was to  conquer _Christenthum_, or Tennyson's Arthurian cycle--this was its  ideal; even as the Jews rekindled their loyalty to the ancient  traditions of their race and made their Bible under Ezra; as we begin  to revere the day of the farmer-citizen, who made our institutions, or  as some of us would revive his vanishing industrial life for the red  man.    Although this movement was by older men and women and had in it  something of the longing regret of senescence for days that are no  more, it shows us the glory which invests racial adolescence when it  is recalled in maturity, the time when the soul can best appreciate  the value of its creations and its possibilities, and really lives  again in its glamour and finds in it its greatest inspiration. Hence  it has its lessons for us here. A touch, but not too much of it,  should be felt in all manual education, which is just as capable of  idealism as literary education. This gives soul, interest, content,  beauty, taste. If not a polyphrastic philosophy seeking to dignify the  occupation of the workshop by a pretentious Volapuek of reasons and  abstract theories, we have here the pregnant suggestion of a  psychological quarry of motives and spirit opened and ready to be  worked. Thus the best forces from the past should be turned on to  shape and reinforce the best tendencies of the present. The writings  of the above gospelers of work not only could and should, but will be  used to inspire manual-training high schools, sloyd and even some of  the less scholastic industrial courses; but each is incomplete without  the other. These books and those that breathe their spirit should be  the mental workshop of all who do tool, lathe, and forge work; who  design and draw patterns, carve or mold; or of those who study how to  shape matter for human uses, and whose aim is to obtain diplomas or  certificates of fitness to teach all such things. The muse of art and  even of music will have some voice in the great synthesis which is to  gather up the scattered, hence ineffective, elements of secondary  motor training, in forms which shall represent all the needs of  adolescents in the order and proportion that nature and growth stages  indicate, drawing, with this end supreme, upon all the resources that  history and reform offer to our selection. All this can never make  work become play. Indeed it will and should make work harder and more  unlike play and of another genus, because the former is thus given its  own proper soul and leads its own distinct, but richer, and more  abounding life.    I must not close this section without brief mention of two important  studies that have supplied each a new and important determination  concerning laws of work peculiar to adolescence.    The main telegraphic line requires a speed of over seventy letters per  minute of all whom they will employ. As a sending rate this is not  very difficult and is often attained after two months' practise. This  standard for a receiving rate is harder and later, and inquiry at  schools where it is taught shows that about seventy-five per cent of  those who begin the study fail to reach this speed and so are not  employed. Bryan and Harter[2] explained the rate of improvement in  both sending and receiving, with results represented for one typical  subject in the curve on the following page.

By a quick side step, Tarzan eluded the first swinging clutch of the  lion's paws.  Darting to the beast's side, he leaped upon the tawny  back.  His arms encircled the maned neck, his teeth sank deep into the  brute's flesh.  Roaring, leaping, rolling and struggling, the giant cat  attempted to dislodge this savage enemy, and all the while one great,  brown fist was driving a long keen blade repeatedly into the beast's  side.    During the battle, La regained consciousness.  Spellbound, she stood  above her victim watching the spectacle. It seemed incredible that a  human being could best the king of beasts in personal encounter and yet  before her very eyes there was taking place just such an improbability.    At last Tarzan's knife found the great heart, and with a final,  spasmodic struggle the lion rolled over upon the marble floor, dead.  Leaping to his feet the conqueror placed a foot upon the carcass of his  kill, raised his face toward the heavens, and gave voice to so hideous  a cry that both La and Werper trembled as it reverberated through the  temple.    Then the ape-man turned, and Werper recognized him as the man he had  left for dead in the treasure room.          8    The Escape from Opar      Werper was astounded.  Could this creature be the same dignified  Englishman who had entertained him so graciously in his luxurious  African home?  Could this wild beast, with blazing eyes, and bloody  countenance, be at the same time a man?  Could the horrid, victory cry  he had but just heard have been formed in human throat?    Tarzan was eyeing the man and the woman, a puzzled expression in his  eyes, but there was no faintest tinge of recognition.  It was as though  he had discovered some new species of living creature and was marveling  at his find.    La was studying the ape-man's features.  Slowly her large eyes opened  very wide.    \"Tarzan!\" she exclaimed, and then, in the vernacular of the great apes  which constant association with the anthropoids had rendered the common  language of the Oparians: \"You have come back to me!  La has ignored  the mandates of her religion, waiting, always waiting for Tarzan--for  her Tarzan.  She has taken no mate, for in all the world there was but  one with whom La would mate.  And now you have come back!  Tell me, O  Tarzan, that it is for me you have returned.\"    Werper listened to the unintelligible jargon.  He looked from La to  Tarzan.  Would the latter understand this strange tongue?  To the  Belgian's surprise, the Englishman answered in a language evidently  identical to hers.    \"Tarzan,\" he repeated, musingly.  \"Tarzan.  The name sounds familiar.\"    \"It is your name--you are Tarzan,\" cried La.    \"I am Tarzan?\" The ape-man shrugged.  \"Well, it is a good name--I know  no other, so I will keep it; but I do not know you.  I did not come  hither for you.  Why I came, I do not know at all; neither do I know  from whence I came.  Can you tell me?\"    La shook her head.  \"I never knew,\" she replied.    Tarzan turned toward Werper and put the same question to him; but in  the language of the great apes.  The Belgian shook his head.    \"I do not understand that language,\" he said in French.    Without effort, and apparently without realizing that he made the  change, Tarzan repeated his question in French.  Werper suddenly came  to a full realization of the magnitude of the injury of which Tarzan  was a victim.  The man had lost his memory--no longer could he  recollect past events.  The Belgian was upon the point of enlightening  him, when it suddenly occurred to him that by keeping Tarzan in  ignorance, for a time at least, of his true identity, it might be  possible to turn the ape-man's misfortune to his own advantage.    \"I cannot tell you from whence you came,\" he said; \"but this I can tell  you--if we do not get out of this horrible place we shall both be slain  upon this bloody altar.  The woman was about to plunge her knife into  my heart when the lion interrupted the fiendish ritual.  Come!  Before  they recover from their fright and reassemble, let us find a way out of  their damnable temple.\"    Tarzan turned again toward La.    \"Why,\" he asked, \"would you have killed this man?  Are you hungry?\"    The High Priestess cried out in disgust.    \"Did he attempt to kill you?\" continued Tarzan.    The woman shook her head.    \"Then why should you have wished to kill him?\" Tarzan was determined to  get to the bottom of the thing.    La raised her slender arm and pointed toward the sun.    \"We were offering up his soul as a gift to the Flaming God,\" she said.    Tarzan looked puzzled.  He was again an ape, and apes do not understand  such matters as souls and Flaming Gods.    \"Do you wish to die?\" he asked Werper.    The Belgian assured him, with tears in his eyes, that he did not wish  to die.    \"Very well then, you shall not,\" said Tarzan.  \"Come!  We will go.  This SHE would kill you and keep me for herself.  It is no place anyway  for a Mangani.  I should soon die, shut up behind these stone walls.\"    He turned toward La.  \"We are going now,\" he said.    The woman rushed forward and seized the ape-man's hands in hers.    \"Do not leave me!\" she cried.  \"Stay, and you shall be High Priest.  La  loves you.  All Opar shall be yours.  Slaves shall wait upon you.  Stay, Tarzan of the Apes, and let love reward you.\"    The ape-man pushed the kneeling woman aside.  \"Tarzan does not desire  you,\" he said, simply, and stepping to Werper's side he cut the  Belgian's bonds and motioned him to follow.    Panting--her face convulsed with rage, La sprang to her feet.    \"Stay, you shall!\" she screamed.  \"La will have you--if she cannot have  you alive, she will have you dead,\" and raising her face to the sun she  gave voice to the same hideous shriek that Werper had heard once before  and Tarzan many times.    In answer to her cry a babel of voices broke from the surrounding  chambers and corridors.    \"Come, Guardian Priests!\" she cried.  \"The infidels have profaned the  holiest of the holies.  Come!  Strike terror to their hearts; defend La  and her altar; wash clean the temple with the blood of the polluters.\"    Tarzan understood, though Werper did not.  The former glanced at the  Belgian and saw that he was unarmed.  Stepping quickly to La's side the  ape-man seized her in his strong arms and though she fought with all  the mad savagery of a demon, he soon disarmed her, handing her long,  sacrificial knife to Werper.    \"You will need this,\" he said, and then from each doorway a horde of  the monstrous, little men of Opar streamed into the temple.    They were armed with bludgeons and knives, and fortified in their  courage by fanatical hate and frenzy.  Werper was terrified.  Tarzan  stood eyeing the foe in proud disdain. Slowly he advanced toward the  exit he had chosen to utilize in making his way from the temple.  A  burly priest barred his way.  Behind the first was a score of others.  Tarzan swung his heavy spear, clublike, down upon the skull of the  priest.  The fellow collapsed, his head crushed.    Again and again the weapon fell as Tarzan made his way slowly toward  the doorway.  Werper pressed close behind, casting backward glances  toward the shrieking, dancing mob menacing their rear.  He held the  sacrificial knife ready to strike whoever might come within its reach;  but none came.  For a time he wondered that they should so bravely  battle with the giant ape-man, yet hesitate to rush upon him, who was  relatively so weak.  Had they done so he knew that he must have fallen  at the first charge.  Tarzan had reached the doorway over the corpses  of all that had stood to dispute his way, before Werper guessed at the  reason for his immunity.  The priests feared the sacrificial knife!  Willingly would they face death and welcome it if it came while they  defended their High Priestess and her altar; but evidently there were  deaths, and deaths.  Some strange superstition must surround that  polished blade, that no Oparian cared to chance a death thrust from it,  yet gladly rushed to the slaughter of the ape-man's flaying spear.    Once outside the temple court, Werper communicated his discovery to  Tarzan.  The ape-man grinned, and let Werper go before him, brandishing  the jeweled and holy weapon.  Like leaves before a gale, the Oparians  scattered in all directions and Tarzan and the Belgian found a clear  passage through the corridors and chambers of the ancient temple.    The Belgian's eyes went wide as they passed through the room of the  seven pillars of solid gold.  With ill-concealed avarice he looked upon  the age-old, golden tablets set in the walls of nearly every room and  down the sides of many of the corridors.  To the ape-man all this  wealth appeared to mean nothing.    On the two went, chance leading them toward the broad avenue which lay  between the stately piles of the half-ruined edifices and the inner  wall of the city.  Great apes jabbered at them and menaced them; but  Tarzan answered them after their own kind, giving back taunt for taunt,  insult for insult, challenge for challenge.    Werper saw a hairy bull swing down from a broken column and advance,  stiff-legged and bristling, toward the naked giant.  The yellow fangs  were bared, angry snarls and barkings rumbled threateningly through the  thick and hanging lips.    The Belgian watched his companion.  To his horror, he saw the man stoop  until his closed knuckles rested upon the ground as did those of the  anthropoid.  He saw him circle, stiff-legged about the circling ape.  He heard the same bestial barkings and growlings issue from the human  throat that were coming from the mouth of the brute.  Had his eyes been  closed he could not have known but that two giant apes were bridling  for combat.    But there was no battle.  It ended as the majority of such jungle  encounters end--one of the boasters loses his"]]]
