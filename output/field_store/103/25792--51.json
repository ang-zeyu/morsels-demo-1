The grand master's  authority was considerable, but it was checked by the council, which  was composed of the bailiffs and knights of the highest order, known  as Grand Crosses. Each langue had its bailiff elected by itself: these  resided constantly at Rhodes. Each of these bailiffs held a high office;  thus the Bailiff of Provence was always the grand commander of the  Order. He controlled the expenditure, superintended the stores, and  was governor of the arsenal. The Bailiff of Auvergne was the  commander-in-chief of all the forces, army and navy. The Bailiff of  France was the grand hospitaller, with the supreme direction of the  hospitals and infirmaries of the Order, a hospital in those days  signifying a guest house. The Bailiff of Italy was the grand admiral,  and the Bailiff of England was chief of the light cavalry. Thus the  difficulties and jealousies that would have arisen at every vacancy were  avoided.    In the early days of the Order, when Jerusalem was in the hands of the  Christians, the care of the hospitals was its chief and most important  function. Innumerable pilgrims visited Jerusalem, and these were  entertained at the immense guest house of the Order. But with the loss  of Jerusalem and the expulsion of the Christians from Palestine, that  function had become of very secondary importance although there was  still a guest house and infirmary at Rhodes, where strangers and the  sick were carefully attended by the knights. No longer did these ride  out to battle on their war horses. It was on the sea that the foe was  to be met, and the knights were now sailors rather than soldiers. They  dwelt at the houses of their respective langues; here they ate at a  common table, which was supplied by the bailiff, who drew rations for  each knight, and received, in addition, a yearly sum for the supply of  such luxuries as were not included in the rations. The average number of  knights residing in each of these langues averaged from a hundred to a  hundred and fifty.    It was not until some hours after his arrival that Sir Guy could find  time to take Gervaise across to the house of the langue of Auvergne, to  which D'Aubusson belonged. It was a larger and more stately pile than  that of the English langue, but the arrangements were similar in all  these buildings. In the English house Gervaise had not felt strange, as  he had the companionship of his fellow voyagers; but as he followed  Sir Guy through the spacious halls of the langue of Auvergne, where no  familiar face met his, he felt more lonely than he had done since he  entered the house at Clerkenwell.    On sending in his name Sir Guy was at once conducted to the chamber  occupied by D'Aubusson. The knight was seated at his table, examining  some plans. The room was furnished with monastic simplicity, save that  the walls were hung with rich silks and curtains captured from Turkish  galleys.    \"Welcome back to us, Sir Guy,\" D'Aubusson said, rising, and warmly  shaking his visitor's hand. \"I have been looking for your coming, for we  need men with clear heads. Of strong arms and valiant spirits we have no  lack; but men of judgment and discretion, who can be trusted to look at  matters calmly and not to be carried away by passion, are welcome indeed  to us. I was expecting you about this time, and when I heard that a ship  had arrived from Marseilles I made inquiries, and was glad to find that  you were on board.\"    \"I am heartily glad to be back, D'Aubusson; I am sick of the dull life  of a commandery, and rejoice at the prospect of stirring times again.  This lad is young Tresham, who has come out in my charge, and for  whom you have been good enough to obtain the post of page to the grand  master.\"    \"And no slight business was it to do so,\" D'Aubusson said with a smile.  \"It happened there was a vacancy when the letter concerning him arrived,  and had it been one of the highest offices in the Order there could not  have been a keener contention for it. Every bailiff had his candidate  ready; but I seldom ask for anything for members of my langue, and when  I told the other bailiffs that it was to me a matter of honour to carry  out the last request of my dead friend, they all gave way. You see, I am  placed in a position of some little difficulty. The grand master is  so enfeebled and crippled that he leaves matters almost entirely in  my hands, and it would be an abuse of my position, and would excite no  little jealousy, were I to use the power I possess to nominate friends  of my own to appointments. It is only by the most rigid impartiality,  and by dividing as fairly as possible all offices between the eight  langues, that all continue to give me their support. As you know, we  have had great difficulties and heartburnings here; but happily they  have to a great extent been set at rest by forming a new langue of  Castile and Portugal out of that of Aragon. This has given one more vote  to the smaller langues, and has so balanced the power that of late the  jealousies between us have greatly subsided, and all are working well  together in face of the common danger. Well, young sir, and how like you  the prospect of your pageship?\"    \"I like it greatly, sir, but shall like still more the time when I can  buckle on armour and take a share of the fighting with the infidels. I  would fain, sir, offer to you my deep and humble thanks for the great  kindness you have shown me in procuring me the appointment of page to  the grand master.\"    The knight smiled kindly. \"There are the less thanks due, lad, inasmuch  as I did it not for you, but for the dear friend who wrote to me on your  behalf. However, I trust that you will do credit to my nomination by  your conduct here.\"    \"There is a letter from our grand prior which I have brought to you,\"  Sir Guy said. \"He commended the lad to me warmly, and seems to be  greatly pleased with his conduct.\"    D'Aubusson cut the silken string that bound the missive together, and  read the letter.    \"He does indeed speak warmly,\" he said, as he laid it down on the table.    \"He tells me that the lad, young as he was, had been well trained when  he came, and that he worked with great diligence during the five months  he was in the House, and displayed such skill and strength for his age,  as to surprise his preceptors, who prophesied that he would turn out a  stout swordsman, and would be a credit to the Order.\"    \"He is well furnished with garments both for ordinary and state  occasions,\" Sir Guy said; \"and in this packet are some sixty gold  crowns, which are the last remains of his patrimony, and which I was to  hand to you in order to pay the necessary expenses during his pageship.\"    \"He could have done without that,\" D'Aubusson said. \"Recommended to me  as he is, I would have seen that he lacked nothing, but was provided  with all necessaries for his position. I will in the future take care  that in all things he is on a par with his companions.\" He touched a  bell on the table, and a servitor entered.    \"Tell Richard de Deauville to come here,\" he said.    A minute later the hangings at the door were pushed aside, and a lad  about a year older than Gervaise appeared, and, bowing deeply to the  knight, stood in a respectful attitude, awaiting his orders.    \"Deauville, take this youth, Gervaise Tresham to your room. He is  appointed one of the pages of the grand master. He is English, but he  speaks French as well as you do, having lived in France for some years.  Take him to your apartment and treat him kindly and well, seeing that he  is a stranger and new to all here. Tomorrow he will go to the palace.\"    Gervaise bowed deeply to the two knights, and then followed the page.    \"I suppose you arrived in that ship which came in today,\" the latter  said, as soon as they had left the room. \"You are in luck indeed to have  obtained a pageship at the grand master's. You begin to count your time  at once, while we do not begin to count ours until we are seventeen.  Still, good luck may befall us yet, for if the grand master dies, Sir  Peter is sure to be chosen to succeed him. Then, you see, we too shall  be pages of the grand master.\"    \"How many are there of you?\"    \"Only De Lille and myself. Of course D'Aubusson will take on the grand  master's present pages; but as there are five vacancies on an average  every year, he will be able to find room for us among the number.\"    \"Why, how many pages has the grand master?\" Gervaise asked, in surprise.    \"Sixteen of them, so you may guess the duties are easy enough, as only  two are generally employed, except, of course on solemn occasions.\"    \"Are there any other English besides myself?\"    The boy shook his head. \"There are eight belonging to the French  langues; the others are Spaniards, Italians, or Germans. There, this is  our room and this is De Lille. De Lille, this is the grand master's new  page, Master Gervaise Tresham, and our lord says we are to treat him  kindly and entertain him well until tomorrow, when he will go to the  palace. He speaks our language, and has been some years in France.\"    \"How came you to be there?\" De Lille asked Gervaise.    \"My father was a Lancastrian, and my mother a great friend of our  Queen Margaret of Anjou, and they were with her all the time she was in  exile.\"    \"How quarrelsome you English are!\" De Lille said. \"You seem to be always  fighting among yourselves.\"    \"I don't think,\" Gervaise said, with a smile, \"there is any love lost  between Louis of France and the Duke of Burgundy, to say nothing of  other great lords.\"    \"No; you are right there. But though we talk a great deal about  fighting, it is only occasionally that we engage in it.\"    The pages' room was a small one. It contained two pallets, which  served as seats by day, and two wooden chests, in which they kept their  clothes.    Their conversation was interrupted by the ringing of a bell.    \"Th"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4940"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Senior Year at High School (#9)"],[1," to work the combination.\"    \"It would be the irony of fate if the thief couldn't spend the money  after all his trouble,\" observed Mrs. Harlowe.    \"I hope he never, never can,\" cried Grace. \"I hope he'll bruise all his  knuckles and break all his finger nails trying to open the box, and  still not make the slightest impression!\"    \"He certainly will if he tries to open the box with his finger nails and  knuckles,\" replied her father, as he bestowed two kisses upon his wife  and daughter, respectively, and departed to his business.    \"Who is to be custodian of the fund, Grace? Are you to have charge of  it?\" asked Mrs. Harlowe.    \"No, mother; Marian Barber was formally elected class treasurer last  year. She likes to keep books and add up accounts and all those things.  So I shall just turn the check over to her to put in the bank until we  give our next entertainment. Then, when we have about a thousand  dollars, we'll give it all to Miss Thompson as our contribution toward  rebuilding the gymnasium. I hear that the juniors are going to give a  dance, but I don't think they will make any large amount like this,  because they will have to pay for music and refreshments.\"    Grace could not help feeling proud of the success of the bazaar now that  the judge's check had arrived, although at first she had demurred about  accepting it. However, as the judge absolutely refused to take it back,  it was therefore duly presented to Marian Barber, who, with a feeling of  extreme importance at handling so much money in her own name, deposited  it in the Upton Bank, and was the recipient, for the first time in her  life, of a small, neat-looking check book. Later she showed it with  great glee to the Phi Sigma Tau, who were drinking hot chocolate in the  Harlowe's sitting room, the day after school began.    \"I feel just like a millionaire,\" she exclaimed, \"even though the money  isn't mine. I'd just like to write one check to see how my name would  look signed at the bottom here.\"    \"It does seem like a lot of money,\" observed Anne thoughtfully, \"but I'm  afraid the check book won't be of much use to you, Marian, as you will  probably draw it all out in a lump when the time comes to hand it over  to Miss Thompson.\"    \"Oh, I don't know,\" answered Marian, \"we may have to give a few checks  for expenses and things, the next entertainment we get up, and then I'll  have an opportunity.\"    The girls laughed good-naturedly at Marian's evident eagerness to draw a  check.    \"We'll certainly have to incur some kind of expense for the express  purpose of allowing Marian to draw a check,\" said Nora. \"By the way,  Grace, which booth made the most money, outside the auction, of course?\"    \"Eleanor Savelli's,\" replied Grace promptly. \"They made most of it on  confetti, too, although they sold quantities of flowers. They turned in  seventy-five dollars.\"    \"Eleanor certainly did work,\" observed Anne. \"One feels as though one  could forgive her all her sins after the success she made of her booth.  It is a shame that so much ability and cleverness is choked and crowded  out by wilfulness and temper.\"    \"Did you hear about the quarrel that she and Edna Wright had, after she  attacked us?\" asked Eva Allen.    \"Yes,\" answered Grace. \"I understand, too, that it has completely broken  up their sorority. They carried their part of the bazaar through  together and then Eleanor told Edna that she was practically done with  her.\"    \"You don't mean it! I hadn't heard that! Who told you so?\" were the  exclamations that followed this information.    \"Daisy Culver told Ruth Deane, and Ruth told me,\" said Grace. \"Ruth says  that Edna feels dreadfully over it. She was really fond of Eleanor.\"    \"Now I suppose that Miss Eleanor Vendetta de Savelli will be more  impossible than ever,\" giggled Nora.    \"Perhaps not,\" said Anne quietly. \"I think it a very good thing that  Edna and Eleanor have separated, for Eleanor Savelli is a far better  girl at heart than Edna Wright. Eleanor is better off without her.\"    \"I believe you are right, Anne,\" said Grace with conviction. \"Although  Eleanor's reformation is not for us. We've had experience.\"    \"'Never too late to mend,'\" quoted Jessica.    \"True,\" retorted Nora, \"but for my part I think the Phi Sigma Tau have  done their share toward the mending process.\"    \"Marian Barber!\" exclaimed Grace. \"Where in the world did you unearth  that man you introduced us to, at the bazaar?\"    \"Yes, I should say so,\" echoed Nora. \"I didn't like him one bit.\"    A flush overspread Marian Barber's plain face. She frowned, then said  very stiffly:    \"Really, girls, I can't see why any one should dislike Mr. Hammond. I  think he is a remarkably nice young man. Father and mother like him,  too. He has called to see me twice since the bazaar, and I am going to  the theatre with him to-morrow night. I like him very much better than  any of these silly Oakdale schoolboys,\" she added a trifle maliciously.    The girls listened, thunderstruck. Was this good-natured, easy going  Marian Barber who had spoken? To their knowledge Marian had never before  received attentions from even \"silly schoolboys.\" She was well liked  among girls, but had always fought shy of young men.    \"Forgive me, Marian,\" cried Nora impulsively. \"I didn't dream that you  were interested in Mr. Hammond.\"    \"I am not half as much interested in him as he is interested in me,\"  retorted Marian, bridling. \"He prefers me to any Oakdale girl he has  met.\"    The girls exchanged astonished glances at Marian's complacent statement.    \"Where did you first meet him, Marian?\" asked Anne gently.    \"At the bazaar,\" replied Marian promptly.    \"Who introduced him to you?\" asked Grace curiously.    Marian hesitated a moment, then burst forth defiantly. \"I suppose you  girls will think it perfectly dreadful when I tell you that he  introduced himself. He came up and asked me to tell him about some of  the features of the bazaar. I did, then he went away, and after a while  he came back and talked to me a long time. He is in the real estate  business, and is going to have an office here in Oakdale. He was very  much interested in the things I said to him, and when I told him about  our Phi Sigma Tau he asked to be introduced to you girls. I never  supposed you'd take such a dislike to him. I think he is perfectly  splendid,\" she added with emphasis.    \"Well, I don't agree with you,\" said hot-headed Nora. \"And I don't think  you should have noticed him, beyond being merely civil, without an  introduction. Do you, Grace?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Grace slowly. \"That is a question that no one save  Marian can settle. I don't wish to seem hateful, Marian, but to tell you  the truth, I wasn't favorably impressed with Mr. Hammond. Besides, he is  ever so much older than you are. He must be at least twenty-five years  old.\"    \"He is twenty-nine,\" replied Marian coldly. \"And I am glad that he isn't  as young and foolish as most of the boys I have met.\"    \"Does your mother know how you happened to meet him?\" asked Jessica  unthinkingly.    But this was a little too much. Marian rose to her feet, her voice  choking with anger. \"I don't blame Eleanor Savelli for calling you  busy-bodies,\" she said. \"And I shall be infinitely obliged to you if you  will in future look to your own affairs and stop criticizing me.\"    With these words she rushed from the room, seized her wraps and was out  on the street before any of the remaining girls had fully comprehended  what had happened.          CHAPTER IX    THE JUDGE'S HOUSE PARTY      \"There is nothing like congenial company when one travels,\" remarked  Hippy Wingate, favoring his friends with a patronizing smile. \"Now, when  I came home from college I was obliged to consort with such grouches as  David Nesbit and Reddy Brooks, who made me keep quiet when I wished to  speak, and speak when I fain would have slept. But, observe the  difference, all these fresh and charming damsels--\"    \"Charming we are, beyond a doubt,\" interrupted Nora O'Malley, \"but  fresh--never. The only fresh person aboard is named Wingate.\"    \"If you two are going to disagree we'll bundle you both into the baggage  car and let you fight it out,\" warned David. \"Hippy ought to be exiled  to that particular spot for having reviled Reddy and me.\"    \"Keep quiet, Nora,\" said Hippy in a stage whisper. \"We are in the hands  of desperadoes.\"    It was a merry party who were speeding along their way to the state  capital, for a wonderful visit was to be paid and the Phi Sigma Tau and  their friends were to pay it. In short, Judge Putnam had invited them to  spend Christmas at his beautiful home in the capital city, and for eight  happy days they were to be his guests.    It was in reality Grace's party. The judge had written her, asking her  to select as many guests as she chose. She had also received a prettily  worded note from his sister, who had chaperoned them the previous summer  in the Adirondacks, and who had taken charge of the judge's home in the  capital for years.    Grace had at once invited the Phi Sigma Tau, and dispatched special  delivery letters to Hippy, David and Reddy, not forgetting Tom Gray and  Arnold Evans.    In order to make an even number of boys and girls, Grace had invited  James Gardiner, an Oakdale boy, and last of all, very reluctantly, had  sent a note to Mr. Henry Hammond.    This she had done solely to appease Marian Barber's wounded pride. For a  week after the day that Marian had rushed angrily out of Grace's house,  she had refused to go near her sorority. But one afternoon the six  girls, headed by Grace, waylaid her as she was leaving the school and  after much coaxing Marian allowed herself to be brought to a more  reasonable frame of mind.    Then Grace, who honestly regretted having hurt Marian's feelings, had  made an extra effort to treat Mr. Hammond cordially when they chanced to  meet, and her friends had"]]]
