In this way they were    to carry their civilization to the Rhine and the Atlantic, and so    increase greatly the part of the earth where men lived and thought as    the Romans did and as the Greeks had before them. The ancient civilized    world was beginning to move from its older center, the Mediterranean,    toward the shore of the Atlantic.    ANCESTORS OF THE FRENCH AND THE GERMANS. The tribes living in Gaul    were not at that time called French, but Gallic. The Gauls were like the    Britons who lived across the Channel in Britain. The German ancestors of    the English had not yet crossed the North Sea to that land. Beyond the    Rhine lived the Germans, who had but little to do with the Romans and    the Greeks and were still barbarians. The Gauls living farthest away    from the Roman settlements were not much more civilized.      The principal difference between the Germans and the Gauls was that the    Gauls lived in villages and towns and cultivated the land or dug in    mines or traded along the rivers, while the Germans had no towns and    dwelt in clearings of the forest. Their wealth, like that of the early    Romans, was their cattle. The land they cultivated was divided between    them year after year, so that a German owned only his hut and the plot    of ground or garden about it. Some of the towns of the Gauls were placed    on high hills and were protected by strong walls.    THE TERRIBLE GERMANS. The Romans had at first been afraid of the    Gauls, because they had never forgotten how terribly these people had    once defeated them. But since that time they had fought the Gauls so    often that they were losing this fear. They now dreaded more to meet the    Germans, who seemed like giants because they were taller even than    the Gauls.      [Illustration: GALLIC WARRIORS]    GALLIC AND GERMAN WARRIORS. The leaders of the Germans were sometimes    kings and sometimes nobles whom the Romans called _duces_, from which    comes our word duke. The Gallic chieftains were adorned with gold    necklaces, bracelets, and rings. When they went out to battle, they wore    helmets shaped like the head of some ravenous beast, and their bodies    were protected by coats of chain armor made of iron rings. Their    principal weapon was a long, heavy sword. Both German and Gallic nobles    were accompanied by bands of young men, their devoted followers, who    shared the joys of victory or died with them in case of defeat. It was a    disgrace to lose one's sword or to survive if the leader was killed.    HOW THE GERMANS LIVED. When the Germans were not fighting they were    idle, for all work was done by women and slaves. They were great    drinkers and gamblers, and often in their games a man would stake his    freedom upon the result. If he lost, he became the slave of the winner.    The Germans respected their wives, even if they compelled them to do the    hard work. The women sometimes went with the men to battle, and their    cries encouraged the warriors, or if the warriors wavered, the fierce    reproaches of the women drove them back to the fight.    RELIGION OF THE GERMANS. We remember the religion of the Germans    because four days of the week are named for their gods or the gods of    their neighbors across the Baltic. Their principal god was Wodan, or    Odin, god of the sun and the tempest. Wodan's day is Wednesday. Thursday    is named for Thor, the Northmen's god of thunder. The god of war, Tiw,    gave a name to Tuesday, and Frigu, the goddess of love, to Friday. The    German, like his northern neighbors, thought of heaven as the place    where brave warriors who had died in battle spent their days    in feasting.    JULIUS CAESAR. Julius Caesar was the great Roman general who    conquered the Gauls and led the first expeditions across the Rhine into    Germany and over the Channel into Britain. He was a wealthy noble who,    like other nobles, held one office after another until he became consul.    He was also a great political leader, and with two other men controlled    Rome. We should call them \"bosses,\" but the Romans called them    \"triumvirs.\"      [Illustration: JULIUS CAESAR After the bust in the Museum at    Naples]    CAESAR IN GAUL. As soon as Caesar became governor of the province    of southern Gaul, he showed that he was a skilful general as well as a    successful politician. He interfered in the wars between the Gauls,    taking sides with the friends of the Romans. When a large army of    Germans entered Gaul, he defeated it and drove it back across the Rhine.    One war led to another until all the tribes from the country now called    Belgium to the Mediterranean coast professed to be friends of the Roman    people. His campaigns lasted from 58 B.C. for nine years. Two or three    times Caesar was very close to ruin, but by his courage and energy he    always succeeded in gaining the victory.    VERCINGETORIX, GALLIC HERO. The great hero of the Gauls in their    struggle with the Romans was Vercingetorix. He was a young noble who    lived in a mountain town of central Gaul. His father had been killed in    an attempt to make himself king of his native city. Vercingetorix    believed that if the Gauls did not unite against the Romans they would    soon see their lands become Roman provinces. As he knew his army was no    match for the Romans in open fight, he persuaded the Gauls to try to    starve the Romans out of the country. He planned to destroy all village    stores of grain, and to cut off the smaller bands of soldiers which    wandered from the main army in search of food.    CAESAR AND VERCINGETORIX. Vercingetorix found the work of    conquering Caesar in this way too difficult. He was finally driven to    take refuge in Alesia, on a hilltop in eastern Gaul. Here the Romans    prepared to starve him into surrender. They dug miles of deep trenches    about the fortress so that the imprisoned Gauls could not break through.    They dug other trenches to protect themselves from the attacks of a    great army of Gauls which came to rescue Vercingetorix. These trenches    were fifteen or twenty feet wide; they were strengthened by palisades    and ramparts, and filled with water where this was possible. Several    times the Gauls nearly succeeded in breaking through, but the quickness    and stubborn courage of Caesar always saved the day.    DEATH OF VERCINGETORIX. Vercingetorix now proved that he was a real    hero. He offered to give himself up to Caesar, if this would save the    town. But Caesar demanded the submission of all the chiefs. When they    had laid down their arms before the conqueror, Vercingetorix appeared on    a gaily decorated horse. He rode around the throne where Caesar sat,    dismounted in front, took off his armor, and bowed to the ground. His    fate was hard. He was sent to Rome a prisoner, was shown in the    triumphal procession of the victorious Caesar, and was then put to death    in a dungeon. On the site of Alesia stands a monument erected by the    French to the memory of the brave Gallic hero. The defeat of    Vercingetorix ended the resistance of the Gauls, and not many years    afterward their country was added to the long list of Roman provinces.      [Illustration: THE BRIDGE ON WHICH CAESAR'S ARMY CROSSED THE    RHINE]    CAESAR IN GERMANY. Caesar crossed the Rhine into Germany on a bridge    which his engineers built in ten days. He laid waste the fields of the    tribes near the river in order to make the name of Rome feared, and then    returned to Gaul and destroyed the bridge. Twice he sailed over to    Britain, the last time marching a few miles north of where London now    stands. His purpose was to keep the Britons from stirring up the Gauls    to attack him. Other generals many years later conquered Britain as far    as the hills of Scotland.    THE GERMAN HERO HERMANN. The Romans were not fortunate in their    later attempts to conquer a part of Germany. When Caesar's grandnephew    Augustus was master of Rome, he sent an army under Varus into the    forests far from the Rhine. Hermann, a leader of the Germans, gathered    the tribes together and utterly destroyed the army of Varus. Whenever    Augustus thought of this dreadful disaster, he would cry out, \"O Varus,    give me back my legions!\" The Rhine and the Danube became the northern    boundaries of the Roman conquests.    GAULS AND BRITONS BECOME ROMAN. Although the Gauls had fought    stubbornly against Caesar they soon became as Roman as the Italians    themselves. They ceased to speak their own language and began to use    Latin. They mastered Latin so thoroughly that their schools were    sometimes regarded as better than the schools in Italy, and Roman youths    were sent to Gaul to learn how best to speak their own language. The    Britons also became very good Romans. Even the Germans frequently    crossed the Rhine and enlisted in the Roman armies. When they returned    to their own country they carried Roman ideas and customs with them.    THE INTEREST OF AMERICANS IN ROMAN SUCCESSES. For Americans the    influence the Romans exerted in Spain, Gaul, Germany, and Britain is    more important than their work in the eastern Mediterranean, because    from those countries came the early settlers of America. The    civilization which the Romans taught the peoples of western Europe was    to become a valuable part of the civilization of our forefathers.      [Illustration: THE ROMAN EMPIRE AT ITS GREATEST EXTENT IN 395    A.D.]    SIZE OF THE ROMAN WORLD. We may realize how large the world of the    Romans was by observing on a modern map that within its limits lay    modern England, France, Spain, Portugal, the southern part of    Austria-Hungary, Italy, Bulgaria, Greece, the Turkish Empire both in    Europe and Asia, Egypt, Tripoli, Tunis, Algeria, and Morocco. For a time    they also"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9903"],[0,"Way of the Lawless (#9)"],[1,".    \"Do you want me to see the six brave men again?\" she asked, smiling, but  really she was prying at his mind to get a clew of the truth. \"Well,  I'll come down.\"    And she went down the stairs with Charles Merchant beside her; he kept  looking straight ahead, biting his lips, and this made her wonder. She  began to hum a gay little tune, and the first bar made the man start. So  she kept on. She was bubbling with apparent good nature when Charles,  all gravity, opened the door of the living room.    The shades were drawn. The quiet in that room was a deadly, living  thing. And then she saw, on the sofa at one side of the place, a human  form under a sheet.    \"Charles!\" whispered the girl. She put out her hand and touched his  shoulder, but she could not take her eyes off that ghastly dead thing.  \"They--they--he's dead--Andrew Lanning! Why did you bring me here?\"    \"Take the cloth from his face,\" commanded Charles Merchant, and there  was something so hard in his voice that she obeyed.    The sheet came away under her touch, and she was looking into the sallow  face of Bill Dozier. She had remembered him because of the sad  mustaches, that morning, and his big voice.    \"That's what your romantic boy out of a book has done,\" said Charles  Merchant. \"Look at his work!\"    But she dropped the sheet and whirled on him.    \"And they left him--\" she said.    \"Anne,\" said he, \"are you thinking about the safety of that  murderer--now? He's safe, but they'll get him later on; he's as good as  dead, if that's what you want to know.\"    \"God help him!\" said the girl.    And going back a pace, she stood in the thick shadow, leaning against  the wall, with one hand across her lips. It reminded Charles of the  picture he had seen when he broke into her room after Andrew Lanning had  escaped. And she looked now, as, then, more beautiful, more wholly to be  desired than he had ever known her before. Yet he could neither move nor  speak. He saw her go out of the room. Then, without stopping to replace  the sheet, he followed.    He had hoped to wipe the last thought of that vagabond blacksmith out of  her mind with the shock of this horror. Instead, he knew now that he had  done quite another thing. And in addition he had probably made her  despise him for taking her to confront such a sight.    All in all, Charles Merchant was exceedingly thoughtful as he closed  the door and stepped into the hall. He ran up the stairs to her room.  The door was closed. There was no answer to his knock, and by trying the  knob he found that she had locked herself in. And the next moment he  could hear her sobbing. He stood for a moment more, listening, and  wishing Andrew Lanning dead with all his heart.    Then he went down to the garage, climbed into his car, and burned up the  road between his place and that of Hal Dozier. There was very little  similarity between the two brothers. Bill had been tall and lean; Hal  was compact and solid, and he had the fighting agility of a starved  coyote. He had a smooth-shaven face as well, and a clear gray eye, which  was known wherever men gathered in the mountain desert. There was no  news to give him. A telephone message had already told him of the death  of Bill Dozier.    \"But,\" said Charles Merchant, \"there's one thing I can do. I can set you  free to run down this Lanning.\"    \"How?\"    \"You're needed on your ranch, Hal; but I want you to let me stand the  expenses of this trip. Take your time, make sure of him, and run him  into the ground.\"    \"My friend,\" said Hal Dozier, \"you turn a pleasure into a real party.\"    And Charles Merchant left, knowing that he had signed the death warrant  of young Lanning. In all the history of the mountain desert there was a  tale of only one man who had escaped, once Hal Dozier took his trail,  and that man had blown out his own brains.          CHAPTER 11      Far away in the western sky Andy Lanning saw a black dot that moved in  wide circles and came up across the heavens slowly, and he knew it was a  buzzard that scented carrion and was coming up the wind toward that  scent. He had seen them many a time before on their gruesome trails, and  the picture which he carried was not a pleasant one.    But now the picture that drifted through his mind was still more  horrible. It was a human body lying face downward in the sand with the  wind ruffling in the hair and the hat rolled a few paces off and the gun  close to the outstretched hand. He knew from Uncle Jasper that no matter  how far the trail led, or how many years it was ridden, the end of the  outlaw was always the same--death and the body left to the buzzards. Or  else, in some barroom, a footfall from behind and a bullet through  the back.    The flesh of Andy crawled. It was not possible for him to relax in  vigilance for a moment, lest danger come upon him when he least expected  it. Perhaps, in some open space like this. He went on until the sun was  low in the west and all the sky was rimmed with color.    Dusk had come over the hills in a rush, when he saw a house half lost in  the shadows. It was a narrow-fronted, two-storied, unpainted, lonely  place, without sign of a porch. Here, where there was no vestige of a  town near, and where there was no telephone, the news of the deaths of  Bill Dozier and Buck Heath could not have come. Andy accepted the house  as a blessing and went straight toward it.    But the days of carelessness were over for Andy, and he would never  again approach a house without searching it like a human face. He  studied this shack as he came closer. If there were people in the  building they did not choose to show a light.    Andy went around to the rear of the house, where there was a low shed  beside the corral, half tumbled down; but in the corral were five or six  fine horses--wild fellows with bright eyes and the long necks of speed.  Andy looked upon them wistfully. Not one of them but was worth the price  of three of the pinto; but as for money there was not twenty dollars in  the pocket of Andy.    Stripping the saddle from the pinto, he put it under the shed and left  the mustang to feed and find water in the small pasture. Then he went  with the bridle, that immemorial sign of one who seeks hospitality in  the West, toward the house. He was met halfway by a tall, strong man of  middle age or more. There was no hat on his head, which was covered with  a shock of brown hair much younger than the face beneath it. He beheld  Andy without enthusiasm.    \"You figure on layin' over here for the night, stranger?\" he asked.    \"That's it,\" said Andy.    \"I'll tell you how it is,\" said the big man in the tone of one who is  willing to argue a point. \"We ain't got a very big house--you see  it--and it's pretty well filled right now. If you was to slope over the  hills there, you'd find Gainorville inside of ten miles.\"    Andy explained that he was at the end of a hard ride. \"Ten more miles  would kill the pinto,\" he said. \"But if you don't mind, I'll have a bit  of chow and then turn in out there in the shed. That won't crowd you in  your sleeping quarters, and it'll be fine for me.\"    The big man opened his mouth to say something more, then turned on his  heel.    \"I guess we can fix you up,\" he said. \"Come on along.\"    At another time Andy would have lost a hand rather than accept such  churlish hospitality, but he was in no position to choose. The pain of  hunger was like a voice speaking in him.    It was a four-room house; the rooms on the ground floor were the  kitchen, where Andy cooked his own supper of bacon and coffee and  flapjacks, and the combination living room, dining room, and, from the  bunk covered with blankets on one side, bedroom. Upstairs there must  have been two more rooms of the same size.    Seated about a little kitchen table in the front room, Andy found three  men playing an interrupted game of blackjack, which was resumed when the  big fellow took his place before his hand. The three gave Andy a look  and a grunt, but otherwise they paid no attention to him. And if they  had consulted him he could have asked for no greater favor. Yet he had  an odd hunger about seeing them. They were the last men in many a month,  perhaps, whom he could permit to see him without a fear. He brought his  supper into the living room and put his cup of coffee on the floor  beside him. While he ate he watched them.    They were, all in all, the least prepossessing group he had ever seen.  The man who had brought him in was far from well favored, but he was  handsome compared with the others. Opposite him sat a tall fellow very  erect and stiff in his chair. A candle had recently been lighted, and it  stood on the table near this man. It showed a wan face of excessive  leanness. His eyes were deep under bony brows, and they alone of the  features showed any expression as the game progressed, turning now and  again to the other faces with glances that burned; he was winning  steadily. A red-headed man was on his left, with his back to Andy; but  now and again he turned, and Andy saw a heavy jowl and a skin blotched  with great, rusty freckles. His shoulders over-flowed the back of his  chair, which creaked whenever he moved. The man who faced the redhead  was as light as his companion was ponderous. His voice was gentle, his  eyes large and soft, and his profile was exceedingly handsome. But in  the full view Andy saw nothing except a grisly, purple scar that twisted  down beneath the right eye of the man. It drew down the lower lid of  that eye, and it pulled the mouth of the man a bit awry, so that he  seemed to be smiling in a smug, half-apologetic manner. In spite of his  youth he was unquestionably the dominant spirit here. Once or twice the  others lifted their voices in argument, and a single word from him cut  them short. And when he raised his head, now and again, to look at Andy,  it gave the latter a feeling that his secret was read and all"]]]
