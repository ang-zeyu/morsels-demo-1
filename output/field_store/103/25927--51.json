These are the contents of the extensive fourth  Parva--the Virata. The great Rishi Vyasa has composed in these sixty-seven  sections. The number of slokas is two thousand and fifty.    \"Listen then to (the contents of) the fifth Parva which must be known as  Udyoga. While the Pandavas, desirous of victory, were residing in the  place called Upaplavya, Duryodhana and Arjuna both went at the same time  to Vasudeva, and said, 'You should render us assistance in this war.' The  high-souled Krishna, upon these words being uttered, replied, 'O ye first  of men, a counsellor in myself who will not fight and one Akshauhini of  troops, which of these shall I give to which of you?' Blind to his own  interests, the foolish Duryodhana asked for the troops; while Arjuna  solicited Krishna as an unfighting counsellor. Then is described how, when  the king of Madra was coming for the assistance of the Pandavas,  Duryodhana, having deceived him on the way by presents and hospitality,  induced him to grant a boon and then solicited his assistance in battle;  how Salya, having passed his word to Duryodhana, went to the Pandavas and  consoled them by reciting the history of Indra's victory (over Vritra).  Then comes the despatch by the Pandavas of their Purohita (priest) to the  Kauravas. Then is described how king Dhritarashtra of great prowess,  having heard the word of the purohita of the Pandavas and the story of  Indra's victory decided upon sending his purohita and ultimately  despatched Sanjaya as envoy to the Pandavas from desire for peace. Here  hath been described the sleeplessness of Dhritarashtra from anxiety upon  hearing all about the Pandavas and their friends, Vasudeva and others. It  was on this occasion that Vidura addressed to the wise king Dhritarashtra  various counsels that were full of wisdom. It was here also that Sanat-  sujata recited to the anxious and sorrowing monarch the excellent truths  of spiritual philosophy. On the next morning Sanjaya spoke, in the court  of the King, of the identity of Vasudeva and Arjuna. It was then that the  illustrious Krishna, moved by kindness and a desire for peace, went  himself to the Kaurava capital, Hastinapura, for bringing about peace.  Then comes the rejection by prince Duryodhana of the embassy of Krishna  who had come to solicit peace for the benefit of both parties. Here hath  been recited the story of Damvodvava; then the story of the high-souled  Matuli's search for a husband for his daughter: then the history of the  great sage Galava; then the story of the training and discipline of the  son of Bidula. Then the exhibition by Krishna, before the assembled Rajas,  of his Yoga powers upon learning the evil counsels of Duryodhana and Karna;  then Krishna's taking Karna in his chariot and his tendering to him of  advice, and Karna's rejection of the same from pride. Then the return of  Krishna, the chastiser of enemies from Hastinapura to Upaplavya, and his  narration to the Pandavas of all that had happened. It was then that those  oppressors of foes, the Pandavas, having heard all and consulted properly  with each other, made every preparation for war. Then comes the march from  Hastinapura, for battle, of foot-soldiers, horses, charioteers and  elephants. Then the tale of the troops by both parties. Then the despatch  by prince Duryodhana of Uluka as envoy to the Pandavas on the day previous  to the battle. Then the tale of charioteers of different classes. Then the  story of Amba. These all have been described in the fifth Parva called  Udyoga of the Bharata, abounding with incidents appertaining to war and  peace. O ye ascetics, the great Vyasa hath composed one hundred and eighty-  six sections in this Parva. The number of slokas also composed in this by  the great Rishi is six thousand, six hundred and ninety-eight.    \"Then is recited the Bhishma Parva replete with wonderful incidents. In  this hath been narrated by Sanjaya the formation of the region known as  Jambu. Here hath been described the great depression of Yudhishthira's  army, and also a fierce fight for ten successive days. In this the high-  souled Vasudeva by reasons based on the philosophy of final release drove  away Arjuna's compunction springing from the latter's regard for his  kindred (whom he was on the eve of slaying). In this the magnanimous  Krishna, attentive to the welfare of Yudhishthira, seeing the loss  inflicted (on the Pandava army), descended swiftly from his chariot  himself and ran, with dauntless breast, his driving whip in hand, to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7871"],[0,"Dutch Fairy Tales for Young Folks (#9)"],[1,"much for them,  so they are not often seen during the day, except towards sunset. They  love the silvery moonlight. There used to be many folks, who thought  they had seen the beautiful creatures, full of fun and joy, dancing hand  in hand, in a circle.    In these old days, long since gone by, there were more people than there  are now, who were sure they had many times enjoyed the sight of the  elves. Some places in Holland show, by their names, where this kind of  fairies used to live. These little creatures, that looked as thin as  gauze, were very lively and mischievous, though they often helped honest  and hard working people in their tasks, as we shall see. But first and  most of all, they were fond of fun. They loved to vex cross people and  to please those who were bonnie and blithe. They hated misers, but they  loved the kind and generous. These little folks usually took their  pleasure in the grassy meadows, among the flowers and butterflies. On  bright nights they played among the moonbeams.    There were certain times when the elves were busy, in such a way as to  make men and girls think about them. Then their tricks were generally in  the stable, or in the field among the cows. Sometimes, in the kitchen or  dairy, among the dishes or milk-pans, they made an awful mess for the  maids to clean up. They tumbled over the churns, upset the milk jugs,  and played hoops with the round cheeses. In a bedroom they made things  look as if the pigs had run over them.    When a farmer found his horse's mane twisted into knots, or two cows  with their tails tied together, he said at once, \"That's the work of  elves.\" If the mares did not feel well, or looked untidy, their owners  were sure the elves had taken the animals out and had been riding them  all night. If a cow was sick, or fell down on the grass, it was believed  that the elves had shot an arrow into its body. The inquest, held on  many a dead calf or its mother, was, that it died from an \"elf-shot.\"  They were so sure of this, that even when a stone arrow head--such as  our far-off ancestors used in hunting, when they were cave men--was  picked up off the ground, it was called an \"elf bolt,\" or \"elf-arrow.\"    Near a certain village named Elf-berg or Elf Hill, because there were so  many of the little people in that neighborhood, there was one very old  elf, named Styf, which means Stiff, because though so old he stood up  straight as a lance. Even more than the young elves, he was famous for  his pranks. Sometimes he was nicknamed Haan-e'-kam or Cock's Comb. He  got this name, because he loved to mock the roosters, when they crowed,  early in the morning. With his red cap on, he did look like a rooster.  Sometimes he fooled the hens, that heard him crowing. Old Styf loved  nothing better than to go to a house where was a party indoors. All the  wooden shoes of the twenty or thirty people within, men and women, girls  and boys, would be left outside the door. All good Dutch folks step out  of their heavy timber shoes, or klomps, before they enter a house. It is  always a curious sight, at a country church, or gathering of people at a  party, to see the klomps, big and little, belonging to baby boys and  girls, and to the big men, who wear a number thirteen shoe of wood. One  wonders how each one of the owners knows his own, but he does. Each pair  is put in its own place, but Old Styf would come and mix them all up  together, and then leave them in a pile. So when the people came out to  go home, they had a terrible time in finding and sorting out their  shoes. Often they scolded each other; or, some innocent boy was blamed  for the mischief. Some did not find out, till the next day, that they  had on one foot their own, and on another foot, their neighbor's shoe.  It usually took a week to get the klomps sorted out, exchanged, and the  proper feet into the right shoes. In this way, which was a special trick  with him, this naughty elf, Styf, spoiled the temper of many people.    Beside the meadow elves, there were other kinds in Elfin Land; some  living in the woods, some in the sand-dunes, but those called  Staalkaars, or elves of the stall, were Old Styf's particular friends.  These lived in stables and among the cows. The Moss Maidens, that could  do anything with leaves, even turning them into money, helped Styf, for  they too liked mischief. They teased men-folks, and enjoyed nothing  better than misleading the stupid fellows that fuddled their brains with  too much liquor.    Styf's especially famous trick was played on misers. It was this. When  he heard of any old fellow, who wanted to save the cost of candles, he  would get a kabouter to lead him off in the swamps, where the sooty  elves come out, on dark nights, to dance. Hoping to catch these lights  and use them for candles, the mean fellow would find himself in a swamp,  full of water and chilled to the marrow. Then the kabouters would laugh  loudly.    Old Styf had the most fun with another stingy fellow, who always scolded  children when he found them spending a penny. If he saw a girl buying  flowers, or a boy giving a copper coin for a waffle, he talked roughly  to them for wasting money. Meeting this miser one day, as he was walking  along the brick road, leading from the village, Styf offered to pay the  old man a thousand guilders, in exchange for four striped tulips, that  grew in his garden. The miser, thinking it real silver, eagerly took the  money and put it away in his iron strong box. The next night, when he  went, as he did three times a week, to count, and feel, and rub, and  gloat, over his cash, there was nothing but leaves in a round form.  These, at his touch, crumbled to pieces. The Moss Maidens laughed  uproariously, when the mean old fellow was mad about it.    But let no one suppose that the elves, because they were smarter than  stupid human beings, were always in mischief. No, no! They did, indeed,  have far more intelligence than dull grown folks, lazy boys, or careless  girls; but many good things they did. They sewed shoes for poor  cobblers, when they were sick, and made clothes for children, when the  mother was tired. When they were around, the butter came quick in the  churn.    When the blue flower of the flax bloomed in Holland, the earth, in  spring time, seemed like the sky. Old Styf then saw his opportunity to  do a good thing. Men thought it a great affair to have even coarse linen  tow for clothes. No longer need they hunt the wolf and deer in the  forest, for their garments. By degrees, they learned to make finer  stuff, both linen for clothes and sails for ships, and this fabric they  spread out on the grass until the cloth was well bleached. When taken  up, it was white as the summer clouds that sailed in the blue sky. All  the world admired the product, and soon the word \"Holland\" was less the  name of a country, than of a dainty fabric, so snow white, that it was  fit to robe a queen. The world wanted more and more of it, and the Dutch  linen weaver grew rich. Yet still there was more to come.    Now, on one moonlight night in summer, the lady elves, beautiful  creatures, dressed in gauze and film, with wings to fly and with feet  that made no sound, came down into the meadows for their fairy dances.  But when, instead of green grass, they saw a white landscape, they  wondered, Was it winter?    Surely not, for the air was warm. No one shivered, or was cold. Yet  there were whole acres as white as snow, while all the old fairy rings,  grass and flowers were hidden.    They found that the meadows had become bleaching grounds, so that the  cows had to go elsewhere to get their dinner, and that this white area  was all linen. However, they quickly got over their surprise, for elves  are very quick to notice things. But now that men had stolen a march on  them, they asked whether, after all, these human beings had more  intelligence than elves. Not one of these fairies but believed that men  and women were the inferiors of elves.    So, then and there, began a battle of wits.    \"They have spoiled our dancing floor with their new invention; so we  shall have to find another,\" said the elfin queen, who led the party.    \"They are very proud of their linen, these men are; but, without the  spider to teach them, what could they have done? Even a wild boar can  instruct these human beings. Let us show them, that we, also, can do  even more. I'll get Old Styf to put on his thinking cap. He'll add  something new that will make them prouder yet.\"    \"But we shall get the glory of it,\" the elves shouted in chorus. Then  they left off talking and began their dances, floating in the air, until  they looked, from a distance, like a wreath of stars.    The next day, a procession of lovely elf maidens and mothers waited on  Styf and asked him to devise something that would excel the invention of  linen; which, after all, men had learned from the spider.    \"Yes, and they would not have any grain fields, if they had not learned  from the wild boar,\" added the elf queen.    Old Styf answered \"yes\" at once to their request, and put on his red  thinking cap. Then some of the girl elves giggled, for they saw that he  did, really, look like a cock's comb. \"No wonder they called him  Haan-e'-kam,\" said one elf girl to the other.    Now Old Styf enjoyed fooling, just for the fun of it, and he taught all  the younger elves that those who did the most work with their hands and  head, would have the most fun when they were old.    First of all, he went at once to see Fro, the spirit of the golden  sunshine and the warm summer showers, who owned two of the most  wonderful things in the world. One was his sword, which, as soon as it  was drawn out of its sheath, against wicked enemies, fought of its own  accord and won every battle. Fro's chief enemies were the frost giants,  who wilted the flowers and blasted the plants useful to man. Fro was  absent, when Styf"]]]
