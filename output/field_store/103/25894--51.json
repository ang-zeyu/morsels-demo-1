Many of the whites, (especially the poorest,)  forsake their houses, and live the greater part of the year in their  little plantations of indigo and cotton, where they can venture to  work with their own hands; which, according to the inveterate  prejudices of that country, would be a disgrace to them in the town.    Nueva Valencia, founded in 1555 under the government of Villacinda, by  Alonzo Diaz Moreno, is twelve years older than Caracas. Valencia was  at first only a dependency of Burburata; but this latter town is  nothing now but a place of embarkation for mules. It is regretted, and  perhaps justly, that Valencia has not become the capital of the  country. Its situation in a plain, on the banks of a lake, recalls to  mind the position of Mexico. When we reflect on the easy communication  afforded by the valleys of Aragua with the Llanos and the rivers that  flow into the Orinoco; when we recognize the possibility of opening an  inland navigation, by the Rio Pao and the Portuguesa, as far as the  mouths of the Orinoco, the Cassiquiare, and the Amazon, it may be  conceived that the capital of the vast provinces of Venezuela would  have been better placed near the fine harbour of Porto Cabello,  beneath a pure and serene sky, than near the unsheltered road of La  Guayra, in a temperate but constantly foggy valley. Near the kingdom  of New Grenada, and situate between the fertile corn-lands of La  Victoria and Barquesimeto, the city of Valencia ought to have  prospered; but, notwithstanding these advantages, it has been unable  to maintain the contest with Caracas.    Only those who have seen the myriads of ants, that infest the  countries within the torrid zone, can form an idea of the destruction  and the sinking of the ground occasioned by these insects. They abound  to such a degree on the site of Valencia, that their excavations  resemble subterranean canals, which are filled with water in the time  of the rains, and become very dangerous to the buildings. Here  recourse has not been had to the extraordinary means employed at the  beginning of the sixteenth century in the island of St. Domingo, when  troops of ants ravaged the fine plains of La Vega, and the rich  possessions of the order of St. Francis. The monks, after having in  vain burnt the larvae of the ants, and had recourse to fumigations,  advised the inhabitants to choose by lot a saint, who would act as a  mediator against the plague of the ants.* (* Un abogado contra los  harmigos.) The honour of the choice fell on St. Saturnin; and the ants  disappeared as soon as the first festival of this saint was  celebrated. Incredulity has made great progress since the time of the  conquest; and it was only on the back of the Cordilleras that I found  a small chapel, destined, according to its inscription, for prayers to  be addressed to Heaven for the destruction of the termites.    Valencia affords some historical remembrances; but these, like  everything connected with the colonies, have no remote date, and  recall to mind either civil discords or sanguinary conflicts with the  savages. Lopez de Aguirre, whose crimes and adventures form some of  the most dramatic episodes of the history of the conquest, proceeded  in 1561, from Peru, by the river Amazon to the island of Margareta;  and thence, by the port of Burburata, into the valleys of Aragua. On  his entrance into Valencia, which proudly entitles itself the City of  the King, he proclaimed the independence of country, and the  deposition of Philip II. The inhabitants withdrew to the islands of  the lake of Tacarigua, taking with them all the boats from the shore,  to be more secure in their retreat. In consequence of this stratagem,  Aguirre could exercise his cruelties only on his own people. From  Valencia he addressed to the king of Spain, a remarkable letter, in  which he boasts alternately of his crimes and his piety; at the same  time giving advice to the king on the government of the colonies, and  the system of missions. Surrounded by savage Indians, navigating on a  great sea of fresh water, as he calls the Amazon, he is alarmed at the  heresies of Martin Luther, and the increasing influence of schismatics  in Europe.*    (* The following are some remarkable passages in the letter from  Aguirre to the king of Spain.    \"King Philip, native of Spain, son of Charles the Invincible! I, Lopez  de Aguirre, thy vassal, an old Christian, of poor but noble parents,  and a native of the town of Onate in Biscay, passed over young to  Peru, to labour lance in hand. I rendered thee great services in the  conquest of India. I fought for thy glory, without demanding pay of  thy officers, as is proved by the books of thy treasury. I firmly  believe, Christian King and Lord, that, very ungrateful to me and my  companions, all those who write to thee from this land [America],  deceive thee much, because thou seest things from too far off. I  recommend to thee to be more just toward the good vassals whom thou  hast in this country: for I and mine, weary of the cruelties and  injustice which thy viceroys, thy governors, and thy judges, exercise  in thy name, are resolved to obey thee no more. We regard ourselves no  longer as Spaniards. We wage a cruel war against thee, because we will  not endure the oppression of thy ministers; who, to give places to  their nephews and their children, dispose of our lives, our  reputation, and our fortune. I am lame in the left foot from two shots  of an arquebuss, which I received in the valley of Coquimbo, fighting  under the orders of thy marshal, Alonzo de Alvarado, against Francis  Hernandez Giron, then a rebel, as I am at present, and shall be  always; for since thy viceroy, the Marquis de Canete, a cowardly,  ambitious, and effeminate man, has hanged our most valiant warriors, I  care no more for thy pardon than for the books of Martin Luther. It is  not well in thee, King of Spain, to be ungrateful toward thy vassals;  for it was whilst thy father, the emperor Charles, remained quietly in  Castile, that they procured for thee so many kingdoms and vast  countries. Remember, King Philip, that thou hast no right to draw  revenues from these provinces, the conquest of which has been without  danger to thee, but inasmuch as thou recompensest those who have  rendered thee such great services. I am certain that few kings go to  heaven. Therefore we regard ourselves as very happy to be here in the  Indies, preserving in all their purity the commandments of God, and of  the Roman Church; and we intend, though sinners during life, to become  one day martyrs to the glory of God. On going out of the river Amazon,  we landed in an island called La Margareta. We there received news  from Spain of the great faction and machination (maquina) of the  Lutherans. This news alarmed us extremely; we found among us one of  that faction; his name was Monteverde. I had him cut to pieces, as was  just: for, believe me, Senor, wherever I am, people live according to  the law. But the corruption of morals among the monks is so great in  this land that it is necessary to chastise it severely. There is not  an ecclesiastic here who does not think himself higher than the  governor of a province. I beg of thee, great King, not to believe what  the monks tell thee down yonder in Spain. They are always talking of  the sacrifices they make, as well as of the hard and bitter life they  are forced to lead in America: while they occupy the richest lands,  and the Indians hunt and fish for them every day. If they shed tears  before thy throne, it is that thou mayest send them hither to govern  provinces. Dost thou know what sort of life they lead here? Given up  to luxury, acquiring possessions, selling the sacraments, being at  once ambitious, violent, and gluttonous; such is the life they lead in  America. The faith of the Indians suffer by such bad examples. If thou  dost not change all this, O King of Spain, thy government will not be  stable.    \"What a misfortune that the Emperor, thy father, should have conquered  Germany at such a price, and spent, on that conquest, the money we  procured for him in these very Indies! In the year 1559 the Marquis de  Canete sent to the Amazon, Pedro de Ursua, a Navarrese, or rather a  Frenchman: we sailed on the largest rivers of Peru till we came to a  gulf of fresh water. We had already gone three hundred leagues when we  killed that bad and ambitious captain. We chose a caballero of  Seville, Fernando de Guzman, for king: and we swore fealty to him, as  is done to thyself. I was named quarter-master-general: and because I  did not consent to all he willed, he wanted to kill me. But I killed  this new king, the captain of his guards, his lieutenant-general, his  chaplain, a woman, a knight of the order of Rhodes, two ensigns, and  five or six domestics of the pretended king. I then resolved to punish  thy ministers and thy auditors (counsellors of the audiencia). I named  captains and sergeants: these again wanted to kill me, but I had them  all hanged. In the midst of these adventures we navigated for eleven  months, till we reached the mouth of the river. We sailed more than  fifteen hundred leagues. God knows how we got through that great mass  of water. I advise thee, O great King, never to send Spanish fleets  into that accursed river. God preserve thee in his holy keeping.\"    This letter was given by Aguirre to the vicar of the island of  Margareta, Pedro de Contreras, in order to be transmitted to King  Philip II. Fray Pedro Simon, Provincial of the Franciscans in New  Grenada, saw several manuscript copies of it both in America and in  Spain. It was printed, for the first time, in 1723, in the History of  the Province of Venezuela, by Oviedo, volume 1 page 206."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7015"],[0,"Buddhist Psalms translated from the Japanese of Shinran Shonin (#9)"],[1,"and dull of  heart is he.    302. Among those men that doubt the Holy Word, some are imprisoned  in the shut bud of the Lotus. And they shall be despised as they  that in illusion are born into the outermost Paradise or are held  captive within the narrow walls of the womb.    303. Whoso doubteth the omniscience of the wisdom of the  Light-Bearer, but holdeth to his belief in Reward, excellent  ofttimes in making the root of goodness to grow,    304. Because he doubteth the wisdom of the Eternal Wisdom, and is  held captive as in the strait prison of the womb, hath neither  knowledge nor wisdom, and is compared unto a man straitly bound in  captivity.    305. He that is born into the outermost place, all glorious with the  sevenfold jewels, shall not in five hundred years behold that  three-fold jewel, the Tri-ratna, for there is in him no spiritual  well-doing, that he should give it unto his fellow-men.    306. To him who is born into the Palace, glorious with the seven  jewels, for five hundred years there shall befall many sorts of  sorrows from his own evil doing.    307. Whoso hopeth reward and maketh to flourish the root of  goodness, shall remain in the transitory Paradise, for though he be  a good man, yet hath he a doubting heart.    308. Because he accepteth not the Divine Promise of Him who is the  Light unspeakable, and carrieth his doubt with him unto Paradise,  therefore the shut flower of his heart openeth not, therefore is he  unshapen as a child in the womb.    309. When he perceiveth the Land of Purity, the Bodhisattva Maitreya  thus questioneth the Holy One, saying, \"What is the cause and what  the circumstance of that man who, having been born, yet remaineth as  it were straitened in the womb?    310. And thus spake the Lord unto the Bodhisattva Maitreya saying,    \"Whoso trusteth in the root of goodness that he himself maketh to  grow and hath a doubting soul, he it is that is in the outermost  places of the Paradise, he it is that is said to be straitened still  in the womb of ignorance.\"    311. He who doubteth the wisdom of Him that is all Light, shall for  his sin be made captive until five hundred years be gone, and this  is called the conception within the womb of ignorance.    312. Whoso doubteth the wisdom that is beyond man's understanding,  and hath believed the doctrine of reward, shall of a certainty be  born within Doubting Castle, and this is called conception within  the womb of ignorance.    313. Whoso trusteth upon self-righteousness rather than upon the  wisdom of the Enlightened One that is beyond man's knowledge, shall  be conceived within the womb of ignorance, and to him shall the  mercy of the Three Jewels be unknown.    314. Whoso doubteth the wisdom of the Enlightened One that  surpasseth all knowledge of man and trusteth in the hope of reward,  and would attain unto birth in Paradise by making the root of  goodness to grow, shall be straitened in the womb of ignorance.    315. Heavy is the sin of doubting the wisdom of the Buddha. He who  is instructed taketh refuge in the wonderful wisdom of the  Enlightened One, being in contrition for his foolishness.    These twenty-three psalms above-written are made by me that men  should know the heaviness of their sin in doubting the Divine  Promise of the Buddha of Infinite Light.      IN PRAISE OF PRINCE SHOTOKU    316. Through the compassion of Shotoku the great prince we, having  accepted the Divine Promise sprung from the unsearchable wisdom of  the Illuminated One, are made equal unto Maitreya. Bodhisattva--the  Buddha that shall be--having been united unto those men who return  no more to birth and death.    317. The mighty Bodhisattva of Compassion, he who is the Saviour,  was made manifest in this world as Shotoku the Prince, who, like a  father, hath not forsaken us, and like a mother is ever amongst us.    318. From that past where was no beginning until the day that now  is, hath Shotoku the great prince, the Compassionate, dwelt among us  like unto a father and a mother.    319. Shotoku the Prince, from his Compassion, hath persuaded us to  enter in at the Divine Promise of the wondrous wisdom of the  Light-Bearer. And through this are we joined unto those men who  return no more unto birth and death.    320. Whoso attaineth unto the holy faith that is the power of  divinity, must, in the Ten Regions of the world, find the twofold  gift of the Enlightened One, that he may live in thankfulness for  His grace.    321. Shotoku, he who is mercy's self, the Compassionate, he who is  like unto a father, and the Bodhisattva of Mercy, the divine  tenderness, his succour is merciful as the pity of a mother.    322. Testimony is there that Shotoku the prince hath mercy upon us,  from the myriads of Kalpas even unto this day, because the wondrous  wisdom of Him who is Light beareth the load of his debt for the  believer.    Therefore before the eyes of His wisdom is the evil as the good, the  pure as the unclean.    323. Shotoku, the Prince, he that is in Japan called the Lord of  Teaching, he whose great mercy overtops all spoken words of  gratitude, must we therefore praise for evermore, having with single  heart sought refuge in him.    324. He who hath pitied the dwellers in the lands of Japan, the  Prince of Jogu, he whose ways are merciful, hath spread abroad the  Divine Promise of the Enlightened One. Therefore let us praise him  with great rejoicing. Throughout the many myriads of Kalpas, birth  after birth fell hitherto upon us.    325. We to whom he showed forth his compassion must be swift to  praise him, having continually sought refuge in him, and with a  single mind.    326. The high Prince Shotoku, he who hath guarded us and with great  carefulness led us upwards from remotest times, hath lovingly  entreated us to seek our refuge in the two-fold gift of the  Enlightened One.      WHEREIN WITH LAMENTATION I MAKE MY CONFESSION    327. Though I seek my refuge in the true faith of the Pure Land,    Yet hath not mine heart been truly sincere.    Deceit and untruth are in my flesh,    And in my soul is no clear shining.    328. In their outward seeming are all men diligent and truth  speaking,    But in their souls are greed and eager and unjust deceitfulness,    And in their flesh do lying and cunning triumph.    329. Too strong for me is the evil of my heart. I cannot overcome  it.    Therefore is my soul like unto the poison of serpents,    Even my righteous deeds, being mingled with this poison, must be  named the deeds of deceitfulness.    330. Shameless though I be and having no truth in my soul,    Yet the virtue of the Holy Name, the gift of Him that is  enlightened,    Is spread throughout the world through my words being as I am.    331. There is no mercy in my soul.    The good of my fellow-man is not dear in mine eyes.    If it were not for the Ark of Mercy, the divine promise of the  Infinite Wisdom,    How should I cross the Ocean of Misery?    332. I, whose mind is filled with cunning and deceit as the poison  of reptiles, am impotent to practise righteous deeds.    If I sought not refuge in the gift of our Father, I should die the  death of the shameless.    333. It is a token of this evil age that in this world the priests,  together with the people,    In secret serve strange gods,    While bearing the appearance of the devout sons of Buddha.    334. Sad and corrupt is it that the priests and people, following  after the superstitions of auspicious times and days, seek  sooth-saying and festivals    And worship the gods of heaven and earth.    335. Though I have heard that the names of priest and monk are  honourable,    Yet now are they held as light as the five shameless precepts of  Devadatta.    336. Being of one accord with the many minds of the heathen,    They bow in worship before devils,    While yet wearing the robe of the Buddha.    337. Sad and sorrowful is it that all the priests and people now in  the land of Yamato should worship the devils of heaven and earth, in  the name of the holy mysteries of the Buddha.    338. It is a mark of the downward way of this evil age that men  despise the name of priest or monk as a mean thing, considering them  like unto slaves.    339. May they yet bring offerings with homage unto the priests, even  as you do unto Saliputra or Mahamonugalyayana, those two great  servants of the Lord; though they are priests but in name and  without discipline, for this is the time of degeneration and of the  last days.    340. Though sin hath no substance in itself, and is but the shadow  of our illusion, and soul is in itself pure, yet in all this world  is there no sincere man.    341. Great sorrow is it that, in the wicked world of this age now so  near its end, the high priests who are born in the palankin, and the  monks who bear it now in Nara and Mount Hiyei, desire high secular  rank as the greatest honour.    342. That they consider the monk and nun as their slaves, and mock  at the honourable title of priest and minister, even as at the mean  name of slave, gives testimony that they despise the teaching of the  Buddha.    These sixteen psalms written above are written by me, Gutoku, with  lamentation, to be a record. To me even the honourable priests and  monks of the Central Temples seem now to be despised.      ADDITIONAL PSALMS    343. Having fulfilled forty and eight of the Divine Promise,    He attained unto the supreme enlightenment, and was manifest as the  Buddha of Infinite Light.    Whoso seeketh refuge with Him shall be certainly born into the Land  of Purity.    344. Into the Promised Land--the Paradise of the Great Calm.    He who practiseth the righteous deeds of the mingled motive hath no  claim of birth,    Therefore He that is Infinite would have us follow the deeds of the  single practice that is chosen of Him as teaching that is at the  root.    345. The merit of His holy austerities throughout the myriads of  Kalpas is fully"]]]
