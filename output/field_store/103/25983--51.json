[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/957"],[0,"The Scarecrow of Oz (#9)"],[1,"from my home in California.\"    \"Can't say as to that, partner,\" answered Cap'n Bill, \"but I'm mighty  certain we've come a long way since we struck that whirlpool.\"    \"Yes,\" she agreed, with a sigh, \"it must be miles and miles!\"    \"Distance means nothing,\" said the Ork. \"I have flown pretty much all  over the world, trying to find my home, and it is astonishing how many  little countries there are, hidden away in the cracks and corners of  this big globe of Earth. If one travels, he may find some new country  at every turn, and a good many of them have never yet been put upon the  maps.\"    \"P'raps this is one of them,\" suggested Trot.    They reached the house after a brisk walk and Cap'n Bill knocked upon  the door. It was at once opened by a rugged looking man who had \"bumps  all over him,\" as Trot afterward declared. There were bumps on his  head, bumps on his body and bumps on his arms and legs and hands. Even  his fingers had bumps on the ends of them. For dress he wore an old  gray suit of fantastic design, which fitted him very badly because of  the bumps it covered but could not conceal.    But the Bumpy Man's eyes were kind and twinkling in expression and as  soon as he saw his visitors he bowed low and said in a rather bumpy  voice:    \"Happy day!  Come in and shut the door, for it grows cool when the sun  goes down. Winter is now upon us.\"    \"Why, it isn't cold a bit, outside,\" said Trot, \"so it can't be winter  yet.\"    \"You will change your mind about that in a little while,\" declared the  Bumpy Man. \"My bumps always tell me the state of the weather, and they  feel just now as if a snowstorm was coming this way. But make  yourselves at home, strangers. Supper is nearly ready and there is food  enough for all.\"    Inside the house there was but one large room, simply but comfortably  furnished. It had benches, a table and a fireplace, all made of stone.  On the hearth a pot was bubbling and steaming, and Trot thought it had  a rather nice smell. The visitors seated themselves upon the  benches--except the Ork. which squatted by the fireplace--and the Bumpy  Man began stirring the kettle briskly.    \"May I ask what country this is, sir?\" inquired Cap'n Bill.    \"Goodness me--fruit-cake and apple-sauce!--don't you know where you  are?\" asked the Bumpy Man, as he stopped stirring and looked at the  speaker in surprise.    \"No,\" admitted Cap'n Bill. \"We've just arrived.\"    \"Lost your way?\" questioned the Bumpy Man.    \"Not exactly,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"We didn't have any way to lose.\"    \"Ah!\" said the Bumpy Man, nodding his bumpy head. \"This,\" he announced,  in a solemn, impressive voice, \"is the famous Land of Mo.\"    \"Oh!\" exclaimed the sailor and the girl, both in one breath. But, never  having heard of the Land of Mo, they were no wiser than before.    \"I thought that would startle you,\" remarked the Bumpy Man, well  pleased, as he resumed his stirring. The Ork watched him a while in  silence and then asked:    \"Who may you be?\"    \"Me?\" answered the Bumpy Man. \"Haven't you heard of me? Gingerbread and  lemon-juice! I'm known, far and wide, as the Mountain Ear.\"    They all received this information in silence at first, for they were  trying to think what he could mean. Finally Trot mustered up courage to  ask:    \"What is a Mountain Ear, please?\"    For answer the man turned around and faced them, waving the spoon with  which he had been stirring the kettle, as he recited the following  verses in a singsong tone of voice:      \"Here's a mountain, hard of hearing,    That's sad-hearted and needs cheering,    So my duty is to listen to all sounds that Nature makes,    So the hill won't get uneasy--    Get to coughing, or get sneezy--    For this monster bump, when frightened, is quite liable to quakes.      \"You can hear a bell that's ringing;    I can feel some people's singing;    But a mountain isn't sensible of what goes on, and so    When I hear a blizzard blowing    Or it's raining hard, or snowing,    I tell it to the mountain and the mountain seems to know.      \"Thus I benefit all people    While I'm living on this steeple,    For I keep the mountain steady so my neighbors all may thrive.    With my list'ning and my shouting    I prevent this mount from spouting,    And that makes me so important that I'm glad that I'm alive.\"      When he had finished these lines of verse the Bumpy Man turned again to  resume his stirring. The Ork laughed softly and Cap'n Bill whistled to  himself and Trot made up her mind that the Mountain Ear must be a  little crazy. But the Bumpy Man seemed satisfied that he had explained  his position fully and presently he placed four stone plates upon the  table and then lifted the kettle from the fire and poured some of its  contents on each of the plates. Cap'n Bill and Trot at once approached  the table, for they were hungry, but when she examined her plate the  little girl exclaimed:    \"Why, it's molasses candy!\"    \"To be sure,\" returned the Bumpy Man, with a pleasant smile. \"Eat it  quick, while it's hot, for it cools very quickly this winter weather.\"    With this he seized a stone spoon and began putting the hot molasses  candy into his mouth, while the others watched him in astonishment.    \"Doesn't it burn you?\" asked the girl.    \"No indeed,\" said he. \"Why don't you eat? Aren't you hungry?\"    \"Yes,\" she replied, \"I am hungry. But we usually eat our candy when it  is cold and hard. We always pull molasses candy before we eat it.\"    \"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed the Mountain Ear. \"What a funny idea! Where in  the world did you come from?\"    \"California,\" she said.    \"California! Pooh! there isn't any such place. I've heard of every  place in the Land of Mo, but I never before heard of California.\"    \"It isn't in the Land of Mo,\" she explained.    \"Then it isn't worth talking about,\" declared the Bumpy Man, helping  himself again from the steaming kettle, for he had been eating all the  time he talked.    \"For my part,\" sighed Cap'n Bill, \"I'd like a decent square meal, once  more, just by way of variety. In the last place there was nothing but  fruit to eat, and here it's worse, for there's nothing but candy.\"    \"Molasses candy isn't so bad,\" said Trot. \"Mine's nearly cool enough to  pull, already. Wait a bit, Cap'n, and you can eat it.\"    A little later she was able to gather the candy from the stone plate  and begin to work it back and forth with her hands. The Mountain Ear  was greatly amazed at this and watched her closely. It was really good  candy and pulled beautifully, so that Trot was soon ready to cut it  into chunks for eating.    Cap'n Bill condescended to eat one or two pieces and the Ork ate  several, but the Bumpy Man refused to try it. Trot finished the plate  of candy herself and then asked for a drink of water.    \"Water?\" said the Mountain Ear wonderingly. \"What is that?\"    \"Something to drink. Don't you have water in Mo?\"    \"None that ever I heard of,\" said he. \"But I can give you some fresh  lemonade. I caught it in a jar the last time it rained, which was only  day before yesterday.\"    \"Oh, does it rain lemonade here?\" she inquired.    \"Always; and it is very refreshing and healthful.\"    With this he brought from a cupboard a stone jar and a dipper, and the  girl found it very nice lemonade, indeed. Cap'n Bill liked it, too; but  the Ork would not touch it.    \"If there is no water in this country, I cannot stay here for long,\"  the creature declared. \"Water means life to man and beast and bird.\"    \"There must be water in lemonade,\" said Trot.    \"Yes,\" answered the Ork, \"I suppose so; but there are other things in  it, too, and they spoil the good water.\"    The day's adventures had made our wanderers tired, so the Bumpy Man  brought them some blankets in which they rolled themselves and then lay  down before the fire, which their host kept alive with fuel all through  the night. Trot wakened several times and found the Mountain Ear always  alert and listening intently for the slightest sound. But the little  girl could hear no sound at all except the snores of Cap'n Bill.          Chapter Eight    Button-Bright is Lost and Found Again      \"Wake up--wake up!\" called the voice of the Bumpy Man. \"Didn't I tell  you winter was coming? I could hear it coming with my left ear, and the  proof is that it is now snowing hard outside.\"    \"Is it?\" said Trot, rubbing her eyes and creeping out of her blanket.  \"Where I live, in California, I have never seen snow, except far away  on the tops of high mountains.\"    \"Well, this is the top of a high mountain,\" returned the bumpy one,  \"and for that reason we get our heaviest snowfalls right here.\"    The little girl went to  the window and looked out. The air was filled  with falling white flakes, so large in size and so queer in form that  she was puzzled.    \"Are you certain this is snow?\" she asked.    \"To be sure. I must get my snow-shovel and turn out to shovel a path.  Would you like to come with me?\"    \"Yes,\" she said, and followed the Bumpy Man out when he opened the  door. Then she exclaimed: \"Why, it isn't cold a bit!\"    \"Of course not,\" replied the man. \"It was cold last night, before the  snowstorm; but snow, when it falls, is always crisp and warm.\"    Trot gathered a handful of it.    \"Why, it's popcorn?\" she cried.    \"Certainly; all snow is popcorn. What did you expect it to be?\"    \"Popcorn is not snow in my country.\"    \"Well, it is the only snow we have in the Land of Mo, so you may as  well make the best of it,\" said he, a little impatiently. \"I'm not  responsible for the absurd things that happen in your country, and when  you're in Mo you must do as the Momen do. Eat some of our snow, and you  will find it is good. The only fault I find with our snow is that we  get too much of it at times.\"    With this the Bumpy Man set to work shoveling a path and he was so  quick and industrious that he piled up the popcorn in great banks on  either side of the trail that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/959"],[0,"The Lost Princess of Oz (#9)"],[1,"we would not have  bounded so swiftly from one to another without getting hurt.\"    \"That is all guesswork,\" declared the Wizard, unwinding the blankets  from his body, \"for none of us stayed long enough on the mountains to  discover what they are made of.  But where are we?\"    \"That's guesswork,\" said Scraps.  \"The shepherd said the Thistle-Eaters  live this side of the mountains and are waited on by giants.\"    \"Oh no,\" said Dorothy, \"it's the Herkus who have giant slaves, and the  Thistle-Eaters hitch dragons to their chariots.\"    \"How could they do that?\" asked the Woozy.  \"Dragons have long tails,  which would get in the way of the chariot wheels.\"    \"And if the Herkus have conquered the giants,\" said Trot, \"they must be  at least twice the size of giants.  P'raps the Herkus are the biggest  people in all the world!\"    \"Perhaps they are,\" assented the Wizard in a thoughtful tone of voice.  \"And perhaps the shepherd didn't know what he was talking about.  Let  us travel on toward the west and discover for ourselves what the people  of this country are like.\"    It seemed a pleasant enough country, and it was quite still and  peaceful when they turned their eyes away from the silently whirling  mountains.  There were trees here and there and green bushes, while  throughout the thick grass were scattered brilliantly colored flowers.  About a mile away was a low hill that hid from them all the country  beyond it, so they realized they could not tell much about the country  until they had crossed the hill.  The Red Wagon having been left  behind, it was now necessary to make other arrangements for traveling.  The Lion told Dorothy she could ride upon his back as she had often  done before, and the Woozy said he could easily carry both Trot and the  Patchwork Girl.  Betsy still had her mule, Hank, and Button-Bright and  the Wizard could sit together upon the long, thin back of the Sawhorse,  but they took care to soften their seat with a pad of blankets before  they started.  Thus mounted, the adventurers started for the hill,  which was reached after a brief journey.    As they mounted the crest and gazed beyond the hill, they discovered  not far away a walled city, from the towers and spires of which gay  banners were flying.  It was not a very big city, indeed, but its walls  were very high and thick, and it appeared that the people who lived  there must have feared attack by a powerful enemy, else they would not  have surrounded their dwellings with so strong a barrier. There was no  path leading from the mountains to the city, and this proved that the  people seldom or never visited the whirling hills, but our friends  found the grass soft and agreeable to travel over, and with the city  before them they could not well lose their way.  When they drew nearer  to the walls, the breeze carried to their ears the sound of music--dim  at first, but growing louder as they advanced.    \"That doesn't seem like a very terr'ble place,\" remarked Dorothy.    \"Well, it LOOKS all right,\" replied Trot from her seat on the Woozy,  \"but looks can't always be trusted.\"    \"MY looks can,\" said Scraps.  \"I LOOK patchwork, and I AM patchwork,  and no one but a blind owl could ever doubt that I'm the Patchwork  Girl.\"  Saying which, she turned a somersault off the Woozy and,  alighting on her feet, began wildly dancing about.    \"Are owls ever blind?\" asked Trot.    \"Always, in the daytime,\" said Button-Bright.   \"But Scraps can see  with her button eyes both day and night.  Isn't it queer?\"    \"It's queer that buttons can see at all,\" answered Trot.  \"But good  gracious!  What's become of the city?\"    \"I was going to ask that myself,\" said Dorothy. \"It's gone!\"    \"It's gone!\"    The animals came to a sudden halt, for the city had really disappeared,  walls and all, and before them lay the clear, unbroken sweep of the  country.  \"Dear me!\" exclaimed the Wizard.  \"This is rather  disagreeable.  It is annoying to travel almost to a place and then find  it is not there.\"    \"Where can it be, then?\" asked Dorothy.  \"It cert'nly was there a  minute ago.\"    \"I can hear the music yet,\" declared Button-Bright, and when they all  listened, the strains of music could plainly be heard.    \"Oh!  There's the city over at the left,\" called Scraps, and turning  their eyes, they saw the walls and towers and fluttering banners far to  the left of them.    \"We must have lost our way,\" suggested Dorothy.    \"Nonsense,\" said the Lion.    \"I, and all the other animals, have been tramping straight toward the  city ever since we first saw it.\"    \"Then how does it happen--\"    \"Never mind,\" interrupted the Wizard, \"we are no farther from it than  we were before.  It is in a different direction, that's all, so let us  hurry and get there before it again escapes us.\"    So on they went directly toward the city, which seemed only a couple of  miles distant.  But when they had traveled less than a mile, it  suddenly disappeared again.  Once more they paused, somewhat  discouraged, but in a moment the button eyes of Scraps again discovered  the city, only this time it was just behind them in the direction from  which they had come.  \"Goodness gracious!\" cried Dorothy.  \"There's  surely something wrong with that city.  Do you s'pose it's on wheels,  Wizard?\"    \"It may not be a city at all,\" he replied, looking toward it with a  speculative glance.    \"What COULD it be, then?\"    \"Just an illusion.\"    \"What's that?\" asked Trot.    \"Something you think you see and don't see.\"    \"I can't believe that,\" said Button-Bright.  \"If we only saw it, we  might be mistaken, but if we can see it and hear it, too, it must be  there.\"    \"Where?\" asked the Patchwork Girl.    \"Somewhere near us,\" he insisted.    \"We will have to go back, I suppose,\" said the Woozy with a sigh.    So back they turned and headed for the walled city until it disappeared  again, only to reappear at the right of them.  They were constantly  getting nearer to it, however, so they kept their faces turned toward  it as it flitted here and there to all points of the compass.  Presently the Lion, who was leading the procession, halted abruptly and  cried out, \"Ouch!\"    \"What's the matter?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Ouch--Ouch!\" repeated the Lion, and leaped backward so suddenly that  Dorothy nearly tumbled from his back. At the same time Hank the Mule  yelled \"Ouch!\"    \"Ouch!  Ouch!\" repeated the Lion and leaped backward so suddenly that  Dorothy nearly tumbled from his back.  At the same time, Hank the Mule  yelled \"Ouch!\" almost as loudly as the Lion had done, and he also  pranced backward a few paces.    \"It's the thistles,\" said Betsy.  \"They prick their legs.\"    Hearing this, all looked down, and sure enough the ground was thick  with thistles, which covered the plain from the point where they stood  way up to the walls of the mysterious city.  No pathways through them  could be seen at all; here the soft grass ended and the growth of  thistles began.  \"They're the prickliest thistles I ever felt,\"  grumbled the Lion.  \"My legs smart yet from their stings, though I  jumped out of them as quickly as I could.\"    \"Here is a new difficulty,\" remarked the Wizard in a grieved tone. \"The  city has stopped hopping around, it is true, but how are we to get to  it over this mass of prickers?\"    \"They can't hurt ME,\" said the thick-skinned Woozy, advancing  fearlessly and trampling among the thistles.    \"Nor me,\" said the Wooden Sawhorse.    \"But the Lion and the Mule cannot stand the prickers,\" asserted  Dorothy, \"and we can't leave them behind.\"    \"Must we all go back?\" asked Trot.    \"Course not!\" replied Button-Bright scornfully. \"Always when there's  trouble, there's a way out of it if you can find it.\"    \"I wish the Scarecrow was here,\" said Scraps, standing on her head on  the Woozy's square back.  \"His splendid brains would soon show us how  to conquer this field of thistles.\"    \"What's the matter with YOUR brains?\" asked the boy.    \"Nothing,\" she said, making a flip-flop into the thistles and dancing  among them without feeling their sharp points.  \"I could tell you in  half a minute how to get over the thistles if I wanted to.\"    \"Tell us, Scraps!\" begged Dorothy.    \"I don't want to wear my brains out with overwork,\" replied the  Patchwork Girl.    \"Don't you love Ozma?  And don't you want to find her?\" asked Betsy  reproachfully.    \"Yes indeed,\" said Scraps, walking on her hands as an acrobat does at  the circus.    \"Well, we can't find Ozma unless we get past these thistles,\" declared  Dorothy.    Scraps danced around them two or three times without reply.  Then she  said, \"Don't look at me, you stupid folks.  Look at those blankets.\"    The Wizard's face brightened at once.    \"Why didn't we think of those blankets before?\"    \"Because you haven't magic brains,\" laughed Scraps.   \"Such brains as  you have are of the common sort that grow in your heads, like weeds in  a garden.  I'm sorry for you people who have to be born in order to be  alive.\"    But the Wizard was not listening to her.  He quickly removed the  blankets from the back of the Sawhorse and spread one of them upon the  thistles, just next the grass.  The thick cloth rendered the prickers  harmless, so the Wizard walked over this first blanket and spread the  second one farther on, in the direction of the phantom city.  \"These  blankets,\" said he, \"are for the Lion and the Mule to walk upon.  The  Sawhorse and the Woozy can walk on the thistles.\"    So the Lion and the Mule walked over the first blanket and stood upon  the second one until the Wizard had picked up the one they had passed  over and spread it in front of them, when they advanced to that one and  waited while the one behind them was again spread in front.  \"This is  slow work,\" said the Wizard, \"but it will get us to the city after a  while.\"    \"The city is a good half mile away yet,\" announced Button-Bright.    \"And this is awful hard work for "]]]
