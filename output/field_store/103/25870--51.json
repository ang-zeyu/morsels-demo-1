If the witnesses failed, the defendant was told to go to church  and to take the sacrament only if he or she were innocent. If he  or she took the sacrament, he or she was tried by the process of  \"ordeal\", which was administered by the church. In the ordeal by  cold water, he was given a drink of holy water and then bound hand  and foot and thrown into water. If he floated, he was guilty. If  he sank, he was innocent. It was not necessary to drown to be  deemed innocent. In the ordeal by hot water, he had to pick up a  stone from inside a boiling cauldron. If his hand was healing in  three days, he was innocent. If it was festering, he was guilty. A  similar ordeal was that of hot iron, in which one had to carry in  his hands a hot iron for a certain distance. The results of the  ordeal were taken to indicate the will of God. Presumably a person  convicted of murder, i.e. killing by stealth, or robbery [taking  from a person's robe, that is, his person or breaking into his  home to steal] would be hung and his possessions confiscated. A  bishop's oath was incontrovertible. Accused archbishops and  bishops could clear themselves with an oath that they were  guiltless. Lesser ranks could clear themselves with the oaths of  three compurgators of their rank or, for more serious offenses,  undergo the ordeal of the consecrated morsel. For this, one would  swallow a morsel; if he choked on it, he was guilty.    Any inanimate or animate object or personal chattel which was  found by a court to be the immediate cause of death was forfeited  as \"deodand\", for instance, a tree from which a man fell to his  death, a beast which killed a man, a sword of a third party not  the slayer that was used to kill a man. The deodand was to go to  the dead man's kin so they could wreak their vengeance on it,  which in turn would cause the dead man to lie in peace.    This is a lawsuit regarding rights to feed pigs in a certain  woodland:    \"In the year 825 which had passed since the birth of Christ, and  in the course of the second Indiction, and during the reign of  Beornwulf, King of Mercia, a council meeting was held in the  famous place called Clofesho, and there the said King Beornwulf  and his bishops and his earls and all the councilors of this  nation were assembled. Then there was a very noteworthy suit about  wood pasture at Sinton, towards the west in Scirhylte. The reeves  in charge of the pigherds wished to extend the pasture farther,  and take in more of the wood than the ancient rights permitted.  Then the bishop and the advisors of the community said that they  would not admit liability for more than had been appointed in  AEthelbald's day, namely mast for 300 swine, and that the bishop  and the community should have two thirds of the wood and of the  mast. The Archbishop Wulfred and all the councilors determined  that the bishop and the community might declare on oath that it  was so appointed in AEthelbald's time and that they were not  trying to obtain more, and the bishop immediately gave security to  Earl Eadwulf to furnish the oath before all the councilors, and it  was produced in 30 days at the bishop's see at Worcester. At that  time Hama was the reeve in charge of the pigherds at Sinton, and  he rode until he reached Worcester, and watched and observed the  oath, as Earl Eadwulf bade him, but did not challenge it.  Here are the names and designations of those who were assembled at  the council meeting ...\"                                     - - - Chapter 3 - - -                                - The Times: 900-1066 -    There were many large landholders such as the King, earls, and  bishops. Earls were noblemen by birth, and often relatives of the  King. They were his army commanders and the highest civil  officials, each responsible for a shire. A breach of the public  peace of an earl would occasion a fine. Lower in social status  were freemen: sokemen, and then, in decreasing order, villani  [villeins], bordarii, and cottarii. The servi were the slaves.  Probably all who were not slaves were freemen.    Kings typically granted land in exchange for services of military  duties, maintaining fortresses, and repairing bridges. Less common  services required by landlords include equipping a guard ship and  guarding the coast, guarding the lord, military watch, maintaining  the deer fence at the King's residence, alms giving, and church  dues. Since this land was granted in return for service, there  were limitations on its heritability and often an heir had to pay  a heriot to the landlord to obtain the land. A heriot was  originally the armor of a man killed, which went to the King. The  heriot of a thegn who had soken came to be about 80s.; of a kings'  thegn about four lances, two coats of mail, two swords, and 125s.;  of an earl about eight horses, four saddled and four unsaddled,  eight lances, four coats of mail, four swords, and 500s.    There were several thousand thegns, rich and poor, who held land  directly of the King. Some thegns had soken or jurisdiction over  their own lands and others did not. Free farmers who had sought  protection from thegns in time of war now took them as their  lords. A freeman could chose his lord, following him in war and  working his land in peace. All able-bodied freemen were liable to  military service in the fyrd [national militia], but not in a  lord's private wars. In return, the lord would protect him against  encroaching neighbors, back him in the courts of law, and feed him  in times of famine. But often, lords raided each other's farmers,  who fled into the hills or woods for safety. Often a lord's  fighting men stayed with him at his large house, but later were  given land with inhabitants on it, who became his tenants. The  lords were the ruling class and the greatest of them sat in the  King's council along with bishops, abbots, and officers of the  King's household. The lesser lords were local magnates, who  officiated at the shire and hundred courts.    Stag-hunting, fox-hunting, and hawking were reserved for lords who  did not work with their hands. Every free born person had the  right to hunt other game.    There was a great expansion of arable land. Some land had been  specifically allocated to certain individuals. Some was common  land, held by communities. If a family came to pay the dues and  fines on certain common land, it could become personal to that  family and was then known as heir-land. Most land came to be  privately held from community-witnessed allotments or inheritance.  Book-land was those holdings written down in books. This land was  usually land that had been given to the church or monasteries  because church clerics could write. So many thegns gave land to  the church, usually a hide, that the church held 1/3 of the land  of the realm. Folk-land was that land that was left over after  allotments had been made to the freemen and which was not common  land. It was public land and a national asset and could be  converted to heir-land or book-land only by action of the king and  witan. It could also be rented by services to the state via  charter. A holder of folk-land might express a wish, e.g. by  testamentary action, for a certain disposition of it, such as an  estate for life or lives for a certain individual. But a distinct  act by the king and witan was necessary for this wish to take  effect. Small private transactions of land could be done by  \"livery of seisin\" in the presence of neighbors. All estates in  land could be let, lent, or leased by its holders, and was then  known as \"loenland\".    Ploughs and wagons could be drawn by four or more oxen or horses  in sets of two behind each other. Oxenshoes and horseshoes  prevented lameness due to cracked hooves. Horse collars especially  fitted for horses, replaced oxen yoke that had been used on  horses.    A free holder's house was wood, perhaps with a stone foundation,  and roofed with thatch or tiles. There was a main room or hall,  with bed chambers around it. Beyond was the kitchen, perhaps  outside under a lean-to. These buildings were surrounded by a bank  or stiff hedge.    Simple people lived in huts made from wood and mud, with one door  and no windows. They slept around a wood-burning fire in the  middle of the earthen floor. They wore shapeless clothes of goat  hair and unprocessed wool from their sheep. They ate rough brown  bread, vegetable and grain broth, ale from barley, bacon, beans,  milk, cabbage, onion, apples, plums, cherries, and honey for  sweetening or mead. Vegetables grown in the country included  onions, leeks, celery, lettuce, radish, carrots, garlic, shallots,  parsnip, dill, chevil, marigold, coriander, and poppy. In the  summer, they ate boiled or raw veal and wild fowl such as ducks,  geese, or pigeons, and game snared in the forest. Poultry was a  luxury food, but recognized as therapeutic for invalids,  especially in broth form [chicken soup]. Venison was highly  prized. There were still some wild boar, which were hunted with  long spears, a greyhound dog, and hunting horns. They sometimes  mated with the domestic pigs which roamed the woodlands. In  September, the old and infirm pigs were slaughtered and their  sides of bacon smoked in the rafters for about a month. Their  intestines provided skin for sausages. In the fall, cattle were  slaughtered and salted for food during the winter because there  was no more pasture for them. However, some cows and breed animals  were kept through the winter.    For their meals, people used wooden platters, sometimes  earthenware plates, drinking horns, drinking cups from ash or  alderwood turned on a foot-peddled pole lathe, and bottles made of  leather. Their bowls, pans, and pitchers were made by the potter's  wheel. Water could be boiled in pots made of iron, brass, lead, or  clay. Water could be carried in leather bags because leather  working preservative "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6615"],[0,"Myths and Legends of Our Own Land — Complete (#9)"],[1," to listen.\" So they built lodges on their shores and  skimmed their waters in canoes. Much of their history relates to them,  and this is a tale of the Senecas that was revived a few years ago by the  discovery of a deer-skin near Lakes Waneta and Keuka, New York, on which  some facts of the history were rudely drawn, for all Indians are artists.    Waneta, daughter of a chief, had plighted her troth to Kayuta, a hunter  of a neighboring tribe with which her people were at war. Their tryst was  held at twilight on the farther shore of the lake from her village, and  it was her gayety and happiness, after these meetings had taken place,  that roused the suspicion and jealousy of Weutha, who had marked her for  his bride against the time when he should have won her father's consent  by some act of bravery. Shadowing the girl as she stole into the forest  one evening, he saw her enter her canoe and row to a densely wooded spot;  he heard a call like the note of a quail, then an answer; then Kayuta  emerged on the shore, lifted the maiden from her little bark, and the  twain sat down beside the water to listen to the lap of its waves and  watch the stars come out.    Hurrying back to camp, the spy reported that an enemy was near them, and  although Waneta had regained her wigwam by another route before the  company of warriors had reached the lake, Kayuta was seen, pursued, and  only escaped with difficulty. Next evening, not knowing what had happened  after her homeward departure on the previous night--for the braves deemed  it best to keep the knowledge of their military operations from the  women--the girl crept away to the lake again and rowed to the accustomed  place, but while waiting for the quail call a twig dropped on the water  beside her. With a quick instinct that civilization has spoiled she  realized this to be a warning, and remaining perfectly still, she allowed  her boat to drift toward shore, presently discovering that her lover was  standing waist-deep in the water. In a whisper he told her that they were  watched, and bade her row to a dead pine that towered at the foot of the  lake, where he would soon meet her. At that instant an arrow grazed his  side and flew quivering into the canoe.    Pushing the boat on its course and telling her to hasten, Kayuta sprang  ashore, sounded the warwhoop, and as Weutha rose into sight he clove his  skull with a tomahawk. Two other braves now leaped forward, but, after a  struggle, Kayuta left them dead or senseless, too. He would have stayed  to tear their scalps off had he not heard his name uttered in a shriek of  agony from the end of the lake, and, tired and bleeding though he was, he  bounded along its margin like a deer, for the voice that he heard was  Waneta's. He reached the blasted pine, gave one look, and sank to the  earth. Presently other Indians came, who had heard the noise of fighting,  and burst upon him with yells and brandished weapons, but something in  his look restrained them from a close advance. His eyes were fixed on a  string of beads that lay on the bottom of the lake, just off shore, and  when the meaning of it came to them, the savages thought no more of  killing, but moaned their grief; for Waneta, in stepping from her canoe  to wade ashore, had been caught and swallowed by a quagmire. All night  and all next day Kayuta sat there like a man of stone. Then, just as the  hour fell when he was used to meet his love, his heart broke, and he  joined her in the spiritland.          THE DROP STAR    A little maid of three years was missing from her home on the Genesee.  She had gone to gather water-lilies and did not return. Her mother,  almost crazed with grief, searched for days, weeks, months, before she  could resign herself to the thought that her little one--Kayutah, the  Drop Star, the Indians called her--had indeed been drowned. Years went  by. The woman's home was secure against pillage, for it was no longer the  one house of a white family in that region, and the Indians had retired  farther and farther into the wilderness. One day a hunter came to the  woman and said, \"I have seen old Skenandoh,--the last of his tribe, thank  God! who bade me say this to you: that the ice is broken, and he knows of  a hill of snow where a red berry grows that shall be yours if you will  claim it.\" When the meaning of this message came upon her the woman  fainted, but on recovering speech she despatched her nephew to the hut of  the aged chief and passed that night in prayer.    The young man set off at sunset, and by hard riding, over dim trails,  with only stars for light, he came in the gray of dawn to an upright  timber, colored red and hung with scalps, that had been cut from white  men's heads at the massacre of Wyoming. The place they still call Painted  Post. Without drawing rein he sped along the hills that hem Lake Seneca,  then, striking deeper into the wilds, he reached a smaller lake, and  almost fell from his saddle before a rude tent near the shore. A new  grave had been dug close by, and he shuddered to think that perhaps he  had come too late, but a wrinkled Indian stepped forth at that moment and  waited his word.    \"I come,\" cried the youth,--\"to see the berry that springs from snow.\"    \"You come in time,\" answered Skenandoh. \"No, 'tis not in that grave. It  is my own child that is buried there. She was as a sister to the one you  seek, and she bade me restore the Drop Star to her mother,--the squaw  that we know as the New Moon's Light.\"    Stepping into the wigwam, he emerged again, clasping the wrist of a girl  of eighteen, whose robe he tore asunder at the throat, showing the white  breast, and on it a red birth-mark; then, leading her to the young man,  he said,--\"And now I must go to the setting sun.\" He slung a pouch about  him, loaded, not with arms and food, but stones, stepped into his canoe,  and paddled out upon the water, singing as he went a melancholy  chant--his deathsong. On gaining the middle of the lake he swung his  tomahawk and clove the bottom of the frail boat, so that it filled in a  moment and the chief sank from sight. The young man took his cousin to  her overjoyed mother, helped to win her back to the ways of civilized  life, and eventually married her. She took her Christian name again, but  left to the lake on whose banks she had lived so long her Indian name of  Drop Star--Kayutah.          THE PROPHET OF PALMYRA    It was at Palmyra, New York, that the principles of Mormonism were first  enunciated by Joseph Smith, who claimed to have found the golden plates  of the Book of Mormon in a hill-side in neighboring Manchester,--the  \"Hill of Cumorah,\"--to which he was led by angels. The plates were  written in characters similar to the masonic cabala, and he translated  them by divine aid, giving to the world the result of his discovery. The  Hebrew prophet Mormon was the alleged author of the record, and his son  Moroni buried it. The basis of Mormonism was, however, an unpublished  novel, called \"The Manuscript Found,\" that was read to Sidney Rigdon  (afterwards a Mormon elder) by its author, a clergyman, and that  formulated a creed for a hypothetical church. Smith had a slight local  celebrity, for he and his father were operators with the divining-rod,  and when he appropriated this creed a harmless and beneficent one, for  polygamy was a later \"inspiration\" of Brigham Young--and began to preach  it, in 1844, it gained many converts. His arrogation of the presidency of  the \"Church of Latter Day Saints\" and other rash performances won for him  the enmity of the Gentiles, who imprisoned and killed him at Carthage,  Missouri, leaving Brigham Young to lead the people across the deserts to  Salt Lake, where they prospered through thrift and industry.    It was claimed that in the van of this army, on the march to Utah, was  often seen a venerable man with silver beard, who never spoke, but who  would point the way whenever the pilgrims were faint or discouraged. When  they reached the spot where the temple was afterwards built, he struck  his staff into the earth and vanished.    At Hydesville, near Palmyra, spiritualism, as it is commonly called, came  into being on March 31, 1849, when certain of the departed announced  themselves by thumping on doors and tables in the house of the Fox  family, the survivors of which confessed the fraud nearly forty years  after. It is of interest to note that the ground whence these new  religions sprang was peopled by the Onondagas, the sacerdotal class of  the Algonquin tribe, who have preserved the ancient religious rites of  that great family until this day.          A VILLAIN'S CREMATION    Bramley's Mountain, near the present village of Bloomfield, New York, on  the edge of the Catskill group, was the home of a young couple that had  married with rejoicing and had taken up the duties and pleasures of  housekeeping with enthusiasm. To be sure, in those days housekeeping was  not a thing to be much afraid of, and the servant question had not come  up for discussion. The housewives did the work themselves, and the  husband had no valets. The domicile of this particular pair was merely a  tent of skins stretched around a frame of poles, and their furniture  consisted principally of furs strewn over the earth floor; but they loved  each other truly. The girl was thankful to be taken from her home to  live, because, up to the time of her marriage, she had been persecuted by  a morose and ill-looking fellow of her tribe, who laid siege to her  affection with such vehemence that the more he pleaded the greater was  her dislike; and now she hoped that she had seen the last of him. But  that was not to be. He lurked about the wigwam of the pair, torturing  himself with the sight of their felicity, and awaiting his chance to  prove his hate. This chance came when the husband had gone to Lake  Delaware to fish, for he rowed after and gave battle in the middle"]]]
