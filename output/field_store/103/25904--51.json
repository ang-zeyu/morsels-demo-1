[_Mme. van Praet._]          MUSHROOM OMELETTE    Toss the sliced mushrooms in butter, adding, if you wish, a little  mushroom ketchup. Break the eggs in a pan and beat them lightly  together, and cook for three minutes over a good fire. Slip the omelette  on a hot dish, spread with butter.          ASPARAGUS OMELETTE    This is made quite differently. Cook the asparagus-tops in salt and  water and drain them. Roll them in a little bechamel sauce. Break your  eggs into the pan into which you have put a little butter; stir them  with a fork in your left hand, adding salt and pepper with your right.  This will only take a minute. Add the asparagus-tops in the thick sauce;  this will take another minute. Roll or fold up the omelette and slip it  on a hot buttered dish.    [_Mme. van Praet._]          STUFFED EGGS    Hard-boil your eggs, allowing half an egg for each person. Take out the  yolk. While they are boiling and afterwards cooling in water, make a  small quantity of mayonnaise sauce. Peel the eggs, cut them through  lengthways, and take out the yolks. Crumble these with a little chopped  herbs, and add the mayonnaise. Fill the eggs with this mixture, and  place them in a dish with chopped lettuce round it, to which you may add  a little more of the sauce.    [_Mme. van Marcke de Lunessen_.]          POACHED EGGS, TOMATO SAUCE    Make some rounds of toast and butter them; place on each a slice of  tongue or of ham. Keep these hot, and poach as many eggs as you require.  Slip each egg on the toasts, and cover them quickly with a highly  seasoned tomato sauce.    [_Mme. van Marcke de Lunessen_.]          EGGS AND MUSHROOMS    Pick over half a pound of mushrooms, cut them in small pieces like dice,  and put them to stew in the oven with plenty of butter, pepper, and  salt. Make a thick white sauce, and you may add to it the juice from the  mushrooms when they are cooked; then stir in the mushrooms. Take three  hard-boiled eggs, and separate yolks from whites. Put into a shallow  vegetable-dish the whites cut up in small pieces, pour over them the  bechamel with the mushrooms, and finish up by sprinkling over the top  the hard-boiled yolks, which you have crumbled up with a fork.    [_Mme. Braconniere_.]          BELGIAN EGGS    Make some scrambled eggs, and place them on a very hot dish, and pour  round them a thick tomato sauce. Decorate the dish quickly with thick  rounds of tomato.          EGGS A LA RIBEAUCOURT    Butter some little paper cases, and let them dry in the oven. Put into  each one a pat of butter and let it melt lightly. Break an egg into each  case, taking care not to break the yolk, and put a bit of butter on each  yolk. Place in a quick oven till the whites are half set. At the moment  of serving take them out, and have ready some minced tongue or ham, to  sprinkle on them, and decorate with a big bit of truffle.          TO USE UP REMAINS OF MEAT    Cut in slices the remains of any cold meat, such as pork, beef, veal,  ham, or mutton. Melt in a pan a bit of salt butter the size of a walnut,  and put in it an onion cut into fine slices; let it get brown in the  hot butter. In another pan put a larger piece of butter rolled in a  soup-spoonful of flour; add to it the onion and butter, and add enough  water to prevent the sauce from getting very thick. Add, if you wish  it, a teaspoonful of meat-extract and a pinch of salt. Have ready some  mashed potatoes, but let them be very light. Place the slices of meat in  a fireproof dish, pour the sauce on them, then the mashed potatoes, and  put the dish in the oven, all well heated through. This is called in  Belgium \"_un philosophe_.\"    [_Paquerette_.]          VEAL WITH ONIONS    Take a lump of butter the size of an egg, and let it color in a  saucepan. Slice some onions and fry them in another pan. When fried,  add them to the butter with some sliced carrots, a few small onions, and  your pieces of veal, salt, and pepper. Add a small quantity of water,  and close the lid on the saucepan. When the meat is tender, you can  thicken the sauce with a little flour. This is a good way to use veal  that is hard, or parts that are not the best cuts.    [_Paquerette_.]          VEAL CAKE    Mince very finely three pounds of raw veal and one-fourth pound of pork.  It is better to do this at home than to have it done at the butcher's.  Put two slices of bread to soak in milk, add two yolks of eggs and the  whites, pepper and salt. Mix it well, working it for ten minutes. Then  let it rest for half-an-hour. Put it in a small stewpan, add a lump of  butter the size of a pigeon's egg, and put it in the oven. It will be  ready to serve when the juice has ceased to run out.    [_Paquerette_]          TO USE UP COLD MEAT    Take a fresh celery, wash it well, and remove the green leaves. Let it  boil till half-cooked in salted water. Drain it on a sieve, and then cut  it lengthways, and place minced meat of any kind, well seasoned, between  the two pieces. Tie them together with a thread and let them cook again  for a quarter of an hour, this time either in the same water and gently  simmered, or in the oven in a well-buttered dish. Other people, to avoid  the trouble of tying the two halves, spread the mince on each half and  cook it in the oven, laid flat in a fireproof dish. In this case put a  good lump of butter on each portion of mince.    [_L. Verhaeghe._]          FLEMISH CARBONADE    Put two onions to color in butter or in hot fat. Then add to them the  beef, which you have cut into pieces the size of a small cake. Let it  cook for a few minutes, then add pepper, salt, a carrot sliced, and  enough water to allow the meat to cook gently by the side of the fire,  allowing one and one-half hours for one and one-half pounds of meat. Ten  minutes before serving add to the sauce a little meat-juice or Liebig.  You may at the same time, if it is wished, cook potatoes with the meat  for about twenty minutes. Serve it all in a large dish, the meat in  the center and the potatoes round. The sauce is served separately, and  without being passed through the sieve.    [_L. Verhaeghe._]          A USE FOR COLD MUTTON    Cut the mutton into neat pieces, take away all fat and skin. Fry in  butter and add all sorts of vegetables in dice, with thyme, bay-leaves,  and parsley. Let all this stew very gently for two hours; you must add  more stock or water to prevent it getting dry. Keep the lid of the pan  on and, half-an-hour before serving, put in peeled potatoes. This dish  is served very liquid.    [_Mme. Spinette_.]          FLEMISH CARBONADES    Take four pounds of beef--there is a cut near the neck that is suitable  for this recipe. Cut the meat in small pieces (square) and fry them in  a pan. In another pan put a piece of refined fat and fry in it five big  onions that you have finely chopped. When these are well browned, add to  them the meat, sprinkling in also pepper, salt, mixed herbs. Cover all  with water, and let it cook for an hour with the lid on. After an hour's  cooking, add half a glass of beer, a slice of crumb of bread with a  light layer of mustard and three tablespoonfuls of best vinegar. Let  it cook again for three quarters of an hour. If the sauce is not  thick enough, add a little flour, taking care that it boils up again  afterwards.          FISH    When there remains any cold fish, take away all skin and bones, mixing  the flesh with salt, butter, pepper, and one or two raw eggs as you  wish. Take some small fireproof cases and place in each some lemon-juice  with a little melted butter and grated breadcrumbs. Bake the cases till  the top of the fish is of a golden color.          REMAINS OF FISH    Make a good white sauce, add pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg and juice  of a lemon. Add then your remains of fish and a few pickled shrimps.  Fill some shells with it and sprinkle over the top a good powdering of  grated Gruyere cheese. Lay a pat of butter in the middle of each shell  and put them in the oven. When they are colored a good golden brown,  serve them decorated with parsley.    [_Mme. Lekent_.]          GOOD RISSOLES    Mince any cold meat, adding to a pound of it one-half pound of fresh  lean pork, a chopped shallot and parsley, salt, pepper, a little nutmeg,  and bind with an egg, both yolk and white. Form into balls, and dip  them in flour, then color them in some butter, and when they are nicely  browned pour into the butter a little stock or meat-juice and water. Let  them gently cook in it for ten minutes, and serve.    [_Mme. Lekent_.]          CROQUETTES OF BOILED MEAT    I think that boiled meat when cold is often neglected as being  tasteless, but, prepared as I will show you, it will deserve your  approval.    Mince your boiled meat and put it into a thick white sauce well-spiced  with pepper, salt, and nutmeg, and let it remain for two hours. Then  prepare your croquettes by rolling the mixture in white of egg and fine  breadcrumbs. Put a piece of butter in the saucepan, sufficient to take  all the croquettes, and let them brown in it for about ten minutes. A  white sauce served with them is a good addition.    [_Mlle. A. Demeulemeester_.]          CARBONADES DONE WITH BEER    Cut the meat into slices that are thin rather than thick. Mince two  big onions and fry them till brown; then fry the slices till they are  colored on both sides. Pour on them first some beer, then a dash of  vinegar, adding thyme, pepper, and salt, and throw in also a slice of  crust of bread, which you have spread with mustard. Let this all simmer  for three hours.    [_Mme. Segur_.]          WALLOON ENTREE    Make some toasted bread, either cut in rounds or in squares, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7234"],[0,"Species and Varieties, Their Origin (#9)"],[1,"would be found. Such however, are not on record. Hence the  elementary species must be regarded as old and constant types.    The question naturally arises how these groups of nearly allied forms  may originally have been produced. Granting a common origin for all of  them, the changes may have been [51] simultaneous or successive.  According to the geographic distribution, the place of common origin  must probably be sought in the southern part of central Europe, perhaps  even in the vicinity of Lyons. Here we may assume that the old _Draba  verna_ has produced a host or a swarm of new types. Thence they must  have spread over Europe, but whether in doing so they have remained  constant, or whether some or many of them have repeatedly undergone  specific mutations, is of course unknown.    The main fact is, that such a small species as _Draba verna_ is not at  all a uniform type, but comprises over two hundred well distinguished  and constant forms.    It is readily granted that violets and whitlowgrasses are extreme  instances of systematic variability. Such great numbers of elementary  species are not often included in single species of the system. But the  numbers are of secondary importance, and the fact that systematic  species consist, as a rule, of more than one independent and constant  subspecies, retains its almost universal validity.    In some cases the systematic species are manifest groups, sharply  differentiated from one another. In other instances the groups of  elementary forms as they are shown by direct observation, have been  adjudged by many authors [52] to be too large to constitute species.  Hence the polymorphous genera, concerning the systematic subdivisions of  which hardly two authors agree. Brambles and roses are widely known  instances, but oaks, elms, apples, and pears, _Mentha_, _Prunu_s,  _Vitis_, _Lactuca_, _Cucumis_, _Cucurbita_ and numerous others are in  the same condition.    In some instances the existence of elementary species is so obvious,  that they have been described by taxonomists as systematic varieties or  even as good species. The primroses afford a widely known example.  Linnaeus called them _Primula veris_, and recognized three types as  pertaining to this species, but Jacquin and others have elevated these  subspecies to the full rank of species. They now bear the names of  _Primula elatior_ with larger, _P. officinalis_ with smaller flowers,  and _P. acaulis_. In the last named the common flower-stalk is lacking  and the flowers of the umbel seem to be borne in the arils of the basal  leaves.    In other genera such nearly allied species are more or less universally  recognized. _Galium Mollugo_ has been divided into _G. elatum_ with a  long and weak stem, and _G. erectum_ with shorter and erect stems;  _Cochlearia danica_, _anglica_ and _officinalis_ are so nearly allied as  to be hardly distinguishable. _Sagina apetala_ and _patula_, [53]  _Spergula media_ and _salina_ and many other pairs of allied species  have differentiating characters of the same value as those of the  elementary species of _Draba verna_. _Filago_, _Plantago_, _Carex_,  _Ficaria_ and a long series of other genera afford proofs of the same  close relation between smaller and larger groups of species. The  European frost-weeds or _Helianthemum_ include a group of species which  are so closely allied, that ordinary botanical descriptions are not  adequate to give any idea of their differentiating features. It is  almost impossible to determine them by means of the common analytical  keys. They have to be gathered from their various native localities and  cultivated side by side in the garden to bring out their differences.  Among the species of France, according to Jordan, _Helianthemum  polifolium_, _H. apenninum_, _H. pilosum_ and _H. pulverulentum_ are of  this character.    A species of cinquefoil, _Potentilla Tormentilla_, which is  distinguished by its quaternate flowers, occurs in Holland in two  distinct types, which have proved constant in my cultural experiments.  One of them has, broad petals, meeting together at the edges, and  constituting rounded saucer without breaks. The other has narrow petals,  which are strikingly separated from one another and show the sepals  between them. [54] In the same manner bluebells vary in the size and  shape of the corolla, which may be wide or narrow, bell-shaped or  conical, with the tips turned downwards, sidewards or backwards.    As a rule all of the more striking elementary types have been described  by local botanists under distinct specific names, while they are thrown  together into the larger systematic species by other authors, who study  the distribution of plants over larger portions of the world. Everything  depends on the point of view taken. Large floras require large species.  But the study of local floras yields the best results if the many forms  of the region are distinguished and described as completely as possible.  And the easiest way is to give to each of them a specific name. If two  or more elementary species are united in the same district, they are  often treated in this way, but if each region had its own type of some  given species, commonly the part is taken for the whole, and the sundry  forms are described under the same name, without further distinctions.    Of course these questions are all of a practical and conventional  nature, but involve the different methods in which different authors  deal with the same general fact. The fact is that systematic species are  compound groups, exactly like the genera and that their real units [55]  can only be recognized by comparative experimental studies.    Though the evidence already given might be esteemed to be sufficient for  our purpose, I should like to introduce a few more examples; two of them  pertain to American plants.    The Ipecac spurge or _Euphorbia Ipecacuanha_ occurs from Connecticut to  Florida, mainly near the coast, preferring dry and sandy soil. It is  often found by the roadsides. According to Britton and Brown's  \"Illustrated Flora\" it is glabrous or pubescent, with several or many  stems, ascending or nearly erect; with green or red leaves, which are  wonderfully variable in outline, from linear to orbicular, mostly  opposite, the upper sometimes whorled, the lower often alternate. The  glands of the involucres are elliptic or oblong, and even the seeds vary  in shape.    Such a wide range of variability evidently points to the existence of  some minor types. Dr. John Harshberger has made a study of those which  occur in the vicinity of Whitings in New Jersey. His types agree with  the description given above. Others were gathered by him at Brown's  Mills in the pinelands, New Jersey, where they grew in almost pure sand  in the bright sunlight. He observed still other differentiating  characters. The amount of seed [56] produced and the time of flowering  were variable to a remarkable degree.    Dr. Harshberger had the kindness to send me some dried specimens of the  most interesting of these types. They show that the peculiarities are  individual, and that each specimen has its own characters. It is very  probable that a comparative experimental study will prove the existence  of a large number of elementary species, differing in many points; they  will probably also show differences in the amount of the active chemical  substances, especially of emetine, which is usually recorded as present  in about 1%, but which will undoubtedly be found in larger quantities in  some, and in smaller quantities in other elementary species. In this way  the close and careful distinction of the really existing units might  perhaps prove of practical importance.    MacFarlane has studied the beach-plum or _Prunus maritima_, which is  abundant along the coast regions of the Eastern States from Virginia to  New Brunswick. It often covers areas from two to two hundred acres in  extent, sometimes to the exclusion of other plants. It is most prolific  on soft drifting sand near the sea or along the shore, where it may at  times be washed with ocean-spray. The fruit usually become ripe about  the middle of August, and show extreme [57] variations in size, shape,  color, taste, consistency and maturation period, indicating the  existence of separate races or elementary species, with widely differing  qualities. The earlier varieties begin to ripen from August 10 to 20,  and a continuous supply can be had till September 10, while a few good  varieties continue to ripen till September 20. But even late in October  some other types are still found maturing their fruits.    Exact studies were made of fruit and stone variations, and their  characteristics as to color, weight, size, shape and consistency were  fully described. Similar variations have been observed, as is well  known, in the cultivated plums. Fine blue-black fruits were seen on some  shrubs and purplish or yellow fruits on others. Some exhibit a firmer  texture and others a more watery pulp. Even the stones show differences  which are suggestive of distinct races.    Recently Mr. Luther Burbank of Santa Rosa, California, has made use of  the beach-plum to produce useful new varieties. He observed that it is a  very hardy species, and never fails to bear, growing under the most  trying conditions of dry and sandy, or of rocky and even of heavy soil.  The fruits of the wild shrubs are utterly worthless for anything but  preserving. [58] But by means of crossing with other species and  especially with the Japanese plums, the hardy qualities of the  beach-plum have been united with the size, flavor and other valuable  qualities of the fruit, and a group of new plums have been produced with  bright colors, ovoid and globular forms which are never flattened and  have no suture. The experiments were not finished, when I visited Mr.  Burbank in July, 1904, and still more startling improvements were said"]]]
