The  government has taken measures to curb violent crime and to revive economic  activity and trade.  The economy is bolstered by remittances from abroad  of $400-$600 million annually, mostly from Greece and Italy. Agriculture,  which accounts for 52% of GDP, is held back because of frequent drought  and the need to modernize equipment and consolidate small plots of  land. Severe energy shortages are forcing small firms out of business,  increasing unemployment, scaring off foreign investors, and spurring  inflation.

The mob assailed his carriage with stones  just as he was entering his own door; and if the coachman had not made  a sudden jerk into the court-yard, and the domestics closed the gate  immediately, he would, in all probability, have been dragged out and  torn to pieces. On the following day, his wife and daughter were also  assailed by the mob as they were returning in their carriage from the  races. When the Regent was informed of these occurrences he sent Law a  strong detachment of Swiss guards, who were stationed night and day in  the court of his residence. The public indignation at last increased so  much, that Law, finding his own house, even with this guard, insecure,  took refuge in the Palais Royal, in the apartments of the Regent.    The Chancellor, D'Aguesseau, who had been dismissed in 1718 for his  opposition to the projects of Law, was now recalled to aid in the  restoration of credit. The Regent acknowledged too late, that he had  treated with unjustifiable harshness and mistrust one of the ablest,  and perhaps the sole honest public man of that corrupt period. He had  retired ever since his disgrace to his country-house at Fresnes, where,  in the midst of severe but delightful philosophic studies, he had  forgotten the intrigues of an unworthy court. Law himself, and the  Chevalier de Conflans, a gentleman of the Regent's household, were  despatched in a post-chaise, with orders to bring the ex-chancellor to  Paris along with them. D'Aguesseau consented to render what assistance  he could, contrary to the advice of his friends, who did not approve  that he should accept any recall to office of which Law was the bearer.  On his arrival in Paris, five counsellors of the Parliament were  admitted to confer with the Commissary of Finance, and on the 1st of  June an order was published, abolishing the law which made it criminal  to amass coin to the amount of more than five hundred livres. Every one  was permitted to have as much specie as he pleased. In order that the  bank-notes might be withdrawn, twenty-five millions of new notes were  created, on the security of the revenues of the city of Paris, at  two-and-a-half per cent. The bank-notes withdrawn were publicly burned  in front of the Hotel de Ville. The new notes were principally of  the value of ten livres each; and on the 10th of June the bank was  re-opened, with a sufficiency of silver coin to give in change for them.    These measures were productive of considerable advantage. All the  population of Paris hastened to the bank, to get coin for their small  notes; and silver becoming scarce, they were paid in copper. Very few  complained that this was too heavy, although poor fellows might be  continually seen toiling and sweating along the streets, laden with  more than they could comfortably carry, in the shape of change for fifty  livres. The crowds around the bank were so great, that hardly a day  passed that some one was not pressed to death. On the 9th of July, the  multitude was so dense and clamorous that the guards stationed at the  entrance of the Mazarin Gardens closed the gate, and refused to admit  any more. The crowd became incensed, and flung stones through the  railings upon the soldiers. The latter, incensed in their turn,  threatened to fire upon the people. At that instant one of them was hit  by a stone, and, taking up his piece, he fired into the crowd. One man  fell dead immediately, and another was severely wounded. It was every  instant expected that a general attack would have been commenced upon  the bank; but the gates of the Mazarin Gardens being opened to the  crowd, who saw a whole troop of soldiers, with their bayonets fixed,  ready to receive them, they contented themselves by giving vent to their  indignation in groans and hisses.    Eight days afterwards the concourse of people was so tremendous, that  fifteen persons were squeezed to death at the doors of the bank.  The people were so indignant that they took three of the bodies on  stretchers before them, and proceeded, to the number of seven or eight  thousand, to the gardens of the Palais Royal, that they might show the  Regent the misfortunes that he and Law had brought upon the country.  Law's coachman, who was sitting on the box of his master's carriage,  in the court-yard of the palace, happened to have more zeal than  discretion, and, not liking that the mob should abuse his master, he  said, loud enough to be overheard by several persons, that they were  all blackguards, and deserved to be hanged. The mob immediately set upon  him, and, thinking that Law was in the carriage, broke it to pieces. The  imprudent coachman narrowly escaped with his life. No further mischief  was done; a body of troops making their appearance, the crowd quietly  dispersed, after an assurance had been given by the Regent that the  three bodies they had brought to show him should be decently buried at  his own expense. The Parliament was sitting at the time of this uproar,  and the President took upon himself to go out and see what was the  matter. On his return he informed the councillors, that Law's carriage  had been broken by the mob. All the members rose simultaneously, and  expressed their joy by a loud shout, while one man, more zealous in  his hatred than the rest, exclaimed, \"And Law himself, is he torn to  pieces?\" [The Duchess of Orleans gives a different version of this  story; but whichever be the true one, the manifestation of such feeling  in a legislative assembly was not very creditable. She says, that the  President was so transported with joy, that he was seized with a rhyming  fit, and, returning into the hall, exclaimed to the members:--         \"Messieurs! Messieurs! bonne nouvelle!       Le carfosse de Lass est reduit en canelle!\"]    Much undoubtedly depended on the credit of the Company of the Indies,  which was answerable for so great a sum to the nation. It was,  therefore, suggested in the council of the ministry, that any privileges  which could be granted to enable it to fulfil its engagements, would be  productive of the best results. With this end in view, it was proposed  that the exclusive privilege of all maritime commerce should be  secured to it, and an edict to that effect was published. But it was  unfortunately forgotten that by such a measure all the merchants of  the country would be ruined. The idea of such an immense privilege was  generally scouted by the nation, and petition on petition was presented  to the Parliament, that they would refuse to register the decree. They  refused accordingly, and the Regent, remarking that they did nothing but  fan the flame of sedition, exiled them to Blois. At the intercession  of D'Aguesseau, the place of banishment was changed to Pontoise, and  thither accordingly the councillors repaired, determined to set the  Regent at defiance. They made every arrangement for rendering their  temporary exile as agreeable as possible. The President gave the most  elegant suppers, to which he invited all the gayest and wittiest company  of Paris. Every night there was a concert and ball for the ladies. The  usually grave and solemn judges and councillors joined in cards  and other diversions, leading for several weeks a life of the most  extravagant pleasure, for no other purpose than to show the Regent of  how little consequence they deemed their banishment, and that when they  willed it, they could make Pontoise a pleasanter residence than Paris.    Of all the nations in the world the French are the most renowned for  singing over their grievances. Of that country it has been remarked with  some truth, that its whole history may be traced in its songs. When Law,  by the utter failure of his best-laid plans, rendered himself obnoxious,  satire of course seized hold upon him, and, while caricatures of his  person appeared in all the shops, the streets resounded with songs, in  which neither he nor the Regent was spared. Many of these songs were far  from decent; and one of them in particular counselled the application of  all his notes to the most ignoble use to which paper can be applied. But  the following, preserved in the letters of the Duchess of Orleans, was  the best and the most popular, and was to be heard for months in all the  carrefours of Paris. The application of the chorus is happy enough:--         Aussitot que Lass arriva       Dans notre bonne ville,       Monsieur le Regent publia       Que Lass serait utile       Pour retablir la nation.       La faridondaine! la faridondon.       Mais il nous a tous enrich!,       Biribi!       A la facon de Barbari,       Mort ami!         Ce parpaillot, pour attirer       Tout l'argent de la France,       Songea d'abord a s'assurer       De notre confiance.       Il fit son abjuration.       La faridondaine! la faridondon!       Mais le fourbe s'est converti,       Biribi!       A la facon de Barbari,       Mon ami!         Lass, le fils aine de Satan       Nous met tous a l'aumone,       Il nous a pris tout notre argent       Et n'en rend a personne.       Mais le Regent, humain et bon,       La faridondaine! la faridondon!       Nous rendra ce qu'on nous a pris,       Biribi!       A la facon de Barbari,       Mon ami!    The following smart epigram is of the same date:--         Lundi, j'achetai des actions;       Mardi, je gagnai des millions;       Mercredi, j'arrangeai mon menage,       Jeudi, je pris un equipage,       Vendredi, je m'en fus au bal,       Et Samedi, a l'Hopital.    Among the caricatures that were abundantly published, and that showed  as plainly as graver matters, that the nation had awakened to a sense of  its folly, was one, a fac-simile of which is preserved in the \"Memoires  de la Regence.\" It was thus described by its author: \"The 'Goddess of  Shares,\" in her triumphal car, driven by the Goddess of Folly.
