But the years go on, and friends have an end. Life     spills faster than the years,\" he said. And he would say no more,     but would walk with me even to my father's door. \"May the Blessed     Virgin and all the Saints be with you,\" he said at parting, \"if you     will have a blessing from them. And tell him who is beyond and away     in Egypt that old Soolsby's busy making a chair for him to sit in     when the scarlet cloth is spread, and the East and West come to     salaam before him. Tell him the old man says his fluting will be     heard.\"       And now, David, I have told thee all, nearly. Remains to say that     thy one letter did our hearts good. My father reads it over and     over, and shakes his head sadly, for, truth is, he has a fear that     the world may lay its hand upon thee. One thing I do observe, his     heart is hard set against Lord Eglington. In degree it has ever     been so; but now it is like a constant frown upon his forehead. I     see him at his window looking out towards the Cloistered House; and     if our neighbour comes forth, perhaps upon his hunter, or now in his     cart, or again with his dogs, he draws his hat down upon his eyes     and whispers to himself. I think he is ever setting thee off     against Lord Eglington; and that is foolish, for Eglington is but a     man of the earth earthy. His is the soul of the adventurer.       Now what more to be set down? I must ask thee how is thy friend Ebn     Ezra Bey? I am glad thee did find all he said was true, and that in     Damascus thee was able to set a mark by my uncle's grave. But that     the Prince Pasha of Egypt has set up a claim against my uncle's     property is evil news; though, thanks be to God, as my father says,     we have enough to keep us fed and clothed and housed. But do thee     keep enough of thy inheritance to bring thee safe home again to     those who love thee. England is ever grey, Davy, but without thee     it is grizzled--all one \"Quaker drab,\" as says the Philistine. But     it is a comely and a good land, and here we wait for thee.       In love and remembrance.       I am thy mother's sister, thy most loving friend.                           FAITH.    David received this letter as he was mounting a huge white Syrian donkey  to ride to the Mokattam Hills, which rise sharply behind Cairo, burning  and lonely and large. The cities of the dead Khalifas and Mamelukes  separated them from the living city where the fellah toiled, and Arab,  Bedouin, Copt strove together to intercept the fruits of his toiling, as  it passed in the form of taxes to the Palace of the Prince Pasha; while  in the dark corners crouched, waiting, the cormorant usurers--Greeks,  Armenians, and Syrians, a hideous salvage corps, who saved the house  of a man that they might at last walk off with his shirt and the cloth  under which he was carried to his grave. In a thousand narrow streets  and lanes, in the warm glow of the bazaars, in earth-damp huts, by  blistering quays, on the myriad ghiassas on the river, from long before  sunrise till the sunset-gun boomed from the citadel rising beside the  great mosque whose pinnacles seem to touch the blue, the slaves of  the city of Prince Kaid ground out their lives like corn between the  millstones.    David had been long enough in Egypt to know what sort of toiling it was.  A man's labour was not his own. The fellah gave labour and taxes and  backsheesh and life to the State, and the long line of tyrants above  him, under the sting of the kourbash; the high officials gave backsheesh  to the Prince Pasha, or to his Mouffetish, or to his Chief Eunuch, or to  his barber, or to some slave who had his ear.    But all the time the bright, unclouded sun looked down on a smiling  land, and in Cairo streets the din of the hammers, the voices of the  boys driving heavily laden donkeys, the call of the camel-drivers  leading their caravans into the great squares, the clang of the brasses  of the sherbet-sellers, the song of the vendor of sweetmeats, the drone  of the merchant praising his wares, went on amid scenes of wealth and  luxury, and the city glowed with colour and gleamed with light. Dark  faces grinned over the steaming pot at the door of the cafes, idlers  on the benches smoked hasheesh, female street-dancers bared their faces  shamelessly to the men, and indolent musicians beat on their tiny drums,  and sang the song of \"O Seyyid,\" or of \"Antar\"; and the reciter gave  his sing-song tale from a bench above his fellows. Here a devout Muslim,  indifferent to the presence of strangers, turned his face to the East,  touched his forehead to the ground, and said his prayers. There, hung to  a tree by a deserted mosque near by, the body of one who was with  them all an hour before, and who had paid the penalty for some real  or imaginary crime; while his fellows blessed Allah that the storm had  passed them by. Guilt or innocence did not weigh with them; and the dead  criminal, if such he were, who had drunk his glass of water and prayed  to Allah, was, in their sight, only fortunate and not disgraced, and had  \"gone to the bosom of Allah.\" Now the Muezzin from a minaret called to  prayer, and the fellah in his cotton shirt and yelek heard, laid his  load aside, and yielded himself to his one dear illusion, which would  enable him to meet with apathy his end--it might be to-morrow!--and go  forth to that plenteous heaven where wives without number awaited him,  where fields would yield harvests without labour, where rich food in  gold dishes would be ever at his hand. This was his faith.    David had now been in the country six months, rapidly perfecting his  knowledge of Arabic, speaking it always to his servant Mahommed Hassan,  whom he had picked from the streets. Ebn Ezra Bey had gone upon his own  business to Fazougli, the tropical Siberia of Egypt, to liberate, by  order of Prince Kaid,--and at a high price--a relative banished there.  David had not yet been fortunate with his own business--the settlement  of his Uncle Benn's estate--though the last stages of negotiation with  the Prince Pasha seemed to have been reached. When he had brought the  influence of the British Consulate to bear, promises were made, doors  were opened wide, and Pasha and Bey offered him coffee and talked to  him sympathetically. They had respect for him more than for most Franks,  because the Prince Pasha had honoured him with especial favour. Perhaps  because David wore his hat always and the long coat with high collar  like a Turk, or because Prince Kaid was an acute judge of human nature,  and also because honesty was a thing he greatly desired--in others--and  never found near his own person; however it was, he had set David high  in his esteem at once. This esteem gave greater certainty that any  backsheesh coming from the estate of Benn Claridge would not be sifted  through many hands on its way to himself. Of Benn Claridge Prince Kaid  had scarcely even heard until he died; and, indeed, it was only within  the past few years that the Quaker merchant had extended his business to  Egypt and had made his headquarters at Assiout, up the river.    David's donkey now picked its way carefully through the narrow streets  of the Moosky. Arabs and fellaheen squatting at street corners looked at  him with furtive interest. A foreigner of this character they had never  before seen, with coat buttoned up like an Egyptian official in the  presence of his superior, and this wide, droll hat on his head. David  knew that he ran risks, that his confidence invited the occasional  madness of a fanatical mind, which makes murder of the infidel a  passport to heaven; but as a man he took his chances, and as a Christian  he believed he would suffer no mortal hurt till his appointed time. He  was more Oriental, more fatalist, than he knew. He had also early in his  life learned that an honest smile begets confidence; and his face, grave  and even a little austere in outline, was usually lighted by a smile.    From the Mokattam Hills, where he read Faith's letter again, his back  against one of the forts which Napoleon had built in his Egyptian days,  he scanned the distance. At his feet lay the great mosque, and the  citadel, whose guns controlled the city, could pour into it a lava  stream of shot and shell. The Nile wound its way through the green  plains, stretching as far to the north as eye could see between the opal  and mauve and gold of the Libyan Hills. Far over in the western vista a  long line of trees, twining through an oasis flanking the city, led out  to a point where the desert abruptly raised its hills of yellow sand.  Here, enormous, lonely, and cynical, the pyramids which Cheops had  built, the stone sphinx of Ghizeh, kept faith with the desert in the  glow of rainless land-reminders ever that the East, the mother of  knowledge, will by knowledge prevail; that:              \"The thousand years of thy insolence            The thousand years of thy faith,            Will be paid in fiery recompense,            And a thousand years of bitter death.\"    \"The sword--for ever the sword,\" David said to himself, as he looked:  \"Rameses and David and Mahomet and Constantine, and how many conquests  have been made in the name of God! But after other conquests there have  been peace and order and law. Here in Egypt it is ever the sword, the  survival of the strongest.\"    As he made his way down the hillside again he fell to thinking upon all  Faith had written. The return of the drunken chair-maker made a deep  impression on him--almost as deep as the waking dreams he had had of his  uncle calling him.    \"Soolsby and me--what is there between Soolsby and me?\" he asked himself  now as he made his way past the tombs of the Mamelukes. \"He and I are  as far apart as the poles, and yet"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6312"],[0,"Representative Men: Seven Lectures (#9)"],[1,"in his  Academy, as the organ through which every considered opinion shall be  announced, and whose biography he has likewise so labored, that the  historic facts are lost in the light of Plato's mind. Socrates and  Plato are the double star, which the most powerful instruments will  not entirely separate. Socrates, again, in his traits and genius, is  the best example of that synthesis which constitutes Plato's  extraordinary power. Socrates, a man of humble stem, but honest enough;  of the commonest history; of a personal homeliness so remarkable, as  to be a cause of wit in others,--the rather that his broad good nature  and exquisite taste for a joke invited the sally, which was sure to  be paid. The players personated him on the stage; the potters copied  his ugly face on their stone jugs. He was a cool fellow, adding to his  humor a perfect temper, and a knowledge of his man, be he who he might  whom he talked with, which laid the companion open to certain defeat  in any debate,--and in debate he immoderately delighted. The young men  are prodigiously fond of him, and invite him to their feasts, whither  he goes for conversation. He can drink, too; has the strongest head  in Athens; and, after leaving the whole party under the table, goes  away, as if nothing had happened, to begin new dialogues with somebody  that is sober. In short, he was what our country-people call an old  one.    He affected a good many citizen-like tastes, was monstrously fond of  Athens, hated trees, never willingly went beyond the walls, knew the  old characters, valued the bores and philistines, thought everything  in Athens a little better than anything in any other place. He was  plain as a Quaker in habit and speech, affected low phrases, and  illustrations from cocks and quails, soup-pans and sycamore-spoons,  grooms and farriers, and unnameable offices,--especially if he talked  with any superfine person. He had a Franklin-like wisdom. Thus, he  showed one who was afraid to go on foot to Olympia, that it was no  more than his daily walk within doors, if continuously extended, would  easily reach.    Plain old uncle as he was, with his great ears,--an immense talker,--the  rumor ran, that, on one or two occasions, in the war with Boeotia, he  had shown a determination which had covered the retreat of a troop;  and there was some story that, under cover of folly, he had, in the  city government, when one day he chanced to hold a seat there, evinced  a courage in opposing singly the popular voice, which had well-nigh  ruined him. He is very poor; but then he is hardy as a soldier, and  can live on a few olives; usually, in the strictest sense, on bread  and water, except when entertained by his friends. His necessary  expenses were exceedingly small, and no one could live as he did. He  wore no undergarment; his upper garment was the same for summer and  winter; and he went barefooted; and it is said that, to procure the  pleasure, which he loves, of talking at his ease all day with the most  elegant and cultivated young men, he will now and then return to his  shop, and carve statues, good or bad, for sale. However that be, it  is certain that he had grown to delight in nothing else than this  conversation; and that, under his hypocritical pretense of knowing  nothing, he attacks and brings down all the fine speakers, all the  fine philosophers of Athens, whether natives, or strangers from Asia  Minor and the islands. Nobody can refuse to talk with him, he is so  honest, and really curious to know; a man who was willingly confuted,  if he did not speak the truth, and who willingly confuted others,  asserting what was false; and not less pleased when confuted than when  confuting; for he thought not any evil happened to men, of such a  magnitude as false opinion respecting the just and unjust. A pitiless  disputant, who knows nothing, but the bounds of whose conquering  intelligence no man had ever reached; whose temper was imperturbable;  whose dreadful logic was always leisurely and sportive; so careless  and ignorant as to disarm the weariest, and draw them, in the  pleasantest manner, into horrible doubts and confusion. But he always  knew the way out; knew it, yet would not tell it. No escape; he drives  them to terrible choices by his dilemmas, and tosses the Hippiases and  Gorgiases, with their grand reputations, as a boy tosses his balls.  The tyrannous realist!-Meno has discoursed a thousand times, at length,  on virtue, before many companies, and very well, as it appeared to  him; but, at this moment, he cannot even tell what it is,--this  cramp-fish of a Socrates has so bewitched him.    This hard-headed humorist, whose strange conceits, drollery, and  _bon-hommie_, diverted the young patricians, whilst the rumor of  his sayings and quibbles gets abroad every day, turns out, in a sequel,  to have a probity as invincible as his logic and to be either insane,  or, at least, under cover of this play, enthusiastic in his religion.  When accused before the judges of subverting the popular creed, he  affirms the immortality of the soul, the future reward and punishment;  and, refusing to recant, in a caprice of the popular government, was  condemned to die, and sent to the prison. Socrates entered the prison,  and took away all ignominy from the place, which could not be a prison,  whilst he was there. Crito bribed the jailor; but Socrates would not  go out by treachery. \"Whatever inconvenience ensue, nothing is to be  preferred before justice. These things I hear like pipes and drums,  whose sound makes me deaf to everything you say.\" The fame of this  prison, the fame of the discourses there, and the drinking of the  hemlock, are one of the most precious passages in the history of the  world.    The rare coincidence, in one ugly body, of the droll and the martyr,  the keen street and market debater with the sweetest saint known to  any history at that time, had forcibly struck the mind of Plato, so  capacious of these contrasts; and the figure of Socrates, by a  necessity, placed itself in the foreground of the scene, as the fittest  dispenser of the intellectual treasurers he had to communicate. It was  a rare fortune, that this Aesod of the mob, and this robed scholar,  should meet, to make each other immortal in their mutual faculty. The  strange synthesis, in the character of Socrates, capped the synthesis  in the mind of Plato. Moreover, by this means, he was able, in the  direct way, and without envy, to avail himself of the wit and weight  of Socrates, to which unquestionably his own debt was great; and these  derived again their principal advantage from the perfect art of Plato.    It remains to say, that the defect of Plato in power is only that which  results inevitably from his quality. He is intellectual in his aim;  and, therefore, in expression, literary. Mounting into heaven, driving  into the pit, expounding the laws of the state, the passion of love,  the remorse of crime, the hope of the parting soul,--he is literary,  and never otherwise. It is almost the sole deduction from the merit  of Plato, that his writings have not,--what is, no doubt, incident  to this regnancy of intellect in his work,--the vital authority which  the screams of prophets and the sermons of unlettered Arabs and Jews  possess. There is an interval; and to cohesion, contact is necessary.    I know not what can be said in reply to this criticism, but that we  have come to a fact in the nature of things: an oak is not an orange.  The qualities of sugar remain with sugar, and those of salt, with salt.    In the second place, he has not a system. The dearest defenders and  disciples are at fault. He attempted a theory of the universe, and his  theory is not complete or self-evident. One man thinks he means this,  and another, that: he has said one thing in one place, and the reverse  of it in another place. He is charged with having failed to make the  transition from ideas to matter. Here is the world, sound as a nut,  perfect, not the smallest piece of chaos left, never a stitch nor an  end, not a mark of haste, or botching, or second thought; but the  theory of the world is a thing of shreds and patches.    The longest wave is quickly lost in the sea. Plato would willingly  have a Platonism, a known and accurate expression for the world, and  it should be accurate. It shall be the world passed through the mind  of Plato,--nothing less. Every atom shall have the Platonic tinge;  every atom, every relation or quality you knew before, you shall know  again and find here, but now ordered; not nature, but art. And you  shall feel that Alexander indeed overran, with men and horses, some  countries of the planet; but countries, and things of which countries  are made, elements, planet itself, laws of planet and of men, have  passed through this man as bread into his body, and become no longer  bread, but body: so all this mammoth morsel has become Plato. He has  clapped copyright on the world. This is the ambition of individualism.  But the mouthful proves too large. Boa constrictor has good will to  eat it, but he is foiled. He falls abroad in the attempt; and biting,  gets strangled: the bitten world holds the biter fast by his own teeth.  There he perishes: unconquered nature lives on, and forgets him. So  it fares with all: so must it fare with Plato. In view of eternal  nature, Plato turns out to be philosophical exercitations. He argues  on this side, and on that. The acutest German, the lovingest disciple,  could never tell what Platonism was; indeed, admirable texts can be  quoted on both sides of every great question from him.    These things we are forced to say, if we must consider the effort of  Plato, or of any philosopher, to dispose of Nature,--which will not  be disposed of. No power of genius has ever yet had the smallest success  in explaining existence. The perfect enigma remains. But there is an  injustice "]]]
