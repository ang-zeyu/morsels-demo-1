[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5067"],[0,"The Rainbow Trail (#9)"],[1,"to trust you. Over here in the wild canyon country  there's a village of Mormons' sealed wives. It's in Arizona, perhaps  twenty miles from here, and near the Utah line. When the United States  government began to persecute, or prosecute, the Mormons for polygamy,  the Mormons over here in Stonebridge took their sealed wives and moved  them out of Utah, just across the line. They built houses, established  a village there. I'm the only Gentile who knows about it. And I pack  supplies every few weeks in to these women. There are perhaps fifty  women, mostly young--second or third or fourth wives of Mormons--sealed  wives. And I want you to understand that sealed means SEALED in all that  religion or loyalty can get out of the word. There are also some old  women and old men in the village, but they hardly count. And there's a  flock of the finest children you ever saw in your life.    \"The idea of the Mormons must have been to escape prosecution. The  law of the government is one wife for each man--no more. All over Utah  polygamists have been arrested. The Mormons are deeply concerned. I  believe they are a good, law-abiding people. But this law is a direct  blow at their religion. In my opinion they can't obey both. And  therefore they have not altogether given up plural wives. Perhaps they  will some day. I have no proof, but I believe the Mormons of Stonebridge  pay secret night visits to their sealed wives across the line in the  lonely, hidden village.    \"Now once over in Stonebridge I overheard some Mormons talking about a  girl who was named Fay Larkin. I never forgot the name. Later I heard  the name in this sealed-wife village. But, as I told you, I never heard  of Lassiter or Jane Withersteen. Still, if Mormons had found them I  would never have heard of it. And Deception Pass--that might be the  Sagi.... I'm not surprised at your rainbow-chasing adventure. It's  a great story.... This Fay Larkin I've heard of MIGHT be your Fay  Larkin--I almost believe so. Shefford, I'll help you find out.\"    \"Yes, yes--I must know,\" replied Shefford. \"Oh, I hope, I pray we can  find her! But--I'd rather she was dead--if she's not still hidden in the  valley.\"    \"Naturally. You've dreamed yourself into rescuing this lost Fay  Larkin.... But, Shefford, you're old enough to know life doesn't work  out as you want it to. One way or another I fear you're in for a bitter  disappointment.\"    \"Withers, take me to the village.\"    \"Shefford, you're liable to get in bad out here,\" said the trader,  gravely.    \"I couldn't be any more ruined than I am now,\" replied Shefford,  passionately.    \"But there's risk in this--risk such as you never had,\" persisted  Withers.    \"I'll risk anything.\"    \"Reckon this is a funny deal for a sheep-trader to have on his hands,\"  continued Withers. \"Shefford, I like you. I've a mind to see you through  this. It's a damn strange story.... I'll tell you what--I will help you.  I'll give you a job packing supplies in to the village. I meant to turn  that over to a Mormon cowboy--Joe Lake. The job shall be yours, and I'll  go with you first trip. Here's my hand on it.... Now, Shefford, I'm more  curious about you than I was before you told your story. What ruined  you? As we're to be partners, you can tell me now. I'll keep your  secret. Maybe I can do you good.\"    Shefford wanted to confess, yet it was hard. Perhaps, had he not been so  agitated, he would not have answered to impulse. But this trader was a  man--a man of the desert--he would understand.    \"I told you I was a clergyman,\" said Shefford in low voice. \"I didn't  want to be one, but they made me one. I did my best. I failed.... I had  doubts of religion--of the Bible--of God, as my Church believed in them.  As I grew older thought and study convinced me of the narrowness of  religion as my congregation lived it. I preached what I believed. I  alienated them. They put me out, took my calling from me, disgraced me,  ruined me.\"    \"So that's all!\" exclaimed Withers, slowly. \"You didn't believe in the  God of the Bible.... Well, I've been in the desert long enough to know  there IS a God, but probably not the one your Church worships. ...  Shefford, go to the Navajo for a faith!\"    Shefford had forgotten the presence of Nas Ta Bega, and perhaps Withers  had likewise. At this juncture the Indian rose to his full height, and  he folded his arms to stand with the somber pride of a chieftain while  his dark, inscrutable eyes were riveted upon Shefford. At that moment  he seemed magnificent. How infinitely more he seemed than just a common  Indian who had chanced to befriend a white man! The difference was  obscure to Shefford. But he felt that it was there in the Navajo's  mind. Nas Ta Bega's strange look was not to be interpreted. Presently he  turned and passed from the room.    \"By George!\" cried Withers, suddenly, and he pounded his knee with his  fist. \"I'd forgotten.\"    \"What?\" ejaculated Shefford.    \"Why, that Indian understood every word we said. He knows English. He's  educated. Well, if this doesn't beat me.... Let me tell you about Nas Ta  Bega.\"    Withers appeared to be recalling something half forgotten.    \"Years ago, in fifty-seven, I think, Kit Carson with his soldiers chased  the Navajo tribes and rounded them up to be put on reservations. But he  failed to catch all the members of one tribe. They escaped up into wild  canyon like the Sagi. The descendants of these fugitives live there now  and are the finest Indians on earth--the finest because unspoiled by the  white man. Well, as I got the story, years after Carson's round-up one  of his soldiers guided some interested travelers in here. When they  left they took an Indian boy with them to educate. From what I know of  Navajos I'm inclined to think the boy was taken against his parents'  wish. Anyway, he was taken. That boy was Nas Ta Bega. The story goes  that he was educated somewhere. Years afterward, and perhaps not long  before I came in here, he returned to his people. There have been  missionaries and other interested fools who have given Indians a white  man's education. In all the instances I know of, these educated Indians  returned to their tribes, repudiating the white man's knowledge, habits,  life, and religion. I have heard that Nas Ta Bega came back, laid down  the white man's clothes along with the education, and never again showed  that he had known either.    \"You have just seen how strangely he acted. It's almost certain he heard  our conversation. Well, it doesn't matter. He won't tell. He can hardly  be made to use an English word. Besides, he's a noble red man, if there  ever was one. He has been a friend in need to me. If you stay long out  here you'll learn something from the Indians. Nas Ta Bega has befriended  you, too, it seems. I thought he showed unusual interest in you.\"    \"Perhaps that was because I saved his sister--well, to be charitable,  from the rather rude advances of a white man,\" said Shefford, and he  proceeded to tell of the incident that occurred at Red Lake.    \"Willetts!\" exclaimed Withers, with much the same expression that  Presbrey had used. \"I never met him. But I know about him. He's--well,  the Indians don't like him much. Most of the missionaries are good  men--good for the Indians, in a way, but sometimes one drifts out here  who is bad. A bad missionary teaching religion to savages! Queer, isn't  it? The queerest part is the white people's blindness--the blindness of  those who send the missionaries. Well, I dare say Willetts isn't very  good. When Presbrey said that was Willetts's way of teaching religion he  meant just what he said. If Willetts drifts over here he'll be risking  much.... This you told me explains Nas Ta Bega's friendliness toward  you, and also his bringing his sister Glen Naspa to live with relatives  up in the pass. She had been living near Red Lake.\"    \"Do you mean Nas Ta Bega wants to keep his sister far removed from  Willetts?\" inquired Shefford.    \"I mean that,\" replied Withers, \"and I hope he's not too late.\"    Later Shefford went outdoors to walk and think. There was no moon, but  the stars made light enough to cast his shadow on the ground. The dark,  illimitable expanse of blue sky seemed to be glittering with numberless  points of fire. The air was cold and still. A dreaming silence lay over  the land. Shefford saw and felt all these things, and their effect was  continuous and remained with him and helped calm him. He was conscious  of a burden removed from his mind. Confession of his secret had been  like tearing a thorn from his flesh, but, once done, it afforded him  relief and a singular realization that out here it did not matter much.  In a crowd of men all looking at him and judging him by their standards  he had been made to suffer. Here, if he were judged at all, it would be  by what he could do, how he sustained himself and helped others.    He walked far across the valley toward the low bluffs, but they did  not seem to get any closer. And, finally, he stopped beside a stone and  looked around at the strange horizon and up at the heavens. He did not  feel utterly aloof from them, nor alone in a waste, nor a useless atom  amid incomprehensible forces. Something like a loosened mantle fell from  about him, dropping down at his feet; and all at once he was conscious  of freedom. He did not understand in the least why abasement left  him, but it was so. He had come a long way, in bitterness, in despair,  believing himself to be what men had called him. The desert and the  stars and the wind, the silence of the night, the loneliness of this  vast country where there was room for a thousand cities--these somehow  vaguely, yet surely, bade him lift his head. They withheld their secret,  but they made a promise. The thing which he had been feeling every day  and every night was a strange enveloping comfort. And it was at this  moment that Shefford, divining"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5089"],[0,"Boris Godunov: a drama in verse (#9)"],[1," I scarce     Had shaped before the grave a silent prayer,     When sight illumed my eyeballs; I beheld     The light of God, my grandson, and the tomb.\"     That is the tale, Sire, which the old man told.       (General agitation. In the course of this speech Boris     several times wipes his face with his handkerchief.)       To Uglich then I sent, where it was learned     That many sufferers had found likewise     Deliverance at the grave of the tsarevich.     This is my counsel; to the Kremlin send     The sacred relics, place them in the Cathedral     Of the Archangel; clearly will the people     See then the godless villain's fraud; the might     Of the fiends will vanish as a cloud of dust.       (Silence.)       PRINCE SHUISKY. What mortal, holy father, knoweth the ways     Of the All-Highest? 'Tis not for me to judge Him.     Untainted sleep and power of wonder-working     He may upon the child's remains bestow;     But vulgar rumour must dispassionately     And diligently be tested; is it for us,     In stormy times of insurrection,     To weigh so great a matter? Will men not say     That insolently we made of sacred things     A worldly instrument? Even now the people     Sway senselessly this way and that, even now     There are enough already of loud rumours;     This is no time to vex the people's minds     With aught so unexpected, grave, and strange.     I myself see 'tis needful to demolish     The rumour spread abroad by the unfrocked monk;     But for this end other and simpler means     Will serve. Therefore, when it shall please thee, Sire,     I will myself appear in public places,     I will persuade, exhort away this madness,     And will expose the vagabond's vile fraud.       TSAR. So be it! My lord Patriarch, I pray thee     Go with us to the palace, where today     I must converse with thee.       (Exeunt; all the boyars follow them.)       1ST BOYAR. (Sotto voce to another.) Didst mark how pale     Our sovereign turned, how from his face there poured     A mighty sweat?       2ND BOYAR.    I durst not, I confess,     Uplift mine eyes, nor breathe, nor even stir.       1ST BOYAR. Prince Shuisky has pulled it through. A     splendid fellow!          A PLAIN NEAR NOVGOROD SEVERSK    (DECEMBER 21st, 1604)    A BATTLE       SOLDIERS. (Run in disorder.) Woe, woe! The Tsarevich!     The Poles! There they are! There they are!       (Captains enter: MARZHERET and WALTHER ROZEN.)       MARZHERET. Whither, whither? Allons! Go back!       ONE OF THE FUGITIVES. You go back, if you like, cursed     infidel.       MARZHERET. Quoi, quoi?       ANOTHER. Kva! kva! You like, you frog from over the     sea, to croak at the Russian tsarevich; but we--we are     orthodox.       MARZHERET. Qu'est-ce a dire \"orthodox\"? Sacres gueux,     maudite canaille! Mordieu, mein Herr, j'enrage; on     dirait que ca n'a pas de bras pour frapper, ca n'a que des     jambes pour fuir.       ROZEN. Es ist Schande.       MARZHERET. Ventre-saint gris! Je ne bouge plus d'un pas;     puisque le vin est tire, il faut le boire. Qu'en dites-vous,     mein Herr?       ROZEN. Sie haben Recht.       MARZHERET. Tudieu, il y fait chaud! Ce diable de \"Pretender,\"     comme ils l'appellent, est un bougre, qui a du     poil au col?--Qu'en pensez-vous, mein Herr?       ROZEN. Ja.       MARZHERET. He! Voyez donc, voyez donc! L'action s'engage     sur les derrieres de l'ennemi. Ce doit etre le brave     Basmanov, qui aurait fait une sortie.       ROZEN. Ich glaube das.       (Enter Germans.)       MARZHERET. Ha, ha! Voici nos allemands. Messieurs!     Mein Herr, dites-leur donc de se raillier et, sacrebleu,     chargeons!       ROZEN. Sehr gut. Halt! (The Germans halt.) Marsch!       THE GERMANS. (They march.) Hilf Gott!       (Fight. The Russians flee again.)       POLES. Victory! Victory! Glory to the tsar Dimitry!       DIMITRY. (On horseback.) Cease fighting. We have     conquered. Enough! Spare Russian blood. Cease     fighting.          OPEN SPACE IN FRONT OF THE CATHEDRAL IN MOSCOW    THE PEOPLE       ONE OF THE PEOPLE. Will the tsar soon come out of the     Cathedral?       ANOTHER. The mass is ended; now the Te Deum is going on.       THE FIRST. What! Have they already cursed him?       THE SECOND. I stood in the porch and heard how the deacon     cried out:--Grishka Otrepiev is anathema!       THE FIRST. Let him curse to his heart's content; the     tsarevich has nothing to do with the Otrepiev.       THE SECOND. But they are now singing mass for the repose     of the soul of the tsarevich.       THE FIRST. What? A mass for the dead sung for a living     Man? They'll suffer for it, the godless wretches!       A THIRD. Hist! A sound. Is it not the tsar?       A FOURTH. No, it is the idiot.       (An idiot enters, in an iron cap, hung round with     chains, surrounded by boys.)       THE BOYS. Nick, Nick, iron nightcap! T-r-r-r-r--       OLD WOMAN. Let him be, you young devils. Innocent one,     pray thou for me a sinner.       IDIOT. Give, give, give a penny.       OLD WOMAN. There is a penny for thee; remember me in     thy prayers.       IDIOT. (Seats himself on the ground and sings:)                      The moon sails on,                     The kitten cries,                     Nick, arise,                    Pray to God.       (The boys surround him again.)       ONE OF THEM. How do you do, Nick? Why don't you     take off your cap?       (Raps him on the iron cap.)       How it rings!       IDIOT. But I have got a penny.       BOYS. That's not true; now, show it.       (They snatch the penny and run away.)       IDIOT. (Weeps.) They have taken my penny, they are     hurting Nick.       THE PEOPLE. The tsar, the tsar is coming!       (The TSAR comes out from the Cathedral; a boyar in     front of him scatters alms among the poor. Boyars.)       IDIOT. Boris, Boris! The boys are hurting Nick.       TSAR. Give him alms! What is he crying for?       IDIOT. The boys are hurting me...Give orders to slay     them, as thou slewest the little tsarevich.       BOYARS. Go away, fool! Seize the fool!       TSAR. Leave him alone. Pray thou for me, Nick.       (Exit.)       IDIOT. (To himself.) No, no! It is impossible to pray for     tsar Herod; the Mother of God forbids it.          SYEVSK    The PRETENDER, surrounded by his supporters       PRETENDER. Where is the prisoner?       A POLE.                         Here.       PRETENDER. Call him before me.       (A Russian prisoner enters.)       Who art thou?       PRISONER.   Rozhnov, a nobleman of Moscow.       PRETENDER. Hast long been in the service?       PRISONER.                               About a month.       PRETENDER. Art not ashamed, Rozhnov, that thou hast drawn     The sword against me?       PRISONER.           What else could I do?     'Twas not our fault.       PRETENDER.         Didst fight beneath the walls     Of Seversk?       PRISONER. 'Twas two weeks after the battle     I came from Moscow.       PRETENDER.        What of Godunov?       PRISONER. The battle's loss, Mstislavsky's wound, hath caused him     Much apprehension; Shuisky he hath sent     To take command.       PRETENDER.     But why hath he recalled     Basmanov unto Moscow?       PRISONER.           The tsar rewarded     His services with honour and with gold.     Basmanov in the council of the tsar     Now sits.       PRETENDER. The army had more need of him.     Well, how go things in Moscow?       PRISONER.                    All is quiet,     Thank God.       PRETENDER. Say, do they look for me?       PRISONER.                          God knows;     They dare not talk too much there now. Of some     The tongues have been cut off, of others even     The heads. It is a fearsome state of things--     Each day an execution. All the prisons     Are crammed. Wherever two or three forgather     In public places, instantly a spy     Worms himself in; the tsar himself examines     At leisure the denouncers. It is just     Sheer misery; so silence is the best.       PRETENDER. An enviable life for the tsar's people!     Well, how about the army?       PRISONER.               What of them?     Clothed and full-fed they are content with all.       PRETENDER. But is there much of it?       PRISONER.                         God knows.       PRETENDER.                          All told     Will there be thirty thousand?       PRISONER.                    Yes; 'twill run     Even to fifty thousand.       (The Pretender reflects; those around him glance at     one another.)       PRETENDER.            Well! Of me     What say they in your camp?       PRISONER.                 Your graciousness     They speak of; say that thou, Sire, (be not wrath),     Art a thief, but a fine fellow.       PRETENDER. (Laughing.)        Even so     I'll prove myself to them in deed. My friends,     We will not wait for Shuisky; I wish you joy;     Tomorrow, battle.       (Exit.)       ALL.            Long life to Dimitry!       A POLE. Tomorrow, battle! They are fifty thousand,     And we scarce fifteen thousand. He is mad!       ANOTHER. That's nothing, friend. A single Pole can challenge     Five hundred Muscovites.       PRISONER.              Yes, thou mayst challenge!     But when it comes to fighting, then, thou braggart,     Thou'lt run away.       POLE.           If thou hadst had a sword,     Insolent prisoner, then (pointing to his sword) with this I'd soon     Have vanquished thee.       PRISONER.           A Russian can make shift     Without a sword; how like you this (shows his fist), you fool?       (The Pole looks at him haughtily and departs in     silence. All laugh.)          A FOREST    PRETENDER and PUSHKIN    (In the background lies a dying horse)       PRETENDER. Ah, my poor horse! How gallantly he charged     Today in the last battle, and when wounded,     How swiftly bore me. My poor horse!       PUSHKIN. (To himself.)            Well, here's     A great ado about a horse, when all     Our army's"]]]
