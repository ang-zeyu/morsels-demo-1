[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9799"],[0,"It Happened in Egypt (#9)"],[1," the bridge of the thin nose, then sloping steeply down toward  the temples; the slight working of muscles in the cheeks; the  peculiarly charming mouth which could be irresistible in a smile, the  stern, contradictory chin marring by its prominence the otherwise  perfect oval of the face. I wondered if Anthony had as noble a throat  as this collarless galabeah left uncovered, reminding myself that I  could not at all recall Anthony's throat. Then, as the sombre eyes  turned to me, drawn perhaps by my stare, I was stunned, flabbergasted,  what you will, by realizing that Anthony himself was looking at me from  under the green turban.    The dark face was blankly expressionless. He might have been gazing  through my head. His eyes neither twinkled with fun nor sent a message  of warning; but somehow I knew that he saw me, that he had been  watching me for a long time. \"You see the one I mean, don't you?\" asked  Monny. \"Well, that's the one I want. I'll take _him_.\"    She spoke as if she were selecting a horse at a horse show.    Anthony had brought this on himself, but I was not angry with Anthony.  I was angry with the girl for putting her finger into our pie.    \"That's not a dragoman,\" I assured her. \"If he were, he'd come and bawl  out his accomplishments, as the others do. He's a very different sort  of chap.\"    \"That's why I want him,\" said Monny. \"And if he isn't a dragoman, he'll  jump at being one if I offer to pay him enough. He's an Egyptian,  anyhow, by his clothes, or a Bedouin or something--although he isn't as  dark as the rest of these men. I suppose he must know a little about  his own city and country.\"    \"It doesn't follow he'd tell travellers about them for money,\" said I.  \"He looks to me a man of good birth and distinction in old fashioned  dress. Why he's lingering on the pavement in front of this hotel I  can't explain, but I'm certain he isn't touting. Probably he's waiting  for a friend.\"    \"He's the best looking Arab we've seen yet,\" remarked Mrs. East. \"Like  my idea of an Egyptian gentleman.\"    \"Pooh!\" said Monny. \"Just test him, Lord Ernest.\"    \"Sorry, but I can't do it,\" I answered, with a firmness which ought to  have been tried on her long ago. \"And I wouldn't discuss him in such a  loud tone of voice. He may understand English.\"    \"We have to yell to hear ourselves speak over all this row,\" Biddy  apologized for her darling; but she need not have troubled herself.  Miss Gilder had been deaf to my implied reproach.    \"I'm glad I'm an American girl,\" she said. \"When I want things I want  them so dreadfully I just go for them, and surprise them so much that I  get them before they know where they are. Now I'm going for this  dragoman.\"    \"He's not a drag--\" I persisted, but she cut me short.    \"I bet you my hat he will be one! What will you bet that he won't, Lord  Ernest?\"    \"I'll bet you his green turban,\" said I.    \"How can you get it?\"    \"As easily as you can get him,\" I retorted. \"It's a safe bet.\"    Monny looked excited, but firm. Luckily, as she does it so often, it's  becoming to her to look firm. (I have noticed that it's not becoming to  most girls. It squares their jaws and makes their eyes snap.) But the  spoiled daughter of the dead Cannon King at her worst, merely looks  pathetically earnest and Minerva-like. This, I suppose, is one of the  \"little ways\" she has acquired, since she gave up kicking and screaming  people into submission. As Biddy says, the girl can be charming not  only when she wants to be, but quite often when she doesn't.    The man with the green turban was no longer engaged in hypnotizing. He  had retired within himself, and appeared oblivious to the outer world.  Yet nobody jostled the tall, straight figure which stood with folded  arms, lightly leaning against a tree. The colour of his turban was  sacred in the eyes of the crowd; and when Miss Gilder, leaning over the  terrace railing beckoned him, surprise rather than jealousy showed on  the faces of the unwanted dragomans. As for the wearer of the turban,  he did what I expected and wished him to do: paid not the slightest  attention to the gesture. Whatever the motive for his masquerade, it  was not to attract anything feminine.    I smiled sardonically. \"That's a nice hat you've got on, Miss Gilder,\"  I remarked.    \"Do you collect girls' hats?\" she asked sweetly. \"But mine isn't  eligible yet for your collection. Let me see, what did you say he was?  Oh, a Hadji!\" And she shrilled forth sweetly, her voice sounding young  and clear, \"Hadji! Hadji! Effendi! Venez ici, s'il vous plait. Please  come here.\"    I could have been knocked flat by a blow of the smallest, cheapest  ostrich feather in the hands of any street-merchant. For he came.  Anthony came! Not to look meekly up from the pavement below the  railing, but to ascend the steps of the terrace, and advance with grave  dignity toward our table. Within a yard of us he stopped, giving to me,  not to Miss Gilder, the beautiful Arab salute, a touch on forehead and  heart.    \"You devil!\" I was saying to myself. \"So you walk into this trap, do  you, and calmly trust me to get you out. Serve you right if I don't  move hand or foot.\" And I almost made up my mind that I wouldn't. But I  was interested. I wanted intensely to know what the dickens Anthony was  up to, and whether he would have been up to it if he'd known the sort  of young woman he had to deal with.    \"It was I who called to you, not this gentleman,\" said Monny, when she  found that Green Turban did not look at her. \"Do you speak French or  English a little?\"    \"A little of both. But I choose French when talking to Americans,\"  replied Anthony Fenton, with astounding impertinence, in the preferred  language. \"I do not know you, Madame. But I do know this gentleman.\"    Good heavens! What next? He acknowledged me! What was I to do now? What  did the impudent fellow want me to do? Evidently he was trying an  experiment. Anthony is great on experiments, and always has been. But  this was a bomb. I thought he wanted to see if I could catch it on the  fly, and drop it into water before it had time to explode.    \"Why didn't you tell us, Lord Ernest?\" asked Monny, with a flash in her  gray eyes. \"I thought you hadn't been in Egypt since you were a child.\"    \"I haven't, and I didn't recognize him at first,\" I answered, trying  for the coolness which Anthony dared to count upon.    \"You remember me now?\" he inquired politely.    \"I--er--yes,\" I replied, also in French. \"Your face is familiar, though  you've changed, I think, since--er--since you were in England. It must  have been there--yes, of course. You were on a diplomatic mission. But  your name--\"    \"You may have known me as Ahmed Antoun,\" said the wretch, not dreaming  of that slip he had made.    Cleopatra, who has little French, nevertheless started, and fixed upon  the face under the turban a stare of feverish interest. Brigit and the  unobtrusive lady with the slanting eyes both showed such symptoms of  surprise as must too late have warned Fenton that he had missed his  footing, skating on thin ice.    \"Antoun!\" exclaimed Mrs. East. \"Why, that's what you said you called  your friend Captain Fenton.\"    I glanced at Anthony. His profile had no more expression than that of  an Indian on an American penny, and, indeed, rather resembled it. If he  were blaming me for letting anything out, I had a right to blame him  for letting himself in. He was silent as well as expressionless. He  left it all to me--diplomat or duffer.    \"'Antoun Effendi' was the nickname my friend Fenton got at school,\" I  explained to Cleopatra, \"because it sounded a bit like his own name,  and because he had--er--because he had associations with Egypt. He was  proud of them and is still. But Antoun is a name often heard here. And  every man who isn't a Bey or a Prince, or a Sheikh, is an Effendi. I  quite remember you now,\" I hurried on, turning to Anthony once more.  \"You are Hadji as well as Effendi.\"    \"I have the right to call myself so, if I choose,\" he admitted. \"I am  pleased to meet you again. I was waiting for a friend when you  beckoned. If you did not recognize my face at first, may I ask what it  was you wanted of me?\"    There was no limit, then, to his audacity. He had not learned his  lesson yet, after all, it would seem.    Monny could not bear tamely to lose her hat, though she must have felt  her hatpins trembling in the balance. \"I told you before,\" she  repeated, \"that it was I who beckoned you.\" He looked at her, without  speaking; and somehow the green turban and the long straight gown, by  adding to his dignity, added also to his remote air of cold politeness.  How could she go on? Had she the cheek to go on? She had; but the cheek  was flushed with embarrassment.    \"I--er--I am anxious for a guide, some one who knows Egypt well, and  several languages,\" she desperately blurted out, looking like a  half-frightened, half-defiant child. \"I thought----\"    \"There are plenty of dragomans, Madame,\" Green Turban reminded her. \"I  can recommend you several.\"    \"I don't want a regular dragoman,\" she said. \"And I'm not 'Madame.' I  am Miss Gilder.\"    \"Indeed?\" Chilling indifference in the tone. (Monny's hat was  practically mine. I thought I should rather value it.)    \"Yes. But of course that can't matter to you.\"    \"No. It cannot, Mademoiselle.\"    \"What I want to say, is this. You're a Hadji, which means you've been  to Mecca; Lord Ernest Borrow's just told us. So you must be very  intelligent. Are you in business?\"    \"I am interested in excavations.\"    \"Oh! And are you allowed to make them yourself?\"    \"Not always.\"    I glanced at him quickly, wondering if he meant that answer more for me  than for the girl. But his face told nothing.    \"Would you be able to, if you were rich enough?\"    \"It is possible.\" \"Well, I'd be willing to give you a big salary for  showing us about Cairo, and perhaps going up the Nile."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9806"],[0,"Mr. Justice Raffles (#9)"],[1," still be too late for him to play.\"    \"Then it's too late already,\" said Mr. Garland, sinking back into his  chair with a groan.    \"But that note from Studley may have been half-an-hour on the way.\"    \"No, Raffles, it's not an ordinary note; it's a message telephoned  straight from Lord's--probably within the last few minutes--to a  messenger office not a hundred yards from this door!\"    Mr. Garland sat staring miserably at the carpet; he was beginning to look  ill with perplexity and suspense. Raffles himself, who had turned his  back upon us with a shrug of acquiescence in the inevitable, was a  monument of discomfiture as he stood gazing through a glass door into the  adjoining conservatory. There was no actual window in the library, but  this door was a single sheet of plate-glass into which a man might well  have walked, and I can still see Raffles in full-length silhouette upon a  panel of palms and tree-ferns. I see the silhouette grow tall and  straight again before my eyes, the door open, and Raffles listening with  an alert lift of the head. I, too, hear something, an elfin hiss, a fairy  fusillade, and then the sudden laugh with which Raffles rejoined us in  the body of the room.    \"It's raining!\" he cried, waving a hand above his head. \"Have you a  barometer, Mr. Garland?\"    \"That's an aneroid under the lamp-bracket.\"    \"How often do you set the indicator?\"    \"Last thing every night. I remember it was between Fair and Change when I  went to bed. It made me anxious.\"    \"It may make you thankful now. It's between Change and Rain this  morning. And the rain's begun, and while there's rain there's hope!\"    In a twinkling Raffles had regained all his own irresistible buoyancy and  assurance. But the older man was not capable of so prompt a recovery.    \"Something has happened to my boy!\"    \"But not necessarily anything terrible.\"    \"If I knew what, Raffles--if only I knew what!\"    Raffles eyed the pale and twitching face with sidelong solicitude. He  himself had the confident expression which always gave me confidence; the  rattle on the conservatory roof was growing louder every minute.    \"I intend to find out,\" said he; \"and if the rain goes on long enough,  we may still see Teddy playing when it stops. But I shall want your  help, sir.\"    \"I am ready to go with you anywhere, Raffles.\"    \"You can only help me, Mr. Garland, by staying where you are.\"    \"Where I am?\"    \"In the house all day,\" said Raffles firmly. \"It is absolutely essential  to my idea.\"    \"And that is, Raffles?\"    \"To save Teddy's face, in the first instance. I shall drive straight up  to Lord's, in your brougham if I may. I know Studley rather well; he  shall keep Teddy's place open till the last possible moment.\"    \"But how shall you account for his absence?\" I asked.    \"I shall account for it all right,\" said Raffles darkly. \"I can save his  face for the time being, at all events at Lord's.\"    \"But that's the only place that matters,\" said I.    \"On the contrary, Bunny, this very house matters even more as long as  Miss Belsize is here. You forget that they're engaged, and that she's in  the next room now.\"    \"Good God!\" whispered Mr. Garland. \"I had forgotten that myself.\"    \"She is the last who must know of this affair,\" said Raffles, with, I  thought, undue authority. \"And you are the only one who can keep it from  her, sir.\"    \"I?\"    \"Miss Belsize mustn't go up to Lord's this morning. She would only spoil  her things, and you may tell her from me that there would be no play for  an hour after this, even if it stopped this minute, which it won't.  Meanwhile let her think that Teddy's weatherbound with the rest of them  in the pavilion; but she mustn't come until you hear from me again; and  the best way to keep her here is to stay with her yourself.\"    \"And when may I expect to hear?\" asked Mr. Garland as Raffles held  out his hand.    \"Let me see. I shall be at Lord's in less than twenty minutes; another  five or ten should polish off Studley; and then I shall barricade myself  in the telephone-box and ring up every hospital in town! You see, it may  be an accident after all, though I don't think so. You won't hear from  me on the point unless it is; the fewer messengers flying about the  better, if you agree with me as to the wisdom of keeping the matter dark  at this end.\"    \"Oh, yes, I agree with you, Raffles; but it will be a terribly hard  task for me!\"    \"It will, indeed, Mr. Garland. Yet no news is always good news, and I  promise to come straight to you the moment I have news of any kind.\"    With that they shook hands, our host with an obvious reluctance that  turned to a less understandable dismay as I also prepared to take my  leave of him.    \"What!\" cried he, \"am I to be left quite alone to hoodwink that poor girl  and hide my own anxiety?\"    \"There's no reason why you should come, Bunny,\" said Raffles to me. \"If  either of them is a one-man job, it's mine.\"    Our host said no more, but he looked at me so wistfully that I could not  but offer to stay with him if he wished it; and when at length the  drawing-room door had closed upon him and his son's _fiancee_, I took an  umbrella from the stand and saw Raffles through the providential downpour  into the brougham.    \"I'm sorry, Bunny,\" he muttered between the butler in the porch and the  coachman on the box. \"This sort of thing is neither in my line nor yours,  but it serves us right for straying from the path of candid crime. We  should have opened a safe for that seven hundred.\"    \"But what do you really think is at the bottom of this extraordinary  disappearance?\"    \"Some madness or other, I'm afraid; but if that boy is still in the land  of the living, I shall have him before the sun goes down on his  insanity.\"    \"And what about this engagement of his?\" I pursued. \"Do you  disapprove of it?\"    \"Why on earth should I?\" asked Raffles, rather sharply, as he plunged  from under my umbrella into the brougham.    \"Because you never told me when he told you,\" I replied. \"Is the girl  beneath him?\"    Raffles looked at me inscrutably with his clear blue eyes.    \"You'd better find out for yourself,\" said he. \"Tell the coachman to  hurry up to Lord's--and pray that this rain may last!\"          CHAPTER VI    Camilla Belsize      It would be hard to find a better refuge on a rainy day than the  amphibious retreat described by Raffles as a \"country house in  Kensington.\" There was a good square hall, full of the club comforts so  welcome in a home, such as magazines and cigarettes, and a fire when the  rain set in. The usual rooms opened off the hall, and the library was not  the only one that led on into the conservatory; the drawing-room was  another, in which I heard voices as I lit a cigarette among the palms and  tree-ferns. It struck me that poor Mr. Garland was finding it hard work  to propitiate the lady whom Raffles had deemed unworthy of mention  overnight. But I own I was in no hurry to take over the invidious task.  To me it need prove nothing more; to him, anguish; but I could not help  feeling that even as matters stood I was quite sufficiently embroiled in  these people's affairs. Their name had been little more than a name to me  until the last few hours. Only yesterday I might have hesitated to nod to  Teddy Garland at the club, so seldom had we met. Yet here was I helping  Raffles to keep the worst about the son from the father's knowledge, and  on the point of helping that father to keep what might easily prove worse  still from his daughter-in-law to be. And all the time there was the  worst of all to be hidden from everybody concerning Raffles and me!    Meanwhile I explored a system of flower-houses and vineries that ran out  from the conservatory in a continuous chain--each link with its own  temperature and its individual scent--and not a pane but rattled and  streamed beneath the timely torrent. It was in a fernery where a playing  fountain added its tuneful drop to the noisy deluge that the voices of  the drawing-room sounded suddenly at my elbow, and I was introduced to  Miss Belsize before I could recover from my surprise. My foolish face  must have made her smile in spite of herself, for I did not see quite the  same smile again all day; but it made me her admirer on the spot, and I  really think she warmed to me for amusing her even for a moment.    So we began rather well; and that was a mercy in the light of poor Mr.  Garland's cynically prompt departure; but we did not go on quite as well  as we had begun. I do not say that Miss Belsize was in a bad temper, but  emphatically she was not pleased, and I for one had the utmost sympathy  with her displeasure. She was simply but exquisitely dressed, with  unostentatious touches of Cambridge blue and a picture hat that really  was a picture. Yet on a perfect stranger in a humid rockery she was  wasting what had been meant for mankind at Lord's. The only consolation I  could suggest was that by this time Lord's would be more humid still.    \"And so there's something to be said for being bored to tears under  shelter, Miss Belsize.\" Miss Belsize did not deny that she was bored.    \"But there's plenty of shelter there,\" said she.    \"Packed with draggled dresses and squelching shoes! You might swim for it  before they admitted you to that Pavilion, you know.\"    \"But if the ground's under water, how can they play to-day?\"    \"They can't, Miss Belsize, I don't mind betting.\"    That was a rash remark.    \"Then why doesn't Teddy come back?\"    \"Oh, well, you know,\" I hedged, \"you can never be quite absolutely sure.  It might clear up. They're bound to give it a chance until the afternoon.  And the players can't leave till stumps are drawn.\"    \"I should have thought Teddy could have come home to lunch,\" said Miss  Belsize, \"even if he had to go back afterwards.\"    \"I shouldn't wonder if he did come,\" said I, conceiving the bare  possibility: \"and A.J. with him."]]]
