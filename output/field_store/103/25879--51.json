Hermann!    HERMANN. At your service, gracious sir!    FRANCIS (shakes him by the hand). You will not find it that of an  ungrateful master.    HERMANN. I have proofs of this.    FRANCIS. And you shall have more soon--very soon, Hermann!--I have  something to say to thee, Hermann.    HERMANN. I am all attention.    FRANCIS. I know thee--thou art a resolute fellow--a man of mettle.--To  call thee smooth-tongued! My father has greatly belied thee, Hermann.    HERMANN. The devil take me if I forget it!    FRANCIS. Spoken like a man! Vengeance becomes a manly heart! Thou art  to my mind, Hermann. Take this purse, Hermann. It should be heavier  were I master here.    HERMANN. That is my unceasing wish, most gracious sir. I thank you.    FRANCIS. Really, Hermann! dost thou wish that I were master? But my  father has the marrow of a lion in his bones, and I am but a younger  son.    HERMANN. I wish you were the eldest son, and that your father were as  marrowless as a girl sinking in a consumption.    FRANCIS. Ha! how that elder son would recompense thee! How he would  raise thee from this grovelling condition, so ill suited to thy spirit  and noble birth, to be a light of the age!--Then shouldst thou be  covered with gold from head to foot, and dash through the streets four  in hand--verily thou shouldst!--But I am losing sight of what I meant to  say.--Have you already forgotten the Lady Amelia, Hermann?    HERMANN. A curse upon it! Why do you remind me of her?    FRANCIS. My brother has filched her away from you.    HERMANN. He shall rue it.    FRANCIS. She gave you the sack. And, if I remember right, he kicked  you down stairs.    HERMANN. For which I will kick him into hell.    FRANCIS. He used to say, it was whispered abroad, that your father  could never look upon you without smiting his breast and sighing,  \"God be merciful to me, a sinner!\"    HERMANN (wildly). Thunder and lightning! No more of this!    FRANCIS. He advised you to sell your patent of nobility by auction, and  to get your stockings mended with the proceeds.    HERMANN. By all the devils in hell, I'll scratch out his eyes with my  own nails!    FRANCIS. What? you are growing angry? What signifies your anger? What  harm can you do him? What can a mouse like you do to such a lion? Your  rage only makes his triumph the sweeter. You can do nothing more than  gnash your teeth, and vent your rage upon a dry crust.    HERMANN (stamping). I will grind him to powder!    FRANCIS (slapping his shoulder). Fie, Hermann! You are a gentleman.  You must not put up with the affront. You must not give up the lady,  no, not for all the world, Hermann! By my soul, I would move heaven and  earth were I in your place.    HERMANN. I will not rest till I have him, and him, too, under ground.    FRANCIS. Not so violent, Hermann! Come nearer--you shall have Amelia.    HERMANN. That I must; despite the devil himself, I will have her.    FRANCIS. You shall have her, I tell you; and that from my hand. Come  closer, I say.--You don't know, perhaps, that Charles is as good as  disinherited.    HERMANN (going closer to him). Incredible! The first I have heard of  it.    FRANCIS. Be patient, and listen! Another time you shall hear more.--  Yes, I tell you, as good as banished these eleven months. But the old  man already begins to lament the hasty step, which, however, I flatter  myself (with a smile) is not entirely his own. Amelia, too, is  incessantly pursuing him with her tears and reproaches. Presently he  will be having him searched for in every quarter of the world; and if he  finds him--then it's all over with you, Hermann. You may perhaps have  the honor of most obsequiously holding the coach-door while he alights  with the lady to get married.    HERMANN. I'll strangle him at the altar first.    FRANCIS. His father will soon give up his estates to him, and live in  retirement in his castle. Then the proud roysterer will have the reins  in his own hands, and laugh his enemies to scorn;--and I, who wished to  make a great man of you--a man of consequence--I myself, Hermann, shall  have to make my humble obeisance at his threshold.    HERMANN (with fire). No, as sure as my name is Hermann, that shall  never be! If but the smallest spark of wit glimmer in this brain of  mine, that shall never be!    FRANCIS. Will you be able to prevent it? You, too, my good Hermann,  will be made to feel his lash. He will spit in your face when he meets  you in the streets; and woe be to you should you venture to shrug your  shoulders or to make a wry mouth. Look, my friend! this is all that  your lovesuit, your prospects, and your mighty plans amount to.    HERMANN. Tell me, what am I to do?    FRANCIS. Well, then, listen, Hermann! You see how I enter into your  feelings, like a true friend. Go--disguise yourself, so that no one may  recognize you; obtain audience of the old man; pretend to come straight  from Bohemia, to have been at the battle of Prague along with my  brother--to have seen him breathe his last on the field of battle!    HERMANN. Will he believe me?    FRANCIS. Ho! ho! let that be my care! Take this packet. There you  will find your commission set forth at large; and documents, to boot,  which shall convince the most incredulous. Only make haste to get away  unobserved. Slip through the back gate into the yard, and then scale  the garden wall.--The denouement of this tragicomedy you may leave to  me!    HERMANN. That, I suppose, will be, \"Long live our new baron, Francis  von Moor!\"    FRANCIS (patting his cheeks). How cunning you are! By this means, you  see, we attain all our aims at once and quickly. Amelia relinquishes  all hope of him,--the old man reproaches himself for the death of his  son, and--he sickens--a tottering edifice needs no earthquake to bring  it down--he will not survive the intelligence--then am I his only son,  --Amelia loses every support, and becomes the plaything of my will, and  you may easily guess--in short, all will go as we wish--but you must not  flinch from your word.    HERMANN. What do you say? (Exultingly.) Sooner shall the ball turn  back in its course, and bury itself in the entrails of the marksman.  Depend upon me! Only let me to the work. Adieu!    FRANCIS (calling after him). The harvest is thine, dear Hermann!  (Alone.) When the ox has drawn the corn into the barn, he must put up  with hay. A dairy maid for thee, and no Amelia!                    SCENE II.--Old Moor's Bedchamber.             OLD MOOR asleep in an arm-chair; AMELIA.      AMELIA (approaching him on tip-toe). Softly! Softly! He slumbers.  (She places herself before him.) How beautiful! how venerable!--  venerable as the picture of a saint. No, I cannot be angry with thee,  thou head with the silver locks; I cannot be angry with thee! Slumber  on gently, wake up cheerfully--I alone will be the sufferer.    OLD M. (dreaming). My son! my son! my son!    AMELIA (seizes his hand). Hark!--hark! his son is in his dreams.    OLD M. Are you there? Are you really there! Alas! how miserable you  seem! Fix not on me that mournful look! I am wretched enough.    AMELIA (awakens him abruptly). Look up, dear old man! 'Twas but a  dream. Collect yourself!    OLD M. (half awake). Was he not there? Did I not press his hands?  Cruel Francis! wilt thou tear him even from my dreams?    AMELIA (aside). Ha! mark that, Amelia!    OLD M. (rousing himself). Where is he? Where? Where am I? You here,  Amelia?    AMELIA. How do you find yourself? You have had a refreshing slumber.    OLD M. I was dreaming about my son. Why did I not dream on? Perhaps I  might have obtained forgiveness from his lips.    AMELIA. Angels bear no resentment--he forgives you. (Seizes his hand  sorrowfully.) Father of my Charles! I, too, forgive you.    OLD M. No, no, my child! That death-like paleness of thy cheek is the  father's condemnation. Poor girl! I have robbed thee of the happiness  of thy youth. Oh, do not curse me!    AMELIA (affectionately kissing his hand). I curse you?    OLD M. Dost thou know this portrait, my daughter?    AMELIA. Charles!    OLD M. Such was he in his sixteenth year. But now, alas! how changed.  Oh, it is raging within me. That gentleness is now indignation; that  smile despair. It was his birthday, was it not, Amelia--in the  jessamine bower--when you drew this picture of him? Oh, my daughter!  How happy was I in your loves.    AMELIA (with her eye still riveted upon the picture). No, no, it is not  he! By Heaven, that is not Charles! Here (pointing to her head and her  heart), here he is perfect; and how different. The feeble pencil avails  not to express that heavenly spirit which reigned in his fiery eye.  Away with it! This is a poor image, an ordinary man! I was a mere  dauber.    OLD M. That kind, that cheering look! Had that been at my bedside,  I should have lived in the midst of death. Never, never should I have  died!    AMELIA. No, you would never, never have died. It would have been but a  leap, as we leap from one thought to another and a better. That look  would have lighted you across the tomb--that look would have lifted you  beyond the stars!    OLD M. It is hard! it is sad! I am dying, and my son Charles is not  here--I am borne to my tomb, and he weeps not over my grave. How sweet  it is to be lulled into the sleep of death by a son's prayer--that is  the true requiem.    AMELIA (with enthusiasm). Yes, sweet it is, heavenly sweet, to be  lulled into the sleep of death by the song of the beloved. Perhaps our  dreams continue in the grave--a long, eternal, never-ending dream of  Charles--till the trumpet of resurrection sounds--(rising in ecstasy)  --and thenceforth and forever in his arms! (A pause; she goes to the  piano and plays.)                    ANDROMACHE.

Yet, while by night we hold our Diet here,  The morning, see, has on the mountain-tops  Kindled her glowing beacon. Let us part,  Ere the broad sun surprise us.    FURST.                  Do not fear.  The night wanes slowly from these vales of ours.       [All have involuntarily taken off their caps, and     contemplate the breaking of day, absorbed in silence.    ROSSELMANN.  By this fair light, which greeteth us, before  Those other nations, that, beneath us far,  In noisome cities pent, draw painful breath,  Swear we the oath of our confederacy!  We swear to be a nation of true brothers,  Never to part in danger or in death!       [They repeat his words with three fingers raised.    We swear we will be free, as were our sires,  And sooner die than live in slavery!       [All repeat as before.

Now every man pursue his several way  Back to his friends his kindred, and his home.  Let the herd winter up his flock and gain  In silence, friends, for our confederacy!  What for a time must be endured, endure.  And let the reckoning of the tyrants grow,  Till the great day arrive, when they shall pay  The general and particular debt at once.  Let every man control his own just rage,  And nurse his vengeance for the public wrongs;  For he whom selfish interest now engage  Defrauds the general weal of what to it belongs.       [As they are going off in profound silence, in three different     directions, the orchestra plays a solemn air. The empty scene     remains open for some time, showing the rays of the sun rising     over the glaciers.          ACT III.    SCENE I.       Court before TELL'S house. TELL with an axe. HEDWIG engaged     in her domestic duties. WALTER and WILHELM in the background     playing with a little cross-bow.    WALTER (sings).       With his cross-bow and his quiver      The huntsman speeds his way,     Over mountain, dale, and river      At the dawning of the day.       As the eagle, on wild pinion,      Is the king in realms of air;     So the hunter claims dominion      Over crag and forest lair.       Far as ever bow can carry      Through the trackless, airy space,     All he sees he makes his quarry,      Soaring bird and beast of chase.    WILHELM (runs forward).  My string has snapped! Wilt mend it for me, father?    TELL.  Not I; a true-born archer helps himself.                       [Boys retire.    HEDWIG.  The boys begin to use the bow betimes.    TELL.  'Tis early practice only makes the master.    HEDWIG.  Ah! Would to heaven they never learnt the art!    TELL.  But they shall learn it, wife, in all its points.  Whoe'er would carve an independent way  Through life must learn to ward or plant a blow.    HEDWIG.  Alas, alas! and they will never rest  Contentedly at home.    TELL.             No more can I!  I was not framed by nature for a shepherd.  Restless I must pursue a changing course;  I only feel the flush and joy of life  In starting some fresh quarry every day.    HEDWIG.  Heedless the while of all your wife's alarms  As she sits watching through long hours at home.  For my soul sinks with terror at the tales  The servants tell about your wild adventures.  Whene'er we part my trembling heart forebodes  That you will ne'er come back to me again.  I see you on the frozen mountain steeps,  Missing, perchance, your leap from cliff to cliff;  I see the chamois, with a wild rebound,  Drag you down with him o'er the precipice.  I see the avalanche close o'er your head,  The treacherous ice give way, and you sink down  Entombed alive within its hideous gulf.  Ah! in a hundred varying forms does death  Pursue the Alpine huntsman on his course.  That way of life can surely ne'er be blessed,  Where life and limb are perilled every hour.    TELL.  The man that bears a quick and steady eye,  And trusts to God and his own lusty sinews,  Passes, with scarce a scar, through every danger.  The mountain cannot awe the mountain child.       [Having finished his work, he lays aside his tools.    And now, methinks, the door will hold awhile.  The axe at home oft saves the carpenter.    HEDWIG.  Whither away!       [Takes his cap.    TELL.  To Altdorf, to your father.    HEDWIG.  You have some dangerous enterprise in view? Confess!    TELL.  Why think you so?    HEDWIG.            Some scheme's on foot,  Against the governors. There was a Diet  Held on the Rootli--that I know--and you  Are one of the confederacy I'm sure.    TELL.  I was not there. Yet will I not hold back  Whene'er my country calls me to her aid.    HEDWIG.  Wherever danger is, will you be placed.  On you, as ever, will the burden fall.    TELL.  Each man shall have the post that fits his powers.    HEDWIG.  You took--ay, 'mid the thickest of the storm--  The man of Unterwald across the lake.  'Tis a marvel you escaped. Had you no thought  Of wife and children then?    TELL.                Dear wife, I had;  And therefore saved the father for his children.    HEDWIG.  To brave the lake in all its wrath; 'Twas not  To put your trust in God! 'Twas tempting him.    TELL.  The man that's over-cautious will do little.    HEDWIG.  Yes, you've a kind and helping hand for all;  But be in straits and who will lend you aid?    TELL.  God grant I ne'er may stand in need of it!       [Takes up his crossbow and arrows.    HEDWIG.  Why take your crossbow with you? Leave it here.    TELL.  I want my right hand when I want my bow.       [The boys return.    WALTER.  Where, father, are you going?    TELL.                  To grand-dad, boy--  To Altdorf. Will you go?    WALTER.                Ay, that I will!    HEDWIG.  The viceroy's there just now. Go not to Altdorf.    TELL.  He leaves to-day.    HEDWIG.            Then let him first be gone,  Cross not his path. You know he bears us grudge.    TELL.  His ill-will cannot greatly injure me.  I do what's right, and care for no man's hate.    HEDWIG.  'Tis those who do what's right whom he most hates.    TELL.  Because he cannot reach them. Me, I ween,  His knightship will be glad to leave in peace.    HEDWIG.  Ay! Are you sure of that?    TELL.                Not long ago,  As I was hunting through the wild ravines  Of Shechenthal, untrod by mortal foot,--  There, as I took my solitary way  Along a shelving ledge of rocks, where 'twas  Impossible to step on either side;  For high above rose, like a giant wall,  The precipice's side, and far below  The Shechen thundered o'er its rifted bed;--       [The boys press towards him, looking upon him     with excited curiosity.    There, face to face, I met the viceroy. He  Alone with me--and I myself alone--  Mere man to man, and near us the abyss.  And when his lordship had perused my face,  And knew the man he had severely fined  On some most trivial ground not long before;  And saw me, with my sturdy bow in hand,  Come striding towards him, then his cheek grew pale,  His knees refused their office, and I thought  He would have sunk against the mountain side.  Then, touched with pity for him, I advanced,  Respectfully, and said, \"'Tis I, my lord.\"  But ne'er a sound could he compel his lips  To frame an answer. Only with his hand  He beckoned me in silence to proceed.  So I passed on, and sent his train to seek him.    HEDWIG.  He trembled then before you? Woe the while  You saw his weakness; that he'll not forgive.    TELL.  I shun him, therefore, and he'll not seek me.    HEDWIG.  But stay away to day. Go hunting rather!    TELL.  What do you fear?    HEDWIG.            I am uneasy. Stay.    TELL.  Why thus distress yourself without a cause?    HEDWIG.  Because there is no cause. Tell, Tell! stay here!    TELL.  Dear wife, I gave my promise I would go.    HEDWIG.  Must you,--then go. But leave the boys with me.    WALTER.  No, mother dear, I'm going with my father.    HEDWIG.  How, Walter! Will you leave your mother then?    WALTER.  I'll bring you pretty things from grandpapa.       [Exit with his father.    WILHELM.  Mother, I'll stay with you!    HEDWIG (embracing him).                 Yes, yes! thou art  My own dear child. Thou'rt all that's left to me.       [She goes to the gate of the court, and looks anxiously     after TELL and her son for a considerable time.        SCENE II.       A retired part of the Forest. Brooks dashing in spray     over the rocks.       Enter BERTHA in a hunting dress. Immediately afterwards RUDENZ.    BERTHA.  He follows me. Now to explain myself!    RUDENZ (entering hastily).  At length, dear lady, we have met alone  In this wild dell, with rocks on every side,  No jealous eye can watch our interview.  Now let my heart throw off this weary silence.    BERTHA.  But are you sure they will not follow us?    RUDENZ.  See, yonder goes the chase. Now, then, or never!  I must avail me of the precious moment,--  Must hear my doom decided by thy lips,  Though it should part me from thy side forever.  Oh, do not arm that gentle face of thine  With looks so stern and harsh! Who--who am I,  That dare aspire so high as unto thee?  Fame hath not stamped me yet; nor may I take  My place amid the courtly throng of knights,  That, crowned with glory's lustre, woo thy smiles.  Nothing have I to offer but a heart  That overflows with truth and love for thee.    BERTHA (sternly and with severity).  And dare you speak to me of love--of truth?  You, that are faithless to your nearest ties!  You, that are Austria's slave--bartered and sold  To her--an alien, and your country's tyrant!    RUDENZ.  How! This reproach from thee! Whom do I seek  On Austria's side, my own beloved, but thee?    BERTHA.  Think you to find me in the traitor's ranks?  Now, as I live, I'd rather give my hand  To"]]]
