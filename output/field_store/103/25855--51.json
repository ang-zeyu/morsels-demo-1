The fact is,  the nearer you hide the safer you be.\"    \"Exactly,\" sais I; \"what you seek you can't find, but when you ain't  looking for a thing, you are sure to stumble on it.\"    \"If you ever want to run goods, Sir,\" said he, \"the closer you go to  the port the better. Smugglers ain't all up to this, so they seldom  approach the lion's den, but go farther and fare worse. Now we may  learn lessons from dumb animals. They know we reason on probabilities,  and therefore always do what is improbable. \"We think them to be  fools, but they know that we are. The fox sees we always look for him  about his hole, and therefore he carries on his trade as far from it,  and as near the poultry yard, as possible. If a dog kills sheep, and  them Newfoundlanders are most uncommon fond of mutton, I must say, he  never attacks his neighbour's flock, for he knows he would be  suspected and had up for it, but sets off at night, and makes a foray  like the old Scotch on the distant borders.    \"He washes himself, for marks of blood is a bad sign, and returns  afore day, and wags his tail, and runs round his master, and looks up  into his face as innocent as you please, as much as to say, 'Squire,  here I have been watchin' of your property all this live-long night,  it's dreadful lonely work, I do assure you, and oh, how glad I am to  see the shine of your face this morning.'    \"And the old boss pats his head, fairly took in, and says, 'That's a  good dog, what a faithful honest fellow you be, you are worth your  weight in gold.'    \"Well, the next time he goes off on a spree in the same quarter, what  does he see but a border dog strung up by the neck, who has been  seized and condemned as many an innocent fellow has been before him on  circumstantial evidence, and he laughs and says to himself, 'What  fools humans be, they don't know half as much as we dogs do.' So he  thinks it would be as well to shift his ground, where folks ain't on  the watch for sheep-stealers, and he makes a dash into a flock still  farther off.    \"Them Newfoundlanders would puzzle the London detective police, I  believe they are the most knowin' coons in all creation, don't you?\"    \"Well, they are,\" sais I, \"that's a fact, and they have all the same  passions and feelings we have, only they are more grateful than man  is, and you can by kindness lay one of them under an obligation he  will never forget as long as he lives, whereas an obligation scares a  man, for he snorts and stares at you like a horse at an engine, and is  e'en most sure to up heels and let you have it, like mad. The only  thing about dogs is, they can't bear rivals, they like to have all  attention paid to themselves exclusively. I will tell you a story I  had from a British colonel.    \"He was stationed in Nova Scotia, with his regiment, when I was a  venden of clocks there. I met him to Windsor, at the Wilcox Inn. He  was mightily taken with my old horse Clay, and offered me a most an  everlastin' long price for him; he said if I would sell him, he  wouldn't stand for money, for he never see such an animal in all his  born days, and so on. But old Clay was above all price, his ditto was  never made yet, and I don't think ever will be. I had no notion to  sell him, and I told him so, but seein' he was dreadful disappointed,  for a rich Englishman actually thinks money will do anything and get  anything, I told him if ever I parted with him he should have him on  condition he would keep him as long as he lived, and so on.    \"Well, it pacified him a bit, and to turn the conversation, sais I,  'Colonel,' sais I, 'what a most an almighty everlastin' super superior  Newfoundler that is,' a pointin' to his dog; 'creation,' sais I, 'if I  had a regiment of such fellows, I believe I wouldn't be afraid of the  devil. My,' sais I, 'what a dog! would you part with him? I'de give  anything for him.'    \"I said that a purpose to show him I had as good a right to keep my  horse as he had his long-haired gentleman.    \"'No,' sais he, with a sort of half smile at my ignorance in pokin'  such a question at him (for a Britisher abroad thinks he has  privileges no one else has), 'no, I don't want to part with him. I  want to take him to England with me. See, he has all the marks of the  true breed: look at his beautiful broad forehead, what an intellectual  one it is, ain't it? then see his delicate mouse-like ears, just large  enough to cover the orifice, and that's all.'    \"'Orifice,' said I, for I hate fine words for common use, they are  like go-to-meeting' clothes on week days, onconvenient, and look too  all fired jam up. Sais I, 'what's that when it's fried. I don't know  that word?'    \"'Why, ear-hole,' said he.    \"'Oh,' sais I, simple like, 'I take now.'    \"He smiled and went on. 'Look at the black roof of his mouth,' said  he, 'and do you see the dew claw, that is a great mark? Then feel that  tail, that is his rudder to steer by when swimming. It's different  from the tail of other dogs, the strength of that joint is surprising.  But his chest, Sir, his chest, see how that is formed on purpose for  diving. It is shaped internally like a seal's. And then, observe the  spread of that webbed foot, and the power of them paddles. There are  two kinds of them, the short and the long haired, but I think those  shaggy ones are the handsomest. They are very difficult to be got now  of the pure breed. I sent to the Bay of Bulls for this one. To have  them in health you must make them stay out of doors in all weather,  and keep them cool, and above all not feed them too high. Salt fish  seems the best food for them, they are so fond of it. Singular that,  ain't it? but a dog is natural, Sir, and a man ain't.    \"'Now, you never saw a codfish at the table of a Newfoundland merchant  in your life. He thinks it smells too much of the shop. In fact, in my  opinion the dog is the only gentleman there. The only one, now that  the Indian is extinct, who has breeding and blood in that land of oil,  blubber, and icebergs.'    \"Lord, I wish one of them had been there to have heard him, wouldn't  he a harpooned him? that's all. He made a considerable of a long yarn  of it, and as it was a text he had often enlarged on, I thought he  never would have ended, but like other preachers, when he got heated,  spit on the slate, rub it all out, and cypher it over again. Thinks I  to myself, I'll play you a bit, my boy.    \"'Exactly,' sais I, 'there is the same difference in dogs and horses  as there is in men. Some are noble by nature, and some vulgar; each is  known by his breed.'    \"'True,' said he, 'very true,' and he stood up a little straighter as  if it did him good to hear a republican say that, for his father was  an Earl. 'A very just remark,' said he, and he eyed me all over, as if  he was rather surprised at my penetration.    \"'But the worst of it,' sais I, 'is that a high bred dog or horse and  a high bred man are only good for one thing. A pointer will point--a  blood horse run--a setter will set--a bull dog fight--and a  Newfoundlander will swim; but what else are they good for? Now a duke  is a duke, and the devil a thing else. All you expect of him is to act  and look like one (and I could point out some that don't even do  that). If he writes a book, and I believe a Scotch one, by the help of  his tutor, did once, or makes a speech, you say, Come now, that is  very well for a duke, and so on. Well, a marquis ain't quite so high  bred, and he is a little better, and so on, downwards; when you get to  an earl, why, he may be good for more things than one. I ain't quite  sure a cross ain't desirable, and in that way that you couldn't  improve the intelligence of both horses, noblemen, and dogs--don't you  think so, Sir?' sais I.    \"'It is natural for you,' said he, not liking the smack of democracy  that I threw in for fun, and looking uneasy. 'So,' sais he (by way of  turning the conversation), 'the sagacity of dogs is very wonderful. I  will tell you an anecdote of this one that has surprised everybody to  whom I have related it.    \"'Last summer my duties led me to George's Island. I take it for  granted you know it. It is a small island situated in the centre of  the harbour of Halifax, has a powerful battery on it, and barracks for  the accommodation of troops. There was a company of my regiment  stationed there at the time. I took this dog and a small terrier,  called Tilt, in the boat with me. The latter was a very active little  fellow that the General had given me a few weeks before. He was such  an amusing creature, that he soon became a universal favourite, and  was suffered to come into the house (a privilege which was never  granted to this gentleman, who paid no regard to the appearance of his  coat, which was often wet and dirty), and who was therefore excluded.    \"'The consequence was, Thunder was jealous, and would not associate  with him, and if ever he took any liberty, he turned on him and  punished him severely. This however he never presumed to do in my  presence, as he knew I would not suffer it, and therefore, when they  both accompanied me in my walks, the big dog contented himself with  treating the other with perfect indifference and contempt. Upon this  occasion, Thunder lay down in the boat and composed himself to sleep,  while the little fellow, who was full of life and animation, and  appeared as if he did not know what it was to close his eyes, sat up,  looked over the gunwale, and seemed to enjoy the thing uncommonly. He  watched the motions of the men, as if he understood what was required  of them, and was anxious they should acquit themselves properly.'    \"'He knew,' said I, 'it was what sailors call the dog watch.'    \"'Very good,' said he, but looking all the time as if he thought the  interruption very bad.    \"'After having made my inspection, I returned to the boat, for the  purpose of recrossing to the town, when I missed the terrier. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6124"],[0,"Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (#9)"],[1,"your poor daughter look with a silk  night-gown, silken petticoats, cambric head-clothes, fine holland linen,  laced shoes that were my lady's; and fine stockings! And how in a little  while must these have looked, like old cast-offs, indeed, and I looked  so for wearing them! And people would have said, (for poor folks are  envious as well as rich,) See there Goody Andrews's daughter, turned  home from her fine place! What a tawdry figure she makes! And how well  that garb becomes her poor parents' circumstances!--And how would  they look upon me, thought I to myself, when they should come to be  threadbare and worn out? And how should I look, even if I could purchase  homespun clothes, to dwindle into them one by one, as I got them?--May  be, an old silk gown, and a linsey-woolsey petticoat, and the like. So,  thought I, I had better get myself at once equipped in the dress that  will become my condition; and though it may look but poor to what I have  been used to wear of late days, yet it will serve me, when I am with  you, for a good holiday and Sunday suit; and what, by a blessing on my  industry, I may, perhaps, make shift to keep up to.    So, as I was saying, unknown to any body, I bought of farmer Nichols's  wife and daughters a good sad-coloured stuff, of their own spinning,  enough to make me a gown and two petticoats; and I made robings and  facings of a pretty bit of printed calico I had by me.    I had a pretty good camblet quilted coat, that I thought might do  tolerably well; and I bought two flannel undercoats; not so good as  my swanskin and fine linen ones, but what will keep me warm, if any  neighbour should get me to go out to help 'em to milk, now and then, as  sometimes I used to do formerly; for I am resolved to do all your good  neighbours what kindness I can; and hope to make myself as much beloved  about you, as I am here.    I got some pretty good Scotch cloth, and made me, of mornings and  nights, when nobody saw me, two shifts; and I have enough left for two  shirts, and two shifts, for you my dear father and mother. When I come  home, I'll make them for you, and desire your acceptance.    Then I bought of a pedlar, two pretty enough round-eared caps, a little  straw-hat, and a pair of knit mittens, turned up with white calico; and  two pair of ordinary blue worsted hose, that make a smartish appearance,  with white clocks, I'll assure you; and two yards of black riband for my  shift sleeves, and to serve as a necklace; and when I had 'em all  come home, I went and looked upon them once in two hours, for two days  together: For, you must know, though I be with Mrs. Jervis, I keep my  own little apartment still for my clothes, and nobody goes thither but  myself. You'll say I was no bad housewife to have saved so much money;  but my dear good lady was always giving me something.    I believed myself the more obliged to do this, because, as I was turned  away for what my good master thought want of duty; and as he expected  other returns for his presents, than I intended to make him, so I  thought it was but just to leave his presents behind me when I went  away; for, you know, if I would not earn his wages, why should I have  them?    Don't trouble yourself about the four guineas, nor borrow to make  them up; for they were given me, with some silver, as I told you, as a  perquisite, being what my lady had about her when she died; and, as I  hope for no wages, I am so vain as to think I have deserved all that  money in the fourteen months, since my lady's death, for she, good soul,  overpaid me before, in learning and other kindnesses. Had she lived,  none of these things might have happened!--But I ought to be thankful  'tis no worse. Every thing will turn about for the best: that's my  confidence.    So, as I was saying, I have provided a new and more suitable dress, and  I long to appear in it, more than ever I did in any new clothes in  my life: for then I shall be soon after with you, and at ease in my  mind--But, mum! Here he comes, I believe.--I am, etc.          LETTER XXI      MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,    I was forced to break off: for I feared my master was coming: but it  proved to be only Mrs. Jervis. She said, I can't endure you should be  so much by yourself, Pamela. And I, said I, dread nothing so much as  company; for my heart was up at my mouth now, for fear my master was  coming. But I always rejoice to see dear Mrs. Jervis.    Said she, I have had a world of talk with my master about you. I am  sorry for it, said I, that I am made of so much consequence as to be  talked of by him. O, said she, I must not tell you all; but you are of  more consequence to him than you think for----    Or wish for, said I; for the fruits of being of consequence to him,  would make me of none to myself, or any body else.    Said she, Thou art as witty as any lady in the land; I wonder where thou  gottest it. But they must be poor ladies, with such great opportunities,  I am sure, if they have no more wit than I.--But let that pass.    I suppose, said I, that I am of so much consequence, however, as to vex  him, if it be but to think he can't make a fool of such a one as I; and  that is nothing at all, but a rebuke to the pride of his high condition,  which he did not expect, and knows not how to put up with.    There is something in that, may be, said she: but, indeed, Pamela, he is  very angry with you too; and calls you twenty perverse things; wonders  at his own folly, to have shewn you so much favour, as he calls it;  which he was first inclined to, he says, for his mother's sake, and  would have persisted to shew you for your own, if you was not your own  enemy.    Nay, now I shan't love you, Mrs. Jervis, said I; you are going to  persuade me to ask to stay, though you know the hazards I run.--No, said  she, he says you shall go; for he thinks it won't be for his reputation  to keep you: but he wished (don't speak of it for the world, Pamela,)  that he knew a lady of birth, just such another as yourself, in person  and mind, and he would marry her to-morrow.    I coloured up to the ears at this word: but said, Yet, if I was the lady  of birth, and he would offer to be rude first, as he has twice done to  poor me, I don't know whether I would have him: For she that can bear an  insult of that kind, I should think not worthy to be a gentleman's wife:  any more than he would be a gentleman that would offer it.    Nay, now, Pamela, said she, thou carriest thy notions a great way. Well,  dear Mrs. Jervis, said I, very seriously, for I could not help it, I am  more full of fears than ever. I have only to beg of you, as one of the  best friends I have in the world, to say nothing of my asking to  stay. To say my master likes me, when I know what end he aims at, is  abomination to my ears; and I shan't think myself safe till I am at my  poor father's and mother's.    She was a little angry with me, till I assured her that I had not the  least uneasiness on her account, but thought myself safe under her  protection and friendship. And so we dropt the discourse for that time.    I hope to have finished this ugly waistcoat in two days; after which  I have only some linen to get up, and shall then let you know how  I contrive as to my passage; for the heavy rains will make it sad  travelling on foot: but may be I may get a place to which is ten miles  of the way, in farmer Nichols's close cart; for I can't sit a horse well  at all, and may be nobody will be suffered to see me on upon the way.  But I hope to let you know more. From, etc.          LETTER XXII      MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,    All my fellow-servants have now some notion that I am to go away; but  can't imagine for what. Mrs. Jervis tells them, that my father and  mother, growing in years, cannot live without me; and so I go home to  them, to help to comfort their old age; but they seem not to believe it.    What they found it out by was; the butler heard him say to me, as I  passed by him, in the entry leading to the hall, Who's that? Pamela,  sir, said I. Pamela! said he, How long are you to stay here?--Only,  please your honour, said I, till I have done the waistcoat; and it  is almost finished.--You might, says he, (very roughly indeed,) have  finished that long enough ago, I should have thought. Indeed, and please  your honour, said I, I have worked early and late upon it; there is a  great deal of work in it.--Work in it! said he; You mind your pen more  than your needle; I don't want such idle sluts to stay in my house.    He seemed startled, when he saw the butler, as he entered the hall,  where Mr. Jonathan stood. What do you here? said he.--The butler was as  much confounded as I; for, never having been taxed so roughly, I could  not help crying sadly; and got out of both their ways to Mrs. Jervis,  and told my complaint. This love, said she, is the d----! In how many  strange shapes does it make people shew themselves! And in some the  farthest from their hearts.    So one, and then another, has been since whispering, Pray, Mrs. Jervis,  are we to lose Mrs. Pamela? as they always call me--What has she done?  And she tells them, as above, about going home to you.    She said afterwards to me, Well, Pamela, you have made our master, from  the sweetest tempered gentleman in the world, one of the most peevish.  But you have it in your power to make him as sweet-tempered as ever;  though I hope you'll never do it on his terms.    This was very good in Mrs. Jervis; but it intimated, that she thought  as ill of his designs as I; and as she knew his mind more than I, it  convinced me that I ought to get away as fast as I could.    My master came in, just now, to speak to Mrs. Jervis about household  matters, having some company to dine with him to-morrow; and I stood up,  and having been crying at his roughness in the entry, I turned away my  face.    You may well, said he, turn away your cursed face; I wish I had"]]]
