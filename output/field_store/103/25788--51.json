At the back is the  large entrance door; to the left, far back, steps lead up to an inner  chamber; on the same side, nearer the front, stands a table with a  broad bench behind it, fixed to the wall, and with stools in front. The  stage remains empty for a space. Outside a storm is just subsiding.  Siegmund opens the entrance door from without, and enters. With his  hand on the latch he surveys the room. He seems overwhelmed with  fatigue; his dress and appearance indicate that he is in flight. He  shuts the door behind him when he sees nobody, walks to the hearth with  the final effort of an utterly exhausted man, and throws himself down  on a bearskin rug._        SIEGMUND          I rest on this hearth,        Heedless who owns it.            [_He sinks back and remains stretched out          motionless. Sieglinde enters from the inner          chamber; she thinks her husband has returned. Her          grave look changes to one of surprise when she sees          the stranger stretched out on the hearth._    SIEGLINDE [_Still at the back._          A stranger here!        He must be questioned.            [_Coming nearer._          What man came in        And lies on the hearth?            [_As Siegmund does not move, she draws nearer still          and looks at him._          Way-worn, weary        He seems and spent.        Faints he from weariness?        Can he be sick?    [_She bends over him, and listens._          He breathes still, his eyelids        Are sealed but in slumber.    Worthy, valiant his mien,    Though so worn he rests.    SIEGMUND [_Suddenly raising his head._          A drink! A drink!    SIEGLINDE          I go to fetch it.    [_She takes a drinking-horn and hurries out.  She returns with it full, and offers it to  Siegmund._          Lo, the water        Thy thirsting lips longed for:    Water brought at thy wish!            [_Siegmund drinks, and hands her back the horn.          As he signifies his thanks with a movement of the          head, he gazes at her with growing interest._    SIEGMUND          Welcome the water!        Quenched is my thirst.        My weary load        Lighter it makes;        New courage it gives;        Mine eyes that slept    Re-open glad on the world.    Who soothes and comforts me so?    SIEGLINDE          This house and this wife        Belong to Hunding.    Stay thou here as his guest;    Tarry till he comes home.    SIEGMUND          Shelter he surely        Will grant a worn,    Wounded, weaponless stranger.    SIEGLINDE [_With anxious haste._    Quick, show me! Where are thy wounds?    SIEGMUND            [_Shakes himself and springs up briskly to a          sitting posture._          My wounds are slight,        Scarce worthy remark;        My limbs are well knit still,        Whole and unharmed.    If my spear and shield had but been    Half so strong as my arm is,    I had vanquished the foe;    But in splinters were spear and shield.        The horde of foemen        Harassed me sore;        Through storm and strife        Spent was my force;    But, faster than I from foemen,    All my faintness has fled;    Darkness fell deep on my lids,    But now the sun again laughs.    SIEGLINDE            [_Goes to the storeroom, fills a horn with          mead, and proffers it to Siegmund with friendly          eagerness._          This healing and honeyed        Draught of mead    Deign to accept from me.    SIEGMUND      Set it first to thy lips.            [_Sieglinde sips from the horn and hands it back          to him. Siegmund takes a long draught, regarding          Sieglinde with increasing warmth. Still gazing,          he takes the horn from his lips and lets it sink          slowly, while his features express strong emotion.          He sighs deeply, and lowers his gaze gloomily to          the ground._    SIEGMUND [_In a trembling voice._      Thou hast tended an ill-fated one!        May all evil        Be turned from thee!            [_He starts up quickly, and goes towards the the          back._          I have been solaced        By sweet repose:    Onward now I must press.    SIEGLINDE      Who pursues thee so close at thy heels?            [_Turning round quickly._    SIEGMUND [_Stops._          Bad luck pursues me,        Everywhere follows;        And where I linger        Trouble still finds me:    Be thou preserved from its touch!    I must not gaze but go.            [_He strides hastily to the door and lifts the          latch._    SIEGLINDE [_Forgetting herself calls impetuously after him._          Then tarry here!    Misfortune thou canst not bring    To those who abide with it!

All this while the little fat musicker was breathing the notes:      Tiddle-tiddle-iddle, oom, pom-pom,      and they had to speak loud in order to hear themselves.  The shaggy man  said:    \"Who are you, sir?\"    The reply came in the shape of this sing-song:      I'm Allegro da Capo, a very famous man;    Just find another, high or low, to match me if you can.        Some people try, but can't, to play        And have to practice every day;    But I've been musical always, since first my life began.      \"Why, I b'lieve he's proud of it,\" exclaimed Dorothy; \"and seems to me  I've heard worse music than he makes.\"    \"Where?\" asked Button-Bright.    \"I've forgotten, just now.  But Mr. Da Capo is certainly a strange  person--isn't he?--and p'r'aps he's the only one of his kind in all the  world.\"    This praise seemed to please the little fat musicker, for he swelled  out his chest, looked important and sang as follows:      I wear no band around me,        And yet I am a band!    I do not strain to make my strains        But, on the other hand,    My toot is always destitute        Of flats or other errors;    To see sharp and be natural are        For me but minor terrors.      \"I don't quite understand that,\" said Polychrome, with a puzzled look;  \"but perhaps it's because I'm accustomed only to the music of the  spheres.\"    \"What's that?\" asked Button-Bright.    \"Oh, Polly means the atmosphere and hemisphere, I s'pose,\" explained  Dorothy.    \"Oh,\" said Button-Bright.    \"Bow-wow!\" said Toto.    But the musicker was still breathing his constant      Oom, pom-pom; Oom pom-pom--      and it seemed to jar on the shaggy man's nerves.    \"Stop it, can't you?\" he cried angrily; \"or breathe in a whisper; or  put a clothes-pin on your nose.  Do something, anyhow!\"    But the fat one, with a sad look, sang this answer:      Music hath charms, and it may    Soothe even the savage, they say;        So if savage you feel        Just list to my reel,    For sooth to say that's the real way.      The shaggy man had to laugh at this, and when he laughed he stretched  his donkey mouth wide open.  Said Dorothy:    \"I don't know how good his poetry is, but it seems to fit the notes, so  that's all that can be 'xpected.\"    \"I like it,\" said Button-Bright, who was staring hard at the musicker,  his little legs spread wide apart.  To the surprise of his companions,  the boy asked this long question:    \"If I swallowed a mouth-organ, what would I be?\"    \"An organette,\" said the shaggy man.  \"But come, my dears; I think the  best thing we can do is to continue on our journey before Button-Bright  swallows anything.  We must try to find that Land of Oz, you know.\"    Hearing this speech the musicker sang, quickly:      If you go to the Land of Oz    Please take me along, because        On Ozma's birthday        I'm anxious to play    The loveliest song ever was.      \"No thank you,\" said Dorothy; \"we prefer to travel alone.  But if I see  Ozma I'll tell her you want to come to her birthday party.\"    \"Let's be going,\" urged the shaggy man, anxiously.    Polly was already dancing along the road, far in advance, and the  others turned to follow her.  Toto did not like the fat musicker and  made a grab for his chubby leg.  Dorothy quickly caught up the growling  little dog and hurried after her companions, who were walking faster  than usual in order to get out of hearing.  They had to climb a hill,  and until they got to the top they could not escape the musicker's  monotonous piping:      Oom, pom-pom; oom, pom-pom;    Tiddle-iddle-widdle, oom, pom-pom;    Oom, pom-pom--pah!      As they passed the brow of the hill, however, and descended on the  other side, the sounds gradually died away, whereat they all felt much  relieved.    \"I'm glad I don't have to live with the organ-man; aren't you, Polly?\"  said Dorothy.    \"Yes indeed,\" answered the Rainbow's Daughter.    \"He's nice,\" declared Button-Bright, soberly.    \"I hope your Princess Ozma won't invite him to her birthday  celebration,\" remarked the shaggy man; \"for the fellow's music would  drive her guests all crazy.  You've given me an idea, Button-Bright; I  believe the musicker must have swallowed an accordeon in his youth.\"    \"What's 'cordeon?\" asked the boy.    \"It's a kind of pleating,\" explained Dorothy, putting down the dog.    \"Bow-wow!\" said Toto, and ran away at a mad gallop to chase a  bumble-bee.          9.  Facing the Scoodlers      The country wasn't so pretty now.  Before the travelers appeared a  rocky plain covered with hills on which grew nothing green.  They were  nearing some low mountains, too, and the road, which before had been  smooth and pleasant to walk upon, grew rough and uneven.    Button-Bright's little feet stumbled more than once, and Polychrome  ceased her dancing because the walking was now so difficult that she  had no trouble to keep warm.    It had become afternoon, yet there wasn't a thing for their luncheon  except two apples which the shaggy man had taken from the breakfast  table.  He divided these into four pieces and gave a portion to each of  his companions.  Dorothy and Button-Bright were glad to get theirs; but  Polly was satisfied with a small bite, and Toto did not like apples.    \"Do you know,\" asked the Rainbow's Daughter, \"if this is the right road  to the Emerald City?\"    \"No, I don't,\" replied Dorothy, \"but it's the only road in this part of  the country, so we may as well go to the end of it.\"    \"It looks now as if it might end pretty soon,\" remarked the shaggy man;  \"and what shall we do if it does?\"    \"Don't know,\" said Button-Bright.    \"If I had my Magic Belt,\" replied Dorothy, thoughtfully, \"it could do  us a lot of good just now.\"    \"What is your Magic Belt?\" asked Polychrome.    \"It's a thing I captured from the Nome King one day, and it can do  'most any wonderful thing.  But I left it with Ozma, you know; 'cause  magic won't work in Kansas, but only in fairy countries.\"    \"Is this a fairy country?\" asked Button-Bright.    \"I should think you'd know,\" said the little girl, gravely.  \"If it  wasn't a fairy country you couldn't have a fox head and the shaggy man  couldn't have a donkey head, and the Rainbow's Daughter would be  invis'ble.\"    \"What's that?\" asked the boy.    \"You don't seem to know anything, Button-Bright.  Invis'ble is a thing  you can't see.\"    \"Then Toto's invis'ble,\" declared the boy, and Dorothy found he was  right.  Toto had disappeared from view, but they could hear him barking  furiously among the heaps of grey rock ahead of them.    They moved forward a little faster to see what the dog was barking at,  and found perched upon a point of rock by the roadside a curious  creature.  It had the form of a man, middle-sized and rather slender  and graceful; but as it sat silent and motionless upon the peak they  could see that its face was black as ink, and it wore a black cloth  costume made like a union suit and fitting tight to its skin.  Its  hands were black, too, and its toes curled down, like a bird's.  The  creature was black all over except its hair, which was fine, and  yellow, banged in front across the black forehead and cut close at the  sides.  The eyes, which were fixed steadily upon the barking dog, were  small and sparkling and looked like the eyes of a weasel.    \"What in the world do you s'pose that is?\" asked Dorothy in a hushed  voice, as the little group of travelers stood watching the strange  creature.    \"Don't know,\" said Button-Bright.    The thing gave a jump and turned half around, sitting in the same place  but with the other side of its body facing them.  Instead of being  black, it was now pure white, with a face like that of a clown in a  circus and hair of a brilliant purple.  The creature could bend either  way, and its white toes now curled the same way the black ones on the  other side had done.    \"It has a face both front and back,\" whispered Dorothy, wonderingly;  \"only there's no back at all, but two fronts.\"    Having made the turn, the being sat motionless as before, while Toto  barked louder at the white man than he had done at the black one.    \"Once,\" said the shaggy man, \"I had a jumping jack like that, with two  faces.\"    \"Was it alive?\" asked Button-Bright.    \"No,\" replied the shaggy man; \"it worked on strings and was made of  wood.\"    \"Wonder if this works with strings,\" said Dorothy; but Polychrome cried  \"Look!\" for another creature just like the first had suddenly appeared  sitting on another rock, its black side toward them.  The two twisted  their heads around and showed a black face on the white side of one and  a white face on the black side of the other.    \"How curious,\" said Polychrome; \"and how loose their heads seem to be!  Are they friendly to us, do you think?\"    \"Can't tell, Polly,\" replied Dorothy.  \"Let's ask 'em.\"    The creatures flopped first one way and then the other, showing black  or white by turns; and now another joined them, appearing on another  rock.  Our friends had come to a little hollow in the hills, and the  place where they now stood was surrounded by jagged peaks of rock,  except where the road ran through.    \"Now there are four of them,\" said the shaggy man.    \"Five,\" declared Polychrome.    \"Six,\" said Dorothy.    \"Lots of 'em!\"  cried Button-Bright; and so there were--quite a row of  the two-sided black and white creatures sitting on the rocks all around.    Toto stopped barking and ran between Dorothy's feet, where he crouched  down as if afraid.  The creatures did not look pleasant or friendly, to  be sure, and the shaggy man's donkey face became solemn, indeed.    \"Ask 'em who they are, and what they want,\" whispered Dorothy; so the  shaggy man called out in a loud voice:    \"Who are you?\"    \"Scoodlers!\" they yelled in chorus, their voices"]]]
