[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9479"],[0,"The Boy Life of Napoleon, Afterwards Emperor of the French (#9)"],[1,"   \"What is your name, new boy?\" the big boy of Autun school called out to  Napoleon, as on that first day of the new year, which was, as I have  said, his first day at school, the Bonaparte brothers wandered about the  schoolyard, strangers and shy.    \"Na-polle-o-nay!\" answered the little new-comer, giving the Corsican  pronunciation to his name of Napoleon.    \"Oho! so!\" cried the big boy, mimicking him. \"Na-pailli-au-nez, is it?  See, fellows, see! this is Mr. Straw-Nose!\"    For, you see, the way Napoleon pronounced his name sounded very much  like the French words that mean \"the nose of straw.\" That, of course,  gave the boys at the school a rare chance to nickname; and so poor  Napoleon was called \"Mr. Straw-Nose\" all the time he was at that school.    This was not very long, however; for in three months he had made  sufficient progress in his study of French to permit him to pass into  the military school at Brienne, into which his father was at last able  to procure his admission.    But, while he was at Autun, Napoleon seems to have been a favorite with  his teachers. One of them, the Abbe Chardon, spoke of him as \"a sober,  thoughtful child.\" He wished very much to get into the military school;  so he worked hard, learned quickly, and was proud of what he called his  ability.    But when the boys tried to plague him, or to twit him for being a  Corsican, the boy was ready enough to talk back.    The French boys knew but little about Corsica, and had a certain  contempt for the little island which, so they declared, was the home of  robbers, and which France had one day gone across and conquered.    \"Bah, Corsican!\" one of the big boys called out to the new scholar, \"and  what is Corsica? Just an island of cowards. Just see how we Frenchmen  whipped you out of your boots!\"    Napoleon clinched his little fist, and turned hotly on his tormentor.  But he was already learning the lesson of self-control.    \"And how did you do it, Frenchman?\" he replied. \"By numbers. If you had  been but four to one against us, you would never have conquered us. But,  behold! you were ten to one! That is too much to struggle against.\"    \"And yet you boast of your general--your leader,\" said the other boy.  \"You say he is a fine commander--this--how do you call him?--this  Paoli.\"    \"I say so; yes, sir,\" Napoleon replied sadly. Then, as if his ambition  led him on, he added, \"I would like to be like him. What could I not do  then!\"    This feeling of being a Corsican, an outsider at the school, made the  boy quiet and retiring. He kept by himself, just as he had at home when  things did not suit him; he walked out alone, and played with no one. To  be sure, he was more or less with his brother Joseph, who loved his  ease and comfort, did not fire up when the other boys teased him, and  smoothed over many a quarrel between them and his brother.    Napoleon would often find fault with Joseph's lack of spirit, as he  called it; but Joseph, all through life, liked to take things easy, and  hated to face trouble. Most of us do, you know; but it was the readiness  of Napoleon to boldly face danger, and to attempt what appeared to be  the impossible, that made him the self-reliant boy, the successful man,  the conqueror, the emperor, the hero.          CHAPTER NINE    THE LONELY SCHOOL-BOY    While Napoleon was at Autun school, studying French, and preparing for  entrance into the military academy, his father, Charles Bonaparte, was  at Versailles, trying to get a little more money from the king, in  return for his services as Corsica's delegate to France.    At the same time he was working to complete the arrangements which  should permit him to enter Napoleon at the military school, at the  expense of the state. This he finally accomplished; and on the  twenty-third of April, in the year 1779, Napoleon entered the royal  military school at Brienne.    There were ten of these military schools in France. They were started  as training-schools for boys who were to become officers in the French  army. The one at Brienne was a bare and ugly-looking lot of buildings  in the midst of trees and gardens, looking down toward the little River  Aube, and near to the fine old chateau, or nobleman's house, built, a  hundred years before Napoleon's day, by the last Count of Brienne.    There were a hundred and fifty boys at Brienne school, although there  was scarcely room enough for a hundred and twenty.    The new-comer was therefore crowded in with the others; and you may be  sure that the old boys did not make life pleasant and easy for the new  boy.    Although he had learned to write and speak French during his three  months' schooling at Autun, he could not, of course, speak it very well;  so the boys plagued him for that. And when he told them his name,  they, too, made fun of his pronunciation of Na-po-le-one, and at once  nicknamed him, \"straw-nose,\" just as the Autun boys had done.    Most of the boys who attended Brienne school were the sons of French  noblemen. They had plenty of money to spend; they made a show of it, and  dressed and did things as finely as they could. Napoleon, you know, was  poor. His father had scrimped and begged and borrowed to send his boys  to school. He could not, therefore, give them much for themselves; so  the French boys, with the money to spend and the manners to show, made  no end of fun of the little Corsican, who had neither money nor manners.    At once he got into trouble. He did not like, nor did he understand, the  ways of the French boys; he was alone; he was homesick; and naturally he  became sulky and uncompanionable. When the boys teased him, he tossed  back a wrathful answer; when they made fun of his appearance, he grew  angry and sullen; and when they tried to force him into their society,  he went off by himself, and acted like a little hermit.    But when they twitted him on his nationality, called him \"Straw-nose,  the Corsican,\" and made all manner of fun of that rocky and (as they  called it) savage island, then all the patriotism in the boy's nature  was aroused, and he called his tormentors French cowards, with whom he  would one day get square.    \"Bah, Corsican! and what will you do?\" asked Peter Bouquet. \"I hope some  day to give Corsica her liberty,\" said Napoleon; \"and then all Frenchmen  shall march into the sea.\"    Upon which all the boys laughed loudly; and Napoleon, walking off in  disgust, went into the school-building, and there vented his wrath upon  a portrait of Choiseul, that hung upon the wall.    \"Ah, ha! blackguard, pawnbroker, traitor!\" he cried, shaking his fist at  this portrait of a stout and smiling-looking gentleman. \"I loathe you! I  despise you! I spit upon you!\" And he did.    Now, Monsieur the Count de Choiseul was the French nobleman who was  one of the old King Louis's ministers and advisers. It was he who had  planned the conquest of Corsica, and annexed it to France. You may not  wonder, then, that the little Corsican, homesick for his native island,  and hot with rage toward those who made fun of it, when he came upon  this portrait of the man to whom, as he had been taught, all Corsica's  troubles were due, should have vented his wrath upon it, and heaped  insults upon it.      [Illustration: \"_What' you will not ask Monsieur the Count's pardon?\"_]    Unfortunately for him, however, the teachers at Brienne did not  appreciate his patriotic wrath; so, when one of the tattle-tales  reported Napoleon's actions, at once he was pounced upon, and ordered to  ask pardon for what he had said and done, standing before the portrait  of Corsica's enslaver.    He approached the portrait so reluctantly and contemptuously, that one  of the teachers scolded him sharply.    \"You are not worthy to be a French officer, foolish boy,\" the teacher  declared; \"you are no true son of France, thus to insult so great and  noble a Frenchman as Monsieur the Count de Choiseul.\"    \"I am a son of Corsica,\" Napoleon replied proudly; \"that noble country  which this man ground in the dust.\"    \"As well he might,\" replied the teacher tauntingly. \"He was Corsica's  best friend. He was worth a thousand Paoli's.\"    \"It is not so!\" cried Napoleon, hot with patriotic indignation. \"You  talk like all Frenchmen. Paoli was a great man. He loved his country.  I admire him. I wish to be like him. I can never forgive my father for  having been willing to desert the cause of Corsica, and agree to its  union with France. He should have followed Paoli's lead, even though it  took him with Paoli, into exile in England.\"    \"Bah! your father!\" one of the big boys standing by exclaimed; \"and who  is your father, Straw-nose?\"    Napoleon turned upon his tormentor; \"a better man than you, Frenchman!\"  he cried; \"a better man than this Choiseul here. My father is a  Corsican.\"    \"A stubborn rebel, this boy,\" said the teacher, now losing his temper.  \"What! you will not ask Monsieur the Count's pardon, as a rebel should?  Then will we tame your spirit. Is a little arrogant Corsican to defy all  France, and Brienne school besides? Go, sir! We will devise some  fine punishment for you, that shall well repay your insolence and  disobedience.\"    So Napoleon, in disgrace, left the schoolroom, and pacing down his  favorite walk, the pleasant avenue of chestnut-trees that lined the  path from one of the schoolhouse doors, he sought his one retreat and  hermitage,--his loved and bravely defended garden.    That garden was a regular Napoleonic idea. I must tell you about it.          CHAPTER TEN.    IN NAPOLEON'S GARDEN.    One of the rules of Brienne school was that each pupil should know  something about agriculture. To illustrate this study, each one of the  one hundred and fifty boys had a little garden-spot set aside for him to  cultivate and keep in order.    Some of the boys did this from choice, and because they loved to watch  things grow; but many of them were careless, and had no love"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/949"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Submarine Boat; Or, Under the Ocean for Sunken Treasure (#9)"],[1,"ace,\" declared Mr. Damon. \"Bless my coat-tails, but I'm sorry! Maybe,  after all, those men were so interested in what they themselves were  saying that they didn't understand what you said.\"    But if there had been any doubts on this score they would have been  dissolved had Tom and his friend been able to see the actions of Mr.  Berg and his companion a little later.  The plans of the  treasure-hunters had been revealed to their ears.          Chapter Eight    Another Treasure Expedition      While Tom and Mr. Damon continued on to Atlantis after the oil, the  young inventor lamenting from time to time that his remarks about the  real destination of the Advance had been overheard by Mr. Berg, the  latter and his companion were hastening back along the path that ran on  one side of the sand dunes.    \"What's your hurry?\" asked Mr. Maxwell, who was with the submarine  agent. \"You turned around as if you were shot when you saw that man and  the lad. There didn't appear to be any cause for such a hurry. From  what I could hear they were talking about a submarine. You're in the  same business. You might be friends.\"    \"Yes, we might,\" admitted Mr. Berg with a peculiar smile; \"but, unless  I'm very much mistaken, we're going to be rivals.\"    \"Rivals? What do you mean?\"    \"I can't tell you now. Perhaps I may later. But if you don't mind, walk  a little faster, please. I want to get to a long-distance telephone.\"    \"What for?\"    \"I have just overheard something that I wish to communicate to my  employers, Bentley & Eagert.\"    \"Overheard something? I don't see what it could be, unless that lad--\"    \"You'll learn in good time,\" went on the submarine agent.  \"But I must  telephone at once.\"    A little later the two men had reached a trolley line that ran into  Atlantis, and they arrived at the city before Mr. Damon and Tom got  there, as the latter had to go by a circuitous route. Mr. Berg lost no  time in calling up his firm by telephone.    \"I have had another talk with Mr. Swift,\" he reported to Mr. Bentley,  who came to the instrument in Philadelphia.    \"Well, what does he say?\" was the impatient question. \"I can't  understand his not wanting to try for the Government prize. It is  astonishing. You said you were going to discover the reason, Mr Berg,  but you haven't done so.\"    \"I have.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"Well, the reason Mr. Swift and his son don't care to try for the fifty  thousand dollar prize is that they are after one of three hundred  thousand dollars.\"    \"Three hundred thousand dollars!\" cried Mr. Bentley. \"What government  is going to offer such a prize as that for submarines, when they are  getting almost as common as airships? We ought to have a try for that  ourselves. What government is it?\"    \"No government at all. But I think we ought to have a try for it, Mr.  Bentley.\"    \"Explain.\"    \"Well, I have just learned, most accidentally, that the Swifts are  going after sunken treasure--three hundred thousand dollars in gold  bullion.\"    \"Sunken treasure? Where?    \"I don't know exactly, but off the coast of Uruguay,\" and Mr. Berg  rapidly related what he had overheard Tom tell Mr. Damon. Mr. Bentley  was much excited and impatient for more details, but his agent could  not give them to him.    \"Well,\" concluded the senior member of the firm of submarine boat  builders, \"if the Swifts are going after treasure, so can we. Come to  Philadelphia at once, Mr. Berg, and we'll talk this matter over. There  is no time to lose.  We can afford to forego the Government prize for  the chance of getting a much larger one. We have as much right to  search for the sunken gold as the Swifts have. Come here at once, and  we will make our plans.\"    \"All right,\" agreed the agent with a smile as he hung up the receiver.  \"I guess,\" he murmured to himself, \"that you won't be so high and  mighty with me after this, Tom Swift.  We'll see who has the best boat,  after all. We'll have a contest and a competition, but not for a  government prize.  It will be for the sunken gold.\"    It was easy to see that Mr. Berg was much pleased with himself.    Meanwhile, Tom and Mr. Damon had reached Atlantis, and had purchased  the oil. They started back, but Tom took a street leading toward the  center of the place, instead of striking for the beach path, along  which they had come.    \"Where are you going?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"I want to see if that Andy Foger has come back here,\" replied the lad,  and he told of having been shut in the tank by the bully.    \"I've never properly punished him for that trick,\" he went on, \"though  we did manage to burst his auto tires. I'm curious to know how he knew  enough to turn that gear and shut the tank door. He must have been  loitering near the shop, seen me go in the submarine alone, watched his  chance and sneaked in after me. But I'd like to get a complete  explanation, and if I once got hold of Andy I could make him talk,\" and  Tom clenched his fist in a manner that augured no good for the  squint-eyed lad. \"He was stopping at the same hotel with Mr. Berg, and  he hurried away after the trick he played on me. I next saw him in  Shopton, but I thought perhaps he might have come back here. I'm going  to inquire at the hotel,\" he added.    Andy's name was not on the register since his hasty flight, however,  and Tom, after inquiring from the clerk and learning that Mr. Berg was  still a guest at the hostelry, rejoined Mr. Damon.    \"Bless my hat!\" exclaimed that eccentric individual as they started  back to the lonely beach where the submarine was awaiting her advent  into the water. \"The more I think of the trip I'm going to take, the  more I like it.\"    \"I hope you will,\" remarked Tom. \"It will be a new experience for all  of us. There's only one thing worrying me, and that is about Mr. Berg  having overheard what I said.\"    \"Oh, don't worry about that. Can't we slip away and leave no trace in  the water?\"    \"I hope so, but I must tell dad and Mr. Sharp about what happened.\"    The aged inventor was not a little alarmed at what his son related, but  he agreed with Mr. Damon, whom he heartily welcomed, that little was to  be apprehended from Berg and his employers.    \"They know we're after a sunken wreck, but that's all they do know,\"  said Tom's father. \"We are only waiting for the arrival of Captain  Alden Weston, and then we will go. Even if Bentley & Eagert make a try  for the treasure we'll have the start of them, and this will be a case  of first come, first served. Don't worry, Tom. I'm glad you're going,  Mr Damon. Come, I will show you our submarine.\"    As father and son, with their guest, were going to the machine shop,  Mr. Sharp met them. He had a letter in his hand.    \"Good news!\" the balloonist cried. \"Captain Weston will be with us  to-morrow. He will arrive at the Beach Hotel in Atlantis, and wants one  of us to meet him there. He has considerable information about the  wreck.\"    \"The Beach Hotel,\" murmured Tom. \"That is where Mr. Berg is stopping. I  hope he doesn't worm any of our secret from Captain Weston,\" and it was  with a feeling of uneasiness that the young inventor continued after  his father and Mr. Damon to where the submarine was.          Chapter Nine    Captain Weston's Advent      \"Bless my water ballast, but that certainly is a fine boat!\" cried Mr.  Damon, when he had been shown over the new craft.  \"I think I shall  feel even safer in that than in the Red Cloud.\"    \"Oh, don't go back on the airship!\" exclaimed Mr Sharp. \"I was counting  on taking you on another trip.\"    \"Well, maybe after we get back from under the ocean,\" agreed Mr. Damon.  \"I particularly like the cabin arrangements of the Advance. I think I  shall enjoy myself.\"    He would be hard to please who could not take pleasure from a trip in  the submarine. The cabin was particularly fine, and the sleeping  arrangements were good.    More supplies could be carried than was possible on the airship, and  there was more room in which to cook and serve food. Mr. Damon was fond  of good living, and the kitchen pleased him as much as anything else.    Early the next morning Tom set out for Atlantis, to meet Captain Weston  at the hotel. The young inventor inquired of the clerk whether the  seafaring man had arrived, and was told that he had come the previous  evening.    \"Is he in his room?\" asked Tom.    \"No,\" answered the clerk with a peculiar grin. \"He's an odd character.  Wouldn't go to bed last night until we had every window in his room  open, though it was blowing quite hard, and likely to storm. The  captain said he was used to plenty of fresh air. Well, I guess he got  it, all right.\"    \"Where is he now?\" asked the youth, wondering what sort of an  individual he was to meet.    \"Oh, he was up before sunrise, so some of the scrubwomen told me. They  met him coming from his room, and he went right down to the beach with  a big telescope he always carries with him. He hasn't come back yet.  Probably he's down on the sand.\"    \"Hasn't he had breakfast?\"    \"No. He left word he didn't want to eat until about four bells,  whatever time that is.\"    \"It's ten o'clock,\" replied Tom, who had been studying up on sea terms  lately. \"Eight bells is eight o'clock in the morning, or four in the  afternoon or eight at night, according to the time of day. Then there's  one bell for every half hour, so four bells this morning would be ten  o'clock in this watch, I suppose.\"    \"Oh, that's the way it goes, eh?\" asked the clerk. \"I never could get  it through my head. What is twelve o'clock noon?\"    \"That's eight bells, too; so is twelve o'clock midnight.  Eight bells  is as high as they go on a ship. But I guess I'll go down and see if I  can meet the captain. It will soon be ten o'clock, or four bells, and  he must be hungry for breakfast. By the way, is that Mr. Berg still  here?\"    \"No; he went away early this morning. He and Captain Weston seemed to  strike up quite an"]]]
