Our Lord said: \"Daughter, thou hast desired in thy mind to have many  priests in the town of Lynn, that might sing and read night and day  for to serve Me, worship Me, and praise Me, and thank Me for the  goodness that I have done to thee in earth; and therefore, daughter,  I promise thee that thou shalt have meed and reward in heaven for  the good wills and good desires, as if thou haddest done them in  deed.    \"Daughter, thou shalt have as great meed and as great reward with Me  in heaven, for thy good service and thy good deeds that thou hast  done in thy mind, as if thou haddest done the same with thy bodily  wits withoutforth.[148]    \"And, daughter, I thank thee for the charity that thou hast to all  lecherous men and women; for thou prayest for them and weepest for  them many a tear, desiring that I should deliver them out of sin,  and be as gracious to them as I was to Mary Magdalene, that they  might have as much grace to love Me as Mary Magdalene had; and with  this condition thou wouldest that everich[149] of them should have  twenty pounds a year to love and praise Me; and, daughter, this  great charity which thou hast to them in thy prayer pleaseth Me  right well. And, daughter, also I thank thee for the charity which  thou hast in thy prayer, when thou prayest for all Jews and  Saracens, and all heathen people that they should come to Christian  faith, that My name might be magnified in them. Furthermore,  daughter, I thank thee for the general charity that thou hast to all  people that be now in this world, and to all those that are to come  unto the world's end; that thou wouldest be hacked as small as flesh  to the pot for their love, so that I would by thy death save them  all from damnation, if it pleased Me. And, therefore, daughter, for  all these good wills and desires, thou shalt have full meed and  reward in heaven, believe it right well and doubt never a deal.\"    She said: \"Good Lord, I would be laid naked upon an hurdle for Thy  love, all men to wonder on me and to cast filth and dirt on me, and  be drawen from town to town every day my life time, if Thou were  pleased thereby, and no man's soul hindered. Thy will be fulfilled  and not mine.\"    \"Daughter,\" He said, \"as oftentimes as thou sayest or thinkest:  Worshipped be all the holy places in Jerusalem, where Christ  suffered bitter pain and passion in: thou shalt have the same pardon  as if thou were there with thy bodily presence, both to thyself and  to all those that thou wilt give to.[150]    \"The same pardon that was granted thee aforetime, it was confirmed  on Saint Nicholas day, that is to say, playne[151] remission; and it  is not only granted to thee, but also to all those that believe, and  to all those that shall believe unto the world's end, that God  loveth thee, and shall thank God for thee. If they will forsake  their sin, and be in full will no more to turn again thereto, but be  sorry and heavy for that they have done, and will do due penance  therefore, they shall have the same pardon that is granted to  thyself; and that is all the pardon that is in Jerusalem,[152] as  was granted thee when thou were at Rafnys.\"[153]    That day that she suffered no tribulation for our Lord's sake, she  was not merry nor glad, as that day when she suffered tribulation.    Our Lord Jesus said unto her: \"Patience is more worth than miracles  doing. Daughter, it is more pleasure to Me that thou suffer  despites, scorns, shames, reproofs, wrongs, and diseases, than if  thine head were stricken off three times a day every day in seven  year.\"    \"Lord,\" she said, \"for Thy great pain have mercy on my little pain.\"    When she was in great trouble, our Lord said: \"Daughter, I must  needs comfort thee, for now thou hast the right way to heaven. By  this way came I and all My disciples; for now thou shalt know the  better what sorrow and shame I suffered for thy love, and thou shalt  have the more compassion when thou thinkest on My passion.\"    \"O my dear worthy Lord,\" said she, \"these graces Thou shouldest shew  to religious men and to priests.\"    Our Lord said to her again: \"Nay, nay, daughter, for that I love  best that they love not, and that is shames, reproofs, scorns, and  despites of the people; and therefore they shall not have this  grace; for, daughter, he that dreadeth the shames of this world may  not perfectly love God.\"    Here endeth a short treatise of a devout ancress called Margery  Kempe of Lynn          IV.    HERE FOLLOWETH A DEVOUT TREATISE COMPILED BY MASTER WALTER HYLTON OF  THE SONG OF ANGELS      DEAR brother in Christ, I have understanding by thine own speech,  and also by telling of another man, that thou yearnest and desirest  greatly for to have more knowledge and understanding than thou hast  of angel's song and heavenly sound; what it is, and on what wise it  is perceived and felt in a man's soul, and how a man may be siker  that it is true and not feigned; and how it is made by the presence  of the good angel, and not by the inputting of the evil angel. These  things thou wouldest wete of me; but, soothly, I cannot tell thee  for a surety the soothfastness of this matter; nevertheless  somewhat, as me thinketh, I shall shew thee in a short word.    Wete thou well that the end and the sovereignty of perfection  standeth in very onehead[154] of God and of a man's soul by perfect  charity. This onehead, then, is verily made when the mights of the  soul are reformed by grace to the dignity and the state of the first  condition; that is, when the mind is stabled sadly,[155] without  changing and vagation,[156] in God and ghostly things, and when the  reason is cleared from all worldly and fleshly beholdings, and from  all bodily imaginations, figures, and fantasies of creatures, and is  illumined by grace to behold God and ghostly things, and when the  will and the affection is purified and cleansed from all fleshly,  kindly, and worldly love, and is inflamed with brenning love of the  Holy Ghost. This wonderful onehead may not be fulfilled[157]  perfectly, continually, and wholly in this life, for the corruption  of the flesh, but only in the bliss of heaven. Nevertheless, the  nearer that a soul in this present life may come to this onehead,  the more perfect it is. For the more that it is reformed by grace to  the image and the likeness of its Creator here on this wise; the  more joy and bliss shall it have in heaven. Our Lord God is an  endless being without changing, almighty without failing, sovereign  wisdom, light, soothness without error or darkness; sovereign  goodness, love, peace, and sweetness. Then the more that a soul is  united, fastened, conformed, and joined to our Lord, the more stable  and mighty it is, the more wise and clear, good and peaceable,  loving and more virtuous it is, and so it is more perfect. For a  soul that hath by the grace of Jesu, and long travail of bodily and  ghostly exercise, overcome and destroyed concupiscences, and  passions, and unskilful stirrings[158] within itself, and without in  the sensuality, and is clothed all in virtues, as in meekness and  mildness, in patience and softness, in ghostly strength and  righteousness, in continence, in wisdom, in truth, hope and charity;  then it is made perfect, as it may be in this life. Much comfort it  receiveth of our Lord, not only inwardly in its own privy  substance,[159] by virtue of the onehead to our Lord that lieth in  knowing and loving of God, in light and ghostly brenning of Him, in  transforming of the soul in to the Godhead; but also many other  comforts, savours, sweetnesses, and wonderful feelings on sere[160]  or sundry manners, after that our Lord vouchethsafe to visit His  creatures here in earth, and after that the soul profiteth and  waxeth in charity. Some soul, by virtue of charity that God giveth  it, is so cleansed, that all creatures, and all that he heareth, or  seeth, or feeleth by any of his wits, turneth him to comfort and  gladness; and the sensuality receiveth new savour and sweetness in  all creatures.[161] And right as beforetime the likings in the  sensuality were fleshly, vain, and vicious, for the pain of the  original sin; right so now they are made ghostly and clean, without  bitterness and biting of conscience. And this is the goodness of our  Lord, that sith the soul is punished in the sensuality, and the  flesh is partner of the pain, that afterward the soul be comforted  in the sensuality, and the flesh be fellow of joy and comfort with  the soul, not fleshly, but ghostly, as he was fellow in tribulation  and pain. This is the freedom and the lordship, the dignity, and the  worship that a man[162] hath over all creatures, the which dignity  he may so recover by grace here, that every creature savour to him  as it is. And that is, when by grace he seeth, he heareth, he  feeleth only God in all creatures. On this manner of wise a soul is  made ghostly in the sensuality by abundance of charity, that is, in  the substance of the soul. Also, our Lord comforteth a soul by  angel's song. What that song is, it may not be described by no  bodily likeness, for it is ghostly, and above all manner of  imagination and reason. It may be felt and perceived in a soul, but  it may not be shewed. Nevertheless, I shall speak thereof to thee as  me thinketh. When a soul is purified by the love of God, illumined  by wisdom, stabled by the might of God, then is the eye of the soul  opened to behold ghostly things, as virtues and angels and holy  souls, and heavenly things.[163] Then is the soul able because of  cleanness to feel the touching, the speaking of good angels. This  touching and speaking, it is ghostly and not bodily.[164] For when  the soul is lifted and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45456"],[0,"History of Julius Cæsar, Vol. 1 of 2 (#9)"],[1," increased the strength of the aristocracy, which recovered its vigour of  youth without modifying itself, diminished the number of its  adversaries, and increased that of its adherents. The rich and important  plebeian families soon began to mingle with the ancient patrician  families, to share their ideas, their interests, and even their  prejudices; and a learned German historian remarks with justice that  after the abolition of the kingly power there was, perhaps, a greater  number of plebeians in the Senate, but that personal merit, without  birth and fortune, experienced greater difficulty than ever in reaching  preferment.[151]    It is not indeed sufficient, for the application of the state of  society, to study thoroughly its laws, but we must also take into  consideration the influence exercised by the manners of the people. The  laws proclaimed equality and liberty, but the manners left the honours  and preponderance to the upper class. The admission to place was no  longer forbidden to the plebeians, but the election almost always kept  them from it. During fifty-nine years, two hundred and sixty-four  military tribunes replaced the consuls, and of this number only eighteen  were plebeians; although these latter might be candidates for the  consulship, the choice fell generally upon patricians.[152] Marriage  between the two orders had been long placed on a footing of equality,  and yet, in 456, the prejudices of caste were far from being destroyed,  as we learn from the history of the patrician Virginia, married to the  plebeian Volumnius, whom the matrons drove away from the temple of  _Pudicitia patricia_.[153]    The laws protected liberty, but they were rarely executed, as is shown  by the continual renewal of the same regulations. Thus it had been  decided in 305 that the plebiscita should have the force of law, yet in  spite of that it was found necessary to re-enact the same regulation by  the laws Hortensia, in 466, and Maenia, in 468. This last sanctioned also  anew the law Publilia of 415. It was the same with the law of Valerius  Publicola (of the year 246), which authorised an appeal to the people  from the judgments of the magistrates. It appears to have been restored  to vigour by Valerius and Horatius in 305, and again by Valerius Corvus  in 454. And, on this occasion, the great Roman historian exclaims, \"I  can only explain this frequent renewal of the same law by supposing that  the power of some of the great ones always succeeded in triumphing over  the liberty of the people.\"[154] The right of admission to the Senate  was acknowledged in principle, yet no one could enter it without having  obtained a decree of the censor, or exercised a curule  magistracy--favours almost always reserved to the aristocracy. The law  which required a plebeian among the censors remained almost always in  abeyance, and, to become censor, it was generally necessary to have been  consul.    All offices ought to be annual, and yet the tribunes, as well as the  consuls, obtained their re-election several times at short intervals--as  in the instance of Licinius Stolo, re-elected tribune during nine  consecutive years; of Sulpicius Peticus, five times consul (from 390 to  403); of Popilius Laenas and Marcius Rutilus, both four times, the first  from 395 to 406, the second from 397 to 412. The law of 412 came in vain  to require an interval of ten years before becoming again a candidate  for the same magistracy. Several personages were none the less  re-elected before the time required, such as Valerius Corvus, six times  consul (from 406 to 455), and consecutively during the last three years;  and Papirius Cursor, five times (from 421 to 441).    The lives of the citizens were protected by the laws, but public opinion  remained powerless at the assassination of those who had incurred the  hatred of the Senate; and, in spite of the law of the consul Valerius  Publicola, the violent death of the tribune Genucius, or of the rich  plebeian Spurius Melius, was a subject of applause.    The comitia were free, but the Senate had at its disposal either the  veto of the tribunes or the religious scruples of the people. A consul  could prevent the meeting of these assemblies, or cut short all their  deliberations, either by declaring that he was observing the sky, or  that a clap of thunder or some other celestial manifestation had  occurred;[155] and it depended upon the declaration of the augurs to  annul the elections. Moreover, the people in reality were satisfied with  naming the persons on whom they wished to confer the magisterial  offices, for, to enter upon their functions, the consuls and the  praetors had to submit their powers to the sanction of the curiae (_lex  curiata de imperio_).[156] It was thus in the power of the nobility to  reverse the elections which displeased them, a fact which Cicero  explains in the following terms, while presenting this measure in a  light favourable to the people: \"Your ancestors required the suffrages  twice for all magistracies, for, when a curiate law was proposed in  favour of the patrician magistrates, they voted in reality a second time  for the same persons, so that the people, if they repented of their  choice, had the power of abandoning it.\"[157]    The dictatorship was also a lever left in the hands of the nobility to  overthrow oppositions and influence the comitia. The dictator was never  elected, but appointed by a consul.[158] In the space of only twenty-six  years, from 390 to 416, there were eighteen dictators.    The Senate remained, therefore, all powerful in spite of the victory of  the plebeians, for, independently of the means placed at its disposal,  it was in its power to elude the plebiscita, the execution of which was  entrusted to it. If the influence of a predominant class sobered the use  of political liberty, the laws presented a still greater curb on  individual liberty. Thus, not only all the members of the family were  subjected to the absolute authority of the head, but each citizen was  obliged further to obey a multitude of rigorous obligations.[159] The  censor watched over the purity of marriages, the education of children,  the treatment of slaves and clients, and the cultivation of the  lands.[160] \"The Romans did not believe,\" says Plutarch, \"that each  individual ought to be allowed the liberty to marry, to have children,  to choose his walk in life, to give festivities, or even to follow his  desires and tastes, without undergoing a previous inspection and  judgment.\"[161]    The condition of Rome then bore a great resemblance to that of England  before its electoral reform. For several centuries, the English  Constitution was vaunted as the palladium of liberty, although then, as  at Rome, birth and fortune were the unique source of honours and power.  In both countries the aristocracy, master of the elections by  solicitation, money, or _rotten boroughs_, caused, as the patricians at  Rome, the members of the nobility to be elected to parliament, and no  one was citizen in either of the two countries without the possession of  wealth. Nevertheless, if the people, in England, had no part in the  direction of affairs, they boasted justly, before 1789, a liberty which  shone brightly in the middle of the silentious atmosphere of the  Continental states. The disinterested observer does not examine if the  scene where grave political questions are discussed is more or less  vast, or if the actors are more or less numerous: he is only struck by  the grandeur of the spectacle. Thus, far be from us the intention of  blaming the nobility, any more in Rome than in England, for having  preserved its preponderance by all the means which laws and habits  placed at its disposal. The power was destined to remain with the  patricians as long as they showed themselves worthy of it; and, it  cannot but be acknowledged, without their perseverance in the same  policy, without that elevation of views, without that severe and  inflexible virtue, the distinguishing character of the aristocracy, the  work of Roman civilisation would not have been accomplished.    At the beginning of the fifth century, the Republic, consolidated, is  going to gather the fruit of the many efforts it has sustained. More  united henceforward, in the interior, the Romans will turn all their  energy towards the conquest of Italy, but it will require nearly a  century to realise it. Always stimulated by their institutions, always  restrained by an intelligent aristocracy, they will furnish the  astonishing example of a people preserving, in the name of liberty and  in the midst of agitation, the immobility of a system which will render  them masters of the world.          CHAPTER III.    CONQUEST OF ITALY.    (From 416 to 488.)      [Sidenote: Description of Italy.]    I. Ancient Italy did not comprise all the territory which has for its  natural limits the Alps and the sea. What is called the continental  part, or the great plain traversed by the Po, which extends between the  Alps, the Apennines, and the Adriatic, was separated from it. This  plain, and part of the mountains on the coasts of the Mediterranean,  formed Liguria, Cisalpine Gaul, and Venetia. The peninsula, or Italy  proper, was bounded, on the north, by the Rubicon, and, probably, by the  lower course of the Arno;[162] on the west, by the Mediterranean; on the  east, by the Adriatic; on the south, by the Ionian Sea. (See the Maps,  No. 1 and No. 2.)    [Illustration: GENERAL MAP OF ANCIENT ITALY.]    The Apennines traverse Italy in its whole length. They begin where the  Alps end, near Savona, and their chain proceeds, continually rising in  elevation, as far as the centre of the peninsula. Mount Velino is their  culminating point, and from thence the Apennines continue decreasing in  height, until they reach the extremity of the kingdom of Naples. In  the northern region they approach the Adriatic; but, "]]]
