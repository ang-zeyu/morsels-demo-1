Perhaps some magic potion was mingled with  the cheese or bread that she was laying on the table. It was an atmosphere  of feverish and delirious credulity. The pagan madness got the better of  the Christians themselves. Augustin, who had lived in this atmosphere, will  later find considerable trouble in maintaining his strong common sense amid  such an overflow of marvels.    For the moment, the fantasy of tales filled him with at least as much  enthusiasm as the supernatural. At Madaura he lived in a miraculous world,  where everything charmed his senses and his mind, and everything stimulated  his precocious instinct for Beauty.    More than Thagaste, no doubt, Madaura bore the marks of the building  genius of the Romans. Even to-day their descendants, the Italians, are the  masons of the world, after having been the architects. The Romans were the  building nation above all others. They it was who raised and established  towns upon the same model and according to the same ideal as an oration  or a poem. They really invented the house, _mansio_, not only the shelter  where one lives, but the building which itself lives, which triumphs over  years and centuries, a huge construction ornamental and sightly, existing  as much--and perhaps more--for the delight of the eyes as for usefulness.  The house, the _Town-with-deep-streets_, perfectly ordered, were a great  matter of amazement for the African nomad--he who passes and never settles  down anywhere. He hated them, doubtless, as the haunts of the soldier and  the publican, his oppressors, but he also regarded them with admiration  mixed with jealousy as the true expression of a race which, when it entered  a country, planted itself for eternity, and claimed to join magnificence  and beauty to the manifestation of its strength. The Roman ruins which  are scattered over modern Algeria humiliate ourselves by their pomp--us  who flatter ourselves that we are resuming the work of the Empire and  continuing its tradition. They are a permanent reproach to our mediocrity,  a continual incitement to grandeur and beauty. Of course, the Roman  architecture could not have had on Augustin, this still unformed young  African, the same effect as it has to-day on a Frenchman or a man from  Northern Europe. But it is certain that it formed, without his knowledge,  his thought and his power of sensation, and extended for him the lessons of  the Latin rhetoricians and grammarians.    All that was not exactly very Christian. But from these early school years  Augustin got further and further away from Christianity, and the examples  he had under his eyes, at Madaura were hardly likely to strengthen him  in his faith. It was hardly an edifying atmosphere there for a Catholic  youth who had a lively imagination, a pleasure-loving temperament, and who  liked pagan literature. The greatest part of the population were pagans,  especially among the aristocrats. The Decurions continued to preside at  festivals in honour of the old idols.    These festivals were frequent. The least excuse was taken to engarland  piously the doors of houses with branches, to bleed the sacrificial pig,  or slaughter the lamb. In the evening, squares and street corners were  illuminated. Little candles burned on all the thresholds. During the  mysteries of Bacchus, the town councillors themselves headed the popular  rejoicings. It was an African carnival, brutal and full of colour. People  got tipsy, pretended they were mad. For the sport of the thing, they  assaulted the passers and robbed them. The dull blows on tambourines, the  hysterical and nasal preludes of the flutes, excited an immense elation, at  once sensual and mystic. And all quieted down among the cups and leather  flagons of wine, the grease and meats of banquets in the open air. Even in  a country as sober as Africa, the pagan feasts were never much else than  excuses for gorging and orgies. Augustin, who after his conversion had only  sarcasms for the carnival of Madaura, doubtless went with the crowd, like  many other Christians. Rich and influential people gave the example. There  was danger of annoying them by making a group apart. And then, there was no  resisting the agreeableness of such festivals.    Perhaps he was even brought to these love-feasts by those in whose charge  he was. For, in fact, to whom had he been entrusted? Doubtless to some  host of Patricius, a pagan like himself. Or did he lodge with his master,  a grammarian, who kept a boarding-house for the boys? Almost all these  schoolmasters were pagan too. Is it wonderful that the Christian lessons  of Monnica and the nurses at Thagaste became more and more blurred in  Augustin's mind? Many years after, an old Madaura grammarian, called  Maximus, wrote to him in a tone of loving reproach: \"Thou hast drawn away  from us\"--_a secta nostra deviasti_. Did he wish to hint that at this time  Augustin had glided into paganism? Nothing is more unlikely. He himself  assures us that the name of Christ remained always \"graven on his heart.\"  But while he was at Madaura he lived indifferently with pagans and  Christians.    Besides that, the teaching he got was altogether pagan in tone. No doubt he  picked out, as he always did, the subjects which suited him. Minds such as  his fling themselves upon that which is likely to nourish them: they throw  aside all the rest, or suffer it very unwillingly. Thus Augustin never  wavered in his dislike for Greek: he was a poor Greek scholar. He detested  the Greeks by instinct. According to Western prejudice, these men of  the East were all rascals or amusers. Augustin, as a practical African,  always regarded the Greeks as vain, discoursing wits. In a word, they  were not sincere people whom it would be safe to trust. The entirely  local patriotism of the classical Greek authors further annoyed this Roman  citizen who was used to regard the world as his country: he thought them  very narrow-minded to take so much interest in the history of some little  town. As for him, he looked higher and farther. It must be remembered that  in the second half of the fourth century the Greek attitude, broadened and  fully conscious of itself, set itself more and more against Latinism, above  all, politically. There it lay, a hostile and impenetrable block before the  Western peoples. And here was a stronger reason for a Romanized African to  dislike the Greeks.    So he painfully construed the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_, very cross at the  difficulties of a foreign language which prevented him from grasping the  plots of the fine, fabulous narratives. There were, however, abridgments  used in the schools, a kind of summaries of the Trojan War, written by  Latin grammarians under the odd pseudonyms of Dares the Phrygian and Dictys  of Crete. But these abridgments were very dry for an imagination like  Augustin's. He much preferred the _AEneid_, the poem admired above all  by the Africans, on account of the episode devoted to the foundation of  Carthage. Virgil was his passion. He read and re-read him continually;  he knew him by heart. To the end of his life, in his severest writings,  he quoted verses or whole passages out of his much-loved poet. Dido's  adventure moved him to tears. They had to pluck the book out of his hands.    Now the reason is that there was a secret harmony between Virgil's soul and  the soul of Augustin. Both were gracious and serious. One, the great poet,  and one, the humble schoolboy, they both had pity on the Queen of Carthage,  they would have liked to save her, or at any rate to mitigate her sadness,  to alter a little the callousness of AEneas and the harshness of the Fates.  But think of it! Love is a divine sickness, a chastisement sent by the  gods. It is just, when all's said, that the guilty one should endure her  agony to the very end. And then, such very great things are going to arise  out of this poor love! Upon it depends the lot of two Empires. What counts  a woman before Rome and Carthage? Besides, she was bound to perish: the  gods had decreed it.... There was in all that a concentrated emotion, a  depth of sentiment, a religious appeal which stirred Augustin's heart,  still unaware of itself. This obedience of the Virgilian hero to the  heavenly will, was already an adumbration of the humility of the future  Christian.    Certainly, Augustin did not perceive very plainly in these turbid years  of his youth the full religious significance of Virgil's poem. Carried  away by his headstrong nature, he yielded to the heart-rending charm of  the romantic story: he lived it, literally, with the heroine. When his  schoolmasters desired him to elaborate the lament of the dying Queen Dido  in Latin prose, what he wrote had a veritable quiver of anguish. Without  the least defence against lust and the delusions of the heart, he spent  intellectually and in a single outburst all the strength of passion.    He absorbed every love-poem with the eagerness of a participating soul. If  he took pleasure in the licentiousness of Plautus and Terence, if he read  delightfully those comedies wherein the worst weaknesses are excused and  glorified, I believe that he took still more pleasure in the Latin Elegiacs  who present without any shame the romantic madness of Alexandrine love.  For what sing these poets even to weariness, unless it be that no one can  resist the Cyprian goddess, that life has no other end but love? Love for  itself, to love for the sake of loving--there is the constant subject of  these sensualists, of Catullus, Propertius, Tibullus, Ovid. After the story  of Dido, the youthful reader was ravished by the story of Ariadne, even  more disturbing, because no remorse modifies the frenzy of it. He read:        _Now while the careless hero flees, beating the wave with his      and casting to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9090"],[0,"Germania and Agricola (#9)"],[1,"periculosus, 3. sub Trajano in honorem Agricolae repetitus a  Tacito, qui non eloquentiam, at pietatem pollicetur. 4.

Clarorum virorum facta moresque posteris tradere, antiquitus usitatum,  ne nostris quidem temporibus quanquam incuriosa suorum aetas omisit,  quotiens magna aliqua ac nobilis virtus vicit ac supergressa est vitium  parvis magnisque civitatibus commune, ignorantiam recti et invidiam. Sed  apud priores, ut agere digna memoratu pronum magisque in aperto erat, ita  celeberrimus quisque ingenio ad prodendam virtutis memoriam, sine gratia  aut ambitione, bonae tantum conscientiae pretio ducebatur. Ac plerique  suam ipsi vitam narrare fiduciam potius morum, quam arrogantiam arbitrati  sunt: nec id Rutilio et Scauro citra fidem aut obtrectationi fuit: adeo  virtutes iisdem temporibus optime aestimantur, quibus facillime  gignuntur. At nunc narraturo mihi vitam defuncti hominis, venia opus  fuit: quam non petissem incursaturus tam saeva et infesta virtutibus  tempora.    II. Legimus, cum Aruleno Rustico Paetus Thrasea, Herennio Senecioni  Priscus Helvidius laudati essent, capitale fuisse: neque in ipsos modo  auctores, sed in libros quoque eorum saevitum, delegato triumviris  ministerio, ut monumenta clarissimorum ingeniorum in comitio ac foro  urerentur. Scilicet illo igne vocem populi Romani et libertatem senatus  et conscientiam generis humani aboleri arbitrabantur, expulsis insuper  sapientiae professoribus atque omni bona arte in exilium acta, ne quid  usquam honestum occurreret. Dedimus profecto grande patientiae  documentum: et sicut vetus aetas vidit, quid ultimum in libertate esset,  ita nos, quid in servitute, adempto per inquisitiones et loquendi  audiendique commercio. Memoriam quoque ipsam cum voce perdidissemus, si  tam in nostra potestate esset oblivisci, quam tacere.    III. Nunc demum redit animus: et quanquam primo statim beatissimi saeculi  ortu Nerva Caesar res olim dissociabiles miscuerit, principatum ac  libertatem, augeatque quotidie felicitatem imperii Nerva Trajanus, nec  spem modo ac votum securitas publica, sed ipsius voti fiduciam ac robur  assumpserit; natura tamen infirmitatis humanae tardiora sunt remedia,  quam mala; et, ut corpora nostra lente augescunt, cito exstinguuntur, sic  ingenia studiaque oppresseris facilius, quam revocaveris. Subit quippe  etiam ipsius inertiae dulcedo: et invisa primo desidia postremo amatur.  Quid, si per quindecim annos, grande mortalis aevi spatium, multi  fortuitis casibus, promptissimus quisque saevitia principis  interciderunt? Pauci, et, ut ita dixerim, non modo aliorum, sed etiam  nostri superstites sumus, exemptis e media vita tot annis, quibus juvenes  ad senectutem, senes prope ad ipsos exactae aetatis terminos per  silentium venimus. Non tamen pigebit vel incondita ac rudi voce memoriam  prioris servitutis ac testimonium praesentium bonorum composuisse. Hic  interim liber honori Agricolae soceri mei destinatus, professione  pietatis aut laudatus erit aut excusatus.    IV. Cnaeus Julius Agricola, veteri et illustri Forojuliensium colonia  ortus, utrumque avum procuratorem Caesarum habuit: quae equestris  nobilitas est. Pater Julius Graecinus, senatorii ordinis, studio  eloquentiae sapientiaeque notus, iisque ipsis virtutibus iram Caii  Caesaris meritus: namque M. Silanum accusare jussus et, quia abnuerat,  interfectus est. Mater Julia Procilla fuit, rarae castitatis: in hujus  sinu indulgentiaque educatus, per omnem honestarum artium cultum  pueritiam adolescentiamque transegit. Arcebat eum ab illecebris  peccantium, praeter ipsius bonam integramque naturam, quod statim  parvulus sedem ac magistram studiorum Massiliam habuit, locum Graeca  comitate et provinciali parsimonia mistum ac bene compositum. Memoria  teneo solitum ipsum narrare, se in prima juventa studium philosophiae  acrius, ultra quam concessum Romano ac senatori, hausisse, ni prudentia  matris incensum ac flagrantem animum coercuisset. Scilicet sublime et  erectum ingenium pulchritudinem ac speciem excelsae magnaeque gloriae  vehementius, quam caute, appetebat: mox mitigavit ratio et aetas:  retinuitque, quod est difficillimum, ex sapientia modum.    V. Prima castrorum rudimenta in Britannia Suetonio Paullino, diligenti ac  moderato duci, approbavit, electus, quem contubernio aestimaret. Nec  Agricola licenter more juvenum, qui militiam in lasciviam vertunt, neque  segniter ad voluptates et commeatus titulum tribunatus et inscitiam  retulit: sed noscere provinciam, nosci exercitui, discere a peritis,  sequi optimos, nihil appetere jactatione, nihil ob formidinem recusare,  simulque et anxius et intentus agere. Non sane alias exercitatior  magisque in ambiguo Britannia fuit: trucidati veterani, incensae  coloniae, intercepti exercitus; tum de salute, mox de victoria,  certavere. Quae cuncta, etsi consiliis ductuque alterius agebantur ac  summa rerum et recuperatae provinciae gloria in ducem cessit, artem et  usum et stimulos addidere juveni; intravitque animum militaris gloriae  cupido ingrata temporibus, quibus sinistra erga eminentes interpretatio,  nec minus periculum ex magna fama, quam ex mala.    VI. Hinc ad capessendos magistratus in urbem digressus, Domitiam  Decidianam, splendidis natalibus ortam, sibi junxit; idque matrimonium ad  majora nitenti decus ac robur fuit; vixeruntque mira concordia, per  mutuam caritatem et invicem se anteponendo: nisi quod in bona uxore tanto  major laus, quanto in mala plus culpae est. Sors quaesturae provinciam  Asiam, proconsulem Salvium Titianum dedit: quorum neutro corruptus est;  quanquam et provincia dives ac parata peccantibus, et proconsul in omnem  aviditatem pronus, quantalibet facilitate redempturus esset mutuam  dissimulationem mali. Auctus est ibi filia, in subsidium simul et  solatium: nam filium ante sublatum brevi amisit. Mox inter quaesturam ac  tribunatum plebis atque etiam ipsum tribunatus annum quiete et otio  transiit, gnarus sub Nerone temporum, quibus inertia pro sapientia fuit.  Idem praeturae tenor et silentium; nec enim jurisdictio obvenerat: ludos  et inania honoris medio rationis atque abundantiae duxit, uti longe a  luxuria, ita famae propior. Tum electus a Galba ad dona templorum  recognoscenda, diligentissima conquisitione fecit, ne cujus alterius  sacrilegium respublica, quam Neronis sensisset.    VII. Sequens annus gravi vulnere animum domumque ejus afflixit: nam  classis Othoniana, licenter vaga, dum Intemelios (Liguriae pars est)  hostiliter populatur, matrem Agricolae in praediis suis interfecit:  praediaque ipsa et magnam patrimonii partem diripuit, quae causa caedis  fuerat. Igitur ad solemnia pietatis profectus Agricola, nuntio affectati  a Vespasiano imperii deprehensus ac statim in partes transgressus est.  Initia principatus ac statim urbis Mucianus regebat, juvene admodum  Domitiano et ex paterna fortuna tantum licentiam usurpante. Is missum ad  delectus agendos Agricolam integreque ac strenue versatum, vicesimae  legioni, tarde ad sacramentum transgressae; praeposuit, ubi decessor  seditiose agere narrabatur: quippe legatis quoque consularibus nimia ac  formidolosa erat. Nec legatus praetorius ad cohibendum potens, incertum,  suo an militum ingenio: ita successor simul et ultor electus, rarissima  moderatione maluit videri invenisse bonos, quam fecisse.    VIII. Praeerat tunc Britanniae Vettius Bolanus placidius, quam feroci  provincia dignum est: temperavit Agricola vim suam ardoremque compescuit,  ne incresceret; peritus obsequi eruditusque utilia honestis miscere.  Brevi deinde Britannia consularem Petilium Cerialem accepit. Habuerunt  virtutes spatium exemplorum. Sed primo Cerialis labores modo et  discrimina, mox"]]]
