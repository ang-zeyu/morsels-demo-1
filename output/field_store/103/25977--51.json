FORCING A WAY      How many strive to force a way    Where none can go save those who pay,    To verdant plains of soft delight    The homage of the silent night,    When countless stars from pole to pole    Around the earth unceasing roll    In roseate shadow's silvery hue,    Shine forth and gild the morning dew.      And must we really part for good,    But meet again here where we've stood?    No more delightful trysting-place,    We've watched sweet Nature's smiling face.    No more the landscape's lovely brow,    Exchange our mutual breathing vow.    Then should the twilight draw around    No loving interchange of sound.      Less for renown than innate love,    These to my wish must recreant prove;    Nor whilst an impulse here remain,    Can ever hope the soul to gain;    For memory scanning all the past,    Relaxes her firm bonds at last,    And gives to candor all the grace    The heart can in its temple trace.                              _Anonymous_.

JOHN JONES      _At the Piano_      I      Love me and leave me; what love bids retrieve me? can June's fist         grasp May?    Leave me and love me; hopes eyed once above me like spring's         sprouts, decay;    Fall as the snow falls, when summer leaves grow false--cards         packed for storm's play!

III      Ah, how can fear sit and hear as love hears it grief's heart's         cracked grate's screech?    Chance lets the gate sway that opens on hate's way and shews on         shame's beach    Crouched like an imp sly change watch sweet love's shrimps lie, a         toothful in each.      IV      Time feels his tooth slip on husks wet from Truth's lip, which         drops them and grins--    Shells where no throb stirs of life left in lobsters since joy         thrilled their fins--    Hues of the pawn's tail or comb that makes dawn stale, so red for         our sins!      V      Leaves love last year smelt now feel dead love's tears melt--flies         caught in time's mesh!    Salt are the dews in which new time breeds new sin, brews blood         and stews flesh;    Next year may see dead more germs than this weeded and reared them         afresh.      Old times left perish, new time to cherish; life just shifts its         tune;    As, when the day dies, half afraid, eyes the growth of the moon;    Love me and save me, take me or waive me; death takes one so soon!                              _A.C. Swinburne_.          _THE OWL AND THE PUSSY-CAT_      The Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea        In a beautiful pea-green boat:    They took some honey, and plenty of money        Wrapped up in a five-pound note.    The Owl looked up to the stars above,        And sang to a small guitar,    \"Oh, lovely Pussy, oh, Pussy, my love,        What a beautiful Pussy you are,                You are,                You are!        What a beautiful Pussy you are!\"      Pussy said to the Owl, \"You elegant fowl,        How charmingly sweet you sing!    Oh, let us be married; too long we have tarried:        But what shall we do for a ring?\"    They sailed away for a year and a day,        To the land where the bong-tree grows;    And there in the wood a Piggy-wig stood,        With a ring at the end of his nose,                His nose,                His nose,        With a ring at the end of his nose.      \"Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling        Your ring?\" Said the Piggy, \"I will.\"    So they took it away and were married next day        By the Turkey who lives on the hill.    They dined on mince and slices of quince,        Which they ate with a runcible spoon;    And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,        They danced by the light of the moon,                The moon,                The moon,        They danced by the light of the moon.                              _Edward Lear_.

These hamlets, situated in the quiet valleys and  shaded glens, alternated with extensive fields and orchards exuberant with  fertility.    Speeding along on the wavy surface of the lake, we gained sight of the  breakwater of _Sand Beach_ when the noon-tide of the day had not yet  arrived.    We first visited the village of Sand Beach, and returned at nightfall to  the breakwater, which is five miles distant from the former; here the  yacht was cabled to the dock. Near our halting place there stood a lofty  tower, whose illuminating apparatus threw a radiant, vari-colored light on  the dark surface of Lake Huron.    Upon expressing a desire to visit the Light Tower, Mr. James, who never  left any of our wishes unfulfilled, immediately made arrangements with the  keeper; and, accordingly, we were invited to intrust ourselves to his  guidance.    He informed us that the structure rested on a foundation consisting of a  concrete mass, nine feet below the water line. Having ascended four  flights of iron-wrought winding stairs, we reached the top of the circular  structure; it having a diameter of twenty-four feet at its base, and  rising to an elevation of fifty-seven feet.    With great interest we inspected the revolving lights, exhibiting an  ingenious piece of machinery, the invention of Finisterre and Barren in  Paris, and representing a value of $1,800. This apparatus for rotating  lamps is far superior to that for a fixed light.    The characteristic of the latter is to constantly illuminate the whole  horizon, requiring all the rays to fall simultaneously on the navigable  track, whereas the demands made of a revolving light, are not nearly so  great; only each point of the horizon being lighted at successive periods.    When the dark intervals occur, the rays from the flame which are then  pointing toward the obscure spaces, have their direction so altered  laterally as to pass into the adjoining bright places; and so increase the  power of the luminous flashes. A revolving light, though supplied by a  flame of the same strength as a fixed, will thus necessarily be raised to  a higher degree; for it does not lose its power by diffusing the rays  constantly over the whole horizon, but gathers them up into a number of  separate beams of greater intensity.    The lights made to revolve by means of clockwork, were fed with mineral  oil, a refined kerosine; and the refraction was caused by highly polished  metallic reflectors.    This visit to the Sand Beach Beacon was quite instructive; since we viewed  there a practical application of an important principle in optics, based  on the reflection of light.    On Wednesday morning, the first beams of the new-born day had just  appeared, when the yacht continued her voyage on Lake Huron. After a  course of nearly twenty-two miles, we approached _Saginaw Bay_--the  largest indentation on the western lake shore--comprising a width of  thirty miles and a length of sixty miles.    The passage across this bay, feared by many experienced navigators on  account of the heavy ground swell, did not give us any cause for anxiety  at first. Gradually, however, the sea became quite rough, and the enraged  waves dashed their spray pearls even upon the deck of our sailing home.       \"The soft, wild waves, that rush and leap,      Sing one song from the hoary deep:      The south wind knows its own refrain,      As it speeds the cloud o'er heaven's blue main.\"    The strong breeze springing up in the forenoon, increased at midday. A  line of low waves, first creeping sinuously into the bay, and tossing  their snowy crests like troops of wild steeds, rolled higher and higher  with the noise of many waters; and to escape the wrath of the angry sea,  we stopped at the harbor of _Tawas City_, located near the northern  extremity of Saginaw Bay. It is a thriving country town, with about 1,000  inhabitants, largely engaged in lumber trade.    The wind continued to lash the fierce billows during the day until  evening; so we decided to remain in Tawas City until the dawn of the next  morning.    Guided by the pale light of another aurora, we resumed our voyage, finding  the surface of Lake Huron still in uproar.    During this forenoon, we had occasion to witness a prospect quite novel to  us. Glancing to our left, on Michigan's sylvan shore, we saw the bickering  flames of a ravaging forest fire; dyeing all the surrounding air and  landscape crimson, while dense clouds of smoke hung over the burning land  like a pall upon which the sun-rays were reflected with weird effect. It  was, indeed, an unusual sight, exhibiting strange beauty and splendor.    In a short time we experienced the disagreeable consequences of this  conflagration in the woodlands, caused by the extreme dryness prevailing  in these regions for several weeks. For, as we reached _Alpena_ in  Michigan, at about noonday, we found the atmosphere completely saturated  with smoke, and intermixed with particles of burnt material.    The reader can easily imagine that this impure air had a very unpleasant  effect upon our eyes, irritating them so as to materially interfere with  our comfort. This was the reason why we did not duly appreciate the  attractions of Alpena, a town with about 12,500 inhabitants, regularly  laid out with nice, broad streets, containing many handsome buildings and  large stores.    We had an ardent desire to bid farewell to the city as quick as possible;  wherefore our captain received the order from Mr. James to guide the yacht  forward on her course, even before the dawning of the next day, if such an  early departure could be effected with safety.    In compliance with these commands, we were on our way long ere the blush  of day tinged the eastern sky. At first, disregarding the smoke and mist  which became denser every minute, our navigator was soon aware that       \"So thick a haze o'erspreads the sky,      He cannot see the sun on high:      On deck the captain takes his stand,      So dull it is, he sees no land.      'Dear me,' he says, 'I know no more      How far away we are from shore.'\"    The fact is--that on account of the dense pall of smoke and mist,  overshadowing everything--our pilot lost his reckoning, and only kept the  yacht slowly moving through the water until we could find our way, when  suddenly--we ran aground upon a rocky ledge, causing us all great  consternation.       \"No stir in the air, no stir in the sea,      The ship was as still as she might be.      Her shaft and screw received no shock.      Her keel was steady on a rock.\"    Having lost all presence of mind, our pilot, without any meditation,  abandoned the yacht in one of the small boats, for the purpose of  obtaining assistance from the unknown shore. Before we were conscious of  his proceedings, he had disappeared through fume and haze. Almost  instantaneously we detected that the mariner's compass had vanished with  him.    Thus, we were destitute of the most important instrument for navigation.  Wishing to give our deserter opportunity to find his way back to us, we  caused the whistle to resound at short intervals.    This interesting adventure was, of course, thoroughly discussed. We were  all convinced that the unforeseen event might turn into a perilous one,  should a wind arise to roughen the surface of the water.    Our conversation was interrupted by an involuntary cry of pleasure which  burst from the lips of Miss Campbell, whose keen eyes had revealed to her  quite an uncommon spectacle in the hazy distance. Following her direction,  we spied, through the fluctuating light of the foggy morning, the outlines  of a steadfast boat speeding along on the calm sea. Eight oars, managed  with the accuracy of clockwork by eight strong and skillful hands, were  hurrying toward our rock-bound craft.    As the shape and dimensions of the capable boat became discernible, it was  evident she belonged to the United States Life-Saving Service, coming to  our rescue. This conjecture was correct, for the robust crew soon lay  alongside of us; which was a matter of intense relief to the whole party.    With their assistance, the yacht was soon afloat again; and, guided by the  Thunder Bay crew, we sailed to a favorable place of anchorage between  Sugar and Gull Islands. Here the yacht remained to await our fugitive  pilot, who was restored to us by the kind services of the life-saving  crew, a few hours afterwards.    We were informed that we had been aground two miles from the shore, in the  vicinity of Thunder Bay Lights on _Gull Island Ledge_.    During a heavy shower in the afternoon, we received a visit from several  very pleasant ladies, relatives to the captain of the Thunder Bay  life-saving service.    When expressing our regret that their excursion was not favored by  pleasanter weather, they assured us they were only too glad to view the  tremulous skeins of rain refresh the languishing earth. In fact, this  rainfall was a duplicated blessing, as it not only cleared the atmosphere  from its smoky shroud but helped to check the ravages of the extensive  forest conflagration, then threatening the city of Alpena with  destruction.    An awakened breeze, which had freshened since the violent shower, caused  our floating home to roll considerably.    Not desirous of being rudely tossed by the wanton billows, we weighed  anchor and returned to Alpena, the only safe harbor within reach before  sunset.    Early the next day we continued our voyage on Lake Huron, entering its  northern portion, which differs greatly from the nature of its southern  shore.    The northern and northeastern coasts are mostly composed of sand- and  limestones. Where metamorphic rocks are found, the"]]]
