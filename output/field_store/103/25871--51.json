And all men, young and old, within the house and city of the King  were glad at this alliance, and called down blessings upon Rustem.    Now Rustem, when he was alone with the Peri-faced, took from his arm an  onyx that was known unto all the world. And he gave it to her, and said:    \"Cherish this jewel, and if Heaven cause thee to give birth unto a  daughter, fasten it within her locks, and it will shield her from evil;  but if it be granted unto thee to bring forth a son, fasten it upon his  arm, that he may wear it like his father. And he shall be strong as  Keriman, of stature like unto Saum the son of Neriman, and of grace of  speech like unto Zal, my father.\"    The Peri-faced, when she had heard these words, was glad in his  presence. But when the day was passed there came in unto them the King  her father, and he told Rustem how that tidings of Rakush were come unto  his ears, and how that the courser would shortly be within the gates.  And Rustem, when he heard it, was filled with longing after his steed,  and when he knew that he was come he hastened forth to caress him. And  with his own hands he fastened the saddle, and gave thanks unto Ormuzd,  who had restored his joy between his hands. Then he knew that the time  to depart was come. And he opened his arms and took unto his heart  Tahmineh the fair of face, and he bathed her cheek with his tears and  covered her hair with kisses. Then he flung him upon Rakush, and the  swift-footed bare him quickly from out of her sight. And Tahmineh was  sorrowful exceedingly, and Rustem too was filled with thoughts as he  turned him back unto Zaboulistan. And he pondered this adventure in his  heart, but to no man did he speak of what he had seen or done.    Now when nine moons had run their course there was born unto Tahmineh a  son in the likeness of his father, a babe whose mouth was filled with  smiles, wherefore men called him Sohrab. And when he numbered but one  month he was like unto a child of twelve, and when he numbered five  years he was skilled in arms and all the arts of war, and when ten years  were rolled above his head there was none in the land that could resist  him in the games of strength. Then he came before his mother and spake  words of daring. And he said:    \"Since I am taller and stouter than my peers, teach unto me my race and  lineage, and what I shall say when men ask me the name of my sire. But  if thou refuse an answer unto my demands, I will strike thee out from  the rolls of the living.\"    When Tahmineh beheld the ardour of her son, she smiled in her spirit  because that his fire was like to that of his father. And she opened her  mouth and said:    \"Hear my words, O my son, and be glad in thine heart, neither give way  in thy spirit to anger. For thou art the offspring of Rustem, thou art  descended from the seed of Saum and Zal, and Neriman was thy forefather.  And since God made the world it hath held none like unto Rustem, thy  sire.\"    Then she showed to him a letter written by the Pehliva, and gave to him  the gold and jewels Rustem had sent at his birth. And she spake and  said:    \"Cherish these gifts with gratitude, for it is thy father who hath sent  them. Yet remember, O my son, that thou close thy lips concerning these  things; for Turan groaneth under the hand of Afrasiyab, and he is foe  unto Rustem the glorious. If, therefore, he should learn of thee, he  would seek to destroy the son for hatred of the sire. Moreover, O my  boy, if Rustem learned that thou wert become a mountain of valour,  perchance he would demand thee at my hands, and the sorrow of thy loss  would crush the heart of thy mother.\"    But Sohrab replied, \"Nought can be hidden upon earth for aye. To all men  are known the deeds of Rustem, and since my birth be thus noble,  wherefore hast thou kept it dark from me so long? I will go forth with  an army of brave Turks and lead them unto Iran, I will cast Kai Kaous  from off his throne, I will give to Rustem the crown of the Kaianides,  and together we will subdue the land of Turan, and Afrasiyab shall be  slain by my hands. Then will I mount the throne in his stead. But thou  shalt be called Queen of Iran, for since Rustem is my father and I am  his son no other kings shall rule in this world, for to us alone  behoveth it to wear the crowns of might. And I pant in longing after the  battlefield, and I desire that the world should behold my prowess. But a  horse is needful unto me, a steed tall and strong of power to bear me,  for it beseemeth me not to go on foot before mine enemies.\"    Now Tahmineh, when she had heard the words of this boy, rejoiced in her  soul at his courage. So she bade the guardians of the flocks lead out  the horses before Sohrab her son. And they did as she had bidden, and  Sohrab surveyed the steeds, and tested their strength like as his father  had done before him of old, and he bowed them under his hand, and he  could not be satisfied. And thus for many days did he seek a worthy  steed. Then one came before him and told of a foal sprung from Rakush,  the swift of foot. When Sohrab heard the tidings he smiled, and bade  that the foal be led before him. And he tested it and found it to be  strong. So he saddled it and sprang upon its back, and cried, saying:    \"Now that I own a horse like thee, the world shall be made dark to  many.\"    Then he made ready for war against Iran, and the nobles and warriors  flocked around him. And when all was in order Sohrab came before his  grandsire and craved his counsel and his aid to go forth into the land  of Iran and seek out his father. And the King of Samengan, when he heard  these wishes, deemed them to be just, and he opened the doors of his  treasures without stint and gave unto Sohrab of his wealth, for he was  filled with pleasure at this boy. And he invested Sohrab with all the  honours of a King, and he bestowed on him all the marks of his good  pleasure.    Meantime a certain man brought news unto Afrasiyab that Sohrab was  making ready an army to fall upon Iran, and to cast Kai Kaous from off  his throne. And he told Afrasiyab how the courage and valour of Sohrab  exceeded words. And Afrasiyab, when he heard this, hid not his  contentment, and he called before him Human and Barman, the doughty.  Then he bade them gather together an army and join the ranks of Sohrab,  and he confided to them his secret purpose, but he enjoined them tell no  man thereof. For he said:    \"Into our hands hath it been given to settle the course of the world.  For it is known unto me that Sohrab is sprung from Rustem the Pehliva,  but from Rustem must it be hidden who it is that goeth out against him,  then peradventure he will perish by the hands of this young lion, and  Iran, devoid of Rustem, will fall a prey into my hands. Then we will  subdue Sohrab also, and all the world will be ours. But if it be written  that Sohrab fall under the hand of Tehemten, then the grief he shall  endure when he shall learn that he hath slain his son will bring him to  the grave for sorrow.\"    So spake Afrasiyab in his guile, and when he had done unveiling his  black heart he bade the warriors depart unto Samengan. And they bare  with them gifts of great price to pour before the face of Sohrab. And  they bare also a letter filled with soft words. And in the letter  Afrasiyab lauded Sohrab for his resolve, and told him how that if Iran  be subdued the world would henceforth know peace, for upon his own head  should he place the crown of the Kaianides; and Turan, Iran, and  Samengan should be as one land.    When Sohrab had read this letter, and saw the gifts and the aid sent out  to him, he rejoiced aloud, for he deemed that now none could withstand  his might. So he caused the cymbals of departure to be clashed, and the  army made them ready to go forth. Then Sohrab led them into the land of  Iran. And their track was marked by desolation and destruction, for they  spared nothing that they passed. And they spread fire and dismay abroad,  and they marched on unstayed until they came unto the White Castle, the  fortress wherein Iran put its trust.    Now the guardian of the castle was named Hujir, and there lived with him  Gustahem the grave, but he was grown old, and could aid no longer save  with his counsels. And there abode also his daughter Gurdafrid, a  warlike maid, firm in the saddle, and practised in the fight. Now when  Hujir beheld from afar a dusky cloud of armed men he came forth to meet  them. And Sohrab, when he saw him, drew his sword, and demanded his  name, and bade him prepare to meet his end. And he taunted him with  rashness that he was come forth thus unaided to stand against a lion.  But Hujir answered Sohrab with taunts again, and vowed that he would  sever his head from his trunk and send it for a trophy unto the Shah.  Yet Sohrab only smiled when he heard these words, and he challenged  Hujir to come near. And they met in combat, and wrestled sore one with  another, and stalwart were their strokes and strong; but Sohrab overcame  Hujir as though he were an infant, and he bound him and sent him captive  unto Human.    But when those within the castle learned that their chief was bound they  raised great lamentation, and their fears were sore. And Gurdafrid, too,  when she learned it, was grieved, but she was ashamed also for the fate  of Hujir. So she took forth burnished mail and clad herself therein, and  she hid her tresses under a helmet of Roum, and she mounted a steed of  battle and came forth before the walls like to a warrior. And she  uttered a cry of thunder, and flung it amid the ranks of Turan, and she  defied the champions to come forth to single combat. And none came, for  they beheld her how she was strong, and they knew not that it was a  woman, and they were afraid. But Sohrab, when he saw it, stepped forth  and said:    \"I will accept thy challenge, and a second prize will fall into "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6628"],[0,"The Life, Crime, and Capture of John Wilkes Booth (#9)"],[1," the  National Hall. He arose from the table at, say eleven o'clock. During  the breakfast, those who watched him say that he was lively, piquant and  self-possessed as ever in his life.    That night the horrible crime thrilled the land. A period of crippled  flight succeeded. Living in swamps, upon trembling hospitality, upon  hopes which sank as he leaned upon them. Booth passed the nights in  perilous route or broken sleep, and in the end went down like a bravo,  but in the eyes of all who read his history, commanding no respect for  his valor, charity for his motive, or sympathy for his sin.    The closing scenes of these terrible days are reserved for a second  paper. Much matter that should have gone into this is retained for the  present.          LETTER IV.    THE ASSASSIN'S DEATH.      Washington, April 28--8 P. M.    A hard and grizzly face overlooks me as I write. Its inconsiderable  forehead is crowned with turning sandy hair, and the deep concave of its  long insatiate jaws is almost hidden by a dense red beard, which can not  still abate the terrible decision of the large mouth, so well sustained  by searching eyes of spotted gray, which roll and rivet one. This is the  face of Lafayette Baker, colonel and chief of the secret service. He has  played the most perilous parts of the war, and is the capturer of the  late President's murderer. The story that I am to tell you, as he and  his trusty dependents told it to me, will be aptly commenced here, where  the net was woven which took the dying life of Wilkes Booth.    When the murder occured, Colonel Baker was absent from Washington, He  returned on the third morning, and was at once besought by Secretary  Stanton to join the hue and cry against the escaped Booth. The sagacious  detective found that nearly ten thousand cavalry, and one-fourth as many  policemen, had been meantime scouring, without plan or compass, the  whole territory of Southern Maryland. They were treading on each other's  heels, and mixing up the thing so confoundedly, that the best place for  the culprits to have gone would have been in the very midst of their  pursuers. Baker at once possessed himself of the little the War  Department had learned, and started immediately to take the usual  detective measures, till then neglected, of offering a reward and  getting out photographs of the suspected ones. He then dispatched a few  chosen detectives to certain vital points, and awaited results.    The first of these was the capture of Atzeroth. Others, like the taking  of Dr. Mudge, simultaneously occured. But the district supected being  remote from the railway routes, and broken by no telegraph station, the  colonel, to place himself nearer the theater of events, ordered an  operator, with the necessary instrument, to tap the wire running to  Point Lookout, near Chappells Point, and send him prompt messages.    The same steamer which took down the operator and two detectives.  brought back one of the same detectives and a negro. This negro, taken  to Colonel Baker's office, stated so positively that he had seen Booth  and another man cross the Potomac in a fishing boat, while he was  looking down upon them from a bank, that the colonel, was at first  skeptical; but when examined the negro answered so readily and  intelligently, recognizing the men from the photographs, that Baker knew  at last that he had the true scent.    Straightway he sent to General Hancock for twenty-five men, and while  the order was going, drew down his coast survey-maps. With that quick  detective intuition amounting almost to inspiration, he cast upon the  probable route and destination of the refugees, as well as the point  where he would soonest strike them. Booth, he knew, would not keep along  the coast, with frequent deep rivers to cross, nor, indeed, in any  direction east of Richmond, where he was liable at any time to cross our  lines of occupation; nor, being lame, could he ride on; horseback, so as  to place himself very far westward of his point of debarkation in  Virginia. But he would travel in a direct course from Bluff point, where  he crossed to Eastern Tennessee, and this would take him through Port  Royal on the Rappahannock river, in time to be intercepted there by the  outgoing cavalry men.    When, therefore, twenty-five men, under one Lieutenant Dougherty,  arrived at his office door, Baker placed the whole under control of his  former lieutenant-colonel, E. J. Conger, and of his cousin, Lieutenant  L. B. Baker--the first of Ohio, the last of New-York--and bade them go  with all dispatch to Belle Plain on the Lower Potomac, there to  disembark, and scour the country faithfully around Port Royal, but not  to return unless they captured their men.    Conger is a short, decided, indomitable, courageous fellow, provincial  in his manners, but fully understanding his business, and collected as a  housewife on Sunday.    Young Baker is large and fine-looking--a soldier, but no policeman--and  he deferred to Conger, very properly, during most of the events  succeeding.    Quitting Washington at 2 o'clock P. M. on Monday, the detectives and  cavalrymen disembarked at Belle Plain, on the border of Stafford county,  at 10 o'clock, in the darkness. Belle Plain is simply the nearest  landing to Fredericksburg, seventy miles from Washington city, and  located upon Potomac creek. It is a wharf and warehouse merely, and here  the steamer John S. Ide stopped and made fast, while the party galloped  off in the darkness. Conger and Baker kept ahead, riding up to  farm-houses and questioning the inmates, pretending to be in search of  the Maryland gentlemen belonging to the party. But nobody had seen the  parties described, and, after a futile ride on the Fredericksburg road,  they turned shortly to the east, and kept up their baffled inquiries all  the way to Port Conway, on the Rappahannock.    On Tuesday morning they presented themselves at the Port Royal ferry,  and inquired of the ferry-man, while he was taking them over in squads  of seven at a time, if he had seen any two such men. Continuing their  inquiries at Port Royal, they found one Rollins a fisherman, who  referred them to a negro named Lucas, as having driven two men a short  distance toward Bowling Green in a wagon. It was found that these men  answered to the description, Booth having a crutch as previously  ascertained.    The day before Booth and Harold had applied at Port Conway for the  general ferry-boat, but the ferryman was then fishing and would not  desist for the inconsiderable fare of only two persons, but to their  supposed good fortune a lot of confederate cavalrymen just then came  along, who threatened the ferryman with a shot in the head if he did not  instantly bring across his craft and transport the entire party. These  cavalrymen were of Moseby's disbanded command, returning from Fairfax  Court House to their homes in Caroline county. Their captain was on his  way to visit a sweetheart at Bowling Green, and he had so far taken  Booth under his patronage, that when the latter was haggling with Lucas  for a team, he offered both Booth and Harold the use of his horse, to  ride and walk alternately.    In this way Lucas was providentially done out of the job, and Booth rode  off toward Bowling Green behind the confederate captain on one and the  same horse.    So much learned, the detectives, with Rollins for a guide, dashed off in  the bright daylight of Tuesday, moving southwestward through the level  plains of Caroline, seldom stopping to ask questions, save at a certain  halfway house, where a woman told them that the cavalry party of  yesterday had returned minus one man. As this was far from  circumstantial, the party rode along in the twilight, and reached  Bowling Green at eleven o'clock in the night.    This is the court-house town of Caroline county--a small and scattered  place, having within it an Ancient tavern, no longer used for other than  lodging purposes; but here they hauled from his bed the captain  aforesaid, and bade him dress himself. As soon as he comprehended the  matter he became pallid and eagerly narrated all the facts in his  possession. Booth, to his knowledge, was then lying at the house of one  Garrett, which they had passed, and Harold had departed the existing day  with the intention of rejoining him.    Taking this captain along for a guide, the worn out horsemen retraced,  though some of the men were so haggard and wasted with travel that they  had to be kicked into intelligence before they could climb to their  saddles. The objects of the chase thus at hand, the detectives, full of  sanguine purpose; hurried the cortege so well along that by 2 o'clock  early morning, all halted at Garrett's gate. In the pale moonlight three  hundred yards from the main road, to the left, a plain old farmhouse  looked grayly through its environing locusts. It was worn and  whitewashed, and two-storied, and its half-human windows glowered down  upon the silent cavalrymen like watching owls, which stood as sentries  over some horrible secret asleep within. The front of this house looked  up the road toward the Rappahannock, but did not face it, and on that  side a long Virginia porch protruded, where, in the summer, among the  honeysuckles, the humming bird flew like a visible odor. Nearest the  main road, against the pallid gable, a single-storied kitchen stood, and  there were three other doors, one opening upon the porch, one in the  kitchen gable, and one in the rear of the farmhouse.    Dimly seen behind, an old barn, high and weather-beaten, faced the  roadside gate, for the house itself lay to the left of its own lane; and  nestling beneath the barn, a few long corn-cribs lay with a cattle shed  at hand. There was not a swell of the landscape anywhere in sight. A  plain dead level contained all the tenements and structures. A worm  fence stretched along the road broken by two battered gate "]]]
