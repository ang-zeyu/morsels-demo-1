It has been well said that the large number of relapsed persons  who are brought to trial year after year proves that thieves ply  their trade as a regular calling; the thief who has once tasted  prison life is sure to return to it.[8]  And again, there are very  few cases in which a man or a woman who has turned thief ceases to  be one.  Whatever the reason may be, as a matter of fact the thief  is rarely or never reformed.  When you can turn an old thief into  an honest worker, you may turn an old fox into a house dog.[9]      [8] _Quarterly Review_, 1871, ``The London Police.''  [9] Thomson, ``The Psychology of Criminals,'' _Journal of Mental  Science_, 1870.        We must, however, read these testimonies of practical men, which  could easily be multiplied, in the light of our distinction  between incorrigible criminals, who are so from their birth, and  such as are made incorrigible by the effect of their prison and  social environment.  The former could scarcely be reduced in  number, whilst the latter could be <p 36>considerably diminished  by the penal alternatives of which I will speak later.    The following statistics of relapse are quoted from Yvern<e!>s,  ``La R<e'>cidive en Europe'' (Paris, 1874):--                                               FRANCE--1826-74.    ITALY--1870.

At the Prisons Congress of Stockholm the following figures were  given for Scotland.  Out of a total of forty-nine relapsed  prisoners, 16 per cent. had relapsed once, 13 per cent. twice or  three times, 6 per cent. four or five times, 6 per cent. from six  to ten times, 5 per cent. from ten to twenty times, 4 per cent.  from twenty to fifty times, and 1 per cent. more than fifty times.    At the meeting of the Social Science Congress, held at Liverpool,  in 1876, Mr. Nugent stated that upwards of 4,107 women had  relapsed four times or oftener, and that many of them were classed  as incorrigible, having been convicted twenty; forty, or fifty  times, whilst one had been convicted 130 times.

But  it is only a question of terms.  He considers that born and  habitual criminals confine themselves almost exclusively to  serious crime, and occasional criminals to minor offences.  And as  the figures which I have given show that precocity and relapse are  even more frequent for minor offences than for crimes, he thinks  that they contradict instead of confirming my conclusions.    The mere seriousness of an act cannot by any means divide the  categories of criminals; for homicide as well as theft, assault  and battery as well as forgery, may be committed, though in  different psychological and social conditions, as easily by born  and habitual criminals as by occasional criminals and criminals of  passion.    Moreover, the figures which I have given show that precocity and  relapse are more frequent in the forms of criminality which, apart  from their gravity, are the common practices of born and habitual  criminals, such as murder, homicide, robbery, rape, &c., whilst  they are far more uncommon, even if they can be said to be  observed at all, in the case of the crimes and offences usually  committed by occasional criminals, such as infanticide, and  certain of the offences mentioned above.      It remains to say something of the occasional criminals, and the  criminals of passion.  <p 39>    The latter are but a variety of the occasional criminals, but  their characteristics are so specific that they may be very  readily distinguished.  In fact Lombroso, in his second edition,  supplementing the observations of Despine and Bittinger, separated  them from other criminals, and classified them according to their  symptoms.  I need only summarise his observations.    In the first place, the criminals who constitute the strongly  marked class of criminals by irresistible impulse are very rare,  and their crimes are almost invariably against the person.  Thus,  out of 71 criminals of passion inquired into by Lombroso, 69 were  homicides, 6 had in addition been convicted of theft, 3 of  incendiarism, and 1 of rape.    It may be shown that they number about 5 per cent. of crimes  against the person.    They are as a rule persons of previous good behaviour, sanguine or  nervous by temperament, of excessive sensibility, unlike born or  habitual criminals, and they are often of a neurotic or epileptoid  temperament, of which their crimes may be, strictly speaking, an  unrecognised consequence.    Frequently they transgress in their youth, especially in the case  of women, under stress of a passion which suddenly spurns  constraint, like anger, or outraged love, or injured honour.  They  are highly emotional before, during, or after the crime, which  they do not commit treacherously, but openly, and often by ill-  chosen methods, the first that present themselves.  Now and then,  however, one encounters criminals of passion who premeditate a  crime, and <p 40>carry it out treacherously, either by reason of  their colder and less impulsive temperament, or as the outcome of  preconceived ideas or a widespread sentiment, in cases where we  have to do with a popular form of lawlessness, such as the  vendetta.    This is why the test of premeditation has no absolute value in  criminal psychology, as a distinction between the born criminal  and the criminal of passion; for premeditation depends especially  on the temperament of the individual, and is exemplified in crimes  committed by both anthropological types.    Amongst other symptoms of the criminal of passion, there is also  the precise motive which leads to a crime complete in itself, and  never as a means of attaining another criminal purpose.    These offenders immediately acknowledge their crime, with  unassumed remorse, frequently so keen that they instantly commit,  or attempt to commit suicide.  When convicted--as they seldom are  by a jury--they are always repentant prisoners, and amend their  lives, or do not become degraded, so that in this way they  encourage superficial observers to affirm as a general fact, and  one possible in all circumstances, that ameliorative effect of  imprisonment which is really a mere illusion in the case of the  far more numerous classes of born and habitual criminals.    In these same offenders we very rarely observe, if at all, the  organic anomalies which create a criminal type.  And even the  psychological characteristics are much slighter in countries where  certain crimes of <p 41>passion are endemic, almost ranking  amongst the customs of the community, like the homicides which  occur in Corsica and Sardinia for the vindication of honour, or  the political assassinations in Russia and Ireland.      The last class is that of occasional criminals, who without any  inborn and active tendency to crime lapse into crime at an early  age through the temptation of their personal condition, and of  their physical and social environment, and who do not lapse into  it, or do not relapse, if these temptations disappear.    Thus they commit those crimes and offences which do not indicate  natural criminality, or else crimes and offences against person or  property, but under personal and social conditions altogether  different from those in which they are committed by born and  habitual criminals.

Shortly after  this, he and his father were on the way to the field to get some hay  when there suddenly arose a heavy shower accompanied by thunder and  lightning. Henry made sport of the roaring elements and mocked God in  the thunder. The next moment, while standing by his father's side, he  was struck by a thunderbolt from heaven. I attended his funeral. The  circumstances of his death made a lasting impression on me.\"    Like many, for whom there is in store a remarkable religious future,  Wilford was called to suffer financial reverses that he might learn  how uncertain are the goods of this world and that he might feel the  full force of that divine fiat: \"Cursed is he that trusteth in riches;  cursed is he that trusteth in man, or maketh flesh his arm.\" He had  earned considerable money while running the flour mill for his Aunt  Helen, but lost much of it by lending it to an unprincipled man,  and by helping others who were unable to repay him. These peculiar  experiences, temporal and spiritual, fortunes and misfortunes,  accidents and trials among people away from his own home filled his  soul with grave reflections and brought him to take a stand relative to  his own future course in life. He was high-minded, had no vices or bad  habits, and his standard of purity and excellence was so high that he  never indulged in light-mindedness or in trifling recreations. To him  they were grievous sins in the sight of God; and he believed with the  Prophet Joseph that they should be eschewed. He was constantly striving  for a higher plane upon which he might firmly plant his feet.    \"I was twenty-three years of age; and in reflecting upon the past, I  became sincerely convinced that there was no real peace of mind or true  happiness except in the service of God and in doing those things which  would meet His approval. As far as my imagination would enable me, I  brought before my mind all the {27} honor, glory, and happiness of the  whole world. I thought of the gold and the wealth of the rich, of the  glory, grandeur, and power of kings, presidents, princes, and rulers. I  thought of the military renown of Alexander, Napoleon, and other great  generals. I cast my mind over the innumerable paths through which the  giddy world travels in search of pleasure and happiness. In summing  up the whole matter in the vision of my mind, I had to exclaim with  Solomon: 'All is vanity of vanities sayeth the preacher.'    \"I could see that within a few years all would end alike in the grave.  I was convinced that no man could enjoy true happiness and obtain that  which would feed the immortal soul, except God was his friend and Jesus  Christ his advocate. I was convinced that man became their friend by  doing the will of the Father, and by keeping His commandments. I made  a firm resolution that from then I would seek the Lord to know His  will, to keep His commandments, and to follow the dictates of His Holy  Spirit. Upon this ground I was determined to stand and to spend my  future life in the maintenance of these convictions.\" It will be here  easily seen that determination which led him through all the subsequent  years of his life to do whatever he did for the glory of God.    In May, 1830, he was employed to run a flour mill for Mr. Samuel  Collins of Collinsville, Connecticut. At first he went to board with  about thirty young men. These being of a worldly turn of mind, he did  not enjoy their influence and therefore took up his residence in the  family of Mr. Dudley D. Sackett.    About this time, under the influence of a religious revival, his  brother Asahel made profession of religion and seemed very devoted.  Wilford became specially anxious to know the will of the Lord. \"I  prayed night and day, and the Lord blest me with much of His spirit.  These began to be the happiest days of my life. I felt that the sun,  moon, and stars; the mountains, hills, and valleys; and that all  creation were united in the praise of the Lord.\"    \"My work in the mill was very light and I passed much of my time in  reading, in meditation, and in prayer. I read the Bible and it was like  a new book to me. I received much light in perusing its sacred pages.  If I was cast down, tried, or {28} tempted, I found in it relief in  connection with the Spirit of God. The religious reformation continued  in Farmington and a number of my relatives were actively engaged in the  service of the Lord according to the best light they had. Among them  were my Uncle Ozem Woodruff and his wife Hannah. They were good people  and I was much attached to them, having lived with them a good deal in  my early life. I enjoyed their society very much.    \"A short distance from the mill was a beautiful island upon the top of  which was a level field covered with flowers. The island was surrounded  by a rapid current of water dashing over the rocks. The banks of the  current were thickly studded by tall, waving pines. I chose this  pleasant retreat on the top of the island as my place of prayer and  supplication. I retired to it many times, both by day and by night and  offered up my soul in prayer to the Lord. I never shall forget the  happy hours I spent alone in mediation and prayer upon that solitary  island. When sitting there alone, there would come to my mind the words  of Robert Pollock:      'In the wide desert where the view was large,    Pleasant were many scenes, but most to me    The solitude of vast extent untouched by hand    Whose nature sowed herself and reaped her crop;    Whose garments were the clouds; whose minstrels, brooks;    Whose lamps, the moon and stars; whose organ choir,    The voice of many waters; whose banquets,    The falling leaves; whose heroes, storms; whose warriors,    Mighty winds; whose lovers, flowers;    Whose orators, the thunderbolt of God;    Whose palaces, the everlasting hills;    Whose ceilings, Heaven's unfathomable blue;    And from whose rocky turrets battled high    Prospects immense spread out on all sides in air,    Lost now between the welkin and the main,    Now walked with hills that slept above the storm.'    \"The Lord blest me with joy and happiness such as I had never before  enjoyed, doubtless because I was living up to the best light I had. I  had no apostle or prophet to teach me the right way; so I had to do the  best I could. In my zeal to promote {29} good, I got up prayer meetings  in our village and prayed for light and knowledge. It was my desire  to receive the ordinances of the gospel, as I could plainly see by  reading the Bible that baptism by immersion was a sacred ordinance. In  my eagerness, yet being ignorant of the holy priesthood and of the true  authority to officiate in the ordinances of eternal life, I requested  the Baptist minister to baptize me. At first he refused because I  told him I would not join his church as it did not harmonize with the  apostolic church which our Savior established. Finally after several  conversations, he baptized me on the 5th of May, 1831. He also baptized  my brother Asahel. This was the first and only gospel ordinance I  sought for until I joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints.\"    Wilford continued with Mr. Collins for less than a year, but left him  with the best feelings. The latter told Wilford that he would always  be welcome at his home, and that as an honorable young man, worthy of  trust, he would cheerfully give him any recommendations he desired.    Wilford held himself aloof from membership in any of the churches. He  visited their meetings and conversed with their ministers. He wanted  to know why there were no more apostles and prophets. He was told that  they were done away with, because they were no longer needed. Such a  statement only intensified his disbelief in sectarian churches.    On one occasion, after praying most earnestly to know about the people  of the Lord, if any such there were on earth, he says: \"The Spirit of  the Lord said unto me: 'Go to my Word and I will there show thee my  will and answer thy prayer.' I opened the Bible promiscuously, praying  the Lord to direct me to that portion of his Word which would answer my  prayer. I opened to the 56th Chapter of Isaiah. I was satisfied it was  in response to my prayer. I felt that the salvation of God was about  to be revealed and His righteousness come forth. I was also satisfied  that I should live to see the people of God gathered. From this time  on until the gospel found me I was contented and felt that I should  trouble myself no more about the churches and the ministers. In our  zeal my brother Azmon and I adopted the worship of the Lord on Saturday  instead of Sunday. I felt that a change from the seventh to the first  day of the week was likely {30} a perversion made by man without  authority from heaven.\"    It was while staying with Mr. Cowles in the spring of 1832 that he saw  for the first time an account of the \"Mormons.\" These were described in  a newspaper article as a new sect claiming to have new revelations and  to be built upon the foundation of prophets and apostles the same as  the ancient Saints. The editor of the newspaper ridiculed the Mormons,  but Wilford was favorably impressed. From that time on he desired to  see these new people; for if they enjoyed the gifts which were bestowed  upon the ancient Saints, they were the very people for whom he was  seeking.    Soon after this he made a settlement with Mr. Cowles and arranged his  affairs with a view of moving to western New York. Of the circumstances  leading up to this change in his life, he writes: \"The spirit that was  upon me day and night said, 'Go to Rhode Island.' My mind was greatly  exercised over the matter for I could not comprehend what it meant. I  went to live with my brother Azmon until our departure for New York.  After saluting him, I said: 'I wonder what the Lord wants of me in  Rhode Island!"]]]
