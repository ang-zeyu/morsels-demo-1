One drop would save my soul, half a drop:  ah, my Christ!--       Ah, rend not my heart for naming of my Christ!       Yet will I call on him:  O, spare me, Lucifer!--       Where is it now? 'tis gone:  and see, where God       Stretcheth out his arm, and bends his ireful brows!       Mountains and hills, come, come, and fall on me,       And hide me from the heavy wrath of God!       No, no!       Then will I headlong run into the earth:       Earth, gape!  O, no, it will not harbour me!       You stars that reign'd at my nativity,       Whose influence hath allotted death and hell,       Now draw up Faustus, like a foggy mist.

O, no end is limited to damned souls!       Why wert thou not a creature wanting soul?       Or why is this immortal that thou hast?       Ah, Pythagoras' metempsychosis, were that true,       This soul should fly from me, and I be chang'd       Unto some brutish beast![174] all beasts are happy,       For, when they die,       Their souls are soon dissolv'd in elements;       But mine must live still to be plagu'd in hell.       Curs'd be the parents that engender'd me!       No, Faustus, curse thyself, curse Lucifer       That hath depriv'd thee of the joys of heaven.            [The clock strikes twelve.]       O, it strikes, it strikes!  Now, body, turn to air,       Or Lucifer will bear thee quick to hell!

In that hour, when cherished illusions of possible safety had all  but vanished, manhood and womanhood aboard the Titanic rose to their  sublimest heights. It was in that crisis of the direst extremity that  many brave women deliberately rejected life and chose rather to remain  and die with the men whom they loved.      DEATH FAILS TO PART MR. AND MRS. STRAUS    \"I will not leave my husband,\" said Mrs. Isidor Straus. \"We are old; we  can best die together,\" and she turned from those who would have forced  her into one of the boats and clung to the man who had been the partner  of her joys and sorrows. Thus they stood hand in hand and heart to  heart, comforting each other until the sea claimed them, united in death  as they had been through a long life.    \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for  his friends.\"    Miss Elizabeth Evans fulfilled this final test of affection laid down  by the Divine Master. The girl was the niece of the wife of Magistrate  Cornell, of New York. She was placed in the same boat with many other  women. As it was about to be lowered away it was found that the craft  contained one more than its full quota of passengers.    The grim question arose as to which of them should surrender her place  and her chance of safety. Beside Miss Evans sat Mrs. J. J. Brown, of  Denver, the mother of several children. Miss Evans was the first to  volunteer to yield to another.      GIRL STEPS BACK TO DOOM    \"Your need is greater than mine,\" said she to Mrs. Brown. \"You have  children who need you, and I have none.\"    So saying she arose from the boat and stepped back upon the deck. The  girl found no later refuge and was one of those who went down with the  ship. She was twenty-five years old and was beloved by all who knew her.    Mrs. Brown thereafter showed the spirit which had made her also  volunteer to leave the boat. There were only three men in the boat  and but one of them rowed. Mrs. Brown, who was raised on the water,  immediately picked up one of the heavy sweeps and began to pull.    In the boat which carried Mrs. Cornell and Mrs. Appleton there were  places for seventeen more than were carried. This too was undermanned  and the two women at once took their places at the oars.    The Countess of Rothes was pulling at the oars of her boat, likewise  undermanned because the crew preferred to stay behind.    Miss Bentham, of Rochester, showed splendid courage. She happened to be  in a life-boat which was very much crowded--so much so that one sailor  had to sit with his feet dangling in the icy cold water, and as time  went on the sufferings of the man from the cold were apparent. Miss  Bentham arose from her place and had the man turn around while she took  her place with her feet in the water.    Scarcely any of the life-boats were properly manned. Two, filled with  women and children, capsized immediately, while the collapsible boats  were only temporarily useful. They soon filled with water. In one boat  eighteen or twenty persons sat in water above their knees for six hours.        {illust. caption =    In the darkness and confusion, punctuated by screams, sobs and curses,  the boats were lowered after being filled with women, children and a  few men. The sketch, drawn from description of eye-witnesses, shows the  lofty side of the stricken vessel and the laden boats descending.    THE LIFE-BOATS BEING LOWERED}      {illust. caption = Copyright by Underwood & Underwood, N. Y.    {illust. caption = Copyright by Underwood & Underwood, N. Y. LIFE-BOATS,  AS SEEN FROM THE CARPATHIA    Photographs taken from the rescue ship as she reached the first boats  carrying the Titanic's sufferers.}        heard it, but have forgotten it. But I saw an order for five pounds  which this man gave to each of the crew of his boat after they got  aboard the Carpathia. It was on a piece of ordinary paper addressed to  the Coutts Bank of England.    \"We called that boat the 'money boat.' It was lowered from the  starboard side and was one of the first off. Our orders were to load the  life-boats beginning forward on the port side, working aft and then back  on the starboard. This man paid the firemen to lower a starboard boat  before the officers had given the order.\"    Whiteley's own experience was a hard one. When the uncoiling rope, which  entangled his feet, threw him into the sea, it furrowed the flesh of  his leg, but he did not feel the pain until he was safe aboard the  Carpathia.    \"I floated on my life-preserver for several hours,\" he said, \"then I  came across a big oak dresser with two men clinging to it. I hung on to  this till daybreak and the two men dropped off. When the sun came up I  saw the collapsible raft in the distance, just black with men. They were  all standing up, and I swam to it--almost a mile, it seemed to me--and  they would not let me aboard. Mr. Lightoller, the second officer, was  one of them.    \"'It's thirty-one lives against yours,, he said, 'you can't come  aboard. There's not room.'\"    \"I pleaded with him in vain, and then I confess I prayed that somebody  might die, so I could take his place. It was only human. And then some  one did die, and they let me aboard.    \"By and by, we saw seven life-boats lashed together, and we were taken  into them.\"      MEN SHOT DOWN    The officers had to assert their authority by force, and three  foreigners from the steerage who tried to force their way in among the  women and children were shot down without mercy.    Robert Daniel, a Philadelphia passenger, told of terrible scenes at  this period of the disaster. He said men fought and bit and struck one  another like madmen, and exhibited wounds upon his face to prove the  assertion. Mr. Daniel said that he was picked up naked from the ice-cold  water and almost perished from exposure before he was rescued. He and  others told how the Titanic's bow was completely torn away by the impact  with the berg.    K. Whiteman, of Palmyra, N. J., the Titanic's barber, was lowering boats  on deck after the collision, and declared the officers on the bridge,  one of them First Officer Murdock, promptly worked the electrical  apparatus for closing the water-tight compartments. He believed the  machinery was in some way so damaged by the crash that the front  compartments failed to close tightly, although the rear ones were  secure.    Whiteman's manner of escape was unique. He was blown off the deck by the  second of the two explosions of the boilers, and was in the water more  than two hours before he was picked up by a raft.    \"The explosions,\" Whiteman said; \"were caused by the rushing in of the  icy water on the boilers. A bundle of deck chairs, roped together, was  blown off the deck with me, and I struck my back, injuring my spine, but  it served as a temporary raft.    \"The crew and passengers had faith in the bulkhead system to save the  ship and we were lowering a collapsible boat, all confident the ship  would get through, when she took a terrific dip forward and the water  swept over the deck and into the engine rooms.    \"The bow went clean down, and I caught the pile of chairs as I was  washed up against the rim. Then came the explosions which blew me  fifteen feet.    \"After the water had filled the forward compartments, the ones at the  stern could not save her, although they did delay the ship's going down.  If it wasn't for the compartments hardly anyone could have got away.\"      A SAD MESSAGE    One of the Titanic's stewards, Johnson by name, carried this message to  the sorrowing widow of Benjamin Guggenheim:    \"When Mr. Guggenheim realized that there was grave danger,\" said the  room steward, \"he advised his secretary, who also died, to dress fully  and he himself did the same. Mr. Guggenheim, who was cool and collected  as he was pulling on his outer garments, said to the steward:--      PREPARED TO DIE BRAVELY    \"'I think there is grave doubt that the men will get off safely. I am  willing to remain and play the man's game, if there are not enough boats  for more than the women and children. I won't die here like a beast.  I'll meet my end as man.'    \"There was a pause and then Mr. Guggenheim continued:    \"'Tell my wife, Johnson, if it should happen that my secretary and I  both go down and you are saved, tell her I played the game out straight  and to the end. No woman shall be left aboard this ship because Ben  Guggenheim was a coward.    \"'Tell her that my last thoughts will be of her and of our girls, but  that my duty now is to these unfortunate women and children on this  ship. Tell her I will meet whatever fate is in store for me, knowing she  will approve of what I do.'\"    In telling the story the room steward said the last he saw of Mr.  Guggenheim was when he stood fully dressed upon the upper deck talking  calmly with Colonel Astor and Major Butt.    Before the last of the boats got away, according to some of the  passengers' narratives, there were more than fifty shots fired upon the  decks by officers or others in the effort to maintain the discipline  that until then had been well preserved.      THE SINKING VESSEL    Richard Norris Williams, Jr., one of the survivors of the Titanic, saw  his father killed by being crushed by one of the tremendous funnels of  the sinking vessel.    \"We stood on deck watching the life-boats of the Titanic being filled  and lowered into the water,\" said Mr. Williams. \"The water was nearly  up to our waists and the ship was about at her last. Suddenly one of the  great funnels fell. I sprang aside, endeavoring to pull father with me.  A moment later the funnel was swept overboard and the body of father  went with it.    \"I sprang overboard and swam through the ice to a life-raft, and  "]]]
