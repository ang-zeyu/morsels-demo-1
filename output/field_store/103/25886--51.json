Originally  it was by no means wholly Socialist, but in successive  Congresses Marx won it over more and more to his  views. At its third Congress, in Brussels in September,  1868, it became definitely Socialist. Meanwhile  Bakunin, regretting his earlier abstention, had  decided to join it, and he brought with him a  considerable following in French-Switzerland, France,  Spain and Italy. At the fourth Congress, held at  Basle in September, 1869, two currents were strongly  marked. The Germans and English followed Marx  in his belief in the State as it was to become after the  abolition of private property; they followed him also  in his desire to found Labor Parties in the various  countries, and to utilize the machinery of democracy  for the election of representatives of Labor to  Parliaments. On the other hand, the Latin nations in  the main followed Bakunin in opposing the State and  disbelieving in the machinery of representative  government. The conflict between these two groups grew  more and more bitter, and each accused the other  of various offenses. The statement that Bakunin  was a spy was repeated, but was withdrawn after  investigation. Marx wrote in a confidential  communication to his German friends that Bakunin was  an agent of the Pan-Slavist party and received from  them 25,000 francs a year. Meanwhile, Bakunin  became for a time interested in the attempt to stir  up an agrarian revolt in Russia, and this led him  to neglect the contest in the International at a crucial  moment. During the Franco-Prussian war Bakunin  passionately took the side of France, especially after  the fall of Napoleon III. He endeavored to rouse  the people to revolutionary resistance like that of  1793, and became involved in an abortive attempt at  revolt in Lyons. The French Government accused  him of being a paid agent of Prussia, and it was  with difficulty that he escaped to Switzerland. The  dispute with Marx and his followers had become  exacerbated by the national dispute. Bakunin, like  Kropotkin after him, regarded the new power of  Germany as the greatest menace to liberty in the  world. He hated the Germans with a bitter hatred,  partly, no doubt, on account of Bismarck, but probably  still more on account of Marx. To this day,  Anarchism has remained confined almost exclusively  to the Latin countries, and has been associated with, a  hatred of Germany, growing out of the contests  between Marx and Bakunin in the International.    The final suppression of Bakunin's faction  occurred at the General Congress of the International  at the Hague in 1872. The meeting-place was  chosen by the General Council (in which Marx was  unopposed), with a view--so Bakunin's friends contend--  to making access impossible for Bakunin (on  account of the hostility of the French and German  governments) and difficult for his friends. Bakunin  was expelled from the International as the result of  a report accusing him inter alia of theft backed; up  by intimidation.    The orthodoxy of the International was saved,  but at the cost of its vitality. From this time onward,  it ceased to be itself a power, but both sections continued  to work in their various groups, and the Socialist  groups in particular grew rapidly. Ultimately  a new International was formed (1889) which continued  down to the outbreak of the present war. As  to the future of International Socialism it would be  rash to prophesy, though it would seem that the  international idea has acquired sufficient strength to  need again, after the war, some such means of expression  as it found before in Socialist congresses.    By this time Bakunin's health was broken, and  except for a few brief intervals, he lived in retirement  until his death in 1876.    Bakunin's life, unlike Marx's, was a very stormy  one. Every kind of rebellion against authority  always aroused his sympathy, and in his support he  never paid the slightest attention to personal risk.  His influence, undoubtedly very great, arose chiefly  through the influence of his personality upon important  individuals. His writings differ from Marx's as  much as his life does, and in a similar way. They are  chaotic, largely, aroused by some passing occasion,  abstract and metaphysical, except when they deal  with current politics. He does not come to close  quarters with economic facts, but dwells usually in  the regions of theory and metaphysics. When he  descends from these regions, he is much more at the  mercy of current international politics than Marx,  much less imbued with the consequences of the belief  that it is economic causes that are fundamental. He  praised Marx for enunciating this doctrine,[15] but  nevertheless continued to think in terms of nations.  His longest work, ``L'Empire Knouto-Germanique et  la Revolution Sociale,'' is mainly concerned with the  situation in France during the later stages of the  Franco-Prussian War, and with the means of resisting  German imperialism. Most of his writing was  done in a hurry in the interval between two insurrections.  There is something of Anarchism in his lack  of literary order. His best-known work is a fragment  entitled by its editors ``God and the State.''[16]      In this work he represents belief in God and belief in  the State as the two great obstacles to human liberty.  A typical passage will serve to illustrate its style.      [15] ``Marx, as a thinker, is on the right road. He has established  as a principle that all the evolutions, political, religious,  and juridical, in history are, not the causes, but the effects of  economic evolutions. This is a great and fruitful thought, which  he has not absolutely invented; it has been glimpsed, expressed  in part, by many others besides him; but in any case to him  belongs the honor of having solidly established it and of having  enunciated it as the basis of his whole economic system. (1870;  ib. ii. p. xiii.)    [16] This title is not Bakunin's, but was invented by Cafiero  and Elisee Reclus, who edited it, not knowing that it was a  fragment of what was intended to he the second version of  ``L'Empire Knouto-Germanique'' (see ib. ii. p 283).        The State is not society, it is only an historical form  of it, as brutal as it is abstract. It was born historically  in all countries of the marriage of violence, rapine, pillage,  in a word, war and conquest, with the gods successively  created by the theological fantasy of nations.  It has been from its origin, and it remains still at present,  the divine sanction of brutal force and triumphant  inequality.    The State is authority; it is force; it is the ostentation  and infatuation of force: it does not insinuate  itself; it does not seek to convert. . . . Even when  it commands what is good, it hinders and spoils it, just  because it commands it, and because every command provokes  and excites the legitimate revolts of liberty; and  because the good, from the moment that it is commanded,  becomes evil from the point of view of true morality, of  human morality (doubtless not of divine), from the point  of view of human respect and of liberty. Liberty, morality,  and the human dignity of man consist precisely  in this, that he does good, not because it is commanded,  but because he conceives it, wills it and loves it.      We do not find in Bakunin's works a clear picture  of the society at which he aimed, or any argument  to prove that such a society could be stable.  If we wish to understand Anarchism we must turn  to his followers, and especially to Kropotkin--like  him, a Russian aristocrat familiar with the prisons  of Europe, and, like him, an Anarchist who, in spite  of his internationalism, is imbued with a fiery hatred  of the Germans.    Kropotkin has devoted much of his writing to  technical questions of production. In ``Fields,  Factories and Workshops'' and ``The Conquest of  Bread'' he has set himself to prove that, if production  were more scientific and better organized, a  comparatively small amount of quite agreeable work  would suffice to keep the whole population in comfort.  Even assuming, as we probably must, that he  somewhat exaggerates what is possible with our  present scientific knowledge, it must nevertheless be  conceded that his contentions contain a very large  measure of truth. In attacking the subject of production  he has shown that he knows what is the really  crucial question. If civilization and progress are to  be compatible with equality, it is necessary that  equality should not involve long hours of painful  toil for little more than the necessaries of life, since,  where there is no leisure, art and science will die and  all progress will become impossible. The objection  which some feel to Socialism and Anarchism alike on  this ground cannot be upheld in view of the possible  productivity of labor.    The system at which Kropotkin aims, whether or  not it be possible, is certainly one which demands a  very great improvement in the methods of production  above what is common at present. He desires  to abolish wholly the system of wages, not only, as  most Socialists do, in the sense that a man is to be  paid rather for his willingness to work than for the  actual work demanded of him, but in a more fundamental  sense: there is to be no obligation to work,  and all things are to be shared in equal proportions  among the whole population. Kropotkin relies upon  the possibility of making work pleasant: he holds  that, in such a community as he foresees, practically  everyone will prefer work to idleness, because work will  not involve overwork or slavery, or that excessive  specialization that industrialism has brought about,  but will be merely a pleasant activity for certain  hours of the day, giving a man an outlet for his  spontaneous constructive impulses. There is to be no  compulsion, no law, no government exercising force;  there will still be acts of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6927"],[0,"The White Feather (#9)"],[1,"  the oar to shove into the water. I've seen cats that could row better  than Tomlin.\"    \"That's what I told him. At least, I said he couldn't row for toffee,  so he said all right, I bet I can lick you, and I said I betted he  couldn't, and he said all right, then, let's try, and then the other  chaps wanted to join in, so we made an inter-house thing of it. And I  want you to come and stroke us.\"    Jackson hesitated. Mr Dexter, setting the lines on Friday, had  certainly said that they were to be shown up \"tomorrow evening.\" He had  said it very loud and clear. Still, in a case like this.... After all,  by helping to beat the School House on the river he would be giving  Dexter's a leg-up. And what more could the man want?    \"Right ho,\" said Jackson.    Down at the School boat-house the enemy were already afloat when  Painter and Jackson arrived.    \"Buck up,\" cried the School House crew.    Dexter's embarked, five strong. There was room for two on each seat.  Jackson shared the post of stroke with Painter. Crowle steered.    \"Ready?\" asked Tomlin from the other boat.    \"Half a sec.,\" said Jackson. \"What's the course?\"    \"Oh, don't you know _that_ yet? Up to the town, round the island  just below the bridge,--the island with the croquet ground on it,  _you_ know--and back again here. Ready?\"    \"In a jiffy. Look here, Crowle, remember about steering. You pull the  right line if you want to go to the right and the other if you want to  go to the left.\"    \"All right,\" said the injured Crowle. \"As if I didn't know that.\"    \"Thought I'd mention it. It's your fault. Nobody could tell by looking  at you that you knew anything except how to eat. Ready, you chaps?\"    \"When I say 'Three,'\" said Tomlin.    It was a subject of heated discussion between the crews for weeks  afterwards whether Dexter's boat did or did not go off at the word  \"Two.\" Opinions were divided on the topic. But it was certain that  Jackson and his men led from the start. Pulling a good, splashing  stroke which had drenched Crowle to the skin in the first thirty yards,  Dexter's boat crept slowly ahead. By the time the island was reached,  it led by a length. Encouraged by success, the leaders redoubled their  already energetic efforts. Crowle sat in a shower-bath. He was even  moved to speech about it.    \"When you've finished,\" said Crowle.    Jackson, intent upon repartee, caught a crab, and the School House drew  level again. The two boats passed the island abreast.    Just here occurred one of those unfortunate incidents. Both crews had  quickened their stroke until the boats had practically been converted  into submarines, and the rival coxswains were observing bitterly to  space that this was jolly well the last time they ever let themselves  in for this sort of thing, when round the island there hove in sight a  flotilla of boats, directly in the path of the racers.    There were three of them, and not even the spray which played over them  like a fountain could prevent Crowle from seeing that they were manned  by Judies. Even on the river these outcasts wore their mortar-boards.    \"Look out!\" shrieked Crowle, pulling hard on his right line. \"Stop  rowing, you chaps. We shall be into them.\"    At the same moment the School House oarsmen ceased pulling. The two  boats came to a halt a few yards from the enemy.    \"What's up?\" panted Jackson, crimson from his exertions. \"Hullo, it's  the Judies!\"    Tomlin was parleying with the foe.    \"Why the dickens can't you keep out of the way? Spoiling our race. Wait  till we get ashore.\"    But the Judies, it seemed, were not prepared to wait even for that  short space of time. A miscreant, larger than the common run of Judy,  made a brief, but popular, address to his men.    \"Splash them!\" he said.    Instantly, amid shrieks of approval, oars began to strike the water,  and the water began to fly over the Wrykyn boats, which were now  surrounded. The latter were not slow to join battle with the same  weapons. Homeric laughter came from the bridge above. The town bridge  was a sort of loafers' club, to which the entrance fee was a screw of  tobacco, and the subscription an occasional remark upon the weather.  Here gathered together day by day that section of the populace which  resented it when they \"asked for employment, and only got work  instead\". From morn till eve they lounged against the balustrades,  surveying nature, and hoping it would be kind enough to give them some  excitement that day. An occasional dog-fight found in them an eager  audience. No runaway horse ever bored them. A broken-down motor-car was  meat and drink to them. They had an appetite for every spectacle.    When, therefore, the water began to fly from boat to boat, kind-hearted  men fetched their friends from neighbouring public houses and craned  with them over the parapet, observing the sport and commenting thereon.  It was these comments that attracted Mr Dexter's attention. When,  cycling across the bridge, he found the south side of it entirely  congested, and heard raucous voices urging certain unseen \"little 'uns\"  now to \"go it\" and anon to \"vote for Pedder\", his curiosity was  aroused. He dismounted and pushed his way through the crowd until he  got a clear view of what was happening below.    He was just in time to see the most stirring incident of the fight. The  biggest of the Judy boats had been propelled by the current nearer and  nearer to the Dexter Argo. No sooner was it within distance than  Jackson, dropping his oar, grasped the side and pulled it towards him.  The two boats crashed together and rocked violently as the crews rose  from their seats and grappled with one another. A hurricane of laughter  and applause went up from the crowd upon the bridge.    The next moment both boats were bottom upwards and drifting sluggishly  down towards the island, while the crews swam like rats for the other  boats.    Every Wrykinian had to learn to swim before he was allowed on the  river; so that the peril of Jackson and his crew was not extreme: and  it was soon speedily evident that swimming was also part of the Judy  curriculum, for the shipwrecked ones were soon climbing drippingly on  board the surviving ships, where they sat and made puddles, and  shrieked defiance at their antagonists.    This was accepted by both sides as the end of the fight, and the  combatants parted without further hostilities, each fleet believing  that the victory was with them.    And Mr Dexter, mounting his bicycle again, rode home to tell the  headmaster.    That evening, after preparation, the headmaster held a reception. Among  distinguished visitors were Jackson, Painter, Tomlin, Crowle, and six  others.    On the Monday morning the headmaster issued a manifesto to the school  after prayers. He had, he said, for some time entertained the idea of  placing the town out of bounds. He would do so now. No boy, unless he  was a prefect, would be allowed till further notice to cross the town  bridge. As regarded the river, for the future boating Wrykinians must  confine their attentions to the lower river. Nobody must take a boat  up-stream. The school boatman would have strict orders to see that this  rule was rigidly enforced. Any breach of these bounds would, he  concluded, be punished with the utmost severity.    The headmaster of Wrykyn was not a hasty man. He thought before he put  his foot down. But when he did, he put it down heavily.    Sheen heard the ultimatum with dismay. He was a law-abiding person, and  here he was, faced with a dilemma that made it necessary for him to  choose between breaking school rules of the most important kind, or  pulling down all the castles he had built in the air before the mortar  had had time to harden between their stones.    He wished he could talk it over with somebody. But he had nobody with  whom he could talk over anything. He must think it out for himself.    He spent the rest of the day thinking it out, and by nightfall he had  come to his decision.    Even at the expense of breaking bounds and the risk of being caught at  it, he must keep his appointment with Joe Bevan. It would mean going to  the town landing-stage for a boat, thereby breaking bounds twice over.    But it would have to be done.          IX    SHEEN BEGINS HIS EDUCATION      The \"Blue Boar\" was a picturesque inn, standing on the bank of the  river Severn. It was much frequented in the summer by fishermen, who  spent their days in punts and their evenings in the old oak parlour,  where a picture in boxing costume of Mr Joe Bevan, whose brother was  the landlord of the inn, gazed austerely down on them, as if he  disapproved of the lamentable want of truth displayed by the majority  of their number. Artists also congregated there to paint the  ivy-covered porch. At the back of the house were bedrooms, to which the  fishermen would make their way in the small hours of a summer morning,  arguing to the last as they stumbled upstairs. One of these bedrooms,  larger than the others, had been converted into a gymnasium for the use  of mine host's brother. Thither he brought pugilistic aspirants who  wished to be trained for various contests, and it was the boast of the  \"Blue Boar\" that it had never turned out a loser. A reputation of this  kind is a valuable asset to an inn, and the boxing world thought highly  of it, in spite of the fact that it was off the beaten track. Certainly  the luck of the \"Blue Boar\" had been surprising.    Sheen pulled steadily up stream on the appointed day, and after half an  hour's work found himself opposite the little landing-stage at the foot  of the inn lawn.    His journey had not been free from adventure. On his way to the town he  had almost run into Mr Templar, and but for the lucky accident of that  gentleman's short sight must have been discovered. He had reached the  landing-stage in safety, but he had not felt comfortable until he was  well out of sight of the town. "]]]
