It is  impossible to assume that no great famine took place in Egypt between  the reign of Tcheser and the period when the inscription was made, and  when we consider this fact the choice by the editor of the legend of a  famine which took place under the IIIrd Dynasty to illustrate the power  of Khnemu seems inexplicable.    Of the famines which must have taken place in the Dynastic period the  inscriptions tell us nothing, but the story of the seven years' famine  mentioned in the Book of Genesis shows that there is nothing improbable  in a famine lasting so long in Egypt.  Arab historians also mention  several famines which lasted for seven years.  That which took place in  the years 1066-1072 nearly ruined the whole country.  A cake of bread  was sold for 15 dinanir, (the dinar = 10s.), a horse was sold for 20, a  dog for 5, a cat for 3, and an egg for 1 dinar.  When all the animals  were eaten men began to eat each other, and human flesh was sold in  public.  \"Passengers were caught in the streets by hooks let down from  the windows, drawn up, killed, and cooked.\"[FN#45]  During the famine  which began in 1201 people ate human flesh habitually. Parents killed  and cooked their own children, and a wife was found eating her husband  raw.  Baby fricassee and haggis of children's heads were ordinary  articles of diet.  The graves even were ransacked for food.  An ox sold  for 70 dinanir. [FN#46]        [FN#45]  Lane Poole, Middle Ages, p. 146.    [FN#46]  Ibid., p. 216.        The legend begins with the statement that in the 18th year of the reign  of King Tcheser, when Matar, the Erpa Prince and Ha, was the Governor  of the temple properties of the South and North, and was also the  Director of the Khenti men at Elephantine (Aswan), a royal despatch was  delivered to him, in which the king said: \"I am in misery on my throne.  My heart is very sore because of the calamity which hath happened, for  the Nile hath not come forth[FN#47] for seven years.  There is no  grain, there are no vegetables, there is no food, and every man is  robbing his neighbour.  Men wish to walk, but they are unable to move;  the young man drags along his limbs, the hearts of the aged are crushed  with despair, their legs fail them, they sink to the ground, and they  clutch their bodies with their hands in pain.  The councillors are  dumb, and nothing but wind comes out of the granaries when they are  opened.  Everything is in a state of ruin.\"  A more graphic picture of  the misery caused by the famine could hardly be imagined.  The king  then goes on to ask Matar where the Nile is born? what god or goddess  presides over it? and what is his [or her] form?  He says he would like  to go to the temple of Thoth to enquire of that god, to go to the  College of the Magicians, and search through the sacred books in order  to find out these things.        [FN#47]  i.e., there have been insufficient Nile-floods.        When Matar had read the despatch, he set out to go to the king, and  explained to him the things which he wished to know.  He told him that,  the Nile rose near the city of Elephantine, that it flowed out of two  caverns, which were the breasts of the Nile-god, that it rose to a  height of twenty-eight cubits at Elephantine, and to the height of  seven cubits at Sma-Behutet, or, Diospolis Parva in the Delta.  He who  controlled the Nile was Khnemu, and when this god drew the bolt of the  doors which shut in the stream, and smote the earth with his sandals,  the river rushed forth.  Matar also described to the king the form of  Khnemu, which was that of Shu, and the work which he did, and the  wooden house in which he lived, and its exact position, which was near  the famous granite quarries.  The gods who dwelt with Khnemu were the  goddess Sept (Sothis, or the Dog-star), the goddess Anqet, Hap (or  Hep), the Nile-god, Shu, Keb, Nut, Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, and Horus.  Thus we see that the priests of Khnemu made him to be the head of a  Company of Gods.  Finally Matar gave the king a list of all the stones,  precious and otherwise, which were found in and about Elephantine.    When the king, who had, it seems, come to Elephantine, heard these  things he rejoiced greatly, and he went into the temple of Khnemu.  The priests drew back the curtains and sprinkled him with holy water,  and then he passed into the shrine and offered up a great sacrifice of  bread-cakes, beer, geese, oxen, and all kinds of good things, to the  gods and goddesses who dwelt at Elephantine, in the place called \"Couch  of the heart in life and power.\"  Suddenly he found himself standing  face to face with the god Khnemu, whom he placated with a peace-  offering and with prayer.  Then the god opened his eyes, and bent his  body towards the king, and spake to him mighty words, saying, \"I am  Khnemu, who made thee.  My hands knitted together thy body and made it  sound, and I gave thee thy heart.\"  Khnemu then went on to complain  that, although the ground under the king's feet was filled with stones  and metal, men were too inert to work them and to employ them in  repairing or rebuilding of the shrines of the gods, or in doing what  they ought to do for him, their Lord and Creator.  These words were, of  course, meant as a rebuke for the king, who evidently, though it is not  so stated in the text, was intended by Khnemu to undertake the  rebuilding of his shrine without delay.  The god then went on to  proclaim his majesty and power, and declared himself to be Nu, the  Celestial Ocean, and the Nile-god, \"who came into being at the  beginning, and riseth at his will to give health to him that laboureth  for Khnemu.\"  He described himself as the Father of the gods, the  Governor of the earth and of men, and then he promised the king to make  the Nile rise yearly, regularly, and unceasingly, to give abundant  harvests, to give all people their heart's desire, to make misery to  pass away, to fill the granaries, and to make the whole land of Egypt  yellow with waving fields of full ripe grain.  When the king, who had  been in a dream, heard the god mention crops, he woke up, and his  courage returned to him, and having cast away despair from his heart he  issued a decree by which he made ample provision for the maintenance of  the worship of the god in a fitting state.  In this decree, the first  copy of which was cut upon wood, the king endowed Khnemu with 20  schoinoi of land on each side of the river, with gardens, etc.  It was  further enacted that every man who drew water from the Nile for his  land should contribute a portion of his crops to the god.  Fishermen,  fowlers, and hunters were to pay an octroi duty of one-tenth of the  value of their catches when they brought them into the city, and a  tithe of the cattle was to be set apart for the daily sacrifice.  The  masters of caravans coming from the Sudan were to pay a tithe also, but  they were not liable to any further tax in the country northwards.  Every metal-worker, ore-crusher, miner, mason, and handicraftsman of  every kind, was to pay to the temple of the god one-tenth of the value  of the material produced or worked by his labour.  The decree provided  also for the appointment of an inspector whose duty it would be to  weigh the gold, silver and copper which came into the town of  Elephantine, and to assess the value both of these metals and of the  precious stones, etc., which were to be devoted to the service of  Khnemu.  All materials employed in making the images of the gods, and  all handicraftsmen employed in the work were exempted from tithing.  In  short, the worship of the god and his company was to be maintained  according to ancient use and wont, and the people were to supply the  temple with everything necessary in a generous spirit and with a  liberal hand.  He who failed in any way to comply with the enactments  was to be beaten with the rope, and the name of Tcheser was to be  perpetuated in the temple.            VIII.        THE LEGEND OF THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION OF HORUS, AND OTHER MAGICAL  TEXTS.        The magical and religious texts of the Egyptians of all periods contain  spells intended to be used against serpents, scorpions, and noxious  reptiles of all kinds, and their number, and the importance which was  attached to them, suggest that Egypt must always have produced these  pests in abundance, and that the Egyptians were always horribly afraid  of them.  The text of Unas, which was written towards the close of the  Vth Dynasty, contains many such spells, and in the Theban and Saite  Books of the Dead several Chapters consist of nothing but spells and  incantations, many of which are based on archaic texts, against  crocodiles, serpents, and other deadly reptiles, and insects of all  kinds.  All such creatures were regarded as incarnations of evil  spirits, which attack the dead as well as the living, and therefore it  was necessary for the well-being of the former that copies of spells  against them should be written upon the walls of tombs, coffins,  funerary amulets, etc.  The gods were just as open to the attacks of  venomous reptiles as man, and Ra, himself, the king of the gods, nearly  died from the poison of a snake-bite.  Now the gods were, as a rule,  able to defend themselves against the attacks of Set and his fiends,  and the poisonous snakes and insects which were their emissaries, by  virtue of the fluid of life, which was the peculiar attribute of  divinity, and the efforts of Egyptians were directed to the acquisition  of a portion of this magical power, which would protect their souls and  bodies and their houses and cattle, and other property, each day and  each night throughout the year.  When a man cared for the protection of  himself only he wore an amulet of some kind, in which the fluid of life  was localized. When he wished to protect his house against invasion by  venomous reptiles he placed statues containing the fluid of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9457"],[0,"Travels in Arabia; comprehending an account of those territories in Hedjaz which (#9)"],[1,"end  of June, the new fruit (called ruteb) comes in: this lasts for two  months, after which, for the remainder of the    [p.30] year, the date-paste, called adjoue, is sold. This is formed by  pressing the dates, when fully ripe, into large baskets so forcibly as  to reduce them to a hard solid paste or cake, each basket weighing  generally about two hundred weight; in this state the Bedouins export  the adjoue; in the market it is cut out of the basket and sold by the  pound. This adjoue forms a part of the daily food among all classes of  people. In travelling, it is dissolved in water, and thus affords a  sweet and refreshing drink. There are upwards of twelve different sorts  of adjoue; the best comes from Taraba, behind Tayf (now occupied by the  Wahabis.) The most common kind at present in the market is that from  Fatmé; and the better sort, that from Kheleys, and Djedeyde, on the road  to Medina. During the monsoon, the ships from the Persian gulf bring  adjoue from Basra for sale, in small baskets, weighing about ten pounds  each; this kind is preferred to every other. The East-India ships, on  their return, take off a considerable quantity of the paste, which is  sold to great profit among the muselmans of Hindostan.    Four pancake-makers, who sell, early in the morning, pancakes fried in  butter; a favourite breakfast.    Five bean-sellers. These sell for breakfast also, at an early hour,  Egyptian horse-beans boiled in water, which are eaten with ghee and  pepper. The boiled beans are called mudammes; they form a favourite dish  with the people of Egypt, from whom the Arabs have adopted it.    Five sellers of sweetmeats, sugar-plums, and different sorts of  confectionary, of which the Hedjaz people are much fonder than any  Orientals I have seen; they eat them after supper, and in the evening  the confectioners stands are surrounded by multitudes of buyers. The  Indians are the best makers of them. I saw no articles of this kind here  that I had not already found in Egypt; the Baktawa, Gnafe, and Ghereybe,  are as common here as at Aleppo and Cairo.    Two kebab shops, where roasted meat is sold; these are kept by Turks,  the kebab not being an Arab dish.    [p.31] Two soup-sellers, who also sell boiled sheeps heads and feet,  and are much visited at mid-day.    One seller of fish fried in oil, frequented by all the Turkish and Greek  sailors.    Ten or twelve stands where bread is sold, generally by women; the bread  has an unpleasant flavour, the meal not having been properly cleansed,  and the leaven being bad. A loaf of the same size as that which at Cairo  is sold for two paras, costs here, though of a much worse quality, eight  paras.    Two sellers of leben, or sour milk, which is extremely scarce and dear  all over the Hedjaz. It may appear strange that, among the shepherds of  Arabia, there should be a scarcity of milk, yet this was the case at  Djidda and Mekka; but, in fact, the immediate vicinity of these towns is  extremely barren, little suited to the pasturage of cattle, and very few  people are at the expense of feeding them for their milk only. When I  was at Djidda, the rotolo or pound of milk (for it is sold by weight)  cost one piastre and a half, and could only be obtained by favour. What  the northern Turks called yoghort, and the Syrians and Egyptians leben-  hamed, [Very thick milk, rendered sour by boiling and the addition of a  strong acid.] does not appear to be a native Arab dish; the Bedouins of  Arabia, at least, never prepare it.    Two shops, kept by Turks, where Greek cheese, dried meat, dried apples,  figs, raisins, apricots, called kammareddin, &c. are sold at three  times the price paid in Cairo. The cheese comes from Candia, and is much  in request among all the Turkish troops. An indifferent sort of cheese  is made in the Hedjaz; it is extremely white, although salted, does not  keep long, and is not by any means very nutritive. The Bedouins  themselves care little for cheese; they either drink their milk, or make  it into butter. The dried meat sold in these shops is the salted and  smoked beef of Asia Minor, known all over Turkey by the name of  bastorma, and    [p.32] much relished by travellers. The Turkish soldiers and the Hadjis  are particularly fond of it, but the Arabs never can be induced to taste  it; many of them, observing that it differs in appearance from all other  meat with which they are acquainted, persist in regarding it as pork,  and the estimation in which they hold the Turkish soldiery and their  religious principles is not likely to remove their prejudices on this  head. All the dried fruits above mentioned, except the apricots, come  from the Archipelago; the latter are sent from Damascus all over Arabia,  where they are considered a luxury, particularly among the Bedouins. The  stone is extracted and the fruit reduced to a paste, and spread out upon  its leaves to dry in the sun. It makes a very pleasant sauce when  dissolved in water. On all their marches through the Hedjaz, the Turkish  troops live almost entirely upon biscuit and this fruit.    Eleven large shops of corn-dealers, where Egyptian wheat, barley, beans,  lentils, dhourra, [Or durra, from Sowakin, which comes from Taka, in the  interior of Nubia, and a small-grained sort from Yemen, are also sold  here.] Indian and Egyptian rice, biscuits, &c. may be purchased. The  only wheat now sold in the Hedjaz comes from Egypt. In time of peace,  there is a considerable importation from Yemen into Mekka and Djidda,  and from Nedjed to Medina; but the imports from Egypt are by far the  most considerable, and the Hedjaz may truly be said to depend upon Egypt  for corn. The corn-trade was formerly in the hands of individuals, and  the Sherif Ghaleb also speculated in it; but at the present, Mohammed  Aly Pasha has taken it entirely into his own hands, and none is sold  either at Suez or Cosseir to private persons, every grain being shipped  on account of the Pasha. This is likewise the case with all other  provisions, as rice, butter, biscuits, onions, of which latter great  quantities are imported. At the time of my residence in the Hedjaz, this  country not producing a sufficiency, the Pasha sold the grain at Djidda  for the price of    [p.33] from one hundred and thirty to one hundred and sixty piastres per  erdeb, and every other kind of provision in proportion; the corn cost  him twelve piastres by the erdeb in Upper Egypt, and including the  expense of carriage from Genne to Cosseir, and freight thence to Djidda,  twenty-five or thirty piastres. This enormous profit was alone  sufficient to defray his expenses in carrying on the Wahaby war; but it  was little calculated to conciliate the good-will of the people. His  partisans, however, excused him, by alleging that, in keeping grain at  high prices, he secured the Bedouins of the Hedjaz in his interest, as  they depend upon Mekka and Djidda for provisions, and they were thus  compelled to enter into his service, and receive his pay, to escape  starvation. The common people of the Hedjaz use very little wheat; their  bread is made either of durra or barley-flour, both of which are one-  third cheaper than wheat; or they live entirely upon rice and butter.  This is the case also with most of the Bedouins of Tehama, on the coast.  The Yemen people in Djidda eat nothing but durra. Most of the rice used  at Djidda is brought as ballast by the ships from India. The best sort  comes from Guzerat and Cutch: it forms the chief article of food among  the people of the Hedjaz, who prefer it to the rice from Egypt, because  they think it more wholesome than the former, which is used exclusively  by the Turks and other strangers from the north-ward. The grain of the  Indian rice is larger and longer than the common sort of Egypt, and is  of a yellowish colour; whereas the latter has a reddish tint; but the  best sorts of both are snow-white. The Indian rice swells more in  boiling than the Egyptian, and is for this reason preferred by the  Arabs, as a smaller quantity of it will fill a dish; but the Egyptian  rice is more nutritive. The Indian rice is rather cheaper, and is  transported from Djidda to Mekka, Tayf, Medina, and thence as far as  Nedjed. A mixture of equal portions of rice and lentils, over which  butter is poured,    [p.34] forms a favourite preparation with the middle class, and  generally their only dish at supper. [This dish is known in Syria, and  called there medjeddereh, because the lentils in the rice look like a  persons face marked with the small-pox, or djedreh.] I found, in every  part of the Hedjaz, that the Bedouins, when travelling, carried no other  provision than rice, lentils, butter, and dates. The importation of  biscuits from Egypt has of late been very considerable, for the use of  the Turkish army. The Arabians do not like and seldom eat them even on  board their ships, where they bake their unleavened cake every morning  in those small ovens which are found in all the ships of every size that  navigate the Red Sea.    Salt is sold by the corn-dealers. Sea-salt is collected near Djidda, and  is a monopoly in the hands of the sherif. The inhabitants of Mekka  prefer rock-salt, which is brought thither by the Bedouins from some  mountains in the neighbourhood of Tayf.    Thirty-one tobacco-shops, in which are sold Syrian and Egyptian tobacco,  tombac, or tobacco for the Persian pipe, pipe-heads and pipe-snakes,  cocoa-nuts, coffee-beans, keshre, soap, almonds, Hedjaz raisins, and  some other articles of grocery. The Egyptian tobacco, sometimes mixed  with that of Sennar, is the cheapest, and in great demand throughout the  Hedjaz. There are two sorts of it: the leaf of one is green, even when  dry; this is called ribbé, and comes from Upper Egypt: the other is  brown-leaved, the best sort of which grows about Tahta, to the south of  Siout. During the power of the Wahabys, tobacco could not be sold "]]]
