They censored my stuff so cruel that the paper fired me. Then  I went on a walking-tour round England and sat for a fortnight in a  little farm in Suffolk. By and by I came back to Claridge's and this  bookshop, for I had learned most of what I wanted.    'I had learned,' he went on, turning his curious, full, ruminating eyes  on me, 'that the British working-man is about the soundest piece of  humanity on God's earth. He grumbles a bit and jibs a bit when he  thinks the Government are giving him a crooked deal, but he's gotten  the patience of Job and the sand of a gamecock. And he's gotten humour  too, that tickles me to death. There's not much trouble in that quarter  for it's he and his kind that's beating the Hun ... But I picked up a  thing or two besides that.'    He leaned forward and tapped me on the knee. 'I reverence the British  Intelligence Service. Flies don't settle on it to any considerable  extent. It's got a mighty fine mesh, but there's one hole in that mesh,  and it's our job to mend it. There's a high-powered brain in the game  against us. I struck it a couple of years ago when I was hunting Dumba  and Albert, and I thought it was in Noo York, but it wasn't. I struck  its working again at home last year and located its head office in  Europe. So I tried Switzerland and Holland, but only bits of it were  there. The centre of the web where the old spider sits is right here in  England, and for six months I've been shadowing that spider. There's a  gang to help, a big gang, and a clever gang, and partly an innocent  gang. But there's only one brain, and it's to match that that the  Robson Brothers settled my duodenum.'    I was listening with a quickened pulse, for now at last I was getting  to business.    'What is he--international socialist, or anarchist, or what?' I asked.    'Pure-blooded Boche agent, but the biggest-sized brand in the  catalogue--bigger than Steinmeier or old Bismarck's Staubier. Thank God  I've got him located ... I must put you wise about some things.'    He lay back in his rubbed leather armchair and yarned for twenty  minutes. He told me how at the beginning of the war Scotland Yard had  had a pretty complete register of enemy spies, and without making any  fuss had just tidied them away. After that, the covey having been  broken up, it was a question of picking off stray birds. That had taken  some doing. There had been all kinds of inflammatory stuff around, Red  Masons and international anarchists, and, worst of all, international  finance-touts, but they had mostly been ordinary cranks and rogues, the  tools of the Boche agents rather than agents themselves. However, by  the middle of 1915 most of the stragglers had been gathered in. But  there remained loose ends, and towards the close of last year somebody  was very busy combining these ends into a net. Funny cases cropped up  of the leakage of vital information. They began to be bad about October  1916, when the Hun submarines started on a special racket. The enemy  suddenly appeared possessed of a knowledge which we thought to be  shared only by half a dozen officers. Blenkiron said he was not  surprised at the leakage, for there's always a lot of people who hear  things they oughtn't to. What surprised him was that it got so quickly  to the enemy.    Then after last February, when the Hun submarines went in for  frightfulness on a big scale, the thing grew desperate. Leakages  occurred every week, and the business was managed by people who knew  their way about, for they avoided all the traps set for them, and when  bogus news was released on purpose, they never sent it. A convoy which  had been kept a deadly secret would be attacked at the one place where  it was helpless. A carefully prepared defensive plan would be  checkmated before it could be tried. Blenkiron said that there was no  evidence that a single brain was behind it all, for there was no  similarity in the cases, but he had a strong impression all the time  that it was the work of one man. We managed to close some of the  bolt-holes, but we couldn't put our hands near the big ones. 'By this  time,' said he, 'I reckoned I was about ready to change my methods. I  had been working by what the highbrows call induction, trying to argue  up from the deeds to the doer. Now I tried a new lay, which was to  calculate down from the doer to the deeds. They call it deduction. I  opined that somewhere in this island was a gentleman whom we will call  Mr X, and that, pursuing the line of business he did, he must have  certain characteristics. I considered very carefully just what sort of  personage he must be. I had noticed that his device was apparently the  Double Bluff. That is to say, when he had two courses open to him, A  and B, he pretended he was going to take B, and so got us guessing that  he would try A. Then he took B after all. So I reckoned that his  camouflage must correspond to this little idiosyncrasy. Being a Boche  agent, he wouldn't pretend to be a hearty patriot, an honest old  blood-and-bones Tory. That would be only the Single Bluff. I considered  that he would be a pacifist, cunning enough just to keep inside the  law, but with the eyes of the police on him. He would write books which  would not be allowed to be exported. He would get himself disliked in  the popular papers, but all the mugwumps would admire his moral  courage. I drew a mighty fine picture to myself of just the man I  expected to find. Then I started out to look for him.'    Blenkiron's face took on the air of a disappointed child. 'It was no  good. I kept barking up the wrong tree and wore myself out playing the  sleuth on white-souled innocents.'    'But you've found him all right,' I cried, a sudden suspicion leaping  into my brain.    'He's found,' he said sadly, 'but the credit does not belong to John S.  Blenkiron. That child merely muddied the pond. The big fish was left  for a young lady to hook.'    'I know,' I cried excitedly. 'Her name is Miss Mary Lamington.'    He shook a disapproving head. 'You've guessed right, my son, but you've  forgotten your manners. This is a rough business and we won't bring in  the name of a gently reared and pure-minded young girl. If we speak to  her at all we call her by a pet name out of the _Pilgrim's Progress_  ... Anyhow she hooked the fish, though he isn't landed. D'you see any  light?'    'Ivery,' I gasped.    'Yes. Ivery. Nothing much to look at, you say. A common, middle-aged,  pie-faced, golf-playing high-brow, that you wouldn't keep out of a  Sunday school. A touch of the drummer, too, to show he has no dealings  with your effete aristocracy. A languishing silver-tongue that adores  the sound of his own voice. As mild, you'd say, as curds and cream.'    Blenkiron got out of his chair and stood above me. 'I tell you, Dick,  that man makes my spine cold. He hasn't a drop of good red blood in  him. The dirtiest apache is a Christian gentleman compared to Moxon  Ivery. He's as cruel as a snake and as deep as hell. But, by God, he's  got a brain below his hat. He's hooked and we're playing him, but Lord  knows if he'll ever be landed!'    'Why on earth don't you put him away?' I asked.    'We haven't the proof--legal proof, I mean; though there's buckets of  the other kind. I could put up a morally certain case, but he'd beat me  in a court of law. And half a hundred sheep would get up in Parliament  and bleat about persecution. He has a graft with every collection of  cranks in England, and with all the geese that cackle about the liberty  of the individual when the Boche is ranging about to enslave the world.  No, sir, that's too dangerous a game! Besides, I've a better in hand,  Moxon Ivery is the best-accredited member of this State. His _dossier_  is the completest thing outside the Recording Angel's little note-book.  We've taken up his references in every corner of the globe and they're  all as right as Morgan's balance sheet. From these it appears he's been  a high-toned citizen ever since he was in short-clothes. He was raised  in Norfolk, and there are people living who remember his father. He was  educated at Melton School and his name's in the register. He was in  business in Valparaiso, and there's enough evidence to write three  volumes of his innocent life there. Then he came home with a modest  competence two years before the war, and has been in the public eye  ever since. He was Liberal candidate for a London constitooency and he  has decorated the board of every institootion formed for the  amelioration of mankind. He's got enough alibis to choke a boa  constrictor, and they're water-tight and copper-bottomed, and they're  mostly damned lies ... But you can't beat him at that stunt. The man's  the superbest actor that ever walked the earth. You can see it in his  face. It isn't a face, it's a mask. He could make himself look like  Shakespeare or Julius Caesar or Billy Sunday or Brigadier-General  Richard Hannay if he wanted to. He hasn't got any personality  either--he's got fifty, and there's no one he could call his own. I  reckon when the devil gets the handling of him at last he'll have to  put sand on his claws to keep him from slipping through.'    Blenkiron was settled in his chair again, with one leg hoisted over the  side.    'We've closed a fair number of his channels in the last few months. No,  he don't suspect me. The world knows nothing of its greatest men, and  to him I'm only a Yankee peace-crank, who gives big subscriptions to  loony societies and will travel a hundred miles to let off steam before  any kind of audience. He's been to see me at Claridge's and I've  arranged that he shall know all my record. A darned bad record it is  too, for two years ago I was violent pro-British before I found  salvation and was requested to leave England. When"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5605"],[0,"The Power of Movement in Plants (#9)"],[1,"began to return. The cotyledons continually  [page 38]  move both up and down and laterally; but they do not rise up at night in a  conspicuous manner.    Lupinus luteus (Leguminosae).--Seedlings of this plant were observed  because the cotyledons are so thick (about .08 of an inch) that it seemed  unlikely that they would move. Our observations were not very successful,  as the seedlings are strongly heliotropic, and their circumnutation could  not be accurately observed near a north-east window, although they had been  kept during the previous day in the same position. A seedling was then  placed in darkness with the hypocotyl secured to a stick; both cotyledons  rose a little at first, and then fell during the rest of the day; in the  evening between 5 and 6 P.M. they moved very slowly; during the night one  continued to fall and the other rose, though only a little. The tracing was  not much magnified, and as the lines were plainly zigzag, the cotyledons  must have moved a little laterally, that is, they must have circumnutated.    The hypocotyl is rather thick, about .12 of inch; nevertheless it  circumnutated in a complex course, though to a small extent. The movement  of an old seedling with two true leaves partially developed, was observed  in the dark. As the movement was magnified about 100 times it is not  trustworthy and is not given; but there could be no doubt that the  hypocotyl moved in all directions during the day, changing its course 19  times. The extreme actual distance from side to side through which the  upper part of the hypocotyl passed in the course of 14 ½ hours was only  1/60 of an inch; it sometimes travelled at the rate of 1/50 of an inch in  an hour.    Cucurbita ovifera (Cucurbitaceae).--Radicle: a seed which had    Fig. 26. Cucurbita ovifera: course followed by a radicle in bending  geotropically downwards, traced on a horizontal glass, between 11.25 A.M.  and 10.25 P.M.; the direction during the night is indicated by the broken  line. Movement of bead magnified 14 times.    germinated on damp sand was fixed so that the slightly curved radicle,  which was only .07 inch in length, stood almost vertically  [page 39]  upwards, in which position geotropism would act at first with little power.  A filament was attached near to its base, and projected at about an angle  of 45o above the horizon. The general course followed during the 11 hours  of observation and during the following night is shown in the accompanying  diagram (Fig. 26), and was plainly due to geotropism; but it was also clear  that the radicle circumnutated. By the next morning the tip had curved so  much downwards that the filament, instead of projecting at 45o above the  horizon, was nearly horizontal. Another germinating seed was turned upside  down and covered with damp sand; and a filament was fastened to the radicle  so as to project at an angle of about 50o above the horizon; this radicle  was .35 of an inch in length and a little curved. The course pursued was  mainly governed, as in the last case, by geotropism, but the line traced  during 12 hours and magnified as before was more strongly zigzag, again  showing circumnutation.    Four radicles were allowed to grow downwards over plates of smoked glass,  inclined at 70o to the horizon, under the    Fig. 27. Cucurbita ovifera: tracks left by tips of radicles in growing  downwards over smoked glass-plates, inclined at 70o to the horizon.    Fig. 28. Cucurbita ovifera: circumnutation of arched hypocotyl at a very  early age, traced in darkness on a horizontal glass, from 8 A.M. to 10.20  A.M. on the following day. The movement of the bead magnified 20 times,  here reduced to one-half of original scale.    same conditions as in the cases of Aesculus, Phaseolus, and Vicia.  Facsimiles are here given (Fig. 27) of two of these tracks; and a third  short one was almost as plainly serpentine as that at A. It was also  manifest by a greater or less amount of soot having been swept off the  glasses, that the tips had  [page 40]  pressed alternately with greater and less force on them. There must,  therefore, have been movement in at least two planes at right angles to one  another. These radicles were so delicate that they rarely had the power to  sweep the glasses quite clean. One of them had developed some lateral or  secondary rootlets, which projected a few degrees beneath the horizon; and  it is an important fact that three of them left distinctly serpentine  tracks on the smoked surface, showing beyond doubt that they had  circumnutated like the main or primary radicle. But the tracks were so  slight that they could not be traced and copied after the smoked surface  had been varnished.    Fig. 29. Cucurbita ovifera: circumnutation of straight and vertical  hypocotyl, with filament fastened transversely across its upper end, traced  in darkness on a horizontal glass, from 8.30 A.M. to 8.30 P.M. The movement  of the terminal bead originally magnified about 18 times, here only 4 ½  times.    Hypocotyl.--A seed lying on damp sand was firmly fixed by two crossed wires  and by its own growing radicle. The cotyledons were still enclosed within  the seed-coats; and the short hypocotyl, between the summit of the radicle  and the cotyledons, was as yet only slightly arched. A filament (.85 of  inch in length) was attached at an angle of 35o above the horizon to the  side of the arch adjoining the cotyledons. This part would ultimately form  the upper end of the hypocotyl, after it had grown straight and vertical.  Had the seed been properly planted, the hypocotyl at this stage of growth  would have been deeply buried beneath the surface. The course followed by  the bead of the filament is shown in Fig. 28. The chief lines of movement  from left to right in the figure were parallel to the plane of the two  united cotyledons and of the flattened seed; and this movement would aid in  dragging them out of the seed-coats, which are held down by a special  structure hereafter to be described. The movement at right angles to the  above lines was due to the arched hypocotyl becoming more arched as it  increased in height. The foregoing observations apply to the leg of the  arch next to the cotyledons, but  [page 41]  the other leg adjoining the radicle likewise circumnutated at an equally  early age.    The movement of the same hypocotyl after it had become straight and  vertical, but with the cotyledons only partially expanded, is shown in Fig.  29. The course pursued during 12 h. apparently represents four and a half  ellipses or ovals, with the longer axis of the first at nearly right angles  to that of the others. The longer axes of all were oblique to a line  joining the opposite cotyledons. The actual extreme distance from side to  side over which the summit of the tall hypocotyl passed in the course of 12  h. was .28 of an inch. The original figure was traced on a large scale, and  from the obliquity of the line of view the outer parts of the diagram are  much exaggerated.    Cotyledons.--On two occasions the movements of the cotyledons were traced  on a vertical glass, and as the ascending and descending lines did not  quite coincide, very narrow ellipses were formed; they therefore  circumnutated. Whilst young they rise vertically up at night, but their  tips always remain reflexed; on the following morning they sink down again.  With a seedling kept in complete darkness they moved in the same manner,  for they sank from 8.45 A.M. to 4.30 P.M.; they then began to rise and  remained close together until 10 P.M., when they were last observed. At 7  A.M. on the following morning they were as much expanded as at any hour on  the previous day. The cotyledons of another young seedling, exposed to the  light, were fully open for the first time on a certain day, but were found  completely closed at 7 A.M. on the following morning. They soon began to  expand again, and continued doing so till about 5 P.M.; they then began to  rise, and by 10.30 P.M. stood vertically and were almost closed. At 7 A.M.  on the third morning they were nearly vertical, and again expanded during  the day; on the fourth morning they were not closed, yet they opened a  little in the course of the day and rose a little on the following night.  By this time a minute true leaf had become developed. Another seedling,  still older, bearing a well-developed leaf, had a sharp rigid filament  affixed to one of its cotyledons (85 mm. in length), which recorded its own  movements on a revolving drum with smoked paper. The observations were made  in the hot-house, where the plant had lived, so that there was no change in  temperature or light. The record commenced at 11 A.M. on February 18th; and  from this hour till 3 P.M. the  [page 42]  cotyledon fell; it then rose rapidly till 9 P.M., then very gradually till  3 A.M. February 19th, after which hour it sank gradually till 4.30 P.M.;  but the downward movement was interrupted by one slight rise or oscillation  about 1.30 P.M. After 4.30 P.M. (19th) the cotyledon rose till 1 A.M. (in  the night of February 20th) and then sank very gradually till 9.30 A.M.,  when our observations ceased. The amount of movement was greater on the  18th than on the 19th or on the morning of the 20th.    Cucurbita aurantia.--An arched hypocotyl was found buried a little beneath  the surface of the soil; and in order to prevent it straightening itself  quickly, when relieved from the surrounding pressure of the soil, the two  legs of the arch were tied together. The seed was then lightly covered with  loose damp earth. A filament with a bead at the end was affixed to the  basal leg, the movements of which were observed during two days in the  usual manner. On the first day the arch moved in a zigzag line towards the  side of the basal leg. On the next day, by which time the dependent  cotyledons had been dragged above the surface of the soil, the tied arch  changed its course"]]]
