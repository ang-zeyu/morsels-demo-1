Not knowing how small was the force  that had entered the town, but hoping only that deliverers had  arrived, numbers of the burghers rose and armed themselves, and  issued forth into the streets to aid their countrymen. Wallace soon  arrived at the governor's house, and with a few blows with his axe  broke in the door; then he and his followers rushed into the house,  cutting down the frightened men as they started up with sudden  alarm, until he met Sir John Hazelrig, who had snatched up his arms  and hurried from his chamber.    \"Villain!\" Wallace exclaimed, seizing him by his throat; \"your time  has come to make atonement for the murder of my wife.\"    Then dragging him into the street he called upon the burghers,  who were running up, to witness the execution of their tyrant,  and stepping back a pace smote off his head with his sword. Young  Hazelrig was also killed, as were all soldiers found in the house.  The alarm bells were ringing now, and in a few minutes the armed  burghers swarmed in the street. As the English soldiers, as yet  but scarce awake, and bewildered by this sudden attack, hurried  from their houses, they were fallen upon and slain by Wallace and  the townspeople. Some of those in the larger houses issuing forth  together were able to cut their way through and to make their  escape by the gates; many made for the walls, and dropping in the  moat swam across and escaped; but two hundred and fifty of their  number were left dead in the streets. The town, once cleared of the  English, gave itself up to wild rejoicings; bonfires were lighted  in the streets, the bells were rung, and the wives and daughters  of the citizens issued out to join in their rejoicing and applaud  their liberators.    Wallace held council at once with the chief burghers.  Their talk  was a grave one, for though rejoicing in the liberation of the city,  they could not but perceive that the situation was a serious one.  By the defeat and destruction of the garrison, and the slaying of  the governor, the town would bring upon itself the terrible wrath  of King Edward, and of what he was capable the murdered thousands  at Berwick sufficiently attested. However, the die was cast and there  was no drawing back, and the burghers undertook to put their town  in a state of full defence, to furnish a contingent of men-at-arms to  Wallace, and to raise a considerable sum of money to aid him in the  carrying on of the war; while he on his part undertook to endeavour,  as fast as possible, to prevent the English from concentrating their  forces for a siege of the town, by so harassing their garrisons  elsewhere that none would be able to spare troops for any general  purposes.    Proclamations were immediately made out in the name of Wallace,  and were sent off by mounted messengers throughout the country.  In these he announced to the people of Scotland that he had raised  the national banner and had commenced a war for the freeing of the  country from the English, and that as a first step he had captured  Lanark. He called upon all true Scotchmen to rally round him.    While the council was being held, the wives of the burghers had  taken the body of Marion from the place where it had been cast,  and where hitherto none had dared to touch it, and had prepared it  for burial, placing it in a stone coffin, such as were in use in  those days, upon a car which was covered with trappings of white and  green boughs.  Soon after daybreak a great procession was formed,  and accompanied by all the matrons and maids of Lanark the body  was conveyed to the church at Ellerslie, and there buried with  the rites of the church. This sad duty ended, Wallace mounted his  horse and rode for Cart Lane Craigs, which he had named as the  rendezvous where all who loved Scotland and would follow him, were  to assemble. Archie rode first to Sir Robert Gordon's. His uncle  received him kindly.    \"Ah! my boy,\" he said, \"I feared that your wilful disposition would  have its way. You have embarked young on a stormy course, and none  can say where it will end. I myself have no hope that it can be  successful. Did the English rule depend solely on the troops which  garrison our towns and fortresses, I should believe that Wallace  might possibly expel them; but this is as nothing. Edward can march  a hundred and fifty thousand trained soldiers hither, and how will  it be possible for any gathering of Scotchmen to resist these?  However, you have chosen your course, and as it is too late to  draw back now, I would not dispirit you. Take the best of my horses  from the stable, and such arms and armour as you may choose from  the walls. Here is a purse for your own private needs, and in this  other are a hundred pounds, which I pray you hand to Sir William  Wallace. Fighting never was in my way, and I am too old to begin  now. Tell him, however, that my best wishes are with him. I have  already sent word to all my tenants that they are free, if they  choose, to follow his banner.\"    \"You have plenty of pikes and swords in the armoury, uncle; weapons  will be very useful; can I take some of them?\"    \"Certainly, Archie, as many as you like. But your aunt wants you  to ride at once to Glen Cairn, to ask your mother to come over here  and take up her abode till the stormy times are over. The news of  last night's doings in Lanark will travel fast, and she will be  terribly anxious. Besides, as the Kerrs are heart and soul with the  English faction, like enough they will take the opportunity of the  disturbed times, and of your being involved in the rising, to destroy  the hold altogether, seeing that so long as it stands there it is  a sort of symbol that their lordship over the lands is disputed.\"    \"The very thing that I was going to ask you, uncle. My mother's  position at Glen Cairn would always be on my mind.  As to the  Kerrs, let them burn the castle if they will. If the rising fail,  and I am killed, the line will be extinct, and it matters little  about our hold. If we succeed, then I shall regain my own, and shall  turn the tables on the Kerrs, and will rebuild Glen Cairn twice as  strong as before. And now can I take a cart to convey the arms?\"    \"Certainly, Archie; and may they be of service in the cause. You  will, I suppose, conduct your mother hither?\"    Archie replied that he should do so, and then at once made his  preparations for the start. His uncle's armoury was well supplied,  and Archie had no difficulty in suiting himself. For work like  that which he would have to do he did not care to encumber himself  with heavy armour, but chose a light but strong steel cap, with a  curtain of mail falling so as to guard the neck and ears, leaving  only the face exposed, and a shirt of the same material. It was  of fine workmanship and of no great weight, and did not hamper  his movements.  He also chose some leg pieces for wearing when on  horseback. He had already his father's sword, and needed only a  light battleaxe and a dagger to complete his offensive equipment.  Then he took down from the racks twenty swords and as many short  pikes, and bonnets strengthened with iron hoops, which, although  light, were sufficient to give much protection to the head. These  were all placed in a light cart, and with one of his uncle's  followers to drive, he took his seat in the cart, and started for  Cart Lane Craigs.    Here he concealed the arms in a thicket, and then went up to speak  to his leader.    \"May I take ten men with me to Glen Cairn, Sir William? I am going  to fetch my mother to reside with my uncle until the storm is  over. He has sent you a hundred pounds towards the expenses of the  struggle. I want the guard because it is possible that the Kerrs  may be down there. I hear Sir John was carried away, three hours  after the fight, in a litter; it was well for him that he was not  in Lanark when we took it. But like enough this morning, if well  enough to give orders, he may be sending down to Glen Cairn to see  if I have returned, and may burn the hold over my mother's head.\"    \"Certainly,\" Sir William replied. \"Henceforth I will put twenty  men under your special orders, but for today Sir John Grahame shall  tell off some of his own party. Of course they will go well armed.\"    Half riding in the cart and half walking by turns, the party reached  Glen Cairn late in the afternoon. The news of the fall of Lanark  had already penetrated even to that quiet village, and there was  great excitement as Archie and his party came in. One of Wallace's  messengers had passed through, and many of the men were preparing  to join him. Dame Forbes was at once proud and grieved when Archie  told her of the share which he had had in the street fray at Lanark,  and in the capture of the town. She was proud that her son should  so distinguish himself, grieved that he should, at so young an  age, have become committed to a movement of whose success she had  but little hope. However, she could not blame him, as it seemed as  if his course had been forced upon him. She agreed to start early  the next morning.    It was well for Archie that he had brought a guard with him,  for before he had been an hour in the hold a boy ran in from the  village saying that a party of the Kerrs was close at hand, and  would be there in a few minutes. Archie set his men at once to pile  up a barricade of stones breast high at the outer gate, and took  his position there with his men. He had scarcely completed his  preparations when the trampling of horses was heard and a party  of ten men, two of whom bore torches, headed by young Allan Kerr,  rode up. They drew rein abruptly as they saw the barricade with  the line of pikes behind it.    \"What want you here, Allan Kerr?\" Archie said.    \"I came in search of you, little traitor,\" young Kerr replied  angrily.    \"Here I am,\" Archie said; \"why don't you come and take me?\"    Allan saw that the number of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48"],[0,"The 1992 CIA World Factbook (#9)"],[1," world's      four oceans (after Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean)  Coastline:      45,389 km  Disputes:      some maritime disputes (see littoral states)  Climate:      persistent cold and relatively narrow annual temperature ranges;
