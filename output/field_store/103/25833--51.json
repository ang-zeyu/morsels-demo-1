[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/56684"],[0,"The Lectures on Faith (#9)"],[1,"truth shall go before thy  face. Exodus 34:6. Long-suffering and abundant in goodness and truth.  Deut. 32:4. He is the Rock, his work is perfect; for all his ways are  judgment. A God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he. Ps  31:5. Into thy hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O Lord  God of truth.    11. By a little reflection it will be seen, that the idea of the  existence of these attributes in the Deity, is necessary to enable  any rational being to exercise faith in him. For without the idea  of the existence of these attributes in the Deity, men could not  exercise faith in him for life and salvation; seeing that without the  knowledge of all things God would not be able to save any portion of  his creatures; for it is by reason of the knowledge which he has of  all things, from the beginning to the end, that enables him to give  that understanding to his creatures by which they are made partakers  of eternal life; and if it were not for the idea existing in the minds  of men that God had all knowledge, it would be impossible for them to  exercise faith in him.    12. And it is not less necessary that men should have the idea of  the existence of the attribute power in the Deity. For, unless God  had power over all things, and was able, by his power, to control  all things, and thereby deliver his creatures who put their trust in  him, from the power of all beings that might seek their destruction,  whether in heaven, on earth, or in hell, men could not be saved; but  with the idea of the existence of this attribute planted in the mind,  men feel as though they had nothing to fear who put their trust in God,  believing that he has power to save all who come to him, to the very  uttermost.    13. It is also necessary, in order to the exercise of faith in God,  unto life and salvation, that men should have the idea of the existence  of the attribute justice, in him. For without the idea of the existence  of the attribute Justice, in the Deity, men could not have confidence  sufficient to place themselves under his guidance and direction; for  they would be filled with fear and doubt, lest the Judge of all the  earth would not do right, and thus fear, or doubt, existing in the  mind, would preclude the possibility of the exercise of faith in him  for life and salvation. But, when the idea of the existence of the  attribute justice, in the Deity, is fairly planted in the mind, it  leaves no room for doubt to get into the heart, and the mind is enabled  to cast itself upon the Almighty without fear and without doubt, and  with the most unshaken confidence, believing that the Judge of all the  earth will do right.    14. It is also of equal importance that men should have the idea of the  existence of the attribute judgment, in God, in order that they may  exercise faith in him for life and salvation; for without the idea of  the existence of this attribute in the Deity, it would be impossible  for men to exercise faith in him for life and salvation, seeing that  it is through the exercise of this attribute that the faithful in  Christ Jesus are delivered out of the hands of those who seek their  destruction; for if God were not to come out in swift judgment against  the workers of iniquity and the powers of darkness, his saints could  not be saved; for it is by judgment that the Lord delivers his saints  out of the hands of all their enemies, and those who reject the gospel  of our Lord Jesus Christ. But no sooner is the idea of the existence  of this attribute, planted in the minds of men, than it gives power to  the mind for the exercise of faith and confidence in God, and they are  enabled, by faith, to lay hold on the promises which are set before  them, and wade through all the tribulations and afflictions to which  they are subjected by reason of the persecution from those who know not  God, and obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, believing, that  in due time the Lord will come out in swift judgement against their  enemies, and they shall be cut off from before him, and that, in his  own due time he will bear them off conquerors and more than conquerors  in all things.    15. And again, it is equally important that men should have the idea  of the existence of the attribute mercy, in the Deity, in order to  exercise faith in him for life and salvation. For without the idea  of the existence of this attribute in the Deity, the spirits of the  saints would taint in the midst of the tribulations afflictions, and  persecutions which they have to endure for righteousness' sake; but  when the idea of the existence of this attribute is once established  in the mind it gives life and energy to the spirits of the saints:  believing that the mercy of God will be poured out upon them in the  midst of their afflictions, and that he will compassionate them in  their sufferings, and that the mercy of God will lay hold of them and  secure them in the arms of his love, so that they will receive a full  reward for all their sufferings.    16. And lastly, but not less important to the exercise of faith in  God, is the idea of the existence of the attribute truth, in him. For  without the idea of the existence of this attribute the mind of man  could have nothing upon which it could rest with certainty: all would  be confusion and doubt; but with the idea of the existence of this  attribute in the Deity, in the mind, all the teachings, instructions,  promises, and blessings, become realities, and the mind is enabled  to lay hold of them with certainty and confidence: believing that  these things, and all that the Lord has said, shall be fulfilled in  their time; and that all the cursings, denunciations, and judgments,  pronounced upon the heads of the unrighteous will also be executed in  the due time of the Lord: and, by reason of the truth and veracity of  him, the mind beholds its deliverance and salvation as being certain.    17. Let the mind once reflect sincerely and candidly upon the ideas of  the existence of the before-mentioned attributes in the Deity, and it  will be seen, that as far as his attributes are concerned, there is  a sure foundation laid for the exercise of faith in him for life and  salvation. For inasmuch as God possesses the attribute knowledge he  can make all things known to his saints necessary for their salvation;  and as he possesses the attribute power he is able thereby to deliver  them from the power of all enemies; and seeing also, that justice is an  attribute of the Deity, he will deal with them upon the principles of  righteousness and equity, and a just reward will be granted unto them  for all their afflictions and sufferings for the truth's sake. And as  judgment is an attribute of the Deity also, his saints can have the  most unshaken confidence that they will, in due time, obtain a perfect  deliverance out of the hands of all their enemies, and a complete  victory over all those who have sought their hurt and destruction.  And as mercy is also an attribute of the Deity, his saints can have  confidence that it will be exercised towards them; and through the  exercise of that attribute towards them comfort and consolation will  be administered unto them abundantly, amid all their afflictions and  tribulations. And lastly, realizing that truth is an attribute of the  Deity, the mind is led to rejoice amid all its trials and temptations,  in hope of that glory which is to be brought at the revelation of Jesus  Christ, and in view of that crown which is to be placed upon the heads  of the saints in the day when the Lord shall distribute rewards unto  them, and in prospect of that eternal weight of glory which the Lord  has promised to bestow upon them when he shall bring them into the  midst of his throne to dwell in his presence eternally.    18. In view, then, of the existence of these attributes, the faith of  the saints can become exceedingly strong, abounding in righteousness  unto the praise and glory of God, and can exert its mighty influence  in searching after wisdom and understanding, until it has obtained a  knowledge of all things that pertain to life and salvation.    19. Such, then, is the foundation, which is laid, through the  revelation of the attributes of God, for the exercise of faith in  him for life and salvation; and seeing that these are attributes of  the Deity, they are unchangeable--being the same yesterday, to day,  and forever--which gives to the minds of the Latter Day Saints the  same power and authority to exercise faith in God, which the Former  Day Saints had; so that all the saints, in this respect have been,  are, and will be alike until the end of time; for God never changes,  therefore his attributes and character remain forever the same. And as  it is through the revelation of these that a foundation is laid for  the exercise of faith in God unto life and salvation, the foundation,  therefore, for the exercise of faith was, is, and ever will be the  same. So that all men have had, and will have an equal privilege.    _Question_. What was shown in the third lecture?    _Answer_. It was shown that correct ideas of the character of God are  necessary in order to exercise faith in him unto life and salvation;  and that without correct ideas of his character, men could not have  power to exercise faith in him unto life and salvation, but that  correct ideas of his character, as far as his character was concerned  in the exercise of faith in him, lay a sure foundation for the exercise  of it. [§ IV. ¶ 1.]    Q. What object had the God of Heaven in revealing his attributes to men?    A. That through an acquaintance with his attributes they might be  enabled to exercise faith in him so as to obtain eternal life. [§ IV. ¶  2.]    Q. Could men exercise faith in God without an acquaintance with his  attributes, so as to be enabled to lay hold of eternal life?    A. They could not. [§ IV. ¶ 2,3.]    Q. What account "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5669"],[0,"Considerations on Representative Government (#9)"],[1,"will be a bureaucracy, and  persons in training for the bureaucracy, who will be taught at least  some empirical maxims of government and public administration. There  may be, and often has been, a systematic organization of the best  mental power in the country in some special direction (commonly  military) to promote the grandeur of the despot. But the public at  large remain without information and without interest on all greater  matters of practice; or, if they have any knowledge of them, it is but  a _dilettante_ knowledge, like that which people have of the  mechanical arts who have never handled a tool. Nor is it only in their  intelligence that they suffer. Their moral capacities are equally  stunted. Wherever the sphere of action of human beings is artificially  circumscribed, their sentiments are narrowed and dwarfed in the same  proportion. The food of feeling is action; even domestic affection  lives upon voluntary good offices. Let a person have nothing to do for  his country, and he will not care for it. It has been said of old that  in a despotism there is at most but one patriot, the despot himself;  and the saying rests on a just appreciation of the effects of absolute  subjection even to a good and wise master. Religion remains; and here,  at least, it may be thought, is an agency that may be relied on for  lifting men's eyes and minds above the dust at their feet. But  religion, even supposing it to escape perversion for the purposes of  despotism, ceases in these circumstances to be a social concern, and  narrows into a personal affair between an individual and his Maker, in  which the issue at stake is but his private salvation. Religion in  this shape is quite consistent with the most selfish and contracted  egoism, and identifies the votary as little in feeling with the rest  of his kind as sensuality itself.    A good despotism means a government in which, so far as depends on the  despot, there is no positive oppression by officers of state, but in  which all the collective interests of the people are managed for them,  all the thinking that has relation to collective interests done for  them, and in which their minds are formed by, and consenting to, this  abdication of their own energies. Leaving things to the government,  like leaving them to Providence, is synonymous with caring nothing  about them, and accepting their results, when disagreeable, as  visitations of Nature. With the exception, therefore, of a few  studious men who take an intellectual interest in speculation for its  own sake, the intelligence and sentiments of the whole people are  given up to the material interests, and when these are provided for,  to the amusement and ornamentation of private life. But to say this is  to say, if the whole testimony of history is worth any thing, that the  era of national decline has arrived; that is, if the nation had ever  attained any thing to decline from. If it has never risen above the  condition of an Oriental people, in that condition it continues to  stagnate; but if, like Greece or Rome, it had realized any thing  higher, through the energy, patriotism, and enlargement of mind,  which, as national qualities, are the fruits solely of freedom, it  relapses in a few generations into the Oriental state. And that state  does not mean stupid tranquillity, with security against change for  the worse; it often means being overrun, conquered, and reduced to  domestic slavery either by a stronger despot, or by the nearest  barbarous people who retain along with their savage rudeness the  energies of freedom.    Such are not merely the natural tendencies, but the inherent  necessities of despotic government; from which there is no outlet,  unless in so far as the despotism consents not to be despotism; in so  far as the supposed good despot abstains from exercising his power,  and, though holding it in reserve, allows the general business of  government to go on as if the people really governed themselves.  However little probable it may be, we may imagine a despot observing  many of the rules and restraints of constitutional government. He  might allow such freedom of the press and of discussion as would  enable a public opinion to form and express itself on national  affairs. He might suffer local interests to be managed, without the  interference of authority, by the people themselves. He might even  surround himself with a council or councils of government, freely  chosen by the whole or some portion of the nation, retaining in his  own hands the power of taxation, and the supreme legislative as well  as executive authority. Were he to act thus, and so far abdicate as a  despot, he would do away with a considerable part of the evils  characteristic of despotism. Political activity and capacity for  public affairs would no longer be prevented from growing up in the  body of the nation, and a public opinion would form itself, not the  mere echo of the government. But such improvement would be the  beginning of new difficulties. This public opinion, independent of the  monarch's dictation, must be either with him or against him; if not  the one, it will be the other. All governments must displease many  persons, and these having now regular organs, and being able to  express their sentiments, opinions adverse to the measures of  government would often be expressed. What is the monarch to do when  these unfavorable opinions happen to be in the majority? Is he to  alter his course? Is he to defer to the nation? If so, he is no longer  a despot, but a constitutional king; an organ or first minister of the  people, distinguished only by being irremovable. If not, he must  either put down opposition by his despotic power, or there will arise  a permanent antagonism between the people and one man, which can have  but one possible ending. Not even a religious principle of passive  obedience and \"right divine\" would long ward off the natural  consequences of such a position. The monarch would have to succumb,  and conform to the conditions of constitutional royalty, or give place  to some one who would. The despotism, being thus chiefly nominal,  would possess few of the advantages supposed to belong to absolute  monarchy, while it would realize in a very imperfect degree those of a  free government, since, however great an amount of liberty the  citizens might practically enjoy, they could never forget that they  held it on sufferance, and by a concession which, under the existing  constitution of the state might at any moment be resumed; that they  were legally slaves, though of a prudent or indulgent master.    It is not much to be wondered at if impatient or disappointed  reformers, groaning under the impediments opposed to the most salutary  public improvements by the ignorance, the indifference, the  untractableness, the perverse obstinacy of a people, and the corrupt  combinations of selfish private interests, armed with the powerful  weapons afforded by free institutions, should at times sigh for a  strong hand to bear down all these obstacles, and compel a  recalcitrant people to be better governed. But (setting aside the fact  that for one despot who now and then reforms an abuse, there are  ninety-nine who do nothing but create them) those who look in any such  direction for the realization of their hopes leave out of the idea of  good government its principal element, the improvement of the people  themselves. One of the benefits of freedom is that under it the ruler  can not pass by the people's minds, and amend their affairs for them  without amending _them_. If it were possible for the people to be well  governed in spite of themselves, their good government would last no  longer than the freedom of a people usually lasts who have been  liberated by foreign arms without their own co-operation. It is true,  a despot may educate the people, and to do so really would be the best  apology for his despotism. But any education which aims at making  human beings other than machines, in the long run makes them claim to  have the control of their own actions. The leaders of French  philosophy in the eighteenth century had been educated by the Jesuits.  Even Jesuit education, it seems, was sufficiently real to call forth  the appetite for freedom. Whatever invigorates the faculties, in  however small a measure, creates an increased desire for their more  unimpeded exercise; and a popular education is a failure if it  educates the people for any state but that which it will certainly  induce them to desire, and most probably to demand.    I am far from condemning, in cases of extreme exigency, the assumption  of absolute power in the form of a temporary dictatorship. Free  nations have, in times of old, conferred such power by their own  choice, as a necessary medicine for diseases of the body politic which  could not be got rid of by less violent means. But its acceptance,  even for a time strictly limited, can only be excused, if, like Solon  or Pittacus, the dictator employs the whole power he assumes in  removing the obstacles which debar the nation from the enjoyment of  freedom. A good despotism is an altogether false ideal, which  practically (except as a means to some temporary purpose) becomes the  most senseless and dangerous of chimeras. Evil for evil, a good  despotism, in a country at all advanced in civilization, is more  noxious than a bad one, for it is far more relaxing and enervating to  the thoughts, feelings, and energies of the people. The despotism of  Augustus prepared the Romans for Tiberius. If the whole tone of their  character had not first been prostrated by nearly two generations of  that mild slavery, they would probably have had spirit enough left to  rebel against the more odious one.    There is no difficulty in showing that the ideally best form of  government is that in which the sovereignty, or supreme controlling  power in the last resort, "]]]
