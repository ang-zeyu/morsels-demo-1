(#9)"],[1,"torrid Indian clime, the son  Of Ammon saw upon his warrior band  Descending, solid flames, that to the ground  Came down: whence he bethought him with his troop  To trample on the soil; for easier thus  The vapour was extinguish'd, while alone;  So fell the eternal fiery flood, wherewith  The marble glow'd underneath, as under stove  The viands, doubly to augment the pain.    Unceasing was the play of wretched hands,  Now this, now that way glancing, to shake off  The heat, still falling fresh.  I thus began:  \"Instructor! thou who all things overcom'st,  Except the hardy demons, that rush'd forth  To stop our entrance at the gate, say who  Is yon huge spirit, that, as seems, heeds not  The burning, but lies writhen in proud scorn,  As by the sultry tempest immatur'd?\"    Straight he himself, who was aware I ask'd  My guide of him, exclaim'd: \"Such as I was  When living, dead such now I am.  If Jove  Weary his workman out, from whom in ire  He snatch'd the lightnings, that at my last day  Transfix'd me, if the rest be weary out  At their black smithy labouring by turns  In Mongibello, while he cries aloud;  \"Help, help, good Mulciber!\" as erst he cried  In the Phlegraean warfare, and the bolts  Launch he full aim'd at me with all his might,  He never should enjoy a sweet revenge.\"    Then thus my guide, in accent higher rais'd  Than I before had heard him: \"Capaneus!  Thou art more punish'd, in that this thy pride  Lives yet unquench'd: no torrent, save thy rage,  Were to thy fury pain proportion'd full.\"    Next turning round to me with milder lip  He spake: \"This of the seven kings was one,  Who girt the Theban walls with siege, and held,  As still he seems to hold, God in disdain,  And sets his high omnipotence at nought.  But, as I told him, his despiteful mood  Is ornament well suits the breast that wears it.  Follow me now; and look thou set not yet  Thy foot in the hot sand, but to the wood  Keep ever close.\"  Silently on we pass'd  To where there gushes from the forest's bound  A little brook, whose crimson'd wave yet lifts  My hair with horror.  As the rill, that runs  From Bulicame, to be portion'd out  Among the sinful women; so ran this  Down through the sand, its bottom and each bank  Stone-built, and either margin at its side,  Whereon I straight perceiv'd our passage lay.    \"Of all that I have shown thee, since that gate  We enter'd first, whose threshold is to none  Denied, nought else so worthy of regard,  As is this river, has thine eye discern'd,  O'er which the flaming volley all is quench'd.\"    So spake my guide; and I him thence besought,  That having giv'n me appetite to know,  The food he too would give, that hunger crav'd.    \"In midst of ocean,\" forthwith he began,  \"A desolate country lies, which Crete is nam'd,  Under whose monarch in old times the world  Liv'd pure and chaste.  A mountain rises there,  Call'd Ida, joyous once with leaves and streams,  Deserted now like a forbidden thing.  It was the spot which Rhea, Saturn's spouse,  Chose for the secret cradle of her son;  And better to conceal him, drown'd in shouts  His infant cries.  Within the mount, upright  An ancient form there stands and huge, that turns  His shoulders towards Damiata, and at Rome  As in his mirror looks.  Of finest gold  His head is shap'd, pure silver are the breast  And arms; thence to the middle is of brass.  And downward all beneath well-temper'd steel,  Save the right foot of potter's clay, on which  Than on the other more erect he stands,  Each part except the gold, is rent throughout;  And from the fissure tears distil, which join'd  Penetrate to that cave.  They in their course  Thus far precipitated down the rock  Form Acheron, and Styx, and Phlegethon;  Then by this straiten'd channel passing hence  Beneath, e'en to the lowest depth of all,  Form there Cocytus, of whose lake (thyself  Shall see it) I here give thee no account.\"    Then I to him: \"If from our world this sluice  Be thus deriv'd; wherefore to us but now  Appears it at this edge?\"  He straight replied:  \"The place, thou know'st, is round; and though great part  Thou have already pass'd, still to the left  Descending to the nethermost, not yet  Hast thou the circuit made of the whole orb.  Wherefore if aught of new to us appear,  It needs not bring up wonder in thy looks.\"    Then I again inquir'd: \"Where flow the streams  Of Phlegethon and Lethe? for of one  Thou tell'st not, and the other of that shower,  Thou say'st, is form'd.\"  He answer thus return'd:  \"Doubtless thy questions all well pleas'd I hear.  Yet the red seething wave might have resolv'd  One thou proposest.  Lethe thou shalt see,  But not within this hollow, in the place,  Whither to lave themselves the spirits go,  Whose blame hath been by penitence remov'd.\"  He added: \"Time is now we quit the wood.  Look thou my steps pursue: the margins give  Safe passage, unimpeded by the flames;  For over them all vapour is extinct.\"          CANTO XV    One of the solid margins bears us now  Envelop'd in the mist, that from the stream  Arising, hovers o'er, and saves from fire  Both piers and water.  As the Flemings rear  Their mound, 'twixt Ghent and Bruges, to chase back  The ocean, fearing his tumultuous tide  That drives toward them, or the Paduans theirs  Along the Brenta, to defend their towns  And castles, ere the genial warmth be felt  On Chiarentana's top; such were the mounds,  So fram'd, though not in height or bulk to these  Made equal, by the master, whosoe'er  He was, that rais'd them here.  We from the wood  Were not so far remov'd, that turning round  I might not have discern'd it, when we met  A troop of spirits, who came beside the pier.    They each one ey'd us, as at eventide  One eyes another under a new moon,  And toward us sharpen'd their sight as keen,  As an old tailor at his needle's eye.    Thus narrowly explor'd by all the tribe,  I was agniz'd of one, who by the skirt  Caught me, and cried, \"What wonder have we here!\"    And I, when he to me outstretch'd his arm,  Intently fix'd my ken on his parch'd looks,  That although smirch'd with fire, they hinder'd not  But I remember'd him; and towards his face  My hand inclining, answer'd: \"Sir!  Brunetto!    \"And art thou here?\"  He thus to me: \"My son!  Oh let it not displease thee, if Brunetto  Latini but a little space with thee  Turn back, and leave his fellows to proceed.\"    I thus to him replied: \"Much as I can,  I thereto pray thee; and if thou be willing,  That I here seat me with thee, I consent;  His leave, with whom I journey, first obtain'd.\"    \"O son!\" said he, \"whoever of this throng  One instant stops, lies then a hundred years,  No fan to ventilate him, when the fire  Smites sorest.  Pass thou therefore on.  I close  Will at thy garments walk, and then rejoin  My troop, who go mourning their endless doom.\"    I dar'd not from the path descend to tread  On equal ground with him, but held my head  Bent down, as one who walks in reverent guise.    \"What chance or destiny,\" thus he began,  \"Ere the last day conducts thee here below?  And who is this, that shows to thee the way?\"    \"There up aloft,\" I answer'd, \"in the life  Serene, I wander'd in a valley lost,  Before mine age had to its fullness reach'd.  But yester-morn I left it: then once more  Into that vale returning, him I met;  And by this path homeward he leads me back.\"    \"If thou,\" he answer'd, \"follow but thy star,  Thou canst not miss at last a glorious haven:  Unless in fairer days my judgment err'd.  And if my fate so early had not chanc'd,  Seeing the heav'ns thus bounteous to thee, I  Had gladly giv'n thee comfort in thy work.  But that ungrateful and malignant race,  Who in old times came down from Fesole,  Ay and still smack of their rough mountain-flint,  Will for thy good deeds shew thee enmity.  Nor wonder; for amongst ill-savour'd crabs  It suits not the sweet fig-tree lay her fruit.  Old fame reports them in the world for blind,  Covetous, envious, proud.  Look to it well:  Take heed thou cleanse thee of their ways.  For thee  Thy fortune hath such honour in reserve,  That thou by either party shalt be crav'd  With hunger keen: but be the fresh herb far  From the goat's tooth.  The herd of Fesole  May of themselves make litter, not touch the plant,  If any such yet spring on their rank bed,  In which the holy seed revives, transmitted  From those true Romans, who still there remain'd,  When it was made the nest of so much ill.\"    \"Were all my wish fulfill'd,\" I straight replied,  \"Thou from the confines of man's nature yet  Hadst not been driven forth; for in my mind  Is fix'd, and now strikes full upon my heart  The dear, benign, paternal image, such  As thine was, when so lately thou didst teach me  The way for man to win eternity;  And how I priz'd the lesson, it behooves,  That, long as life endures, my tongue should speak,  What of my fate thou tell'st, that write I down:  And with another text to comment on  For her I keep it, the celestial dame,  Who will know all, if I to her arrive.  This only would I have thee clearly note:  That so my conscience have no plea against me;  Do fortune as she list, I stand prepar'd.  Not new or strange such earnest to mine ear.  Speed fortune then her wheel, as likes her best,  The clown his mattock; all things have their course.\"    Thereat my sapient guide upon his right  Turn'd himself back, then look'd at me and spake:  \"He listens to good purpose who takes note.\"    I not the less still on my way proceed,  Discoursing with Brunetto, and inquire  Who are most known and chief among his tribe.    \"To know of some is well;\" thus he replied,  \"But of the rest silence may best beseem.  Time would not serve us for report so long.  In brief I tell thee, that all these were clerks,  Men of great learning and no less renown,  By one same sin polluted in the world.  With them is Priscian, and Accorso's son  Francesco herds among that wretched throng:  And, if the wish of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8795"],[0,"The Divine Comedy (#9)"],[1,"the body, tendest towards the sky!  For charity, we pray thee' comfort us,  Recounting whence thou com'st, and who thou art:  For thou dost make us at the favour shown thee  Marvel, as at a thing that ne'er hath been.\"    \"There stretches through the midst of Tuscany,\"  I straight began: \"a brooklet, whose well-head  Springs up in Falterona, with his race  Not satisfied, when he some hundred miles  Hath measur'd.  From his banks bring, I this frame.  To tell you who I am were words misspent:  For yet my name scarce sounds on rumour's lip.\"    \"If well I do incorp'rate with my thought  The meaning of thy speech,\" said he, who first  Addrest me, \"thou dost speak of Arno's wave.\"    To whom the other: \"Why hath he conceal'd  The title of that river, as a man  Doth of some horrible thing?\"  The spirit, who  Thereof was question'd, did acquit him thus:  \"I know not: but 'tis fitting well the name  Should perish of that vale; for from the source  Where teems so plenteously the Alpine steep  Maim'd of Pelorus, (that doth scarcely pass  Beyond that limit,) even to the point  Whereunto ocean is restor'd, what heaven  Drains from th' exhaustless store for all earth's streams,  Throughout the space is virtue worried down,  As 'twere a snake, by all, for mortal foe,  Or through disastrous influence on the place,  Or else distortion of misguided wills,  That custom goads to evil: whence in those,  The dwellers in that miserable vale,  Nature is so transform'd, it seems as they  Had shar'd of Circe's feeding.  'Midst brute swine,  Worthier of acorns than of other food  Created for man's use, he shapeth first  His obscure way; then, sloping onward, finds  Curs, snarlers more in spite than power, from whom  He turns with scorn aside: still journeying down,  By how much more the curst and luckless foss  Swells out to largeness, e'en so much it finds  Dogs turning into wolves.  Descending still  Through yet more hollow eddies, next he meets  A race of foxes, so replete with craft,  They do not fear that skill can master it.  Nor will I cease because my words are heard  By other ears than thine.  It shall be well  For this man, if he keep in memory  What from no erring Spirit I reveal.  Lo! behold thy grandson, that becomes  A hunter of those wolves, upon the shore  Of the fierce stream, and cows them all with dread:  Their flesh yet living sets he up to sale,  Then like an aged beast to slaughter dooms.  Many of life he reaves, himself of worth  And goodly estimation.  Smear'd with gore  Mark how he issues from the rueful wood,  Leaving such havoc, that in thousand years  It spreads not to prime lustihood again.\"    As one, who tidings hears of woe to come,  Changes his looks perturb'd, from whate'er part  The peril grasp him, so beheld I change  That spirit, who had turn'd to listen, struck  With sadness, soon as he had caught the word.    His visage and the other's speech did raise  Desire in me to know the names of both,  whereof with meek entreaty I inquir'd.    The shade, who late addrest me, thus resum'd:  \"Thy wish imports that I vouchsafe to do  For thy sake what thou wilt not do for mine.  But since God's will is that so largely shine  His grace in thee, I will be liberal too.  Guido of Duca know then that I am.  Envy so parch'd my blood, that had I seen  A fellow man made joyous, thou hadst mark'd  A livid paleness overspread my cheek.  Such harvest reap I of the seed I sow'd.  O man, why place thy heart where there doth need  Exclusion of participants in good?  This is Rinieri's spirit, this the boast  And honour of the house of Calboli,  Where of his worth no heritage remains.  Nor his the only blood, that hath been stript  ('twixt Po, the mount, the Reno, and the shore,)  Of all that truth or fancy asks for bliss;  But in those limits such a growth has sprung  Of rank and venom'd roots, as long would mock  Slow culture's toil.  Where is good Liziohere  Manardi, Traversalo, and Carpigna?  O bastard slips of old Romagna's line!  When in Bologna the low artisan,  And in Faenza yon Bernardin sprouts,  A gentle cyon from ignoble stem.  Wonder not, Tuscan, if thou see me weep,  When I recall to mind those once lov'd names,  Guido of Prata, and of Azzo him  That dwelt with you; Tignoso and his troop,  With Traversaro's house and Anastagio's,  (Each race disherited) and beside these,  The ladies and the knights, the toils and ease,  That witch'd us into love and courtesy;  Where now such malice reigns in recreant hearts.  O Brettinoro! wherefore tarriest still,  Since forth of thee thy family hath gone,  And many, hating evil, join'd their steps?  Well doeth he, that bids his lineage cease,  Bagnacavallo; Castracaro ill,  And Conio worse, who care to propagate  A race of Counties from such blood as theirs.  Well shall ye also do, Pagani, then  When from amongst you tries your demon child.  Not so, howe'er, that henceforth there remain  True proof of what ye were.  O Hugolin!  Thou sprung of Fantolini's line! thy name  Is safe, since none is look'd for after thee  To cloud its lustre, warping from thy stock.  But, Tuscan, go thy ways; for now I take  Far more delight in weeping than in words.  Such pity for your sakes hath wrung my heart.\"    We knew those gentle spirits at parting heard  Our steps.  Their silence therefore of our way  Assur'd us.  Soon as we had quitted them,  Advancing onward, lo! a voice that seem'd  Like vollied light'ning, when it rives the air,  Met us, and shouted, \"Whosoever finds  Will slay me,\" then fled from us, as the bolt  Lanc'd sudden from a downward-rushing cloud.  When it had giv'n short truce unto our hearing,  Behold the other with a crash as loud  As the quick-following thunder: \"Mark in me  Aglauros turn'd to rock.\"  I at the sound  Retreating drew more closely to my guide.    Now in mute stillness rested all the air:  And thus he spake: \"There was the galling bit.  But your old enemy so baits his hook,  He drags you eager to him.  Hence nor curb  Avails you, nor reclaiming call.  Heav'n calls  And round about you wheeling courts your gaze  With everlasting beauties.  Yet your eye  Turns with fond doting still upon the earth.  Therefore He smites you who discerneth all.\"          CANTO XV    As much as 'twixt the third hour's close and dawn,  Appeareth of heav'n's sphere, that ever whirls  As restless as an infant in his play,  So much appear'd remaining to the sun  Of his slope journey towards the western goal.    Evening was there, and here the noon of night;  and full upon our forehead smote the beams.  For  round the mountain, circling, so our path  Had led us, that toward the sun-set now  Direct we journey'd: when I felt a weight  Of more exceeding splendour, than before,  Press on my front.  The cause unknown, amaze  Possess'd me, and both hands against my brow  Lifting, I interpos'd them, as a screen,  That of its gorgeous superflux of light  Clipp'd the diminish'd orb. As when the ray,  Striking On water or the surface clear  Of mirror, leaps unto the opposite part,  Ascending at a glance, e'en as it fell,  (And so much differs from the stone, that falls  Through equal space, as practice skill hath shown);  Thus with refracted light before me seemed  The ground there smitten; whence in sudden haste  My sight recoil'd.  \"What is this, sire belov'd!  'Gainst which I strive to shield the sight in vain?\"  Cried I, \"and which towards us moving seems?\"    \"Marvel not, if the family of heav'n,\"  He answer'd, \"yet with dazzling radiance dim  Thy sense it is a messenger who comes,  Inviting man's ascent.  Such sights ere long,  Not grievous, shall impart to thee delight,  As thy perception is by nature wrought  Up to their pitch.\"  The blessed angel, soon  As we had reach'd him, hail'd us with glad voice:  \"Here enter on a ladder far less steep  Than ye have yet encounter'd.\"  We forthwith  Ascending, heard behind us chanted sweet,  \"Blessed the merciful,\" and \"happy thou!  That conquer'st.\"  Lonely each, my guide and I  Pursued our upward way; and as we went,  Some profit from his words I hop'd to win,  And thus of him inquiring, fram'd my speech:    \"What meant Romagna's spirit, when he spake  Of bliss exclusive with no partner shar'd?\"    He straight replied: \"No wonder, since he knows,  What sorrow waits on his own worst defect,  If he chide others, that they less may mourn.  Because ye point your wishes at a mark,  Where, by communion of possessors, part  Is lessen'd, envy bloweth up the sighs of men.  No fear of that might touch ye, if the love  Of higher sphere exalted your desire.  For there, by how much more they call it ours,  So much propriety of each in good  Increases more, and heighten'd charity  Wraps that fair cloister in a brighter flame.\"    \"Now lack I satisfaction more,\" said I,  \"Than if thou hadst been silent at the first,  And doubt more gathers on my lab'ring thought.  How can it chance, that good distributed,  The many, that possess it, makes more rich,  Than if 't were shar'd by few?\"  He answering thus:  \"Thy mind, reverting still to things of earth,  Strikes darkness from true light.  The highest good  Unlimited, ineffable, doth so speed  To love, as beam to lucid body darts,  Giving as much of ardour as it finds.  The sempiternal effluence streams abroad  Spreading, wherever charity extends.  So that the more aspirants to that bliss  Are multiplied, more good is there to love,  And more is lov'd; as mirrors, that reflect,  Each unto other, propagated light.  If these my words avail not to allay  Thy thirsting, Beatrice thou shalt see,  Who of this want, and of all else thou hast,  Shall rid thee to the full.  Provide but thou  That from thy temples may be soon eras'd,  E'en as the two already, those five scars,  That when they pain thee worst, then kindliest heal,\"    \"Thou,\" I had said, \"content'st me,\" when I saw  The other round was gain'd, and wond'ring eyes  Did keep me mute.  There suddenly I seem'd  By an ecstatic vision wrapt away;  And in a"]]]
