That Jefferson, when he penned them, foresaw the terrible  results to flow from these specious and pernicious doctrines, is not to  be supposed for an instant; but that his conscience troubled him may be  fairly inferred from the fact that he withheld from the World for twenty  years afterward the knowledge that he was their author.  It is probable  that in this case, as in others, he was a victim of that casuistry which  teaches that \"the end justifies the means;\" that he hoped and believed  that the assertion of these baleful doctrines would act solely as a  check upon any tendency to further centralization of power in the  General Government and insure that strict construction of the  Constitution.    Though afterward violated by himself at the same time that he for the  moment threw aside his scruples touching African slavery, when he added  to our domain the great French Slave Colony of Louisiana--was none the  less the great aim of his commanding intellect; and that he fortuitously  believed in the \"saving common sense\" of his race and country as capable  of correcting an existing evil when it shall have developed into ill  effects.         [Mr. Jefferson takes this very ground, in almost the same words, in       his letter, 1803, to Wilson C.  Nichols in the Louisiana Colony       purchase case, when, after proving by his own strict construction       of the Constitution that there was no power in that instrument to       make such purchase, and confessing the importance in that very case       of setting \"an example against broad construction,\" he concludes:       \"If, however, our friends shall think differently, certainly I       shall acquiesce with satisfaction; confiding that the good sense of       the country will correct the evil of construction when it shall       produce ill ejects.\"]    Be that as it may, however, the fact remains that the seeds thus sown by  the hands of Jefferson on the \"sacred soil\" of Virginia and Kentucky,  were dragon's teeth, destined in after years to spring up as legions of  armed men battling for the subversion of that Constitution and the  destruction of that Union which he so reverenced, and which he was so  largely instrumental in founding--and which even came back in his own  life to plague him and Madison during his embargo, and Madison's war of  1812-15, in the utterances and attitude of some of the New England  Federalists.    The few Free Traders of the South--the Giles's and John Taylor's and men  of that ilk--made up for their paucity in numbers by their unscrupulous  ingenuity and active zeal.  They put forth the idea that the American  Protective Policy was a policy of fostering combinations by Federal  laws, the effect of which was to transfer a considerable portion of the  profits of slave labor from the Slave States to other parts of the Union  where it was massed in the hands of a few individuals, and thus created  a moneyed interest which avariciously influenced the General Government  to the detriment of the entire community of people, who, made restive by  the exactions of this power working through the Federal Government, were  as a consequence driven to consider a possible dissolution of the Union,  and make \"estimates of resources and means of defense.\"  As a means also  of inflaming both the poor whites and Southern slave-holders by arousing  the apprehensions of the latter concerning the \"peculiar institution\" of  Slavery, they craftily declared that \"If the maxim advanced by the  advocates of the protecting duty system will justify Congress in  assuming, or rather in empowering a few capitalists to assume, the  direction of manufacturing labor, it also invests that body with a power  of legislating for the direction of every other species of labor and  assigning all occupations whatsoever to the care of the intelligence of  mercenary combinations\"--and hence untold misery to labor.    They charged as a further means of firing the Southern heart, that this  moneyed power, born of Protection, \"works upon the passion of the States  it has been able to delude by computations of their physical strength  and their naval superiority; and by boasting of an ability to use the  weakening circumstance of negro slavery to coerce the defrauded and  discontented States into submission.\"  And they declared as fundamental  truths upon which they rested that \"The Federal is not a National  Government; it is a league between nations.  By this league, a limited  power only over persons and property was given to the representatives of  the united nations.  This power cannot be further extended, under the  pretext of national good, because the league does not create a national  government.\"    It was the passage of the Tariff of 1824 that gave these crafty Free  Traders their first great success in spreading their doctrine of Free  Trade by coupling it with questions of slave labor, States Rights, and  nullification, as laid down in the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions.  These arguments created great excitement throughout the South  --especially in South Carolina and Georgia--which was still further  increased by the passage of the Tariff of 1828, since declared by  eminent authority to have been \"the highest and most protective ever  adopted in this country.\"         [Mr. Greeley, in his \"History of the American Conflict,\" 1864.]    Prior to the passage of this Tariff Act, excited assemblages met in some  of the Southern States, and protested against it as an outrage upon  their rights--arraying the South in seditious and treasonable attitude  against not only the North but the Union, with threats of Secession.  At  one of these meetings in South Carolina, in 1827, one of their leaders  --[Dr. Thomas Cooper, President of South Carolina College.]--declared that  \"a drilled and managed majority\" in the House of Representatives had  determined \"at all hazards to support the claims of the Northern  manufacturers, and to offer up the planting interest on the altar of  monopoly.\"  He denounced the American system of Protection exemplified  in that Tariff measure as \"a system by which the earnings of the South  are to be transferred to the North--by which the many are to be  sacrificed to the few--under which powers are usurped that were never  conceded--by which inequality of rights, inequality of burthens,  inequality of protection, unequal laws, and unequal taxes are to be  enacted and rendered permanent--that the planter and the farmer under  this system are to be considered as inferior beings to the spinner, the  bleacher, and the dyer--that we of the South hold our plantations under  this system, as the serfs and operatives of the North, subject to the  orders and laboring for the benefit of the master-minds of  Massachusetts, the lords of the spinning jenny and peers of the  power-loom, who have a right to tax our earnings for their emolument,  and to burthen our poverty and to swell their riches;\" and after  characterizing Protection as \"a system of fraud, robbery and  usurpation,\" he continued \"I have said that we shall ere long be  compelled to calculate the value of our Union; and to enquire of what  use to us is this most unequal alliance, by which the South has always  been the loser and the North always the gainer.  Is it worth our while  to continue this union of States, where the North demands to be our  masters and we are required to be their tributaries? who with the most  insulting mockery call the yoke they put upon our necks the 'American  system!'  The question, however, is fast approaching the alternative of  submission or separation.\"    Only a few days after this inflammatory speech at Columbus, S. C.,  inciting South Carolinians to resist the pending Protective Tariff even  to the lengths of Secession, during a grand banquet at Richmond, Va.,  William B. Giles--another Free Trade leader--proposed, and those present  drank a toast to the \"Tariff Schemer\" in which was embodied a  declaration that \"The Southerners will not long pay tribute.\"  Despite  these turbulent and treasonable mutterings, however, the \"Jacksonian  Congress\" passed the Act--a majority of members from the Cotton and New  England States voting against, while the vote of the Middle and Western  Free States was almost solidly for, it.    At a meeting held soon after the enactment of the Tariff of 1828, at  Walterborough Court House, S. C., an address was adopted and issued  which, after reciting the steps that had been taken "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7144"],[0,"While the Billy Boils (#9)"],[1,"straight back to the States as soon as you've  done your business in Christchurch,\" said the bagman, when near their  journey's end they had become confidential.    \"Well, I dunno. I reckon I'll just take a run over to Australia first.  There's an old mate of mine in business in Sydney, and I'd like to have  a yarn with him.\"        A DAY ON A SELECTION      The scene is a small New South Wales western selection, the holder  whereof is native-English. His wife is native-Irish. Time, Sunday, about  8 a.m. A used-up looking woman comes from the slab-and-bark house, turns  her face towards the hillside, and shrieks:    \"T-o-o-m_may_!\"    No response, and presently she draws a long breath and screams again:    \"_Tom_m-a-a-y!\"    A faint echo comes from far up the siding where Tommy's presence is  vaguely indicated by half a dozen cows moving slowly--very slowly--down  towards the cow-yard.    The woman retires. Ten minutes later she comes out again and screams:    \"_Tom_my!    \"Y-e-e-a-a-s-s!\" very passionately and shrilly.    \"Ain't you goin' to bring those cows down to-day?\"    \"Y-e-e-a-a-s-s-s!--carn't yer see I'm comin'?\"    A boy is seen to run wildly along the siding and hurl a missile at a  feeding cow; the cow runs forward a short distance through the trees,  and then stops to graze again while the boy stirs up another milker.    An hour goes by.    The rising Australian generation is represented by a thin, lanky youth  of about fifteen. He is milking. The cow-yard is next the house, and is  mostly ankle-deep in slush. The boy drives a dusty, discouraged-looking  cow into the bail, and pins her head there; then he gets tackle on to  her right hind leg, hauls it back, and makes it fast to the fence.  There are eleven cows, but not one of them can be milked out of the  bail--chiefly because their teats are sore. The selector does not  know what makes the teats sore, but he has an unquestioning faith in a  certain ointment, recommended to him by a man who knows less about  cows than he does himself, which he causes to be applied at irregular  intervals--leaving the mode of application to the discretion of his son.  Meanwhile the teats remain sore.    Having made the cow fast, the youngster cautiously takes hold of the  least sore teat, yanks it suddenly, and dodges the cow's hock. When he  gets enough milk to dip his dirty hands in, he moistens the teats, and  things go on more smoothly. Now and then he relieves the monotony of  his occupation by squirting at the eye of a calf which is dozing in the  adjacent pen. Other times he milks into his mouth. Every time the cow  kicks, a burr or a grass-seed or a bit of something else falls into the  milk, and the boy drowns these things with a well-directed stream--on  the principle that what's out of sight is out of mind.    Sometimes the boy sticks his head into the cow's side, hangs on by a  teat, and dozes, while the bucket, mechanically gripped between his  knees, sinks lower and lower till it rests on the ground. Likely as  not he'll doze on until his mother's shrill voice startles him with an  inquiry as to whether he intends to get that milking done to-day; other  times he is roused by the plunging of the cow, or knocked over by a calf  which has broken through a defective panel in the pen. In the latter  case the youth gets tackle on to the calf, detaches its head from the  teat with the heel of his boot, and makes it fast somewhere. Sometimes  the cow breaks or loosens the leg-rope and gets her leg into the bucket  and then the youth clings desperately to the pail and hopes she'll get  her hoof out again without spilling the milk. Sometimes she does, more  often she doesn't--it depends on the strength of the boy and the pail  and on the strategy of the former. Anyway, the boy will lam the cow down  with a jagged yard shovel, let her out, and bail up another.    When he considers that he has finished milking he lets the cows out  with their calves and carries the milk down to the dairy, where he has  a heated argument with his mother, who--judging from the quantity of  milk--has reason to believe that he has slummed some of the milkers.  This he indignantly denies, telling her she knows very well the cows are  going dry.    The dairy is built of rotten box bark--though there is plenty of good  stringy-bark within easy distance--and the structure looks as if it  wants to lie down and is only prevented by three crooked props on the  leaning side; more props will soon be needed in the rear for the dairy  shows signs of going in that direction. The milk is set in dishes made  of kerosene-tins, cut in halves, which are placed on bark shelves fitted  round against the walls. The shelves are not level and the dishes are  brought to a comparatively horizontal position by means of chips and  bits of bark, inserted under the lower side. The milk is covered by  soiled sheets of old newspapers supported on sticks laid across the  dishes. This protection is necessary, because the box bark in the roof  has crumbled away and left fringed holes--also because the fowls roost  up there. Sometimes the paper sags, and the cream may have to be scraped  off an article on dairy farming.    The selector's wife removes the newspapers, and reveals a thick, yellow  layer of rich cream, plentifully peppered with dust that has drifted in  somehow. She runs a forefinger round the edges of the cream to detach it  from the tin, wipes her finger in her mouth, and skims. If the milk and  cream are very thick she rolls the cream over like a pancake with her  fingers, and lifts it out in sections. The thick milk is poured into a  slop-bucket, for the pigs and calves, the dishes are \"cleaned\"--by the  aid of a dipper full of warm water and a rag--and the wife proceeds  to set the morning's milk. Tom holds up the doubtful-looking rag that  serves as a strainer while his mother pours in the milk. Sometimes the  boy's hands get tired and he lets some of the milk run over, and gets  into trouble; but it doesn't matter much, for the straining-cloth has  several sizable holes in the middle.    The door of the dairy faces the dusty road and is off its hinges and has  to be propped up. The prop is missing this morning, and Tommy is accused  of having been seen chasing old Poley with it at an earlier hour. He  never seed the damn prop, never chased no cow with it, and wants to know  what's the use of always accusing him. He further complains that he's  always blamed for everything. The pole is not forthcoming, and so an old  dray is backed against the door to keep it in position. There is more  trouble about a cow that is lost, and hasn't been milked for two days.  The boy takes the cows up to the paddock sliprails and lets the top rail  down: the lower rail fits rather tightly and some exertion is  required to free it, so he makes the animals jump that one. Then he  \"poddies\"-hand-feeds--the calves which have been weaned too early.  He carries the skim-milk to the yard in a bucket made out of an  oil-drum--sometimes a kerosene-tin--seizes a calf by the nape of the  neck with his left hand, inserts the dirty forefinger of his right  into its mouth, and shoves its head down into the milk. The calf sucks,  thinking it has a teat, and pretty soon it butts violently--as calves do  to remind their mothers to let down the milk--and the boy's wrist gets  barked against the jagged edge of the bucket. He welts that calf in the  jaw, kicks it in the stomach, tries to smother it with its nose in the  milk, and finally dismisses it with the assistance of the calf rope and  a shovel, and gets another. His hand feels sticky and the cleaned finger  makes it look as if he wore a filthy, greasy glove with the forefinger  torn off.    The selector himself is standing against a fence talking to a neighbour.  His arms rest on the top rail of the fence, his chin rests on his hands,  his pipe rests between his fingers, and his eyes rest on a white  cow that is chewing her cud on the opposite side of the fence. The  neighbour's arms rest on the top rail also, his chin rests on his hands,  his pipe rests between his fingers, and his eyes rest on the cow. They  are talking about that cow. They have been talking about her for three  hours. She is chewing her cud. Her nose is well up and forward, and her  eyes are shut. She lets her lower jaw fall a little, moves it to one  side, lifts it again, and brings it back into position with a springing  kind of jerk that has almost a visible recoil. Then her jaws stay  perfectly still for a moment, and you would think she had stopped  chewing. But she hasn't. Now and again a soft, easy, smooth-going  swallow passes visibly along her clean, white throat and disappears. She  chews again, and by and by she loses consciousness and forgets to chew.  She never opens her eyes. She is young and in good condition; she has  had enough to eat, the sun is just properly warm for her, and--well, if  an animal can be really happy, she ought to be.    Presently the two men drag themselves away from the fence, fill their  pipes, and go to have a look at some rows of forked sticks, apparently  stuck in the ground for some purpose. The selector calls these sticks  fruit-trees, and he calls the place \"the orchard.\" They fool round these  wretched sticks until dinnertime, when the neighbour says he must be  getting home. \"Stay and have some dinner! Man alive! Stay and have some  dinner!\" says the selector; and so the friend stays.    It is a broiling hot day in summer, and the dinner consists of hot  roast meat, hot baked potatoes, hot cabbage, hot pumpkin, hot peas, and  burning-hot plum-pudding. The family drinks on an average four cups of  tea each per meal. The wife takes her place at the head of the  table with a broom to keep the fowls out, and at short intervals she  interrupts the conversation with such exclamations as \"Shoo! shoo!\"  \"Tommy, can't you see that fowl? Drive it out!\" The fowls"]]]
