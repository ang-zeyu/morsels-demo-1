And open proofs of this unto the world  Have been afforded in Parmenides,  Melissus, Bryso, and the crowd beside,  Who journey'd on, and knew not whither: so did  Sabellius, Arius, and the other fools,  Who, like to scymitars, reflected back  The scripture-image, by distortion marr'd.    \"Let not the people be too swift to judge,  As one who reckons on the blades in field,  Or ere the crop be ripe.  For I have seen  The thorn frown rudely all the winter long  And after bear the rose upon its top;  And bark, that all the way across the sea  Ran straight and speedy, perish at the last,  E'en in the haven's mouth seeing one steal,  Another brine, his offering to the priest,  Let not Dame Birtha and Sir Martin thence  Into heav'n's counsels deem that they can pry:  For one of these may rise, the other fall.\"          CANTO XIV    From centre to the circle, and so back  From circle to the centre, water moves  In the round chalice, even as the blow  Impels it, inwardly, or from without.  Such was the image glanc'd into my mind,  As the great spirit of Aquinum ceas'd;  And Beatrice after him her words  Resum'd alternate: \"Need there is (tho' yet  He tells it to you not in words, nor e'en  In thought) that he should fathom to its depth  Another mystery.  Tell him, if the light,  Wherewith your substance blooms, shall stay with you  Eternally, as now: and, if it doth,  How, when ye shall regain your visible forms,  The sight may without harm endure the change,  That also tell.\"  As those, who in a ring  Tread the light measure, in their fitful mirth  Raise loud the voice, and spring with gladder bound;  Thus, at the hearing of that pious suit,  The saintly circles in their tourneying  And wond'rous note attested new delight.    Whoso laments, that we must doff this garb  Of frail mortality, thenceforth to live  Immortally above, he hath not seen  The sweet refreshing, of that heav'nly shower.    Him, who lives ever, and for ever reigns  In mystic union of the Three in One,  Unbounded, bounding all, each spirit thrice  Sang, with such melody, as but to hear  For highest merit were an ample meed.  And from the lesser orb the goodliest light,  With gentle voice and mild, such as perhaps  The angel's once to Mary, thus replied:  \"Long as the joy of Paradise shall last,  Our love shall shine around that raiment, bright,  As fervent; fervent, as in vision blest;  And that as far in blessedness exceeding,  As it hath grave beyond its virtue great.  Our shape, regarmented with glorious weeds  Of saintly flesh, must, being thus entire,  Show yet more gracious.  Therefore shall increase,  Whate'er of light, gratuitous, imparts  The Supreme Good; light, ministering aid,  The better disclose his glory: whence  The vision needs increasing, much increase  The fervour, which it kindles; and that too  The ray, that comes from it.  But as the greed  Which gives out flame, yet it its whiteness shines  More lively than that, and so preserves  Its proper semblance; thus this circling sphere  Of splendour, shall to view less radiant seem,  Than shall our fleshly robe, which yonder earth  Now covers.  Nor will such excess of light  O'erpower us, in corporeal organs made  Firm, and susceptible of all delight.\"    So ready and so cordial an \"Amen,\"  Followed from either choir, as plainly spoke  Desire of their dead bodies; yet perchance  Not for themselves, but for their kindred dear,  Mothers and sires, and those whom best they lov'd,  Ere they were made imperishable flame.    And lo! forthwith there rose up round about  A lustre over that already there,  Of equal clearness, like the brightening up  Of the horizon.  As at an evening hour  Of twilight, new appearances through heav'n  Peer with faint glimmer, doubtfully descried;  So there new substances, methought began  To rise in view; and round the other twain  Enwheeling, sweep their ampler circuit wide.    O gentle glitter of eternal beam!  With what a such whiteness did it flow,  O'erpowering vision in me!  But so fair,  So passing lovely, Beatrice show'd,  Mind cannot follow it, nor words express  Her infinite sweetness.  Thence mine eyes regain'd  Power to look up, and I beheld myself,  Sole with my lady, to more lofty bliss  Translated: for the star, with warmer smile  Impurpled, well denoted our ascent.    With all the heart, and with that tongue which speaks  The same in all, an holocaust I made  To God, befitting the new grace vouchsaf'd.  And from my bosom had not yet upsteam'd  The fuming of that incense, when I knew  The rite accepted.  With such mighty sheen  And mantling crimson, in two listed rays  The splendours shot before me, that I cried,  \"God of Sabaoth! that does prank them thus!\"    As leads the galaxy from pole to pole,  Distinguish'd into greater lights and less,  Its pathway, which the wisest fail to spell;  So thickly studded, in the depth of Mars,  Those rays describ'd the venerable sign,  That quadrants in the round conjoining frame.  Here memory mocks the toil of genius.  Christ  Beam'd on that cross; and pattern fails me now.  But whoso takes his cross, and follows Christ  Will pardon me for that I leave untold,  When in the flecker'd dawning he shall spy  The glitterance of Christ.  From horn to horn,  And 'tween the summit and the base did move  Lights, scintillating, as they met and pass'd.  Thus oft are seen, with ever-changeful glance,  Straight or athwart, now rapid and now slow,  The atomies of bodies, long or short,  To move along the sunbeam, whose slant line  Checkers the shadow, interpos'd by art  Against the noontide heat.  And as the chime  Of minstrel music, dulcimer, and help  With many strings, a pleasant dining makes  To him, who heareth not distinct the note;  So from the lights, which there appear'd to me,  Gather'd along the cross a melody,  That, indistinctly heard, with ravishment  Possess'd me.  Yet I mark'd it was a hymn  Of lofty praises; for there came to me  \"Arise and conquer,\" as to one who hears  And comprehends not.  Me such ecstasy  O'ercame, that never till that hour was thing  That held me in so sweet imprisonment.    Perhaps my saying over bold appears,  Accounting less the pleasure of those eyes,  Whereon to look fulfilleth all desire.  But he, who is aware those living seals  Of every beauty work with quicker force,  The higher they are ris'n; and that there  I had not turn'd me to them; he may well  Excuse me that, whereof in my excuse  I do accuse me, and may own my truth;  That holy pleasure here not yet reveal'd,  Which grows in transport as we mount aloof.          CANTO XV    True love, that ever shows itself as clear  In kindness, as loose appetite in wrong,  Silenced that lyre harmonious, and still'd  The sacred chords, that are by heav'n's right hand  Unwound and tighten'd, flow to righteous prayers  Should they not hearken, who, to give me will  For praying, in accordance thus were mute?  He hath in sooth good cause for endless grief,  Who, for the love of thing that lasteth not,  Despoils himself forever of that love.    As oft along the still and pure serene,  At nightfall, glides a sudden trail of fire,  Attracting with involuntary heed  The eye to follow it, erewhile at rest,  And seems some star that shifted place in heav'n,  Only that, whence it kindles, none is lost,  And it is soon extinct; thus from the horn,  That on the dexter of the cross extends,  Down to its foot, one luminary ran  From mid the cluster shone there; yet no gem  Dropp'd from its foil; and through the beamy list  Like flame in alabaster, glow'd its course.    So forward stretch'd him (if of credence aught  Our greater muse may claim) the pious ghost  Of old Anchises, in the' Elysian bower,  When he perceiv'd his son.  \"O thou, my blood!  O most exceeding grace divine! to whom,  As now to thee, hath twice the heav'nly gate  Been e'er unclos'd?\" so spake the light; whence I  Turn'd me toward him; then unto my dame  My sight directed, and on either side  Amazement waited me; for in her eyes  Was lighted such a smile, I thought that mine  Had div'd unto the bottom of my grace  And of my bliss in Paradise.  Forthwith  To hearing and to sight grateful alike,  The spirit to his proem added things  I understood not, so profound he spake;  Yet not of choice but through necessity  Mysterious; for his high conception scar'd  Beyond the mark of mortals.  When the flight  Of holy transport had so spent its rage,  That nearer to the level of our thought  The speech descended, the first sounds I heard  Were, \"Best he thou, Triunal Deity!  That hast such favour in my seed vouchsaf'd!\"  Then follow'd: \"No unpleasant thirst, tho' long,  Which took me reading in the sacred book,  Whose leaves or white or dusky never change,  Thou hast allay'd, my son, within this light,  From whence my voice thou hear'st; more thanks to her.  Who for such lofty mounting has with plumes  Begirt thee.  Thou dost deem thy thoughts to me  From him transmitted, who is first of all,  E'en as all numbers ray from unity;  And therefore dost not ask me who I am,  Or why to thee more joyous I appear,  Than any other in this gladsome throng.  The truth is as thou deem'st; for in this hue  Both less and greater in that mirror look,  In which thy thoughts, or ere thou think'st, are shown.  But, that the love, which keeps me wakeful ever,  Urging with sacred thirst of sweet desire,  May be contended fully, let thy voice,  Fearless, and frank and jocund, utter forth  Thy will distinctly, utter forth the wish,  Whereto my ready answer stands decreed.\"    I turn'd me to Beatrice; and she heard  Ere I had spoken, smiling, an assent,  That to my will gave wings; and I began  \"To each among your tribe, what time ye kenn'd  The nature, in whom naught unequal dwells,  Wisdom and love were in one measure dealt;  For that they are so equal in the sun,  From whence ye drew your radiance and your heat,  As makes all likeness scant.  But will and means,  In mortals, for the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8801"],[0,"Drum-Taps (#9)"],[1,"off to note the              effect;    Elsewhere I hear the cry of a regiment charging, (the young colonel              leads himself this time with brandish'd sword,)    I see the gaps cut by the enemy's volleys, (quickly fill'd up, no              delay,)    I breathe the suffocating smoke, then the flat clouds hover low              concealing all;    Now a strange lull for a few seconds, not a shot fired on either              side,    Then resumed the chaos louder than ever, with eager calls and orders              of officers,    While from some distant part of the field the wind wafts to my ears a              shout of applause, (some special success,)    And ever the sound of the cannon far or near, (rousing even in dreams              a devilish exultation and all the old mad joy in the depths              of my soul,)    And ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions, batteries,              cavalry, moving hither and thither,    (The falling, dying, I heed not, the wounded dripping and red I heed              not, some to the rear are hobbling,)    Grime, heat, rush, aide-de-camps galloping by or on a full run,    With the patter of small arms, the warning _s-s-t_ of the rifles,              (these in my vision I hear or see,)    And bombs bursting in air, and at night the vari-color'd rockets.          ETHIOPIA SALUTING THE COLOURS.        Who are you dusky woman, so ancient hardly human,    With your woolly-white and turban'd head, and bare bony feet    Why rising by the roadside here, do you the colours greet?      ('Tis while our army lines Carolina's sands and pines,    Forth from thy hovel door thou Ethiopia com'st to me,    As under doughty Sherman I march toward the sea.)      _Me master years a hundred since from my parents sunder'd,    A little child, they caught me as the savage beast is caught,    Then hither me across the sea the cruel slaver brought._      No further does she say, but lingering all the day,    Her high-borne turban'd head she wags, and rolls her darkling eye,    And courtesies to the regiments, the guidons moving by.      What is it fateful woman, so blear, hardly human?    Why wag your head with turban bound, yellow, red and green?    Are the things so strange and marvellous you see or have seen?          NOT YOUTH PERTAINS TO ME.        Not youth pertains to me,    Nor delicatesse, I cannot beguile the time with talk,    Awkward in the parlor, neither a dancer nor elegant,    In the learn'd coterie sitting constrain'd and still, for learning              inures not to me,    Beauty, knowledge, inure not to me-yet there are two or three things              inure to me,    I have nourish'd the wounded and sooth'd many a dying soldier,    And at intervals waiting or in the midst of camp,    Composed these songs.          RACE OF VETERANS.        Race of veterans--race of victors!    Race of the soil, ready for conflict--race of the conquering march;    (No more credulity's race, abiding-temper'd race,)    Race henceforth owning no law but the law of itself,    Race of passion and the storm.          WORLD TAKE GOOD NOTICE.        World take good notice, silver stars fading,    Milky hue ript, weft of white detaching,    Coals thirty-eight, baleful and burning,    Scarlet, significant, hands off warning,    Now and henceforth flaunt from these shores.          O TAN-FACED PRAIRIE-BOY.        O tan-faced prairie-boy,    Before you came to camp came many a welcome gift,    Praises and presents came and nourishing food, till at last among the              recruits,    You came, taciturn, with nothing to give-we but look'd on each other,    When lo; more than all the gifts of the world you gave me.          LOOK DOWN FAIR MOON.        Look down fair moon and bathe this scene,    Pour softly down night's nimbus floods on faces ghastly, swollen,              purple,    On the dead on their backs with arms toss'd wide,    Pour down your unstinted nimbus sacred moon.          RECONCILIATION.        Word over all, beautiful as the sky,    Beautiful that war and all its deeds of carnage must in time be              utterly lost,    That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly softly wash              again, and ever again, this soil'd world;    For my enemy is dead, a man divine as myself is dead,    I look where he lies white-faced and still in the coffin-I draw near,    Bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the              coffin.          HOW SOLEMN AS ONE BY ONE.    (_Washington City, 1865._)        How solemn as one by one,    As the ranks returning worn and sweaty, as the men file by where I              stand,    As the faces the masks appear, as I glance at the faces studying the              masks,    (As I glance upward out of this page studying you, dear friend,              whoever you are,)    How solemn the thought of my whispering soul to each in the ranks,              and to you,    I see behind each mask that wonder a kindred soul,    O the bullet could never kill what you really are, dear friend,    Nor the bayonet stab what you really are;    The soul! yourself I see, great as any, good as the best,    Waiting secure and content, which the bullet could never kill,    Nor the bayonet stab O friend.          AS I LAY WITH MY HEAD IN YOUR LAP CAMERADO.        As I lay with my head in your lap camerado,    The confession I made I resume, what I said to you and the open air I              resume,    I know I am restless and make others so,    I know my words are weapons full of danger, full of death,    For I confront peace, security, and all the settled laws, to unsettle              them,    I am more resolute because all have denied me than I could ever have              been had all accepted me,    I heed not and have never heeded either experience, cautions,              majorities, nor ridicule,    And the threat of what is call'd hell is little or nothing to me;    And the lure of what is call'd heaven is little or nothing to me;    Dear camerado! I confess I have urged you onward with me, and still              urge you, without the least idea what is our destination,    Or whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quell'd and defeated.          DELICATE CLUSTER.        Delicate cluster! flag of teeming life!    Covering all my lands-all my seashores lining!    Flag of death! (how I watch'd you through the smoke of battle              pressing!    How I heard you flap and rustle, cloth defiant!)    Flag cerulean-sunny flag, with the orbs of night dappled!    Ah my silvery beauty-ah my woolly white and crimson!    Ah to sing the song of you, my matron mighty!    My sacred one, my mother.          TO A CERTAIN CIVILIAN.        Did you ask dulcet rhymes from me?    Did you seek the civilian's peaceful and languishing rhymes?    Did you find what I sang erewhile so hard to follow?    Why I was not singing erewhile for you to follow, to understand--nor              am I now;    (I have been born of the same as the war was born,    The drum-corps' rattle is ever to me sweet music, I love well the              martial dirge,    With slow wail and convulsive throb leading the officer's funeral;)    What to such as you anyhow such a poet as I? therefore leave my              works,    And go lull yourself with what you can understand, and with              piano-tunes,    For I lull nobody, and you will never understand me.          LO, VICTRESS ON THE PEAKS.        Lo, Victress on the peaks,    Where thou with mighty brow regarding the world,    (The world O Libertad, that vainly conspired against thee,)    Out of its countless beleaguering toils, after thwarting them all,    Dominant, with the dazzling sun around thee,    Flauntest now unharm'd in immortal soundness and bloom--lo, in these              hours supreme,    No poem proud, I chanting bring to thee, nor mastery's rapturous              verse,    But a cluster containing night's darkness and blood-dripping wounds,    And psalms of the dead.          SPIRIT WHOSE WORK IS DONE.    (_Washington City, 1865._)        Spirit whose work is done--spirit of dreadful hours!    Ere departing fade from my eyes your forests of bayonets;    Spirit of gloomiest fears and doubts, (yet onward ever unfaltering              pressing),    Spirit of many a solemn day and many a savage scene--electric spirit,    That with muttering voice through the war now closed, like a tireless              phantom flitted,    Rousing the land with breath of flame, while you beat and beat the              drum,    Now as the sound of the drum, hollow and harsh to the last,              reverberates round me,    As your ranks, your immortal ranks, return, return from the battles,    As the muskets of the young men yet lean over their shoulders,    As I look on the bayonets bristling over their shoulders,    As those slanted bayonets, whole forests of them appearing in the              distance, approach and pass on, returning homeward,    Moving with steady motion, swaying to and fro to the right and left,    Evenly lightly rising and falling while the steps keep time;    Spirit of hours I knew, all hectic red one day, but pale as death              next day,    Touch my mouth ere you depart, press my lips close,    Leave me your pulses of rage-bequeath them to me-fill me with              currents convulsive,    Let them scorch and blister out of my chants when you are gone,    Let them identify you to the future in these songs.          ADIEU TO A SOLDIER.        Adieu O soldier,    You of the rude campaigning, (which we shared,)    The rapid march, the life of the camp,    The hot contention of opposing fronts, the long manoeuvre,    Bed battles with their slaughter, the stimulus, the strong, terrific              game,    Spell of all brave and manly hearts, the trains of time through you              and like of you all fill'd,    With war and war's expression.      Adieu dear"]]]
