Leaning against the door-post of this, his dwelling, the locksmith  stood early on the morning after he had met with the wounded man, gazing  disconsolately at a great wooden emblem of a key, painted in vivid  yellow to resemble gold, which dangled from the house-front, and swung  to and fro with a mournful creaking noise, as if complaining that it had  nothing to unlock. Sometimes, he looked over his shoulder into the shop,  which was so dark and dingy with numerous tokens of his trade, and so  blackened by the smoke of a little forge, near which his 'prentice  was at work, that it would have been difficult for one unused to such  espials to have distinguished anything but various tools of uncouth make  and shape, great bunches of rusty keys, fragments of iron, half-finished  locks, and such like things, which garnished the walls and hung in  clusters from the ceiling.    After a long and patient contemplation of the golden key, and many such  backward glances, Gabriel stepped into the road, and stole a look at the  upper windows. One of them chanced to be thrown open at the moment,  and a roguish face met his; a face lighted up by the loveliest pair of  sparkling eyes that ever locksmith looked upon; the face of a pretty,  laughing, girl; dimpled and fresh, and healthful--the very impersonation  of good-humour and blooming beauty.    'Hush!' she whispered, bending forward and pointing archly to the window  underneath. 'Mother is still asleep.'    'Still, my dear,' returned the locksmith in the same tone. 'You talk as  if she had been asleep all night, instead of little more than half an  hour. But I'm very thankful. Sleep's a blessing--no doubt about it.' The  last few words he muttered to himself.    'How cruel of you to keep us up so late this morning, and never tell us  where you were, or send us word!' said the girl.    'Ah Dolly, Dolly!' returned the locksmith, shaking his head, and  smiling, 'how cruel of you to run upstairs to bed! Come down to  breakfast, madcap, and come down lightly, or you'll wake your mother.  She must be tired, I am sure--I am.'    Keeping these latter words to himself, and returning his daughter's nod,  he was passing into the workshop, with the smile she had awakened still  beaming on his face, when he just caught sight of his 'prentice's brown  paper cap ducking down to avoid observation, and shrinking from the  window back to its former place, which the wearer no sooner reached than  he began to hammer lustily.    'Listening again, Simon!' said Gabriel to himself. 'That's bad. What in  the name of wonder does he expect the girl to say, that I always catch  him listening when SHE speaks, and never at any other time! A bad habit,  Sim, a sneaking, underhanded way. Ah! you may hammer, but you won't beat  that out of me, if you work at it till your time's up!'    So saying, and shaking his head gravely, he re-entered the workshop, and  confronted the subject of these remarks.    'There's enough of that just now,' said the locksmith. 'You needn't make  any more of that confounded clatter. Breakfast's ready.'    'Sir,' said Sim, looking up with amazing politeness, and a peculiar  little bow cut short off at the neck, 'I shall attend you immediately.'    'I suppose,' muttered Gabriel, 'that's out of the 'Prentice's Garland or  the 'Prentice's Delight, or the 'Prentice's Warbler, or the Prentice's  Guide to the Gallows, or some such improving textbook. Now he's going to  beautify himself--here's a precious locksmith!'    Quite unconscious that his master was looking on from the dark corner by  the parlour door, Sim threw off the paper cap, sprang from his seat,  and in two extraordinary steps, something between skating and minuet  dancing, bounded to a washing place at the other end of the shop,  and there removed from his face and hands all traces of his previous  work--practising the same step all the time with the utmost gravity.  This done, he drew from some concealed place a little scrap of  looking-glass, and with its assistance arranged his hair, and  ascertained the exact state of a little carbuncle on his nose. Having  now completed his toilet, he placed the fragment of mirror on a low  bench, and looked over his shoulder at so much of his legs as could be  reflected in that small compass, with the greatest possible complacency  and satisfaction.    Sim, as he was called in the locksmith's family, or Mr Simon Tappertit,  as he called himself, and required all men to style him out of doors,  on holidays, and Sundays out,--was an old-fashioned, thin-faced,  sleek-haired, sharp-nosed, small-eyed little fellow, very little more  than five feet high, and thoroughly convinced in his own mind that he  was above the middle size; rather tall, in fact, than otherwise. Of his  figure, which was well enough formed, though somewhat of the leanest,  he entertained the highest admiration; and with his legs, which, in  knee-breeches, were perfect curiosities of littleness, he was enraptured  to a degree amounting to enthusiasm. He also had some majestic, shadowy  ideas, which had never been quite fathomed by his intimate friends,  concerning the power of his eye. Indeed he had been known to go so far  as to boast that he could utterly quell and subdue the haughtiest beauty  by a simple process, which he termed 'eyeing her over;' but it must  be added, that neither of this faculty, nor of the power he claimed  to have, through the same gift, of vanquishing and heaving down dumb  animals, even in a rabid state, had he ever furnished evidence which  could be deemed quite satisfactory and conclusive.    It may be inferred from these premises, that in the small body of Mr  Tappertit there was locked up an ambitious and aspiring soul. As  certain liquors, confined in casks too cramped in their dimensions, will  ferment, and fret, and chafe in their imprisonment, so the spiritual  essence or soul of Mr Tappertit would sometimes fume within that  precious cask, his body, until, with great foam and froth and splutter,  it would force a vent, and carry all before it. It was his custom to  remark, in reference to any one of these occasions, that his soul had  got into his head; and in this novel kind of intoxication many scrapes  and mishaps befell him, which he had frequently concealed with no small  difficulty from his worthy master.    Sim Tappertit, among the other fancies upon which his before-mentioned  soul was for ever feasting and regaling itself (and which fancies,  like the liver of Prometheus, grew as they were fed upon), had a mighty  notion of his order; and had been heard by the servant-maid openly  expressing his regret that the 'prentices no longer carried clubs  wherewith to mace the citizens: that was his strong expression. He was  likewise reported to have said that in former times a stigma had been  cast upon the body by the execution of George Barnwell, to which they  should not have basely submitted, but should have demanded him of  the legislature--temperately at first; then by an appeal to arms, if  necessary--to be dealt with as they in their wisdom might think fit.  These thoughts always led him to consider what a glorious engine the  'prentices might yet become if they had but a master spirit at their  head; and then he would darkly, and to the terror of his hearers, hint  at certain reckless fellows that he knew of, and at a certain Lion Heart  ready to become their captain, who, once afoot, would make the Lord  Mayor tremble on his throne.    In respect of dress and personal decoration, Sim Tappertit was no less  of an adventurous and enterprising character. He had been seen, beyond  dispute, to pull off ruffles of the finest quality at the corner of the  street on Sunday nights, and to put them carefully in his pocket before  returning home; and it was quite notorious that on all great holiday  occasions it was his habit to exchange his plain steel knee-buckles for  a pair of glittering paste, under cover of a friendly post, planted most  conveniently in that same spot. Add to this that he was in years just  twenty, in his looks much older, and in conceit at least two hundred;  that he had no objection to be jested with, touching his admiration  of his master's daughter; and had even, when called upon at a certain  obscure tavern to pledge the lady whom he honoured with his love,  toasted, with many winks and leers, a fair creature whose Christian  name, he said, began with a D--;--and as much is known of Sim Tappertit,  who has by this time followed the locksmith in to breakfast, as is  necessary to be known in making his acquaintance.    It was a substantial meal; for, over and above the ordinary tea  equipage, the board creaked beneath the weight of a jolly round of beef,  a ham of the first magnitude, and sundry towers of buttered Yorkshire  cake, piled slice upon slice in most alluring order. There was also  a goodly jug of well-browned clay, fashioned into the form of an old  gentleman, not by any means unlike the locksmith, atop of whose bald  head was a fine white froth answering to his wig, indicative, beyond  dispute, of sparkling home-brewed ale. But, better far than fair  home-brewed, or Yorkshire cake, or ham, or beef, or anything to eat or  drink that earth or air or water can supply, there sat, presiding over  all, the locksmith's rosy daughter, before whose dark eyes even beef  grew insignificant, and malt became as nothing.    Fathers should never kiss their daughters when young men are by. It's  too much. There are bounds to human endurance. So thought Sim Tappertit  when Gabriel drew those rosy lips to his--those lips within Sim's reach  from day to day, and yet so far off. He had a respect for his master,  but he wished the Yorkshire cake might choke him.    'Father,' said the locksmith's daughter, when this salute was over, and  they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9172"],[0,"A Study of Association in Insanity (#9)"],[1,"..17  Hungry--alloyed.......19  Priest--politicians...17  Ocean--sea............
