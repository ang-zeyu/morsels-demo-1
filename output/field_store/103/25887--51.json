[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6932"],[0,"Pictures Every Child Should Know (#9)"],[1," After his father's  death, he urged the young lady so strongly to be his wife that she  consented They were married and her father soon forgave her, but not  so her grandfather, who declared that he never would forgive her, but  he really must have done so from the first, for when he died it was  found that he had left her a little fortune of L4,000. This was about  the same amount the artist had received from his father, so that they  were able to get on very well.    After Constable's marriage he went on a visit to Sir George Beaumont,  and there an amusing incident occurred which is known to-day as the  story of Sir George's \"brown tree.\" It seems that Constable's ideas of  colour for his landscapes were so true to nature that a good many  people did not approve of them, and one day while painting, Sir George  declared that the colour of an old Cremona fiddle was the best model  of colour tone that a landscape could have. Constable's only answer  was to place the fiddle on the green lawn in front of the house. At  another time his host asked the artist, \"Do you not find it very  difficult to determine where to place your brown tree?\" \"Not at all,\"  was Constable's reply, \"for I never put such a thing into a picture in  my life.\"    In painting one picture many times he declared, \"Its light cannot be  put out because it is the light of nature.\" A Frenchman called  attention to one of his pictures thus: \"Look at these landscapes by an  Englishman. The ground appears to be covered with dew.\"    Notwithstanding the little fortune of his wife and himself, Constable  was not quite carefree, because he had to raise a good sized family of  six children so that when his wife's father died and left his daughter  L20,000 he said to a friend: \"Now I shall stand before a six-foot  canvas with a mind at ease, thank God!\" In the very midst of this  happiness, his beloved wife became ill with consumption, and was  certain to die. He no longer cared very much for life and wrote very  sadly:    \"I have been ill, but am endeavouring to get work again, and could I  get afloat upon a canvas of six feet, I might have a chance of being  carried from myself.\" When he became a member of the Royal Academy, he  said: \"It has been delayed until I am solitary and cannot impart it,\"  meaning that without his dear wife to share his good fortune, it  seemed an empty honour to him.    Strange things are told which show how little his work was valued by  his countrymen. After he had become a member of the Academy one of his  small pictures was entered but rejected; nobody knowing anything about  it. It was put on one side among the \"outsiders.\" Finally, one of his  fellow members glancing at it was attracted.    \"Stop a bit! I rather like that. Why not say 'doubtful'?\" Later  Constable acknowledged the picture as his, and then they wished to  hang it, but he refused to let them. Another Academy story is about  his picture \"Hadleigh Castle.\" On Varnishing Day, Chartney, a  brilliant critic, told Constable that the foreground of the picture  was \"too cold,\" and so he undertook to \"warm it,\" by giving it a  strong glaze with asphaltum with Constable's brush which he snatched  from the artist's hand. Constable gazed at him in horror. \"Oh! there  goes all my dew,\" he cried, and when Chartney's back was turned he  hurriedly wiped the \"warmth\" all away and got back his \"dew.\"    Even the amusing things that happened to him, seem to have a little  sadness about them. He wrote to a friend: \"Beechey was here yesterday,  and said: 'Why d--n it Constable, what a d--n fine picture you are  making; but you look d--n ill, and you've got a d--n bad cold!' so,\"  added Constable, \"you have evidence on oath of my being about a fine  picture and that I am looking ill.\"    An illustration of his painstaking and truthfulness to nature is that  he once took home with him from a visit bottles of coloured sand and  fragments of stone which he meant to introduce into a picture; and on  passing some slimy posts near a mill, he said to his host, \"I wish you  could cut those off and send their tops to me.\"    Constable was a loyal friend, the most persistent of men, and several  anecdotes are told of his characteristics. His friend Fisher said to  him:    \"Where real business is to be done, you are the most energetic and  punctual of men. In smaller matters, such as putting on your breeches,  you are apt to lose time in deciding which leg shall go in first.\"      PLATE--THE HAY WAIN    This picture was first called \"Landscape,\" and it was painted in  1821. In his letters about it, however, Constable also called it  \"Noon,\" and others wrote of it as \"Midsummer Noon.\" This tells us what  a wealth of hot sunlight is suggested by the painting.    It shows a little farmhouse upon the bank of a stream, a spot well  known as \"Willy Lott's Cottage.\" The owner had been born there and he  died there eighty-eight years later, without ever having left his  cottage for four whole days in all those years. Upon the tombstone of  Lott, which is in the Bergholt burial ground, his epitaph calls the  house \"Gibeon Farm.\" It was a favourite scene with Constable, and he  painted it many times from every side. It is the same house we see in  the \"Mill Stream,\" another Constable painting, and again in \"Valley  Farm.\" In this last picture he painted the side opposite to the one  shown in the \"Hay Wain.\"    The stream near which the house stands spreads out into a ford, and in  the picture the hay cart, with two men upon it, is passing through the  ford. The horses are decked out with red tassels. On the right of the  stream there is a broad meadow, golden green in the sunlight, \"with  groups of trees casting cool shadows on the grass, and backed by a  distant belt of woodland of rich blues and greens.\" On the right is a  fisherman, half hidden by a bush, standing near his punt.    Constable wrote to his friend, Fisher, \"My picture goes to the Academy  on the tenth.\" This was written on April 1st, 1821. \"It is not so  grand as Tinney's.\" This shows us, that Constable had not vanity  enough to interfere with his self-criticism. Again in a letter written  to him by a friend: \"How does the 'Hay Wain' look now it has got into  your own room again?\" adding that he wished to see it there, away from  the Academy which to him was always \"like a great pot of boiling  varnish.\"    Later Fisher wrote: \"I have a great desire to possess your 'Wain,' but  I cannot now reach what it is worth;\" and he begged Constable not to  sell it without giving him a chance to try once more to raise the  money to buy it. He wrote that the picture would become of greater  value to his children if the artist left it hanging upon the walls of  the Academy, \"till you join the society of Ruysdael, Wilson, and  Claude. As praise and money will then be of no value to you, the world  will liberally bestow both.\"    Later a Frenchman wished to buy it for exhibition purposes, and when  Constable wrote to Fisher of this, his friend replied that he had  better sell it to the Frenchman \"for the sake of the _eclat_ it may  give you. The stupid English public, which has no judgment of its own,  will begin to think there is something in it if the French make your  works national property. You have long lain under a mistake; men do  not purchase pictures because they admire them, but because others  covet them.\"    Finally, the \"Hay Wain\" was sold to the French dealer for L250, and  Constable threw in a picture of Yarmouth for good measure. Later a  friend declared that he had created a good deal of argument about  landscape painting, and that there had come to be two divisions, for  he had practically founded a new school. He received a gold medal for  the \"Hay Wain,\" and the French nation tried to buy it. In the Louvre  are \"The Cottage,\" \"Weymouth Bay,\" and \"The Glebe Farm.\" Elsewhere are  \"Hampstead Heath,\" \"Salisbury Cathedral,\" \"The Lock on the Stour,\"  \"Dedham Mill,\" \"The Valley Farm,\" \"Gillingham Mill,\" \"The Cornfield,\"  \"Boat-Building,\" \"Flatford Mill on the River Stour,\" besides many  others.          IX    JOHN SINGLETON COPLEY        _English School_    1737-1815    A little boy with a squirrel was the first picture that pointed this  artist toward fame and that was painted in England and exhibited at  the Society of Arts.    This American-born Irishman had no family or ancestry of account, but  he himself was to become the father of Lord Chancellor Lyndhurst, and  he did some truly fine things in art.    About the same time America had another painter, Benjamin West, marked  out for fame, but he got his start in Europe while Copley had already  become a successful artist before he left Boston, his native place.    He liked best to paint \"interiors\"--rooms with fine furniture and  curtains, women in fine clothing and men in embroidered waistcoats and  bejewelled buckles.    In 1777 he got into the Royal Academy, and on the whole had  considerable influence on European art. If we study the portraits that  he painted while in Boston, we can get a very complete idea of the  surroundings of the \"Royalists\" at the time of our colonial history.      PLATE--THE COPLEY FAMILY GROUP    In this picture there are seven figures with an open landscape forming  the background. The baby of the family plays, with uplifted arms, upon  grandfather's knee. The mother on the couch, surrounded by her three  other children, is kissing one while another clings to her. Before her  stands a prim little maid, gowned in the fashion of grown-folks of her  day. A little lock of hair falling upon her forehead suggests that  when she was good she was very, very good, and when she was bad she  was horrid! She wears a little cap. At the back is the artist himself  in a wig and other fashions of the time. A great column rises behind  him, forming a part of the architecture or the landscape, one hardly  knows which in so artificially constructed a picture.

Ils sont moins en leurs Cabanes que chez leurs amis....  S'ils ont vn bon morceau, ils en font festin Ã  leurs amis, et ne le  mangent quasi iamais en leur particulier,\" etc.--Relation des Hurons,  1636, 118.    Contrary to the received opinion, these Indians, like others of their  race, when living in communities, were of a very social disposition.  Besides their incessant dances and feasts, great and small, they were  continually visiting, spending most of their time in their neighbors'  houses, chatting, joking, bantering one another with witticisms, sharp,  broad, and in no sense delicate, yet always taken in good part. Every  village had its adepts in these wordy tournaments, while the shrill  laugh of young squaws, untaught to blush, echoed each hardy jest or  rough sarcasm.    In the organization of the savage communities of the continent, one  feature, more or less conspicuous, continually appears. Each nation or  tribe--to adopt the names by which these communities are usually  known--is subdivided into several clans. These clans are not locally  separate, but are mingled throughout the nation. All the members of each  clan are, or are assumed to be, intimately joined in consanguinity.  Hence it is held an abomination for two persons of the same clan to  intermarry; and hence, again, it follows that every family must contain  members of at least two clans. Each clan has its name, as the clan of  the Hawk, of the Wolf, or of the Tortoise; and each has for its emblem  the figure of the beast, bird, reptile, plant, or other object, from  which its name is derived. This emblem, called totem by the Algonquins,  is often tattooed on the clansman's body, or rudely painted over the  entrance of his lodge. The child belongs to the clan, not of the father,  but of the mother. In other words, descent, not of the totem alone, but  of all rank, titles, and possessions, is through the female. The son of  a chief can never be a chief by hereditary title, though he may become  so by force of personal influence or achievement. Neither can he inherit  from his father so much as a tobacco-pipe. All possessions alike pass of  right to the brothers of the chief, or to the sons of his sisters, since  these are all sprung from a common mother. This rule of descent was  noticed by Champlain among the Hurons in 1615. That excellent observer  refers it to an origin which is doubtless its true one. The child may  not be the son of his reputed father, but must be the son of his  mother,--a consideration of more than ordinary force in an Indian  community. [44]    [44] \"Les enfans ne succedent iamais aux biens et dignitez de leurs  peres, doubtant comme i'ay dit de leur geniteur, mais bien font-ils  leurs successeurs et heritiers, les enfans de leurs sÅurs, et desquels  ils sont asseurez d'estre yssus et sortis.\"--Champlain (1627), 91.    Captain John Smith had observed the same, several years before, among  the tribes of Virginia: \"For the Crowne, their heyres inherite not, but  the first heyres of the Sisters.\"--True Relation, 43 (ed. Deane).    This system of clanship, with the rule of descent inseparable from it,  was of very wide prevalence. Indeed, it is more than probable that close  observation would have detected it in every tribe east of the  Mississippi; while there is positive evidence of its existence in by far  the greater number. It is found also among the Dahcotah and other tribes  west of the Mississippi; and there is reason to believe it universally  prevalent as far as the Rocky Mountains, and even beyond them. The fact  that with most of these hordes there is little property worth  transmission, and that the most influential becomes chief, with little  regard to inheritance, has blinded casual observers to the existence of  this curious system.    It was found in full development among the Creeks, Choctaws, Cherokees,  and other Southern tribes, including that remarkable people, the  Natchez, who, judged by their religious and political institutions, seem  a detached offshoot of the Toltec family. It is no less conspicuous  among the roving Algonquins of the extreme North, where the number of  totems is almost countless. Everywhere it formed the foundation of the  polity of all the tribes, where a polity could be said to exist.    The Franciscans and Jesuits, close students of the languages and  superstitions of the Indians, were by no means so zealous to analyze  their organization and government. In the middle of the seventeenth  century the Hurons as a nation had ceased to exist, and their political  portraiture, as handed down to us, is careless and unfinished. Yet some  decisive features are plainly shown. The Huron nation was a confederacy  of four distinct contiguous nations, afterwards increased to five by the  addition of the Tionnontates;--it was divided into clans;--it was  governed by chiefs, whose office was hereditary through the female;--the  power of these chiefs, though great, was wholly of a persuasive or  advisory character;--there were two principal chiefs, one for peace, the  other for war;--there were chiefs assigned to special national  functions, as the charge of the great Feast of the Dead, the direction  of trading voyages to other nations, etc.;--there were numerous other  chiefs, equal in rank, but very unequal in influence, since the measure  of their influence depended on the measure of their personal  ability;--each nation of the confederacy had a separate organization,  but at certain periods grand councils of the united nations were held,  at which were present, not chiefs only, but also a great concourse of  the people; and at these and other councils the chiefs and principal men  voted on proposed measures by means of small sticks or reeds, the  opinion of the plurality ruling. [45]    [45] These facts are gathered here and there from Champlain, Sagard,  Bressani, and the Jesuit Relations prior to 1650. Of the Jesuits,  BrÃ©beuf is the most full and satisfactory. Lafitau and Charlevoix knew  the Huron institutions only through others.    The names of the four confederate Huron nations were the Ataronchronons,  Attignenonghac, Attignaouentans, and Ahrendarrhonons. There was also a  subordinate \"nation\" called Tohotaenrat, which had but one town. (See  the map of the Huron Country.) They all bore the name of some animal or  other object: thus the Attignaouentans were the Nation of the Bear. As  the clans are usually named after animals, this makes confusion, and may  easily lead to error. The Bear Nation was the principal member of the  league.      THE IROQUOIS.    The Iroquois were a people far more conspicuous in history, and their  institutions are not yet extinct. In early and recent times, they have  been closely studied, and no little light has been cast upon a subject  as difficult and obscure as it is curious. By comparing the statements  of observers, old and new, the character of their singular organization  becomes sufficiently clear. [46]    [46] Among modern students of Iroquois institutions, a place far in  advance of all others is due to Lewis H. Morgan, himself an Iroquois by  adoption, and intimate with the race from boyhood. His work, The League  of the Iroquois, is a production of most thorough and able research,  conducted under peculiar advantages, and with the aid of an efficient  co-laborer, Hasanoanda (Ely S. Parker), an educated and highly  intelligent Iroquois of the Seneca nation. Though often differing widely  from Mr. Morgan's conclusions, I cannot bear a too emphatic testimony to  the value of his researches. The Notes on the Iroquois of Mr. H. R.  Schoolcraft also contain some interesting facts; but here, as in all Mr.  Schoolcraft's productions, the reader must scrupulously reserve his  right of private judgment. None of the old writers are so satisfactory  as Lafitau. His work, MÅurs des Sauvages Ameriquains comparÃ©es aux MÅurs  des Premiers Temps, relates chiefly to the Iroquois and Hurons: the  basis for his account of the former being his own observations and those  of Father Julien Garnier, who was a missionary among them more than  sixty years, from his novitiate to his death.    Both reason and tradition point to the conclusion, that the Iroquois  formed originally one undivided people. Sundered, like countless other  tribes, by dissension, caprice, or the necessities of the hunter life,  they separated into five distinct nations, cantoned from east to west  along the centre of New York, in the following order: Mohawks, Oneidas,  Onondagas, Cayugas, Senecas. There was discord among them; wars  followed, and they lived in mutual fear, each ensconced in its palisaded  villages. At length, says tradition, a celestial being, incarnate on  earth, counselled them to compose their strife and unite in a league of  defence and aggression. Another personage, wholly mortal, yet  wonderfully endowed, a renowned warrior and a mighty magician, stands,  with his hair of writhing snakes, grotesquely conspicuous through the  dim light of tradition at this birth of Iroquois nationality. This was  Atotarho, a chief of the Onondagas; and from this honored source has  sprung a long line of chieftains, heirs not to the blood alone, but to  the name of their great predecessor. A few years since, there lived in  Onondaga Hollow a handsome Indian boy on whom the dwindled remnant of  the nation looked with pride as their destined Atotarho. With earthly  and celestial aid the league was consummated, and through all the land  the forests trembled at the name of the Iroquois.    The Iroquois people was divided into eight clans. When the original  stock was sundered into five parts, each of these clans was also  sundered into five parts; and as, by the principle already indicated,  the clans were intimately mingled in every village, hamlet, and cabin,  each one of the five"]]]
