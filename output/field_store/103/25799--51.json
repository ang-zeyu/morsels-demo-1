Her fond mother, feeling as much hurt by the blow as the  Princess herself, uttered such piercing cries and lamentations that  the King, hearing them, entirely lost his courage and presence of mind.  Giving up the combat, he flew toward the Princess, to rescue or to die  with her; but the Yellow Dwarf was too quick for him. Leaping with his  Spanish cat upon the balcony, he snatched Bellissima from the Queen's  arms, and before any of the ladies of the Court could stop him he had  sprung upon the roof of the palace and disappeared with his prize.    The King, motionless with horror, looked on despairingly at this  dreadful occurrence, which he was quite powerless to prevent, and to  make matters worse his sight failed him, everything became dark, and he  felt himself carried along through the air by a strong hand.    This new misfortune was the work of the wicked Fairy of the Desert, who  had come with the Yellow Dwarf to help him carry off the Princess,  and had fallen in love with the handsome young King of the Gold Mines  directly she saw him. She thought that if she carried him off to some  frightful cavern and chained him to a rock, then the fear of death would  make him forget Bellissima and become her slave. So, as soon as they  reached the place, she gave him back his sight, but without releasing  him from his chains, and by her magic power she appeared before him as  a young and beautiful fairy, and pretended to have come there quite by  chance.    \"What do I see?\" she cried. \"Is it _you_, dear Prince? What misfortune  has brought you to this dismal place?\"    The King, who was quite deceived by her altered appearance, replied:    \"Alas! beautiful Fairy, the fairy who brought me here first took away  my sight, but by her voice I recognized her as the Fairy of the Desert,  though what she should have carried me off for I cannot tell you.\"    \"Ah!\" cried the pretended Fairy, \"if you have fallen into _her_ hands,  you won't get away until you have married her. She has carried off more  than one Prince like this, and she will certainly have anything she  takes a fancy to.\" While she was thus pretending to be sorry for the  King, he suddenly noticed her feet, which were like those of a griffin,  and knew in a moment that this must be the Fairy of the Desert, for her  feet were the one thing she could not change, however pretty she might  make her face.    Without seeming to have noticed anything, he said, in a confidential  way:    \"Not that I have any dislike to the Fairy of the Desert, but I really  cannot endure the way in which she protects the Yellow Dwarf and keeps  me chained here like a criminal. It is true that I love a charming  princess, but if the Fairy should set me free my gratitude would oblige  me to love her only.\"    \"Do you really mean what you say, Prince?\" said the Fairy, quite  deceived.    \"Surely,\" replied the Prince; \"how could I deceive you? You see it is  so much more flattering to my vanity to be loved by a fairy than by  a simple princess. But, even if I am dying of love for her, I shall  pretend to hate her until I am set free.\"    The Fairy of the Desert, quite taken in by these words, resolved at once  to transport the Prince to a pleasanter place. So, making him mount  her chariot, to which she had harnessed swans instead of the bats which  generally drew it, away she flew with him. But imagine the distress  of the Prince when, from the giddy height at which they were rushing  through the air, he saw his beloved Princess in a castle built of  polished steel, the walls of which reflected the sun's rays so  hotly that no one could approach it without being burnt to a cinder!  Bellissima was sitting in a little thicket by a brook, leaning her head  upon her hand and weeping bitterly, but just as they passed she looked  up and saw the King and the Fairy of the Desert. Now, the Fairy was so  clever that she could not only seem beautiful to the King, but even the  poor Princess thought her the most lovely being she had ever seen.    \"What!\" she cried; \"was I not unhappy enough in this lonely castle to  which that frightful Yellow Dwarf brought me? Must I also be made to  know that the King of the Gold Mines ceased to love me as soon as he  lost sight of me? But who can my rival be, whose fatal beauty is greater  than mine?\"    While she was saying this, the King, who really loved her as much as  ever, was feeling terribly sad at being so rapidly torn away from his  beloved Princess, but he knew too well how powerful the Fairy was to  have any hope of escaping from her except by great patience and cunning.    The Fairy of the Desert had also seen Bellissima, and she tried to read  in the King's eyes the effect that this unexpected sight had had upon  him.    \"No one can tell you what you wish to know better than I can,\" said  he. \"This chance meeting with an unhappy princess for whom I once had a  passing fancy, before I was lucky enough to meet you, has affected me a  little, I admit, but you are so much more to me than she is that I would  rather die than leave you.\"    \"Ah, Prince,\" she said, \"can I believe that you really love me so much?\"    \"Time will show, madam,\" replied the King; \"but if you wish to convince  me that you have some regard for me, do not, I beg of you, refuse to aid  Bellissima.\"    \"Do you know what you are asking?\" said the Fairy of the Desert,  frowning, and looking at him suspiciously. \"Do you want me to employ my  art against the Yellow Dwarf, who is my best friend, and take away from  him a proud princess whom I can but look upon as my rival?\"    The King sighed, but made no answer--indeed, what was there to be said  to such a clear-sighted person? At last they reached a vast meadow, gay  with all sorts of flowers; a deep river surrounded it, and many little  brooks murmured softly under the shady trees, where it was always cool  and fresh. A little way off stood a splendid palace, the walls of  which were of transparent emeralds. As soon as the swans which drew  the Fairy's chariot had alighted under a porch, which was paved with  diamonds and had arches of rubies, they were greeted on all sides by  thousands of beautiful beings, who came to meet them joyfully, singing  these words:      \"When Love within a heart would reign,         Useless to strive against him 'tis.    The proud but feel a sharper pain,         And make a greater triumph his.\"      The Fairy of the Desert was delighted to hear them sing of her triumphs;  she led the King into the most splendid room that can be imagined, and  left him alone for a little while, just that he might not feel that  he was a prisoner; but he felt sure that she had not really gone quite  away, but was watching him from some hiding-place. So walking up to a  great mirror, he said to it, \"Trusty counsellor, let me see what I can  do to make myself agreeable to the charming Fairy of the Desert; for I  can think of nothing but how to please her.\"    And he at once set to work to curl his hair, and, seeing upon a table a  grander coat than his own, he put it on carefully. The Fairy came back  so delighted that she could not conceal her joy.    \"I am quite aware of the trouble you have taken to please me,\" said she,  \"and I must tell you that you have succeeded perfectly already. You see  it is not difficult to do if you really care for me.\"    The King, who had his own reasons for wishing to keep the old Fairy in  a good humor, did not spare pretty speeches, and after a time he was  allowed to walk by himself upon the sea-shore. The Fairy of the Desert  had by her enchantments raised such a terrible storm that the boldest  pilot would not venture out in it, so she was not afraid of her  prisoner's being able to escape; and he found it some relief to think  sadly over his terrible situation without being interrupted by his cruel  captor.    Presently, after walking wildly up and down, he wrote these verses upon  the sand with his stick:         \"At last may I upon this shore         Lighten my sorrow with soft tears.       Alas! alas! I see no more         My Love, who yet my sadness cheers.         \"And thou, O raging, stormy Sea,         Stirred by wild winds, from depth to height,       Thou hold'st my loved one far from me,         And I am captive to thy might.         \"My heart is still more wild than thine,         For Fate is cruel unto me.       Why must I thus in exile pine?         Why is my Princess snatched from me?         \"O! lovely Nymphs, from ocean caves,         Who know how sweet true love may be,       Come up and calm the furious waves         And set a desperate lover free!\"      While he was still writing he heard a voice which attracted his  attention in spite of himself. Seeing that the waves were rolling in  higher than ever, he looked all round, and presently saw a lovely lady  floating gently toward him upon the crest of a huge billow, her long  hair spread all about her; in one hand she held a mirror, and in the  other a comb, and instead of feet she had a beautiful tail like a fish,  with which she swam.    The King was struck dumb with astonishment at this unexpected sight; but  as soon as she came within speaking distance, she said to him, \"I know  how sad you are at losing your Princess and being kept a prisoner by  the Fairy of the Desert; if you like I will help you to escape from this  fatal place, where you may otherwise have to drag on a weary existence  for thirty years or more.\"    The King of the Gold Mines hardly knew what answer to make to this  proposal. Not because he did not wish very much to escape, but he was  afraid that this might be only another device by which the Fairy of  the Desert was trying to deceive him. As he hesitated the Mermaid, who  guessed his thoughts, said to him:    \"You may trust me: I am not trying to entrap you.

I give Joseph's own account of this visit  to President Van Buren, that our readers may judge of the impression  he made upon the Prophet, and what the Prophet thought of Congress  generally:        On Friday, the twenty-ninth, we proceeded to the house of the      President. We found a very large and splendid palace, surrounded      with a splendid enclosure, decorated with all the fineries and      elegancies of the world. We went to the door and requested to see      the President, when we were immediately introduced into an upper      apartment, where we met the President, and were introduced into his      parlor, where we presented him with our letters of introduction.      As soon as he had read one of them, he looked upon us with a kind      of half frown and said: \"What can I do? I can do nothing for you!      If I do anything, I shall come in contact with the whole State of      Missouri.\" [1]    I cannot determine whether it was on the occasion of this visit that  President Van Buren made use of the expression, \"Your cause is just,  but I can do nothing for you,\" or whether he so expressed himself at  some subsequent meeting. But under date of February 6th, 1840, Joseph  remarks, in speaking of his mission to Washington:        During my stay I had an interview with Martin Van Buren, the      President, who treated me very insolently, and it was with great      reluctance he listened to our message, which, when he heard, he      said: \"Gentlemen, your cause is just, but I can do nothing for      you. If I take up for you, I shall lose the vote of Missouri.\"      His whole course went to show that he was an office-seeker, that      self-aggrandizement was his ruling passion, and that justice and      righteousness were no part of his composition.    As this language is somewhat different to that reported by Joseph on  the occasion of his first visit to the President, I am inclined to the  opinion that the language attributed to him in the latter quotation  was used at some subsequent meeting to the first. I again quote from  Joseph's letter to Hyrum:        Now we shall endeavor to express our feelings and views concerning      the President, as we have been eye-witness to his majesty. He is a      small man, sandy complexion, and ordinary features, with frowning      brow, and considerable body, but not well proportioned as to his      arms and legs, * * * and in fine, to come directly to the point, he      is so much of a fop or a fool (for he judged our cause before he      knew it), we could find no place to put truth into him. We do not      say the Saints shall not vote for him, but we do say boldly, that      we do not intend he shall have our votes.    Joseph speaks very highly of the senators and representatives from  Illinois, who rendered him some considerable assistance in getting a  hearing before a congressional committee, but he was not favorably  impressed with congressmen or their conduct on the whole. He says:        For a general thing there is but little solidity and honorable      deportment among those who are sent here to represent the people,      but a great deal of pomposity and show. * * * There is such an      itching disposition to display their oratory on the most trivial      occasions, and so much etiquette, bowing and scraping, twisting      and turning, to make a display of their witticism, that it seems      to us rather a display of folly and show, more than substance and      gravity, such as becomes a great nation like ours. However, there      are some exceptions.    After the meeting with the President, a meeting with the Illinois  delegation in Congress was arranged, to take into consideration the  best means of getting the wrongs of the Saints before Congress. This  meeting took place on the sixth of December. A Mr. Robinson of that  delegation, whether a member of the House or Senate I do not know,  took a stand against the Saints presenting any claims to be liquidated  by the United States; but Joseph contended against him, and presented  the constitutional rights of the people, and Mr. Robinson promised to  reconsider the subject, and at the meeting the next day it was decided  that a memorial and petition be drawn in concise form and presented  by Judge Young, who had taken a lively interest in the cause of the  Saints. At this stage of the proceedings, Joseph and Judge Higbee  learned that it was necessary to have more positive testimony on the  subject in hand, so that they sent to Nauvoo and a very large number  of affidavits were taken and forwarded to Washington to sustain the  statements to be presented to Congress.    The petition presented to Congress related the outrages committed  against the Saints at considerable length, from the commencement of  difficulties in Jackson County, in the autumn of 1833, until their  final expulsion from the State in the winter of 1838-9; and made  emphatic the infamy of Governor Boggs' exterminating orders, which gave  the coloring of authority for the action of the State mob-militia. They  said in their statement of wrongs that if given an opportunity they  could prove every allegation they made against the State of Missouri.  And that \"neither the Mormons as a body, nor as individuals of that  body, had been guilty of any offense against the laws of Missouri, or  of the United States: but their only offense had been their religious  opinions.\"    In conclusion the petition represents that for the wrongs endured--        The Mormons ought to have some redress; yet how and where shall      they seek and obtain it?        Your Constitution guarantees to every citizen, even the humblest,      the enjoyment of life, liberty and property. It promises to all      their religious freedom, the right to worship God beneath their      own vine and fig tree, according to their own conscience. It      guarantees to all the citizens of the several States the right      to become citizens of any one of the States, and to enjoy all      the rights and immunities of the citizens of the State of his      adoption. Yet of all these rights have the Mormons been deprived.      They have, without a cause, without a trial, been deprived of life,      liberty and property. They have been persecuted for their religious      opinions. They have been driven from the State of Missouri at the      point of the bayonet, and prevented from enjoying and exercising      the rights of citizens of the State of Missouri. It is the theory      of our laws, that for the protection of every legal right, there      is a legal remedy. What, then, we would ask, is the remedy for      the Mormons? Shall they appeal to the legislature of the State of      Missouri for redress? They have done so. They have petitioned,      and these petitions have been treated with silence and contempt.      Shall they apply to the federal courts? They were, at the time,      citizens of the State of Missouri. Shall they apply to the courts      of the State of Missouri? Whom shall they sue? The order for their      destruction, their extermination, was granted by the executive of      the State of Missouri. Is not this a plea of justification for the      loss of individuals, done in pursuance of the order? If not, before      whom shall the Mormons institute a trial? Shall they summon a jury      of the individuals who composed the mob? An appeal to them were in      vain. They dare not go to Missouri to institute a suit, their lives      would be in danger.        For ourselves we see no redress, unless it be awarded by the      Congress of the United States. And we here make our appeal as      _American citizens_, as _Christians_, and as _men_--believing the      high sense of justice which exists in your honorable bodies, will      not allow such oppression to be practiced upon any portion of the      citizens of this vast republic with impunity, but that some measure      which your wisdom may dictate, may be taken, so that the great      body of people who have been thus abused, may have redress for the      wrongs which they have suffered.    The statement of wrongs and petition for their redress was introduced  into the Senate by Judge Young, and referred to the committee on  judiciary of which General Wall was chairman.    At this stage of the proceedings Joseph left Washington and went to  Philadelphia, where he labored in the ministry among the Saints; but  Judge Elias Higbee was left in Washington to look after the interest of  the petitioners before the Senate committee. The subject was held under  advisement and discussed occasionally, until the fourth of March, 1840,  when the committee reported. That report was of a character to crush  forever the hopes of obtaining, at the hands of the general government,  any redress for the outrages perpetrated against them in Missouri.  The report said that after full examination and consideration, the  committee unanimously concurred in the opinion: \"That the case  presented for their investigation is not such a one as will justify or  authorize any interposition of this government.\"    They stated that the wrongs complained of were not alleged to have  been committed by officers of the United States; that the charges were  all against the citizens and authorities of the State of Missouri;  that the petitioners were citizens or inhabitants of Missouri; that  the grievances complained of were committed within the territory of  Missouri; and for these reasons the Senate judiciary committee did \"not  consider themselves justified in inquiring into the truth or falsehood  of facts charged in the petition.\" The committee represented that if  the charges were true, then the petitioners must seek redress in the  courts of judicature, either of Missouri or of the United States,"]]]
