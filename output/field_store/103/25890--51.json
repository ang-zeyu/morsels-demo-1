[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6971"],[0,"Judaism (#9)"],[1," part of the same law of holiness that imposed ritual and moral  purity. Much of the intricate system, of observance briefly summarised in  this paragraph, a system which filled the Jew's life, is passing away.  This is largely because Jews are surrendering their own original theory  of life and religion. Modern Judaism seems to have no use for the ritual  system. The older Judaism might retort that, if that be so, it has no  use for the modern Judaism. It is, however, clear that modern Judaism  now realises the mistake made by the Reformers of the mid-nineteenth  century. Hence we are hearing, and shall no doubt hear more and more, of  the modification of observances in Judaism rather than of their abolition.        CHAPTER VI    JEWISH MYSTICISM      'Judaism is often called the religion of reason. It is this, but it is  also the religion of the soul. It recognises the value of that mystic  insight, those indefinable intuitions which, taking up the task at the  point where the mind impotently abandons it, carries us straight into the  presence of the King. Thus it has found room both for the keen speculator  on theological problems and for the mystic who, because he feels God,  declines to reason about Him--for a Maimonides and a Mendelssohn, but also  for a Nachmanides, a Vital, and a Luria' (M. Joseph, _op. cit._,  p. 47). Used in a vague way, mysticism stands for spiritual inwardness.  Religion without mysticism, said Amiel, is a rose without perfume. This  saying is no more precise and no more informing than Matthew Arnold's  definition of religion as morality touched with emotion. Neither  mysticism nor an emotional touch makes religion. They are as often as not  concomitants of a pathological state which is the denial of religion. But  if mysticism means a personal attitude towards God in which the heart is  active as well as the mind, then religion cannot exist without mysticism.    When, however, we regard mysticism as what it very often is, as an  antithesis to institutional religion and a revolt against authority  and forms, then it may seem at first sight paradoxical to recognise  the mystic's claim to the hospitality of Judaism. That a religion which  produced the Psalter, and not only produced it, but used it with never  a break, should be a religion, with intensely spiritual possibilities,  and its adherents capable of a vivid sense of the nearness of God, with  an ever-felt and never-satisfied longing for communion with Him, is what  we should fully expect. But this expectation would rather make us look  for an expression on the lines of the 119th Psalm, in which the Law is so  markedly associated with freedom and spirituality. Judaism, after all,  allowed to authority and Law a supreme place. But the mystic relies on  his own intuitions, depends on his personal experiences. Judaism, on the  other hand, is a scheme in which personal experiences only count in so  far as they are brought into the general fund of the communal experience.    But in discussing Judaism it is always imperative to discard all  _a priori_ probabilities. Judaism is the great upsetter of  the probable. Analyse a tendency of Judaism and predict its logical  consequences, and then look in Judaism for consequences quite other than  these. Over and over again things are not what they ought to be. The  sacrificial system should have destroyed spirituality; in fact, it  produced the Psalter, 'the hymnbook of the second Temple.' Pharisaism  ought to have led to externalism; in fact, it did not, for somehow  excessive scrupulosity in rite and pietistic exercises went hand in hand  with simple faith and religious inwardness. So, too, the expression of  ethics and religion as Law ought to have suppressed individuality; in  fact, it sometimes gave an impulse to each individual to try to impose  his own concepts, norms, and acts as a Law upon the rest. Each thought  very much for himself, and desired that others should think likewise. We  have already seen that in matters of dogma there never was any corporate  action at all; in ancient times, as now, it is not possible to pronounce  definitely on the dogmatic teachings of Judaism. Though there has been and  is a certain consensus of opinion on many matters, yet neither in practice  nor in beliefs have the local, the temporal, the personal elements ever  been negligible. In order to expound or define a tenet or rite of Judaism  it is mostly necessary to go into questions of time and place and person.    Perhaps, then, we ought to be prepared to find, as in point of fact we  do find, within the main body of Judaism, and not merely as a freak of  occasional eccentrics, distinct mystical tendencies. These tendencies  have often been active well inside the sphere of the Law. Mysticism was,  as we shall see, sometimes a revolt against Law; but it was often, in  Judaism as in the Roman Catholic Church, the outcome of a sincere and  even passionate devotion to authority. Jewish mysticism, in particular,  starts as an interpretation of the Scriptures. Certain truths were arrived  at by man either intuitively or rationally, and these were harmonised  with the Bible by a process of lifting the veil from the text, and thus  penetrating to the true meaning hidden beneath the letter. Allegorical  and esoteric exegesis always had this aim: to find written what had  been otherwise found. Honour was thus done to the Scriptures, though the  latter were somewhat cavalierly treated in the process; Philo's doctrine  (at the beginning of the Christian era) and the great canonical book of  the mediaeval Cabbala, the Zohar (beginning of the fourteenth century),  were alike in this, they were largely commentaries on the Pentateuch.  Maimonides in the twelfth century followed the same method, and only  differed from these in the nature of his deductions from Scripture. This  prince of rationalists agreed with the mystics in adopting an esoteric  exegesis. But he read Aristotle into the text, while the mystics read  Plato into it. They were alike faithful to the Law, or rather to their  own interpretations of its terms.    But further than this,--a large portion of Jewish mysticism was the  work of lawyers. Some of the foremost mystics were famous Talmudists,  men who were appealed to for decisions on ritual and conduct. It is  a phenomenon that constantly meets us in Jewish theology. There were  antinomian mystics and legalistic opponents of mysticism, but many,  like Nachmanides (1195-1270) and Joseph Caro (1488-1575), doubled the  parts of Cabbalist and Talmudist. That Jewish mysticism comes to look  like a revolt against the Talmud is due to the course of mediaeval  scholasticism. While Aristotle was supreme, it was impossible for man  to conceive as knowable anything unattainable by reason. But reason must  always leave God as unknowable. Mysticism did not assert that God was  knowable, but it substituted something else for this spiritual scepticism.  Mysticism started with the conviction that God was unknowable by reason,  but it held that God was nevertheless realisable in the human experience.  Accepting and adopting various Neo-Platonic theories of emanation,  elaborating thence an intricate angelology, the mystics threw a bridge  over the gulf between God and man. Philo's Logos, the Personified Wisdom  of the Palestinian Midrash, the demiurge of Gnosticism, the incarnate  Christ, were all but various phases of this same attempt to cross an  otherwise impassable chasm. Throughout its whole history, Jewish mysticism  substituted mediate creation for immediate creation out of nothing, and  the mediate beings were not created but were emanations. This view was  much influenced by Solomon ibn Gabirol (1021-1070). God is to Gabirol  an absolute Unity, in which form and substance are identical. Hence  He cannot be attributively defined, and man can know Him only by means  of beings which emanate from Him. Nor was this idea confined to Jewish  philosophy of the Greece-Arabic school. The German Cabbala, too, which  owed nothing directly to that school, held that God was not rationally  knowable. The result must be, not merely to exalt visionary meditation  over calm ratiocination, but to place reliance on inward experience  instead of on external authority, which makes its appeal necessarily to  the reason. Here we see elements of revolt. For, as Dr. L. Ginzberg well  says, 'while study of the Law was to Talmudists the very acme of piety,  the mystics accorded the first place to prayer, which was considered  as a mystical progress towards God, demanding a state of ecstasy.' The  Jewish mystic must invent means for inducing such a state, for Judaism  cannot endure a passive waiting for the moving spirit. The mystic soul  must learn how to mount the chariot (Merkaba) and ride into the inmost  halls of Heaven. Mostly the ecstatic state was induced by fasting and  other ascetic exercises, a necessary preliminary being moral purity;  then there were solitary meditations and long night vigils; lastly,  prescribed ritual of proved efficacy during the very act of prayer. Thus  mysticism had a farther attraction for a certain class of Jews, in that  it supplied the missing element of asceticism which is indispensable to  men more austerely disposed than the average Jew.    In the sixteenth century a very strong impetus was given to Jewish  mysticism by Isaac Luria (1534-1572). His chief contributions to the  movement were practical, though he doubtless taught a theoretical  Cabbala also. But Judaism, even in its mystical phases, remains a  religion of conduct. Luria was convinced that man can conquer matter;  this practical conviction was the moving force of his whole life. His  own manner of living was saintly; and he taught his disciples that  they too could, by penitence, confession, prayer, and charity, evade  bodily trammels and send their souls straight to God even during their  terrestrial pilgrimage. Luria "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6980"],[0,"Tales of St. Austin's (#9)"],[1,"may seem superfluous, but  let me tell him that I have left the block in my time, and entered it,  too, though never, it is true, in the company of a master, in other  ways. There are windows.    Our procession of two, Mellish leading by a couple of yards, passed  through the cloisters, and came to the middle block, where the Masters'  Common Room is. I had no particular reason for going to that block, but  it was all on my way to the House, and I knew that Mellish hated having  his footsteps dogged. That Thucydides paper rankled slightly.    In the middle block, at the top of the building, far from the haunts of  men, is the Science Museum, containing--so I have heard, I have never  been near the place myself--two stuffed rats, a case of mouldering  butterflies, and other objects of acute interest. The room has a  staircase all to itself, and this was the reason why, directly I heard  shouts proceeding from that staircase, I deduced that they came from  the Museum. I am like Sherlock Holmes, I don't mind explaining my  methods.    'Help!' shouted the voice. 'Help!'    The voice was Bradshaw's.    Mellish was talking to M. Gerard, the French master, at the moment. He  had evidently been telling him of Bradshaw's non-appearance, for at the  sound of his voice they both spun round, and stood looking at the  staircase like a couple of pointers.    'Help,' cried the voice again.    Mellish and Gerard bounded up the stairs. I had never seen a French  master run before. It was a pleasant sight. I followed. As we reached  the door of the Museum, which was shut, renewed shouts filtered through  it. Mellish gave tongue.    'Bradshaw!'    'Yes, sir,' from within.    'Are you there?' This I thought, and still think, quite a superfluous  question.    'Yes, sir,' said Bradshaw.    'What are you doing in there, Bradshaw? Why were you not in school this  afternoon? Come out at once.' This in deep and thrilling tones.    'Please, sir,' said Bradshaw complainingly, 'I can't open the door.'  Now, the immediate effect of telling a person that you are unable to  open a door is to make him try his hand at it. Someone observes that  there are three things which everyone thinks he can do better than  anyone else, namely poking a fire, writing a novel, and opening a door.    Gerard was no exception to the rule.    'Can't open the door?' he said. 'Nonsense, nonsense.' And, swooping at  the handle, he grasped it firmly, and turned it.    At this point he made an attempt, a very spirited attempt, to lower the  world's record for the standing high jump. I have spoken above of the  pleasure it gave me to see a French master run. But for good, square  enjoyment, warranted free from all injurious chemicals, give me a  French master jumping.    'My dear Gerard,' said the amazed Mellish.    'I have received a shock. Dear me, I have received a most terrible  shock.'    So had I, only of another kind. I really thought I should have expired  in my tracks with the effort of keeping my enjoyment strictly to  myself. I saw what had happened. The Museum is lit by electric light.  To turn it on one has to shoot the bolt of the door, which, like the  handle, is made of metal. It is on the killing two birds with one stone  principle. You lock yourself in and light yourself up with one  movement. It was plain that the current had gone wrong somehow, run  amock, as it were. Mellish meanwhile, instead of being warned by  Gerard's fate, had followed his example, and tried to turn the handle.  His jump, though quite a creditable effort, fell short of Gerard's by  some six inches. I began to feel as if some sort of round game were  going on. I hoped that they would not want me to take a hand. I also  hoped that the thing would continue for a good while longer. The  success of the piece certainly warranted the prolongation of its run.  But here I was disappointed. The disturbance had attracted another  spectator, Blaize, the science and chemistry master. The matter was  hastily explained to him in all its bearings. There was Bradshaw  entombed within the Museum, with every prospect of death by starvation,  unless he could support life for the next few years on the two stuffed  rats and the case of butterflies. The authorities did not see their way  to adding a human specimen (youth's size) to the treasures in the  Museum, _so_--how was he to be got out?    The scientific mind is equal to every emergency.    'Bradshaw,' shouted Blaize through the keyhole.    'Sir?'    'Are you there?'    I should imagine that Bradshaw was growing tired of this question by  this time. Besides, it cast aspersions on the veracity of Gerard and  Mellish. Bradshaw, with perfect politeness, hastened to inform the  gentleman that he was there.    'Have you a piece of paper?'    'Will an envelope do, sir?'    'Bless the boy, anything will do so long as it is paper.'    Dear me, I thought, is it as bad as all that? Is Blaize, in despair of  ever rescuing the unfortunate prisoner, going to ask him to draw up a  'last dying words' document, to be pushed under the door and despatched  to his sorrowing guardian?    'Put it over your hand, and then shoot back the bolt.'    'But, sir, the electricity.'    'Pooh, boy!'    The scientific mind is always intolerant of lay ignorance.    'Pooh, boy, paper is a non-conductor. You won't get hurt.'    Bradshaw apparently acted on his instructions. From the other side of  the door came the sharp sound of the bolt as it was shot back, and at  the same time the light ceased to shine through the keyhole. A moment  later the handle turned, and Bradshaw stepped forth--free!    'Dear me,' said Mellish. 'Now I never knew that before, Blaize.  Remarkable. But this ought to be seen to. In the meantime, I had better  ask the Headmaster to give out that the Museum is closed until further  notice, I think.'    And closed the Museum has been ever since. That further notice has  never been given. And yet nobody seems to feel as if an essential part  of their life had ceased to be, so to speak. Curious. Bradshaw, after a  short explanation, was allowed to go away without a stain--that is to  say, without any additional stain--on his character. We left the  authorities discussing the matter, and went downstairs.    'Sixpence isn't enough,' I said, 'take this penny. It's all I've got.  You shall have the sixpence on Saturday.'    'Thanks,' said Bradshaw.' Was the Thucydides paper pretty warm?'    'Warmish. But, I say, didn't you get a beastly shock when you locked  the door?'    'I did the week before last, the first time I ever went to the place.  This time I was more or less prepared for it. Blaize seems to think  that paper dodge a special invention of his own. He'll be taking out a  patent for it one of these days. Why, every kid knows that paper  doesn't conduct electricity.'    'I didn't,' I said honestly.    'You don't know much,' said Bradshaw, with equal honesty.    'I don't,' I replied. 'Bradshaw, you're a great man, but you missed the  best part of it all.'    'What, the Thucydides paper?' asked he with a grin.    'No, you missed seeing Gerard jump quite six feet.'    Bradshaw's face expressed keen disappointment.    'No, did he really? Oh, I say, I wish I'd seen it.'    The moral of which is that the wicked do not always prosper. If  Bradshaw had not been in the Museum, he might have seen Gerard jump six  feet, which would have made him happy for weeks. On second thoughts,  though, that does not work out quite right, for if Bradshaw had not  been in the Museum, Gerard would not have jumped at all. No, better put  it this way. I was virtuous, and I had the pleasure of witnessing the  sight I have referred to. But then there was the Thucydides paper,  which Bradshaw missed but which I did not. No. On consideration, the  moral of this story shall be withdrawn and submitted to a committee of  experts. Perhaps they will be able to say what it is.          [7]    THE BABE AND THE DRAGON      The annual inter-house football cup at St Austin's lay between Dacre's,  who were the holders, and Merevale's, who had been runner-up in the  previous year, and had won it altogether three times out of the last  five. The cup was something of a tradition in Merevale's, but of late  Dacre's had become serious rivals, and, as has been said before, were  the present holders.    This year there was not much to choose between the two teams. Dacre's  had three of the First Fifteen and two of the Second; Merevale's two of  the First and four of the Second. St Austin's being not altogether a  boarding-school, many of the brightest stars of the teams were day  boys, and there was, of course, always the chance that one of these  would suddenly see the folly of his ways, reform, and become a member  of a House.    This frequently happened, and this year it was almost certain to happen  again, for no less a celebrity than MacArthur, commonly known as the  Babe, had been heard to state that he was negotiating with his parents  to that end. Which House he would go to was at present uncertain. He  did not know himself, but it would, he said, probably be one of the two  favourites for the cup. This lent an added interest to the competition,  for the presence of the Babe would almost certainly turn the scale. The  Babe's nationality was Scots, and, like most Scotsmen, he could play  football more than a little. He was the safest, coolest centre  three-quarter the School had, or had had for some time. He shone in all  branches of the game, but especially in tackling. To see the Babe  spring apparently from nowhere, in the middle of an inter-school match,  and bring down with violence a man who had passed the back, was an  intellectual treat. Both Dacre's and Merevale's, therefore, yearned for  his advent exceedingly. The reasons which finally decided his choice  were rather curious. They arose in the following manner:    The Babe's sister was at Girton. A certain Miss Florence Beezley"]]]
