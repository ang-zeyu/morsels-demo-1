A Cheap Transmitting Set (No. 1).--For this set you will need: (1) a  _spark-coil_, (2) a _battery_ of dry cells, (3) a _telegraph key_, (4)  a _spark gap_, (5) a _high-tension condenser_, and (6) an _oscillation  transformer_. There are many different makes and styles of these parts  but in the last analysis all of them are built on the same underlying  bases and work on the same fundamental principles.    The Spark-Coil.--Spark coils for wireless work are made to give sparks  from 1/4 inch in length up to 6 inches in length, but as a spark coil  that gives less than a 1-inch spark has a very limited output it is  best to get a coil that gives at least a 1-inch spark, as this only  costs about $8.00, and if you can get a 2- or a 4-inch spark coil so  much the better. There are two general styles of spark coils used for  wireless and these are shown at A and B in Fig. 18.    [Illustration: (A) and (B) Fig. 18.--Types of Spark Coils for Set. No.  1.]    [Illustration: (C) Fig. 18.--Wiring Diagram of Spark Coil]    A spark coil of either style consists of (_a_) a soft _iron core_ on  which is wound (_b_) a couple of layers of heavy insulated wire and  this is called the _primary coil_, (_c_) while over this, but  insulated from it, is wound a large number of turns of very fine  insulated copper wire called the _secondary coil_; (d) an  _interrupter_, or _vibrator_, as it is commonly called, and, finally,  (e) a _condenser_. The core, primary and secondary coils form a unit  and these are set in a box or mounted on top of a hollow wooden base.  The condenser is placed in the bottom of the box, or on the base,  while the vibrator is mounted on one end of the box or on top of the  base, and it is the only part of the coil that needs adjusting.    The vibrator consists of a stiff, flat spring fixed at one end to the  box or base while it carries a piece of soft iron called an _armature_  on its free end and this sets close to one end of the soft iron core.  Insulated from this spring is a standard that carries an adjusting  screw on the small end of which is a platinum point and this makes  contact with a small platinum disk fixed to the spring. The condenser  is formed of alternate sheets of paper and tinfoil built up in the  same fashion as the receiving condenser described under the caption of  _Fixed and Variable Condensers_, in Chapter III.    The wiring diagram C shows how the spark coil is wired up. One of the  battery binding posts is connected with one end of the primary coil  while the other end of the latter which is wound on the soft iron core  connects with the spring of the vibrator. The other battery binding  post connects with the standard that supports the adjusting screw. The  condenser is shunted across the vibrator, that is, one end of the  condenser is connected with the spring and the other end of the  condenser is connected with the adjusting screw standard. The ends of  the secondary coil lead to two binding posts, which are usually placed  on top of the spark coil and it is to these that the spark gap is  connected.    The Battery.--This can be formed of dry cells or you can use a storage  battery to energize your coil. For all coils that give less than a  1-inch spark you should use 5 dry cells; for 1-and 2-inch spark coils  use 6 or 8 dry cells, and for 3 to 4-inch spark coils use 8 to 10 dry  cells. The way the dry cells are connected together to form a battery  will be shown presently. A dry cell is shown at A in Fig, 19.    [Illustration: Fig. 19.--Other parts for Transmitting Set No. 1]    The Telegraph Key.--You can use an ordinary Morse telegraph key for  the sending set and you can get one with a japanned iron base for  $1.50 (or better, one made of brass and which has 1/8-inch silver  contact points for $3.00. A key of the latter kind is shown at B).    The Spark gap.--It is in the _spark gap_ that the high tension spark  takes place. The apparatus in which the spark takes place is also  called the _spark gap_. It consists of a pair of zinc plugs, called  _electrodes_, fixed to the ends of a pair of threaded rods, with knobs  on the other ends, and these screw into and through a pair of  standards as shown at _c_. This is called a _fixed_, or _stationary  spark gap_ and costs about $1.00.    The Tuning Coil.--The _transmitting inductance_, or _sending tuning  coil_, consists of 20 to 30 turns of _No. 8 or 9_ hard drawn copper  wire wound on a slotted insulated form and mounted on a wooden base.  It is provided with _clips_ so that you can cut in and cut out as many  turns of wire as you wish and so tune the sending circuits to send out  whatever wave length you desire. It is shown at _d_, and costs about  $5.00. See also _Oscillation Transformer_, page 63 [Chapter IV].    The High Tension Condenser.--High tension condensers, that is,  condensers which will stand up under _high potentials_, or electric  pressures, can be bought in units or sections. These condensers are  made up of thin brass plates insulated with a special compound and  pressed into a compact form. The _capacitance_ [Footnote: This is the  capacity of the condenser.] of one section is enough for a  transmitting set using a spark coil that gives a 2 inch spark or less  and two sections connected together should be used for coils giving  from 2 to 4 inch sparks. It is shown at _e_.    Connecting Up the Apparatus.--Your sending set should be mounted on a  table, or a bench, where it need not be moved. Place the key in about  the middle of the table and down in front, and the spark coil to the  left and well to the back but so that the vibrator end will be to the  right, as this will enable you to adjust it easily. Place the battery  back of the spark coil and the tuning coil (oscillation transformer)  to the right of the spark coil and back of the key, all of which is  shown in the layout at A in Fig. 20.    [Illustration: (A) Fig. 20.--Top View of Apparatus Layout for Sending  Set No. 1.]    [Illustration: (B) Fig. 20.--Wiring of Diagram for Sending Set No. 1.]    For the _low voltage circuit_, that is the battery circuit, use _No.  12_ or _14_ insulated copper wire. Connect all of the dry cells  together in _series_, that is, connect the zinc of one cell with the  carbon of the next and so on until all of them are connected up. Then  connect the carbon of the end cell with one of the posts of the key,  the zinc of the other end cell with one of the primary posts of the  spark coil and the other primary post of the spark coil with the other  post of the key, when the primary circuit will be complete.    For the _high tension circuits_, that is, the _oscillation circuits_,  you may use either bare or insulated copper wire but you must be  careful that they do not touch the table, each other, or any part of  the apparatus, except, of course, the posts they are connected with.  Connect one of the posts of the secondary coil of the spark coil with  one of the posts of the spark gap, and the other post with one of the  posts of the condenser; then connect the other post of the condenser  with the lower spring clip of the tuning coil and also connect this  clip with the ground. This done, connect the middle spring clip with  one of the posts of the spark gap, and, finally, connect the top clip  with the aerial wire and your transmitting set is ready to be tuned. A  wiring diagram of the connections is shown at B. As this set is tuned  in the same way as _Set No. 2_ which follows, you are referred to the  end of this chapter.    A Better Transmitting Set (No. 2).--The apparatus for this set  includes: (1) an _alternating current transformer_, (2) a _wireless  telegraph key_, (3) a _fixed_, a _rotary_, or a _quenched spark gap_,  (4) a _condenser_, and (5) an _oscillation transformer_. If you have a  110 volt direct lighting current in your home instead of 110 volt  alternating current, then you will also need (6) an _electrolytic  interrupter_, for in this case the primary circuit of the transformer  must be made and broken rapidly in order to set up alternating  currents in the secondary coil.    The Alternating Current Transformer.--An alternating current, or  power, transformer is made on the same principle as a spark coil, that  is, it has a soft iron core, a primary coil formed of a couple of  layers of heavy wire, and a secondary coil wound up of a large number  of turns of very fine wire. Unlike the spark coil, however, which has  an _open magnetic core_ and whose secondary coil is wound on the  primary coil, the transformer has a _closed magnetic core_, with the  primary coil wound on one of the legs of the core and the secondary  wound on the other leg. It has neither a vibrator nor a condenser. A  plain transformer is shown at A in Fig. 21.    [Illustration: Fig. 21.--Parts for Transmitting Set No. 2.]    A transformer of this kind can be bought either (a) _unmounted_, that  is, just the bare transformer, or (b) _fully mounted_, that is, fitted  with an iron stand, mounted on an insulating base on which are a pair  of primary binding posts, while the secondary is provided with a  _safety spark gap_. There are three sizes of transformers of this kind  made and they are rated at 1/4, 1/2 and 1 kilowatt, respectively, they  deliver a secondary current of 9,000, 11,000 and 25,000 volts,  according to size, and cost $16.00, $22.00 and $33.00 when fully  mounted; a reduction of $3.00, $4.00 and $5.00 is made when they are  unmounted. All of these transformers operate on 110 volt, 60 cycle  current and can be connected directly to the source of alternating  current.    The Wireless Key.--For this transmitting set a standard wireless key  should be used as shown at B. It is made about the same as a regular  telegraph key but it is much heavier, the contact points are larger  and instead of the current"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6948"],[0,"The Secrets of the German War Office (#9)"],[1,"first time I had seen  the Count, I had heard a great deal about him.  The Emperor's Privy  Councilor and right hand was the head of the political sections of the  Secret Service.  This promised to be interesting.  I wondered what the  likely upshot would be, but I was interrupted in my soliloquy by a  summons to reenter the Count's chamber.    I was shown to a seat.  Graf Wedel looked me over carefully and  minutely for a considerable length of time with a frank stare of  appraisal.    \"How old are you, Doctor?\"    I must confess my extreme youth always made this question one of  secret annoyance.    \"Twenty-five, your Excellency.\"    \"Very young, very young.\"  He stared at me again and after a pause  said:    \"Yet the reports about your work are satisfactory and show discretion  and intelligence above your years.\"    I bowed in acknowledgment.    \"You will from now on,\" he said, \"become attached to this section of  the Service.  You will be trusted with some very grave and important  matters.  You will receive your orders and instructions only from me.  You will report only to me direct.  On no account will you see any  subordinate or any person, no matter what his official status, without  my expressed permission.  Verstehen sie?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"For funds,\" he continued, \"you will apply to my secretary.  Of your  expenses you will furnish a monthly account.  How soon can you be  ready to go on a mission?\"    I told him in two hours.    \"Good!\" he exclaimed, \"the sooner the better.  This is what I want you  to do.  You will go at once to Constantinople and find out which of  the court officials are in French and Russian pay.  You will find out  the favorites of the high officials and officers, especially the  nationality of these women.  I will not give you any points of  introductions.  They might lead you to be suspected.  They are a  crafty lot down there.  Be careful and take your time.  You know  nothing can be done in a hurry down in that country,\"--he paused as if  waiting for questions from me.  We discussed a few minor points then  he said:    \"Your official number with us from now on will be 1734.  You will  always use 17 to sign personal cipher messages sent to me.  You will  use 34 in signing official reports and communications.\"    The necessary arrangements for my preliminary expenses were discussed  with one of his secretaries and I then went back to my quarters to  think over a plan of campaign and prepare myself for the mission.  The  transfer from Captain Tappken's department pleased me for I knew that  at the Wilhelmstrasse I would be in closer touch with the bigger  affairs of diplomacy.  Tappken had hinted at my finding favor with the  Wilhelmstrasse and I guessed that coming on top of my Port Arthur  success a delicate private mission was responsible for it.  To cite  the case:    Germany keeps a watch on all her officers.  When one of them is  spending more money than his income, he is promptly investigated.  I  recalled how they had sent me to the Spandau Garrison to inquire into  the affairs of an officer who was too lavish with his money to suit  the Intelligence Department.  He was an ordnance officer in a small  arms factory at Spandau and it was the natural conclusion that he was  obtaining this extra money by selling state secrets.    I encountered, however, an entirely different situation.  I learned  that he was absolutely innocent on that score but that he was  receiving money from a certain princess who had become infatuated with  him.  She was of a very high house and I realized that her name could  not be mentioned in a report to Captain Tappken.  This situation  required delicate treatment.  I solved the dilemma by reporting to  Tappken that the ordnance officer was guiltless of any act of treason  against his country.  I then made a private report, covering the  intimate facts, which went direct to officials of higher  responsibility.  The princess' name did not appear as far as  subordinates were concerned and the whole affair was hushed up.  My  fortunate discretion in this matter undoubtedly strengthened my  standing with the Wilhelmstrasse.    By this time I had installed myself in quiet quarters on the  Mittelstrasse, and Kim, who had been transformed from a Basuto boy  into an efficient man servant, looked after my comforts.  To secure  myself from the questions of prying neighbors, I had caused it to be  known that I was a retired South African planter inclined to poor  health.  This was the most likely explanation for my curious mode of  living and my sudden periodical disappearances, for I was away from  the Mittelstrasse for months at a time.  Presumably I was traveling  about to the different watering places on the Continent for my health.    My mission to Constantinople called for some considerable thought in  selecting the most advisable character to impersonate.  A tourist came  first to mind.  A tourist was out of the question, because tourists do  not stay long in one place and I expected to be three or four months  in Turkey.  There was nothing to study in Constantinople.  I thought  of a student of botany, the rÃ´le I had used at Port Arthur.  But that  would not do.  The idea of a merchant came to me, but I dismissed the  idea of a prosperous merchant, for it would necessitate making  business connections, a careful and slow process, the fulfillment of  which would consume entirely too much time.  I finally decided to  travel as a physician, or to use the Turkish word a _Hakim_.  A  _Hakim_ is always accorded respect, even reverence, by Turks and  Arabs.  This character determined upon, I went to the telephone and  requested the Service Intelligence Department to give me letters of  introduction to the German hospital and the Pera Hospital in  Constantinople.  They were sent to me signed by the authorities of the  Charitee in Berlin and described that I was going to study tropical  and Asiatic diseases and requested that the hospitals give me every  facility for research work.  I had Kim pack a case of medical  instruments and told him to have everything in readiness to leave  Berlin that night, on the Orient Express.  He was necessary to my  plans and was to accompany me.  A messenger from Wedel brought a few  final verbal instructions, my funds and sealed instructions.  I was  bidden to keep away from all official German intercourse in  Constantinople.  Wedel might have saved himself the trouble of that  word of caution for I knew enough of the subtle Oriental mind to keep  away from anything that would raise the slightest suspicion in regard  to my identity.  If I pride myself on anything, it is a knowledge of  Eastern character.  With the instructions were a thousand marks cash  and a draft for 5000 marks on the Ottoman Bank of Constantinople that  had been deposited in my name.    It may strike the reader as curious that I took Kim with me, but I  knew he could be of tremendous use to me in Constantinople.  In  addition to speaking his _Kaffir_ dialects, he knew Arabic.  Any negro  boy who could speak Arabic could learn almost anything in  Constantinople, which abounds in black men of all tribes and  nationalities.  Among the servants of every household, Kim would find  many compatriots from whom he could get information, impossible for  any European to obtain.    After an uneventful trip to Constantinople, I took preliminary  quarters in the Brasserie Kor, a quiet, second-rate hostelry on the  Rue Osmanly.  I went to an unpretentious place to avoid attracting any  particular attention.  Had I put up at an expensive hotel there would  immediate]y bave been queries about me.  Who is this stranger?  He  seems to have money.  If it isn't his money, whose money is he  spending?  It is not well to invite a Turk's suspicion.  As I was  totally unacquainted with Constantinople, I used the first week for  getting familiar with the geography of the city.  It was necessary  that I learn the location of the various legations and the residences  of high court officials.  The next week I found lodgings in the very  center of the district of court residences and began to seek out the  haunts and places of rendezvous of demi-mondaines, favorites and  hangers-on of the Turkish officials.  On the second day of my arrival,  I had presented my credentials and letters at the German Pera  Hospital, and had my name entered as a visiting honorary surgeon.  Every day thereafter, rain or shine, I made it a point to spend some  time at these hospitals, and it was well that I did.  Once a day and  often twice I would sign the book at the hospital and I believe that  the signature Dr. Franz von Graver appears on the record books of the  Pera and German Hospitals in Constantinople, at least one hundred  times.  Was I not fulfilling my duties as a physician doing research  work?    I finally located myself in the residential district of Pera where I  rented a small residence, typical of the well-to-do Turk of the middle  class and quite in keeping with my assumed character.  An elaborate  residence would have aroused immediate suspicion, for there is no  country on earth where curiosity and suspicion is so easily roused as  in Turkey.  Kipling, who knows the East so well, portrayed Port Said  as the dwelling place of concentrated wickedness.  He is right, but I  do not think he has ever visited Stamboul.  In Stamboul there is with  no exception the most conglomerate mixture of nondescript  nationalities on the face of the earth.  Not only are all  nationalities represented but breeds of men that defy all pathological  research, hideous in their conglomerate intermixtures.  If an Albanian  bandit, himself a mixture of Greek and Nubian mulatto, has issue by an  Arab woman with French blood--find the genealogy.  Can you imagine a  more difficult field of operations for an Occidental and a stranger?    In the course of my preliminary observations, I found Constantinople  "]]]
