I wonder when he got the message?\"    \"It must have been sent in the morning,\" said Sapt. \"They must have sent  it before news of your arrival at Strelsau reached Zenda--I suppose it  came from Zenda.\"    \"And he's carried it about all day!\" I exclaimed. \"Upon my honour, I'm  not the only man who's had a trying day! What did he think, Sapt?\"    \"What does that matter? What does he think, lad, now?\"    I rose to my feet.    \"We must get back,\" I said, \"and rouse every soldier in Strelsau. We  ought to be in pursuit of Michael before midday.\"    Old Sapt pulled out his pipe and carefully lit it from the candle which  guttered on the table.    \"The King may be murdered while we sit here!\" I urged.    Sapt smoked on for a moment in silence.    \"That cursed old woman!\" he broke out. \"She must have attracted their  attention somehow. I see the game. They came up to kidnap the King,  and--as I say--somehow they found him. If you hadn't gone to Strelsau,  you and I and Fritz had been in heaven by now!\"    \"And the King?\"    \"Who knows where the King is now?\" he asked.    \"Come, let's be off!\" said I; but he sat still. And suddenly he burst  into one of his grating chuckles:    \"By Jove, we've shaken up Black Michael!\"    \"Come, come!\" I repeated impatiently.    \"And we'll shake him up a bit more,\" he added, a cunning smile  broadening on his wrinkled, weather-beaten face, and his teeth working  on an end of his grizzled moustache. \"Ay, lad, we'll go back to  Strelsau. The King shall be in his capital again tomorrow.\"    \"The King?\"    \"The crowned King!\"    \"You're mad!\" I cried.    \"If we go back and tell the trick we played, what would you give for our  lives?\"    \"Just what they're worth,\" said I.    \"And for the King's throne? Do you think that the nobles and the people  will enjoy being fooled as you've fooled them? Do you think they'll love  a King who was too drunk to be crowned, and sent a servant to personate  him?\"    \"He was drugged--and I'm no servant.\"    \"Mine will be Black Michael's version.\"    He rose, came to me, and laid his hand on my shoulder.    \"Lad,\" he said, \"if you play the man, you may save the King yet. Go back  and keep his throne warm for him.\"    \"But the duke knows--the villains he has employed know--\"    \"Ay, but they can't speak!\" roared Sapt in grim triumph.    \"We've got 'em! How can they denounce you without denouncing themselves?  This is not the King, because we kidnapped the King and murdered his  servant. Can they say that?\"    The position flashed on me. Whether Michael knew me or not, he could not  speak. Unless he produced the King, what could he do? And if he produced  the King, where was he? For a moment I was carried away headlong; but in  an instant the difficulties came strong upon me.    \"I must be found out,\" I urged.    \"Perhaps; but every hour's something. Above all, we must have a King in  Strelsau, or the city will be Michael's in four-and-twenty hours, and  what would the King's life be worth then--or his throne? Lad, you must  do it!\"    \"Suppose they kill the King?\"    \"They'll kill him, if you don't.\"    \"Sapt, suppose they have killed the King?\"    \"Then, by heaven, you're as good an Elphberg as Black Michael, and you  shall reign in Ruritania! But I don't believe they have; nor will they  kill him if you're on the throne. Will they kill him, to put you in?\"    It was a wild plan--wilder even and more hopeless than the trick we  had already carried through; but as I listened to Sapt I saw the strong  points in our game. And then I was a young man and I loved action, and I  was offered such a hand in such a game as perhaps never man played yet.    \"I shall be found out,\" I said.    \"Perhaps,\" said Sapt. \"Come! to Strelsau! We shall be caught like rats  in a trap if we stay here.\"    \"Sapt,\" I cried, \"I'll try it!\"    \"Well played!\" said he. \"I hope they've left us the horses. I'll go and  see.\"    \"We must bury that poor fellow,\" said I.    \"No time,\" said Sapt.    \"I'll do it.\"    \"Hang you!\" he grinned. \"I make you a King, and--Well, do it. Go and  fetch him, while I look to the horses. He can't lie very deep, but I  doubt if he'll care about that. Poor little Josef! He was an honest bit  of a man.\"    He went out, and I went to the cellar. I raised poor Josef in my arms  and bore him into the passage and thence towards the door of the house.  Just inside I laid him down, remembering that I must find spades for our  task. At this instant Sapt came up.    \"The horses are all right; there's the own brother to the one that  brought you here. But you may save yourself that job.\"    \"I'll not go before he's buried.\"    \"Yes, you will.\"    \"Not I, Colonel Sapt; not for all Ruritania.\"    \"You fool!\" said he. \"Come here.\"    He drew me to the door. The moon was sinking, but about three hundred  yards away, coming along the road from Zenda, I made out a party of men.  There were seven or eight of them; four were on horseback and the rest  were walking, and I saw that they carried long implements, which I  guessed to be spades and mattocks, on their shoulders.    \"They'll save you the trouble,\" said Sapt. \"Come along.\"    He was right. The approaching party must, beyond doubt, be Duke  Michael's men, come to remove the traces of their evil work. I hesitated  no longer, but an irresistible desire seized me.    Pointing to the corpse of poor little Josef, I said to Sapt:    \"Colonel, we ought to strike a blow for him!\"    \"You'd like to give him some company, eh! But it's too risky work, your  Majesty.\"    \"I must have a slap at 'em,\" said I.    Sapt wavered.    \"Well,\" said he, \"it's not business, you know; but you've been good  boy--and if we come to grief, why, hang me, it'll save us lot of  thinking! I'll show you how to touch them.\"    He cautiously closed the open chink of the door.    Then we retreated through the house and made our way to the back  entrance. Here our horses were standing. A carriage-drive swept all  round the lodge.    \"Revolver ready?\" asked Sapt.    \"No; steel for me,\" said I.    \"Gad, you're thirsty tonight,\" chuckled Sapt. \"So be it.\"    We mounted, drawing our swords, and waited silently for a minute or two.  Then we heard the tramp of men on the drive the other side of the house.  They came to a stand, and one cried:    \"Now then, fetch him out!\"    \"Now!\" whispered Sapt.    Driving the spurs into our horses, we rushed at a gallop round the  house, and in a moment we were among the ruffians. Sapt told me  afterwards that he killed a man, and I believe him; but I saw no more of  him. With a cut, I split the head of a fellow on a brown horse, and he  fell to the ground. Then I found myself opposite a big man, and I was  half conscious of another to my right. It was too warm to stay, and with  a simultaneous action I drove my spurs into my horse again and my sword  full into the big man's breast. His bullet whizzed past my ear--I could  almost swear it touched it. I wrenched at the sword, but it would not  come, and I dropped it and galloped after Sapt, whom I now saw about  twenty yards ahead. I waved my hand in farewell, and dropped it a second  later with a yell, for a bullet had grazed my finger and I felt the  blood. Old Sapt turned round in the saddle. Someone fired again, but  they had no rifles, and we were out of range. Sapt fell to laughing.    \"That's one to me and two to you, with decent luck,\" said he. \"Little  Josef will have company.\"    \"Ay, they'll be a _partie carree_,\" said I. My blood was up, and I  rejoiced to have killed them.    \"Well, a pleasant night's work to the rest!\" said he. \"I wonder if they  noticed you?\"    \"The big fellow did; as I stuck him I heard him cry, 'The King!'\"    \"Good! good! Oh, we'll give Black Michael some work before we've done!\"    Pausing an instant, we made a bandage for my wounded finger, which was  bleeding freely and ached severely, the bone being much bruised. Then we  rode on, asking of our good horses all that was in them. The excitement  of the fight and of our great resolve died away, and we rode in gloomy  silence. Day broke clear and cold. We found a farmer just up, and made  him give us sustenance for ourselves and our horses. I, feigning a  toothache, muffled my face closely. Then ahead again, till Strelsau lay  before us. It was eight o'clock or nearing nine, and the gates were all  open, as they always were save when the duke's caprice or intrigues shut  them. We rode in by the same way as we had come out the evening before,  all four of us--the men and the horses--wearied and jaded. The streets  were even quieter than when we had gone: everyone was sleeping off last  night's revelry, and we met hardly a soul till we reached the little  gate of the Palace. There Sapt's old groom was waiting for us.    \"Is all well, sir?\" he asked.    \"All's well,\" said Sapt, and the man, coming to me, took my hand to  kiss.    \"The King's hurt!\" he cried.    \"It's nothing,\" said I, as I dismounted; \"I caught my finger in the  door.\"    \"Remember--silence!\" said Sapt. \"Ah! but, my good Freyler, I do not need  to tell you that!\"    The old fellow shrugged his shoulders.    \"All young men like to ride abroad now and again, why not the King?\"  said he; and Sapt's laugh left his opinion of my motives undisturbed.    \"You should always trust a man,\" observed Sapt, fitting the key in the  lock, \"just as far as you must.\"    We went in and reached the dressing-room. Flinging open the door, we saw  Fritz von Tarlenheim stretched, fully dressed, on the sofa. He seemed to  have been sleeping, but our entry woke him. He leapt to his feet, gave  one glance at me, and with a joyful cry, threw himself on his knees  before me.    \"Thank God, sire! thank God, you're safe!\" he cried, stretching his hand  up to catch hold of mine.    I confess that I was moved. This King, whatever his faults,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/950"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Runabout; Or, The Speediest Car on the Road (#9)"],[1,"y're afraid to, Pete Bailey,\" replied Tom  quickly, for he had recognized the voice of the other one of Andy's  particular cronies.    \"Aw, he knows who we are,\" whispered Sam, but not so low but that our  hero heard him.    \"No matter,\" was Andy's retort. \"Let's go ahead with it. Tie him to  that tree.\"    It was useless for Tom to struggle. He was bound too tightly by the  rope, and the crowd was too many for him. In a few minutes he was  securely fastened to a tree, not far from the camp-fire, which was  replenished from time to time.    \"Now for the judgment!\" called one of the masked lads, in what he meant  to be a sepulchral tone. \"What is the charge against the prisoner?  Brother Number One of the Deep Forest Throng, what is your accusation?\"    \"He's a regular snob, that's what's the trouble,\"  answered Andy  Foger,  though whether he was \"Brother Number One,\" did not appear.  \"He's too fresh and--and--\"    \"I'll make you wish you felt fresh when I get hold of you, Andy,\"  murmured Tom.    \"Quiet!\" cried a tall lad. \"What's the next charge?\"    \"He keeps an old colored man on guard at his place,\" was the answer,  and Tom had no difficulty in recognizing the voice of Sid Holton. \"The  coon throws whitewash all over us. I got some of it.\"    \"You wouldn't have, if you'd minded your own business,\" retorted Tom.  \"It served you right!\"    \"What is the verdict on the prisoner?\" asked one who seemed to be the  leader.    \"I say let's tar and feather him!\" cried Andy suddenly.  \"There's a  barrel of tar back in the woods here, and we can get some feathers from  a chicken coop. That would make him so he wouldn't be so uppish, I  guess!\"    \"That's right! Tar and feathers!\" exclaimed several.    Our hero's heart sank. He was not afraid, but he did not relish the  indignity that was proposed. He resolved to fight to the last ounce of  his strength against the masked lads.    \"Can we get a kettle to heat the tar in?\" asked some one.    \"We'll find one,\" answered Sam Snedecker. \"Come on, let's do it. You'll  look pretty, Tom Swift, when we're through with you,\" he exulted.    Tom did not answer, but there was fierce anger in his heart.  The tar  and feather proposal seemed to meet with general favor.    \"Members of the Deep Forest Throng, we will hold a consultation,\"  proposed the leader, in his assumed deep voice.  \"Come over here, to  one side. Brother Number Six, guard the prisoner well.\"    \"There ain't no need to,\" answered a lad who had been instructed to  mount guard over Tom. \"He's tied so tight he can't move. I want to hear  what you say.\"    \"Very well then,\" assented the leader,  \"But look to his bonds.\"    The lad made a hasty examination of the ropes binding the young  inventor to the tree, and Tom was glad that the examination was a hasty  one. For he feared the guard might discover that one hand had been  worked nearly free. The young inventor had done this while he leered at  his captors.    Tom was not going to submit tamely to the nonsense, and from the moment  he had been tied, he had been trying to get loose. He had nearly  succeeded in freeing one hand when the crowd of masked boys moved off  to one side, where they presently began to talk in excited whispers.    \"I wonder how they came to catch me,\" thought the prisoner, as he  worked feverishly to further loosen the ropes. \"This looks as if it was  a put-up job, with the masks, and everything.\"  Later he learned that  the idea was the outcome of a proposal of one of the new arrivals in  town. He had organized the \"Deep Forest Throng,\" as a sort of secret  society, and Andy and his cronies had been induced to join. It was  Andy's proposal to capture Tom, though, and, having seen him depart for  Mansburg on his motor-cycle, and knowing that he would return along a  road that ran near the woods where the Throng met, suggested that they  take Tom captive. The idea was enthusiastically received, and Andy and  his cronies thought they saw a chance to be revenged.    Tom, while he picked at the ropes, listened to what the boys were  saying. He heard frequent mention of tar and feathers, and began to  believe, that unless he could get free, while they were off there  consulting, he might be forced to submit to the humiliating ordeal.    He managed to get one hand comparatively free, so that he could move it  about, but then he struck several hard knots, and could make no further  progress. The conference seemed on the point of breaking up.    \"One of you go for a big kettle to boil the tar in,\" ordered the  leader, \"and the rest of you dig up some feathers.\"    \"I must get loose!\" thought Tom desperately. \"If they try to tar and  feather me it will be a risky business. I've got to get loose! They may  burn me severely!\"    But, though he tried with all his strength, the ropes would not loosen  another bit. He had one hand free, and that was all. The crowd was  moving back toward him.    \"My knife!\" thought the captive quickly. \"If I can reach that in my  pocket I can cut the ropes! Once I get loose I'll fight the whole  crowd!\"    He managed to get his free hand into his pocket. His fingers touched  something. It was not his knife, and, for a moment he felt a pang of  disappointment. Then, as he realized what it was that he had grasped, a  new idea came to him.    \"This will be better than the knife!\" he thought exultantly.  The crowd  of lads was now surrounding him, some distance from the fire, which  burned in front of the captive.    \"Sentence has been passed upon you,\" remarked the leader.  \"Prepare to  meet thy doom! Get the materials, brothers!\"    \"One moment!\" called Tom, for he wanted the crowd all present to  witness what he was about to do. \"I'll give you one chance to let me go  peaceably. If you don't--\"    \"Well, what will you do?\" demanded Andy sneeringly, as he pulled his  mask further over his face. \"I guess you won't do anything, Tom Swift.\"    \"I'll give you one chance to let me go, and I'll agree to say nothing  about this joke,\" went on Tom. \"If you don't I'll blow this place up!\"    For a moment there was a silence.    \"Ha! Ha! Ho! Ho!\" laughed Sam Snedecker. \"Listen to him! He'll blow the  place up! I'd like to see you do it! You can't get loose in the first  place, and you haven't anything to blow it up with in the second. I'd  like to see you do it; hey, fellers?\"    \"Sure,\" came the answering chorus.    \"Would you?\" asked Tom quickly. \"Then watch. Stand back if you don't  want to get hurt, and remember that I gave you a chance to let me go!\"    Tom made a rapid motion with the hand he had gotten loose. He threw  something toward the blazing fire, which was now burning well.  Something white sailed through the air, and fell amid the hot embers.    There was a moment's pause, and then a blinding flash of blue fire  lighted up the woods, and a dull rumble, as when gun-powder is lighted  in the open followed. A great cloud of white smoke arose, as the vivid  blue glare died away, and it seemed as if a great wind swept over the  place. Several of the masked lads were knocked down by the explosion,  and when the rumble died away, and deep blackness succeeded the intense  blue light, there came cries of pain and terror. The fire had been  scattered, and extinguished by the explosion which Tom, though still  bound to the tree had caused to happen in the midst of the Deep Forest  Throng. Then, as the smoke rolled away, Andy Foger cried:    \"Come on, fellows! Something's happened. I guess a volcano blew up!\"          CHAPTER IX    TOM IS RESCUED      The Deep Forest Throng needed no urging to flee from the place of the  mysterious explosion. Their prisoner, helpless as he had seemed, had  proved too much for them. Slipping and stumbling along in the darkness,  the masked lads had but one thought--to get away before they saw more  of that blue fire, and the force of the concussion.    \"Gee! My eyebrows are all singed off!\" cried Sam Snedecker, as he tore  loose his mask which had been rent in the explosion, and felt of his  face.    \"And my hands are burned,\" added Pete Bailey. \"I stood closer to the  fire than any of you.\"    \"You did not! I got the worst of it!\" cried Andy. \"I was knocked down  by the explosion, and I'll bet I'm hurt somewhere. I guess--Oh! Help!  I'm falling in a mud hole!\"    There was a splash, and the bully disappeared from the sight of his  companions who, now that the moon had risen, could better see to flee  from their prisoner.    \"Help me out, somebody!\" pleaded Andy. \"I'm in a mud hole!\"    They pulled him out, a sorry looking sight, and the red-haired lad,  whose locks were now black with muck, began to lament his lot.    \"Dry up!\" commanded Sid Holton. \"It's all your fault, for proposing  such a fool trick as capturing Tom Swift. We might have known he would  get the best of us.\"    \"What was that stuff he used, anyhow?\" asked Cecil Hedden, the lad  responsible for the organization of the Deep Forest Throng.  \"He must  be a wonder. Does he do sleight-of-hand tricks?\"    \"He does all sorts of tricks,\" replied Pete Bailey, feeling of a big  lump on his head, caused by falling on a stone in the mad rush. \"I  guess we were chumps to tackle him. He must have put some kind of  chemical in the fire, to make it blow up.\"    \"Or else he summoned his airship by wireless, and had that balloonist,  Mr. Sharp, drop a bomb in the blaze,\" suggested another lad.    \"But how could he do anything? Wasn't he tied fast to that tree?\" asked  Cecil, the leader.    \"You never know when you've got Tom Swift tied,\" declared Jack  Reynolds. \"You think you've got him, and you haven't. He's too slick  for us. It's Andy's fault, for proposing to capture him.\"    \"That's right! Blame it all on me,\" whined the squint-eyed bully. \"You  was just as anxious as I was to tar and feather him.\"    \"Well, we didn't do it,\" commented Pete Bailey, dryly. \"I s'pose he's  loose now, laughin' at us. Gee, but that was an explosion though! It's  "]]]
