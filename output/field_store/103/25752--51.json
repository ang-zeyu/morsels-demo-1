Is it any wonder, gentlemen, under these circumstances--having  lately emerged from a monarchical government, that I should experience  peculiar sensations in rising to address you?    \"But, by the by, I have been informed that you purpose to tar and  feather me, for my religious opinions Is this the boon you have  inherited from your fathers? Is this the blessing they purchased with  their dearest hearts' blood--this your liberty? If so, you now have  a victim, and we will have an offering to the goddess of liberty.\"  Here he tore open his vest and said: \"Gentlemen come on with your tar  and feathers, your victim is ready; and ye shades of the venerable  patriots, gaze upon the deeds of your degenerate sons! Come on,  gentlemen! Come on, I say, I am ready!\"    No one moved, no one spoke. He stood there drawn to his full height,  calm but defiant--the master of the situation.    After a pause of some moments he continued his remarks and preached  with great boldness and power for some three hours.    At the conclusion of his discourse, he was waited upon by some of the  leading citizens of the place who expressed their pleasure at what they  had heard, and disclaimed, in behalf of the people, any intention of  tarring and feathering him; but the brethren still insisted that such  was the intention of the crowd, and that the tar and feathers had been  provided; but they had been awed into silence by the boldness of Elder  Taylor.    Near Indianapolis, Indiana, Brother Mills and the other brethren who  had joined their company, obtained employment, and Elder Taylor and his  family stayed at the house of a Brother Miller. While there his second  son, Joseph James, was born.    During the two months that he remained in that place, he worked at his  craft and also made a carriage for himself. He preached the gospel  in Indianapolis and raised up a small branch of the Church. His wife  having recovered from child bed, he continued his journey to the west,  parting company with Brother Mills who was not ready to go.    Approaching De Witt, Caroll County, Missouri, about fifty miles from  Far West, as he was holding back his horse, while descending a hill,  his foot slipped and he fell from his carriage. The wheels passed over  his arm, inflicting a serious injury, and he was again detained.    In DeWitt there was a number of Saints who had purchased land and  settled there, and Elder Taylor stayed at the house of a Brother  Humphreys. It was while at DeWitt that he had his first experience with  mobs. It was late in the summer of 1938 when he arrived there, and the  persecutions which were to terminate in the expulsion of the Saints  from Missouri were just beginning.    The mob that first came upon the Saints at DeWitt, was led by two  alleged ministers of the gospel, Sashiel Woods and Abbot Hancock.  \"This was the first mob I had ever seen,\" remarks Elder Taylor,  \"and the whole affair was new to me, especially when I considered  the kind of officers they had. I had heretofore looked upon gospel  ministers as messengers of peace; here they came not only in a war-like  capacity, but as the leaders of an armed mob--a gang of marauders and  free-booters, with the avowed object of driving peaceful citizens--men,  women and children--from their homes.\"    It would appear that while Elder Taylor did not believe in fighting  for slight infringements of his rights, he did believe to the fullest  extent in self-defense; and the ease with which he adapted himself to  the new circumstances in which he was placed, exhibited the character  of the man. \"I had no arms,\" he continues in his account of this affair  at DeWitt, \"and heretofore considered that I needed none in a Christian  civilized land; but I found I had been laboring under a mistake. The  civilization here was of a very low order, and the Christianity of  a very questionable character. I therefore threw off the sling and  bandages from my lame arm, suppressed my repugnance to fighting,  borrowed a gun, bought a brace of pistols, and prepared myself at least  for defensive measures.\"    There were twenty four of the brethren, and about one hundred and fifty  of the mob. The little band, nothing daunted at the superior forces of  the enemy, organized under a captain and prepared for the onset. \"These  _reverend_ gentlemen,\" says Elder Taylor's narrative, \"concluded that  it was best to have a parley, and by a little strategy throw us off  our guard. Having captured a stray Saint, they sent by him a message  informing us that they would like three or four of our leaders to come  and treat with them. To this we returned answer that they had come in  the capacity of banditti, to interfere with our rights when in the  peaceful prosecution of our daily avocations; that we could have no  confidence in men occupying so questionable a position; that their  _ruse_ to divide us would not work; and though inferior to them in  numbers, if they attempted to molest us, we should protect ourselves as  best we could.\"    After some further parleying, the mob gave the Saints ten days in which  to leave, threatening that if they were not gone in that time, they  would return with increased forces, kill every man, woman and child,  and throw their goods into the Missouri.    This affair having ended for the time being, Elder Taylor continued  his journey, and finally reached Far West, where he met the Prophet  Joseph, several of the Twelve and other leading brethren. The mob  did not return in ten days upon the people of De Witt, but they did  return early in October and the Saints at last had to abandon their  homes there, although they had purchased their lands from the general  government.    The history of the prominent men in the Church is so closely interwoven  with that of the Church, that it is difficult to write the one without  also writing the other; and in order to understand the scenes which the  subject of this writing was now in the midst of, it will be necessary  to relate as briefly as may be, the events which befell the Saints in  the state of Missouri up to the time that Elder Taylor joined them, in  the autumn of 1838.    From the Book of Mormon, [1] the Saints learned that upon the continent  of America the people of God, in the last days, are to build a holy  city, the \"New Jerusalem,\" or \"Zion.\" In July, 1831, the Lord revealed  the place where the city should be located and a temple built. That  place was Independence, near the western boundary of Missouri; and  there the Saints were commanded to gather, purchase the land and  dedicate it unto the Lord. This commandment they began to fulfill,  whereupon the jealous rage of the old settlers was aroused against  them. It was the meeting of two elements that had little or no affinity  with each other.    The old settlers were from the slaves states of the south, the Saints  were from the free states of the north, and many of them from New  England. The former were idle, indifferent to their surroundings,  and the development of their lands; the latter were industrious,  frugal, eager to make good homes, develop, build up and beautify  the country--in short, make it the Zion of God in very deed. The  Missourians were habitual Sabbath breakers; horse racing, cock-fighting  and gambling being the \"pleasures\" they indulged in on that day,  attended with the drunkenness and blasphemy which usually go hand in  hand with such sports. Of course the Saints could not engage with  them in this kind of life, their early training, no less than their  religion, forebade it. The result was a coolness between the Saints and  the old settlers, followed by suspicion on the part of the latter that  they would be supplanted by the new comers. From that conviction to a  resolution to prevent it was a short step, and they made haste to take  it.    Although some of the Saints were, doubtless, unwise in much of their  talk, they were guilty of no overt act against the peace and good  order of the community in which they settled; nor did they in any way  interfere with the old settlers, further, perhaps, than to remonstrate  with them on their manner of life, and surely that was no act that  called for violence.    But if there was no real cause for violence, it was easy to create an  imaginary one, and this was done. All manner of false accusations were  brought against the Saints. They were accused of tampering with the  negro slaves, with a view to creating a servile insurrection; and of  having a design to possess themselves of the land by force.    But it was their religion that was made the chief rock of offense.  It was denounced as blasphemy--\"derogatory of God and religion, and  subversive of human reason;\" and this because the Saints claimed  and enjoyed, to some extent at least, the power and blessings which  attended the gospel of Christ in ancient days. For these reasons(?) the  old settlers determined to rid themselves of the Saints, \"peaceably  if they could, forcibly if they must;\" and to the performance of  this unlawful action, they pledged their \"bodily power, their lives,  fortunes and sacred honors.\" They organized mobs; and, finally, with  acts of cruelty and violence that would bring the blush of shame to the  cheek of a savage, they drove the Saints from Jackson County; stole or  destroyed their goods, burned their houses and appropriated to their  own use the lands the Saints had purchased. There were some twelve  hundred Saints, men, women and children thus expelled by violence from  Jackson County.    This first driving took place in December, 1833.    The exiles found a temporary resting place in Clay County, and while  there petitioned the governor of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4532"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Photo Telephone or the Picture That Saved a Fortune (#9)"],[1,"right,\" Tom assured her, as she came up, gasping,  choking and crying hysterically. \"You're all right!\"    \"Is--is Minnie saved?\" she sobbed.    \"Yes, Grace! I'm here,\" answered the one Ned was supporting.    \"Oh, wasn't it terrible!\" cried the second girl Tom had saved.    \"I thought we would be drowned, even though we can swim.\"    \"Yes, it--it was so--so sudden!\" gasped her companion. \"What  happened?\"    \"The wash from that big boat upset you,\" explained Tom. \"That  fellow ought to be ashamed of himself, rushing along the way he  did. Now, can I take you girls anywhere? Your canoe seems to have  drifted off.\"    \"I have it!\" someone called. \"It's turned over, but I can tow it  to shore.\"    \"And I'll take the girls home,\" offered a gentleman in a large  rowboat. \"My wife will look after them. They live near us,\" and he  mentioned his own name and the names of the two girls Tom had  saved. The young inventor did not know them, but he introduced  himself and Ned.    \"This is the annual moonlight outing of our little boat club,\"  explained the man who had offered to look after the girls, \"and it  is the first time we ever had an accident. This was not our fault,  though.\"    \"Indeed it was not,\" agreed Tom, after he had helped the two  dripping young ladies into the rowboat. \"It was due to Mr.  Peters's speed mania.\"    \"I shall make a complaint against him to the navigation  authorities,\" said Mr. Ralston, who was looking after the girls.  \"He must think he, alone, has any rights on this lake.\"    With renewed thanks to Tom and Ned, the rescued girls were rowed  off to their homes, while the interrupted water carnival was  continued.    \"Some little excitement; eh, Tom?\" remarked Ned, when they were  once more under way.    \"Yes. We seem to run into that fellow Peters, or some of his  doings, quite often lately.\"    \"And it isn't a good sign, either,\" murmured Ned.    For some minutes after that Tom did not speak. In fact he was so  silent that Ned at last inquired:    \"What's the matter, Tom--in love?\"    \"Far from it. But, Ned, I've got an idea.\"    \"And I've got a wet suit of clothes where that nice young lady  fainted in my arms. I'm soaked.\"    \"That's what gave me the idea--the water, I mean. I noticed how  everything was reflected in it, and, do you know, Ned, I believe I  have been working on the wrong principle for my photo telephone.\"    \"Wrong, Tom, how is that?\"    \"Why, I've been using a dry plate, and I think I should have used  a wet one. You know how even in a little puddle of water on the  sidewalk you can see yourself reflected?\"    \"Yes, I've often seen that.\"    \"Well then, 'bless my watch chain!' as Mr. Damon would say, I  think I've got just what I want. I'm going to try a wet plate now,  and I think it will work. Come on now. Speed up! I'm in a great  big hurry to get home and try it!\"    \"Well, Tom, I sure will be glad if you've got the right idea,\"  laughed Ned. \"It will be worth getting wet through for, if you  strike something. Good luck!\"    Tom could hardly wait to fasten up his boat for the night, so  eager was he to get to his shop laboratory and try the new idea. A  gleam of hope had come to him.    It was still early evening, and Tom, when enticed out by Ned, had  left his photo telephone apparatus in readiness to go on with his  trials as soon as he should have come back.    \"Now for it, Ned!\" exclaimed the young inventor, as he took off  his coat. \"First I'll sensitize a selenium plate, and then I'll  wet it. Water is always a good conductor of electricity, and it's  a wonder that I forgot that when I was planning this photo  telephone. But seeing the sparkle of lights, and the reflection of  ourselves in the lake to-night, brought it back to me. Now then,  you haven't anything special to do; have you?\"    \"Not a thing, Tom.\"    \"That's good. Then you get in this other telephone closet--the one  in the casting shop. I'll put a prepared plate in there, and one  in the booth where I'm to sit. Then I'll switch on the current,  and we'll see if I can make you out, and you notice whether my  image appears on your plate.\"    It took some little time to make ready for this new test. Tom was  filled with enthusiasm, and he was sure it was going to be  successful this time. Ned watched him prepare the selenium  plates--plates that were so sensitive to illumination that, in the  dark, the metal would hardly transmit a current of electricity, but  in the light would do so readily, its conductivity depending on the  amount of light it received.    \"There, I guess we're all ready, Ned,\" announced Tom, at last.  \"Now you go to your little coop, and I'll shut myself up in mine.  We can talk over the telephone.\"    Seated in the little booth in one of the smaller of Tom's shops,  Ned proceeded with his part in the new experiment. A small shelf  had been fitted up in the booth, or closet, and on this was the  apparatus, consisting of a portable telephone set, and a small  box, in which was set a selenium plate. This plate had been wet by  a spray of water in order to test Tom's new theory.    In a similar booth, several hundred feet away, and in another  building, Tom took his place. The two booths were connected by  wires, and in each one was an electric light.    \"All ready, Ned?\" asked Tom, through the telephone.    \"All ready,\" came the answer.    \"Now then, turn on your switch--the one I showed you--and look  right at the sensitized plate. Then turn out your light, and  slowly turn it on. It's a new kind, and the light comes up  gradually, like gas or an oil lamp. Turn it on easily.\"    \"I get you, Tom.\"    Ned did as requested. Slowly the illumination in the booth  increased.    \"Do you get anything, Tom?\" asked Ned, over the wire.    \"Not yet,\" was the somewhat discouraged answer. \"Go ahead, turn on  more light, and keep your face close to the plate.\"    Ned did so.    \"How about it now?\" he asked, a moment later.    \"Nothing--yet,\" was the answer. And then suddenly Tom's voice rose  to a scream over the wire.    \"Ned--Ned! Quick!\" he called. \"Come here--I--I--\"    The voice died off into a meaningless gurgle.            CHAPTER X    MIDNIGHT VISITORS      Ned Newton never knew exactly how he got out of the telephone  booth. He seemed to give but one jump, tearing the clamped  receiver from his ear, and almost upsetting the photo apparatus in  his mad rush to help Tom. Certain it is, however, that he did get  out, and a few seconds later he was speeding toward the shop where  Tom had taken his position in a booth.    Ned burst in, crying out:    \"Tom! What is it? What happened? What's the matter?\"    There was no answer. Fearing the worst, Ned hurried to the small  booth, in one corner of the big, dimly lighted shop. He could see  Tom's lamp burning in the telephone compartment.    \"Tom! Tom!\" called the young banker.    Still there was no answer, and Ned, springing forward, threw open  the double, sound-proof door of the booth. Then he saw Tom lying  unconscious, with his head and arms on the table in front of him,  while the low buzzing of the electrical apparatus in the  transmitting box told that the current had not been shut off.    \"Tom! Tom!\" cried Ned in his chum's ear. He shook him by the  shoulder.    \"Are you hurt? What is the matter?\"    The young inventor seemed unconscious, and for a moment Ned had a  wild idea that Tom had been shocked to death, possibly by some  crossed live wire coming in contact with the telephone circuit.    \"But that couldn't have happened, or I'd have been shocked  myself,\" mused Ned.    Then he became aware of a curious, sweet, sickish odor in the  booth. It was overpowering. Ned felt himself growing dizzy.    \"I have it--chloroform!\" he gasped. \"In some way Tom has been  overcome by chloroform. I've got to get him to the fresh air.\"    Once he had solved the puzzle of Tom's unconsciousness, Ned was  quick to act. He caught Tom under the arms, and dragged him out of  the booth, and to the outer door of the shop. Almost before Ned  had reached there with his limp burden, Tom began to revive, and  soon the fresh, cool night air completed the work.    \"I--I,\" began the young inventor. \"Ned, I--I--\"    \"Now take it easy, Tom,\" advised his chum. \"You'll be all right in  a few minutes. What happened? Shall I call your father, or Koku?\"    \"No--don't. It would only--only alarm dad,\" faltered Tom. \"I'm  getting all right now. But he--he nearly had me, Ned!\"    \"He had you? What do you mean, Tom? Who had you?\"    \"I don't know who it was, but when I was talking to you over the  wire, all of a sudden I felt a hand behind me. It slipped over my  mouth and nose, and I smelled chloroform. I knew right away  something was wrong, and I called to you. That's all I remember. I  guess I must have gone off.\"    \"You did,\" spoke Ned. \"You were unconscious when I got to you. I  couldn't imagine what had happened. First I thought it was an  electrical shock. Then I smelled that chloroform. But who could it  have been, Tom?\"    \"Give it up, Ned! I haven't the slightest idea.\"    \"Could they have been going to rob you?\"    \"I haven't a thing but a nickel watch on me,\" went on Tom. \"I left  all my cash in the house. If it was robbery, it wasn't me,  personally, they were after.\"    \"What then? Some of your inventions?\"    \"That's my idea now, Ned. You remember some years ago Jake Burke  and his gang held me up and took one of dad's patents away from  me?\"    \"Yes, I've heard you mention that. It was when you first got your  motor cycle; wasn't it?\"    \"That's right. Well, what I was going to say was that they used  chloroform on me then, and--\"    \"You think this is the same crowd? Why, I thought they were  captured.\"    \"No, they got away, but I haven't heard anything of them in years.  Now it may be they have come back for revenge, for you know we got  back the stolen property.\"    \"That's right. Say, Tom, it might be so. What are you going to do  about it?\"    \"I"]]]
