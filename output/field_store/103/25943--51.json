(The  day) after to-morrow will be a festival (a general holiday); I will come  \"then\" (at that time).    \"ie\", place. \"Kie\" estas mia cxapelo? Gxi devas esti \"ie\", sed mi  sercxis gxin \"cxie\", kaj \"nenie\" mi povas trovi gxin. Ha, nun mi ekvidas  gxin \"tie\". \"Where\" is my hat? It must be \"somewhere\", but I have looked  for it \"everywhere\", and \"nowhere\" can I find it. Ha, now I see it  \"there\".    \"iel\", manner. \"Kiel\" vi faros tion cxi? Mi ne scias; mi \"cxiel\" provis  gxin fari, sed mi \"neniel\" sukcesis. Johano sukcesis \"iel\"; eble li  faris gxin \"tiel\". \"How\" will you do this? I do not know; I have tried  in every way to do it, but I have \"in no way\" (not at all) succeeded.  John succeeded \"in some way\" (somehow); perhaps he did it \"so (in such a  way\").    \"ies\", possession. \"Kies\" devo estas tio cxi? Eble gxi estas \"ties\";  sendube gxi estas \"ies\". \"Cxies\" devo estas \"nenies\". \"Whose\" duty  is this? Perhaps it is \"that one's (person's)\"; doubtless it is  \"somebody's. Everybody's\" duty is \"nobody's.\"    \"io\", thing. \"Kio\" malplacxas al vi? Nun \"nenio\" malplacxas al mi,  \"cxio\" estas bona. Antaux tri tagoj \"io\" tre malplacxis al mi, sed mi ne  parolas pri \"tio\" nun. \"What\" displeases you? Now \"nothing\" displeases  me, \"all\" is well. Three days ago \"something\" greatly displeased me, but  I am not speaking about \"that\" now.    \"iom\", quantity. \"Kiom\" da mono vi bezonas? Mi havas \"tiom\", mi povas  prunti al vi \"iom\", sed ne \"cxiom\". Se mi pruntus al vi \"cxiom\", mi mem  havus \"neniom\". \"How much\" money do you need ? I have \"so much (that  quantity)\", I can lend you \"some\", but not \"all\". If I were to lend you  \"all\", I myself should have \"none\".    \"iu\" denotes individuality, person, or thing specified. \"Kiu\" estis cxe  la balo? \"Cxiu, kiu\" estis invitita, estis tie, \"neniu\" forestis. \"Iu,  kiun\" mi mem ne konas, venis kun \"tiu kiu\" vizitis vin hierau. \"Who\" was  at the ball? \"Everybody who\" had been invited was there, \"nobody\" was  absent. \"Somebody, whom\" I myself do not know, came with \"that person  who\" visited you yesterday.    It will be seen from these examples that the words beginning with  \"K\" either \"ask questions\" or \"refer\" to some person or thing before  mentioned. Those beginning with \"T\" point to a \"definite\" time, place,  etc. Those with \"Cx\" signify \"each\" or \"every\", and in the plural \"all\".  Those without a letter prefixed are \"indefinite\", meaning some or any;  and those with \"nen-\" are \"negative\", meaning \"no, none\".    The words ending in \"ia\" and those in \"iu\" can take the plural \"j\" and  accusative \"n\".    The words in \"io\" take \"n\", but the sense does not permit of their  taking \"j\".    The words in \"ie\" take the \"n\" denoting direction.    The word \"cxi\", signifying nearness, is used with the \"T\" series (words  meaning \"that\"), to denote the one near \"i.e., this\", as \"Tio cxi\", this  thing; \"Tiu cxi\", this person; \"Tie cxi\", or, \"cxi tie\", here, etc.    The word \"ajn\", ever, is used with the \"K\" series to give a more  inclusive and wider meaning, as \"Kio ajn\", whatever; \"Kiu ajn\", whoever;  \"Kiam ajn\", whenever; \"Kiom ajn\", however much.    Comparisons of equality are made with the words--    \"tiel ... kiel\", as Vi estas \"tiel\" forta, \"kiel\" mi, You are \"as\"  strong \"as\" I.    \"tia ... kia\", as \"Tia\" domo, \"kia\" tiu, estas malofta, \"Such\" a house  \"as\" that is rare.    \"sama ... kia\", as Mia bastono estas \"tia sama, kia\" la via, My stick  is \"the same as\" yours.    \"sama ... kiel\", as Gxia uzado estas \"tia sama, kiel\" en la aliaj  lingvoj, Its use is \"the same as\" in the other languages. Vi cxiam  laboradas al tiu \"sama\" celo, \"kiel\" mi, You are always working towards  that \"same\" end (aim) \"as\" I.    Any of the above series of words whose sense admits of it can be used as  adjectives, adverbs, etc., and in combination with prefixes, suffixes,  or other words, as \"cxiama\", continual, eternal; \"tiea\", of that place.  \"Kioma\" is used for asking the time, as \"Kioma horo estas\"? What time is  it?

The knowledge of his plans was confined to  himself and the Headmaster. His dorm-master would imagine that he was  going to stay on till the last day of term. Therefore, if he  misbehaved himself in form, Mr. Langridge would set him lines in  blissful ignorance of the fact that he would not be there next day to  show them up. At the beginning of the following term, moreover, he  would not be in Mr. Langridge's form, for he was certain of his move  up.    He acted accordingly.    He spent the earlier part of Wednesday morning in breaches of the  peace. Mr. Langridge, instead of pulling him up, put him on to  translate; Dunstable went on to translate. As he had not prepared the  lesson and was not an adept at construing unseen, his performance was  poor.    After a minute and a half, the form-master wearied.    \"Have you looked at this, Dunstable?\" he asked.    There was a time-honoured answer to this question.    \"Yes, sir,\" he said.    Public-school ethics do not demand that you should reply truthfully to  the spirit of a question. The letter of it is all that requires  attention. Dunstable had _looked_ at the lesson. He was looking  at it then. Masters should practise exactness of speech. A certain  form at Harrow were in the habit of walking across a copy of a Latin  author before morning-school. They could then say with truth that they  \"had been over it.\" This is not an isolated case.    \"Go on,\" said Mr. Langridge.    Dunstable smiled as he did so.    Mr. Langridge was annoyed.    \"What are you laughing at? What do you mean by it? Stand up. You will  write out the lesson in Latin and English, and show it up to me by  four this afternoon. I know what you are thinking. You imagine that  because this is the end of the term you can do as you please, but you  will find yourself mistaken. Mind--by four o'clock.\"    At four o'clock Dunstable was enjoying an excellent tea in Green  Street, Park Lane, and telling his mother that he had had a most  enjoyable term, marred by no unpleasantness whatever. His holidays  were sweetened by the thought of Mr. Langridge's baffled wrath on  discovering the true inwardness of the recent episode.            *       *         *        *       *    When he returned to Locksley at the beginning of the winter term, he  was at once made aware that that episode was not to be considered  closed. On the first evening, Mr. Day, his housemaster, sent for him.    \"Well, Dunstable,\" he said, \"where is that imposition?\"    Dunstable affected ignorance.    \"Please, sir, you set me no imposition.\"    \"No, Dunstable, no.\" Mr. Day peered at him gravely through his  spectacles. \"_I_ set you no imposition; but Mr. Langridge did.\"    Dunstable imitated that eminent tactician, Br'er Rabbit. He \"lay low  and said nuffin.\"    \"Surely,\" continued Mr. Day, in tones of mild reproach, \"you did not  think that you could take Mr. Langridge in?\"    Dunstable rather thought he _had_ taken Mr. Langridge in; but he  made no reply.    \"Well,\" said Mr. Day. \"I must set you some punishment. I shall give  the butler instructions to hand you a note from me at three o'clock  to-morrow.\" (The next day was a half-holiday.) \"In that note you will  find indicated what I wish you to write out.\"    Why this comic-opera secret-society business, Dunstable wondered. Then  it dawned upon him. Mr. Day wished to break up his half-holiday  thoroughly.    That afternoon Dunstable retired in disgust to his study to brood over  his wrongs; to him entered Charles, his friend, one C. J. Linton, to  wit, of Seymour's, a very hearty sportsman.    \"Good,\" said Linton. \"Didn't think I should find you in. Thought you  might have gone off somewhere as it's such a ripping day. Tell you  what we'll do. Scull a mile or two up the river and have tea  somewhere.\"    \"I should like to awfully,\" said Dunstable, \"but I'm afraid I can't.\"    And he explained Mr. Day's ingenious scheme for preventing him from  straying that afternoon.    \"Rot, isn't it,\" he said.    \"Beastly. Wouldn't have thought old Day had it in him. But I'll tell  you what,\" he said. \"Do the impot now, and then you'll be able to  start at three sharp, and we shall get in a good time on the river.  Day always sets the same thing. I've known scores of chaps get impots  from him, and they all had to do the Greek numerals. He's mad on the  Greek numerals. Never does anything else. You'll be as safe as  anything if you do them. Buck up, I'll help.\"    They accordingly sat down there and then. By three o'clock an imposing  array of sheets of foolscap covered with badly-written Greek lay on  the study table.    \"That ought to be enough,\" said Linton, laying down his pen. \"He can't  set you more than we've done, I should think.\"    \"Rummy how alike our writing looks,\" said Dunstable, collecting the  sheets and examining them. \"You can hardly tell which is which even  when you know. Well, there goes three. My watch is slow, as it always  is. I'll go and get that note.\"    Two minutes later he returned, full of abusive references to Mr. Day.  The crafty pedagogue appeared to have foreseen Dunstable's attempt to  circumvent him by doing the Greek numerals on the chance of his  setting them. The imposition he had set in his note was ten pages of  irregular verbs, and they were to be shown up in his study before five  o'clock. Linton's programme for the afternoon was out of the question  now. But he loyally gave up any other plans which he might have formed  in order to help Dunstable with his irregular verbs. Dunstable was too  disgusted with fate to be properly grateful.    \"And the worst of it is,\" he said, as they adjourned for tea at  half-past four, having deposited the verbs on Mr. Day's table, \"that  all those numerals will be wasted now.\"    \"I should keep them, though,\" said Linton. \"They may come in useful.  You never know.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Towards the end of the second week of term Fate, by way of  compensation, allowed Dunstable a distinct stroke of luck. Mr. Forman,  the master of his new form, set him a hundred lines of Virgil, and  told him to show them up next day. To Dunstable's delight, the next  day passed without mention of them; and when the day after that went  by, and still nothing was said, he came to the conclusion that Mr.  Forman had forgotten all about them.    Which was indeed the case. Mr. Forman was engaged in editing a new  edition of the \"Bacchae,\" and was apt to be absent-minded in  consequence. So Dunstable, with a glad smile, hove the lines into a  cupboard in his study to keep company with the Greek numerals which he  had done for Mr. Day, and went out to play fives with Linton.    Linton, curiously enough, had also had a stroke of luck in a rather  similar way. He told Dunstable about it as they strolled back to the  houses after their game.    \"Bit of luck this afternoon,\" he said. \"You remember Appleby setting  me a hundred-and-fifty the day before yesterday? Well, I showed  them up to-day, and he looked through them and chucked them into the  waste-paper basket under his desk. I thought at the time I hadn't seen  him muck them up at all with his pencil, which is his usual game, so  after he had gone at the end of school I nipped to the basket and  fished them out. They were as good as new, so I saved them up in case  I get any more.\"    Dunstable hastened to tell of his own good fortune. Linton was  impressed by the coincidence.    \"I tell you what,\" he said, \"we score either way. Because if we never  get any more lines----\"    Dunstable laughed.    \"Yes, I know,\" Linton went on, \"we're bound to. But even supposing we  don't, what we've got in stock needn't be wasted.\"    \"I don't see that,\" said Dunstable. \"Going to have 'em bound in cloth  and published? Or were you thinking of framing them?\"    \"Why, don't you see? Sell them, of course. There are dozens of chaps  in the school who would be glad of a few hundred lines cheap.\"    \"It wouldn't work. They'd be spotted.\"    \"Rot. It's been done before, and nobody said anything. A chap in  Seymour's who left last Easter sold all his stock lines by auction on  the last day of term. They were Virgil mostly and Greek numerals. They  sold like hot cakes. There were about five hundred of them altogether.  And I happen to know that every word of them has been given up and  passed all right.\"    \"Well, I shall keep mine,\" said Dunstable. \"I am sure to want all the  lines in stock that I can get. I used to think Langridge was fairly  bad in the way of impots, but Forman takes the biscuit easily. It  seems to be a sort of hobby of his. You can't stop him.\"    But it was not until the middle of preparation that the great idea  flashed upon Dunstable's mind.    It was the simplicity of the thing that took his breath away. That and  its possibilities. This was the idea. Why not start a Lines Trust in  the school? An agency for supplying lines at moderate rates to all who  desired them? There did not seem to be a single flaw in the scheme. He  and Linton between them could turn out enough material in a week to  give the Trust a good working capital. And as for the risk of  detection when customers came to show up the goods supplied to them,  that was very slight. As has been pointed out before, there was  practically one handwriting common to the whole school when it came to  writing lines. It resembled the movements of a fly that had fallen  into an ink-pot, and subsequently taken a little brisk exercise on a  sheet of foolscap by way of restoring the circulation. Then, again,  the attitude of the master to whom the lines were shown was not likely  to be critical. So that everything seemed in favour of Dunstable's  scheme.    Linton, to whom he confided it, was inclined to scoff at first, but  when he had had the beauties of the idea explained to him at length,  became an enthusiastic supporter of the scheme.    \"But,\" he objected, \"it"]]]
