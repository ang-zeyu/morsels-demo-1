And she sat on the arm of it with her  mournful eyes on his face.    \"Whatever your name may be, that doesn't change the man who wears the  name.\"    He laughed softly. \"And you've been teaching me steadily for twenty-four  years that blood will tell? You can't change like this. Oh, I understand  it perfectly. You determined to make me over. You determined to destroy  my heritage and put the name of the fine old Colbys in its place. It was  a brave thing to try, and all these years how you must have waited, and  waited to see how I would turn out, dreading every day some outbreak of  the bad blood! Ah, you have a nerve of steel, Aunt Elizabeth! How have  you endured the suspense?\"    She felt that he was mocking her subtly under this flow of compliment.  But it was the bitterness of pain, not of reproach, she knew.    She said: \"Why didn't you let me come up with you? Why didn't you send  for me?\"    \"I've been busy doing a thing that no one could help me with. I've been  burning my dreams.\" He pointed to a smoldering heap of ashes on the  hearth.    \"Terry!\"    \"Yes, all the Colby pictures that I've been collecting for the past  fifteen years. I burned 'em. They don't mean anything to anyone else, and  certainly they have ceased to mean anything to me. But when I came to  Anthony Colby--the eighteen-twelve man, you know, the one who has always  been my hero--it went pretty hard. I felt as if--I were burning my own  personality. As a matter of fact, in the last couple of hours I've been  born over again.\"    Terry paused. \"And births are painful, Aunt Elizabeth!\"    At that she cried out and caught his hand. \"Terry dear! Terry dear! You  break my heart!\"    \"I don't mean to. You mustn't think that I'm pitying myself. But I want  to know the real name of my father. He must have had some name other than  Black Jack. What was it?\"    \"Are you going to gather his memory to your heart, Terry?\"    \"I am going to find something about him that I can be proud of. Blood  will tell. I know that I'm not all bad, and there must have been good in  Black Jack. I want to know all about him. I want to know about--his  crimes.\"    He labored through a fierce moment of silent struggle while her heart  went helplessly out to him.    \"Because--I had a hand in every one of those crimes! Everything that he  did is something that I might have done under the same temptation.\"    \"But you're not all your father's son. You had a mother. A dear, sweet-  faced girl--\"    \"Don't!\" whispered Terry. \"I suppose he broke--her heart?\"    \"She was a very delicate girl,\" she said after a moment.    \"And now my father's name, please?\"    \"Not that just now. Give me until tomorrow night, Terry. Will you do  that? Will you wait till tomorrow night, Terry? I'm going to have a long  talk with you then, about many things. And I want you to keep this in  mind always. No matter how long you live, the influence of the Colbys  will never go out of your life. And neither will my influence, I hope. If  there is anything good in me, it has gone into you. I have seen to that.  Terry, you are not your father's son alone. All these other things have  entered into your make-up. They're just as much a part of you as his  blood.\"    \"Ah, yes,\" said Terry. \"But blood will tell!\"    It was a mournful echo of a thing she had told him a thousand times.        CHAPTER 9      She went straight down to the big living room and drew Vance away,  mindless of her guests. He came humming until he was past the door and in  the shadowy hall. Then he touched her arm, suddenly grown serious.    \"What's wrong, Elizabeth?\"    Her voice was low, vibrating with fierceness. And Vance blessed the  dimness of the hall, for he could feel the blood recede from his face and  the sweat stand on his forehead.    \"Vance, if you've done what I think you've done, you're lower than a  snake, and more poisonous and more treacherous. And I'll cut you out of  my heart and my life. You know what I mean?\"    It was really the first important crisis that he had ever faced. And now  his heart grew small, cold. He knew, miserably, his own cowardice. And  like all cowards, he fell back on bold lying to carry him through. It was  a triumph that he could make his voice steady--more than steady. He could  even throw the right shade of disgust into it.    \"Is this another one of your tantrums, Elizabeth? By heavens, I'm growing  tired of 'em. You continually throw in my face that you hold the strings  of the purse. Well, tie them up as far as I'm concerned. I won't whine.  I'd rather have that happen than be tyrannized over any longer.\"    She was much shaken. And there was a sting in this reproach that carried  home to her; there was just a sufficient edge of truth to wound her. Had  there been much light, she could have read his face; the dimness of the  hall was saving Vance, and he knew it.    \"God knows I'd like to believe that you haven't had anything to do with  it. But you and I are the only two people in the world who know the  secret of it--\"    He pretended to guess. \"It's something about Terence? Something about his  father?\"    Again she was disarmed. If he were guilty, it was strange that he should  approach the subject so openly. And she began to doubt.    \"Vance, he knows everything! Everything except the real name of Black  Jack!\"    \"Good heavens!\"    She strained her eyes through the shadows to make out his real  expression; but there seemed to be a real horror in his restrained  whisper.    \"It isn't possible, Elizabeth!\"    \"It came in that letter. That letter I wanted to open, and which you  persuaded me not to!\" She mustered all her damning facts one after  another. \"And it was postmarked from Craterville. Vance, you have been in  Craterville lately!\"    He seemed to consider.    \"Could I have told anyone? Could I, possibly? No, Elizabeth, I'll give  you my word of honor that I've never spoken a syllable about that subject  to anyone!\"    \"Ah, but what have you written?\"    \"I've never put pen to paper. But--how did it happen?\"    He had control of himself now. His voice was steadier. He could feel her  recede from her aggressiveness.    \"It was dated after you left Craterville, of course. And--I can't stand  imagining that you could be so low. Only, who else would have a motive?\"    \"But how was it done?\"    \"They sent him an article about his father and a picture of Black Jack  that happens to look as much like Terry as two peas.\"    \"Then I have it! If the picture looks like Terry, someone took it for  granted that he'd be interested in the similarity. That's why it was  sent. Unless they told him that he was really Black Jack's son. Did the  person who sent the letter do that?\"    \"There was no letter. Only a magazine clipping and the photograph of the  painting.\"    They were both silent. Plainly she had dismissed all idea of her  brother's guilt.    \"But what are we going to do, Elizabeth? And how has he taken it?\"    \"Like poison, Vance. He--he burned all the Colby pictures. Oh, Vance,  twenty-four years of work are thrown away!\"    \"Nonsense! This will all straighten out. I'm glad he's found out. Sooner  or later he was pretty sure to. Such things will come to light.\"    \"Vance, you'll help me? You'll forgive me for accusing you, and you'll  help me to keep Terry in hand for the next few days? You see, he declared  that he will not be ashamed of his father.\"    \"You can't blame him for that.\"    \"God knows I blame no one but myself.\"    \"I'll help you with every ounce of strength in my mind and body, my  dear.\"    She pressed his hand in silence.    \"I'm going up to talk with him now,\" he said. \"I'm going to do what I can  with him. You go in and talk. And don't let them see that anything is  wrong.\"    The door had not been locked again. He entered at the call of Terry and  found him leaning over the hearth stirring up the pile of charred paper  to make it burn more freely. A shadow crossed the face of Terry as he saw  his visitor, but he banished it at once and rose to greet him. In his  heart Vance was a little moved. He went straight to the younger man and  took his hand.    \"Elizabeth has told me,\" he said gently, and he looked with a moist eye  into the face of the man who, if his plans worked out, would be either  murderer or murdered before the close of the next day. \"I am very sorry,  Terence.\"    \"I thought you came to congratulate me,\" said Terry, withdrawing his  hand.    \"Congratulate you?\" echoed Vance, with unaffected astonishment.    \"For having learned the truth,\" said Terry. \"Also, for having a father  who was a strong man.\"    Vance could not resist the opening.    \"In a way, I suppose he was,\" he said dryly. \"And if you look at it in  that way, I do congratulate you, Terence!\"    \"You've always hated me, Uncle Vance,\" Terry declared. \"I've known it all  these years. And I'll do without your congratulations.\"    \"You're wrong, Terry,\" said Vance. He kept his voice mild. \"You're very  wrong. But I'm old enough not to take offense at what a young spitfire  says.\"    \"I suppose you are,\" retorted Terry, in a tone which implied that he  himself would never reach that age.    \"And when a few years run by,\" went on Vance, \"you'll change your  viewpoint. In the meantime, my boy, let me give you this warning. No  matter what you think about me, it is Elizabeth who counts.\"    \"Thanks. You need have no fear about my attitude to Aunt Elizabeth. You  ought to know that I love her, and respect her.\"    \"Exactly. But you're headstrong, Terry. Very headstrong. And so is  Elizabeth. Take your own case. She took you into the family for the sake  of a theory. Did you know that?\"    The boy stiffened. \"A theory?\"    \"Quite so. She wished to prove that blood, after all, was more talk than  a vital influence. So she took you in and gave you an imaginary line of  ancestors with which you were entirely contented. But, after all, it has  been twenty-four years"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9932"],[0,"The Last Trail (#9)"],[1,"of the mighty hunter reassured  Colonel Zane.    When the colonel returned from his chase of the previous night, he  went directly to the stable, there to find that the Indians had made  off with a thoroughbred, and Betty's pony. Colonel Zane was furious,  not on account of the value of the horses, but because Bess was his  favorite bay, and Betty loved nothing more than her pony Madcap. To  have such a march stolen on him after he had heard and seen the  thieves was indeed hard. High time it was that these horse thieves be  run to earth. No Indian had planned these marauding expeditions. An  intelligent white man was at the bottom of the thieving, and he should  pay for his treachery.    The colonel's temper, however, soon cooled. He realized after thinking  over the matter, that he was fortunate it passed off without  bloodshed. Very likely the intent had been to get all his horses,  perhaps his neighbor's as well, and it had been partly frustrated by  Jonathan's keen sagacity. These Shawnees, white leader or not, would  never again run such risks.    \"It's like a skulking Shawnee,\" muttered Colonel Zane, \"to slip down  here under cover of early dusk, when no one but an Indian hunter could  detect him. I didn't look for trouble, especially so soon after the  lesson we gave Girty and his damned English and redskins. It's lucky  Jonathan was here. I'll go back to the old plan of stationing scouts  at the outposts until snow flies.\"    While Colonel Zane talked to himself and paced the path he had  selected to patrol, the white mists cleared, and a rosy hue followed  the brightening in the east. The birds ceased twittering to break into  gay songs, and the cock in the barnyard gave one final clarion-voiced  salute to the dawn. The rose in the east deepened into rich red, and  then the sun peeped over the eastern hilltops to drench the valley  with glad golden light.    A blue smoke curling lazily from the stone chimney of his cabin,  showed that Sam had made the kitchen fire, and a little later a rich,  savory odor gave pleasing evidence that his wife was cooking  breakfast.    \"Any sign of Jack?\" a voice called from the open door, and Betty  appeared.    \"Nary sign.\"    \"Of the Indians, then?\"    \"Well, Betts, they left you a token of their regard,\" and Colonel Zane  smiled as he took a broken halter from the fence.    \"Madcap?\" cried Betty.    \"Yes, they've taken Madcap and Bess.\"    \"Oh, the villains! Poor pony,\" exclaimed Betty indignantly. \"Eb, I'll  coax Wetzel to fetch the pony home if he has to kill every Shawnee in  the valley.\"    \"Now you're talking, Betts,\" Colonel Zane replied. \"If you could get  Lew to do that much, you'd be blessed from one end of the border to  the other.\"    He walked up the road; then back, keeping a sharp lookout on all  sides, and bestowing a particularly keen glance at the hillside across  the ravine, but could see no sign of the bordermen. As it was now  broad daylight he felt convinced that further watch was unnecessary,  and went in to breakfast. When he came out again the villagers were  astir. The sharp strokes of axes rang out on the clear morning air,  and a mellow anvil-clang pealed up from the blacksmith shop. Colonel  Zane found his brother Silas and Jim Douns near the gate.    \"Morning, boys,\" he cried cheerily.    \"Any glimpse of Jack or Lew?\" asked Silas.    \"No; but I'm expecting one of 'em any moment.\"    \"How about the Indians?\" asked Douns. \"Silas roused me out last night;  but didn't stay long enough to say more than 'Indians.'\"    \"I don't know much more than Silas. I saw several of the red devils  who stole the horses; but how many, where they've gone, or what we're  to expect, I can't say. We've got to wait for Jack or Lew. Silas, keep  the garrison in readiness at the fort, and don't allow a man, soldier  or farmer, to leave the clearing until further orders. Perhaps there  were only three of those Shawnees, and then again the woods might have  been full of them. I take it something's amiss, or Jack and Lew would  be in by now.\"    \"Here come Sheppard and his girl,\" said Silas, pointing down the lane.  \"'Pears George is some excited.\"    Colonel Zane had much the same idea as he saw Sheppard and his  daughter. The old man appeared in a hurry, which was sufficient reason  to believe him anxious or alarmed, and Helen looked pale.    \"Ebenezer, what's this I hear about Indians?\" Sheppard asked  excitedly. \"What with Helen's story about the fort being besieged, and  this brother of yours routing honest people from their beds, I haven't  had a wink of sleep. What's up? Where are the redskins?\"    \"Now, George, be easy,\" said Colonel Zane calmly. \"And you, Helen,  mustn't be frightened. There's no danger. We did have a visit from  Indians last night; but they hurt no one, and got only two horses.\"    \"Oh, I'm so relieved that it's not worse,\" said Helen.    \"It's bad enough, Helen,\" Betty cried, her black eyes flashing, \"my  pony Madcap is gone.\"    \"Colonel Zane, come here quick!\" cried Douns, who stood near the gate.    With one leap Colonel Zane was at the gate, and, following with his  eyes the direction indicated by Douns' trembling finger, he saw two  tall, brown figures striding down the lane. One carried two rifles,  and the other a long bundle wrapped in a blanket.    \"It's Jack and Wetzel,\" whispered Colonel Zane to Jim. \"They've got  the girl, and by God! from the way that bundle hangs, I think she's  dead. Here,\" he added, speaking loudly, \"you women get into  the house.\"    Mrs. Zane, Betty and Helen stared.    \"Go into the house!\" he cried authoritatively.    Without a protest the three women obeyed.    At that moment Nellie Douns came across the lane; Sam shuffled out  from the backyard, and Sheppard arose from his seat on the steps. They  joined Colonel Zane, Silas and Jim at the gate.    \"I wondered what kept you so late,\" Colonel Zane said to Jonathan, as  he and his companion came up. \"You've fetched Mabel, and she's----\".  The good man could say no more. If he should live an hundred years on  the border amid savage murderers, he would still be tender-hearted.  Just now he believed the giant borderman by the side of Jonathan held  a dead girl, one whom he had danced, when a child, upon his knee.    \"Mabel, an' jest alive,\" replied Jonathan.    \"By God! I'm glad!\" exclaimed Colonel Zane. \"Here, Lew, give her to  me.\"    Wetzel relinquished his burden to the colonel.    \"Lew, any bad Indian sign?\" asked Colonel Zane as he turned to go into  the house.    The borderman shook his head.    \"Wait for me,\" added the colonel.    He carried the girl to that apartment in the cabin which served the  purpose of a sitting-room, and laid her on a couch. He gently removed  the folds of the blanket, disclosing to view a fragile,  white-faced girl.    \"Bess, hurry, hurry!\" he screamed to his wife, and as she came running  in, followed no less hurriedly by Betty, Helen and Nellie, he  continued, \"Here's Mabel Lane, alive, poor child; but in sore need of  help. First see whether she has any bodily injury. If a bullet must be  cut out, or a knife-wound sewed up, it's better she remained  unconscious. Betty, run for Bess's instruments, and bring brandy and  water. Lively now!\" Then he gave vent to an oath and left the room.    Helen, her heart throbbing wildly, went to the side of Mrs. Zane, who  was kneeling by the couch. She saw a delicate girl, not over eighteen  years old, with a face that would have been beautiful but for the set  lips, the closed eyelids, and an expression of intense pain.    \"Oh! Oh!\" breathed Helen.    \"Nell, hand me the scissors,\" said Mrs. Zane, \"and help me take off  this dress. Why, it's wet, but, thank goodness! 'tis not with blood. I  know that slippery touch too well. There, that's right. Betty, give me  a spoonful of brandy. Now heat a blanket, and get one of your linsey  gowns for this poor child.\"    Helen watched Mrs. Zane as if fascinated. The colonel's wife continued  to talk while with deft fingers she forced a few drops of brandy  between the girl's closed teeth. Then with the adroitness of a skilled  surgeon, she made the examination. Helen had heard of this pioneer  woman's skill in setting broken bones and treating injuries, and when  she looked from the calm face to the steady fingers, she had no doubt  as to the truth of what had been told.    \"Neither bullet wound, cut, bruise, nor broken bone,\" said Mrs. Zane.  \"It's fear, starvation, and the terrible shock.\"    She rubbed Mabel's hands while gazing at her pale face. Then she  forced more brandy between the tightly-closed lips. She was rewarded  by ever so faint a color tinging the wan cheeks, to be followed by a  fluttering of the eyelids. Then the eyes opened wide. They were large,  soft, dark and humid with agony.    Helen could not bear their gaze. She saw the shadow of death, and of  worse than death. She looked away, while in her heart rose a storm of  passionate fury at the brutes who had made of this tender girl  a wreck.    The room was full of women now, sober-faced matrons and grave-eyed  girls, yet all wore the same expression, not alone of anger, nor fear,  nor pity, but of all combined.    Helen instinctively felt that this was one of the trials of border  endurance, and she knew from the sterner faces of the maturer women  that such a trial was familiar. Despite all she had been told, the  shock and pain were too great, and she went out of the room sobbing.    She almost fell over the broad back of Jonathan Zane who was sitting  on the steps. Near him stood Colonel Zane talking with a tall man clad  in faded buckskin.    \"Lass, you shouldn't have stayed,\" said Colonel Zane kindly.    \"It's--hurt--me--here,\" said Helen, placing her hand over her heart.    \"Yes, I know, I know; of course it has,\" he replied, taking her hand.  \"But be brave, Helen, bear up, bear up. Oh! this border is a stern  place! Do not think of that poor girl. Come, let me"]]]
