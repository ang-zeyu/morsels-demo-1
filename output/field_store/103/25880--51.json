Idle complaints, from which one ought to screen  The queen's too tender heart.    PAULET.                  What it contains  She did not hide from me; she asks a boon;  She begs to be admitted to the grace  Of speaking with the queen.    BURLEIGH.                 It cannot be.    TALBOT.  Why not? Her supplication's not unjust.    BURLEIGH.  For her, the base encourager of murder;  Her, who hath thirsted for our sovereign's blood,  The privilege to see the royal presence  Is forfeited: a faithful counsellor  Can never give this treacherous advice.    TALBOT.  And if the queen is gracious, sir, are you  The man to hinder pity's soft emotions?    BURLEIGH.  She is condemned to death; her head is laid  Beneath the axe, and it would ill become  The queen to see a death-devoted head.  The sentence cannot have its execution  If the queen's majesty approaches her,  For pardon still attends the royal presence,  As sickness flies the health-dispensing hand.    ELIZABETH (having read the letter, dries her tears).  Oh, what is man! What is the bliss of earth!  To what extremities is she reduced  Who with such proud and splendid hopes began!  Who, called to sit on the most ancient throne  Of Christendom, misled by vain ambition,  Hoped with a triple crown to deck her brows!  How is her language altered, since the time  When she assumed the arms of England's crown,  And by the flatterers of her court was styled  Sole monarch of the two Britannic isles!  Forgive me, lords, my heart is cleft in twain,  Anguish possesses me, and my soul bleeds  To think that earthly goods are so unstable,  And that the dreadful fate which rules mankind  Should threaten mine own house, and scowl so near me.    TALBOT.  Oh, queen! the God of mercy hath informed  Your heart; Oh! hearken to this heavenly guidance.  Most grievously, indeed, hath she atoned.  Her grievous crime, and it is time that now,  At last, her heavy penance have an end.  Stretch forth your hand to raise this abject queen,  And, like the luminous vision of an angel,  Descend into her gaol's sepulchral night.    BURLEIGH.  Be steadfast, mighty queen; let no emotion  Of seeming laudable humanity  Mislead thee; take not from thyself the power  Of acting as necessity commands.  Thou canst not pardon her, thou canst not save her:  Then heap not on thyself the odious blame,  That thou, with cruel and contemptuous triumph,  Didst glut thyself with gazing on thy victim.    LEICESTER.  Let us, my lords, remain within our bounds;  The queen is wise, and doth not need our counsels  To lead her to the most becoming choice.  This meeting of the queens hath naught in common  With the proceedings of the court of justice.  The law of England, not the monarch's will,  Condemns the Queen of Scotland, and 'twere worthy  Of the great soul of Queen Elizabeth,  To follow the soft dictates of her heart,  Though justice swerves not from its rigid path.    ELIZABETH.  Retire, my lords. We shall, perhaps, find means  To reconcile the tender claims of pity  With what necessity imposes on us.  And now retire.     [The LORDS retire; she calls SIR EDWARD MORTIMER back.           Sir Edward Mortimer!        SCENE V.       ELIZABETH, MORTIMER.    ELIZABETH (having measured him for some time with her eyes in silence).  You've shown a spirit of adventurous courage  And self-possession, far beyond your years.  He who has timely learnt to play so well  The difficult dissembler's needful task  Becomes a perfect man before his time,  And shortens his probationary years.  Fate calls you to a lofty scene of action;  I prophesy it, and can, happily  For you, fulfil, myself, my own prediction.    MORTIMER.  Illustrious mistress, what I am, and all  I can accomplish, is devoted to you.    ELIZABETH.  You've made acquaintance with the foes of England.  Their hate against me is implacable;  Their fell designs are inexhaustible.  As yet, indeed, Almighty Providence  Hath shielded me; but on my brows the crown  Forever trembles, while she lives who fans  Their bigot-zeal, and animates their hopes.    MORTIMER.  She lives no more, as soon as you command it.    ELIZABETH.  Oh, sir! I thought I saw my labors end,  And I am come no further than at first,  I wished to let the laws of England act,  And keep my own hands pure from blood's defilement.  The sentence is pronounced--what gain I by it?  It must be executed, Mortimer,  And I must authorize the execution.  The blame will ever light on me, I must  Avow it, nor can save appearances.  That is the worst----    MORTIMER.             But can appearances  Disturb your conscience where the cause is just?    ELIZABETH.  You are unpractised in the world, sir knight;  What we appear, is subject to the judgment  Of all mankind, and what we are, of no man.  No one will be convinced that I am right:  I must take care that my connivance in  Her death be wrapped in everlasting doubt.  In deeds of such uncertain double visage  Safety lies only in obscurity.  Those measures are the worst that stand avowed;  What's not abandoned, is not wholly lost.    MORTIMER (seeking to learn her meaning).  Then it perhaps were best----    ELIZABETH (quick).                 Ay, surely 'twere  The best; Oh, sir, my better angel speaks  Through you;--go on then, worthy sir, conclude  You are in earnest, you examine deep,  Have quite a different spirit from your uncle.    MORTIMER (surprised).  Have you imparted then your wishes to him?    ELIZABETH.  I am sorry that I have.    MORTIMER.               Excuse his age,  The old man is grown scrupulous; such bold  Adventures ask the enterprising heart  Of youth----    ELIZABETH.  And may I venture then on you----    MORTIMER.  My hand I'll lend thee; save then as thou canst  Thy reputation----    ELIZABETH.           Yes, sir; if you could  But waken me some morning with this news  \"Maria Stuart, your bloodthirsty foe,  Breathed yesternight her last\"----    MORTIMER.                   Depend on me.    ELIZABETH.  When shall my head lie calmly down to sleep?    MORTIMER.  The next new moon will terminate thy fears.    ELIZABETH.  And be the selfsame happy day the dawn  Of your preferment--so God speed you, sir;  And be not hurt, if, chance, my thankfulness  Should wear the mask of darkness. Silence is  The happy suitor's god. The closest bonds,  The dearest, are the works of secrecy.                       [Exit.        SCENE VI.       MORTIMER (alone).    Go, false, deceitful queen! As thou deludest  The world, e'en so I cozen thee; 'tis right,  Thus to betray thee; 'tis a worthy deed.  Look I then like a murderer? Hast thou read  Upon my brow such base dexterity?  Trust only to my arm, and keep thine own  Concealed--assume the pious outward show  Of mercy 'fore the world, while reckoning  In secret on my murderous aid; and thus  By gaining time we shall insure her rescue.  Thou wilt exalt me!--show'st me from afar  The costly recompense: but even were  Thyself the prize, and all thy woman's favor,  What art thou, poor one, and what canst thou proffer?  I scorn ambition's avaricious strife,  With her alone is all the charm of life,  O'er her, in rounds of endless glory, hover  Spirits with grace, and youth eternal blessed,  Celestial joy is throned upon her breast.  Thou hast but earthly, mortal goods to offer--  That sovereign good, for which all else be slighted,  When heart in heart, delighting and delighted;  Together flow in sweet forgetfulness;--  Ne'er didst thou woman's fairest crown possess,  Ne'er hast thou with thy hand a lover's heart requited.  I must attend Lord Leicester, and deliver  Her letter to him--'tis a hateful charge--  I have no confidence in this court puppet--  I can effect her rescue, I alone;  Be danger, honor, and the prize my own.       [As he is going, PAULET meets him.        SCENE VII.       MORTIMER, PAULET.    PAULET.  What said the queen to you?    MORTIMER.                 'Twas nothing, sir;  Nothing of consequence----    PAULET (looking at him earnestly).               Hear, Mortimer!  It is a false and slippery ground on which  You tread. The grace of princes is alluring,  Youth loves ambition--let not yours betray you.    MORTIMER.  Was it not yourself that brought me to the court?    PAULET.  Oh, would to God I had not done as much!  The honor of our house was never reaped  In courts--stand fast, my nephew--purchase not  Too dear, nor stain your conscience with a crime.    MORTIMER.  What are these fears? What are you dreaming of?    PAULET.  How high soever the queen may pledge herself  To raise you, trust not her alluring words.  [The spirit of the world's a lying spirit,  And vice is a deceitful, treacherous friend.]  She will deny you, if you listen to her;  And, to preserve her own good name, will punish  The bloody deed, which she herself enjoined.    MORTIMER.  The bloody deed!----    PAULET.            Away, dissimulation!--  I know the deed the queen proposed to you.  She hopes that your ambitious youth will prove  More docile than my rigid age. But say,  Have you then pledged your promise, have you?    MORTIMER.  Uncle!    PAULET.      If you have done so, I abandon you,  And lay my curse upon you----    LEICESTER (entering).                 Worthy sir!  I with your nephew wish a word. The queen  Is graciously inclined to him; she wills  That to his custody the Scottish queen  Be with full powers intrusted. She relies  On his fidelity.    PAULET.           Relies!--'tis well----    LEICESTER.  What say you, sir?    PAULET.            Her majesty relies  On him; and I, my noble lord, rely  Upon myself, and my two open eyes.                     [Exit.        SCENE VIII.       LEICESTER, MORTIMER.    LEICESTER (surprised).  What ailed the knight?    MORTIMER.              My lord, I cannot tell  What angers him: the confidence, perhaps,  The queen so suddenly confers on me.    LEICESTER.  Are you deserving then of confidence?    MORTIMER.  This would I ask of you,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6798"],[0,"Aesthetical Essays of Friedrich Schiller (#9)"],[1,"when it is only able to bring about unity by  suppressing variety. The state ought not only to respect the objective  and generic, but also the subjective and specific in individuals; and  while diffusing the unseen world of morals, it must not depopulate the  kingdom of appearance, the external world of matter.    When the mechanical artist places his hand on the formless block, to give  it a form according to his intention, he has not any scruples in doing  violence to it. For the nature on which he works does not deserve any  respect in itself, and he does not value the whole for its parts, but the  parts on account of the whole. When the child of the fine arts sets his  hand to the same block, he has no scruples either in doing violence to  it, he only avoids showing this violence. He does not respect the matter  in which he works any more than the mechanical artist; but he seeks by an  apparent consideration for it to deceive the eye which takes this matter  under its protection. The political and educating artist follows a very  different course, while making man at once his material and his end. In  this case the aim or end meets in the material, and it is only because  the whole serves the parts that the parts adapt themselves to the end.  The political artist has to treat his material--man--with a very  different kind of respect than that shown by the artist of fine art to  his work. He must spare man's peculiarity and personality, not to  produce a defective effect on the senses, but objectively and out of  consideration for his inner being.    But the state is an organization which fashions itself through itself and  for itself, and for this reason it can only be realized when the parts  have been accorded to the idea of the whole. The state serves the  purpose of a representative, both to pure ideal and to objective  humanity, in the breast of its citizens, accordingly it will have to  observe the same relation to its citizens in which they are placed to it;  and it will only respect their subjective humanity in the same degree  that it is ennobled to an objective existence. If the internal man is  one with himself he will be able to rescue his peculiarity, even in the  greatest generalization of his conduct, and the state will only become  the exponent of his fine instinct, the clearer formula of his internal  legislation. But if the subjective man is in conflict with the  objective, and contradicts him in the character of a people, so that only  the oppression of the former can give victory to the latter, then the  state will take up the severe aspect of the law against the citizen, and  in order not to fall a sacrifice, it will have to crush under foot such a  hostile individuality without any compromise.    Now man can be opposed to himself in a twofold manner; either as a  savage, when his feelings rule over his principles; or as a barbarian,  when his principles destroy his feelings. The savage despises art, and  acknowledges nature as his despotic ruler; the barbarian laughs at  nature, and dishonors it, but he often proceeds in a more contemptible  way than the savage to be the slave of his senses. The cultivated man  makes of nature his friend, and honors its friendship, while only  bridling its caprice.    Consequently, when reason brings her moral unity into physical society,  she must not injure the manifold in nature. When nature strives to  maintain her manifold character in the moral structure of society, this  must not create any breach in moral unity; the victorious form is equally  remote from uniformity and confusion. Therefore, totality of character  must be found in the people which is capable and worthy to exchange the  state of necessity for that of freedom.          LETTER V.      Does the present age, do passing events, present this character? I  direct my attention at once to the most prominent object in this vast  structure.    It is true that the consideration of opinion is fallen; caprice is  unnerved, and, although still armed with power, receives no longer any  respect. Man has awakened from his long lethargy and self-deception, and  he demands with impressive unanimity to be restored to his imperishable  rights. But he does not only demand them; he rises on all sides to seize  by force what, in his opinion, has been unjustly wrested from him. The  edifice of the natural state is tottering, its foundations shake, and a  physical possibility seems at length granted to place law on the throne,  to honor man at length as an end, and to make true freedom the basis of  political union. Vain hope! The moral possibility is wanting, and the  generous occasion finds an unsusceptible rule.    Man paints himself in his actions, and what is the form depicted in the  drama of the present time? On the one hand, he is seen running wild, on  the other, in a state of lethargy; the two extremest stages of human  degeneracy, and both seen in one and the same period.    In the lower larger masses, coarse, lawless impulses come to view,  breaking loose when the bonds of civil order are burst asunder, and  hastening with unbridled fury to satisfy their savage instinct.  Objective humanity may have had cause to complain of the state; yet  subjective man must honor its institutions. Ought he to be blamed  because he lost sight of the dignity of human nature, so long as he was  concerned in preserving his existence? Can we blame him that he  proceeded to separate by the force of gravity, to fasten by the force of  cohesion, at a time when there could be no thought of building or raising  up? The extinction of the state contains its justification. Society set  free, instead of hastening upward into organic life, collapses into its  elements.    On the other hand, the civilized classes give us the still more repulsive  sight of lethargy, and of a depravity of character which is the more  revolting because it roots in culture. I forget who of the older or more  recent philosophers makes the remark, that what is more noble is the more  revolting in its destruction. The remark applies with truth to the world  of morals. The child of nature, when he breaks loose, becomes a madman;  but the art scholar, when he breaks loose, becomes a debased character.  The enlightenment of the understanding, on which the more refined classes  pride themselves with some ground, shows on the whole so little of an  ennobling influence on the mind that it seems rather to confirm  corruption by its maxims. We deny nature on her legitimate field and  feel her tyranny in the moral sphere, and while resisting her  impressions, we receive our principles from her. While the affected  decency of our manners does not even grant to nature a pardonable  influence in the initial stage, our materialistic system of morals allows  her the casting vote in the last and essential stage. Egotism has  founded its system in the very bosom of a refined society, and without  developing even a sociable character, we feel all the contagions and  miseries of society. We subject our free judgment to its despotic  opinions, our feelings to its bizarre customs, and our will to its  seductions. We only maintain our caprice against her holy rights. The  man of the world has his heart contracted by a proud self-complacency,  while that of the man of nature often beats in sympathy; and every man  seeks for nothing more than to save his wretched property from the  general destruction, as it were from some great conflagration. It is  conceived that the only way to find a shelter against the aberrations of  sentiment is by completely foregoing its indulgence, and mockery, which  is often a useful chastener of mysticism, slanders in the same breath the  noblest aspirations. Culture, far from giving us freedom, only develops,  as it advances, new necessities; the fetters of the physical close more  tightly around us, so that the fear of loss quenches even the ardent  impulse toward improvement, and the maxims of passive obedience are held  to be the highest wisdom of life. Thus the spirit of the time is seen to  waver between perversion and savagism, between what is unnatural and mere  nature, between superstition and moral unbelief, and it is often nothing  but the equilibrium of evils that sets bounds to it.          LETTER VI.      Have I gone too far in this portraiture of our times? I do not  anticipate this stricture, but rather another--that I have proved too  much by it. You will tell me that the picture I have presented resembles  the humanity of our day, but it also bodies forth all nations engaged in  the same degree of culture, because all, without exception, have fallen  off from nature by the abuse of reason, before they can return to it  through reason.    But if we bestow some serious attention to the character of our times, we  shall be astonished at the contrast between the present and the previous  form of humanity, especially that of Greece. We are justified in  claiming the reputation of culture and refinement, when contrasted with a  purely natural state of society, but not so comparing ourselves with the  Grecian nature. For the latter was combined with all the charms of art  and with all the dignity of wisdom, without, however, as with us,  becoming a victim to these influences. The Greeks have put us to shame  not only by their simplicity, which is foreign to our age; they are at  the same time our rivals, nay, frequently our models, in those very  points of superiority from which we seek comfort when regretting the  unnatural character of our manners. We see that remarkable people  uniting at once fulness of form and fulness of substance, both  philosophizing and creating, both tender and energetic, uniting a  youthful fancy to the virility of reason in a glorious humanity.    At the period of Greek culture, which was an awakening of the powers of  the mind, the senses and the spirit had no distinctly separated"]]]
