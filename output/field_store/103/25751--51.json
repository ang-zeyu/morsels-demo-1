In  due time the God of Israel made good His word, and vindicated anew His  power as King of kings; He ruled and overruled the passions of nations  and the acts of earthly rulers, and once again brought His people  from the land of their bondage. Persia had become the controlling  power among the nations, and by decree of the Persian king, Judah was  emancipated. Behold the power of God in directing the rulers among  mortals:        \"Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word      of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the      Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made      a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in      writing, saying,        \"Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The Lord God of heaven hath given      me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build      him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.        \"Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and      let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house      of the Lord God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem.        \"And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the      men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with      goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house      of God that is in Jerusalem.\"[71]    Under this gracious permission the people returned to the land of their  fathers, and set about the work of building anew a House to the Lord.  Cyrus had issued his royal decree that the structure be worthy the  great Name to which it was to be reared--the foundations were to {48}  be strongly laid; the height was to be three score cubits, and the  breadth the same; there were to be set three rows of great stones and a  row of new timber; moreover, the expenses were to be met by the royal  treasury.[72] The king restored to the people the vessels that had been  taken by Nebuchadnezzar from the first Temple,--all these, numbering  many thousands, were formally delivered by the king's treasurer.[73]    So great was the enthusiasm of the people, so strong their desire to  have individual part in the holy undertaking, that many who had been  careless of their heritage now claimed priestly standing; but, as  their genealogy had not been preserved, they were debarred from the  priesthood, though permitted to return with the rest. The prerogatives  of the priestly order were denied them until one would arise with power  to declare their genealogy through Urim and Thummim.[74]    Zerubbabel and Jeshua had charge of the work; and without delay they  builded anew the altar of the God of Israel and re-established the  ritual of sacrifice, and the observance of the sacred festivals.[75]  Masons and carpenters, workmen and artisans of all kinds and degrees  were brought into service; again were Tyre and Sidon put under friendly  tribute, and once more the wealth of the forests of Lebanon was brought  to Jerusalem. Priests and Levites were marshalled in order as of old,  and the sound of trumpets and cymbals was mingled with the voices of  the singers. Is there cause for wonder that {49} as the foundations  were laid, old men who remembered the first House and its glory wept  aloud and shouted in their tearful joy?[76]    But adversaries arose who put obstacles in the way of the builders.  The people of Canaan--Israelites who had forgotten their allegiance to  God, and had mingled with idolaters, took offense at the activity of  the returned Jews. At first they offered to assist in the work, but  being refused recognition because of their idolatrous associations,  they became obstructionists, and \"weakened the hands of the people of  Judah, and troubled them in building; and hired counsellors against  them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia,  even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.\"[77] The claim was made  that of old the people of Judah had been a trouble to other nations,  and that with the restoration of their Temple they would again become  seditious. At last the protests and charges reached Darius, the  reigning monarch; and he, having investigated the whole matter, issued  a decree, that not only should the Jews be free from interruption in  the building of the Temple, but that a portion of the king's tribute,  the regular taxes of the land, should be devoted to the work; and, said  the king:        \"Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word,      let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him      be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.      And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all      kings and people, that shall {50} put to their hand to alter and to      destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made      a decree; let it be done with speed.\"[78]    With such support the people soon completed the building. Though nearly  twenty years elapsed between the laying of the foundation and the  finishing, the greater part of the labor was done during the last four  years. The dedicatory services were solemn and inspiring. For seven  days the Feast of Unleavened Bread was observed; the Passover was eaten  by those who had returned from captivity and by such others as had  \"separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of  the land, to seek the Lord God of Israel.\"[79]    This, the second Temple, was finished in the year 515 B. C.; it is  known in history as the Temple of Zerubbabel. In general plan it was  patterned after the Temple of Solomon, though in many of its dimensions  it exceeded its prototype. The court was divided into a section for  priests only and another for the public; according to Josephus the  division was effected by a wooden railing.[80] An alter of unhewn  stone was erected in place of the great brazen alter of old.[81] The  Holy Place was graced by but one candlestick instead of ten; and by a  single table for the shew-bread instead of the ten tables overlaid with  gold which stood in the first Temple. We read also of a golden altar  of incense, and of some minor appurtenances. The Most Holy Place was  empty, for the Ark {51} of the Covenant had not been known after the  people had gone into captivity.    In many respects the Temple of Zerubbabel appeared poor in comparison  with its splendid predecessor and in certain particulars, indeed, it  ranked lower than the ancient Tabernacle of the Congregation--the  sanctuary of the nomadic tribes. Critical scholars specify the  following features characteristic of the Temple of Solomon and lacking  in the Temple of Zerubbabel: (1) the Ark of the Covenant; (2) the  sacred fire; (3) the Shekinah, or glory of the Lord, manifested of old  as the Divine Presence; (4) the Urim and Thummim, by which Jehovah made  plain His will to the priests of the Aaronic order; (5) the genius  or spirit of prophecy, indicative of the closest communion between  mortals and their God. Notwithstanding these differences the Temple of  Zerubbabel was recognized of God and was undoubtedly the site or seat  of Divine revelation to duly constituted prophets.    The inferiority of the second Temple as compared with the first is  generally conceded; the difference, however, was rather in matter of  splendor than in point of size.[82] But even such glory as it did  possess was not to be long maintained. Again the people became recreant  to their God, and the voice of the prophet was unheeded. Again did  Jehovah permit the heathen to oppress Judah. Of the later history  of this Temple the Biblical record gives but few details; but from  other sources we learn of its vicissitudes. In connection with the  Maccabean persecution the House of the Lord was profaned. A Syrian  king, Antiochus Epiphanes, captured Jerusalem (168 to 165 B. C.) {52}  and perpetrated blasphemous outrage against the religion of the people.  He plundered the Temple and carried away its golden candlestick, its  golden altar of incense, its table of shewbread, and even tore down the  sacred veils, which were of fine linen and scarlet. His malignity was  carried so far that he purposely desecrated the altar of sacrifice by  offering swine thereon, and erected a heathen altar within the sacred  enclosure. Not content with the violation of the Temple, this wicked  monarch had altars erected in the towns and ordered the offering of  unclean beasts upon them. The rite of circumcision was forbidden on  pain of death, and the worship of Jehovah was declared a crime.[83] As  a result of this persecution many of the Jews apostatized, and declared  that they belonged to the Medes and Persians--the nations from whose  dominion they had been delivered by the power of God.    Among those who remained true to the religion of their fathers was  Mattathias, who was a priest, and a man of prominence. He was besought  to offer heathen sacrifice; not only did he refuse but in righteous  indignation he slew those who did attempt the sacrilege. This act  led to further strife and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4524"],[0,"Familiar Letters on Chemistry, and Its Relation to Commerce, Physiology, and (#9)"],[1,"proportion; and, consequently, more is respired in  Sweden than in Sicily, and in our own country and eighth more in  winter than in summer. Even if an equal weight of food is consumed  in hot and cold climates, Infinite Wisdom has ordained that very  unequal proportions of carbon shall be taken in it. The food  prepared for the inhabitants of southern climes does not contain in  a fresh state more than 12 per cent. of carbon, while the blubber  and train oil which feed the inhabitants of Polar regions contain 66  to 80 per cent. of that element.    From the same cause it is comparatively easy to be temperate in warm  climates, or to bear hunger for a long time under the equator; but  cold and hunger united very soon produce exhaustion.    The oxygen of the atmosphere received into the blood in the lungs,  and circulated throughout every part of the animal body, acting upon  the elements of the food, is the source of animal heat.    [Footnote 1: This account is deduced from observations made upon the  average daily consumption of about 30 soldiers in barracks. The food  of these men, consisting of meat, bread, potatoes, lentils, peas,  beans, butter, salt, pepper, &c., was accurately weighed during a  month, and each article subjected to ultimate analysis. Of the  quantity of food, beer, and spirits, taken by the men when out of  barracks, we have a close approximation from the report of the  sergeant; and from the weight and analysis of the faeces and urine,  it appears that the carbon which passes off through these channels  may be considered equivalent to the amount taken in that portion of  the food, and of sour-crout, which was not included in the  estimate.]    [Footnote 2: 17.5 ounces = 0.5 kilogramme.]          LETTER VII      My dear Sir,    The source of animal heat, its laws, and the influence it exerts  upon the functions of the animal body, constitute a curious and  highly interesting subject, to which I would now direct your  attention.    All living creatures, whose existence depends upon the absorption of  oxygen, possess within themselves a source of heat, independent of  surrounding objects.    This general truth applies to all animals, and extends to the seed  of plants in the act of germination, to flower-buds when developing,  and fruits during their maturation.    In the animal body, heat is produced only in those parts to which  arterial blood, and with it the oxygen absorbed in respiration, is  conveyed. Hair, wool, and feathers, receive no arterial blood, and,  therefore, in them no heat is developed. The combination of a  combustible substance with oxygen is, under all circumstances, the  only source of animal heat. In whatever way carbon may combine with  oxygen, the act of combination is accompanied by the disengagement  of heat. It is indifferent whether this combination takes place  rapidly or slowly, at a high or at a low temperature: the amount of  heat liberated is a constant quantity.    The carbon of the food, being converted into carbonic acid within  the body, must give out exactly as much heat as if it had been  directly burnt in oxygen gas or in common air; the only difference  is, the production of the heat is diffused over unequal times. In  oxygen gas the combustion of carbon is rapid and the heat intense;  in atmospheric air it burns slower and for a longer time, the  temperature being lower; in the animal body the combination is still  more gradual, and the heat is lower in proportion.    It is obvious that the amount of heat liberated must increase or  diminish with the quantity of oxygen introduced in equal times by  respiration. Those animals, therefore, which respire frequently, and  consequently consume much oxygen, possess a higher temperature than  others, which, with a body of equal size to be heated, take into the  system less oxygen. The temperature of a child (102 deg) is higher  than that of an adult (99 1/2 deg). That of birds (104 deg to 105.4  deg) is higher than that of quadrupeds (98 1/2 deg to 100.4 deg) or  than that of fishes or amphibia, whose proper temperature is from  2.7 to 3.6 deg higher than that of the medium in which they live.  All animals, strictly speaking, are warm-blooded; but in those only  which possess lungs is the temperature of the body quite independent  of the surrounding medium.    The most trustworthy observations prove that in all climates, in the  temperate zones as well as at the equator or the poles, the  temperature of the body in man, and in what are commonly called  warm-blooded animals, is invariably the same; yet how different are  the circumstances under which they live!    The animal body is a heated mass, which bears the same relation to  surrounding objects as any other heated mass. It receives heat when  the surrounding objects are hotter, it loses heat when they are  colder, than itself.    We know that the rapidity of cooling increases with the difference  between the temperature of the heated body and that of the  surrounding medium; that is, the colder the surrounding medium the  shorter the time required for the cooling of the heated body.    How unequal, then, must be the loss of heat in a man at Palermo,  where the external temperature is nearly equal to that of the body,  and in the polar regions, where the external temperature is from 70  deg to 90 deg lower!    Yet, notwithstanding this extremely unequal loss of heat, experience  has shown that the blood of the inhabitant of the arctic circle has  a temperature as high as that of the native of the south, who lives  in so different a medium.    This fact, when its true significance is perceived, proves that the  heat given off to the surrounding medium is restored within the body  with great rapidity. This compensation must consequently take place  more rapidly in winter than in summer, at the pole than at the  equator.    Now, in different climates the quantity of oxygen introduced into  the system by respiration, as has been already shown, varies  according to the temperature of the external air; the quantity of  inspired oxygen increases with the loss of heat by external cooling,  and the quantity of carbon or hydrogen necessary to combine with  this oxygen must be increased in the same ratio.    It is evident that the supply of the heat lost by cooling is  effected by the mutual action of the elements of the food and the  inspired oxygen, which combine together. To make use of a familiar,  but not on that account a less just illustration, the animal body  acts, in this respect, as a furnace, which we supply with fuel. It  signifies nothing what intermediate forms food may assume, what  changes it may undergo in the body; the last change is uniformly the  conversion of its carbon into carbonic acid, and of its hydrogen  into water. The unassimilated nitrogen of the food, along with the  unburned or unoxidised carbon, is expelled in the urine or in the  solid excrements. In order to keep up in the furnace a constant  temperature, we must vary the supply of fuel according to the  external temperature, that is, according to the supply of oxygen.    In the animal body the food is the fuel; with a proper supply of  oxygen we obtain the heat given out during its oxidation or  combustion. In winter, when we take exercise in a cold atmosphere,  and when consequently the amount of inspired oxygen increases, the  necessity for food containing carbon and hydrogen increases in the  same ratio; and by gratifying the appetite thus excited, we obtain  the most efficient protection against the most piercing cold. A  starving man is soon frozen to death. The animals of prey in the  arctic regions, as every one knows, far exceed in voracity those of  the torrid zone.    In cold and temperate climates, the air, which incessantly strives  to consume the body, urges man to laborious efforts in order to  furnish the means of resistance to its action, while, in hot  climates, the necessity of labour to provide food is far less  urgent.    Our clothing is merely an equivalent for a certain amount of food.  The more warmly we are clothed the less urgent becomes the appetite  for food, because the loss of heat by cooling, and consequently the  amount of heat to be supplied by the food, is diminished.    If we were to go naked, like certain savage tribes, or if in hunting  or fishing we were exposed to the same degree of cold as the  Samoyedes, we should be able with ease to consume 10 lbs. of flesh,  and perhaps a dozen of tallow candles into the bargain, daily, as  warmly clad travellers have related with astonishment of these  people. We should then also be able to take the same quantity of  brandy or train oil without bad effects, because the carbon and  hydrogen of these substances would only suffice to keep up the  equilibrium between the external temperature and that of our bodies.    According to the preceding expositions, the quantity of food is  regulated by the number of respirations, by the temperature of the  air, and by the amount of heat given off to the surrounding medium.    No isolated fact, apparently opposed to this statement, can affect  the truth of this natural law. Without temporary or permanent injury  to health, the Neapolitan cannot take more carbon and hydrogen in  the shape of food than he expires as carbonic acid and water; and  the Esquimaux cannot expire more carbon and hydrogen than he takes  in the system as food, unless in a state of disease or of  starvation. Let us examine these states a little more closely.    The Englishman in Jamaica perceives with regret the disappearance of  his appetite, previously a source of frequently recurring enjoyment;  and he succeeds, by the use of cayenne pepper, and the most powerful  stimulants, in enabling himself to take as much food as he was  accustomed to eat at home. But the whole of the carbon thus  introduced into the system is not consumed; the temperature of the  air is too high, and the"]]]
