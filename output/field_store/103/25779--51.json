In this connection special emphasis  is usually laid-- and with justice--upon the prophetical activity  of Isaiah, whose confidence in the firm foundation of Zion  continued unmoved, even when the rock began to shake in an alarming  way.  Only it must not be forgotten that the significance of  Jerusalem to Isaiah did not arise from the temple of Solomon, but  from the fact that it was the city of David and the focus of his  kingdom, the central point, not of the cultus, but of the  sovereignty of Jehovah over His people.  The holy mount was to  him the entire city as a political unity, with its citizens,  councillors, and judges (xi.9); his faith in the sure foundation  on which Zion rested was nothing more than a faith in the living  presence of Jehovah in the camp of Israel.  But the contemporaries  of the prophet interpreted otherwise his words and the events which  had occurred.  In their view Jehovah dwelt on Zion because His  house was there; it was the temple that had been shown by history  to be His true seat, and its inviolability was accordingly the  pledge of the indestructibility of the nation.  This belief was  quite general in Jeremiah's time, as is seen in the extremely  vivid picture of the seventh chapter of his book; but even as  early as the time of Micah, in the first third of the seventh  century, the temple must have been reckoned a house of God of an  altogether peculiar order, so as to make it a paradox to put it on  a level with the Bamoth of Judah, and a thing unheard of to believe  in its destruction.    At the same time, notwithstanding the high and universal reverence  in which the temple was held, the other sanctuaries still  continued, in the first instance, to subsist alongside of it.  King Hezekiah indeed is said to have even then made an attempt  to abolish them, but the attempt, having passed away without leaving  any trace, is of a doubtful nature.  It is certain that the  prophet Isaiah did not labour for the removal of the Bamoth.  In  one of his latest discourses his anticipation for that time of  righteousness and the fear of God which is to dawn after the  Assyrian crisis is: \"Then shall ye defile the silver covering of  your graven images and the golden plating of your molten images--ye  shall cast them away as a thing polluted; Begone! shall ye say  unto them\" (xxx.22).  If he thus hopes for a purification from  superstitious accretions of the places where Jehovah is worshipped,  it is clear that he is not thinking of their total abolition.  Not  until about a century after the destruction of Samaria did men  venture to draw the practical conclusion from the belief in the  unique character of the temple at Jerusalem.  That this was not  done from a mere desire to be logical, but with a view to further  reforms, need not be said.  With the tone of repudiation in which  the earlier prophets, in the zeal of their opposition, had  occasionally spoken of practices of worship at large, there was  nothing to be achieved; the thing to be aimed at was not  abolition, but reformation, and the end it was believed would be  helped by concentration of all ritual in the capital.  Prophets  and priests appear to have made common cause in the prosecution of  the work.  It was the high priest Hilkiah who in the first instance  called attention to the discovered book which was to be made the  basis of action; the prophetess Huldah confirmed its divine  contents; the priests and prophets were a prominent element in the  assembly at which the new law was promulgated and sworn to.  Now  an intimate fellowship between these two leading classes appears to  be characteristic of the whole course of the religious movement in  Judah, and to have been necessarily connected with the lines on  which that movement advanced; /1/    ******************************  1. While Hosea, the man of northern Israel, frequently assails  the clergy of his home, and lays upon them the chief share of the  blame for the depraved and blinded condition of the people, Isaiah  even in his fiercest declamation against the superstitious worship  of the multitude, has not a word to say against the priests, with  whose chief, Uriah, on the contrary, he stands in a relation of  great intimacy.  But it is from the Book of Jeremiah, the best  mirror of the contemporary relations in Judah, that the close  connection between priests and prophets can be gathered most  particularly.  To a certain extent they shared the possession of  the sanctuary between them.  (Compare Lam. ii.20.)  ***************************************    we shall be justified therefore in assuming that the display  of harmony between them on this occasion was not got up merely  for the purposes of scenic effect, but that the change  in the national cultus now proposed was really the common suggestion  of prophets and priests.  In point of fact, such a change was equally  in accordance with the interests of the temple and with those  of the prophetic party of reform.  To the last named the restriction  of the sacrificial worship must have in itself seemed an advantage;  to it in later times the complete abolition of sacrifice was mainly due,  and something of the later effect doubtless lay in the original  intention.  Then, too, the Jehovah of Hebron was only too easily  regarded as distinct from the Jehovah of Bethshemesh or of Bethel,  and so a strictly monarchical conception of God naturally led to  the conclusion that the place of His dwelling and of His worship  could also only be one.  All writers of the Chaldaean period  associate monotheism in the closest way with unity of worship  (Jer. ii.28, xi.13).  And the choice of the locality could  present no difficulty; the central point of the kingdom had of  necessity also to become the central point of the worship.  Even  Jerusalem and the house of Jehovah there might need some cleansing,  but it was clearly entitled to a preference over the obscure  local altars.  It was the seat of all higher culture, Iying under  the prophets' eyes, much more readily accessible to light and  air, reform and control.  It is also possible, moreover, that the  Canaanite origin of most of the Bamoth, which is not unknown, for  example, to Deuteronomy, may have helped to discredit them, while,  on the other hand, the founding of Jerusalem belonged to the  proudest memories of Israelite history, and the Ark, which had been  the origin of the temple there, had a certain right to be  considered the one genuine Mosaic sanctuary. /1/    ************************************  1. Luther in his address to the princes of Germany counsels  in the twentieth place that the field chapels and churches be destroyed,  as devices of the devil used by him to strengthen covetousness,  to set up a false and spurious faith, to weaken parochial churches,  to increase taverns and fornication, to squander money and labour  to no purpose, and merely to lead the poor people about by the nose.  (Niemeyer's Reprint, p. 54 )  *************************************    In the eighteenth year of Josiah, 601 B.C., the first heavy blow fell  upon the local sacrificial places.  How vigorously the king set to  work, how new were the measures taken, and how deeply they cut,  can be learned from the narrative of 2Kings xxiii.  Yet what a  vitality did the green trees upon the high mountains still  continue to show!  Even now they were but polled, not uprooted.  After Josiah's death we again see Bamoth appearing on all hands,  not merely in the country, but even in the capital itself.  Jeremiah has to lament that there are as many altars as towns in  Judah.  All that had been attained by the reforming party was  that they could now appeal to a written law that had been solemnly  sworn to by the whole people, standing ever an immovable witness  to the rights of God.  But to bring it again into force and to  carry it out was no easy matter, and would certainly have been  impossible to the unaided efforts of the prophets--a Jeremiah or an  Ezekiel.    I.3  Had the people of Judah remained in peaceful possession of their  land, the reformation of Josiah would hardly have penetrated to  the masses; the threads uniting the present with the past were too  strong.  To induce the people to regard as idolatrous and heretical  centres of iniquity the Bamoth, with which from ancestral times  the holiest memories were associated, and some of which, like  Hebron and Beersheba, had been set up by Abraham and Isaac in  person, required a complete breaking-off of the natural tradition  of life, a total severance of all connection with inherited  conditions.  This was accomplished by means of the Babylonian  exile, which violently tore the nation away from its native soil,  and kept it apart for half a century,--a breach of historical  continuity than which it is almost impossible to conceive a  greater.  The new generation had no natural, but only an  artificial relation to the times of old; the firmly rooted  growths of the old soil, regarded as thorns by the pious, were  extirpated, and the freshly ploughed fallows ready for a new  sowing.  It is, of course, far from being the case that the whole  people at that time underwent a general conversion in the sense of  the prophets.  Perhaps the majority totally gave up the past, but  just on that account became lost among the heathen, and never  subsequently came into notice.  Only the pious ones, who with  trembling followed Jehovah's word, were left as a remnant; they  alone had the strength to maintain the Jewish individuality amid  the medley of nationalities into which they had been thrown.  From the exile there returned, not the nation, but a religious  sect,--those, namely, who had given themselves up body and soul"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47333"],[0,"Christmas Stories from French and Spanish Writers (#9)"],[1,"than birds, which one could swallow at a mouthful,  gilt-heads no bigger than almonds, a rich supply of hemp-seed, a pâté  of bird-seed à la Canaria, bread-crumb à la perdigona, a fricassée  of pheasants' eyes with a sauce of wild mulberries, a salad of moss,  delicious sweetmeats, and every possible variety of fruit, harvested  by the parrots from the tapestries where they were embroidered, the  melons being as small as grapes and the grapes as small as lentils.  During the supper the company chattered ceaselessly,--all but  Migajas, who, being short of wit, sat there and said never a word.  He was confused in the presence of so many gold-corded and uniformed  generals. He was amazed, too, at finding so much loquacity and  frolicsomeness in these great men, who had stood stiff and dumb in  the show-window as though they were made of clay.    The one known as Bismarck, in particular, never stopped to draw  breath. He said the wildest things imaginable, pounded the table with  his fist, and threw bread balls at the princess. He flung his arms  about most marvellously, just as though a string were attached to  their hinges, and somebody under the table had hold of it.    \"What fun I am having!\" said the chancellor. \"My dear princess, when  a man spends his life adorning a mantel-piece in the cheerful company  of a clock, a bronze figure, and a pot of begonias, he really needs  recreation; and at a festival like this he lays in a supply of mirth  for the year.\"    \"Ah, happy, a thousand times happy, they whose only duty consists  in adorning mantelpieces!\" said the lady, in melancholy tones. \"It  may be wearisome, but you do not at least suffer as we do,--we whose  lives are a prolonged martyrdom; we, the toys of the small men. It  would be impossible for me to make you understand, Prince Bismarck,  what we suffer when one pulls our right arm, another our left; when  this one cracks our head, that one quarters us or leaves us in the  water to soak, or rips us open to find out what is inside of us!\"    \"I can imagine it,\" said the chancellor, opening his arms and  clapping them together several times.    \"How unfortunate!\" said Espartero and two of the emperors at once.    \"I was the least unfortunate of all,\" said the lady, \"for I found  a friend and protector in the valorous and faithful Migajas, who  managed to save me from the barbarous torture.\"    Pacorrito blushed to the very roots of his hair.    \"Valorous and faithful!\" repeated all the dolls, in admiring chorus.    \"And therefore to-night, when our Genius Creator permits us to come  together for this great celebration, I chose to honor him by bringing  him with me and offering him my hand as a sign of alliance and  reconciliation between the lineage of dolls and that of well-bred,  compassionate children.\"      X.    At this Prince Bismarck looked at Pacorrito with an expression of  such malignity and sarcasm that our illustrious hero was filled with  wrath. At the same instant this wretch of a chancellor aimed a bread  ball at Migajas, and fired it so accurately that the bridegroom came  near being blinded for life. But Migajas was a prototype of prudence  and circumspection, so he controlled his feelings and was silent. The  princess threw him a glance of love and gratitude.    \"What fun I am having!\" repeated the chancellor, clapping his wooden  hands together. \"Before it is time to resume our place beside  the clock and listen to its unceasing tic-tac, let us fathom the  depths of pleasure and intoxication,--let us be happy! If the Señor  Pacorrito would favor us by calling the daily paper, we might laugh a  little.\"    \"The Señor de Migajas,\" said the princess, kindly, \"did not come here  to make us laugh. But there is no reason why we should not enjoy  hearing him call out the paper or even matches if he is willing to do  so.\"    The ragamuffin could find no words with which to answer his beloved.  He was sorely incensed at the proposition, which he judged to be a  fling at his dignity and decorum.    \"Let him dance!\" shouted the chancellor, impertinently; \"let him  dance on the table! and if he refuse to do so, I move that he be  stripped of the fine clothes we dressed him in, and be left ragged  and barefooted as he was when he came.\"    Migajas felt all his blood rush to his heart. He was blind with rage.  \"Do not be cruel, my dear prince,\" said the princess, smiling; \"leave  him to me. I will take it upon myself to dispel the storm that is  rising within our good Migajas here.\"    A loud peal of laughter greeted this reply, and all the dolls,  and the most celebrated generals and emperors of the world,  simultaneously fell to pounding one another's heads like the Punch  and Judy puppets.    \"Make him dance! make him call matches!\" they clamored.    Migajas felt faint. The sentiment of dignity was so powerfully  developed in him that he would have died rather than have gone  through the suggested degradation. He was just about to reply  when the malignant chancellor, pulling a long thin straw from a  work-basket and wetting the end of it in his mouth, drove it into  Pacorrito's ear with such a quick movement that the latter did not  realize the familiarity of the act until he had suffered the nervous  shock produced by tricks of this sort.    Blind with rage, he put his hand to his belt and drew the  paper-cutter. The ladies shrieked and the princess fainted; but  the enraged Migajas, far from being pacified by this, seemed to be  growing more and more infuriated, and rushing upon his insolent  adversary, he began to deal blows right and left. The air was filled  with yells, threats, and imprecations. The parrots croaked and the  very birds moved their paper tails in sign of panic.    Nobody laughed now at the daring Migajas. A few moments later the  chancellor might have been seen going about gathering up his arms and  legs (a strange case which cannot be explained), and all the emperors  were noseless. They gradually, however, with a little glue and a  great deal of innate skill, mended one another,--a rare advantage,  this, of puppet surgery. The princess, having recovered from her  swoon through the virtue of smelling-salts, administered by her pages  in a filbert-shell, called the ragamuffin aside, and leading him to  her private apartments, spoke as follows:--      XI.    \"Most illustrious Migajas, what you have just done, far from  lessening my love for you, has only increased it, for you have given  evidence of indomitable valor by your easy triumph over this swarm  of scoffing puppets, the most despicable class of beings on earth.  The tender sentiments that bind me to you move me to propose that you  become my husband with no further delay.\"    Pacorrito fell on his knees.    \"As soon as we are married, the emperors and chancellors will all  venerate you as they do me, for I must tell you that I am queen of  this division of the world. My titles are not usurped; they are  transmitted by the divine law of puppets established by the Supreme  Genius that created us and governs us.\"    \"My lady,\" Migajas said, or tried to say, \"my happiness is so great  that I cannot express it.\"    \"Very well, then,\" said the lady, with great majesty, \"since you are  willing to become my husband, and consequently prince and lord of  this puppet kingdom, I must inform you that in order to do so you  will have to renounce your human personality.\"    \"I do not exactly grasp your Majesty's meaning,\" said the ragamuffin.    \"You belong to the human race. I do not. Our natures being different,  we cannot unite. There is but one way. Give up your humanity. It is  the easiest thing in the world, believe me. It is only necessary that  you will it. Now, answer me. Pacorrito, son of man, will you be a  puppet?\"    The peculiar nature of this request set the ragamuffin to thinking  for a few seconds.    \"And what does this thing of being a puppet consist in?\"    \"You will be like me. Our nature is perhaps nearer perfection than  yours. We are to all appearances devoid of life, but we live,  believe me. To the imperfect senses of man we lack movement, words,  affection, but this is far from being the case. You have had an  opportunity of judging how we move, how we speak, and how we feel.  Our fate, for the present at least, is not a very happy one. We are  the toys of your children, and even your men, but as a compensation  for this disadvantage we are eternal.\"    \"Eternal!\"    \"Yes; we live forever. When these wicked children of yours break us,  we rise with a new life out of our destruction, and are born anew,  describing a mysterious and everlasting circle from the shop to the  children, from them to the Tyrolese factory, and thence to the shop  again through the ages everlasting.\"    \"Through the ages everlasting!\" repeated Migajas, absorbed.    \"It is not always rose-color with us; but, on the other hand, you  see, we do not know death, and then our Genius Creator permits us to  meet at certain great festivals to celebrate the glory of our race,  as we have done to-night. We cannot elude the laws of our being,--it  is not given us to enter the reign of humanity, although men can  easily enter ours, and in fact have very often been known to become  puppets.\"    \"A most extraordinary thing!\" exclaimed Pacorrito, full of amazement.    \"You know the requirements of puppet initiation. I have nothing more  to say. Our dogmas are very simple. Now, meditate upon it, and answer  my question, Will you be a doll?\"    The princess's attitude was that of a priestess of antiquity.  Pacorrito was captivated.    \"I want to be a doll,\" declared the ragamuffin, resolutely.    The princess then proceeded to trace diabolical characters in the  air, and to utter great words which Pacorrito had never heard before,  and which were neither Latin, Chinese, nor Chaldean. He concluded  that they were Tyrolese. When this was consummated, the lady threw  her arms about Migajas,"]]]
