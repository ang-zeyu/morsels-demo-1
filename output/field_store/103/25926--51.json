The people in the left faction were not only fewer in  number than the right but probably were no more important than them,  although their behaviour was calmer and that made it seem like they  were.  When K. now began to speak he was convinced he was doing it in  the same way as them.            \"Your question, My Lord, as to whether I am a house painter - in  fact even more than that, you did not ask at all but merely imposed it  on me - is symptomatic of the whole way these proceedings against me are  being carried out.   Perhaps you will object that there are no  proceedings against me.  You will be quite right, as there are  proceedings only if I acknowledge that there are.  But, for the moment,  I do acknowledge it, out of pity for yourselves to a large extent.  It's  impossible not to observe all this business without feeling pity.  I  don't say things are being done without due care but I would like to  make it clear that it is I who make the acknowledgement.\"    K. stopped speaking and looked down into the hall.  He had spoken  sharply, more sharply than he had intended, but he had been quite right.  It should have been rewarded with some applause here and there but  everything was quiet, they were all clearly waiting for what would  follow, perhaps the quietness was laying the ground for an outbreak of  activity that would bring this whole affair to an end.  It was somewhat  disturbing that just then the door at the end of the hall opened, the  young washerwoman, who seemed to have finished her work, came in and,  despite all her caution, attracted the attention of some of the people  there.  It was only the judge who gave K. any direct pleasure, as he  seemed to have been immediately struck by K.'s words.  Until then, he  had listened to him standing, as K.'s speech had taken him by surprise  while he was directing his attention to the gallery.  Now, in the pause,  he sat down very slowly, as if he did not want anyone to notice.  He  took out the notebook again, probably so that he could give the  impression of being calmer.            \"That won't help you, sir,\" continued K., \"even your little book  will only confirm what I say.\"  K. was satisfied to hear nothing but his  own quiet words in this room full of strangers, and he even dared  casually to pick up the examining judge's notebook and, touching it only  with the tips of his fingers as if it were something revolting, lifted  it in the air, holding it just by one of the middle pages so that the  others on each side of it, closely written, blotted and yellowing,  flapped down.  \"Those are the official notes of the examining judge,\" he  said, and let the notebook fall down onto the desk.  \"You can read in  your book as much as you like, sir, I really don't have anything in this  charge book to be afraid of, even though I don't have access to it as I  wouldn't want it in my hand, I can only touch it with two fingers.\"  The  judge grabbed the notebook from where it had fallen on the desk - which  could only have been a sign of his deep humiliation, or at least that is  how it must have been perceived - tried to tidy it up a little, and held  it once more in front of himself in order to read from it.            The people in the front row looked up at him, showing such tension  on their faces that he looked back down at them for some time.  Every  one of them was an old man, some of them with white beards.  Could they  perhaps be the crucial group who could turn the whole assembly one way  or the other?  They had sunk into a state of  motionlessness while K.  gave his oration, and it had not been possible to raise them from this  passivity even when the judge was being humiliated.  \"What has happened  to me,\" continued K., with less of the vigour he had had earlier, he  continually scanned the faces in the first row, and this gave his  address a somewhat nervous and distracted character, \"what has happened  to me is not just an isolated case.  If it were it would not be of much  importance as it's not of much importance to me, but it is a symptom of  proceedings which are carried out against many.  It's on behalf of them  that I stand here now, not for myself alone.\"            Without having intended it, he had raised his voice.  Somewhere in  the hall, someone raised his hands and applauded him shouting, \"Bravo!  Why not then?  Bravo!  Again I say, Bravo!\"  Some of the men in the  first row groped around in their beards, none of them looked round to  see who was shouting.  Not even K. thought him of any importance but it  did raise his spirits; he no longer thought it at all necessary that all  of those in the hall should applaud him, it was enough if the majority  of them began  to think about the matter and if only one of them, now  and then, was persuaded.            \"I'm not trying to be a successful orator,\" said K. after this  thought, \"that's probably more than I'm capable of anyway.  I'm sure the  examining judge can speak far better than I can, it is part of his job  after all.  All that I want is a public discussion of a public wrong.  Listen: ten days ago I was placed under arrest, the arrest itself is  something I laugh about but that's beside the point.  They came for me  in the morning when I was still in bed.  Maybe the order had been given  to arrest some house painter - that seems possible after what the judge  has said - someone who is as innocent as I am, but it was me they chose.  There were two police thugs occupying the next room.  They could not  have taken better precautions if I had been a dangerous robber.  And  these policemen were unprincipled riff-raff, they talked at me till I  was sick of it, they wanted bribes, they wanted to trick me into giving  them my clothes, they wanted money, supposedly so that they could bring  me my breakfast after they had blatantly eaten my own breakfast in front  of my eyes.  And even that was not enough.  I was led in front of the  supervisor in another room.  This was the room of a lady who I have a  lot of respect for, and I was forced to look on while the supervisor and  the policemen made quite a mess of this room because of me, although not  through any fault of mine.  It was not easy to stay calm, but I managed  to do so and was completely calm when I asked the supervisor why it was  that I was under arrest.  If he were here he would have to confirm what  I say.  I can see him now, sitting on the chair belonging to that lady I  mentioned - a picture of dull-witted arrogance.  What do you think he  answered?  What he told me, gentlemen, was basically nothing at all;  perhaps he really did know nothing, he had placed me under arrest and  was satisfied.  In fact he had done more than that and brought three  junior employees from the bank where I work into the lady's room; they  had made themselves busy interfering with some photographs that belonged  to the lady and causing a mess.  There was, of course, another reason  for bringing these employees; they, just like my landlady and her maid,  were expected to spread the news of my arrest and damage my public  reputation and in particular to remove me from my position at the bank.  Well they didn't succeed in any of that, not in the slightest, even my  landlady, who is quite a simple person - and I will give you here her  name in full respect, her name is Mrs. Grubach - even Mrs. Grubach was  understanding enough to see that an arrest like this has no more  significance than an attack carried out on the street by some youths who  are not kept under proper control.  I repeat, this whole affair has  caused me nothing but unpleasantness and temporary irritation, but could  it not also have had some far worse consequences?\"            K. broke off here and looked at the judge, who said nothing.  As  he did so he thought he saw the judge use a movement of his eyes to give  a sign to someone in the crowd.  K. smiled and said, \"And now the judge,  right next to me, is giving a secret sign to someone among you.  There  seems to be someone among you who is taking directions from above.  I  don't know whether the sign is meant to produce booing or applause, but  I'll resist trying to guess what its meaning is too soon.  It really  doesn't matter to me, and I give his lordship the judge my full and  public permission to stop giving secret signs to his paid subordinate  down there and give his orders in words instead; let him just say \"Boo  now!,\" and then the next time \"Clap now!\".            Whether it was embarrassment or impatience, the judge rocked  backwards and forwards on his seat.  The man behind him, whom he had  been talking with earlier, leant forward again, either to give him a few  general words of encouragement or some specific piece of advice.  Below  them in the hall the people talked to each other quietly but animatedly.  The two factions  had earlier seemed to hold views strongly opposed to  each other but now they began to intermingle, a few individuals pointed  up at K., others pointed at the judge.   The air in the room was fuggy  and extremely oppressive, those who were standing furthest away could  hardly even be seen through it.  It must have been especially  troublesome for those visitors who were in the gallery, as they were  forced to quietly ask the participants in the assembly what exactly was  happening, albeit with timid glances at the judge.  The replies they  received were just as quiet, and given behind the protection of a raised  hand.            \"I have nearly finished what I have to say,\" said K., and as there  was no bell available he struck the desk with his fist in a way that  startled the judge and his advisor and made them look up from each  other.  \"None of this concerns me, and I am"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7853"],[0,"Quentin Durward (#9)"],[1," loaves called boules  (whence the bakers took their French name of boulangers), of which the  crust was so inviting, that, even with water alone, it would have been a  delicacy. But the water was not alone, for there was a flask of leather  called bottrine, which contained about a quart of exquisite Vin de  Beaulne. So many good things might have created appetite under the ribs  of death. What effect, then, must they have produced upon a youngster of  scarce twenty, who (for the truth must be told) had eaten little for the  two last days, save the scarcely ripe fruit which chance afforded him an  opportunity of plucking, and a very moderate portion of barley bread?  He threw himself upon the ragout, and the plate was presently vacant--he  attacked the mighty pasty, marched deep into the bowels of the land, and  seasoning his enormous meal with an occasional cup of wine, returned to  the charge again and again, to the astonishment of mine host, and the  amusement of Maitre Pierre.    The latter indeed, probably because he found himself the author of a  kinder action than he had thought of, seemed delighted with the appetite  of the young Scot; and when, at length, he observed that his exertions  began to languish, endeavoured to stimulate him to new efforts by  ordering confections, darioles [cream cakes], and any other light  dainties he could think of, to entice the youth to continue his meal.  While thus engaged, Maitre Pierre's countenance expressed a kind of good  humour almost amounting to benevolence, which appeared remote from its  ordinary sharp, caustic, and severe character. The aged almost always  sympathize with the enjoyments of youth and with its exertions of every  kind, when the mind of the spectator rests on its natural poise and is  not disturbed by inward envy or idle emulation.    Quentin Durward also, while thus agreeably employed, could do no  otherwise than discover that the countenance of his entertainer, which  he had at first found so unprepossessing, mended when it was seen under  the influence of the Vin de Beaulne, and there was kindness in the tone  with which he reproached Maitre Pierre, that he amused himself with  laughing at his appetite, without eating anything himself.    \"I am doing penance,\" said Maitre Pierre, \"and may not eat anything  before noon, save some comfiture and a cup of water.--Bid yonder lady,\"  he added, turning to the innkeeper, \"bring them hither to me.\"    The innkeeper left the room, and Maitre Pierre proceeded, \"Well, have I  kept faith with you concerning the breakfast I promised you?\"    \"The best meal I have eaten,\" said the youth, \"since I left Glen  Houlakin.\"    \"Glen--what?\" demanded Maitre Pierre. \"Are you going to raise the devil,  that you use such long tailed words?\"    \"Glen Houlakin,\" answered Quentin good humouredly, \"which is to say the  Glen of the Midges, is the name of our ancient patrimony, my good sir.  You have bought the right to laugh at the sound, if you please.\"    \"I have not the least intention to offend,\" said the old man; \"but I  was about to say, since you like your present meal so well, that the  Scottish Archers of the guard eat as good a one, or a better, every  day.\"    \"No wonder,\" said Durward; \"for if they be shut up in the swallows'  nests all night, they must needs have a curious appetite in the  morning.\"    \"And plenty to gratify it upon,\" said Maitre Pierre. \"They need not,  like the Burgundians, choose a bare back, that they may have a full  belly--they dress like counts, and feast like abbots.\"    \"It is well for them,\" said Durward.    \"And wherefore will you not take service here, young man? Your uncle  might, I dare say, have you placed on the file when there should  a vacancy occur. And, hark in your ear, I myself have some little  interest, and might be of some use to you. You can ride, I presume, as  well as draw the bow?\"    \"Our race are as good horsemen as ever put a plated shoe into a steel  stirrup; and I know not but I might accept of your kind offer. Yet, look  you, food and raiment are needful things, but, in my case, men think of  honour, and advancement, and brave deeds of arms. Your King Louis--God  bless him, for he is a friend and ally of Scotland--but he lies here in  this castle, or only rides about from one fortified town to another;  and gains cities and provinces by politic embassies, and not in fair  fighting. Now, for me, I am of the Douglases' mind, who always kept the  fields, because they loved better to hear the lark sing than the mouse  squeak.\"    \"Young man,\" said Maitre Pierre, \"do not judge too rashly of the actions  of sovereigns. Louis seeks to spare the blood of his subjects, and cares  not for his own. He showed himself a man of courage at Montl'hery.\"    \"Ay, but that was some dozen years ago or more,\" answered the youth--\"I  should like to follow a master that would keep his honour as bright  as his shield, and always venture foremost in the very throng of the  battle.\"    \"Why did you not tarry at Brussels, then, with the Duke of Burgundy?  He would put you in the way to have your bones broken every day; and,  rather than fail, would do the job for you himself--especially if he  heard that you had beaten his forester.\"    \"Very true,\" said Quentin; \"my unhappy chance has shut that door against  me.\"    \"Nay, there are plenty of daredevils abroad, with whom mad youngsters  may find service,\" said his adviser. \"What think you, for example, of  William de la Marck?\"    \"What!\" exclaimed Durward, \"serve Him with the Beard--serve the Wild  Boar of Ardennes--a captain of pillagers and murderers, who would take  a man's life for the value of his gaberdine, and who slays priests and  pilgrims as if they were so many lance knights and men at arms? It would  be a blot on my father's scutcheon for ever.\"    \"Well, my young hot blood,\" replied Maitre Pierre, \"if you hold the  Sanglier [Wild Boar] too unscrupulous, wherefore not follow the young  Duke of Gueldres?\"    [Adolphus, son of Arnold and of Catherine de Bourbon.... He made war  against his father; in which unnatural strife he made the old man  prisoner, and used him with the most brutal violence, proceeding, it  is said, even to the length of striking him with his hand. Arnold, in  resentment of this usage, disinherited the unprincipled wretch, and sold  to Charles of Burgundy whatever rights he had over the duchy of Gueldres  and earldom of Zutphen.... S.]    \"Follow the foul fiend as soon,\" said Quentin. \"Hark in your ear--he is  a burden too heavy for earth to carry--hell gapes for him! Men say that  he keeps his own father imprisoned, and that he has even struck him--can  you believe it?\"    Maitre Pierre seemed somewhat disconcerted with the naive horror with  which the young Scotsman spoke of filial ingratitude, and he answered,  \"You know not, young man, how short a while the relations of blood  subsist amongst those of elevated rank;\" then changed the tone of  feeling in which he had begun to speak, and added, gaily, \"besides, if  the Duke has beaten his father, I warrant you his father hath beaten him  of old, so it is but a clearing of scores.\"    \"I marvel to hear you speak thus,\" said the Scot, colouring with  indignation; \"gray hairs such as yours ought to have fitter subjects for  jesting. If the old Duke did beat his son in childhood, he beat him not  enough; for better he had died under the rod, than have lived to make  the Christian world ashamed that such a monster had ever been baptized.\"    \"At this rate,\" said Maitre Pierre, \"as you weigh the characters of each  prince and leader, I think you had better become a captain yourself; for  where will one so wise find a chieftain fit to command him?\"    \"You laugh at me, Maitre Pierre,\" said the youth, good humouredly, \"and  perhaps you are right; but you have not named a man who is a gallant  leader, and keeps a brave party up here, under whom a man might seek  service well enough.\"    \"I cannot guess whom you mean.\"    \"Why, he that hangs like Mahomet's coffin [there is a tradition that  Mahomet's coffin is suspended in mid air Without any support, the most  generally accepted explanation being that the coffin is of iron and is  placed between two magnets] (a curse be upon Mahomet!) between the two  loadstones--he that no man can call either French or Burgundian, but who  knows to hold the balance between them both, and makes both of them fear  and serve him, for as great princes as they be.\"    \"I cannot guess whom you mean,\" said Maitre Pierre, thoughtfully.    \"Why, whom should I mean but the noble Louis de Luxembourg, Count of  Saint Paul, the High Constable of France? Yonder he makes his place good  with his gallant little army, holding his head as high as either King  Louis or Duke Charles, and balancing between them like the boy who  stands on the midst of a plank, while two others are swinging on the  opposite ends.\"    [This part of Louis XI's reign was much embarrassed by the intrigues  of the Constable Saint Paul, who affected independence, and carried on  intrigues with England, France, and Burgundy at the same time. According  to the usual fate of such variable politicians, the Constable ended by  drawing upon himself the animosity of all the powerful neighbours whom  he had in their turn amused and deceived. He was delivered up by the  Duke of Burgundy to the King of France, tried, and hastily executed for  treason, A. D. 1475. S.]    \"He is in danger of the worst fall of the three,\" said Maitre Pierre.  \"And hark ye, my young friend, you who hold pillaging such a crime, do  you know that your politic Count of Saint Paul was the first who set the  example of burning the country during the time of war? and that before  the shameful devastation which he committed, open towns and villages,  which made no resistance, were spared on all sides?\"    \"Nay, faith,\" said Durward, \"if that be the case, I shall begin to think  no one of these great"]]]
