On rolls of birch  bark or the skins of animals they wrote messages, hunting stories, and  songs, and even preserved tribal annals extending over a century.    SOUND WRITING; THE REBUS    A new stage in the development of writing was reached when the picture  represented, not an actual object or an idea, but a sound of the human  voice. This difficult but all-important step appears to have been taken  through the use of the rebus, that is, writing words by pictures of  objects which stand for sounds. Such rebuses are found in prehistoric  Egyptian writing; for example, the Egyptian words for \"sun\" and \"goose\"  were so nearly alike that the royal title, \"Son of the Sun,\" could be  suggested by grouping the pictures of the sun and a goose. Rebus making is  still a common game among children, but to primitive men it must have been  a serious occupation.    [Illustration: MEXICAN REBUS  The Latin _Pater Noster,_ \"Our Father,\" is written by a flag _(pan)_, a  stone _(te)_, a prickly pear _(noch)_, and another stone _(te)_.]    [Illustration: CHINESE PICTURE WRITING AND LATER CONVENTIONAL CHARACTERS]    WORDS AND SYLLABLES    In the simplest form of sound writing each separate picture or symbol  stands for the sound of an entire word. This method was employed by the  Chinese, who have never given it up. A more developed form of sound  writing occurs when signs are used for the sounds, not of entire words,  but of separate syllables. Since the number of different syllables which  the voice can utter is limited, it now becomes possible to write all the  words of a language with a few hundred signs. The Japanese, who borrowed  some of the Chinese symbols, used them to denote syllables, instead of  entire words. The Babylonians possessed, in their cuneiform [9]  characters, signs for about five hundred syllables. The prehistoric  inhabitants of Crete appear to have been acquainted with a somewhat  similar system. [10]    LETTERS    The final step in the development of writing is taken when the separate  sounds of the voice are analyzed and each is represented by a single sign  or letter. With alphabets of a few score letters every word in a language  may easily be written.    [Illustration: CRETAN WRITING  A large tablet with linear script found in the palace at Gnossus, Crete  There are eight lines of writing, with a total of about twenty words  Notice the upright lines, which appear to mark the termination of each  group of signs.]    EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHICS    The Egyptians early developed such an alphabet. Unfortunately they never  gave up their older methods of writing and learned to rely upon alphabetic  signs alone. Egyptian hieroglyphics [11] are a curious jumble of object-  pictures, symbols of ideas, and signs for entire words, separate  syllables, and letters. The writing is a museum of all the steps in the  development from the picture to the letter.    PHOENICIAN ALPHABET    As early, apparently, as the tenth century B.C. we find the Phoenicians of  western Asia in possession of an alphabet. It consisted of twenty-two  letters, each representing a consonant. The Phoenicians do not seem to  have invented their alphabetic signs. It is generally believed that they  borrowed them from the Egyptians, but recent discoveries in Crete perhaps  point to that island as the source of the Phoenician alphabet.    [Illustration: EGYPTIAN AND BABYLONIAN WRITING  Below the pictured hieroglyphics in the first line is the same text in a  simpler writing known as hieratic. The two systems, however, were not  distinct; they were as identical as our own printed and written  characters. The third line illustrates old Babylonian cuneiform, in which  the characters, like the hieroglyphics, are rude and broken-down pictures  of objects. Derived from them is the later cuneiform shown in lines four  and five.]    DIFFUSION OF THE PHOENICIAN ALPHABET    If they did not originate the alphabet now in use, the Phoenicians did  most to spread a knowledge of it in other lands. They were bold sailors  and traders who bought and sold throughout the Mediterranean. Wherever  they went, they took their alphabet. From the Phoenicians the Greeks  learned their letters. Then the Greeks taught them to the Romans, from  whom other European peoples borrowed them.

The inscription, consisting of 34 lines is one of the most  ancient examples of Phoenician writing.]      5. PRIMITIVE SCIENCE AND ART    FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE    We have already seen that prehistoric men in their struggle for existence  had gathered an extensive fund of information. They could make useful and  artistic implements of stone. They could work many metals into a variety  of tools and weapons. They were practical botanists, able to distinguish  different plants and to cultivate them for food. They were close students  of animal life and expert hunters and fishers. They knew how to produce  fire and preserve it, how to cook, how to fashion pottery and baskets, how  to spin and weave, how to build boats and houses. After writing came into  general use, all this knowledge served as the foundation of science.    COUNTING AND MEASURING    We can still distinguish some of the first steps in scientific knowledge.  Thus, counting began with calculations on one's fingers, a method still  familiar to children. Finger counting explains the origin of the decimal  system. The simplest, and probably the earliest, measures of length are  those based on various parts of the body. Some of our Indian tribes, for  instance, employed the double arm's length, the single arm's length, the  hand width, and the finger width. Old English standards, such as the span,  the ell, and the hand, go back to this very obvious method of measuring on  the body.    CALCULATION OF TIME; THE CALENDAR    It is interesting to trace the beginnings of time reckoning and of that  most important institution, the calendar. Most primitive tribes reckon  time by the lunar month, the interval between two new moons (about twenty-  nine days, twelve hours). Twelve lunar months give us the lunar year of  about three hundred and fifty-four days. In order to adapt such a year to  the different seasons, the practice arose of inserting a thirteenth month  from time to time. Such awkward calendars were used in antiquity by the  Babylonians, Jews, and Greeks; in modern times by the Arabs and Chinese.  The Egyptians were the only people in the Old World to frame a solar year.  From the Egyptians it has come down, through the Romans, to us.

The outer circle  measures 300 feet in circumference; the inner circle, 106 feet. The  tallest stones reach 25 feet in height. This monument was probably a tomb,  or group of tombs, of prehistoric chieftains.]    EARLY DRAWING AND PAINTING    The study of prehistoric art takes us back to the early Stone Age. The men  of that age in western Europe lived among animals such as the mammoth,  cave bear, and woolly-haired rhinoceros, which have since disappeared, and  among many others, such as the lion and hippopotamus, which now exist only  in warmer climates. Armed with clubs, flint axes, and horn daggers,  primitive hunters killed these fierce beasts and on fragments of their  bones, or on cavern walls, drew pictures of them. Some of these earliest  works of art are remarkably lifelike.    [Illustration: HEAD OF A GIRL (Mus√©e S. Germain, Paris)  A small head of a young girl carved from mammoth ivory. Found at  Brassempouy, France, in cave deposits belonging to the early Stone Age.  The hair is arranged somewhat after the early Egyptian fashion.

Men had begun to raise huge dolmens which are found in  various parts of the Old World from England to India. They also erected  enormous stone pillars, known as menhirs. Carved in the semblance of a  human face and figure, the menhir became a statue, perhaps the first ever  made.    As we approach historic times, we note a steady improvement in the various  forms of art. Recent discoveries in Egypt, Greece, Italy, and other lands  indicate that their early inhabitants were able architects, often building  on a colossal scale.    [Illustration: A DOLMEN  Department of Morbihan, Brittany. A dolmen was a single chambered tomb  formed by laying one long stone over several other stones set upright in  the ground. Most if not all dolmens were originally covered with earth.]    [Illustration: CARVED MENHIR  From Saint Sernin in Aveyron, a department of southern France.]    SIGNIFICANCE OF PREHISTORIC ART    Their paintings and sculptures prepared the way for the work of later  artists. Our survey of the origins of art shows us that in this field, as  elsewhere, we must start with the things accomplished by prehistoric men.      6. HISTORIC PEOPLES    RACES OF MAN    At the dawn of history the various regions of the world were already in  the possession of many different peoples. Such physical characteristics as  the shape of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7965"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#9)"],[1,"ods, he made  preparations for the great sacrifice called the Rajasuya. And all the  kings of the earth brought at his command wealth unto that sacrifice.  All of them consented to become distributors of food and gifts unto the  Brahmanas that were fed on the occasion. At that sacrifice king  Harishchandra gave away unto all who asked, wealth that was five times  what each had solicited. At the conclusion of the sacrifice, the king  gratified the Brahmanas that came from various countries with large  presents of various kinds of wealth. The Brahmanas gratified with  various kinds of food and enjoyable articles, given away unto them to  the extent of their desires, and with the heaps of jewels distributed  amongst them, began to say,--\"King Harischandra is superior to all  kings in energy and renown.\"--And know, O monarch, O bull of the  Bharata race, it was for this reason that Harischandra shone more  brightly than thousands of other kings. The powerful Harischandra  having concluded his great sacrifice, became installed, O king, in the  sovereignty of the earth and looked resplendent on his throne. O bull  of the Bharata race, all those monarchs that perform the sacrifice of  Rajasuya, (attaining to the region of Indra) pass their time in  felicity in Indra's company. And, O bull of the Bharata race, those  kings also that yield up their lives without turning their backs on the  field of battle attain to the mansion of Indra and live in joy with  him. Those again that yield up their bodies after severe ascetic  penances also attain to the same region and shine brightly there for  ages. O king of the Kuru race, O son of Kunti, thy father Pandu,  beholding the good fortune of Harischandra and wondering much thereat,  hath told thee something. Knowing that I was coming to the world of  men, he bowed unto me and said,--\"Thou shouldst tell Yudhishthira, O  Rishi, that he can subjugate the whole Earth inasmuch as his brothers  are all obedient to him. And having done this let him commence the  grand sacrifice called Rajasuya. He is my son; if he performeth that  sacrifice, I may, like Harischandra, soon attain to the region of  Indra, and there in his Sabha pass countless years in continuous joy.\"  I told him in reply,--\"O King, I shall tell thy son all this, if I go  to the world of man.\" I have now told thee what he said, O tiger among  men. Accomplish then, O son of Pandu, the desires of thy father. If  thou performest that sacrifice, thou shall then be able to go, along  with thy deceased ancestors, into the same region that is inhabited by  the chief of the immortals. It hath been said,--O king, that the  performance of this great sacrifice is attended with many obstacles. A  class of Rakshasas called Brahma Rakshasas, employed in obstructing all  sacrifices, always search for loop-holes when this great sacrifice is  commenced. On the commencement of such a sacrifice a war may take place  destroying the Kshatriyas and even furnishing occasion for the  destruction of the whole Earth. A slight obstacle may involve the whole  Earth in ruin. Reflecting upon all this, O king of kings do what is for  thy good. Be thou watchful and ready in protecting the four orders of  thy subjects. Grow, thou in prosperity, and enjoy thou felicity.  Gratify thou the Brahmanas with gifts of wealth. I have now answered in  detail all that thou hast asked me. With thy leave I will now go to the  city (Dwaravati) of that Dasarhas.'\"    Vaisampayana said,--\"O Janamejaya, having said this unto the son of  Pritha, Narada went away, accompanied by those Rishis with whom he had  come. And after Narada had gone away, king Yudhishthira, O thou of the  Kuru race, began to think, along with his brothers, of that foremost of  sacrifices called Rajasuya.\"      SECTION XIII    Vaisampayana said,--\"Yudhishthira, having heard these words of Narada,  began to sigh heavily. And, O Bharata, engaged in his thoughts about  the Rajasuya, the king had no peace of mind. Having heard of this glory  of the illustrious monarchs (of old) and being certain about the  acquisition of regions of felicity by performers of sacrifices in  consequence of their sacred deeds, and thinking especially of that  royal sage Harischandra who had performed the great sacrifice king  Yudhishthira desired to make preparations for the Rajasuya sacrifice.  Then worshipping his counsellors and others present at his Sabha, and  worshipped by them in return, he began to discuss with them about that  sacrifice. Having reflected much, that king of kings, that bull amongst  the Kurus, inclined his mind towards making preparations for the  Rajasuya. That prince of wonderful energy and prowess, however,  reflecting upon virtue and righteousness, again set his heart to find  out what would be for the good of all his people. For Yudhishthira,  that foremost of all virtuous men, always kind unto his subjects,  worked for the good of all without making any distinctions. Indeed,  shaking off both anger and arrogance, Yudhishthira always said,--'Give  unto each what is due to each,'--and the only sounds that he could hear  were,--'Blessed be Dharma! Blessed be Dharma!' Yudhishthira conducting  himself thus and giving paternal assurance to everybody, there was none  in the kingdom who entertained any hostile feelings towards him. He  therefore came to be called Ajatasatru (one with no enemy at all). The  king cherished every one as belonging to his family, and Bhima ruled  over all justly. Arjuna, used to employing both his hands with equal  skill, protected the people from (external) enemies. And the wise  Sahadeva administered justice impartially. And Nakula behaved towards  all with humility that was natural to him. Owing to all this, the  kingdom became free from disputes and fear of every kind. And all the  people became attentive to their respective occupations. The rain  became so abundant as to leave no room for desiring more; and the  kingdom grew in prosperity. And in consequence of the virtues of the  king, money-lenders, the articles required for sacrifices,  cattle-rearing, tillage, and traders, all and everything grew in  prosperity. Indeed, during the reign of Yudhishthira who was ever  devoted to truth, there was no extortion, no stringent realisation of  arrears of rent, no fear of disease, of fire, or of death by poisoning  and incantations, in the kingdom. It was never heard at that time that  thieves or cheats or royal favourites ever behaved wrongfully towards  the king or towards one another amongst themselves. Kings conquered on  the six occasions (of war, treaty, &c) were wont to wait upon him in  order to do good unto the monarch and worship him ever, while the  traders of different classes came to pay him the taxes leviable on  their respective occupations. And accordingly during the reign of  Yudhishthira who was ever devoted to virtue, his dominion grew in  prosperity. Indeed, the prosperity of the kingdom was increased not by  these alone but even by persons wedded to voluptuousness and indulging  in all luxuries to their fill. And the king of kings, Yudhishthira,  whose sway extended over all, was possessed of every accomplishment and  bore everything with patience. And, O king, whatever countries the  celebrated and illustrious monarch conquered, the people everywhere,  from Brahmanas to swains, were all more attached to him than to their  own fathers and mothers.\"    Vaisampayana said,--\"King Yudhishthira, then, that foremost of  speakers, summoning together his counsellors and brothers, asked them  repeatedly about the Rajasuya sacrifice. Those ministers in a body,  thus asked by the wise Yudhishthira desirous of performing the  sacrifice, then told him these words of grave import,--'One already in  possession of a kingdom desireth all the attributes of an emperor by  means of that sacrifice which aideth a king in acquiring the attributes  of Varuna. O prince of Kuru race, thy friends think that as thou art  worthy of the attributes of an emperor, the time is even come for thee  for the performance of the Rajasuya sacrifice. The time for the  performance of that sacrifice in which Rishis of austere vows kindle  six fires with mantras of the Sama Veda, is come for thee in  consequence of thy Kshatriya possessions. At the conclusion of the  Rajasuya sacrifice when the performer is installed in the sovereignty  of the empire, he is rewarded with the fruits of all sacrifices  including the Agnihotra. It is for this that he is called the conqueror  of all. Thou art quite able, O strong-armed one, to perform this  sacrifice. All of us are obedient to thee. Soon will you be able, O  great king, to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice. Therefore, O great king,  let thy resolution be taken to perform this sacrifice without further  discussion.' Thus spoke unto the king all his friends and counsellors  separately and jointly. And, O king, Yudhishthira that slayer of all  enemies, having heard these virtuous, bold, agreeable and weighty words  of theirs, accepted them mentally. And having heard those words of his  friends and counsellors, and knowing his own strength also, the king, O  Bharata, repeatedly thought over the matter. After this the intelligent  and virtuous Yudhishthira, wise in counsel, again consulted with his  brothers, with the illustrious Ritwijas about him, with his ministers  and with Dhaumya and Dwaipayana and others.\"    \"Yudhishthira said,--'How may this wish that I entertain of performing  the excellent sacrifice of Rajasuya that is worthy of an emperor, bear  fruit, in consequence of my faith and speech alone.'\"    Vaisampayana said,--\"O thou of eyes like lotus-petals, thus asked by  the king, they replied at that time unto Yudhishthira the just in these  words,--'Being conversant with the dictates of morality, thou art, O  king, worthy to perform the grand sacrifice of Rajasuya.' After the  Ritwijas and the Rishis had told these words unto the king,"]]]
