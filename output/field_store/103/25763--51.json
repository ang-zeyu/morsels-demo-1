He does not, as others do,      deny the meaning of Christ's teaching, but unfortunately he      does not draw from this admission the inevitable deductions      which present themselves spontaneously in our life when we      understand Christ's teaching in that way.  If we must not      oppose evil by force, nor swear, everyone naturally asks,      \"How, then, about military service? and the oath of      obedience?\"  To this question the author gives no reply; but      it must be answered.  And if he cannot answer, then he would      do better no to speak on the subject at all, as such silence      leads to error.]    The majority of religious critics of my book use this fifth method  of replying to it. I could quote dozens of such critics, in all of  whom, without exception, we find the same thing repeated:  everything is discussed except what constitutes the principal  subject of the book.  As a characteristic example of such  criticisms, I will quote the article of a well-known and ingenious  English writer and preacher--Farrar--who, like many learned  theologians, is a great master of the art of circuitously evading  a question.  The article was published in an American journal, the  FORUM, in October, 1888.    After conscientiously explaining in brief the contents of my book,  Farrar says:       \"Tolstoy came to the conclusion that a coarse deceit had been     palmed upon the world when these words 'Resist not evil,' were     held by civil society to be compatible with war, courts of     justice, capital punishment, divorce, oaths, national     prejudice, and, indeed, with most of the institutions of civil     and social life.  He now believes that the kingdom of God would     come if all men kept these five commandments of Christ, viz.:     1. Live in peace with all men.  2. Be pure.  3. Take no oaths.     4. Resist not evil.  5. Renounce national distinctions.       \"Tolstoy,\" he says, \"rejects the inspiration of the Old     Testament; hence he rejects the chief doctrines of the Church--that     of the Atonement by blood, the Trinity, the descent of the     Holy Ghost on the Apostles, and his transmission through the     priesthood.\"  And he recognizes only the words and commands of     Christ.  \"But is this interpretation of Christ a true one?\" he     says.  \"Are all men bound to act as Tolstoy teaches--i. e., to     carry out these five commandments of Christ?\"    You expect, then, that in answer to this essential question, which  is the only one that could induce a man to write an article about  the book, he will say either that this interpretation of Christ's  teaching is true and we ought to follow it, or he will say that  such an interpretation is untrue, will show why, and will give  some other correct interpretation of those words which I interpret  incorrectly.  But nothing of this kind is done.  Farrar only  expresses his \"belief\" that,       \"although actuated by the noblest sincerity, Count Tolstoy has     been misled by partial and one-sided interpretations of the     meaning of the Gospel and the mind and will of Christ.\"  What     this error consists in is not made clear; it is only said:     \"To enter into the proof of this is impossible in this article,     for I have already exceeded the space at my command.\"    And he concludes in a tranquil spirit:       \"Meanwhile, the reader who feels troubled lest it should be his     duty also to forsake all the conditions of his life and to take     up the position and work of a common laborer, may rest for the     present on the principle, SECURUS JUDICAT ORBIS TERRARUM.  With     few and rare exceptions,\" he continues, \"the whole of     Christendom, from the days of the Apostles down to our own, has     come to the firm conclusion that it was the object of Christ to     lay down great eternal principles, but not to disturb the bases     and revolutionize the institutions of all human society, which     themselves rest on divine sanctions as well as on inevitable     conditions.  Were it my object to prove how untenable is the     doctrine of communism, based by Count Tolstoy upon the divine     paradoxes [sic], which can be interpreted only on historical     principles in accordance with the whole method of the teaching     of Jesus, it would require an ampler canvas than I have here at     my disposal.\"    What a pity he has not an \"ampler canvas at his disposal\"! And what a  strange thing it is that for all these last fifteen centuries no one has  had a \"canvas ample enough\" to prove that Christ, whom we profess to  believe in, says something utterly unlike what he does say! Still, they  could prove it if they wanted to. But it is not worth while to prove  what everyone knows; it is enough to say \"SECURUS JUDICAT ORBIS  TERRARUM.\"    And of this kind, without exception, are all the criticisms of educated  believers, who must, as such, understand the danger of their position.  The sole escape from it for them lies in their hope that they may be  able, by using the authority of the Church, of antiquity, and of their  sacred office, to overawe the reader and draw him away from the idea of  reading the Gospel for himself and thinking out the question in his own  mind for himself. And in this they are successful; for, indeed, how  could the notion occur to any one that all that has been repeated from  century to century with such earnestness and solemnity by all those  archdeacons, bishops, archbishops, holy synods, and popes, is all of it  a base lie and a calumny foisted upon Christ by them for the sake of  keeping safe the money they must have to live luxuriously on the necks  of other men? And it is a lie and a calumny so transparent that the only  way of keeping it up consists in overawing people by their earnestness,  their conscientiousness. It is just what has taken place of late years  at recruiting sessions; at a table before the zertzal--the symbol of the  Tzars authority--in the seat of honor under the life-size portrait of  the Tzar, sit dignified old officials, wearing decorations, conversing  freely and easily, writing notes, summoning men before them, and giving  orders. Here, wearing a cross on his breast, near them, is  prosperous-looking old Priest in a silken cassock, with long gray hair  flowing on to his cope; before a lectern who wears the golden cross and  has a Gospel bound in gold.    They summon Iran Petroff.  A young man comes in, wretchedly,  shabbily dressed, and in terror, the muscles of his face working,  his eyes bright and restless; and in a broken voice, hardly above  a whisper, he says: \"I--by Christ's law--as a Christian--I  cannot.\"  \"What is he muttering?\" asks the president, frowning  impatiently and raising his eyes from his book to listen. \"Speak  louder,\" the colonel with shining epaulets shouts to him. \"I--I as  a Christian--\"  And at last it appears that the young man refuses  to serve in the army because he is a Christian.  \"Don't talk  nonsense.  Stand to be measured.  Doctor, may I trouble you to  measure him.  He is all right?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Reverend father,  administer the oath to him.\"    No one is the least disturbed by what the poor scared young man is  muttering. They do not even pay attention to it.  \"They all mutter  something, but we've no time to listen to it, we have to enroll so  many.\"    The recruit tries to say something still.  \"It's opposed to the  law of Christ.\"  \"Go along, go along; we know without your help  what is opposed to the law and what's not; and you soothe his  mind, reverend father, soothe him.  Next: Vassily Nikitin.\"  And  they lead the trembling youth away. And it does not strike anyone  --the guards, or Vassily Nikitin, whom they are bringing in, or  any of the spectators of this scene--that these inarticulate words  of the young man, at once suppressed by the authorities, contain  the truth, and that the loud, solemnly uttered sentences of the  calm, self-confident official and the priest are a lie and a  deception.    Such is the impression produced not only by Farrar's article, but  by all those solemn sermons, articles, and books which make their  appearance from all sides directly there is anywhere a glimpse of  truth exposing a predominant falsehood.  At once begins the series  of long, clever, ingenious, and solemn speeches and writings,  which deal with questions nearly related to the subject, but  skillfully avoid touching the subject itself.    That is the essence of the fifth and most effective means of  getting out of the contradictions in which Church Christianity has  placed itself, by professing its faith in Christ's teaching in  words, while it denies it in its life, and teaches  people to do the same.    Those who justify themselves by the first method, directly,  crudely asserting that Christ sanctioned violence, wars, and  murder, repudiate Christ's doctrine directly; those who find their  defense in the second, the third, or the fourth method are  confused and can easily be convicted of error; but this last  class, who do not argue, who do not condescend to argue about it,  but take shelter behind their own grandeur, and make a show of all  this having been decided by them or at least by someone long ago,  and no longer offering a possibility of doubt to anyone--they seem  safe from attack, and will be beyond attack till men come to  realize that they are under the narcotic influence exerted on them  by governments and churches, and are no longer affected by it.    Such was the attitude of the spiritual critics--i. e., those  professing faith in Christ--to my book.  And their attitude could  not have been different.  They are bound to take up this attitude  by the contradictory position in which they find themselves  between belief in the divinity of their Master and disbelief in  his clearest"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46092"],[0,"A Little Pilgrimage in Italy (#9)"],[1,"any rate, as a house of prayer. What is it,  I wonder, that makes it easy for the Protestant to worship in  Gothic or Romanesque churches, and to respond to the appeal of  basilicas like Santa Maria Maggiore or San Clemente in Rome, while  sixteenth-century churches still remain the ideal ecclesiastical  building to the majority of Roman Catholics? Is it that they all  bear the image of St. Peter's and the Vatican in their minds? They  argue that at least under the spacious cupolas of the renaissance  they have light and space. And it is logic, for Gothic cathedrals  are dim and full of shadows. But I could say my prayers more easily  in the baths of Caracalla, where the sun slanting over the broken  walls has a trick of making mist like floods of incense, and the  birds chant all day long, than in St. Peter's, for all its fragrant  services. And I doubt if any Catholics could be moved to such an  ecstasy of worship in the dusk of Milan Cathedral, when the organ  throbs through the aisles at Vespers, as we have seen them in many  of the late pilgrimage churches of Italy, like Santa Maria of Todi  or the great basilica of the Casa Santa at Loreto.    [Illustration: TODI: S. MARIA DELLA CONSOLAZIONE.]    Like all the hill-cities of Umbria, one of Todi's chief charms  is the beauty of her views. Below my bedroom window in the Hotel  Risorgimento the old brown roofs of Todi clambered so eagerly down  the slope that each one was at least two stories below the one  above. Here and there were little gardens full of tamarisks and  oleanders and morning glories. To the left rose San Fortunato, high  on its broken flight of steps, like a grim fortress; and below it  was the bastion of the public garden, with its round acacia trees  which were always vibrant with the song of cicalas. In the deep  valley were grey-towered farms with loggias and outside stairways,  and a great fortified convent with the stations of the Cross  climbing up to its gates in a cypress avenue. Through the midst the  Tiber wound very slowly like a ribbon, and now the sunlight caught  it, and we could see the blue water, and now we could only trace  it by its tall Lombard poplars. But always it turned towards the  distant hills which rose the one behind the other, fold on fold,  and full of changing lights, towards Rome. At night it was still  and mysterious. The steep hillside was wrapped in darkness. There  was no moon, and though the sky was powdered thickly with stars  they gave no light to see the valley by. Far below I could hear  the humming of the night crickets; they sounded sleepy too. And up  above, San Fortunato loomed almost transparently in the heavens,  and the Milky Way shone like a mist of stars.    We found Arcady again down in the valleys as we drove back to  Perugia across the Umbrian plain. There had been a fair at some  neighbouring village, and the road was full of peasants coming back  with corteges of white oxen and calves, which had bells on their  throats, and collars of scarlet and brass, and crimson fillets.    Perugia lay before us all the way, with her towers and majestic  walls and the slim campanile of San Pietro, which looks like an  obelisk from the plain. As we drove along the straight white road  we saw the cities of the Valley of Spoleto rising like stars upon  their hills. At each turn fresh mountains were disclosed with fresh  cities on their skirts, pink in the evening sun. We were tired  after the heat of the day, and silent. The harness-bells and the  clipping sound of hoofs made an agreeable accompaniment to our  thoughts. We climbed up slowly through the sunset, looking now at  the hills, now at the olive-gardens that stretched away from the  road, their leaves as silver as a flight of butterflies in the  sunlight; now idly watching the long-legged shadows of the horses  on the flowery bank. And all the way the cicalas were singing by  the roadside, and we bore the memory of fragrant sunlit hours  in our hearts. Half unconsciously, and like a message from the  eternal hills, St. Paul's words came into my mind: 'Whatsoever  thing is good, whatsoever thing is pure, whatsoever thing is  lovely, whatsoever thing is of good report, if there be any virtue  or if there be any truth, think on these things.' They were like  an answer to the riddle which all men ask of Fate. But indeed in  this Umbrian garden they are the text of everyday life, for in its  byways it is easy to catch the spirit of St. Francis as he passed,  barefoot and meanly clad, singing the praise of God and all His  creatures.    As we drove up the last steep incline the plain was filled with  light. Overhead the clouds were growing rosy. Assisi was a city of  gold. And to the horizon rolled the Umbrian hills, purple and blue,  and very far away like jade, airy and transparent, in the luminous  space which Perugino loved to paint.          SIENA AND THE PALIO      It was the poet who persuaded us to go to Siena to see the Palio  run in honour of Our Lady of Mid-August. We were still in Perugia  enjoying the languid Umbrian summer, when he announced his  intention of leaving the next day for Siena.    'What _is_ the Palio?' asked the philosopher. 'August will be very  hot in Siena, and nothing could be more beautiful than this'--he  waved his hand towards the white walls of Assisi, and the great  dome of Santa Maria degli Angeli, floating like a lotus bud above  the morning mists, which filled the valley between Perugia and  Monte Subasio.    'It is so difficult to define,' said the poet. 'When you say, \"What  is the Palio?\" you give me the wherewithal to write a book. If I  told you that it was a race in honour of the Virgin Mary, ridden  bareback round the chief piazza of Siena, by jockeys in mediaeval  costume, who try to club each other off the course, you would  probably prefer to stay here in Perugia. If I told you that it was  a pageant you would be sure to say that you have seen better at  Olympia.'    He was silent for a moment.    'But it is more than that. Imagine a city of Gothic palaces,  a little flushed hill-city, sleeping among vineyards and  olive-gardens, sleeping and sleeping like a girl bewitched. And  then imagine the soul of her awaking for a few hours--a day  perhaps--in the summer of the year. That is Siena, dear gay Siena,  with her indomitable spirit and her fickle careless heart, with  her pageants and her saints, and her allegiance to Madonna. For  first and foremost Siena is the city of the Virgin Mary. There  they think of her not only as the Mother of God, but as their own  liege sovereign; even the Standard of the City, the black and white  Balzana, is emblematic \"of the purity and humility of the Virgin,  or of those joyful and sorrowful mysteries whereby, as she told St.  Bridget, her life was ever divided between happiness and grief.\"    'As for the Palio, if you would appreciate it you must understand  something of the religion of the Middle Ages, which was at its best  an inspiration, capable of producing St. Francis and St. Catherine,  and at its worst a creed of superstitions which found vent in  wild orgies of penance, and countenanced the crusade against the  Albigenses. You must have thrilled to stories of wild games, like  the Florentine Giuoco del Calcio or Perugia's Battaglia de' Sassi,  in which the players lost their limbs and not infrequently their  lives. And lastly, you must appreciate the intense patriotism  which the men of Siena feel for their _contrade_, or divisions  of the city, which I can best describe as parishes; though it is  difficult to say whether, in the first place, the boundaries were  parochial or military.    'It is not merely a pageant, though as a pageant it is superlative;  it is the last flicker of the spirit of the Middle Ages. And for  my part I love it, because the Sienese are still so mediaeval  at heart. And that is why there is no city in Italy more fitted  to be illumined by the torch of the Middle Ages than Siena. For  Siena, notwithstanding the fact that she bred some of the greatest  Renaissance popes, was comparatively untouched by the wave of  paganism which swept over Italy in the sixteenth and seventeenth  centuries. She still has whole streets of Gothic palaces; her  saints are still reverenced with the almost child-like simplicity  of the Middle Ages; she still boasts the special protection of  the Blessed Virgin; and in the midst of all her fervour she still  nurses her old feuds, not only with her ancient enemies, the  Florentines, but between her own _contrade_.'           *       *       *       *       *    It was dark and the heavens were full of stars when we bade  good-bye to our kind host of the Perugian inn, and boarded the  electric tram that was to take us down to the station. We had  chosen an early train so as to avoid travelling in the heat of the  day, but we found the car already full of thrifty Italians bent on  making hay before the sun shone.    [Illustration: SIENA: BANNER-HOLDER.]    We left at dawn, in the clear pale light which floods the Umbrian  plain when the world is yet a little grey, and Perugia is nothing  but a lovely outline on the crest of her hill. This is the light  that Perugino loved, the shadowless herald of the day, full of  the mystery of the morning. The world woke slowly from her pale  slumber in the arms of night; the sky deepened from beryl to gold.  We found Thrasymene illumined with rosy morning fires, her hills  empurpled, and the towers of her little cities aflame with sunrise.  It seemed as though immortal memories, great desires, and burnt-out  passions struggled for utterance there. How Hannibal's tired eyes  must have ached to possess so fair a land! Yet it is likely that he  never saw the passionate dawn wooing the lake with plumes of rose  and gold, as we did; for we know that on the fateful day when he  waited to give battle to Flaminius by the shore of Thrasymene, the  mists which did him such"]]]
