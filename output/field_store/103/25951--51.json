[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8467"],[0,"Frost's Laws and By-Laws of American Society (#9)"],[1," are compatible with the requirements of polite  conversation.    To listen with interest and attention is as important in polite  society as to converse well, and it is in the character of  listener that the elegant refinement of a man accustomed to  society will soonest prove itself. No matters how \"flat, stale and  unprofitable,\" the remarks of another may be, the well-bred man  will listen with an appearance at least of interest, replying in  such a manner as to show that he entirely \"follows the thread of  the discourse.\"    Avoid as much as possible all egotism; in conversation stick  closely to Cardinal Wolsey's direction to \"love thyself last.\" It  is, to say the least of it, unseemly for a man to be constantly  making himself the subject of conversation. At times it lays a man  open to the attacks which his style certainly invites--as was the  case with the egotist who dared to talk much of himself in the  presence of Dr. Johnson, whom he had greatly irritated by his  conceited talk. The Doctor availed himself of an opportunity to  crush him.    \"Oh, indeed, I did not know that!\" exclaimed the man, upon some  intelligent remark made by one of the company, whereupon the  Doctor broke in with: \"Sir, what you do not know would fill a very  large library.\"    There used to be a joke against Lord, Erskine, who was notably a  talker of himself, that the printer, having to print a speech  which his lordship had delivered, sent word to say that \"he was  very sorry, but he had no more 'I's' in his founts than would  suffice to set up half the speech.\"    The subject of conversation and the method of handling it should  be so ordered as not to offend either directly or indirectly.    Suitable subjects, for time and place, form an important  consideration in polite conversation. Grave tones and important  consideration are not suited for the chit-chat of a brief call or  a social evening, nor is small talk an appropriate introduction,  when the meetings are for the purpose of discussing serious  matters. Let gayety or gravity rule as place and occasion demand.    Gesticulations are in excessively bad taste. If you do not wish to  attract censorious remark, converse quietly and without gesture.  Declamation is not conversation.    Refrain from the use of satire, even if you are master of the art.  It is permissible only as a guard against impertinence, or for the  purpose of checking personalities, or troublesome intrusions.  Under no circumstances whatever should it be used merely for  amusement's sake, to produce an effect, or in order to show off  one's own wit. It must never be employed by a gentleman against a  lady, though ladies are prone to indulge in the use of this wordy  weapon. Their acknowledged position should, in the eyes of a true  gentleman, shield them from all shafts of satire. If they, on the  other hand, choose to indulge in satire, it is the part of a  gentleman to remonstrate gently, and if the invective be  continued, to withdraw. There was a case in point during the  Austro-Prussian war. The Grand Duchess of ---, being visited by a  Prussian General on business, took occasion to pour forth upon him  the unmeasured violence of her temper, which had naturally enough  been disturbed by the success that had attended the Prussian arms,  and had been at the same time so injurious to her husband's  interests. The Prussian General remonstrated, at first mildly; the  invective still flowed, when the General said he would not have  believed that a Prussian officer could have been called upon to  endure such abuse from the lips of a high-born lady. Still the  Grand Duchess continuing to ignore the object of the General's  visit, and continuing also to pour forth the bitterness of her  spirit upon him, the soldier withdrew, not returning railing for  railing, but simply declaring that the language used towards him  was absolutely intolerable.    Do not attempt to speak with the mouth full.    Do not, however much you may be pleased with any remark, cry out  \"Bravo!\" clap your hands, or permit any gesture, silent or  otherwise, to mark your appreciation of it. A quiet expression of  pleasure, or the smiling lip will show quite as plainly your sense  of the wit, or fitness of the remark.    If you are flattered, repel it by quiet gravity. You cannot accept  it without also accepting the contempt of the person who offers  it. Refrain, too, from expressions of flattery to others; you will  surely offend any hearer who has delicacy of feeling and  refinement.    If an error in language, either in pronunciation or grammar,  escapes those with whom you are conversing, never show that you  notice it. To take occasion to repeat correctly the same word or  phrase, is ill-bred in the extreme, and as much so to correct it  when spoken.    In addressing any one and in general conversation, it will be well  to bear in mind the advice of Polonius to his son Laertes: \"Be  thou familiar, but by no means vulgar;\" but unless you have  special reason, do not too closely adhere to his precept, \"Give  every man thine ear, but not thy tongue.\" This will only serve to  make you appear reserved and reticent, when to be so would be not  only out of place, but ill-bred. In society, a man should make  himself as agreeable as he can, doing his best to assist  conversation, as well by talking gracefully and easily, as by  listening patiently, even though it be to a twice-told tale.    Do not whistle, loll about, scratch your head, or fidget with any  portion of your dress while speaking. 'Tis excessively awkward,  and indicative of low-breeding.    Strictly avoid anything approaching to absence of mind. There can  be nothing more offensive than a pre-occupied vacant expression,  an evident abstraction of self at the very time you are supposed  to be listening attentively to all that is being said to you. Lord  Chesterfield said: \"When I see a man absent in mind. I choose to  be absent in body.\" And there was really much reason in the  remark.    Whispering is atrocious, and cannot be tolerated. It is almost as  bad to endeavor to draw one person from a general conversation  into a _tete-a-tete_ discussion. Private affairs must be delayed  for private interviews.    If, however, you find others have been guilty of this breach of  etiquette, and you are so placed as to overhear what is intended  to be a secret communication, you may with perfect propriety  change your seat, or if this is not practicable, inform the  persons so conversing, that their voices are audible to you.    Unless you are actually afflicted with deafness, never ask to have  a sentence repeated. It implies a wandering attention. If your  hearing is defective, say so, and your companion will raise his  voice.    Never interrupt a speaker. It is equally rude to supply words over  which your companion may hesitate a moment. Do not be guilty of a  rough comment on what has been said, by such remarks as, \"Yes, you  mean so-and-so.\" If you understand such to be the meaning of a  remark, act or answer accordingly; if you are uncertain, try to  find out in some way that will not wound the feelings of the  speaker.    In general conversation avoid argument. It is too engrossing of  attention, and is moreover apt to break in upon the harmony of the  company. If obliged to discuss a point, do so with suavity,  contradicting, if necessary, with extreme courtesy, and if you see  no prospect of agreement, finishing off with some happy good-  natured remark to prove that you are not hurt or offended.    When addressing a person, look in his or her face, not staringly,  but frankly, never fixing your eyes on the carpet or your boots.    Speak clearly and distinctly, never mumbling your words, and while  avoiding a shouting tone, speak loudly enough to ensure your  remarks being heard. A very low tone of voice will be heard if the  words are clearly articulated and spoken slowly enough for perfect  distinctness, and is much more agreeable than hurried, garbled  speech loudly uttered.    Do not sit too close to your companion in conversation, and avoid  any appearance of wishing secrecy.    Loud laughing and giggling are in excessively bad taste. Do not  interrupt yourself by laughing at what you are about to say.    Eschew scandal, for \"in scandal as in robbery, the receiver is  always thought as bad as the thief.\" Mimicry is the lowest and  most ill-bred of all buffoonery.    Swearing, sneering, private affairs either of yourself or any  other, have long ago been banished out of the conversation of  well-mannered people.    Never suppose, or never appear to suppose yourself the subject of  the conversation or laugh of the company.    Bashfulness is an inconvenient quality, which a great authority  has stated to be \"the distinguishing character of a booby.\"  Nicknames are abominable, and are never allowed in good society.  Call people and things by their right names, and avoid  affectations of all kinds.    If your friends become the subject of conversation, never compare  one with another, or mention the vices of one to add to the lustre  of virtue of the other. Find something pleasant to say of each,  that you may not earn the reputation of a backbiter.    In conversing with a foreigner, betray no impatience if he  hesitates for a word to express himself, nor any ridicule if his  language is faulty. If you speak his own tongue, say so when you  begin the conversation, as this is never a mere display of an  accomplishment, but a true kindness to \"a stranger in a strange  land.\" You are almost certain to give pleasure by so doing.    To speak constantly of public characters or distinguished people  as your intimate friends, even if they are so, is a certain mark  of low-breeding. Boasting of your own position, wealth, luxuries  or possessions of any kind is in equally bad taste.    Never speak to a literary person of his works.

In the centre was a square pool sunken  below the surface of the floor; steps led down into it, sculptured  pillars supported a frescoed ceiling. A delicious marble Cupid appeared  to have just alighted on his pedestal at the upper end of the room. The  whole interior was Boris' work and mine. Boris, in his working-clothes of  white canvas, scraped the traces of clay and red modelling wax from his  handsome hands, and coquetted over his shoulder with the Cupid.    \"I see you,\" he insisted, \"don't try to look the other way and pretend  not to see me. You know who made you, little humbug!\"    It was always my role to interpret Cupid's sentiments in these  conversations, and when my turn came I responded in such a manner, that  Boris seized my arm and dragged me toward the pool, declaring he would  duck me. Next instant he dropped my arm and turned pale. \"Good God!\" he  said, \"I forgot the pool is full of the solution!\"    I shivered a little, and dryly advised him to remember better where he  had stored the precious liquid.    \"In Heaven's name, why do you keep a small lake of that gruesome stuff  here of all places?\" I asked.    \"I want to experiment on something large,\" he replied.    \"On me, for instance?\"    \"Ah! that came too close for jesting; but I do want to watch the action  of that solution on a more highly organized living body; there is that  big white rabbit,\" he said, following me into the studio.    Jack Scott, wearing a paint-stained jacket, came wandering in,  appropriated all the Oriental sweetmeats he could lay his hands on,  looted the cigarette case, and finally he and Boris disappeared together  to visit the Luxembourg Gallery, where a new silver bronze by Rodin and a  landscape of Monet's were claiming the exclusive attention of artistic  France. I went back to the studio, and resumed my work. It was a  Renaissance screen, which Boris wanted me to paint for Genevieve's  boudoir. But the small boy who was unwillingly dawdling through a series  of poses for it, to-day refused all bribes to be good. He never rested an  instant in the same position, and inside of five minutes I had as many  different outlines of the little beggar.    \"Are you posing, or are you executing a song and dance, my friend?\" I  inquired.    \"Whichever monsieur pleases,\" he replied, with an angelic smile.    Of course I dismissed him for the day, and of course I paid him for the  full time, that being the way we spoil our models.    After the young imp had gone, I made a few perfunctory daubs at my work,  but was so thoroughly out of humour, that it took me the rest of the  afternoon to undo the damage I had done, so at last I scraped my palette,  stuck my brushes in a bowl of black soap, and strolled into the  smoking-room. I really believe that, excepting Genevieve's apartments, no  room in the house was so free from the perfume of tobacco as this one. It  was a queer chaos of odds and ends, hung with threadbare tapestry. A  sweet-toned old spinet in good repair stood by the window. There were  stands of weapons, some old and dull, others bright and modern, festoons  of Indian and Turkish armour over the mantel, two or three good pictures,  and a pipe-rack. It was here that we used to come for new sensations in  smoking. I doubt if any type of pipe ever existed which was not  represented in that rack. When we had selected one, we immediately  carried it somewhere else and smoked it; for the place was, on the whole,  more gloomy and less inviting than any in the house. But this afternoon,  the twilight was very soothing, the rugs and skins on the floor looked  brown and soft and drowsy; the big couch was piled with cushions--I found  my pipe and curled up there for an unaccustomed smoke in the  smoking-room. I had chosen one with a long flexible stem, and lighting it  fell to dreaming. After a while it went out, but I did not stir. I  dreamed on and presently fell asleep.    I awoke to the saddest music I had ever heard. The room was quite dark, I  had no idea what time it was. A ray of moonlight silvered one edge of the  old spinet, and the polished wood seemed to exhale the sounds as perfume  floats above a box of sandalwood. Some one rose in the darkness, and came  away weeping quietly, and I was fool enough to cry out \"Genevieve!\"    She dropped at my voice, and, I had time to curse myself while I made a  light and tried to raise her from the floor. She shrank away with a  murmur of pain. She was very quiet, and asked for Boris. I carried her to  the divan, and went to look for him, but he was not in the house, and the  servants were gone to bed. Perplexed and anxious, I hurried back to  Genevieve. She lay where I had left her, looking very white.    \"I can't find Boris nor any of the servants,\" I said.    \"I know,\" she answered faintly, \"Boris has gone to Ept with Mr. Scott. I  did not remember when I sent you for him just now.\"    \"But he can't get back in that case before to-morrow afternoon, and--are  you hurt? Did I frighten you into falling? What an awful fool I am, but I  was only half awake.\"    \"Boris thought you had gone home before dinner. Do please excuse us for  letting you stay here all this time.\"    \"I have had a long nap,\" I laughed, \"so sound that I did not know whether  I was still asleep or not when I found myself staring at a figure that  was moving toward me, and called out your name. Have you been trying the  old spinet? You must have played very softly.\"    I would tell a thousand more lies worse than that one to see the look of  relief that came into her face. She smiled adorably, and said in her  natural voice: \"Alec, I tripped on that wolf's head, and I think my ankle  is sprained. Please call Marie, and then go home.\"    I did as she bade me, and left her there when the maid came in.          III    At noon next day when I called, I found Boris walking restlessly about  his studio.    \"Genevieve is asleep just now,\" he told me, \"the sprain is nothing, but  why should she have such a high fever? The doctor can't account for it;  or else he will not,\" he muttered.    \"Genevieve has a fever?\" I asked.    \"I should say so, and has actually been a little light-headed at  intervals all night. The idea! gay little Genevieve, without a care in  the world,--and she keeps saying her heart's broken, and she wants to  die!\"    My own heart stood still.    Boris leaned against the door of his studio, looking down, his hands in  his pockets, his kind, keen eyes clouded, a new line of trouble drawn  \"over the mouth's good mark, that made the smile.\" The maid had orders to  summon him the instant Genevieve opened her eyes. We waited and waited,  and Boris, growing restless, wandered about, fussing with modelling wax  and red clay. Suddenly he started for the next room. \"Come and see my  rose-coloured bath full of death!\" he cried.    \"Is it death?\" I asked, to humour his mood.    \"You are not prepared to call it life, I suppose,\" he answered. As he  spoke he plucked a solitary goldfish squirming and twisting out of its  globe. \"We'll send this one after the other--wherever that is,\" he said.  There was feverish excitement in his voice. A dull weight of fever lay on  my limbs and on my brain as I followed him to the fair crystal pool with  its pink-tinted sides; and he dropped the creature in. Falling, its  scales flashed with a hot orange gleam in its angry twistings and  contortions; the moment it struck the liquid it became rigid and sank  heavily to the bottom. Then came the milky foam, the splendid hues  radiating on the surface and then the shaft of pure serene light broke  through from seemingly infinite depths. Boris plunged in his hand and  drew out an exquisite marble thing, blue-veined, rose-tinted, and  glistening with opalescent drops.    \"Child's play,\" he muttered, and looked wearily, longingly at me,--as if  I could answer such questions! But Jack Scott came in and entered into  the \"game,\" as he called it, with ardour. Nothing would do but to try the  experiment on the white rabbit then and there. I was willing that Boris  should find distraction from his cares, but I hated to see the life go  out of a warm, living creature and I declined to be present. Picking up a  book at random, I sat down in the studio to read. Alas! I had found  _The King in Yellow_. After a few moments, which seemed ages, I was  putting it away with a nervous shudder, when Boris and Jack came in  bringing their marble rabbit. At the same time the bell rang above, and a  cry came from the sick-room. Boris was gone like a flash, and the next  moment he called, \"Jack, run for the doctor; bring him back with you.  Alec, come here.\"    I went and stood at her door. A frightened maid came out in haste and ran  away to fetch some remedy. Genevieve, sitting bolt upright, with crimson  cheeks and glittering eyes, babbled incessantly and resisted Boris'  gentle restraint. He called me to help. At my first touch she sighed and  sank back, closing her eyes, and then--then--as we still bent above her,  she opened them again, looked straight into Boris' face--poor  fever-crazed girl!--and told her secret. At the same instant our three  lives turned into new channels; the bond that held us so long together  snapped for ever and a new bond was forged in its place, for she had  spoken my name, and as the fever tortured her, her heart poured out its  load of hidden sorrow. Amazed and dumb I bowed my head, while my face  burned like a live coal, and the blood surged in my ears, stupefying me  with its clamour. Incapable of movement, incapable of speech, I listened  to her feverish words in an agony of shame and sorrow. I could not  silence her, I could not look at Boris. Then I felt an arm upon my  shoulder, and Boris turned a bloodless face to mine.    \"It is not your fault, Alec; don't grieve so if she loves you--\" but he  could not finish; and"]]]
