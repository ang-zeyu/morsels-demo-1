Doubtless  much of what is commonly called \"liver\" or \"kidney complaint\" is only, in  one case, myalgia of the chest or abdominal walls near the liver, or, in  the other, of the back and loins near the kidneys. Chronic liver disease  is comparatively rare in the Northern States, and pain in the side is not  a prominent symptom; while certain diseases of the kidneys, which are as  surely fatal as pulmonary consumption, are not attended by pain in the  back opposite these organs.--WEY.] It may be so moderate as to produce  only a \"lame back,\" or so severe as to disable, as in the case of what is  popularly termed a \"crick in the back.\" Strong swimmers who sometimes  drown without apparent cause are supposed to be seized in this way.    7. _A Ganglion_, or what is vulgarly called a \"weak\" or \"weeping\"  sinew, is the swelling of a bursa. [Footnote: A bursa is a small sack  containing a lubricating fluid to prevent friction where tendons play over  hard surfaces. There is one shaped like an hourglass on the wrist, just at  the edge of the palm. By pressing back the liquid it contains, this bursa  may be clearly seen.] It sometimes becomes so distended by fluid as to be  mistaken for bone. If on binding something hard upon it for a few days it  does not disappear, a physician will remove the liquid by means of a  hypodermic syringe, or perhaps cause it to be absorbed by an external  application of iodine.

Insensible itself, it is the organ of touch. It feels the  pressure of a hair, yet bears the weight of the body. It yields to every  motion of that which it wraps and holds in place. It hides from view the  delicate organs within, yet the faintest tint of a thought shines through,  while the soul paints upon it, as on a canvas, the richest and rarest of  colors.

THE SKIN is a tough, thin, close-fitting garment for the protection of the  tender flesh. Its perfect elasticity beautifully adapts it to every motion  of the body. We shall learn hereafter that it is more than a mere  covering, being an active organ, which does its part in the work of  keeping in order the house in which we live. It oils itself to preserve  its smoothness and delicacy, replaces itself as fast as it wears out, and  is at once the perfection of use and beauty.    1. STRUCTURE OF THE SKIN.    CUTIS AND CUTICLE.--What we commonly call the skin--viz., the part raised  by a blister--is only the cuticle [Footnote: _Cuticula_, little skin.  It is often styled the scarfskin, and also the epidermis (_epi_,  upon; and _derma_, skin).] or covering of the cutis or true skin. The  latter is full of nerves and blood vessels, while the former neither  bleeds [Footnote: We notice this in shaving; for if a razor goes below the  cuticle, it is followed by pain and blood. So insensible is this outer  layer that we can run a pin through the thick mass at the roots of the  nails without discomfort.] nor gives rise to pain, neither suffers from  heat nor feels the cold.    The cuticle is composed of small, flat cells or scales. These are  constantly shed from the surface in the form of scurf, dandruff, etc., but  are as constantly renewed from the cutis [Footnote: We see how rapidly  this change goes on by noticing how soon a stain of any kind disappears  from the skin. A snake throws off its cuticle entire, and at regular  intervals.] below.    Under the microscope, we can see the round cells of the cuticle, and how  they are flattened and hardened as they are forced to the surface. The  immense number of these cells surpasses comprehension. In one square inch  of the cuticle, counting only those in a single layer, there are over a  billion horny scales, each complete in itself.--HARTING.    FIG. 22.    [Illustration: A _represents a vertical section of the Cuticle._ B,  _lateral view of the cells._ C, _flat side of scales like_ d,  _magnified 250 diameters, showing the nucleated cells transformed into  broad scales._]    VALUE OF THE CUTICLE.--In the palm of the hand, the sole of the foot, and  other parts especially liable to injury, the cuticle is very thick. This  is a most admirable provision for their protection. [Footnote: We can hold  the hand in strong brine with impunity, but the smart will quickly tell us  when there is even a scratch in the skin. Vaccine matter must be inserted  beneath the cuticle to take effect. This membrane doubtless prevents many  poisonous substances from entering the system.] By use, it becomes callous  and horny. The boy who goes out barefoot for the first time, \"treading as  if on eggs,\" can soon run where he pleases among thistles and over stones.  The blacksmith handles hot iron without pain, while the mason lays stones  and works in lime, without scratching or corroding his flesh.    THE COMPLEXION.--In the freshly made cells on the lower side of the  cuticle, is a pigment composed of tiny grains. [Footnote: These grains are  about 1/2000 of an inch in diameter, and, curiously enough, do not appear  opaque, but transparent and nearly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7001"],[0,"History of the Philippine Islands (#9)"],[1,"had gone from the port  of Nangasaqui to Manila for some years, laden with their flour and  other goods, where they had been kindly received, and despatched. But  Taicosama, [41] lord of all Xapon, was incited through the efforts of  Farandaquiemon--a Japanese of low extraction, one of those who came to  Manila--to write in a barbarous and arrogant manner to the governor,  demanding submission and tribute, and threatening to come with a fleet  and troops to lay waste the country. But, between demands and replies,  several years were spent, until at last Taico died. [42]    While Xapon was causing the governor some anxiety, the king of Camboja  sent him an embassy by the Portuguese Diego Belloso, who brought  a present of two elephants and offers of friendship and trade with  his kingdom, and implored aid against Sian--which was threatening  Camboja. The governor answered the king, and sent him a horse, with  a few emeralds and other objects, but postponed until later what  related to aid, and thanked him for his friendship. This was the  origin of the events and the expeditions made later from Manila to  the kingdoms of Sian and Camboja, on the mainland of Asia.    From the moment that Gomez Perez received his charge in España, he had  cherished the desire to lead an expedition from Manila to conquer the  fort of Terrenate in Maluco, on account of the great importance of this  enterprise, and its outcome, in which no success had been attained on  other occasions. He was constantly making necessary arrangements for  undertaking this expedition, but so secretly that he declared it to no  one, until, in the year ninety-three, seeing that the preparations for  his intention appeared sufficient, he declared his purpose, and made  ready to set out in person, with more than nine hundred Spaniards and  two hundred sail, counting galleys, galliots, frigates, vireys, and  other craft. He left the war affairs of Manila and of the islands, with  a few troops--although insufficient for the city's defense--in charge  of Diego Ronquillo, his master-of-camp; and those of administration  and justice to Licentiate Pedro de Rojas. He also sent his son, Don  Luys Dasmariñas, forward with the rest of the fleet, as his lieutenant  in the office of captain-general, to the provinces of Pintados, whence  they were to sail; while he himself remained in Manila making his final  preparations and arming a galley of twenty-eight benches, in which he  was to sail. This galley he manned with good Chinese rowers, with pay,  [43] whom, in order to win their good will, he would not allow to be  chained, and even winked at their carrying certain weapons. About  forty Spaniards embarked on the galley, and the galley itself was  accompanied by a few frigates and smaller vessels, in which private  individuals embarked. The governor sailed from the port of Cabit,  in the month of October, one thousand five hundred and ninety-three,  for the provinces of Pintados, where they were to join the fleet which  was awaiting them there, and to proceed to Maluco. In the afternoon of  the second day of the voyage, they reached the island of Caça, [44]  twenty-four leguas from Manila, and close to the coast of the same  island of Luzon, at a place called Punta del Açufre [Sulphur Point],  where there is a strong head wind. The galley tried to round this  point by rowing, but being unable to make any headway until the wind  should drop, they anchored and spread an awning, and stayed there that  night. Some of the vessels sailing with the galley went in closer to  the shore in sight of the galley, and awaited it there.    The governor and those who accompanied him passed the night playing  on the poop, until the end of the first watch. After the governor had  gone into his cabin to rest, the other Spaniards went also to their  quarters [45] for the same purpose, leaving the usual guards in the  midship gangway, and at the bow and stern. The Chinese rowers, who  had three days before that conspired to seize the galley whenever a  favorable opportunity presented itself--in order to avoid the labor  of rowing on this expedition, and their covetousness of the money,  jewels, and other articles of value aboard the vessel--thought that  they should not lose their opportunity. Having provided candles, and  white shirts with which to clothe themselves, and appointed chiefs  for its execution, they carried out their plan that same night, in  the last watch before dawn, when they perceived that the Spaniards  were asleep. At a signal which one of them gave they all at the same  time put on their shirts, lit their candles, and catan [46] in hand,  attacked the guards and the men who slept in the quarters [ballesteras]  and in the wales, and wounding and killing them, they seized the  galley. A few of the Spaniards escaped, some by swimming ashore,  others by means of the galley's tender, which was at the stern. When  the governor heard the noise from his cabin, thinking that the galley  was dragging and that the crew were lowering the awning and taking to  the oars, he hurried carelessly out bareheaded through the hatchway of  the cabin. Several Chinese were awaiting him there and split his head  with a catan. Thus wounded he fell down the stairs into his cabin, and  the two servants whom he kept there, carried him to his bed, where he  immediately died. The servants met the same fate from the stabs given  them through the hatch. The only surviving Spaniards in the galley  were Juan de Cuellar, the governor's secretary, and Father Montilla of  the Franciscan order, who were sleeping in the cabin amidships, and  who remained there without coming out; nor did the Chinese, thinking  that there were more Spaniards, dare to go in until next day, when  they took the two men out and later put them ashore on the coast of  Ylocos, in the same island of Luzon, in order that the natives might  allow them to take water on shore, which they badly needed.    Although the Spaniards who were in the other vessels, close to the  land, perceived the lights and heard the noise made in the galley  from their ships, they thought that some work was being done; and when  shortly afterward, they learned what was happening from those who had  escaped by swimming, they could render no assistance and kept still,  as everything was lost, and they were few and not in sufficient force  therefor. They waited for the morning, and when it began to dawn,  they saw that the galley had already set its bastard, and was sailing,  wind astern toward China, and they were unable to pursue it.    The galley sailed with a favorable wind all along the coast of  the island until leaving it. It took some water at Ylocos, where  the secretary and the religious were abandoned. The Chinese tried  to make for China, but not being able to fetch it, they ported in  the kingdom of Cochinchina, where the king of Tunquin seized their  cargo and two large pieces of artillery which were intended for the  expedition of Maluco, the royal standard, and all the jewels, money,  and articles of value; the galley he left to drift ashore, and the  Chinese dispersed and fled to different provinces. Governor Gomez Perez  met this unfortunate death, whereupon the expedition and enterprise  to Maluco, which the governor had undertaken, ceased also. Thus ended  his administration, after he had ruled somewhat more than three years.    Among other despatches which Gomez Perez Dasmariñas brought from España  there was an order from his Majesty which authorized him to appoint  the person whom he thought best to succeed him in case of death,  until such time as his Majesty should appoint his successor. He  showed this order to several of the most important persons of the  island, giving each one to understand that he would be appointed,  especially to Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa, an inhabitant  of Pintados, a rich man of merit, and one of the first conquerors  of the land. To him the governor showed an appointment drawn in his  favor. He made use of the captain on all occasions and had him go with  himself to Maluco. The news of the seizure of the galley was soon  known in Manila. The citizens and soldiers that had remained there,  assembled at the house of Licentiate Pedro de Rojas, to discuss  advisable measures. First of all they elected the latter governor  and captain-general. Then they sent Captain Don Juan Ronquillo del  Castillo and other captains with two frigates (for there were no other  vessels) in pursuit of the galley, a fruitless attempt, for the galley  was nowhere to be seen. The new governor also sent a message to Don  Luis Dasmariñas and to the army and fleet who were awaiting Gomez  Perez in Pintados, informing him of the latter's death and of what  had happened, as well as of his own recent election to affairs of  government. He also ordered them to return with all speed to Manila,  for the city was left almost deserted, and without the necessary  precautions for any emergency.    The news caused great grief in the fleet. Don Luys Dasmariñas and  Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa, each in his own heart, was  certain that he was to become governor, taking it for granted that  the governor had nominated him for the office. With this hope, both  of them with the best ships and crews of the fleet, set sail together  for Manila with the utmost speed.    Licentiate Pedro de Rojas, anxious about this provision, which the  governor would leave among his papers and drawers deposited in the  monastery of St. Augustine in Manila, in the possession of Fray Diego  Muñoz, prior and commissary of the Holy Office, made the effort to  gain possession of them. Although he seized some of them, he did not  find the said provision, for the prior had anticipated him and set  aside one of the drawers, in which the provision was supposed to be  found, to await Don Luys Dasmariñas's arrival in the city.
