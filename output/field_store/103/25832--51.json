Don't you see? Oh, Percy! you wouldn't  quite do that?\"    Van laughed. \"She's got us, Percy,\" he said, \"quite fast. You know you  won't fight, and I won't again; we both said so a little while back; so  what's the good of holding out now?\"    Percy drew himself up very slowly and decidedly. \"I won't trouble you  so again, Polly,\" holding out his hand. \"Now would you like oysters?\"  all in the same breath.    \"And here's mine,\" cried Van, extending his brown one. \"Can't I bring  you some salad?\"    \"Yes, yes,\" cried Polly gaily, and she released their hands after a  cordial grasp. \"You may bring me everything straight through, boys,\" as  they rushed off, heads erect, to the crowded supper-table.    \"You've had a good time?\" asked Mrs. Pepper slowly, with a keen glance  into the flushed face and sparkling eyes, as they turned up the gas in  Polly's bedroom. \"Dear me! it is half-past eleven.\"    \"Splendid,\" said Polly, shaking herself free from the white gown and  beginning to braid her hair for the night. \"Percy and Van were  perfectly lovely, and Mr. Alstyne was so good to me. And oh! Mamsie,  isn't dear Mr. King just the dearest dear, to give all this to the  boys? We haven't thanked him half enough.\"    \"He is indeed,\" said Mrs. Pepper heartily. \"Why, where is Phronsie?\"  looking around the room.    \"She was right back of you,\" said Polly. \"She wanted to take off her  things herself. Did you ever see such a sweet\"--she began, but Mrs.  Pepper did not stop to hear, hurrying out to the adjoining room, shared  by the mother and her baby.    \"She isn't here,\" Polly heard her say in bewildered tones. So Polly,  her long hair blown about her face, ran in, brush in hand.    \"Why, where\"--she began laughingly.    \"She wouldn't go downstairs, I don't think,\" said Mrs. Pepper, peering  in all the corners, and even meditating a look under the bed.    \"No, no,\" cried Polly, \"the lights are all turned out,\" investigating  all possible and impossible nooks that a mouse could creep into. \"Where  can she be? Phronsie--Phronsie!\"    \"Well, of course she is downstairs,\" declared Mrs. Pepper at last,  hurrying out of the room.    \"Take a candle, Mamsie, you'll fall,\" cried Polly, and throwing on her  bath wrapper, she seized the light from the mantel and hurried after  her.    Half-way down she could hear Phronsie's gay little laugh, and catch the  words \"Good-night, my dear Grandpapa,\" and then she came slowly out  from Mr. King's sitting-room, and softly closed the door.    \"Phronsie!\" exclaimed Polly, sitting down on the middle of the stairs,  the candle shaking ominously, \"how could\"--    \"Hush!\" said Mrs. Pepper, who had fumbled her way along the hall.  \"Don't say anything. Oh, Phronsie dear, so you went down to bid  Grandpapa good-night, did you?\"    Phronsie turned a glance of gentle surprise on her mother, and then  looked up at Polly.    \"No, not exactly to bid him good-night,\" she said slowly. \"I was afraid  he was sick; I heard him coughing, so I went down.\"    \"He is quite well, isn't he?\" asked Mrs. Pepper. \"Here, give me your  hand, child; we must get up to bed.\"    \"Oh, yes! he is quite really and truly all well,\" declared Phronsie,  breaking into another glad little laugh. \"He said he never had such a  beautiful time in his life, and he is just as well as he can be. Oh,  Polly!\" as she picked up her Princess gown and prepared to ascend the  stairs, \"how funny you look sitting there!\"    \"Funny?\" said Polly grimly. \"I dare say, and I feel funny too,  Phronsie.\"          VI    THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE      They were all sitting around the library fire; Polly under the pretext  of holding Phronsie's head in her lap, was sitting on the rug beside  her, the boys on either hand; old Mr. King was marching up and down the  long room, and looking at them. The merriest of stories had been told,  Polly urging on all the school records of jolly times, and those not so  enjoyable; songs had been sung, and all sorts of nonsense aired. At  last Joel sprang up and ran over to pace by the old gentleman's side.    \"Christmas was good enough,\" said the boy, by way of beginning  conversation.    \"Hey?\" responded the old gentleman, looking down at him, \"I should  think it was. Well, and how about the wonderful play on the  twenty-first? And that was good enough, too, I dare say.\"    \"That was well enough,\" said Joel indifferently, \"I don't care for such  stuff, though.\"    \"Tut--tut!\" cried Mr. King in pretended anger, \"now I won't have  anything said against that wonderful production. Not a thing, sir, do  you hear?\"    Joel laughed, his chubby face twinkling all over in secret amusement.  \"Well, I know something better, if you'll only let us do it, sir, than  a hundred old plays.\"    \"And pray what is it?\" demanded Mr. King, \"let's have it at once. But  the idea of surpassing the play! Oh, no, no, it can't be done, sir!\"    \"It's to go and see the little brown house,\" said Joel, standing up on  his tiptoes to a level with the old gentleman's ear, and one eye  looking backward to see that nobody heard.    Mr. King started, pulled his handsome moustache thoughtfully, looked at  Joel sharply, and then over at the group in the firelight.    \"They don't know anything about it,\" cried the boy in a whisper, \"don't  tell them. It's my secret, and yours,\" he added generously. \"Oh! if we  might only go and look at it.\"    \"It's winter,\" observed the old gentleman, and stepping to the window  he put aside the draperies, to peer out into the black evening. \"Yes,  it really is winter,\" he added with a shiver, to the boy who was close  behind, and as if no longer in doubt about it, he added most  emphatically, \"it really is winter, Joel.\"    \"Well, but you never saw anything like it, how magnificent winter is in  Badgertown,\" cried Joel in an excited whisper. \"Such hills to coast  down; the snow is always crisp there, sir, not like this dirty town  mud. And the air is as dry as punk,\" he added artfully. \"Oh! 'twould be  such a lark;\" he actually clasped his hands.    \"Badgertown isn't so very far off,\" said Mr. King thoughtfully, \"I'll  think about it and see if we can manage it.\"    \"Ugh-ow!\" squealed Joel, utterly forgetful of his caution of secrecy,  \"we can, we can; we can open the little brown house, and build great  fires there, and\"--But he got no further. Into the midst of Van's  liveliest sally, came the words \"little brown house,\" bringing all the  young people to their feet, Phronsie running to the old gentleman's  side, with, \"What is it, Grandpapa? He said the little brown house.\"    \"Get away!\" cried Joel crossly to the besiegers, each and all wildly  clamoring. \"What is it? What are you talking about? It's my secret,\" he  cried, \"and his,\" pointing with a dismayed finger to Mr. King.    \"Well, it isn't a secret any longer,\" cried Polly, flushing with  excitement. \"You said 'little brown house,' we heard you just as  plainly; and you re getting up something, I know you are.\" \"People  don't usually select a roomful of listeners, and then shout out their  secrets,\" said Jasper. \"You are in for it now, Joe, and no mistake. Go  ahead, old fellow, and give us the rest of it.\"    Joel whirled away from them all in desperation. \"You might as well,\"  laughed the old gentleman, \"the mischief is done now, and no mistake.\"    So Joel, thus set upon, allowed the whole beautiful plan to be wrung  from him, by slow and torturing installments; how they all were to go  to Badgertown, open the little brown house, and stay there--here he  glanced at Mr. King--\"perhaps a week,\" he brought out suddenly, filling  the time with all sorts of frolics, and playing they were there again,  and really and truly living in the old home.    At last it was all out, to be received in different ways by the  listeners.    \"Oh, Joe!\" cried Davie with shining eyes. \"We never could come away  again if we once get there, never!\"    Polly stood quite still, a mist gathering before her glad eyes, out of  which she dimly saw the little brown house arise and beckon to her.    Phronsie jumped up and down and clapped her hands in glee. \"Oh,  Grandpapa, Grandpapa!\" she screamed, \"please take us to the little  brown house, please!\"    That settled it. \"I do not think we need to consider it longer,\" said  Mr. King, glancing at Ben, whose face told what he thought, \"children,  we will go--that is, if Mrs. Pepper says yes.    \"I will ask her,\" cried Joel with a howl, springing off.    \"Come on,\" cried Jasper, \"let's all 'be in at the death.'\" And the  library was deserted in a twinkling.    But mother was nowhere to be found. \"Upstairs, downstairs, and in the  lady's chamber,\" they sought her wildly.    \"Oh! I forgot,\" exclaimed Polly, when at last they gathered in the wide  hall, disposing themselves on the chairs and along the stairs, all  tired out. \"She has gone to evening meeting with Auntie. How stupid of  me not to remember that.\"    \"Well, I declare!\" cried a voice above them, and looking up they met  the cold blue eyes of Mrs. Chatterton regarding them over the railing.  \"Cousin Horatio, do you keep a menagerie, or a well-ordered house, I  beg to inquire?\"    \"A menagerie,\" said Mr. King coolly, leaning on the balustrade at the  foot of the stairs, and looking up at her. \"All sorts of strange  animals wander in here, Cousin.\"    \"Hum; I understand. I'm not so dull as you think. Well, you've changed,  let me tell you, vastly, and not for the better either, in the last six  years. Who would ever suppose I see before me fastidious Horatio King!\"  she exclaimed, lifting her long thin hands to show him their  horror-stricken palms.    \"I dare say, I dare say, Cousin Eunice,\" assented Mr. King carelessly,  \"but I consider all you say as a compliment.\"    \"Compliment?\" she repeated disdainfully, and added with a rising note  of anger, forgetting "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5637"],[0,"Literary and Philosophical Essays: French, German and Italian (#9)"],[1,"acquaint himselfe with, sometimes all wet and bemyred,  other times sweatie and full of dust, and to drinke being either  extreme hot or exceeding cold; and it would trouble them to see him  ride a rough-untamed horse, or with his weapon furiously incounter a  skilful Fencer, or to handle or shoot-off a musket; against which  there is no remedy, if he will make him prove a sufficient,  compleat, or honest man: he must not be spared in his youth; and it  will come to passe, that he shall many times have occasion and be  forced to shocke the rules of Physicke.

It is not sufficient to make his minde strong, his muskles must also  be strengthened: the mind is over-borne if it be not seconded: and  it is too much for her alone to discharge two offices. I have a  feeling how mine panteth, being joyned to so tender and sensible  [Footnote: Sensitive.] a bodie, and that lieth so heavie upon it And  in my lecture, I often perceive how my Authors in their writings  sometimes commend examples for magnanimitie and force, that rather  proceed from a thicke skin and hardnes of the bones. I have knowne  men, women and children borne of so hard a constitution, that a blow  with a cudgell would lesse hurt them, than a filip would doe me, and  so dull and blockish, that they will neither stir tongue nor  eyebrowes, beat them never so much. When wrestlers goe about to  counterfeit the Philosophers patience, they rather shew the vigor of  their sinnewes than of their heart. For the custome to beare  travell, is to tolerate griefe: Labor callum obducit dolori.  [Footnote: Cic. Tusc. Qu. I. ii.] \"Labour worketh a hardnesse upon  sorrow.\" Hee must be enured to suffer the paine and hardnesse of  exercises, that so he may be induced to endure the paine of the  colicke, of cauterie, of fals, of sprains, and other diseases  incident to mans bodie: yea, if need require, patiently to beare  imprisonment and other tortures, by which sufferance he shall come  to be had in more esteeme and accompt: for according to time and  place, the good as well as the bad man may haply fall into them; we  have seen it by experience. Whosoever striveth against the lawes,  threats good men with mischiefe and extortion. Moreover, the  authoritie of the Tutor (who should be soveraigne over him) is by  the cockering and presence of the parents, hindred and interrupted:  besides the awe and respect which the houshold beares him, and the  knowledge of the meane, possibilities, and greatnesse of his house,  are in my judgement no small lets [Footnote: Hindrances.]in a young  Gentleman. In this schoole of commerce, and societie among men, I  have often noted this vice, that in lieu of taking acquaintance of  others, we only endevour to make our selves knowne to them: and we  are more ready to utter such merchandize as we have, than to  ingrosse and purchase new commodities. Silence and modestie are  qualities very convenient to civil conversation. It is also  necessary that a young man be rather taught to be discreetly-sparing  and close-handed, than prodigally-wastfull and lavish in his  expences, and moderate in husbanding his wealth when he shall come  to possesse it. And not to take pepper in the nose for every foolish  tale that shall be spoken in his presence, because it is an uncivil  importunity to contradict whatsoever is not agreeing to our humour:  let him be pleased to correct himselfe. And let him not seeme to  blame that in others which he refuseth to doe himselfe, nor goe  about to withstand common fashions, Licet sapere sine pompa, sine  invidia: [Footnote: SEN. Epist. ciii. f.] \"A man may bee wise  without ostentation, without envie.\" Let him avoid those imperious  images of the world, those uncivil behaviours and childish ambition  wherewith, God wot, too-too many are possest: that is, to make a  faire shew of that which is not in him: endevouring to be reputed  other than indeed he is; and as if reprehension and new devices were  hard to come by, he would by that meane acquire into himselfe the  name of some peculiar vertue. As it pertaineth but to great Poets to  use the libertie of arts; so is it tolerable but in noble minds and  great spirits to have a preheminence above ordinarie fashions. Si  quid Socrates et Aristippus contra morem et consuetudinem fecerunt,  idem sibi ne arbitretur licere: Magis enim illi et divinis bonis  hanc licentiam assequebantur: [Footnote: CIC. Off. 1. i.] \"If  Socrates and Aristippus have done ought against custome or good  manner, let not a man thinke he may doe the same: for they obtained  this licence by their great and excellent good parts:\" He shall be  taught not to enter rashly into discourse or contesting, but when he  shall encounter with a Champion worthie his strength; And then would  I not have him imploy all the tricks that may fit his turne, but  only such as may stand him in most stead. That he be taught to be  curious in making choice of his reasons, loving pertinency, and by  consequence brevitie. That above all, he be instructed to yeeld, yea  to quit his weapons unto truth, as soone as he shall discerne the  same, whether it proceed from his adversarie, or upon better advice  from himselfe; for he shall not be preferred to any place of  eminencie above others, for repeating of a prescript [Footnote:  Fixed beforehand.] part; and he is not engaged to defend any cause,  further than he may approove it; nor shall he bee of that trade  where the libertie for a man to repent and re-advise himselfe is  sold for readie money, Neque, ut omnia, que praescripta et imperata  sint, defendat, necessitate ulla cogitur: [Footnote: CIC. Acad. Qu.  I. iv.] \"Nor is he inforced by any necessitie to defend and make  good all that is prescribed and commanded him.\" If his tutor agree  with my humour, he shall frame his affection to be a most loyall and  true subject to his Prince, and a most affectionate and couragious  Gentleman in al that may concerne the honor of his Soveraigne or the  good of his countrie, and endevour to suppresse in him all manner of  affection to undertake any action Otherwise than for a publike good  and dutie. Besides many inconveniences, which greatly prejudice our  libertie by reason of these particular bonds, the judgment of a man  that is waged and bought, either it is lesse free and honest, or  else it is blemisht with oversight and ingratitude. A meere and  precise Courtier can neither have law nor will to speake or thinke  otherwise than favourablie of his Master, who among so many  thousands of his subjects hath made choice of him alone, to  institute and bring him up with his owne hand. These favours, with  the commodities that follow minion [Footnote: Favorite.] Courtiers,  corrupt (not without some colour of reason) his libertie, and dazle  his judgement. It is therefore commonly scene that the Courtiers-  language differs from other mens, in the same state, and to be of no  great credit in such matters. Let therefore his conscience and  vertue shine in his speech, and reason be his chiefe direction, Let  him be taught to confesse such faults as he shall discover in his  owne discourses, albeit none other perceive them but himselfe; for  it is an evident shew of judgement, and effect of sinceritie, which  are the chiefest qualities he aymeth at. That wilfully to strive,  and obstinately to contest in words, are common qualities, most  apparent in basest mindes: That to readvise and correct himselfe,  and when one is most earnest, to leave an ill opinion, are rare,  noble, and Philosophicall conditions. Being in companie, he shall be  put in minde, to cast his eyes round about, and every where: For I  note, that the chiefe places are usually seezed upon by the most  unworthie and lesse capable; and that height of fortune is seldome  joyned with sufficiencie. I have scene that whilst they at the upper  end of a board were busie entertaining themselves with talking of  the beautie of the hangings about a chamber, or of the taste of some  good cup of wine, many good discourses at the lower end have utterly  been lost. He shall weigh the carriage of every man in his calling,  a Heardsman, a Mason, a Stranger, or a Traveller; all must be  imployed; every one according to his worth; for all helps to make up  houshold; yea, the follie and the simplicitie of others shall be as  instructions to him. By controlling the graces and manners of  others, he shall acquire unto himselfe envie of the good and  contempt of the bad. Let him hardly be possest with an honest  curiositie to search out the nature and causes of all things: let  him survay whatsoever is rare and singular about him; a building, a  fountaine, a man, a place where any battell hath been fought, or the  passages of Caesar or Charlemaine.         Quae tellus sit lenta gelu, qua putris ab aestu,       Ventus in Italiam quis bene vela ferat.       [Footnote: Prop. 1. iv.

He shall endevour to be familiarly acquainted with the customes,  with the meanes, with the state, with the dependances and alliances  of all Princes; they are things soone and pleasant to be learned,  and most profitable to be knowne.
