Upon his altars  smoked goats, sheep, and white bulls, in which he is said to have  particularly delighted; the oak was rendered sacred to him, because  he taught mankind to live upon acorns; he had many oracles where his  precepts were delivered, the most celebrated of these were at Dodona and  Ammon in Lybia; he was supposed to be invisible to the inhabitants of  the earth; the Lacedemonians erected his statue with four heads, thereby  indicating, that he listened readily to the solicitations of every  quarter of the earth. Minerva is represented as having no mother, but to  have come completely armed from his brains, when his head was opened by  Vulcan; by which it is meant to infer that wisdom is the result of  this ethereal fluid. Thus, following the same fictions, the sun, that  beneficent star which has such a marked influence over the earth, became  an Osiris, a Belus, a Mithras, an Adonis, an Apollo. Nature, rendered  sorrowful by his periodical absence, was an Isis, an Astarte, a Venus,  a Cybele. Astarte had a magnificent temple at Hieropolis served by three  hundred priests, who were always employed in offering sacrifices. The  priests of Cybele, called Corybantes, also Galli, were not admitted to  their sacred functions without previous mutilation. In the celebration  of their festivals these priests used all kinds of indecent expressions,  beat drums, cymbals, and behaved just like madmen: his worship extended  all over Phrygia, and was established in Greece under the name of  _Eleusinian mysteries_. In short, every thing was personified: the sea  was under the empire of Neptune; fire was adored by the Egyptians under  the name of Serapis; by the Persians, under that of Ormus or Oromaze;  and by the Romans, under that of Vesta and Vulcan.    Such was the origin of mythology: it may be said to be the daughter of  natural philosophy, embellished by poetry; only destined to describe  nature and its parts. If antiquity is consulted, it will be perceived  without much trouble, that these famous sages, those legislators, those  priests, those conquerors, who were the instructors of infant nations,  themselves adored active nature, or the great whole considered  relatively to its different operations or qualities; that this was what  they caused the ignorant savages whom they had gathered together to  adore. It was the great whole they deified; it was its various parts  which they made their inferior gods; it was from the necessity of her  laws they made fate. The Greeks called it Nature, a divinity who had  a thousand names. Varro says, \"I believe that God is the soul of the  universe, and that the universe is God.\" Cicero says \"that in the  mysteries of Samothracia, of Lemnos, of Eleusis, it was nature much more  than the gods, they explained to the initiated.\" Pliny says, \"we must  believe that the world, or that which is contained under the vast  extent of the heavens, is the Divinity; even eternal, infinite, without  beginning or end.\" It was these different modes of considering nature  that gave birth to Polytheism, to idolatry. Allegory masqued its mode  of action: it was at length parts of this great whole, that idolatry  represented by statues and symbols.    To complete the proofs of what has been said; to shew distinctly that it  was the great whole, the universe, the nature of things, which was the  real object of the worship of Pagan antiquity, hardly any thing can be  more decisive than the beginning of the hymn of Orpheus addressed to the  god Pan.    \"O Pan! I invoke thee, O powerful god! O universal nature! the heavens,  the sea, the earth, who nourish all, and the eternal fire, because these  are thy members, O all powerful Pan,\" &c. Nothing can be more suitable  to confirm these ideas, than the ingenious explanation which is given  of the fable of Pan, as well as of the figure under which he is  represented. It is said, \"Pan, according to the signification of his  name, is the emblem by which the ancients have designated the great  assemblage of things or beings: he represents the universe; and, in the  mind of the wisest philosophers of antiquity, he passed for the greatest  and most ancient of the gods. The features under which he is delineated  form the portrait of nature, and of the savage state in which she was  found in the beginning. The spotted skin of the leopard, which  serves him for a mantle, imagined the heavens filled with stars and  constellations. His person was compounded of parts, some of which were  suitable to a reasonable animal, that is to say, to man; and others to  the animal destitute of reason, such as the goat. It is thus,\" says  he, \"that the universe is composed of an intelligence that governs the  whole, and of the prolific, fruitful elements of fire, water, earth,  air. Pan, loved to drink and to follow the nymphs; this announces the  occasion nature has for humidity in all her productions, and that this  god, like nature, is strongly inclined to propagation. According to the  Egyptians, and the most ancient Grecian philosophers, Pan had neither  father nor mother; he came out of Demogorgon at the same moment with  the Destinies, his fatal sisters; a fine method of expressing that the  universe was the work of an unknown power, and that it was formed after  the invariable relations, the eternal laws of necessity; but his most  significant symbol, that most suitable to express the harmony of the  universe, is his mysterious pipe, composed of seven unequal tubes, but  calculated to produce the nicest, the most perfect concord. The orbs  which compose the seven planets of our solar system, are of different  diameters; being bodies of unequal mass, they describe their revolutions  round the sun in various periods; nevertheless it is from the order of  their motion that results the harmony of the spheres,\" &c.    Here then is the great macrocosm, the mighty whole, the assemblage of  things adored and deified by the philosophers of antiquity; whilst the  uninformed stopped at the emblem under which this nature was depicted;  at the symbols under which its various parts, its numerous functions  were personified; his narrow mind, his barbarous ignorance, never  permitted him to mount higher; they alone were deemed worthy of being,  initiated into the mysteries, who knew the realities masqued under these  emblems. Indeed, it is not to be doubted for an instant, that the wisest  among the Pagans adored nature; which ethnic theology designated under  a great variety of nomenclature, under an immense number of different  emblems. Apuleius, although a decided Platonist, accustomed to the  mysterious, unintelligible notions of his master, calls \"Nature the  parent of all; the mother of the elements, the first offspring of the  world;\" again, \"the mother of the stars, the parent of the seasons, and  the governess of the whole world.\"--She was worshipped by many under the  appellation of the _mother of the gods_. Indeed, the first institutors  of nations, and their immediate successors in authority, only spoke to  the people by fables, allegories, enigmas, of which they reserved  to themselves the right of giving an explanation: this, in fact,  constituted the mysteries of the various worship paid to the Pagan  divinities. This mysterious tone they considered necessary, whether it  was to mask their own ignorance, or whether it was to preserve their  power over the uninformed, who for the most part only respect that which  is above their comprehension. Their explications were generally dictated  either by interest, or by a delirious imagination, frequently by  imposture; thus from age to age, they did no more than render nature and  its parts, which they had originally depicted, more unknown, until they  completely lost sight of the primitive ideas; these were replaced by a  multitude of fictitious personages, under whose features this nature had  primarily been represented to them. The people, either unaccustomed to  think, or deeply steeped in ignorance, adored these personages, without  penetrating into the true sense of the emblematical fables recounted to  them. These ideal beings, with material figures, in whom they believed  there resided a mysterious virtue, a divine power, were the objects of  their worship, the source of their fears, the fountain of their  hopes. The wonderful, the incredible actions ascribed to these fancied  divinities, were an inexhaustible fund of admiration, which gave  perpetual play to the fancy; which delighted not only the people of  those days, but even the children of latter ages. Thus were transmitted  from age to age, those marvellous accounts, which, although necessary to  the existence of the power usurped by the ministers of these gods, did,  in fact, nothing more than confirm the blindness of the ignorant: these  never supposed that it was nature, its various operations, its numerous  component parts--that it was the passions of man and his diverse  faculties that lay buried under an heap of allegories; they did not  perceive that the passions and faculties of human nature were used as  emblems, because man was ignorant of the true cause of the phenomena  he beheld. As strong passions seemed to hurry man along, in despite  of himself, they either attributed these passions to a god, or deified  them; frequently they did both: it was thus love became a deity; that  eloquence, poetry, industry, were transformed into gods, under the names  of Hermes, Mercury, Apollo; the stings of conscience were called the  Furies: the people, bowed down in stupid ignorance, had no eyes but  for these emblematical persons, under which nature was masked: they  attributed to their influence the good, to their displeasure the evil,  which they experienced: they entered into every "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8911"],[0,"Explorations in Australia (#9)"],[1,"and low scrub. Saw a number of kangaroos, but they were  too wild to get near them. Distance to-day, twenty miles.    Tuesday, 3rd August, Good Country. It has rained during the whole night,  and is likely to do so to-day. Started at 9, on the same course as  yesterday, 230 degrees. The first portion of our journey was over six  miles of splendid alluvial country, covered with grass--partly spear  grass--with a little salt bush intermixed with it, also a few mulga  bushes at intervals; no other timber. It is a most beautiful open piece  of country, and looks much better than the Adelaide plains did at the  commencement of the colony. Four miles further it was not so good; the  soil became a little lighter, with more salt bush, and a little scrub.  The last eleven miles the soil is good, with grass and salt bush in  abundance, but much thicker with mulga and other low scrubs. It seems to  be a continuation of the same scrub that we passed over on the 19th  ultimo, and I observe that the ants build their habitations in the same  style as they did there. They are about one foot in diameter at the base,  and formed in the shape of a cone, and are supported by the dead root of  a mulga. Others, however, stand from eighteen inches to three feet in  height, built of clay, and on the surface. The kangaroo and emu inhabit  the country. We have also found a number of places where the natives have  been encamped. They seem to be numerous, judging from the number of  places where they have had their fires; but we have not seen any of them.  We have had it raining nearly all day, and it still looks bad. Our black  fellow left us during the night; he seemed to be very much frightened of  the other natives. He knows nothing of the country, and if he follows our  tracks back, I don't envy him his walk. He was of very little use to us,  and I wish I had sent him off before, but I thought he might be useful in  conversing with the other natives when we should meet them. He was of no  other use than for tracking and assisting in getting the horses in the  morning, for I have given them every advantage--they have been seldom  hobbled. There are three small valleys on our line in which water seems  to have run at some former period. We have crossed no course of rocks of  any description since our northern line; from which I am of opinion that  the drainage is underneath, so that there ought to be numerous springs  near the sea-coast. Camped without water. Distance to-day, twenty miles.    Wednesday, 4th August, Scrubby Good Country. Started at 8 on the same  bearing as yesterday, 230 degrees. At thirteen miles ascended a low red  granite range in which there is water. Changed our bearing to 209 degrees  to a hill on the opposite range; when I returned I found the grey mare so  done up that she is unable to proceed. I should not like to leave her,  but I cannot delay longer with her. For about half a mile under the range  where we are now camped is beautiful feed up to the horses' knees. Six  cockatoos passed over to another range. We have also found a small  running stream where I shall leave the mare to-morrow; I will make an  attempt to regain her as I return.    Thursday, 5th August, Granite Range. Started at 8 on the same bearing for  the hill on the opposite range. At six miles another low granite range  with water, where we left the mare. At twelve miles went to the highest  point of the range composed of hard flinty quartz and ironstone. We had a  good view of the surrounding country, which was generally low and  undulating, with salt lakes crossing at about ten miles. This region  appears to be dotted with the lagoons from nearly the foot of the range.  Changed our bearing to 268 degrees for nine miles. Camped under a range  of low hills with good feed for the horses. On our west course we crossed  a plain of red light soil, with abundance of grass and a little salt bush  with a very thick scrub close to the range, but as we advanced it became  more open, and the scrub lower. Shot a wallaby and had him for supper.  Distance to-day, twenty-five miles.    Friday, 6th August, Under the Low Range. Left at 8.30 a.m. on a bearing  of 239 degrees to avoid the stones on the hills. At five miles and a half  got some rain water; at nine miles changed our bearing to 255 degrees; at  fifteen miles camped among the sand hills. Shot another wallaby. The  timber about here is very large, consisting of black oaks, mallee, mulga,  the native peach, the nut, and numerous low scrubs. The grass is good in  some places. The mountain that I am steering for is further off than I  anticipated; we got sight of it a short time before we halted; it seems  to be very high, and I expect something good will be the result of our  visit to it to-morrow. The hills that we were camped under last night are  composed of quartz, and are connected with the range that we were on  running to the south-west. Distance to-day, twenty six miles.    Saturday, 7th August, Sand Hills going to the High Mount. Left at 8.30  a.m. on the same bearing, 255 degrees, for eighteen miles to the foot of  the mountain. At fifteen miles camped under the highest point, which is  composed of quartz rock. The journey to-day has been through horrid dense  scrub and heavy sand hills, to the foot of the hill, which I have named  Mount Finke. It is as high as Mount Arden; I have not light to get on the  top of it to-night. Very little rain has fallen here, and we have been  without water for the last two nights: the country is of such a light  sandy soil that it will not retain it. I almost give up hopes of a good  country; this is very disheartening after all that I have done to find  it. If I see nothing from the top of the mount to-morrow, I must turn  down to Fowler's Bay for water for the horses. As I could not remain  quiet, I got on one of the lower spurs of Mount Finke to see what was  before me. The prospect is gloomy in the extreme! I could see a long  distance, but nothing met the eye save A DENSE SCRUB AS BLACK AND DISMAL  AS MIDNIGHT. On my return I found that Forster had succeeded in finding  water by digging in the creek. Distance to-day, twenty miles.    Sunday, 8th August, Mount Finke. At dawn of day I ascended the mountain,  but was unable to see much more than I did last night, in consequence of  there being a mist all round. No high rising ground is to be seen in any  direction. A FEARFUL COUNTRY. Left the mount at 9.30 a.m. on a bearing of  270 degrees. At eighteen miles halted to give the horses some food, as  they were obliged to be tied up all last night, there not being any feed  for them, and the scrub very dense. The horse Blower seems to be very  unwell; he has lain down twice this morning, and an hour's rest will do  him good. After leaving the mount we have a thick mallee and mulga scrub  to go through with spinifex. At ten miles changed our bearing to 190  degrees; at eight miles camped. The whole of our journey to day has been  through a dreadful desert of sand hills and spinifex. In the last eight  miles we have not seen a mouthful for the horses to eat and not a drop of  water; it is even WORSE than Captain Sturt's desert, where there was a  little salt bush; but here there is not a vestige. Distance to-day,  twenty-five miles.    Monday, 9th August, Desert. Started at 8.30 on the same bearing, 190  degrees. At five miles there is a change in the country; the spinifex has  suddenly ceased and low scrub taken its place; the sand ridges are spread  and the valley wider. At seven miles discovered some rock water in the  middle of a valley with plenty of salt bush and green grass, first rate  for the horses, which have had nothing to eat for two nights. I shall  give them the rest of the day to recover. They were beginning to be very  much done up, and it was with difficulty we could get them to face the  spinifex. Shot a pigeon and had him for supper. We have seen where a  horse has been a long time ago. Distance to-day, seven miles.    Tuesday, 10th August, Rock Water. Started at 8.30 on a bearing of 180  degrees. Camped at eighteen miles without water, and a very little food  for the horses, only a little salt bush. The appearance of a change from  the dreary desert lasted only for about one mile from where we camped  last night; it then became even worse than before--the sand hills higher,  steeper and closer together, the spinifex thicker and higher; we got the  horses through it with difficulty. It rained all last night and all day.  There is some rising ground to the west. Distance to-day, eighteen miles.    Wednesday, 11th August, Dense Scrub. Left our camp at 8 on the same  bearing, 180 degrees. At 9 obliged to halt for the remainder of the day,  the horses being too tired to proceed further; the fearful sand hills are  very trying for them. To-day's few miles have been through the same  DREARY, DREADFUL, DISMAL DESERT of heavy sand hills and spinifex with  mallee very dense, scarcely a mouthful for the horses to eat. When will  it have an end? We again saw the rising ground a little to the north of  west of us; I should have gone and examined it, but our small remaining  quantity of provisions being nearly exhausted, I could not venture; my  object now being to make Fowler's Bay for water for our horses, and  thence to Streaky Bay, to endeavour to get some provisions there to carry  us home. We have now travelled considerably upwards of a thousand miles,  and in that journey my horses have had only four clear days to  themselves; they have done most excellently well. No water.    Thursday, 12th August. Dense Scrub. Left at 8.25 on a bearing of 165  degrees. Camped at ten miles; the horses done up. The same dreary desert.  No water.    Friday, 13th August. Dense Scrub. The horses look very bad this morning.  I hope we shall be able to make the sea-coast to-day. Started at 8.30 on  the same bearing, 165 degrees, but was unable to get more than "]]]
