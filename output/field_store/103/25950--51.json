Their shining bolos began to turn red. I  estimated that Col. Volckmann's northern Luzon guerrillas accomplished  the purposes of practically a front line division.\"    (Still nine months later, these same guerrillas helped Col. Volckmann  at Kiangan-both defeat and capture Japan's distinguished General  Tomoyuki Yamashita, the \"Tiger of Malaya.\" The Tiger was quite amazed  and chagrined to find his veteran troops both surrounded and beaten by  guerrillas in the northern Mountain Province.    On September 2, 1945, General Yamashita surrendered to Col. Volckmann  at Kianhgan. The following day, Sept. 3rd, he surrendered to General  Wainwright at the High Commissioner's mansion at Camp John Hay, ending  World War II in the Philippine Islands. Yamashita was then taken to  Bilibid Prison    in Manila to await war crime trials.    In December, 1941, some of the newly recruited Filipino soldiers  '\"broke and ran\" for the mountains when the big guns were fired from  the cruisers and destroyers in Lingayen Bay, but in 1945, these same  Filipinos were ideally suited for guerrilla warfare; they thoroughly  enjoyed twisting the \"Tail of the Tiger.\" \"This was their kind of  war!\" Actually Japan never conquered the Philippine Islands, nor did  they ever gain the friendship of the Filipinos.    The Nipponese merely occupied some of the larger cities and controlled  the main roads for three years, during which time they established  much ill-will of the Filipinos, only serving to strengthen the  resistance movements. Who could have ever dreamed that World War II in  the Philippines would both begin and end at Camp John Hay, a Rest and  Recreation Center?    Captives on the Move - July 20, 1942: Six of us the American captives,  guests of the Japanese cavalry squadron stationed in Echague  Constabulary Barracks in Isabella were placed aboard a charcoal  burning truck, with a half dozen Jap guards, bound for an internment  camp.    When we reached Bambang, our truck stopped to pick up a junior  Japanese officer, who was being transferred to another area. The Nips  wanted to give him a big send-off; they had gathered and instructed a  group of Filipino children to express their great fondness for the  officer by waving Japanese flags, by shouting: \"Banzai, Banzai,  Banzai!\" and by presenting the officer with a small bouquet.    The performance was quite dull, until one of the children discovered  the Americans in the back of the truck. The little faces brightened  and broke into smiles; \"V\" signs began to appear, followed by a chorus  of \"Hello, Joe! Hello, Joe! Hello, Joe; Mabuhay, Joe!\" The Japs were  plenty irked and hurried the truck down the highway.    In the early afternoon we passed through the barrio where we had  encountered the Japanese Chevy and tanks seven months before. Shortly  we passed through San Jose and on to the central plains.    About one mile before reaching the internment camp at Cabanatuan, we  suddenly became aware of a horrible, acrid stench, the smell of  disease, dysentery and death.                                  Chapter V                JAPANESE PRISONER OF WAR CAMP NO1, CABANATUAN      Toward evening we arrived at the gate-made of slender poles and barbed  wire-which I immediately recognized as one of the camps built prior to  the war to house a division of the Philippine Army. It was located on  several hundred acres of treeless wasteland (formerly rice paddies)  near the foothills of the Sierra Madre Mountains. It consisted of some  one hundred cantonment type barracks with walls of nipa and roofs of  swali and cogan grass.    Within the barbed wire enclosure, many of the seven thousand  half-naked, starved bodies, the \"captives,\" slowly milled about camp.  In the several guard towers along the fence, sentries closely  scrutinized their movements. The arrival of our old truck and its  handful of new captives were scarcely noted in camp.    I made my \"duty calls\" on Col. D. J. Rutherford, C.A.C.,    Camp Commander, on Lt. Col. Leo Pacquet, Group II Commander, and Col.  Gillespie, Medical C. O. Group II Dispensary proved to be a small,  twenty by twenty foot grass shack. In one corner was my two-by six  foot bamboo slat bed for the next several months.    Although my weight was down from 165 to 120 pounds because of amoebic  dysentery, I was still relatively active and in fair health. How lucky  I had been to have missed the starvation, the many diseases, the  battles and bombings on Bataan and Corregidor, and most of all, the  \"Death March,\" which had taken so many thousands of lives,  \"slaughtered by the Japs.\"    \"Thank you God!\" became my frequent and fervent prayer.    Shortages: The first shortage of which I became aware was water. The  deep well in camp required diesel fuel or coconut oil to run the  engine-to pump the water to a central water tower, from which it went  to one outlet in each group and each mess hall, and several outlets in  the hospital. Since fuel was always in short supply, there was usually  a shortage of water. By standing in line for an hour, I obtained my  first canteen of water (which could only be used for drinking). Baths  were obtained by standing under the eaves on rainy days. Fortunately  the rainy season was beginning.    Chow: The evening meal was my introduction to the diet. I had been  warned that I would only need my canteen cup for dinner. After waiting  in a long line, I received one half cup of lugao (a thin watery rice  soup) and some foul tasting greens, a very skimpy meal compared to  those I enjoyed with the guerrillas chicken, eggs, pork, fruits, and  vegetables.    As the days went by, the diet did not improve just lugao and greens  day after day. On a rare occasion a small amount of mongo beans or  corn might be added.    About once a month, a carabao (water buffalo) was killed and added to  the soup for from 6,000 to 12,000 captives, after the Japs had removed  all of the choice cuts. We believed ourselves lucky when we could find  a shred or two of meat in the soup.    Our captors reasoned that slow starvation would make us too weak to  resist authority or to attempt to escape. To further insure our  servility, the Japanese divided us into groups of ten \"blood  brothers.\" If one attempted to escape, the other nine would be  severely punished. Recaptured escapees were paraded around camp by  American guards for twenty four hours and then used for bayonet  practice by the trainees and Koreans.    First Night: During the first night in camp, I spent several hours  walking under the stars, just thinking. Life had been much better with  the guerrillas; I was free to go many places not occupied by the Japs.  I ate much better.    But what was done was done! There was no question that the captives in  Cabanatuan P.O.W. Camp needed all of the medical care I could give  them. From that point of view, I reasoned that I was in the right  place.        .    I wondered if Judy could see the same stars that I could the hunter  and his two dogs, and the Southern Cross. When we lived in Garden  Court (near Nichol's Air Field), we used to delight in watching the  moon and the stars shimmering in Manila Bay. It seemed a lifetime ago.    Apparitions: The next morning, some three hundred pathetic,  skeletonized human beings, Americans, lined up in front of Group II  Dispensary, all hoping for miracles. Several of the patients  recognized me from Manila, where I had treated them at Sternberg Army  Hospital, or the dispensaries of the 57th Infantry Regiment, or the  14th Engineer Regiment at Fort McKinley.    With their shaven heads and their considerable weight losses, I had  great difficulty in recognizing them. These were the pitiful survivors  from Bataan and Corregidor, the \"Battling Bastards of    Bataan,\" and the remnants of the \"Death March.\" One by one I listened  to their stories and tried to help them.    Since there was very little medicine to give out, most of the therapy  had to be improvised. Those with dysentery were told to take a  teaspoon of charcoal from the mess hall stoves after each meal, and to  sleep on the right side so not to irritate the sigmoid colon. They  were to wash their hands after each trip to the latrine in spite of  water shortages.    Malaria patients were given one quinine tablet after each chill hoping  to alleviate symptoms. There was never enough to attempt a cure.    Both \"wet\" and \"dry\" beriberi cases were prevalent. There were no  vitamins to treat them. We tried to make yeast cultures; the process  was too slow, and we could never see that the cultures did any good.  Hundreds of beriberi cases died each month.    Scurvy came on suddenly in large numbers of captives several times  each year. When we could persuade the Japs to obtain a lime or two for  each captive, the cures were remarkable.    Nightly Toll: Each day we transferred the most seriously ill patients  to the hospital, where there were small amounts of extra food. In  spite of the daily transfers, each night several captives died in the  barracks. Many of the captives refused to go to the hospital seeing it  as the last stop before death.    Mess Halls: There were eleven mess halls in camp-each with one or two  large concrete stoves at one end. Large iron caldrons held the rice or  soup to be cooked. During the rainy season, there were serious  problems getting the wood to burn.    It often appeared that the mess crews were better fed than other  captives. The daily diet consisted of two hundred to four hundred  grams of a poor grade of rice, containing fine gravel and insects,  about one hundred grams of weeds (from carabao wallows), and, on a  rare occasion, ten grams of \"one\" of the following: sugar, coconut  oil, beans, camote (sweet potato), corn, or meat. The diet was usually  below eight-hundred calories daily, of which protein and fat were less"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8452"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 363, December 16, 1882 (#9)"],[1,"existence in a far Western  State with so much celerity, the phenomenon would not be considered  remarkable, perhaps; but growths of this kind are not indigenous to the  New England of the present era. Gilbertville has probably outstripped  all New England villages in the race of the past three years. It is only  one of the signs that old Maine is not dead yet.    Gilbert Brothers erected a saw mill here three years ago. A year later,  the Denison Paper Manufacturing Company, of Mechanic Falls, erected a  big pulp mill, which, also, the town voted to exempt from taxation for  ten years. The mills are valuable companions for each other. The pulp  mill utilizes all the waste of the saw mill. A settlement was speedily  built by the operatives. Gilbertville now boasts of a post-office, a  store, several large boarding houses, a nice school house, and over 500  inhabitants. The pulp mill employs seventy men. It runs night and day.  It manufactures monthly 350 cords of poplar and spruce into pulp. It  consumes monthly 500 cords of wood for fuel, 45 casks of soda ash,  valued at $45 per cask, nine car loads of lime, 24,000 pounds to the  car. It produces 1,000,000 pounds of wet fiber, valued at about $17,000,  monthly. The pay roll amounts to $3,500 per month.    The larger part of the stock used by the mill consists of poplar logs  floated down the Androscoggin and its tributaries. One thousand two  hundred cords of poplar cut in four-foot lengths are piled about the  mill; and a little further up the river are 5,000 cords more. The logs  are hauled from the river and sawed into lengths by a donkey engine,  which cuts about sixty cords per day, and pulls out fourteen logs at  a time. All the spruce slabs made by the saw mill are used with this  poplar. The wood is fed to a wheel armed with many sharp knives. It  devours a cord of wood every fifteen minutes. The four-foot sticks are  chewed into fine chips as rapidly as they can be thrust into the maw of  the chopper. They are carried directly from this machine to the top of  the mill by an endless belt with pockets attached. There are hatchways  in the attic floor, which open upon rotary iron boilers. Into these  boilers the chips are raked, and a solution of lime and soda ash is  poured over them.    This bath destroys all the resinous matter in the wood, and after  cooking five hours the chips are reduced to a mass of soft black pulp.  Each rotary will contain two cords of chips. After the cooking, the pulp  is dumped into iron tanks in the basement, where it is thoroughly washed  with streams of clean cold water. It is then pumped into a machine which  rolls it into broad sheets. These sheets are folded, and condensed by  a hydraulic press of 200 tons pressure. This process reduces its bulk  fifty per cent., and sends profuse jets of water flying out of it. The  soda ash, in which, mixed with lime and water, the chips are cooked, is  reclaimed, and used over and over again. The liquor, after it has been  used, is pumped into tanks on top of large brick furnaces. As it is  heated, it thickens. It is brought nearer and nearer the fire until it  crystallizes, and finally burns into an ash. Eighty per cent. of the ash  used is thus reclaimed. This process is an immense saving to the pulp  manufacturers. The work in the pulp mill is severe, and is slightly  tinged with danger.    Three thousand four hundred pounds of white ash to 2,100 pounds of lime  are the proportions in which the liquor in each vat is mixed. One does  not envy the lot of the stout fellows who crawl into the great rotaries  to stow away the chips. The hurry of business is so great that they  cannot wait for these boilers to cool naturally, after they have cooked  one batch, before putting in another. So they have a fan pump, to which  is attached a canvas hose, and with this blow cooling air currents into  the boiler, or \"rotary,\" as they call it. The rotary is subjected to an  immense pressure, and is very stoutly made of thick iron plates, bolted  together.    Describing the business as carried on at Mechanic Falls, the same paper  says: There are six of these mills on the three dams over which the  Little Androscoggin falls. These are the Eagle, the Star, the Diamond,  the Union, the pulp, and the super calendering mills. The Eagle and the  Star mills run on book papers of various grades. The Union mill runs on  newspaper. The old Diamond mill now prepares pulp stock. The pulp mill  does nothing but bleach the rag pulp and prepare for the machines in the  other mills; while the super-calendering mill gives the paper an extra  finish when ordered. There is practically but one series of processes by  which the paper is made in the various mills.    It is a curious fact that America is not ragged enough to produce the  requisite amount of stock for its own paper mills. Nearly all the rags  used by the Denison Mills (and by others in various parts of the country  as well) are imported from the old countries. All the rags first go  through the \"duster.\" This is a big cylindrical shell of coarse wire  netting. It is rapidly revolved, while a screw running through its  center is turned in the opposite direction. Air currents are forced  through it by a power fan. The rags are continuously fed into one end of  this shell, which is about ten feet long and four feet in diameter. The  screw forces them through the whole length of the shell, while they are  kept buzzing around and subjected to breezes which blow thick clouds of  dirt and dust out of them. The air of the room is thick with European  and Asiatic earth. It is swept up in great rolls on the floor. The man  who operates the duster should have leather lungs.    Overhead is a long room where thirty girls are busily sorting the rags  for the various grades of papers. That the dusting machine is no more  perfect than a human machine is evinced by the murky atmosphere of this  room, by the particles that lodge in the throat of the visitor, and  by the frequent coughing of the sorters. They protect their hair with  turbans of veiling, occasionally decorated with a bit of bright color.  These turbans give the room the appearance of an industrious Turkish  harem. Short, sharp scythe blades, like Turkish scimeters, gleam above  all the girls' benches. When a sorter wishes to cut a rag, she pulls it  across the edge of this blade, and is not obliged to hunt for a pair of  shears.    Curious discoveries are frequently made in the rags. Old pockets,  containing small sums of money, are occasionally found. A foreign coin  valued at about $3 was found a few days ago. In the paper stock, quaint  and valuable old books or pictures are found often. One of the workmen  has a museum composed of curiosities found amid the rags and shreds of  paper. Rev. Dr. Bolles, of Massachusetts, makes an annual pilgrimage  to Mechanic Falls for the sake of the rare old pamphlets, books, and  engravings that he may dig out.    Stuffed in hogsheads, the rags are lowered from this room through  a hatchway, and are given a red hot lime bath. They are placed in  ponderous cylinders of boiler iron, which revolve horizontally in great  gears high above the floor. A mixture of lime and water, which has been  prepared in large brick vats, is poured over them. An iron door, secured  by huge bolts, is closed on them. The cylinder slowly turns around, and  churns the rags in the lime-juice twelve hours. This process is called  bleaching. When the rags come out they are far from white, however. They  are of a uniform dirty brown hue. But the colors have lost their gripe.  When the rags shall have been submitted to the grinding and washing in  pure water, as we shall see them presently, they are easily whitened.  The lime bath is the purgatory of the paper stock.    Before we go any further, we must see what becomes of those soft  and lop-sided bundles which are going into the mills. These contain  chemically prepared wood fiber, a certain percentage of which is used  in nearly all the papers made now. It gives the paper a greater body,  although its fiber is not so strong as that made of rags. The pulp comes  down from Canton in soft brown sheets. These are at once bleached. The  brown fiber is placed in a bath of cold water and chlorate of lime.  There it quietly rests till a sediment settles at the bottom of the  tank. At an opportune moment the workman pours in a copious libation  of boiling water. This causes the escape of the chlorine gas, which  destroys all the color in the pulp. In half an hour it comes out, a mass  of smoking fibers as white as a snow heap. The drainers into which it  goes are large pens with perforated tile floors. The pulp remains in the  drainers till it so dry it is handled with a pitchfork.    We are now ready to look at the beating machines, which have to perform  a very important part in paper making. These are large iron tanks with  powerful grinders revolving in them. Barrow loads of the brown rags are  dumped into them, and clear cold water is poured in. The grinders are  then started. They chew the rags into fine bits. They keep the mass  of rags and water circulating incessantly in the tanks. Clean water  constantly flows in and dirty water as constantly flows out. In the  course of six hours the rags are reduced to a perfectly white pulpy  mass. There is one mill, as we have said, devoted exclusively to the  reduction of rags to this white pulp. It is dried in drainers such as we  saw a few moments ago filled with the wood fiber.    There are other beating machines just like these, which perform a  slightly different service. Their function may be compared to that of an  apothecary's mortar or a cook's mixing dish. The white rag stock and the  white wood fiber are mixed in these, in the required proportions.  At this stage, the pulp is adulterated with China clay, to give it  substance and weight; here the sizing (composed of resin and sal soda)"]]]
