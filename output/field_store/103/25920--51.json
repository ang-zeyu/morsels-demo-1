'I have seen it very cruel to some of  our men. I have seen it tear a boat as big as our house, all to pieces.'    'I hope it wasn't the boat that--'    'That father was drownded in?' said Em'ly. 'No. Not that one, I never  see that boat.'    'Nor him?' I asked her.    Little Em'ly shook her head. 'Not to remember!'    Here was a coincidence! I immediately went into an explanation how I had  never seen my own father; and how my mother and I had always lived  by ourselves in the happiest state imaginable, and lived so then, and  always meant to live so; and how my father's grave was in the churchyard  near our house, and shaded by a tree, beneath the boughs of which I had  walked and heard the birds sing many a pleasant morning. But there were  some differences between Em'ly's orphanhood and mine, it appeared. She  had lost her mother before her father; and where her father's grave was  no one knew, except that it was somewhere in the depths of the sea.    'Besides,' said Em'ly, as she looked about for shells and pebbles, 'your  father was a gentleman and your mother is a lady; and my father was a  fisherman and my mother was a fisherman's daughter, and my uncle Dan is  a fisherman.'    'Dan is Mr. Peggotty, is he?' said I.    'Uncle Dan--yonder,' answered Em'ly, nodding at the boat-house.    'Yes. I mean him. He must be very good, I should think?'    'Good?' said Em'ly. 'If I was ever to be a lady, I'd give him a sky-blue  coat with diamond buttons, nankeen trousers, a red velvet waistcoat, a  cocked hat, a large gold watch, a silver pipe, and a box of money.'    I said I had no doubt that Mr. Peggotty well deserved these treasures.  I must acknowledge that I felt it difficult to picture him quite at his  ease in the raiment proposed for him by his grateful little niece, and  that I was particularly doubtful of the policy of the cocked hat; but I  kept these sentiments to myself.    Little Em'ly had stopped and looked up at the sky in her enumeration  of these articles, as if they were a glorious vision. We went on again,  picking up shells and pebbles.    'You would like to be a lady?' I said.    Emily looked at me, and laughed and nodded 'yes'.    'I should like it very much. We would all be gentlefolks together, then.  Me, and uncle, and Ham, and Mrs. Gummidge. We wouldn't mind then, when  there comes stormy weather.---Not for our own sakes, I mean. We would  for the poor fishermen's, to be sure, and we'd help 'em with money when  they come to any hurt.' This seemed to me to be a very satisfactory and  therefore not at all improbable picture. I expressed my pleasure in the  contemplation of it, and little Em'ly was emboldened to say, shyly,    'Don't you think you are afraid of the sea, now?'    It was quiet enough to reassure me, but I have no doubt if I had seen a  moderately large wave come tumbling in, I should have taken to my heels,  with an awful recollection of her drowned relations. However, I said  'No,' and I added, 'You don't seem to be either, though you say you  are,'--for she was walking much too near the brink of a sort of old  jetty or wooden causeway we had strolled upon, and I was afraid of her  falling over.    'I'm not afraid in this way,' said little Em'ly. 'But I wake when it  blows, and tremble to think of Uncle Dan and Ham and believe I hear 'em  crying out for help. That's why I should like so much to be a lady. But  I'm not afraid in this way. Not a bit. Look here!'    She started from my side, and ran along a jagged timber which protruded  from the place we stood upon, and overhung the deep water at some  height, without the least defence. The incident is so impressed on my  remembrance, that if I were a draughtsman I could draw its form here,  I dare say, accurately as it was that day, and little Em'ly springing  forward to her destruction (as it appeared to me), with a look that I  have never forgotten, directed far out to sea.    The light, bold, fluttering little figure turned and came back safe  to me, and I soon laughed at my fears, and at the cry I had uttered;  fruitlessly in any case, for there was no one near. But there have been  times since, in my manhood, many times there have been, when I have  thought, Is it possible, among the possibilities of hidden things, that  in the sudden rashness of the child and her wild look so far off, there  was any merciful attraction of her into danger, any tempting her towards  him permitted on the part of her dead father, that her life might have  a chance of ending that day? There has been a time since when I have  wondered whether, if the life before her could have been revealed to me  at a glance, and so revealed as that a child could fully comprehend it,  and if her preservation could have depended on a motion of my hand, I  ought to have held it up to save her. There has been a time since--I do  not say it lasted long, but it has been--when I have asked myself the  question, would it have been better for little Em'ly to have had the  waters close above her head that morning in my sight; and when I have  answered Yes, it would have been.    This may be premature. I have set it down too soon, perhaps. But let it  stand.    We strolled a long way, and loaded ourselves with things that we thought  curious, and put some stranded starfish carefully back into the water--I  hardly know enough of the race at this moment to be quite certain  whether they had reason to feel obliged to us for doing so, or the  reverse--and then made our way home to Mr. Peggotty's dwelling. We  stopped under the lee of the lobster-outhouse to exchange an innocent  kiss, and went in to breakfast glowing with health and pleasure.    'Like two young mavishes,' Mr. Peggotty said. I knew this meant, in our  local dialect, like two young thrushes, and received it as a compliment.    Of course I was in love with little Em'ly. I am sure I loved that  baby quite as truly, quite as tenderly, with greater purity and more  disinterestedness, than can enter into the best love of a later time  of life, high and ennobling as it is. I am sure my fancy raised up  something round that blue-eyed mite of a child, which etherealized,  and made a very angel of her. If, any sunny forenoon, she had spread  a little pair of wings and flown away before my eyes, I don't think I  should have regarded it as much more than I had had reason to expect.    We used to walk about that dim old flat at Yarmouth in a loving manner,  hours and hours. The days sported by us, as if Time had not grown up  himself yet, but were a child too, and always at play. I told Em'ly  I adored her, and that unless she confessed she adored me I should be  reduced to the necessity of killing myself with a sword. She said she  did, and I have no doubt she did.    As to any sense of inequality, or youthfulness, or other difficulty  in our way, little Em'ly and I had no such trouble, because we had no  future. We made no more provision for growing older, than we did for  growing younger. We were the admiration of Mrs. Gummidge and Peggotty,  who used to whisper of an evening when we sat, lovingly, on our little  locker side by side, 'Lor! wasn't it beautiful!' Mr. Peggotty smiled at  us from behind his pipe, and Ham grinned all the evening and did nothing  else. They had something of the sort of pleasure in us, I suppose, that  they might have had in a pretty toy, or a pocket model of the Colosseum.    I soon found out that Mrs. Gummidge did not always make herself so  agreeable as she might have been expected to do, under the circumstances  of her residence with Mr. Peggotty. Mrs. Gummidge's was rather a fretful  disposition, and she whimpered more sometimes than was comfortable for  other parties in so small an establishment. I was very sorry for  her; but there were moments when it would have been more agreeable, I  thought, if Mrs. Gummidge had had a convenient apartment of her own to  retire to, and had stopped there until her spirits revived.    Mr. Peggotty went occasionally to a public-house called The Willing  Mind. I discovered this, by his being out on the second or third evening  of our visit, and by Mrs. Gummidge's looking up at the Dutch clock,  between eight and nine, and saying he was there, and that, what was  more, she had known in the morning he would go there.    Mrs. Gummidge had been in a low state all day, and had burst into tears  in the forenoon, when the fire smoked. 'I am a lone lorn creetur',' were  Mrs. Gummidge's words, when that unpleasant occurrence took place, 'and  everythink goes contrary with me.'    'Oh, it'll soon leave off,' said Peggotty--I again mean our  Peggotty--'and besides, you know, it's not more disagreeable to you than  to us.'    'I feel it more,' said Mrs. Gummidge.    It was a very cold day, with cutting blasts of wind. Mrs. Gummidge's  peculiar corner of the fireside seemed to me to be the warmest and  snuggest in the place, as her chair was certainly the easiest, but it  didn't suit her that day at all. She was constantly complaining of the  cold, and of its occasioning a visitation in her back which she called  'the creeps'. At last she shed tears on that subject, and said again  that she was 'a lone lorn creetur' and everythink went contrary with  her'.    'It is certainly very cold,' said Peggotty. 'Everybody must feel it so.'    'I feel it more than other people,' said Mrs. Gummidge.    So at dinner; when Mrs. Gummidge was always helped immediately after me,  to whom the preference was given as a visitor of distinction. The  fish were small and bony, and the potatoes were a little burnt. We all  acknowledged that we felt this something of a disappointment; but Mrs.  Gummidge said she felt it more than we did, and shed tears again, and  made that former declaration with great bitterness.    Accordingly, when Mr. Peggotty came home about nine o'clock, this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/770"],[0,"The Story of the Treasure Seekers (#9)"],[1,"we  wish for it,' said Noel.    The little girl looked at him very queerly, and said, 'That is out of a  picture-book.'    Then Noel said he thought it was about time he was married if we were to  be home in time for tea. The little girl was rather stupid over it,  but she did what we told her, and we married them with Dora's  pocket-handkerchief for a veil, and the ring off the back of one of the  buttons on H. O.'s blouse just went on her little finger.    Then we showed her how to play cross-touch, and puss in the corner,  and tag. It was funny, she didn't know any games but battledore and  shuttlecock and les graces. But she really began to laugh at last and  not to look quite so like a doll.    She was Puss and was running after Dicky when suddenly she stopped short  and looked as if she was going to cry. And we looked too, and there were  two prim ladies with little mouths and tight hair. One of them said in  quite an awful voice, 'Pauline, who are these children?' and her voice  was gruff; with very curly R's.    The little girl said we were Princes and Princesses--which was silly, to  a grown-up person that is not a great friend of yours.    The gruff lady gave a short, horrid laugh, like a husky bark, and said--    'Princes, indeed! They're only common children!'    Dora turned very red and began to speak, but the little girl cried out  'Common children! Oh, I am so glad! When I am grown up I'll always play  with common children.'    And she ran at us, and began to kiss us one by one, beginning  with Alice; she had got to H. O. when the horrid lady said--'Your  Highness--go indoors at once!'    The little girl answered, 'I won't!'    Then the prim lady said--'Wilson, carry her Highness indoors.'    And the little girl was carried away screaming, and kicking with her  little thin legs and her buttoned boots, and between her screams she  shrieked:    'Common children! I am glad, glad, glad! Common children! Common  children!'    The nasty lady then remarked--'Go at once, or I will send for the  police!'    So we went. H. O. made a face at her and so did Alice, but Oswald took  off his cap and said he was sorry if she was annoyed about anything;  for Oswald has always been taught to be polite to ladies, however nasty.  Dicky took his off, too, when he saw me do it; he says he did it first,  but that is a mistake. If I were really a common boy I should say it was  a lie.    Then we all came away, and when we got outside Dora said, 'So she was  really a Princess. Fancy a Princess living _there_!'    'Even Princesses have to live somewhere,' said Dicky.    'And I thought it was play. And it was real. I wish I'd known! I should  have liked to ask her lots of things,' said Alice.    H. O. said he would have liked to ask her what she had for dinner and  whether she had a crown.    I felt, myself, we had lost a chance of finding out a great deal about  kings and queens. I might have known such a stupid-looking little girl  would never have been able to pretend, as well as that.    So we all went home across the Heath, and made dripping toast for tea.    When we were eating it Noel said, 'I wish I could give _her_ some! It is  very good.'    He sighed as he said it, and his mouth was very full, so we knew he was  thinking of his Princess. He says now that she was as beautiful as the  day, but we remember her quite well, and she was nothing of the kind.        CHAPTER 7. BEING BANDITS    Noel was quite tiresome for ever so long after we found the Princess. He  would keep on wanting to go to the Park when the rest of us didn't, and  though we went several times to please him, we never found that door  open again, and all of us except him knew from the first that it would  be no go.    So now we thought it was time to do something to rouse him from the  stupor of despair, which is always done to heroes when anything baffling  has occurred. Besides, we were getting very short of money again--the  fortunes of your house cannot be restored (not so that they will last,  that is), even by the one pound eight we got when we had the 'good  hunting.' We spent a good deal of that on presents for Father's  birthday. We got him a paper-weight, like a glass bun, with a picture  of Lewisham Church at the bottom; and a blotting-pad, and a box of  preserved fruits, and an ivory penholder with a view of Greenwich  Park in the little hole where you look through at the top. He was most  awfully pleased and surprised, and when he heard how Noel and Oswald had  earned the money to buy the things he was more surprised still. Nearly  all the rest of our money went to get fireworks for the Fifth of  November. We got six Catherine wheels and four rockets; two hand-lights,  one red and one green; a sixpenny maroon; two Roman-candles--they cost  a shilling; some Italian streamers, a fairy fountain, and a tourbillon  that cost eighteen-pence and was very nearly worth it.    But I think crackers and squibs are a mistake. It's true you get a lot  of them for the money, and they are not bad fun for the first two or  three dozen, but you get jolly sick of them before you've let off your  sixpenn'orth. And the only amusing way is not allowed: it is putting  them in the fire.    It always seems a long time till the evening when you have got fireworks  in the house, and I think as it was a rather foggy day we should have  decided to let them off directly after breakfast, only Father had said  he would help us to let them off at eight o'clock after he had had his  dinner, and you ought never to disappoint your father if you can help  it.    You see we had three good reasons for trying H. O.'s idea of restoring  the fallen fortunes of our house by becoming bandits on the Fifth of  November. We had a fourth reason as well, and that was the best reason  of the lot. You remember Dora thought it would be wrong to be bandits.  And the Fifth of November came while Dora was away at Stroud staying  with her godmother. Stroud is in Gloucestershire. We were determined to  do it while she was out of the way, because we did not think it wrong,  and besides we meant to do it anyhow.    We held a Council, of course, and laid our plans very carefully. We let  H. O. be Captain, because it was his idea. Oswald was Lieutenant. Oswald  was quite fair, because he let H. O. call himself Captain; but Oswald is  the eldest next to Dora, after all.    Our plan was this. We were all to go up on to the Heath. Our house is in  the Lewisham Road, but it's quite close to the Heath if you cut up the  short way opposite the confectioner's, past the nursery gardens and  the cottage hospital, and turn to the left again and afterwards to the  right. You come out then at the top of the hill, where the big guns are  with the iron fence round them, and where the bands play on Thursday  evenings in the summer.    We were to lurk in ambush there, and waylay an unwary traveller. We were  to call upon him to surrender his arms, and then bring him home and put  him in the deepest dungeon below the castle moat; then we were to load  him with chains and send to his friends for ransom.    You may think we had no chains, but you are wrong, because we used  to keep two other dogs once, besides Pincher, before the fall of the  fortunes of the ancient House of Bastable. And they were quite big dogs.    It was latish in the afternoon before we started. We thought we could  lurk better if it was nearly dark. It was rather foggy, and we waited  a good while beside the railings, but all the belated travellers were  either grown up or else they were Board School children. We weren't  going to get into a row with grown-up people--especially strangers--and  no true bandit would ever stoop to ask a ransom from the relations of  the poor and needy. So we thought it better to wait.    As I said, it was Guy Fawkes Day, and if it had not been we should never  have been able to be bandits at all, for the unwary traveller we did  catch had been forbidden to go out because he had a cold in his head.  But he would run out to follow a guy, without even putting on a coat or  a comforter, and it was a very damp, foggy afternoon and nearly dark, so  you see it was his own fault entirely, and served him jolly well right.    We saw him coming over the Heath just as we were deciding to go home  to tea. He had followed that guy right across to the village (we call  Blackheath the village; I don't know why), and he was coming back  dragging his feet and sniffing.    'Hist, an unwary traveller approaches!' whispered Oswald.    'Muffle your horses' heads and see to the priming of your pistols,'  muttered Alice. She always will play boys' parts, and she makes Ellis  cut her hair short on purpose. Ellis is a very obliging hairdresser.    'Steal softly upon him,' said Noel; 'for lo! 'tis dusk, and no human  eyes can mark our deeds.'    So we ran out and surrounded the unwary traveller. It turned out to be  Albert-next-door, and he was very frightened indeed until he saw who we  were.    'Surrender!' hissed Oswald, in a desperate-sounding voice, as he caught  the arm of the Unwary. And Albert-next-door said, 'All right! I'm  surrendering as hard as I can. You needn't pull my arm off.'    We explained to him that resistance was useless, and I think he saw that  from the first. We held him tight by both arms, and we marched him home  down the hill in a hollow square of five.    He wanted to tell us about the guy, but we made him see that it was not  proper for prisoners to talk to the guard, especially about guys that  the prisoner had been told not to go after because of his cold.    When we got to where we live he said, 'All right, I don't want to tell  you. You'll wish I had afterwards. You never saw such a guy.'    'I can see _you_!' said H. O. It was very rude, and Oswald told him so  at once, because it is his duty as an elder brother. But H. O. is very  young and does not know better yet, and besides it wasn't bad for "]]]
