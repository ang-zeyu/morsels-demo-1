But as usual he selected a site for a castle within the walls,  and left a force of chosen knights under faithful command, to complete  the fortification and to form the garrison. Harold's mother, Gytha, left  the city before its surrender, and finally found a refuge in Saint Omer,  in Flanders. Harold's sons also, if they were in Exeter, made their  escape before its fall.    After subduing Exeter, William marched with his army into Cornwall, and  put down without difficulty whatever resistance he found there. The  confiscation of forfeited estates was no doubt one object of his march  through the land, and the greater part of these were bestowed upon his  own half brother, Robert, Count of Mortain, the beginning of what grew  ultimately into the great earldom of Cornwall. In all, the grants which  were made to Robert have been estimated at 797 manors, the largest made  to any one as the result of the Conquest. Of these, 248 manors were in  Cornwall, practically the whole shire; 75 in Dorset, and 49 in  Devonshire. This was almost a principality in itself, and is alone nearly  enough to disprove the policy attributed to William of scattering about  the country the great estates which he granted. So powerful a possession  was the earldom which was founded upon this grant that after a time the  policy which had been followed in Normandy, in regard to the great  counties, seemed the only wise one in this case also, and it was not  allowed to pass out of the immediate family of the king until in the  fourteenth century it was made into a provision for the king's eldest  son, as it has ever since remained. These things done, William disbanded  his army and returned to spend Easter at Winchester.    Once more for a moment the land seemed to be at peace, and William was  justified in looking upon himself as now no longer merely the leader of a  military adventure, seeking to conquer a foreign state, but as firmly  established in a land where he had made a new home for his house. He  could send for his wife; his children should be born here. It should be  the native land of future generations for his family. Matilda came soon  after Easter, with a distinguished train of ladies as well as lords, and  with her Guy, Bishop of Amiens, who, Orderic tells us, had already  written his poem on the war of William and Harold. At Whitsuntide, in  Westminster, Matilda was crowned queen by Archbishop Aldred. Later in the  summer Henry, the future King Henry I, was born, and the new royal family  had completely identified itself with the new kingdom.    But a great task still lay before the king, the greatest perhaps that he  had yet undertaken. The north was his only in name. Scarcely had any  English king up to this time exercised there the sort of authority to  which William was accustomed, and which he was determined to exercise  everywhere. The question of the hour was, whether he could establish his  authority there by degrees, as he seemed to be trying to do, or only  after a sharp conflict. The answer to this question was known very soon  after the coronation of Matilda. What seemed to the Normans a great  conspiracy of the north and west was forming. The Welsh and English  nobles were making common cause; the clergy and the common people joined  their prayers; York was noted as especially enthusiastic in the cause,  and many there took to living in tents as a kind of training for the  conflict which was coming. The Normans understood at the time that there  were two reasons for this determination to resist by force any further  extension of William's rule. One was, the personal dissatisfaction of  Earl Edwin. He had been given by William some undefined authority, and  promoted above his brother, and he had even been promised a daughter of  the king's as his wife. Clearly it had seemed at one time very necessary  to conciliate him. But either that necessity had passed away, or William  was reluctant to fulfil his promise; and Edwin, discontented with the  delay, was ready to lead what was for him at least, after he had accepted  so much from William, a rebellion. He was the natural leader of such an  attempt; his family history made him that. Personal popularity and his  wide connexions added to his strength, and if he had had in himself the  gifts of leadership, it would not have been even then too late to dispute  the possession of England on even terms. The second reason given us is  one to which we must attach much greater force than to the personal  influence of Edwin. He in all probability merely embraced an opportunity.  The other was the really moving cause. This is said to have been the  discontent of the English and Welsh nobles under the Norman oppression,  but we must phrase it a little differently. No direct oppression had as  yet been felt, either in the north or west, but the severity of William  in the south and east, the widespread confiscations there, were  undoubtedly well known, and easily read as signs of what would follow in  the north, and already the borders of Wales were threatened n with the  pushing forward of the Norman lines, which went on so steadily and for so  long a time.    Whether or not the efforts which had been making to obtain foreign help  against William were to result finally in bringing in a reinforcement of  Scots or Danes, the union of Welshmen and Englishmen was itself  formidable and demanded instant attention. Early in the summer of 1068  the army began its march upon York, advancing along a line somewhat to  the west of the centre of England, as the situation would naturally  demand. As in William's earlier marches, so here again he encountered no  resistance. Whatever may have been the extent of the conspiracy or the  plans of the leaders, the entire movement collapsed before the Norman's  firm determination to be master of the kingdom. Edwin and Morcar had  collected an army and were in the field somewhere between Warwick and  Northampton, but when the time came when the fight could no longer be  postponed, they thought better of it, besought the king's favour again,  and obtained at least the show of it. The boastful preparations at York  brought forth no better result. The citizens went out to meet the king on  his approach, and gave him the keys of the city and hostages from among  them.    The present expedition went no further north, but its influence extended  further. Ethelwin, the Bishop of Durham came in and made his submission.  He bore inquiries also from Malcolm, the king of Scots, who had been  listening to the appeals for aid from the enemies of William, and  preparing himself to advance to their assistance. The Bishop of Durham  was sent back to let him know what assurances would be acceptable to  William, and he undoubtedly also informed him of the actual state of  affairs south of his borders, of the progress which the invader had made,  and of the hopelessness of resistance. The Normans at any rate believed  that as a result of the bishop's mission Malcolm was glad to send down an  embassy of his own which tendered to William an oath of obedience. It is  not likely that William attached much weight to any profession of the  Scottish king's. Already, probably as soon as the failure of this  northern undertaking was apparent, some of the most prominent of the  English, who seem to have taken part in it, had abandoned England and  gone to the Scottish court. It is very possible that Edgar and his two  sisters, Margaret and Christina, sought the protection of Malcolm at this  time, together with Gospatric, who had shortly before been made Earl of  Northumberland, and the sheriff Merleswegen. These men had earlier  submitted to William, Merleswegen perhaps in the submission at  Berkhampsted, with Edgar, and had been received with favour. Under what  circumstances they turned against him we do not know, but they had very  likely been attracted by the promise of strength in this effort at  resistance, and were now less inclined than the unstable Edwin to profess  so early a repentance. Margaret, whether she went to Scotland at this  time or a little later, found there a permanent home, consenting against  her will to become the bride of Malcolm instead of the bride of the  Church as she had wished. As queen she gained, through teaching her wild  subjects, by the example of gentle manners and noble life, a wider  mission than the convent could have furnished her. The conditions which  Malcolm accepted evidently contained no demand as to any English  fugitives, nor any other to which he could seriously object. William was  usually able to discern the times, and did not attempt the impracticable.    William intended this expedition of his to result in the permanent  pacification of the country through which he had passed. There is no  record of any special severity attending the march, but certainly no one  was able to infer from it that the king was weak or to be trifled with.  The important towns he secured with castles and garrisons, as he had in  the south. Warwick and Northampton were occupied in this way as he  advanced, with York at the north, and Lincoln, Huntingdon, and Cambridge  along the east as he returned. A great wedge of fortified posts was thus  driven far into that part of the land from which the greatest trouble was  to be expected, and this, together with the general impression which his  march had made, was the most which was gained from it. Sometime during  this summer of 1068 another fruitless attempt had been made to disturb  the Norman possession of England. Harold's sons had retired, perhaps  after the fall of Exeter, to Ireland, where their father had formerly  found refuge. There it was not difficult to stir up the love of  plundering raids in the descendants of the Vikings, and they returned at  this time, it is said with more than fifty ships, and sailed up the  Bristol Channel.

It then passes to the lamp, L L', through the  carbons, then returns to the balance, and proceeds back to the negative  terminal of the machine. A small portion of the current is shunted off  at the point, P, passing through the coil, S', through the contact  spring, T N, to the terminal, A', and drawing the iron core in  opposition to S. The carbons are in contact, but in passing through  the lamp the current magnetizes the electromagnet, M (Fig. 2), which  attracts the armature, A B, that bites and lifts up the rod, T, with the  upper carbon, a definite and fixed distance that is easily regulated  by the screws, Y Y. The arc then is formed, and will continue to burn  steadily as long as the current remains constant. But the moment the  current falls, due to the increased resistance of the arc, a greater  proportion passes through the shunt, S' (Fig. 4), increasing its  magnetic moment on the iron core, while that of S is diminishing. The  result is that a moment arrives when equilibrium is destroyed, the iron  rod strikes smartly and sharply upon the spring, N T. Contact between T  and H is broken, and the current passes through the electromagnet of the  break in the lamp. The break is released for an instant, the carbons  approach each other. But the same rupture of contact introduces in the  shunt a new resistance of considerable magnitude (viz., 1,200 ohms),  that of the electromagnets of the break. Then the strength of the shunt  current diminishes considerably, and the solenoid, S, recovers briskly  its drawing power upon the rod, and contact is restored. The carbons  approach during these periods only about 0.01 to 0.02 millimeter.  If this is not sufficient to restore equilibrium it is repeated  continually, until equilibrium is obtained. The result is that the  carbon is continually falling by a motion invisible to the eye, but  sufficient to provide for the consumption of the carbons.    [Illustration: FIG. 6]    The contact between N T and H is never completely broken, the sparks are  very feeble, and the contacts do not oxidize. The resistances inserted  are so considerable that heating cannot occur, while the portion of the  current abstracted for the control is so small that it may be neglected.    The balance acts precisely like the key of a Morse machine, and the  break precisely like the sounder-receiver so well known in telegraphy.  It emits the same kind of sounds, and acts automatically like a skilled  and faithful telegraphist.    This regulation, by very small and short successive steps, offers  several advantages: (1) it is imperceptible to the eye; (2) it does not  affect the main current; (3) any sudden instantaneous variation of the  main current does not allow a too near approach of the carbon points.  Let, now, an accident occur; for instance, a carbon is broken. At once  the automatic cut-off acts, the current passes through the resistance,  R, instead of passing through the lamp. The current through the fine  coil is suddenly increased, the rod is drawn in, contact is made at G  and K, and the current is sent through the coil, R. As soon as contact  is again made by the carbons, the current in the coil, S, is increased,  that of the thick wire in V diminished, and the antagonistic spring,  U, breaks the contact at G and K. The rupture of the light is almost  invisible, because the relighting is so brisk and sharp.    I have seen this lamp in action, and its constant steadiness leaves  nothing to be desired.           *       *       *       *       *          APPARATUS FOR OBTAINING PURE WATER FOR PHOTOGRAPHIC USE.      Our readers are well aware that water as found naturally is never  absolutely free from dissolved impurities; and in ordinary cases it  contains solid impurities derived both from the inorganic and organic  kingdoms, together with gaseous substances; these latter being generally  derived from the atmosphere.    By far the purest water which occurs in nature is rain-water, and if  this be collected in a secluded district, and after the air has been  well washed by previous rain, its purity is remarkable; the extraneous  matter consisting of little else than a trace of carbonic acid and other  gases dissolved from the air. In fact, such water is far purer than any  distilled water to be obtained in commerce. The case is very different  when the rain-water is collected in a town or densely populated  district, more especially if the water has been allowed to flow over  dirty roofs. The black and foully-smelling liquid popularly known as  soft water is so rich in carbonaceous and organic constituents as to be  of very limited use to the photographer; but by taking the precaution of  fitting up a simple automatic shunt for diverting the stream until the  roofs have been thoroughly washed, it becomes possible to insure a good  supply of clean and serviceable soft water, even in London. Several  forms of shunt have been devised, some of these being so complex as  to offer every prospect of speedy disorganization; but a simple and  efficient apparatus is figured in _Engineering_ by a correspondent who  signs himself \"Millwright,\" and as we have thoroughly proved the value  of an apparatus which is practically identical, we reproduce the  substance of his communication.    A gentleman of Newcastle, a retired banker, having tried various filters  to purify the rain-water collected on the roof of his house, at length  had the idea to allow no water to run into the cistern until the roof  had been well washed. After first putting up a hard-worked valve, the  arrangement as sketched below has been hit upon. Now Newcastle is a very  smoky place, and yet my friend gets water as pure as gin, and almost  absolutely free from any smack of soot.    [Illustration]    The sketch explains itself. The weight, W, and the angle of the lever,  L, are such, that when the valve, V, is once opened it goes full open. A  small hole in the can C, acts like a cataract, and brings matters to a  normal state very soon after the rain ceases.    The proper action of the apparatus can only be insured by a careful  adjustment of the weight, W, the angle through which the valve opens,  and the magnitude of the vessel, C. It is an advantage to make  the vessel, C, somewhat broader in proportion to its height than  represented, and to provide it with a movable strainer placed about half  way down. This tends to protect the cataract hole, and any accumulation  of leaves and dirt can be removed once in six months or so. Clean soft  water is valuable to the photographer in very many cases. Iron developer  (wet plate) free from chlorides will ordinarily remain effective on the  plate much longer than when chlorides are present, and the pyrogallic  solution for dry-plate work will keep good for along time if made with  soft water, while the lime which is present in hard water causes the  pyrogallic acid to oxidize with considerable rapidity. Negatives that  have been developed with oxalate developer often become covered with a  very unsightly veil of calcium oxalate when rinsed with hard water, and  something of a similar character occasionally occurs in the case of  silver prints which are transferred directly from the exposure frame to  impure water.    To the carbon printer clean rain-water is of considerable value, as he  can develop much more rapidly with soft water than with hard water;  or, what comes to the same thing, he can dissolve away his superfluous  gelatine at a lower temperature than would otherwise be necessary.    The cleanest rain-water which can ordinarily be collected in a town is  not sufficiently pure to be used with advantage in the preparation of  the nitrate bath, it being advisable to use the purest distilled water  for this purpose; and in many cases it is well to carefully distill  water for the bath in a glass apparatus of the kind figured below.    [Illustration]    A, thin glass flask serving as a retort. The tube, T, is fitted  air-tight to the flask by a cork, C.    B, receiver into which the tube, T, fits quite loosely.    D, water vessel intended to keep the spiral of lamp wick, which is shown  as surrounding T, in a moist condition. This wick acts as a siphon, and  water is gradually drawn over into the lower receptacle, E.    L, spirit lamp, which may, in many cases, be advantageously replaced by  a Bunsen burner.    A small metal still, provided with a tin condensing worm, is, however, a  more generally serviceable arrangement, and if ordinary precautions are  taken to make sure that the worm tube is clean, the resulting distilled  water will be nearly as pure as that distilled in glass vessels.    Such a still as that figured below can be heated conveniently over an  ordinary kitchen fire, and should find a place among the appliances  of every photographer. Distilled water should always be used in the  preparation of emulsion, as the impurities of ordinary water may often  introduce disturbing conditions.--_Photographic News_.

The author refers to the customary view that black phosphorus is  merely a mixture of the ordinary phosphorus with traces of a metallic  phosphide, and contends that this explanation is not in all cases  admissible. A specimen of black or rather dark gray phosphorus, which  the author submitted to the Academy, became white if melted and remained  white if suddenly cooled, but if allowed to enter into a state of  superfusion it became again black on contact with either white or black  phosphorus. A portion of the black specimen being dissolved in carbon  disulphide there remained undissolved merely a trace of a very pale  yellow matter which seemed to be amorphous phosphorus.--_Comptes  Rendus_.           *       *       *       *       *    "]]]
