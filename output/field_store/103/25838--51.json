I sincerely  hope that as a result people will be discouraged in unhappy efforts  to get rich quick by speculating in securities.  The average person  almost always loses.  Only a very small minority of the people of  this country believe in gambling as a substitute for the old  philosophy of Benjamin Franklin that the way to wealth is through  work.    In meeting the problems of industrial recovery the chief agency of  the government has been the National Recovery Administration.  Under  its guidance, trades and industries covering over 90 percent of all  industrial employees have adopted codes of fair competition, which  have been approved by the President.  Under these codes, in the  industries covered, child labor has been eliminated.  The work day  and the work week have been shortened.  Minimum wages have been  established and other wages adjusted toward a rising standard of  living.  The emergency purpose of the N.R.A. was to put men to work  and since its creation more than four million persons have been  reemployed, in great part through the cooperation of American  business brought about under the codes.    Benefits of the Industrial Recovery Program have come, not only to  labor in the form of new jobs, in relief from overwork and in  relief from underpay, but also to the owners and managers of  industry because, together with a great increase in the payrolls,  there has come a substantial rise in the total of industrial  profits--a rise from a deficit figure in the first quarter of 1933  to a level of sustained profits within one year from the  inauguration of N.R.A.    Now it should not be expected that even employed labor and capital  would be completely satisfied with present conditions.  Employed  workers have not by any means all enjoyed a return to the earnings  of prosperous times, although millions of hitherto underprivileged  workers are today far better paid than ever before.  Also, billions  of dollars of invested capital have today a greater security of  present and future earning power than before.  This is because of  the establishment of fair, competitive standards and because of  relief from unfair competition in wage cutting which depresses  markets and destroys purchasing power.  But it is an undeniable fact  that the restoration of other billions of sound investments to a  reasonable earning power could not be brought about in one year.  There is no magic formula, no economic panacea, which could simply  revive over-night the heavy industries and the trades dependent  upon them.    Nevertheless the gains of trade and industry, as a whole, have been  substantial.  In these gains and in the policies of the  administration there are assurances that hearten all forward-  looking men and women with the confidence that we are definitely  rebuilding our political and economic system on the lines laid down  by the New Deal--lines which as I have so often made clear, are in  complete accord with the underlying principles of orderly popular  government which Americans have demanded since the white man first  came to these shores.  We count, in the future as in the past, on  the driving power of individual initiative and the incentive of  fair private profit, strengthened with the acceptance of those  obligations to the public interest which rest upon us all.  We have  the right to expect that this driving power will be given  patriotically and whole-heartedly to our nation.    We have passed through the formative period of code making in the  National Recovery Administration and have effected a reorganization  of the N.R.A. suited to the needs of the next phase, which is, in  turn, a period of preparation for legislation which will determine  its permanent form.    In this recent reorganization we have recognized three distinct  functions:  first, the legislative or policy making function;  second, the administrative function of code making and revision;  and, third, the judicial function, which includes enforcement,  consumer complaints and the settlement of disputes between  employers and employees and between one employer and another.    We are now prepared to move into this second phase, on the basis of  our experience in the first phase under the able and energetic  leadership of General Johnson.    We shall watch carefully the working of this new machinery for the  second phase of N.R.A., modifying it where it needs modification  and finally making recommendations to the Congress, in order that  the functions of N.R.A. which have proved their worth may be made a  part of the permanent machinery of government.    Let me call your attention to the fact that the national Industrial  Recovery Act gave businessmen the opportunity they had sought for  years to improve business conditions through what has been called  self-government in industry.  If the codes which have been written  have been too complicated, if they have gone too far in such  matters as price fixing and limitation of production, let it be  remembered that so far as possible, consistent with the immediate  public interest of this past year and the vital necessity of  improving labor conditions, the representatives of trade and  industry were permitted to write their ideas into the codes.  It is  now time to review these actions as a whole to determine through  deliberative means in the light of experience, from the standpoint  of the good of the industries themselves, as well as the general  public interest, whether the methods and policies adopted in the  emergency have been best calculated to promote industrial recovery  and a permanent improvement of business and labor conditions.  There  may be a serious question as to the wisdom of many of those devices  to control production, or to prevent destructive price cutting  which many business organizations have insisted were necessary, or  whether their effect may have been to prevent that volume of  production which would make possible lower prices and increased  employment.  Another question arises as to whether in fixing minimum  wages on the basis of an hourly or weekly wage we have reached into  the heart of the problem which is to provide such annual earnings  for the lowest paid worker as will meet his minimum needs.  We also  question the wisdom of extending code requirements suited to the  great industrial centers and to large employers, to the great  number of small employers in the smaller communities.    During the last twelve months our industrial recovery has been to  some extent retarded by strikes, including a few of major  importance.  I would not minimize the inevitable losses to employers  and employees and to the general public through such conflicts.  But  I would point out that the extent and severity of labor disputes  during this period has been far less than in any previous,  comparable period.    When the businessmen of the country were demanding the right to  organize themselves adequately to promote their legitimate  interests; when the farmers were demanding legislation which would  give them opportunities and incentives to organize themselves for a  common advance, it was natural that the workers should seek and  obtain a statutory declaration of their constitutional right to  organize themselves for collective bargaining as embodied in  Section 7 (a) of the national Industrial Recovery Act.    Machinery set up by the federal government has provided some new  methods of adjustment.  Both employers and employees must share the  blame of not using them as fully as they should.  The employer who  turns away from impartial agencies of peace, who denies freedom of  organization to his employees, or fails to make every reasonable  effort at a peaceful solution of their differences, is not fully  supporting the recovery effort of his government.  The workers who  turn away from these same impartial agencies and decline to use  their good offices to gain their ends are likewise not fully  cooperating with their government.    It is time that we made a clean-cut effort to bring about that  united action of management and labor, which is one of the high  purposes of the Recovery Act.  We have passed through more than a  year of education.  Step by step we have created all the government  agencies necessary to insure, as a general rule, industrial peace,  with justice for all those willing to use these agencies whenever  their voluntary bargaining fails to produce a necessary agreement.    There should be at least a full and fair trial given to these means  of ending industrial warfare; and in such an effort we should be  able to secure for employers and employees and consumers the  benefits that all derive from the continuous, peaceful operation of  our essential enterprises.    Accordingly, I propose to confer within the coming month with small  groups of those truly representative of large employers of labor  and of large groups of organized labor, in order to seek their  cooperation in establishing what I may describe as a specific trial  period of industrial peace.    From those willing to join in establishing this hoped-for period of  peace, I shall seek assurances of the making and maintenance of  agreements, which can be mutually relied upon, under which wages,  hours and working conditions may be determined and any later  adjustments shall be made either by agreement or, in case of  disagreement, through the mediation or arbitration of state or  federal agencies.  I shall not ask either employers or employees  permanently to lay aside the weapons common to industrial war.  But  I shall ask both groups to give a fair trial to peaceful methods of  adjusting their conflicts of opinion and interest, and to  experiment for a reasonable time with measures suitable to civilize  our industrial civilization.    Closely allied to the N.R.A. is the program of Public Works  provided for in the same Act and designed to put more men back to"]]]
