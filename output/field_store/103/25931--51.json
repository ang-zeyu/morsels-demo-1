If only it is allowed a little  leisurely solitude, and can look about and think to its heart's content,  it will express its feelings to its own satisfaction.    This freedom of solitude is what my mind is fretting for; it would be  alone with its imaginings, as the Creator broods over His own creation.          CUTTACK,    _February 1893_.      Till we can achieve something, let us live incognito, say I. So long as we  are only fit to be looked down upon, on what shall we base our claim to  respect? When we have acquired a foothold of our own in the world, when we  have had some share in shaping its course, then we can meet others  smilingly. Till then let us keep in the background, attending to our own  affairs.    But our countrymen seem to hold the opposite opinion. They set no store by  our more modest, intimate wants which have to be met behind the  scenes,--the whole of their attention is directed to momentary  attitudinising and display.    Ours is truly a God-forsaken country. Difficult, indeed, is it for us to  maintain the strength of will to _do_. We get no help in any real  sense. There is no one, within miles of us, in converse with whom we might  gain an accession of vitality. No one near seems to be thinking, or  feeling, or working. Not a soul has any experience of big striving, or of  really and truly living. They all eat and drink, do their office work,  smoke and sleep, and chatter nonsensically. When they touch upon emotion  they grow sentimental, when they reason they are childish. One yearns for  a full-blooded, sturdy, and capable personality; these are all so many  shadows, flitting about, out of touch with the world.          CUTTACK,    _10th February_ 1893.      He was a fully developed John Bull of the outrageous type--with a huge  beak of a nose, cunning eyes, and a yard-long chin. The curtailment of our  right to be tried by jury is now under consideration by the Government.  The fellow dragged in the subject by the ears and insisted on arguing it  out with our host, poor B---- Babu. He said the moral standard of the  people of this country was low; that they had no real belief in the  sacredness of life; so that they were unfit to serve on juries.    The utter contempt with which we are regarded by these people was brought  home to me when I saw how they can accept a Bengali's hospitality and talk  thus, seated at his table, without a quiver of compunction.    As I sat in a corner of the drawing-room after dinner, everything round me  looked blurred to my eyes. I seemed to be seated by the head of my great,  insulted Motherland, who lay there in the dust before me, disconsolate,  shorn of her glory. I cannot tell what a profound distress overpowered my  heart.    How incongruous seemed the _mem-sahibs_ there, in their  evening-dresses, the hum of English conversation, and the ripples of  laughter! How richly true for us is our India of the ages; how cheap and  false the hollow courtesies of an English dinner-party!          CUTTACK,    _March_ 1893.      If we begin to attach too much importance to the applause of Englishmen,  we shall have to be rid of much in us that is good, and to accept from  them much that is bad.    We shall grow ashamed of going about without socks, and cease to feel  shame at the sight of their ball dresses. We shall have no compunction in  throwing overboard our ancient manners, nor any in emulating their lack of  courtesy.    We shall leave off wearing our _achgans_ because they are susceptible of  improvement, but think nothing of surrendering our heads to their hats,  though no headgear could well be uglier.    In short, consciously or unconsciously, we shall have to cut our lives  down according as they clap their hands or not.    Wherefore I apostrophise myself and say: \"O Earthen Pot! For goodness sake  keep away from that Metal Pot! Whether he comes to you in anger or merely  to give you a patronising pat on the back, you are done for, cracked in  either case. So pay heed to old Aesop's sage counsel, I pray--and keep  your distance.\"    Let the metal pot ornament wealthy homes; you have work to do in those of  the poor. If you let yourself be broken, you will have no place in either,  but merely return to the dust; or, at best, you may secure a corner in a  bric-a-brac cabinet--as a curiosity, and it is more glorious far to be  used for fetching water by the meanest of village women.          SHELIDAH,    _8th May 1893_.      Poetry is a very old love of mine--I must have been engaged to her when I  was only Rathi's[1] age. Long ago the recesses under the old banyan tree  beside our tank, the inner gardens, the unknown regions on the ground  floor of the house, the whole of the outside world, the nursery rhymes and  tales told by the maids, created a wonderful fairyland within me. It is  difficult to give a clear idea of all the vague and mysterious happenings  of that period, but this much is certain, that my exchange of garlands[2]  with Poetic Fancy was already duly celebrated.    [Footnote 1: Rathi, his son, was then five years old.]    [Footnote 2: The betrothal ceremony.]    I must admit, however, that my betrothed is not an auspicious  maiden--whatever else she may bring one, it is not good fortune. I cannot  say she has never given me happiness, but peace of mind with her is out of  the question. The lover whom she favours may get his fill of bliss, but  his heart's blood is wrung out under her relentless embrace. It is not for  the unfortunate creature of her choice ever to become a staid and sober  householder, comfortably settled down on a social foundation.    Consciously or unconsciously, I may have done many things that were  untrue, but I have never uttered anything false in my poetry--that is the  sanctuary where the deepest truths of my life find refuge.          SHELIDAH,    _10th May_ 1893.      Here come black, swollen masses of cloud; they soak up the golden sunshine  from the scene in front of me like great pads of blotting-paper. Rain must  be near, for the breeze feels moist and tearful.    Over there, on the sky-piercing peaks of Simla, you will find it hard to  realise exactly what an important event the coming of the clouds is here,  or how many are anxiously looking up to the sky, hailing their advent.    I feel a great tenderness for these peasant folk--our ryots--big,  helpless, infantile children of Providence, who must have food brought to  their very lips, or they are undone. When the breasts of Mother Earth dry  up they are at a loss what to do, and can only cry. But no sooner is their  hunger satisfied than they forget all their past sufferings.    I know not whether the socialistic ideal of a more equal distribution of  wealth is attainable, but if not, the dispensation of Providence is indeed  cruel, and man a truly unfortunate creature. For if in this world misery  must exist, so be it; but let some little loophole, some glimpse of  possibility at least, be left, which may serve to urge the nobler portion  of humanity to hope and struggle unceasingly for its alleviation.    They say a terribly hard thing who assert that the division of the world's  production to afford each one a mouthful of food, a bit of clothing, is  only an Utopian dream. All these social problems are hard indeed! Fate has  allowed humanity such a pitifully meagre coverlet, that in pulling it over  one part of the world, another has to be left bare. In allaying our  poverty we lose our wealth, and with this wealth what a world of grace and  beauty and power is lost to us.    But the sun shines forth again, though the clouds are still banked up in  the West.          SHELIDAH,    _11th May 1893._      There is another pleasure for me here. Sometimes one or other of our  simple, devoted, old ryots comes to see me--and their worshipful homage is  so unaffected! How much greater than I are they in the beautiful  simplicity and sincerity of their reverence. What if I am unworthy of  their veneration--their feeling loses nothing of its value.    I regard these grown-up children with the same kind of affection that I  have for little children--but there is also a difference. They are more  infantile still. Little children will grow up later on, but these big  children never.    A meek and radiantly simple soul shines through their worn and wrinkled,  old bodies. Little children are merely simple, they have not the  unquestioning, unwavering devotion of these. If there be any undercurrent  along which the souls of men may have communication with one another, then  my sincere blessing will surely reach and serve them.          SHELIDAH,    _16th May_ 1893.      I walk about for an hour on the river bank, fresh and clean after my  afternoon bath. Then I get into the new jolly-boat, anchor in mid-stream,  and on a bed, spread on the planked over-stern, I lie silently there on my  back, in the darkness of the evening. Little S---- sits beside me and  chatters away, and the sky becomes more and more thickly studded with  stars.    Each day the thought recurs to me: Shall I be reborn under this  star-spangled sky? Will the peaceful rapture of such wonderful evenings  ever again be mine, on this silent Bengal river, in so secluded a corner  of the world?    Perhaps not. The scene may be changed; I may be born with a different  mind. Many such evenings may come, but they may refuse to nestle so  trustfully, so lovingly, with such complete abandon, to my breast.    Curiously enough, my greatest fear is lest I should be reborn in Europe!  For there one cannot recline like this with one's whole being laid open to  the infinite above--one is liable, I am afraid, to be soundly rated for  lying down at all. I should probably have been hustling strenuously in  some factory or bank, or Parliament.

In answer to all this, it was urged, that \"his filial piety, and the  unhappy situation of the Republic, were pure pretences; but the ardent  lust of reigning, his true and only motive: with this spirit he had  solicited into his service, by bribery, a body of veteran soldiers: and  though a private youth, without post or magistracy, but, in defiance of  law, levied an army: with this spirit he had debauched and bought  the Roman legions under the Consuls, while he was falsely feigning a  coalition with Pompey's republican party: that soon after, when he had  procured from the Senate, or rather usurped the honours and authority  of the Praetorship; and when Hirtius and Pansa, the two Consuls, were  slain, he seized both their armies: that it was doubted whether the  Consuls fell by the enemy, or whether Pansa was not killed by pouring  poison into his wounds; and Hirtius slain by his own soldiers; and  whether the young Caesar was not the black contriver of this bloody  treason: that by terror he had extorted the Consulship in spite of the  Senate; and turned against the Commonwealth the very arms with which the  Commonwealth had trusted him for her defence against Anthony. Add to all  this his cruel proscriptions, and the massacre of so many citizens, his  seizing from the public and distributing to his own creatures so many  lands and possessions; a violation of property not justified even by  those who gained by it. But, allowing him to dedicate to the Manes of  the Dictator the lives of Brutus and Cassius (though more to his honour  had it been to have postponed his own personal hate to public good), did  he not betray the young Pompey by an insidious peace, betray Lepidus by  a deceitful show of friendship? Did he not next ensnare Marc Anthony,  first by treaties, those of Tarentum and Brundusium; then by a marriage,  that of his sister Octavia? And did not Anthony at last pay with his  life the penalty of that subdolous alliance? After this, no doubt there  was peace, but a bloody peace; bloody in the tragical defeat of Lollius,  and that of Varus, in Germany; and at Rome, the Varrones, the Egnatii,  the Julii (those illustrious names) were put to death.\" Nor was his  domestic life spared upon this occasion. \"He had arbitrarily robbed  Nero of his wife big with child by her husband; and mocked the Gods  by consulting the Priests; whether religion permitted him to marry her  before her delivery, or obliged him to stay till after. His minions,  Tedius and Vedius Pollio, had lived in scandalous and excessive luxury:  his wife Livia, who wholly controlled him, had proved a cruel governess  to the Commonwealth; and to the Julian house, a more cruel step-mother:  he had even invaded the incommunicable honours of the Gods, and setting  up for himself temples like theirs, would like them be adored in  the image of a Deity, with all the sacred solemnity of Priests and  sacrifices: nor had he adopted Tiberius for his successor, either out  of affection for him, or from concern for the public welfare; but having  discovered in him a spirit proud and cruel, he sought future glory from  the blackest opposition and comparison.\" For, Augustus, when, a few  years before, he solicited the Senate to grant to Tiberius another  term of the authority of the Tribuneship, though he mentioned him with  honour, yet taking notice of his odd humour, behaviour, and manners,  dropped some expressions, which, while they seemed to excuse him,  exposed and upbraided him.    As soon as the funeral of Augustus was over, a temple and divine  worship were forthwith decreed him. The Senate then turned their instant  supplications to Tiberius, to fill his vacant place; but received  an abstruse answer, touching the greatness of the Empire and his own  distrust of himself; he said that \"nothing but the divine genius of  Augustus was equal to the mighty task: that for himself, who had been  called by him into a participation of his cares, he had learnt  by feeling them, what a daring, what a difficult toil was that of  government, and how perpetually subject to the caprices of fortune: that  in a State supported by so many illustrious patriots they ought not to  cast the whole administration upon one; and more easy to be administered  were the several offices of the Government by the united pains and  sufficiency of many.\" A pompous and plausible speech, but in it little  faith and sincerity. Tiberius, even upon subjects which needed no  disguises, used words dark and cautious; perhaps from his diffident  nature, perhaps from a habit of dissembling: at this juncture indeed,  as he laboured wholly to hide his heart, his language was the more  carefully wrapped up in equivoques and obscurity: but the Senators, who  dreaded nothing so much as to seem to understand him, burst into tears,  plaints, and vows; with extended arms they supplicated the Gods, invoked  the image of Augustus, and embraced the knees of Tiberius. He then  commanded the imperial register to be produced and recited. It contained  a summary of the strength and income of the Empire, the number of  Romans and auxiliaries in pay, the condition of the navy, of the  several kingdoms paying tribute, and of the various provinces and  their revenues, with the state of the public expense, the issues of the  exchequer, and all the demands upon the public. This register was all  writ by the hand of Augustus; and in it he had subjoined his counsel to  posterity, that the present boundaries of the Empire should stand fixed  without further enlargement; but whether this counsel was dictated by  fear for the public, or by envy towards his successors, is uncertain.    Now when the Senate was stooping to the vilest importunity and  prostrations, Tiberius happened to say, that, \"as he was unequal to  the weight of the whole government; so if they entrusted him with any  particular part, whatever it were, he would undertake it.\" Here Asinius  Gallus interposed: \"I beg to know, Caesar,\" says he, \"what part of  the government you desire for your share?\" He was astonished with  the unexpected question, and, for a short space, mute; but recovering  himself, answered, that \"it ill became his modesty to choose or reject  any particular branch of the administration, when he desired rather to  be excused from the whole.\" Gallus, who in his face conjectured sullen  signs of displeasure, again accosted him, and said, \"by this question I  did not mean that you should do an impracticable thing, and share  that power which cannot be separated; but I meant to reason you into a  confession that the Commonwealth is but one body, and can be governed  only by one soul.\" He added an encomium upon Augustus, and reminded  Tiberius himself of his many victories, of the many civil employments  which he had long and nobly sustained: nor even thus could he mollify  the wrath of Tiberius, who had long hated him, for that Gallus had  married Vipsania, daughter of Marcus Agrippa, and formerly wife to  Tiberius, who thence suspected that by this match he meant to soar above  the rank of a subject, and possessed too the bold and haughty spirit of  Asinius Pollio his father.    Lucius Arruntius incurred his displeasure next, by a speech not much  unlike that of Gallus: it is true, that towards him Tiberius bore no  old rancour; but Arruntius had mighty opulence, prompt parts, noble  accomplishments, with equal popularity, and hence was marked by him with  a fell eye of suspicion. For, as Augustus, shortly before his decease,  was mentioning those among the great men, who were capable of the  supreme power, but would not accept it; or unequal to it, yet wished  for it; or such, as had both ambition and sufficiency; he had said, that  \"Marcus Lepidus was qualified, but would reject it; Asinius would be  aspiring, but had inferior talents; and that Lucius Arruntius wanted no  sufficiency, and upon a proper occasion would attempt it.\" That he spoke  thus of Lepidus and Asinius, is agreed; but, instead of Arruntius, some  writers have transmitted the name of Cneius Piso: and every one of these  great men, except Lepidus, were afterwards cut off, under the imputation  of various crimes, all darkly framed by Tiberius. Quintus Haterius and  Mamercus Scaurus did thereafter incense his distrustful spirit;  the first by asking him, \"How long, Caesar, wilt thou suffer the  Commonwealth to remain destitute of a head?\" Scaurus, because he had  said \"there was room to hope that the prayers of the Senate would  not prove abortive, since he had not opposed as Tribune, nor rendered  invalid, as he might, the motion of the Consuls in his behalf.\" With  Haterius he fell into instant rage; towards Scaurus his resentment was  more deep and implacable, and in profound silence he hid it. Wearied  at last with public importunity and clamour, and with particular  expostulations, he began to unbend a little; not that he would own his  undertaking the Empire, but only avoid the uneasiness of perpetually  rejecting endless solicitations. It is known how Haterius, when he went  next day to the palace to implore pardon, and throwing himself at the  feet of Tiberius embraced his knees, narrowly escaped being slain by the  soldiers; because Tiberius, who was walking, tumbled down, whether by  chance, or whether his legs were entangled in the arms of Haterius:  neither was he a jot mollified by the danger which threatened so great a  man, who was at length forced to supplicate Augusta for protection; nor  could even she obtain it, but after the most laboured entreaties.    Towards Livia, too, exorbitant was "]]]
