When we come to some house we will inquire the way  to the Emerald City.\"          Chapter Eight    The Foolish Owl and the Wise Donkey      On they went, and half an hour's steady walking brought them to a house  somewhat better than the two they had already passed. It stood close to  the roadside and over the door was a sign that read: \"Miss Foolish Owl  and Mr. Wise Donkey: Public Advisers.\"    When Ojo read this sign aloud Scraps said laughingly: \"Well, here is a  place to get all the advice we want, maybe more than we need. Let's go  in.\"    The boy knocked at the door.    \"Come in!\" called a deep bass voice.    So they opened the door and entered the house, where a little  light-brown donkey, dressed in a blue apron and a blue cap, was engaged  in dusting the furniture with a blue cloth. On a shelf over the window  sat a great blue owl with a blue sunbonnet on her head, blinking her  big round eyes at the visitors.    \"Good morning,\" said the donkey, in his deep voice, which seemed bigger  than he was. \"Did you come to us for advice?\"    \"Why, we came, anyhow,\" replied Scraps, \"and now we are here we may as  well have some advice. It's free, isn't it?\"    \"Certainly,\" said the donkey. \"Advice doesn't cost anything--unless you  follow it. Permit me to say, by the way, that you are the queerest lot  of travelers that ever came to my shop. Judging you merely by  appearances, I think you'd better talk to the Foolish Owl yonder.\"    They turned to look at the bird, which fluttered its wings and stared  back at them with its big eyes.    \"Hoot-ti-toot-ti-toot!\" cried the owl.        \"Fiddle-cum-foo,      Howdy-do?      Riddle-cum, tiddle-cum,      Too-ra-la-loo!\"      \"That beats your poetry, Scraps,\" said Ojo.    \"It's just nonsense!\" declared the Glass Cat.    \"But it's good advice for the foolish,\" said the donkey, admiringly.  \"Listen to my partner, and you can't go wrong.\"    Said the owl in a grumbling voice:        \"Patchwork Girl has come to life;      No one's sweetheart, no one's wife;      Lacking sense and loving fun,      She'll be snubbed by everyone.\"      \"Quite a compliment! Quite a compliment, I declare,\" exclaimed the  donkey, turning to look at Scraps. \"You are certainly a wonder, my  dear, and I fancy you'd make a splendid pincushion. If you belonged to  me, I'd wear smoked glasses when I looked at you.\"    \"Why?\" asked the Patchwork Girl.    \"Because you are so gay and gaudy.\"    \"It is my beauty that dazzles you,\" she asserted. \"You Munchkin people  all strut around in your stupid blue color, while I--\"    \"You are wrong in calling me a Munchkin,\" interrupted the donkey, \"for  I was born in the Land of Mo and came to visit the Land of Oz on the  day it was shut off from all the rest of the world. So here I am  obliged to stay, and I confess it is a very pleasant country to live  in.\"    \"Hoot-ti-toot!\" cried the owl;        \"Ojo's searching for a charm,      'Cause Unc Nunkie's come to harm.      Charms are scarce; they're hard to get;      Ojo's got a job, you bet!\"      \"Is the owl so very foolish?\" asked the boy.    \"Extremely so,\" replied the donkey. \"Notice what vulgar expressions she  uses. But I admire the owl for the reason that she is positively  foolish. Owls are supposed to be so very wise, generally, that a  foolish one is unusual, and you perhaps know that anything or anyone  unusual is sure to be interesting to the wise.\"    The owl flapped its wings again, muttering these words:        \"It's hard to be a glassy cat--      No cat can be more hard than that;      She's so transparent, every act      Is clear to us, and that's a fact.\"      \"Have you noticed my pink brains?\" inquired Bungle, proudly. \"You can  see 'em work.\"    \"Not in the daytime,\" said the donkey. \"She can't see very well by day,  poor thing. But her advice is excellent. I advise you all to follow it.\"    \"The owl hasn't given us any advice, as yet,\" the boy declared.    \"No? Then what do you call all those sweet poems?\"    \"Just foolishness,\" replied Ojo. \"Scraps does the same thing.\"    \"Foolishness! Of course! To be sure! The Foolish Owl must be foolish or  she wouldn't be the Foolish Owl. You are very complimentary to my  partner, indeed,\" asserted the donkey, rubbing his front hoofs together  as if highly pleased.    \"The sign says that you are wise,\" remarked Scraps to the donkey. \"I  wish you would prove it.\"    \"With great pleasure,\" returned the beast. \"Put me to the test, my dear  Patches, and I'll prove my wisdom in the wink of an eye.\"    \"What is the best way to get to the Emerald City?\" asked Ojo.    \"Walk,\" said the donkey.    \"I know; but what road shall I take?\" was the boy's next question.    \"The road of yellow bricks, of course. It leads directly to the Emerald  City.\"    \"And how shall we find the road of yellow bricks?\"    \"By keeping along the path you have been following. You'll come to the  yellow bricks pretty soon, and you'll know them when you see them  because they're the only yellow things in the blue country.\"    \"Thank you,\" said the boy. \"At last you have told me something.\"    \"Is that the extent of your wisdom?\" asked Scraps.    \"No,\" replied the donkey; \"I know many other things, but they wouldn't  interest you. So I'll give you a last word of advice: move on, for the  sooner you do that the sooner you'll get to the Emerald City of Oz.\"    \"Hoot-ti-toot-ti-toot-ti-too!\" screeched the owl;        \"Off you go! fast or slow,      Where you're going you don't know.      Patches, Bungle, Munchkin lad,      Facing fortunes good and bad,      Meeting dangers grave and sad,      Sometimes worried, sometimes glad--      Where you're going you don't know,      Nor do I, but off you go!\"      \"Sounds like a hint, to me,\" said the Patchwork Girl.    \"Then let's take it and go,\" replied Ojo.    They said good-bye to the Wise Donkey and the Foolish Owl and at once  resumed their journey.          Chapter Nine    They Meet the Woozy      \"There seem to be very few houses around here, after all,\" remarked  Ojo, after they had walked for a time in silence.    \"Never mind,\" said Scraps; \"we are not looking for houses, but rather  the road of yellow bricks. Won't it be funny to run across something  yellow in this dismal blue country?\"    \"There are worse colors than yellow in this country,\" asserted the  Glass Cat, in a spiteful tone.    \"Oh; do you mean the pink pebbles you call your brains, and your red  heart and green eyes?\" asked the Patchwork Girl.    \"No; I mean you, if you must know it,\" growled the cat.    \"You're jealous!\" laughed Scraps. \"You'd give your whiskers for a  lovely variegated complexion like mine.\"    \"I wouldn't!\" retorted the cat. \"I've the clearest complexion in the  world, and I don't employ a beauty-doctor, either.\"    \"I see you don't,\" said Scraps.    \"Please don't quarrel,\" begged Ojo. \"This is an important journey, and  quarreling makes me discouraged. To be brave, one must be cheerful, so  I hope you will be as good-tempered as possible.\"    They had traveled some distance when suddenly they faced a high fence  which barred any further progress straight ahead. It ran directly  across the road and enclosed a small forest of tall trees, set close  together. When the group of adventurers peered through the bars of the  fence they thought this forest looked more gloomy and forbidding than  any they had ever seen before.    They soon discovered that the path they had been following now made a  bend and passed around the enclosure, but what made Ojo stop and look  thoughtful was a sign painted on the fence which read:        \"BEWARE OF THE WOOZY!\"      \"That means,\" he said, \"that there's a Woozy inside that fence, and the  Woozy must be a dangerous animal or they wouldn't tell people to beware  of it.\"    \"Let's keep out, then,\" replied Scraps. \"That path is outside the  fence, and Mr. Woozy may have all his little forest to himself, for all  we care.\"    \"But one of our errands is to find a Woozy,\" Ojo explained. \"The  Magician wants me to get three hairs from the end of a Woozy's tail.\"    \"Let's go on and find some other Woozy,\" suggested the cat. \"This one  is ugly and dangerous, or they wouldn't cage him up. Maybe we shall  find another that is tame and gentle.\"    \"Perhaps there isn't any other, at all,\" answered Ojo. \"The sign  doesn't say: 'Beware a Woozy'; it says: 'Beware the Woozy,' which may  mean there's only one in all the Land of Oz.\"    \"Then,\" said Scraps, \"suppose we go in and find him? Very likely if we  ask him politely to let us pull three hairs out of the tip of his tail  he won't hurt us.\"    \"It would hurt him, I'm sure, and that would make him cross,\" said the  cat.    \"You needn't worry, Bungle,\" remarked the Patchwork Girl; \"for if there  is danger you can climb a tree. Ojo and I are not afraid; are we, Ojo?\"    \"I am, a little,\" the boy admitted; \"but this danger must be faced, if  we intend to save poor Unc Nunkie. How shall we get over the fence?\"    \"Climb,\" answered Scraps, and at once she began climbing up the rows of  bars. Ojo followed and found it more easy than he had expected. When  they got to the top of the fence they began to get down on the other  side and soon were in the forest. The Glass Cat, being small, crept  between the lower bars and joined them.    Here there was no path of any sort, so they entered the woods, the boy  leading the way, and wandered through the trees until they were nearly  in the center of the forest. They now came upon a clear space in which  stood a rocky cave.    So far they had met no living creature, but when Ojo saw the cave he  knew it must be the den of the Woozy.    It is hard to face any savage beast without a sinking of the heart, but  still more terrifying is it to face an unknown beast, which you have  never seen even a picture of. So there is little wonder that the pulses  of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/956"],[0,"Tik-Tok of Oz (#9)"],[1," We will make the  Clockwork Man the private soldier!\"    \"Who? Me?\" asked Tik-Tok. \"Not for a sin-gle sec-ond! I can-not fight,  and you must not for-get that it was Rug-ge-do who threw me in the  well.\"    \"At that time you had no gun,\" said Polychrome. \"But if you join the  Army of Oogaboo you will carry the gun that Mr. Files used.\"    \"A sol-dier must be a-ble to run as well as to fight,\" protested  Tik-Tok, \"and if my works run down, as they of-ten do, I could nei-ther  run nor fight.\"    \"I'll keep you wound up, Tik-Tok,\" promised Betsy.    \"Why, it isn't a bad idea,\" said Shaggy. \"Tik-Tok will make an ideal  soldier, for nothing can injure him except a sledge hammer. And, since  a private soldier seems to be necessary to this Army, Tik-Tok is the  only one of our party fitted to undertake the job.\"    \"What must I do?\" asked Tik-Tok.    \"Obey orders,\" replied Ann. \"When the officers command you to do  anything, you must do it; that is all.\"    \"And that's enough, too,\" said Files.    \"Do I get a salary?\" inquired Tik-Tok.    \"You get your share of the plunder,\" answered the Queen.    \"Yes,\" remarked Files, \"one-half of the plunder goes to Queen Ann, the  other half is divided among the officers, and the Private gets the  rest.\"    \"That will be sat-is-fac-tor-y,\" said Tik-Tok, picking up the gun and  examining it wonderingly, for he had never before seen such a weapon.    Then Ann strapped the knapsack to Tik-Tok's copper back and said: \"Now  we are ready to march to Ruggedo's Kingdom and conquer it. Officers,  give the command to march.\"    \"Fall--in!\" yelled the Generals, drawing their swords.    \"Fall--in!\" cried the Colonels, drawing their swords.    \"Fall--in!\" shouted the Majors, drawing their swords.    \"Fall--in!\" bawled the Captains, drawing their swords.    Tik-Tok looked at them and then around him in surprise.    \"Fall in what? The well?\" he asked.    \"No,\" said Queen Ann, \"you must fall in marching order.\"    \"Can-not I march without fall-ing in-to it?\" asked the Clockwork Man.    \"Shoulder your gun and stand ready to march,\" advised Files; so Tik-Tok  held the gun straight and stood still.    \"What next?\" he asked.    The Queen turned to Shaggy.    \"Which road leads to the Metal Monarch's cavern?\"    \"We don't know, Your Majesty,\" was the reply.    \"But this is absurd!\" said Ann with a frown. \"If we can't get to  Ruggedo, it is certain that we can't conquer him.\"    \"You are right,\" admitted Shaggy; \"but I did not say we could not get  to him. We have only to discover the way, and that was the matter we  were considering when you and your magnificent Army arrived here.\"    \"Well, then, get busy and discover it,\" snapped the Queen.    That was no easy task. They all stood looking from one road to another  in perplexity. The paths radiated from the little clearing like the  rays of the midday sun, and each path seemed like all the others.    Files and the Rose Princess, who had by this time become good friends,  advanced a little way along one of the roads and found that it was  bordered by pretty wild flowers.    \"Why don't you ask the flowers to tell you the way?\" he said to his  companion.    \"The flowers?\" returned the Princess, surprised at the question.    \"Of course,\" said Files. \"The field-flowers must be second-cousins to a  Rose Princess, and I believe if you ask them they will tell you.\"    She looked more closely at the flowers. There were hundreds of white  daisies, golden buttercups, bluebells and daffodils growing by the  roadside, and each flower-head was firmly set upon its slender but  stout stem. There were even a few wild roses scattered here and there  and perhaps it was the sight of these that gave the Princess courage to  ask the important question.    She dropped to her knees, facing the flowers, and extended both her  arms pleadingly toward them.    \"Tell me, pretty cousins,\" she said in her sweet, gentle voice, \"which  way will lead us to the Kingdom of Ruggedo, the Nome King?\"    At once all the stems bent gracefully to the right and the flower heads  nodded once--twice--thrice in that direction.    \"That's it!\" cried Files joyfully. \"Now we know the way.\"    Ozga rose to her feet and looked wonderingly at the field-flowers,  which had now resumed their upright position.    \"Was it the wind, do you think?\" she asked in a low whisper.    \"No, indeed,\" replied Files. \"There is not a breath of wind stirring.  But these lovely blossoms are indeed your cousins and answered your  question at once, as I knew they would.\"          Chapter Nine    Ruggedo's Rage is Rash and Reckless      The way taken by the adventurers led up hill and down dale and wound  here and there in a fashion that seemed aimless. But always it drew  nearer to a range of low mountains and Files said more than once that  he was certain the entrance to Ruggedo's cavern would be found among  these rugged hills.    In this he was quite correct. Far underneath the nearest mountain was a  gorgeous chamber hollowed from the solid rock, the walls and roof of  which glittered with thousands of magnificent jewels. Here, on a throne  of virgin gold, sat the famous Nome King, dressed in splendid robes and  wearing a superb crown cut from a single blood-red ruby.    Ruggedo, the Monarch of all the Metals and Precious Stones of the  Underground World, was a round little man with a flowing white beard, a  red face, bright eyes and a scowl that covered all his forehead. One  would think, to look at him, that he ought to be jolly; one might  think, considering his enormous wealth, that he ought to be happy; but  this was not the case. The Metal Monarch was surly and cross because  mortals had dug so much treasure out of the earth and kept it above  ground, where all the power of Ruggedo and his nomes was unable to  recover it. He hated not only the mortals but also the fairies who live  upon the earth or above it, and instead of being content with the  riches he still possessed he was unhappy because he did not own all the  gold and jewels in the world.    Ruggedo had been nodding, half asleep, in his chair when suddenly he  sat upright, uttered a roar of rage and began pounding upon a huge gong  that stood beside him.    The sound filled the vast cavern and penetrated to many caverns beyond,  where countless thousands of nomes were working at their unending  tasks, hammering out gold and silver and other metals, or melting ores  in great furnaces, or polishing glittering gems. The nomes trembled at  the sound of the King's gong and whispered fearfully to one another  that something unpleasant was sure to happen; but none dared pause in  his task.    The heavy curtains of cloth-of-gold were pushed aside and Kaliko, the  King's High Chamberlain, entered the royal presence.    \"What's up, Your Majesty?\" he asked, with a wide yawn, for he had just  wakened.    \"Up?\" roared Ruggedo, stamping his foot viciously. \"Those foolish  mortals are up, that's what! And they want to come down.\"    \"Down here?\" inquired Kaliko.    \"Yes!\"    \"How do you know?\" continued the Chamberlain, yawning again.    \"I feel it in my bones,\" said Ruggedo. \"I can always feel it when those  hateful earth-crawlers draw near to my Kingdom. I am positive, Kaliko,  that mortals are this very minute on their way here to annoy me--and I  hate mortals more than I do catnip tea!\"    \"Well, what's to be done?\" demanded the nome.    \"Look through your spyglass, and see where the invaders are,\" commanded  the King.    So Kaliko went to a tube in the wall of rock and put his eye to it. The  tube ran from the cavern up to the side of the mountain and turned  several curves and corners, but as it was a magic spyglass Kaliko was  able to see through it just as easily as if it had been straight.    \"Ho--hum,\" said he. \"I see 'em, Your Majesty.\"    \"What do they look like?\" inquired the Monarch.    \"That's a hard question to answer, for a queerer assortment of  creatures I never yet beheld,\" replied the nome. \"However, such a  collection of curiosities may prove dangerous. There's a copper man,  worked by machinery--\"    \"Bah! that's only Tik-Tok,\" said Ruggedo. \"I'm not afraid of him. Why,  only the other day I met the fellow and threw him down a well.\"    \"Then some one must have pulled him out again,\" said Kaliko. \"And  there's a little girl--\"    \"Dorothy?\" asked Ruggedo, jumping up in fear.    \"No; some other girl. In fact, there are several girls, of various  sizes; but Dorothy is not with them, nor is Ozma.\"    \"That's good!\" exclaimed the King, sighing in relief.    Kaliko still had his eye to the spyglass.    \"I see,\" said he, \"an army of men from Oogaboo. They are all officers  and carry swords. And there is a Shaggy Man--who seems very  harmless--and a little donkey with big ears.\"    \"Pooh!\" cried Ruggedo, snapping his fingers in scorn. \"I've no fear of  such a mob as that. A dozen of my nomes can destroy them all in a  jiffy.\"    \"I'm not so sure of that,\" said Kaliko. \"The people of Oogaboo are hard  to destroy, and I believe the Rose Princess is a fairy. As for  Polychrome, you know very well that the Rainbow's Daughter cannot be  injured by a nome.\"    \"Polychrome! Is she among them?\" asked the King.    \"Yes; I have just recognized her.\"    \"Then these people are coming here on no peaceful errand,\" declared  Ruggedo, scowling fiercely. \"In fact, no one ever comes here on a  peaceful errand. I hate everybody, and everybody hates me!\"    \"Very true,\" said Kaliko.    \"I must in some way prevent these people from reaching my dominions.  Where are they now?\"    \"Just now they are crossing the Rubber Country, Your Majesty.\"    \"Good! Are your magnetic rubber wires in working order?\"    \"I think so,\" replied Kaliko. \"Is it your Royal Will that we have some  fun with these invaders?\"    \"It is,\" answered Ruggedo. \"I want to teach them a lesson they will  never forget.\"    Now, Shaggy had no idea that he was in a Rubber Country, nor had any of  his"]]]
