Hence frost destroys those plants of our island  first, which are most succulent; and the most succulent parts first of  other plants; as their leaves and last year's shoots; the vessels of  which are distended and burst by the expansion of their freezing fluids,  while the drier or more resinous plants, as pines, yews, laurels, and  other ever-greens, are less liable to injury from cold. The trees in  vallies are on this account more injured by the vernal frosts than those  on eminencies, because their early succulent shoots come out sooner.  Hence fruit trees covered by a six-inch coping of a wall are less  injured by the vernal frosts because their being shielded from showers  and the descending night-dews has prevented them from being moist at the  time of their being frozen: which circumstance has given occasion to a  vulgar error amongst gardeners, who suppose frost to descend.    As the common heat of the earth in this climate is 48 degrees, those  tender trees which will bear bending down, are easily secured from the  frost by spreading them upon the ground, and covering them with straw or  fern. This particularly suits fig-trees, as they easily bear bending to  the ground, and are furnished with an acrid juice, which secures them  from the depredations of insects; but are nevertheless liable to be  eaten by mice.

[_In buds imprison'd_. l. 460. The buds and bulbs of plants constitute  what is termed by Linneus the Hybernaculum, or winter cradle of the  embryon vegetable. The buds arise from the bark on the branches of  trees, and the bulbs from the caudex of bulbous-rooted plants, or the  part from which the fibres of the root are produced, they are defended  from too much moisture, and from frosts, and from the depredations of  insects by various contrivances, as by scales, hairs, resinous  varnishes, and by acrid rinds.    The buds of trees are of two kinds, either flower-buds or leaf buds; the  former of these produce their seeds and die; the latter produce other  leaf buds or flower buds and die. So that all the buds of trees may be  considered as annual plants, having their embryon produced during the  preceeding summer. The same seems to happen with respect to bulbs; thus  a tulip produces annually one flower-bearing bulb, sometimes two, and  several leaf-bearing bulbs; and then the old root perishes. Next year  the flower-bearing bulb produces seeds and other bulbs and perishes;  while the leaf-bearing bulb, producing other bulbs only, perishes  likewise; these circumstances establish a strict analogy between bulbs  and buds. See additional notes, No. XIV.]    [_Viewless floods of heat_. l. 462. The fluid matter of heat, or  Calorique, in which all bodies are immersed, is as necessary to  vegetable as to animal existence. It is not yet determinable whether  heat and light be different materials, or modifications of the same  materials, as they have some properties in common. They appear to be  both of them equally necessary to vegetable health, since without light  green vegetables become first yellow, that is, they lose the blue  colour, which contributed to produce the green; and afterwards they also  lose the yellow and become white; as is seen in cellery blanched or  etiolated for the table by excluding the light from it.    The upper surface of leaves, which I suppose to be their organ of  respiration, seems to require light as well as air; since plants which  grow in windows on the inside of houses are equally sollicitous to turn  the upper side of their leaves to the light. Vegetables at the same time  exsude or perspire a great quantity from their leaves, as animals do  from their lungs; this perspirable matter as it rises from their fine  vessels, (perhaps much finer than the pores of animal skins,) is divided  into inconcievable tenuity; and when acted upon by the Sun's light  appears to be decomposed; the hydrogene becomes a part of the vegetable,  composing oils or resins; and the Oxygene combined with light or  calorique ascends, producing the pure part of the atmosphere or vital  air. Hence during the light of the day vegetables give up more pure air  than their respiration injures; but not so in the night, even though  equally exposed to warmth. This single fact would seem to shew, that  light is essentially different from heat; and it is perhaps by its  combination with bodies, that their combined or latent heat is set at  liberty, and becomes sensible. See additional note, XXXIV.]    [_Electric torrents pour_. l. 463. The influence of electricity in  forwarding the germination of plants and their growth seems to be pretty  well established; though Mr. Ingenhouz did not succeed in his  experiments, and thence doubts the success of those of others. And  though M. Rouland from his new experiments believes, that neither  positive nor negative electricity increases vegetation; both which  philosophers had previously been supporters of the contrary doctrine;  for many other naturalists have since repeated their experiments  relative to this object, and their new results have confirmed their  former ones. Mr. D'Ormoy and the two Roziers have found the same success  in numerous experiments which they have made in the last two years; and  Mr. Carmoy has shewn in a convincing manner that electricity accelerates  germination.    Mr. D'Ormoy not only found various seeds to vegetate sooner, and to grow  taller which were put upon his insulated table and supplied with  electricity, but also that silk-worms began to spin much sooner which  were kept electrified than those of the same hatch which were kept in  the same place and manner, except that they were not electrified. These  experiments of M. D'Ormoy are detailed at length in the Journal de  Physique of Rozier, Tom. XXXV. p. 270.    M. Bartholon, who had before written a tract on this subject, and  proposed ingenious methods for applying electricity to agriculture and  gardening, has also repeated a numerous set of experiments; and shews  both that natural electricity, as well as the artificial, increases the  growth of plants, and the germination of seeds; and opposes Mr.  Ingenhouz by very numerous and conclusive facts. Ib. Tom. XXXV. p. 401.    Since by the late discoveries or opinions of the Chemists there is  reason to believe that water is decomposed in the vessels of vegetables;  and that the Hydrogene or inflammable air, of which it in part consists,  contributes to the nourishment of the plant, and to the production of  its oils, rosins, gums, sugar, &c. and lastly as electricity decomposes  water into these two airs termed Oxygene and Hydrogene, there is a  powerful analogy to induce us to believe that it accelerates or  contributes to the growth of vegetation, and like heat may possibly  enter into combination with many bodies, or form the basis of some yet  unanalised acid.]             \"So shall my pines, Canadian wilds that shade,       Where no bold step has pierc'd the tangled glade,  475  High-towering palms, that part the Southern flood       With shadowy isles and continents of wood,       Oaks, whose broad antlers crest Britannia's plain,       Or bear her thunders o'er the conquer'd main,       Shout, as you pass, inhale the genial skies,  480  And bask and brighten in your beamy eyes;       Bow their white heads, admire the changing clime,       Shake from their candied trunks the tinkling rime;       With bursting buds their wrinkled barks adorn,       And wed the timorous floret to her thorn;  485  Deep strike their roots, their lengthening tops revive,       And all my world of foliage wave, alive.           \"Thus with Hermetic art the ADEPT combines       The royal acid with cobaltic mines;       Marks with quick pen, in lines unseen portrayed,  490  The blushing mead, green dell, and dusky glade;       Shades with pellucid clouds the tintless field,       And all the future Group exists conceal'd;       Till waked by fire the dawning tablet glows,       Green springs the herb, the purple floret blows,  495  Hills vales and woods in bright succession rise,       And all the living landscape charms his eyes.

On another part of the plate mix well  together with the back of the spoon two table-spoonfuls of sweet  oil, and a tea-spoonful of made mustard. Then mix the whole till  they are well incorporated and perfectly smooth, adding, at the  last, three table-spoonfuls of vinegar.    This quantity of seasoning is for a small lobster. For a large  one, more of course will be required. Many persons add a tea-spoonful  of powdered white sugar, thinking that it gives a  mellowness to the whole.    The meat of the body and claws of the lobster must be carefully  extracted from the shell and minced very small When the dressing  is smoothly and thoroughly amalgamated mix the meat with it, and  let it be handed round to the company.    The vinegar from a jar of Indian pickle is by some preferred for  lobster dressing.    You may dress the lobster immediately _before_ you send it to  table. When the dressing and meat are mixed together, pile it in a  deep dish, and smooth it with the back of a spoon. Stick a bunch  of the small claws in the top, and garnish with curled parsley.    Very large lobsters are not the best, the meat being coarse and  tough.      STEWED LOBSTER.    Having boiled the lobster, extract the meat from the shell, and  cut it into very small pieces. Season it with a powdered nutmeg, a  few blades of mace, and cayenne and salt to your taste. Mix with  it a quarter of a pound of fresh butter cut small, and two glasses  of white wine or of vinegar. Put it into a stew-pan, and set it on  hot coals. Stew it about twenty minutes, keeping the pan closely  covered lest the flavour should evaporate. Serve it up hot.    If you choose, you can send it to table in the shell, which must  first be nicely cleaned. Strew the meat over with sifted bread-crumbs,  and brown the top with a salamander, or a red hot shovel  held over it.      FRICASSEED LOBSTER.    Put the lobster into boiling salt and water, and let it boil  according to its size from a quarter of an hour to half an hour.  The intention is to have it parboiled only, as it is afterwards to  be fricasseed. Extract the meat from the shell, and cut it into  small pieces. Season it with white pepper, salt, and nutmeg; and  put it into a stew-pan with as much cream as will cover it. Keep  the lid close; set the pan on hot coals, and stew it slowly for  about as long a time as it was previously boiled. Just before you  take it from the fire, stir in the beaten yolk of an egg. Send it  to table in a small dish placed on a larger one, and arrange the  small claws nicely round it on the large dish.      POTTED LOBSTER.    Parboil the lobster in boiling water well salted. Then pick out  all the meat from the body and claws, and beat it in a mortar with  nutmeg, mace, cayenne, and salt, to your taste. Beat the coral  separately. Then put the pounded meat into a large potting can of  block tin with a cover. Press it down hard, having arranged it in  alternate layers of white meat and coral to give it a marbled or  variegated appearance. Cover it with fresh butter, and put it into  a slow oven for half an hour. When cold, take off the butter and  clarify it, by putting it into a jar, which, must be set in a pan  of boiling water. Watch it well, and when it melts, carefully skim  off the buttermilk which will rise to the top. When no more scum  rises, take it off and let it stand for a few minutes to settle,  and then strain it through a sieve.    Put the lobster into small potting-cans, pressing it down very  hard. Pour the clarified butter over it, and secure the covers  tightly.    Potted lobster is used to lay between thin slices of bread as  sandwiches. The clarified butter that accompanies it is excellent  for fish sauce.    Prawns and crabs may be potted in a similar manner.      LOBSTER PIE.    Put two middle-sized lobsters into boiling salt and water. When  they are half boiled, take the meat from the shell, cut it into  very small pieces, and put it into a pie dish. Break up the  shells, and stew them in a very little water with half a dozen  blades of mace and a wine-glass of vinegar. Then strain off the  liquid. Beat the coral in a mortar, and thicken the liquid with  it. Pour this into the dish of lobster to make the gravy. Season  it with cayenne, salt, and mushroom catchup, and add bits of  butter. Cover it with a lid of paste, made in the proportion of  half a pound of butter to a pound of flour, notched handsomely,  and ornamented with paste leaves. Do not send it to table till it  has cooled.      TO BOIL PRAWNS.    Throw a handful of salt into a pot of boiling water. When it boils  very hard, put in the prawns. Let them boil a quarter of an hour,  and when you take them out lay them on a sieve to drain, and then  wipe them on a dry cloth, and put them aside till quite cold.    Lay a handful of curled parsley in the middle of a dish. Put one  prawn on the top of it, and lay the others, all round, as close as  you can, with the tails outside. Garnish with parsley.    Eat them with salt, cayenne, sweet oil, mustard and vinegar, mixed  together as for lobsters.      CRABS    Crabs are boiled in the same manner, and in serving up may be  arranged like prawns.      HOT CRABS.    Having boiled the crabs, extract all the meat from the shell, cut  it fine, and season it to your taste with nutmeg, salt, and  cayenne pepper. Add a bit of butter, some grated bread crumbs, and  sufficient vinegar to moisten it. Fill the back-shells of the crab  with the mixture; set it before the fire, and brown it by holding  a red-hot shovel or a salamander a little above it.    Cover a large dish, with small slices of dry toast with the crust  cut off. Lay on each slice a shell filled with the crab. The shell  of one crab will contain the meat of two.      COLD CRABS.    Having taken all the meat out of the shells, make a dressing with  sweet oil, salt, cayenne pepper, mustard and vinegar, as for  lobster. You may add to it some hard-boiled yolk of egg, mashed in  the oil. Put the mixture into the back shells of the crabs, and  serve it up. Garnish with the small claws laid nicely round.      SOFT CRABS.    These crabs must be cooked directly, as they will not keep till  next day.    Remove the spongy substance from each side of the crab, and also  the little sand-bag. Put some lard into a pan, and when it is  boiling hot, fry the crabs in it. After you take them out, throw  in a handful of parsley, and let it crisp; but withdraw it before  it loses its colour. Strew it over the crabs when you dish them.    Make the gravy by adding cream or rich milk to the lard, with some  chopped parsley, pepper and salt. Let them all boil together for a  few minutes, and then serve it up in a sauce-boat.      TERRAPINS.    Have ready a pot of boiling water. When it is boiling very hard  put in the terrapins, and let them remain in it till quite dead.  Then take them out, pull off the outer skin and the toe-nails,  wash the terrapins in warm water and boil them again, allowing a  tea-spoonful of salt to each terrapin. When the flesh becomes  quite tender so that you can pinch it off, take them out of the  shell, remove the sand-bag, and the gall, which you must be  careful not to break, as it will make the terrapin so bitter as to  be uneatable. Cut up all the other parts of the inside with the  meat, and season it to your taste with black and cayenne pepper,  and salt. Put all into a stew-pan with the juice or liquor that it  has given out in cutting up, but not any water. To every two  terrapins allow a quarter of a pound of butter divided into pieces  and rolled in flour, two glasses of Madeira, and the yolks of two  eggs. The eggs must be beaten, and not stirred in till a moment  before it goes to table. Keep it closely covered. Stew it gently  till every thing is tender, and serve it up hot in a deep dish.    Terrapins, after being boiled by the cook, may be brought to table  plain, with all the condiments separate, that the company may  dress them according to taste.    For this purpose heaters or chafing-dishes must be provided for  each plate.      PICKLED LOBSTER.    Take half a dozen fine lobsters. Put them into boiling salt and  water, and when they are all done, take them out and extract all  the meat from the shells, leaving that of the claws as whole as  possible, and cutting the flesh of the body into large pieces  nearly of the same size. Season a sufficient quantity of vinegar  very highly with whole pepper-corns, whole cloves, and whole  blades of mace. Put the pieces of lobster into a stew-pan, and  pour on just sufficient vinegar to keep them well covered. Set it  over a moderate fire; and when it has boiled hard about five  minutes, take out the lobster, and let the pickle boil by itself  for a quarter of an hour. When the pickle and lobster are both  cold, put them together into a broad flat stone jar. Cover it  closely, and set it away in a cool place.    Eat the pickled lobster with oil, mustard, and vinegar, and have  bread and butter with it.          DIRECTIONS FOR COOKING MEAT.      BEEF.    GENERAL REMARKS.    When beef is good, it will have a fine smooth open grain, and it  will feel tender when squeezed or pinched in your fingers. The  lean should be of a bright carnation red, and the fat white rather  than yellow--the suet should be perfectly white. If the lean looks  dark or purplish, and the fat very yellow, do not buy the meat.    See that the butcher has properly jointed the meat before it goes  home. For good tables, the pieces generally roasted are the  sirloin and the fore and middle ribs. In genteel houses other  parts are seldom served up as _roast-beef_. In small families  the ribs are the most convenient pieces. A whole sirloin is too  large, except for a numerous company, but it is the piece most  esteemed.    The best beef-steaks are those cut from the ribs, or "]]]
