He  was followed by Major Blackwater, the captain of artillery, and  Adjutant Lawson.    \"Are the garrison all present, Mr. Lawson? are the officers all  present?\"    \"All except those of the guard, sir,\" replied the Adjutant, touching  his hat with a submission that was scrupulously exacted on all  occasions of duty by his superior.    The Governor passed his hand for a moment over his brows. It seemed to  those around him as if the mention of that guard had called up  recollections which gave him pain; and it might be so, for his eldest  son, Captain Frederick de Haldimar, had commanded the guard. Whither he  had disappeared, or in what manner, no one knew.    \"Are the artillery all present, Captain Wentworth?\" again demanded the  Governor, after a moment of silence, and in his wonted firm  authoritative voice.    \"All present, sir,\" rejoined the officer, following the example of the  Adjutant, and saluting his chief.    \"Then let a drum-head court-martial be assembled immediately, Mr.  Lawson, and without reference to the roster let the senior officers be  selected.\"    The Adjutant went round to the respective divisions, and in a low voice  warned Captain Blessington, and the four senior subalterns, for that  duty. One by one the officers, as they were severally called upon, left  their places in the square, and sheathing their swords, stepped into  that part of the area appointed as their temporary court. They were now  all assembled, and Captain Blessington, the senior of his rank in the  garrison, was preparing to administer the customary oaths, when the  prisoner Halloway advanced a pace or two in front of his escort, and  removing his cap, in a clear, firm, but respectful voice, thus  addressed the Governor:--    \"Colonel de Haldimar, that I am no traitor, as I have already told you,  the Almighty God, before whom I swore allegiance to his Majesty, can  bear me witness. Appearances, I own, are against me; but, so far from  being a traitor, I would have shed my last drop of blood in defence of  the garrison and your family.--Colonel de Haldimar,\" he pursued, after  a momentary pause, in which he seemed to be struggling to subdue the  emotion which rose, despite of himself, to his throat, \"I repeat, I am  no traitor, and I scorn the imputation--but here is my best answer to  the charge. This wound, (and he unbuttoned his jacket, opened his  shirt, and disclosed a deep scar upon his white chest,) this wound I  received in defence of my captain's life at Quebec. Had I not loved  him, I should not so have exposed myself, neither but for that should I  now stand in the situation of shame and danger, in which my comrades  behold me.\"    Every heart was touched by this appeal--this bold and manly appeal to  the consideration of the Governor. The officers, especially, who were  fully conversant with the general merit of Halloway, were deeply  affected, and Charles de Haldimar--the young, the generous, the feeling  Charles de Haldimar,--even shed tears.    \"What mean you, prisoner?\" interrogated the Governor, after a short  pause, during which he appeared to be weighing and deducing inferences  from the expressions just uttered. \"What mean you, by stating, but for  that (alluding to your regard for Captain de Haldimar) you would not  now be in this situation of shame and danger?\"    The prisoner hesitated a moment; and then rejoined, but in a tone that  had less of firmness in it than before,--\"Colonel de Haldimar, I am not  at liberty to state my meaning; for, though a private soldier, I  respect my word, and have pledged myself to secrecy.\"    \"You respect your word, and have pledged yourself to secrecy! What mean  you, man, by this rhodomontade? To whom can you have pledged yourself,  and for what, unless it be to some secret enemy without the walls?  Gentlemen, proceed to your duty: it is evident that the man is a  traitor, even from his own admission.--On my life,\" he pursued, more  hurriedly, and speaking in an under tone, as if to himself, \"the fellow  has been bribed by, and is connected with--.\" The name escaped not his  lips; for, aware of the emotion he was betraying, he suddenly checked  himself, and assumed his wonted stern and authoritative bearing.    Once more the prisoner addressed the Governor in the same clear firm  voice in which he had opened his appeal.    \"Colonel de Haldimar, I have no connection with any living soul without  the fort; and again I repeat, I am no traitor, but a true and loyal  British soldier, as my services in this war, and my comrades, can well  attest. Still, I seek not to shun that death which I have braved a  dozen times at least in the ---- regiment. All that I ask is, that I  may not be tried--that I may not have the shame of hearing sentence  pronounced against me YET; but if nothing should occur before eight  o'clock to vindicate my character from this disgrace, I will offer up  no further prayer for mercy. In the name of that life, therefore, which  I once preserved to Captain de Haldimar, at the price of my own blood,  I entreat a respite from trial until then.\"    \"In the name of God and all his angels, let mercy reach your soul, and  grant his prayer!\"    Every ear was startled--every heart touched by the plaintive,  melancholy, silver tones of the voice that faintly pronounced the last  appeal, and all recognised it for that of the young, interesting, and  attached wife of the prisoner. Again the latter turned his gaze towards  the window whence the sounds proceeded, and by the glare of the torches  a tear was distinctly seen by many coursing down his manly cheek. The  weakness was momentary. In the next instant he closed his shirt and  coat, and resuming his cap, stepped back once more amid his guard,  where he remained stationary, with the air of one who, having nothing  further to hope, has resolved to endure the worst that can happen with  resignation and fortitude.    After the lapse of a few moments, again devoted to much apparent deep  thought and conjecture, the Governor once more, and rather hurriedly,  resumed,--    \"In the event, prisoner, of this delay in your trial being granted,  will you pledge yourself to disclose the secret to which you have  alluded? Recollect, there is nothing but that which can save your  memory from being consigned to infamy for ever; for who, among your  comrades, will believe the idle denial of your treachery, when there is  the most direct proof against you? If your secret die with you,  moreover, every honest man will consider it as having been one so  infamous and injurious to your character, that you were ashamed to  reveal it.\"    These suggestions of the Colonel were not without their effect; for, in  the sudden swelling of the prisoner's chest, as allusion was made to  the disgrace that would attach to his memory, there was evidence of a  high and generous spirit, to whom obloquy was far more hateful than  even death itself.    \"I do promise,\" he at length replied, stepping forward, and uncovering  himself as before,--\"if no one appear to justify my conduct at the hour  I have named, a full disclosure of all I know touching this affair  shall be made. And may God, of his infinite mercy, grant, for Captain  de Haldimar's sake, as well as mine, I may not then be wholly deserted!\"    There was something so peculiarly solemn and impressive in the manner  in which the unhappy man now expressed himself, that a feeling of the  utmost awe crept into the bosoms of the surrounding throng; and more  than one veteran of the grenadiers, the company to which Halloway  belonged, was heard to relieve his chest of the long pent-up sigh that  struggled for release.    \"Enough, prisoner,\" rejoined the Governor; \"on this condition do I  grant your request; but recollect,--your disclosure ensures no hope of  pardon, unless, indeed, you have the fullest proof to offer in your  defence. Do you perfectly understand me?\"    \"I do,\" replied the soldier firmly; and again he placed his cap on his  head, and retired a step or two back among the guard.    \"Mr. Lawson, let the prisoner be removed, and conducted to one of the  private cells. Who is the subaltern of the guard?\"    \"Ensign Fortescue,\" was the answer.    \"Then let Ensign Fortescue keep the key of the cell himself. Tell him,  moreover, I shall hold him individually responsible for his charge.\"    Once more the prisoner was marched out of the area; and, as the  clanking sound of his chains became gradually fainter in the distance,  the same voice that had before interrupted the proceedings, pronounced  a \"God be praised!--God be praised!\" with such melody of sorrow in its  intonations that no one could listen to it unmoved. Both officers and  men were more or less affected, and all hoped--they scarcely knew why  or what--but all hoped something favourable would occur to save the  life of the brave and unhappy Frank Halloway.    Of the first interruption by the wife of the prisoner the Governor had  taken no notice; but on this repetition of the expression of her  feelings he briefly summoned, in the absence of the Adjutant, the  sergeant-major of the regiment to his side.    \"Sergeant-major Bletson, I desire that, in future, on all occasions of  this kind, the women of the regiment may be kept out of the way. Look  to it, sir!\"    The sergeant-major, who had stood erect as his own halbert, which he  held before him in a saluting position, during this brief admonition of  his colonel, acknowledged, by a certain air of deferential respect and  dropping of the eyes, unaccompanied by speech of any kind, that he felt  the reproof, and would, in future, take care to avoid all similar cause  for complaint. He then stalked stiffly away, and resumed, in a few  hasty strides, his position in rear of the troops.    \"Hard-hearted man!\" pursued the same"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49131"],[0,"Wings over England (#9)"],[1,"k.    When the cobbler opened the door to retrace his steps, Flash, the  collie, who had come up as a sort of vanguard to Alice, put his nose in  at the cobbler's door, gave a long sniff, then uttered a low growl.    \"Well now, I wonder what he means by that?\" Dave thought as he hurried  away to join Alice.    That night, after the others had retired, Mrs. Ramsey, Dave and Brand  sat for a long time silently watching the fading glow of the wood fire.    \"Mother,\" Brand said suddenly, \"I'd like to join the Royal Air Force.\"    \"Oh! No!\" The mother's words came short and quick. \"You are needed here.  Besides, there's little enough for our aviators to do now. After the  beating up we gave them, the Jerries, as you call them, are only coming  over at night. You can't find them at night. That's work for the  anti-aircraft batteries.\"    \"I'm not so sure of that,\" Brand murmured beneath his breath. \"But  mother,\" his voice rose, \"the Huns may come over, a million of them, by  air and sea, perhaps tomorrow. We must be prepared!\"    \"And we must be fed,\" his mother replied quietly. \"Perhaps later--\" She  did not finish. She knew a great deal about war, did the brave-hearted  English mother.    \"Wars,\" said David, speaking before he thought, \"are wrong. There should  be no wars.\"    Instantly the woman's slow, steady gaze was upon him. \"She's angry with  me,\" he thought. His lips were parted for the words, \"I'm sorry.\"    But she spoke first. \"You are exactly right, David. Wars are terrible. I  should know. Wars have cost me those I loved far more than life. Now  another war may cost me my son, and perhaps my daughters.    \"Some of us,\" she went on, \"did what we could to prevent this war. We  failed. Why? Perhaps none of us will ever know for sure.    \"However,\" her voice was steady and sure, \"we have a war. We have no  choice but to fight it. We must fight or be enslaved. Our enemy has left  no room for doubt there. England has always been free.\"    After that for some time, save for the slow, steady  tick--tock--tick--tock of the dependable old English clock in the  corner, there was silence in the great room.    Later, as they stood outside beneath the stars, Brand told Dave that for  more than a year the Young Lord had been training him, teaching him how  to become a fighter. \"And he's a real fighter himself, you may be sure  of that.\" His voice was low and strong. \"He's no braggart like some of  those flying Huns. He has a real record all the same. He flew in France  during the Blitzkrieg. Sometimes it was ten Messerschmitts to his one  Hurricane. He got two of them. That was just one time. There were many  others. You just wait!\" His voice rose sharply. \"I'll be right up there  beside him in a Tomahawk one of these days!\"    Would he? Dave wondered.                                        _Chapter_ X                                First Blood      Next day, just after lunch, feeling very much like a small boy slipping  away to go fishing, Dave made his way toward the airdrome. He wanted, he  told himself, to study a Spitfire. He had seen that one in action over  the farm on the day of that air battle. It had fascinated him. Truth  was, he hoped to run across the Young Lord and perhaps to be invited for  one more ride in that two-seater. There was, he realized, a slight  element of danger in such an excursion, just enough to give it tang,  like a frosty morning.    He was not to be disappointed. Lieutenant Applegate was just having the  machine rolled out.    \"Greetings!\" he cried. \"Just in time! But then,\" his voice changed. \"I  must not tempt you too much. This, you will understand, is our life. It  is easy to ask too much of one who is not in on the great game.\"    \"I'll be glad to go up again,\" Dave said quietly. \"To tell you the  truth, that's what I had hoped to do.\"    \"Righto! Climb in!\" Applegate exclaimed. \"You see,\" he added, \"we're  just giving this ship a tryout. Perhaps after we've done a stretch of  patrol, we'll ask the ground crew to run up a sky target and I'll let  you have a try at it with a few bursts of machine gun fire.\"    \"Oh!\" Dave caught his breath sharply. But if he had known!    \"We've always got more men than ships,\" Applegate went on. \"So if two  men in a ship like this, by dividing the things to worry about, like  dials, controls, gun-sights and all, can accomplish more than one, why  then, that's the berries. What say? Shall we be away?\"    Dave nodded. Then they were off and away into the blue.    As on that other day, the sky was magnificent--bright blue, with clouds  like huge cotton balls floating through it. Dave could not recall a  moment in his life he had enjoyed so much. There was the thrill of  speeding through space at three hundred and better miles an hour, and of  looking down upon a world that was entirely new to him. Added to this--a  real dash of red pepper--was the possibility that they might--just might  bump into an enemy craft. Did he wish the last? He could not tell.  Flying was strange. It was like a game, basketball or football--you went  into it cold. As your blood warmed, a certain reckless daring came over  you. You didn't will it, perhaps did not, in your sober moments, so much  as want it. It was there, and for the time being you could but yield to  its urge.    Today it was just like that. Now diving into a fleecy cloud, they were  lost to the entire world. But not for long. Like a dove flying from a  cloud in a picture postcard, they glided once more into the bright  sunshine.    Little patches and squares, forests, fields, homesteads, lovely villages  all lay beneath them.    Seized with a sudden impulse, Dave spoke hoarsely into his mouthpiece:  \"Let me take her for a minute.\" Ten seconds later he was working the  joystick and Applegate, like an old lady in a wheelchair, was lolling  back in his place.    But not for long. Suddenly Applegate straightened up, shaded his eyes,  stared straight ahead, reached for his field glass, looked again, then  said in a cheerful voice:    \"See that long white cloud over to the left?\"    \"Ye--yes.\" Dave's heart pounded, he scarcely knew why.    \"Swing over into it, then stay in it, going straight down it toward the  channel. It must be all of four miles long. I--I rather smell a Hun.\"    Dave obeyed instructions. The world was again lost to view.    Their journey along that cloud could scarcely have lasted two minutes,  but to Dave that seemed a long, long hour. What was beyond the other end  of the cloud? Something, he was sure. Did it mean a fight? He hadn't  counted on that. This was not his war. Was he sorry? He did not know.  The ways of a human mind are past finding out.    Then, as if their plane had given a sudden leap, they were out of the  cloud. And there, off a little to the right, was a dark spot against the  blue of the sky.    The Lieutenant made one gesture, a stiff arm, pointing. That was all.    They were a full ten minutes coming within striking distance of that  large plane. Every second of that exciting race Dave expected his  companion to take over his controls, and all the time he remained  silent, impassive.    At last, in a calm, even tone, he spoke: \"That's a Dornier. London took  a terrific beating last night. Many women and children were killed or  injured. That Dornier's been taking pictures so they can find fresh  spots to bomb. His pictures must not reach Allemond. We must get him.\"  His words were like rasping steel. Even then he did not take the  controls.    A strange, cold wrath took possession of Dave's entire being. \"Women and  children killed and injured.\" He did not want the Young Lord to take the  controls. And he knew what was to be done. He wanted to do it, at all  risks.    Dropping a little below the flying level of the Dornier, he added a  little speed, then streaked straight on. His heart was pounding, but his  head was clear. At last, having risen to the attack, they were within  striking distance.    \"It's football,\" he was thinking calmly. \"That Dornier's got the ball.  But in the end, it'll be thrown for a loss.\"    Even as he thought this, the Dornier banked sharply to soar away to the  left. At the same time the air was ripped,--rat--rat--rat. The side  shots from the Dornier went wild.    Once again they were after the foe. Once more they were all but upon the  enemy's tail when he swung sharply to the left. From the Dornier's side  came a wild burst of gunfire.    \"Wasting his slugs,\" Applegate exulted. \"Keep right after him.\" His hand  was on the firing button. One push and eight guns would spray death,  nearly ten thousand shots a minute. He could wait. It took just ten  seconds when everything was right.    On the tip of Dave's tongue were the words; \"Here, take the controls.\"  He did not say them. His tongue would not waggle that way.    The Dornier took a nose-dive. When he came out of it the two-seater was  with him. He tried climbing. No use. They could outclimb him, two to  one.    Once again he straightened out, then curved to the right.    Recalling how so very often a football runner will repeat a pattern, a  dash to the right, one to left, then straight ahead, Dave worked out a  plan. Would it succeed? Only time, a terribly short time, could tell.    True to his pattern the Dornier pilot banked first right, then left, and  after that went into a power dive.    Measuring this dive with greatest accuracy, Dave managed to come out of  his own dive just in time to glide squarely up on the enemy's tail.    Squinting through his sight, the Lieutenant gripped his gun control and  waited. Dave found himself counting, \"One--two--three.\" Then came a  sudden burst of sound that all but startled him into a tail spin.    Regaining his control, he shot heavenward.    The Dornier had received a ten-second burst of gunfire, hundreds of  slugs, straight down her pencil-like fuselage. What would be the result?  They must wait and see.    The Dornier lost its steady,"]]]
