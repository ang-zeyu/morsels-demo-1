A  willow, which had been the exile's favourite, and under which he had  often enjoyed the fresh breeze, was torn up by the hurricane; and almost  all the trees about Longwood shared the same fate.    The 5th of May came amid wind and rain. Napoleon's passing spirit was  deliriously engaged in a strife more terrible than that of the elements  around. The words \"_tete d'armee_\" the last which escaped his lips,  intimated that his thoughts were watching the current of a heady fight.  About eleven minutes before six in the evening, Napoleon, after a  struggle which indicated the original strength of his constitution,  breathed his last.      HIS FUNERAL.    Bonaparte was buried on the 8th of May, in a small secluded recess  called Slane's, or Haine's Valley, where a fountain arose, at which his  Chinese domestics used to fill the silver pitchers, which they carried  to Longwood for Napoleon's use. \"All the troops were under arms upon the  solemn occasion. As the road did not permit a near approach of the  hearse to the place of sepulture, a party of British grenadiers had the  honour to bear the coffin to the grave. The prayers were recited by the  priest, Abbe Vignali. Minute guns were fired from the admiral's ship.  The coffin was then let down into the grave, under a discharge of three  successive volleys of artillery, fifteen pieces of cannon firing fifteen  guns each. A large stone was then lowered down on the grave, and covered  the moderate space now sufficient for the man for whom Europe was once  too little.\"           *       *       *       *       *    _Printed and published by J.

'His  simplicity and humility, his uprightness and saintliness.'\"    And with this eulogy of the aged Rabbi of Barcelona, the poem somewhat  inconsequently ends. It may be that the author left the work without  putting in the finishing touches. This would account for the extra stories,  which, as was seen above, may belong to the book, though not incorporated  into it.    It will be thought, from the summary mode in which I have rendered these  stories, that I take Zabara to be rather a literary curiosity than a poet.  But Zabara's poetical merits are considerable. If I have refrained from  attempting a literal rendering, it is mainly because the rhymed-prose  _genre_ is so characteristically Oriental that its charm is incommunicable  in a Western language. Hence, to those who do not read Zabara in the  original, he is more easily appreciated as a _conteur_ than as an  imaginative writer. To the Hebraist, too, something of the same remark  applies. Rhymed prose is not much more consistent with the genius of Hebrew  than it is with the genius of English. Arabic and Persian seem the only  languages in which rhymed prose assumes a natural and melodious shape. In  the new-Hebrew, rhymed prose has always been an exotic, never quite a  native flower. The most skilful gardeners failed to acclimatize it  thoroughly in European soil. Yet Zabara's humor, his fluent simplicity, his  easy mastery over Hebrew, his invention, his occasional gleams of fancy,  his gift of satire, his unfailing charm, combine to give his poem some  right to the title by which he called it--\"The Book of Delight.\"          A VISIT TO HEBRON      Of a land where every stone has its story, it can hardly be asserted that  any one place has a fuller tale to tell than another. But Hebron has a  peculiar old-world charm as the home of the founder of the Hebrew race.  Moreover, one's youthful imagination associates Hebron with the giants, the  sons of Anak, sons, that is, of the long neck; men of Arba, with broad,  square shoulders. A sight of the place itself revives this memory. Ancient  Hebron stood higher than the present city, but as things now are, though  the hills of Judea reach their greatest elevation in the neighborhood,  Hebron itself rests in a valley. Most towns in Palestine are built on  hills, but Hebron lies low. Yet the surrounding hills are thirty-two  hundred feet above the level of the Mediterranean, and five hundred feet  higher than Mount Olivet. For this reason Hebron is ideally placed for  conveying an impression of the mountainous character of Judea. In Jerusalem  you are twenty-six hundred feet above the sea, but, being high up, you  scarcely realize that you are in a mountain city. The hills about Hebron  tower loftily above you, and seem a fitting abode for the giants whom  Joshua and Caleb overthrew.    Hebron, from yet another point of view, recalls its old-world associations.  Not only is Hebron one of the oldest cities in the world still inhabited,  but it has been far less changed by Western influences than other famous  places. Hebron is almost entirely unaffected by Christian influence. In the  East, Christian influence more or less means European influence, but Hebron  is still completely Oriental. It is a pity that modern travellers no longer  follow the ancient route which passed from Egypt along the coast to Gaza,  and then struck eastwards to Hebron. By this route, the traveller would  come upon Judea in its least modernized aspect. He would find in Hebron a  city without a hotel, and unblessed by an office of the Monarch of the  East, Mr. Cook. There are no modern schools in Hebron; the only institution  of the kind, the Mildmay Mission School, had scarcely any pupils at the  time of my visit. This is but another indication of the slight effect that  European forces are producing; the most useful, so far, has been the  medical mission of the United Free Church of Scotland. But Hebron has been  little receptive of the educational and sanitary boons that are the chief  good--and it is a great good--derived from the European missions in the  East. I am almost reluctant to tell the truth, as I must, of Hebron, and  point out the pitiful plight of our brethren there, lest, perchance, some  philanthropists set about mending the evil, to the loss of the  primitiveness in which Hebron at present revels. This is the pity of it.  When you employ a modern broom to sweep away the dirt of an ancient city,  your are apt to remove something else as well as the dirt.    Besides its low situation and its primitiveness, Hebron has a third  peculiarity. Go where one may in Judea, the ancient places, even when still  inhabited, wear a ruined look. Zion itself is scarcely an exception.  Despite its fifty thousand inhabitants, Jerusalem has a decayed appearance,  for the newest buildings often look like ruins. The cause of this is that  many structures are planned on a bigger scale than can be executed, and  thus are left permanently unfinished, or like the windmill of Sir Moses are  disused from their very birth. Hebron, in this respect again, is unlike the  other cities of Judea. It had few big buildings, hence it has few big  ruins. There are some houses of two stories in which the upper part has  never been completed, but the houses are mostly of one story, with  partially flat and partially domed roofs. The domes are the result both of  necessity and design; of necessity, because of the scarcity of large beams  for rafters; of design, because the dome enables the rain to collect in a  groove, or channel, whence it sinks into a reservoir.    Hebron, then, produces a favorable impression on the whole. It is green and  living, its hills are clad with vines, with plantations of olives,  pomegranates, figs, quinces, and apricots. Nowhere in Judea, except in the  Jordan valley, is there such an abundance of water. In the neighborhood of  Hebron, there are twenty-five springs, ten large perennial wells, and  several splendid pools. Still, as when the huge cluster was borne on two  men's shoulders from Eshkol, the best vines of Palestine grow in and around  Hebron. The only large structure in the city, the mosque which surmounts  the Cave of Machpelah, is in excellent repair, especially since 1894-5,  when the Jewish lads from the _Alliance_ school of Jerusalem renewed the  iron gates within, and supplied fresh rails to the so-called sarcophagi of  the Patriarchs. The ancient masonry built round the cave by King Herod, the  stones of which exactly resemble the masonry of the Wailing Place in  Jerusalem, still stands in its massive strength.    I have said that Hebron ought to be approached from the South or West. The  modern traveller, however, reaches it from the North. You leave Jerusalem  by the Jaffa gate, called by the Mohammedans Bab el-Khalil, _i.e._ Hebron  gate. The Mohammedans call Hebron el-Khalil, City of the Friend of God, a  title applied to Abraham both in Jewish and Mohammedan tradition. Some,  indeed, derive the name Hebron from Chaber, comrade or friend; but Hebron  may mean \"confederation of cities,\" just as its other name, Kiriath-arba,  may possibly mean Tetrapolis. The distance from Jerusalem to Hebron depends  upon the views of the traveller. You can easily get to Hebron in four hours  and a half by the new carriage road, but the distance, though less than  twenty miles, took me fourteen hours, from five in the morning till seven  at night. Most travellers turn aside to the left to see the Pools of  Solomon, and the grave of Rachel lies on the right of the highroad itself.  It is a modern building with a dome, and the most affecting thing is the  rough-hewn block of stone worn smooth by the lips of weeping women. On the  opposite side of the road is Tekoah, the birthplace of Amos; before you  reach it, five miles more to the north, you get a fine glimpse also of  Bethlehem, the White City, cleanest of Judean settlements. Travellers tell  you that the rest of the road is uninteresting. I did not find it so. For  the motive of my journey was just to see those \"uninteresting\" sites,  Beth-zur, where Judas Maccabeus won such a victory that he was able to  rededicate the Temple, and Beth-zacharias, through whose broad valley-roads  the Syrian elephants wound their heavy way, to drive Judas back on his  precarious base at the capital.    It is somewhat curious that this indifference to the Maccabean sites is not  restricted to Christian tourists. For, though several Jewish travellers  passed from Jerusalem to Hebron in the Middle Ages, none of them mentions  the Maccabean sites, none of them spares a tear or a cheer for Judas  Maccabeus. They were probably absorbed in the memory of the Patriarchs and  of King David, the other and older names identified with this district.  Medieval fancy, besides, was too busy with peopling Hebron with myths to  waste itself on sober facts. Hebron, according to a very old notion, was  the place where Adam and Eve lived after their expulsion from Eden; it was  from Hebron's red earth that the first man was made. The _Pirke di Rabbi  Eliezer_ relate, that when the three angels visited Abraham, and he went to  get a lamb for their meal, the animal fled into a cave. Abraham followed  it, and saw Adam and Eve lying asleep, with lamps burning by their tombs,  and a sweet savor, as of incense, emanating from the dead father and mother  of human-kind. Abraham conceived a love for the Cave, and hence desired it  for Sarah's resting-place.    I suppose that some will hold, that we are not on surer historical ground  when we come to the Biblical statement that connects Abraham with Hebron.  Before arguing whether Abraham lived in Hebron, and was buried in  Machpelah, one ought to prove that Abraham ever lived at all, to be buried  anywhere. But I shall venture to take Abraham's real existence for granted,  as I am not one of those who think that a statement must be false because  it is made "]]]
