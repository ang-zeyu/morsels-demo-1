It was  more for his own private satisfaction than for the furtherance of  justice that he wished to track the offenders down. But he did not  look on the affair, as Jimmy Silver did, as rather sporting; he had  a tender feeling for the good name of the school, and he felt that  it was not likely to make Eckleton popular with the other schools  that went to camp if they got the reputation of practical jokers.  Practical jokers are seldom popular until they have been dead a  hundred years or so.    As for Walton and his colleagues, to complete the list of those who  were interested in this matter of the midnight raid, they lay  remarkably low after their successful foray. They imagined that  Kennedy was spying on their every movement. In which they were quite  wrong, for Kennedy was doing nothing of the kind. Camp does not allow  a great deal of leisure for the minding of other people's businesses.  But this reflection did not occur to Walton, and he regarded Kennedy,  whenever chance or his duties brought him into the neighbourhood of  that worthy's tent, with a suspicion which increased whenever the  latter looked at him.    On the night before camp broke up, a second incident of a sensational  kind occurred, which, but for the fact that they never heard of it,  would have given the schools a good deal to talk about. It happened  that Kennedy was on sentry-go that night. The manner of sentry-go is  thus. At seven in the evening the guard falls in, and patrols the  fringe of the camp in relays till seven in the morning. A guard  consists of a sergeant, a corporal, and ten men. They are on duty for  two hours at a time, with intervals of four hours between each spell,  in which intervals they sleep the sleep of tired men in the  guard-tent, unless, as happened on the occasion previously described,  some miscreant takes it upon himself to loose the ropes. The ground to  be patrolled by the sentries is divided into three parts, each of  which is entrusted to one man.    Kennedy was one of the ten privates, and his first spell of sentry-go  began at eleven o'clock.    On this night there was no moon. It was as black as pitch. It is  always unpleasant to be on sentry-go on such a night. The mind  wanders, in spite of all effort to check it, through a long series of  all the ghastly stories one has ever read. There is one in particular  of Conan Doyle's about a mummy that came to life and chased people on  lonely roads--but enough! However courageous one may be, it is  difficult not to speculate on the possible horrors which may spring  out on one from the darkness. That feeling that there is somebody--or  something--just behind one can only be experienced in all its force by  a sentry on an inky night at camp. And the thought that, of all the  hundreds there, he and two others are the only ones awake, puts a sort  of finishing touch to the unpleasantness of the situation.    Kennedy was not a particularly imaginative youth, but he looked  forward with no little eagerness to the time when he should be  relieved. It would be a relief in two senses of the word. His beat  included that side of the camp which faces the road to Aldershot.  Between camp and this road is a ditch and a wood. After he had been on  duty for an hour this wood began to suggest a variety of  possibilities, all grim. The ditch, too, was not without associations.  It was into this that Private Jones had been hurled on a certain  memorable occasion. Such a thing was not likely to happen again in the  same week, and, even if it did, Kennedy flattered himself that he  would have more to say in the matter than Private Jones had had; but  nevertheless he kept a careful eye in that direction whenever his beat  took him along the ditch.    It was about half-past twelve, and he had entered upon the last  section of his two hours, when Kennedy distinctly heard footsteps in  the wood. He had heard so many mysterious sounds since his patrol  began at eleven o'clock that at first he was inclined to attribute  this to imagination. But a crackle of dead branches and the sound of  soft breathing convinced him that this was the real thing for once,  and that, as a sentry of the Public Schools' Camp on duty, it behoved  him to challenge the unknown.    He stopped and waited, peering into the darkness in a futile endeavour  to catch a glimpse of his man. But the night was too black for the  keenest eye to penetrate it. A slight thud put him on the right track.  It showed him two things; first, that the unknown had dropped into the  ditch, and, secondly, that he was a camp man returning to his tent  after an illegal prowl about the town at lights-out. Nobody save one  belonging to the camp would have cause to cross the ditch.    Besides, the man walked warily, as one not ignorant of the danger of  sentries. The unknown had crawled out of the ditch now. As luck would  have it he had chosen a spot immediately opposite to where Kennedy  stood. Now that he was nearer Kennedy could see the vague outline of  him.    \"Who goes there?\" he said.    From an instinctive regard for the other's feelings he did not shout  the question in the regulation manner. He knew how he would feel  himself if he were out of camp at half-past twelve, and the voice of  the sentry were to rip suddenly through the silence _fortissimo_.    As it was, his question was quite loud enough to electrify the person  to whom it was addressed. The unknown started so violently that he  nearly leapt into the air. Kennedy was barely two yards from him when  he spoke.    The next moment this fact was brought home to him in a very practical  manner. The unknown, sighting the sentry, perhaps more clearly against  the dim whiteness of the tents than Kennedy could sight him against  the dark wood, dashed in with a rapidity which showed that he knew  something of the art of boxing. Kennedy dropped his rifle and flung up  his arm. He was altogether too late. A sudden blaze of light, and he  was on the ground, sick and dizzy, a feeling he had often experienced  before in a slighter degree, when sparring in the Eckleton gymnasium  with the boxing instructor.    The immediate effect of a flush hit in the regions about the jaw is to  make the victim lose for the moment all interest in life. Kennedy lay  where he had fallen for nearly half a minute before he fully realised  what it was that had happened to him. When he did realise the  situation, he leapt to his feet, feeling sick and shaky, and staggered  about in all directions in a manner which suggested that he fancied  his assailant would be waiting politely until he had recovered. As was  only natural, that wily person had vanished, and was by this time  doing a quick change into garments of the night. Kennedy had the  satisfaction of knowing--for what it was worth--that his adversary was  in one of those tents, but to place him with any greater accuracy was  impossible.    So he gave up the search, found his rifle, and resumed his patrol. And  at one o'clock his successor relieved him.    On the following day camp broke up.           *       *       *       *       *    Kennedy always enjoyed going home, but, as he travelled back to  Eckleton on the last day of these summer holidays, he could not help  feeling that there was a great deal to be said for term. He felt  particularly cheerful. He had the carriage to himself, and he had also  plenty to read and eat. The train was travelling at forty miles an  hour. And there were all the pleasures of a first night after the  holidays to look forward to, when you dashed from one friend's study  to another's, comparing notes, and explaining--five or six of you at a  time--what a good time you had had in the holidays. This was always a  pleasant ceremony at Blackburn's, where all the prefects were intimate  friends, and all good sorts, without that liberal admixture of weeds,  worms, and outsiders which marred the list of prefects in most of the  other houses. Such as Kay's! Kennedy could not restrain a momentary  gloating as he contrasted the state of affairs in Blackburn's with  what existed at Kay's. Then this feeling was merged in one of pity for  Fenn's hard case. How he must hate the beginning of term, thought  Kennedy.    All the well-known stations were flashing by now. In a few minutes he  would be at the junction, and in another half-hour back at  Blackburn's. He began to collect his baggage from the rack.    Nobody he knew was at the junction. This was the late train that he  had come down by. Most of the school had returned earlier in the  afternoon.    He reached Blackburn's at eight o'clock, and went up to his study to  unpack. This was always his first act on coming back to school. He  liked to start the term with all his books in their shelves, and all  his pictures and photographs in their proper places on the first day.  Some of the studies looked like lumber-rooms till near the end of the  first week.    He had filled the shelves, and was arranging the artistic decorations,  when Jimmy Silver came in. Kennedy had been surprised that he had not  met him downstairs, but the matron had answered his inquiry with the  statement that he was talking to Mr Blackburn in the other part of the  house.    \"When did you arrive?\" asked Silver, after the conclusion of the first  outbreak of holiday talk.    \"I've only just come.\"    \"Seen Blackburn yet?\"    \"No. I was thinking of going up after I had got this place done  properly.\"    Jimmy Silver ran his eye over the room.    \"I haven't started mine yet,\" he said. \"You're such an energetic man.  Now, are all those books in their proper places?\"    \"Yes,\" said Kennedy.    \"Sure?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"How about the pictures? Got them up?\"    \"All but this lot here. Shan't be a second. There you are. How's that  for effect?\"    \"Not bad. Got all your photographs in their places?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then,\" said Jimmy Silver, calmly, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6879"],[0,"The Gold Bat (#9)"],[1,"competition, was  now no longer eligible for that class. O'Hara had not been up before,  but the Wrykyn instructor, a good judge of pugilistic form, was of  opinion that he ought to stand an excellent chance. As the prize-fighter  in _Rodney Stone_ says, \"When you get a good Irishman, you can't  better 'em, but they're dreadful 'asty.\" O'Hara was attending the  gymnasium every night, in order to learn to curb his \"dreadful  'astiness\", and acquire skill in its place.    \"I wonder if Trevor would be any good in a row,\" said Moriarty.    \"He can't box,\" said O'Hara, \"but he'd go on till he was killed  entirely. I say, I'm getting rather tired of sitting here, aren't you?  Let's go to the other end of the passage and have some cricket.\"    So, having unearthed a piece of wood from the debris at the top of the  cupboard, and rolled a handkerchief into a ball, they adjourned.    Recalling the stirring events of six years back, when the League had  first been started, O'Hara remembered that the members of that  enterprising society had been wont to hold meetings in a secluded spot,  where it was unlikely that they would be disturbed. It seemed to him  that the first thing he ought to do, if he wanted to make their nearer  acquaintance now, was to find their present rendezvous. They must have  one. They would never run the risk involved in holding mass-meetings in  one another's studies. On the last occasion, it had been an old quarry  away out on the downs. This had been proved by the not-to-be-shaken  testimony of three school-house fags, who had wandered out one  half-holiday with the unconcealed intention of finding the League's  place of meeting. Unfortunately for them, they _had_ found it.  They were going down the path that led to the quarry before-mentioned,  when they were unexpectedly seized, blindfolded, and carried off. An  impromptu court-martial was held--in whispers--and the three explorers  forthwith received the most spirited \"touching-up\" they had ever  experienced. Afterwards they were released, and returned to their house  with their zeal for detection quite quenched. The episode had created a  good deal of excitement in the school at the time.    On three successive afternoons, O'Hara and Moriarty scoured the downs,  and on each occasion they drew blank. On the fourth day, just before  lock-up, O'Hara, who had been to tea with Gregson, of Day's, was  going over to the gymnasium to keep a pugilistic appointment with  Moriarty, when somebody ran swiftly past him in the direction of the  boarding-houses. It was almost dark, for the days were still short,  and he did not recognise the runner. But it puzzled him a little to  think where he had sprung from. O'Hara was walking quite close to the  wall of the College buildings, and the runner had passed between it and  him. And he had not heard his footsteps. Then he understood, and his  pulse quickened as he felt that he was on the track. Beneath the block  was a large sort of cellar-basement. It was used as a store-room for  chairs, and was never opened except when prize-day or some similar event  occurred, when the chairs were needed. It was supposed to be locked at  other times, but never was. The door was just by the spot where he was  standing. As he stood there, half-a-dozen other vague forms dashed past  him in a knot. One of them almost brushed against him. For a moment he  thought of stopping him, but decided not to. He could wait.    On the following afternoon he slipped down into the basement soon after  school. It was as black as pitch in the cellar. He took up a position  near the door.    It seemed hours before anything happened. He was, indeed, almost giving  up the thing as a bad job, when a ray of light cut through the  blackness in front of him, and somebody slipped through the door. The  next moment, a second form appeared dimly, and then the light was shut  off again.    O'Hara could hear them groping their way past him. He waited no longer.  It is difficult to tell where sound comes from in the dark. He plunged  forward at a venture. His hand, swinging round in a semicircle, met  something which felt like a shoulder. He slipped his grasp down to the  arm, and clutched it with all the force at his disposal.          IX    MAINLY ABOUT FERRETS      \"Ow!\" exclaimed the captive, with no uncertain voice. \"Let go, you ass,  you're hurting.\"    The voice was a treble voice. This surprised O'Hara. It looked very  much as if he had put up the wrong bird. From the dimensions of the arm  which he was holding, his prisoner seemed to be of tender years.    \"Let go, Harvey, you idiot. I shall kick.\"    Before the threat could be put into execution, O'Hara, who had been  fumbling all this while in his pocket for a match, found one loose, and  struck a light. The features of the owner of the arm--he was still  holding it--were lit up for a moment.    \"Why, it's young Renford!\" he exclaimed. \"What are you doing down  here?\"    Renford, however, continued to pursue the topic of his arm, and the  effect that the vice-like grip of the Irishman had had upon it.    \"You've nearly broken it,\" he said, complainingly.    \"I'm sorry. I mistook you for somebody else. Who's that with you?\"    \"It's me,\" said an ungrammatical voice.    \"Who's me?\"    \"Harvey.\"    At this point a soft yellow light lit up the more immediate  neighbourhood. Harvey had brought a bicycle lamp into action.    \"That's more like it,\" said Renford. \"Look here, O'Hara, you won't  split, will you?\"    \"I'm not an informer by profession, thanks,\" said O'Hara.    \"Oh, I know it's all right, really, but you can't be too careful,  because one isn't allowed down here, and there'd be a beastly row if it  got out about our being down here.\"    \"And _they_ would be cobbed,\" put in Harvey.    \"Who are they?\" asked O'Hara.    \"Ferrets. Like to have a look at them?\"    \"_Ferrets!_\"    \"Yes. Harvey brought back a couple at the beginning of term. Ripping  little beasts. We couldn't keep them in the house, as they'd have got  dropped on in a second, so we had to think of somewhere else, and  thought why not keep them down here?\"    \"Why, indeed?\" said O'Hara. \"Do ye find they like it?\"    \"Oh, _they_ don't mind,\" said Harvey. \"We feed 'em twice a day.  Once before breakfast--we take it in turns to get up early--and once  directly after school. And on half-holidays and Sundays we take them  out on to the downs.\"    \"What for?\"    \"Why, rabbits, of course. Renford brought back a saloon-pistol with  him. We keep it locked up in a box--don't tell any one.\"    \"And what do ye do with the rabbits?\"    \"We pot at them as they come out of the holes.\"    \"Yes, but when ye hit 'em?\"    \"Oh,\" said Renford, with some reluctance, \"we haven't exactly hit any  yet.\"    \"We've got jolly near, though, lots of times,\" said Harvey. \"Last  Saturday I swear I wasn't more than a quarter of an inch off one of  them. If it had been a decent-sized rabbit, I should have plugged it  middle stump; only it was a small one, so I missed. But come and see  them. We keep 'em right at the other end of the place, in case anybody  comes in.\"    \"Have you ever seen anybody down here?\" asked O'Hara.    \"Once,\" said Renford. \"Half-a-dozen chaps came down here once while we  were feeding the ferrets. We waited till they'd got well in, then we  nipped out quietly. They didn't see us.\"    \"Did you see who they were?\"    \"No. It was too dark. Here they are. Rummy old crib this, isn't it?  Look out for your shins on the chairs. Switch on the light, Harvey.  There, aren't they rippers? Quite tame, too. They know us quite well.  They know they're going to be fed, too. Hullo, Sir Nigel! This is Sir  Nigel. Out of the 'White Company', you know. Don't let him nip your  fingers. This other one's Sherlock Holmes.\"    \"Cats-s-s--s!!\" said O'Hara. He had a sort of idea that that was the  right thing to say to any animal that could chase and bite.    Renford was delighted to be able to show his ferrets off to so  distinguished a visitor.    \"What were you down here about?\" inquired Harvey, when the little  animals had had their meal, and had retired once more into private  life.    O'Hara had expected this question, but he did not quite know what  answer to give. Perhaps, on the whole, he thought, it would be best to  tell them the real reason. If he refused to explain, their curiosity  would be roused, which would be fatal. And to give any reason except  the true one called for a display of impromptu invention of which he  was not capable. Besides, they would not be likely to give away his  secret while he held this one of theirs connected with the ferrets. He  explained the situation briefly, and swore them to silence on the  subject.    Renford's comment was brief.    \"By Jove!\" he observed.    Harvey went more deeply into the question.    \"What makes you think they meet down here?\" he asked.    \"I saw some fellows cutting out of here last night. And you say ye've  seen them here, too. I don't see what object they could have down here  if they weren't the League holding a meeting. I don't see what else a  chap would be after.\"    \"He might be keeping ferrets,\" hazarded Renford.    \"The whole school doesn't keep ferrets,\" said O'Hara. \"You're unique in  that way. No, it must be the League, an' I mean to wait here till they  come.\"    \"Not all night?\" asked Harvey. He had a great respect for O'Hara, whose  reputation in the school for out-of-the-way doings was considerable. In  the bright lexicon of O'Hara he believed there to be no such word as  \"impossible.\"    \"No,\" said O'Hara, \"but till lock-up. You two had better cut now.\"    \"Yes, I think we'd better,\" said Harvey.    \"And don't ye breathe a word about this to a soul\"--a warning which  extracted fervent promises of silence from both youths.    \"This,\" said Harvey, as they emerged on to the gravel, \"is something  like. I'm jolly glad we're in it.\"        \"Rather. Do you think O'Hara will"]]]
