His Majesty continued to throw the quoits as coolly as if no danger  threatened his throne, but the Pumpkinhead, having caught sight of Tip,  ambled toward the boy as fast as his wooden legs would go.    \"Good afternoon, noble parent!\" he cried, delightedly. \"I'm glad to see you  are here. That terrible Saw-Horse ran away with me.\"    \"I suspected it,\" said Tip. \"Did you get hurt? Are you cracked at all?\"    \"No, I arrived safely,\" answered Jack, \"and his Majesty has been very kind  indeed to me.    At this moment the Soldier with the Green Whiskers returned, and the  Scarecrow asked:        99    \"By the way, who has conquered me?\"    \"A regiment of girls, gathered from the four corners of the Land of Oz,\"  replied the Soldier, still pale with fear.    \"But where was my Standing Army at the time?\" inquired his Majesty, looking  at the Soldier, gravely.    \"Your Standing Army was running,\" answered the fellow, honestly; \"for no man  could face the terrible weapons of the invaders.\"    \"Well,\" said the Scarecrow, after a moment's thought, \"I don't mind much the  loss of my throne, for it's a tiresome job to rule over the Emerald City.  And this crown is so heavy that it makes my head ache. But I hope the  Conquerors have no intention of injuring me, just because I happen to be the  King.\"    \"I heard them, say\" remarked Tip, with some hesitation, \"that they intend to  make a rag carpet of your outside and stuff their sofa-cushions with your  inside.\"    \"Then I am really in danger,\" declared his Majesty, positively, \"and it will  be wise for me to consider a means to escape.\"    \"Where can you go?\" asked Jack Pumpkinhead.    \"Why, to my friend the Tin Woodman, who        100               Line-Art Drawing      rules over the Winkies, and calls himself their Emperor,\" was the answer. \"I  am sure he will protect me.\"    Tip was looking out the window.    \"The palace is surrounded by the enemy,\" said        101  he \"It is too late to escape. They would soon tear you to pieces.\"    The Scarecrow sighed.    \"In an emergency,\" he announced, \"it is always a good thing to pause and  reflect. Please excuse me while I pause and reflect.\"    \"But we also are in danger,\" said the Pumpkinhead, anxiously. \"If any of  these girls understand cooking, my end is not far off!\"    \"Nonsense!\" exclaimed the Scarecrow. \"they're too busy to cook, even if they  know how!\"    \"But should I remain here a prisoner for any length of time,\" protested  Jack,\" I'm liable to spoil.\"    \"Ah! then you would not be fit to associate with,\" returned the Scarecrow.  \"The matter is more serious than I suspected.\"    \"You,\" said the Pumpkinhead, gloomily, \"are liable to live for many years.  My life is necessarily short. So I must take advantage of the few days that  remain to me.\"    \"There, there! Don't worry,\" answered the Scarecrow soothingly; \"if you'll  keep quiet long enough for me to think, I'll try to find some way for us all  to escape.\"    So the others waited in patient silence while the Scarecrow walked to a  corner and stood with his        102  face to the wall for a good five minutes. At the end of that time he faced  them with a more cheerful expression upon his painted face.    \"Where is the Saw-Horse you rode here?\" he asked the Pumpkinhead.    \"Why, I said he was a jewel, and so your man locked him up in the royal  treasury,\" said Jack.    \"It was the only place I could think of your Majesty,\" added the Soldier,  fearing he had made a blunder.    \"It pleases me very much,\" said the Scarecrow. \"Has the animal been fed?\"    \"Oh, yes; I gave him a heaping peck of sawdust.\"    \"Excellent!\" cried the Scarecrow. \"Bring the horse here at once.\"    The Soldier hastened away, and presently they heard the clattering of the  horse's wooden legs upon the pavement as he was led into the courtyard.    His Majesty regarded the steed critically. \"He doesn't seem especially  graceful!\" he remarked, musingly. \"but I suppose he can run?\"    \"He can, indeed,\" said Tip, gazing upon the Saw-Horse admiringly.    \"Then, bearing us upon his back, he must make a dash through the ranks of  the rebels and carry us to my friend the Tin Woodman,\" announced the  Scarecrow.        103    \"He can't carry four!\" objected Tip.    \"No, but he may be induced to carry three,\" said his Majesty. \"I shall  therefore leave my Royal Army Behind. For, from the ease with which he was  conquered, I have little confidence in his powers.\"    \"Still, he can run,\" declared Tip, laughing.    \"I expected this blow\" said the Soldier, sulkily; \"but I can bear it. I  shall disguise myself by cutting off my lovely green whiskers. And, after  all, it is no more dangerous to face those reckless girls than to ride this  fiery, untamed wooden horse!\"    \"Perhaps you are right,\" observed his Majesty. \"But, for my part, not being  a soldier, I am fond of danger. Now, my boy, you must mount first. And  please sit as close to the horse's neck as possible.\"    Tip climbed quickly to his place, and the Soldier and the Scarecrow managed  to hoist the Pumpkinhead to a seat just behind him. There remained so little  space for the King that he was liable to fall off as soon as the horse  started.    \"Fetch a clothesline,\" said the King to his Army, \"and tie us all together.  Then if one falls off we will all fall off.\"    And while the Soldier was gone for the clothesline his Majesty continued,  \"it is well for me to be careful, for my very existence is in danger.\"        104    \"I have to be as careful as you do,\" said Jack.    \"Not exactly,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"for if anything happened to me, that  would be the end of me. But if anything happened to you, they could use you  for seed.\"    The Soldier now returned with a long line and tied all three firmly  together, also lashing them to the body of the Saw-Horse; so there seemed  little danger of their tumbling off.    \"Now throw open the gates,\" commanded the Scarecrow, \"and we will make a  dash to liberty or to death.\"    The courtyard in which they were standing was located in the center of the  great palace, which surrounded it on all sides. But in one place a passage  led to an outer gateway, which the Soldier had barred by order of his  sovereign. It was through this gateway his Majesty proposed to escape, and  the Royal Army now led the Saw-Horse along the passage and unbarred the  gate, which swung backward with a loud crash.    \"Now,\" said Tip to the horse, \"you must save us all. Run as fast as you can  for the gate of the City, and don't let anything stop you.\"    \"All right!\" answered the Saw-Horse, gruffly, and dashed away so suddenly  that Tip had to gasp        105               Full page line-art drawing.                   \"WE WILL MAKE A DASH TO LIBERTY OR TO DEATH.\"        106  for breath and hold firmly to the post he had driven into the creature's  neck.    Several of the girls, who stood outside guarding the palace, were knocked  over by the Saw-Horse's mad rush. Others ran screaming out of the way, and  only one or two jabbed their knitting-needles frantically at the escaping  prisoners. Tip got one small prick in his left arm, which smarted for an  hour afterward; but the needles had no effect upon the Scarecrow or Jack  Pumpkinhead, who never even suspected they were being prodded.    As for the Saw-Horse, he made a wonderful record upsetting a fruit cart,  overturning several meek looking men, and finally bowling over the new  Guardian of the Gate--a fussy little fat woman appointed by General  Jinjur.    Nor did the impetuous charger stop then. Once outside the walls of the  Emerald City he dashed along the road to the West with fast and violent  leaps that shook the breath out of the boy and filled the Scarecrow with  wonder.    Jack had ridden at this mad rate once before, so he devoted every effort to  holding, with both hands, his pumpkin head upon its stick, enduring meantime  the dreadful jolting with the courage of a philosopher.        107               Full page line-art drawing.                   THE WOODEN STEED GAVE ONE FINAL LEAP        108    \"Slow him up! Slow him up!\" shouted the Scarecrow. \"My straw is all shaking  down into my legs.\"    But Tip had no breath to speak, so the Saw-Horse continued his wild career  unchecked and with unabated speed.    Presently they came to the banks of a wide river, and without a pause the  wooden steed gave one final leap and launched them all in mid-air.    A second later they were rolling, splashing and bobbing about in the water,  the horse struggling frantically to find a rest for its feet and its riders  being first plunged beneath the rapid current and then floating upon the  surface like corks.                     Line-Art Drawing        109               The Journey to the Tin Woodman      Tip was well soaked and dripping water from every angle of his body. But he  managed to lean forward and shout in the ear of the Saw-Horse:    \"Keep still, you fool! Keep still!\"    The horse at once ceased struggling and floated calmly upon the surface, its  wooden body being as buoyant as a raft.    \"What does that word 'fool' mean?\" enquired the horse.    \"It is a term of reproach,\" answered Tip, somewhat ashamed of the  expression. \"I only use it when I am angry.\"    \"Then it pleases me to be able to call you a fool, in return,\" said the  horse. \"For I did not make        110  the river, nor put it in our way; so only a term of, reproach is fit for one  who becomes angry with me for falling into the water.\"    \"That is quite evident,\" replied Tip; \"so I will acknowledge myself in the  wrong.\" Then he called out to the Pumpkinhead: \"are you all right, Jack?\"    There was no reply. So the boy called to the King \"are you all right, your  majesty?\"    The "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5402"],[0,"1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (#9)"],[1,"near Derby, was desired    by his landlord to call upon him, whenever he came    that way; for, added he, soldiers are the pillars of the    nation. The rebellion being finished, it happened the same    regiment was quartered in Derbyshire, when the soldier    resolved to accept of his landlord's invitation, and    accordingly obtained leave to go to him: but, on his arrival,    he was greatly surprised to find a very cold reception;    whereupon expostulating with his landlord, he reminded him of    his invitation, and the circumstance of his having said,    soldiers were the pillars of the nation.
