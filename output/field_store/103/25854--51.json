I fear  I have often thought lightly of others' trouble in the loss of so young  a child; but now I know what it is. Does it not seem strange and sad,  that this little house in a distant, lonely spot, no sooner becomes a  home than it is baptized, as it were, with tears? No doubt there are  bright and happy days in store for us yet, but these first ones here  have been sadly darkened by this shadow of death. Inanimate things have  such a terrible power to wound one: though everything which would remind  me of Baby has been carefully removed and hidden away by F----'s orders,  still now and then I come across some trifle belonging to him, and, as  Miss Ingelow says--          \"My old sorrow wakes and cries.\"    Our loss is one too common out here, I am told: infants born in  Christchurch during the autumn very often die. Owing to the flatness of  the site of the town, it is almost impossible to get a proper system of  drainage; and the arrangements seem very bad, if you are to judge from  the evil smells which are abroad in the evening. Children who are born  on a station, or taken there as soon as possible, almost invariably  thrive, but babies are very difficult to rear in the towns. If they get  over the first year, they do well; and I cannot really call to mind a  single sickly, or even delicate-looking child among the swarms which one  sees everywhere.    I cannot say that I think colonial children prepossessing in either  manners or appearance, in spite of their ruddy cheeks and sturdy limbs.  Even quite little things are pert and independent, and give me the idea  of being very much spoiled. When you reflect on the utter absence of any  one who can really be called a nurse, this is not to be wondered at. The  mothers are thoroughly domestic and devoted to their home duties, far  more so than the generality of the same class at home. An English lady,  with even an extremely moderate income, would look upon her colonial  sister as very hard-worked indeed. The children cannot be entrusted  entirely to the care of an ignorant girl, and the poor mother has  them with her all day long; if she goes out to pay visits (the only  recognized social duty here), she has to take the elder children with  her, but this early introduction into society does not appear to polish  the young visitors' manners in the least. There is not much rest at  night for the mater-familias with the inevitable baby, and it is of  course very difficult for her to be correcting small delinquents all day  long; so they grow up with what manners nature gives them. There seems  to me, however, to be a greater amount of real domestic happiness out  here than at home: perhaps the want of places of public amusement may  have something to do with this desirable state of affairs, but the homes  seem to be thoroughly happy ones. A married man is an object of envy  to his less fortunate brethren, and he appears anxious to show that  he appreciates his good fortune. As for scandal, in the ordinary  acceptation of the word, it is unknown; gossip there is in plenty, but  it generally refers to each other's pecuniary arrangements or trifling  peculiarities, and is all harmless enough. I really believe that the  life most people lead here is as simple and innocent as can well be  imagined. Each family is occupied in providing for its own little daily  wants and cares, which supplies the mind and body with healthy and  legitimate employment, and yet, as my experience tells me, they have  plenty of leisure to do a kind turn for a neighbour. This is the bright  side of colonial life, and there is more to be said in its praise; but  the counterbalancing drawback is, that the people seem gradually to lose  the sense of larger and wider interests; they have little time to keep  pace with the general questions of the day, and anything like sympathy  or intellectual appreciation is very rare. I meet accomplished people,  but seldom well-read ones; there is also too much talk about money:  \"where the treasure is, there will the heart be also;\" and the incessant  financial discussions are wearisome, at least to me.          Letter X: Our station home.      Broomielaw, July 1866. We are now in mid-winter, and a more delicious  season cannot well be imagined; the early mornings and evenings and  the nights are very cold, but the hours from 10 A.M. till 5 P.M. are  exquisitely bright, and quite warm. We are glad of a fire at breakfast,  which is tolerably early, but we let it out and never think of  relighting it until dark. Above all, it is calm: I congratulate myself  daily on the stillness of the atmosphere, but F---- laughs and says,  \"Wait until the spring.\" I bask all day in the verandah, carrying my  books and work there soon after breakfast; as soon as the sun goes down,  however, it becomes very cold. In an English house you would hardly feel  it, but with only one plank an inch thick, a lining-board and canvas and  paper, between you and a hard frost, a good fire is wanted. We burn coal  found twelve miles from this; it is not very good, being only what  is called \"lignite.\" I don't know if that conveys to you a distinct  impression of what it really is. I should say it was a better sort  of turf: it smoulders just in the same way, and if not disturbed will  remain many hours alight; it requires a log of dry wood with it to  make a really good blaze. Fuel is most difficult to get here, and very  expensive, as we have no available \"bush\" on the Run; so we have first  to take out a licence for cutting wood in the Government bush, then  to employ men to cut it, and hire a drayman who possesses a team of  bullocks and a dray of his own, to fetch it to us: he can only take two  journeys a day, as he has four miles to travel each way, so that by the  time the wood is stacked it costs us at least thirty shillings a cord,  and then there is the labour of sawing and cutting it up. The coal costs  us one pound a ton at the mouth of the pit, and the carriage exactly  doubles its price; besides which it is impossible to get more, than a  small quantity at a time, on account of the effect of the atmosphere on  it. Exposure to the air causes it to crumble into dust, and although we  keep our supply in a little shed for the purpose, it is wasted to the  extent of at least a quarter of each load. We are unusually unfortunate  in the matter of firing; most stations have a bush near to the  homestead, or greater facilities for draying than we possess.    You tell me to describe my little house to you, so I must try to make  you see it, only prefacing my attempt by warning you not to be disgusted  or disappointed at any shortcomings. The house has not been built in  a pretty situation, as many other things had to be considered before  a picturesque site: first it was necessary to build on a flat (as the  valleys here are called), not too far off the main track, on account of  having to make the road to it ourselves; the next thing to be thought  of was shelter from the north-west wind; then the soil must be fit for  a garden, and a good creek, or brook, which would not go dry in the  summer, close at hand. At present, everything out of doors is so  unfinished that the place looks rather desolate, and it will be some  years before our plantations can attain a respectable size, even  allowing for the rapid growth in this climate. The first step is to  obtain shelter from our enemy the \"nor'-wester,\" and for this purpose we  have planted quantities of broom in all directions; even the large beds  for vegetables in the garden have a hedge of Cape broom on the exposed  side; fortunately, the broom grows very quickly in spite of the wind,  and attains to a luxuriant beauty rarely seen in England. We have put in  many other trees, such as oaks, maples, etc., but not one is higher than  this table, except a few poplars; the ground immediately outside the  house has been dug up, and is awaiting the spring to be sown with  English grass; we have no attempt at a flower-garden yet, but have  devoted our energies to the vegetable one,--putting in fruit trees,  preparing strawberry and asparagus beds, and other useful things. Out  of doors matters would not even be as far advanced towards a garden and  plantation as they are if we had commenced operations ourselves, but  the ground has been worked since last year. I am glad we have chosen to  build our house here instead of at the homestead two miles off; for I  like to be removed from the immediate neighbourhood of all the work of  the station, especially from that of the \"gallows,\"--a high wooden frame  from which the carcases of the butchered sheep dangle; under the present  arrangement the shepherd brings us over our mutton as we want it.    Inside the house everything is comfortable and pretty, and, above all  things, looks thoroughly home-like. Out of the verandah you pass through  a little hall hung with whips and sticks, spurs and hats, and with a  bookcase full of novels at one end of it, into a dining-room, large  enough for us, with more books in every available corner, the prints  you know so well on the walls, and a trophy of Indian swords and  hunting-spears over the fireplace: this leads into the drawing-room, a  bright, cheery little room--more books and pictures, and a writing-table  in the \"_h_oriel.\" In that tall, white, classical-shaped vase of  Minton's which you helped me to choose is the most beautiful bouquet,  made entirely of ferns; it is a constant object for my walks up the  gullies, exploring little patches of bush to search for the ferns, which  grow abundantly under their shelter by the creek. I have a small but  comfortable bedroom, and there is a little dressing-room for F---- and  the tiniest spare room you ever saw; it really is not bigger than the  cabin of a ship. I think the kitchen is the chief glory of the house,  boasting a \"Leamington range\" a luxury quite unknown in these parts,  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/611"],[0,"Prester John (#9)"],[1,"and the natives.  I had thought of going  back for more, and then it occurred to me that I might profitably give  some of my leisure to the Rooirand.  I could see the wall of the  mountains quite clear to the north, within an easy day's ride.  So one  morning I packed enough food for a day or two, tied my sleeping-bag on  my saddle, and set off to explore, after appointing the elder of the  Dutchmen foreman of the job in my absence.    It was very hot jogging along the native path with the eternal  olive-green bush around me.  Happily there was no fear of losing the  way, for the Rooirand stood very clear in front, and slowly, as I  advanced, I began to make out the details of the cliffs.  At  luncheon-time, when I was about half-way, I sat down with my Zeiss  glass--my mother's farewell gift--to look for the valley.  But valley I  saw none.  The wall--reddish purple it looked, and, I thought, of  porphyry--was continuous and unbroken.  There were chimneys and  fissures, but none great enough to hold a river.  The top was sheer  cliff; then came loose kranzes in tiers, like the seats in a gallery,  and, below, a dense thicket of trees.  I raked the whole line for a  break, but there seemed none.  'It's a bad job for me,' I thought, 'if  there is no water, for I must pass the night there.' The night was  spent in a sheltered nook at the foot of the rocks, but my horse and I  went to bed without a drink.  My supper was some raisins and biscuits,  for I did not dare to run the risk of increasing my thirst.  I had  found a great bank of _débris_ sloping up to the kranzes, and thick wood  clothing all the slope.  The grass seemed wonderfully fresh, but of  water there was no sign.  There was not even the sandy channel of a  stream to dig in.    In the morning I had a difficult problem to face.  Water I must find at  all costs, or I must go home.  There was time enough for me to get back  without suffering much, but if so I must give up my explorations.  This  I was determined not to do.  The more I looked at these red cliffs the  more eager I was to find out their secret.  There must be water  somewhere; otherwise how account for the lushness of the vegetation?    My horse was a veld pony, so I set him loose to see what he would do.  He strayed back on the path to Umvelos'.  This looked bad, for it meant  that he did not smell water along the cliff front.  If I was to find a  stream it must be on the top, and I must try a little mountaineering.    Then, taking my courage in both my hands, I decided.  I gave my pony a  cut, and set him off on the homeward road.  I knew he was safe to get  back in four or five hours, and in broad day there was little fear of  wild beasts attacking him.  I had tied my sleeping bag on to the  saddle, and had with me but two pocketfuls of food.  I had also  fastened on the saddle a letter to my Dutch foreman, bidding him send a  native with a spare horse to fetch me by the evening.  Then I started  off to look for a chimney.    A boyhood spent on the cliffs at Kirkcaple had made me a bold cragsman,  and the porphyry of the Rooirand clearly gave excellent holds.  But I  walked many weary miles along the cliff-foot before I found a feasible  road.  To begin with, it was no light task to fight one's way through  the dense undergrowth of the lower slopes.  Every kind of thorn-bush  lay in wait for my skin, creepers tripped me up, high trees shut out  the light, and I was in constant fear lest a black _mamba_ might appear  out of the tangle.  It grew very hot, and the screes above the thicket  were blistering to the touch.  My tongue, too, stuck to the roof of my  mouth with thirst.    The first chimney I tried ran out on the face into nothingness, and I  had to make a dangerous descent.  The second was a deep gully, but so  choked with rubble that after nearly braining myself I desisted.  Still  going eastwards, I found a sloping ledge which took me to a platform  from which ran a crack with a little tree growing in it.  My glass  showed me that beyond this tree the crack broadened into a clearly  defined chimney which led to the top.  If I can once reach that tree, I  thought, the battle is won. The crack was only a few inches wide, large  enough to let in an arm and a foot, and it ran slantwise up a  perpendicular rock.  I do not think I realized how bad it was till I  had gone too far to return.  Then my foot jammed, and I paused for  breath with my legs and arms cramping rapidly.  I remember that I  looked to the west, and saw through the sweat which kept dropping into  my eyes that about half a mile off a piece of cliff which looked  unbroken from the foot had a fold in it to the right.  The darkness of  the fold showed me that it was a deep, narrow gully.  However, I had no  time to think of this, for I was fast in the middle of my confounded  crack.  With immense labour I found a chockstone above my head, and  managed to force my foot free.  The next few yards were not so  difficult, and then I stuck once more.    For the crack suddenly grew shallow as the cliff bulged out above me.  I had almost given up hope, when I saw that about three feet above my  head grew the tree.  If I could reach it and swing out I might hope to  pull myself up to the ledge on which it grew.  I confess it needed all  my courage, for I did not know but that the tree might be loose, and  that it and I might go rattling down four hundred feet.  It was my only  hope, however, so I set my teeth, and wriggling up a few inches, made a  grab at it.  Thank God it held, and with a great effort I pulled my  shoulder over the ledge, and breathed freely.    My difficulties were not ended, but the worst was past.  The rest of  the gully gave me good and safe climbing, and presently a very limp and  weary figure lay on the cliff-top.  It took me many minutes to get back  my breath and to conquer the faintness which seized me as soon as the  need for exertion was over.    When I scrambled to my feet and looked round, I saw a wonderful  prospect.  It was a plateau like the high-veld, only covered with  bracken and little bushes like hazels.  Three or four miles off the  ground rose, and a shallow vale opened.  But in the foreground, half a  mile or so distant, a lake lay gleaming in the sun.    I could scarcely believe my eyes as I ran towards it, and doubts of a  mirage haunted me.  But it was no mirage, but a real lake, perhaps  three miles in circumference, with bracken-fringed banks, a shore of  white pebbles, and clear deep blue water.  I drank my fill, and then  stripped and swam in the blessed coolness.  After that I ate some  luncheon, and sunned myself on a flat rock.  'I have discovered the  source of the Labongo,' I said to myself.  'I will write to the Royal  Geographical Society, and they will give me a medal.'    I walked round the lake to look for an outlet.  A fine mountain stream  came in at the north end, and at the south end, sure enough, a  considerable river debauched.  My exploring zeal redoubled, and I  followed its course in a delirium of expectation.  It was a noble  stream, clear as crystal, and very unlike the muddy tropical Labongo at  Umvelos'.  Suddenly, about a quarter of a mile from the lake, the land  seemed to grow over it, and with a swirl and a hollow roar, it  disappeared into a mighty pot-hole.  I walked a few steps on, and from  below my feet came the most uncanny rumbling and groaning. Then I knew  what old Coetzee's devil was that howled in the Rooirand.    Had I continued my walk to the edge of the cliff, I might have learned  a secret which would have stood me in good stead later.  But the  descent began to make me anxious, and I retraced my steps to the top of  the chimney whence I had come.  I was resolved that nothing would make  me descend by that awesome crack, so I kept on eastward along the top  to look for a better way.  I found one about a mile farther on, which,  though far from easy, had no special risks save from the appalling  looseness of the _débris_.  When I got down at length, I found that it  was near sunset.  I went to the place I had bidden my native look for  me at, but, as I had feared, there was no sign of him.  So, making the  best of a bad job, I had supper and a pipe, and spent a very chilly  night in a hole among the boulders.    I got up at dawn stiff and cold, and ate a few raisins for breakfast.  There was no sign of horses, so I resolved to fill up the time in  looking for the fold of the cliff which, as I had seen from the  horrible crack of yesterday, contained a gully.  It was a difficult  job, for to get the sidelong view of the cliff I had to scramble  through the undergrowth of the slopes again, and even a certain way up  the kranzes.  At length I got my bearings, and fixed the place by some  tall trees in the bush.  Then I descended and walked westwards.    Suddenly, as I neared the place, I heard the strangest sound coming  from the rocks.  It was a deep muffled groaning, so eerie and unearthly  that for the moment I stood and shivered. Then I remembered my river of  yesterday.  It must be above this place that it descended into the  earth, and in the hush of dawn the sound was naturally louder.  No  wonder old Coetzee had been afraid of devils.  It reminded me of the  lines in _Marmion_--         'Diving as if condemned to lave       Some demon's subterranean cave,       Who, prisoned by enchanter's spell,       Shakes the dark rock with groan and yell.'    While I was standing awestruck at the sound, I observed a figure moving  towards the cliffs.  I was well in cover, so I could not have been  noticed.  It was a very old man, very tall, but bowed in the shoulders,  who was walking slowly with bent head.  He could not have been thirty  yards from me, so I had a clear view of his face.  He was a native, but  of a type I had never seen before.  A long white beard fell on his  breast, and a magnificent kaross of leopard skin covered his"]]]
