[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5760"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 1 (#9)"],[1," the trade-winds again begin to be  felt, and bring with them the dry season of the year, during  which hardly ever a cloud disturbs the serenity of the skies.    \"Between the tropical limits and the equator, however, the sun  comes twice to the zenith of each place. If now, between the  going and coming of the sun, from the Line to its furthest range,  a sufficient pause intervenes, or if the sun's temporary distance  from the zenith is great enough, the rainy season is divided into  two portions, separated by a lesser dry season. Closer to the  tropical lines, where the sun remains but once in the zenith, the  rainy season is a continuous one.\"    Such is the theory of the \"Allgemeine Erdkunde\" (Hahn,  Hochstetter and Pokorny, Prague, 1872). An explanation should be  added of the reason why the cool wind ceases to blow, at the time  when the air, heated and raised by a perpendicular sun, might be  expected to cause a greater indraught. We at once, I have said,  recognize its correctness at sea. The Gaboon, \"in the belt of  calms, with rain during the whole year,\" has two distinctly  marked dry seasons, at the vernal and the autumnal equinoxes. The  former or early rains (Nchangyá?) are expected to begin in  February, with violent tornadoes and storms, especially at the  full and change, and to end in April. The heavy downfalls are  mostly at night, possibly an effect of the Sierra del Crystal. I  found March 28th (1862) very like damp weather at the end of an  English May; April 6th was equally exceptional, raining from dawn  to evening. During my trip to Sánga-Tánga and back (March 25th to  29th) we had frequent fogs, locally called \"smokes,\" and almost  daily tornadoes, sometimes from the south-east, whilst the  lightning was dangerous as upon the Western prairies. After an  interval of fiery sun, with occasional rain torrents and  discharges of electricity, begin the Enomo (Enun?), the \"middle\"  or long dries, which last four months to September. The \"Enomo\"  is the Angolan Cacimbo, meaning cool and cloudy weather, when no  umbrella is required, and when the invariably grey sky rarely  rains. Travellers are told that June and July are the cream of  the year, the healthiest time for seasoned Europeans, and this  phantom of a winter renders the climate more supportable to the  northern constitution.    During the \"middle dries,\" when the sun, retiring to the summer  solstice, is most distant, land winds and sea breezes are strong  and regular, and the people suffer severely from cold. In the  Gaboon heavy showers sometimes fall, July being the least subject  to them, and the fiery sun, when it can disperse the clouds,  turns the soil to dust. At the end of September appear the  \"latter rains,\" which are the more copious, as they seldom last  more than six hours at a time. It is erroneous to assert that  \"the tract nearest the equator on both sides has the longest  rainy season;\" the measure chiefly depends upon altitude and  other local conditions.    The rainy seasons are healthier for the natives than the cold  seasons; and the explorer is often urged to take advantage of  them. He must, however, consult local experience. Whilst  ascending rivers in November, for instance, he may find the many  feet of flood a boon or a bane, and his marching journeys are  nearly sure to end in ulcerated feet, as was the case with poor  Dr. Livingstone. The rains drench the country till the latter end  of December, when the Nángá or \"little dries\" set in for two  months. The latter also are not unbroken by storms and showers,  and they end with tornadoes, which this year (1862) have been  unusually frequent and violent. Thus we may distribute the twelve  months into six of rains, vernal and autumnal, and six of dry  weather, æstival and hibernal: the following table will show the  sub-sections:--    Early December to early February, the \"little dries;\" February to  early April, the \"former,\" early or spring rains; May to early  June, the variable weather; June to early September, the Cacimbo,  Enomo, long or middle dries; September to early December, the  \"latter rains.\"    Under such media the disease, par excellence, of the Gaboon is  the paroxysm which is variously called Coast, African, Guinea,  and Bullom fever. Dr. Ford, who has written a useful treatise  upon the subject,[FN#7] finds hebdomadal periodicity in the  attacks, and lays great stress upon this point of  chronothermalism. He recognizes the normal stages, preparatory,  invasional, reactionary, and resolutionary. Like Drs. Livingstone  and Hutchinson, he holds fever and quinine \"incompatibles,\" and  he highly approves of the prophylactic adhibition of chinchona  used by the unfortunate Douville in 1828. Experience in his own  person and in numerous patients \"proves all theoretical  objections to the use of six grains an hour, or fifty and sixty  grains of quinine in one day or remission to be absolutely  imaginary.\" He is \"convinced that it is not a stimulant,\" and  with many apologies he cautiously sanctions alcohol, which should  often be the physician's mainstay. As he advocated ten-grain  doses of calomel by way of preliminary cathartic, the American  missionaries stationed on the River have adopted a treatment  still more \"severe\"--quinine till deafness ensues, and half a  handful of mercury, often continued till a passage opens through  the palate, placing mouth and nose in directer communication. Dr.  Ford also recommends during the invasion or period of chills  external friction of mustard or of fresh red pepper either in  tincture or in powder, a good alleviator always procurable; and  the internal use of pepper-tea, to bring on the stages of  reaction and resolution. Few will agree with him that gruels and  farinaceous articles are advisable during intermissions, when the  patient craves for port, essence of beef, and consomme; nor can  we readily admit the dictum that in the tropics \"the most  wholesome diet, without doubt, is chiefly vegetable.\" Despite  Jacquemont and all the rice-eaters, I cry beef and beer for ever  and everywhere! Many can testify personally to the value of the  unofficinal prescription which he offers in cases of severe  lichen (prickly heat), leading to impetigo. It is as follows, and  it is valuable:--    Cold cream. . . . . . . . . . 3j.  Glycerine . . . . . . . . . . 3j.  Chloroform . . . . . . . . .3ij.

The tribes occupying the Gaboon country may roughly be divided  into two according to habitat--the maritime and those of the  interior, who are quasi-mountaineers. Upon the sea-board dwell  the Banôkô (Banaka), Bapuka, and Batanga; the Kombe, the Benga  and Mbiko, or people about Corisco; the Shekyani, who extend far  into the interior, the Urungu and Aloa, clans of Cape Lopez; the  Nkommi, Commi, Camma or Cama, and the Mayumba races beyond the  southern frontier. The inner hordes are the Dibwe (M. du  Chaillu's \"Ibouay\"), the Mbúsha; the numerous and once powerful  Bákele, the Cannibal Fán (Mpongwe), the Osheba or 'Sheba, their  congeners, and a variety of \"bush-folk,\" of whom little is known  beyond the names. Linguistically we may distribute them into  three, namely, 1. the Banôkô and Batanga; 2. the Mpongwe,  including the minor ethnical divisions of Benga, and Shekyani;  the Urungu, the Nkommi, the Dongas or Ndiva, and the Mbúsha, and  3. the Mpongwe and the tribes of the interior. Lastly, there are  only three peoples of any importance, namely, the Mpongwe, the  Bákele, and the Fán.    The Mpongwe, whom the French call \"les Gabons,\" are the  aristocracy of the coast, the Benga being the second, and the  Banôkô and Bapuka ranking third. They are variously estimated at  5,000 to 7,000 head, serviles included. They inhabit both sides  of the Gaboon, extending about thirty-five miles along its banks,  chiefly on the right; on the left only seawards of the Shekyani.  But it is a wandering race, and many a \"mercator vagus\" finds his  way to Corisco, Cape Lopez, Batanga, and even Fernando Po. The  two great families on the northern river bank are the Quabens and  the Glass, who style themselves kings and princes; the southern  side lodges King William (Roi Denis) near the mouth, and the  powerful King George, about twenty-five miles higher up stream.  There are also settlements scattered at various distances from  the great highway of commerce to which they naturally cling, and  upon the Coniquet and Parrot Islands.    Barbot (iv. 9) describes the \"Gaboon blacks\" as \"commonly tall,  robust, and well-shaped;\" they appeared to me rather below the  average of West Coast size and weight. Both sexes, even when  running to polysarcia, have delicate limbs and extremities, and  the features, though negroid, are not the negro of the  tobacconist's shop: I noticed several pyramidal and  brachycephalic heads, contrary to the rule for African man and  simiad. In the remarkable paper read (1861) by Professor Busk  before the Ethnological Society, that eminent physiologist proved  that the Asiatic apes, typified by the ourang-outang, are  brachycephalic, like the Mongolians amongst whom they live, or  who live amongst them; whilst the gorillas and the African  anthropoids are dolichocephalic as the negroes. The Gaboon men  are often almost black, whilst the women range between dark brown  and cafe au lait. The beard, usually scanty, is sometimes bien  fournie, especially amongst the seniors, but, whenever I saw a  light-coloured and well-bearded man, the suspicion of mixed blood  invariably obtruded itself. It is said that during the last  thirty years they have greatly diminished, yet their habitat is  still that laid down half a century ago by Bowdich, and all admit  that the population of the river has not been materially  affected.    The Mpongwe women have the reputation of being the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5761"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 2 (#9)"],[1," sea-breeze,\" she found none of the difficulties which kept poor  Tuckey's \"brute of a transport\" drifting and driving for nearly a  week before he could anchor off Fuma or Sherwood's Creek, the  \"Medusa\" of modern charts (?) and which made Shark Point, with  its three-mile current, a \"more redoubtable promontory than that  of Good Hope was to early navigators.\" We stood boldly E.N.E.  towards the high blue clump known as Bulambemba, and, with the  dirty yellow breakers of Mwáná Mazia Bank far to port, we turned  north to French Point, and anchored in a safe bottom of seven  fathoms.    Here we at once saw the origin of the popular opinion that the  Congo has no delta. On both sides, the old river valley, 32 miles  broad, is marked out by grassy hills rolling about 200 feet high,  trending from E.N.E. to W.S.W., and forming on the right bank an  acute angle with the Ghats. But, whilst the northern line  approaches within five or six miles, the southern bank, which  diverges about the place where \"King Plonly's town\" appears in  charts, sweeps away some seventeen miles down coast, and leaves a  wide tract of mangrove swamps. These, according to the Portuguese  traders, who have their own plans of the river, extend some  seventy miles south to Ambrizette: slavers keep all such details  very close, and doubtless for good reasons--\"short-cuts\" greatly  facilitate shipping negroes. The lesser Congo delta is bounded  north by the Banana or Malela stream, whose lower fork is  \"Pirates' Creek;\" and south by the mangrove-clad drains, which  subtend the main line: the base measures 12-15 miles. At the  highest station, Boma, I shall have something to say about the  greater delta. The left bank of the embouchure projects further  seaward, making it look \"under hung,\" representing in charts a  lower jaw, and the projection of Shark Point the teeth, en  profile.    My first care was to collect news at the factories. French Point  is a long low spit, which supports two establishments where the  chart (September 1859) gives \"Emigration Depot.\" It is the old  Banana Point, and probably the older Palmeirinha Point of James  Barbot, who places it in the territory of Goy (Ngoy), now  Cabinda. This part has greatly changed since 1859; either the  Banana River requires removing two miles to the north, or French  Point must be placed an equal distance south. The principal  establishment, M. Régis' of Marseilles, is built in his best  style; a two-storied and brilliantly \"chunam'd\" house, containing  a shop and store on the ground-floor, defended by a three-  pounder. Behind it a square \"compound,\" with high walls, guards  the offices and the other requisites of a bar racoon. It is  fronted by a little village where \"Laptots,\" Senegal Moslems, and  men-at-arms live with their families and slaves. In the rear  stands the far more modest and conscientious establishment of  Messrs. Pencoff and Kerdyk: their plank bungalow is full of work,  whilst the other lies idle; so virtue here is not, as in books,  its own reward.    M. Victor Parrot, the young Swiss agent of M. Régis, hospitably  asked us to take up our quarters with him, and promised to start  us up stream without delay; his employer fixes the tariff of  every article, and no discretion is left to the subordinates. We  called upon M. Elkman of the Dutch factory. His is a well-known  name on the river, and, though familiar with the people, he has  more than once run some personal risk by assisting our cruizers  to make captures. He advised us to lose no time in setting out  before the impending rains: I wanted, however, a slight  preparation for travel, and determined to see something of the  adjoining villages, especially the site of the historic Padrão.    Whilst crossing the stream, we easily understood how the river  was supposed to be in a perpetual state of inundation. The great  breadth and the shallows near either jaw prevent the rain-floods  being perceptible unless instruments are used, and \"hydrometry,\"  still in an imperfect state, was little to be depended upon in  the days when European ideas concerning the Congo River were  formed. Twenty miles up stream the high-water mark becomes  strongly marked, and further on, as will be seen, it shows even  better.    If Barbot's map have any claim to correctness, the southern shore  has changed greatly since A.D. 1700. A straight line from Cape  Padrão to Chapel Point, now Shark Point, was more than double the  breadth of the embouchure. It is vain to seek for the \"Island of  Calabes\" mentioned by Andrew Battel, who was \"sent to a place  called Zaire on the River Congo, to trade for elephants' teeth,  wheat, and palm oil.\" It may be a mistake for Cavallos, noticed  in the next chapter; but the \"town on it\" must have been small,  and has left, they say, no traces. After a scramble through the  surf, we were received at Shark Point, where, at this season, the  current is nearer five than three knots, by Mr. Tom Peter,  Mafuka, or chief trader, amongst these \"Musurungus.\" He bore his  highly respectable name upon the frontal band of his \"berretta\"  alias \"corôa,\" an open-worked affair, very like the old-fashioned  jelly-bag night cap. This head-gear of office made of pine-apple  fibre-- Tuckey says grass--costs ten shillings; it is worn by the  kinglets, who now distribute it to all the lieges whose fortunes  exceed some fifty dollars.    Most of the Squaline villagers appeared to be women, the men  being engaged in making money elsewhere. Besides illicit trade,  which has now become very dangerous, a little is done in the  licit line: grotesquely carved sticks, calabashes rudely  ornamented with ships and human figures, the neat bead-work  grass-strings used by the women to depress the bosom, and  cashimbos or pipes mostly made about Boma. All were re-baptized  in 1853, but they show no sign of Christianity save crosses, and  they are the only prostitutes on the river.    Following Tom Peter, and followed by a noisy tail, we walked to  the west end of Shark Point, to see if aught remained of the  Padrão, the first memorial column, planted in 1485 by the  explorer Diogo Cam, knight of the king's household, Dom João II.  \"O principe perfeito,\" who, says De Barros (\"Asia,\" Decad. I.  lib. iii. chap. 3), \"to immortalize the memory of his captains,\"  directed them to plant these pillars in all remarkable places.  The Padrões, which before the reign of D. João were only wooden  crosses, assumed the shape of \"columns, twice the height of a man  (estado), with the scutcheon bearing the royal arms. At the sides  they were to be inscribed in Latin and Portuguese (to which James  Barbot adds Arabic), with the name of the monarch who sent the  expedition, the date of discovery, and the captain who made it;  on the summit was to be raised a stone cross cramped in with  lead.\" According to others, the inscription mentioned only the  date, the king, and the captain. The Padrão of the Congo was  especially called from the \"Lord of Guinea's favourite saint, de  São Jorge\"--sit faustum! As Carli shows, the patron of Congo and  Angola was Santiago, who was seen bodily assisting at a battle in  which Dom Affonso, son of Giovi (Emmanuel), first Christian king  of Congo, prevailed against a mighty host of idolaters headed by  his pagan brother \"Panso Aquitimo.\" In 1786 Sir Home Popham found  a marble cross on a rock near Angra dos Ilheos or Pequena (south  latitude 26° 37'), with the arms of Portugal almost effaced. Till  lately the jasper pillar at Cabo Negro bore the national arms.  Doubtless much latitude was allowed in the make and material of  these padrões; that which I saw near Cananea in the Brazil is of  saccharine marble, four palms high by two broad; it bears a  scutcheon charged with a cross and surmounted by another.    There is some doubt concerning the date of this mission. De  Barros (I. iii. 3) says A.D. 1484. Lopes de Limn (IV. i. 5) gives  the reason why A.D. 1485 is generally adopted, and he believes  that the cruise of the previous year did not lead to the Congo  River. The explorer, proceeding to inspect the coast south of  Cape St. Catherine (south latitude 2° 30'), which he had  discovered in 1473, set out from São Jorge da Mina, now Elmina.  He was accompanied by Martin von Behaim of Nürnberg (nat. circ.  A.D. 1436, ob. A.D. 1506), a pupil of the mathematician John  Müller (Regiomontanus); and for whom the discovery of the New  World has been claimed.    After doubling his last year's terminus, Diogo Cam chanced upon a  vast embouchure, and, surprised by the beauty of the scenery and  the volume of the stream, he erected his stone Padrão, the first  of its kind. Finding the people unintelligible to the  interpreters, he sent four of his men with a present of hawk's  bells (cascaveis) and blue glass beads to the nearest king, and,  as they did not soon return, he sailed back to Portugal with an  equal number of natives as hostages, promising to return after  fifteen moons. One of them, Caçuta (Zacuten of Barbot), proved to  be a \"fidalgo\" of Sonho, and, though the procedure was contrary  to orders, it found favour with the \"Perfect Prince.\" From these  men the Portuguese learned that the land belonged to a great  monarch named the Mwani-Congo or Lord of Congo, and thus they  gave the river a name unknown to the riverine peoples.    Diogo Cam, on his second visit, sent presents to the ruler with  the hostages, who had learned as much Portuguese and Christianity  as the time allowed; recovered his own men, and passed on to  Angola, Benguela and Cabo Negro, adding to his discoveries 200  leagues of coast. When homeward bound, he met the Mwani-Sonho,  and visited the Mwani-Congo, who lived at Ambasse Congo (São  Salvador), distant 50 leagues (?). The ruler of the \"great and  wonderful River Zaire,\" touched by his words, sent with him  sundry youths, and the fidalgo Caçuta, who was baptized into Dom  Joao, to receive"]]]
