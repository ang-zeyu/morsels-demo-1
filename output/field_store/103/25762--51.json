Please to name the chapter and verse; and when you have  pointed out to me the specific scriptures that teach a faith inferior  to that of prophecying or working miracles, &c., please to tell me  wherein lies the power of such a faith? If it cannot reveal any thing  to the children of men, how can it increase the sum of knowledge with  any reasonable prospect of filling the earth with knowledge, as the  waters cover the bed of the great deep? If it cannot forecast events  beyond the mere common prescience of human minds, how can the wise man  foresee the evil in time to hide himself? Is it not passing strange,  sir, that from Adam to Noah, and from Noah to Abraham, and from  Abraham to David, and from David to Malachi, and from John the Baptist  to John the Revelator, the miraculous faith should be tenaciously  and rigorously contended for; while since that day, men, professing  godliness, not only contend for an inferior faith, but contend against  the antiquated faith that was sustained for more than four thousand  years, giving to God a great and glorious name for all his wonderful  works and mighty deeds.    Why do the modern clergy commend the faith that put to flight the  armies of the aliens--quenched the violence of fire--and staggered  not at promises that required supernatural agency to fulfil, if we  are not to imitate and practice such faith? Why so much time and  labour exhausted in order to define and extol a faith that belonged  exclusively to past ages; and if the scriptures speak of no other  faith that is pleasing to God, would it not be better that mankind  be informed more explicitly what is the nature and effect of that  common and inferior faith of which the Bible illustrations are so  inapplicable? Seeing that the Bible illustrations of faith pertain to  examples of a supernatural order, will you please to give us those that  are of a natural and common order, suited to our age, that is, and,  of a right, ought to be free from supernatural and miraculous deeds,  signs, wonders, and prophecyings? In so doing, and publishing the same  through your widely-circulated paper, you may rest assured that it  shall have prompt insertion in the STAR, and greatly oblige.    Your humble and obedient servant,    ORSON SPENCER.        LETTER IV.    ON WATER BAPTISM.    _Liverpool, June_ 14, 1847.    Reverend and Dear Sir,--You, sir, need no argument to convince you that  WATER BAPTISM is the first ordinance, after faith and repentance, that  initiates the believer into the kingdom of God.    The kingdom of God is to be established upon the earth, according to  the pattern of the heavenly order, which is the first principle taught  in the memorable prayer of our Lord Jesus Christ, which prayer will be  pertinent to all believers on earth, until the object of the prayer is  fully achieved and the kingdoms of this world have universally become  the kingdom of God. And if we were to search the kingdom of God from  one end to the other, and from side to side, we should not find a  single adult believer in the whole heaven, who had not been _baptized_  with water.    Do you ask why I make such a bold declaration, and how I know this  seemingly exclusive and uncharitable truth? I know it, sir, by the  voice of God from the heavens, and this voice is to you as well as me,  if you will receive it. Do not you believe the scripture that saith,  \"except a man be born of the WATER and of the spirit, he cannot enter  into the kingdom of God?\" I know that you believe this scripture, and  am persuaded that your ingenuous mind will not seek to pervert it from  its plain and obvious import.    Whatever an over-jealous mind may fear concerning the state of the  penitent thief on the cross, and of devout and upright men that have  lived and died in every age of the world, still let God's word be  accounted true, and every man that gainsays it be esteemed a liar!  No man ever puts on the uniform of Christ's followers, such as is  worn by subjects of the kingdom of Christ, until he is \"baptized into  Christ\" for \"_remission of sins_.\" Hereby he \"puts on Christ,\" When  an ambassador of Christ finds a man or woman that heartily repents  of his or her rebellion against the laws of Christ, he baptizes him  unto repentance for \"remission of sins.\" By the ordinance of baptism,  the rebellious subject virtually says, I hereby signify to all men my  repentance; and the lawful administrator as virtually says, on the part  of Jesus Christ, whose Ambassador I am, (being called by revelation,  and being authorized to act in his name and for him), I pronounce this  person's sins _remitted_, according to his genuine repentance and faith  in Christ.    Now, sir, what objection can there be for a man sent from God to remit  sins by baptism, in the name and by the authority of the King of  heaven? If Christ has power on earth to forgive and remit sins, may He  not send forgiveness and remission by another, even by whom he will?  And will not such a remission and forgiveness of sins be as valid as  though He administered the ordinance of baptism himself? Undoubtedly  it will be indisputably valid. And what ordinance is so beautifully  significant as that which expresses both the penitence of the subject  and the cordial acceptance of the Ruler and Lord?    Has not Jesus Christ a right to remit sins by baptism unto repentance?  Who shall say that the penitent believer's sins are not remitted by  baptism? Who shall lay any sins to his charge? Is it not God that  justifies? Has not Christ died? Has he not a right to say who are fit  subjects for baptism? Has he not a right to say by what ordinance sins  shall be remitted? He has never said that repentance and faith shall  secure remission of sins to any one without baptism. It is not in the  power of any man or angel to find a license in the Bible to receive a  person into the kingdom of God without baptism. Jesus Christ has never  given any license, but, on the other hand. He has explicitly said, in  the most unequivocal language possible, that NO MAN can \"enter the  kingdom\" without water baptism, or being \"born of the water.\"    Do you ask, if I call baptism a saving ordinance? I reply, that  repentance and faith will not save any body in the kingdom of God  without baptism. Some men, whose crimes are unpardonable in this  world, may, and doubtless do, repent and believe; but they cannot be  baptized for the remission of sins, nor forgiven \"until the times of  refreshing come from the presence of the Lord in the restitution of all  things.\" Righteous Noah was \"_saved_ by water;\" and the apostle Peter,  rehearsing the fact, says that baptism _saved_ believers in his day in  _like_ manner.    You, sir, must be perfectly aware that Jesus Christ has said, by the  mouth of his servant John, that BAPTISM constitutes no less importance  of character than one of the THREE GREAT WITNESESS of adoption and  citizenship into the kingdom of God on the earth--the SPIRIT, the  WATER, and the BLOOD. These three bear witness on the earth and agree  in one. One of these THREE performs the double office of bearing  witness on the earth, and also of bearing record in heaven. Three  witnesses appear to be requisite in order to prove our title good  to a place in the kingdom of God; and the testimony of these THREE,  and nothing less, is recorded in heaven by the Father, Son, and Holy  Ghost. Who will dare to say that the THREE in heaven will accept of the  testimony of the two witnesses on earth, when God has explicitly said  that he requires the testimony of THREE, and nothing less?    Do we forget that all men are to be judged out of the books? And  if the books show the absence of one WITNESS, and the consequent  _disagreement_ of the three before named, can that person that is thus  deficient of testimony, stand acquitted from the books out of which he  is judged? By no means! The THREE witnesses will agree in one; and when  they agree, the Spirit will bear the testimony of the Water and the  Blood to the recording angel, and these united with his own seal, will  be placed on record until the books are brought forward for judging the  nations of the earth.    Furthermore, no man can ever be born of the Spirit until he has first  been born of the water. The Holy Ghost will never condescend to become  the covenant-guide and instructor, and holy comforter of any one,  until he has been baptized or born of water. Have ye received the Holy  Ghost _since_ ye were baptized? Peter told penitent believers that  they might receive the Holy Ghost _after_ they were baptized; so said  John the Baptist to those he baptized. If, in a single instance, the  Holy Ghost was given before baptism, still it was no part of Christ's  instructions to his apostles ever to confer the Holy Ghost until  _after_ baptism--and then it was to be done by the laying on of hands.    Men may receive a measure of the Spirit of God before baptism (even  as a child has in embryo the germ of life before parturition); but no  one has a large measure of the Spirit, nor has any covenant claim to  the Spirit, or, in other words, can be born of the Spirit, until he  has been baptized in water. \"Jesus came by water,\" and was baptized  in water for the remission of the original sin of the world. He knew  that baptism for remission of sin was necessary as an example, and also  that by his \"_obedience_ many might be made _righteous_\" even as by the  \"_offence_ of one, many were made _sinners_.\" Jesus needed not only the  testimony of water-baptism, but also, _after_ baptism, the testimony  of the other witness--the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost was a personage  inferior in office to himself, but still the Holy Ghost was conferred  upon him, while coming out of the water, in \"the form of a dove.\"    The third witness to adoption"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45899"],[0,"Studies of Travel: Italy (#9)"],[1,"at the prayer of his wife has a specially Roman character.  Parted as the hill is from the Tiber on three sides, its northern  point, the point of a rather long promontory, overhangs the river at  the very point of its junction with the Anio. Hence, it would seem, the  descriptive name _Antemnae_, the town before the rivers. Such a site  belongs to the same class as the hills of Rome. Less isolated than the  Palatine or the Aventine, it is as much isolated as the Capitoline was  while it still clave to the Quirinal. Such a site, with a descriptive  name, can hardly belong to the earliest times; it marks the same degree  of progress as the settlement of Rome itself. Cut off as it was from  the oldest Rome by the whole of the high ground within and without  the Roman walls, such a settlement on the river, a settlement so like  Rome itself, might well be felt to be a special rival, a rival which  must cease to exist as a hostile post, but whose people might well be  incorporated with their more successful kinsfolk.    Of a tale placed in a time which is purely legendary, the utmost that  we can say is that the legend falls in with the appearances of the  site. Antemnae has utterly perished; there is not a scrap of wall; some  stones which deceive the eye at a distance prove, on coming near, to  be part of the rock peeping out through the sides of the otherwise  green hill. We believe that no antiquities have been found there.  But the site speaks for itself. It is a manifest fortress; the gates  are as plain as if their openings were spanned by arches like those  of Perugia or Trier. We look out on Fidenae and its surroundings, on  the old battlefields of kings and consuls and emperors; on the bridge  of Narses and Garibaldi, on the line of march which brought the  Gaul, the Carthaginian, the Samnite, and the Goth to the gates, and  some of them within the gates, of Rome. We can look down on nearly  the whole of Roman history from the site where once stood Virgil's  \"turrigerae Antemnae.\" But we are yet farther from being able to tell the  towers thereof than we were at Veii and Fidenae. At Antemnae the ruins  themselves have perished.          Ostia.      From the nearest neighbours and rivals of Rome, from the slight  remains which mark the sites of Veii and Fidenae, from the almost more  instructive lack of remains which marks the site of Antemnae, we may  well pass to a spot which lies at a greater distance from Rome than any  of them, but which never was Rome's rival or even neighbour, because  it was from the beginning simply an outlying part of Rome itself. This  is the forsaken haven of Rome at Ostia. The existence of Ostia at an  early stage of the historic being of Rome is no small sign of what  Rome already was, and it may well have had no small share in making  Rome what she afterwards was to be. For an inland town like Rome to  possess a haven of its own, existing solely as its haven, at once  marked and strengthened the difference between Rome and other inland  towns. For Ostia, it must be borne in mind, was the haven of Rome and  nothing else. It was not a separate maritime city made into the haven  of Rome by any process of conquest or confederation. Tradition makes  Ostia spring into being because it was found that Rome needed a haven.  And the tradition has nothing to contradict it and all likelihood to  support it; the name of the place by itself might almost be accepted as  proving its truth. The foundation of Ostia, too, is placed in a period  which is eminently a traditional, as distinguished from a legendary,  period. It is safer not to rule either that there was a personal  Ancus Marcius or that there was not; but we may be pretty sure that  the events assigned to his reign really happened, if we can only keep  ourselves from attempting dates where there is no chronology. Tradition  then calls Ancus the founder of Ostia. The really important point is  that whoever founded Ostia founded it purely in the interest of Rome,  and that in an age when Rome was still in the days of her early growth.    This at once marks a wide difference between Rome and other cities  of that time. Even the most famous of the early seats of maritime  enterprise had the port separate from the city, later than the city.  Corinth herself had her two havens, apart alike from her mountain  citadel and from the venerable columns at its foot. When Corinth  started in life men shrank from the close neighbourhood of the sea.  It marks a later stage when Corinthian enterprise planted colonies  absolutely in the sea--Syracuse on her island, the elder Korkyra on  her peninsula. It was not till long after Ostia had arisen that inland  Athens yoked herself to the sea. But, as the site of Rome itself on  the broad Tiber showed that men had even then learned to understand  the value of sites widely different from Tusculum on her height or  Veii with her encircling brooks, so the creation of Ostia proves yet  more. Rome, far more distant from the sea than Corinth, Megara, or  even Athens, had already learned that a hold on the sea was needful  for her power. There could have been nothing like it in Italy. There  were inland cities and there were maritime cities; but there was no  inland city which had put forth a maritime outpost at such a distance.  Indeed, no other city had put forth such an outpost at all, maritime  or otherwise. For Ostia was not a colony, not a dependency. It had  no separate being of its own. It was a limb of Rome transplanted to a  distance of fifteen Italian miles from the main body.    Ostia, then, called into being because Rome stood on the Tiber, is  eminently a child of the Tiber. But Father Tiber is unluckily one of  those fathers who do not scruple to swallow up their own children. He  has changed his course, and he has changed it in a way which is not a  little dangerous for what is still left of Ostia. The diggings which  have been carried on by the Italian Government are most praiseworthy,  and they have brought to light much that is most interesting and  instructive. But streets, storehouses, temples, theatres, will in  vain be dug out if the ravenous river god is to gulp them down as soon  as they are well dug out. At the present moment one street, with its  pavement laid bare, with its buildings still standing on each side,  leads in a perilous manner into the stream. That is to say, one end  is gone; the rest will soon follow; the pieces of wall nearest to  the stream are crumbling to their fall. Surely it would be well to  imitate in the haven of Ancus the work done for the mother-city by his  successor. Fence in the flood, as the elder Tarquin fenced it in beside  the mouth of the _cloaca maxima_; make a strong wall of defence against  the waters, and the remains which are left of Ostia may abide as long  as the _cloaca maxima_ itself.    And what is left of Ostia is indeed worth preserving. Only a small  part of the town has as yet been dug out; but, even as it is, Ostia  is becoming a fair rival to Pompeii. The interest, indeed, is of a  somewhat different kind in the two places. Pompeii will come first  with the artist and Ostia with the historian. Nothing of any moment  ever happened at Pompeii except the destruction and the discovery  of Pompeii itself. But a great deal happened at Ostia, and that at  widely distant dates. It is perhaps needless to mention that one thing  which is said to have happened at Ostia never happened either there  or anywhere else--namely, destruction by the Saracens in the _fifth_  century, which is recorded indeed in Murray's \"Handbook,\" but which was  certainly unknown to Procopius. Ostia, destroyed by Marius, restored  by Sulla, was failing in the days of Strabo to discharge its duty as  the haven of Rome. It had yielded to the same enemy which afterwards  overcame Ravenna and Pisa; the silt of Father Tiber was too much for  it. Yet, notwithstanding this misfortune, notwithstanding the change  which it led to, when Claudius found it needful to transfer the harbour  of Rome to Portus on the other side of the river, Ostia contrived to  live on through all disadvantages. For it has many and great buildings  later than Strabo and Claudius, among them an Imperial house with  graceful columns, which contains the famous shrine of Mithras. There is  abundant evidence that all through the second century of our aera great  architectural works were carried on at Ostia. Besides the palace, there  is the great central temple, be it of Jupiter or of Vulcan, standing so  proudly on its steps. There is a theatre whose columns and inscriptions  supply no small materials for study, a theatre of which it might be  too much to say that it suggests those of Orange or Taormina, but which  certainly suggests that of Arles.    In the sixth century Procopius describes Ostia as lacking walls, and he  complains that the road from Ostia to Rome did not follow the course  of the river, and was therefore useless as a towing-path. This is  eminently true still. The road goes through scenery of various kinds,  some rather English-looking, though none very striking; the Tiber  makes a far less important feature than we might have looked for. But,  if Ostia had no walls in the days of Belisarius, it had no lack of  walls in earlier days. The most interesting, from one point of view,  among the ruins of Ostia are the remains, forming part of two sides  of a square, of the primitive wall, a dry wall of massive stones,  belonging no doubt to the period of the first foundation. These were  clearly ruinous when the later brick buildings were reared; the wall  was broken down, and men built against and upon it; they plastered it;  they chamfered its stones for the convenience of plastering, as best  suited their purpose. The flourishing town of the second century may  well have been wall-less. Rome herself at that date had no defence. The  wall of Servius had ceased to serve any military"]]]
