Not  until he had made a closer inspection of the living-room did he  discover that the Shack also had a telephone.    By that time he noted that the sun had gone out. Driving up from the  west was a mass of storm clouds. He unlocked a door from which he could  look up the river, and the wind that was riding softly in advance of  the storm ruffled his hair and cooled his face. In it he caught again  the old fancy--the smells of the vast reaches of unpeopled prairie  beyond the rim of the forest, and the luring chill of the distant  mountain tops. Always storm that came down with the river brought to  him voice from the river's end. It came to him from the great mountains  that were a passion with him; it seemed to thunder to him the old  stories of the mightiest fastnesses of the Rockies and stirred in him  the child-bred yearning to follow up his beloved river until he came at  last to the mystery of its birthplace in the cradle of the western  ranges. And now, as he faced the storm, the grip of that desire held  him like a strong hand.    The sky blackened swiftly, and with the rumbling of far-away thunder he  saw the lightning slitting the dark heaven like bayonets, and the fire  of the electrical charges galloped to him and filled his veins. His  heart all at once cried out words that his lips did not utter. Why  should he not answer the call that had come to him through all the  years? Now was the time--and why should he not go? Why tempt fate in  the hazard of a great adventure where home and friends and even hope  were dead to him, when off there beyond the storm was the place of his  dreams? He threw out his arms. His voice broke at last in a cry of  strange ecstasy. Not everything was gone! Not everything was dead! Over  the graveyard of his past there was sweeping a mighty force that called  him, something that was no longer merely an urge and a demand but a  thing that was irresistible. He would go! Tomorrow--today--tonight--he  would begin making plans!    He watched the deluge as it came on with a roar of wind, a beating,  hissing wall under which the tree tops down in the edge of the plain  bent their heads like a multitude of people in prayer. He saw it  sweeping up the slope in a mass of gray dragoons. It caught him before  he had closed the door, and his face dripped with wet as he forced the  last inch of it against the wind with his shoulder. It was the sort of  storm Keith liked. The thunder was the rumble of a million giant  cartwheels rolling overhead.    Inside the bungalow it was growing dark as though evening had come. He  dropped on his knees before the pile of dry fuel in the fireplace and  struck a match. For a space the blaze smoldered; then the birch fired  up like oil-soaked tinder, and a yellow flame crackled and roared up  the flue. Keith was sensitive in the matter of smoking other people's  pipes, so he drew out his own and filled it with Brady's tobacco. It  was an English mixture, rich and aromatic, and as the fire burned  brighter and the scent of the tobacco filled the room, he dropped into  Brady's big lounging chair and stretched out his legs with a deep  breath of satisfaction. His thoughts wandered to the clash of the  storm. He would have a place like this out there in the mystery of the  trackless mountains, where the Saskatchewan was born. He would build it  like Brady's place, even to the rain-water tank midway between the roof  and the ground. And after a few years no one would remember that a man  named John Keith had ever lived.    Something brought him suddenly to his feet. It was the ringing of the  telephone. After four years the sound was one that roused with an  uncomfortable jump every nerve in his body. Probably it was McDowell  calling up about the Jap or to ask how he liked the place. Probably--it  was that. He repeated the thought aloud as he laid his pipe on the  table. And yet as his hand came in contact with the telephone, he felt  an inclination to draw back. A subtle voice whispered him not to  answer, to leave while the storm was dark, to go back into the  wilderness, to fight his way to the western mountains.    With a jerk he unhooked the receiver and put it to his ear.    It was not McDowell who answered him. It was not Shan Tung. To his  amazement, coming to him through the tumult of the storm, he recognized  the voice of Miriam Kirkstone!          VII      Why should Miriam Kirkstone call him up in an hour when the sky was  livid with the flash of lightning and the earth trembled with the roll  of thunder? This was the question that filled Keith's mind as he  listened to the voice at the other end of the wire. It was pitched to a  high treble as if unconsciously the speaker feared that the storm might  break in upon her words. She was telling him that she had telephoned  McDowell but had been too late to catch him before he left for Brady's  bungalow; she was asking him to pardon her for intruding upon his time  so soon after his return, but she was sure that he would understand  her. She wanted him to come up to see her that evening at eight  o'clock. It was important--to her. Would he come?    Before Keith had taken a moment to consult with himself he had replied  that he would. He heard her \"thank you,\" her \"good-by,\" and hung up the  receiver, stunned. So far as he could remember, he had spoken no more  than seven words. The beautiful young woman up at the Kirkstone mansion  had clearly betrayed her fear of the lightning by winding up her  business with him at the earliest possible moment. Why, then, had she  not waited until the storm was over?    A pounding at the door interrupted his thought. He went to it and  admitted an individual who, in spite of his water-soaked condition, was  smiling all over. It was Wallie, the Jap. He was no larger than a boy  of sixteen, and from eyes, ears, nose, and hair he was dripping  streams, while his coat bulged with packages which he had struggled to  protect, from the torrent through which he had forced his way up the  hill. Keith liked him on the instant. He found himself powerless to  resist the infection of Wallie's grin, and as Wallie hustled into the  kitchen like a wet spaniel, he followed and helped him unload. By the  time the little Jap had disgorged his last package, he had assured  Keith that the rain was nice, that his name was Wallie, that he  expected five dollars a week and could cook \"like heaven.\" Keith  laughed outright, and Wallie was so delighted with the general outlook  that he fairly kicked his heels together. Thereafter for an hour or so  he was left alone in possession of the kitchen, and shortly Keith began  to hear certain sounds and catch occasional odoriferous whiffs which  assured him that Wallie was losing no time in demonstrating his divine  efficiency in the matter of cooking.    Wallie's coming gave him an excuse to call up McDowell. He confessed to  a disquieting desire to hear the inspector's voice again. In the back  of his head was the fear of Shan Tung, and the hope that McDowell might  throw some light on Miriam Kirkstone's unusual request to see her that  night. The storm had settled down into a steady drizzle when he got in  touch with him, and he was relieved to find there was no change in the  friendliness of the voice that came over the telephone. If Shan Tung  had a suspicion, he had kept it to himself.    To Keith's surprise it was McDowell who spoke first of Miss Kirkstone.    \"She seemed unusually anxious to get in touch with you,\" he said. \"I am  frankly disturbed over a certain matter, Conniston, and I should like  to talk with you before you go up tonight.\"    Keith sniffed the air. \"Wallie is going to ring the dinner bell within  half an hour. Why not slip on a raincoat and join me up here? I think  it's going to be pretty good.\"    \"I'll come,\" said McDowell. \"Expect me any moment.\"    Fifteen minutes later Keith was helping him off with his wet slicker.  He had expected McDowell to make some observation on the cheerfulness  of the birch fire and the agreeable aromas that were leaking from  Wallie's kitchen, but the inspector disappointed him. He stood for a  few moments with his back to the fire, thumbing down the tobacco in his  pipe, and he made no effort to conceal the fact that there was  something in his mind more important than dinner and the cheer of a  grate.    His eyes fell on the telephone, and he nodded toward it. \"Seemed very  anxious to see you, didn't she, Conniston? I mean Miss Kirkstone.\"    \"Rather.\"    McDowell seated himself and lighted a match. \"Seemed--a  little--nervous--perhaps,\" he suggested between puffs. \"As though  something had happened--or was going to happen. Don't mind my  questioning you, do you, Derry?\"    \"Not a bit,\" said Keith. \"You see, I thought perhaps you might  explain--\"    There was a disquieting gleam in McDowell's eyes. \"It was odd that she  should call you up so soon--and in the storm--wasn't it? She expected  to find you at my office. I could fairly hear the lightning hissing  along the wires. She must have been under some unusual impulse.\"    \"Perhaps.\"    McDowell was silent for a space, looking steadily at Keith, as if  measuring him up to something.    \"I don't mind telling you that I am very deeply interested in Miss  Kirkstone,\" he said. \"You didn't see her when the Judge was killed. She  was away at school, and you were on John Keith's trail when she  returned. I have never been much of a woman's man, Conniston, but I  tell you frankly that up until six or eight months ago Miriam was one  of the most beautiful girls I have ever seen. I would give a good deal  to know the exact hour and date when the change in her began. I might  be able to trace some event to that date. It was six months ago that  she began to take an interest in the fate of John Keith. Since then the  change in her has alarmed me, Conniston. I don't understand.

He rose up on his feet. He forgot where he  was--forgot everything in the world but those playing, furry balls. For  the moment all the hard training nature had been giving him was lost.  He was no longer a fighter, no longer a hunter, no longer a seeker  after food. He was a puppy, and in him there rose a desire that was  greater than hunger. He wanted to go down there with Umisk and his  little chums and roll and play. He wanted to tell them, if such a thing  were possible, that he had lost his mother and his home, and that he  had been having a mighty hard time of it, and that he would like to  stay with them and their mothers and fathers if they didn't mind.    In his throat there came the least bit of a whine. It was so low that  Umisk and his playmates did not hear it. They were tremendously busy.    Softly Baree took his first step toward them, and then another--and at  last he stood on the narrow strip of shore within half a dozen feet of  them. His sharp little ears were pitched forward, and he was wiggling  his tail as fast as he could, and every muscle in his body was  trembling in anticipation.    It was then that Umisk saw him, and his fat little body became suddenly  as motionless as a stone.    \"Hello!\" said Baree, wiggling his whole body and talking as plainly as  a human tongue could talk. \"Do you care if I play with you?\"    Umisk made no response. His three playmates now had their eyes on  Baree. They didn't make a move. They looked stunned. Four pairs of  staring, wondering eyes were fixed on the stranger.    Baree made another effort. He groveled on his forelegs, while his tail  and hind legs continued to wiggle, and with a sniff he grabbed a bit of  stick between his teeth.    \"Come on--let me in,\" he urged. \"I know how to play!\"    He tossed the stick in the air as if to prove what he was saying, and  gave a little yap.    Umisk and his brothers were like dummies.    And then, of a sudden, someone saw Baree. It was a big beaver swimming  down the pond with a sapling timber for the new dam that was under way.  Instantly he loosed his hold and faced the shore. And then, like the  report of a rifle, there came the crack of his big flat tail on the  water--the beaver's signal of danger that on a quiet night can be heard  half a mile away.    \"DANGER,\" it warned. \"DANGER--DANGER--DANGER!\"    Scarcely had the signal gone forth when tails were cracking in all  directions--in the pond, in the hidden canals, in the thick willows and  alders. To Umisk and his companions they said:    \"RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!\"    Baree stood rigid and motionless now. In amazement he watched the four  little beavers plunge into the pond and disappear. He heard the sounds  of other and heavier bodies striking the water. And then there followed  a strange and disquieting silence. Softly Baree whined, and his whine  was almost a sobbing cry. Why had Umisk and his little mates run away  from him? What had he done that they didn't want to make friends with  him? A great loneliness swept over him--a loneliness greater even than  that of his first night away from his mother. The last of the sun faded  out of the sky as he stood there. Darker shadows crept over the pond.  He looked into the forest, where night was gathering--and with another  whining cry he slunk back into it. He had not found friendship. He had  not found comradeship. And his heart was very sad.        CHAPTER 7    For two or three days Baree's excursions after food took him farther  and farther away from the pond. But each afternoon he returned to  it--until the third day, when he discovered a new creek, and Wakayoo.  The creek was fully two miles back in the forest. This was a different  sort of stream. It sang merrily over a gravelly bed and between chasm  walls of split rock. It formed deep pools and foaming eddies, and where  Baree first struck it, the air trembled with the distant thunder of a  waterfall. It was much pleasanter than the dark and silent beaver  stream. It seemed possessed of life, and the rush and tumult of it--the  song and thunder of the water--gave to Baree entirely new sensations.  He made his way along it slowly and cautiously, and it was because of  this slowness and caution that he came suddenly and unobserved upon  Wakayoo, the big black bear, hard at work fishing.    Wakayoo stood knee-deep in a pool that had formed behind a sand bar,  and he was having tremendously good luck. Even as Baree shrank back,  his eyes popping at sight of this monster he had seen but once before,  in the gloom of night, one of Wakayoo's big paws sent a great splash of  water high in the air, and a fish landed on the pebbly shore. A little  while before, the suckers had run up the creek in thousands to spawn,  and the rapid lowering of the water had caught many of them in these  prison pools. Wakayoo's fat, sleek body was evidence of the prosperity  this circumstance had brought him. Although it was a little past the  \"prime\" season for bearskins, Wakayoo's coat was splendidly thick and  black.    For a quarter of an hour Baree watched him while he knocked fish out of  the pool. When at last he stopped, there were twenty or thirty fish  among the stones, some of them dead and others still flopping. From  where he lay flattened out between two rocks, Baree could hear the  crunching of flesh and bone as the bear devoured his dinner. It sounded  good, and the fresh smell of fish filled him with a craving that had  never been roused by crayfish or even partridge.    In spite of his fat and his size, Wakayoo was not a glutton, and after  he had eaten his fourth fish he pawed all the others together in a  pile, partly covered them by raking up sand and stones with his long  claws, and finished his work of caching by breaking down a small balsam  sapling so that the fish were entirely concealed. Then he lumbered  slowly away in the direction of the rumbling waterfall.    Twenty seconds after the last of Wakayoo had disappeared in a turn of  the creek, Baree was under the broken balsam. He dragged out a fish  that was still alive. He ate the whole of it, and it tasted delicious.    Baree now found that Wakayoo had solved the food problem for him, and  this day he did not return to the beaver pond, nor the next. The big  bear was incessantly fishing up and down the creek, and day after day  Baree continued his feasts. It was not difficult for him to find  Wakayoo's caches. All he had to do was to follow along the shore of the  stream, sniffing carefully. Some of the caches were getting old, and  their perfume was anything but pleasant to Baree. These he avoided--but  he never missed a meal or two out of a fresh one.    For a week life continued to be exceedingly pleasant. And then came the  break--the change that was destined to meant for Kazan, his father,  when he killed the man-brute at the edge of the wilderness.    This change came or the day when, in trotting around a great rock near  the waterfall, Baree found himself face to face with Pierrot the hunter  and Nepeese, the star-eyed girl who had shot him in the edge of the  clearing.    It was Nepeese whom he saw first. If it had been Pierrot, he would have  turned back quickly. But again the blood of his forebear was rousing  strange tremblings within him. Was it like this that the first woman  had looked to Kazan?    Baree stood still. Nepeese was not more than twenty feet from him. She  sat on a rock, full in the early morning sun, and was brushing out her  wonderful hair. Her lips parted. Her eyes shone in an instant like  stars. One hand remained poised, weighted with the jet tresses. She  recognized him. She saw the white star on his breast and the white tip  on his ear, and under her breath she whispered \"Uchi moosis!\"--\"The dog  pup!\" It was the wild dog she had shot--and thought had died!    The evening before Pierrot and Nepeese had built a shelter of balsams  behind the big rock, and on a small white plot of sand Pierrot was  kneeling over a fire preparing breakfast while the Willow arranged her  hair. He raised his head to speak to her, and saw Baree. In that  instant the spell was broken. Baree saw the man-beast as he rose to his  feet. Like a shot he was gone.    Scarcely swifter was he than Nepeese.    \"Depechez vous, mon pere!\" she cried. \"It is the dog pup! Quick--\"    In the floating cloud of her hair she sped after Baree like the wind.  Pierrot followed, and in going he caught up his rifle. It was difficult  for him to catch up with the Willow. She was like a wild spirit, her  little moccasined feet scarcely touching the sand as she ran up the  long bar. It was wonderful to see the lithe swiftness of her, and that  glorious hair streaming out in the sun. Even now, in this moment's  excitement, it made Pierrot think of McTaggart, the Hudson's Bay  Company's factor over at Lac Bain, and what he had said yesterday. Half  the night Pierrot had lain awake, gritting his teeth at thought of it.  And this morning, before Baree ran upon them, he had looked at Nepeese  more closely than ever before in his life. She was beautiful. She was  lovelier even than Wyola, her princess mother, who was dead. That  hair--which made men stare as if they could not believe! Those  eyes--like pools filled with wonderful starlight! Her slimness, that  was like a flower! And McTaggart had said--    Floating back to him there came an excited cry.    \"Hurry, Nootawe! He has turned into the blind canyon. He cannot escape  us now.\"    She was panting when he came up to her. The French blood in her glowed  a vivid crimson in her cheeks and lips. Her white teeth gleamed like  pearls.    \"In there!\" And she pointed.    They went in.    Ahead of them Baree was running for his life. He sensed instinctively  the fact that these wonderful two-legged beings he had looked upon were  all-powerful. And they were after him! He could"]]]
