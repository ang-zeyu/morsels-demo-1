So at last he came to the Sign of the Blue Boar. \"For,\" quoth he to  himself, \"our good friend Eadom will tell me all the news.\"    At the Sign of the Blue Boar he found a band of the Sheriffs men  drinking right lustily; so, without speaking to anyone, he sat down upon  a distant bench, his staff in his hand, and his head bowed forward as  though he were meditating. Thus he sat waiting until he might see the  landlord apart, and Eadom did not know him, but thought him to be some  poor tired friar, so he let him sit without saying a word to him or  molesting him, though he liked not the cloth. \"For,\" said he to himself,  \"it is a hard heart that kicks the lame dog from off the sill.\" As  Stutely sat thus, there came a great house cat and rubbed against his  knee, raising his robe a palm's-breadth high. Stutely pushed his robe  quickly down again, but the constable who commanded the Sheriffs men  saw what had passed, and saw also fair Lincoln green beneath the friar's  robe. He said nothing at the time, but communed within himself in this  wise: \"Yon is no friar of orders gray, and also, I wot, no honest yeoman  goeth about in priest's garb, nor doth a thief go so for nought. Now I  think in good sooth that is one of Robin Hood's own men.\" So, presently,  he said aloud, \"O holy father, wilt thou not take a good pot of March  beer to slake thy thirsty soul withal?\"    But Stutely shook his head silently, for he said to himself, \"Maybe  there be those here who know my voice.\"    Then the constable said again, \"Whither goest thou, holy friar, upon  this hot summer's day?\"    \"I go a pilgrim to Canterbury Town,\" answered Will Stutely, speaking  gruffly, so that none might know his voice.    Then the constable said, for the third time, \"Now tell me, holy father,  do pilgrims to Canterbury wear good Lincoln green beneath their robes?  Ha! By my faith, I take thee to be some lusty thief, and perhaps one of  Robin Hood's own band! Now, by Our Lady's grace, if thou movest hand or  foot, I will run thee through the body with my sword!\"    Then he flashed forth his bright sword and leaped upon Will Stutely,  thinking he would take him unaware; but Stutely had his own sword  tightly held in his hand, beneath his robe, so he drew it forth before  the constable came upon him. Then the stout constable struck a mighty  blow; but he struck no more in all that fight, for Stutely, parrying the  blow right deftly, smote the constable back again with all his might.  Then he would have escaped, but could not, for the other, all dizzy with  the wound and with the flowing blood, seized him by the knees with his  arms even as he reeled and fell. Then the others rushed upon him, and  Stutely struck again at another of the Sheriff's men, but the steel  cap glanced the blow, and though the blade bit deep, it did not kill.  Meanwhile, the constable, fainting as he was, drew Stutely downward, and  the others, seeing the yeoman hampered so, rushed upon him again, and  one smote him a blow upon the crown so that the blood ran down his face  and blinded him. Then, staggering, he fell, and all sprang upon him,  though he struggled so manfully that they could hardly hold him fast.  Then they bound him with stout hempen cords so that he could not move  either hand or foot, and thus they overcame him.    Robin Hood stood under the greenwood tree, thinking of Will Stutely and  how he might be faring, when suddenly he saw two of his stout yeomen  come running down the forest path, and betwixt them ran buxom Maken  of the Blue Boar. Then Robin's heart fell, for he knew they were the  bearers of ill tidings.    \"Will Stutely hath been taken,\" cried they, when they had come to where  he stood.    \"And is it thou that hast brought such doleful news?\" said Robin to the  lass.    \"Ay, marry, for I saw it all,\" cried she, panting as the hare pants when  it has escaped the hounds, \"and I fear he is wounded sore, for one smote  him main shrewdly i' the crown. They have bound him and taken him to  Nottingham Town, and ere I left the Blue Boar I heard that he should be  hanged tomorrow day.\"    \"He shall not be hanged tomorrow day,\" cried Robin; \"or, if he be,  full many a one shall gnaw the sod, and many shall have cause to cry  Alack-a-day!\"    Then he clapped his horn to his lips and blew three blasts right loudly,  and presently his good yeomen came running through the greenwood until  sevenscore bold blades were gathered around him.    \"Now hark you all!\" cried Robin. \"Our dear companion Will Stutely hath  been taken by that vile Sheriff's men, therefore doth it behoove us to  take bow and brand in hand to bring him off again; for I wot that we  ought to risk life and limb for him, as he hath risked life and limb for  us. Is it not so, my merry men all?\" Then all cried, \"Ay!\" with a great  voice.    So the next day they all wended their way from Sherwood Forest, but by  different paths, for it behooved them to be very crafty; so the band  separated into parties of twos and threes, which were all to meet again  in a tangled dell that lay near to Nottingham Town. Then, when they had  all gathered together at the place of meeting, Robin spoke to them thus:    \"Now we will lie here in ambush until we can get news, for it doth  behoove us to be cunning and wary if we would bring our friend Will  Stutely off from the Sheriff's clutches.\"    So they lay hidden a long time, until the sun stood high in the sky. The  day was warm and the dusty road was bare of travelers, except an aged  palmer who walked slowly along the highroad that led close beside  the gray castle wall of Nottingham Town. When Robin saw that no other  wayfarer was within sight, he called young David of Doncaster, who was  a shrewd man for his years, and said to him, \"Now get thee forth, young  David, and speak to yonder palmer that walks beside the town wall, for  he hath come but now from Nottingham Town, and may tell thee news of  good Stutely, perchance.\"    So David strode forth, and when he came up to the pilgrim, he saluted  him and said, \"Good morrow, holy father, and canst thou tell me when  Will Stutely will be hanged upon the gallows tree? I fain would not miss  the sight, for I have come from afar to see so sturdy a rogue hanged.\"    \"Now, out upon thee, young man,\" cried the Palmer, \"that thou shouldst  speak so when a good stout man is to be hanged for nothing but guarding  his own life!\" And he struck his staff upon the ground in anger. \"Alas,  say I, that this thing should be! For even this day, toward evening,  when the sun falleth low, he shall be hanged, fourscore rods from the  great town gate of Nottingham, where three roads meet; for there  the Sheriff sweareth he shall die as a warning to all outlaws in  Nottinghamshire. But yet, I say again, Alas! For, though Robin Hood and  his band may be outlaws, yet he taketh only from the rich and the strong  and the dishonest man, while there is not a poor widow nor a peasant  with many children, nigh to Sherwood, but has barley flour enough all  the year long through him. It grieves my heart to see one as gallant as  this Stutely die, for I have been a good Saxon yeoman in my day, ere  I turned palmer, and well I know a stout hand and one that smiteth  shrewdly at a cruel Norman or a proud abbot with fat moneybags. Had good  Stutely's master but known how his man was compassed about with perils,  perchance he might send succor to bring him out of the hand of his  enemies.    \"Ay, marry, that is true,\" cried the young man. \"If Robin and his men  be nigh this place, I wot right well they will strive to bring him forth  from his peril. But fare thee well, thou good old man, and believe me,  if Will Stutely die, he shall be right well avenged.\"    Then he turned and strode rapidly away; but the Palmer looked after him,  muttering, \"I wot that youth is no country hind that hath come to see  a good man die. Well, well, perchance Robin Hood is not so far away  but that there will be stout doings this day.\" So he went upon his way,  muttering to himself.    When David of Doncaster told Robin Hood what the Palmer had said to him,  Robin called the band around him and spoke to them thus:    \"Now let us get straightway into Nottingham Town and mix ourselves with  the people there; but keep ye one another in sight, pressing as near  the prisoner and his guards as ye can, when they come outside the walls.  Strike no man without need, for I would fain avoid bloodshed, but if ye  do strike, strike hard, and see that there be no need to strike again.  Then keep all together until we come again to Sherwood, and let no man  leave his fellows.\"    The sun was low in the western sky when a bugle note sounded from the  castle wall. Then all was bustle in Nottingham Town and crowds filled  the streets, for all knew that the famous Will Stutely was to be hanged  that day. Presently the castle gates opened wide and a great array of  men-at-arms came forth with noise and clatter, the Sheriff, all clad in  shining mail of linked chain, riding at their head. In the midst of all  the guard, in a cart, with a halter about his neck, rode Will Stutely.  His face was pale with his wound and with loss of blood, like the moon  in broad daylight, and his fair hair was clotted in points upon his  forehead, where the blood had hardened. When he came forth from the  castle he looked up and he looked down, but though he saw some faces  that showed pity and some that showed friendliness, he saw none that  he knew. Then his heart sank within him like a plummet of lead, but  nevertheless he spoke up boldly.    \"Give a sword into my hand, Sir Sheriff,\" said he, \"and wounded man  though I be, I will fight thee and all thy men till life and strength be  gone.\"    \"Nay, thou naughty varlet,\" quoth the Sheriff, turning his head and  looking right grimly upon Will Stutely, \"thou shalt have no sword but  shall die a mean death, as beseemeth a vile thief like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/965"],[0,"The Black Tulip (#9)"],[1,"in the  town.    In the same degree as Cornelius de Witt had excited the hatred of the  people by sowing those evil seeds which are called political passions,  Van Baerle had gained the affections of his fellow citizens by  completely shunning the pursuit of politics, absorbed as he was in the  peaceful pursuit of cultivating tulips.    Van Baerle was truly beloved by his servants and labourers; nor had  he any conception that there was in this world a man who wished ill to  another.    And yet it must be said, to the disgrace of mankind, that Cornelius  van Baerle, without being aware of the fact, had a much more ferocious,  fierce, and implacable enemy than the Grand Pensionary and his brother  had among the Orange party, who were most hostile to the devoted  brothers, who had never been sundered by the least misunderstanding  during their lives, and by their mutual devotion in the face of death  made sure the existence of their brotherly affection beyond the grave.    At the time when Cornelius van Baerle began to devote himself to  tulip-growing, expending on this hobby his yearly revenue and the  guilders of his father, there was at Dort, living next door to him, a  citizen of the name of Isaac Boxtel who from the age when he was able to  think for himself had indulged the same fancy, and who was in ecstasies  at the mere mention of the word \"tulban,\" which (as we are assured  by the \"Floriste Francaise,\" the most highly considered authority in  matters relating to this flower) is the first word in the Cingalese  tongue which was ever used to designate that masterpiece of floriculture  which is now called the tulip.    Boxtel had not the good fortune of being rich, like Van Baerle. He  had therefore, with great care and patience, and by dint of strenuous  exertions, laid out near his house at Dort a garden fit for the culture  of his cherished flower; he had mixed the soil according to the most  approved prescriptions, and given to his hotbeds just as much heat and  fresh air as the strictest rules of horticulture exact.    Isaac knew the temperature of his frames to the twentieth part of a  degree. He knew the strength of the current of air, and tempered it so  as to adapt it to the wave of the stems of his flowers. His productions  also began to meet with the favour of the public. They were beautiful,  nay, distinguished. Several fanciers had come to see Boxtel's tulips.  At last he had even started amongst all the Linnaeuses and Tourneforts a  tulip which bore his name, and which, after having travelled all through  France, had found its way into Spain, and penetrated as far as Portugal;  and the King, Don Alfonso VI.--who, being expelled from Lisbon, had  retired to the island of Terceira, where he amused himself, not,  like the great Conde, with watering his carnations, but with growing  tulips--had, on seeing the Boxtel tulip, exclaimed, \"Not so bad, by any  means!\"    All at once, Cornelius van Baerle, who, after all his learned pursuits,  had been seized with the tulipomania, made some changes in his house  at Dort, which, as we have stated, was next door to that of Boxtel. He  raised a certain building in his court-yard by a story, which shutting  out the sun, took half a degree of warmth from Boxtel's garden, and, on  the other hand, added half a degree of cold in winter; not to mention  that it cut the wind, and disturbed all the horticultural calculations  and arrangements of his neighbour.    After all, this mishap appeared to Boxtel of no great consequence. Van  Baerle was but a painter, a sort of fool who tried to reproduce and  disfigure on canvas the wonders of nature. The painter, he thought, had  raised his studio by a story to get better light, and thus far he had  only been in the right. Mynheer van Baerle was a painter, as Mynheer  Boxtel was a tulip-grower; he wanted somewhat more sun for his  paintings, and he took half a degree from his neighbour's tulips.    The law was for Van Baerle, and Boxtel had to abide by it.    Besides, Isaac had made the discovery that too much sun was injurious to  tulips, and that this flower grew quicker, and had a better colouring,  with the temperate warmth of morning, than with the powerful heat of the  midday sun. He therefore felt almost grateful to Cornelius van Baerle  for having given him a screen gratis.    Maybe this was not quite in accordance with the true state of things in  general, and of Isaac Boxtel's feelings in particular. It is certainly  astonishing what rich comfort great minds, in the midst of momentous  catastrophes, will derive from the consolations of philosophy.    But alas! What was the agony of the unfortunate Boxtel on seeing the  windows of the new story set out with bulbs and seedlings of tulips for  the border, and tulips in pots; in short, with everything pertaining to  the pursuits of a tulip-monomaniac!    There were bundles of labels, cupboards, and drawers with compartments,  and wire guards for the cupboards, to allow free access to the air  whilst keeping out slugs, mice, dormice, and rats, all of them very  curious fanciers of tulips at two thousand francs a bulb.    Boxtel was quite amazed when he saw all this apparatus, but he was not  as yet aware of the full extent of his misfortune. Van Baerle was known  to be fond of everything that pleases the eye. He studied Nature in all  her aspects for the benefit of his paintings, which were as minutely  finished as those of Gerard Dow, his master, and of Mieris, his  friend. Was it not possible, that, having to paint the interior of a  tulip-grower's, he had collected in his new studio all the accessories  of decoration?    Yet, although thus consoling himself with illusory suppositions, Boxtel  was not able to resist the burning curiosity which was devouring him.  In the evening, therefore, he placed a ladder against the partition  wall between their gardens, and, looking into that of his neighbour Van  Baerle, he convinced himself that the soil of a large square bed, which  had formerly been occupied by different plants, was removed, and the  ground disposed in beds of loam mixed with river mud (a combination  which is particularly favourable to the tulip), and the whole surrounded  by a border of turf to keep the soil in its place. Besides this,  sufficient shade to temper the noonday heat; aspect south-southwest;  water in abundant supply, and at hand; in short, every requirement to  insure not only success but also progress. There could not be a doubt  that Van Baerle had become a tulip-grower.    Boxtel at once pictured to himself this learned man, with a capital  of four hundred thousand and a yearly income of ten thousand guilders,  devoting all his intellectual and financial resources to the cultivation  of the tulip. He foresaw his neighbour's success, and he felt such a  pang at the mere idea of this success that his hands dropped powerless,  his knees trembled, and he fell in despair from the ladder.    And thus it was not for the sake of painted tulips, but for real ones,  that Van Baerle took from him half a degree of warmth. And thus Van  Baerle was to have the most admirably fitted aspect, and, besides, a  large, airy, and well ventilated chamber where to preserve his bulbs  and seedlings; while he, Boxtel, had been obliged to give up for this  purpose his bedroom, and, lest his sleeping in the same apartment might  injure his bulbs and seedlings, had taken up his abode in a miserable  garret.    Boxtel, then, was to have next door to him a rival and successful  competitor; and his rival, instead of being some unknown, obscure  gardener, was the godson of Mynheer Cornelius de Witt, that is to say, a  celebrity.    Boxtel, as the reader may see, was not possessed of the spirit of  Porus, who, on being conquered by Alexander, consoled himself with the  celebrity of his conqueror.    And now if Van Baerle produced a new tulip, and named it the John de  Witt, after having named one the Cornelius? It was indeed enough to  choke one with rage.    Thus Boxtel, with jealous foreboding, became the prophet of his own  misfortune. And, after having made this melancholy discovery, he passed  the most wretched night imaginable.          Chapter 6. The Hatred of a Tulip-fancier      From that moment Boxtel's interest in tulips was no longer a stimulus to  his exertions, but a deadening anxiety. Henceforth all his thoughts ran  only upon the injury which his neighbour would cause him, and thus his  favourite occupation was changed into a constant source of misery to  him.    Van Baerle, as may easily be imagined, had no sooner begun to apply his  natural ingenuity to his new fancy, than he succeeded in growing the  finest tulips. Indeed; he knew better than any one else at Haarlem or  Leyden--the two towns which boast the best soil and the most congenial  climate--how to vary the colours, to modify the shape, and to produce  new species.    He belonged to that natural, humorous school who took for their motto in  the seventeenth century the aphorism uttered by one of their number in  1653,--\"To despise flowers is to offend God.\"    From that premise the school of tulip-fanciers, the most exclusive of  all schools, worked out the following syllogism in the same year:--    \"To despise flowers is to offend God.    \"The more beautiful the flower is, the more does one offend God in  despising it.    \"The tulip is the most beautiful of all flowers.    \"Therefore, he who despises the tulip offends God beyond measure.\"    By reasoning of this kind, it can be seen that the four or five thousand  tulip-growers of Holland, France, and Portugal, leaving out those of  Ceylon and China and the Indies, might, if so disposed, put the whole  world under the ban, and condemn as schismatics and heretics and  deserving of death the several hundred millions of mankind whose hopes  of salvation were not centred upon the tulip.    We cannot doubt that in such a cause Boxtel,"]]]
