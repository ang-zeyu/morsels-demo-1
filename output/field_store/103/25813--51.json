What, Daniel, art thou dumb?\"  For much amazed was that good man.--\"Indeed!\"  Said he with gladd'ning eye, \"will money breed?  How have I lived ? I grieve, with all my heart,  For my late knowledge in this precious art:  -  Five pounds for every hundred will he give?  And then the hundred?--I begin to live.\" -  So he began, and other means he found,  As he went on, to multiply a pound:  Though blind so long to Interest, all allow  That no man better understands it now:  Him in our Body-Corporate we chose,  And once among us, he above us rose;  Stepping from post to post, he reach'd the Chair,  And there he now reposes--that's the Mayor.     But 'tis not he, 'tis not the kinder few,  The mild, the good, who can our peace renew;  A peevish humour swells in every eye,  The warm are angry, and the cool are shy;  There is no more the social board at whist,  The good old partners are with scorn dismiss'd;  No more with dog and lantern comes the maid,  To guide the mistress when the rubber's play'd;  Sad shifts are made lest ribands blue and green  Should at one table, at one time, be seen:  On care and merit none will now rely,  'Tis Party sells what party-friends must buy;  The warmest burgess wears a bodger's coat,  And fashion gains less int'rest than a vote;  Uncheck'd the vintner still his poison vends,  For he too votes, and can command his friends.     But this admitted; be it still agreed,  These ill effects from noble cause proceed;  Though like some vile excrescences they be,  The tree they spring from is a sacred tree,  And its true produce, Strength and Liberty.     Yet if we could th' attendant ills suppress,  If we could make the sum of mischief less;  If we could warm and angry men persuade  No more man's common comforts to invade;  And that old ease and harmony re-seat,  In all our meetings, so in joy to meet;  Much would of glory to the Muse ensue,  And our good Vicar would have less to do.

PROFESSIONS--LAW.    \"TRADES and Professions\"--these are themes the Muse,  Left to her freedom, would forbear to choose;  But to our Borough they in truth belong,  And we, perforce, must take them in our song.     Be it then known that we can boast of these  In all denominations, ranks, degrees;  All who our numerous wants through life supply,  Who soothe us sick, attend us when we die,  Or for the dead their various talents try.  Then have we those who live by secret arts,  By hunting fortunes, and by stealing hearts;  Or who by nobler means themselves advance,  Or who subsist by charity and chance.     Say, of our native heroes shall I boast,  Born in our streets, to thunder on our coast,  Our Borough-seamen? Could the timid Muse  More patriot ardour in their breasts infuse;  Or could she paint their merit or their skill,  She wants not love, alacrity, or will:  But needless all; that ardour is their own,  And for their deeds, themselves have made them known.     Soldiers in arms! Defenders of our soil!  Who from destruction save us; who from spoil  Protect the sons of peace, who traffic, or who toil;  Would I could duly praise you; that each deed  Your foes might honour, and your friends might read:  This too is needless; you've imprinted well  Your powers, and told what I should feebly tell:  Beside, a Muse like mine, to satire prone,  Would fail in themes where there is praise alone.  - Law shall I sing, or what to Law belongs?  Alas! there may be danger in such songs;  A foolish rhyme, 'tis said, a trifling thing,  The law found treason, for it touch'd the King.  But kings have mercy, in these happy times.  Or surely One had suffered for his rhymes;  Our glorious Edwards and our Henrys bold,  So touch'd, had kept the reprobate in hold;  But he escap'd,--nor fear, thank Heav'n, have I,  Who love my king, for such offence to die.  But I am taught the danger would be much,  If these poor lines should one attorney touch -  (One of those Limbs of Law who're always here;  The Heads come down to guide them twice a year.)  I might not swing, indeed, but he in sport  Would whip a rhymer on from court to court;  Stop him in each, and make him pay for all  The long proceedings in that dreaded Hall:  -  Then let my numbers flow discreetly on,  Warn'd by the fate of luckless Coddrington, {3}  Lest some attorney (pardon me the name)  Should wound a poor solicitor for fame.     One Man of Law in George the Second's reign  Was all our frugal fathers would maintain;  He too was kept for forms; a man of peace,  To frame a contract, or to draw a lease:  He had a clerk, with whom he used to write  All the day long, with whom he drank at night,  Spare was his visage, moderate his bill,  And he so kind, men doubted of his skill.     Who thinks of this, with some amazement sees,  For one so poor, three flourishing at ease;  Nay, one in splendour! see that mansion tall,  That lofty door, the far-resounding hall;  Well-furnish'd rooms, plate shining on the board,  Gay liveried lads, and cellar proudly stored:  Then say how comes it that such fortunes crown  These sons of strife, these terrors of the town?     Lo! that small Office! there th' incautious guest  Goes blindfold in, and that maintains the rest;  There in his web, th' observant spider lies,  And peers about for fat intruding flies;  Doubtful at first, he hears the distant hum,  And feels them fluttering as they nearer come;  They buzz and blink, and doubtfully they tread  On the strong bird-lime of the utmost thread;  But when they're once entangled by the gin,  With what an eager clasp he draws them in;  Nor shall they 'scape, till after long delay,  And all that sweetens life is drawn away.     \"Nay, this,\" you cry, \"is common-place, the tale  Of petty tradesmen o'er their evening ale;  There are who, living by the legal pen,  Are held in honour,--'Honourable men'\"     Doubtless--there are who hold manorial courts,  Or whom the trust of powerful friends supports,  Or who, by labouring through a length of time,  Have pick'd their way, unsullied by a crime.  These are the few:  in this, in every place,  Fix the litigious rupture-stirring race;  Who to contention as to trade are led,  To whom dispute and strife are bliss and bread.     There is a doubtful Pauper, and we think  'Tis not with us to give him meat and drink;  There is a Child; and 'tis not mighty clear  Whether the mother lived with us a year:  A Road's indicted, and our seniors doubt  If in our proper boundary or without:  But what says our attorney?  He, our friend,  Tells us 'tis just and manly to contend.     \"What! to a neighbouring parish yield your cause,  While you have money, and the nation laws?  What! lose without a trial, that which, tried,  May--nay it must--be given on our side?  All men of spirit would contend; such men  Than lose a pound would rather hazard ten.  What! be imposed on?  No! a British soul  Despises imposition, hates control:  The law is open; let them, if they dare,  Support their cause; the Borough need not spare.  All I advise is vigour and good-will:  Is it agreed then--Shall I file a bill?\"  The trader, grazier, merchant, priest, and all,  Whose sons aspiring, to professions call,  Choose from their lads some bold and subtle boy,  And judge him fitted for this grave employ:  Him a keen old practitioner admits,  To write five years and exercise his wits:  The youth has heard--it is in fact his creed -  Mankind dispute, that Lawyers may be fee'd:  Jails, bailiffs, writs, all terms and threats of Law,  Grow now familiar as once top and taw;  Rage, hatred, fear, the mind's severer ills,  All bring employment, all augment his bills:  As feels the surgeon for the mangled limb,  The mangled mind is but a job for him;  Thus taught to think, these legal reasoners draw  Morals and maxims from their views of Law;  They cease to judge by precepts taught in schools,  By man's plain sense, or by religious rules;  No! nor by law itself, in truth discern'd,  But as its statutes may be warp'd and turn'd:  How they should judge of man, his word and deed,  They in their books and not their bosoms read:  Of some good act you speak with just applause;  \"No, no!\" says he, \"'twould be a losing cause:  Blame you some tyrant's deed?--he answers \"Nay,  He'll get a verdict; heed you what you say.\"  Thus to conclusions from examples led,  The heart resigns all judgment to the head;  Law, law alone for ever kept in view,  His measures guides, and rules his conscience too;  Of ten commandments, he confesses three  Are yet in force, and tells you which they be,  As Law instructs him, thus:  \"Your neighbour's wife  You"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5225"],[0,"The Satyricon — Complete (#9)"],[1,"were laid out in all their richness.  We took our  places, as requested, and began with a wonderful first course.  We were  all but submerged in Falernian wine.  When several other courses had  followed, and we were endeavoring to keep awake Quartilla exclaimed, \"How  dare you think of going to sleep when you know that the vigil of Priapus  is to be kept?\"          CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SECOND.    Worn out by all his troubles, Ascyltos commenced to nod, and the maid,  whom he had slighted, and of course insulted, smeared lampblack all over  his face, and painted his lips and shoulders with vermillion, while he  drowsed.  Completely exhausted by so many untoward adventures, I, too,  was enjoying the shortest of naps, the whole household, within and  without, was doing the same, some were lying here and there asleep at our  feet, others leaned against the walls, and some even slept head to head  upon the threshold itself; the lamps, failing because of a lack of oil,  shed a feeble and flickering light, when two Syrians, bent upon stealing  an amphora of wine, entered the dining-room.  While they were greedily  pawing among the silver, they pulled the amphora in two, upsetting the  table with all the silver plate, and a cup, which had flown pretty high,  cut the head of the maid, who was drowsing upon a couch.  She screamed at  that, thereby betraying the thieves and wakening some of the drunkards.  The Syrians, who had come for plunder, seeing that they were about to be  detected, were so quick to throw themselves down besides a couch and  commence to snore as if they had been asleep for a long time, that you  would have thought they belonged there.  The butler had gotten up and  poured oil in the flickering lamps by this time, and the boys, having  rubbed their eyes open, had returned to their duty, when in came a female  cymbal player and the crashing brass awoke everybody.          CHAPTER THE TWENTY-THIRD.    The banquet began all over again, and Quartilla challenged us to a  drinking-bout, the crash of the cymbals lending ardor to her revel.  A catamite appeared, the stalest of all mankind, well worthy of that  house.  Heaving a sigh, he wrung his hands until the joints cracked,  and spouted out the following verses,        \"Hither, hither quickly gather, pathic companions boon;       Artfully stretch forth your limbs and on with the dance and play!       Twinkling feet and supple thighs and agile buttocks in tune,       Hands well skilled in raising passions, Delian eunuchs gay!\"    When he had finished his poetry, he slobbered a most evil-smelling kiss  upon me, and then, climbing upon my couch, he proceeded with all his  might and main to pull all of my clothing off.  I resisted to the limit  of my strength.  He manipulated my member for a long time, but all in  vain.  Gummy streams poured down his sweating forehead, and there was so  much chalk in the wrinkles of his cheeks that you might have mistaken his  face for a roofless wall, from which the plaster was crumbling in a rain.          CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FOURTH.    Driven to the last extremity, I could no longer keep back the tears.  \"Madame,\" I burst out, \"is this the night-cap which you ordered served to  me?\"  Clapping her hands softly she cried out, \"Oh you witty rogue, you  are a fountain of repartee, but you never knew before that a catamite was  called a k-night-cap, now did you?\" Then, fearing my companion would come  off better than I, \"Madame,\" I said, \"I leave it to your sense of  fairness: is Ascyltos to be the only one in this dining-room who keeps  holiday?\"  \"Fair enough,\" conceded Quartilla, \"let Ascyltos have his  k-night-cap too!\"  On hearing that, the catamite changed mounts, and,  having bestridden my comrade, nearly drove him to distraction with his  buttocks and his kisses.  Giton was standing between us and splitting his  sides with laughter when Quartilla noticed him, and actuated by the  liveliest curiosity, she asked whose boy he was, and upon my answering  that he was my \"brother,\"  \"Why has he not kissed me then?\"  she  demanded.  Calling him to her, she pressed a kiss upon his mouth, then  putting her hand beneath his robe, she took hold of his little member, as  yet so undeveloped.  \"This,\" she remarked, \"shall serve me very well  tomorrow, as a whet to my appetite, but today I'll take no common fare  after choice fish!\"          CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIFTH.    She was still talking when Psyche, who was giggling, came to her side and  whispered something in her ear.  What it was, I did not catch.  \"By all  means,\" ejaculated Quartilla, \"a brilliant idea!  Why shouldn't our  pretty little Pannychis lose her maidenhead when the opportunity is so  favorable?\"  A little girl, pretty enough, too, was led in at once; she  looked to be not over seven years of age, and she was the same one who  had before accompanied Quartilla to our room.  Amidst universal applause,  and in response to the demands of all, they made ready to perform the  nuptial rites.  I was completely out of countenance, and insisted that  such a modest boy as Giton was entirely unfitted for such a wanton part,  and moreover, that the child was not of an age at which she could receive  that which a woman must take.  \"Is that so,\" Quartilla scoffed, \"is she  any younger than I was, when I submitted to my first man?  Juno, my  patroness, curse me if I can remember the time when I ever was a virgin,  for I diverted myself with others of my own age, as a child then as the  years passed, I played with bigger boys, until at last I reached my  present age.  I suppose that this explains the origin of the proverb,  'Who carried the calf may carry the bull,' as they say.\"  As I feared  that Giton might run greater risk if I were absent, I got up to take  part in the ceremony.          CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SIXTH.    Psyche had already enveloped the child's head in the bridal-veil, the  catamite, holding a torch, led the long procession of drunken women which  followed; they were clapping their hands, having previously decked out  the bridal-bed with a suggestive drapery.  Quartilla, spurred on by the  wantonness of the others, seized hold of Giton and drew him into the  bridal-chamber.  There was no doubt of the boy's perfect willingness to  go, nor was the girl at all alarmed at the name of marriage.  When they  were finally in bed, and the door shut, we seated ourselves outside the  door of the bridal-chamber, and Quartilla applied a curious eye to a  chink, purposely made, watching their childish dalliance with lascivious  attention.  She then drew me gently over to her side that I might share  the spectacle with her, and when we both attempted to peep our faces were  pressed against each other; whenever she was not engrossed in the  performance, she screwed up her lips to meet mine, and pecked at me  continually with furtive kisses.  [A thunderous hammering was heard at  the door, while all this was going on, and everyone wondered what this  unexpected interruption could mean, when we saw a soldier, one of the  night-watch, enter with a drawn sword in his hand, and surrounded by a  crowd of young rowdies.  He glared about him with savage eyes and  blustering mien, and, catching sight of Quartilla, presently, \"What's up  now, you shameless woman,\" he bawled; \"what do you mean by making game of  me with lying promises, and cheating me out of the night you promised me?  But you won't get off unpunished! You and that lover of yours are going to  find out that I'm a man!\"  At the soldier's orders, his companion bound  Quartilla and myself together, mouth to mouth, breast to breast, and  thigh to thigh; and not without a great deal of laughter.  Then the  catamite, also at the soldier's order, began to beslaver me all over with  the fetid kisses of his stinking mouth, a treatment I could neither fly  from, nor in any other way avoid.  Finally, he ravished me, and worked  his entire pleasure upon me.  In the meantime, the satyrion which I had  drunk only a little while before spurred every nerve to lust and I began  to gore Quartilla impetuously, and she, burning with the same passion,  reciprocated in the game.  The rowdies laughed themselves sick, so moved  were they by that ludicrous scene, for here was I, mounted by the stalest  of catamites, involuntarily and almost unconsciously responding with as  rapid a cadence to him as Quartilla did in her wriggling under me.  While  this was going on, Pannychis, unaccustomed at her tender years to the  pastime of Venus, raised an outcry and attracted the attention of the  soldier, by this unexpected howl of consternation, for this slip of a  girl was being ravished, and Giton the victor, had won a not bloodless  victory.  Aroused by what he saw, the soldier rushed upon them, seizing  Pannychis, then Giton, then both of them together, in a crushing embrace.  The virgin burst into tears and plead with him to remember her age, but  her prayers availed her nothing, the soldier only being fired the more by  her childish charms.  Pannychis covered her head at last, resolved to  endure whatever the Fates had in store for her.  At this instant, an old  woman, the very same who had tricked me on that day when I was hunting  for our lodging, came to the aid of Pannychis, as though she had dropped  from the clouds.  With loud cries, she rushed into the house, swearing  that a gang of footpads was prowling about the neighborhood and the  people invoked the help of \"All honest men,\" in vain, for the members of  the night-watch were either asleep or intent upon some carouse, as they  were nowhere to be found.  Greatly terrified at this, the soldier rushed  headlong from Quartilla's house.  His companions followed after him,  freeing Pannychis from impending danger and relieving the rest of us from  our fear.]  (I was so weary of Quartilla's lechery that I began to  meditate means of escape.  I made my intentions known to Ascyltos, who,  as"]]]
