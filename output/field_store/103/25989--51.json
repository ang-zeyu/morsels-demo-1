Even now coal cannot compete with gas in the manufacture of window  glass, for, the gas being free from sulphur and other impurities  contained in coal, produces a superior quality of glass; so that in this  branch of industry the question of superiority seems already settled.    Having said thus much of an industry now in its infancy but promising  great growth, I submit tables of analyses of common and of the natural  or marsh gas, the latter from a paper recently prepared by a committee  of the Engineers' Society of Western Pennsylvania, and for the use of  which I am indebted to that association:    COMMON GAS.      Hydrogen                                 46.0    Light carbureted hydrogen (marsh gas)    39.5    Condensible hydrocarbon                   3.8    Carbonic oxide                            7.5       \"     acid                             0.6    Aqueous vapor                             2.0    Oxygen                                    0.1    Nitrogen                                  0.5                                            -----                                            100.0    Natural gas is now conveyed to Pittsburg through four lines of 5-5/8  inch pipe and one line of eight inch pipe. A line of ten inch pipe is  also being laid. The pressure of the gas at the wells is from 150 to 230  pounds to the square inch. As the wells are on one side eighteen and on  the other about twenty-five miles distant, and as the consumption is  variable, the pressure at the city cannot be given. Greater pressure  might be obtained at the wells, but this would increase the liability  to leakage and bursting of pipes. For the prevention of such casualties  safety valves are provided at the wells, permitting the escape of all  superfluous gas. The enormous force of this gas may be appreciated from  a comparison of, say, 200 pounds pressure at the wells with a two ounce  pressure of common gas for ordinary lighting. The amount of natural gas  now furnished for use in Pittsburg is supposed to be something like  25,000,000 cubic feet per day; the ten inch pipe now laying is estimated  to increase the supply to 40,000,000 feet. The amount of manufactured  gas used for lighting the same city probably falls below 3,000,000 feet.    About fifty mills and factories of various kinds in Pittsburg now use  natural gas. It is used for domestic purposes in two hundred houses.  Its superiority over coal in the manufacture of window glass is  unquestioned. That it is not used in all the glass houses of Pittsburg  is due to the fact that its advantages were not fully known when the  furnaces were fired last summer, and it costs a large sum to permit the  furnaces to cool off after being heated for melting. When the fires cool  down, and before they are started up again, the furnaces now using  coal will doubtless all be changed so as to admit natural gas. The  superiority of French over American glass is said to be due to the fact  that the French use wood and the Americans coal in their furnaces, wood  being free from sulphur, phosphorus, etc. The substitution of gas for  coal, while not increasing the cost, improves the quality of American  glass, making it as nearly perfect as possible.    While the gas is not used as yet in any smelting furnace nor in the  Bessemer converters, it is preferred in open hearth and crucible steel  furnaces, and is said to be vastly superior to coal for puddling. The  charge of a puddling furnace, consisting of 500 pounds of pig-metal and  eighty pounds of \"fix,\" produces with coal fuel 490 to 500 pounds of  iron. With gas for fuel, it is claimed that the same charge will yield  520 to 530 pounds of iron. In an iron mill of thirty furnaces, running  eight heats each for twenty-four hours, this would make a difference in  favor of the gas of, say, 8 x 30 x 25 = 6,000 pounds of iron per day.  This is an important item of itself, leaving out the cost of firing with  coal and hauling ashes.    For generating steam in large establishments, one man will attend  a battery of twelve or twenty boilers, using gas as fuel, keep the  pressure uniform, and have the fire room clean as a parlor. For burning  brick and earthenware, gas offers the double advantage of freedom from  smoke and a uniform heat. The use of gas in public bakeries promises the  abolition of the ash-box and its accumulation of miscellaneous filth,  which is said to often impregnate the \"sponge\" with impurities.    In short, the advantages of natural gas as a fuel are so obvious to  those who have given it a trial, that the prediction is made that,  should the supply fail, many who are now using it will never return to  the consumption of crude coal in factories, but, if necessary, convert  it or petroleum into gas at their own works.    It seems, indeed, that until we shall have acquired the wisdom enabling  us to conserve and concentrate the heat of the sun, gas must be the fuel  of the future.--_Popular Science Monthly_.

Yet before I proceed to my legitimate subject some few final remarks  will no doubt be expected by my Readers upon these pillars and  mainstays of the Constitution of Flatland, the controllers of our  conduct and shapers of our destiny, the objects of universal homage and  almost of adoration:  need I say that I mean our Circles or Priests?    When I call them Priests, let me not be understood as meaning no more  than the term denotes with you.  With us, our Priests are  Administrators of all Business, Art, and Science; Directors of Trade,  Commerce, Generalship, Architecture, Engineering, Education,  Statesmanship, Legislature, Morality, Theology; doing nothing  themselves, they are the Causes of everything worth doing, that is done  by others.    Although popularly everyone called a Circle is deemed a Circle, yet  among the better educated Classes it is known that no Circle is really  a Circle, but only a Polygon with a very large number of very small  sides.  As the number of the sides increases, a Polygon approximates to  a Circle; and, when the number is very great indeed, say for example  three or four hundred, it is extremely difficult for the most delicate  touch to feel any polygonal angles.  Let me say rather it WOULD be  difficult:  for, as I have shown above, Recognition by Feeling is  unknown among the highest society, and to FEEL a Circle would be  considered a most audacious insult.  This habit of abstention from  Feeling in the best society enables a Circle the more easily to sustain  the veil of mystery in which, from his earliest years, he is wont to  enwrap the exact nature of his Perimeter or Circumference.  Three feet  being the average Perimeter it follows that, in a Polygon of three  hundred sides each side will be no more than the hundredth part of a  foot in length, or little more than the tenth part of an inch; and in a  Polygon of six or seven hundred sides the sides are little larger than  the diameter of a Spaceland pin-head.  It is always assumed, by  courtesy, that the Chief Circle for the time being has ten thousand  sides.    The ascent of the posterity of the Circles in the social scale is not  restricted, as it is among the lower Regular classes, by the Law of  Nature which limits the increase of sides to one in each generation.  If it were so, the number of sides in the Circle would be a mere  question of pedigree and arithmetic, and the four hundred and  ninety-seventh descendant of an Equilateral Triangle would necessarily  be a polygon with five hundred sides.  But this is not the case.  Nature's Law prescribes two antagonistic decrees affecting Circular  propagation; first, that as the race climbs higher in the scale of  development, so development shall proceed at an accelerated pace;  second, that in the same proportion, the race shall become less  fertile.  Consequently in the home of a Polygon of four or five hundred  sides it is rare to find a son; more than one is never seen.  On the  other hand the son of a five-hundred-sided Polygon has been known to  possess five hundred and fifty, or even six hundred sides.    Art also steps in to help the process of higher Evolution.  Our  physicians have discovered that the small and tender sides of an infant  Polygon of the higher class can be fractured, and his whole frame  re-set, with such exactness that a Polygon of two or three hundred  sides sometimes--by no means always, for the process is attended with  serious risk--but sometimes overleaps two or three hundred generations,  and as it were double at a stroke, the number of his progenitors and  the nobility of his descent.    Many a promising child is sacrificed in this way.  Scarcely one out of  ten survives.  Yet so strong is the parental ambition among those  Polygons who are, as it were, on the fringe of the Circular class, that  it is very rare to find the Nobleman of that position in society, who  has neglected to place his first-born in the Circular Neo-Therapeutic  Gymnasium before he has attained the age of a month.    One year determines success or failure.  At the end of that time the  child has, in all probability, added one more to the tombstones that  crowd the Neo-Therapeutic Cemetery; but on rare occasional a glad  procession bears back the little one to his exultant parents, no longer  a Polygon, but a Circle, at least by courtesy:  and a single instance  of so blessed a result induces multitudes of Polygonal parents to  submit to similar domestic sacrifice, which have a dissimilar issue.          SECTION 12  Of the Doctrine of our Priests      As to the doctrine of the Circles it may briefly be summed up in a  single maxim, \"Attend to your Configuration.\"  Whether political,  ecclesiastical, or moral, all their teaching has for its object the  improvement of individual and collective Configuration--with special  reference of course to the Configuration of the Circles, to which all  other objects are subordinated.    It is the merit of the Circles that they have effectually suppressed  those ancient heresies which led men to waste energy and sympathy in  the vain belief that conduct depends upon will, effort, training,  encouragement, praise, or anything else but Configuration.  It was  Pantocyclus--the illustrious Circle mentioned above, as the queller of  the Colour Revolt--who first convinced mankind that Configuration makes  the man; that if, for example, you are born an Isosceles with two  uneven sides, you will assuredly go wrong unless you have them made  even--for which purpose you must go to the Isosceles Hospital;  similarly, if you are a Triangle, or Square, or even a Polygon, born  with any Irregularity, you must be taken to one of the Regular  Hospitals to have your disease cured; otherwise you will end your days  in the State Prison or by the angle of the State Executioner.    All faults or defects, from the slightest misconduct to the most  flagitious crime, Pantocyclus attributed to some deviation from perfect  Regularity in the bodily figure, caused perhaps (if not congenital) by  some collision in a crowd; by neglect to take exercise, or by taking  too much of it; or even by a sudden change of temperature, resulting in  a shrinkage or expansion in some too susceptible part of the frame.  Therefore, concluded that illustrious Philosopher, neither good conduct  nor bad conduct is a fit subject, in any sober estimation, for either  praise or blame.  For why should you praise, for example, the integrity  of a Square who faithfully defends the interests of his client, when  you ought in reality rather to admire the exact precision of his right  angles?  Or again, why blame a lying, thievish Isosceles, when you  ought rather to deplore the incurable inequality of his sides?    Theoretically, this doctrine is unquestionable; but it has practical  drawbacks.  In dealing with an Isosceles, if a rascal pleads that he  cannot help stealing because of his unevenness, you reply that for that  very reason, because he cannot help being a nuisance to his neighbours,  you, the Magistrate, cannot help sentencing him to be consumed--and  there's an end of the matter.  But in little domestic difficulties,  when the penalty of consumption, or death, is out of the question, this  theory of Configuration sometimes comes in awkwardly; and I must  confess that occasionally when one of my own Hexagonal Grandsons pleads  as an excuse for his disobedience that a sudden change of temperature  has been too much for his Perimeter, and that I ought to lay the blame  not on him but on his Configuration, which can only be strengthened by  abundance of the choicest sweetmeats, I neither see my way logically to  reject, nor practically to accept, his conclusions.    For my own part, I find it best to assume that a good sound scolding or  castigation has some latent and strengthening influence on my  Grandson's Configuration; though I own that I have no grounds for  thinking so.  At all events I am not alone in my way of extricating  myself from this dilemma; for I find that many of the highest Circles,  sitting as Judges in law courts, use praise and blame towards Regular  and Irregular Figures; and in their homes I know by experience that,  when scolding their children, they speak about \"right\" and \"wrong\" as  vehemently and passionately as if they believe that these names  represented real existence, and that a human Figure is really capable  of choosing between them.    Constantly carrying out their policy of making Configuration the  leading idea in every mind, the Circles reverse the nature of that  Commandment which in Spaceland regulates the relations between parents  and children.  With you, children are taught to honour their parents;  with us--next to the Circles, who are the chief object of universal  homage--a man is taught to honour his Grandson, if he has one; or, if  not, his Son.  By \"honour,\" however, is by no means mean \"indulgence,\"  but a reverent regard for their highest interests:  and the Circles  teach that the duty of fathers is to subordinate their own interests to  those of posterity, thereby advancing the"]]]
