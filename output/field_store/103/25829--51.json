The slave was pronounced guilty of two capital offences: first,  of the murder of the sacred animals, and secondly, of a twelve-fold  pollution of the Nile through dead bodies. I was condemned as originator  of this, (as they termed it) four-and-twenty-fold crime.       [According to the Egyptian law, the man who was cognizant of a crime     was held equally culpable with the perpetrator.]    \"Mus was executed on the same day. May the earth rest lightly on him!  I shall never think of him again as my slave, but as a friend and  benefactor! My sentence of death was read aloud in the presence of  his dead body, and I was already preparing for a long journey into the  nether world, when the king sent and commanded a reprieve.       [This court of justice, which may be compared with the Areopagus at     Athens, and the Gerusia at Sparta, (Diod. I, 75.), was composed of     30 judges taken from the priestly caste, (10 from Heliopolis, 10     from Memphis, 10 from Thebes). The most eminent from among their     number was chosen by them as president. All complaints and defences     had to be presented in writing, that the judges might in no way be     influenced by word or gesture. This tribunal was independent, even     of the king's authority. Much information concerning the     administration of justice has been obtained from the Papyrus Abbott,     known by the name of the 'Papyrus judiciaire'. Particulars and an     account of their literature may be found in Ebers \"Durch Gosen zum     Sinai,\" p. 534 and following.]    \"I was taken back to prison. One of my guards, an Arcadian Taxiarch,  told me that all the officers of the guard and many of the soldiers,  (altogether four thousand men) had threatened to send in their  resignation, unless I, their commander, were pardoned.    \"As it was beginning to grow dusk I was taken to the king.    \"He received me graciously, confirmed the Taxiarch's statement with  his own mouth, and said how grieved he should be to lose a commander so  generally beloved. I must confess that I owe Amasis no grudge for his  conduct to me, on the contrary I pity him. You should have heard how he,  the powerful king, complained that he could never act according to his  own wishes, that even in his most private affairs he was crossed and  compromised by the priests and their influence.       [See the parallel in the history of 2000 years later in the reigns     of Henry III. and IV. confronting the Jesuit influence, finally     culminating in assassination. D.W.]    \"Had it only depended on himself, he could easily have pardoned the  transgression of a law, which I, as a foreigner, could not be expected  to understand, and might (though unjustly) esteem as a foolish  superstition. But for the sake of the priests he dare not leave me  unpunished. The lightest penalty he could inflict must be banishment  from Egypt.    \"He concluded his complaint with these words: 'You little know what  concessions I must make to the priests in order to obtain your pardon.  Why, our supreme court of justice is independent even of me, its king!'    \"And thus I received my dismissal, after having taken a solemn oath to  leave Memphis that very day, and Egypt, at latest, in three weeks.    \"At the palace-gate I met Psamtik, the crown-prince. He has long been my  enemy, on account of some vexatious matters which I cannot divulge, (you  know them, Rhodopis). I was going to offer him my parting salutation,  but he turned his back upon me, saying: Once more you have escaped  punishment, Athenian; but you cannot elude my vengeance. Whithersoever  you may go, I shall be able to find you!'--'That remains to be proved,'  I answered, and putting myself and my possessions on board a boat, came  to Naukratis. Here, by good fortune, I met my old friend Aristomachus of  Sparta, who, as he was formerly in command of the Cyprian troops, will  most likely be nominated my successor. I should rejoice to know that  such a first-rate man was going to take my place, if I did not at the  same time fear that his eminent services will make my own poor efforts  seem even more insignificant than they really were.\"    But here he was interrupted by Aristomachus, who called out: \"Praise  enough, friend Phanes! Spartan tongues are stiff; but if you should  ever stand in need of my help, I will give you an answer in deeds, which  shall strike the right nail on the head.\"    Rhodopis smiled her approval, and giving her hand to each, said:  \"Unfortunately, the only conclusion to be drawn from your story, my poor  Phanes, is that you cannot possibly remain any longer in this country. I  will not blame you for your thoughtlessness, though you might have known  that you were exposing yourself to great danger for a mere trifle.  The really wise and brave man never undertakes a hazardous enterprise,  unless the possible advantage and disadvantage that may accrue to him  from it can be reckoned at least as equal. Recklessness is quite as  foolish, but not so blamable as cowardice, for though both do the man an  injury, the latter alone can dishonor him.    \"Your thoughtlessness, this time, has very nearly cost your life, a life  dear to many, and which you ought to save for a nobler end. We cannot  attempt to keep you here; we should thereby only injure ourselves  without benefitting you. This noble Spartan must now take your place as  head and representative of the Greek nation at the Egyptian court, must  endeavor to protect us against the encroachment of the priests, and to  retain for us the royal favor. I take your hand, Aristomachus, and  will not let it go till you have promised that you will protect, to the  utmost of your power, every Greek, however humble, (as Phanes did before  you), from the insolence of the Egyptians, and will sooner resign your  office than allow the smallest wrong done to a Hellene to go unpunished.  We are but a few thousands among millions of enemies, but through  courage we are great, and unity must keep us strong. Hitherto the Greeks  in Egypt have lived like brothers; each has been ready to offer himself  for the good of all, and all for each, and it is just this unity that  has made us, and must keep us, powerful.    \"Oh! could we but bestow this precious gift on our mother-country and  her colonies! would the tribes of our native land but forget their  Dorian, Ionian or AEolian descent, and, contenting themselves with the  one name of Hellenes, live as the children of one family, as the sheep  of one flock,--then indeed we should be strong against the whole world,  and Hellas would be recognized by all nations as the Queen of the  Earth!\"       [This longing desire for unity was by no means foreign to the     Greeks, though we seldom hear it expressed. Aristotle, for example,     says VII. 7.: \"Were the Hellenes united into one state, they could     command all the barbarous nations.\"]    A fire glowed in the eyes of the grey-haired woman as she uttered these  words; and the Spartan, grasping her hand impetuously and stamping on  the floor with his wooden leg, cried: \"By Zeus, I will not let a hair  of their heads be hurt; but thou, Rhodopis, thou art worthy to have been  born a Spartan woman.\"    \"Or an Athenian,\" cried Phanes.    \"An Ionian,\" said the Milesians, and the sculptor: \"A daughter of the  Samian Geomori--\"    \"But I am more, far more, than all these,\" cried the enthusiastic woman.  \"I am a Hellene!\"    The whole company, even to the Jew and the Syrian, were carried away by  the intense feeling of the moment; the Sybarite alone remained  unmoved, and, with his mouth so full as to render the words almost  unintelligible, said:    \"You deserve to be a Sybarite too, Rhodopis, for your roast beef is the  best I have tasted since I left Italy, and your Anthylla wine' relishes  almost as well as Vesuvian or Chian!\"    Every one laughed, except the Spartan, who darted a look of indignation  and contempt at the epicure.    In this moment a deep voice, hitherto unknown to us, shouted suddenly  through the window, \"A glad greeting to you, my friends!\"    \"A glad greeting,\" echoed the chorus of revellers, questioning and  guessing who this late arrival might prove to be.    They had not long to wait, for even before the Sybarite had had time  carefully to test and swallow another mouthful of wine, the speaker,  Kallias, the son of Phaenippus of Athens, was already standing by the  side of Rhodopis. He was a tall thin man of over sixty, with a head of  that oval form which gives the impression of refinement and intellect.  One of the richest among the Athenian exiles, he had twice bought the  possessions of Pisistratus from the state, and twice been obliged to  surrender them, on the tyrant's return to power. Looking round with his  clear keen eyes on this circle of acquaintances, he exchanged friendly  greetings with all, and exclaimed:    \"If you do not set a high value on my appearance among you this evening,  I shall think that gratitude has entirely disappeared from the earth.\"    \"We have been expecting you a long time,\" interrupted one of the  Milesians. \"You are the first man to bring us news of the Olympic  games!\"    \"And we could wish no better bearer of such news than the victor  of former days?\" added Rhodopis. \"Take your seat,\" cried Phanes  impatiently, \"and come to the point with your news at once, friend  Kallias.\"    \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5529"],[0,"The Bride of the Nile â€” Complete (#9)"],[1,"vitality, and  the languid old man on the couch, to whom even the small exertion of  moving the men was an effort. The Mukaukas might once have been like his  son, but in some long past time. Thin grey locks now only covered one  half of his bald head, and of his eyes, which, thirty years since, had  sparkled perhaps as keenly as Orion's, there was usually nothing, or  very little to be seen; for the heavy lids always drooped over them as  though they had lost the power to open, and this gave his handsome but  deathly-pale face a somewhat owl-like look. It was not morose, however;  on the contrary the mingled lines of suffering and of benevolent  kindliness resulted in an expression only of melancholy. The mouth  and flabby cheeks were as motionless as though they were dead. Grief,  anxiety and alarms seemed to have passed over them with a paralysing  hand and had left their trace there. He looked like a man weary unto  death, and still living only because fate had denied him the grace to  die. Indeed, he had often been taken for dead by his family when he had  dipped too freely into a certain little blood-stone box to take too many  of the white opium-pills, one of which he placed between his colorless  lips at long intervals, even during his game of draughts.    He lifted each piece slowly, like a sleeper with his eyes half shut; and  yet his opponent could not hold her own against his wary tactics and was  defeated by him now for the third time, though her uncle himself called  her a good player. It was easy to read in her high, smooth brow and  dark-blue eyes with their direct gaze, that she could think clearly  and decisively, and also feel deeply. But she seemed wilful too, and  contradictory--at any rate to-day; for when Orion pointed out some move  to her she rarely took his advice, but with set lips, pushed the piece  according to her own, rarely wiser, judgment. It was quite plain that  she was refractory under the guidance of this--especially of this  counsellor.    The bystanders could not fail to see the girl's repellent manner and  Orion's eager attempts to propitiate her; and for this reason Neforis  was glad when, just as her husband had finished the third game, and  had pushed the men together on the board with the back of his hand,  his chamberlain reminded him that the Arab was without, awaiting his  pleasure with growing impatience. The Mukaukas answered only by a sign,  drew his long caftan of the finest wool closer around him, and pointed  to the doors and the open roof. The rest of the party had long felt the  chill of the damp night air that blew through the room from the river,  but knowing that the father suffered more from heat than from anything,  they had all willingly endured the draught. Now, however, Orion called  the slaves, and before the strangers were admitted the doors were closed  and the roof covered.    Paula rose; the governor lay motionless and kept his eyes apparently  closed; he must, however, have seen what was going forward through an  imperceptible slit, for he turned first to Paula and then to the other  women saying: \"Is it not strange?--Most old folks, like children,  seek the sun, and love to sit, as the others play, in its heat. While  I--something that happened to me years ago--you know;--and it seemed to  freeze my blood. Now it never gets warm, and I feel the contrast between  the coolness in here and the heat outside most acutely, almost as a  pain. The older we grow the more ready we are to abandon to the young  the things we ourselves used most to enjoy. The only thing which we old  folks do not willingly relinquish is personal comfort, and I thank you  for enduring annoyances so patiently for the sake of securing mine.--It  is a terrific summer! You, Paula, from the heights of Lebanon, know what  ice is. How often have I wished that I could have a bed of snow. To feel  myself one with that fresh, still coldness would be all I wish for! The  cold air which you dread does me good. But the warmth of youth rebels  against everything that is cool.\"    This was the first long sentence the Mukaukas had uttered since the  beginning of the game. Orion listened respectfully to the end, but then  he said with a laugh: \"But there are some young people who seem to take  pleasure in being cool and icy--for what cause God alone knows!\"    As he spoke he looked the girl at whom the words were aimed, full in  the face; but she turned silently and proudly away, and an angry shade  passed over her lovely features.          CHAPTER V.    When the Arab was at last admitted to the governor's presence his  attendants unfolded a hanging before him. The giant Masdakite did the  chief share of the work; but as soon as the Mukaukas caught sight of the  big man, with his bushy, mane-like hair, and a dagger and a battle-axe  stuck through his belt, he cried out:    \"Away, away with him! That man--those weapons--I will not look at the  hanging till he is gone.\"    His hands were trembling, and the merchant at once desired his faithful  Rustem, the most harmless of mortals, to quit the room. The governor,  whose sensitive nerves had been liable to such attacks of panic ever  since an exiled Greek had once attempted to murder him, now soon  recovered his composure, and looked with great admiration at the hanging  round which the family were standing. They all confessed they had never  seen anything like it, and the vivacious Dame Susannah proposed to send  for her daughter and her visitors; but it was already late, and her  house was so far from the governor's that she gave that up. The father  and son had already heard of this marvellous piece of work, which had  formed part of the plunder taken by the Arab conquerors of the Persian  Empire at the sack of the \"White Tower\"--the royal palace of Madam, the  capital of the Sassanidze. They knew that it had been originally 300  ells long and 60 ells wide, and had heard with indignation that the  Khaliff Omar, who always lived and dressed and ate like the chief of a  caravan, and looked down with contempt on all such objects of luxury,  had cut this inestimable treasure of art into pieces and divided it  among the Companions of the Prophet.    Haschim explained to them that this particular fragment had been the  share of the booty allotted to Ali, the Prophet's son-in-law. Haschim  himself had seen the work before its dismemberment at Madain, where it  hung on the wall of the magnificent throne-room, and subsequently, at  Medina.    His audience eagerly requested him to describe the other portions; he,  however, seemed somewhat uneasy, looking down at his bare feet which  were standing on the mosaic pavement, damp from the fountain; for, after  the manner of his nation, he had left his shoes in the outer room. The  governor had noticed the old man's gestures as he repeatedly put  his hand to his mouth, and while his wife, Orion, and the widow were  besieging the merchant with questions, he whispered a few words to  one of the slaves. The man vanished, and returned bringing in, by his  master's orders, a long strip of carpet which he laid in front of the  Arab's brown and strong but delicately-formed feet.    A wonderful change came over the merchant's whole being as this was  done. He drew himself up with a dignity which none of those present  had suspected in the man who had so humbly entered the room and so  diligently praised his wares; an expression of satisfaction overspread  his calm, mild features, a sweet smile parted his lips, and his kind  eyes sparkled through tears like those of a child unexpectedly pleased.  Then he bowed before the Mukaukas, touching his brow, lips and breast  with the finger-tips of the right hand to express: \"All my thoughts,  words and feelings are devoted to you,\"--while he said: \"Thanks, Son of  Menas. That was the act of Moslem.\"    \"Of a Christian!\" cried Orion hastily. But his father shook his head  gently, and said, slowly and impressively: \"Only of a man.\"    \"Of a man,\" repeated the merchant, and then he added thoughtfully: \"Of a  man! Yes, that is the highest mark so long as we are what we ought to be  The image of the one God. Who is more compassionate than He? And every  mother's son who is likewise compassionate, is like him.\"    \"Another Christian rule, thou strange Moslem!\" said Orion interrupting  him.    \"And yet,\" said Haschim, with tranquil dignity, \"it corresponds word  for word with the teaching of the Best of men--our Prophet. I am one of  those who knew him here on earth. His brother's smallest pain filled  his soft heart with friendly sympathy; his law insists on charity, even  towards the shrub by the wayside; he pronounces it mortal sin to injure  it, and every Moslem must obey him. Compassion for all is the command  of the Prophet....\" Here the Arab was suddenly and roughly interrupted;  Paula, who, till now, had been leaning against a pilaster, contemplating  the hanging and silently listening to the conversation, hastily stepped  nearer to the old man, and with flaming cheeks and flashing eyes pointed  at him wrathfully, while she exclaimed in a trembling voice-heedless  alike of the astonished and indignant bystanders, and of the little dog  which flew at the Arab, barking furiously:    \"You--you, the followers of the false prophet--you, the companions of  the bloodhound Khalid--you and Charity! I know you! I know what you did  in Syria. With these eyes have I seen you, and your bloodthirsty women,  and the foam on your raging lips. Here I stand to bear witness against  you and I cast it in your teeth: You broke faith in Damascus, and the  victims of your treachery--defenceless women and tender infants as well  as men--you killed with the sword or strangled with your hands. You--you  the Apostle of Compassion?--have you ever heard of Abyla? You, the  friend of your Prophet--I ask you what did you, who so tenderly spare  the tree by the wayside, do to the innocent folk of "]]]
