So  glad we have another taste in common besides our taste for Art.  Now,  about the pecuniary arrangements between us--do tell me--are they  satisfactory?\"    \"Most satisfactory, Mr. Fairlie.\"    \"So glad.  And--what next? Ah! I remember.  Yes.  In reference to the  consideration which you are good enough to accept for giving me the  benefit of your accomplishments in art, my steward will wait on you at  the end of the first week, to ascertain your wishes.  And--what next?  Curious, is it not? I had a great deal more to say: and I appear to  have quite forgotten it.  Do you mind touching the bell? In that  corner.  Yes.  Thank you.\"    I rang; and a new servant noiselessly made his appearance--a foreigner,  with a set smile and perfectly brushed hair--a valet every inch of him.    \"Louis,\" said Mr. Fairlie, dreamily dusting the tips of his fingers  with one of the tiny brushes for the coins, \"I made some entries in my  tablettes this morning.  Find my tablettes.  A thousand pardons, Mr.  Hartright, I'm afraid I bore you.\"    As he wearily closed his eyes again, before I could answer, and as he  did most assuredly bore me, I sat silent, and looked up at the Madonna  and Child by Raphael.  In the meantime, the valet left the room, and  returned shortly with a little ivory book.  Mr. Fairlie, after first  relieving himself by a gentle sigh, let the book drop open with one  hand, and held up the tiny brush with the other, as a sign to the  servant to wait for further orders.    \"Yes.  Just so!\" said Mr. Fairlie, consulting the tablettes. \"Louis,  take down that portfolio.\" He pointed, as he spoke, to several  portfolios placed near the window, on mahogany stands. \"No.  Not the  one with the green back--that contains my Rembrandt etchings, Mr.  Hartright.  Do you like etchings? Yes? So glad we have another taste in  common.  The portfolio with the red back, Louis.  Don't drop it! You  have no idea of the tortures I should suffer, Mr. Hartright, if Louis  dropped that portfolio.  Is it safe on the chair? Do YOU think it safe,  Mr. Hartright? Yes? So glad.  Will you oblige me by looking at the  drawings, if you really think they are quite safe.  Louis, go away.  What an ass you are.  Don't you see me holding the tablettes? Do you  suppose I want to hold them? Then why not relieve me of the tablettes  without being told? A thousand pardons, Mr. Hartright; servants are  such asses, are they not? Do tell me--what do you think of the  drawings? They have come from a sale in a shocking state--I thought  they smelt of horrid dealers' and brokers' fingers when I looked at  them last.  CAN you undertake them?\"    Although my nerves were not delicate enough to detect the odour of  plebeian fingers which had offended Mr. Fairlie's nostrils, my taste  was sufficiently educated to enable me to appreciate the value of the  drawings, while I turned them over.  They were, for the most part,  really fine specimens of English water-colour art; and they had  deserved much better treatment at the hands of their former possessor  than they appeared to have received.    \"The drawings,\" I answered, \"require careful straining and mounting;  and, in my opinion, they are well worth----\"    \"I beg your pardon,\" interposed Mr. Fairlie.  \"Do you mind my closing  my eyes while you speak? Even this light is too much for them.  Yes?\"    \"I was about to say that the drawings are well worth all the time and  trouble----\"    Mr. Fairlie suddenly opened his eyes again, and rolled them with an  expression of helpless alarm in the direction of the window.    \"I entreat you to excuse me, Mr. Hartright,\" he said in a feeble  flutter.  \"But surely I hear some horrid children in the garden--my  private garden--below?\"    \"I can't say, Mr. Fairlie.  I heard nothing myself.\"    \"Oblige me--you have been so very good in humouring my poor  nerves--oblige me by lifting up a corner of the blind.  Don't let the  sun in on me, Mr. Hartright! Have you got the blind up? Yes? Then will  you be so very kind as to look into the garden and make quite sure?\"    I complied with this new request.  The garden was carefully walled in,  all round.  Not a human creature, large or small, appeared in any part  of the sacred seclusion.  I reported that gratifying fact to Mr.  Fairlie.    \"A thousand thanks.  My fancy, I suppose.  There are no children, thank  Heaven, in the house; but the servants (persons born without nerves)  will encourage the children from the village.  Such brats--oh, dear me,  such brats! Shall I confess it, Mr. Hartright?--I sadly want a reform  in the construction of children.  Nature's only idea seems to be to  make them machines for the production of incessant noise.  Surely our  delightful Raffaello's conception is infinitely preferable?\"    He pointed to the picture of the Madonna, the upper part of which  represented the conventional cherubs of Italian Art, celestially  provided with sitting accommodation for their chins, on balloons of  buff-coloured cloud.    \"Quite a model family!\" said Mr. Fairlie, leering at the cherubs. \"Such  nice round faces, and such nice soft wings, and--nothing else.  No  dirty little legs to run about on, and no noisy little lungs to scream  with.  How immeasurably superior to the existing construction! I will  close my eyes again, if you will allow me. And you really can manage  the drawings? So glad.  Is there anything else to settle? if there is,  I think I have forgotten it. Shall we ring for Louis again?\"    Being, by this time, quite as anxious, on my side, as Mr. Fairlie  evidently was on his, to bring the interview to a speedy conclusion, I  thought I would try to render the summoning of the servant unnecessary,  by offering the requisite suggestion on my own responsibility.    \"The only point, Mr. Fairlie, that remains to be discussed,\" I said,  \"refers, I think, to the instruction in sketching which I am engaged to  communicate to the two young ladies.\"    \"Ah! just so,\" said Mr. Fairlie.  \"I wish I felt strong enough to go  into that part of the arrangement--but I don't.  The ladies who profit  by your kind services, Mr. Hartright, must settle, and decide, and so  on, for themselves.  My niece is fond of your charming art.  She knows  just enough about it to be conscious of her own sad defects.  Please  take pains with her.  Yes.  Is there anything else? No.  We quite  understand each other--don't we? I have no right to detain you any  longer from your delightful pursuit--have I? So pleasant to have  settled everything--such a sensible relief to have done business.  Do  you mind ringing for Louis to carry the portfolio to your own room?\"    \"I will carry it there myself, Mr. Fairlie, if you will allow me.\"    \"Will you really? Are you strong enough? How nice to be so strong! Are  you sure you won't drop it? So glad to possess you at Limmeridge, Mr.  Hartright.  I am such a sufferer that I hardly dare hope to enjoy much  of your society.  Would you mind taking great pains not to let the  doors bang, and not to drop the portfolio? Thank you.  Gently with the  curtains, please--the slightest noise from them goes through me like a  knife.  Yes. GOOD morning!\"    When the sea-green curtains were closed, and when the two baize doors  were shut behind me, I stopped for a moment in the little circular hall  beyond, and drew a long, luxurious breath of relief. It was like coming  to the surface of the water after deep diving, to find myself once more  on the outside of Mr. Fairlie's room.    As soon as I was comfortably established for the morning in my pretty  little studio, the first resolution at which I arrived was to turn my  steps no more in the direction of the apartments occupied by the master  of the house, except in the very improbable event of his honouring me  with a special invitation to pay him another visit.  Having settled  this satisfactory plan of future conduct in reference to Mr. Fairlie, I  soon recovered the serenity of temper of which my employer's haughty  familiarity and impudent politeness had, for the moment, deprived me.  The remaining hours of the morning passed away pleasantly enough, in  looking over the drawings, arranging them in sets, trimming their  ragged edges, and accomplishing the other necessary preparations in  anticipation of the business of mounting them.  I ought, perhaps, to  have made more progress than this; but, as the luncheon-time drew near,  I grew restless and unsettled, and felt unable to fix my attention on  work, even though that work was only of the humble manual kind.    At two o'clock I descended again to the breakfast-room, a little  anxiously.  Expectations of some interest were connected with my  approaching reappearance in that part of the house.  My introduction to  Miss Fairlie was now close at hand; and, if Miss Halcombe's search  through her mother's letters had produced the result which she  anticipated, the time had come for clearing up the mystery of the woman  in white.        VIII    When I entered the room, I found Miss Halcombe and an elderly lady  seated at the luncheon-table.    The elderly lady, when I was presented to her, proved to be Miss  Fairlie's former governess, Mrs. Vesey, who had been briefly described  to me by my lively companion at the breakfast-table, as possessed of  \"all the cardinal virtues, and counting for nothing.\" I can do little  more than offer my humble testimony to the truthfulness of Miss  Halcombe's sketch of the old lady's character.  Mrs. Vesey looked the  personification of human composure and female amiability.  A calm  enjoyment of a calm existence beamed in drowsy smiles on her plump,  placid face.  Some of us rush through life, and some of us saunter  through life. Mrs. Vesey SAT through life.  Sat in the house, early and  late; sat in the garden; sat in unexpected window-seats in passages;  sat (on a camp-stool) when her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/584"],[0,"Our Nig; Or, Sketches from the Life of a Free Black, in a Two-story White House, (#9)"],[1," demonstrations.    \"Well, she's gone, gone, Aunt Abby. I hope she'll never come back  again.\"    \"No! no! Frado, that's wrong! you would be wishing her dead; that won't  do.\"    \"Well, I'll bet she'll never come back again; somehow, I feel as though  she wouldn't.\"    \"She is James's sister,\" remonstrated Aunt Abby.    \"So is our cross sheep just as much, that I ducked in the river; I'd  like to try my hand at curing HER too.\"    \"But you forget what our good minister told us last week, about doing  good to those that hate us.\"    \"Didn't I do good, Aunt Abby, when I washed and ironed and packed her  old duds to get rid of her, and helped her pack her trunks, and run here  and there for her?\"    \"Well, well, Frado; you must go finish your work, or your mistress will  be after you, and remind you severely of Miss Mary, and some others  beside.\"    Nig went as she was told, and her clear voice was heard as she went,  singing in joyous notes the relief she felt at the removal of one of her  tormentors.    Day by day the quiet of the sick man's room was increased. He was  helpless and nervous; and often wished change of position, thereby  hoping to gain momentary relief. The calls upon Frado were consequently  more frequent, her nights less tranquil. Her health was impaired by  lifting the sick man, and by drudgery in the kitchen. Her ill health she  endeavored to conceal from James, fearing he might have less repose if  there should be a change of attendants; and Mrs. Bellmont, she well  knew, would have no sympathy for her. She was at last so much reduced as  to be unable to stand erect for any great length of time. She would SIT  at the table to wash her dishes; if she heard the well-known step of her  mistress, she would rise till she returned to her room, and then sink  down for further rest. Of course she was longer than usual in completing  the services assigned her. This was a subject of complaint to Mrs.  Bellmont; and Frado endeavored to throw off all appearance of sickness  in her presence.    But it was increasing upon her, and she could no longer hide her  indisposition. Her mistress entered one day, and finding her seated,  commanded her to go to work. \"I am sick,\" replied Frado, rising and  walking slowly to her unfinished task, \"and cannot stand long, I feel so  bad.\"    Angry that she should venture a reply to her command, she suddenly  inflicted a blow which lay the tottering girl prostrate on the floor.  Excited by so much indulgence of a dangerous passion, she seemed left to  unrestrained malice; and snatching a towel, stuffed the mouth of the  sufferer, and beat her cruelly.    Frado hoped she would end her misery by whipping her to death. She bore  it with the hope of a martyr, that her misery would soon close. Though  her mouth was muffled, and the sounds much stifled, there was a sensible  commotion, which James' quick ear detected.    \"Call Frado to come here,\" he said faintly, \"I have not seen her  to-day.\"    Susan retired with the request to the kitchen, where it was evident some  brutal scene had just been enacted.    Mrs. Bellmont replied that she had \"some work to do just now; when that  was done, she might come.\"    Susan's appearance confirmed her husband's fears, and he requested his  father, who sat by the bedside, to go for her. This was a messenger, as  James well knew, who could not be denied; and the girl entered the room,  sobbing and faint with anguish.    James called her to him, and inquired the cause of her sorrow. She was  afraid to expose the cruel author of her misery, lest she should provoke  new attacks. But after much entreaty, she told him all, much which had  escaped his watchful ear. Poor James shut his eyes in silence, as if  pained to forgetfulness by the recital. Then turning to Susan, he asked  her to take Charlie, and walk out; \"she needed the fresh air,\" he said.  \"And say to mother I wish Frado to sit by me till you return. I think  you are fading, from staying so long in this sick room.\" Mr. B. also  left, and Frado was thus left alone with her friend. Aunt Abby came in  to make her daily visit, and seeing the sick countenance of the  attendant, took her home with her to administer some cordial. She soon  returned, however, and James kept her with him the rest of the day; and  a comfortable night's repose following, she was enabled to continue, as  usual, her labors. James insisted on her attending religious meetings in  the vicinity with Aunt Abby.    Frado, under the instructions of Aunt Abby and the minister, became a  believer in a future existence--one of happiness or misery. Her doubt  was, IS there a heaven for the black? She knew there was one for James,  and Aunt Abby, and all good white people; but was there any for blacks?  She had listened attentively to all the minister said, and all Aunt Abby  had told her; but then it was all for white people.    As James approached that blessed world, she felt a strong desire to  follow, and be with one who was such a dear, kind friend to her.    While she was exercised with these desires and aspirations, she attended  an evening meeting with Aunt Abby, and the good man urged all, young or  old, to accept the offers of mercy, to receive a compassionate Jesus as  their Saviour. \"Come to Christ,\" he urged, \"all, young or old, white or  black, bond or free, come all to Christ for pardon; repent, believe.\"    This was the message she longed to hear; it seemed to be spoken for her.  But he had told them to repent; \"what was that?\" she asked. She knew she  was unfit for any heaven, made for whites or blacks. She would gladly  repent, or do anything which would admit her to share the abode of  James.    Her anxiety increased; her countenance bore marks of solicitude unseen  before; and though she said nothing of her inward contest, they all  observed a change.    James and Aunt Abby hoped it was the springing of good seed sown by the  Spirit of God. Her tearful attention at the last meeting encouraged his  aunt to hope that her mind was awakened, her conscience aroused. Aunt  Abby noticed that she was particularly engaged in reading the Bible; and  this strengthened her conviction that a heavenly Messenger was striving  with her. The neighbors dropped in to inquire after the sick, and also  if Frado was \"SERIOUS?\" They noticed she seemed very thoughtful and  tearful at the meetings. Mrs. Reed was very inquisitive; but Mrs.  Bellmont saw no appearance of change for the better. She did not feel  responsible for her spiritual culture, and hardly believed she had a  soul.    Nig was in truth suffering much; her feelings were very intense on any  subject, when once aroused. She read her Bible carefully, and as often  as an opportunity presented, which was when entirely secluded in her own  apartment, or by Aunt Abby's side, who kindly directed her to Christ,  and instructed her in the way of salvation.    Mrs. Bellmont found her one day quietly reading her Bible. Amazed and  half crediting the reports of officious neighbors, she felt it was time  to interfere. Here she was, reading and shedding tears over the Bible.  She ordered her to put up the book, and go to work, and not be  snivelling about the house, or stop to read again.    But there was one little spot seldom penetrated by her mistress'  watchful eye: this was her room, uninviting and comfortless; but to  herself a safe retreat. Here she would listen to the pleadings of a  Saviour, and try to penetrate the veil of doubt and sin which clouded  her soul, and long to cast off the fetters of sin, and rise to the  communion of saints.    Mrs. Bellmont, as we before said, did not trouble herself about the  future destiny of her servant. If she did what she desired for HER  benefit, it was all the responsibility she acknowledged. But she seemed  to have great aversion to the notice Nig would attract should she become  pious. How could she meet this case? She resolved to make her complaint  to John. Strange, when she was always foiled in this direction, she  should resort to him. It was time something was done; she had begun to  read the Bible openly.    The night of this discovery, as they were retiring, Mrs. Bellmont  introduced the conversation, by saying:    \"I want your attention to what I am going to say. I have let Nig go out  to evening meetings a few times, and, if you will believe it, I found  her reading the Bible to-day, just as though she expected to turn pious  nigger, and preach to white folks. So now you see what good comes of  sending her to school. If she should get converted she would have to go  to meeting: at least, as long as James lives. I wish he had not such  queer notions about her. It seems to trouble him to know he must die and  leave her. He says if he should get well he would take her home with  him, or educate her here. Oh, how awful! What can the child mean? So  careful, too, of her! He says we shall ruin her health making her work  so hard, and sleep in such a place. O, John! do you think he is in his  right mind?\"    \"Yes, yes; she is slender.\"    \"Yes, YES!\" she repeated sarcastically, \"you know these niggers are just  like black snakes; you CAN'T kill them. If she wasn't tough she would  have been killed long ago. There was never one of my girls could do half  the work.\"    \"Did they ever try?\" interposed her husband. \"I think she can do more  than all of them together.\"    \"What a man!\" said she, peevishly. \"But I want to know what is going to  be done with her about getting pious?\"    \"Let her do just as she has a mind to. If it is a comfort to her, let  her enjoy the privilege of being good. I see no objection.\"    \"I should think YOU were crazy, sure. Don't you know that every night  she will want to go toting off to meeting? and Sundays, too? and you  know we have a great deal of company Sundays, and she can't be spared.\"    \"I thought you Christians held to going to church,\" remarked Mr. B.    \"Yes, but who ever thought"]]]
