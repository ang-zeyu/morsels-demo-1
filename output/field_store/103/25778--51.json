It was a piece of string and Baby's vengeance.          CHAPTER VII    \"What Say You to Falling in Love?\"      Meg was looking ill, there was no doubt about it.  Her pretty  pink-and-white complexion was losing its fresh look, a slightly  irritable expression had settled round a mouth that a few months  back had seemed made for smiles only.  And terribly unromantic  fact, her nose was quite florid-looking at times. Now a heroine  may have the largest, deepest, and most heavily lashed eyes  imaginable; she may have hair in very truth like the gold \"mown  from a harvest's middle floor\"; she may have lips like cherries  and teeth like pearls, and a red nose will be so utterly fatal  that all these other charms will pass unnoticed.  It cost Meg real  anguish of spirit. She carefully read all the Answers to Correspondents  in the various papers Aldith lent her in search of a remedy, but  nearly everyone seemed to be asking for recipes to promote the  growth of the eyelashes or to prevent _embonpoint_.  Not one she  chanced on said, \"A red nose in a girl is generally caused by  indigestion or tight-lacing.\"  She asked Aldith to suggest something,  and that young person thought that vaseline and sulphur mixed  together, and spread over the afflicted member, would have the  desired effect.  So every night Meg fastened her bedroom door  with a wedge of wood, keys being unknown luxuries at Misrule,  and anointed her, poor little nose most carefully with the  greasy mixture, lying all night on her back to prevent it  rubbing off on the pillow.    Once Pip had forced his way into demand a few stitches for his  braces which had split, and she had been compelled to wrap her  whole face hastily up in a towel and declare she had violent  neuralgia, and he must go to Esther or one of the servants.  Had  he seen and known the cause there would have been no end to the  teasing.    Nowadays Meg spent a great deal of time in her bedroom, that she  had all to herself while Judy was away.  In its privacy she  trimmed and retrimmed her hats, altered her dresses, read her  novels, and sat in front of the looking-glass with her hair down,  dreaming of being quite grown up and in love.  For just now both  to Aldith, and herself that state of life seemed the only one  altogether lovely and desirable.  Meg used to curl herself up in a  big easy-chair that had drifted to her room because its springs  were broken, and dream long, beautiful, hopeless dreams of a lover  with \"long black lashes and a soldierly carriage.\"  Of course it  was highly reprehensible to have such thoughts at the tender age  of sixteen, but then the child had no mother to check that erring  imagination, and she was a daughter of the South.    Australian girls nearly always begin to think of \"lovers and  nonsense,\" as middlefolks call it, long before their English aged  sisters do.  While still in the short-frock period of existence,  and while their hair is still free-flowing, they take the keenest  interest in boys--boys of neighbouring schools, other girls' brothers,  young bank clerks, and the like.  Not because they would be good  playmates, but because they look at them in the light of possible  \"sweethearts.\"  I do not say English girl children are free from this.  By no means; in every school there may be found one or two this way  inclined, giggling, forward young things who want whipping and  sending to play cricket or dolls again.  But in this land of  youthfulness it is the rule more frequently than the exception, and  herein lies the chief defect of the very young Australian girl.  She is like a peach, a beautiful, smooth, rich peach, that has come  to ripeness almost in a day, and that hastens to rub off the soft,  delicate bloom that is its chief charm, just to show its bright,  warm colouring more clearly.  Aldith had, to her own infinite  satisfaction, brushed away her own \"bloom,\" and was at present  busily engaged in trying to remove Meg's, which was very soft  and lovely before she touched it.  The novels had taken away a  little, and the \"Block\" a little more, but, Meg was naturally  freshminded, and it took time to make much difference.  Just now,  under her friend's tutelage, she was being inducted into the  delightful mysteries of sweethearting, and for the time, it quite  filled her some what purposeless young life.  But it all ended  with an adventure that years afterwards used to make her cheeks  tingle painfully at the thought.    After the bi-weekly French lesson, as I have said, the two friends  used to come back together in the river-boat at five o'clock.  And by this boat there always came two boys by the name of Courtney,  and a third boy, Aldith's particular property, James Graham.  Now  the young people had become known to each other at picnics and the  like in the neighbourhood, but the acquaintance, instead of  ripening on frequent meeting into a frank, pleasant friendship,  had taken the turn of secrecy and silly playing at love.  James  Graham was in a lawyer's office, a young articled cleric of  seventeen in undue haste to be that delightful thing, a man.  He carried a cane, and was very particular about his hat and  necktie and his boots, which generally were tan.  And he had  the faintest possible moustache, that he caressed with great  frequency; and that privately Aldith thought adorable.  Aldith's  pert, sprightly manner pleased him, and in a very short time  they had got to the period of passing notes into each other's  hands and sighing sentimentally.  Not that the notes contained  much harm, they were generally of rather a formal character.      \"My dear' Miss MacCarthy,\" one would run--    \"Why were you not on the boat yesterday?  I looked for you till  it was no use looking longer, and then the journey was blank.  How charmingly that big hat suits you, and those jonquils at  your neck.  Might I beg one of the flowers? just one, please,  Aldith.    Your devoted friend,    James Graham.\"      And Aldith's, written on a sheet of her note-book with a pink  programme pencil that she always kept in her purse, might be  no worse than:      \"Dear Mr. Graham,    \"What EVER can you want these flowers at my neck for?  They have  been there all day, and are dead and spoiled.  I can't IMAGINE what  good they'll be to you.  Still, of course, if you REALLY care for  them you shall have them.  I am so glad you like this hat.  I shall  always like it NOW.  Did you REALLY miss me yesterday?  I had gone  to have my photo taken.  Marguerite thinks it very good indeed,  but I am SURE it flatters me TOO much.    Yours truly,    L. Aldith Evelyn MacCarthy.\"      Now Mr. James Graham had a great friend in one of the before-mentioned  Courtney boys, Andrew by name.  He was a handsome lad of eighteen,  still a schoolboy, but possessed of fascinating manners and a pair  of really beautiful eyes.    And, since his friend and companion Jim had taken to \"having fun\"  with \"the girl MacCarthy,\" he objected to being left out in the  cold.  So he began to pay marked attentions to Meg, who blushed  right up to her soft, pretty fringe every time he spoke to her,  and looked painfully conscious and guilty if he said anything at  all complimentary to her.    The other boy, Alan Courtney, was very tall and broad-shouldered,  and not at all good-looking.  He had a strong, plain face, grey  eyes deeply set, and brown hair that looked as if he was in a  constant state of rumpling it up the wrong way.  He was a University  student, and a great footballer, and he never diverted himself on  the long homeward journey in the way Andrew and his friend did.    He used generally to give a half-contemptuous nod as he passed  the little group, uncovering his head for the shortest possible  period consistent with civility, and making his way to the far  end of the boat.  One time as he passed them Aldith was drooping  her lashes and using her eyes with great effect, and Meg was almost  positive she heard him mutter under his breath, \"Silly young fools!\"  He used to smoke at his end of the boat--cigars at the beginning  of term and a short, black, villainous-looking pipe at the end--and  Meg used secretly to think how manly he looked, and to sigh profoundly.    For I may as well tell you now as later what this foolish little  thing had done after a few months' course of Aldith and novels.  She had fallen in love as nearly as it is possible for sweet sixteen  to do; and it was with Alan, who had no good looks nor pleasant  manners--not Andrew, who had speaking eyes, and curls that \"made  his forehead like the rising sun\"; not Andrew, who gave her tender  glances and conversation peppermints that said \"My heart is thine,\"  but Alan, who took no notice whatever of her beyond an occasional  half-scornful bow.    Poor little Meg!  She was very miserable in these days, and yet it  was a kind of exquisite misery that she hugged to her to keep it  warm.  No one guessed her secret.  She would have died rather than  allow even Aldith to get a suspicion of it, and accepted Andrew's  notes and smiles as if there was nothing more she wanted.  But she  grew a trifle thin and large-eyed, and used to make copious notes  in her diary every night, and to write a truly appalling quantity  of verses, in which \"heart\" and \"part,\" \"grieve\" and \"leave,\"  \"weep\" and \"keep,\" and \"sigh\" and \"die,\" were most often the  concluding words of the lines.  She endured Andrew for several  reasons.  He was Alan's brother for one thing, and was always  saying things about \"old Al,\" and recording his prowess on the  football field; and Aldith might"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47316"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 2 of 3) (#9)"],[1,"ere, first, that on the night of  his nativity there would be no darkness upon the lands inhabited by  the Nephites; that is, in the western hemisphere. \"There shall be  one day and a night and a day,\" said one of the prophets, \"as if it  were one day and there were no night; and this shall be unto you for  a sign; for ye shall know of the rising of the sun and also of its  setting; therefore they shall know of a surety that there shall be two  days and a night; nevertheless the night shall not be darkened; and it  shall be the night before he is born.\" [13] Second: A new star was to  rise, \"such an one as ye never have beheld,\" said the prophet to the  Nephites, \"and this also shall be a sign unto you.\" [14] Third: Many  signs and wonders were to be seen in heaven, but the nature of which is  not stated by the prophet. [15].    Signs of Messiah's death were predicted. First, on the day he suffered  death, the sun would be darkened and refuse to give his light, and  also the moon and the stars; and darkness would cover the whole face  of the Nephite lands, from the time that he suffered death until his  resurrection from the dead. Second, at the time of his dying there  would be thundering and lightnings; earthquakes would rend the rocks,  lay mountains low, and cast up valleys into mountains; the highways  would be broken up, and many cities be made desolate. Third, many  graves would be opened and yield up their dead, and many Saints would  be raised from the dead and appear unto the living, who had not been  destroyed in these judgments. These were the signs that were to give  evidence to the people of the western world of the birth of the  promised Christ, and of his death, and his resurrection; all of which  things, in due time, came to pass, even as they had been predicted.  But what is better still, after the Christ's resurrection from the  dead, and after these terrible judgments had swept over the western  land, destroying the more wicked part of the inhabitants, Jesus himself  appeared unto the Nephite people, and this in fulfilment of his own  declaration to his disciples at Jerusalem, when he said:        Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must      bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold,      and one shepherd. [16]    The Christ's appearance to the Nephites was first made to a multitude  gathered about the temple in what was called the land Bountiful. He  descended out of heaven and stood in their midst, announcing himself  to be Jesus Christ, whom the prophets had testified would come into  the world. \"I am the light and the life of the world,\" said he, \"and I  have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and  have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in  which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the  beginning. And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words,  the whole multitude fell to the earth, for they remembered that it had  been prophesied among them that Christ would show himself unto them  after his ascension into heaven.\" At the commandment of Jesus, the  multitude arose and came to him, and beheld the wounds in his side and  in his hands. When they had all gone forth and witnessed for themselves  that he was indeed the Christ, they cried out with one accord,  \"Hosanna, hosanna, blessed be the name of the most high God. And they  did fall down at the feet of Jesus and worshiped him.\"    Thus Jesus continued ministering among them for some time. Just how  long he remained or how many times he appeared to them cannot be  determined from the Book of Mormon. Neither is that a matter of any  great importance, but it is important that he chose twelve disciples  and conferred upon them divine authority to administer the ordinances  of the gospel. He proclaimed himself to be, as will be seen from  what has been said, the Son of God. He also taught that his Father,  Himself, and the Holy Ghost constituted one God-head; that men to be  saved must believe in God, repent of their sins, receive baptism for  the remission of sins, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost in order to  establish complete fellowship and oneness between themselves and God  and his Christ. The twelve were authorized to call to their assistance  subordinate officers and organize those who accepted the gospel into  the holy Church of Christ. In addition to these doctrinal instructions  Jesus delivered also the highly moral and spiritual precepts of the  gospel, delivered them, as might be expected, much in the same form as  they are to be found in our New Testament scriptures. What is found in  the Book of Mormon of his teaching so nearly conforms to the doctrines  and moral precepts of the New Testament, that it becomes a mighty  witness for the substantial correctness of what is recorded in the New  Testament, so that the Book of Mormon is a witness of the truth not  only of the Old Testament but very largely also of the New.    Among other things of importance which Jesus declared to the Nephites  was the fact that it was his intention to visit \"the lost tribes\" of  the house of Israel, reveal himself to them, and proclaim the same  gospel he had delivered to the Nephites, and spoke of the time when the  testimonies of the Nephites and the lost tribes of the house of Israel,  with the testimonies of those among whom he had labored in Judea,  should be brought together in one.    Jesus also administered to the sick, the maimed and the blind among the  Nephites, and showed forth the great power of God in his ministrations,  falling behind in nothing, in these respects, to the miraculous powers  that were displayed in his ministry in Judea; but on the contrary,  in consequence of the greater faith of the Nephite people, and their  righteousness, the display of almighty power went beyond the marvelous  works wrought in Judea; for the greater part of the wicked among the  Nephites had been destroyed by the judgments of God which preceded  Messiah's coming, leaving only the more righteous part of the people to  meet with him, at this his glorious advent among them; and hence they  were prepared to receive greater blessings at the hands of God than  were the people in Judea.    The Church of Christ, thus founded by the Messiah and the twelve  disciples he had chosen, reaped a rich harvest in the salvation of  souls in the western world. For nearly two centuries the truth of God  was almost universally accepted. A reign of righteousness was enjoyed.  Peace, prosperity, fraternity and happiness prevailed, and God was  worshiped in spirit and in truth:      \"But man is frail, and can but ill sustain    A long immunity from grief and pain;    And after all the Joys which Plenty leads,    With tip-toe step, Vice silently succeeds.\"    And so it was in the experience of the Nephites. Wickedness reared  its head among them; pride, born of self-love, took possession of  the souls of some, and inroads were made in the unity and peace of  the Church. These evils continued to spread until at last the spirit  of apostasy was rampant, in the western world, as in the eastern;  men departed from God and his ways until rebellion, disunion, and  anarchy everywhere prevailed; civilization was overwhelmed; and people  descended to barbarism, and, at last, for the most part, to savagery.  In this condition they were discovered by the Europeans, near the close  of the fifteenth century. But notwithstanding this decline from the  religion of Jesus Christ and a high state of civilization, what had  been accomplished through the revelation of the gospel of Jesus Christ  to the western world was of great importance. As already stared, the  harvest of souls in the periods when righteousness prevailed, was very  great; and the records which had been written by prophets and holy men,  and preserved with great care by the commandment of God, were destined  to be of immense importance in future ages. They would proclaim with  trumpet tongue the justice and the mercy of God; they would demonstrate  that the Lord has in mind the salvation of all races and nations of  men; they would stand forth as the most important witness for the  authenticity and general truth of the Jewish scriptures, both of the  Old and the New testaments; they would be the voice of sleeping nations  testifying that Moses did write the Pentateuch; they would bear witness  that Isaiah is the author of the prophecies ascribed to him; that  Jesus is the Christ, \"the very eternal God,\" [17] that he suffered for  the sins of the sins of the world, therein glorifying the Father, and  accomplishing the purposes of God with reference to the salvation of  men; they would bear witness that there is no name given under heaven  whereby men can be saved but the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of  God; and finally, those Nephite records, in the Book of Mormon, would  establish the great and supreme truths that God is a reality--that  he lives; that man is the child of God; that he is immortal, and  accountable to God for his actions; that he may be saved through  acceptance of and continued obedience to the gospel.    A writer held much in esteem by the orthodox Christian world--and  deservedly so--in a noble work but recently issued from the press, said:        Were a parchment discovered in an Egyptian mound, six inches      square, containing fifty words which were certainly spoken by      Jesus, this utterance would count more than all the books which      have been published since the first century. If a veritable picture      of the Lord could be unearthed from a catacomb, and the world could      see with its own eyes what like he was, it would not matter that      its colors were faded, and that it was roughly drawn, that picture      would have at once a solitary place amid the treasures of art.
