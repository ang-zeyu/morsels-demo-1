When she saw who was come for her she leaned forward in the cone.  \"Where's the maister to?\" she asked.    Jim, who was getting ready to start, looked over his shoulder.  \"He's  gone fishin'.\"    \"Fishin'?\"  She had thought he might have gone on business down one of  the many crooked streets of the little town, business from which he  would return in time to drive her home.    \"Fishin' for bass on the Head.\"    \"Whatever took'n in the 'ead to do that to-day?\" she said and dwelt for  a moment on the incomprehensible nature of man.  Strange that Leadville  should not want to share her triumph, the triumph of the woman who  belonged to him, who was flesh of his flesh; to share this triumph which  was, in part, his.  She had been in excellent spirits, but his absence  dashed them.  It required the manifested goodwill of the people in the  streets to restore her equanimity.    In spite of this drawback, however, her progress was, in its way, royal.  Throned in the wagon she passed slowly along the main road.  Placed thus  high and with trunk and head emerging from the wicker cone like an  amazing flower, she was undoubtedly a queer figure; but the people who  came running up the lanes and out of the houses along the route, to give  her the blessing of their good wishes, missed the queerness.  They had  known her all the forty years of her life.  She was part of the setting  in which they played their humble parts.  A little prejudiced in her  favour through long association, this display of primitive courage moved  them.  They welcomed it as in keeping with the family tradition, as  something worthy, and they offered it the kind encouragement of hearty  handshakes and good words.    \"I be pretty an' glad to see yer come 'ome again, ma'am.  Terrible,  terrible accident, you must 'av 'ad; still you don't seem to make much  of't.  Mary Elizabeth's brought 'ee a few lilies.\"    \"That trolly be a clever thought of yours, Mrs. Byron. I never see  nothing like it before.\"    \"I reckon you've 'ad a draggin' time, ma'am.  We'm all glad to 'av 'ee  back again.\"    \"Do 'ee take and drink up this cup of milk and eat a bit of yeller cake  or 'ee'll be faintin' before 'ee come to Trevorrick,\" said a farmer's  wife.    \"If 'ee'd like a glass of wine now, you've only to say the word, and you  can 'av it,\" interposed the landlord of the Dolphin; \"I'd be proud to  serve 'ee.\"    \"I be come 'ome,\" said Sabina to her charioteer as they jogged on and  her voice had a contented ring. She had forgotten the disappointment of  Leadville's absence.  She was come back to her own people and her own  place and she was welcome.    The young man lifted a smiling face and she remembered that this was the  'pretty boy' who was courting her niece.  She looked at him with  interest.  He was certainly good-looking, definitely so, a tall slim  youth with a fine profile, deeply-set dark-blue eyes, black hair and a  small tawny moustache.  She wondered how the courtship was progressing.  Gray, with cloudy hair about a wind-flower face, would make a charming  bride. Sabina's thoughts ran nimbly forward.  She saw the young couple  housed at Wastralls, Rosevear working the farm under her direction and  the old cradle once more in use.  The prospect promised her an autumn  happiness.  Wonderful indeed, the way in which the wind is tempered to  the shorn!    When the farm cart turned off the highway by St. Cadic Mill, Sabina  found Constantine Rosevear and his wife waiting by the roadside.  The  big florid man, though he had wife and three grown sons, had never been  able to forget that Sabina was the woman he should have married.  His  Betsey was all right but, about Sabina, lingered the glamour of romance.    \"I been in terrible fear,\" he told her simply, \"and I'm 'avin' holiday  to-day.  If you don't mind I'll walk down to Wastralls with you.  You  don't know 'ow glad I be to see ye 'ome again and lookin' so well too.\"    Sabina's heart beat irregularly for a moment.  If only Leadville would  talk to her like this!  She comforted herself with the thought that his  being undemonstrative did not mean he was unfeeling.  Words did not come  easily to him, but still waters run deep.    The cottagers about the smithy threw more flowers into the cart.  \"Might  be May Day,\" as Sabina said, with her happy smile.  At Hember, Tom  Rosevear was waiting with four of his daughters.  \"Mother's down to  Wastralls wi' Gray,\" he said and the blooming girls, the so-called  nieces, raised their young voices in affectionate greeting.  'Aunt  S'bina' had been the fairy godmother of the family, always willing to  abet them in any piece of innocent fun.  They were sincerely glad to  have her back.    The drive had been long for one just out of hospital, but the kindliness  of friends and neighbours had proved a stimulant.  When the wagon turned  into the yard of Wastralls, however, Sabina was almost too tired to note  the changes that had been made.  The absence of the honeysuckle caused  the porch to look bare, the old sheepdog was no longer lying in the sun;  but Leadville had come back from the fishing and was ready to lift her  down.  At sight of him the tired face brightened.  \"I'm glad to come  'ome again,\" she said.    The man had been standing idly by the door.  Having drawn nothing out of  the sea he had come back in a mood which was not uninfluenced by his  lack of success. Everything had gone wrong, his hopes were dashed, his  plans had miscarried and he searched the landscape in vain for any hope  of change.  Sabina was well again, she had already asserted her will  with regard to the farm and before him lay a future as dreary as the  past.    He lifted his eyes as the beflowered cortege rolled into the yard.  He  had expected a sort of chair and the trolly with its basket-work cone  was an unpleasant surprise; while the sight of his wife, in brightly  coloured gown and pink sunbonnet, swelling out of it like a monstrous  fruit, completed his dismay.  She was a figure of fun, a queer oddity,  repellent as something out of nature.  The bravery that faced the  sunshine as simply as in the days of its strength did not appeal to him,  he was only conscious of the deformity.  His heart contracted, emptied  itself of good-will, then slowly filled again--but not with kindliness.    The business of unloading occupied the men for some minutes and Mrs.  Rosevear, taking the parcels, handed them to her daughter.    \"What a lovely lot o' flowers.  I should think every garden for miles  round will be bare.\"    \"Take care o' that box,\" cried Sabina, suddenly, as they lifted out the  case that was suggestive of a coffin. \"I value that.\"    \"Where be 'ee gwine put it, auntie?\"    \"In the cupboard in the big parlour.\"    \"What 'av 'ee got in it?\"    \"Ah, my dear, ask me no questions and I tell 'ee no lies.\"    \"'Ere, I'll take that,\" said Mrs. Tom, intervening, \"I know where it got  to be put.  'Tis what you told me of, S'bina?\"    Mrs. Byron nodded.  \"Iss, I've brought it back wi' me.  Doctor said I  was maaeze to do it; but I said I would, an' I 'av.\"    A meal was ready on the kitchen table, a piece of stout wood which had  weathered the use and elbow-grease of more than a century.  This room  had been for three generations the gathering-place of the family.  Innumerable savoury meals had been cooked on the slab range; hams in a  succession longer than that of the Kings of England had been lifted from  the rafter hooks and, after the buffetings of winter and the scorch of  summer, men had taken their ease on the bench while women made and  mended.  Old tales had been told and retold by deep voices, tales of  witches, of wreckers, of people 'pisky-led'n'; and the sound of them  lingered in the dim corners.  They were waiting for the new generation  which should utter once more the familiar words and keep alive the  traditions.    \"I never thought I should ever be back 'ere any more,\" said Sabina,  contentedly, as she ran her trolly up to the table and, by a contrivance  similar to that on a dentist's chair, reduced her height to a sitting  level. \"It do seem good to be 'ome.  Everything look so natural.\"    \"Well, 'twould be funny if it didn't,\" said Mrs. Rosevear, helping the  meat.    \"Don't seem as if I'd been all that time away.\"    \"I expect it do to Leadville.\"    His wife turned to him.  \"What do 'ee think of my invention?\"    \"I can't abide it,\" said the man, with the emphasis of sincere feeling.    The others looked at him in surprise.  \"I'll always be thinking of what  you was,\" he added hastily.    Sabina's face clouded, but only for a moment.  \"Let's make the best of  things,\" she said.  \"I'm goin' to forget about them times, I'm goin' to  live for the moment.\"    \"I'm not one as forgets,\" said Leadville heavily.    Revived by food and rest Sabina was soon impatient to begin a further  progress.  She trundled herself into the linhay to inspect the milk and  butter; then into the two seldom-used rooms known as the Big and Little  Parlour.  Beyond them lay the wide shallow stairs, the door into the  front part of the house and the long Justice Room.    Mrs. Tom threw open the door of this and Sabina, pushing the trolly in,  uttered an exclamation of pleasure. The litter of agricultural  implements, broken harness, bags and boxes, had been cleared away, the  grates had been blacked and the panelled wall painted a shadowy grey.  Between the two fireplaces stood a large bed, the posts of which were  carved with corn, fruit and other emblems of fertility.  On it lay a  patchwork quilt, the work of Sabina's grandmother.  Drift-wood fires  flamed under the white marble mantelpieces and the coverlet shone with  the glistening silks of other days.  The spacious room with its  white-hung bed and its white curtains, smelt of the sea and Sabina  turned and smiled at her husband.    \"'Av you moved your clothes down?\" she asked.    \"Not that I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53372"],[0,"Star of India (#9)"],[1," house, he had no better luck: the place seemed  deserted. Where had they all hidden themselves?    He could not know that Stella was an unwilling prisoner upstairs,  helping Aunt Augusta to sort household linen; that Mrs. Carrington,  still resting, believed him to be enjoying the society of Ellen, whereas  Ellen had locked herself into her bedroom, helplessly perturbed.    Only just before dinner did he have the chance of speaking to Stella  without being overheard. \"I saw you come back,\" he said to her, a tender  inflection in his voice. \"Were you tired? Was the basket heavy?\"    \"Oh, no,\" she replied mischievously; \"I only felt overburdened with  virtue. A handsome young man wanted to carry the basket for me, and I  would not let him!\"    \"Thought you might be found out?\" he suggested with a chuckle.    \"That was about it!\" she said, recklessly candid. \"Oh, _do_ tell me: was  anything settled this afternoon? I know you were all talking me over. Am  I to stay here for the rest of my life?\"    \"Have a little patience,\" he teased, finding a subtle pleasure in her  obvious disappointment with his reply.    That evening, after dinner, he discovered that Stella had a voice. She  sang a little song, something about a star, to Aunt Ellen's  accompaniment, and though Stella herself was clearly bored by the words  of the song, and despite lack of training and feeling, her voice was  deep and sweet--well worth cultivation, as he quickly decided. She  should have singing lessons before they sailed for India.    The song ended, he found an opportunity to whisper: \"That was  delightful. Stella--a star! Some day perhaps a star of India?\"    \"But that's a decoration, isn't it?\" she asked, pleased and eager. \"And  not for women? Have you got it?\"    He looked at her intently, narrowing his eyes. \"No, I haven't got my  star--_yet_.\"    \"But you will have it--soon?\"    \"Yes, very soon.\"    Stella felt mystified. Had she said the wrong thing? Perhaps it was a  sore point with him that he had not received the distinction earlier?    \"Can you sing?\" she inquired quickly, to change the subject.    \"Well, I used to,\" he admitted.    \"Oh, do let us see if we have any songs you know. Aunt Ellen, Colonel  Crayfield will sing if we can find something he knows.\"    There followed much turning over of music, but without success. Then  Stella lifted the lid of the small ottoman that served as a piano-stool,  disclosing several bound books of music; she dragged them forth; beneath  them lay a number of songs in manuscript. Ellen intervened.    \"You will find nothing among those; they are so old,\" she said hastily,  as again her niece delved, and produced \"Wings,\" \"Adieu,\" \"The Arab's  Farewell to His Favourite Steed.\"    Colonel Crayfield shook his head at them all, but he laid his hand on  the next sheet of music that, in spite of Aunt Ellen's unaccountable  obstruction, was excavated by Stella.    \"That!\" he exclaimed, mingled recognition and reluctance in his tone.  Forthwith Stella placed it on the stand and began to read the  accompaniment, that might have been transcribed with a pin.    \"Now?\" She looked up at her godfather, gaily insistent.    And Colonel Crayfield, with an air of amused capitulation, sang in a  good bass voice that was not so very rusty:           \"I gave my love a little rose,         A little rose of red and white,       Because her colour comes and goes         Whene'er I dawn upon her sight.         I gave my love a little key,         A little key of yellow gold,       Because she locks her sweets from me,         And will not her dear heart unfold.         I gave my love a little dove,         Around its neck a feathery ring,       Because a ring betokens love,         And love to my sweet love I bring.         And in return what gave my love         Of all the precious gifts that be?       No rose, nor key, nor ring-necked dove--         She gave but her sweet self to me!\"      Mrs. Carrington and Augusta murmured polite applause, though they  thoroughly disapproved of the words. They said they had heard the song  before, though they could not recall when, or by whom, it had been sung.    Ellen could have told them. Poor Ellen! The gay young cousin had sung  it, sung it to _her_ in those far-off days that now were as a faint,  impossible dream. She herself had copied the music and the words with an  etching pen, and purposely had buried the manuscript at the bottom of  the ottoman where for so long she had guarded it jealously. Only on the  rare occasions when she was alone in the house did she take it out and  tinkle the accompaniment, whispering the words. It seemed a sort of  sacrilege to Ellen that the song should have been exhumed by the  careless Stella to be sung with zest in a loud voice that destroyed the  echo of the beautiful tenor, the remembrance of which caused her heart  to ache and brought tears to her eyes.    Stella, with girlish enthusiasm, pronounced the song to be \"perfectly  sweet,\" and proceeded to hunt through the rest of the pile. Colonel  Crayfield watched her lithe movements; he was well satisfied with his  own performance, and he smiled to himself as he recollected the last  occasion on which he had sung this song--to a pretty young married  woman with whom at that time he was pleasantly philandering; the lady  had burst into tears at the piano, an affecting scene had ensued, and  the husband had all but surprised them; it had been just touch-and-go, a  Providential escape. What on earth was her name? He could only remember  that her hair was golden and her eyes like forget-me-nots!    Never mind, it did not matter; all that mattered to him was this  exquisite child who was to learn the facts and the meaning of marriage  from him and from him alone.... If only the three tiresome old women  were out of the room--the two spinsters, scraggy and genteel; the old  mother, austere and cold; and to add to his provocation, when Mrs.  Carrington beckoned Stella to her side that she might kiss her  good-night, he heard the old lady forbid her to go out before breakfast  next morning. No reason was given, only the order. What tyranny! Was it  any wonder that, apart from everything else, Stella should yearn to  escape from The Chestnuts? Stella glanced at him ruefully over her  grandmother's head; he returned her a nod of sympathetic understanding.  Next day it should all be different. He enjoyed the prospect of  astounding the old martinet.      The following morning Mrs. Carrington was not so easy to corner. When  she appeared Ellen was in close attendance, and Stella was on duty with  Augusta, occupied with household tasks that seemed to involve strenuous  attacks on cupboards, and perpetual visits to the kitchen, whence came  hot, sweet whiffs of jam-making. Colonel Crayfield wandered aimlessly  in the garden, consoling himself with plans for the immediate future.  The marriage must take place as soon as possible--he supposed it would  have to be in the village church--but a special licence would expedite  matters. In little more than a couple of months his leave would be  up--it would allow only just time for Stella to have riding lessons,  singing lessons, to collect the right sort of outfit, for which, of  course, he would be responsible. No village dressmaker, no ready-made  garments for _his_ wife. His own particular star should shine in every  detail.    At last; there was the old lady, alone on the terrace, settled in a big  basket chair, a mushroom-shaped hat tied on with a broad ribbon, her  ebony stick handy, a small table at her side on which lay spectacles, a  handkerchief, and the paper which arrived at midday. Colonel Crayfield  approached her; formal greetings were exchanged, then he took an  uncomfortable little garden chair from its resting-place against the  wall and applied himself to business.    \"Now,\" he said briskly, \"I am ready to tell you what I propose should be  done about Stella.\"    Mrs. Carrington pouched her cheeks, and intimated silently that she also  was ready--to listen. He trusted she would not have a stroke when she  heard what he was about to propose!    \"It may seem a very sudden decision on my part, Mrs. Carrington,\" he  began; \"but I wish to take Stella into my own keeping----\"    At once Mrs. Carrington was all gracious acquiescence. (Ellen! He had  spoken to Ellen?)    \"Perhaps I can guess the means by which you intend to bring about such  an excellent solution of our difficulties,\" she remarked, with an arch  expression that struck him as grotesque; and before he could continue,  she added: \"I may tell you that I had my suspicions ten years ago!\"  (Good heavens! What could she mean?) \"I may also say that in my opinion  nothing could be more suitable.\"    \"I am afraid we are at cross purposes,\" said Colonel Crayfield  carefully. From his own standpoint he felt that the marriage could  hardly be termed \"suitable,\" though the gain for the girl was  undeniable.    \"Then will you kindly explain?\" demanded Mrs. Carrington.    \"Certainly. It is my intention to marry your granddaughter.\"    Grandmamma stared at him. Then she grabbed her stick and struck it  sharply on the ground. \"My good man, are you in your senses?\" she cried.  \"Do you realise that Stella is not only a child, but that she has bad  blood in her veins? That such an unnatural union could only result in  disaster? Now, if it had been Ellen, her aunt----\"    The old lady's natural reserve had been blown, as by a volcano, sky  high.    So that was the idea! Colonel Crayfield only just saved himself from  laughing aloud.    \"But you see,\" he said lightly, \"it is not Miss Ellen--fortunately for  me, since I fear she would hardly welcome me as a suitor.\"    Mrs. Carrington ignored this playful attitude. \"It is a preposterous  idea! You are not a young man. Have you considered the cost and the  risk?\" Her voice was severe.    \"Why,\" he argued judicially, \"should there be any 'risk,' as you"]]]
