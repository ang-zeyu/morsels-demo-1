The Somal,  Spaniard-like, remark, \"He is one of ourselves, though a little richer;\"  but when times change and luck returns, they are not unlikely to find  themselves mistaken.    Amongst other visitors, we have the Amir el Bahr, or Port Captain, and the  Nakib el Askar (_Commandant de place_), Mohammed Umar el Hamumi. This is  one of those Hazramaut adventurers so common in all the countries  bordering upon Arabia: they are the Swiss of the East, a people equally  brave and hardy, frugal and faithful, as long as pay is regular. Feared by  the soft Indians and Africans for their hardness and determination, the  common proverb concerning them is, \"If you meet a viper and a Hazrami,  spare the viper.\" Natives of a poor and rugged region, they wander far and  wide, preferring every country to their own; and it is generally said that  the sun rises not upon a land that does not contain a man from Hazramaut.  [8] This commander of an army of forty men [9] often read out to us from  the Kitab el Anwar (the Book of Lights) the tale of Abu Jahl, that Judas  of El Islam made ridiculous. Sometimes comes the Sayyid Mohammed el Barr,  a stout personage, formerly governor of Zayla, and still highly respected  by the people on acount of his pure pedigree. With him is the Fakih Adan,  a savan of ignoble origin. [10] When they appear the conversation becomes  intensely intellectual; sometimes we dispute religion, sometimes politics,  at others history and other humanities. Yet it is not easy to talk history  with a people who confound Miriam and Mary, or politics to those whose  only idea of a king is a robber on a large scale, or religion to men who  measure excellence by forbidden meats, or geography to those who represent  the earth in this guise. Yet, though few of our ideas are in common, there  are many words; the verbosity of these anti-Laconic oriental dialects [11]  renders at least half the subject intelligible to the most opposite  thinkers. When the society is wholly Somal, I write Arabic, copy some  useful book, or extract from it, as Bentley advised, what is fit to quote.  When Arabs are present, I usually read out a tale from \"The Thousand and  One Nights,\" that wonderful work, so often translated, so much turned  over, and so little understood at home. The most familiar of books in  England, next to the Bible, it is one of the least known, the reason being  that about one fifth is utterly unfit for translation; and the most  sanguine orientalist would not dare to render literally more than three  quarters of the remainder. Consequently, the reader loses the contrast,--  the very essence of the book,--between its brilliancy and dulness, its  moral putrefaction, and such pearls as      \"Cast the seed of good works on the least fit soil.    Good is never wasted, however it may be laid out.\"    And in a page or two after such divine sentiment, the ladies of Bagdad sit  in the porter's lap, and indulge in a facetiousness which would have  killed Pietro Aretino before his time.    [Illustration]    Often I am visited by the Topchi-Bashi, or master of the ordnance,--half a  dozen honeycombed guns,--a wild fellow, Bashi Buzuk in the Hejaz and  commandant of artillery at Zayla. He shaves my head on Fridays, and on  other days tells me wild stories about his service in the Holy Land; how  Kurdi Usman slew his son-in-law, Ibn Rumi, and how Turkcheh Bilmez would  have murdered Mohammed Ali in his bed. [12] Sometimes the room is filled  with Arabs, Sayyids, merchants, and others settled in the place: I saw  nothing amongst them to justify the oft-quoted saw, \"Koraysh pride and  Zayla's boastfulness.\" More generally the assembly is one of the Somal,  who talk in their own tongue, laugh, yell, stretch their legs, and lie  like cattle upon the floor, smoking the common Hukkah, which stands in the  centre, industriously cleaning their teeth with sticks, and eating snuff  like Swedes. Meanwhile, I occupy the Kursi or couch, sometimes muttering  from a book to excite respect, or reading aloud for general information,  or telling fortunes by palmistry, or drawing out a horoscope.    It argues \"peculiarity,\" I own, to enjoy such a life. In the first place,  there is no woman's society: El Islam seems purposely to have loosened the  ties between the sexes in order to strengthen the bonds which connect man  and man. [13] Secondly, your house is by no means your castle. You must  open your doors to your friend at all hours; if when inside it suit him to  sing, sing he will; and until you learn solitude in a crowd, or the art of  concentration, you are apt to become _ennuye_ and irritable. You must  abandon your prejudices, and for a time cast off all European  prepossessions in favour of Indian politeness, Persian polish, Arab  courtesy, or Turkish dignity.      \"They are as free as Nature e'er made man;\"    and he who objects to having his head shaved in public, to seeing his  friends combing their locks in his sitting-room, to having his property  unceremoniously handled, or to being addressed familiarly by a perfect  stranger, had better avoid Somaliland.    You will doubtless, dear L., convict me, by my own sentiments, of being an  \"amateur barbarian.\" You must, however, remember that I visited Africa  fresh from Aden, with its dull routine of meaningless parades and tiresome  courts martial, where society is broken by ridiculous distinctions of  staff-men and regimental-men, Madras-men and Bombay-men, \"European\"  officers, and \"black\" officers; where literature is confined to acquiring  the art of explaining yourself in the jargons of half-naked savages; where  the business of life is comprised in ignoble official squabbles, dislikes,  disapprobations, and \"references to superior authority;\" where social  intercourse is crushed by \"gup,\" gossip, and the scandal of small colonial  circles; where--pleasant predicament for those who really love women's  society!--it is scarcely possible to address fair dame, preserving at the  same time her reputation and your own, and if seen with her twice, all  \"camp\" will swear it is an \"affair;\" where, briefly, the march of mind is  at a dead halt, and the march of matter is in double quick time to the  hospital or sick-quarters. Then the fatal struggle for Name, and the  painful necessity of doing the most with the smallest materials for a  reputation! In Europe there are a thousand grades of celebrity, from  statesmanship to taxidermy; all, therefore, co-exist without rivalry.  Whereas, in these small colonies, there is but one fame, and as that leads  directly to rupees and rank, no man willingly accords it to his neighbour.  And, finally, such semi-civilised life abounds in a weary ceremoniousness.  It is highly improper to smoke outside your bungalow. You shall pay your  visits at 11 A.M., when the glass stands at 120 deg. You shall be generally  shunned if you omit your waistcoat, no matter what the weather be. And if  you venture to object to these Median laws,--as I am now doing,--you  elicit a chorus of disapproval, and acquire some evil name.    About 11 A.M., when the fresh water arrives from the Hissi or wells, the  Hajj sends us dinner, mutton stews, of exceeding greasiness, boiled rice,  maize cakes, sometimes fish, and generally curds or milk. We all sit round  a primitive form of the Round Table, and I doubt that King Arthur's  knights ever proved doughtier trenchermen than do my companions. We then  rise to pipes and coffee, after which, excluding visitors, my attendants  apply themselves to a siesta, I to my journal and studies.    At 2 P.M. there is a loud clamour at the door: if it be not opened in  time, we are asked if we have a Nazarene inside. Enters a crowd of  visitors, anxious to pass the afternoon. We proceed with a copy of the  forenoon till the sun declines, when it is time to escape the flies, to  repair to the terrace for fresh air, or to dress for a walk. Generally our  direction is through the town eastwards, to a plain of dilapidated graves  and salt sand, peopled only by land-crabs. At the extremity near the sea  is a little mosque of wattle-work: we sit there under the shade, and play  a rude form of draughts, called Shantarah, or at Shahh, a modification of  the former. [14] More often, eschewing these effeminacies, we shoot at a  mark, throw the javelin, leap, or engage in some gymnastic exercise. The  favourite Somali weapons are the spear, dagger, and war-club; the bow and  poisoned arrows are peculiar to the servile class, who know              \"the dreadful art    To taint with deadly drugs the barbed dart;\"    and the people despise, at the same time that they fear firearms,  declaring them to be cowardly weapons [15] with which the poltroon can  slay the bravest.    The Somali spear is a form of the Cape Assegai. A long, thin, pliant and  knotty shaft of the Dibi, Diktab, and Makari trees, is dried, polished,  and greased with rancid butter: it is generally of a dull yellow colour,  and sometimes bound, as in Arabia, with brass wire for ornament. Care is  applied to make the rod straight, or the missile flies crooked: it is  garnished with an iron button at the head, and a long thin tapering head  of coarse bad iron [16], made at Berberah and other places by the Tomal.  The length of the shaft may be four feet eight inches; the blade varies  from twenty to twenty-six inches, and the whole weapon is about seven feet  long. Some polish the entire spear-head, others only its socket or ferule;  commonly, however, it is all blackened by heating it to redness, and  rubbing it with cow's horn. In the towns, one of these weapons is carried;  on a journey and in battle two, as amongst the Tibboos,--a small javelin  for throwing and a large spear reserved for the thrust.

Each one knows very well that neither admits  any high moral reasons for not betraying the other, since in their  mutual relations they fail in the requirements of morality, and from  that time distrust and watch each other.    \"Oh, what a frightful feeling of jealousy! I do not speak of that real  jealousy which has foundations (it is tormenting, but it promises an  issue), but of that unconscious jealousy which inevitably accompanies  every immoral marriage, and which, having no cause, has no end. This  jealousy is frightful. Frightful, that is the word.    \"And this is it. A young man speaks to my wife. He looks at her with a  smile, and, as it seems to me, he surveys her body. How does he dare to  think of her, to think of the possibility of a romance with her? And how  can she, seeing this, tolerate him? Not only does she tolerate him, but  she seems pleased. I even see that she puts herself to trouble on his  account. And in my soul there rises such a hatred for her that each of  her words, each gesture, disgusts me. She notices it, she knows not what  to do, and how assume an air of indifferent animation? Ah! I suffer!  That makes her gay, she is content. And my hatred increases tenfold, but  I do not dare to give it free force, because at the bottom of my soul  I know that there are no real reasons for it, and I remain in my seat,  feigning indifference, and exaggerating my attention and courtesy to  HIM.    \"Then I get angry with myself. I desire to leave the room, to leave them  alone, and I do, in fact, go out; but scarcely am I outside when I am  invaded by a fear of what is taking place within my absence. I go in  again, inventing some pretext. Or sometimes I do not go in; I remain  near the door, and listen. How can she humiliate herself and humiliate  me by placing me in this cowardly situation of suspicion and espionage?  Oh, abomination! Oh, the wicked animal! And he too, what does he think  of you? But he is like all men. He is what I was before my marriage. It  gives him pleasure. He even smiles when he looks at me, as much as to  say: 'What have you to do with this? It is my turn now.'    \"This feeling is horrible. Its burn is unendurable. To entertain this  feeling toward any one, to once suspect a man of lusting after my wife,  was enough to spoil this man forever in my eyes, as if he had been  sprinkled with vitriol. Let me once become jealous of a being, and  nevermore could I re-establish with him simple human relations, and my  eyes flashed when I looked at him.    \"As for my wife, so many times had I enveloped her with this moral  vitriol, with this jealous hatred, that she was degraded thereby. In the  periods of this causeless hatred I gradually uncrowned her. I covered  her with shame in my imagination.    \"I invented impossible knaveries. I suspected, I am ashamed to say, that  she, this queen of 'The Thousand and One Nights,' deceived me with my  serf, under my very eyes, and laughing at me.    \"Thus, with each new access of jealousy (I speak always of causeless  jealousy), I entered into the furrow dug formerly by my filthy  suspicions, and I continually deepened it. She did the same thing. If  I have reasons to be jealous, she who knew my past had a thousand times  more. And she was more ill-natured in her jealousy than I. And the  sufferings that I felt from her jealousy were different, and likewise  very painful.    \"The situation may be described thus. We are living more or less  tranquilly. I am even gay and contented. Suddenly we start a  conversation on some most commonplace subject, and directly she finds  herself disagreeing with me upon matters concerning which we have been  generally in accord. And furthermore I see that, without any necessity  therefor, she is becoming irritated. I think that she has a nervous  attack, or else that the subject of conversation is really disagreeable  to her. We talk of something else, and that begins again. Again she  torments me, and becomes irritated. I am astonished and look for a  reason. Why? For what? She keeps silence, answers me with monosyllables,  evidently making allusions to something. I begin to divine that the  reason of all this is that I have taken a few walks in the garden with  her cousin, to whom I did not give even a thought. I begin to  divine, but I cannot say so. If I say so, I confirm her suspicions. I  interrogate her, I question her. She does not answer, but she sees that  I understand, and that confirms her suspicions.    \"'What is the matter with you?' I ask.    \"'Nothing, I am as well as usual,' she answers.    \"And at the same time, like a crazy woman, she gives utterance to the  silliest remarks, to the most inexplicable explosions of spite.    \"Sometimes I am patient, but at other times I break out with anger. Then  her own irritation is launched forth in a flood of insults, in charges  of imaginary crimes and all carried to the highest degree by sobs,  tears, and retreats through the house to the most improbable spots. I  go to look for her. I am ashamed before people, before the children, but  there is nothing to be done. She is in a condition where I feel that she  is ready for anything. I run, and finally find her. Nights of torture  follow, in which both of us, with exhausted nerves, appease each other,  after the most cruel words and accusations.    \"Yes, jealousy, causeless jealousy, is the condition of our debauched  conjugal life. And throughout my marriage never did I cease to feel it  and to suffer from it. There were two periods in which I suffered most  intensely. The first time was after the birth of our first child,  when the doctors had forbidden my wife to nurse it. I was particularly  jealous, in the first place, because my wife felt that restlessness  peculiar to animal matter when the regular course of life is interrupted  without occasion. But especially was I jealous because, having seen  with what facility she had thrown off her moral duties as a mother, I  concluded rightly, though unconsciously, that she would throw off as  easily her conjugal duties, feeling all the surer of this because she  was in perfect health, as was shown by the fact that, in spite of the  prohibition of the dear doctors, she nursed her following children, and  even very well.\"    \"I see that you have no love for the doctors,\" said I, having noticed  Posdnicheff's extraordinarily spiteful expression of face and tone of  voice whenever he spoke of them.    \"It is not a question of loving them or of not loving them. They have  ruined my life, as they have ruined the lives of thousands of beings  before me, and I cannot help connecting the consequence with the cause.  I conceive that they desire, like the lawyers and the rest, to make  money. I would willingly have given them half of my income--and any one  would have done it in my place, understanding what they do--if they had  consented not to meddle in my conjugal life, and to keep themselves at a  distance. I have compiled no statistics, but I know scores of cases--in  reality, they are innumerable--where they have killed, now a child in  its mother's womb, asserting positively that the mother could not give  birth to it (when the mother could give birth to it very well), now  mothers, under the pretext of a so-called operation. No one has counted  these murders, just as no one counted the murders of the Inquisition,  because it was supposed that they were committed for the benefit of  humanity. Innumerable are the crimes of the doctors! But all these  crimes are nothing compared with the materialistic demoralization which  they introduce into the world through women. I say nothing of the fact  that, if it were to follow their advice,--thanks to the microbe which  they see everywhere,--humanity, instead of tending to union, would  proceed straight to complete disunion. Everybody, according to their  doctrine, should isolate himself, and never remove from his mouth a  syringe filled with phenic acid (moreover, they have found out now that  it does no good). But I would pass over all these things. The supreme  poison is the perversion of people, especially of women. One can no  longer say now: 'You live badly, live better.' One can no longer say  it either to himself or to others, for, if you live badly (say the  doctors), the cause is in the nervous system or in something similar,  and it is necessary to go to consult them, and they will prescribe  for you thirty-five copecks' worth of remedies to be bought at the  drug-store, and you must swallow them. Your condition grows worse? Again  to the doctors, and more remedies! An excellent business!    \"But to return to our subject. I was saying that my wife nursed her  children well, that the nursing and the gestation of the children, and  the children in general, quieted my tortures of jealousy, but that, on  the other hand, they provoked torments of a different sort.\"        CHAPTER XVI.    \"The children came rapidly, one after another, and there happened  what happens in our society with children and doctors. Yes, children,  maternal love, it is a painful thing. Children, to a woman of our  society, are not a joy, a pride, nor a fulfilment of her vocation, but  a cause of fear, anxiety, and interminable suffering, torture. Women say  it, they think it, and they feel it too. Children to them are really a  torture, not because they do not wish to give birth to them, nurse them,  and care for them (women with a strong maternal instinct--and such was  my wife--are ready to do that), but because the children may fall sick  and die. They do not wish to give birth to them, and then not love them;  and when they love, they do not wish to feel fear for the child's health  and life. That is why they do not wish to nurse them."]]]
