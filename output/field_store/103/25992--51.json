With the assistance of some handsomely gowned women he opened a  cafe on the Rue Royal where they could. For years it was patronized by  his countrymen until they were ruined. Later only royalty and tourists  were permitted to enter and form a mistaken idea of the real French  cafe, pay double prices for everything, see a few chorus girls, hear  champagne bottles, and talk to English-speaking waiters. Ambition:  Americans. Recreation: Staying at home. Press Agent: The Merry Widow and  the Girl from Maxims. Epitaph: Honi Soit Qui Mal y Pense.

When M. waxed astute, after the  manner of his people, he discovered there were not sufficient shekels  for himself and countrymen in the land of Egypt. He pleaded and plagued  the king for permission to close the pawn shops and clothing stores. Now  in those days the children of Egypt were wont to patronize the bazaars  of the children of the Chosen, and Pharaoh was wroth within himself and  refused the passports. The brave rabbi closed the kosher meat stores and  took ship's leave. Adopting an original compass, he made forced marches  to the Red Sea. Here the synagogue was overtaken by Pharaoh and his  army. M. spilled the sea on them and marched on. From this time the  journey to the Promised Land was slow. Whether this was due to good  business or sore feet history does not relate.

Epitaph: Here Lies A Napoleon,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9845"],[0,"The Spy (#9)"],[1,", the peddler  relieved himself from his burden, which, as it stood on the floor,  reached nearly to his shoulders, and saluted the family with modest  civility. To Harper he made a silent bow, without lifting his eyes from  the carpet; but the curtain prevented any notice of the presence of  Captain Wharton. Sarah gave but little time for the usual salutations,  before she commenced her survey of the contents of the pack; and, for  several minutes, the two were engaged in bringing to light the various  articles it contained. The tables, chairs, and floor were soon covered  with silks, crapes, gloves, muslins, and all the stock of an itinerant  trader. Caesar was employed to hold open the mouth of the pack, as its  hoards were discharged, and occasionally he aided his young lady, by  directing her admiration to some article of finery, which, from its  deeper contrast in colors, he thought more worthy of her notice. At  length, Sarah, having selected several articles, and satisfactorily  arranged the prices, observed in a cheerful voice,--    \"But, Harvey, you have told us no news. Has Lord Cornwallis beaten the  rebels again?\"    The question could not have been heard; for the peddler, burying his  body in the pack, brought forth a quantity of lace of exquisite  fineness, and, holding it up to view, he required the admiration of the  young lady. Miss Peyton dropped the cup she was engaged in washing, from  her hand; and Frances exhibited the whole of that lovely face, which had  hitherto only suffered one of its joyous eyes to be seen, beaming with a  color that shamed the damask which enviously concealed her figure.    The aunt quitted her employment; and Birch soon disposed of a large  portion of his valuable article. The praises of the ladies had drawn the  whole person of the younger sister into view; and Frances was slowly  rising from the window, as Sarah repeated her question, with an  exultation in her voice, that proceeded more from pleasure in her  purchase, than her political feelings. The younger sister resumed her  seat, apparently examining the state of the clouds, while the peddler,  finding a reply was expected, answered,--    \"There is some talk, below, about Tarleton having defeated General  Sumter, on the Tiger River.\"    Captain Wharton now involuntarily thrust his head between the opening of  the curtains into the room; and Frances, turning her ear in breathless  silence, noticed the quiet eyes of Harper looking at the peddler, over  the book he was affecting to read, with an expression that denoted him  to be a listener of no ordinary interest.    \"Indeed!\" cried the exulting Sarah; \"Sumter--Sumter--who is he? I'll  not buy even a pin, until you tell me all the news,\" she continued,  laughing and throwing down a muslin she had been examining.    For a moment the peddler hesitated; his eye glanced towards Harper, who  was yet gazing at him with settled meaning, and the whole manner of  Birch was altered. Approaching the fire, he took from his mouth a large  allowance of the Virginian weed, and depositing it, with the  superabundance of its juices, without mercy to Miss Peyton's shining  andirons, he returned to his goods.    \"He lives somewhere among the niggers to the south,\" answered the  peddler, abruptly.    \"No more nigger than be yourself, Mister Birch,\" interrupted Caesar  tartly, dropping at the same time the covering of the goods in high  displeasure.    \"Hush, Caesar--hush; never mind it now,\" said Sarah Wharton soothingly,  impatient to hear further.    \"A black man so good as white, Miss Sally,\" continued the offended  negro, \"so long as he behave heself.\"    \"And frequently he is much better,\" rejoined his mistress. \"But, Harvey,  who is this Mr. Sumter?\"    A slight indication of humor showed itself on the face of the peddler,  but it disappeared, and he continued as if the discourse had met with no  interruption from the sensitiveness of the domestic.    \"As I was saying, he lives among the colored people in the  south\"--Caesar resumed his occupation--\"and he has lately had a  scrimmage with this Colonel Tarleton--\"    \"Who defeated him, of course?\" cried Sarah, with confidence.    \"So say the troops at Morrisania.\"    \"But what do you say?\" Mr. Wharton ventured to inquire, yet speaking in  a low tone.    \"I repeat but what I hear,\" said Birch, offering a piece of cloth to the  inspection of Sarah, who rejected it in silence, evidently determined to  hear more before she made another purchase.    \"They say, however, at the Plains,\" the peddler continued, first  throwing his eyes again around the room, and letting them rest for an  instant on Harper, \"that Sumter and one or two more were all that were  hurt, and that the rig'lars were all cut to pieces, for the militia were  fixed snugly in a log barn.\"    \"Not very probable,\" said Sarah, contemptuously, \"though I make no doubt  the rebels got behind the logs.\"    \"I think,\" said the peddler coolly, again offering the silk, \"it's quite  ingenious to get a log between one and a gun, instead of getting between  a gun and a log.\"    The eyes of Harper dropped quietly on the pages of the volume in his  hand, while Frances, rising, came forward with a smile in her face, as  she inquired, in a tone of affability that the peddler had never  witnessed from her,--    \"Have you more of the lace, Mr. Birch?\"    The desired article was immediately produced, and Frances became a  purchaser also. By her order a glass of liquor was offered to the  trader, who took it with thanks, and having paid his compliments to the  master of the house and the ladies, drank the beverage.    \"So, it is thought that Colonel Tarleton has worsted General Sumter?\"  said Mr. Wharton, affecting to be employed in mending the cup that was  broken by the eagerness of his sister-in-law.    \"I believe they think so at Morrisania,\" said Birch, dryly.    \"Have you any other news, friend?\" asked Captain Wharton, venturing to  thrust his face without the curtains.    \"Have you heard that Major Andre has been hanged?\"    Captain Wharton started, and for a moment glances of great significance  were exchanged between him and the trader, when he observed, with  affected indifference, \"That must have been some weeks ago.\"    \"Does his execution make much noise?\" asked the father, striving to make  the broken china unite.    \"People will talk, you know, 'squire.\"    \"Is there any probability of movements below, my friend, that will make  traveling dangerous?\" asked Harper, looking steadily at the other, in  expectation of his reply.    Some bunches of ribbons fell from the hands of Birch; his countenance  changed instantly, losing its keen expression in intent meaning, as he  answered slowly, \"It is some time since the rig'lar cavalry were out,  and I saw some of De Lancey's men cleaning their arms, as I passed their  quarters; it would be no wonder if they took the scent soon, for the  Virginia horse are low in the county.\"    \"Are they in much force?\" asked Mr. Wharton, suspending all employment  in anxiety.    \"I did not count them.\"    Frances was the only observer of the change in the manner of Birch, and,  on turning to Harper, he had resumed his book in silence. She took some  of the ribbons in her hand--laid them down again--and, bending over the  goods, so that her hair, falling in rich curls, shaded her face, she  observed, blushing with a color that suffused her neck,--    \"I thought the Southern horse had marched towards the Delaware.\"    \"It may be so,\" said Birch; \"I passed the troops at a distance.\"    Caesar had now selected a piece of calico, in which the gaudy colors of  yellow and red were contrasted on a white ground, and, after admiring it  for several minutes, he laid it down with a sigh, as he exclaimed,  \"Berry pretty calico.\"    \"That,\" said Sarah; \"yes, that would make a proper gown for your wife,  Caesar.\"    \"Yes, Miss Sally,\" cried the delighted black, \"it make old Dinah heart  leap for joy--so berry genteel.\"    \"Yes,\" added the peddler, quaintly, \"that is only wanting to make Dinah  look like a rainbow.\"    Caesar eyed his young mistress eagerly, until she inquired of Harvey the  price of the article.    \"Why, much as I light of chaps,\" said the peddler.    \"How much?\" demanded Sarah in surprise.    \"According to my luck in finding purchasers; for my friend Dinah, you  may have it at four shillings.\"    \"It is too much,\" said Sarah, turning to some goods for herself.    \"Monstrous price for coarse calico, Mister Birch,\" grumbled Caesar,  dropping the opening of the pack again.    \"We will say three, then,\" added the peddler, \"if you like that better.\"    \"Be sure he like 'em better,\" said Caesar, smiling good-humoredly, and  reopening the pack; \"Miss Sally like a t'ree shilling when she give, and  a four shilling when she take.\"    The bargain was immediately concluded; but in measuring, the cloth  wanted a little of the well-known ten yards required by the dimensions  of Dinah. By dint of a strong arm, however, it grew to the desired  length, under the experienced eye of the peddler, who conscientiously  added a ribbon of corresponding brilliancy with the calico; and Caesar  hastily withdrew, to communicate the joyful intelligence to his  aged partner.    During the movements created by the conclusion of the purchase, Captain  Wharton had ventured to draw aside the curtain, so as to admit a view of  his person, and he now inquired of the peddler, who had begun to  collect the scattered goods, at what time he had left the city.    \"At early twilight,\" was the answer.    \"So lately!\" cried the other in surprise: then correcting his manner, by  assuming a more guarded air, he continued, \"Could you pass the pickets  at so late an hour?\"    \"I did,\" was the laconic reply.    \"You must be well known by this time, Harvey, to the officers of the  British army,\" cried Sarah, smiling knowingly on the peddler.    \"I know some of them by sight,\" said"]]]
