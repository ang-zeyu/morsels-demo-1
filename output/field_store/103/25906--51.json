I am surprised to find the Indian words [of one of the  different Carib dialects?] Ezrabeta cassipuna aquerewana, translated  by Raleigh, the great princes or greatest commander. Since acarwana  certainly signifies a chief, or any person who commands (Raleigh pages  6 and 7), cassipuna perhaps means great, and lake Cassipa is  synonymous with great lake. In the same manner Cass-iquiare may be a  great river, for iquiare, like veni, is, an the north of the Amazon, a  termination common to all rivers. Goto, however, in Cassipa-goto, is a  Caribbee term denoting a tribe.) Raleigh gives this basin forty miles  in breadth; and, as all the lakes of Parima must have auriferous  sands, he does not fail to assert that in summer, when the waters  retire, pieces of gold of considerable weight are found there.    The sources of the tributary streams of the Carony, the Arui, and the  Caura (Caroli, Arvi, and Caora,* of the ancient geographers (*  D'Anville names the Rio Caura, Coari; and the Rio Arui, Aroay. I have  not been able hitherto to guess what is meant by the Aloica (Atoca,  Atoica of Raleigh), which issues from the lake Cassipa, between the  Caura and the Arui.)) being very near each other, this suggested the  idea of making all these rivers take their rise from the pretended  lake Cassipa.* (* Raleigh makes only the Carony and the Arui issue  from it (Hondius, Nieuwe Caerte van het wonderbare landt Guiana,  besocht door Sir Walter Raleigh, 1594 to 1596): but in later maps, for  instance that of Sanson, the Rio Caura issues also from Lake Cassipa.)  Sanson has so much enlarged this lake, that he gives it forty-two  leagues in length, and fifteen in breadth. The ancient geographers  placed opposite to each other, with very little hesitation, the  tributary streams of the two banks of a river; and they place the  mouth of the Carony, and lake Cassipa, which communicates by the  Carony with the Orinoco, sometimes* ABOVE the confluence of the Meta.  (* Sanson, Map for the Voyage of Acunha, 1680. Id. South America,  1659. Coronelli, Indes occidentales, 1689.) Thus it is carried back by  Hondius as far as the latitudes of 2 and 3 degrees, giving it the form  of a rectangle, the longest sides of which run from north to south.  This circumstance is worthy of remark, because, in assigning gradually  a more southern latitude to lake Cassipa, it has been detached from  the Carony and the Arui, and has taken the name of Parima. To follow  this metamorphosis in its progressive development, we must compare the  maps which have appeared since the voyage of Raleigh till now. La  Cruz, who has been copied by all the modern geographers, has preserved  the oblong form of the lake Cassipa for his lake Parima, although this  form is entirely different from that of the ancient lake Parima, or  Rupunuwini, of which the great axis was directed from east to west.  The ancient lake (that of Hondius, Sanson, and Coronelli) was also  surrounded by mountains, and gave birth to no river; while the lake  Parima of La Cruz and the modern geographers communicates with the  Upper Orinoco, as the Cassipa with the Lower Orinoco.    I have stated the origin of the fable of the lake Cassipa, and the  influence it has had on the opinion that the lake Parima is the source  of the Orinoco. Let us now examine what relates to this latter basin,  this pretended interior sea, called Rupunuwini by the geographers of  the sixteenth century. In the latitude of four degrees or four degrees  and a half (in which direction unfortunately, south of Santo Thome del  Angostura to the extent of eight degrees, no astronomical observation  has been made) is a long and narrow Cordillera, that of Pacaraimo,  Quimiropaca, and Ucucuamo; which, stretching from east to south-west,  unites the group of mountains of Parima to the mountains of Dutch and  French Guiana. It divides its waters between the Carony, the Rupunury  or Rupunuwini, and the Rio Branco, and consequently between the  valleys of the Lower Orinoco, the Essequibo, and the Rio Negro. On the  north-west of the Cordillera de Pacaraimo, which has been traversed  but by a small number of Europeans (by the German surgeon, Nicolas  Hortsmann, in 1739; by a Spanish officer, Don Antonio Santos, in 1775;  by the Portuguese colonel, Barata, in 1791; and by several English  settlers, in 1811), descend the Noeapra, the Paraguamusi, and the  Paragua, which fall into the Rio Carony; on the north-east, the  Rupunuwini, a tributary stream of the Rio Essequibo. Toward the south,  the Tacutu and the Urariquera form together the famous Rio Parima, or  Rio Branco.    This isthmus, between the branches of the Rio Essequibo and the Rio  Branco (that is, between the Rupunuwini on one side, and the Pirara,  the Mahu, and the Uraricuera or Rio Parima on the other), may be  considered as the classical soil of the Dorado of Parima. The rivers  at the foot of the mountains of Pacaraimo are subject to frequent  overflowings. Above Santa Rosa, the right bank of the Urariapara, a  tributary stream of the Uraricuera, is called el Valle de la  Inundacion. Great pools are also found between the Rio Parima and the  Xurumu. These are marked on the maps recently constructed in Brazil,  which furnish the most ample details of those countries. More to the  west, the Cano Pirara, a tributary stream of the Mahu, issues from a  lake covered with rushes. This is the lake Amucu described by Nicolas  Hortsmann, and respecting which some Portuguese of Barcelos, who had  visited the Rio Branco (Rio Parima or Rio Paravigiana), gave me  precise notions during my stay at San Carlos del Rio Negro. The lake  Amucu is several leagues broad, and contains two small islands, which  Santos heard called Islas Ipomucena. The Rupunuwini (Rupunury), on the  banks of which Hortsmann discovered rocks covered with hieroglyphical  figures, approaches very near this lake, but does not communicate with  it. The portage between the Rupunuwini and the Mahu is farther north,  where the mountain of Ucucuamo* rises, the natives still call the  mountain of gold. (* I follow the orthography of the manuscript  journal of Rodriguez; it is the Cerro Acuquamo of Caulin, or rather of  his commentator. Hist. corogr. page 176.) They advised Hortsmann to  seek round the Rio Mahu for a mine of silver (no doubt mica with large  plates), of diamonds, and emeralds. He found nothing but rocky  crystals. His account seems to prove that the whole length of the  mountains of the Upper Orinoco (Sierra Parima) toward the east, is  composed of granitic rocks, full of druses and open veins, the Peak of  Duida. Near these lands, which still enjoy a great celebrity for their  riches, on the western limits of Dutch Guiana, live the Macusis,  Aturajos, and Acuvajos. The traveller Santos found them stationed  between the Rupunuwini, the Mahu, and the chain of Pacaraimo. It is  the appearance of the micaceous rocks of the Ucucuamo, the name of the  Rio Parima, the inundations of the rivers Urariapara, Parima, and  Xurumu, and more especially the existence of the lake Amucu (near the  Rio Rupunuwini, and regarded as the principal source of the Rio  Parima), which have given rise to the fable of the White Sea and the  Dorado of Parima. All these circumstances (which have served on this  very account to corroborate the general opinion) are found united on a  space of ground which is eight or nine leagues broad from north to  south, and forty long from east to west. This direction, too, was  always assigned to the White Sea, by lengthening it in the direction  of the latitude, till the beginning of the sixteenth century. Now this  White Sea is nothing but the Rio Parima, which is called the White  River (Rio Branco, or Rio del Aguas blancas), and runs through and  inundates the whole of this land. The name of Rupunuwini is given to  the White Sea on the most ancient maps, which identifies the place of  the fable, since of all the tributary streams of the Rio Essequibo the  Rupunuwini is the nearest to the lake Amucu. Raleigh, in his first  voyage (1595), had formed no precise idea of the situation of El  Dorado and the lake Parima, which he believed to be salt, and which he  calls another Caspian Sea. It was not till the second voyage (1596),  performed equally at the expense of Raleigh, that Laurence Keymis  fixed so well the localities of El Dorado, that he appears to me to  have no doubt of the identity of the Parima de Manao with the lake  Amucu, and with the isthmus between the Rupunuwini (a tributary stream  of the Essequibo) and the Rio Parima or Rio Branco. \"The Indians,\"  says Keymis, \"go up the Dessekebe [Essequibo] in twenty days, towards  the south. To mark the greatness of this river, they call it the  brother of the Orinoco. After twenty days' navigating they convey  their canoes by a portage of one day, from the river Dessekebe to a  lake, which the Jaos call Roponowini, and the Caribbees Parime. This  lake is as large as a sea; it is covered with an infinite number of  canoes; and I suppose\" [the Indians then had told him nothing of this]  \"that this lake is no other than that which contains the town of  Manoa.\"* (* Cayley's Life of Raleigh volume 1 pages 159, 236 and 283.  Masham in the third voyage of Raleigh (1596) repeats these accounts of  the Lake Rupunuwini.) Hondius has given a curious plate of this  portage; and, as the mouth of the Carony was then supposed to be in  latitude 4 degrees (instead of 8 degrees 8 minutes), the portage of  Parima was placed close to the equator. At the same period the Viapoco  (Oyapoc) and the Rio Cayenne (Maroni?) were made to issue from this  lake Parima. The same name being given by the Caribs to the western  branch of the Rio Branco has perhaps contributed as much to the  imaginary enlargement of the lake Amucu, as the inundations of"]]]
