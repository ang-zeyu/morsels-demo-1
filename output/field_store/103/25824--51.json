[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53526"],[0,"Cardinal Wolsey (#9)"],[1,"\"in fine green  satin, all over covered with cloth of gold, undertied together with  laces of gold.\" They danced for some time and then removed their masks,  and the evening passed in mirth. Such were the festivities of the  English Court, which Shakespeare has reproduced, accurately enough, in  his play of _Henry VIII._    But these Court festivities were only preliminary to the public  ceremonies whereby Wolsey impressed the imagination of the people. The  proclamation of the treaty and the marriage of the Princess Mary by  proxy were both the occasions of splendid ceremonies in St. Paul's  Cathedral. The people were delighted by pageantry and good cheer; the  opposition of old-fashioned politicians was overborne in the prevailing  enthusiasm; and men spoke only of the triumph of a pacific policy which  had achieved results such as warfare could not have won. Indeed, the  advantages which England obtained were substantial. France bought back  Tournai for 600,000 crowns, and entered into a close alliance with  England, which cut it off from interference in the affairs of Scotland,  which was included in the peace so long as it abstained from  hostilities. But more important than this was the fact that Wolsey  insisted on the alliance between France and England being made the basis  of a universal peace. The Pope, the Emperor, the King of Spain, were all  invited to join, and all complied with the invitation.    None of them, however, complied with goodwill, least of all Pope Leo X.,  whose claim to be the official pacifier of Europe was rudely set aside  by the audacious action of Wolsey. Leo hoped that the bestowal of a  cardinal's hat had established a hold on Wolsey's gratitude; but he soon  found that he was mistaken, and that his cunning was no match for  Wolsey's force. No sooner had Wolsey obtained the cardinalate than he  pressed for the further dignity of papal legate in England. Not  unnaturally Leo refused to endow with such an office a minister already  so powerful as to be almost independent; but Wolsey made him pay for his  refusal. Leo wanted money, and the pressure of the Turk on Southern  Europe lent a colour to his demand of clerical taxation for the purposes  of a crusade. In 1517 he sent out legates to the chief kings of  Christendom; but Henry refused to admit Cardinal Campeggio, saying that  \"it was not the rule of this realm to admit legates _à latere_.\" Then  Wolsey intervened and suggested that Campeggio might come if he would  exercise no exceptional powers, and if his dignity were shared by  himself. Leo was forced to yield, and Campeggio's arrival was made  the occasion of stately ceremonies which redounded to Wolsey's  glorification. Campeggio got little for the crusade, but served to grace  the festivities of the French alliance, and afterwards to convey the  Pope's adhesion to the universal peace. Wolsey had taken matters out of  the Pope's hand, and Leo was driven to follow his lead with what grace  he could muster. Perhaps as he sighed over his discomfiture he consoled  himself with the thought that the new peace would not last much longer  than those previously made: if he did, he was right in his opinion.           CHAPTER IV   THE FIELD OF THE CLOTH OF GOLD   1518-1520      The object of Wolsey's foreign policy had been attained by the universal  peace of 1518. England had been set up as the mediator in the politics  of Europe. The old claims of the empire and the papacy had passed away  in the conflict of national and dynastic interests, in which papacy and  empire were alike involved. England, by virtue of its insular position,  was practically outside the objects of immediate ambition which  distracted its Continental neighbours; but England's commercial  interests made her desirous of influence, and Henry VIII. was bent upon  being an important personage. It was Wolsey's object to gratify the king  at the least expense to the country, and so long as the king could be  exalted by peaceful means, the good of England was certainly promoted at  the same time. The position of England as the pacifier of Europe was one  well qualified to develop a national consciousness of great duties to  perform; and it may be doubted if a country is ever great unless it has  a clear consciousness of some great mission.    Wolsey's policy had been skilful, and the results which he had obtained  were glorious; but it was difficult to maintain the position which he  had won. It was one thing to proclaim a peace; it was another to  contrive that peace should be kept. One important question was looming  in the distance when Wolsey's peace was signed,--the succession to the  empire on Maximilian's death. Unfortunately this question came rapidly  forward for decision, as Maximilian died suddenly on 12th January 1519,  and the politicians of Europe waited breathlessly to see who would be  chosen as his successor.    The election to the empire rested with the seven electors, the chief  princes of Germany; but if they had been minded on this occasion to  exercise freely their right, it would have been difficult for them to do  so. The empire had for a century been with the house of Austria, and  Maximilian had schemed eagerly that it should pass to his grandson  Charles. It is true that Charles was already King of Spain, Lord of the  Netherlands, and King of Naples and Sicily, so that it seemed dangerous  to increase still further his great dominions. But Charles urged his  claim, and his great rival, Francis I. of France, entered the lists  against him. Strange as it may seem that a French king should aspire to  rule over Germany, Francis I. could urge that he was almost as closely  connected with Germany as was Charles, whose interests were bound up  with those of Spain and the Netherlands. In the face of these two  competitors, it was hard for the electors to find a candidate of a  humbler sort who would venture to draw upon himself the wrath of their  disappointment. Moreover, the task of ruling Germany was not such as to  attract a small prince. The Turks were threatening its borders, and a  strong man was needed to deal with many pressing problems of its  government. The electors, however, were scarcely guilty of any patriotic  considerations; they quietly put up their votes for auction between  Francis and Charles, and deferred a choice as long as they could.    Both competitors turned for help to their allies, the Pope and the King  of England, who found themselves greatly perplexed. Leo X. did not wish  to see French influence increased, as France was a dangerous neighbour  in Italy; nor did he wish to see the empire and the kingdom of Naples  both held by the same man, for that was against the immemorial policy of  the Papacy. So Leo intrigued and prevaricated to such an extent that it  is almost impossible to determine what he was aiming at. He managed,  however, to throw hindrances in Wolsey's path, though we cannot be sure  that he intended to do so.    Wolsey's plan of action was clear, though it was not dignified. He  wished to preserve England's mediating attitude and give offence to no  one; consequently, he secretly promised his help both to Charles and  Francis, and tried to arrange that each should be ignorant of his  promises to the other. All went well till Leo, in his diplomatic  divagations, commissioned his legate to suggest to Henry VIII. that it  might be possible, after all, to find some third candidate for the  empire, and that he was ready to try and put off the election for that  purpose, if Henry agreed. Henry seems to have considered this as a hint  from the Pope to become a candidate himself. He remembered that  Maximilian had offered to resign the empire in his favour, but he forgot  the sufficient reasons which had led him to dismiss the proposal as  fantastic and absurd. His vanity was rather tickled with the notion of  rivalling Charles and Francis, and he thought that if the Pope were on  his side, his chances would be as good as theirs.    We can only guess at Wolsey's dismay when his master laid this project  before him. Whatever Wolsey thought, he knew that it was useless to  offer any opposition. However much he might be able to influence the  king's opinions in the making, he knew that he must execute them when  they were made. If Henry had made up his mind to become a candidate for  the empire, a candidate he must be. All that could be done was to  prevent his determination from being hopelessly disastrous. So Wolsey  pointed out that great as were the advantages to be obtained by gaining  the empire, there were dangers in being an unsuccessful candidate. It  was necessary first to make sure of the Pope, and then to prosecute  Henry's candidature by fair and honourable means. Francis was spending  money lavishly to win supporters to his side; and Charles was  reluctantly compelled to follow his example lest he should be outbid. It  would be unwise for Henry to squander his money and simply raise the  market price of the votes. Let him make it clear to the greedy Germans  that they would not see the colour of England's money till the English  king had been really elected.    So Wolsey sent the most cautious instructions to his agent in Rome to  see if the Pope would take the responsibility of urging Henry to become  a candidate; but Leo was too cautious, and affected not to understand  the hint. Then in May, Pace, who was now the king's secretary, was sent  to Germany to sound the electors with equal care. He was to approach the  electors who were on Francis's side, as though Henry were in favour of  Francis, and was to act similarly to those who were in favour of  Charles; then he was to hint cautiously that it might be well to choose  some one more closely connected with Germany, and if they showed any  acquiescence, was to suggest that Henry was \"of the German tongue,\" and  then was to sing his praises. Probably both Pace and Wolsey knew that it  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5396"],[0,"The Crisis — Complete (#9)"],[1,"could not repress a smile, a smile not without bitterness. Then he  wheeled to face Mr. Jerkins. Out of respect for the personages involved,  the auctioneer had been considerately silent daring the event. It was  Mr. Brice who was now the centre of observation.    Come, gentlemen, come, this here's a joke--eight twenty-five. She's  worth two thousand. I've been in the business twenty yea's, and I neve'  seen her equal. Give me a bid, Mr.--Mr.--you have the advantage of me,  suh.\"    \"Eight hundred and thirty-five!\" said Stephen.    \"Now, Mr. Jerkins, now, suh! we've got twenty me' to sell.\"    \"Eight fifty!\" said Mr. Jerkins.    \"Eight sixty!\" said Stephen, and they cheered him.    Mr. Jenkins took his cigar out of his teeth, and stared.    \"Eight seventy-five!\" said he.    \"Eight eighty-five!\" said Stephen.    There was a breathless pause.    \"Nine hundred!\" said the trader.    \"Nine hundred and ten!\" cried Stephen.    At that Mr. Jerkins whipped his hat from off his head, and made Stephen  a derisive bow.    \"She's youahs, suh,\" he said. \"These here are panic times. I've struck  my limit. I can do bettah in Louisville fo' less. Congratulate you,  suh--reckon you want her wuss'n I do.\"    At which sally Stephen grew scarlet, and the crowd howled with joy.    \"What!\" yelled the auctioneer. \"Why, gentlemen, this heah's a joke. Nine  hundred and ten dollars, gents, nine hundred and ten. We've just begun,  gents. Come, Mr. Jerkins, that's giving her away.\"    The trader shook his head, and puffed at his cigar.    \"Well,\" cried the oily man, \"this is a slaughter. Going at nine hundred  an' ten--nine ten--going--going--\" down came the hammer--\"gone at nine  hundred and ten to Mr.--Mr.--you have the advantage of me, suh.\"    An attendant had seized the girl, who was on the verge of fainting, and  was dragging her back. Stephen did not heed the auctioneer, but thrust  forward regardless of stares.    \"Handle her gently, you blackguard,\" he cried.    The man took his hands off.    \"Suttinly, sah,\" he said.    Hester lifted her eyes, and they were filled with such gratitude and  trust that suddenly he was overcome with embarrassment.    \"Can you walk?\" he demanded, somewhat harshly.    \"Yes, massa.\"    \"Then get up,\" he said, \"and follow me.\"    She rose obediently. Then a fat man came out of the Court House, with a  quill in his hand, and a merry twinkle in his eye that Stephen resented.    \"This way, please, sah,\" and he led him to a desk, from the drawer of  which he drew forth a blank deed.    \"Name, please!\"    \"Stephen Atterbury Brice.\"    \"Residence, Mr. Brice!\"    Stephen gave the number. But instead of writing it clown, the man merely  stared at him, while the fat creases in his face deepened and deepened.  Finally he put down his quill, and indulged in a gale of laughter,  hugely to Mr. Brice's discomfiture.    \"Shucks!\" said the fat man, as soon as he could.    \"What are you givin' us? That the's a Yankee boa'din' house.\"    \"And I suppose that that is part of your business, too,\" said Stephen,  acidly.    The fat man looked at him, pressed his lips, wrote down the number,  shaken all the while with a disturbance which promised to lead to  another explosion. Finally, after a deal of pantomime, and whispering  and laughter with the notary behind the wire screen, the deed was made  out, signed, attested, and delivered. Stephen counted out the money  grimly, in gold and Boston drafts.    Out in the sunlight on Chestnut Street, with the girl by his side, it  all seemed a nightmare. The son of Appleton Brice of Boston the owner of  a beautiful quadroon girl! And he had bought hex with his last cent.    Miss Crane herself opened the door in answer to his ring. Her keen eyes  instantly darted over his shoulder and dilated, But Stephen, summoning  all his courage, pushed past her to the stairs, and beckoned Hester to  follow.    \"I have brought this--this person to see my mother,\" he said    The spinster bowed from the back of her neck. She stood transfixed on a  great rose in the hall carpet until she heard Mrs. Brice's door open and  slam, and then she strode up the stairs and into the apartment of Mrs.  Abner Reed. As she passed the first landing, the quadroon girl was  waiting in the hall.          CHAPTER VI. SILAS WHIPPLE    The trouble with many narratives is that they tell too much. Stephen's  interview with his mother was a quiet affair, and not historic. Miss  Crane's boarding-house is not an interesting place, and the tempest in  that teapot is better imagined than described. Out of consideration for  Mr. Stephen Brice, we shall skip likewise a most affecting scene at Mr.  Canter's second-hand furniture store.    That afternoon Stephen came again to the dirty flight of steps which  led to Judge Whipple's office. He paused a moment to gather courage, and  then, gripping the rail, he ascended. The ascent required courage now,  certainly. He halted again before the door at the top. But even as he  stood there came to him, in low, rich tones, the notes of a German song.  He entered And Mr. Richter rose in shirt-sleeves from his desk to greet  him, all smiling.    \"Ach, my friend!\" said he, \"but you are late. The Judge has been  awaiting you.\"    \"Has he?\" inquired Stephen, with ill-concealed anxiety.    The big young German patted him on the shoulder.    Suddenly a voice roared from out the open transom of the private office,  like a cyclone through a gap.    \"Mr. Richter!\"    \"Sir!\"    \"Who is that?\"    \"Mr. Brice, sir.\"    \"Then why in thunder doesn't he come in?\"    Mr. Richter opened the private door, and in Stephen walked. The door  closed again, and there he was in the dragon's dens face to face with  the dragon, who was staring him through and through. The first objects  that caught Stephen's attention were the grizzly gray eye brows, which  seemed as so much brush to mark the fire of the deep-set battery of the  eyes. And that battery, when in action, must have been truly terrible.    The Judge was shaven, save for a shaggy fringe of gray beard around his  chin, and the size of his nose was apparent even in the full face.    Stephen felt that no part of him escaped the search of Mr. Whipple's  glance. But it was no code or course of conduct that kept him silent.  Nor was it fear entirely.    \"So you are Appleton Brice's son,\" said the Judge, at last. His tone was  not quite so gruff as it might have been.    \"Yes, sir,\" said Stephen.    \"Humph!\" said the Judge, with a look that scarcely expressed approval.  \"I guess you've been patted on the back too much by your father's  friends.\" He leaned back in his wooden chair. \"How I used to detest  people who patted boys on the back and said with a smirk, 'I know your  father.' I never had a father whom people could say that about. But,  sir,\" cried the Judge, bringing down his fist on the litter of papers  that covered his desk, \"I made up my mind that one day people should  know me. That was my spur. And you'll start fair here, Mr. Brice. They  won't know your father here--\"    If Stephen thought the Judge brutal, he did not say so. He glanced  around the little room,--at the bed in the corner, in which the Judge  slept, and which during the day did not escape the flood of books and  papers; at the washstand, with a roll of legal cap beside the pitcher.    \"I guess you think this town pretty crude after Boston, Mr. Brice,\" Mr.  Whipple continued. \"From time immemorial it has been the pleasant habit  of old communities to be shocked at newer settlements, built by their  own countrymen. Are you shocked, sir?\"    Stephen flushed. Fortunately the Judge did not give him time to answer.    \"Why didn't your mother let me know that she was coming?\"    \"She didn't wish to put you to any trouble, sir.\"    \"Wasn't I a good friend of your father's? Didn't I ask you to come here  and go into my office?\"    \"But there was a chance, Mr. Whipple--\"    \"A chance of what?\"    \"That you would not like me. And there is still a chance of it,\" added  Stephen, smiling.    For a second it looked as if the Judge might smile, too. He rubbed his  nose with a fearful violence.    \"Mr. Richter tells me you were looking for a bank,\" said he, presently.    Stephen quaked.    \"Yes, sir, I was, but--\"    But Mr. Whipple merely picked up the 'Counterfeit Bank Note Detector'.    \"Beware of Western State Currency as you would the devil,\" said he.  \"That's one thing we don't equal the East in--yet. And so you want to  become a lawyer?\"    \"I intend to become a lawyer, sir.\"    \"And so you shall, sir,\" cried the Judge, bringing down his yellow fist  upon the 'Bank Note Detector'. \"I'll make you a lawyer, sir. But my  methods ain't Harvard methods, sir.\"    \"I am ready to do anything, Mr. Whipple.\"    The Judge merely grunted. He scratched among his papers, and produced  some legal cap and a bunch of notes.    \"Go out there,\" he said, \"and take off your coat and copy this brief.  Mr. Richter will help you to-day. And tell your mother I shall do myself  the honor to call upon her this evening.\"    Stephen did as he was told, without a word. But Mr. Richter was not in  the outer office when he returned to it. He tried to compose himself to  write, although the recollection of each act of the morning hung like a  cloud over the back of his head. Therefore the first sheet of legal cap  was spoiled utterly. But Stephen had a deep sense of failure. He had  gone through the ground glass door with the firm intention of making  a clean breast of the ownership of Hester. Now, as he sat still, the  trouble grew upon him. He started a new sheet, and ruined that: Once he  got as far as his feet, and sat down again. But at length he had quieted  to the extent of deciphering ten lines of Mr. Whipple's handwriting when  the creak of a door shattered his nerves completely.    He glanced up from his work to behold--none other than Colonel Comyn  Carvel.    Glancing at Mr. Richter's chair, and seeing it"]]]
