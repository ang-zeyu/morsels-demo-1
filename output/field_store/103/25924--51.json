I'll signal to them both, and they'll meet us by the  bridge. We'll call at the Vicarage and pick up Nan and Lizzie, then we  shall be quite a jolly party. Oh, here's Constable with Billy. I'm so  glad Mrs. Donnithorne will lend him to us. Are we all ready? Then come  along!\"    The six picturesque Castletons were already well known in the streets of  Chagmouth, and many eyes were turned to look at them as they passed  along, with Perugia and Gabriel riding the donkey together, Romola  holding them both on, and Lilith leading Billy by the bridle. Kindly  comments came from cottage doorways.    \"Stick on tight, ma dear!\"    \"Don't 'ee walk behind or her'll kick!\"    \"Mind her don't run away with ee!\"    \"Don't they ride pretty, bless 'em!\"    At the bridge by the harbour the party was reinforced by Fay and Tattie,  and farther on they were joined by the Colvilles, so that they were  twelve strong as they left the town, and a particularly merry crew. At  the beginning of the first hill, however, the donkey stopped dead.  Several hands seized its bridle and tried to urge it forward, while Mavis  and Merle pushed it in the rear, but not all their efforts could induce  it to stir an inch.    \"Romola! What utter idiots we are!\" exclaimed Beata. \"Of course we've  forgotten the peppermints!\"    \"Bother! So we have! We must go back for some, that's all!\"    \"The 'donk' won't go without peppermints! He simply loves them!\"  explained Beata tragically.    \"We always take a big packet of them with us to give him. He expects  them! He's turning his head round to look for them!\"    \"Bless his heart, he shall have them then!\" cooed Merle, patting the  dusty coat of their steed. \"His auntie will go and get some for him  herself if he'll wait like a good boy. Is he particular what kind he  gets?\"    \"He likes those big brown humbugs!\"    \"Right-o! I'll run to Denham's shop and buy some. It's not far. Wait for  me, won't you?\"    \"Wait!\" echoed Beata. \"There'll be no question of going on. Nothing but  humbugs will make him move his four feet. We'll camp here till you come  back.\"    Merle performed her errand quickly, returning with two packets of sweets,  one for Billy and the other for the rest of the party. The donkey, after  consuming several peppermints, condescended to move on, and the  procession started once more. They had not gone far, however, before a  mishap occurred: in lieu of saddle a cushion had been tied on to Billy's  back, the strap had loosened, the cushion suddenly slipped, and Perugia  and Gabriel descended into the road. Romola managed to break their fall,  but they were both terrified, and refused to mount again, so Constable  took a turn instead, holding the bridle himself, while Lilith, with all  the Castleton instinct for artistic effect, gathered posies of wild  flowers and wove them into a wreath for the donkey's neck.    The small people could not walk fast, and the steed stopped so often to  demand refreshments, that the expedition was very leisurely and they did  not proceed far. They had only reached the point above the lighthouse  when Mavis, with an eye on her wrist watch, declared it was time to turn  back.    \"We'll go with you another time, when we haven't to trail all this crew  along!\" sighed Beata, as she bade good-bye to her friends. \"Children are  a nuisance if you want to get on quickly. I'd have left them in the  garden if I could! Come and see us again at The Haven, won't you? I wish  Claudia and Morland were at home and we'd have some music. Well, I shall  see you next week, I suppose. I'm to have my first violin lesson on  Monday. I don't know whether I'm glad or not. I expect I shall be  terrified of Mr. Barlow. I learnt from a lady before. How I'm going to  practise and do all the home lessons Miss Mitchell sets us I can't  imagine! I think I shall strike like the 'donk' and refuse to stir unless  they give me peppermints!\"          CHAPTER V    Miss Mitchell, B.A.      Naturally at present the most prominent person at 'The Moorings' was Miss  Mitchell. Hers was a task which required a combination of a number of  very high qualities. It needed force of character and tact, initiative  and patience, energy and experience. To reorganise an old school is a far  more difficult matter than to start an entirely new one, especially when  those responsible for the former _r√©gime_ have not absolutely  retired. To a certain extent the Misses Pollard had given their teacher a  free hand, but she realised that at first it would be wise to go slowly  and not make the changes too drastic. She did not yet know what stuff she  had to work upon, the characters or capacities of her pupils, or their  readiness to adopt her ideas. While leading the school, she wished it to  be self-developing, that is to say, she thought it better to give the  girls a few general directions, and allow them to run their own  societies, than to arrange all such matters for them.    \"Never mind if they make a few mistakes,\" she said to Miss Fanny, who  held up her hands in horror at some of the names chosen to serve on  committees. \"If a secretary proves inefficient, the others will very soon  call her a 'slacker,' and she will have to reform or resign. It will be a  question of public opinion. A girl may shirk her lessons in school and  her classmates don't much care, but if she shirks the work she has  undertaken to do for a society they will be very indignant. These clubs  are an elementary object-lesson in community life, and will teach that  each individual must do something for the general good. The girls must  'feel their feet' before they can run; they'll probably have difficulties  but they'll learn by experience, and in the meantime they'll be shaping  their own traditions.\"    \"Ye-es; I suppose you're right,\" dubiously agreed Miss Fanny, whose ideal  of management was to trust everything in the hands of a few girls whom  she knew best and discourage any signs of individuality on the part of  the others.    As regards the work of the various forms Miss Mitchell, helped by her  assistant mistress Miss Barnes, made many innovations. She introduced new  subjects and fresh modes of teaching, and fixed a very high standard of  efficiency. She expected great concentration, and exacted hard work,  especially in the matter of home preparation, but she was an exceedingly  interesting teacher and put much enthusiasm into her lessons. She had a  theory that no subject was really absorbed unless it was vividly realised  by the pupils.    \"Imagination is half the value of education\" was her favourite saying. \"A  child may reel off a string of facts, but unless it can apply them they  are undigested mental food and of no use. What I want to do is to find  out how far each girl understands what she has learnt. Mere parrot  repetition is quite valueless in my opinion, and most public examinations  are little better.\"    Miss Mitchell's method of testing the knowledge of her pupils was  undoubtedly modern. She would teach them certain episodes of history,  explaining particularly the characters of the various personages and the  motives for their actions, then, instead of a verbal or written catechism  on the lesson, she would make the girls act the scene, using their own  words, and trying as far as possible to reproduce the atmosphere of the  period. Free criticism was allowed afterwards, and any anachronisms, such  as tea in the times of Queen Elizabeth, or tobacco during the Wars of the  Roses, were carefully pointed out. Most of the girls liked this new  method immensely. It encouraged their dramatic instincts, and resembled  impromptu theatricals. It was a point of honour to throw themselves  thoroughly into the parts, and they would often prepare themselves at  home by reading up various points in histories or encyclopaedias. This  was exactly what Miss Mitchell aimed at.    \"They're educating themselves!\" she explained to Miss Fanny. \"They'll  never forget these facts that they have taken the trouble to find out.  Once a girl has realised the outlook of Mary Queen of Scots or Elizabeth,  and has learnt to impersonate her without glaring mistakes, she has the  keynote to the history of the times. When she has spoken to 'Darnley,'  'Black Both-well,' 'Rizzio,' 'John Knox,' or to 'Bacon,' 'Raleigh,'  'Essex,' and 'Sidney,' she has turned mere names into real personages,  and will be no more likely to confuse them than to mix up her friends.  By supplying her own dialogue she shows exactly how much she knows of the  character, and I am able to judge how far the lesson has been  assimilated. Fifteen years hence I venture to think Scottish Mary or  Queen Elizabeth will still be vivid remembrances to her; but would she be  able to tell the date of the battle of Pinkie? And would it be of very  vital importance whether she did or not? In my opinion to grasp the main  motives of history and to follow the evolution of the British nation is  far more necessary than memorising dates. Of course, a few must be  insisted on, or there would be no means of relative comparison, but these  few, accurately learnt, are better than a number repeated glibly without  any particular conception of their importance.\"    In the teaching of geography Miss Mitchell also put her theories into  action. As taught in many schools she thought it was a wearisome subject.    \"You don't want to knock into a child's head the names of the capes and  bays of Africa or the population of Canada, but you want to give it some  conception of the different countries on the face of God's earth. Instead  of making it learn the exports of Italy, show it pictures of the orange  groves and of gathering the olives, and it will name you the exports for  itself. Geography ought to be as interesting as a game.\"    And so indeed she contrived to make it.

Athens  ceded her rights of primogeniture to New Athens, Alexandria, capital  of Egypt, and cosmopolitan centre of the civilized world. For a whole  century Judea played the sad part of the apple of discord between the  Egyptian and the Syrian dynasty (320-203 B. C. E.). By turns she owned  the sway of the Ptolemies and the Seleucidae, until finally, in 203,  she was declared a Syro-Macedonian province. Here, as in the other  parts of their realm, the rulers devoted themselves energetically to  the dissemination of Greek culture. Meeting with resistance, they had  resort to main force. At first, indeed, a large part of the people  permitted itself to be blinded by the \"beauty of Japheth,\" and  promoted assimilation with the Greeks. But when the spread of  Hellenism began to threaten the spiritual individuality of Judaism,  the rest of the nation, endowed with greater capacity of resistance,  arose and sturdily repulsed the enemy.    Hellenism was the first gravely dangerous opponent Judaism had to  encounter. It was not the ordinary meeting of two peoples, or of two  kinds of civilization. It was a clash between two theories of life  that stood abruptly opposed to each other, were, indeed, mutually  exclusive. It was a duel between \"the Eternal\" on the one side, and  Zeus on the other--between the Creator of the universe, the invisible  spiritual Being who had, in a miraculous way, revealed religious and  ethical ideals to mankind, and the deity who resided upon Olympus, who  personified the highest force of nature, consumed vast quantities of  nectar and ambrosia, and led a pretty wild life upon Olympus and  elsewhere. In the sphere of religion and morality, Hellene and Judean  could not come close to each other. The former deified nature herself,  the material universe; the latter deified the Creator of nature, the  spirit informing the material universe. The Hellene paid homage first  and foremost to external beauty and physical strength; the Judean to  inner beauty and spiritual heroism. The Hellenic theory identified the  moral with the beautiful and the agreeable, and made life consist of  an uninterrupted series of physical and mental pleasures. The Judean  theory is permeated by the strictly ethical notions of duty, of  purity, of \"holiness\"; it denounces licentiousness, and sets up as its  ideal the controlling of the passions and the infinite improvement of  the soul, not of the intellect alone, but of the feelings as well.  These differences between the two theories of life showed themselves  in the brusque opposition in character and customs that made the  Greeks and the Jews absolute antipodes in many spheres of life. It  cannot be denied that in matters of the intellect, especially in the  field of philosophy and science, not to mention art, it might have  been greatly to the advantage of the Jews to become disciples of the  Greeks. Nor is there any doubt that the brighter aspects of Hellenism  would make an admirable complement to Judaism. An harmonious blending  of the Prophets with Socrates and Plato would have produced a  many-sided, ideal _Weltanschauung_. The course of historical events  from the first made such blending, which would doubtless have  required great sacrifices on both sides, an impossible consummation.  In point of fact, the events were such as to widen the abyss between  the two systems. The meeting of Judaism and Hellenism unfortunately  occurred at the very moment when the classical Hellenes had been  supplanted by the hellenized Macedonians and Syrians, who had accepted  what were probably the worst elements of the antique system, while  appropriating but few of the intellectual excellencies of Greek  culture. There was another thwarting circumstance. In this epoch, the  Greeks were the political oppressors of the Jews, outraging Jewish  national feeling through their tyranny to the same degree as by their  immoral life they shocked Jewish ethical feeling and Jewish chastity.    Outraged national and religious feeling found expression in the  insurrection of the Maccabees (168 B. C. E.). The hoary priest  Mattathias and his sons fought for the dearest and noblest treasures  of Judaism. Enthusiasm begets heroism. The Syrian-Greek yoke was  thrown off, and, after groaning under alien rule, the Persian, the  Egyptian, and the Syro-Macedonian, for four hundred years, Judea  became an independent state. In its foreign relations, the new state  was secured by the self-sacrificing courage of the first Maccabean  brothers, and from within it was supported by the deep-sunk pillars of  the spiritual life. The rise of the three famous parties, the  Sadducees, the Pharisees, and the Essenes, by no means testifies, as  many would have us believe, to national disintegration, but rather to  the intense spiritual activity of the people. The three tendencies  afforded opportunity for the self-consciousness of the nation to  express itself in all its variety and force. The unbending religious  dogmatism of the Sadducees, the comprehensive practical sense of the  Pharisees in religious and Rational concerns, the contemplative  mysticism of the Essenes, they are the most important offshoots from  the Jewish system as held at that time. In consequence of the external  conditions that brought about the destruction of the Maccabean  state[12] after a century's existence (165-63 B. C. E.), the Pharisee  tendency, which had proved itself the best in practice, won the upper  hand. When Judea was held fast in the clutches of the Roman eagle, all  hope of escape being cut off, the far-seeing leaders of the people  gained the firm conviction that the only trustworthy support of the  Jewish nation lay in its religion. They realized that the preservation  of national unity could be effected only by a consistent organization  of the religious law, which was to envelop and shape the whole  external life of the people. This explains the feverish activity of  the early creators of the Mishna, of Hillel, Shammai, and others, and  it interprets also the watchword of still older fame, \"Make a fence  about the Law.\" If up to that moment religious usage in its  development had kept abreast of the requirements of social and  individual life, the requirements out of which it had grown forth, it  now became a national function, and its further evolution advanced  with tremendous strides. For the protection of the old \"Mosaic Laws,\"  a twofold and a threefold fence of new legal ordinances was erected  about them, and the cult became more and more complicated. But the  externals of religion did not monopolize all the forces. The moral  element in the nation was promoted with equal vigor. Hillel, the head  of the Pharisee party, was not a legislator alone, he was also a model  of humane principles and rare moral attainments.      [12] The external causes of the downfall of the Maccabean state,      dynastic quarrels, are well known. Much less light has been      thrown upon the inner, deeper-lying causes of the catastrophe.      These are possibly to be sought in the priestly-political      dualism of the Judean form of government. The ideal of a      nation educated by means of the Bible was a theocratic state,      and the first princes of the Maccabean house, acting at once      as regents and as high priests, in a measure reached this      ideal. But the attempts of other nations had demonstrated      conclusively enough that a dualistic form of government cannot      maintain itself permanently. Sooner or later one of the two      elements, the priestly or the secular, is bound to prevail      over the other and crush it. In the Judean realm, with its      profoundly religious trend, the priestly element obtained the      ascendency, and political ruin ensued. The priestly-political      retreated before the priestly-national form of government.      Though the religious element was powerless to preserve the      _state_ from destruction, we shall see that it has      brilliantly vindicated its ability to keep the _nation_      intact.    While Judaism, in its native country was striving to isolate itself,  and was seizing upon all sorts of expedients to insure this end, it  readily entered into relations, outside of Judea, with other systems  of thought, and accepted elements of the classical culture. Instead of  the violent opposition which the Palestinian Judaism of the  pre-Maccabean period, that is, the period of strife, had offered to  Hellenism, the tendency to make mutual concessions, and pave the way  for an understanding between the two theories of life, asserted itself  in Alexandria. In the capital city of the hellenized world the Jews  constituted one of the most important elements of culture. According  to Mommsen, the Jewish colony in Alexandria was not inferior, in point  of numbers, to the Jewish population of Jerusalem, the metropolis.  Influenced by Greek civilization, the Jews in turn exercised decisive  influence upon their heathen surroundings, and introduced a new  principle of development into the activity of the cultivated classes.  The Greek translation of the Biblical writings formed the connecting  link between Judaism and Hellenism. The \"Septuaginta,\" the translation  of the Pentateuch, in use since the third century before the Christian  era, had acquainted the classical world with Jewish views and  principles. The productions of the Prophets and, in later centuries,  of the other Biblical authors, translated and spread broadcast, acted  irresistibly upon the spirit of the cultivated heathen, and granted  him a glimpse into a world of hitherto unknown notions. On this soil  sprang up the voluminous Judeo-Hellenic literature, of which but a  few, though characteristic, specimens have descended to us."]]]
