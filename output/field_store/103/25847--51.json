Thou must throw the blame on thy companions, and  say they put thee out, and then thou must ask him to say the  words first, word by word, and to let thee say the words after  him.  He will give thee leave, and summon himself in the suit,  and thou shalt summon after him there and then, and this time say  every word right.  When it is done, ask Hrut if that were rightly  summoned, and he will answer, `There is no flaw to be found in  it.'  Then thou shalt say in a loud voice, so that thy companions  may hear, `I summon thee in the suit which Unna, Mord's daughter,  has made over to me with her plighted hand.'    \"But when men are sound asleep, you shall rise and take your  bridles and saddles, and tread softly, and go out of the house,  and put your saddles on your fat horses in the fields, and so  ride off on them, but leave the others behind you.  You must ride  up into the hills away from the home pastures and stay there  three nights, for about so long will they seek you.  After that  ride home south, riding always by night and resting by day.  As  for us, we will then ride this summer to the Thing, and help thee  in thy suit.\"  So Gunnar thanked Njal, and first of all rode  home.        23. HUCKSTER HEDINN.    Gunnar rode from home two nights afterwards, and two men with  him; they rode along until they got on Bluewoodheath and then men  on horseback met them and asked who that tall man might be of  whom so little was seen.  But his companions said it was Huckster  Hedinn.  Then the others said a worse was not to be looked for  behind, when such a man as he went before.  Hedinn at once made  as though he would have set upon them, but yet each went their  way.  So Gunnar went on doing everything as Njal had laid it down  for him, and when he came to Hauskuldstede he stayed there the  night, and thence he went down the dale till he came to the next  farm to Hrutstede.  There he offered his wares for sale, and  Hedinn fell at once upon the farmer.  This was told to Hrut, and  he sent for Hedinn, and Hedinn went at once to see Hrut, and had  a good welcome.  Hrut seated him over against himself, and their  talk went pretty much as Njal had guessed; but when they came to  talk of Rangrivervale, and Hrut asked about the men there, Gunnar  sung this stave --         \"Men in sooth are slow to find --       So the people speak by stealth,       Often this hath reached my ears --       All through Rangar's rolling vales.       Still I trow that Fiddle Mord,       Tried his hand in fight of yore;       Sure was never gold-bestower,       Such a man for might and wit.\"    Then Hrut said, \"Thou art a skald, Hedinn.  But hast thou never  heard how things went between me and Mord?\"  Then Hedinn sung  another stave --         \"Once I ween I heard the rumour,       How the Lord of rings (1) bereft thee;       From thine arms earth's offspring (2) tearing,       Trickfull he and trustful thou.       Then the men, the buckler-bearers,       Begged the mighty gold-begetter,       Sharp sword oft of old he reddened,       Not to stand in strife with thee.\"    So they went on, till Hrut, in answer told him how the suit must  be taken up, and recited the summons.  Hedinn repeated it all  wrong, and Hrut burst out laughing, and had no mistrust.  Then he  said, Hrut must summon once more, and Hrut did so.  Then Hedinn  repeated the summons a second time, and this time right, and  called his companions to witness how he summoned Hrut in a suit  which Unna, Mord's daughter, had made over to him with her  plighted hand.  At night he went to sleep like other men, but as  soon as ever Hrut was sound asleep, they took their clothes and  arms, and went out and came to their horses, and rode off across  the river, and so up along the bank by Hiardarholt till the dale  broke off among the hills, and so there they are upon the fells  between Laxriverdale and Hawkdale, having got to a spot where no  one could find them unless he had fallen on them by chance.    Hauskuld wakes up that night at Hauskuldstede, and roused all his  household.  \"I will tell you my dream,\" he said.  \"I thought I  saw a great bear go out of this house, and I knew at once this  beast's match was not to be found; two cubs followed him, wishing  well to the bear, and they all made for Hrutstede and went into  the house there.  After that I woke.  Now I wish to ask if any of  you saw aught about yon tall man.\"    Then one man answered him, \"I saw how a golden fringe and a bit  of scarlet cloth peeped out at his arm, and on his right arm he  had a ring of gold.\"    Hauskuld said, \"This beast is no man's fetch, but Gunnar's of  Lithend, and now methinks I see all about it.  Up!  let us ride  to Hrutstede,\" And they did so.  Hrut lay in his locked bed, and  asks who have come there?  Hauskuld tells who he is, and asked  what guests might be there in the house?    \"Only Huckster Hedinn is here,\" says Hrut.    \"A broader man across the back, it will be, I fear,\" says  Hauskuld, \"I guess here must have been Gunnar of Lithend.\"    \"Then there has been a pretty trial of cunning,\" says Hrut.    \"What has happened?\" says Hauskuld.    \"I told him how to take up Unna's suit, and I summoned myself and  he summoned after, and now he can use this first step in the  suit, and it is right in law.\"    \"There has, indeed, been a great falling off of wit on one side,\"  said Hauskuld, \"and Gunnar cannot have planned it all by himself;  Njal must be at the bottom of this plot, for there is not his  match for wit in all the land.\"    Now they look for Hedinn, but he is already off and away; after  that they gathered folk, and looked for them three days, but  could not find them.  Gunnar rode south from the fell to Hawkdale  and so east of Skard, and north to Holtbeaconheath, and so on  until he got home.      ENDNOTES:    (1)  \"Lord of rings,\" a periphrasis for a chief, that is, Mord.  (2)  \"Earth's offspring,\" a periphrasis for woman, that is, Unna.        24. GUNNAR AND HRUT STRIVE AT THE THING.    Gunnar rode to the Althing, and Hrut and Hauskuld rode thither  too with a very great company.  Gunnar pursues his suit, and  began by calling on his neighbours to bear witness, but Hrut and  his brother had it in their minds to make an onslaught on him,  but they mistrusted their strength.    Gunnar next went to the court of the men of Broadfirth, and bade  Hrut listen to his oath and declaration of the cause of the suit,  and to all the proofs which he was about to bring forward.  After  that he took his oath, and declared his case.  After that he  brought forward his witnesses of the summons, along with his  witnesses that the suit had been handed over to him.  All this  time Njal was not at the court.  Now Gunnar pursued his suit till  he called on the defendant to reply.  Then Hrut took witness, and  said the suit was naught, and that there was a flaw in the  pleading; he declared that it had broken down because Gunnar had  failed to call those three witnesses which ought to have been  brought before the court.  The first, that which was taken before  the marriage-bed, the second, before the man's door, the third,  at the Hill of Laws.  By this time Njal was come to the court and  said the suit and pleading might still be kept alive if they  chose to strive in that way.    \"No,\" says Gunnar, \"I will not have that; I will do the same to  Hrut as he did to Mord my kinsman; or, are those brothers Hrut  and Hauskuld so near that they may hear my voice.\"    \"Hear it we can,\" says Hrut.  \"What dost thou wish?\"    Gunnar said, \"Now all men here present be ear-witnesses, that I  challenge thee Hrut to single combat, and we shall fight to-day  on the holm, which is here in Oxwater.  But if thou wilt not  fight with me, then pay up all the money this very day.\"    After that Gunnar sung a stave --         \"Yes, so must it be, this morning --       Now my mind is full of fire --       Hrut with me on yonder island       Raises roar of helm and shield.       All that bear my words bear witness,       Warriors grasping Woden's guard,       Unless the wealthy wight down payeth       Dower of wife with flowing veil.\"    After that Gunnar went away from the court with all his  followers.  Hrut and Hauskuld went home too, and the suit was  never pursued nor defended from that day forth.  Hrut said, as  soon as he got inside the booth, \"This has never happened to me  before, that any man has offered me combat and I have shunned  it.\"    \"Then thou must mean to fight,\" says Hauskuld, \"but that shall  not be if I have my way; for thou comest no nearer to Gunnar than  Mord would have come to thee, and we had better both of us pay up  the money to Gunnar.\"    After that the brothers asked the householders of their own  country what they would lay down, and they one and all said they  would lay down as much as Hrut wished.    \"Let us go then,\" says Hauskuld, \"to Gunnar's booth, and pay down  the money out of hand.\"  That was told to Gunnar, and he went out  into the doorway of the booth, and Hauskuld said, \"Now it is  thine to take the money.\"    Gunnar said, \"Pay it down, then, for I am ready to take it.\"    So they paid down the money truly out of hand, and then Hauskuld  said, \"Enjoy it now, as thou hast gotten it.\"  Then Gunnar sang  another stave: --         \"Men who wield the blade of battle       Hoarded wealth may well enjoy,       Guileless gotten this at least,       Golden meed I fearless take;       But if we for woman's quarrel,       Warriors born to brandish sword,       Glut the wolf with manly gore,       Worse the lot of both would be.\"    Hrut answered, \"Ill will be thy meed for this.\"    \"Be that as it may,\" says Gunnar.    Then Hauskuld and his brother went home to their booth, and he  had much upon his mind, and said to Hrut, \"Will this unfairness  of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/599"],[0,"Vanity Fair (#9)"],[1,"a sad wicked satirical  creature; and how frightened she was at the story of the elephant! \"For  your mother's sake, dear Mr. Sedley,\" she said, \"for the sake of all  your friends, promise NEVER to go on one of those horrid expeditions.\"    \"Pooh, pooh, Miss Sharp,\" said he, pulling up his shirt-collars; \"the  danger makes the sport only the pleasanter.\" He had never been but once  at a tiger-hunt, when the accident in question occurred, and when he  was half killed--not by the tiger, but by the fright. And as he talked  on, he grew quite bold, and actually had the audacity to ask Miss  Rebecca for whom she was knitting the green silk purse? He was quite  surprised and delighted at his own graceful familiar manner.    \"For any one who wants a purse,\" replied Miss Rebecca, looking at him  in the most gentle winning way. Sedley was going to make one of the  most eloquent speeches possible, and had begun--\"O Miss Sharp, how--\"  when some song which was performed in the other room came to an end,  and caused him to hear his own voice so distinctly that he stopped,  blushed, and blew his nose in great agitation.    \"Did you ever hear anything like your brother's eloquence?\" whispered  Mr. Osborne to Amelia.  \"Why, your friend has worked miracles.\"    \"The more the better,\" said Miss Amelia; who, like almost all women who  are worth a pin, was a match-maker in her heart, and would have been  delighted that Joseph should carry back a wife to India.  She had, too,  in the course of this few days' constant intercourse, warmed into a  most tender friendship for Rebecca, and discovered a million of virtues  and amiable qualities in her which she had not perceived when they were  at Chiswick together.  For the affection of young ladies is of as rapid  growth as Jack's bean-stalk, and reaches up to the sky in a night.  It  is no blame to them that after marriage this Sehnsucht nach der Liebe  subsides.  It is what sentimentalists, who deal in very big words, call  a yearning after the Ideal, and simply means that women are commonly  not satisfied until they have husbands and children on whom they may  centre affections, which are spent elsewhere, as it were, in small  change.    Having expended her little store of songs, or having stayed long enough  in the back drawing-room, it now appeared proper to Miss Amelia to ask  her friend to sing.  \"You would not have listened to me,\" she said to  Mr. Osborne (though she knew she was telling a fib), \"had you heard  Rebecca first.\"    \"I give Miss Sharp warning, though,\" said Osborne, \"that, right or  wrong, I consider Miss Amelia Sedley the first singer in the world.\"    \"You shall hear,\" said Amelia; and Joseph Sedley was actually polite  enough to carry the candles to the piano. Osborne hinted that he should  like quite as well to sit in the dark; but Miss Sedley, laughing,  declined to bear him company any farther, and the two accordingly  followed Mr. Joseph.  Rebecca sang far better than her friend (though  of course Osborne was free to keep his opinion), and exerted herself to  the utmost, and, indeed, to the wonder of Amelia, who had never known  her perform so well.  She sang a French song, which Joseph did not  understand in the least, and which George confessed he did not  understand, and then a number of those simple ballads which were the  fashion forty years ago, and in which British tars, our King, poor  Susan, blue-eyed Mary, and the like, were the principal themes. They  are not, it is said, very brilliant, in a musical point of view, but  contain numberless good-natured, simple appeals to the affections,  which people understood better than the milk-and-water lagrime,  sospiri, and felicita of the eternal Donizettian music with which we  are favoured now-a-days.    Conversation of a sentimental sort, befitting the subject, was carried  on between the songs, to which Sambo, after he had brought the tea, the  delighted cook, and even Mrs. Blenkinsop, the housekeeper, condescended  to listen on the landing-place.    Among these ditties was one, the last of the concert, and to the  following effect:    Ah! bleak and barren was the moor, Ah! loud and piercing was the storm,  The cottage roof was shelter'd sure, The cottage hearth was bright and  warm--An orphan boy the lattice pass'd, And, as he mark'd its cheerful  glow, Felt doubly keen the midnight blast, And doubly cold the fallen  snow.    They mark'd him as he onward prest, With fainting heart and weary limb;  Kind voices bade him turn and rest, And gentle faces welcomed him. The  dawn is up--the guest is gone, The cottage hearth is blazing still;  Heaven pity all poor wanderers lone! Hark to the wind upon the hill!    It was the sentiment of the before-mentioned words, \"When I'm gone,\"  over again.  As she came to the last words, Miss Sharp's \"deep-toned  voice faltered.\" Everybody felt the allusion to her departure, and to  her hapless orphan state.  Joseph Sedley, who was fond of music, and  soft-hearted, was in a state of ravishment during the performance of  the song, and profoundly touched at its conclusion. If he had had the  courage; if George and Miss Sedley had remained, according to the  former's proposal, in the farther room, Joseph Sedley's bachelorhood  would have been at an end, and this work would never have been written.  But at the close of the ditty, Rebecca quitted the piano, and giving  her hand to Amelia, walked away into the front drawing-room twilight;  and, at this moment, Mr. Sambo made his appearance with a tray,  containing sandwiches, jellies, and some glittering glasses and  decanters, on which Joseph Sedley's attention was immediately fixed.  When the parents of the house of Sedley returned from their  dinner-party, they found the young people so busy in talking, that they  had not heard the arrival of the carriage, and Mr. Joseph was in the  act of saying, \"My dear Miss Sharp, one little teaspoonful of jelly to  recruit you after your immense--your--your delightful exertions.\"    \"Bravo, Jos!\" said Mr. Sedley; on hearing the bantering of which  well-known voice, Jos instantly relapsed into an alarmed silence, and  quickly took his departure. He did not lie awake all night thinking  whether or not he was in love with Miss Sharp; the passion of love  never interfered with the appetite or the slumber of Mr. Joseph Sedley;  but he thought to himself how delightful it would be to hear such songs  as those after Cutcherry--what a distinguee girl she was--how she could  speak French better than the Governor-General's lady herself--and what  a sensation she would make at the Calcutta balls. \"It's evident the  poor devil's in love with me,\" thought he.  \"She is just as rich as  most of the girls who come out to India.  I might go farther, and fare  worse, egad!\" And in these meditations he fell asleep.    How Miss Sharp lay awake, thinking, will he come or not to-morrow? need  not be told here.  To-morrow came, and, as sure as fate, Mr. Joseph  Sedley made his appearance before luncheon.  He had never been known  before to confer such an honour on Russell Square. George Osborne was  somehow there already (sadly \"putting out\" Amelia, who was writing to  her twelve dearest friends at Chiswick Mall), and Rebecca was employed  upon her yesterday's work.  As Joe's buggy drove up, and while, after  his usual thundering knock and pompous bustle at the door, the  ex-Collector of Boggley Wollah laboured up stairs to the drawing-room,  knowing glances were telegraphed between Osborne and Miss Sedley, and  the pair, smiling archly, looked at Rebecca, who actually blushed as  she bent her fair ringlets over her knitting.  How her heart beat as  Joseph appeared--Joseph, puffing from the staircase in shining creaking  boots--Joseph, in a new waistcoat, red with heat and nervousness, and  blushing behind his wadded neckcloth.  It was a nervous moment for all;  and as for Amelia, I think she was more frightened than even the people  most concerned.    Sambo, who flung open the door and announced Mr. Joseph, followed  grinning, in the Collector's rear, and bearing two handsome nosegays of  flowers, which the monster had actually had the gallantry to purchase  in Covent Garden Market that morning--they were not as big as the  haystacks which ladies carry about with them now-a-days, in cones of  filigree paper; but the young women were delighted with the gift, as  Joseph presented one to each, with an exceedingly solemn bow.    \"Bravo, Jos!\" cried Osborne.    \"Thank you, dear Joseph,\" said Amelia, quite ready to kiss her brother,  if he were so minded.  (And I think for a kiss from such a dear  creature as Amelia, I would purchase all Mr. Lee's conservatories out  of hand.)    \"O heavenly, heavenly flowers!\" exclaimed Miss Sharp, and smelt them  delicately, and held them to her bosom, and cast up her eyes to the  ceiling, in an ecstasy of admiration.  Perhaps she just looked first  into the bouquet, to see whether there was a billet-doux hidden among  the flowers; but there was no letter.    \"Do they talk the language of flowers at Boggley Wollah, Sedley?\" asked  Osborne, laughing.    \"Pooh, nonsense!\" replied the sentimental youth. \"Bought 'em at  Nathan's; very glad you like 'em; and eh, Amelia, my dear, I bought a  pine-apple at the same time, which I gave to Sambo.  Let's have it for  tiffin; very cool and nice this hot weather.\" Rebecca said she had  never tasted a pine, and longed beyond everything to taste one.    So the conversation went on.  I don't know on what pretext Osborne left  the room, or why, presently, Amelia went away, perhaps to superintend  the slicing of the pine-apple; but Jos was left alone with Rebecca, who  had resumed her work, and the green silk and the shining needles were  quivering rapidly under her white slender fingers.    \"What a beautiful, BYOO-OOTIFUL song that was you sang last night, dear  Miss Sharp,\" said the Collector.  \"It made me cry almost; 'pon my  honour"]]]
