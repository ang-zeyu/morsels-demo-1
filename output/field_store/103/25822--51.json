He stopped, not wishing to startle her again. When she lifted her head  he expected to see her shrink and flee, but she did not do so; she only  grew a little paler and stood motionless, watching him intently.    Seeing this, he walked slowly towards her, and when he was so close  to her that he could hear the nervous flutter of her breath over her  parted, trembling lips, he said very gently,    \"Do not be afraid of me. I am a friend, and I do not wish to disturb or  annoy you in any way.\"    She seemed to hesitate a moment. Then she lifted a little slate that  hung at her belt, wrote something on it rapidly, and held it out to him.  He read, in a small distinctive handwriting,    \"I am not afraid of you now. Mother told me that all strange men were  very wicked and dangerous, but I do not think you can be. I have thought  a great deal about you, and I am sorry I ran away the other night.\"    He realized her entire innocence and simplicity. Looking earnestly into  her still troubled eyes he said,    \"I would not do you any harm for the world. All men are not wicked,  although it is too true that some are so. My name is Eric Marshall and  I am teaching in the Lindsay school. You, I think, are Kilmeny Gordon.  I thought your music so very lovely the other evening that I have been  wishing ever since that I might hear it again. Won't you play for me?\"    The vague fear had all gone from her eyes by this time, and suddenly she  smiled--a merry, girlish, wholly irresistible smile, which broke through  the calm of her face like a gleam of sunlight rippling over a placid  sea. Then she wrote, \"I am very sorry that I cannot play this evening.  I did not bring my violin with me. But I will bring it to-morrow evening  and play for you if you would like to hear me. I should like to please  you.\"    Again that note of innocent frankness! What a child she was--what a  beautiful, ignorant child, utterly unskilled in the art of hiding her  feelings! But why should she hide them? They were as pure and beautiful  as herself. Eric smiled back at her with equal frankness.    \"I should like it more than I can say, and I shall be sure to come  to-morrow evening if it is fine. But if it is at all damp or unpleasant  you must not come. In that case another evening will do. And now won't  you give me some flowers?\"    She nodded, with another little smile, and began to pick some of the  June lilies, carefully selecting the most perfect among them. He watched  her lithe, graceful motions with delight; every movement seemed poetry  itself. She looked like a very incarnation of Spring--as if all the  shimmer of young leaves and glow of young mornings and evanescent  sweetness of young blossoms in a thousand springs had been embodied in  her.    When she came to him, radiant, her hands full of the lilies, a couplet  from a favourite poem darted into his head--        \"A blossom vermeil white      That lightly breaks a faded flower sheath,      Here, by God's rood, is the one maid for me.\"    The next moment he was angry with himself for his folly. She was,  after all, nothing but a child--and a child set apart from her fellow  creatures by her sad defect. He must not let himself think nonsense.    \"Thank you. These June lilies are the sweetest flowers the spring brings  us. Do you know that their real name is the white narcissus?\" She looked  pleased and interested.    \"No, I did not know,\" she wrote. \"I have often read of the white  narcissus and wondered what it was like. I never thought of it being the  same as my dear June lilies. I am glad you told me. I love flowers very  much. They are my very good friends.\"    \"You couldn't help being friends with the lilies. Like always takes to  like,\" said Eric. \"Come and sit down on the old bench--here, where you  were sitting that night I frightened you so badly. I could not imagine  who or what you were. Sometimes I thought I had dreamed you--only,\" he  added under his breath and unheard by her, \"I could never have dreamed  anything half so lovely.\"    She sat down beside him on the old bench and looked unshrinkingly in his  face. There was no boldness in her glance--nothing but the most perfect,  childlike trust and confidence. If there had been any evil in his  heart--any skulking thought, he was afraid to acknowledge--those  eyes must have searched it out and shamed it. But he could meet them  unafraid. Then she wrote,    \"I was very much frightened. You must have thought me very silly, but I  had never seen any man except Uncle Thomas and Neil and the egg peddler.  And you are different from them--oh, very, very different. I was afraid  to come back here the next evening. And yet, somehow, I wanted to come.  I did not want you to think I did not know how to behave. I sent Neil  back for my bow in the morning. I could not do without it. I cannot  speak, you know. Are you sorry?\"    \"I am very sorry for your sake.\"    \"Yes, but what I mean is, would you like me better if I could speak like  other people?\"    \"No, it does not make any difference in that way, Kilmeny. By the way,  do you mind my calling you Kilmeny?\"    She looked puzzled and wrote, \"What else should you call me? That is my  name. Everybody calls me that.\"    \"But I am such a stranger to you that perhaps you would wish me to call  you Miss Gordon.\"    \"Oh, no, I would not like that,\" she wrote quickly, with a distressed  look on her face. \"Nobody ever calls me that. It would make me feel  as if I were not myself but somebody else. And you do not seem like a  stranger to me. Is there any reason why you should not call me Kilmeny?\"    \"No reason whatever, if you will allow me the privilege. You have a very  lovely name--the very name you ought to have.\"    \"I am glad you like it. Do you know that I was called after my  grandmother and she was called after a girl in a poem? Aunt Janet has  never liked my name, although she liked my grandmother. But I am glad  you like both my name and me. I was afraid you would not like me because  I cannot speak.\"    \"You can speak through your music, Kilmeny.\"    She looked pleased. \"How well you understand,\" she wrote. \"Yes, I cannot  speak or sing as other people can, but I can make my violin say things  for me.\"    \"Do you compose your own music?\" he asked. But he saw she did not  understand him. \"I mean, did any one ever teach you the music you played  here that evening?\"    \"Oh, no. It just came as I thought. It has always been that way. When I  was very little Neil taught me to hold the violin and the bow, and the  rest all came of itself. My violin once belonged to Neil, but he gave it  to me. Neil is very good and kind to me, but I like you better. Tell me  about yourself.\"    The wonder of her grew upon him with every passing moment. How lovely  she was! What dear little ways and gestures she had--ways and gestures  as artless and unstudied as they were effective. And how strangely  little her dumbness seemed to matter after all! She wrote so quickly and  easily, her eyes and smile gave such expression to her mobile face, that  voice was hardly missed.    They lingered in the orchard until the long, languid shadows of the  trees crept to their feet. It was just after sunset and the distant  hills were purple against the melting saffron of the sky in the west and  the crystalline blue of the sky in the south. Eastward, just over the  fir woods, were clouds, white and high heaped like snow mountains, and  the westernmost of them shone with a rosy glow as of sunset on an Alpine  height.    The higher worlds of air were still full of light--perfect, stainless  light, unmarred of earth shadow; but down in the orchard and under the  spruces the light had almost gone, giving place to a green, dewy dusk,  made passionately sweet with the breath of the apple blossoms and mint,  and the balsamic odours that rained down upon them from the firs.    Eric told her of his life, and the life in the great outer world, in  which she was girlishly and eagerly interested. She asked him many  questions about it--direct and incisive questions which showed that she  had already formed decided opinions and views about it. Yet it was plain  to be seen that she did not regard it as anything she might ever share  herself. Hers was the dispassionate interest with which she might have  listened to a tale of the land of fairy or of some great empire long  passed away from earth.    Eric discovered that she had read a great deal of poetry and history,  and a few books of biography and travel. She did not know what a  novel meant and had never heard of one. Curiously enough, she was well  informed regarding politics and current events, from the weekly paper  for which her uncle subscribed.    \"I never read the newspaper while mother was alive,\" she wrote, \"nor any  poetry either. She taught me to read and write and I read the Bible all  through many times and some of the histories. After mother died Aunt  Janet gave me all her books. She had a great many. Most of them had been  given to her as prizes when she was a girl at school, and some of them  had been given to her by my father. Do you know the story of my father  and mother?\"    Eric nodded.    \"Yes, Mrs. Williamson told me all about it. She was a friend of your  mother.\"    \"I am glad you have heard it. It is so sad that I would not like to tell  it, but you will understand everything better because you know. I never  heard it until just before mother died. Then she told me all. I think  she had thought father was to blame for the trouble; but before she died  she told me she believed that she had been unjust to him and that he  had not known. She said that when people were dying they saw things more  clearly and she saw she had made a mistake about father. She said she  had many more things she wanted to tell me, but she did not have time to  tell them because she died "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53416"],[0,"Only a Girl's Love (#9)"],[1,"something to eat, and to rest,  and to take her things off. Oh, come with me, miss! All the way from  Florence, and Mr. Harold's daughter!\"    \"Go with her, Stella,\" said the old man, \"and--and,\" he added, gently,  \"don't let her keep you long.\"    The infinite tenderness of the last words caused Stella to stop on her  way to the door; she came back, and, putting her arms around his neck,  kissed him.    Then she followed Mrs. Penfold up-stairs to her room, the good woman  talking the whole while in exclamatory sentences of astonishment.    \"And you are Mr. Harold's daughter. Did you see his portrait over the  mantel-shelf, miss? I should have known you by that, now I come to look  at you,\" and she looked with affectionate interest into the beautiful  face, as she helped Stella to take off her hat. \"Yes, I should have  known you, miss, in a moment? And you have come all the way from Italy?  Dear me, it is wonderful. And I'm very glad you have, it won't be so  lonely for Mr. Etheridge. And is there anything else you want, miss?  You must excuse me for bringing you into my own room; I'll have a room  ready for you to-night, your own room, and the luggage, miss----\"    Stella smiled and blushed faintly.    \"I have none, Mrs. Penfold. I ran--I left quite suddenly.\"    \"Dearie me!\" murmured Mrs. Penfold, puzzled and sympathetic. \"Well,  now, it doesn't matter so long as you are here, safe, and sound. And  now I'll go and get you something to eat! You can find your way down?\"    \"Yes,\" Stella said. She could find her way down. She stood for a moment  looking through the window, her long hair falling in a silky stream  down her white shoulders, and the soft, dreamy look came into her eyes.    \"Is it true?\" she murmured. \"Am I really here at home with someone to  love me--someone whom I can love? Or is it only a dream, and shall I  wake in the cold bare room and find that I have still to endure the old  life? No! It is no dream, it is true!\"    She wound up the long hair and went down to find that Mrs. Penfold had  already prepared the table, her uncle standing beside and waiting with  gentle impatience for her appearance.    He started as she entered, with a distinct feeling of renewed surprise;  the relief from uncertainty as to her welcome, the kindness of her  reception had already refreshed her, and her beauty shone out unclouded  by doubt or nervousness.    The old man's eyes wandered with artistic approval over the graceful  form and lovely face, and he was almost in the land of dreams again  when Mrs. Penfold roused him by setting a chair at the table, and  handing him a cobwebbed bottle and a corkscrew.    \"Miss Stella must be starving, sir!\" she said, suggestively.    \"Yes, yes,\" he assented, and both of them set to work exhorting  and encouraging her to eat, as if they feared she might drop under  the table with exhaustion unless she could be persuaded to eat of  everything on the table.    Mr. Etheridge seemed to place great faith in the old port as a  restorative, and had some difficulty in concealing his disappointment  when Stella, after sipping the first glass, declined any more on the  score that it was strong.    At last, but with visible reluctance, he accepted her assertion that  she was rescued from any chance of starvation, and Mrs. Penfold cleared  the table and left them alone.    A lamp stood on the table, but the moonbeams poured in through the  window, and instinctively Stella drew near the window.    \"What a lovely place it is, uncle!\" she said.    He did not answer, he was watching her musingly, as she leant against  the edge of the wall.    \"You must be very happy here.\"    \"Yes,\" he murmured, dreamily. \"Yes, and you think you will be, Stella.\"    \"Ah, yes,\" she answered, in a low voice, and with a low sigh. \"Happier  than I can say.\"    \"You will not feel it lonely, shut up with an old man, a dreamer, who  has parted with the world and almost forgotten it?\"    \"No, no! a thousand times no!\" was the reply.    He wandered to the fireplace and took up his pipe, but with a sudden  glance at her laid it down again. Slight as was the action she saw it,  and with the graceful, lithe movement which he had noticed, she glided  across the room and took up the pipe.    \"You were going to smoke, uncle.\"    \"No, no,\" he said, eagerly. \"No, a mere habit----\"    She interrupted him with a smile, and filled the pipe for him with her  taper little fingers, and gave it to him.    \"You do not want me to wish that I had not come to you uncle?\"    \"Heaven forbid!\" he said, simply.    \"Then you must not alter anything in your life; you must go on as if I  had never dropped from the clouds to be a burden upon you.\"    \"My child!\" he murmured, reproachfully.    \"Or to make you uncomfortable. I could not bear that, uncle.\"    \"No, no!\" he said, \"I will alter nothing, Stella; we will be happy, you  and I.\"    \"Very happy,\" she murmured, softly.    He wandered to the window, and stood looking out; and, unseen by him,  she drew a chair up and cleared it of the litter, and unconsciously he  sat down.    Then she glided to and fro, wandering round the room noiselessly,  looking at the curious lumber, and instinctively picking up the books  and putting them in something like order on the almost empty shelves.    Every now and then she took up one of the pictures which stood with  their faces to the wall, and her gaze would wander from it to the  painter sitting in the moonlight, his white hair falling on his  shoulders, his thin, nervous hands clasped on his knee.    She, who had spent her life in the most artistic city of the world,  knew that he was a great painter, and, child-woman as she was, wondered  why the world permitted him to remain unknown and unnoticed. She had  yet to learn that he cared as little for fame as he did for wealth,  and to be allowed to live for his art and dream in peace was all he  asked from the world in which he lived but in which he took no part.  Presently she came back to the window, and stood beside him; he started  slightly and put out his hand, and she put her thin white one into it.  The moon rose higher in the heavens, and the old man raised his other  hand and pointed to it in silence.    As he did so, Stella saw glide into the scene--as it was touched by  the moonbeams--a large white building rearing above the trees on the  hill-top, and she uttered an exclamation of surprise.    \"What house is that, uncle? I had no idea one was there until this  moment!\"    \"That is Wyndward Hall, Stella,\" he replied, dreamily; \"it was hidden  by the shadow and the clouds.\"    \"What a grand place!\" she murmured. \"Who lives there uncle?\"    \"The Wyndwards,\" he answered, in the same musing tone, \"the Wyndwards.  They have lived there for hundreds of years, Stella. Yes, it is a grand  place.\"    \"We should call it a palace in Italy, uncle.\"    \"It is a palace in England, but we are more modest. They are contented  to call it the Hall. An old place and an old race.\"    \"Tell me about them,\" she said, quietly. \"Do you know them--are they  friends of yours?\"    \"I know them. Yes, they are friends, as far as there be any friendship  between a poor painter and the Lord of Wyndward. Yes, we are friends;  they call them proud, but they are not too proud to ask James  Etheridge to dinner occasionally; and they accuse him of pride because  he declines to break the stillness of his life by accepting their  hospitality. Look to the left there, Stella. As far as you can see  stretch the lands of Wyndward--they run for miles between the hills  there.\"    \"They have some reason to be proud,\" she murmured, with a smile. \"But I  like them because they are kind to you.\"    He nodded.    \"Yes, the earl would be more than kind, I think----\"    \"The earl?\"    \"Yes, Lord Wyndward, the head of the family; the Lord of Wyndward they  call him. They have all been called Lords of Wyndward by the people  here, who look up to them as if they were something more than human.\"    \"And does he live there alone?\" she asked, gazing at the gray stone  mansion glistening in the moonlight.    \"No, there is a Lady Wyndward, and a daughter--poor girl.\"    \"Why do you say poor girl?\" asked Stella.    \"Because all the wealth of the race would not make her otherwise than  an object of tender pity. She is an invalid; you see that window--the  one with the light in it?\"    \"Yes,\" Stella said.    \"That is the window of her room; she lies there on a sofa, looking down  the valley all the day!\"          CHAPTER II.      \"Poor girl!\" murmured Stella. There was silence for a moment. \"And  those three live there all alone?\" she said.    \"Not always,\" he replied, musingly. \"Sometimes, not often, the son  Leycester comes down. He is Viscount Trevor.\"    \"The son,\" said Stella. \"And what is he like?\"    The question seemed to set some train of thought in action; the old man  relapsed into silence for a few minutes. Then suddenly but gently he  rose, and going to the other end of the room, fetched a picture from  amongst several standing against the wall, and held it toward her.    \"That is Lord Leycester,\" he said.    Stella took the canvas in her hand, and held it to the light, and an  exclamation broke involuntarily from her lips.    \"How beautiful he is!\"    The old man took the picture from her, and resting it on his knees,  gazed at it musingly.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"it is a grand face; one does not see such a face  often.\"    Stella leant over the chair and looked at it with a strange feeling of  interest and curiosity, such as no simply beautiful picture would have  aroused.    It was not the regularity of the face, with its clear-cut features  and its rippling chestnut hair, that, had it been worn by a Wyndward  of a hundred years ago, would have fallen in rich curls upon the  square, well-formed shoulders. It was not the beauty of the face, but a  something indefinable in the carriage of the head and the expression of  the full, dark"]]]
