For, after these things, it is not necessary for me to say anything  more with a view to explain the motion of the heart, except that when  its cavities are not full of blood, into these the blood of necessity  flows,--from the hollow vein into the right, and from the venous artery  into the left; because these two vessels are always full of blood, and  their orifices, which are turned towards the heart, cannot then be  closed.  But as soon as two drops of blood have thus passed, one into  each of the cavities, these drops which cannot but be very large,  because the orifices through which they pass are wide, and the vessels  from which they come full of blood, are immediately rarefied, and  dilated by the heat they meet with.  In this way they cause the whole  heart to expand, and at the same time press home and shut the five  small valves that are at the entrances of the two vessels from which  they flow, and thus prevent any more blood from coming down into the  heart, and becoming more and more rarefied, they push open the six  small valves that are in the orifices of the other two vessels, through  which they pass out, causing in this way all the branches of the  arterial vein and of the grand artery to expand almost simultaneously  with the heart which immediately thereafter begins to contract, as do  also the arteries, because the blood that has entered them has cooled,  and the six small valves close, and the five of the hollow vein and of  the venous artery open anew and allow a passage to other two drops of  blood, which cause the heart and the arteries again to expand as  before.  And, because the blood which thus enters into the heart passes  through these two pouches called auricles, it thence happens that their  motion is the contrary of that of the heart, and that when it expands  they contract.  But lest those who are ignorant of the force of  mathematical demonstrations and who are not accustomed to distinguish  true reasons from mere verisimilitudes, should venture, without  examination, to deny what has been said, I wish it to be considered  that the motion which I have now explained follows as necessarily from  the very arrangement of the parts, which may be observed in the heart  by the eye alone, and from the heat which may be felt with the fingers,  and from the nature of the blood as learned from experience, as does  the motion of a clock from the power, the situation, and shape of its  counterweights and wheels.    But if it be asked how it happens that the blood in the veins, flowing  in this way continually into the heart, is not exhausted, and why the  arteries do not become too full, since all the blood which passes  through the heart flows into them, I need only mention in reply what  has been written by a physician of England, who has the honor of having  broken the ice on this subject, and of having been the first to teach  that there are many small passages at the extremities of the arteries,  through which the blood received by them from the heart passes into the  small branches of the veins, whence it again returns to the heart; so  that its course amounts precisely to a perpetual circulation.  Of this  we have abundant proof in the ordinary experience of surgeons, who, by  binding the arm with a tie of moderate straitness above the part where  they open the vein, cause the blood to flow more copiously than it  would have done without any ligature; whereas quite the contrary would  happen were they to bind it below; that is, between the hand and the  opening, or were to make the ligature above the opening very tight.  For it is manifest that the tie, moderately straightened, while  adequate to hinder the blood already in the arm from returning towards  the heart by the veins, cannot on that account prevent new blood from  coming forward through the arteries, because these are situated below  the veins, and their coverings, from their greater consistency, are  more difficult to compress; and also that the blood which comes from  the heart tends to pass through them to the hand with greater force  than it does to return from the hand to the heart through the veins.  And since the latter current escapes from the arm by the opening made  in one of the veins, there must of necessity be certain passages below  the ligature, that is, towards the extremities of the arm through which  it can come thither from the arteries.  This physician likewise  abundantly establishes what he has advanced respecting the motion of  the blood, from the existence of certain pellicles, so disposed in  various places along the course of the veins, in the manner of small  valves, as not to permit the blood to pass from the middle of the body  towards the extremities, but only to return from the extremities to the  heart; and farther, from experience which shows that all the blood  which is in the body may flow out of it in a very short time through a  single artery that has been cut, even although this had been closely  tied in the immediate neighborhood of the heart and cut between the  heart and the ligature, so as to prevent the supposition that the blood  flowing out of it could come from any other quarter than the heart.    But there are many other circumstances which evince that what I have  alleged is the true cause of the motion of the blood:  thus, in the  first place, the difference that  is observed between the blood which  flows from the veins, and that from the arteries, can only arise from  this, that being rarefied, and, as it were, distilled by passing  through the heart, it is thinner, and more vivid, and warmer  immediately after leaving the heart, in other words, when in the  arteries, than it was a short time before passing into either, in other  words, when it was in the veins; and if attention be given, it will be  found that this difference is very marked only in the neighborhood of  the heart; and is not so evident in parts more remote from it.  In the  next place, the consistency of the coats of which the arterial vein and  the great artery are  composed, sufficiently shows that the blood is  impelled  against them with more force than against the veins.  And why  should the left cavity of the heart and the  great artery be wider and  larger than the right cavity and the arterial vein, were it not that  the blood of the  venous artery, having only been in the lungs after it  has passed through the heart, is thinner, and rarefies more readily,  and in a higher degree, than the blood which proceeds immediately from  the hollow vein?  And what can physicians conjecture from feeling the  pulse unless they know that according as the blood changes its nature  it can be rarefied by the warmth of the heart, in a higher or lower  degree, and more or less quickly than before?  And if it be inquired  how this heat is communicated to the other members, must it not be  admitted that this is effected by means of the blood, which, passing  through the heart, is there heated anew, and thence diffused over all  the body?  Whence it happens, that if the blood be withdrawn from any  part, the heat is likewise withdrawn by the same means; and although  the heart were as-hot as glowing iron, it would not be capable of  warming the feet and hands as at present, unless it continually sent  thither new blood.  We likewise perceive from this, that the true use  of respiration is to bring sufficient fresh air into the lungs, to  cause the blood which flows into them from the right ventricle of the  heart, where it has been rarefied and, as it were, changed into vapors,  to become thick, and to convert it anew into blood, before it flows  into the left cavity, without which process it would be unfit for the  nourishment of the fire that is there.  This receives confirmation from  the circumstance, that it is observed of animals destitute of lungs  that they have also but one cavity in the heart, and that in children  who cannot use them while in the womb, there is a hole through which  the blood flows from the hollow vein into the left cavity of the heart,  and a tube through which it passes from the arterial vein into the  grand artery without passing through the lung.  In the next place, how  could digestion be carried on in the stomach unless the heart  communicated heat to it through the arteries, and along with this  certain of the more fluid parts of the blood, which assist in the  dissolution of the food that has been taken in?  Is not also the  operation which converts the juice of food into blood easily  comprehended, when it is considered that it is distilled by passing and  repassing through the heart perhaps more than one or two hundred times  in a day?  And what more need be adduced to explain nutrition, and the  production of the different humors of the body, beyond saying, that the  force with which the blood, in being rarefied, passes from the heart  towards the extremities of the arteries, causes certain of its parts to  remain in the members at which they arrive, and there occupy the place  of some others expelled by them; and that according to the situation,  shape, or smallness of the pores with which they meet, some rather  than others flow into certain parts, in the same way that some sieves  are observed to act, which, by being variously perforated, serve to  separate different species of grain?  And, in the last place, what  above all is here worthy of observation, is the generation of the  animal spirits, which are like a very subtle wind, or rather a very  pure and vivid flame which, continually ascending in great abundance  from the heart to the brain, thence penetrates through the nerves into  the muscles, and gives motion to all the members; so that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/590"],[0,"Robert Louis Stevenson: A Record, an Estimate, and a Memorial (#9)"],[1,"hints of     him, in the world, but always cowards: he is as bold as a lion, but     with the same deadly, causeless duplicity I have watched with so much     surprise in my two cowards.  'Tis true, I saw a hint of the same     nature in another man who was not a coward; but he had other things to     attend to; the Master has nothing else but his devilry.\"    His wife grows seriously ill, and Stevenson has to turn to household  work.       \"Lloyd and I get breakfast; I have now, 10.15, just got the dishes     washed and the kitchen all clean, and sit down to give you as much     news as I have spirit for, after such an engagement.  Glass is a thing     that really breaks my spirit; and I do not like to fail, and with     glass I cannot reach the work of my high calling--the artist's.\"    In the midst of such domestic tasks and entanglements he writes _The  Master_, and very characteristically gets dissatisfied with the last  parts, \"which shame, perhaps degrade, the beginning.\"    Of Mr Kipling this is his judgment--in the year 1890:       \"Kipling is by far the most promising young man who has appeared     since--ahem--I appeared.  He amazes me by his precocity and various     endowments.  But he alarms me by his copiousness and haste.  He should     shield his fire with both hands, 'and draw up all his strength and     sweetness in one ball.'  ('Draw all his strength and all his sweetness     up into one ball'?  I cannot remember Marvell's words.)  So the     critics have been saying to me; but I was never capable of--and surely     never guilty of--such a debauch of production.  At this rate his works     will soon fill the habitable globe, and surely he was armed for better     conflicts than these succinct sketches and flying leaves of verse?  I     look on, I admire, I rejoice for myself; but in a kind of ambition we     all have for our tongue and literature I am wounded.  If I had this     man's fertility and courage, it seems to me I could heave a pyramid.       \"Well, we begin to be the old fogies now, and it was high time     _something_ rose to take our places.  Certainly Kipling has the gifts;     the fairy godmothers were all tipsy at his christening.  What will he     do with them?\"    Of the rest of Stevenson's career we cannot speak at length, nor is it  needful.  How in steady succession came his triumphs: came, too, his  trials from ill-health--how he spent winters at Davos Platz, Bournemouth,  and tried other places in America; and how, at last, good fortune led him  to the South Pacific.  After many voyagings and wanderings among the  islands, he settled near Apia, in Samoa, early in 1890, cleared some four  hundred acres, and built a house; where, while he wrote what delighted  the English-speaking race, he took on himself the defence of the natives  against foreign interlopers, writing under the title _A Footnote to  History_, the most powerful _expose_ of the mischief they had done and  were doing there.  He was the beloved of the natives, as he made himself  the friend of all with whom he came in contact.  There, as at home, he  worked--worked with the same determination and in the enjoyment of better  health.  The obtaining idea with him, up to the end, as it had been from  early life, was a brave, resolute, cheerful endeavour to make the best of  it.    \"I chose Samoa instead of Honolulu,\" he told Mr W. H. Trigg, who reports  the talk in _Cassells' Magazine_, \"for the simple and eminently  satisfactory reason that it is less civilised.  Can you not conceive that  it is awful fun?\"  His house was called \"Vailima,\" which means Five  Waters in the Samoan, and indicates the number of streams that flow by  the spot.          CHAPTER VII--THE VAILIMA LETTERS      The Vailima Letters, written to Mr Sidney Colvin and other friends, are  in their way delightful if not inimitable: and this, in spite of the idea  having occurred to him, that some use might hereafter be made of these  letters for publication purposes.  There is, indeed, as little trace of  any change in the style through this as well could be--the utterly  familiar, easy, almost child-like flow remains, unmarred by  self-consciousness or tendency \"to put it on.\"    In June, 1892, Stevenson says:       \"It came over me the other day suddenly that this diary of mine to you     would make good pickings after I am dead, and a man could make some     kind of a book out of it, without much trouble.  So for God's sake     don't lose them, and they will prove a piece of provision for 'my     floor old family,' as Simele calls it.\"    But their great charm remains: they are as free and gracious and serious  and playful and informal as before.  Stevenson's traits of character are  all here: his largeness of heart, his delicacy, his sympathy, his fun,  his pathos, his boylike frolicsomeness, his fine courage, his love of the  sea (for he was by nature a sailor), his passion for action and adventure  despite his ill-health, his great patience with others and fine  adaptability to their temper (he says that he never gets out of temper  with those he has to do with), his unbounded, big-hearted hopefulness,  and fine perseverance in face of difficulties.  What could be better than  the way in which he tells that in January, 1892, when he had a bout of  influenza and was dictating _St Ives_ to his stepdaughter, Mrs Strong, he  was \"reduced to dictating to her in the deaf-and-dumb alphabet\"?--and  goes on:       \"The amanuensis has her head quite turned, and believes herself to be     the author of this novel [_and is to some extent_.--A.M.] and as the     creature (!) has not been wholly useless in the matter [_I told you     so_!--A.M.] I propose to foster her vanity by a little commemoration     gift! . . . I shall tell you on some other occasion, and when the A.M.     is out of hearing, how _very_ much I propose to invest in this     testimonial; but I may as well inform you at once that I intend it to     be cheap, sir--damned cheap!  My idea of running amanuenses is by     praise, not pudding, flattery, and not coins.\"    Truly, a rare and rich nature which could thus draw sunshine out of its  trials!--which, by aid of the true philosopher's stone of cheerfulness  and courage, could transmute the heavy dust and clay to gold.    His interests are so wide that he is sometimes pulled in different and  conflicting directions, as in the contest between his desire to aid  Mataafa and the other chiefs, and his literary work--between letters to  the _Times_ about Samoan politics, and, say, _David Balfour_.  Here is a  characteristic bit in that strain:       \"I have a good dose of the devil in my pipestem atomy; I have had my     little holiday outing in my kick at _The Young Chevalier_, and I guess     I can settle to _David Balfour_, to-morrow or Friday like a little     man.  I wonder if any one had ever more energy upon so little     strength?  I know there is a frost; . . . but I mean to break that     frost inside two years, and pull off a big success, and Vanity     whispers in my ear that I have the strength.  If I haven't, whistle     owre the lave o't!  I can do without glory, and perhaps the time is     not far off when I can do without corn.  It is a time coming soon     enough, anyway; and I have endured some two and forty years without     public shame, and had a good time as I did it.  If only I could secure     a violent death, what a fine success!  I wish to die in my boots; no     more Land of Counterpane for me.  To be drowned, to be shot, to be     thrown from a horse--ay, to be hanged, rather than pass again through     that slow dissolution.\"    He would not consent to act the invalid unless the spring ran down  altogether; was keen for exercise and for mixing among men--his native  servants if no others were near by.  Here is a bit of confession and  casuistry quite _a la_ Stevenson:       \"To come down covered with mud and drenched with sweat and rain after     some hours in the bush, change, rub down, and take a chair in the     verandah, is to taste a quiet conscience.  And the strange thing that     I mark is this: If I go out and make sixpence, bossing my labourers     and plying the cutlass or the spade, idiot conscience applauds me; if     I sit in the house and make twenty pounds, idiot conscience wails over     my neglect and the day wasted.\"    His relish for companionship is indeed strong.  At one place he says:       \"God knows I don't care who I chum with perhaps I like sailors best,     but to go round and sue and sneak to keep a crowd together--never!\"    If Stevenson's natural bent was to be an explorer, a mountain-climber, or  a sailor--to sail wide seas, or to range on mountain-tops to gain free  and extensive views--yet he inclines well to farmer work, and indeed, has  to confess it has a rare attraction for him.       \"I went crazy over outdoor work,\" he says at one place, \"and had at     last to confine myself to the house, or literature must have gone by     the board.  _Nothing_ is so interesting as weeding, clearing, and path-     making: the oversight of labourers becomes a disease.  It is quite an     effort not to drop into the farmer; and it does make you feel so     well.\"    The odd ways of these Samoans, their pride of position, their vices,  their virtues, their vanities, their small thefts, their tricks, their  delightful _insouciance_ sometimes, all amused him.  He found in them a  fine field of study and observation--a source of fun and fund of  humanity--as this bit about the theft of some piglings will sufficiently  prove:       \"Last night three piglings were stolen from one of our pig-pens.  The     great Lafaele appeared to my wife uneasy, so she engaged him in     conversation on the subject, and played upon him the following     engaging trick: You advance your two forefingers towards the sitter's     eyes; he closes them, whereupon you substitute (on his eyelids) the     fore"]]]
