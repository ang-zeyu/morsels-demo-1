Reckon he didn't set out exactly hoping to meet us, though. Tam's a  lady's man in comparison,\" but loyal to his comrade above his amusement,  he added warmly: \"You can't beat Jack by much, though, when it comes to  sticking to a pal,\" unconscious that he was prophesying of the years to  come, when the missus had become one of those pals.    \"There's only the Dandy left now,\" Mac went on, as we spun along an ever  more definite track, \"and he'll be all right as soon as he gets used to  it. Never knew such a chap for finding something decent in everybody  he strikes.\" Naturally I hoped he would \"find something decent in me,\"  having learned what it meant to the stockmen to have a woman pitchforked  into their daily lives, when those lives were to be lived side by side,  in camp, or in saddle, or at the homestead.      Mac hesitated a moment, and then out flashed one of his happy  inspirations. \"Don't you bother about the Dandy,\" he said; \"bushmen have  a sixth sense, and know a pal when they see one.\"    Just a bushman's pretty speech, aimed straight at the heart of a woman,  where all the pretty speeches of the bushfolk are aimed; for it is by  the heart that they judge us. \"Only a pal,\" they will say, towering  strong and protecting; and the woman feels uplifted, even though in the  same breath they have honestly agreed with her, after careful scrutiny,  that it is not her fault that she was born into the plain sisterhood.  Bushmen will risk their lives for a woman pal or otherwise but leave her  to pick up her own handkerchief.      \"Of course!\" Mac added, as an afterthought. \"It's not often they find a  pal in a woman\"; and I add to-day that when they do, that woman is to be  envied her friends.    \"Eyes front!\" Mac shouted suddenly, and in a moment the homestead was  in sight, and the front gate forty-five miles behind us. \"If ever you  DO reach the homestead alive,\" the Darwin ladies had said; and now they  were three hundred miles away from us to the north-west.    \"Sam's spotted us!\" Mac smiled as we skimmed on, and a slim little  Chinaman ran across between the buildings. \"We'd better do the thing  in style,\" and whipping up the horses, he whirled them through the  open slip-rails, past the stockyards, away across the grassy homestead  enclosure, and pulled up with a rattle of hoofs and wheels at the head  of a little avenue of buildings.    The Dandy, fresh and spotless, appeared in a doorway; black boys sprang  up like a crop of mushrooms and took charge of the buck-board; Dan  rattled in with the pack-teams, and horses were jangling hobbles and  rattling harness all about us, as I found myself standing in the shadow  of a queer, unfinished building, with the Maluka and Mac surrounded by a  mob of leaping, bounding dogs, flourishing, as best they could, another  \"Welcome home!\"    \"Well?\" Mac asked, beating off dogs at every turn. \"Is it a House or a  Hut?\"    \"A Betwixt and Between,\" we decided; and then the Dandy was presented,  And the steady grey eyes apparently finding \"something decent\" in the  missus, with a welcoming smile and ready tact he said: \"I'm sure we're  all real glad to see you.\" Just the tiniest emphasis on the word \"you\";  but that, and the quick, bright look that accompanied the emphasis,  told, as nothing else could, that it was \"that other woman\" that had  not been wanted. Unconventional, of course; but when a welcome is  conventional out-bush, it is unworthy of the name of welcome.    The Maluka, knew this well, but before he could speak, Mac had seized a  little half-grown dog--the most persistent of all the leaping dogs--by  her tightly curled-up tail, and, setting her down at my feet, said: \"And  this is Tiddle'ums,\" adding, with another flourishing bow, \"A present  from a Brither Scot,\" while Tiddle'ums in no way resented the dignity.  Having a tail that curled tightly over her back like a cup handle, she  expected to be lifted up by it.    Then one after the other Mac presented the station dogs: Quart-Pot,  Drover, Tuppence, Misery, Buller, and a dozen others; and as I bowed  gravely to each in turn Dan chuckled in appreciation: \"She'll do! Told  you she was the dead finish.\"    Then the introductions over, the Maluka said: \"Ann, now I suppose she  may consider herself just 'One of Us.'\"        CHAPTER VI      The homestead, standing half-way up the slope that rose from  the billabong, had, after all, little of that \"down-at-heels,  anything'll-do\" appearance that Mac had so scathingly described. No one  could call it a \"commodious station home,\" and it was even patched up  and shabby; but, for all that, neat and cared for. An orderly little  array of one-roomed buildings, mostly built of sawn slabs, and ranged  round a broad oblong space with a precision that suggested the idea of a  section of a street cut out from some neat compact little village.    The cook's quarters, kitchens, men's quarters, store, meat-house, and  waggon-house, facing each other on either side of this oblong space,  formed a short avenue-the main thoroughfare of the homestead--the centre  of which was occupied by an immense wood-heap, the favourite gossiping  place of some of the old black fellows, while across the western end  of it, and looking down it, but a little aloof from the rest of the  buildings, stood the house, or, rather, as much of it as had been  rebuilt after the cyclone of 1897. As befitted their social positions  the forge and black boys' \"humpy\" kept a respectful distance well round  the south-eastern corner of this thoroughfare; but, for some  unknown reason, the fowl-roosts had been erected over Sam Lee's  sleeping-quarters. That comprised this tiny homestead of a million and  a quarter acres, with the Katherine Settlement a hundred miles to the  north of it, one neighbour ninety miles to the east, another, a hundred  and five to the south, and others about two hundred to the west.    Unfortunately, Mac's description of the House had been only too correct.  With the exception of the one roughly finished room at its eastern end,  it was \"mostly verandahs and promises.\"    After the cyclone had wrecked the building, scattering timber and sheets  of iron in all directions, everything had lain exactly where it had  fallen for some weeks, at the mercy of the wind and weather. At the end  of those weeks a travelling Chinese carpenter arrived at the station  with such excellent common-sense ideas of what a bush homestead should  be, that he had been engaged to rebuild it.    His plans showed a wide-roofed building, built upon two-foot piles, with  two large centre rooms opening into each other and surrounded by a deep  verandah on every side; while two small rooms, a bathroom and an office,  were to nestle each under one of the eastern corners of this deep  twelve-foot verandah. Without a doubt excellent common-sense ideas; but,  unfortunately, much larger than the supply of timber. Rough-hewn posts  for the two-foot piles and verandah supports could be had for the  cutting, and therefore did not give out; but the man used joists and  uprights with such reckless extravagance, that by the time the skeleton  of the building was up, the completion of the contract was impossible.  With philosophical indifference, however, he finished one room  completely; left a second a mere outline of uprights and tye-beams;  apparently forgot all about the bathroom and office; covered the whole  roof, including verandahs, with corrugated iron; surveyed his work with  a certain amount of stolid satisfaction; then announcing that \"wood  bin finissem,\" applied for his cheque and departed; and from that  day nothing further has been done to the House, which stood before us  \"mostly verandahs and promises.\"        Although Mac's description of the House had been apt, he had sadly  underrated the furniture. There were FOUR chairs, all \"up\" to my weight,  while two of them were up to the Maluka's. The cane was all gone,  certainly, but had been replaced with green-hide seats (not green  in colour, of course, only green in experience, never having seen a  tan-pit). In addition to the chairs, the dining-table, the four-poster  bed, the wire mattress, and the looking glass, there was a solid deal  side table, made from the side of a packing-case, with four solid legs  and a solid shelf underneath, also a remarkably steady washstand that  had no ware of any description, and a remarkably unsteady chest of four  drawers, one of which refused to open, while the other three refused to  shut. Further, the dining-table was more than \"fairly\" steady, three of  the legs being perfectly sound, and it therefore only threatened to fall  over when leaned upon. And lastly, although most of the plates and all  the cups were enamel ware, there was almost a complete dinner service  in china. The teapot, however, was tin, and, as Mac said, as \"big as a  house.\"    As for the walls, not only were the \"works of art\" there, but they  themselves were uniquely dotted from ceiling to floor with the muddy  imprints of dogs' feet--not left there by a Pegasus breed of winged  dogs, but made by the muddy feet of the station dogs, as they pattered  over the timber, when it lay awaiting the carpenter, and no one had seen  any necessity to remove them. Outside the verandahs, and all around the  house, was what was to be known later as the garden, a grassy stretch  of hillocky ground, well scratched and beaten down by dogs, goats,  and fowls; fenceless itself, being part of the grassy acres which were  themselves fenced round to form the homestead enclosures. Just inside  this enclosure, forming, in fact, the south-western barrier of it,  stood the \"billabong,\" then a spreading sheet of water; along its banks  flourished the vegetable garden; outside the enclosure, towards the  south-eas"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/470"],[0,"Heretics (#9)"],[1,"themselves to have destroyed, of the  discoveries that their forbears made.  Like the modern English, they  are beginning to be soft about their own hardness. They are becoming  conscious of their own strength--that is, they are growing weaker.  But  one purely modern man has emerged in the strictly modern decades who  does carry into our world the clear personal simplicity of the old  world of science.  One man of genius we have who is an artist, but who  was a man of science, and who seems to be marked above all things with  this great scientific humility. I mean Mr. H. G. Wells.  And in his  case, as in the others above spoken of, there must be a great  preliminary difficulty in convincing the ordinary person that such a  virtue is predicable of such a man. Mr. Wells began his literary work  with violent visions--visions of the last pangs of this planet; can it  be that a man who begins with violent visions is humble?  He went on to  wilder and wilder stories about carving beasts into men and shooting  angels like birds. Is the man who shoots angels and carves beasts into  men humble? Since then he has done something bolder than either of  these blasphemies; he has prophesied the political future of all men;  prophesied it with aggressive authority and a ringing decision of  detail. Is the prophet of the future of all men humble?  It will indeed  be difficult, in the present condition of current thought about such  things as pride and humility, to answer the query of how a man can be  humble who does such big things and such bold things. For the only  answer is the answer which I gave at the beginning of this essay.  It  is the humble man who does the big things. It is the humble man who  does the bold things.  It is the humble man who has the sensational  sights vouchsafed to him, and this for three obvious reasons:  first,  that he strains his eyes more than any other men to see them; second,  that he is more overwhelmed and uplifted with them when they come;  third, that he records them more exactly and sincerely and with less  adulteration from his more commonplace and more conceited everyday  self. Adventures are to those to whom they are most unexpected--that  is, most romantic.  Adventures are to the shy:  in this sense  adventures are to the unadventurous.    Now, this arresting, mental humility in Mr. H. G. Wells may be, like a  great many other things that are vital and vivid, difficult to  illustrate by examples, but if I were asked for an example of it, I  should have no difficulty about which example to begin with. The most  interesting thing about Mr. H. G. Wells is that he is the only one of  his many brilliant contemporaries who has not stopped growing.  One can  lie awake at night and hear him grow. Of this growth the most evident  manifestation is indeed a gradual change of opinions; but it is no mere  change of opinions. It is not a perpetual leaping from one position to  another like that of Mr. George Moore.  It is a quite continuous  advance along a quite solid road in a quite definable direction.  But  the chief proof that it is not a piece of fickleness and vanity is the  fact that it has been upon the whole an advance from more startling  opinions to more humdrum opinions.  It has been even in some sense an  advance from unconventional opinions to conventional opinions. This  fact fixes Mr. Wells's honesty and proves him to be no poseur. Mr.  Wells once held that the upper classes and the lower classes would be  so much differentiated in the future that one class would eat the  other.  Certainly no paradoxical charlatan who had once found arguments  for so startling a view would ever have deserted it except for  something yet more startling.  Mr. Wells has deserted it in favour of  the blameless belief that both classes will be ultimately subordinated  or assimilated to a sort of scientific middle class, a class of  engineers.  He has abandoned the sensational theory with the same  honourable gravity and simplicity with which he adopted it. Then he  thought it was true; now he thinks it is not true. He has come to the  most dreadful conclusion a literary man can come to, the conclusion  that the ordinary view is the right one. It is only the last and  wildest kind of courage that can stand on a tower before ten thousand  people and tell them that twice two is four.    Mr. H. G. Wells exists at present in a gay and exhilarating progress of  conservativism.  He is finding out more and more that conventions,  though silent, are alive.  As good an example as any of this humility  and sanity of his may be found in his change of view on the subject of  science and marriage.  He once held, I believe, the opinion which some  singular sociologists still hold, that human creatures could  successfully be paired and bred after the manner of dogs or horses.  He  no longer holds that view. Not only does he no longer hold that view,  but he has written about it in \"Mankind in the Making\" with such  smashing sense and humour, that I find it difficult to believe that  anybody else can hold it either. It is true that his chief objection to  the proposal is that it is physically impossible, which seems to me a  very slight objection, and almost negligible compared with the others.  The one objection to scientific marriage which is worthy of final  attention is simply that such a thing could only be imposed on  unthinkable slaves and cowards.  I do not know whether the scientific  marriage-mongers are right (as they say) or wrong (as Mr. Wells says)  in saying that medical supervision would produce strong and healthy  men. I am only certain that if it did, the first act of the strong and  healthy men would be to smash the medical supervision.    The mistake of all that medical talk lies in the very fact that it  connects the idea of health with the idea of care.  What has health to  do with care?  Health has to do with carelessness.  In special and  abnormal cases it is necessary to have care.  When we are peculiarly  unhealthy it may be necessary to be careful in order to be healthy. But  even then we are only trying to be healthy in order to be careless. If  we are doctors we are speaking to exceptionally sick men, and they  ought to be told to be careful.  But when we are sociologists we are  addressing the normal man, we are addressing humanity. And humanity  ought to be told to be recklessness itself. For all the fundamental  functions of a healthy man ought emphatically to be performed with  pleasure and for pleasure; they emphatically ought not to be performed  with precaution or for precaution. A man ought to eat because he has a  good appetite to satisfy, and emphatically not because he has a body to  sustain.  A man ought to take exercise not because he is too fat, but  because he loves foils or horses or high mountains, and loves them for  their own sake. And a man ought to marry because he has fallen in love,  and emphatically not because the world requires to be populated. The  food will really renovate his tissues as long as he is not thinking  about his tissues.  The exercise will really get him into training so  long as he is thinking about something else.  And the marriage will  really stand some chance of producing a generous-blooded generation if  it had its origin in its own natural and generous excitement. It is the  first law of health that our necessities should not be accepted as  necessities; they should be accepted as luxuries. Let us, then, be  careful about the small things, such as a scratch or a slight illness,  or anything that can be managed with care. But in the name of all  sanity, let us be careless about the important things, such as  marriage, or the fountain of our very life will fail.    Mr. Wells, however, is not quite clear enough of the narrower  scientific outlook to see that there are some things which actually  ought not to be scientific.  He is still slightly affected with the  great scientific fallacy; I mean the habit of beginning not with the  human soul, which is the first thing a man learns about, but with some  such thing as protoplasm, which is about the last. The one defect in  his splendid mental equipment is that he does not sufficiently allow  for the stuff or material of men. In his new Utopia he says, for  instance, that a chief point of the Utopia will be a disbelief in  original sin.  If he had begun with the human soul--that is, if he had  begun on himself--he would have found original sin almost the first  thing to be believed in. He would have found, to put the matter  shortly, that a permanent possibility of selfishness arises from the  mere fact of having a self, and not from any accidents of education or  ill-treatment. And the weakness of all Utopias is this, that they take  the greatest difficulty of man and assume it to be overcome, and then  give an elaborate account of the overcoming of the smaller ones. They  first assume that no man will want more than his share, and then are  very ingenious in explaining whether his share will be delivered by  motor-car or balloon.  And an even stronger example of Mr. Wells's  indifference to the human psychology can be found in his  cosmopolitanism, the abolition in his Utopia of all patriotic  boundaries.  He says in his innocent way that Utopia must be a  world-state, or else people might make war on it. It does not seem to  occur to him that, for a good many of us, if it were a world-state we  should still make war on it to the end of the world. For if we admit  that there must be varieties in art or opinion what sense is there in  thinking there will not be varieties in government? The fact is very  simple.  Unless you are going deliberately to prevent a thing being  good, you cannot prevent it being worth fighting for. It is impossible  to prevent a possible conflict of civilizations, because it is  impossible to prevent a possible conflict between ideals. If there were  no longer "]]]
