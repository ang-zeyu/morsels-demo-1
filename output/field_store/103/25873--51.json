He did, in fact, live till  after the close of his brother's reign, and succeeded him, under the  title of James the Second. His being thus in the direct line of  succession made his father and mother very desirous of effecting his  rescue, while the Parliament were strongly desirous, for the same  reason, of keeping him safely. His governor received, therefore, a  special charge to take the most effectual precautions to prevent his  escape, and, for this purpose, not to allow of his having any  communication whatever with his parents or his absent friends. The  governor took all necessary measures to prevent such intercourse, and,  as an additional precaution, made James _promise_ that he would not  receive any letter from any person unless it came through him.    James's mother, however, not knowing these circumstances, wrote a  letter to him, and sent it by a trusty messenger, directing him to  watch for some opportunity to deliver it unobserved. Now there is a  certain game of ball, called _tennis_, which was formerly a favorite  amusement in England and on the Continent of Europe, and which, in  fact, continues to be played there still. It requires an oblong  enclosure, surrounded by high walls, against which the balls rebound.  Such an enclosure is called a tennis court. It was customary to build  such tennis courts in most of the royal palaces. There was one at St.  James's Palace, where the young James, it seems, used sometimes to  play. [Footnote: It was to such a tennis court at Versailles that the  great National Assembly of France adjourned when the king excluded  them from their hall, at the commencement of the great Revolution, and  where they took the famous oath not to separate till they had  established a constitution, which has been so celebrated in history  as the Oath of the Tennis Court.] Strangers had the opportunity of  seeing the young prince in his coming and going to and from this place  of amusement, and the queen's messenger determined to offer him the  letter there. He accordingly tendered it to him stealthily, as he was  passing, saying, \"Take this; it is from your mother.\"    James drew back, replying, \"I can not take it. I have promised that  I will not.\"    The messenger reported to the queen that he offered the letter to  James, and that he refused to receive it. His mother was very much  displeased, and wondered what such a strange refusal could mean.    Although James thus failed to receive his communication, he was allowed  at length, once or twice, to have an interview with his father, and  in these interviews the king recommended to him to make his escape,  if he could, and to join his mother in France. James determined to  obey this injunction, and immediately set to work to plan his escape.  He was fifteen years of age, and, of course, old enough to exercise  some little invention.    He was accustomed, as we have already stated, to join the younger  children in games of hide and go seek. He began now to search for the  most recondite hiding places, where he could not be found, and when  he had concealed himself in such a place, he would remain there for  a very long time, until his playmates had given up the search in  despair. Then, at length, after having been missing for half an hour,  he would reappear of his own accord. He thought that by this plan he  should get the children and the attendants accustomed to his being for  a long time out of sight, so that, when at length he should finally  disappear, their attention would not be seriously attracted to the  circumstance until he should have had time to get well set out upon  his journey.    He had, like his mother, a little dog, but, unlike her, he was not so  strongly attached to it as to be willing to endanger his life to avoid  a separation. When the time arrived, therefore, to set out on his  secret journey, he locked the dog up in his room, to prevent its  following him, and thus increasing the probability of his being  recognized and brought back. He then engaged his brother and sister  and his other playmates in the palace in a game of hide and go seek.  He went off ostensibly to hide, but, instead of doing so, he stole out  of the palace gates in company with a friend named Banfield, and a  footman. It was in the rear of the palace that he made his exit, at  a sort of postern gate, which opened upon an extensive park. After  crossing the park, the party hurried on through London, and then  directed their course down the River Thames toward Gravesend, a port  near the mouth of the river, where they intended to embark for Holland.  They had taken the precaution to disguise themselves. James wore a  wig, which, changing the color and appearance of his hair, seemed to  give a totally new expression to his face. He substituted other clothes,  too, for those which he was usually accustomed to wear. The whole party  succeeded thus in traversing the country without detection. They reached  Gravesend, embarked on board a vessel there, and sailed to Holland,  where James joined the Prince of Orange and his sister, and sent word  to his mother that he had arrived there in safety.    His little brother and sister were left behind. They were too young  to fly themselves, and too old to be conveyed away, as little Henrietta  had been, in the arms of another. They had, however, the mournful  satisfaction of seeing their father just before his execution, and of  bidding him a last farewell. The king, when he was condemned to die,  begged to be allowed to see these children. They were brought to visit  him in the chamber where he was confined. His parting interview with  them, and the messages of affection and farewell which he sent to their  brothers and sisters, and to their mother, constitute one of the most  affecting scenes which the telescope of history brings to our view,  in that long and distant vista of the past, which it enables us so  fully to explore. The little Gloucester was too young to understand  the sorrows of the hour, but Elizabeth felt them in all their intensity.  She was twelve years old. When brought to her father, she burst into  tears, and wept long and bitterly. Her little brother, sympathizing  in his sister's sorrow, though not comprehending its cause, wept  bitterly too. Elizabeth was thoughtful enough to write an account of  what took place at this most solemn farewell as soon as it was over.  Her account is as follows:    \"_What the king said to me on the 29th of January, 1648, the last time  I had the happiness to see him_.    \"He told me that he was glad I was come, for, though he had not time  to say much, yet somewhat he wished to say to me, which he could not  to another, and he had feared 'the cruelty' was too great to permit  his writing. 'But, darling,' he added, 'thou wilt forget what I tell  thee.' Then, shedding an abundance of tears, I told him that I would  write down all he said to me. 'He wished me,' he said, 'not to grieve  and torment myself for him, for it was a glorious death he should die,  it being for the laws and religion of the land.' He told me what books  to read against popery. He said 'that he had forgiven all his enemies,  and he hoped God would forgive them also;' and he commanded us, and  all the rest of my brothers and sisters, to forgive them too. Above  all, he bade me tell my mother 'that his thoughts had never strayed  from her, and that his love for her would be the same to the last;'  withal, he commanded me (and my brother) to love her and be obedient  to her. He desired me 'not to grieve for him, for he should die a  martyr, and that he doubted not but God would restore the throne to  his son, and that then we should be all happier than we could possibly  have been if he had lived.'    \"Then taking my brother Gloucester on his knee, he said, 'Dear boy, now  will they cut off thy father's head.' Upon which the child looked very  steadfastly upon him. 'Heed, my child, what I say; they will cut off  my head, and perhaps make thee a king; but, mark what I say! You must  not be a king as long as your brothers Charles and James live;  therefore, I charge you, do not be made a king by them.' At which the  child, sighing deeply, replied, 'I will be torn in pieces first.' And  these words, coining so unexpectedly from so young a child, rejoiced  my father exceedingly. And his majesty spoke to him of the welfare of  his soul, and to keep his religion, commanding him to fear God, and  he would provide for him; all which the young child earnestly promised  to do.\"    After the king's death the Parliament kept these children in custody  for some time, and at last they became somewhat perplexed to know what  to do with them. It was even proposed, when Cromwell's Republican  government had become fully established, to bind them out apprentices,  to learn some useful trade. This plan was, however, not carried into  effect. They were held as prisoners, and sent at last to Carisbrooke  Castle, where their father had been confined. Little Henry, too young  to understand his sorrows, grew in strength and stature, like any other  boy; but Elizabeth pined and sunk under the burden of her woes. She  mourned incessantly her father's cruel death, her mother's and her  brother's exile, and her own wearisome and hopeless captivity. \"Little  Harry\", as she called him, and a Bible, which her father gave her in  his last interview with her, were her only companions. She lingered  along for two years after her father's death, until at length the  hectic flush, the signal of approaching dissolution, appeared upon her  cheek, and an unnatural brilliancy brightened in her eyes. They sent  her father's physician to see if he could save her. His prescriptions  did no good. One day the attendants came into her apartment and found  her sitting in her chair, with her cheek resting upon the Bible"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6675"],[0,"The Loss of the S. S. Titanic: Its Story and Its Lessons (#9)"],[1,"him, the spike dragging along the floor. This must have been  about 12.40 A.M. I suppose the band must have begun to play soon after  this and gone on until after 2 A.M. Many brave things were done that  night, but none more brave than by those few men playing minute after  minute as the ship settled quietly lower and lower in the sea and the  sea rose higher and higher to where they stood; the music they played  serving alike as their own immortal requiem and their right to be  recorded on the rolls of undying fame.    Looking forward and downward, we could see several of the boats now in  the water, moving slowly one by one from the side, without confusion  or noise, and stealing away in the darkness which swallowed them in  turn as the crew bent to the oars. An officer--I think First Officer  Murdock--came striding along the deck, clad in a long coat, from his  manner and face evidently in great agitation, but determined and  resolute; he looked over the side and shouted to the boats being  lowered: \"Lower away, and when afloat, row around to the gangway and  wait for orders.\" \"Aye, aye, sir,\" was the reply; and the officer  passed by and went across the ship to the port side.    Almost immediately after this, I heard a cry from below of, \"Any more  ladies?\" and looking over the edge of the deck, saw boat 13 swinging  level with the rail of B deck, with the crew, some stokers, a few men  passengers and the rest ladies,--the latter being about half the total  number; the boat was almost full and just about to be lowered. The  call for ladies was repeated twice again, but apparently there were  none to be found. Just then one of the crew looked up and saw me  looking over. \"Any ladies on your deck?\" he said. \"No,\" I replied.  \"Then you had better jump.\" I sat on the edge of the deck with my feet  over, threw the dressing-gown (which I had carried on my arm all of  the time) into the boat, dropped, and fell in the boat near the stern.    As I picked myself up, I heard a shout: \"Wait a moment, here are two  more ladies,\" and they were pushed hurriedly over the side and tumbled  into the boat, one into the middle and one next to me in the stern.  They told me afterwards that they had been assembled on a lower deck  with other ladies, and had come up to B deck not by the usual stairway  inside, but by one of the vertically upright iron ladders that connect  each deck with the one below it, meant for the use of sailors passing  about the ship. Other ladies had been in front of them and got up  quickly, but these two were delayed a long time by the fact that one  of them--the one that was helped first over the side into boat 13 near  the middle--was not at all active: it seemed almost impossible for her  to climb up a vertical ladder. We saw her trying to climb the swinging  rope ladder up the Carpathia's side a few hours later, and she had the  same difficulty.    As they tumbled in, the crew shouted, \"Lower away\"; but before the  order was obeyed, a man with his wife and a baby came quickly to the  side: the baby was handed to the lady in the stern, the mother got in  near the middle and the father at the last moment dropped in as the  boat began its journey down to the sea many feet below.          CHAPTER IV    THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC SEEN FROM A LIFEBOAT      Looking back now on the descent of our boat down the ship's side, it  is a matter of surprise, I think, to all the occupants to remember how  little they thought of it at the time. It was a great adventure,  certainly: it was exciting to feel the boat sink by jerks, foot by  foot, as the ropes were paid out from above and shrieked as they  passed through the pulley blocks, the new ropes and gear creaking  under the strain of a boat laden with people, and the crew calling to  the sailors above as the boat tilted slightly, now at one end, now at  the other, \"Lower aft!\" \"Lower stern!\" and \"Lower together!\" as she  came level again--but I do not think we felt much apprehension about  reaching the water safely. It certainly was thrilling to see the black  hull of the ship on one side and the sea, seventy feet below, on the  other, or to pass down by cabins and saloons brilliantly lighted; but  we knew nothing of the apprehension felt in the minds of some of the  officers whether the boats and lowering-gear would stand the strain of  the weight of our sixty people. The ropes, however, were new and  strong, and the boat did not buckle in the middle as an older boat  might have done. Whether it was right or not to lower boats full of  people to the water,--and it seems likely it was not,--I think there  can be nothing but the highest praise given to the officers and crew  above for the way in which they lowered the boats one after the other  safely to the water; it may seem a simple matter, to read about such a  thing, but any sailor knows, apparently, that it is not so. An  experienced officer has told me that he has seen a boat lowered in  practice from a ship's deck, with a trained crew and no passengers in  the boat, with practised sailors paying out the ropes, in daylight, in  calm weather, with the ship lying in dock--and has seen the boat tilt  over and pitch the crew headlong into the sea. Contrast these  conditions with those obtaining that Monday morning at 12.45 A.M., and  it is impossible not to feel that, whether the lowering crew were  trained or not, whether they had or had not drilled since coming on  board, they did their duty in a way that argues the greatest  efficiency. I cannot help feeling the deepest gratitude to the two  sailors who stood at the ropes above and lowered us to the sea: I do  not suppose they were saved.    Perhaps one explanation of our feeling little sense of the unusual in  leaving the Titanic in this way was that it seemed the climax to a  series of extraordinary occurrences: the magnitude of the whole thing  dwarfed events that in the ordinary way would seem to be full of  imminent peril. It is easy to imagine it,--a voyage of four days on a  calm sea, without a single untoward incident; the presumption, perhaps  already mentally half realized, that we should be ashore in  forty-eight hours and so complete a splendid voyage,--and then to feel  the engine stop, to be summoned on deck with little time to dress, to  tie on a lifebelt, to see rockets shooting aloft in call for help, to  be told to get into a lifeboat,--after all these things, it did not  seem much to feel the boat sinking down to the sea: it was the natural  sequence of previous events, and we had learned in the last hour to  take things just as they came. At the same time, if any one should  wonder what the sensation is like, it is quite easy to measure  seventy-five feet from the windows of a tall house or a block of  flats, look down to the ground and fancy himself with some sixty other  people crowded into a boat so tightly that he could not sit down or  move about, and then picture the boat sinking down in a continuous  series of jerks, as the sailors pay out the ropes through cleats  above. There are more pleasant sensations than this! How thankful we  were that the sea was calm and the Titanic lay so steadily and quietly  as we dropped down her side. We were spared the bumping and grinding  against the side which so often accompanies the launching of boats: I  do not remember that we even had to fend off our boat while we were  trying to get free.    As we went down, one of the crew shouted, \"We are just over the  condenser exhaust: we don't want to stay in that long or we shall be  swamped; feel down on the floor and be ready to pull up the pin which  lets the ropes free as soon as we are afloat.\" I had often looked over  the side and noticed this stream of water coming out of the side of  the Titanic just above the water-line: in fact so large was the volume  of water that as we ploughed along and met the waves coming towards  us, this stream would cause a splash that sent spray flying. We felt,  as well as we could in the crowd of people, on the floor, along the  sides, with no idea where the pin could be found,--and none of the  crew knew where it was, only of its existence somewhere,--but we never  found it. And all the time we got closer to the sea and the exhaust  roared nearer and nearer--until finally we floated with the ropes  still holding us from above, the exhaust washing us away and the force  of the tide driving us back against the side,--the latter not of much  account in influencing the direction, however. Thinking over what  followed, I imagine we must have touched the water with the condenser  stream at our bows, and not in the middle as I thought at one time: at  any rate, the resultant of these three forces was that we were carried  parallel to the ship, directly under the place where boat 15 would  drop from her davits into the sea. Looking up we saw her already  coming down rapidly from B deck: she must have filled almost  immediately after ours. We shouted up, \"Stop lowering 14,\" [Footnote:  In an account which appeared in the newspapers of April 19 I have  described this boat as 14, not knowing they were numbered  alternately.] and the crew and passengers in the boat above, hearing  us shout and seeing our position immediately below them, shouted the  same to the sailors on the boat deck; but apparently they did not  hear, for she dropped down foot by foot,--twenty feet, fifteen,  ten,--and a stoker and I in the bows reached up and touched her bottom  swinging above our heads, trying to push away our boat from under her.  It seemed now as if nothing could prevent her dropping on us, but at  this moment another stoker sprang with his knife to the ropes that  still held us and I heard him shout, \"One! Two!\" as he cut them  through. The next moment we had swung away from underneath 15, and  were clear of her as she dropped into the water in the space we had  just before occupied. I do not know how the bow ropes were"]]]
