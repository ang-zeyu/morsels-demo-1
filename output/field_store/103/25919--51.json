[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7524"],[0,"The Germany and the Agricola of Tacitus (#9)"],[1," to have it appear that he had found the  legion obedient, than that he had made it so.    8. Vettius Bolanus was at that time governor of Britain, and ruled with  a milder sway than was suitable to so turbulent a province. Under his  administration, Agricola, accustomed to obey, and taught to consult  utility as well as glory, tempered his ardor, and restrained his  enterprising spirit. His virtues had soon a larger field for their  display, from the appointment of Petilius Cerealis, [31] a man of  consular dignity, to the government. At first he only shared the  fatigues and dangers of his general; but was presently allowed to  partake of his glory. Cerealis frequently entrusted him with part of his  army as a trial of his abilities; and from the event sometimes enlarged  his command. On these occasions, Agricola was never ostentatious  in assuming to himself the merit of his exploits; but always, as a  subordinate officer, gave the honor of his good fortune to his superior.  Thus, by his spirit in executing orders, and his modesty in reporting  his success, he avoided envy, yet did not fail of acquiring reputation.    9. On his return from commanding the legion he was raised by Vespasian  to the patrician order, and then invested with the government of  Aquitania, [32] a distinguished promotion, both in respect to the office  itself, and the hopes of the consulate to which it destined him. It is a  common supposition that military men, habituated to the unscrupulous and  summary processes of camps, where things are carried with a strong hand,  are deficient in the address and subtlety of genius requisite in civil  jurisdiction. Agricola, however, by his natural prudence, was enabled to  act with facility and precision even among civilians. He distinguished  the hours of business from those of relaxation. When the court or  tribunal demanded his presence, he was grave, intent, awful, yet  generally inclined to lenity. When the duties of his office were  over, the man of power was instantly laid aside. Nothing of sternness,  arrogance, or rapaciousness appeared; and, what was a singular felicity,  his affability did not impair his authority, nor his severity render him  less beloved. To mention integrity and freedom from corruption in such  a man, would be an affront to his virtues. He did not even court  reputation, an object to which men of worth frequently sacrifice,  by ostentation or artifice: equally avoiding competition with, his  colleagues, [33] and contention with the procurators. To overcome in  such a contest he thought inglorious; and to be put down, a disgrace.  Somewhat less than three years were spent in this office, when he was  recalled to the immediate prospect of the consulate; while at the same  time a popular opinion prevailed that the government of Britain would be  conferred upon him; an opinion not founded upon any suggestions of his  own, but upon his being thought equal to the station. Common fame does  not always err, sometimes it even directs a choice. When consul, [34]  he contracted his daughter, a lady already of the happiest promise,  to myself, then a very young man; and after his office was expired  I received her in marriage. He was immediately appointed governor of  Britain, and the pontificate [35] was added to his other dignities.    10. The situation and inhabitants of Britain have been described by many  writers; [36] and I shall not add to the number with the view of vying  with them in accuracy and ingenuity, but because it was first thoroughly  subdued in the period of the present history. Those things which, while  yet unascertained, they embellished with their eloquence, shall here be  related with a faithful adherence to known facts. Britain, the largest  of all the islands which have come within the knowledge of the Romans,  stretches on the east towards Germany, on the west towards Spain, [37]  and on the south it is even within sight of Gaul. Its northern extremity  has no opposite land, but is washed by a wide and open sea. Livy, the  most eloquent of ancient, and Fabius Rusticus, of modern writers, have  likened the figure of Britain to an oblong target, or a two-edged axe.  [38] And this is in reality its appearance, exclusive of Caledonia;  whence it has been popularly attributed to the whole island. But that  tract of country, irregularly stretching out to an immense length  towards the furthest shore, is gradually contracted in form of a wedge.  [39] The Roman fleet, at this period first sailing round this remotest  coast, gave certain proof that Britain was an island; and at the same  time discovered and subdued the Orcades, [40] islands till then unknown.  Thule [41] was also distinctly seen, which winter and eternal snow had  hitherto concealed. The sea is reported to be sluggish and laborious to  the rower; and even to be scarcely agitated by winds. The cause of this  stagnation I imagine to be the deficiency of land and mountains where  tempests are generated; and the difficulty with which such a mighty mass  of waters, in an uninterrupted main, is put in motion. [42] It is not  the business of this work to investigate the nature of the ocean and  the tides; a subject which many writers have already undertaken. I shall  only add one circumstance: that the dominion of the sea is nowhere more  extensive; that it carries many currents in this direction and in that;  and its ebbings and flowings are not confined to the shore, but it  penetrates into the heart of the country, and works its way among hills  and mountains, as though it were in its own domain. [43]    11. Who were the first inhabitants of Britain, whether indigenous [44]  or immigrants, is a question involved in the obscurity usual among  barbarians. Their temperament of body is various, whence deductions are  formed of their different origin. Thus, the ruddy hair and large limbs  of the Caledonians [45] point out a German derivation. The swarthy  complexion and curled hair of the Silures, [46] together with their  situation opposite to Spain, render it probable that a colony of the  ancient Iberi [47] possessed themselves of that territory. They who are  nearest Gaul [48] resemble the inhabitants of that country; whether from  the duration of hereditary influence, or whether it be that when  lands jut forward in opposite directions, [49] climate gives the same  condition of body to the inhabitants of both. On a general survey,  however, it appears probable that the Gauls originally took possession  of the neighboring coast. The sacred rites and superstitions [50] of  these people are discernible among the Britons. The languages of the two  nations do not greatly differ. The same audacity in provoking danger,  and irresolution in facing it when present, is observable in both. The  Britons, however, display more ferocity, [51] not being yet softened  by a long peace: for it appears from history that the Gauls were once  renowned in war, till, losing their valor with their liberty, languor  and indolence entered amongst them. The same change has also taken place  among those of the Britons who have been long subdued; [52] but the rest  continue such as the Gauls formerly were.    12. Their military strength consists in infantry; some nations also make  use of chariots in war; in the management of which, the most honorable  person guides the reins, while his dependents fight from the chariot.  [53] The Britons were formerly governed by kings, [54] but at present  they are divided in factions and parties among their chiefs; and this  want of union for concerting some general plan is the most favorable  circumstance to us, in our designs against so powerful a people. It  is seldom that two or three communities concur in repelling the common  danger; and thus, while they engage singly, they are all subdued. The  sky in this country is deformed by clouds and frequent rains; but the  cold is never extremely rigorous. [55] The length of the days greatly  exceeds that in our part of the world. [56] The nights are bright, and,  at the extremity of the island, so short, that the close and return  of day is scarcely distinguished by a perceptible interval. It is even  asserted that, when clouds do not intervene, the splendor of the sun is  visible during the whole night, and that it does not appear to rise and  set, but to move across. [57] The cause of this is, that the extreme  and flat parts of the earth, casting a low shadow, do not throw up the  darkness, and so night falls beneath the sky and the stars. [58] The  soil, though improper for the olive, the vine, and other productions of  warmer climates, is fertile, and suitable for corn. Growth is quick,  but maturation slow; both from the same cause, the great humidity of the  ground and the atmosphere. [59] The earth yields gold and silver [60]  and other metals, the rewards of victory. The ocean produces pearls,  [61] but of a cloudy and livid hue; which some impute to unskilfulness  in the gatherers; for in the Red Sea the fish are plucked from the rocks  alive and vigorous, but in Britain they are collected as the sea throws  them up. For my own part, I can more readily conceive that the defect is  in the nature of the pearls, than in our avarice.    13. The Britons cheerfully submit to levies, tributes, and the other  services of government, if they are not treated injuriously; but such  treatment they bear with impatience, their subjection only extending to  obedience, not to servitude. Accordingly Julius Caesar, [62] the first  Roman who entered Britain with an army, although he terrified the  inhabitants by a successful engagement, and became master of the shore,  may be considered rather to have transmitted the discovery than the  possession of the country to posterity. The civil wars soon succeeded;  the arms of the leaders were turned against their country; and a long  neglect of Britain ensued, which continued even after the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/754"],[0,"The Story of Mankind (#9)"],[1,"was the place where he was born; where he  had spent his earliest years playing hide and seek amidst the forbidden  rocks of the Acropolis; where he had grown into manhood with a thousand  other boys and girls, whose nicknames were as familiar to him as those  of your own schoolmates. His Fatherland was the holy soil where his  father and mother lay buried. It was the small house within the high  city-walls where his wife and children lived in safety. It was a  complete world which covered no more than four or five acres of rocky  land. Don't you see how these surroundings must have influenced a man  in everything he did and said and thought? The people of Babylon and  Assyria and Egypt had been part of a vast mob. They had been lost in  the multitude. The Greek on the other hand had never lost touch with  his immediate surroundings. He never ceased to be part of a little  town where everybody knew every one else. He felt that his intelligent  neighbours were watching him. Whatever he did, whether he wrote plays  or made statues out of marble or composed songs, he remembered that his  efforts were going to be judged by all the free-born citizens of his  home-town who knew about such things. This knowledge forced him to  strive after perfection, and perfection, as he had been taught from  childhood, was not possible without moderation.    In this hard school, the Greeks learned to excel in many things. They  created new forms of government and new forms of literature and new  ideals in art which we have never been able to surpass. They performed  these miracles in little villages that covered less ground than four or  five modern city blocks.    And look, what finally happened!    In the fourth century before our era, Alexander of Macedonia conquered  the world. As soon as he had done with fighting, Alexander decided that  he must bestow the benefits of the true Greek genius upon all mankind.  He took it away from the little cities and the little villages and tried  to make it blossom and bear fruit amidst the vast royal residences of  his newly acquired Empire. But the Greeks, removed from the familiar  sight of their own temples, removed from the well-known sounds and  smells of their own crooked streets, at once lost the cheerful joy and  the marvellous sense of moderation which had inspired the work of  their hands and brains while they laboured for the glory of their old  city-states. They became cheap artisans, content with second-rate work.  The day the little city-states of old Hellas lost their independence and  were forced to become part of a big nation, the old Greek spirit died.  And it has been dead ever since.          GREEK SELF-GOVERNMENT    THE GREEKS WERE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO TRY THE DIFFICULT EXPERIMENT OF  SELF-GOVERNMENT      IN the beginning, all the Greeks had been equally rich and equally poor.  Every man had owned a certain number of cows and sheep. His mud-hut had  been his castle. He had been free to come and go as he wished. Whenever  it was necessary to discuss matters of public importance, all the  citizens had gathered in the market-place. One of the older men of the  village was elected chairman and it was his duty to see that everybody  had a chance to express his views. In case of war, a particularly  energetic and self-confident villager was chosen commander-in-chief, but  the same people who had voluntarily given this man the right to be  their leader, claimed an equal right to deprive him of his job, once the  danger had been averted.    But gradually the village had grown into a city. Some people had worked  hard and others had been lazy. A few had been unlucky and still others  had been just plain dishonest in dealing with their neighbours and had  gathered wealth. As a result, the city no longer consisted of a number  of men who were equally well-off. On the contrary it was inhabited by a  small class of very rich people and a large class of very poor ones.    There had been another change. The old commander-in-chief who had been  willingly recognised as \"headman\" or \"King\" because he knew how to lead  his men to victory, had disappeared from the scene. His place had been  taken by the nobles--a class of rich people who during the course of  time had got hold of an undue share of the farms and estates.    These nobles enjoyed many advantages over the common crowd of freemen.  They were able to buy the best weapons which were to be found on the  market of the eastern Mediterranean. They had much spare time in which  they could practise the art of fighting. They lived in strongly  built houses and they could hire soldiers to fight for them. They were  constantly quarrelling among each other to decide who should rule the  city. The victorious nobleman then assumed a sort of Kingship over all  his neighbours and governed the town until he in turn was killed or  driven away by still another ambitious nobleman.    Such a King, by the grace of his soldiers, was called a \"Tyrant\" and  during the seventh and sixth centuries before our era every Greek city  was for a time ruled by such Tyrants, many of whom, by the way, happened  to be exceedingly capa-ble men. But in the long run, this state of  affairs became unbearable. Then attempts were made to bring about  reforms and out of these reforms grew the first democratic government of  which the world has a record.    It was early in the seventh century that the people of Athens decided to  do some housecleaning and give the large number of freemen once more a  voice in the government as they were supposed to have had in the days  of their Achaean ancestors. They asked a man by the name of Draco to  provide them with a set of laws that would protect the poor against  the aggressions of the rich. Draco set to work. Unfortunately he was a  professional lawyer and very much out of touch with ordinary life. In  his eyes a crime was a crime and when he had finished his code, the  people of Athens discovered that these Draconian laws were so severe  that they could not possibly be put into effect. There would not have  been rope enough to hang all the criminals under their new system of  jurisprudence which made the stealing of an apple a capital offence.    The Athenians looked about for a more humane reformer. At last they  found some one who could do that sort of thing better than anybody else.  His name was Solon. He belonged to a noble family and he had travelled  all over the world and had studied the forms of government of many other  countries. After a careful study of the subject, Solon gave Athens a set  of laws which bore testimony to that wonderful principle of moderation  which was part of the Greek character. He tried to improve the condition  of the peasant without however destroying the prosperity of the nobles  who were (or rather who could be) of such great service to the state as  soldiers. To protect the poorer classes against abuse on the part of  the judges (who were always elected from the class of the nobles because  they received no salary) Solon made a provision whereby a citizen with a  grievance had the right to state his case before a jury of thirty of his  fellow Athenians.    Most important of all, Solon forced the average freeman to take a direct  and personal interest in the affairs of the city. No longer could he  stay at home and say \"oh, I am too busy today\" or \"it is raining and I  had better stay indoors.\" He was expected to do his share; to be at the  meeting of the town council; and carry part of the responsibility for  the safety and the prosperity of the state.    This government by the \"demos,\" the people, was often far from  successful. There was too much idle talk. There were too many hateful  and spiteful scenes between rivals for official honor. But it taught  the Greek people to be independent and to rely upon themselves for their  salvation and that was a very good thing.          GREEK LIFE    HOW THE GREEKS LIVED      BUT how, you will ask, did the ancient Greeks have time to look after  their families and their business if they were forever running to the  market-place to discuss affairs of state? In this chapter I shall tell  you.    In all matters of government, the Greek democracy recognised only one  class of citizens--the freemen. Every Greek city was composed of a small  number of free born citizens, a large number of slaves and a sprinkling  of foreigners.    At rare intervals (usually during a war, when men were needed for the  army) the Greeks showed themselves willing to confer the rights of  citizenship upon the \"barbarians\" as they called the foreigners. But  this was an exception. Citizenship was a matter of birth. You were an  Athenian because your father and your grandfather had been Athenians  before you. But however great your merits as a trader or a soldier, if  you were born of non-Athenian parents, you remained a \"foreigner\" until  the end of time.    The Greek city, therefore, whenever it was not ruled by a king or a  tyrant, was run by and for the freemen, and this would not have been  possible without a large army of slaves who outnumbered the free  citizens at the rate of six or five to one and who performed those tasks  to which we modern people must devote most of our time and energy if we  wish to provide for our families and pay the rent of our apartments.  The slaves did all the cooking and baking and candlestick making of the  entire city. They were the tailors and the carpenters and the jewelers  and the school-teachers and the bookkeepers and they tended the store  and looked after the factory while the master went to the public meeting  to discuss questions of war and peace or visited the theatre to see the  latest play of AEschylus or hear a discussion of the revolutionary  ideas of Euripides, who had dared to express certain doubts upon the  omnipotence of the great god Zeus.    Indeed, ancient Athens resembled a modern club. All the freeborn"]]]
