In fact, the rampant boys behaved  thus badly for the very reason that they were seated together instead of  with their respective families; and not until the fashion was universal of  each family sitting in a pew or group by itself did the boys in meeting  behave like human beings rather than like mischievous and unruly monkeys.    In Stratford, in 1668, a tithingman was \"appointed to watch over the youths  of disorderly carriage, and see that they behave themselves comelie, and  use such raps and blows as in his discretion meet.\"    I like to think of those rows of sober-faced Puritan boys seated on the  narrow, steep pulpit stairs, clad in knee-breeches and homespun flapped  coats, and with round, cropped heads, miniature likenesses in dress and  countenance (if not in deportment) of their grave, stern, God-fearing  fathers. Though they were of the sedate Puritan blood, they were boys, and  they wriggled and twisted, and scraped their feet noisily on the sanded  floor; and I know full well that the square-toed shoes of one in whom  \"original sin\" waxed powerful, thrust many a sly dig in the ribs and back  of the luckless wight who chanced to sit in front of and below him on the  pulpit stairs. Many a dried kernel of Indian corn was surreptitiously  snapped at the head of an unwary neighbor, and many a sly word was  whispered and many a furtive but audible \"snicker\" elicited when the dread  tithingman was \"having an eye-out\" and administering \"discreet raps and  blows\" elsewhere.    One of these wicked youths in Andover was brought before the magistrate,  and it was charged that he \"Sported and played and by Indecent Gestures and  Wry Faces caused laughter and misbehavior in the Beholders.\" The girls were  not one whit better behaved. One of \"ye tything men chosen of ye town of  Norwich\" reported that \"Tabatha Morgus of s'd Norwich Did on ye 24th day  February it being Sabbath on ye Lordes Day, prophane ye Lordes Day in ye  meeting house of ye west society in ye time of ye forenoone service on s'd  Day by her rude and Indecent Behaviour in Laughing and Playing in ye time  of ye s'd Service which Doinges of ye s'd Tabatha is against ye peace of  our Sovereign Lord ye King, his Crown and Dignity.\" Wanton Tabatha had to  pay three shilings sixpence for her ill-timed mid-winter frolic. Perhaps  she laughed to try to keep warm. Those who laughed at the misdemeanors of  others were fined as well. Deborah Bangs, a young girl, in 1755 paid a fine  of five shillings for \"Larfing in the Wareham Meeting House in time of  Public Worship,\" and a boy at the same time, for the same offence, paid a  fine of ten shillings. He may have laughed louder and longer. In a law-book  in which Jonathan Trumbull recorded the minor cases which he tried as  justice of the peace, was found this entry: \"His Majesties Tithing man  entered complaint against Jona. and Susan Smith, that on the Lords Day  during Divine Service, they did _smile_.\" They were found guilty, and  each was fined five shillings and costs,--poor smiling Susan and Jonathan.    Those wretched Puritan boys, those \"sons of Belial,\" whittled, too, and cut  the woodwork and benches of the meeting-house in those early days, just as  their descendants have ever since hacked and cut the benches and desks in  country schoolhouses,--though how they ever eluded the vigilant eye and ear  of the ubiquitous tithingman long enough to whittle will ever remain an  unsolved mystery of the past. This early forerunning evidence of what  has become a characteristic Yankee trait and habit was so annoyingly and  extensively exhibited in Medford, in 1729, that an order was passed to  prosecute and punish \"all who cut the seats in the meeting-house.\"    Few towns were content to have one tithingman and one staff, but ordered  that there should be a guardian set over the boys in every corner of the  meeting-house. In Hanover it was ordered \"That there be some sticks set up  in various places in the meeting-house, and fit persons by them and _to  use them_.\" I doubt not that the sticks were well used, and Hanover boys  were well rapped in meeting.    The Norwalk people come down through history shining with a halo of gentle  lenity, for their tithingman was ordered to bear a short, small stick only,  and he was \"Desired to use it with clemency.\" However, if any boy proved  \"incoridgable,\" he could be \"presented\" before the elders; and perhaps he  would rather have been treated as were Hartford boys by cruel Hartford  church folk, who ordered that if \"any boye shall be taken playing or  misbehaving himself in the time of publick worship whether in the  meeting-house or about the walls he shall be examined and punished at the  present publickly before the assembly depart.\" Parson Chauncey, of Durham,  when a boy misbehaved in meeting, and was \"punched up\" by the tithingman,  often stopped in his sermon, called the godless young offender by name,  and asked him to come to the parsonage the next day. Some very tender and  beautiful lessons were taught to these Durham boys at these Monday morning  interviews, and have descended to us in tradition; and the good Mr.  Chauncey stands out a shining light of Christian patience and forbearance  at a time when every other New England minister, from John Cotton down,  preached and practised the stern repression and sharp correction of all  children, and chanted together in solemn chorus, \"Foolishness is bound up  in the heart of a child.\"    One vicious tithingman invented, and was allowed to exercise on the boys,  a punishment which was the refinement of cruelty. He walked up to the  laughing, sporting, or whittling boy, took him by the collar or the arm,  led him ostentatiously across the meeting-house, and seated him by his  shamefaced mother on the women's side. It was as if one grandly proud in  kneebreeches should be forced to walk abroad in petticoats. Far rather  would the disgraced boy have been whacked soundly with the heavy knob of  the tithingman's staff; for bodily pain is soon forgotten, while mortifying  abasement lingers long.    The tithingman could also take any older youth who misbehaved or \"acted  unsivill\" in meeting from his manly seat with the grown men, and force him  to sit again with the boys; \"if any over sixteen are disorderly, they shall  be ordered to said seats.\" Not only could these men of authority keep the  boys in order during meeting, but they also had full control during the  nooning, and repressed and restrained and vigorously corrected the luckless  boys during the midday hours. When seats in the galleries grew to be  regarded as inferior to seats and pews on the ground floor, the boys, who  of course must have the worst place in the house, were relegated from the  pulpit stairs to pews in the gallery, and these square, shut-off pews grew  to be what Dr. Porter called \"the Devil's play-houses,\" and turbulent  outbursts were frequent enough.    The little boys still sat downstairs under their parents' watchful eyes.  \"No child under 10 alowed to go up Gailary.\" In the Sutherland church, if  the big boys (who ought to have known better) \"behaved unseemly,\" one of  the tithing-men who \"took turns to set in the Galary\" was ordered \"to bring  Such Bois out of the Galary & set them before the Deacon's Seat\" with the  small boys. In Plainfield, Connecticut, the \"pestigeous\" boys managed to  invent a new form of annoyance,--they \"damnified the glass;\" and a church  regulation had to be passed to prevent, or rather to try to prevent them  from \"opening the windows or in any way damnifying the glass.\" It was  doubtless hot work scuffling and wrestling in the close, shut-in pews high  up under the roof, and they naturally wished to cool down by opening or  breaking the windows. Grown persons could not inconsiderately open the  church windows either. \"The Constables are desired to _take notic_  of the persons that open the windows in the tyme of publick worship.\" No  rheumatic-y draughts, no bronchitis-y damps, no pure air was allowed to  enter the New England meeting-house. The church doubtless took a vote  before it allowed a single window to be opened.    In Westfield, Massachusetts, the boys became so abominably rampant that the  church formally decided \"that if there is not a Reformation Respecting  the Disorders in the Pews built on the Great Beam in the time of Publick  Worship the comite can pul it down.\"    The fashion of seating the boys in pews by themselves was slow of  abolishment in many of the churches. In Windsor, Connecticut, \"boys' pews\"  were a feature of the church until 1845. As years rolled on, the tithingmen  became restricted in their authority: they could no longer administer \"raps  and blows;\" they were forced to content themselves with loud rappings on  the floor, and pointing with a staff or with a condemning finger at the  misdemeanant. At last the deacons usurped these functions, and if rapping  and pointing did not answer the purpose of establishing order (if the boy  \"psisted\"), led the stubborn offender out of meeting; and they had full  authority soundly to thrash the \"wretched boy\" on the horse-block. Rev. Dr.  Dakin tells the story that, hearing a terrible noise and disturbance while  he was praying in a church in Quincy, he felt constrained to open his eyes  to ascertain the cause thereof; and he beheld a red-haired boy firmly  clutching the railing on the front edge of the gallery, while a venerable  deacon as firmly clutched the boy. The young rebel held fast, and the  correcting deacon held fast also, until at last the balustrade gave way,  and boy, deacon, and railing fell together with a resounding crash.  Then, rising from the wooden debris, the thoroughly subdued boy and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8675"],[0,"Welsh Fairy-Tales and Other Stories (#9)"],[1,"flowers.    So the bear went up to the dwarf, and the dwarf, when he saw him coming,  said:    \"Ah! good bear! good bear! let me go. These two girls will be a more  dainty morsel for you.\"    But the bear smote him with his paw and killed him, and immediately the  bear was turned into his former self, and the girls ran up and kissed  him, and talked.    Then he took the two girls to the dwarf's cave, and gave each of them a  bag of treasure, keeping one for himself. And taking the belt, he put it  on, and they all walked back to the hamlet, when he told the fishermen  that their troubles would soon be over--but that he must kill the witch  first.    Then he turned the belt three times, and said:    \"I wish for the queen fairy.\"    And she came, and was delighted, and said: \"Now you must come and slay  the witch,\" and she handed him a bow and arrow, telling him to use it  right and tight when he got to the hut.    So he went off to the wood, and found the witch in her hut, and she  begged for mercy.    \"Oh no, you have done too much mischief,\" he said, and he shot her.    Then the queen fairy appeared, and sent him to gather dry wood to make  a fire. When the fire was made she sent him to fetch the witch's wand,  which she cast into the flames, saying:    \"Now, mark my word, all the devils of hell will be here.\"    And when the wand began to burn all the devils came and tried to snatch  it from the fire, but the queen raised her wand, saying:      \"Through this powerful wand    that I hold in my hand,    Through this bow and arrow    I have caused her to be slain,    That she may leave our domain.    Now take her up high    into the sky,    And let her burst asunder    as a clap of thunder.    Then take her to hell    and there let her dwell,    To all eternity.\"    And the wand was burnt, and the devils carried the witch off in a noise  like thunder.    The twelve months were up on that day, and the fairy said to the  fisherman:    \"Take your chief and your brother, and put out to sea half-a-mile, where  you'll see a red spot, bright as the sun on the water; cast in your net  on the sea-side of the spot, and pull to the shore.\"    They did as the queen commanded, and when they pulled the net on the  shore they found the copper vessel.    \"Now open it,\" said the queen to the fisherman with the belt, \"but cover  your belt with your coat first.\"    And he did so, and when he opened the copper a ball of smoke rose into  the air, and suddenly the merman stood before them, and said:      \"The first four months that I was in prison,    I swore I'd make the man as rich as a king,    The man who released me.    But there was no release, no release, no release.      The second four months that I was in prison,    I swore I'd make the water run red,    But there was no release, no release, no release.      The last four months that I was in prison,    I swore in my wrath I'd take my deliverer's life,    Whoever he might be.\"    Whereupon the fisherman opened his coat and showed him the belt. Then  the merman immediately cooled down, and said:    \"Oh, that's how I came into this trouble.\"    Then he asked the fisherman with the belt what had happened, and he told  him the whole story.    Then the queen told the fisherman to take the girdle off and put it back  on the merman, and he did so; and suddenly the merman took to the sea,  and began to sing from a rock:      _\"As I sit upon the rock,    I am like a statue block,    And I straighten my hair,    That is so long and fair.    And now my eyes look bright,    For I am in great delight,    Because I am free in glee,    To roam over the sea.\"_    After that the hamlet was joyful again, for the fishermen began to catch  plenty of fish; for the merman showed them where to cast their nets, by  colouring the water as of old.    And the two brothers married the chief's two beautiful daughters, and  they lived happily ever afterwards.          THE PASTOR'S NURSE.    Mon pere etait tres jeune encore quand il est entre au saint ministere  et qu'il fut nomme pasteur a Hambach, village de la Lorraine. L'endroit  etait assez grand, mais de peu de ressources, et il etait heureux de  trouver quelqu'un qui, dans son inexperience et loin de sa famille,  fut capable de lui aider a fonder sa maison, selon les usages et les  traditions d'un bon presbytere.    C'est Madame Catherine Reeb, personne d'un age mur, dont le mari avait  ete instituteur, mais qui d'une nature mecontente et orgueilleuse, se  croyait au-dessus de sa sphere, et faisait sentir a sa pauvre femme, qui  l'aimait d'un devouement admirable, toutes les tortures que l'egoisme  peut inventer. Elle se donna a peine le necessaire pour procurer a son  seigneur et maitre tous les soins que sa superiorite imaginaire pouvait  exiger, et pourtant il ne fut jamais content, et un beau jour  disparut, sans qu'on put retrouver ses traces. La pauvre Catherine fut  inconsolable, mais ne perdit pas l'espoir qu'un jour son mari ne revint,  charge de tous les honneurs, qu'elle aussi, bonne ame credule, lui  croyait dus.    C'est dans ces conditions qu'elle vint tenir le menage de mon pere, elle  le fit avec beaucoup de tact et de douceur, mais tout en elle respirait  la tristesse, l'abandon. Quand, apres quelques annees, mon pere se  maria, Catherine continua son activite dans la maison, mais avec son bon  sens naturel, en refera la responsabilite a sa jeune maitresse, qu'elle  aimait beaucoup.    Ma mere chercha par bien des moyens a la distraire de son chagrin. Elle  devint plus gaie, quand elle nous raconta des histoires et fit des jeux  avec nous. Nos parents se faisaient un plaisir de l'observer parfois  quand elle ne s'endouta pas, se disant: \"Voila ce qu'il fallait a notre  vieille Catherine, ce sont les enfants qui lui ont porte l'oubli.\"    Mais cela ne devait pas durer bien longtemps. Elle redevint peu a peu  silencieuse, et ses profonds soupirs ne prouverent que trop que l'oubli  du triste passe n'etait qu'a la surface; ses manieres taciturnes et les  manifestations d'une secrete inquietude commencaient meme a troubler  mes parents, et mon pere essaya par beaucoup de bonte a la persuader  d'accepter les epreuves de sa vie comme venant de Dieu. Elle pleura  beaucoup et s'efforca de se gagner un peu de calme, mais sans fruit.    Un beau jour elle vint trouver mon pere et lui dit: \"Mon cher maitre,  aidez-moi a executer mon projet, et surtout n'essayez pas de m'en  dissuader. Je suis decidee a aller a la recherche de mon mari; je sais  qu'il a besoin de moi, il m'appelle, et je vais partir. Procurez-moi les  papiers et certificats necessaires a cette entreprise, afin que je ne  sois pas inquietee par le police. J'irai ou mes pieds me conduiront,  je ne sais ou je le retrouverai, mais je sais que je le reverrai. Je  marcherai de jour, et de nuit je me logerai dans une auberge ou une  ferme, et je vous donnerai de mes nouvelles.\"    Mon pere voyait qu'il ne pouvait ebranler sa resolution, fit ce qu'elle  lui demanda, pourvoyant tant que possible aux besoins de la route, et  c'est le coeur gros de sinistres presages que mes parents virent partir  leur bonne et fidele servante. Quand je lui dis: \"Tu ne nous aimes  donc plus, puisque tu pars?\" elle m'embrassa en pleurant, et dit, \"Je  reviendrai!\" Il y avait alors vingt ans depuis la disparition de son  mari, pendant lesquel elle avait soigneusement entretenu son menage dans  une petite maison qui lui, appartenait.    Elle partit donc, ainsi qu'elle l'avait dit; marchant de jour et se  reposant de nuit, se dirigeant vers la Prusse.    Elle fut absente sans que nous eussions de ses nouvelles pendant au-dela  d'un mois quand un jour le facteur apporte une lettre a mon pere de la  part d'un collegue inconnu d'un village de la Prusse, qui lui dit: \"Une  femme de respectable apparence, munie de certificats identifiant ses  dires, est venue me prier de proceder a l'humation de son mari qu'elle  a trouve mort dans un bois du village voisin. L'autorite municipale a  compare les papiers trouves dans les poches de l'inconnu et a constate  qu'ils sont en rapport avec ceux que la femme Reeb porte sur elle, et  sur ce fait, et voyant que l'homme etait mort sans violence, a laisse  ses restes a elle qui se dit sa veuve et qui lui a rendu les derniers  honneurs au cimetiere de notre village.\"    Inutile de decrire la surprise de mes parents a la reception de cette  lettre, qui fut bientot suivie par le retour de Catherine. Elle completa  le recit du pasteur en disant qu'un matin en sortant de ce village, elle  alla trouver un petit bois, quand elle vit au bord du chemin un homme  etendu mort, mais qui venait seulement de cesser de vivre. Elle le  regarda, l'examina et reconnut son mari; il lui parut evident qu'il  faisait son retour vers la patrie et elle, mais que la mort l'avait  surpris en route. Catherine fut bien plus calme apres ces evenements,  mais ses forces declinerent et dans la meme annee on creusa pour elle  une tombe au cimetiere de Hambach. Elle n'avait plus de famille que  celle qu'elle avait si fidelement servie, et les larmes de deux jeunes  enfants prouverent que quoique abandonnee elle avait ete aimee.          NOTES.
