He jumped right up into the  fireplace, balancing himself upon the  iron bar where the kettle hangs.    Tom Kitten took another big jump  off the bar and landed on a ledge high  up inside the chimney, knocking down  some soot into the fender.      Tom Kitten coughed and choked  with the smoke; he could hear the  sticks beginning to crackle and burn  in the fireplace down below. He made  up his mind to climb right to the top,  and get out on the slates, and try to  catch sparrows.    \"I cannot go back. If I slipped I  might fall in the fire and singe my  beautiful tail and my little blue  jacket.\"    The chimney was a very big old-  fashioned one. It was built in the days  when people burnt logs of wood upon  the hearth.    The chimney stack stood up above  the roof like a little stone tower, and  the daylight shone down from the top,  under the slanting slates that kept out  the rain.    Tom Kitten was getting very  frightened! He climbed up, and up,  and up.    Then he waded sideways through  inches of soot. He was like a little  sweep himself.      It was most confusing in the dark.  One flue seemed to lead into another.    There was less smoke, but Tom  Kitten felt quite lost.    He scrambled up and up; but  before he reached the chimney top he  came to a place where somebody had  loosened a stone in the wall. There  were some mutton bones lying about.    \"This seems funny,\" said Tom  Kitten. \"Who has been gnawing bones  up here in the chimney? I wish I had  never come! And what a funny smell?  It is something like mouse, only  dreadfully strong. It makes me  sneeze,\" said Tom Kitten.    He squeezed through the hole in  the wall and dragged himself along a  most uncomfortably tight passage  where there was scarcely any light.    He groped his way carefully for  several yards; he was at the back of  the skirting board in the attic, where  there is a little mark * in the picture.      All at once he fell head over heels in  the dark, down a hole, and landed on  a heap of very dirty rags.    When Tom Kitten picked himself up  and looked about him, he found  himself in a place that he had never  seen before, although he had lived all  his life in the house. It was a very  small stuffy fusty room, with boards,  and rafters, and cobwebs, and lath  and plaster.    Opposite to him--as far away as he  could sit--was an enormous rat.    \"What do you mean by tumbling  into my bed all covered with smuts?\"  said the rat, chattering his teeth.    \"Please, sir, the chimney wants  sweeping,\" said poor Tom Kitten.    \"Anna Maria! Anna Maria!\"  squeaked the rat. There was a  pattering noise and an old woman rat  poked her head round a rafter.      All in a minute she rushed upon  Tom Kitten, and before he knew what  was happening. . .    . . . his coat was pulled off, and he  was rolled up in a bundle, and tied  with string in very hard knots.    Anna Maria did the tying. The old  rat watched her and took snuff. When  she had finished, they both sat staring  at him with their mouths open.    \"Anna Maria,\" said the old man rat  (whose name was Samuel Whiskers),  \"Anna Maria, make me a kitten  dumpling roly-poly pudding for my  dinner.\"    \"It requires dough and a pat of  butter and a rolling pin,\" said Anna  Maria, considering Tom Kitten with  her head on one side.    \"No,\" said Samuel Whiskers, \"make  it properly, Anna Maria, with  breadcrumbs.\"    \"Nonsense! Butter and dough,\"  replied Anna Maria.      The two rats consulted together for  a few minutes and then went away.    Samuel Whiskers got through a  hole in the wainscot and went boldly  down the front staircase to the dairy  to get the butter. He did not meet  anybody.    He made a second journey for the  rolling pin. He pushed it in front of  him with his paws, like a brewer's  man trundling a barrel.    He could hear Ribby and Tabitha  talking, but they were too busy  lighting the candle to look into the  chest.    They did not see him.    Anna Maria went down by way of  skirting board and a window shutter  to the kitchen to steal the dough.    She borrowed a small saucer and  scooped up the dough with her paws.    She did not observe Moppet.      While Tom Kitten was left alone  under the floor of the attic, he  wriggled about and tried to mew for  help.    But his mouth was full of soot and  cobwebs, and he was tied up in such  very tight knots, he could not make  anybody hear him.    Except a spider who came out of a  crack in the ceiling and examined the  knots critically, from a safe distance.    It was a judge of knots because it  had a habit of tying up unfortunate  bluebottles. It did not offer to assist  him.    Tom Kitten wriggled and squirmed  until he was quite exhausted.    Presently the rats came back and  set to work to make him into a  dumpling. First they smeared him  with butter, and then they rolled him  in the dough.    \"Will not the string be very  indigestible, Anna Maria?\" inquired  Samuel Whiskers.    Anna Maria said she thought that it  was of no consequence; but she  wished that Tom Kitten would hold  his head still, as it disarranged the  pastry. She laid hold of his ears.      Tom Kitten bit and spit, and  mewed and wriggled; and the rolling  pin went roly-poly, roly; roly-poly,  roly. The rats each held an end.    \"His tail is sticking out! You did not  fetch enough dough, Anna Maria.\"    \"I fetched as much as I could  carry,\" replied Anna Maria.    \"I do not think\"--said Samuel  Whiskers, pausing to take a look at  Tom Kitten--\"I do NOT think it will be  a good pudding. It smells sooty.\"    Anna Maria was about to argue the  point when all at once there began to  be other sounds up above--the  rasping noise of a saw, and the noise  of a little dog, scratching and yelping!    The rats dropped the rolling pin  and listened attentively.    \"We are discovered and interrupted,  Anna Maria; let us collect our  property--and other people's--and  depart at once.    \"I fear that we shall be obliged to  leave this pudding.    \"But I am persuaded that the knots  would have proved indigestible,  whatever you may urge to the  contrary.\"    \"Come away at once and help me  to tie up some mutton bones in a  counterpane,\" said Anna Maria. \"I  have got half a smoked ham hidden in  the chimney.\"      So it happened that by the time  John Joiner had got the plank up--  there was nobody here under the floor  except the rolling pin and Tom Kitten  in a very dirty dumpling!    But there was a strong smell of  rats; and John Joiner spent the rest of  the morning sniffing and whining,  and wagging his tail, and going round  and round with his head in the hole  like a gimlet.    Then he nailed the plank down  again and put his tools in his bag, and  came downstairs.    The cat family had quite recovered.  They invited him to stay to dinner.    The dumpling had been peeled off  Tom Kitten and made separately into  a bag pudding, with currants in it to  hide the smuts.    They had been obliged to put Tom  Kitten into a hot bath to get the butter  off.    John Joiner smelt the pudding; but  he regretted that he had not time to  stay to dinner, because he had just  finished making a wheelbarrow for  Miss Potter, and she had ordered two  hen coops.      And when I was going to the post  late in the afternoon--I looked up the  land from the corner, and I saw Mr.  Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the  run, with big bundles on a little  wheelbarrow, which looked very  much like mine.    They were just turning in at the  gate to the barn of Farmer Potatoes.    Samuel Whiskers was puffing and  out of breath. Anna Maria was still  arguing in shrill tones.    She seemed to know her way, and  she seemed to have a quantity of  luggage.    I am sure _I_ never gave her leave to  borrow my wheelbarrow!    They went into the barn and  hauled their parcels with a bit of  string to the top of the haymow.    After that, there were no more rats  for a long time at Tabitha Twitchit's.      As for Farmer Potatoes, he has been  driven nearly distracted. There are  rats, and rats, and rats in his barn!  They eat up the chicken food, and  steal the oats and bran, and make  holes in the meal bags.    And they are all descended from  Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Whiskers--  children and grandchildren and  great-great-grandchildren.    There is no end to them!    Moppet and Mittens have grown up  into very good rat-catchers.    They go out rat-catching in the  village, and they find plenty of  employment. They charge so much a  dozen and earn their living very  comfortably.    They hang up the rats' tails in a  row on the barn door, to show how  many they have caught--dozens and  dozens of them.      But Tom Kitten has always been  afraid of a rat; he never durst face  anything that is bigger than--    A Mouse.          THE TALE OF  THE FLOPSY BUNNIES    [For All Little Friends of  Mr. McGregor and Peter and Benjamin]        It is said that the effect of eating  too much lettuce is \"soporific.\"    I have never felt sleepy after eating  lettuces; but then I am not a  rabbit.    They certainly had a very soporific  effect upon the Flopsy Bunnies!    When Benjamin Bunny grew up,  he married his Cousin Flopsy.  They had a large family, and they  were very improvident and cheerful.    I do not remember the separate  names of their children; they were  generally called the \"Flopsy Bunnies.\"    As there was not always quite  enough to eat,--Benjamin used to  borrow cabbages from Flopsy's  brother, Peter Rabbit, who kept a  nursery garden.      Sometimes Peter Rabbit had no  cabbages to spare.    When this happened, the Flopsy  Bunnies went across the field to a  rubbish heap, in the ditch outside  Mr. McGregor's garden.    Mr. McGregor's rubbish heap  was a mixture. There were jam  pots and paper bags, and mountains  of chopped grass from the  mowing machine (which always  tasted oily), and some rotten  vegetable marrows and an old"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5747"],[0,"Do and Dare — a Brave Boy's Fight for Fortune (#9)"],[1,"because he cannot supersede you with me. He evidently wants to do you an  injury.\"    \"It must be so; but I did not imagine that Eben could be so mean. Mr.  Bruce, do you believe that I am a thief?\"    \"No, I don't, Herbert,\" said the constable, \"and it was very much  against my will that I started out to arrest you, you may be sure.\"    \"When do you want me to go with you?\" asked Herbert.    \"You will go before Justice Slocum at two o'clock.\"    \"Is it necessary for me to go to the lockup?\" asked Herbert, shrinking,  with natural repugnance, from entering the temporary house of tramps and  law breakers.    \"No, Herbert,\" answered the constable, in a friendly tone. \"I'll take it  upon myself to let you go home to dinner. I will call for you at quarter  of two. Of course I shall find you ready to accompany me?\"    \"Yes, Mr. Bruce, I am impatient to meet Eben Graham, and tell him to his  face that he has been guilty of a mean and contemptible falsehood, in  charging me with theft. Not a person in the village who knows me will  believe it.\"    \"I will also call at your house, Herbert,\" said George Melville, \"and  accompany you to the office of the justice. I shall ask leave to give  the details of Eben Graham's visit to me last evening.\"    \"Thank you, Mr. Melville,\" said Herbert, \"I am glad you do not believe a  word of this story.\"    \"I am not so easily deceived, Herbert. It is quite possible that stamps  and money have been stolen, but, if so, it is your false friend and  accuser who is guilty.\"    Of course Herbert had to tell his mother what had happened. She was  agitated and alarmed, but became calmer when Herbert told her what was  Eben's probable motive in making the charge.    \"How can he behave so shamefully!\" exclaimed the indignant parent.    \"I didn't think him capable of it, myself, mother, although I had a poor  opinion of him.\"    \"Suppose that you can't prove that you are innocent, Herbert?\" said Mrs.  Carr, anxiously.    \"It is for him to prove that I am guilty, mother,\" answered Herbert, who  knew this much of law.    At a quarter of two Constable Bruce and Mr. Melville walked to the house  together.    The door was opened for them by Herbert himself.    \"So you haven't taken leg bail, Herbert,\" said the constable, jocosely.    \"No, Mr. Bruce, I am on hand; I am in a hurry to meet Mr. Eben Graham  and see whether he can look me in the face after his shameful behavior.\"    \"Oh, Mr. Bruce, I never thought you would call at my home on such an  errand,\" said Mrs. Carr, on the point of breaking down.    \"Don't worry, Mrs. Carr,\" said the constable; \"anybody may be charged  with theft, however innocent. Your son has good friends who won't see  him treated with injustice.\"    Herbert's mother was desirous of accompanying them to the office of the  justice, but was persuaded to remain behind. Herbert knew that in her  indignation she would not be able to be silent when she saw Eben Graham.    Justice Slocum was an elderly man, with a mild face and gray hair. When  Herbert entered he greeted him in a friendly way.    \"I am sorry to see you here, my boy,\" he said, \"but I am sure there is  some mistake. I have known you ever since you were a baby, and I don't  believe you are guilty of theft now.\"    \"I submit, Judge Slocum,\" said Eben Graham, who sat in a corner, his  mean features looking meaner and more insignificant than usual, \"I  submit that you are prejudging the case.\"    \"Silence, sir!\" said Judge Slocum, warmly. \"How dare you impugn my  conduct? Though Herbert were my own son, I would give you a chance to  prove him guilty.\"    \"I hope you'll excuse me, judge,\" said Eben, cringing. \"I am as sorry as  you are to believe the boy guilty of stealing.\"    \"Do your worst and say your worst, Eben Graham!\" said Herbert,  contemptuously, \"but be very careful that you do not swear falsely.\"    \"I don't need any instructions from you, Herbert Carr, considering that  you are a criminal on trial,\" said Eben, maliciously.    \"You are mistaken, sir,\" said George Melville. \"To be under arrest does  not make a man or boy a criminal.\"    \"I am sure I am much obliged for the information, Mr. Melville,\" said  Eben, spitefully. \"You've chosen a nice companion.\"    \"There you are right,\" said Melville, gravely. \"I have done much better  than if I had hired you.\"    Eben winced, but did not reply.    George Melville whispered to Herbert:    \"Are you willing to accept me as your lawyer? I am not much of one, to  be sure, but this case is very simple.\"    \"I am very grateful for your offer, and accept it,\" said Herbert.    I do not propose to record the whole scene in detail, but only to give a  general idea of the proceedings.    Eben Graham was sworn as a witness, and deposed that he had left Herbert  in charge of the post office the previous evening. On his return he  examined the stamps and contents of the money drawer, and found, to his  surprise, that five dollars in money and six dollars' worth of stamps  were missing.    \"How did you know they were missing?\" asked Melville.    \"Because I knew precisely how much money was in the drawer and how many  stamps were there.\"    \"Then you counted them just before you went out?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"That was rather a singular time to make the count, was it not?\"    \"I don't know that it was, sir.\"    \"I should suppose the end of the day would be a more appropriate time.\"    \"I don't think so,\" answered Eben, shortly.    \"Were you led to make the count because you suspected Herbert's  honesty?\" asked Mr. Melville.    \"That was the very reason I did it,\" said Eben, with a malicious glance  at Herbert.    \"Isn't it a little curious that you should have selected a boy whose  honesty you doubted, to fill your place?\" asked George Melville,  carelessly.    \"There wasn't anybody else; he knew all about post-office work.\"  answered Eben.    \"Very good! Now, Mr. Graham, if you have no objection, will you tell why  you wanted to get away from the post office last evening?\"    Eben fidgeted, for he saw what was coming, and it made him nervous.    \"I wanted a little rest,\" he answered, after a pause.    \"Where did you go?\"    \"Why do you ask me that question?\" asked Eben, moving about uneasily.    \"Because I desire an answer.\"    \"You know where I went,\" returned Eben, sullenly.    \"Yes, but I wish you to tell me.\"    \"Answer the question, witness!\" said the judge, briefly.    \"I went to the hotel,\" replied Eben, evasively.    \"On whom did you call?\"    \"On you!\" answered Eben, reluctantly.    \"We have come to it at last. Now, what was your business with me?\"    \"To tell you that Herbert would not suit you as a companion,\" said the  witness, who thought this answer rather a clever one.    \"Whom did you recommend in his place?\" pursued the questioner,  relentlessly.    Eben hesitated, but his cleverness came again to his aid.    \"I told you that I would be willing to come just to oblige you,\" he  said.    \"Did Herbert know that you were going to make this proposal?\"    \"No.\"    \"You asked him, then, to remain in the post office while you absented  yourself with a view of depriving him of the position he had just  secured in my employ?\"    \"I would have got father to take him again in the store and post  office,\" said Eben, defending himself from the implied charge of  treachery.    \"Yes, you told me so.\"    Eben nodded triumphantly. Even Melville had to admit that he was not  treating Herbert meanly.    \"By the way,\" said Melville, \"isn't it rather strange that you should  have been ready to recommend in your place a boy whose honesty you  doubted?\"    \"I didn't know he was a thief,\" said Eben, somewhat abashed.    \"No, but you suspected his honesty. That was your reason for counting  the money and stamps before you left the office. At least, that is the  reason you have given.\"    \"He had been in the office before I was there,\" said Eben, uneasily.    \"While he was there, were any stamps missing? Was he suspected of taking  any stamps or money?\"    \"Not that I know of.\"    \"Now, Mr. Graham, what answer did I make to your application?\"    \"What application?\"    \"To take you into my employ instead of Herbert.\"    \"You wanted to keep him,\" said the witness, sullenly.    \"Precisely. Having failed, then, in your application, you went home and  discovered that some money and stamps had been stolen.\"    \"Yes, sir. I was very much surprised--\"    \"That will do, sir. Your discovery was remarkably well-timed. Herbert  having obtained the position you sought, you straightway discovered  proof of his dishonesty.\"    Eben colored, for the insinuation was plain enough for even him to  understand.    \"The two things had nothing to do with each other!\" he said.    \"That may be, but I call the attention of the judge to a very remarkable  coincidence. Have the missing stamps or money been found on the person  of the defendant?\"    \"He hasn't been searched.\"    \"I will take it upon me to say that he is ready to submit to an  examination,\" said Melville.    Herbert said, emphatically, \"I am.\"    \"Oh, it isn't likely you'd find anything now.\" said Eben, with a sneer.    \"Why not?\"    \"He has had plenty of time to put 'em away.\"    \"I am willing to have my mother's house searched,\" said Herbert,  promptly.    \"Oh, they ain't there!\" said Eben, significantly.    \"Where are they, then?\"    Eben's answer took Herbert and his lawyer, and the judge himself, by  surprise.          CHAPTER XII. EBEN'S TRUMP CARD.        \"I guess they're--a part of them--inside this letter,\" he said.    As he spoke he produced a letter, stamped and sealed, but not  postmarked. The letter was addressed:    \"Messrs. Jones & Fitch,    \"---Chestnut Street,    \"Philadelphia.\"    \"What makes you think this letter contains money or postage stamps, Mr.  Graham?\" asked George Melville.    \"Because I've seen an advertisement of Jones & Fitch in one of the  weekly papers. They advertise to send several articles to any address on"]]]
