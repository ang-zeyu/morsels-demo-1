It is really just  as easy to drill a regiment as a company,    --perhaps easier, because one has more time to think; but it is just as  essential to be sharp and decisive, perfectly clearheaded, and to put  life into the men. A regiment seems small when one has learned how to  handle it, a mere handful of men; and I have no doubt that a brigade  or a division would soon appear equally small. But to handle either  _judiciously_, ah, that is another affair!    So of governing; it is as easy to govern a regiment as a school or a  factory, and needs like qualities, system, promptness, patience, tact;  moreover, in a regiment one has the aid of the admirable machinery of  the army, so that I see very ordinary men who succeed very tolerably.    Reports of a six months' armistice are rife here, and the thought is  deplored by all. I cannot believe it; yet sometimes one feels very  anxious about the ultimate fate of these poor people. After the  experience of Hungary, one sees that revolutions may go backward; and  the habit of injustice seems so deeply impressed upon the whites, that  it is hard to believe in the possibility of anything better. I dare not  yet hope that the promise of the President's Proclamation will be kept.  For myself I can be indifferent, for the experience here has been its  own daily and hourly reward; and the adaptedness of the freed slaves for  drill and discipline is now thoroughly demonstrated, and must soon be  universally acknowledged. But it would be terrible to see this regiment  disbanded or defrauded.      January 12.    Many things glide by without time to narrate them. On Saturday we had a  mail with the President's Second Message of Emancipation, and the next  day it was read to the men. The words themselves did not stir them very  much, because they have been often told that they were free, especially  on New Year's Day, and, being unversed in politics, they do not  understand, as well as we do, the importance of each additional  guaranty. But the chaplain spoke to them afterwards very effectively,  as usual; and then I proposed to them to hold up their hands and pledge  themselves to be faithful to those still in bondage. They entered  heartily into this, and the scene was quite impressive, beneath the  great oak-branches. I heard afterwards that only one man refused to  raise his hand, saying bluntly that his wife was out of slavery with  him, and he did not care to fight. The other soldiers of his company  were very indignant, and shoved him about among them while marching back  to their quarters, calling him \"Coward.\" I was glad of their exhibition  of feeling, though it is very possible that the one who had thus the  moral courage to stand alone among his comrades might be more reliable,  on a pinch, than some who yielded a more ready assent. But the whole  response, on their part, was very hearty, and will be a good thing  to which to hold them hereafter, at any time of discouragement or  demoralization,--which was my chief reason for proposing it. With  their simple natures it is a great thing to tie them to some definite  committal; they never forget a marked occurrence, and never seem  disposed to evade a pledge.    It is this capacity of honor and fidelity which gives me such entire  faith in them as soldiers. Without it all their religious demonstration  would be mere sentimentality. For instance, every one who visits the  camp is struck with their bearing as sentinels. They exhibit, in this  capacity, not an upstart conceit, but a steady, conscientious devotion  to duty. They would stop their idolized General Saxton, if he attempted  to cross their beat contrary to orders: I have seen them. No feeble or  incompetent race could do this. The officers tell many amusing instances  of this fidelity, but I think mine the best.    It was very dark the other night, an unusual thing here, and the rain  fell in torrents; so I put on my India-rubber suit, and went the rounds  of the sentinels, incognito, to test them. I can only say that I shall  never try such an experiment again and have cautioned my officers  against it. Tis a wonder I escaped with life and limb,--such a charging  of bayonets and clicking of gun-locks. Sometimes I tempted them by  refusing to give any countersign, but offering them a piece of tobacco,  which they could not accept without allowing me nearer than the  prescribed bayonet's distance. Tobacco is more than gold to them, and it  was touching to watch the struggle in their minds; but they always did  their duty at last, and I never could persuade them. One man, as if  wishing to crush all his inward vacillation at one fell stroke, told  me stoutly that he never used tobacco, though I found next day that he  loved it as much as any one of them. It seemed wrong thus to tamper with  their fidelity; yet it was a vital matter to me to know how far it could  be trusted, out of my sight. It was so intensely dark that not more than  one or two knew me, even after I had talked with the very next sentinel,  especially as they had never seen me in India-rubber clothing, and I can  always disguise my voice. It was easy to distinguish those who did make  the discovery; they were always conscious and simpering when their turn  came; while the others were stout and irreverent till I revealed myself,  and then rather cowed and anxious, fearing to have offended.    It rained harder and harder, and when I had nearly made the rounds I had  had enough of it, and, simply giving the countersign to the challenging  sentinel, undertook to pass within the lines.    \"Halt!\" exclaimed this dusky man and brother, bringing down his bayonet,  \"de countersign not correck.\"    Now the magic word, in this case, was \"Vicksburg,\" in honor of a rumored  victory. But as I knew that these hard names became quite transformed  upon their lips, \"Carthage\" being familiarized into Cartridge, and  \"Concord\" into Corn-cob, how could I possibly tell what shade of  pronunciation my friend might prefer for this particular proper name?    \"Vicksburg,\" I repeated, blandly, but authoritatively, endeavoring, as  zealously as one of Christy's Minstrels, to assimilate my speech to any  supposed predilection of the Ethiop vocal organs.    \"Halt dar! Countersign not correck,\" was the only answer.    The bayonet still maintained a position which, in a military point of  view, was impressive.    I tried persuasion, orthography, threats, tobacco, all in vain. I  could not pass in. Of course my pride was up; for was I to defer to  an untutored African on a point of pronunciation? Classic shades of  Harvard, forbid! Affecting scornful indifference, I tried to edge away,  proposing to myself to enter the camp at some other point, where my  elocution would be better appreciated. Not a step could I stir.    \"Halt!\" shouted my gentleman again, still holding me at his bayonet's  point, and I wincing and halting.    I explained to him the extreme absurdity of this proceeding, called his  attention to the state of the weather, which, indeed, spoke for itself  so loudly that we could hardly hear each other speak, and requested  permission to withdraw. The bayonet, with mute eloquence, refused the  application.    There flashed into my mind, with more enjoyment in the retrospect than  I had experienced at the time, an adventure on a lecturing tour in other  years, when I had spent an hour in trying to scramble into a country  tavern, after bed-time, on the coldest night of winter. On that occasion  I ultimately found myself stuck midway in the window, with my head in a  temperature of 80 degrees, and my heels in a temperature of -10 degrees,  with a heavy windowsash pinioning the small of my back. However, I had  got safe out of that dilemma, and it was time to put an end to this one,    \"Call the corporal of the guard,\" said I at last, with dignity,  unwilling to make a night of it or to yield my incognito.    \"Corporal ob de guard!\" he shouted, lustily,--\"Post Number Two!\" while  I could hear another sentinel chuckling with laughter. This last was a  special guard, placed over a tent, with a prisoner in charge. Presently  he broke silence.    \"Who am dat?\" he asked, in a stage whisper. \"Am he a buckra [white  man]?\"    \"Dunno whether he been a buckra or not,\" responded, doggedly, my  Cerberus in uniform; \"but I's bound to keep him here till de corporal ob  de guard come.\"    Yet, when that dignitary arrived, and I revealed myself, poor Number Two  appeared utterly transfixed with terror, and seemed to look for nothing  less than immediate execution. Of course I praised his fidelity, and  the next day complimented him before the guard, and mentioned him to his  captain; and the whole affair was very good for them all. Hereafter, if  Satan himself should approach them in darkness and storm, they will take  _him_ for \"de Cunnel,\" and treat him with special severity.      January 13.    In many ways the childish nature of this people shows itself. I have  just had to make a change of officers in a company which has constantly  complained, and with good reason, of neglect and improper treatment.  Two excellent officers have been assigned to them; and yet they sent a  deputation to me in the evening, in a state of utter wretchedness. \"We's  bery grieved dis evening, Cunnel; 'pears like we couldn't bear it, to  lose de Cap'n and de Lieutenant, all two togeder.\" Argument was useless;  and I could only fall back on the general theory, that I knew what was  best for them, which had much more effect; and I also could cite the  instance of another company, which had been much improved by a new  captain, as they readily admitted. So with the promise that the new  officers should not be \"savage to we,\" which was the one thing they  deprecated, I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/677"],[0,"The Heroes; Or, Greek Fairy Tales for My Children (#9)"],[1,"her star-spangled tresses, and Perseus with the  Gorgon's head, and fair Andromeda beside him, spreading her long white  arms across the heaven, as she stood when chained to the stone for the  monster.

STORY II.--THE ARGONAUTS      PART I  HOW THE CENTAUR TRAINED THE HEROES ON PELION      I have told you of a hero who fought with wild beasts and with wild men;  but now I have a tale of heroes who sailed away into a distant land, to  win themselves renown for ever, in the adventure of the Golden Fleece.    Whither they sailed, my children, I cannot clearly tell.  It all happened  long ago; so long that it has all grown dim, like a dream which you  dreamt last year.  And why they went I cannot tell: some say that it was  to win gold.  It may be so; but the noblest deeds which have been done on  earth have not been done for gold.  It was not for the sake of gold that  the Lord came down and died, and the Apostles went out to preach the good  news in all lands.  The Spartans looked for no reward in money when they  fought and died at Thermopylae; and Socrates the wise asked no pay from  his countrymen, but lived poor and barefoot all his days, only caring to  make men good.  And there are heroes in our days also, who do noble  deeds, but not for gold.  Our discoverers did not go to make themselves  rich when they sailed out one after another into the dreary frozen seas;  nor did the ladies who went out last year to drudge in the hospitals of  the East, making themselves poor, that they might be rich in noble works.  And young men, too, whom you know, children, and some of them of your own  kin, did they say to themselves, 'How much money shall I earn?' when they  went out to the war, leaving wealth, and comfort, and a pleasant home,  and all that money can give, to face hunger and thirst, and wounds and  death, that they might fight for their country and their Queen?  No,  children, there is a better thing on earth than wealth, a better thing  than life itself; and that is, to have done something before you die, for  which good men may honour you, and God your Father smile upon your work.    Therefore we will believe--why should we not?--of these same Argonauts of  old, that they too were noble men, who planned and did a noble deed; and  that therefore their fame has lived, and been told in story and in song,  mixed up, no doubt, with dreams and fables, and yet true and right at  heart.  So we will honour these old Argonauts, and listen to their story  as it stands; and we will try to be like them, each of us in our place;  for each of us has a Golden Fleece to seek, and a wild sea to sail over  ere we reach it, and dragons to fight ere it be ours.                                    * * * * *    And what was that first Golden Fleece?  I do not know, nor care.  The old  Hellens said that it hung in Colchis, which we call the Circassian coast,  nailed to a beech-tree in the war-God's wood; and that it was the fleece  of the wondrous ram who bore Phrixus and Helle across the Euxine sea.  For Phrixus and Helle were the children of the cloud-nymph, and of  Athamas the Minuan king.  And when a famine came upon the land, their  cruel step-mother Ino wished to kill them, that her own children might  reign, and said that they must be sacrificed on an altar, to turn away  the anger of the Gods.  So the poor children were brought to the altar,  and the priest stood ready with his knife, when out of the clouds came  the Golden Ram, and took them on his back, and vanished.  Then madness  came upon that foolish king, Athamas, and ruin upon Ino and her children.  For Athamas killed one of them in his fury, and Ino fled from him with  the other in her arms, and leaped from a cliff into the sea, and was  changed into a dolphin, such as you have seen, which wanders over the  waves for ever sighing, with its little one clasped to its breast.    But the people drove out King Athamas, because he had killed his child;  and he roamed about in his misery, till he came to the Oracle in Delphi.  And the Oracle told him that he must wander for his sin, till the wild  beasts should feast him as their guest.  So he went on in hunger and  sorrow for many a weary day, till he saw a pack of wolves.  The wolves  were tearing a sheep; but when they saw Athamas they fled, and left the  sheep for him, and he ate of it; and then he knew that the oracle was  fulfilled at last.  So he wandered no more; but settled, and built a  town, and became a king again.    But the ram carried the two children far away over land and sea, till he  came to the Thracian Chersonese, and there Helle fell into the sea.  So  those narrow straits are called 'Hellespont,' after her; and they bear  that name until this day.    Then the ram flew on with Phrixus to the north-east across the sea which  we call the Black Sea now; but the Hellens call it Euxine.  And at last,  they say, he stopped at Colchis, on the steep Circassian coast; and there  Phrixus married Chalciope, the daughter of Aietes the king; and offered  the ram in sacrifice; and Aietes nailed the ram's fleece to a beech, in  the grove of Ares the war-God.    And after awhile Phrixus died, and was buried, but his spirit had no  rest; for he was buried far from his native land, and the pleasant hills  of Hellas.  So he came in dreams to the heroes of the Minuai, and called  sadly by their beds, 'Come and set my spirit free, that I may go home to  my fathers and to my kinsfolk, and the pleasant Minuan land.'    And they asked, 'How shall we set your spirit free?'    'You must sail over the sea to Colchis, and bring home the golden fleece;  and then my spirit will come back with it, and I shall sleep with my  fathers and have rest.'    He came thus, and called to them often; but when they woke they looked at  each other, and said, 'Who dare sail to Colchis, or bring home the golden  fleece?'  And in all the country none was brave enough to try it; for the  man and the time were not come.    Phrixus had a cousin called AEson, who was king in Iolcos by the sea.  There he ruled over the rich Minuan heroes, as Athamas his uncle ruled in  Boeotia; and, like Athamas, he was an unhappy man.  For he had a  step-brother named Pelias, of whom some said that he was a nymph's son,  and there were dark and sad tales about his birth.  When he was a babe he  was cast out on the mountains, and a wild mare came by and kicked him.  But a shepherd passing found the baby, with its face all blackened by the  blow; and took him home, and called him Pelias, because his face was  bruised and black.  And he grew up fierce and lawless, and did many a  fearful deed; and at last he drove out AEson his step-brother, and then  his own brother Neleus, and took the kingdom to himself, and ruled over  the rich Minuan heroes, in Iolcos by the sea.    And AEson, when he was driven out, went sadly away out of the town,  leading his little son by the hand; and he said to himself, 'I must hide  the child in the mountains; or Pelias will surely kill him, because he is  the heir.'    So he went up from the sea across the valley, through the vineyards and  the olive groves, and across the torrent of Anauros, toward Pelion the  ancient mountain, whose brows are white with snow.    He went up and up into the mountain, over marsh, and crag, and down, till  the boy was tired and footsore, and AEson had to bear him in his arms,  till he came to the mouth of a lonely cave, at the foot of a mighty  cliff.    Above the cliff the snow-wreaths hung, dripping and cracking in the sun;  but at its foot around the cave's mouth grew all fair flowers and herbs,  as if in a garden, ranged in order, each sort by itself.  There they grew  gaily in the sunshine, and the spray of the torrent from above; while  from the cave came the sound of music, and a man's voice singing to the  harp.    Then AEson put down the lad, and whispered--    'Fear not, but go in, and whomsoever you shall find, lay your hands upon  his knees, and say, \"In the name of Zeus, the father of Gods and men, I  am your guest from this day forth.\"'    Then the lad went in without trembling, for he too was a hero's son; but  when he was within, he stopped in wonder to listen to that magic song.    And there he saw the singer lying upon bear-skins and fragrant boughs:  Cheiron, the ancient centaur, the wisest of all things beneath the sky.  Down to the waist he was a man, but below he was a noble horse; his white  hair rolled down over his broad shoulders, and his white beard over his  broad brown chest; and his eyes were wise and mild, and his forehead like  a mountain-wall.    And in his hands he held a harp of gold, and struck it with a golden key;  and as he struck, he sang till his eyes glittered, and filled all the  cave with light.    And he sang of the birth of Time, and of the heavens and the dancing  stars; and of the ocean, and the ether, and the fire, and the shaping of  the wondrous earth.  And he sang of the treasures of the hills, and the  hidden jewels of the mine, and the veins of fire and metal, and the  virtues of all healing herbs, and of the speech of birds, and of  prophecy, and of hidden things to come.    Then he sang of health, and strength, and manhood, and a valiant heart;  and of music, and hunting, and wrestling, and all the games which heroes  love: and of travel, and wars, and sieges, and a noble death in fight;  and then he sang of peace and plenty, and of equal justice in the land;  and as he sang the boy listened wide-eyed, and forgot his errand in the  song.    And at the last old Cheiron was silent, and called the lad with a soft  voice.    And the lad ran trembling to him, and would have laid his hands upon his  knees; but Cheiron smiled, and said, 'Call hither your father AEson, for  I know you, and all that has"]]]
