The act of preparing this poison is not considered as a common one: the  savage may shape his bow, fasten the barb on the point of his arrow and  make his other implements of destruction either lying in his hammock or  in the midst of his family; but if he has to prepare the wourali  poison, many precautions are supposed to be necessary.    The women and young girls are not allowed to be present, lest the  Yabahou, or evil spirit, should do them harm. The shed under which it  has been boiled is pronounced polluted, and abandoned ever after. He  who makes the poison must eat nothing that morning, and must continue  fasting as long as the operation lasts. The pot in which it is boiled  must be a new one, and must never have held anything before, otherwise  the poison would be deficient in strength: add to this that the  operator must take particular care not to expose himself to the vapour  which arises from it while on the fire.    Though this and other precautions are taken, such as frequently washing  the face and hands, still the Indians think that it affects the health;  and the operator either is, or, what is more probable, supposes himself  to be, sick for some days after.    Thus it appears that the making the wourali poison is considered as a  gloomy and mysterious operation; and it would seem that they imagine it  affects others as well as him who boils it, for an Indian agreed one  evening to make some for me, but the next morning he declined having  anything to do with it, alleging that his wife was with child!    Here it might be asked, are all the ingredients just mentioned  necessary in order to produce the wourali poison? Though our opinions  and conjectures may militate against the absolute necessity of some of  them, still it would be hardly fair to pronounce them added by the hand  of superstition till proof positive can be obtained.    We might argue on the subject, and by bringing forward instances of  Indian superstition draw our conclusion by inference, and still remain  in doubt on this head. You know superstition to be the offspring of  ignorance, and of course that it takes up its abode amongst the rudest  tribes of uncivilised man. It even too often resides with man in his  more enlightened state.    The Augustan age furnishes numerous examples. A bone snatched from the  jaws of a fasting bitch, and a feather from the wing of a  night-owl--\"ossa ab ore rapta jejunae canis, plumamque nocturnae  strigis\"--were necessary for Canidia's incantations. And in after-times  Parson Evans, the Welshman, was treated most ungenteelly by an enraged  spirit solely because he had forgotten a fumigation in his witch-work.    If, then, enlightened man lets his better sense give way, and believes,  or allows himself to be persuaded, that certain substances and actions,  in reality of no avail, possess a virtue which renders them useful in  producing the wished-for effect, may not the wild, untaught,  unenlightened savage of Guiana add an ingredient which, on account of  the harm it does him, he fancies may be useful to the perfection of his  poison, though in fact it be of no use at all? If a bone snatched from  the jaws of a fasting bitch be thought necessary in incantation; or if  witchcraft have recourse to the raiment of the owl because it resorts  to the tombs and mausoleums of the dead and wails and hovers about at  the time that the rest of animated nature sleeps; certainly the savage  may imagine that the ants, whose sting causes a fever, and the teeth of  the labarri and counacouchi snakes, which convey death in a very short  space of time, are essentially necessary in the composition of his  poison; and being once impressed with this idea, he will add them every  time he makes the poison and transmit the absolute use of them to his  posterity. The question to be answered seems not to be if it is natural  for the Indians to mix these ingredients, but if they are essential to  make the poison.    So much for the preparing of this vegetable essence: terrible importer  of death, into whatever animal it enters. Let us now see how it is  used; let us examine the weapons which bear it to its destination, and  take a view of the poor victim from the time he receives his wound till  death comes to his relief.    When a native of Macoushia goes in quest of feathered game or other  birds he seldom carries his bow and arrows. It is the blow-pipe he then  uses. This extraordinary tube of death is, perhaps, one of the greatest  natural curiosities of Guiana. It is not found in the country of the  Macoushi. Those Indians tell you that it grows to the south-west of  them, in the wilds which extend betwixt them and the Rio Negro. The  reed must grow to an amazing length, as the part the Indians use is  from ten to eleven feet long, and no tapering can be perceived in it,  one end being as thick as the other. It is of a bright yellow colour,  perfectly smooth both inside and out. It grows hollow, nor is there the  least appearance of a knot or joint throughout the whole extent. The  natives call it ourah. This of itself is too slender to answer the end  of a blow-pipe, but there is a species of palma, larger and stronger,  and common in Guiana, and this the Indians make use of as a case in  which they put the ourah. It is brown, susceptible of a fine polish,  and appears as if it had joints five or six inches from each other. It  is called samourah, and the pulp inside is easily extracted by steeping  it for a few days in water.    Thus the ourah and samourah, one within the other, form the blow-pipe  of Guiana. The end which is applied to the mouth is tied round with a  small silk-grass cord to prevent its splitting, and the other end,  which is apt to strike against the ground, is secured by the seed of  the acuero fruit cut horizontally through the middle, with a hole made  in the end through which is put the extremity of the blow-pipe. It is  fastened on with string on the outside, and the inside is filled up  with wild-bees' wax.    The arrow is from nine to ten inches long. It is made out of the leaf  of a species of palm-tree called coucourite, hard and brittle, and  pointed as sharp as a needle. About an inch of the pointed end is  poisoned. The other end is burnt to make it still harder, and wild  cotton is put round it for about an inch and a half. It requires  considerable practice to put on this cotton well. It must just be large  enough to fit the hollow of the tube and taper off to nothing  downwards. They tie it on with a thread of the silk-grass to prevent  its slipping off the arrow.    The Indians have shown ingenuity in making a quiver to hold the arrows.  It will contain from five to six hundred. It is generally from twelve  to fourteen inches long, and in shape resembles a dice-box used at  backgammon. The inside is prettily done in basket-work with wood not  unlike bamboo, and the outside has a coat of wax. The cover is all of  one piece formed out of the skin of the tapir. Round the centre there  is fastened a loop large enough to admit the arm and shoulder, from  which it hangs when used. To the rim is tied a little bunch of  silk-grass and half of the jaw-bone of the fish called pirai, with  which the Indian scrapes the point of his arrow.    Before he puts the arrows into the quiver he links them together by two  strings of cotton, one string at each end, and then folds them round a  stick which is nearly the length of the quiver. The end of the stick,  which is uppermost, is guarded by two little pieces of wood crosswise,  with a hoop round their extremities, which appears something like a  wheel, and this saves the hand from being wounded when the quiver is  reversed in order to let the bunch of arrows drop out.    There is also attached to the quiver a little kind of basket to hold  the wild cotton which is put on the blunt end of the arrow. With a  quiver of poisoned arrows slung over his shoulder, and with his  blow-pipe in his hand, in the same position as a soldier carries his  musket, see the Macoushi Indian advancing towards the forest in quest  of powises, maroudis, waracabas and other feathered game.    These generally sit high up in the tall and tufted trees, but still are  not out of the Indian's reach, for his blow-pipe, at its greatest  elevation, will send an arrow three hundred feet. Silent as midnight he  steals under them, and so cautiously does he tread the ground that the  fallen leaves rustle not beneath his feet. His ears are open to the  least sound, while his eye, keen as that of the lynx, is employed in  finding out the game in the thickest shade. Often he imitates their  cry, and decoys them from tree to tree, till they are within range of  his tube. Then taking a poisoned arrow from his quiver, he puts it in  the blow-pipe and collects his breath for the fatal puff.    About two feet from the end through which he blows there are fastened  two teeth of the acouri, and these serve him for a sight. Silent and  swift the arrow flies, and seldom fails to pierce the object at which  it is sent. Sometimes the wounded bird remains in the same tree where  it was shot, and in three minutes falls down at the Indian's feet.  Should he take wing his flight is of short duration, and the Indian,  following the direction he has gone, is sure to find him dead.    It is natural to imagine that when a slight wound only is inflicted the  game will make its escape. Far otherwise; the wourali poison almost  instantaneously mixes with blood or water, so that if you wet your  finger and dash it along the poisoned arrow in the quickest manner  possible you are sure to carry off some of the poison. Though three  minutes generally elapse before the convulsions come on in the wounded  bird, still a stupor evidently takes place sooner, and this stupor  manifests itself by an apparent unwillingness in the bird to move. This  was very visible in a dying fowl."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8172"],[0,"History of Astronomy (#9)"],[1," _anomaly_  when the planet is at P.

GALILEO AND THE TELESCOPE--NOTIONS OF GRAVITY BY HORROCKS, ETC.      It is now necessary to leave the subject of dynamical astronomy for a  short time in order to give some account of work in a different  direction originated by a contemporary of Kepler's, his senior in fact  by seven years. Galileo Galilei was born at Pisa in 1564. The most  scientific part of his work dealt with terrestrial dynamics; but one  of those fortunate chances which happen only to really great men put  him in the way of originating a new branch of astronomy.    The laws of motion had not been correctly defined.  The only man of  Galileo's time who seems to have worked successfully in the same  direction as himself was that Admirable Crichton of the Italians,  Leonardo da Vinci. Galileo cleared the ground. It had always been  noticed that things tend to come to rest; a ball rolled on the ground,  a boat moved on the water, a shot fired in the air. Galileo realised  that in all of these cases a resisting force acts to stop the motion,  and he was the first to arrive at the not very obvious law that the  motion of a body will never stop, nor vary its speed, nor change its  direction, except by the action of some force.    It is not very obvious that a light body and a heavy one fall at the  same speed (except for the resistance of the air). Galileo proved this  on paper, but to convince the world he had to experiment from the  leaning tower of Pisa.    At an early age he discovered the principle of isochronism of the  pendulum, which, in the hands of Huyghens in the middle of the  seventeenth century, led to the invention of the pendulum clock,  perhaps the most valuable astronomical instrument ever produced.    These and other discoveries in dynamics may seem very obvious now; but  it is often the most every-day matters which have been found to elude  the inquiries of ordinary minds, and it required a high order of  intellect to unravel the truth and discard the stupid maxims scattered  through the works of Aristotle and accepted on his authority. A blind  worship of scientific authorities has often delayed the progress of  human knowledge, just as too much \"instruction\" of a youth often ruins  his \"education.\" Grant, in his history of Physical Astronomy, has well  said that \"the sagacity and skill which Galileo displays in resolving  the phenomena of motion into their constituent elements, and hence  deriving the original principles involved in them, will ever assure to  him a distinguished place among those who have extended the domains of  science.\"    But it was work of a different kind that established Galileo's popular  reputation. In 1609 Galileo heard that a Dutch spectacle-maker had  combined a pair of lenses so as to magnify distant objects. Working on  this hint, he solved the same problem, first on paper and then in  practice. So he came to make one of the first telescopes ever used in  astronomy. No sooner had he turned it on the heavenly bodies than he  was rewarded by such a shower of startling discoveries as forthwith  made his name the best known in Europe.  He found curious irregular  black spots on the sun, revolving round it in twenty-seven days; hills  and valleys on the moon; the planets showing discs of sensible size,  not points like the fixed stars; Venus showing phases according to her  position in relation to the sun; Jupiter accompanied by four moons;  Saturn with appendages that he could not explain, but unlike the other  planets; the Milky Way composed of a multitude of separate stars.    His fame flew over Europe like magic, and his discoveries were much  discussed--and there were many who refused to believe. Cosmo de Medici  induced him to migrate to Florence to carry on his observations.  He  was received by Paul V., the Pope, at Rome, to whom he explained his  discoveries.    He thought that these discoveries proved the truth of the Copernican  theory of the Earth's motion; and he urged this view on friends and  foes alike.  Although in frequent correspondence with Kepler, he never  alluded to the New Astronomy, and wrote to him extolling the virtue of  epicycles. He loved to argue, never shirked an encounter with any  number of disputants, and laughed as he broke down their arguments.    Through some strange course of events, not easy to follow, the  Copernican theory, whose birth was welcomed by the Church, had now  been taken up by certain anti-clerical agitators, and was opposed by  the cardinals as well as by the dignitaries of the Reformed  Church. Galileo--a good Catholic--got mixed up in these discussions,  although on excellent terms with the Pope and his entourage. At last  it came about that Galileo was summoned to appear at Rome, where he  was charged with holding and teaching heretical opinions about the  movement of the earth; and he then solemnly abjured these  opinions. There has been much exaggeration and misstatement about his  trial and punishment, and for a long time there was a great deal of  bitterness shown on both sides. But the general verdict of the present  day seems to be that, although Galileo himself was treated with  consideration, the hostility of the Church to the views of Copernicus  placed it in opposition also to the true Keplerian system, and this  led to unprofitable controversies.  From the time of Galileo onwards,  for some time, opponents of religion included the theory of the  Earth's motion in their disputations, not so much for the love, or  knowledge, of astronomy, as for the pleasure of putting the Church in  the wrong. This created a great deal of bitterness and intolerance on  both sides. Among the sufferers was Giordano Bruno, a learned  speculative philosopher, who was condemned to be burnt at the stake.    Galileo died on Christmas Day, 1642--the day of Newton's birth. The  further consideration of the grand field of discovery opened out by  Galileo with his telescopes must be now postponed, to avoid  discontinuity in the history of the intellectual development of this  period, which lay in the direction of dynamical, or physical,  astronomy.    Until the time of Kepler no one seems to have conceived the idea of  universal physical forces controlling terrestrial phenomena, and  equally applicable to the heavenly bodies. The grand discovery by  Kepler of the true relationship of the Sun to the Planets, and the  telescopic discoveries of Galileo and of those who followed him,  spread a spirit of inquiry and philosophic thought throughout Europe,  and once more did astronomy rise in estimation; and the irresistible  logic of its mathematical process of reasoning soon placed it in the  position it has ever since occupied as the foremost of the exact  sciences.    The practical application of this process of reasoning was enormously  facilitated by the invention of logarithms by Napier. He was born at  Merchistoun, near Edinburgh, in 1550, and died in 1617. By this system  the tedious arithmetical operations necessary in astronomical  calculations, especially those dealing with the trigonometrical  functions of angles, were so much simplified that Laplace declared  that by this invention the life-work of an astronomer was doubled.    Jeremiah Horrocks (born 1619, died 1641) was an ardent admirer of  Tycho Brahe and Kepler, and was able to improve the Rudolphine tables  so much that he foretold a transit of Venus, in 1639, which these  tables failed to indicate, and was the only observer of it. His life  was short, but he accomplished a great deal, and rightly ascribed the  lunar inequality called _evection_ to variations in the value of  the eccentricity and in the direction of the line of apses, at the  same time correctly assigning _the disturbing force of the Sun_  as the cause. He discovered the errors in Jupiter's calculated place,  due to what we now know as the long inequality of Jupiter and Saturn,  and measured with considerable accuracy the acceleration at that date  of Jupiter's mean motion, and indicated the retardation of Saturn's  mean motion.    Horrocks' investigations, so far as they could be collected, were  published posthumously in 1672, and seldom, if ever, has a man who  lived only twenty-two years originated so much scientific knowledge.    At this period British science received a lasting impetus by the wise  initiation of a much-abused man, Charles II., who founded the Royal  Society of London, and also the Royal Observatory of Greeenwich, where  he established Flamsteed as first Astronomer Royal, especially for  lunar and stellar observations likely to be useful for navigation. At  the same time the French Academy and the Paris Observatory were  founded. All this within fourteen years, 1662-1675.    Meanwhile gravitation in general terms was being discussed by Hooke,  Wren, Halley, and many others.  All of these men felt a repugnance to  accept the idea of a force acting across the empty void of space.  Descartes (1596-1650) proposed an ethereal medium whirling round the  sun with the planets, and having local whirls revolving with the  satellites. As Delambre and Grant have said, this fiction only  retarded the progress of pure science. It had no sort of relation to  the more modern, but equally misleading, \"nebular hypothesis.\" While  many were talking and guessing, a giant mind was needed at this stage  to make things clear.        7. SIR ISAAC NEWTON--LAW OF UNIVERSAL GRAVITATION.      We now reach the period which is the culminating point of interest in  the history of dynamical astronomy.  Isaac Newton was born in  1642.
