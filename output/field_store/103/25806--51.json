One--and the most Infantile of all--not of the Family, has  a distinctive note, a copyright tone which none imitates, and which  becomes at times a sonorous swelling boom, a lofty recitative, for even an  island has its temper and its moods.    PLANS AND PERFORMANCES    \"The folly of this island! They say there's but five upon this isle; we  are two of them; if the other three be brained like us the State  totters!\"      The scheme for the establishment of our island home comprehended several  minor industries. This isle of dreams, of quietude and happiness; this  fretless scene; this plot of the Garden of Eden, was not to be left  entirely in its primitive state. It was firmly resolved that our  interference should be considerate and slight; that there should be no  rude and violent upsetting of the old order of things; but just a gentle  restraint upon an extravagant expression here and there, a little  orderliness, and ever so light a touch of practicability. A certain  acreage of land was to be cleared for the cultivation of tropical fruits;  of vegetables for everyday use, and of maize and millet for poultry,  which we proposed to breed for home consumption. Bees were to be an  ultimate source of profit. There are millions of living proofs of direct  but vagrant descent from the Italian stock, with which we started,  humming all over this and the adjacent islands to-day.    How we went about the practical accomplishment of our plans; in what  particulars they failed; what proportion of success was achieved, and the  process of education in rural enterprises generally, it were idle to  account. Rather, an attempt must be made to give particulars of the  project as a whole as it stands after a period of nine years. Be it  understood that we depended almost solely on the aid of the blacks. Means  at command did not permit the employment of even a single white workman,  save for a brief experimental period. Indeed, there is yet to be found in  Australia the phase of tropical agriculture which affords payment of the  ruling rate of wages. The proximity of countries in which cheap labour  predominates counterbalances the minimum demand of white men in these  parts. Those who have had experience of aboriginals as labourers,  understand their erratic disposition; yet with considerate treatment, the  exact and prompt fulfilment of obligations and promises, the display of  some little sympathy with their foibles, interest in their doings, and  ready response to any desire expressed to \"walk about,\" they are not  wholly to be set at naught as labourers. Some are intelligent and honest  to a degree, and when in the humour will work steadily and consistently.  When not in humour, it is well to accept the fact cheerfully.    Here I must have leave to be candid, so that the reader may be under no  misapprehension as to the exact circumstances under which the undertaking  progressed. Income from the land as the result of agricultural operations  was not absolutely necessary. This acknowledgment does not imply the  possession of, or any disrespect for, \"the cumbersome luggage of riches,\"  nor any affectation; but rather an accommodating and frugal  disposition--the capacity to turn to account the excellent moral that  poor Mr Micawber lamented his inability to obey. Profit from the sale of  produce and poultry would have supplied additional comforts which would  have been cordially appreciated; but if no returns came, then there was  that state of mind which enabled us to endure the deprivation as the  Psalmist suffered fools. And shall not this be accounted unto us for  righteousness? Shall we not enjoy the warm comfort of virtue? We were at  liberty to reflect with the Vicar of Wakefield--\"We have still enough  left for happiness, if we are wise; and let us draw upon content for the  deficiencies of fortune.\" Certainly, we were not inclined to risk that  which thriftily employed provided for all absolute necessaries on the  chance of securing that which might, after all, prove to be superfluous.  At least, there remains the consciousness of having lived, and of having  wrought no evil (not having interfered in recent Federal Legislation),  and being able to enjoy the sleep which is said to be that of the just.    Occasionally there are as many as four blacks about the place. They come  and go from the mainland, some influenced by the wish for the diet of  oysters for a time. \"Me want sit down now; me want eat oyster.\" At rare  intervals we are entirely alone for months together, and then cultural  operations stand still. Twice, a considerable portion of the plantation  was silently overrun by the scouts of the jungle, and had to be  re-surveyed in order to locate smothered-up orange-trees. Our staff,  domestic and otherwise, usually consists of one boy and his gin, and save  for the housework, affairs are not conducted on a serious or systematic  plan. The spur necessity not being applied, there is no persistent or  sustained effort to make a profit, and, of course, none is earned.    In a few months from the felling of the first strip of jungle and the  burning off of the timber and rubbish, however, we grew produce that went  towards the maintenance of the establishment. That pious old man who  lived to the majestic age of 105, and during the last ninety years  existed wholly upon bread and water, was not the only one who had \"a  certain lusting after salad.\" Until we grew fruit, the papaw, the  quickest and amongst the best, vegetables were more necessary.    Our plantation, all carved out of the jungle, has an area of 4 1/2 acres.  We have orange-trees (two varieties), just coming into bearing, and from  which profits are expected; pineapples (two varieties), papaws, coffee  (ARABICA), custard apples, sour sop, jack fruit, pomegranate, the  litchee, and mangoes in plenty. Sweet potatoes are always in successive  cultivation, also pumpkins and melons, and an occasional crop of maize.  Bananas represent a staple food. We have had fair crops of English  potatoes, and have grown strawberries of fine flavour, though of  deficient size, among the banana plants. Parsley, mint, and all \"the  vulgar herbs\" grow freely. Readers in less favoured climes may hardly  credit the statement that pineapples are so plentiful in the season in  North Queensland that they are fed to pigs as well as horses. Twenty good  pines for sixpence!--who would cultivate the fruit and market it for such  remuneration? Hundreds of tons of mangoes go absolutely to waste every  year. The taste for this wholesome and most delicious fruit has not yet  become established in the large centres of population of Australia. At  one time the same could he said of bananas; but now the trade has become  prodigious. The era of the mango has yet to come.    The original cedar hut now forms an annexe to a bungalow designed, in so  far as means permitted, as a concession to the dominating characteristics  of the clime. Around the house is an acre or so given over to an attempt  to keep up appearances.    Poultry are comfortably housed; a small flock of goats provides milk and  occasionally fresh meat. There are two horses (one a native of the  island) to perform casual heavy work; the boat has a shed into which she  is reluctantly hauled by means of a windlass to spend the rowdy months;  there is a buoy in the bay to which she is greatly attached when she is  not sulking in the shed or coyly submitting to the caresses of the waves.    It may have been anticipated that I would, Thoreau-like, set down in  details and in figures the exact character and cost of every designed  alteration to this scene; but the idea, as soon as it occurred, was  sternly suppressed, for however cheerful a disciple I am of that  philosopher, far be it from me to belittle him by parody.    A good portion of the house represents the work of my own unaccustomed  hands. I have found how laborious an occupation fencing is, and how very  exasperating if barbed wire is used; that the keeping in order of even a  small plantation in which ill-bred and riotous plants grow with the  rapidity of the prophet's gourd, and which if unattended would lapse in a  very brief space of time into the primitive condition of tangled jungle,  involves incessant labour of the most sweatful kind. A work on structural  botany tells me that \"the average rate of perspiration in plants has been  estimated as equal to that of seventeen times that of man.\" Only dwellers  in the tropics are capable of realising the profundity of those pregnant  words. Nowhere does plant life so thrive and so squander itself. And to  toil among all this seething, sweating vegetation! No wonder that the  trashing of sugar-cane is not a popular pastime among Britishers.    Given a quiet and contented mind, a banana-grove, a patch of sweet  potatoes, orange and mango and papaw trees, a few coffee plants; the sea  for fish, the rocks for oysters; the mangrove flats for crabs, and is it  not possible to become fat with a minimum of labour? Fewer statements  have found wider publicity than that the banana contains more nutriment  than meat. I have good reason to have faith--faith in it. In Queensland  every man has to find money for direct and indirect taxation; but apart  from the imposts upon living, moving and having being, what ready money  does a man want beyond a few shillings for tea, sugar and other luxuries,  and some few articles of essential clothing? But I am attempting to  describe a special set of circumstances, and would not have it on my  conscience that I indirectly offered encouragement even to a forlorn and  shipwrecked brother to abandon hope of becoming the prime minister of the  Commonwealth, and to enter upon a life of reckless irresponsibility such  as mine.    As soon as test and trial proved in this special case that life on the  periphery of the whirl of civilisation was not only endurable but \"so  would we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/512"],[0,"Mosses from an Old Manse, and Other Stories (#9)"],[1,"have been too much. She looked redundant with  life, health, and energy; all of which attributes were bound down and  compressed, as it were and girdled tensely, in their luxuriance, by her  virgin zone. Yet Giovanni's fancy must have grown morbid while he  looked down into the garden; for the impression which the fair stranger  made upon him was as if here were another flower, the human sister of  those vegetable ones, as beautiful as they, more beautiful than the  richest of them, but still to be touched only with a glove, nor to be  approached without a mask. As Beatrice came down the garden path, it  was observable that she handled and inhaled the odor of several of the  plants which her father had most sedulously avoided.    \"Here, Beatrice,\" said the latter, \"see how many needful offices  require to be done to our chief treasure. Yet, shattered as I am, my  life might pay the penalty of approaching it so closely as  circumstances demand. Henceforth, I fear, this plant must be consigned  to your sole charge.\"    \"And gladly will I undertake it,\" cried again the rich tones of the  young lady, as she bent towards the magnificent plant and opened her  arms as if to embrace it. \"Yes, my sister, my splendour, it shall be  Beatrice's task to nurse and serve thee; and thou shalt reward her with  thy kisses and perfumed breath, which to her is as the breath of life.\"    Then, with all the tenderness in her manner that was so strikingly  expressed in her words, she busied herself with such attentions as the  plant seemed to require; and Giovanni, at his lofty window, rubbed his  eyes and almost doubted whether it were a girl tending her favorite  flower, or one sister performing the duties of affection to another.  The scene soon terminated. Whether Dr. Rappaccini had finished his  labors in the garden, or that his watchful eye had caught the  stranger's face, he now took his daughter's arm and retired. Night was  already closing in; oppressive exhalations seemed to proceed from the  plants and steal upward past the open window; and Giovanni, closing the  lattice, went to his couch and dreamed of a rich flower and beautiful  girl. Flower and maiden were different, and yet the same, and fraught  with some strange peril in either shape.    But there is an influence in the light of morning that tends to rectify  whatever errors of fancy, or even of judgment, we may have incurred  during the sun's decline, or among the shadows of the night, or in the  less wholesome glow of moonshine. Giovanni's first movement, on  starting from sleep, was to throw open the window and gaze down into  the garden which his dreams had made so fertile of mysteries. He was  surprised and a little ashamed to find how real and matter-of-fact an  affair it proved to be, in the first rays of the sun which gilded the  dew-drops that hung upon leaf and blossom, and, while giving a brighter  beauty to each rare flower, brought everything within the limits of  ordinary experience. The young man rejoiced that, in the heart of the  barren city, he had the privilege of overlooking this spot of lovely  and luxuriant vegetation. It would serve, he said to himself, as a  symbolic language to keep him in communion with Nature. Neither the  sickly and thoughtworn Dr. Giacomo Rappaccini, it is true, nor his  brilliant daughter, were now visible; so that Giovanni could not  determine how much of the singularity which he attributed to both was  due to their own qualities and how much to his wonder-working fancy;  but he was inclined to take a most rational view of the whole matter.    In the course of the day he paid his respects to Signor Pietro  Baglioni, professor of medicine in the university, a physician of  eminent repute to whom Giovanni had brought a letter of introduction.  The professor was an elderly personage, apparently of genial nature,  and habits that might almost be called jovial. He kept the young man to  dinner, and made himself very agreeable by the freedom and liveliness  of his conversation, especially when warmed by a flask or two of Tuscan  wine. Giovanni, conceiving that men of science, inhabitants of the same  city, must needs be on familiar terms with one another, took an  opportunity to mention the name of Dr. Rappaccini. But the professor  did not respond with so much cordiality as he had anticipated.    \"Ill would it become a teacher of the divine art of medicine,\" said  Professor Pietro Baglioni, in answer to a question of Giovanni, \"to  withhold due and well-considered praise of a physician so eminently  skilled as Rappaccini; but, on the other hand, I should answer it but  scantily to my conscience were I to permit a worthy youth like  yourself, Signor Giovanni, the son of an ancient friend, to imbibe  erroneous ideas respecting a man who might hereafter chance to hold  your life and death in his hands. The truth is, our worshipful Dr.  Rappaccini has as much science as any member of the faculty--with  perhaps one single exception--in Padua, or all Italy; but there are  certain grave objections to his professional character.\"    \"And what are they?\" asked the young man.    \"Has my friend Giovanni any disease of body or heart, that he is so  inquisitive about physicians?\" said the professor, with a smile. \"But  as for Rappaccini, it is said of him--and I, who know the man well, can  answer for its truth--that he cares infinitely more for science than  for mankind. His patients are interesting to him only as subjects for  some new experiment. He would sacrifice human life, his own among the  rest, or whatever else was dearest to him, for the sake of adding so  much as a grain of mustard seed to the great heap of his accumulated  knowledge.\"    \"Methinks he is an awful man indeed,\" remarked Guasconti, mentally  recalling the cold and purely intellectual aspect of Rappaccini. \"And  yet, worshipful professor, is it not a noble spirit? Are there many men  capable of so spiritual a love of science?\"    \"God forbid,\" answered the professor, somewhat testily; \"at least,  unless they take sounder views of the healing art than those adopted by  Rappaccini. It is his theory that all medicinal virtues are comprised  within those substances which we term vegetable poisons. These he  cultivates with his own hands, and is said even to have produced new  varieties of poison, more horribly deleterious than Nature, without the  assistance of this learned person, would ever have plagued the world  withal. That the signor doctor does less mischief than might be  expected with such dangerous substances is undeniable. Now and then, it  must be owned, he has effected, or seemed to effect, a marvellous cure;  but, to tell you my private mind, Signor Giovanni, he should receive  little credit for such instances of success,--they being probably the  work of chance,--but should be held strictly accountable for his  failures, which may justly be considered his own work.\"    The youth might have taken Baglioni's opinions with many grains of  allowance had he known that there was a professional warfare of long  continuance between him and Dr. Rappaccini, in which the latter was  generally thought to have gained the advantage. If the reader be  inclined to judge for himself, we refer him to certain black-letter  tracts on both sides, preserved in the medical department of the  University of Padua.    \"I know not, most learned professor,\" returned Giovanni, after musing  on what had been said of Rappaccini's exclusive zeal for science,--\"I  know not how dearly this physician may love his art; but surely there  is one object more dear to him. He has a daughter.\"    \"Aha!\" cried the professor, with a laugh. \"So now our friend Giovanni's  secret is out. You have heard of this daughter, whom all the young men  in Padua are wild about, though not half a dozen have ever had the good  hap to see her face. I know little of the Signora Beatrice save that  Rappaccini is said to have instructed her deeply in his science, and  that, young and beautiful as fame reports her, she is already qualified  to fill a professor's chair. Perchance her father destines her for  mine! Other absurd rumors there be, not worth talking about or  listening to. So now, Signor Giovanni, drink off your glass of  lachryma.\"    Guasconti returned to his lodgings somewhat heated with the wine he had  quaffed, and which caused his brain to swim with strange fantasies in  reference to Dr. Rappaccini and the beautiful Beatrice. On his way,  happening to pass by a florist's, he bought a fresh bouquet of flowers.    Ascending to his chamber, he seated himself near the window, but within  the shadow thrown by the depth of the wall, so that he could look down  into the garden with little risk of being discovered. All beneath his  eye was a solitude. The strange plants were basking in the sunshine,  and now and then nodding gently to one another, as if in acknowledgment  of sympathy and kindred. In the midst, by the shattered fountain, grew  the magnificent shrub, with its purple gems clustering all over it;  they glowed in the air, and gleamed back again out of the depths of the  pool, which thus seemed to overflow with colored radiance from the rich  reflection that was steeped in it. At first, as we have said, the  garden was a solitude. Soon, however,--as Giovanni had half hoped, half  feared, would be the case,--a figure appeared beneath the antique  sculptured portal, and came down between the rows of plants, inhaling  their various perfumes as if she were one of those beings of old  classic fable that lived upon sweet odors. On again beholding Beatrice,  the young man was even startled to perceive how much her beauty  exceeded his recollection of it; so brilliant, so vivid, was its  character, that she glowed amid the sunlight, and, as Giovanni  whispered to himself, positively illuminated the more shadowy intervals  of the garden path. Her face being now more revealed than on the former "]]]
