Is it so?\"    \"No, I think not. I do not understand myself as yet, I am so young, and  this so sudden. Give me time, Frank.\"    She blushed and fluttered now, looked half angry, half beseeching, and  altogether lovely.    \"How much time shall I give? It cannot take long to read a heart like  yours, dear.\" And fancying her emotion a propitious omen, he assumed the  lover in good earnest.    \"Give me time till the New Year. I will answer then, and, meantime,  leave me free to study both myself and you. We have known each other  long, I own, but, still, this changes everything, and makes you seem  another person. Be patient, Frank, and I will try to make my duty a  pleasure.\"    \"I will. God bless you for the kind hope, Octavia. It has been mine for  years, and if I lose it, it will go hardly with me.\"    Later in the evening General Snowdon stood examining the antique screen.  In many places carved oak was pierced quite through, so that voices were  audible from behind it. The musicians had gone down to supper, the young  folk were quietly busy at the other end of the hall, and as the old  gentleman admired the quaint carving, the sound of his own name caught  his ear. The housekeeper and butler still remained, though the other  servants had gone, and sitting cosily behind the screen chatted in low  tones believing themselves secure.    \"It _was_ Mrs. Snowdon, Adam, as I'm a living woman, though I wouldn't  say it to anyone but you. She and Sir Jasper were here wrapped in  cloaks, and up to mischief, I'll be bound. She is a beauty, but I don't  envy her, and there'll be trouble in the house if she stays long.\"    \"But how do you know, Mrs. Benson, she was here? Where's your proof,  mum?\" asked the pompous butler.    \"Look at this, and then look at the outlandish trimming of the lady's  dress. You men are so dull about such matters you'd never observe these  little points. Well, I was here first after Patty, and my light shone on  this jet ornament lying near where she saw the spirit. No one has any  such tasty trifles but Mrs. Snowdon, and these are all over her gown. If  that ain't proof, what is?\"    \"Well, admitting it, I then say what on earth should she and Master be  up here for, at such a time?\" asked the slow-witted butler.    \"Adam, we are old servants of the family, and to you I'll say what  tortures shouldn't draw from to another. Master has been wild, as you  know, and it's my belief that he loved this lady abroad. There was a  talk of some mystery, or misdeed, or misfortune, more than a year ago,  and she was in it. I'm loath to say it, but I think Master loves her  still, and she him. The general is an old man, she is but young, and so  spirited and winsome she can't in reason care for him as for a fine,  gallant gentleman like Sir Jasper. There's trouble brewing, Adam, mark  my words. There's trouble brewing for the Trehernes.\"    So low had the voices fallen that the listener could not have caught the  words had not his ear been strained to the utmost. He did hear all, and  his wasted face flashed with the wrath of a young man, then grew pale  and stern as he turned to watch his wife. She stood apart from the  others talking to Sir Jasper, who looked unusually handsome and debonair  as he fanned her with a devoted air.    Perhaps it is true, thought the old man bitterly. They are well matched,  were lovers once, no doubt, and long to be so again. Poor Edith, I was  very blind. And with his gray head bowed upon his breast the general  stole away, carrying an arrow in his brave old heart.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Blanche, come here and rest, you will be ill tomorrow; and I promised  Mamma to take care of you.\" With which elder-sisterly command Rose led  the girl to an immense old chair, which held them both. \"Now listen to  me and follow my advice, for I am wise in my generation, though not yet  gray. They are all busy, so leave them alone and let me show you what is  to be done.\"    Rose spoke softly, but with great resolution, and nodded her pretty head  so energetically that the holly berries came rolling over her white  shoulders.    \"We are not as rich as we might be, and must establish ourselves as soon  and as well as possible. I intend to be Lady Treherne. You can be the  Honorable Mrs. Annon, if you give your mind to it.\"    \"My dear child, are you mad?\" whispered Blanche.    \"Far from it, but you will be if you waste your time on Maurice. He is  poor, and a cripple, though very charming, I admit. He loves Tavie, and  she will marry him, I am sure. She can't endure Frank, but tries to  because my lady commands it. Nothing will come of it, so try your  fascinations and comfort the poor man; sympathy now will foster love  hereafter.\"    \"Don't talk so here, Rose, someone will hear us,\" began her sister, but  the other broke in briskly.    \"No fear, a crowd is the best place for secrets. Now remember what I  say, and make your game while the ball is rolling. Other people are  careful not to put their plans into words, but I'm no hypocrite, and say  plainly what I mean. Bear my sage counsel in mind and act wisely. Now  come and begin.\"    Treherne was sitting alone by one of the great fires, regarding the gay  scene with serious air. For him there was neither dancing nor games; he  could only roam about catching glimpses of forbidden pleasures,  impossible delights, and youthful hopes forever lost to him. Sad but not  morose was his face, and to Octavia it was a mute reproach which she  could not long resist. Coming up as if to warm herself, she spoke to him  in her usually frank and friendly way, and felt her heart beat fast when  she saw how swift a change her cordial manner wrought in him.    \"How pretty your holly is! Do you remember how we used to go and gather  it for festivals like this, when we were happy children?\" he asked,  looking up at her with eyes full of tender admiration.    \"Yes, I remember. Everyone wears it tonight as a badge, but you have  none. Let me get you a bit, I like to have you one of us in all things.\"    She leaned forward to break a green sprig from the branch over the  chimneypiece; the strong draft drew in her fleecy skirt, and in an  instant she was enveloped in flames.    \"Maurice, save me, help me!\" cried a voice of fear and agony, and  before anyone could reach her, before he himself knew how the deed was  done, Treherne had thrown himself from his chair, wrapped the tiger  skin tightly about her, and knelt there clasping her in his arms  heedless of fire, pain, or the incoherent expressions of love that  broke from his lips.          Chapter VI      MIRACLES    Great was the confusion and alarm which reigned for many minutes, but  when the panic subsided two miracles appeared. Octavia was entirely  uninjured, and Treherne was standing on his feet, a thing which for  months he had not done without crutches. In the excitement of the  moment, no one observed the wonder; all were crowding about the girl,  who, pale and breathless but now self-possessed, was the first to  exclaim, pointing to her cousin, who had drawn himself up, with the  help of his chair, and leaned there smiling, with a face full of  intense delight.    \"Look at Maurice! Oh, Jasper, help him or he'll fall!\"    Sir Jasper sprung to his side and put a strong arm about him, while a  chorus of wonder, sympathy, and congratulations rose about them.    \"Why, lad, what does it mean? Have you been deceiving us all this  time?\" cried Jasper, as Treherne leaned on him, looking exhausted but  truly happy.    \"It means that I am not to be a cripple all my life; that they did not  deceive me when they said a sudden shock might electrify me with a more  potent magnetism than any they could apply. It _has_, and if I am cured  I owe it all to you, Octavia.\"    He stretched his hands to her with a gesture of such passionate  gratitude that the girl covered her face to hide its traitorous  tenderness, and my lady went to him, saying brokenly, as she embraced  him with maternal warmth, \"God bless you for this act, Maurice, and  reward you with a perfect cure. To you I owe the lives of both my  children; how can I thank you as I ought?\"    \"I dare not tell you yet,\" he whispered eagerly, then added, \"I am  growing faint, Aunt. Get me away before I make a scene.\"    This hint recalled my lady to her usual state of dignified  self-possession. Bidding Jasper and the major help Treherne to his room  without delay, she begged Rose to comfort her sister, who was sobbing  hysterically, and as they all obeyed her, she led her daughter away to  her own apartment, for the festivities of the evening were at an end.    At the same time Mrs. Snowdon and Annon bade my lady good-night, as if  they also were about to retire, but as they reached the door of the  gallery Mrs. Snowdon paused and beckoned Annon back. They were alone  now, and, standing before the fire which had so nearly made that  Christmas Eve a tragical one, she turned to him with a face full of  interest and sympathy as she said, nodding toward the blackened shreds  of Octavia's dress, and the scorched tiger skin which still lay at their  feet, \"That was both a fortunate and an unfortunate little affair, but I  fear Maurice's gain will be your loss. Pardon my frankness for Octavia's  sake; she is a fine creature, and I long to see her given to one worthy  of her. I am a woman to read faces quickly; I know that your suit does  not prosper as you would have it, and I desire to help you. May I?\"    \"Indeed you may, and command any service of me in return. But to what do  I owe this unexpected friendliness?\" cried Annon, both grateful and  surprised.    \"To my regard for the young lady, my wish to save her from an  unworthy man.\"    \"Do you mean Treherne?\" asked Annon, more and more amazed.    \"I do. Octavia must not marry a gambler!\"    \"My dear lady,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/87"],[0,"The 1993 CIA World Factbook (#9)"],[1," OAU, SADC, UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UNIDO, UPU, WCL, WFTU, WHO, WIPO, WMO, WTO  Diplomatic representation in US:    none   representation:    Jose PATRICIO, Permanent Observer to the Organization of American States   address:    Permanent Observer to the Organization of American States, 1899 L Street,    NW, 5th floor, Washington, DC 20038   telephone:    (202) 785-1156   FAX:    (202) 785-1258  US diplomatic representation:   director:    Edmund DE JARNETTE   liaison office:    Rua Major Kanhangolo, Nes 132/138, Luanda   mailing address:    CP6484, Luanda, Angola (mail international); USLO Luanda, Department of    State, Washington, D.C. 20521-2550 (pouch)   telephone:    [244] (2) 34-54-81   FAX:    [244] (2) 39-05-15   note:    the US maintains a liaison office in Luanda accredited to the Joint    Political Military Commission that oversees implementation of the Angola    Peace Accords; this office does not perform any commercial or consular    services; the US does not maintain diplomatic relations with the Government    of the Republic of Angola  Flag:    two equal horizontal bands of red (top) and black with a centered yellow    emblem consisting of a five-pointed star within half a cogwheel crossed by a    machete (in the style of a hammer and sickle)    *Angola, Economy    Overview:    Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 80-90% of the    population, but accounts for less than 15% of GDP. Oil production is vital    to the economy, contributing about 60% to GDP. Bitter internal fighting    continues to severely affect the nonoil economy, and food needs to be    imported. For the long run, Angola has the advantage of rich natural    resources in addition to oil, notably gold, diamonds, and arable land. To    realize its economic potential Angola not only must secure domestic peace    but also must reform government policies that have led to distortions and    imbalances throughout the economy.
