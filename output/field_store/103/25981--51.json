Great Scott! What does this mean? 'Gross carelessness! Poor  idea of a joke! No person with your idea of responsibility will ever be  my son-in-law!' Box labeled 'open with care!' Why--why--what does it  all mean?\"    Tom read the letter over again, and his murmurs of astonishment were so  loud that Mr. Damon, in the next room, called out:    \"What's the matter, Tom? Get bad news?\"    \"Bad news? I should say so! Mary--her father--he forbids me to see her  again. Says I tried to dynamite them all--or at least scare them into  believing I was going to. I can't understand it!\"    \"Tell me about it, Tom,\" suggested Mr. Damon, coming into Tom's  stateroom. \"Bless my gunpowder keg! what does it mean?\"    Thereupon Tom told of having purchased the gift for Mary, and of  having, at the last minute, told Eradicate to put it in a box and  deliver it at the Nestor home.    \"Which he evidently did,\" Tom went on, \"but when it got there Mary's  present was in a box labeled 'Dynamite. Handle with care.' I never sent  that.\"    Mr. Damon read over Mr. Nestor's letter which had lain so long in Tom's  pocket unopened.    \"I think I see how it happened,\" said the old man.  \"Eradicate can't  read; can he, Tom?\"    \"No, but he pretends he can.\"    \"And did you have any empty boxes marked dynamite in your laboratory?\"    \"Why yes, I believe I did. I used dynamite as one of the ingredients of  my new explosive.\"    \"Well then, it's as clear as daylight. Eradicate, being unable to read,  took one of the empty dynamite boxes in which to pack Mary's present.  That's how it happened.\"    Tom thought for a moment. Then he burst into a laugh.    \"That's it,\" he said, a bit ruefully. \"That's the explanation. No  wonder Mr. Nestor was roiled. He thought I was playing a joke. I'll  have to explain. But how?\"    \"By letter,\" said Mr. Damon.    \"Too slow. I'll send a wireless,\" decided Tom, and he began the  composition of a message that cost him considerable in tolls before he  had hit on the explanation that suited him.    \"That ought to clear the atmosphere,\" he said when the wireless had  shot his message into the ether. \"Whew!  And to think, all this while,  Mary and her folks have believed that I tried to play a miserable joke  on them! My! My! I wonder if they'll ever forgive me. When I get hold  of Eradicate--\"    \"Better teach him to read if he's going to do up love packages,\"  interrupted Mr. Damon, dryly.    \"I will,\" decided the young inventor.    The Bellaconda stopped at Panama and then kept on her way south. Soon  after that she ran into a severe tropical storm, and for a time there  was some excitement among the passengers. The more timid of them put on  life preservers, though the captain and his officers assured them there  was no danger.    Tom and Mr. Titus, descending from the deck, whence they had been  warned by one of the mates, were on their way to their stateroom,  walking with some difficulty owing to the roll of the ship.    As they approached their quarters the door of a stateroom farther up  the passage opened, and a head was thrust out.    \"Will you send a steward to me?\" a man requested. \"I am feeling very  ill, and need assistance.\"    \"Certainly,\" Tom answered, and at that moment he heard Mr. Titus utter  an exclamation.    \"What is it?\" asked Tom, for the man who had appealed for help, had  withdrawn his head.    \"That--that man!\" exclaimed the contractor. \"That was Waddington, the  tool of our rivals.\"    \"Waddington!\" repeated Tom, with a look at the now closed door. \"Why,  the bearded man has that stateroom--the bearded man who so nearly lost  the steamer. He isn't Waddington!\"    \"And I tell you Waddington is in that room!\" insisted the contractor.  \"I only saw the upper part of his face, but I'd know his eyes anywhere.  Waddington is spying on us!\"          Chapter IX    The Bomb      Tom Swift and Mr. Titus withdrew a little way down the corridor, around  a bulkhead and out of sight of any one who might look out from the  stateroom whence had come the appeal for help. But, at the same time,  they could keep watch over it.    \"I tell you Waddington is in there!\" insisted Mr. Titus, hoarsely  whispering.    \"Well, perhaps he may be,\" admitted Tom. \"But several times I have seen  the bearded man going in there, and it's only a single stateroom, for  it's so marked on the deck plan.\"    \"Waddington might be disguised with a false beard, Tom.\"    \"Yes, he might. But did the man who just now looked out have a beard?\"    \"I couldn't tell, as I saw only the upper part of his face. But those  were Waddington's shifty eyes, I'm positive.\"    \"If Waddington were on board don't you suppose you would have seen him  before this?\"    \"Not positively, no. If he and the bearded man are one and the same  that would account for it. But I haven't noticed the bearded man once  since he came aboard in such a hurry.\"    \"Nor have I, now that I come to think of it,\" Tom admitted. \"However,  there is an easy way to prove who is in there.\"    \"How?\"    \"We'll knock on the door and go in.\"    \"Perhaps he won't let us.\"    \"He'll think it's the steward he called for. Come, you know Waddington  better than I do. You knock and go in.\"    \"I don't know Waddington very well,\" admitted the contractor. \"I have  only seen him a few times, but I am sure that was he. But what shall I  do when he sees I'm not the steward?\"    \"Tell him you have sent for one. I'll go with the message, so it will  be true enough. Even if you have only a momentary glance at him in  close quarters you ought to be able to tell whether or not he has on a  false beard, and whether or not it is Waddington.\"    Mr. Titus considered for a moment, and then he said:    \"Yes, I guess that is a good plan. You go for the steward, Tom, and  I'll see if I can get in that stateroom. But I'm sure I'm not mistaken.  I'll find Waddington in there, perhaps in the person of the bearded  man, disguised. Or else they are using a single stateroom as a double  one.\" And while Tom went off down the pitching and rolling corridor to  find a steward, Mr. Titus, not without some apprehension, advanced to  knock on the door of the suspect.    \"If it is Waddington he'll know me at once, of course,\" thought the  contractor, \"and there may be a row. Well, I can't help it. The success  of my brother and myself depends on finishing that tunnel, and we can't  have Waddington, and those whose tool he is, interfering. Here goes!\"    He tapped on the door, and a faint voice called:    \"Come in!\"    The contractor entered, and saw the bearded man lying in his berth.    \"Is there anything I can do for you?\" asked the contractor, bending  close over the man. He wanted to see if the beard were false. Somewhat  to his surprise the contractor saw that undoubtedly it was real.    \"Steward, will you kindly get me--Oh, you're not the steward!\" the  bearded man exclaimed.    \"No, my friend and I heard you call,\" replied the contractor. \"He has  gone for the steward, who will be here soon. Can I do anything for you  in the meanwhile?\"    \"No--not a thing!\" was the rather snappish answer, and the man turned  his face away. \"I beg your pardon,\" he went on, as if conscious that he  had acted rudely, \"but I am suffering very much. The steward knows just  what I want. I have had these attacks before. I am a poor sailor. If  you will send the steward to me I will be obliged to you. He can fix me  up.\"    \"Very well,\" assented Mr. Titus. \"But if there is anything I can do--\"    At that moment footsteps and voices were heard in the corridor, and as  the door of the bearded man's stateroom was opened, Mr. Titus had a  glimpse of Tom and one of the stewards.    \"Yes, I'll look after him,\" the steward said \"He's been this way  before. Thank you, sir, for calling me.\"    \"I guess the steward has been well tipped,\" thought Tom.  As Mr. Titus  came out and the door was shut, the young inventor asked in a whisper,    \"Well, was it he?\"    The contractor shook his head.    \"No,\" he answered. \"I never was more surprised in my life.  I felt sure  it was Waddington in there, but it wasn't. That man's beard is real,  and while he has a look like Waddington about the eyes and upper part  of his face, the man is a stranger to me. That is I think so, but in  spite of all that, I have a queer feeling that I have met him before.\"    \"Where?\" Tom inquired.    \"That I can't say,\" and the tunnel contractor shook his head. \"Whew!  That was a bad one!\" he exclaimed, as the steamer pitched and tossed in  an alarming manner.    \"Yes, the storm seems to be getting worse instead of better,\" agreed  Tom. \"I hope none of the cargo shifts and comes banging up against my  new explosive. If it does, there'll be no more tunnel digging for any  of us.\"    \"Better not mention the fact of the explosives on board,\" suggested Mr.  Titus.    \"I won't,\" promised Tom. \"The passengers are frightened enough as it  is. But I watched the powder being stored away.  I guess it is safe.\"    The storm raged for two days before it began to die away.  Meanwhile,  nothing was seen, on deck or in the dining cabins, of the bearded man.    Tom and Mr. Titus made some guarded inquiries of the steward who had  attended the sick man, and from him learned that he was down on the  passenger list as Senor Pinto, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He was  traveling in the interests of a large firm of coffee importers of the  United States, and was going to Lima.    \"And there's no trace of Waddington?\" asked Tom of Mr. Titus, as they  were discussing matters in their stateroom one day.    \"Not a trace. He seems to have dropped out of sight, and I'm glad of  it.\"    \"Perhaps Blakeson & Grinder have given up the fight against you.\"    \"I wish they had, though I don't look for any such good luck. But I'm  willing to fight them, now that we have an even chance, thanks to your  explosive.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/954"],[0,"Tom Swift and His War Tank; Or, Doing His Bit for Uncle Sam (#9)"],[1,"\" insisted the colored man.    \"Why not?\" asked Tom.    \"'Cause Boomerang's on guard, an' yo'-all knows how dat mule of mine  can use his heels!\"    \"I know, Rad,\" went on Tom; \"but this fellow will find a way of keeping  out of their way. We must hurry.\"    \"Oh, he's safe enough,\" declared the colored man. \"I done tole Koku to  stan' guard, too! Dat low-down white trash ob a giant is all right fo'  guardin', but he ain't wuff shucks at detectin'!\" said Eradicate, with  pardonable pride. \"By golly, maybe I's too old t' put on guard, but I  kin detect, all right!\"    \"If this proves true, I'll begin to believe you can,\" replied Tom. \"Hop  along, Ned!\"    Followed by the shuffling and chuckling negro, Tom and Ned went to the  rather insecure stable where the mule Boomerang was kept. That is, the  stable was insecure from the standpoint of a jail. But the sight of the  giant Koku marching up and down in front of the place, armed with a big  club, reassured Tom.    \"Is he in there, Koku?\" asked the young inventor.    \"Yes, Master! He try once come out, but he approach his head very close  my defense weapon and he go back again.\"    \"I should think he would,\" laughed Ned, as he noted the giant's club.    \"Well, Rad, let's have a look at your prisoner. Open the door, Koku,\"  commanded Tom.    \"Better look out,\" advised Ned. \"He may be armed.\"    \"We'll have to take a chance. Besides, I don't believe he is, or he'd  have fired at Koku. There isn't much to fear with the giant ready for  emergencies. Now we'll see who he is. I can't imagine one of my men  turning traitor.\"    The door was opened and a rather miserable-looking man shuffled out.  There was a bloody rag on his head, and he seemed to have made more of  an effort to escape than Koku described, for he appeared to have  suffered in the ensuing fight.    \"Carl Schwen!\" exclaimed Tom. \"So it was you, was it?\"    The German, for such he was, did not answer for a moment. He appeared  downcast, and as if suffering. Then a change came over him. He  straightened up, saluted as a soldier might have done, and a sneering  look came into his face. It was succeeded by one of pride as the man  exclaimed:    \"Yes, it is I! And I tried to do what I tried to do for the Fatherland!  I have failed. Now you will have me shot as a spy, I suppose!\" he added  bitterly.    Tom did not answer directly. He looked keenly at the man, and at last  said:    \"I am sorry to see this. I knew you were a German, Schwen, but I kept  you employed at work that could not, by any possibility, be considered  as used against your country. You are a good machinist, and I needed  you. But if what I hear about you is true, it is the end.\"    \"It is the end,\" said the man simply. \"I tried and failed.  If it had  not been for Eradicate--Well, he's smarter than I gave him credit for,  that's all!\"    The man spoke very good English, with hardly a trace of German accent,  but there was no doubt as to his character.    \"What will you do with him, Tom?\" asked Ned.    \"I don't know. I'll have to do a little investigating first. But he  must be locked up. Schwen,\" went on the young inventor, \"I'm sorry  about this, but I shall have to give you into the custody of a United  States marshal. You are not a naturalized citizen, are you?\"    The man muttered something in German to the effect that he was not  naturalized and was glad of it.    \"Then you come under the head of an enemy alien,\" decided Tom, who  understood what was said, \"and will have to be interned. I had hoped to  avoid this, but it seems it cannot be. I am sorry to lose you, but  there are more important matters. Now let's get at the bottom of this.\"    Schwen was, after a little delay, taken in charge by the proper  officer, and then a search was made of his room, for, in common with  some of the other workmen, he lived in a boarding house not far from  the plant.    There, by a perusal of his papers, enough was revealed to show Tom the  danger he had escaped.    \"And yet I don't know that I have altogether escaped it,\" he said to  Ned, as they talked it over. \"There's no telling how long this spy work  may have been going on. If he has discovered all the secrets of Shop  Thirteen it may be a bad thing for the Allies and--\"    \"Look out!\" warned Ned, with a laugh. \"You'll be saying things you  don't want to, Tom and not at all in keeping with your former silence.\"    \"That's so,\" agreed the young inventor, with a sigh. \"But if things go  right I'll not have to keep silent much longer.  I may be able to tell  you everything.\"    \"Don't tell me--tell Mary,\" advised his chum. \"She feels your silence  more than I do. I know how such things are.\"    \"Well, I'll be able to tell her, too,\" decided Tom. \"That is, if Schwen  hasn't spoiled everything. Look here, Ned, these papers show he's been  in correspondence with Blakeson and Grinder.\"    \"What about, Tom?\"    \"I can't tell. The letters are evidently written in code, and I can't  translate it offhand. But I'll make another attempt at it. And here's  one from a person who signs himself Walter Simpson, but the writing is  in German.\"    \"Walter Simpson!\" cried Ned. \"That's my friend of the tree!\"    \"It is?\" cried Tom. \"Then things begin to fit themselves together.  Simpson is a spy, and he was probably trying to communicate with  Schwen. But the latter didn't get the information he wanted, or, if he  did get it, he wasn't able to pass it on to the man in the tree.  Eradicate nipped him just in time.\"    And, so it seemed, the colored man had done. By accident he had  discovered that Schwen had prevailed on one of the workmen in Shop 13  to change passes with him. This enabled the German spy to gain  admittance to the secret place, which Tom thought was so well guarded.  The man who let Schwen take the pass was in the game, too, it appeared,  and he was also placed under arrest. But he was a mere tool in the pay  of the others, and had no chance to gain valuable information.    A hasty search of Shop 13 did not reveal anything missing, and it was  surmised (for Schwen would not talk) that he had not found time to go  about and get all that he was after.    Soon after Schwen's arrest the \"Spy Tree,\" as Tom called it, was cut  down.    \"Eradicate certainly did better than I ever expected he would,\"  declared Tom. \"Well, if all goes well, there won't be so much need for  secrecy after a day or so. We're going to give her a test, and then--\"    \"Give who a test?\" asked Ned, with a smile.    \"You'll soon see,\" answered Tom, with an answering grin.  \"I hereby  invite you and Mr. Damon to come over to Shop Thirteen day after  to-morrow night and then--Well, you'll see what you'll see.\"    With this Ned had to be content, and he waited anxiously for the  appointed time to come.    \"I surely will be glad when Tom is more like himself,\" he mused, as he  left his chum. \"And I guess Mary will be, too.  I wonder if he's going  to ask her to the exhibition?\"    It developed that Tom had done so, a fact which Ned learned on the  morning of the day set for the test.    \"Come over about nine o'clock,\" Tom said to his chum. \"I guess it will  be dark enough then.\"    Meanwhile Schwen and Otto Kuhn, the other man involved, had been locked  up, and all their papers given into the charge of the United States  authorities. A closer guard than ever was kept over No. 13 shop, and  some of the workmen, against whom there was a slight suspicion, were  transferred.    \"Well, we'll see what we shall see,\" mused Ned on the appointed  evening, when a telephone message from Mr. Damon informed the young  bank clerk that the eccentric man was coming to call for him before  going on to the Swift place.          Chapter X    A Runaway Giant      \"What do you think it's all about, Mr. Damon?\"    \"I'm sure I don't know, Ned.\"    The two were at the home of the young bank clerk, preparing to start  for the Swift place, it being nearly nine o'clock on the evening named  by the youthful inventor.    \"Bless my hat-rack!\" went on the eccentric man, \"but Tom isn't at all  like himself of late. He's working on some invention, I know that, but  it's all I do know. He hasn't given me a hint of it.\"    \"Nor me, nor any of his friends,\" added Ned. \"And he acts so oddly  about enlisting--doesn't want even to speak of it.  How he got exempted  I don't know, but I do know one thing, and that is Tom Swift is for  Uncle Sam first, last and always!\"    \"Oh, of course!\" agreed Mr. Damon. \"Well, we'll soon know, I guess.  We'd better start, Ned.\"    \"It's useless to try to guess what it is Tom is up to. He has kept his  secret well. The nearest any one has come to it was when Harry figured  out that Tom had a band of giant elephants which he was fitting with  coats of steel armor to go against the Germans,\" observed Ned, when he  and Mr. Damon were on their way.    \"Well, that mightn't be so bad,\" agreed Mr. Damon.  \"But--um--elephants--and wild giant ones, too!  Bless my circus ticket,  Ned! do you think we'd better go in that case?\"    \"Oh, Tom hasn't anything like that!\" laughed Ned. \"That was only  Harry's crazy notion after he saw something big and ungainly careening  about the enclosed yard of Shop Thirteen.  Hello, there go Mary Nestor  and her father!\" and Ned pointed to the opposite side of the street  where the girl and Mr. Nestor could be seen in the light of a street  lamp.    \"They're going out to see Tom's secret,\" said Mr. Damon.  \"There's  plenty of room in my car. Let's ask them to go with us.\"    \"Surely,\" agreed Ned, and a moment later he and Mary were in the rear  seat while Mr. Damon and Mr. Nestor were in the front, Mr. Damon at the  wheel, and they were soon speeding down the road.    \"I do hope everything will go all right,\" observed Mary.    \"What do you mean?\" asked Ned.    \"I mean Tom is a little bit anxious about this test.\"    \"Did he tell you what it was to be?\"    \"No; but when he called to invite father and me to be present"]]]
