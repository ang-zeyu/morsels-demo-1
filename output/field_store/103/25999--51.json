Can you guess what it is?\"    \"A book!\"    \"Ah, there must be something of the Yankee about you,\" he answered,  laughing. \"Yes, it is a book in two volumes; just published and a  most delightful, charming story,\" he went on, drawing them from his  pockets, and handing them to her as he spoke.    \"Oh, thank you, sir!\" she cried with eager gratitude, \"I'm so glad,  if--if only papa will allow me to read it. May I, papa?\"    \"I can tell better when I have examined it, my child,\" Mr. Dinsmore  answered, taking one of the volumes from her hands and looking at the  title on the back. \"'The Wide, Wide World!' What sort of a book is it,  Travilla?\"    \"A very good sort. I think. Just glance through it or read a few  pages, and I'm pretty sure it will be sufficient to satisfy you of,  not only its harmlessness, but that its perusal would be a benefit to  almost any one.\"    Mr. Dinsmore did so, Elsie standing beside him, her hand upon his arm,  and her eyes on his face--anxiously watching its changes of expression  as he read. They grew more and more satisfactory; the book was  evidently approving itself to his taste and judgment, and presently  he returned it to her, saying, with a kind fatherly smile, \"Yes, my  child, you may read it. I have no doubt it deserves all the praise Mr.  Travilla has given it.\"    \"Oh, thank you, papa, I'm very glad,\" she answered joyously, \"I am  just hungry for a nice story.\" And seating herself near the light, she  was soon lost to everything about her in the deep interest with which  she was following Ellen Montgomery through her troubles and trials.    She was loath to lay the book aside when at the usual hour--a quarter  before nine--the bell rang for prayers. She hardly heeded the summons  till her papa laid his hand on her shoulder, saying, \"Come, daughter,  you must not be left behind.\"    She started up then, hastily closing the book, and followed the others  to the dining room, where the servants were already assembled to take  part in the family devotions.    Mr. Travilla went away immediately after and now it was Elsie's  bed-time. Her father reminded her of it as, on coming back from seeing  his friend to the door, he found her again poring over the book.    \"Oh, papa, it is so interesting! could you let me finish this  chapter?\" she asked with a very entreating look up into his face as he  stood at her side.    \"I suppose I could if I should make a great effort,\" he answered  laughingly. \"Yes, you may, for once, but don't expect always to be  allowed to do so.\"    \"No, sir, oh, no. Thank you, sir.\"    \"Well, have you come to a good stopping-place?\" he asked, as she  presently closed the book and put it aside with a slight sigh.    \"No, sir, it is just as bad a one as the other. Papa, I wish I was  grown up enough to read another hour before going to bed.\"    \"I don't,\" he said, drawing her to a seat upon his knee, and passing  his arm about her waist, \"I'm not ready to part with my little girl  yet.\"    \"Wouldn't a fine young lady daughter be just as good or better?\" she  asked, giving him a hug.    \"No, not now, some of these days I may think so.\"    \"But mayn't I stay up and read till ten to-night?\"    He shook his head. \"Till half-past nine, then?\"    \"No, not even a till quarter past. Ah, it is that now,\" he added,  consulting his watch.    \"You must say good-night and go. Early hours and plenty of sleep for  my little girl, that she may grow up to healthful, vigorous womanhood,  capable of enjoying life and being very useful in the church and the  world.\" He kissed her with grave tenderness as he spoke.    \"Good-night then, you dear father,\" she said, returning the caress. \"I  know you would indulge me if you thought it for my good.\"    \"Indeed I would, pet. Would it help to reconcile you to the denial  of your wish to know that I shall be reading the book, and probably  enjoying it as much as you would?\"    \"Ah yes, indeed, papa! it is a real pleasure to resign it to you,\" she  answered with a look of delight. \"It's just the nicest story! at least  as far as I've read. Read it aloud to mamma, won't you?\"    \"Yes, if she wishes to hear it. Now away with you to your room and  your bed.\"    Only waiting to bid her mamma an affectionate good-night, Elsie  obeyed, leaving the room with a light step, and a cheerful, happy  face.    \"Dear unselfish child!\" her father said, looking after her.    \"She is that indeed,\" said Rose. \"How happy, shall I be if Horace  grows up to be as good and lovable.\"    Elsie was a fearless horsewoman, accustomed to the saddle from her  very early years. Thus Arthur's wanton attack upon her pony had failed  to give her nerves the severe shock it might have caused to those of  most young girls of her age. Her feeling was more of excitement,  and of indignation at the uncalled-for cruelty to a dumb animal,  especially her own pet horse, than of fright at the danger to herself.  But she well knew that the latter was what her father would think of  first, and that he would be very angry with Arthur; therefore she had  tried, and successfully, to control herself and suppress all signs of  agitation on meeting him upon her return.    She felt glad now as the affair recurred to her recollection while  preparing for the night's rest, that she had been able to do so. For a  moment she questioned with herself whether she was quite right to have  this concealment from her father, but quickly decided that she was.  Had the wrong-doing been her own--that would have made it altogether  another matter.    She was shocked at Arthur's wickedness, troubled and anxious about his  future, but freely forgave his crime against her pony and herself,  and mingled with her nightly petitions an earnest prayer for his  conversion, and his welfare temporal and spiritual.          CHAPTER VI.      O love! thou sternly dost thy power maintain,    And wilt not bear a rival in thy reign.      --DRYDEN.      It was the middle of the forenoon, and Elsie in her own pretty little  sitting room was busied with her books; so deep in study indeed, that  she never noticed a slight girlish figure as it glided in at the glass  doors opening upon the lawn, to-day set wide to admit the air coming  fresh and cool with a faint odor of the far-off sea, pleasantly  mingling with that of the flowers in the garden, on the other side of  the house.    \"Buried alive in her books! Dear me! what a perfect paragon of  industry you are,\" cried the intruder in a lively tone. \"I wish you  would imbue me with some of your love of study.\"    \"Why, Lucy Carrington! how did you get here?\" and Elsie pushed her  books away, rose hastily and greeted her friend with an affectionate  embrace.    \"How? I came in through yonder door, miss; after riding my pony  from Ashlands to the front entrance of this mansion,\" replied Lucy,  courtesying low in mock reverence. \"I hope your ladyship will excuse  the liberty I have taken in venturing uninvited into your sanctum.\"    \"Provided your repentance is deep and sincere,\" returned Elsie in the  same jesting tone.    \"Certainly, I solemnly pledge myself never to do it again till the  next time.\"    \"Sit down, won't you?\" and Elsie pushed forward a low rocking chair.  \"It's so pleasant to see you. But if I had thought about it at all  I should have supposed you were at home, and as busy over books and  lessons as I.\"    \"No; my respected governess, Miss Warren, not feeling very well, has  taken a week's holiday, and left me to do the same. Fancy my afflicted  state at the thought of laying aside my beloved books for seven or  eight whole days.\"    \"You poor creature! how I pity you,\" said Elsie, laughing; \"suppose  you stay here and share the instructions of my tutor; I have no doubt  I could persuade him to receive you as a pupil.\"    \"Horrors! I'm much obliged, very much, but I should die of fright the  first time I had to recite. There, I declare I'm growing poetical,  talking in rhyme all the time.\"    \"Let mammy take your hat and scarf,\" said Elsie. \"You'll stay and  spend the day with me, won't you?\"    \"Thank you, no; I came to carry you off to Ashlands to spend a week.  Will you come?\"    \"I should like to, dearly well, if papa gives permission.\"    \"Well, run and ask him.\"    \"I can't; unfortunately he is out, and not expected to return till  tea-time.\"    \"Oh, pshaw! how provoking! But can't your mamma give permission just  as well?\"    \"If it were only for a day she might, but I know she would say the  question of a longer visit must be referred to papa.\"    \"Dear me! I wouldn't be you for something. Why, I never ask leave of  anybody when I want to pay a visit anywhere in the neighborhood. I  tell mamma I'm going, and that's all-sufficient. I don't see how you  stand being ordered about and controlled so.\"    \"If you'll believe me,\" said Elsie, laughing a gay, sweet, silvery  laugh, \"I really enjoy being controlled by papa. It saves me a deal of  trouble and responsibility in the way of deciding for myself; and then  I love him so dearly that I almost always feel it my greatest pleasure  to do whatever pleases him.\"    \"And he always was so strict with you.\"    \"Yes, he is strict; but oh, so kind.\"    \"But that's just because you're so good; he'd have an awful time  ruling me. I'd be in a chronic state of disgrace and punishment; and  he obliged to be so constantly improving me and frowning sternly upon  my delinquencies that he'd never be able to don a smile of approval or  slip in a word of praise edgewise.\"    \"Indeed you're not half so bad as you pretend,\" said Elsie, laughing  again; \"nor I half so good as you seem determined to believe me.\"    \"No, I've no doubt that you're an arch hypocrite, and we shall find  out one of these days that you are really worse than any of the rest  of us. But now I must finish my errand and go, for I know"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9966"],[0,"The Spartan Twins (#9)"],[1," the long slope and disappeared through the great gate.    In one of the oldest temples on the Acropolis, called the Erechtheum,  there was an ancient wooden statue of Athena which the Athenians believed  had fallen from heaven. It was very sacred in their eyes, and every year  they celebrated a festival when the robes and ornaments of the statue  were taken off and cleaned. This year the maidens of Athens had  embroidered a new and beautiful robe, and it was being carried in state  to the temple to be offered to the Goddess and placed upon her statue.    The Twins had never seen so many people in all their lives before. The  procession was headed by some of the chief men of Athens, and foremost  among them the children recognized Pericles. Near him walked Anaxagoras  the Philosopher, with Phidias, the great sculptor, and Ictinus, the  architect of the new temple of which the Stranger had told the Twins on  the spring evening so long before. There were also Sophocles the  dramatist and Euripides the poet. Melas recognized them all, for they  were known to every one and he had seen them at the house of Pericles or  walking about the Agora on previous journeys. He pointed them out to the  Twins.    \"That queer snub-nosed man back of Sophocles is Socrates the  philosopher,\" he said. \"He is a friend of Pericles also, though he is  poor and queer, and is always standing about the market-place talking to  any one who will listen to him.\"    \"Are there two philosophers in Athens?\" asked Dion. \"I thought Anaxagoras  was the philosopher.\"    Melas laughed. \"Philosophers are as thick in Athens as bees in a hive,\"  he said, \"and poets too.\"    The beautiful embroidered robe, borne on a chariot shaped like a ship,  now appeared in the procession, and the crowd breathed a long sigh of  wonder and admiration as it passed. Then came a long row of young  girls bearing baskets and jars upon their shoulders. They were followed  by older women, for women were allowed to take part in this festival.  After them came youths on horseback, and then more youths leading  garlanded oxen for the sacrifice. The procession was so long that the end  of it was still winding through the streets below some time after the  head had reached the top of the incline. Right up the steep slope it  streamed, between the gaping crowds massed on either side, and when the  very end of it had passed out of sight, the people closed in behind it  and swarmed over the level height of the sacred hill.    Melas and the children pushed their way with the others, but the crowd  was so great and the movement so slow that when at last they got near the  sacred altars before the Erechtheum, the ceremonies were over and the air  was already filled with smoke and the smell of roasting meat.    It was late afternoon before the feasting was over, and, meanwhile, the  entire hill-top of the Acropolis was covered with moving crowds. As a  part of the festival, there were all sorts of games and side shows. Dion  and Daphne were so busy watching sword-swallowers, and tumblers, and men  performing all sorts of strange and wonderful tricks, they almost forgot  entirely the Gorgon's head with the snaky locks, which the Stranger had  told them about, and which Dion so much wished to see. Daphne was the  first to remember it.    \"I'm going to see the new temple that Pericles is building over there.  Don't you want to see it, too?\" said Melas to the Twins. \"Where?\" said  Dion. Melas pointed to a great heap of marble blocks toward the southern  side of the Acropolis. It was then that Daphne thought about the statue.    \"Dion wants to see the Gorgon's head,\" she said.    \"Well, then,\" answered Melas, \"hurry up about it, for it is getting late  and we must soon be starting for your uncle's house.\"    The two children trotted away toward the great bronze statue near the  entrance without another word, and it was not until they were quite out  of sight that Melas remembered he had not told them where to meet him.    \"I shall find them by the statue anyway,\" he said to himself, and went on  examining the foundations of the Parthenon.    Meanwhile the children ran round to the front of the statue and gazed up  at the breastplate of the Goddess, upon which Phidias had carved the  Gorgon's head. There it was with its staring eyes and twisting locks,  looking right down at them.    \"Ugh! I don't like it a bit better than I thought I should,\" said Daphne,  covering her eyes. \"It's worse than eels.\"    \"I'd rather see the man swallowing swords any day,\" answered Dion. \"Let's  go and see if we can't find him again,\" and off they went toward a crowd  of people gathered about a little booth beyond the Erechtheum.    It was not until they had seen him swallow swords twice and eat fire  once, and the conjurer had begun to pack his things to go away that the  Twins thought at all about time. When at last they woke up to the fact  that the sun was setting behind the purple hills, and looked about them,  there were very few people left on the Acropolis, and their Father was  nowhere to be seen. The two children ran as fast as they could go to the  place where the Parthenon was building, but there was no one there. Even  the workmen had gone. Then they ran back and looked down the long incline  up which the procession had come in the morning, but Melas was not to be  seen. The Twins returned to the statue of Athena, but no one awaited them  there. The Gorgon's head looked down at them with its dreadful staring  eyes, and Daphne thought she saw one of the snaky locks move.    \"Oh, let's run,\" she cried.    \"Where?\" asked Dion.    \"I don't know,\" said Daphne. \"Anywhere away from here! Let's go back to  the Erechtheum. Perhaps Father will be there looking for us.\"    They went all round the old temple, which was partly in ruins, and when  they found no trace of their Father, sat down miserably upon the steps of  the great porch of the Maidens on the southern side. It was called the  Porch of the Maidens because, instead of columns of marble, statues of  beautiful maidens supported the roof. Daphne looked up at them.    \"They look strong, like Mother,\" she said. \"It doesn't seem quite so  lonesome here with them. Maybe we shall have to stay here all night.\"    \"Don't you think we could find Uncle Phaon's house by ourselves?\" asked  Dion.    \"Oh,\" cried Daphne, shuddering, \"never! We couldn't even by daylight, and  now it is almost dark.\"    \"Anyway,\" said Dion, \"we're safer being lost here than anywhere else in  Athens. It's where the Gods live. Maybe they'll take care of us.\"    \"We might sacrifice something on an altar,\" said Daphne, \"and pray, the  way Father does.\"    \"We haven't a thing to sacrifice,\" answered Dion. \"We haven't anything to  eat even for ourselves.\"    They were so tired and hungry and discouraged by this time that they  didn't say another word. They just sat still in the gathering darkness,  and wished with all their hearts that they had never come to Athens at  all.    They were startled by hearing footsteps above them on the porch. The  stone balustrade was so high, and the children were crouched so far below  it near the ground, that they could not be seen by people above unless  they should lean over the balustrade and look down. The twins snuggled  closer together in the darkness and kept very still. Suddenly they heard  voices above them; there were two men on the porch talking together in  low tones. One was the voice of Lampon the priest; the children both  recognized it at once.    \"Look over there,\" it was saying. \"Pericles is building new temples in  Athens, to the dishonor and neglect of the oldest and most sacred of all.  Pericles does not fear the Gods, even though they have raised him to  his proud position. He is a traitor to our holy office, and I hate him.\"    \"You speak strongly,\" said the other voice.    \"It isn't only that he neglects the old temples and refuses to restore  them, but he actually builds a new one before our eyes on this holy  hill,\" went on the voice of Lampon. \"It is not only an impiety in itself,  but an affront to you and your holy office. I myself saw his scorn and  indifference this very day. I was called to his house by his pious wife  to see a prodigy. A ram was brought from his country estate that had but  one horn,--a marvel, truly!\"    \"How did you read the portent?\" asked the other voice.    \"As favorable to him, of course,\" answered Lampon. \"What else could I do  with Pericles himself watching me, and with that old fox of an Anaxagoras  by his side?\"    \"The Gods punish people who do not believe in them,\" said the other  voice, \"and we are the priests of the Gods. Should we not do all we can  to bring such wicked men to justice?\"    \"Yes, but,\" said Lampon, \"the people adore Pericles. They would not  believe evil of him. We must act carefully, lest we ourselves receive the  blow that we aim at him.\"    \"I have found out that he went to the boat-race at the Piraeus this  afternoon,\" answered the voice of the other priest, \"and after that he  goes to a banquet at the house of the rich Hipponicus, and will return  late to his home. If we could waylay him and make him angry, he might say  something blasphemous to us, not knowing we were priests. He might even  offer us violence! Disrespect to a priest is disrespect to the Gods, and  no man in Athens, not even Pericles, can insult the representatives of  the Gods and live.\"    \"A good idea, truly, and worthy of the priest of Erechtheus,\" said the  voice of Lampon.    \"We will doff our priestly robes and appear as men of the people.  Pericles must not suspect who we are, or of course he will be too clever  to allow himself to speak the insults we know only too well he would like  to offer us as priests. We can each be witness for the other; and he  cannot deny our report.\"    If Daphne had not sneezed just at this moment, everything that happened  after that would almost surely have been "]]]
