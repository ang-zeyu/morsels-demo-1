They entered the room so quietly that Nerle never knew they were there  until he turned and found the hundred gray ones standing close together  in the center of the hall.  Then Prince Marvel came to Nerle's side and  whispered something in his ear.    \"Will you obey my orders?\" they heard the king ask.  And the Gray Men,  with their eyes fixed upon their master, nodded all their hundred heads  and put their hands upon the dangerous three-tined forks that were  stuck in every one of the hundred belts.    Prince Marvel handed one end of a coiled rope to Nerle, and then they  both sprang forward and ran around the spot where the hundred Gray Men  stood huddled together.  Then they were pulled closer together than  before--closer, and still closer--for the prince and Nerle had  surrounded them with the rope and were tying the two ends together in a  tight knot.  The rope cut into the waists of those on the outside, and  they pressed inward against their fellows until there was scarcely  space to stick a knife-blade between any two of them.  When the prince  had tied the rope firmly King Terribus, who had been looking on amazed,  saw that his hundred Gray Men were fastened together like a bundle of  kindling-wood, and were unable to stir hand or foot.    And, while he still gazed open-mouthed at the strange sight, Prince  Marvel tilted the bundle of men up on its edge and rolled it out of the  door.  It went rolling swiftly through the courtyard and bounded down  the castle steps, where the rope broke and the men fell sprawling in  all directions on the marble walk.    King Terribus sighed, for such treatment of his Gray Men, whom he  dearly loved, made him very unhappy.    But more than ever was he resolved to kill these impudent strangers,  who, in the very heart of his kingdom where thousands bowed to his  will, dared openly defy his power.  So, after a moment's thought,  Terribus beckoned to a dwarf who, robed in gay and glittering apparel,  stood near his throne.    \"Summon the royal Dart Slingers!\" he said, with a scowl.    The little man bowed and hastened away, to return presently with twenty  curiously crooked dwarfs, each armed with a sling and a quiver full of  slender, sharp-pointed darts.    \"Slay me these strangers!\" exclaimed the king, in his gruffest voice.    Now Nerle, when he beheld these terrible Dart Slingers, of whom he had  heard many tales in his boyhood, began to shiver and shake with fright,  so that his teeth rattled one upon another.  And he reflected: \"Soon  shall I be content, for these darts will doubtless pierce every part of  my body.\"    The dwarfs formed a line at one side of the gloomy throne-room, and  Prince Marvel, who had been earnestly regarding them, caught Nerle by  the arm and led him to the opposite wall.    \"Stand close behind me and you will be safe,\" he whispered to his  esquire.    Then each dwarf fixed a dart in his sling, and at a word from their  chief they all drew back their arms and launched a shower of the sharp  missiles at the strangers.    Swift and true they sped, each dart intended to pierce the body of the  youthful knight who stood so calm before them.  Prince Marvel had  raised his right arm, and in his hand was a small leather sack, with a  wide mouth.  As the darts flew near him a strange thing happened: they  each and all swerved from their true course and fell rattling into the  leathern sack, to the wonder of the royal slingers and the dismay of  King Terribus himself.    \"Again!\" screamed the king, his usually mild voice hoarse with anger.    So again the dwarfs cast their darts, and again the leathern sack  caught them every one.  Another flight followed, and yet another, till  the magic sack was packed full of the darts and not a dwarf had one  remaining in his quiver.    Amid the awed silence of the beholders of this feat the merry laughter  of Prince Marvel rang loud and clear; for the sight of the puzzled and  terrified faces about him was very comical.  Plucking a dart from the  sack he raised his arm and cried:    \"Now it is my turn.  You shall have back your darts!\"    \"Hold!\" shouted the king, in great fear.  \"Do not, I beg you, slay my  faithful servants.\"  And with a wave of his hand he dismissed the  dwarfs, who were glad to rush from the room and escape.    Nerle wiped the tears from his eyes, for he was sorely disappointed at  having again escaped all pain and discomfort; but Prince Marvel seated  himself quietly upon a stool and looked at the scowling face of King  Terribus with real amusement.    The monarch of Spor had never before been so foiled and scorned by any  living creature.  Defeated and humbled before his own people, he bowed  his crimson head on his hands and sullenly regarded his foe with his  top eye.  Then it was that the idea came to him that no ordinary mortal  could have thwarted him so easily, and he began to fear he was  dealing--perhaps unawares--with some great magician or sorcerer.  That  a fairy should have assumed a mortal form he never once considered, for  such a thing was until then unheard of in the Enchanted Island of Yew.  But with the knowledge that he had met his master, whoever he might  prove to be, and that further attempts upon the stranger's life might  lead to his own undoing, King Terribus decided to adopt a new line of  conduct, hoping to accomplish by stratagem what he could not do by  force.  To be sure, there remained his regiment of Giants, the pride of  his kingdom; but Terribus dreaded to meet with another defeat; and he  was not at all sure, after what had happened, that the giants would  succeed in conquering or destroying the strangers.    \"After all,\" he thought, \"my only object in killing them was to prevent  their carrying news of my monstrous appearance to the outside world; so  if I can but manage to keep them forever in my kingdom it will answer  my purpose equally well.\"    As the result of this thought he presently raised his head and spoke to  Prince Marvel in a quiet and even cheerful voice.    \"Enough of these rude and boisterous games,\" said he, with a smile that  showed his white teeth in a repulsive manner.  \"They may have seemed to  my people an ill welcome to my good friend, Prince Marvel; yet they  were only designed to show the powers of the mighty magician who has  become my guest.  Nay, do not deny it, Prince; from the first I guessed  your secret, and to prove myself right I called my servants to oppose  you, being sure they could not do you an injury.  But no more of such  fooling,--and pray forgive my merry game at your expense.  Henceforth  we shall be friends, and you are heartily welcome to the best my  kingdom affords.\"    With this speech Terribus stepped down from his throne and approached  Prince Marvel with outstretched hand.  The prince was not at all  deceived, but he was pleased to see how cunningly the king excused his  attempts to kill him.  So he laughed and touched the hand Terribus  extended, for this fairy prince seemed to have no anger against any  mortal who ventured to oppose him.    The strangers were now conducted, with every mark of respect, to a  beautiful suite of apartments in the castle, wherein were soft beds  with velvet spreads, marble baths with perfumed waters, and a variety  of silken and brocaded costumes from which they might select a change  of raiment.    No sooner had they bathed and adorned themselves fittingly than they  were summoned to the king's banquet hall, being escorted thither by  twelve young maidens bearing torches with lavender-colored flames.    The night had fallen upon the mountains outside, but the great banquet  hall was brilliant with the glow of a thousand candles, and seated at  the head of the long table was King Terribus.    Yet here, as in the throne-room, the ruler of Spor was dressed in  simplest garments, and his seat was a rough block of stone.  All about  him were lords and ladies in gorgeous array; the walls were hung with  rare embroideries; the table was weighted with gold platters and richly  carved goblets filled with sweet nectars.  But the king himself, with  his horrid, ugly head, was like a great blot on a fair parchment, and  even Prince Marvel could not repress a shudder as he gazed upon him.    Terribus placed his guest upon his right hand and loaded him with  honors.  Nerle stood behind the prince's chair and served him  faithfully, as an esquire should.  But the other servants treated Nerle  with much deference, noting in him an air of breeding that marked him  the unusual servant of an unusual master.    Indeed, most curious were the looks cast on these marvelous men who had  calmly walked into the castle of mighty Terribus and successfully  defied his anger; for in spite of his youthful appearance and smiling  face every attendant at the banquet feared Prince Marvel even more than  they feared their own fierce king.        11.  The Cunning of King Terribus    The days that followed were pleasant ones for Prince Marvel and Nerle,  who were treated as honored guests by both the king and his courtiers.  But the prince seemed to be the favorite, for at all games of skill and  trials at arms he was invariably the victor, while in the evenings,  when the grand ball-room was lighted up and the musicians played sweet  music, none was so graceful in the dance as the fairy prince.    Nerle soon tired of the games and dancing, for he had been accustomed  to them at his father's castle; and moreover he was shy in the society  of ladies; so before many weeks had passed he began to mope and show a  discontented face.    One day the prince noticed his esquire's dismal expression of  countenance, and asked the cause of it.    \"Why,\" said Nerle, \"here I have left my home to seek worries and  troubles, and have found but the same humdrum life that existed at my  father's castle.  Here our days are made smooth"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5180"],[0,"Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) Ruling (#9)"],[1,"librarians would  have the discretion to allow a patron to have full Internet  access on a staff computer upon request, but none claimed that  allowing such access was mandatory, and patron access is  supervised in every instance.  None of these libraries makes  differential unblocking decisions based on the patrons' age.  Unblocking decisions are usually made identically for adults and  minors.  Unblocking decisions even for adults are usually based  on suitability of the Web site for minors.      It is apparent that many patrons are reluctant or unwilling  to ask librarians to unblock Web pages or sites that contain only  materials that might be deemed personal or embarrassing, even if  they are not sexually explicit or pornographic.  We credit the  testimony of Emmalyn Rood, discussed above, that she would have  been unwilling as a young teen to ask a librarian to disable  filtering software so that she could view materials concerning  gay and lesbian issues.  We also credit the testimony of Mark  Brown, who stated that he would have been too embarrassed to ask  a librarian to disable filtering software if it had impeded his  ability to research treatments and cosmetic surgery options for  his mother when she was diagnosed with breast cancer.  The pattern of patron requests to unblock specific URLs in  the various libraries involved in this case also confirms our  finding that patrons are largely unwilling to make unblocking  requests unless they are permitted to do so anonymously.  For  example, the Fulton County Library receives only about 6  unblocking requests each year, the Greenville Public Library has  received only 28 unblocking requests since August 21, 2000, and  the Westerville, Ohio Library has received fewer than 10  unblocking requests since 1999.  In light of the fact that a  substantial amount of overblocking occurs in these very  libraries, see infra Subsection II.E.4, we find that the lack of  unblocking requests in these libraries does not reflect the  effectiveness of the filters, but rather reflects patrons'  reluctance to ask librarians to unblock sites.  5.        Internet Filtering Technology  1.        What Is Filtering Software, Who Makes It, and  What Does It Do?      Commercially available products that can be configured to  block or filter access to certain material on the Internet are  among the \"technology protection measures\" that may be used to  attempt to comply with CIPA.  There are numerous filtering  software products available commercially.  Three network-based  filtering products  SurfControl's Cyber Patrol, N2H2's  Bess/i2100, and Secure Computing's SmartFilter  currently have  the lion's share of the public library market.  The parties in  this case deposed representatives from these three companies.  Websense, another network-based blocking product, is also  currently used in the public library market, and was discussed at  trial.  Filtering software may be installed either on an individual  computer or on a computer network.  Network-based filtering  software products are designed for use on a network of computers  and funnel requests for Internet content through a centralized  network device.   Of the various commercially available blocking  products, network-based products are the ones generally marketed  to institutions, such as public libraries, that provide Internet  access through multiple terminals.  Filtering programs function in a fairly simple way.  When an  Internet user requests access to a certain Web site or page,  either by entering a domain name or IP address into a Web  browser, or by clicking on a link, the filtering software checks  that domain name or IP address against a previously compiled  \"control list\" that may contain up to hundreds of thousands of  URLs.  The three companies deposed in this case have control  lists containing between 200,000 and 600,000 URLs.  These lists  determine which URLs will be blocked.      Filtering software companies divide their control lists into  multiple categories for which they have created unique  definitions.  SurfControl uses 40 such categories, N2H2 uses 35  categories (and seven \"exception\" categories), Websense uses 30  categories, and Secure Computing uses 30 categories.  Filtering  software customers choose which categories of URLs they wish to  enable.  A user \"enables\" a category in a filtering program by  configuring the program to block all of the Web pages listed in  that category.  The following is a list of the categories offered by each of  these four filtering programs.  SurfControl's Cyber Patrol offers  the following categories:  Adult/Sexually Explicit;  Advertisements; Arts & Entertainment; Chat; Computing & Internet;  Criminal Skills; Drugs, Alcohol & Tobacco; Education; Finance &  Investment; Food & Drink; Gambling; Games; Glamour & Intimate  Apparel; Government & Politics; Hacking; Hate Speech; Health &  Medicine; Hobbies & Recreation; Hosting Sites; Job Search &  Career Development; Kids' Sites; Lifestyle & Culture; Motor  Vehicles; News; Personals & Dating; Photo Searches; Real Estate;  Reference; Religion; Remote Proxies; Sex Education; Search  Engines; Shopping; Sports; Streaming Media; Travel; Usenet News;  Violence; Weapons; and Web-based Email.      N2H2 offers the following categories:  Adults Only; Alcohol;  Auction; Chat; Drugs; Electronic Commerce; Employment Search;  Free Mail; Free Pages; Gambling; Games; Hate/Discrimination;  Illegal; Jokes; Lingerie; Message/Bulletin Boards;  Murder/Suicide; News; Nudity; Personal Information; Personals;  Pornography; Profanity; Recreation/Entertainment; School Cheating  Information; Search Engines; Search Terms; Sex; Sports; Stocks;  Swimsuits; Tasteless/Gross; Tobacco; Violence; and Weapons. The  \"Nudity\" category purports to block only \"non-pornographic\"  images.  The \"Sex\" category is intended to block only those  depictions of sexual activity that are not intended to arouse.  The \"Tasteless/Gross\" category includes contents such as  \"tasteless humor\" and \"graphic medical or accident scene photos.\"   Additionally, N2H2 offers seven \"exception categories.\"  These  exception categories include Education, Filtered Search Engine,  For Kids, History, Medical, Moderated, and Text/Spoken Only.  When an exception category is enabled, access to any Web site or  page via a URL associated with both a category and an exception,  for example, both \"Sex\" and \"Education,\" will be allowed, even if  the customer has enabled the product to otherwise block the  category \"Sex.\"  As of November 15, 2001, of those Web sites  categorized by N2H2 as \"Sex,\" 3.6% were also categorized as  \"Education,\" 2.9% as \"Medical,\" and 1.6% as \"History.\"      Websense offers the following categories: Abortion Advocacy;  Advocacy Groups; Adult Material; Business & Economy; Drugs;  Education; Entertainment; Gambling; Games; Government; Health;  Illegal/Questionable; Information Technology; Internet  Communication; Job Search; Militancy/Extremist; News & Media;  Productivity Management; Bandwidth Management; Racism/Hate;  Religion; Shopping; Society & Lifestyle; Special Events; Sports;  Tasteless; Travel; Vehicles; Violence; and Weapons.  The \"Adult\"  category includes \"full or partial nudity of individuals,\" as  well as sites offering \"light adult humor and literature\" and  \"[s]exually explicit language.\"  The \"Sexuality/Pornography\"  category includes, inter alia, \"hard-core adult humor and  literature\" and \"[s]exually explicit language.\"  The \"Tasteless\"  category includes \"hard-to-stomach sites, including offensive,  worthless or useless sites, grotesque or lurid depictions of  bodily harm.\"  The \"Hacking\" category blocks \"sites providing  information on or promoting illegal or questionable access to or  use of communications equipment and/or software.\"  SmartFilter offers the following categories:  Anonymizers/Translators; Art & Culture; Chat; Criminal Skills;  Cults/Occult; Dating; Drugs; Entertainment;  Extreme/Obscene/Violence; Gambling; Games; General News; Hate  Speech; Humor; Investing; Job Search; Lifestyle; Mature; MP3  Sites; Nudity; On-line Sales; Personal Pages; Politics, Opinion &  Religion; Portal Sites; Self-Help/Health; Sex; Sports; Travel;  Usenet News; and Webmail.  Most importantly, no category definition used by filtering  software companies is identical to CIPA's definitions of visual  depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to  minors.  And category definitions and categorization decisions  are made without reference to local community standards.  Moreover, there is no judicial involvement in the creation of  filtering software companies' category definitions and no  judicial determination is made before these companies categorize  a Web page or site.      Each filtering software company associates each URL in its  control list with a \"tag\" or other identifier that indicates the  company's evaluation of whether the content or features of the  Web site or page accessed via that URL meets one or more of its  category definitions.  If a user attempts to access a Web site or  page that is blocked by the filter, the user is immediately  presented with a screen that indicates that a block has occurred  as a result of the operation of the filtering software.  These  \"denial screens\" appear only at the point that a user attempts to  access a site or page in an enabled category.  All four of the filtering programs on which evidence was  presented allow users to customize the category lists that exist  on their own PCs or servers by adding or removing specific URLs.   For example, if a public librarian charged with administering a  library's Internet terminals comes across a Web site that he or  she finds objectionable that is not blocked by the filtering  program that his or her library is using, then the librarian may  add that URL to a category list that exists only on the library's  network, and it would thereafter be"]]]
