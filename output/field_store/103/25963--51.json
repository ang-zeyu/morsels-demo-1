[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8770"],[0,"Milton (#9)"],[1,"greatly admired, so now (1642) much less.\" In the  letter to Hartlib he denounces with equal fierceness the schools and  \"the many mistakes which have made learning generally so unpleasing  and so unsuccessful.\" The alumni of the universities carry away with  them a hatred and contempt for learning, and sink into \"ignorantly  zealous\" clergymen, or mercenary lawyers, while the men of fortune  betake themselves to feasts and jollity. These last, Milton thinks,  are the best of the three classes.    All these moral shipwrecks are the consequence, according to Milton,  of bad education. It is in our power to avert them by a reform of  schools. But the measures of reform, when produced, are ludicrously  incommensurable with the evils to be remedied. I do not trouble the  reader with the proposals; they are a form of the well-known mistake  of regarding education as merely the communication of useful  knowledge. The doctrine as propounded in the _Tractate_ is complicated  by the further difficulty, that the knowledge is to be gathered out of  Greek and Latin books. This doctrine is advocated by Milton with the  ardour of his own lofty enthusiasm. In virtue of the grandeur of zeal  which inspires them, these pages, which are in substance nothing more  than the now familiar omniscient examiner's programme, retain a place  as one of our classics. The fine definition of education here given  has never been improved upon: \"I call a complete and generous  education that which fits a man to perform justly, skilfully, and  magnanimously, all the offices, both private and public, of peace and  war.\" This is the true Milton. When he offers, in another page, as an  equivalent definition of the true end of learning, \"to repair the ruin  of our first parents by regaining to know God aright,\" we have the  theological Milton, and what he took on from the current language of  his age.    Milton saw strongly, as many have done before and since, one weak  point in the practice of schools, namely, the small result of much  time. He fell into the natural error of the inexperienced teacher,  that of supposing that the remedy was the ingestion of much and  diversified intelligible matter. It requires much observation of  young minds to discover that the rapid inculcation of unassimilated  information stupefies the faculties instead of training them. Is it  fanciful to think that in Edward Phillips, who was always employing  his superficial pen upon topics with which he snatched a fugitive  acquaintance, we have a concrete example of the natural result of the  Miltonic system of instruction?            CHAPTER V.    MARRIAGE, AND PAMPHLETS ON DIVORCE      We have seen that Milton turned back from his unaccomplished tour  because he \"deemed it disgraceful to be idling away his time abroad  for his own gratification, while his countrymen were contending for  their liberty.\" From these words biographers have inferred that he  hurried home with the view of taking service in the Parliamentarian  army. This interpretation of his words seems to receive confirmation  from what Phillips thinks he had heard,--\"I am much mistaken if  there were not about this time a design in agitation of making him  Adjutant-General in Sir William Waller's army.\" Phillips very likely  thought that a recruit could enlist as an Adjutant-General, but  it does not appear from Milton's own words that he himself ever  contemplated service in the field. The words \"contending for liberty\"  (de libertate dimicarent) could not, as said of the winter 1638-39,  mean anything more than the strife of party. And when war did break  out, it must have been obvious to Milton that he could serve the cause  better as a scholar than as a soldier.    That he never took service in the army is certain. If there was a  time when he should have been found in the ranks, it was on the 12th  November, 1642, when every able-bodied citizen turned out to oppose  the march of the king, who had advanced to Brentford. But we have the  evidence of the sonnet--        Captain, or Colonel, or Knight in arms,    that Milton, on this occasion, stayed at home. He had, as he announced  in February, 1642, \"taken labour and intent study\" to be his portion  in this life. He did not contemplate enlisting his pen in the service  of the Parliament, but the exaltation of his country's glory by the  composition of some monument of the English language, as Dante or  Tasso had done for Italian. But a project ambitious as this lay too  far off to be put in execution as soon as thought of. The ultimate  purpose had to give place to the immediate. One of these interludes,  originating in Milton's personal relations, was his series of tracts  on divorce.    In the early part of the summer of 1643, Milton took a sudden journey  into the country, \"nobody about him certainly knowing the reason, or  that it was any more than a journey of recreation.\" He was absent  about a month, and when he returned he brought back a wife with him.  Nor was the bride alone. She was attended \"by some few of her nearest  relations,\" and there was feasting and celebration of the nuptials, in  the house in Aldersgate-street.    The bride's name was Mary, eldest daughter of Richard Powell, Esq., of  Forest Hill, J.P. for the county of Oxford. Forest Hill is a village  and parish about five miles from Oxford on the Thame road, where Mr.  Powell had a house and a small estate of some 300 l. a year, value of  that day. Forest Hill was within the ancient royal forest of Shotover,  of which Mr. Powell was lessee. The reader will remember that the  poet's father was born at Stanton St. John, the adjoining parish  to Forest Hill, and that Richard Milton, the grandfather, had been  under-ranger of the royal forest. There had been many transactions  between the Milton and the Powell families as far back as 1627. In  paying a visit to that neighbourhood, Milton was both returning to the  district which had been the home of all the Miltons, and renewing an  old acquaintance with the Powell family. Mr. Powell, though in receipt  of a fair income for a country gentleman--300 l. a year of that day may  be roughly valued at 1000 l. of our day--and his wife had brought him  3000 l., could not live within his means. His children were numerous,  and, belonging as he did to the cavalier party, his house was  conducted with the careless hospitality of a royalist gentleman.  Twenty years before he had begun borrowing, and among other  persons had had recourse to the prosperous and saving scrivener of  Bread-street. He was already mortgaged to the Miltons, father and  sons, more deeply than his estate had any prospect of paying, which  was perhaps the reason why he found no difficulty in promising a  portion of 1000 l. with his daughter. Milton, with a poet's want  of caution, or indifference to money, and with a lofty masculine  disregard of the temper and character of the girl he asked to share  his life, came home with his bride in triumph, and held feasting in  celebration of his hasty and ill-considered choice. It was a beginning  of sorrows to him. Hitherto, up to his thirty-fifth year, independent  master of leisure and the delights of literature, his years had passed  without a check or a shadow. From this day forward domestic misery,  the importunities of business, the clamour of controversy, crowned by  the crushing calamity of blindness, were to be his portion for more  than thirty years. Singular among poets in the serene fortune of the  first half of life, in the second half his piteous fate was to rank in  wretchedness with that of his masters, Dante or Tasso.    The biographer, acquainted with the event, has no difficulty in  predicting it, and in saying at this point in his story, that Milton  might have known better than, with his puritanical connections, to  have taken to wife a daughter of a cavalier house, to have brought her  from a roystering home, frequented by the dissolute officers of the  Oxford garrison, to the spare diet and philosophical retirement of a  recluse student, and to have looked for sympathy and response for his  speculations from an uneducated and frivolous girl. Love has blinded,  and will continue to blind, the wisest men to calculations as easy and  as certain as these. And Milton, in whose soul Puritan austerity was  as yet only contending with the more genial currents of humanity, had  a far greater than average susceptibility to the charm of woman. Even  at the later date of _Paradise Lost_, voluptuous thoughts, as Mr.  Hallam has observed, are not uncongenial to him. And at an earlier  age his poems, candidly pure from the lascivious inuendoes of his  contemporaries, have preserved the record of the rapid impression of  the momentary passage of beauty upon his susceptible mind. Once, at  twenty, he was set all on flame by the casual meeting, in one of his  walks in the suburbs of London, with a damsel whom he never saw again.  Again, sonnets III. to V. tell how he fell before the new type of  foreign beauty which crossed his path at Bologna. A similar surprise  of his fancy at the expense of his judgment seems to have happened on  the present occasion of his visit to Shotover. There is no evidence  that Mary Powell was handsome, and we may be sure that it would  have been mentioned if she had been. But she had youth, and country  freshness; her \"unliveliness and natural sloth unfit for conversation\"  passed as \"the bashful muteness of a virgin;\" and if a doubt intruded  that he was being too hasty, Milton may have thought that a girl of  seventeen could be moulded at pleasure.    He was too soon undeceived. His dream of married happiness barely  lasted out the honeymoon. He found that he had mated himself to a  clod of earth, who not only was not now, but had not the capacity  of becoming, a helpmeet for him.

We have a splendor for which the world has no  employment. It will be wasted. And such wastage is not fair.\"    \"But presently you will be so and so,\" says she: and fondly predicts  all manner of noble exploits which, as Jurgen remembered, had once  seemed very plausible to him also. Now he had clearer knowledge as  to the capacities of the boy of whom he had thought so well.    \"No, Heart's Desire: no, I shall be quite otherwise.\"    \"--and to think how proud I shall be of you! 'But then I always knew  it', I shall tell everybody, very condescendingly--\"    \"No, Heart's Desire: for you will not think of me at all.\"    \"Ah, sweetheart! and can you really believe that I shall ever care a  snap of my fingers for anybody but you?\"    Then Jurgen laughed a little; for Heitman Michael came now across  the lonely terrace, in search of Madame Dorothy: and Jurgen foreknew  this was the man to whom within two months of this evening Dorothy  was to give her love and all the beauty that was hers, and with whom  she was to share the ruinous years which lay ahead.    But the girl did not know this, and Dorothy gave a little shrugging  gesture. \"I have promised to dance with him, and so I must. But the  old fellow is a great plague.\"    For Heitman Michael was nearing thirty, and this to Dorothy and  Jurgen was an age that bordered upon senility.    \"Now, by heaven,\" said Jurgen, \"wherever Heitman Michael does his  next dancing it will not be hereabouts.\"    Jurgen had decided what he must do.    And then Heitman Michael saluted them civilly. \"But I fear I must  rob you of this fair lady, Master Jurgen,\" says he.    Jurgen remembered that the man had said precisely this a score of  years ago; and that Jurgen had mumbled polite regrets, and had stood  aside while Heitman Michael bore off Dorothy to dance with him. And  this dance had been the beginning of intimacy between Heitman  Michael and Dorothy.    \"Heitman,\" says Jurgen, \"the bereavement which you threaten is very  happily spared me, since, as it happens, the next dance is to be  mine.\"    \"We can but leave it to the lady,\" says Heitman Michael, laughing.    \"Not I,\" says Jurgen. \"For I know too well what would come of that.  I intend to leave my destiny to no one.\"    \"Your conduct, Master Jurgen, is somewhat strange,\" observed Heitman  Michael.    \"Ah, but I will show you a thing yet stranger. For, look you, there  seem to be three of us here on this terrace. Yet I can assure you  there are four.\"    \"Read me the riddle, my boy, and have done.\"    \"The fourth of us, Heitman, is a goddess that wears a speckled  garment and has black wings. She can boast of no temples, and no  priests cry to her anywhere, because she is the only deity whom no  prayers can move or any sacrifices placate. I allude, sir, to the  eldest daughter of Nox and Erebus.\"    \"You speak of death, I take it.\"    \"Your apprehension, Heitman, is nimble. Even so, it is not quick  enough, I fear, to forerun the whims of goddesses. Indeed, what  person could have foreseen that this implacable lady would have  taken such a strong fancy for your company.\"    \"Ah, my young bantam,\" replies Heitman Michael, \"it is quite true  that she and I are acquainted. I may even boast of having despatched  one or two stout warriors to serve her underground. Now, as I divine  your meaning, you plan that I should decrease her obligation by  sending her a whippersnapper.\"    \"My notion, Heitman, is that since this dark goddess is about to  leave us, she should not, in common gallantry, be permitted to go  hence unaccompanied. I propose, therefore, that we forthwith decide  who is to be her escort.\"    Now Heitman Michael had drawn his sword. \"You are insane. But you  extend an invitation which I have never yet refused.\"    \"Heitman,\" cries Jurgen, in honest gratitude and admiration, \"I bear  you no ill-will. But it is highly necessary you die to-night, in  order that my soul may not perish too many years before my body.\"    With that he too whipped out his sword.    So they fought. Now Jurgen was a very acceptable swordsman, but from  the start he found in Heitman Michael his master. Jurgen had never  reckoned upon that, and he considered it annoying. If Heitman  Michael perforated Jurgen the future would be altered, certainly,  but not quite as Jurgen had decided it ought to be remodeled. So  this unlooked-for complication seemed preposterous, and Jurgen began  to be irritated by the suspicion that he was getting himself killed  for nothing at all.    Meanwhile his unruffled tall antagonist seemed but to play with  Jurgen, so that Jurgen was steadily forced back toward the  balustrade. And presently Jurgen's sword was twisted from his hand,  and sent flashing over the balustrade, into the public highway.    \"So now, Master Jurgen,\" says Heitman Michael, \"that is the end of  your nonsense. Why, no, there is not any occasion to posture like a  statue. I do not intend to kill you. Why the devil's name, should I?  To do so would only get me an ill name with your parents: and  besides it is infinitely more pleasant to dance with this lady, just  as I first intended.\" And he turned gaily toward Madame Dorothy.    But Jurgen found this outcome of affairs insufferable. This man was  stronger than he, this man was of the sort that takes and uses  gallantly all the world's prizes which mere poets can but  respectfully admire. All was to do again: Heitman Michael, in his  own hateful phrase, would act just as he had first intended, and  Jurgen would be brushed aside by the man's brute strength. This man  would take away Dorothy, and leave the life of Jurgen to become a  business which Jurgen remembered with distaste. It was unfair.    So Jurgen snatched out his dagger, and drove it deep into the  undefended back of Heitman Michael. Three times young Jurgen stabbed  and hacked the burly soldier, just underneath the left ribs. Even in  his fury Jurgen remembered to strike on the left side.    It was all very quickly done. Heitman Michael's arms jerked upward,  and in the moonlight his fingers spread and clutched. He made  curious gurgling noises. Then the strength went from his knees, so  that he toppled backward. His head fell upon Jurgen's shoulder,  resting there for an instant fraternally; and as Jurgen shuddered  away from the abhorred contact, the body of Heitman Michael  collapsed. Now he lay staring upward, dead at the feet of his  murderer. He was horrible looking, but he was quite dead.    \"What will become of you?\" Dorothy whispered, after a while. \"Oh,  Jurgen, it was foully done, that which you did was infamous! What  will become of you, my dear?\"    \"I will take my doom,\" says Jurgen, \"and without whimpering, so that  I get justice. But I shall certainly insist upon justice.\" Then  Jurgen raised his face to the bright heavens. \"The man was stronger  than I and wanted what I wanted. So I have compromised with  necessity, in the only way I could make sure of getting that which  was requisite to me. I cry for justice to the power that gave him  strength and gave me weakness, and gave to each of us his desires.  That which I have done, I have done. Now judge!\"    Then Jurgen tugged and shoved the heavy body of Heitman Michael,  until it lay well out of sight, under the bench upon which Jurgen  and Dorothy had been sitting. \"Rest there, brave sir, until they  find you. Come to me now, my Heart's Desire. Good, that is  excellent. Here I sit with my true love, upon the body of my enemy.  Justice is satisfied, and all is quite as it should be. For you must  understand that I have fallen heir to a fine steed, whose bridle is  marked with a coronet,--prophetically, I take it,--and upon this  steed you will ride pillion with me to Lisuarte. There we will find  a priest to marry us. We will go together into Gatinais. Meanwhile,  there is a bit of neglected business to be attended to.\" And he drew  the girl close to him.    For Jurgen was afraid of nothing now. And Jurgen thought:    \"Oh, that I could detain the moment! that I could make some fitting  verses to preserve this moment in my own memory! Could I but get  into words the odor and the thick softness of this girl's hair as my  hands, that are a-quiver in every nerve of them, caress her hair;  and get into enduring words the glitter and the cloudy shadowings of  her hair in this be-drenching moonlight! For I shall forget all this  beauty, or at best I shall remember this moment very dimly.\"    \"You have done very wrong--\" says Dorothy.    Says Jurgen, to himself: \"Already the moment passes this miserably  happy moment wherein once more life shudders and stands heart-stricken  at the height of bliss! it passes, and I know even as I lift this girl's  soft face to mine, and mark what faith and submissiveness and expectancy  is in her face, that whatever the future holds for us, and whatever of  happiness we two may know hereafter, we shall find no instant happier  than this, which passes from us irretrievably while I am thinking about  it, poor fool, in place of rising to the issue.\"    \"--And heaven only knows what will become of you Jurgen--\"    Says Jurgen, still to himself: \"Yes, something must remain to me of  all this rapture, though it be only guilt and sorrow: something I  mean to wrest from this high moment which was once wasted  fruitlessly. Now I am wiser: for I know there is not any memory with  less satisfaction in it than the memory of some temptation we  resisted. So I will not waste the one real passion I have known, nor  leave unfed the one desire which ever caused me for a heart-beat to  forget to think about Jurgen's welfare. And thus, whatever happens,  I shall not always regret that I did not avail myself of this girl's  love before it was taken from me.\"    So Jurgen "]]]
