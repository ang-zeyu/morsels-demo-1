Then the pulp may be eaten from the orange  with a spoon.    [Illustration: FIG. 12]    If an orange is to be eaten in sections, the skin may be cut from the  stem to the blossom end about six times and then loosened from the one  end and turned in toward the orange in the manner shown in the central  figure of the group. It will then be easy to remove the skin.    [Illustration: FIG. 13]    Sometimes it is desired to serve sliced oranges, as shown at the right.  To prepare oranges in this way, remove the skin from the orange, cut it  in halves lengthwise, and then slice it in thin slices crosswise.  Arrange the slices on a plate and serve as desired.    87. When oranges are to be used for salads, or for any purpose in which  merely the pulp is desired, as, for instance, orange custard, all the  skin between the sections must be removed, as it makes any warm mixture  bitter. To secure the pulp without any of the skin, first peel the  orange, as shown in Fig. 12, in the same way an apple is peeled,  beginning at one end and peeling around and around deeply enough to  remove with the skin all the white pithy material under it. If the knife  is a sharp one and the peeling is carefully done, there will be little  waste of the pulp. When the orange is entirely peeled, cut each section  from the skin by passing the knife as closely as possible between the  pulp and the skin, as shown in Fig. 13. The sections thus obtained may  be used whole or cut into pieces of any desired size.      MISCELLANEOUS CITRUS FRUITS    88. In addition to grapefruit, lemons, and oranges, the three principal  varieties of citrus fruits, this group also includes kumquats, limes,  mandarins, and tangerines. These fruits are not of so much importance in  the diet as the other varieties, but when they are used as foods they  have a food value about equal to that of apples the same in size. They  are not in such common use as the citrus fruits already discussed, but  it is well for every housewife to know what they are and to what use  they can be put.    89. KUMQUATS are an acid fruit resembling oranges in color but being  about the size and shape of small plums. They are used principally for  the making of marmalades and jams, and in this use both the skin and the  pulp are included.    90. LIMES look like small lemons. They are very sour and do not contain  sugar in any quantity. They are valued chiefly for their juice, which is  utilized in the making of drinks, confections, etc.    91. MANDARINS and TANGERINES are really varieties of oranges and are  used in much the same way. They have a very sweet flavor. Their skin  does not cling so closely as the skin of oranges. For this reason they  are known as _glove oranges_ and are very easily peeled.           *       *       *       *       *    TROPICAL FRUITS    VARIETIES    92. Besides the citrus fruits, which may also be regarded as tropical  fruits because they grow in tropical regions, there are a number of  other fruits that may be conveniently grouped under the heading Tropical  Fruits. The best known of these are bananas and pineapples, but numerous  others, such as avocados, guavas, nectarines, pomegranates, tamarinds,  and mangoes, are also raised in the tropical countries and should be  included in this class. The majority of these fruits stand shipment  well, but if they are to be shipped to far distant places they must be  picked before they become too ripe and must be packed well. As bananas  and pineapples are used more extensively than the other tropical fruits,  they are discussed here in greater detail; however, enough information  is given about the others to enable the housewife to become familiar  with them.      BANANAS    93. BANANAS are a tropical fruit that have become very popular with the  people in the North. As they are usually picked and shipped green and  then ripened by a process of heating when they are ready to be put on  the market, it is possible to obtain them in a very good condition. It  should be remembered, however, that they are not ripe enough to eat  until all the green color has left the skin. The stem of the bunch may  be green, but the bananas themselves should be perfectly yellow. Black  spots, which are sometimes found on the skins, indicate overripeness or  bruises. When the spots come from overripeness, however, they do not  injure the quality of the fruit, unless there are a great many of them;  in fact, many persons consider that bananas are better when the skins  are black than at any other time.    94. Just under the skin of the banana is some pithy material that clings  to the outside of the fruit and that has a pungent, disagreeable taste.  This objectionable taste may be done away with by scraping the surface  of the banana slightly, as shown in Fig. 14, after the skin is removed.    The strong, typical flavor that characterizes bananas is due to the  volatile oil they contain. It is this oil that causes bananas to  disagree with some persons. The common yellow variety has a milder  flavor than red bananas and certain other kinds and, consequently, is  more popular. If the oil of bananas does not prove irritating, much use  should be made of this fruit, because its food value is high, being  about double that of apples and oranges.    [Illustration: FIG. 14]    95. Bananas are eaten raw more often than in any other way, but many  persons find cooked bananas very agreeable. Then, too, it is sometimes  claimed that cooked bananas are more digestible than raw ones because of  the starch that bananas contain. However, this argument may be  discounted, for a well-ripened banana contains such a small quantity of  starch that no consideration need be given to it.    [Illustration: FIG. 15]    96. BAKED BANANAS.--If bananas are to be cooked, they can be made very  appetizing by baking them with a sirup made of vinegar, sugar, and  butter. When prepared in this way, they should be cut in two  lengthwise, and then baked in a shallow pan, as Fig. 15 shows.    BAKED BANANAS  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    6 bananas  2 Tb. butter  1/3 c. sugar  3 Tb. vinegar    Remove the skins from the bananas, scrape the surface as in Fig. 14, and  cut them in half lengthwise. Arrange the halves in a shallow pan. Melt  the butter and mix it with the sugar and the vinegar. Pour a spoonful of  the mixture over each banana and then set the pan in the oven. Bake in a  slow oven for about 20 minutes, basting frequently with the remainder of  the sirup during the baking. Remove from the oven and serve hot.    97. Banana Fritters.--Delicious fritters can be made with bananas as a  foundation. The accompanying recipe, if carefully followed, will result  in a dish that will be appetizing, especially to those who are fond of  this fruit.    BANANA FRITTERS  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    4 bananas  1 Tb. lemon juice  1/2 c. flour  2 Tb. sugar  1/4 tsp. salt  1/3 c. milk  1 egg  1 Tb. butter, melted  Powdered sugar    Remove the skins from the bananas, scrape them, and cut them once  lengthwise and once crosswise. Sprinkle the pieces with the lemon juice.  Make a batter by mixing and sifting the flour, sugar, and salt. Stir in  the milk gradually, and add the yolk of the beaten egg and the melted  butter. Lastly, fold in the beaten egg white. Sprinkle the bananas with  powdered sugar, dip them into the batter, and fry in deep fat until  brown. Sprinkle again with powdered sugar and serve.      PINEAPPLES    98. Pineapples are grown in the southern part of the United States, on  the islands off the southeastern coast, and in Hawaii. They vary in size  according to the age of the plants. It requires from 18 to 20 months for  the fruit to develop, and the plants yield only four or five crops. Much  of this fruit is canned where it is grown, but as it is covered with a  heavy skin it will tolerate shipping long distances very well. It is  shipped to the market in cases that contain from 24 to 48 pineapples to  the case. Usually, for a few weeks during the summer, the price of fresh  pineapples is reasonable enough to warrant canning them.    [Illustration: FIG. 16]    99. The food value of pineapples is slightly lower than that of oranges  and apples. However, pineapples have a great deal of flavor, and for  this reason they are very valuable in the making of desserts, preserves,  marmalades, and beverages of various kinds. It is said that the  combination of pineapple and lemon will flavor a greater amount of food  than any other fruit combined. Another characteristic of pineapples is  that they contain a ferment that acts upon protein material and  therefore is sometimes thought to aid considerably in the digestion of  food. The probabilities are that this ferment really produces very  little action in the stomach, but its effect upon protein material can  readily be observed by attempting to use raw pineapple in the making of  a gelatine dessert. If the pineapple is put in raw, the gelatine will  not solidify; but if the pineapple is heated sufficiently to kill this  ferment, it has no effect whatsoever upon the gelatine.    [Illustration: FIG. 17]    100. SELECTING PINEAPPLES.--When pineapples are to be selected, care  should be exercised to see that they are ripe. The most certain way of  determining this fact is to pull out the center leaves of each pineapple  that is chosen. As shown in Fig. 16, grasp the pineapple with one hand  and then with the other pull out, one at a time, several of the center  leaves of the tuft at the top. If the fruit is ripe a sharp jerk will  usually remove each leaf readily, but the harder the leaves pull, the  greener the pineapple is.    [Illustration: FIG. 18]    An overripe pineapple is just as unsatisfactory as one that is not ripe  enough.

I had sent  thence Corporal Macavoy and Yuranigh to follow the track of Baldock and  the horses; but it was obvious that we could remain no longer at  Canbelego. As soon as we could set up one of the half-boats, the contents  of the water-kegs were emptied into it, and the cart was immediately sent  back with the empty kegs to Canbelego, where fresh horses had been left,  to continue with the same cart and empty kegs to Nyingan during the  night, so as to arrive in time to admit of the dray--already there with  the harness casks--bringing an additional supply back in the kegs, when  the bullocks returned next day.    It was now necessary that I should ascertain as soon as possible the  state of the ponds lower down the Bogan, and thereupon determine at once,  whether to follow that dry channel further in such a season, or to cross  to the pond in Duck Creek, and await more favourable weather. I  accordingly set out at 3 P.M., from where the water had been placed in  the half-boat, accompanied by Dr. Stephenson, and followed by Corporal  Graham and Dicky the native boy. By the advice of the latter, I rode from  the camp in the direction of 30 deg. E. of N., and, crossing the Bogan, we  reached at about 31/2 miles beyond it, a channel like it, which I supposed  was Duck Creek; and in it, just where we made it, there was a small pond  of water. Having refreshed our horses, we followed this channel  downwards, without meeting with more water. To my surprise, I found the  general direction was westward, until it JOINED THE BOGAN. We next  followed the course of the Bogan as long as daylight allowed us to do so,  without discovering any indication that water had recently lodged in any  of the hollows, and we finally tied up our horses and lay down to sleep,  in hopes that next day might enable us to be more successful.    22D JANUARY.--Having proceeded some miles along the western bends of the  Bogan, hastily--being desirous to see that day the great pond beyond  Mount Hopeless--I observed that the clay was very shining and compact in  a hollow sloping into an angle of the river-bed, that the grass was green  as from recent rain, and that there was more chirping of birds; I was  tempted once more by these indications, to look for water in the Bogan's  almost hopeless channel, and there we found a pond, at sight of which  poor Dicky shouted for joy; then drank, and fell asleep almost in the  water. It was small, but being sufficient for our immediate wants, we  thankfully refreshed our horses and ourselves, and proceeded on our  eventful journey. Almost immediately after leaving this pond I discovered  my old track, which we continued to follow across those large plains,  whence I had formerly discovered Mount Hopeless. These plains I soon  again recognized from the old tracks of my draywheels, distinctly visible  in many places after a lapse of nearly eleven years. Arriving at length  near the debateable land of Lee's old station, we resumed our examination  of the Bogan. There we perceived old cattle tracks; the ovens in which  the natives had roasted whole bullocks, and about their old encampments  many heaps of bones; but in none of the deep beds of former ponds or  lagoons could we discover any water. The grass was nevertheless excellent  and abundant; and its waste, added to the distress the want of water  occasioned us, made us doubly lament the absence of civilised  inhabitants, by whose industry that rich pasture and fine soil could have  been turned to good account. We saw no natives; nor were even kangaroos  or emus to be seen, as formerly, any longer inhabitants of these parts. I  turned at length, reluctantly, convinced that it would have been unsafe  to venture with cattle and drays into these regions before rain fell. In  returning, we at first found it difficult to find our old track, by which  alone we could hope that night to reach the small pond of the morning;  but Dr. Stephenson very fortunately found it, and we had also the good  fortune, for so we considered it, to arrive at the pond before sunset.  There we tied up our horses and lay down, glad indeed to have even that  water before our eyes. Dicky, the native boy, had repeatedly thrown  himself from his horse during the afternoon, quite ill from thirst.    23D JANUARY.--After our horses had drank, we left no water in the pond;  but they had fed on good grass, and we were well refreshed, although with  water only, for our ride back to the camp. Setting off from an old marked  tree of mine near the Bogan, on a bearing of 160 deg., I several times during  our ride fell in with the old track, and finally reached the camp after a  rapid ride of four hours. I found the whole party had arrived the  previous evening with the water, as arranged; but that Mr. Kennedy was  absent, having set off that morning in search of water to the N. E. with  Corporal Macavoy, on two government horses, leaving word that he should  return by twelve o'clock. He did not return at that hour, however, and at  two I moved the party across the Bogan, and proceeded along open plains  towards the ponds at Duck Creek, with the intention of there refreshing  the cattle and horses, and awaiting more favourable weather. I previously  watered out of the half-boat, 106 bullocks, and gave a quart to each of  the horses. On the way, the heat was so intense that our three best and  strongest kangaroo dogs died, and it was not until 10 P. M. that the  drays reached the ponds where I had proposed to encamp. About an hour and  a half before, Mr. Kennedy also came in, having galloped the two horses  66 miles, and hurt both their backs, Macavoy being a heavy man. At 9 P.  M., therm. 80 deg., wet bulb, 68 deg..    24TH JANUARY.--This morning I awoke completely blind, from ophthalmia,  and was obliged to have poultices laid on my eyes; several of the men  were also affected in the same manner. The exciting cause of this malady  in an organ presenting a moist surface was, obviously, the warm air  wholly devoid of moisture, and likely to produce the same effect until  the weather changed.

Fourteen were applied to my eyes the same afternoon. The ground  here was quite naked; it was, in fact, the blue clay of the Darling, with  the same sterile looking plants; and no time was to be lost in seeking  some ponds where there might be also good grass for the cattle. Therm. at  sunrise, 97 deg.; at noon, 100 deg.; at 9 P.M. 90 deg.; with wet bulb, 71 deg..    26TH JANUARY.--I sent Corporal Graham with Piper, in a N. E. direction to  where we had observed the light of burning woods reflected from a cloudy  sky last evening; considering that a sure indication that water was near,  as natives are seldom found where there is none. He returned early with  the welcome tidings that he had found abundance of water in a creek about  five miles off, and excellent grass upon its banks. My eyes were so far  recovered that I could observe the altitude of a star, thus ascertaining  the latitude of this camp to be 31 deg. 20' 20\" S. Therm. at sunrise, 85 deg.; at  noon, 112 deg.; at 9 P.M. 84 deg.; with wet bulb, 70 deg..    27TH JANUARY.--The whole party moved to the ponds called \"Cannonba\" by  the natives. There we found greater abundance of water and better grass  than we had seen near water during the whole journey, and I determined to  halt for at least two weeks, as part of the time I had previously  intended to devote to the repose and refreshment of the cattle, when we  should have reached the Darling. The cattle and their drivers had been  much harassed, and both needed and deserved rest. The horses had got out  of condition, and I considered that when we arrived at the Darling their  services would be more required. I was also to try the experiment here,  whether I might prosecute the journey without danger of losing my  eyesight; to have abandoned the undertaking at that point, had been  almost as painful to me as the other alternative. There were no hostile  natives here, the fire having been set up by some solitary gins; rain was  daily to be expected, at least cooler weather would certainly come in a  short time; the wheels of the drays had been long represented to me as  needing a thorough repair, from the effect of the heat on the wheels;--  and, upon the whole, I considered it"]]]
