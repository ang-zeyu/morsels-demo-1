When he thrust, however, I was not there, for I had fought with  therns before; and while none had ever resorted to precisely that  same expedient, I knew them to be the least honorable and most  treacherous fighters upon Mars, and so was ever on the alert for  some new and devilish subterfuge when I was engaged with one of  their race.    But at length he overdid the thing; for, drawing his shortsword,  he hurled it, javelinwise, at my body, at the same instant rushing  upon me with his long-sword.  A single sweeping circle of my own  blade caught the flying weapon and hurled it clattering against  the far wall, and then, as I sidestepped my antagonist's impetuous  rush, I let him have my point full in the stomach as he hurtled  by.    Clear to the hilt my weapon passed through his body, and with a  frightful shriek he sank to the floor, dead.    Halting only for the brief instant that was required to wrench  my sword from the carcass of my late antagonist, I sprang across  the chamber to the blank wall beyond, through which the thern had  attempted to pass.  Here I sought for the secret of its lock, but  all to no avail.    In despair I tried to force the thing, but the cold, unyielding  stone might well have laughed at my futile, puny endeavors.  In fact,  I could have sworn that I caught the faint suggestion of taunting  laughter from beyond the baffling panel.    In disgust I desisted from my useless efforts and stepped to the  chamber's single window.    The slopes of Otz and the distant Valley of Lost Souls held nothing  to compel my interest then; but, towering far above me, the tower's  carved wall riveted my keenest attention.    Somewhere within that massive pile was Dejah Thoris.  Above me I  could see windows.  There, possibly, lay the only way by which I  could reach her.  The risk was great, but not too great when the  fate of a world's most wondrous woman was at stake.    I glanced below.  A hundred feet beneath lay jagged granite boulders  at the brink of a frightful chasm upon which the tower abutted; and  if not upon the boulders, then at the chasm's bottom, lay death,  should a foot slip but once, or clutching fingers loose their hold  for the fraction of an instant.    But there was no other way and with a shrug, which I must admit  was half shudder, I stepped to the window's outer sill and began  my perilous ascent.    To my dismay I found that, unlike the ornamentation upon most  Heliumetic structures, the edges of the carvings were quite generally  rounded, so that at best my every hold was most precarious.    Fifty feet above me commenced a series of projecting cylindrical  stones some six inches in diameter.  These apparently circled the  tower at six-foot intervals, in bands six feet apart; and as each  stone cylinder protruded some four or five inches beyond the surface  of the other ornamentation, they presented a comparatively easy  mode of ascent could I but reach them.    Laboriously I climbed toward them by way of some windows which  lay below them, for I hoped that I might find ingress to the tower  through one of these, and thence an easier avenue along which to  prosecute my search.    At times so slight was my hold upon the rounded surfaces of the  carving's edges that a sneeze, a cough, or even a slight gust of  wind would have dislodged me and sent me hurtling to the depths  below.    But finally I reached a point where my fingers could just clutch  the sill of the lowest window, and I was on the point of breathing  a sigh of relief when the sound of voices came to me from above  through the open window.    \"He can never solve the secret of that lock.\"  The voice was Matai  Shang's.  \"Let us proceed to the hangar above that we may be far  to the south before he finds another way--should that be possible.\"    \"All things seem possible to that vile calot,\" replied another  voice, which I recognized as Thurid's.    \"Then let us haste,\" said Matai Shang.  \"But to be doubly sure, I  will leave two who shall patrol this runway.  Later they may follow  us upon another flier--overtaking us at Kaol.\"    My upstretched fingers never reached the window's sill.  At the  first sound of the voices I drew back my hand and clung there to  my perilous perch, flattened against the perpendicular wall, scarce  daring to breathe.    What a horrible position, indeed, in which to be discovered by  Thurid!  He had but to lean from the window to push me with his  sword's point into eternity.    Presently the sound of the voices became fainter, and once again  I took up my hazardous ascent, now more difficult, since more  circuitous, for I must climb so as to avoid the windows.    Matai Shang's reference to the hangar and the fliers indicated  that my destination lay nothing short of the roof of the tower,  and toward this seemingly distant goal I set my face.    The most difficult and dangerous part of the journey was accomplished  at last, and it was with relief that I felt my fingers close about  the lowest of the stone cylinders.    It is true that these projections were too far apart to make the  balance of the ascent anything of a sinecure, but I at least had  always within my reach a point of safety to which I might cling in  case of accident.    Some ten feet below the roof, the wall inclined slightly inward  possibly a foot in the last ten feet, and here the climbing was  indeed immeasurably easier, so that my fingers soon clutched the  eaves.    As I drew my eyes above the level of the tower's top I saw a flier  all but ready to rise.    Upon her deck were Matai Shang, Phaidor, Dejah Thoris, Thuvia of  Ptarth, and a few thern warriors, while near her was Thurid in the  act of clambering aboard.    He was not ten paces from me, facing in the opposite direction;  and what cruel freak of fate should have caused him to turn about  just as my eyes topped the roof's edge I may not even guess.    But turn he did; and when his eyes met mine his wicked face lighted  with a malignant smile as he leaped toward me, where I was hastening  to scramble to the secure footing of the roof.    Dejah Thoris must have seen me at the same instant, for she screamed  a useless warning just as Thurid's foot, swinging in a mighty kick,  landed full in my face.    Like a felled ox, I reeled and tumbled backward over the tower's  side.          ON THE KAOLIAN ROAD      If there be a fate that is sometimes cruel to me, there surely is  a kind and merciful Providence which watches over me.    As I toppled from the tower into the horrid abyss below I counted  myself already dead; and Thurid must have done likewise, for he  evidently did not even trouble himself to look after me, but must  have turned and mounted the waiting flier at once.    Ten feet only I fell, and then a loop of my tough, leathern harness  caught upon one of the cylindrical stone projections in the tower's  surface--and held.  Even when I had ceased to fall I could not  believe the miracle that had preserved me from instant death, and  for a moment I hung there, cold sweat exuding from every pore of  my body.    But when at last I had worked myself back to a firm position  I hesitated to ascend, since I could not know that Thurid was not  still awaiting me above.    Presently, however, there came to my ears the whirring of the  propellers of a flier, and as each moment the sound grew fainter  I realized that the party had proceeded toward the south without  assuring themselves as to my fate.    Cautiously I retraced my way to the roof, and I must admit that  it was with no pleasant sensation that I raised my eyes once more  above its edge; but, to my relief, there was no one in sight, and  a moment later I stood safely upon its broad surface.    To reach the hangar and drag forth the only other flier which it  contained was the work of but an instant; and just as the two thern  warriors whom Matai Shang had left to prevent this very contingency  emerged upon the roof from the tower's interior, I rose above them  with a taunting laugh.    Then I dived rapidly to the inner court where I had last seen Woola,  and to my immense relief found the faithful beast still there.    The twelve great banths lay in the doorways of their lairs, eyeing  him and growling ominously, but they had not disobeyed Thuvia's  injunction; and I thanked the fate that had made her their keeper  within the Golden Cliffs, and endowed her with the kind and  sympathetic nature that had won the loyalty and affection of these  fierce beasts for her.    Woola leaped in frantic joy when he discovered me; and as the flier  touched the pavement of the court for a brief instant he bounded  to the deck beside me, and in the bearlike manifestation of his  exuberant happiness all but caused me to wreck the vessel against  the courtyard's rocky wall.    Amid the angry shouting of thern guardsmen we rose high above the  last fortress of the Holy Therns, and then raced straight toward  the northeast and Kaol, the destination which I had heard from the  lips of Matai Shang.    Far ahead, a tiny speck in the distance, I made out another flier  late in the afternoon.  It could be none other than that which bore  my lost love and my enemies.    I had gained considerably on the craft by night; and then, knowing  that they must have sighted me and would show no lights after  dark, I set my destination compass upon her--that wonderful little  Martian mechanism which, once attuned to the object of destination,  points away toward it, irrespective of every change in its location.    All that night we raced through the Barsoomian void, passing over  low hills and dead sea bottoms; above long-deserted cities and  populous centers of red Martian habitation upon the ribbon-like  lines of cultivated land which border the globe-encircling waterways,  which Earth men call the canals of Mars.    Dawn showed that I had gained"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6812"],[0,"Abraham Lincoln: a History — Volume 01 (#9)"],[1,"of the occasion to carry a rifle and take advantage of any  game which might be stirring during the long walk. Arriving at the  place of meeting, which was some log cabin if the weather was foul, or  the shade of a tree if it was fair, the assembled worshipers threw  their provisions into a common store and picnicked in neighborly  companionship. The preacher would then take off his coat, and go at  his work with an energy unknown to our days.    There were few other social meetings. Men came together for  \"raisings,\" where a house was built in a day; for \"log-rollings,\"  where tons of excellent timber were piled together and wastefully  burned; for wolf-hunts, where a tall pole was erected in the midst of  a prairie or clearing, and a great circle of hunters formed around it,  sometimes of miles in diameter, which, gradually contracting with  shouts and yells, drove all the game in the woods together at the pole  for slaughter; and for horse-races, which bore little resemblance to  those magnificent exhibitions which are the boast of Kentucky at this  time. In these affairs the women naturally took no part; but weddings,  which were entertainments scarcely less rude and boisterous, were  their own peculiar province. These festivities lasted rarely less than  twenty-four hours. The guests assembled in the morning. There was a  race for the whisky bottle; a midday dinner; an afternoon of rough  games and outrageous practical jokes; a supper and dance at night,  interrupted by the successive withdrawals of the bride and of the  groom, attended with ceremonies and jests of more than Rabelaisian  crudeness; and a noisy dispersal next day.    [Sidenote: O. H. Smith, \"Early Indiana Trials,\" p. 285.]    The one point at which they instinctively clung to civilization was  their regard for law and reverence for courts of justice. Yet these  were of the simplest character and totally devoid of any adventitious  accessories. An early jurist of the country writes: \"I was Circuit  Prosecuting Attorney at the time of the trials at the falls of Fall  Creek, where Pendleton now stands. Four of the prisoners were  convicted of murder, and three of them hung, for killing Indians. The  court was held in a double log cabin, the grand jury sat upon a log in  the woods, and the foreman signed the bills of indictment, which I had  prepared, upon his knee; there was not a petit juror that had shoes  on; all wore moccasins, and were belted around the waist, and carried  side-knives used by the hunters.\" Yet amidst all this apparent  savagery we see justice was done, and the law vindicated even against  the bitterest prejudices of these pioneer jurymen.    [Sidenote: Lamon, p. 44.]    They were full of strange superstitions. The belief in witchcraft had  long ago passed away with the smoke of the fagots from old and New  England, but it survived far into this century in Kentucky and the  lower halves of Indiana and Illinois--touched with a peculiar tinge of  African magic. The pioneers believed in it for good and evil. Their  veterinary practice was mostly by charms and incantations; and when a  person believed himself bewitched, a shot at the image of the witch  with a bullet melted out of a half-dollar was the favorite curative  agency. Luck was an active divinity in their apprehension, powerful  for blessing or bane, announced by homely signs, to be placated by  quaint ceremonies. A dog crossing the hunter's path spoiled his day,  unless he instantly hooked his little fingers together, and pulled  till the animal disappeared. They were familiar with the ever-  recurring mystification of the witch-hazel, or divining-rod; and the  \"cure by faith\" was as well known to them as it has since become in a  more sophisticated state of society. The commonest occurrences were  heralds of death and doom. A bird lighting in a window, a dog baying  at certain hours, the cough of a horse in the direction of a child,  the sight, or worse still, the touch of a dead snake, heralded  domestic woe. A wagon driving past the house with a load of baskets  was a warning of atmospheric disturbance. A vague and ignorant  astronomy governed their plantings and sowings, the breeding of their  cattle, and all farm-work. They must fell trees for fence-rails before  noon, and in the waxing of the moon. Fences built when there was no  moon would give way; but that was the proper season for planting  potatoes and other vegetables whose fruit grows underground; those  which bore their product in the air must be planted when the moon  shone. The magical power of the moon was wide in its influence; it  extended to the most minute details of life.    [Sidenote: Lamon, p. 52.]    Among these people, and in all essential respects one of them, Abraham  Lincoln passed his childhood and youth. He was not remarkably  precocious. His mind was slow in acquisition, and his powers of  reasoning and rhetoric improved constantly to the end of his life, at  a rate of progress marvelously regular and sustained. But there was  that about him, even at the age of nineteen years, which might well  justify his admiring friends in presaging for him an unusual career.  He had read every book he could find, and could \"spell down\" the whole  county at their orthographical contests. By dint of constant practice  he had acquired an admirably clear and serviceable handwriting. He  occasionally astounded his companions by such glimpses of occult  science as that the world is round and that the sun is relatively  stationary. He wrote, for his own amusement and edification, essays on  politics, of which gentlemen of standing who had been favored with a  perusal said with authority, at the cross-roads grocery, \"The world  can't beat it.\" One or two of these compositions got into print and  vastly increased the author's local fame. He was also a magnanimous  boy, with a larger and kindlier spirit than common. His generosity,  courage, and capability of discerning two sides to a dispute, were  remarkable even then, and won him the admiration of those to whom such  qualities were unknown. But perhaps, after all, the thing which gained  and fixed his mastery over his fellows was to a great degree his  gigantic stature and strength. He attained his full growth, six feet  and four inches, two years before he came of age. He rarely met with a  man he could not easily handle. His strength is still a tradition in  Spencer County. One aged man says that he has seen him pick up and  carry away a chicken-house weighing six hundred pounds. At another  time, seeing some men preparing a contrivance for lifting some large  posts, Abe quickly shouldered the posts and took them where they were  needed. One of his employers says, \"He could sink an axe deeper into  wood than any man I ever saw.\" With strength like this and a brain to  direct it, a man was a born leader in that country and at that time.  There are, of course, foolish stories extant that Abraham used to  boast, and that others used to predict, that he would be President  some day. The same thing is daily said of thousands of boys who will  never be constables. But there is evidence that he felt too large for  the life of a farmhand on Pigeon Creek, and his thoughts naturally  turned, after the manner of restless boys in the West, to the river,  as the avenue of escape from the narrow life of the woods. He once  asked an old friend to give him a recommendation to some steamboat on  the Ohio, but desisted from his purpose on being reminded that his  father had the right to dispose of his time for a year or so more. But  in 1828 an opportunity offered for a little glimpse of the world  outside, and the boy gladly embraced it. He was hired by Mr. Gentry,  the proprietor of the neighboring village of Gentryville, to accompany  his son with a flat-boat of produce to New Orleans and intermediate  landings. The voyage was made successfully, and Abraham gained great  credit for his management and sale of the cargo. The only important  incident of the trip occurred at the plantation of Madame Duchesne, a  few miles below Baton Rouge. The young merchants had tied up for the  night and were asleep in the cabin, when they were aroused by  shuffling footsteps, which proved to be a gang of marauding negroes,  coming to rob the boat. Abraham instantly attacked them with a club,  knocked several overboard and put the rest to flight; flushed with  battle, he and Allen Gentry carried the war into the enemy's country,  and pursued the retreating Africans some distance in the darkness.  They then returned to the boat, bleeding but victorious, and hastily  swung into the stream and floated down the river till daylight.  Lincoln's exertion in later years for the welfare of the African race  showed that this nocturnal battle had not led him to any hasty and  hostile generalizations.    The next autumn, John Hanks, the steadiest and most trustworthy of his  family, went to Illinois. Though an illiterate and rather dull man, he  had a good deal of solidity of character and consequently some  influence and consideration in the household. He settled in Macon  County, and was so well pleased with the country, and especially with  its admirable distribution into prairie and timber, that he sent  repeated messages to his friends in Indiana to come out and join him.  Thomas Lincoln was always ready to move. He had probably by this time  despaired of ever owning any unencumbered real estate in Indiana, and  the younger members of the family had little to bind them to the place  where they saw nothing in the future but hard work and poor living.  Thomas Lincoln handed over his farm to Mr. Gentry, sold his crop of  corn and hogs, packed his household goods and those of his children  and sons-in-law into a single wagon, drawn by two yoke of oxen, the  combined wealth of himself and Dennis Hanks, and started for the new  State.
