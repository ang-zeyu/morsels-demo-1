Indeed I regard it as certain that he would be removed  from any prison before you arrived there, or if still there, that his  dungeon would not be shown to you. At the same time, you would be doing  good work. Already there have been some terrible disclosures as to the  state of the Neapolitan prisons. These, however, have chiefly been made  by men who have been confined there, and have been denounced as  calumnies by the Neapolitan government; but coming from you, armed with  the authority of our foreign office, they could not but make a profound  impression. They might force the authorities to ameliorate the present  state of things, and would certainly enlist the sympathy of the British  public with the cause with which Professor Forli was associated, and for  which I am aware you yourself fought.\"    A fortnight later Captain Percival was again sent for by the foreign  minister.    \"Here,\" the latter said, \"is a royal order from the King of Naples for  you to view any or all the prisons in his dominions without let or  hindrance, in order to assure yourself that Professor Forli is not an  inmate of any of them.\"    Two days later Captain Percival started. On arriving at Naples, he first  called upon the Neapolitan minister, who expressed himself with some  indignation on the fact that the assurance of the government that they  knew nothing of Professor Forli's disappearance had been doubted; but  stated that they were ready to offer him any facility in his search.  Before commencing this, Captain Percival went out to the professor's  estate, near Capua, and saw the proprietor, who assured him that he had  neither seen nor heard anything of its late owner; and although his  assertions would have weighed but little if unsupported, Captain  Percival's investigations in the town and of several persons upon the  estate all tended to show that the professor had not been seen there.  His appearance was familiar to many, and he could hardly have visited  the place without being recognised. Captain Percival went to see several  of Signor Forli's old friends, upon whom he would almost certainly have  called before going to the estate, and from whom, indeed, he would have  received far more information as to its condition than he would have  obtained by direct application to a man who could not but have regarded  him with hostility; none of them, however, had heard of his return to  Italy.    After stopping two or three days there, he returned to Naples and began  his inspection of the prisons. The Royal order being presented, he was  everywhere received courteously, allowed to inspect them from the lowest  dungeons to the attics under the roofs, and also to hold conversations  with the prisoners. He had no idea that he would actually find the  professor; his great hope was that he should learn from prisoners that  he had been confined there, as this would enable the British government  to demand his instant release. Terrible as had been the descriptions he  had heard of the treatment of the prisoners and the state of the jails,  they fell far short of the reality; and he not only sent detailed  reports to the government, but also to _The Times_, which published them  in full. They were copied into every paper in the kingdom, and created a  general feeling of indignation and disgust.    Failing to obtain the smallest information as to the professor at  Naples, Captain Percival then went down to Salerno, and left there with  the intention of visiting the prisons in Calabria and at Reggio, and  afterwards of crossing into Sicily and trying the gaols there. Four days  after he left Salerno, the servant he had engaged in Naples returned to  the town with the news that the carriage had been attacked by brigands,  and that his master, who always carried a brace of pistols, had offered  a desperate resistance, but had been killed. The horses had been taken  out of the carriage, and they and Captain Percival's luggage had been  carried off to the hills. He himself had been allowed to return. The  Governor of Salerno at once sent the man to Naples; the news was  officially communicated to the British envoy, who telegraphed at once to  London. A message was returned, saying that an official communication  would be addressed to the government, and in the meantime he was to send  down one of the officers of the embassy to inquire into the whole  matter. He was to request the Neapolitan government to furnish an escort  from Salerno, and was also to demand that steps should be taken to  pursue and bring the brigands to justice.    The secretary of the legation had no difficulty in obtaining the order  for an escort; and taking with him the servant who had brought the news,  proceeded to the place where the affair had occurred. The carriage was  found overthrown by the roadside. There were two or three bullet-holes  in it; there was a dark patch evidently caused by blood in the road  close by; and a few yards away was a bloodstained cap, which the servant  recognised as being that of Captain Percival. Following up a track which  led off the main road from here, they came upon some fragments of  letters, among them one on which were the words, \"Your loving wife,  Muriel.\" For two or three days the hills on each side of the track were  searched, but no sign whatever was found of Captain Percival's body. In  the meantime, a strong force of carabinieri searched the mountains, and  three weeks after the return to Naples of the search party from the  legation, came the news that they had surprised and killed a notorious  brigand leader with three of his followers, and had taken prisoner a  fourth. This man was sent to Naples, and there questioned by a judicial  official in the presence of the secretary of the legation.    He acknowledged that he had been one of the party, consisting of their  leader and seven followers, who had attacked the Englishman's carriage.  They had not intended to kill him, but to carry him off for ransom; he,  however, resisted so desperately that he was shot. Although very  seriously wounded, they had carried him up to the mountains, believing  that he would recover, and that they might still make money out of him.  The man himself had been sent down to Salerno to ascertain whether the  authorities were taking any steps to hunt down his capturers. As soon as  he learned that a strong force of carabinieri had been ordered out in  pursuit, he had returned to the hut occupied by his chief. He found that  during his absence the prisoner had died. He had never asked where he  had been buried, for it was a matter that did not concern him. The  contents of the portmanteau had been divided among the party; he was  himself now wearing the boots and one of the shirts of the dead man.  That was all he knew.    The captain of the carabinieri testified that he had found an English  portmanteau and many articles, some of which bore the initials \"L. P.\"  upon them; there was a brace of handsome pistols of English make, which  were used by the chief of the brigands in the fight; and in a cupboard  among other things was the royal order for Captain Percival to visit his  majesty's prisons. A diligent search had been made in the neighbourhood  of the hut, but the grave of the English gentleman had not been  discovered. In due time the brigand was placed on trial, and was  sentenced to imprisonment for life; and so the matter ended, save for  the two widowed women and Frank.    It had been a heavy blow indeed for the lad, who was passionately  attached to his father, and had also loved the professor, who had always  been extremely fond of him. He was at home for Easter when the terrible  news arrived. Neither his mother nor grandmother expressed a doubt that  his father had been murdered; and when the news of the confession of one  of the band and the discovery of Captain Percival's belongings in the  hut of the brigands arrived, they gave up all hope of ever seeing him  again.    Madame Forli, however, while not doubting that Captain Percival had been  killed, believed that the Neapolitan government were at the bottom of  the matter. \"I know what the methods of the Neapolitans are,\" she said;  \"and the sensation caused by Leonard's letters to the papers here may  have decided them to put an end by any method to further revelations,  and they may very well have employed these brigands to carry out their  purpose. Every one knows that in many cases these men are in alliance  with the officers of the police; and the latter are well paid to wink at  their doings, and even to furnish them with information of the persons  worth robbing, and to put them on their guard when, as occasionally  happens, a raid is made by the carabinieri in the mountains. A capture  is hardly ever effected; and while there is little chance of a political  prisoner once shut up in their dungeons making his escape, notorious  brigands frequently succeed in doing so. Nobody dares to speak of their  suspicions; but there can be little doubt that the prison officials are  bribed to connive at their escape, knowing well enough that the  government will not trouble over the matter, while on the other hand the  escape of a political prisoner brings disgrace and punishment upon all  the prison officials.\"    \"I cannot think--I will not think so, mother,\" Muriel exclaimed; \"for  were it so, the same treatment might be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4558"],[0,"Barry Lyndon (#9)"],[1," to teach you manners.'    'It IS your fault,' repeated Mick. 'What business has the vagabond here?  If I had my will, I'd have him flogged and turned out.'    'And so he should be,' said Captain Quin.    'You'd best not try it, Quin,' said Ulick, who was always my champion;  and turning to his father, 'The fact is, sir, that the young monkey has  fallen in love with Nora, and finding her and the Captain mighty sweet  in the garden to-day, he was for murdering Jack Quin.'    'Gad, he's beginning young,' said my uncle, quite good-humouredly.  ''Faith, Fagan, that boy's a Brady, every inch of him.'    'And I'll tell you what, Mr. B.,' cried Quin, bristling up: 'I've been  insulted grossly in this 'OUSE. I ain't at all satisfied with these here  ways of going on. I'm an Englishman I am, and a man of property; and  I--I'--'If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of  us, Quin,' said Ulick gruffly. On which the Captain fell to washing his  nose in water, and answered never a word.    'Mr. Quin,' said I, in the most dignified tone I could assume, 'may  also have satisfaction any time he pleases, by calling on Redmond Barry,  Esquire, of Barryville.' At which speech my uncle burst out a-laughing  (as he did at everything); and in this laugh, Captain Fagan, much to my  mortification, joined. I turned rather smartly upon him, however, and  bade him to understand that as for my cousin Ulick, who had been my best  friend through life, I could put up with rough treatment from him; yet,  though I was a boy, even that sort of treatment I would bear from him  no longer; and any other person who ventured on the like would find me a  man, to their cost. 'Mr. Quin,' I added, 'knows that fact very well; and  if HE'S a man, he'll know where to find me.'    My uncle now observed that it was getting late, and that my mother would  be anxious about me. 'One of you had better go home with him,' said he,  turning to his sons, 'or the lad may be playing more pranks.' But Ulick  said, with a nod to his brother, 'Both of us ride home with Quin here.'    'I'm not afraid of Freny's people,' said the Captain, with a faint  attempt at a laugh; 'my man is armed, and so am I.'    'You know the use of arms very well, Quin,' said Ulick; 'and no one can  doubt your courage; but Mick and I will see you home for all that.'    'Why, you'll not be home till morning, boys. Kilwangan's a good ten mile  from here.'    'We'll sleep at Quin's quarters,' replied Ulick: 'WE'RE GOING TO STOP A  WEEK THERE.'    'Thank you,' says Quin, very faint; 'it's very kind of you.'    'You'll be lonely, you know, without us.'    'Oh yes, very lonely!' says Quin.    'And in ANOTHER WEEK, my boy,' says Ulick (and here he whispered  something in the Captain's ear, in which I thought I caught the words  'marriage,' 'parson,' and felt all my fury returning again).    'As you please,' whined out the Captain; and the horses were quickly  brought round, and the three gentlemen rode away.    Fagan stopped, and, at my uncle's injunction, walked across the old  treeless park with me. He said that after the quarrel at dinner, he  thought I would scarcely want to see the ladies that night, in which  opinion I concurred entirely; and so we went off without an adieu.    'A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Redmond,' said  he. 'What! you a friend to the Bradys, and knowing your uncle to be  distressed for money, try and break off a match which will bring fifteen  hundred a year into the family? Quin has promised to pay off the four  thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl  without a penny--a girl with no more beauty than yonder bullock.  Well, well, don't look furious; let's say she IS handsome--there's no  accounting for tastes,--a girl that has been flinging herself at the  head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and MISSING them  all. And you, as poor as herself, a boy of fifteen--well, sixteen, if  you insist--and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your  father'--    'And so I am,' said I.    'And this is the return you make him for his kindness! Didn't he harbour  you in his house when you were an orphan, and hasn't he given you  rent-free your fine mansion of Barryville yonder? And now, when his  affairs can be put into order, and a chance offers for his old age to  be made comfortable, who flings himself in the way of him and  competence?--You, of all others; the man in the world most obliged to  him. It's wicked, ungrateful, unnatural. From a lad of such spirit as  you are, I expect a truer courage.'    'I am not afraid of any man alive,' exclaimed I (for this latter part of  the Captain's argument had rather staggered me, and I wished, of course,  to turn it--as one always should when the enemy's too strong); 'and it's  _I_ am the injured man, Captain Fagan. No man was ever, since the world  began, treated so. Look here--look at this riband. I've worn it in  my heart for six months. I've had it there all the time of the fever.  Didn't Nora take it out of her own bosom and give it me? Didn't she kiss  me when she gave it me, and call me her darling Redmond?'    'She was PRACTISING,' replied Mr. Fagan, with a sneer. 'I know women,  sir. Give them time, and let nobody else come to the house, and they'll  fall in love with a chimney-sweep. There was a young lady in Fermoy'--    'A young lady in flames,' roared I (but I used a still hotter word).  'Mark this; come what will of it, I swear I'll fight the man who  pretends to the hand of Nora Brady. I'll follow him, if it's into the  church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine;  and this riband shall be found dyed in it. Yes, and if I kill him, I'll  pin it on his breast, and then she may go and take back her token.' This  I said because I was very much excited at the time, and because I had  not read novels and romantic plays for nothing.    'Well,' says Fagan after a pause, 'if it must be, it must. For a young  fellow, you are the most blood-thirsty I ever saw. Quin's a determined  fellow, too.'    'Will you take my message to him?' said I, quite eagerly.    'Hush!' said Fagan: 'your mother may be on the look-out. Here we are,  close to Barryville.'    'Mind! not a word to my mother,' I said; and went into the house  swelling with pride and exultation to think that I should have a chance  against the Englishman I hated so.    Tim, my servant, had come up from Barryville on my mother's return from  church; for the good lady was rather alarmed at my absence, and anxious  for my return. But he had seen me go in to dinner, at the invitation of  the sentimental lady's-maid; and when he had had his own share of the  good things in the kitchen, which was always better furnished than ours  at home, had walked back again to inform his mistress where I was, and,  no doubt, to tell her, in his own fashion, of all the events that had  happened at Castle Brady. In spite of my precautions to secrecy, then,  I half suspected that my mother knew all, from the manner in which she  embraced me on my arrival, and received our guest, Captain Fagan. The  poor soul looked a little anxious and flushed, and every now and then  gazed very hard in the Captain's face; but she said not a word about the  quarrel, for she had a noble spirit, and would as lief have seen anyone  of her kindred hanged as shirking from the field of honour. What has  become of those gallant feelings nowadays? Sixty years ago a man was a  MAN, in old Ireland, and the sword that was worn by his side was at the  service of any gentleman's gizzard, upon the slightest difference. But  the good old times and usages are fast fading away. One scarcely every  hears of a fair meeting now, and the use of those cowardly pistols, in  place of the honourable and manly weapon of gentlemen, has introduced  a deal of knavery into the practice of duelling, that cannot be  sufficiently deplored.    When I arrived at home I felt that I was a man in earnest, and welcoming  Captain Fagan to Barryville, and introducing him to my mother, in a  majestic and dignified way, said the Captain must be thirsty after his  walk, and called upon Tim to bring up a bottle of the yellow-sealed  Bordeaux, and cakes and glasses, immediately.    Tim looked at the mistress in great wonderment: and the fact is, that  six hours previous I would as soon have thought of burning the house  down as calling for a bottle of claret on my own account; but I felt I  was a man now, and had a right to command; and my mother felt this too,  for she turned to the fellow and said, sharply, 'Don't you hear, you  rascal, what YOUR MASTER says! Go, get the wine, and the cakes and  glasses, directly.' Then (for you may be sure she did not give Tim the  keys of our little cellar) she went and got the liquor herself; and Tim  brought it in, on the silver tray, in due form. My dear mother poured  out the wine, and drank the Captain welcome; but I observed her hand  shook very much as she performed this courteous duty, and the bottle  went clink, clink, against the glass. When she had tasted her glass,  she said she had a headache, and would go to bed; and so I asked her  blessing, as becomes a dutiful son--(the modern BLOODS have given up the  respectful ceremonies which distinguished a gentleman in my time)--and  she left me and Captain Fagan to talk over our important business.    'Indeed,' said the Captain,' I see now no other way out of the scrape  than a meeting. The fact is, there was a talk of it at Castle Brady,  after your attack upon Quin this afternoon, and he vowed that he would  cut you in pieces: but the tears and supplications of Miss Honoria  induced him, though very unwillingly, to relent. Now, however, matters  have gone too far. No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can  receive a glass of wine on his nose--this claret of yours is very good,  by the way, and by your leave we'll ring for another bottle--wi"]]]
