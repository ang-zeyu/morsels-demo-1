It was made, the captain told  me, with great subtlety by the secret craft of a family of six who lived  in a hut on the mountains of Hian Min. Once in these mountains, he said,  he followed the spoor of a bear, and he came suddenly on a man of that  family who had hunted the same bear, and he was at the end of a narrow way  with precipice all about him, and his spear was sticking in the bear, and  the wound was not fatal, and he had no other weapon. And the bear was  walking towards the man, very slowly because his wound irked him--yet he  was now very close. And what he captain did he would not say, but every  year as soon as the snows are hard, and travelling is easy on the Hian  Min, that man comes down to the market in the plains, and always leaves  for the captain in the gate of fair Belzoond a vessel of that priceless  secret wine.    And as I sipped the wine and the captain talked, I remembered me of  stalwart noble things that I had long since resolutely planned, and my  soul seemed to grow mightier within me and to dominate the whole tide of  the Yann. It may be that I then slept. Or, if I did not, I do not now  minutely recollect every detail of that morning's occupations. Towards  evening, I awoke and wishing to see Perdondaris before we left in the  morning, and being unable to wake the captain, I went ashore alone.  Certainly Perdondaris was a powerful city; it was encompassed by a wall of  great strength and altitude, having in it hollow ways for troops to walk  in, and battlements along it all the way, and fifteen strong towers on it  in every mile, and copper plaques low down where men could read them,  telling in all the languages of those parts of the earth--one language on  each plaque--the tale of how an army once attacked Perdondaris and what  befell that army. Then I entered Perdondaris and found all the people  dancing, clad in brilliant silks, and playing on the tambang as they  danced. For a fearful thunderstorm had terrified them while I slept, and  the fires of death, they said, had danced over Perdondaris, and now the  thunder had gone leaping away large and black and hideous, they said, over  the distant hills, and had turned round snarling at them, shoving his  gleaming teeth, and had stamped, as he went, upon the hilltops until they  rang as though they had been bronze. And often and again they stopped in  their merry dances and prayed to the God they knew not, saying, \"O, God  that we know not, we thank Thee for sending the thunder back to his  hills.\" And I went on and came to the market-place, and lying there upon  the marble pavement I saw the merchant fast asleep and breathing heavily,  with his face and the palms of his hands towards the sky, and slaves were  fanning him to keep away the flies. And from the market-place I came to a  silver temple and then to a palace of onyx, and there were many wonders in  Perdondaris, and I would have stayed and seen them all, but as I came to  the outer wall of the city I suddenly saw in it a huge ivory gate. For a  while I paused and admired it, then I came nearer and perceived the  dreadful truth. The gate was carved out of one solid piece!    I fled at once through the gateway and down to the ship, and even as I ran  I thought that I heard far off on the hills behind me the tramp of the  fearful beast by whom that mass of ivory was shed, who was perhaps even  then looking for his other tusk. When I was on the ship again I felt  safer, and I said nothing to the sailors of what I had seen.    And now the captain was gradually awakening. Now night was rolling up from  the East and North, and only the pinnacles of the towers of Perdondaris  still took the fallen sunlight. Then I went to the captain and told him  quietly of the thing I had seen. And he questioned me at once about the  gate, in a low voice, that the sailors might not know; and I told him how  the weight of the thing was such that it could not have been brought from  afar, and the captain knew that it had not been there a year ago. We  agreed that such a beast could never have been killed by any assault of  man, and that the gate must have been a fallen tusk, and one fallen near  and recently. Therefore he decided that it were better to flee at once; so  he commanded, and the sailors went to the sails, and others raised the  anchor to the deck, and just as the highest pinnacle of marble lost the  last rays of the sun we left Perdondaris, that famous city. And night came  down and cloaked Perdondaris and hid it from our eyes, which as things  have happened will never see it again; for I have heard since that  something swift and wonderful has suddenly wrecked Perdondaris in a  day--towers, walls and people.    And the night deepened over the River Yann, a night all white with stars.  And with the night there rose the helmsman's song. As soon as he had  prayed he began to sing to cheer himself all through the lonely night. But  first he prayed, praying the helmsman's prayer. And this is what I  remember of it, rendered into English with a very feeble equivalent of the  rhythm that seemed so resonant in those tropic nights.    To whatever god may hear.    Wherever there be sailors whether of river or sea: whether their way be  dark or whether through storm: whether their peril be of beast or of rock:  or from enemy lurking on land or pursuing on sea: wherever the tiller is  cold or the helmsman stiff: wherever sailors sleep or helmsmen watch:  guard, guide and return us to the old land, that has known us: to the far  homes that we know.    To all the gods that are.    To whatever god may hear.    So he prayed, and there was silence. And the sailors laid them down to  rest for the night. The silence deepened, and was only broken by the  ripples of Yann that lightly touched our prow. Sometimes some monster of  the river coughed.    Silence and ripples, ripples and silence again.    And then his loneliness came upon the helmsman, and he began to sing. And  he sang the market songs of Durl and Duz, and the old dragon-legends of  Belzoond.    Many a song he sang, telling to spacious and exotic Yann the little tales  and trifles of his city of Durl. And the songs welled up over the black  jungle and came into the clear cold air above, and the great bands of  stars that look on Yann began to know the affairs of Durl and Duz, and of  the shepherds that dwelt in the fields between, and the flocks that they  had, and the loves that they had loved, and all the little things that  they had hoped to do. And as I lay wrapped up in skins and blankets,  listening to those songs, and watching the fantastic shapes of the great  trees like to black giants stalking through the night, I suddenly fell  asleep.    When I awoke great mists were trailing away from the Yann. And the flow of  the river was tumbling now tumultuously, and little waves appeared; for  Yann had scented from afar the ancient crags of Glorm, and knew that their  ravines lay cool before him wherein he should meet the merry wild Irillion  rejoicing from fields of snow. So he shook off from him the torpid sleep  that had come upon him in the hot and scented jungle, and forgot its  orchids and its butterflies, and swept on turbulent, expectant, strong;  and soon the snowy peaks of the Hills of Glorm came glittering into view.  And now the sailors were waking up from sleep. Soon we all ate, and then  the helmsman laid him down to sleep while a comrade took his place, and  they all spread over him their choicest furs.    And in a while we heard the sound that the Irillion made as she came down  dancing from the fields of snow.    And then we saw the ravine in the Hills of Glorm lying precipitous and  smooth before us, into which we were carried by the leaps of Yann. And now  we left the steamy jungle and breathed the mountain air; the sailors stood  up and took deep breaths of it, and thought of their own far off Acroctian  hills on which were Durl and Duz--below them in the plains stands fair  Belzoond.    A great shadow brooded between the cliffs of Glorm, but the crags were  shining above us like gnarled moons, and almost lit the gloom. Louder and  louder came the Irillion's song, and the sound of her dancing down from  the fields of snow. And soon we saw her white and full of mists, and  wreathed with rainbows delicate and small that she had plucked up near the  mountain's summit from some celestial garden of the Sun. Then she went  away seawards with the huge grey Yann and the ravine widened, and opened  upon the world, and our rocking ship came through to the light of the day.    And all that morning and all the afternoon we passed through the marshes  of Pondoovery; and Yann widened there, and flowed solemnly and slowly, and  the captain bade the sailors beat on bells to overcome the dreariness of  the marshes.    At last the Irusian mountains came in sight, nursing the villages of  Pen-Kai and Blut, and the wandering streets of Mlo, where priests  propitiate the avalanche with wine and maize. Then night came down over  the plains of Tlun, and we saw the lights of Cappadarnia. We heard the  Pathnites beating upon drums as we passed Imaut and Golzunda, then all but  the helmsman slept. And villages scattered along the banks of the Yann  heard all that night in the helmsman's unknown tongue the little songs of  cities that they knew not.    I awoke before dawn with a feeling that I was unhappy before I remembered  why. Then I recalled that by the evening of the approaching day, according  to all foreseen probabilities, we should come to Bar-Wul-Yann, and I  should part from the captain and his sailors. And I had liked the man  because he had given me of his yellow wine that was set apart among his  sacred things, and many a story he had told me about his fair Belzoond  between the Acroctian hills and the Hian Min. And I had liked the ways  that his sailors had, and the prayers "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/813"],[0,"Reminiscences of Tolstoy, (#9)"],[1,"I did not succeed.    That is all that I can remember about this delightful, naively cordial  man, with the childlike eyes and the childlike laugh, and in the picture  my mind preserves of him the memory of his grandeur melts into the charm  of his good nature and simplicity.    In 1883 my father received from Ivan Sergeyevitch his last farewell  letter, written in pencil on his death-bed, and I remember with what  emotion he read it. And when the news of his death came, my father  would talk of nothing else for several days, and inquired everywhere for  details of his illness and last days.    Apropos of this letter of Turgenieff's, I should like to say that my  father was sincerely annoyed, when he heard applied to himself the  epithet \"great writer of the land of Russia,\" which was taken from this  letter.    He always hated cliches, and he regarded this one as quite absurd.    \"Why not 'writer of the land'? I never heard before that a man could  be the writer of a land. People get attached to some nonsensical  expression, and go on repeating it in season and out of season.\"    I have given extracts above from Turgenieff's letters, which show  the invariable consistency with which he lauded my father's literary  talents. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same of my father's attitude  toward Turgenieff.    In this, too, the want of dispassionateness in his nature revealed  itself. Personal relations prevented him from being objective.    In 1867, apropos of Turgenieff's \"Smoke,\" which had just appeared, he  wrote to Fet:      There is hardly any love of anything in \"Smoke\" and hardly any poetry.  The only thing it shows love for is light and playful adultery, and  for that reason the poetry of the story is repulsive. ... I am timid in  expressing this opinion, because I cannot form a sober judgment about an  author whose personality I dislike.    In 1865, before the final breach with Turgenieff, he wrote, again to  Fet: \"I do not like 'Enough'!\" A personal subjective treatment is never  good unless it is full of life and passion; but the subjectivity in this  case is full of lifeless suffering.    In the autumn of 1883, after Turgenieff's death, when the family had  gone into Moscow for the winter, my father stayed at Yasnaya Polyana  alone, with Agafya Mikhailovna, and set earnestly about reading through  all Turgenieff's works.    This is what he wrote to my mother at the time:    I am always thinking about Turgenieff. I am intensely fond of him, and  sorry for him, and do nothing but read him. I live entirely with him.  I shall certainly give a lecture on him, or write it to be read; tell  Yuryef.    \"Enough\"--read it; it is perfectly charming.    Unfortunately, my father's intended lecture on Turgenieff never came  off. The Government forbade him to pay this last tribute to his dead  friend, with whom he had quarreled all his life only because he could  not be indifferent to him.                          (To be continued)            REMINISCENCES OF TOLSTOY (Part III.)    BY HIS SON, COUNT ILYA TOLSTOY    TRANSLATED BY GEORGE CALDERON    AT this point I shall turn back and try to trace the influence which  my father had on my upbringing, and I shall recall as well as I can the  impressions that he left on my mind in my childhood, and later in the  melancholy days of my early manhood, which happened to coincide with the  radical change in his whole philosophy of life.    In 1852, tired of life in the Caucasus and remembering his old home at  Yasnaya Polyana, he wrote to his aunt, Tatyana Alexandrovna:    After some years, I shall find myself, neither very young nor very old,  back at Yasnaya Polyana again: my affairs will all be in order; I shall  have no anxieties for the future and no troubles in the present.    You also will be living at Yasnaya. You will be getting a little old,  but you will be healthy and vigorous. We shall lead the life we led in  the old days; I shall work in the mornings, but we shall meet and see  each other almost all day.    We shall dine together in the evening. I shall read you something that  interests you. Then we shall talk: I shall tell you about my life in the  Caucasus; you will give me reminiscences of my father and mother; you  will tell me some of those \"terrible stories\" to which we used to listen  in the old days with frightened eyes and open mouths.    We shall talk about the people that we loved and who are no more.    You will cry, and I, too; but our tears will be refreshing,  tranquilizing tears. We shall talk about my brothers, who will visit  us from time to time, and about dear Masha, who will also spend several  months every year at Yasnaya, which she loves, with all her children.    We shall have no acquaintances; no one will come in to bore us with  gossip.    It is a wonderful dream; but that is not all that I let myself dream of.     I shall be married.  My wife will be gentle, kind, and  affectionate; she will love you as I do; we shall have children who will  call you granny; you will live in the big house, in the same room on the  top floor where my grandmother lived before.    The whole house will be run on the same lines as it was in my father's  time, and we shall begin the same life over again, but with a change of  roles.      You will take my grandmother's place, but you will be better still than  she was; I shall take my father's place, though I can never hope to be  worthy of the honor.    My wife will take my mother's place, and the children ours.    Masha will fill the part of both my aunts, except for their sorrow;  and there will even be Gasha there to take the place of Prashovya  Ilyinitchna.    The only thing lacking will be some one to take the part you played  in the life of our family. We shall never find such a noble and loving  heart as yours. There is no one to succeed you.    There will be three new faces that will appear among us from time to  time: my brothers, especially one who will often be with us, Nikolenka,  who will be an old bachelor, bald, retired, always the same kindly,  noble fellow.      Just ten years after this letter, my father married, and almost all his  dreams were realized, just as he had wished. Only the big house, with  his grandmother's room, was missing, and his brother Nikolenka, with the  dirty hands, for he died two years before, in 1860. In his family life  my father witnessed a repetition of the life of his parents, and in us  children he sought to find a repetition of himself and his brothers. We  were brought up as regular gentlefolk, proud of our social position and  holding aloof from all the outer world. Everything that was not us was  below us, and therefore unworthy of imitation. I knew that my father  felt very earnestly about the chastity of young people; I knew how much  strength he laid on purity. An early marriage seemed to me the best  solution of the difficult question that must harass every thoughtful boy  when he attains to man's estate.    Two or three years later, when I was eighteen and we were living in  Moscow, I fell in love with a young lady I knew, my present wife, and  went almost every Saturday to her father's house.    My father knew, but said nothing. One day when he was going out for a  walk I asked if I might go with him. As I very seldom went for walks  with him in Moscow, he guessed that I wanted to have a serious talk  with him about something, and after walking some distance in silence,  evidently feeling that I was shy about it and did not like to break the  ice, he suddenly began:    \"You seem to go pretty often to the F----s'.\"    I said that I was very fond of the eldest daughter.    \"Oh, do you want to marry her?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Is she a good girl? Well, mind you don't make a mistake, and don't be  false to her,\" he said with a curious gentleness and thoughtfulness.    I left him at once and ran back home, delighted, along the Arbat. I was  glad that I had told him the truth, and his affectionate and cautious  way of taking it strengthened my affection both for him, to whom I was  boundlessly grateful for his cordiality, and for her, whom I loved  still more warmly from that moment, and to whom I resolved still more  fervently never to be untrue.    My father's tactfulness toward us amounted almost to timidity. There  were certain questions which he could never bring himself to touch on  for fear of causing us pain. I shall never forget how once in Moscow  I found him sitting writing at the table in my room when I dashed in  suddenly to change my clothes.    My bed stood behind a screen, which hid him from me.    When he heard my footsteps he said, without looking round:    \"Is that you, Ilya?\"    \"Yes, it's I.\"    \"Are you alone? Shut the door. There's no one to hear us, and we can't  see each other, so we shall not feel ashamed. Tell me, did you ever have  anything to do with women?\"    When I said no, I suddenly heard him break out sobbing, like a little  child.    I sobbed and cried, too, and for a long time we stayed weeping tears of  joy, with the screen between us, and we were neither of us ashamed, but  both so joyful that I look on that moment as one of the happiest in my  whole life.    No arguments or homilies could ever have effected what the emotion I  experienced at that moment did. Such tears as those shed by a father  of sixty can never be forgotten even in moments of the strongest  temptation.    My father observed my inward life most attentively between the ages of  sixteen and twenty, noted all my doubts and hesitations, encouraged me  in my good impulses, and often found fault with me for inconsistency.    I still have some of his letters written at that time. Here are two:      I had just written you, my dear friend Ilya, a letter that was true to  my own feelings, but, I am afraid, unjust, and I am not sending it. I  said unpleasant things in it, but I have no right to do so. I do not  know you as I should like to and as I ought to know "]]]
