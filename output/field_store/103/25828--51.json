Fishing boats went white-winged down the channel in the  mornings, and returned laden in the evenings.  Sailors and fisher-folk  travelled the red, winding harbor roads, light-hearted and content.  There was always a certain sense of things going to happen--of  adventures and farings-forth.  The ways of Four Winds were less staid  and settled and grooved than those of Avonlea; winds of change blew  over them; the sea called ever to the dwellers on shore, and even those  who might not answer its call felt the thrill and unrest and mystery  and possibilities of it.    \"I understand now why some men must go to sea,\" said Anne.  \"That  desire which comes to us all at times--'to sail beyond the bourne of  sunset'--must be very imperious when it is born in you.  I don't wonder  Captain Jim ran away because of it.  I never see a ship sailing out of  the channel, or a gull soaring over the sand-bar, without wishing I  were on board the ship or had wings, not like a dove 'to fly away and  be at rest,' but like a gull, to sweep out into the very heart of a  storm.\"    \"You'll stay right here with me, Anne-girl,\" said Gilbert lazily.  \"I  won't have you flying away from me into the hearts of storms.\"    They were sitting on their red sand-stone doorstep in the late  afternoon.  Great tranquillities were all about them in land and sea  and sky.  Silvery gulls were soaring over them.  The horizons were  laced with long trails of frail, pinkish clouds.  The hushed air was  threaded with a murmurous refrain of minstrel winds and waves.  Pale  asters were blowing in the sere and misty meadows between them and the  harbor.    \"Doctors who have to be up all night waiting on sick folk don't feel  very adventurous, I suppose,\" Anne said indulgently.  \"If you had had a  good sleep last night, Gilbert, you'd be as ready as I am for a flight  of imagination.\"    \"I did good work last night, Anne,\" said Gilbert quietly.  \"Under God,  I saved a life.  This is the first time I could ever really claim that.  In other cases I may have helped; but, Anne, if I had not stayed at  Allonby's last night and fought death hand to hand, that woman would  have died before morning.  I tried an experiment that was certainly  never tried in Four Winds before.  I doubt if it was ever tried  anywhere before outside of a hospital.  It was a new thing in Kingsport  hospital last winter.  I could never have dared try it here if I had  not been absolutely certain that there was no other chance.  I risked  it--and it succeeded.  As a result, a good wife and mother is saved for  long years of happiness and usefulness.  As I drove home this morning,  while the sun was rising over the harbor, I thanked God that I had  chosen the profession I did.  I had fought a good fight and won--think  of it, Anne, WON, against the Great Destroyer.  It's what I dreamed of  doing long ago when we talked together of what we wanted to do in life.  That dream of mine came true this morning.\"    \"Was that the only one of your dreams that has come true?\" asked Anne,  who knew perfectly well what the substance of his answer would be, but  wanted to hear it again.    \"YOU know, Anne-girl,\" said Gilbert, smiling into her eyes.  At that  moment there were certainly two perfectly happy people sitting on the  doorstep of a little white house on the Four Winds Harbor shore.    Presently Gilbert said, with a change of tone, \"Do I or do I not see a  full-rigged ship sailing up our lane?\"    Anne looked and sprang up.    \"That must be either Miss Cornelia Bryant or Mrs. Moore coming to  call,\" she said.    \"I'm going into the office, and if it is Miss Cornelia I warn you that  I'll eavesdrop,\" said Gilbert.  \"From all I've heard regarding Miss  Cornelia I conclude that her conversation will not be dull, to say the  least.\"    \"It may be Mrs. Moore.\"    \"I don't think Mrs. Moore is built on those lines.  I saw her working  in her garden the other day, and, though I was too far away to see  clearly, I thought she was rather slender.  She doesn't seem very  socially inclined when she has never called on you yet, although she's  your nearest neighbor.\"    \"She can't be like Mrs. Lynde, after all, or curiosity would have  brought her,\" said Anne.  \"This caller is, I think, Miss Cornelia.\"    Miss Cornelia it was; moreover, Miss Cornelia had not come to make any  brief and fashionable wedding call.  She had her work under her arm in  a substantial parcel, and when Anne asked her to stay she promptly took  off her capacious sun-hat, which had been held on her head, despite  irreverent September breezes, by a tight elastic band under her hard  little knob of fair hair.  No hat pins for Miss Cornelia, an it please  ye!  Elastic bands had been good enough for her mother and they were  good enough for HER.  She had a fresh, round, pink-and-white face, and  jolly brown eyes.  She did not look in the least like the traditional  old maid, and there was something in her expression which won Anne  instantly.  With her old instinctive quickness to discern kindred  spirits she knew she was going to like Miss Cornelia, in spite of  uncertain oddities of opinion, and certain oddities of attire.    Nobody but Miss Cornelia would have come to make a call arrayed in a  striped blue-and-white apron and a wrapper of chocolate print, with a  design of huge, pink roses scattered over it.  And nobody but Miss  Cornelia could have looked dignified and suitably garbed in it.  Had  Miss Cornelia been entering a palace to call on a prince's bride, she  would have been just as dignified and just as wholly mistress of the  situation.  She would have trailed her rose-spattered flounce over the  marble floors just as unconcernedly, and she would have proceeded just  as calmly to disabuse the mind of the princess of any idea that the  possession of a mere man, be he prince or peasant, was anything to brag  of.    \"I've brought my work, Mrs. Blythe, dearie,\" she remarked, unrolling  some dainty material.  \"I'm in a hurry to get this done, and there  isn't any time to lose.\"    Anne looked in some surprise at the white garment spread over Miss  Cornelia's ample lap.  It was certainly a baby's dress, and it was most  beautifully made, with tiny frills and tucks.  Miss Cornelia adjusted  her glasses and fell to embroidering with exquisite stitches.    \"This is for Mrs. Fred Proctor up at the Glen,\" she announced.  \"She's  expecting her eighth baby any day now, and not a stitch has she ready  for it.  The other seven have wore out all she made for the first, and  she's never had time or strength or spirit to make any more.  That  woman is a martyr, Mrs. Blythe, believe ME.  When she married Fred  Proctor _I_ knew how it would turn out.  He was one of your wicked,  fascinating men.  After he got married he left off being fascinating  and just kept on being wicked.  He drinks and he neglects his family.  Isn't that like a man?  I don't know how Mrs. Proctor would ever keep  her children decently clothed if her neighbors didn't help her out.\"    As Anne was afterwards to learn, Miss Cornelia was the only neighbor  who troubled herself much about the decency of the young Proctors.    \"When I heard this eighth baby was coming I decided to make some things  for it,\" Miss Cornelia went on.  \"This is the last and I want to finish  it today.\"    \"It's certainly very pretty,\" said Anne.  \"I'll get my sewing and we'll  have a little thimble party of two.  You are a beautiful sewer, Miss  Bryant.\"    \"Yes, I'm the best sewer in these parts,\" said Miss Cornelia in a  matter-of-fact tone.  \"I ought to be!  Lord, I've done more of it than  if I'd had a hundred children of my own, believe ME!  I s'pose I'm a  fool, to be putting hand embroidery on this dress for an eighth baby.  But, Lord, Mrs. Blythe, dearie, it isn't to blame for being the eighth,  and I kind of wished it to have one real pretty dress, just as if it  WAS wanted.  Nobody's wanting the poor mite--so I put some extra fuss  on its little things just on that account.\"    \"Any baby might be proud of that dress,\" said Anne, feeling still more  strongly that she was going to like Miss Cornelia.    \"I s'pose you've been thinking I was never coming to call on you,\"  resumed Miss Cornelia.  \"But this is harvest month, you know, and I've  been busy--and a lot of extra hands hanging round, eating more'n they  work, just like the men.  I'd have come yesterday, but I went to Mrs.  Roderick MacAllister's funeral.  At first I thought my head was aching  so badly I couldn't enjoy myself if I did go.  But she was a hundred  years old, and I'd always promised myself that I'd go to her funeral.\"    \"Was it a successful function?\" asked Anne, noticing that the office  door was ajar.    \"What's that?  Oh, yes, it was a tremendous funeral.  She had a very  large connection.  There was over one hundred and twenty carriages in  the procession.  There was one or two funny things happened.  I thought  that die I would to see old Joe Bradshaw, who is an infidel and never  darkens the door of a church, singing 'Safe in the Arms of Jesus' with  great gusto and fervor.  He glories in singing--that's why he never  misses a funeral.  Poor Mrs. Bradshaw didn't look much like  singing--all wore out slaving.  Old Joe starts out once in a while to  buy her a present and brings home some new kind of farm machinery.  Isn't that like a man?  But what else would you expect of a man who  never goes to church, even a Methodist one?  I was real thankful to see  you and the young Doctor in the Presbyterian church your first Sunday.  No doctor for me who isn't a Presbyterian.\"    \"We were in the Methodist church last Sunday evening,\" said Anne  wickedly.    \"Oh, I s'pose Dr. Blythe has to go to the Methodist church once in a  while or he wouldn't get the Methodist practice.\"    \"We liked the sermon very much,\" declared Anne boldly.  \"And I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5449"],[0,"Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Complete (#9)"],[1," perhaps crush us, if we do not,  while there is yet time, inflexibly oppose them?\"    \"Thou bringest sand to the desert, and sugar to sprinkle over honey,\"  exclaimed Gagabu, and his lips began to twitch. \"Nothing is now as it  ought to be, and there will be a hard battle to fight; not with the  sword, but with this--and this.\" And the impatient man touched his  forehead and his lips. \"And who is there more competent than my  disciple? There is the champion of our cause, a second cap of Hor, that  overthrew the evil one with winged sunbeams, and you come and would  clip his wings and blunt his claws! Alas, alas, my lords! will you  never understand that a lion roars louder than a cat, and the sun shines  brighter than an oil-lamp? Let Pentuar alone, I say; or you will do as  the man did, who, for fear of the toothache, had his sound teeth drawn.  Alas, alas, in the years to come we shall have to bite deep into  the flesh, till the blood flows, if we wish to escape being eaten up  ourselves!\"    \"The enemy is not unknown to us also,\" said the elder priest from  Chennu, \"although we, on the remote southern frontier of the kingdom,  have escaped many evils that in the north have eaten into our body like  a cancer. Here foreigners are now hardly looked upon at all as  unclean and devilish.\"--[\"Typhonisch,\" belonging to Typhon or  Seth.--Translator.]    \"Hardly?\" exclaimed the chief of the haruspices; \"they are invited,  caressed, and honored. Like dust, when the simoon blows through the  chinks of a wooden house, they crowd into the houses and temples, taint  our manners and language;       [At no period Egyptian writers use more Semitic words than during     the reigns of Rameses II. and his son Mernephtah.]    nay, on the throne of the successors of Ra sits a descendant--\"    \"Presumptuous man!\" cried the voice of the high-priest, who at this  instant entered the hall, \"Hold your tongue, and be not so bold as  to wag it against him who is our king, and wields the sceptre in this  kingdom as the Vicar of Ra.\"    The speaker bowed and was silent, then he and all the company rose to  greet Ameni, who bowed to them all with polite dignity, took his seat,  and turning to Gagabu asked him carelessly:    \"I find you all in most unpriestly excitement; what has disturbed your  equanimity?\"    \"We were discussing the overwhelming influx of foreigners into Egypt,  and the necessity of opposing some resistance to them.\"    \"You will find me one of the foremost in the attempt,\" replied Ameni.  \"We have endured much already, and news has arrived from the north,  which grieves me deeply.\"    \"Have our troops sustained a defeat?\"    \"They continue to be victorious, but thousands of our countrymen have  fallen victims in the fight or on the march. Rameses demands fresh  reinforcements. The pioneer, Paaker, has brought me a letter from our  brethren who accompany the king, and delivered a document from him  to the Regent, which contains the order to send to him fifty thousand  fighting men: and as the whole of the soldier-caste and all the  auxiliaries are already under arms, the bondmen of the temple, who till  our acres, are to be levied, and sent into Asia.\"    A murmur of disapproval arose at these words. The chief of the  haruspices stamped his foot, and Gagabu asked:    \"What do you mean to do?\"    \"To prepare to obey the commands of the king,\" answered Ameni, \"and to  call the heads of the temples of the city of Anion here without delay to  hold a council. Each must first in his holy of holies seek good counsel  of the Celestials. When we have come to a conclusion, we must next win  the Viceroy over to our side. Who yesterday assisted at his prayers?\"    \"It was my turn,\" said the chief of the haruspices.    \"Follow me to my abode, when the meal is over.\" commanded Ameni. \"But  why is our poet missing from our circle?\"    At this moment Pentaur came into the hall, and while he bowed easily and  with dignity to the company and low before Ameni, he prayed him to grant  that the pastophorus Teta should accompany the leech Nebsecht to visit  the daughter of the paraschites.    Ameni nodded consent and exclaimed: \"They must make haste. Paaker waits  for them at the great gate, and will accompany them in my chariot.\"    As soon as Pentaur had left the party of feasters, the old priest from  Chennu exclaimed, as he turned to Ameni:    \"Indeed, holy father, just such a one and no other had I pictured your  poet. He is like the Sun-god, and his demeanor is that of a prince. He  is no doubt of noble birth.\"    \"His father is a homely gardener,\" said the highpriest, \"who indeed  tills the land apportioned to him with industry and prudence, but is  of humble birth and rough exterior. He sent Pentaur to the school at an  early age, and we have brought up the wonderfully gifted boy to be what  he now is.\"    \"What office does he fill here in the temple?\"    \"He instructs the elder pupils of the high-school in grammar and  eloquence; he is also an excellent observer of the starry heavens, and  a most skilled interpreter of dreams,\" replied Gagabu. \"But here he is  again. To whom is Paaker conducting our stammering physician and his  assistant?\"    \"To the daughter of the paraschites, who has been run over,\" answered  Pentaur. \"But what a rough fellow this pioneer is. His voice hurts my  ears, and he spoke to our leeches as if they had been his slaves.\"    \"He was vexed with the commission the princess had devolved on him,\"  said the high-priest benevolently, \"and his unamiable disposition is  hardly mitigated by his real piety.\"    \"And yet,\" said an old priest, \"his brother, who left us some years  ago, and who had chosen me for his guide and teacher, was a particularly  loveable and docile youth.\"    \"And his father,\" said Ameni, \"was one of the most superior energetic,  and withal subtle-minded of men.\"    \"Then he has derived his bad peculiarities from his mother?\"    \"By no means. She is a timid, amiable, soft-hearted woman.\"    \"But must the child always resemble its parents?\" asked Pentaur. \"Among  the sons of the sacred bull, sometimes not one bears the distinguishing  mark of his father.\"    \"And if Paaker's father were indeed an Apis,\" Gagabu laughing,  \"according to your view the pioneer himself belongs, alas! to the  peasant's stable.\"    Pentaur did not contradict him, but said with a smile:    \"Since he left the school bench, where his school-fellows called him the  wild ass on account of his unruliness, he has remained always the same.  He was stronger than most of them, and yet they knew no greater pleasure  than putting him in a rage.\"    \"Children are so cruel!\" said Ameni. \"They judge only by appearances,  and never enquire into the causes of them. The deficient are as guilty  in their eyes as the idle, and Paaker could put forward small claims  to their indulgence. I encourage freedom and merriment,\" he continued  turning to the priests from Cheraw, \"among our disciples, for in  fettering the fresh enjoyment of youth we lame our best assistant. The  excrescences on the natural growth of boys cannot be more surely or  painlessly extirpated than in their wild games. The school-boy is the  school-boy's best tutor.\"    \"But Paaker,\" said the priest Meriapu, \"was not improved by the  provocations of his companions. Constant contests with them increased  that roughness which now makes him the terror of his subordinates and  alienates all affection.\"    \"He is the most unhappy of all the many youths, who were intrusted to my  care,\" said Ameni, \"and I believe I know why,--he never had a childlike  disposition, even when in years he was still a child, and the Gods had  denied him the heavenly gift of good humor. Youth should be modest, and  he was assertive from his childhood. He took the sport of his companions  for earnest, and his father, who was unwise only as a tutor, encouraged  him to resistance instead of to forbearance, in the idea that he thus  would be steeled to the hard life of a Mohar.\"       [The severe duties of the Mohar are well known from the papyrus of     Anastasi I. in the Brit. Mus., which has been ably treated by F.     Chabas, Voyage d'un Egyptien.]    \"I have often heard the deeds of the Mohar spoken of,\" said the old  priest from Chennu, \"yet I do not exactly know what his office requires  of him.\"    \"He has to wander among the ignorant and insolent people of hostile  provinces, and to inform himself of the kind and number of the  population, to investigate the direction of the mountains, valleys, and  rivers, to set forth his observations, and to deliver them to the house  of war,       [Corresponding to our minister of war. A person of the highest     importance even in the earliest times.]    so that the march of the troops may be guided by them.\"    \"The Mohar then must be equally skilled as a warrior and as a Scribe.\"    \"As thou sayest; and Paaker's father was not a hero only, but at the  same time a writer, whose close and clear information depicted the  country through which he had travelled as plainly as if it were seen  from a mountain height. He was the first who took the title of Mohar.  The king held him in such high esteem, that he was inferior to no one  but the king himself, and the minister of the house of war.\"    \"Was he of noble race?\"    \"Of one of the oldest and noblest in the country. His father was the  noble warrior Assa,\" answered the haruspex, \"and he therefore, after he  himself had attained the highest consideration and vast wealth, escorted  home the niece of the King Hor-em-lieb, who would have had a claim to  the throne, as well as the Regent, if the grandfather of the present  Rameses had not seized it from the old family by violence.\"    \"Be careful of your words,\" said Ameni, interrupting the rash old man.  \"Rameses I. was and is the grandfather of our sovereign, and in the  king's veins, from his mother's side, flows the blood of the legitimate  descendants of "]]]
