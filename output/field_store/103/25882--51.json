It  was possible to number them only by killing them and counting the  corpses. What wonder that all men should avoid the open plains,  that are the kingdom of such a scourge.    Yet it must not be thought that the whole country is similarly and  evenly filled. There can be no doubt that they flock and fly to  the big moving creatures they see or smell. Maybe we had gathered  the whole mosquito product of many acres. This is shown by the  facts that if one rushes through thick bushes for a distance, into  a clear space, the mosquitoes seem absent at first. One must wait  a minute or so to gather up another legion. When landing from a  boat on the Northern Lakes there are comparatively few, but even  in a high wind, a walk to the nearest hilltop results in one again  moving in a cloud of tormentors. Does not this readiness to assemble  at a bait suggest a possible means of destroying them?    Every one, even the seasoned natives, agree that they are a terror  to man and beast; but, thanks to our flyproof tents, we sleep immune.  During the day I wear my net and gloves, uncomfortably hot, but a  blessed relief from the torment. It is easy to get used to those  coverings; it is impossible to get used to the mosquitoes.    For July 10 I find this note: \"The Mosquitoes are worse now than  ever before; even Jarvis, Preble, and the Indians are wearing face  protectors of some kind. The Major has borrowed Preble's closed net,  much to the latter's discomfiture, as he himself would be glad to  wear it.\"    This country has, for 6 months, the finest climate in the world,  but 2 1/2 of these are ruined by the malignancy of the fly plague.  Yet it is certain that knowledge will confer on man the power to  wipe them out.    No doubt the first step in this direction is a thorough understanding  of the creature's life-history. This understanding many able mien  are working for. But there is another line of thought that should  not be forgotten, though it is negative--many animals are immune.  Which are they? Our first business is to list them if we would  learn the why of immunity.    Frogs are among the happy ones. One day early in June I took a  wood-frog in my hand. The mosquitoes swarmed about. In a few seconds  30 were on my hand digging away; 10 were on my forefinger, 8 on my  thumb; between these was the frog, a creature with many resemblances  to man--red blood, a smooth, naked, soft skin, etc.--and yet not a  mosquito attacked it. Scores had bled my hand before one alighted  on the frog, and it leaped off again as though the creature were  red hot. The experiment repeated with another frog gave the same  result. Why? It can hardly be because the frog is cold-blooded,  for many birds also seem, to be immune, and their blood is warmer  than man's.    Next, I took a live frog and rubbed it on my hand over an area  marked out with lead pencil; at first the place was wet, but in a  few seconds dry and rather shiny. I held up my hand till 50 mosquitoes  had alighted on it and begun to bore; of these, 4 alighted on the  froggy place, 3 at once tumbled off in haste, but one, No. 32, did  sting me there. I put my tongue to the frog's back; it was slightly  bitter.    I took a black-gilled fungus from a manure pile to-day, rubbed a  small area, and held my hand bare till 50 mosquitoes had settled  and begun to sting; 7 of these alighted on the fungus juice, but  moved off at once, except the last; it stung, but at that time the  juice was dry.    Many other creatures, including some birds, enjoy immunity, but  I note that mosquitoes did attack a dead crane; also they swarmed  onto a widgeon plucked while yet warm, and bored in deep; but I  did not see any filling with blood.    There is another kind of immunity that is equally important and  obscure. In the summer of 1904, Dr. Clinton L. Bagg, of New York,  went to Newfoundland for a fishing trip. The Codroy country was,  as usual, plagued with mosquitoes, but as soon as the party crossed  into the Garnish River Valley, a land of woods and swamps like the  other, the mosquitoes had disappeared. Dr. Bagg spent the month of  August there, and found no use for nets, dopes, or other means of  fighting winged pests; there were none. What the secret was no one  at present knows, but it would be a priceless thing to find.    Now, lest I should do injustice to the Northland that will some  day be an empire peopled with white men, let me say that there are  three belts of mosquito country the Barren Grounds, where they are  worst and endure for 2 1/2 months; the spruce forest, where they  are bad and continue for 2 months, and the great arable region of  wheat, that takes in Athabaska and Saskatchewan, where the flies  are a nuisance for 6 or 7 weeks, but no more so than they were in  Ontario, Michigan, Manitoba, and formerly England; and where the  cultivation of the land will soon reduce them to insignificance,  as it has invariably done in other similar regions. It is quite  remarkable in the north-west that such plagues are most numerous  in the more remote regions, and they disappear in proportion as  the country is opened up and settled.    Finally, it is a relief to know that these mosquitoes convey no  disease--even the far-spread malaria is unknown in the region.    Why did I not take a \"dope\" or  \"fly repellent,\" ask many of my  friends.    In answer I can only say I have never before been where mosquitoes  were bad enough to need one. I had had no experience with fly-dope.  I had heard that they are not very effectual, and so did not add  one to the outfit. I can say now it was a mistake to leave any means  untried. Next time I carry \"dope.\" The following recipe is highly  recommended:      Pennyroyal,      one part,  Oil of Tar,         \"   \"  Spirits of Camphor, \"   \"  Sweet Oil, or else vaseline, three parts.      Their natural enemies are numerous; most small birds prey on them;  dragon-flies also, and the latter alone inspire fear in the pests.  When a dragon-fly comes buzzing about one's head the mosquitoes  move away to the other side, but it makes no considerable difference.    On Buffalo River I saw a boatman or water-spider seize, and devour  a mosquito that fell within reach; which is encouraging, because,  as a rule, the smaller the foe, the deadlier, and the only creature  that really affects the whole mosquito nation is apparently a small  red parasite that became more and more numerous as the season wore  on. It appeared in red lumps on the bill and various parts of the  stinger's body, and the victim became very sluggish. Specimens  sent to Dr. L. 0. Howard, the authority on mosquitoes, elicited  the information that it was a fungus, probably new to science.  But evidently it is deadly to the Culex. More power to it, and the  cause it represents; we cannot pray too much for its increase.    Now to sum up: after considering the vastness of the region  affected--three-quarters of the globe--and the number of diseases  these insects communicate, one is inclined to say that it might be  a greater boon to mankind to extirpate the mosquito than to stamp  out tuberculosis. The latter means death to a considerable proportion  of our race, the former means hopeless suffering to all mankind;  one takes off each year its toll of the weaklings the other spares  none, and in the far north at least has made a hell on earth of  the land that for six months of each year might be a human Paradise.          CHAPTER X    A BAD CASE        My unsought fame as a medicine man continued to grow. One morning  I heard a white voice outside asking, \"Is the doctor in?\" Billy  replied: \"Mr. Seton is inside.\" On going forth I met a young American  who thus introduced himself: \"My name is Y------, from Michigan.  I was a student at Ann Arbor when you lectured there in 1903. 1  don't suppose you remember me; I was one of the reception committee;  but I'm mighty glad to meet you out here.\"    After cordial greetings he held up his arm to explain the call and  said: \"I'm in a pretty bad way.\"    \"Let's see.\"    He unwound the bandage and showed a hand and arm swollen out of all  shape, twice the natural size, and of a singular dropsical pallor.    \"Have you any pain?\"    \"I can't sleep from the torture of it.\"    \"Where does it hurt now?\"    \"In the hand.\"    \"How did you get it?\"    \"It seemed to come on after a hard crossing of Lake Athabaska. We  had to row all night.\"    I asked one or two more questions, really to hide my puzzlement.  \"What in the world is it?\" I said to myself; \"all so fat and puffy.\"  I cudgelled my brain for a clue. As I examined the hand in silence  to play for time and conceal my ignorance, he went on:    \"What I'm afraid of is blood-poisoning. I couldn't get out to a  doctor before a month, and by that time I'll be one-armed or dead.  I know which I'd prefer.\"    Knowing, at all events, that nothing but evil could come of fear,  I said: \"Now see here. You can put that clean out of your mind.  You never saw blood-poisoning that colour, did you?\"    \"That's so,\" and he seemed intensely relieved.    While I was thus keeping up an air of omniscience by saying nothing,  Major Jarvis came up.    \"Look at this, Jarvis,\" said I; \"isn't it a bad one?    \"Phew,\" said the Major, \"that's the worst felon I ever saw.\"    Like a gleam from heaven came the word felon. That's what it was,  a felon or whitlow, and again I breathed freely. Turning to the  patient with my most cock-sure professional air, I said:    \"Now see, Y., you needn't worry; you've hurt your finger in  rowing, and the injury was deep and has set up a felon. It is not  yet headed up enough; as soon as it is I'll lance it, unless it  bursts of itself (and inwardly I prayed it might burst). Can you  get any linseed meal or bran?\"    \"Afraid not.\"    \"Well, then, get some clean rags"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6840"],[0,"Queen Lucia (#9)"],[1,"   But every now and then--and tonight was one of those occasions--there  occurred evenings when he never went out to dinner even if he was  asked, because he \"was busy indoors.\" They occurred about once a month  (these evenings that he was \"busy indoors\")--and even an invitation  from Lucia would not succeed in disturbing them. Ages ago Riseholme had  decided what made Georgie \"busy indoors\" once a month, and so none of  his friends chatted about the nature of his engagements to anyone else,  simply because everybody else knew. His business indoors, in fact, was  a perfect secret, from having been public property for so long.    June had been a very busy time, not \"indoors,\" but with other  engagements, and as Georgie went up to his bedroom, having been told by  Foljambe that the hair-dresser was waiting for him, and had been  waiting \"this last ten minutes,\" he glanced at his hair in the  Cromwellian mirror that hung on the stairs, and was quite aware that it  was time he submitted himself to Mr Holroyd's ministrations. There was  certainly an undergrowth of grey hair visible beneath his chestnut  crop, that should have been attended to at least a fortnight ago. Also  there was a growing thinness in the locks that crossed his head; Mr  Holroyd had attended to that before, and had suggested a certain  remedy, not in the least inconvenient, unless Georgie proposed to be  athletic without a cap, in a high wind, and even then not necessarily  so. But as he had no intention of being athletic anywhere, with or  without a cap, he determined as he went up the stairs that he would  follow Mr Holroyd's advice. Mr Holroyd's procedure, without this added  formula, entailed sitting \"till it dried,\" and after that he would have  dinner, and then Mr Holroyd would begin again. He was a very clever  person with regard to the face and the hands and the feet. Georgie had  been conscious of walking a little lamely lately; he had been even more  conscious of the need of hot towels on his face and the \"tap-tap\" of Mr  Holroyd's fingers, and the stretchings of Mr Holroyd's thumb across  rather slack surfaces of cheek and chin. In the interval between the  hair and the face, Mr Holroyd should have a good supper downstairs with  Foljambe and the cook. And tomorrow morning, when he met Hermy and  Ursy, Georgie would be just as spick and span and young as ever, if not  more so.    Georgie (happy innocent!) was completely unaware that the whole of  Riseholme knew that the smooth chestnut locks which covered the top of  his head, were trained like the tendrils of a grapevine from the roots,  and flowed like a river over a bare head, and consequently when Mr  Holroyd explained the proposed innovation, a little central wig, the  edges of which would mingle in the most natural manner with his own  hair, it seemed to Georgie that nobody would know the difference. In  addition he would be spared those risky moments when he had to take off  his hat to a friend in a high wind, for there was always the danger of  his hair blowing away from the top of his head, and hanging down, like  the tresses of a Rhine-maiden over one shoulder. So Mr Holroyd was  commissioned to put that little affair in hand at once, and when the  greyness had been attended to, and Georgie had had his dinner, there  came hot towels and tappings on his face, and other ministrations. All  was done about half past ten, and when he came downstairs again for a  short practice at the bass part of Beethoven's fifth symphony,  ingeniously arranged for two performers on the piano, he looked with  sincere satisfaction at his rosy face in the Cromwellian mirror, and  his shoes felt quite comfortable again, and his nails shone like pink  stars, as his hands dashed wildly about the piano in the quicker  passages. But all the time the thought of the Guru next door, under  whose tuition he might be able to regain his youth without recourse to  those expensive subterfuges (for the price of the undetectable  _toupet_ astonished him) rang in his head with a melody more  haunting than Beethoven's. What he would have liked best of all would  have been to have the Guru all to himself, so that he should remain  perpetually young, while all the rest of Riseholme, including Hermy and  Ursy, grew old. Then, indeed, he would be king of the place, instead of  serving the interests of its queen.    He rose with a little sigh, and after adjusting the strip of flannel  over the keys, shut his piano and busied himself for a little with a  soft duster over his cabinet of bibelots which not even Foljambe was  allowed to touch. It was generally understood that he had inherited  them, though the inheritance had chiefly passed to him through the  medium of curiosity shops, and there were several pieces of  considerable value among them. There were a gold Louis XVI snuff box, a  miniature by Karl Huth, a silver toy porringer of the time of Queen  Anne, a piece of Bow china, an enamelled cigarette case by Faberge. But  tonight his handling of them was not so dainty and delicate as usual,  and he actually dropped the porringer on the floor as he was dusting  it, for his mind still occupied itself with the Guru and the practices  that led to permanent youth. How quick Lucia had been to snap him up  for her garden-party. Yet perhaps she would not get him, for he might  say he was not sent. But surely he would be sent to Georgie, whom he  knew, the moment he set eyes on him to have a clean white soul....    The clock struck eleven, and, as usual on warm nights Georgie opened  the glass door into his garden and drew in a breath of the night air.  There was a slip of moon in the sky which he most punctiliously  saluted, wondering (though he did not seriously believe in its  superstition) how Lucia could be so foolhardy as to cut the new moon.  She had seen it yesterday, she told him, in London, and had taken no  notice whatever of it.... The heavens were quickly peppered with pretty  stars, which Georgie after his busy interesting day enjoyed looking at,  though if he had had the arrangement of them, he would certainly have  put them into more definite patterns. Among them was a very red planet,  and Georgie with recollections of his classical education, easily  remembered that Mars, the God of War, was symbolized in the heavens by  a red star. Could that mean anything to peaceful Riseholme? Was  internal warfare, were revolutionary movements possible in so serene a  realm?          Chapter FOUR      Pink irascible Robert, prone to throw his food about his plate, if it  did not commend itself to him, felt in an extremely good natured mood  that same night after dinner, for the Guru had again made a visit to  the kitchen with the result that instead of a slab of pale dead codfish  being put before him after he had eaten some tepid soup, there appeared  a delicious little fish-curry. The Guru had behaved with great tact; he  had seen the storm gathering on poor Robert's face, as he sipped the  cool effete concoction and put down his spoon again with a splash in  his soup plate, and thereupon had bowed and smiled and scurried away to  the kitchen to intercept the next abomination. Then returning with the  little curry he explained that it was entirely for Robert, since those  who sought the Way did not indulge in hot sharp foods, and so he had  gobbled it up to the very last morsel.    In consequence when the Guru salaamed very humbly, and said that with  gracious permission of beloved lady and kind master he would go and  meditate in his room, and had shambled away in his red slippers, the  discussion which Robert had felt himself obliged to open with his wife,  on the subject of having an unknown Indian staying with them for an  indefinite period, was opened in a much more amicable key than it would  have been on a slice of codfish.    \"Well, now, about this Golliwog--haha--I should say Guru, my dear,\" he  began, \"what's going to happen?\"    Daisy Quantock drew in her breath sharply and winced at this  irreverence, but quickly remembered that she must always be sending out  messages of love, north, east, south, and west. So she sent a rather  spiky one in the direction of her husband who was sitting due east, so  that it probably got to him at once, and smiled the particular hard  firm smile which was an heirloom inherited from her last rule of life.    \"No one knows,\" she said brightly. \"Even the Guides can't tell where  and when a Guru may be called.\"    \"Then do you propose he should stop here till he's called somewhere  else?\"    She continued smiling.    \"I don't propose anything,\" she said. \"It's not in my hands.\"    Under the calming influence of the fish curry, Robert remained still  placid.    \"He's a first-rate cook anyhow,\" he said. \"Can't you engage him as  that? Call to the kitchen, you know.\"    \"Darling!\" said Mrs Quantock, sending out more love. But she had a  quick temper, and indeed the two were outpoured together, like hot and  cold taps turned on in a bath. The pellucid stream of love served to  keep her temper moderately cool.    \"Well, ask him,\" suggested Mr Quantock, \"as you say, you never can tell  where a Guru may be called. Give him forty pounds a year and beer  money.\"    \"Beer!\" began Mrs Quantock, when she suddenly remembered Georgie's  story about Rush and the Guru and the brandy-bottle, and stopped.    \"Yes, dear, I said 'beer,'\" remarked Robert a little irritably, \"and in  any case I insist that you dismiss your present cook. You only took her  because she was a Christian Scientist, and you've left that little  sheep-fold now. You used to talk about false claims I remember. Well  her claim to be a cook is the falsest I ever heard of. I'd sooner take  my chance with an itinerant organ grinder. But that fish-curry tonight  and that other thing last night, that's what I mean by good eating.\"    The thought even of good food always calmed Robert's savage breast; it  blew upon him as the"]]]
