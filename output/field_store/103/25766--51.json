GUARDING THE COMMUNICATIONS--LORDS METHUEN AND KITCHENER    While the battle for the Delagoa railway line was being planned, Lord  Kitchener, with a small force, pushed south and joined Lord Methuen  (whose force was at Heilbron) at Vredefort station on the evening of the  10th of June. Together they decided to hunt the marauders.    In passing, it is interesting to note that at this time the following  militia corps were doing unostentatious but valuable and perilous service  on the lines of communication:--         3rd Royal Scots; 3rd Royal West Surrey; 3rd East Kent; 3rd       Royal Lancaster; 4th Royal Lancaster; 6th Royal Warwickshire;       3rd Norfolk; 4th Somerset Light Infantry; 4th West Yorkshire;       4th Bedfordshire; 3rd Yorkshire; 6th Lancashire Fusiliers; 4th       Cheshire; 3rd South Wales Borderers; 3rd King's Own Scottish       Borderers; 4th Scottish Rifles; 3rd East Lancashire; 4th East       Surrey; 4th South Staffordshire; 3rd South Lancashire; 3rd       Welsh; 4th Derbyshire; 6th Middlesex; 9th King's Royal Rifles       (North Cork Militia); 4th North Staffordshire; 3rd Durham Light       Infantry; 4th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders; 3rd Leinster;       5th Royal Munster Fusiliers; 5th Royal Dublin Fusiliers.    On the 11th Lord Methuen proceeded to scour the railway line, and found  the enemy prowling within rifle range on either side of his route.  Whereupon, at Rhenoster River, he overtook and engaged De Wet, over whom  a temporary victory was gained. The British commander succeeded in  capturing camp and etceteras, and scattering the Dutchmen in all  directions, though De Wet himself, with his usual nimbleness,  disappeared. During the day's engagement Lieutenant Erle, 12th Battalion  Imperial Yeomanry, was slightly wounded.    On Tuesday the 12th the force hurriedly advanced towards Kroonstad, owing  to a report that that town, garrisoned by a single battalion of the  Argyll and Sutherland Militia, had fallen a prey to the enemy.  Fortunately it was discovered that the rumour was groundless, and Lord  Methuen continued his southern march. On the 13th and 14th the Boers  pursued their system of annoyance around the railway, and directed a  storm of bullets on a construction train which had arrived under the  personal direction of Colonel Girouard, R.E., for the purpose of  repairing the depredations of the past few days. Luckily, thanks to the  pluck of the construction party (they were short of rifles, owing to many  having been left in the rear train), a very able defence was kept up all  night, until a party of mounted infantry--who at the first sound of  firing started to the rescue--arrived with their guns and routed the foe.  They came none too soon, for the Boers had made a fairly big haul, and  carried off some forty of the construction workers as prisoners. The  mounted infantry scurried after the retiring Dutchmen, but, as usual,  these had knowingly melted into twos and threes and were uncatchable. In  the attack on the train one man was killed and eleven wounded, including  Lieutenant Micklem, Royal Engineers, Second Lieutenant Bigge, Volunteer  Royal Engineers.    Meanwhile, at Virginia the garrison had an exceedingly trying time; but  owing to the energy of Colonels Capper and North and the troops under  them, and the conspicuous coolness and valour of Lieutenant Mitchell, the  Boers were repulsed. At daybreak on the 14th some 800 Boers, with one or  two pom-poms, a Maxim, and a field gun, ensconced themselves in the dense  scrub surrounding the Zand River post. The garrison consisted of four  companies 3rd Battalion Royal Lancasters under Colonel North (about 250  fit for duty), four companies Railway Pioneer Regiment under Major  Seymour (300 fit for duty), and some 25 men of the Royal Irish Regiment  (16 fit for duty) under Lieutenant Davenport. The position was a somewhat  extended one, the left being in advance trenches on broken and jungly  ground. This point the Boers attacked with determination, and were as  determinedly resisted by Lieutenant W. Mitchell and No. 3 Company Railway  Pioneer Regiment. The enemy in the dense bush were practically  surrounding the British party, but these fought doggedly, engaging their  assailants at very close quarters and keeping them at bay till nearly  noon, when the Dutchmen were ultimately driven out of their hiding-places  by an advance through the scrub of a line of reserve Railway Pioneer  Regiment, aided by half a company of Militia. Thus driven forth, they  made haste to retire before the arrival of a body of 170 Yeomanry (under  Lieutenant Crane), which had hastened to the rescue from the south. The  losses were comparatively small, owing to the marvellous grit of young  Mitchell, who, though wounded at the onset in both thighs, continued for  six hours to encourage and direct his men (there were only 22 of them  scattered in several small trenches), ordering them not to waste  ammunition, cheering them, and concealing from them, till the worst was  over, the fact that he himself was seriously wounded. Another gallant  officer, Major Seymour, distinguished himself, but he paid for his valour  with his life. He was killed while advancing with the extended line  through the bush to clear out the snipers. Lieutenant Clement of No. 2  Company of the Railway Pioneer Regiment was mortally wounded.    On the 18th Lord Kitchener, having restored communications, returned to  Pretoria, and Lord Methuen moved to Heilbron. Precautions to avert  further interruptions on the railway had been taken by establishing posts  within communicable distance of each other all along the line, connected  by a continually perambulating military train carrying field and  automatic guns.    A combined movement had again to be planned for the surrounding of De  Wet, who, though defeated on the 13th by Lord Methuen, and subsequently  by Lord Kitchener, was still displaying an elasticity of disposition  greatly to his credit, if discomforting to his pursuers. He and his  followers now rebounded in the direction of Heilbron, where on the 18th  he endeavoured to arrest the entry of Lord Methuen and a large convoy  which he was escorting. A smart engagement ensued, which, it was thought,  would have the effect of clearing the air. But peace was short-lived, as  we shall see.    The war at this time, though full of inspiriting events, was as hard,  perhaps harder, for the soldier than ever. There were the same chances of  being wiped out by shot, shell, or disease, but the honour and glory of  laying down one's life for one's country was bereft of its glamour. Tommy  Atkins now needed all his patience, all his pluck. There are men who can  face hostile artillery, but will squirm before a dentist. In these days  there were many seasoned fighters, who might be excused if they shrunk  from the railway accident or promiscuous sniping from invisible farms,  which was part and parcel of the guerilla form of warfare adopted by the  remnant of the Boer army--the malcontents, who, subversive of discipline  and hating the British race, had decided to fight to the bitter end.  Comments regarding the attitude of some of our troops have been made by  many who lack the large mind to look at the enormous army as a whole, and  who find pleasure in examining only its flaws with the microscope and  holding them up to public contempt. Such comments it is unnecessary to  reproduce. The brilliant British army, like all great and brilliant  things, must necessarily have the defects of its qualities, and it is  with the immense qualities and not the infinitesimal defects of victors  that the faithful recorder has to do. To return, then, to the  nerve-trying ordeals that formed part of the almost daily programme of  the soldier's duty.    At Honing Spruit, situated on the rail twenty-one miles north of  Kroonstad, an exciting affair took place on the 22nd of June, all the  more exciting as those engaged had but a few days previously been rescued  from durance vile in Pretoria prison. On the 14th a party of 16 released  officers from various regiments, with some 400 men, was ordered to  Elandsfontein, the station outside Johannesburg, which had been so  admirably secured by Colonel Henry's force.    On the 21st this party was moved on to Katbosh Camp, a mile or so beyond  Honing Spruit, where were stationed two companies of the Shropshires and  some mounted Canadians under the command of Colonel Evans. The officers  of the composite force were: Colonel Bullock, of the Devonshires,  commanding; Major Stock, of the Wiltshire Regiment; Major Carleton, Royal  Lancasters; Captains Elmslie and Freeth, of the Lancashire Fusiliers;  Lieutenants Bryant, Temple, Radice, Smith, Mackenzie, and Gray, of the  Gloucestershire Regiment; Jones, of the Connaught Rangers; Best, of the  Inniskilling Fusiliers; Prior, Engineer Militia; Colson, of the 5th  Fusiliers; and Wood-Martin, of the Suffolk Regiment. These, all of them,  had had sufficiently horrible experiences, both during the hardly fought  engagements in which they had been taken prisoners, and in the period of  incarceration at the Model School, and vowed never again to be caught  alive in the trap of the Dutchmen. They then hardly realised how near"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4633"],[0,"Philip Steele of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (#9)"],[1,"of \"Whatever happens, bring  back your prisoner!\" But this letter was evidently intended as final  instructions since it had been sent so as to reach him at this time.  What did it mean? The question buzzed in Philip's brain, repeated itself  twenty times, fifty times, as he hurried through the gathering darkness  of the semi-polar night toward the log hotel of the place. He was  convinced that there was some hidden motive in the inspector's actions.  What was he to understand?    Suddenly he stopped, a hundred yards from the glimmering lights of the  Little Saskatchewan hotel, and chuckled audibly as he stuffed his pipe.  It flashed upon him now why MacGregor had chosen him instead of an  ordinary service man to bring down the prisoner from Wekusko. MacGregor  knew that he, Philip Steele, college man and man of the world, would  reason out the key to this little puzzle, whereas Sergeant Moody and  others of his type would turn back for explanations. And Inspector  MacGregor, twenty years in the service, and recognized as the shrewdest  man-hunter between the coasts, wished to give no explanation. Philip's  blood tingled with fresh excitement as the tremendous risk which the  inspector himself was running, dawned upon him. Publicity of the note  which he held in his hand would mean the disgrace and retirement even of  Felix MacGregor.    He thrust the letter in his pocket and hurried on. The lights of the  settlement were already agleam. From the edge of the frozen river there  came the sound of a wheezy accordion in a Chinese cafe, and the howling  of a dog, either struck by man or worsted in a fight. Where the more  numerous lights of the one street shone red against the black background  of forest, a drunken half-breed was chanting in half-Cree, half-French,  the chorus of the caribou song. He heard the distant snapping of a whip,  the yelping response of huskies, and a moment later a sledge and six  dogs passed him so close that he was compelled to leap from their path.  This was Le Pas--the wilderness! Beyond it, just over the frozen river  which lay white and silent before him, stretched that endless desolation  of romance and mystery which he had grown to love, a world of deep  snows, of silent-tongued men, of hardship and battle for life where the  law of nature was the survival of the fittest, and that of man, \"Do  unto others as ye would that they should do unto you.\" Never did Philip  Steele's heart throb with the wild, free pulse of life and joy as in  such moments as these, when his fortune, his clubs, and his friends  were a thousand miles away, and he stood on the edge of the big northern  Unknown.    As he had slept through the trainmen's dinner hour, he was as hungry as  a wolf, and he lost no time in seating himself in a warm corner of the  low, log-ceilinged dining-room of the Little Saskatchewan. Although a  quarter of an hour early, he had hardly placed himself at his table when  another person entered the room. Casually he glanced up from the two  letters which he had spread out before him. The one who had followed him  was a woman. She had turned sharply upon seeing him and seated herself  at the next table, her back so toward him that he caught only her half  profile.    It was enough to assure him that she was young and pretty. On her head  she wore a turban of silver lynx fur, and about this she had drawn her  glossy brown hair, which shone like burnished copper in the lamp-glow,  and had gathered it in a bewitchingly coquettish knot low on her neck,  where it shone with a new richness and a new warmth with every turn of  her head. But not once did she turn so that Philip could see more than  the tantalizing pink of her cheek and the prettiness of her chin, which  at times was partly concealed in a collarette of the same silver gray  lynx fur.    He ate his supper almost mechanically, in spite of his hunger, for his  mind was deep in the mysterious problem which confronted him. Half a  dozen times he broke in upon his thoughts to glance at the girl at the  opposite table. Once he was sure that she had been looking at him and  that she had turned just in time to keep her face from him. Philip  admired pretty women, and of all beauty in woman he loved beautiful  hair, so that more and more frequently his eyes traveled to the shining  wealth of copper-colored tresses near him. He had almost finished his  supper when a movement at the other table drew his eyes up squarely, and  his heart gave a sudden jump. The girl had risen. She was facing him,  and as for an instant their eyes met she hesitated, as if she were on  the point of speaking. In that moment he recognized her.    It was the girl in the photograph, older, more beautiful--the same soft,  sweet contour of face, the same dark eyes that had looked at him in  MacGregor's office, filled with an indescribable sadness now, instead of  the laughing joy of girlhood. In another moment he would have responded  to her hesitation, to the pathetic tremble of her lips, but before words  could form themselves she had turned and was gone. And yet at the  door, even as she disappeared, he saw her face turned to him again,  pleadingly, entreatingly, as if she knew his mission and sent to him a  silent prayer for mercy.    Thrusting back his chair, he caught up his hat from a rack and followed.  He was in time to see her pass through the low door out into the night.  Without hesitation his mind had leaped to a definite purpose. He would  overtake her outside, introduce himself, and then perhaps he would  understand the conflicting orders of Inspector MacGregor.    The girl was passing swiftly down the main street when he took up the  pursuit. Suddenly she turned into a path dug through the snow that led  riverward. Ahead of her there was only the starlit gloom of night and  the distant blackness of the wilderness edge. Philip's blood ran a  little faster. She had expected that he would follow, knew that he was  close behind her, and had turned down into this deserted place that they  might not be observed! He made no effort now to overtake her, but kept  the same distance between them, whistling carelessly and knowing that  she would stop to wait for him. Ahead of them there loomed up out of  the darkness a clump of sapling spruce, and into their shadow the girl  disappeared.    A dozen paces more and Philip himself was buried in the thick gloom. He  heard quick, light footsteps in the snow-crust ahead of him. Then there  came another sound--a step close behind him, a noise of disturbed brush,  a low voice which was not that of a woman, and before his hand could  slip, to the holster at his belt a human form launched itself upon him  from the side, and a second form from behind, and under their weight  he fell a helpless heap into the snow. Powerful hands wrenched his arms  behind his back and other hands drew a cloth about his mouth. A stout  cord was twisted around his wrists, his legs were tied, and then his  captors relieved him of their weight.    Not a word had been spoken during the brief struggle. Not a word was  spoken now as his mysterious assailants hoisted him between them and  followed in the footsteps of the woman. Scarcely a hundred paces beyond  the spruce the dark shadow of a cabin came into view. Into this he was  carried and placed on something which he took to be a box. Then a light  was struck.    For the first time Philip's astonished eyes had a view of his captors.  One of them was an old man, a giant in physique, with a long gray beard  and grayish yellow hair that fell to his shoulders. His companion was  scarcely more than a boy, yet in his supple body, as he moved about,  Philip recognized the animal-like strength of the forest breed. A word  spoken in a whisper by the boy revealed the fact that the two were  father and son. From that side of the room which was at Philip's back  they dragged forth a long pine box, and were engaged in this occupation  when the door opened and a third man entered. Never had Philip looked on  a more unprepossessing face than that of the newcomer, in whose little  black eyes there seemed to be a gloating triumph as he leered at the  prisoner. He was short, with a huge breadth of shoulders. His eyes and  mouth and nose were all but engulfed in superfluous flesh, and as he  turned from Philip to the man and boy over the box he snapped the joints  of his fingers in a startling manner.    \"Howdy, howdy!\" he wheezed, like one afflicted with asthma. \"Good!  good!\" With these four words he lapsed into the silence of the older man  and the boy.    As the box was dragged full into the light, a look of horror shot into  Philip's eyes. It was the rough-box of a coffin! Without a word, and  apparently without a signal, the three surrounded him and lifted him  bodily into it. To his surprise he found himself lying upon something  soft, as if the interior of his strange prison had been padded with  cushions. Then, with extreme caution, his arms were freed from under his  back and strapped to his side, and other straps, broad and firm, were  fastened from side to side of the box across his limbs and body, as  if there were danger of his flying up and out through the top. Another  moment and a shadow fell above him, pitch gloom engulfed him.    They were dragging on the cover to the box! He heard the rapid beating  of a hammer, the biting of nails into wood, and he writhed and struggled  to free his hands, to cry out, to gain the use of his legs, but not the  fraction of an inch could he relieve himself of his fetters. After a  time his straining muscles relaxed, and he stopped to get his breath and  listen. Faintly there came to him the sound of subdued voices, and he  caught a glimmer of light, then another, and still a third. He saw now  that half a dozen holes had been bored into the cover and sides of the  box. The discovery brought with it a sense of relief. At least he was  not to be suffocated."]]]
