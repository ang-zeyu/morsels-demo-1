Look you, those calves and thighs are well  rounded and straight. The arms, for all that gold-wrought cloak, hang  stoutly from full shoulders. I warrant you the fop can use his dainty  sword right well on occasion.\"    \"Nay,\" retorted Robin, \"he is naught but a ladies' man from court. My  long-bow 'gainst a plugged shilling that he would run and bellow lustily  at sight of a quarter-staff. Stay you behind this bush and I will soon  get some rare sport out of him. Belike his silk purse may contain more  pennies than the law allows to one man in Sherwood or Barnesdale.\"    So saying Robin Hood stepped forth briskly from the covert and planted  himself in the way of the scarlet stranger. The latter had walked  so slowly that he was scarce come to their resting-place; and now  on beholding Robin he neither slackened nor quickened his pace but  sauntered idly straight ahead, looking to the right and to the left,  with the finest air in the world, but never once at Robin.    \"Hold!\" quoth the outlaw. \"What mean ye by running thus over a wayfarer,  rough shod?\"    \"Wherefore should I hold, good fellow?\" said the stranger in a smooth  voice, and looking at Robin for the first time.    \"Because I bid you to,\" replied Robin.    \"And who may you be?\" asked the other as coolly as you please.    \"What my name is matters not,\" said Robin; \"but know that I am a public  tax-gatherer and equalizer of shillings. If your purse have more than a  just number of shillings or pence, I must e'en lighten it somewhat; for  there are many worthy people round about these borders who have less  than the just amount. Wherefore, sweet gentleman, I pray you hand over  your purse without more ado, that I may judge of its weight in proper  fashion.\"    The other smiled as sweetly as though a lady were paying him a  compliment.    \"You are a droll fellow,\" he said calmly. \"Your speech amuses me  mightily. Pray continue, if you have not done, for I am in no hurry this  morning.\"    \"I have said all with my tongue that is needful,\" retorted Robin,  beginning to grow red under the collar. \"Nathless, I have other  arguments which may not be so pleasing to your dainty skin. Prithee,  stand and deliver. I promise to deal fairly with the purse.\"    \"Alack-a-day!\" said the stranger with a little shrug of his shoulders;  \"I am deeply sorrowful that I cannot show my purse to every rough lout  that asks to see it. But I really could not, as I have further need of  it myself and every farthing it contains. Wherefore, pray stand aside.\"    \"Nay that will I not! and 'twill go the harder with you if you do not  yield at once.\"    \"Good fellow,\" said the other gently, \"have I not heard all your speech  with patience? Now that is all I promised to do. My conscience is salved  and I must go on my way. To-rol-o-rol-e-loo!\" he caroled, making as  though to depart.    \"Hold, I say!\" quoth Robin hotly; for he knew how Little John must be  chuckling at this from behind the bushes. \"Hold I say, else I shall have  to bloody those fair locks of yours!\" And he swung his quarter-staff  threateningly.    \"Alas!\" moaned the stranger shaking his head. \"The pity of it all! Now I  shall have to run this fellow through with my sword! And I hoped to be a  peaceable man henceforth!\" And sighing deeply he drew his shining blade  and stood on guard.    \"Put by your weapon,\" said Robin. \"It is too pretty a piece of steel to  get cracked with common oak cudgel; and that is what would happen on  the first pass I made at you. Get you a stick like mine out of yon  undergrowth, and we will fight fairly, man to man.\"    The stranger thought a moment with his usual slowness, and eyed Robin  from head to foot. Then he unbuckled his scabbard, laid it and the sword  aside, and walked deliberately over to the oak thicket. Choosing from  among the shoots and saplings he found a stout little tree to his  liking, when he laid hold of it, without stopping to cut it, and gave a  tug. Up it came root and all, as though it were a stalk of corn, and the  stranger walked back trimming it as quietly as though pulling up trees  were the easiest thing in the world.    Little John from his hiding-place saw the feat, and could hardly  restrain a long whistle. \"By our Lady!\" he muttered to himself, \"I would  not be in Master Robin's boots!\"    Whatever Robin thought upon seeing the stranger's strength, he uttered  not a word and budged not an inch. He only put his oak staff at parry as  the other took his stand.    There was a threefold surprise that day, by the brookside. The stranger  and Robin and Little John in the bushes all found a combat that upset  all reckoning. The stranger for all his easy strength and cool nerve  found an antagonist who met his blows with the skill of a woodman. Robin  found the stranger as hard to hit as though fenced in by an oak hedge.  While Little John rolled over and over in silent joy.    Back and forth swayed the fighters, their cudgels pounding this way and  that, knocking off splinters and bark, and threatening direst damage to  bone and muscle and skin. Back and forth they pranced kicking up a cloud  of dust and gasping for fresh air. From a little way off you would have  vowed that these two men were trying to put out a fire, so thickly  hung the cloud of battle over them. Thrice did Robin smite the scarlet  man--with such blows that a less stout fellow must have bowled over.  Only twice did the scarlet man smite Robin, but the second blow was  like to finish him. The first had been delivered over the knuckles, and  though 'twas a glancing stroke it well nigh broke Robin's fingers, so  that he could not easily raise his staff again. And while he was dancing  about in pain and muttering a dust-covered oath, the other's staff came  swinging through the cloud at one side--zip!--and struck him under the  arm. Down went Robin as though he were a nine-pin--flat down into the  dust of the road. But despite the pain he was bounding up again like an  India rubber man to renew the attack, when Little John interfered.    \"Hold!\" said he, bursting out of the bushes and seizing the stranger's  weapon. \"Hold, I say!\"    \"Nay,\" retorted the stranger quietly, \"I was not offering to smite him  while he was down. But if there be a whole nest of you hatching here by  the waterside, cluck out the other chicks and I'll make shift to fight  them all.\"    \"Not for all the deer in Sherwood!\" cried Robin. \"You are a good fellow  and a gentleman. I'll fight no more with you, for verily I feel sore in  wrist and body. Nor shall any of mine molest you henceforth.\"    Sooth to say, Robin did not look in good fighting trim. His clothes were  coated with dirt, one of his hosen had slipped halfway down from his  knee, the sleeve of his jerkin was split, and his face was streaked with  sweat and dirt. Little John eyed him drolly.    \"How now, good master,\" quoth he, \"the sport you were to kick up has  left you in sorry plight. Let me dust your coat for you.\"    \"Marry, it has been dusted enough already,\" replied Robin; \"and I now  believe the Scripture saying that all men are but dust, for it has  sifted me through and through and lined my gullet an inch deep. By your  leave\"--and he went to the brookside and drank deep and laved his face  and hands.    All this while the stranger had been eyeing Robin attentively and  listening to his voice as though striving to recall it.    \"If I mistake not,\" he said slowly at last, \"you are that famous outlaw,  Robin Hood of Barnesdale.\"    \"You say right,\" replied Robin; \"but my fame has been tumbling sadly  about in the dust to-day.\"    \"Now why did I not know you at once?\" continued the stranger. \"This  battle need not have happened, for I came abroad to find you to-day, and  thought to have remembered your face and speech. Know you not me, Rob,  my lad? Hast ever been to Gamewell Lodge?\"    \"Ha! Will Gamewell! my dear old chum, Will Gamewell!\" shouted Robin,  throwing his arms about the other in sheer affection. \"What an ass I was  not to recognize you! But it has been years since we parted, and your  gentle schooling has polished you off mightily.\"    Will embraced his cousin no less heartily.    \"We are quits on not knowing kinsmen,\" he said, \"for you have changed  and strengthened much from the stripling with whom I used to run foot  races in old Sherwood.\"    \"But why seek you me?\" asked Robin. \"You know I am an outlaw and  dangerous company. And how left you mine uncle? and have you heard aught  of late of--of Maid Marian?\"    \"Your last question first,\" answered Will, laughing, \"for I perceive  that it lies nearest your heart. I saw Maid Marian not many weeks after  the great shooting at Nottingham, when you won her the golden arrow. She  prizes the bauble among her dearest possessions, though it has made her  an enemy in the Sheriff's proud daughter. Maid Marian bade me tell you,  if I ever saw you, that she must return to Queen Eleanor's court, but  she could never forget the happy days in the greenwood. As for the old  Squire, he is still hale and hearty, though rheumatic withal. He speaks  of you as a sad young dog, but for all that is secretly proud of your  skill at the bow and of the way you are pestering the Sheriff, whom  he likes not. 'Twas for my father's sake that I am now in the open, an  outlaw like yourself. He has had a steward, a surly fellow enough, who,  while I was away at school, boot-licked his way to favor until he lorded  it over the whole house. Then he grew right saucy and impudent, but my  father minded it not, deeming the fellow indispensable in managing the  estate. But when I came back it irked me sorely to see the fellow strut  about as though he owned the place. He was sly enough with me at first,  and would brow-beat the Squire only while I was out of earshot.

'I'm sure it's much warmer than the seaside in the summer,' said Anthea.  'Mother always lets us go barefoot then.'    So the Lamb's shoes and socks and gaiters came off, and he stood digging  his happy naked pink toes into the golden smooth sand.    'I'm a little white duck-dickie,' said he--'a little white duck-dickie  what swims,' and splashed quacking into a sandy pool.    'Let him,' said Anthea; 'it can't hurt him. Oh, how hot it is!'    The cook suddenly opened her eyes and screamed, shut them, screamed  again, opened her eyes once more and said--    'Why, drat my cats alive, what's all this? It's a dream, I expect.    Well, it's the best I ever dreamed. I'll look it up in the dream-book  to-morrow. Seaside and trees and a carpet to sit on. I never did!'    'Look here,' said Cyril, 'it isn't a dream; it's real.'    'Ho yes!' said the cook; 'they always says that in dreams.'    'It's REAL, I tell you,' Robert said, stamping his foot. 'I'm not going  to tell you how it's done, because that's our secret.' He winked heavily  at each of the others in turn. 'But you wouldn't go away and make that  pudding, so we HAD to bring you, and I hope you like it.'    'I do that, and no mistake,' said the cook unexpectedly; 'and it being a  dream it don't matter what I say; and I WILL say, if it's my last word,  that of all the aggravating little varmints--' 'Calm yourself, my good  woman,' said the Phoenix.    'Good woman, indeed,' said the cook; 'good woman yourself' Then she  saw who it was that had spoken. 'Well, if I ever,' said she; 'this is  something like a dream! Yellow fowls a-talking and all! I've heard of  such, but never did I think to see the day.'    'Well, then,' said Cyril, impatiently, 'sit here and see the day now.  It's a jolly fine day. Here, you others--a council!' They walked along  the shore till they were out of earshot of the cook, who still sat  gazing about her with a happy, dreamy, vacant smile.    'Look here,' said Cyril, 'we must roll the carpet up and hide it, so  that we can get at it at any moment. The Lamb can be getting rid of  his whooping-cough all the morning, and we can look about; and if the  savages on this island are cannibals, we'll hook it, and take her back.  And if not, we'll LEAVE HER HERE.'    'Is that being kind to servants and animals, like the clergyman said?'  asked Jane.    'Nor she isn't kind,' retorted Cyril.    'Well--anyway,' said Anthea, 'the safest thing is to leave the carpet  there with her sitting on it. Perhaps it'll be a lesson to her, and  anyway, if she thinks it's a dream it won't matter what she says when  she gets home.'    So the extra coats and hats and mufflers were piled on the carpet. Cyril  shouldered the well and happy Lamb, the Phoenix perched on Robert's  wrist, and 'the party of explorers prepared to enter the interior'.    The grassy slope was smooth, but under the trees there were tangled  creepers with bright, strange-shaped flowers, and it was not easy to  walk.    'We ought to have an explorer's axe,' said Robert. 'I shall ask father  to give me one for Christmas.'    There were curtains of creepers with scented blossoms hanging from the  trees, and brilliant birds darted about quite close to their faces.    'Now, tell me honestly,' said the Phoenix, 'are there any birds here  handsomer than I am? Don't be afraid of hurting my feelings--I'm a  modest bird, I hope.'    'Not one of them,' said Robert, with conviction, 'is a patch upon you!'    'I was never a vain bird,' said the Phoenix, 'but I own that you confirm  my own impression. I will take a flight.' It circled in the air for a  moment, and, returning to Robert's wrist, went on, 'There is a path to  the left.'    And there was. So now the children went on through the wood more quickly  and comfortably, the girls picking flowers and the Lamb inviting  the 'pretty dickies' to observe that he himself was a 'little white  real-water-wet duck!'    And all this time he hadn't whooping-coughed once.    The path turned and twisted, and, always threading their way amid a  tangle of flowers, the children suddenly passed a corner and found  themselves in a forest clearing, where there were a lot of pointed  huts--the huts, as they knew at once, of SAVAGES.    The boldest heart beat more quickly. Suppose they WERE cannibals. It was  a long way back to the carpet.    'Hadn't we better go back?' said Jane. 'Go NOW,' she said, and her voice  trembled a little. 'Suppose they eat us.'    'Nonsense, Pussy,' said Cyril, firmly. 'Look, there's a goat tied up.  That shows they don't eat PEOPLE.'    'Let's go on and say we're missionaries,' Robert suggested.    'I shouldn't advise THAT,' said the Phoenix, very earnestly.    'Why not?'    'Well, for one thing, it isn't true,' replied the golden bird.    It was while they stood hesitating on the edge of the clearing that  a tall man suddenly came out of one of the huts. He had hardly any  clothes, and his body all over was a dark and beautiful coppery  colour--just like the chrysanthemums father had brought home on  Saturday. In his hand he held a spear. The whites of his eyes and the  white of his teeth were the only light things about him, except that  where the sun shone on his shiny brown body it looked white, too. If  you will look carefully at the next shiny savage you meet with next to  nothing on, you will see at once--if the sun happens to be shining at  the time--that I am right about this.    The savage looked at the children. Concealment was impossible. He  uttered a shout that was more like 'Oo goggery bag-wag' than anything  else the children had ever heard, and at once brown coppery people leapt  out of every hut, and swarmed like ants about the clearing. There was  no time for discussion, and no one wanted to discuss anything, anyhow.  Whether these coppery people were cannibals or not now seemed to matter  very little.    Without an instant's hesitation the four children turned and ran back  along the forest path; the only pause was Anthea's. She stood back to  let Cyril pass, because he was carrying the Lamb, who screamed with  delight. (He had not whooping-coughed a single once since the carpet  landed him on the island.)    'Gee-up, Squirrel; gee-gee,' he shouted, and Cyril did gee-up. The path  was a shorter cut to the beach than the creeper-covered way by which  they had come, and almost directly they saw through the trees the  shining blue-and-gold-and-opal of sand and sea.    'Stick to it,' cried Cyril, breathlessly.    They did stick to it; they tore down the sands--they could hear behind  them as they ran the patter of feet which they knew, too well, were  copper-coloured.    The sands were golden and opal-coloured--and BARE. There were wreaths of  tropic seaweed, there were rich tropic shells of the kind you would not  buy in the Kentish Town Road under at least fifteen pence a pair.  There were turtles basking lumpily on the water's edge--but no cook, no  clothes, and no carpet.    'On, on! Into the sea!' gasped Cyril. 'They MUST hate water.  I've--heard--savages always--dirty.'    Their feet were splashing in the warm shallows before his breathless  words were ended. The calm baby-waves were easy to go through. It is  warm work running for your life in the tropics, and the coolness of the  water was delicious. They were up to their arm-pits now, and Jane was up  to her chin.    'Look!' said the Phoenix. 'What are they pointing at?'    The children turned; and there, a little to the west was a head--a head  they knew, with a crooked cap upon it. It was the head of the cook.    For some reason or other the savages had stopped at the water's edge  and were all talking at the top of their voices, and all were pointing  copper-coloured fingers, stiff with interest and excitement, at the head  of the cook.    The children hurried towards her as quickly as the water would let them.    'What on earth did you come out here for?' Robert shouted; 'and where on  earth's the carpet?'    'It's not on earth, bless you,' replied the cook, happily; 'it's UNDER  ME--in the water. I got a bit warm setting there in the sun, and I just  says, \"I wish I was in a cold bath\"--just like that--and next minute  here I was! It's all part of the dream.'    Every one at once saw how extremely fortunate it was that the carpet had  had the sense to take the cook to the nearest and largest bath--the sea,  and how terrible it would have been if the carpet had taken itself and  her to the stuffy little bath-room of the house in Camden Town!    'Excuse me,' said the Phoenix's soft voice, breaking in on the general  sigh of relief, 'but I think these brown people want your cook.'    'To--to eat?' whispered Jane, as well as she could through the water  which the plunging Lamb was dashing in her face with happy fat hands and  feet.    'Hardly,' rejoined the bird. 'Who wants cooks to EAT? Cooks are ENGAGED,  not eaten. They wish to engage her.'    'How can you understand what they say?' asked Cyril, doubtfully.    'It's as easy as kissing your claw,' replied the bird. 'I speak and  understand ALL languages, even that of your cook, which is difficult and  unpleasing. It's quite easy, when you know how it's done. It just comes  to you. I should advise you to beach the carpet and land the cargo--the  cook, I mean. You can take my word for it, the copper-coloured ones will  not harm you now.'    It is impossible not to take the word of a Phoenix when it tells you  to. So the children at once got hold of the corners of the carpet,  and, pulling it from under the cook, towed it slowly in through the  shallowing water, and at last spread it on the sand. The cook, who had  followed, instantly sat down on it, and at once the copper-coloured  natives, now strangely humble, formed a ring round the carpet, and fell  on their faces on the rainbow-and-gold sand. The tallest savage spoke  in this position, which must have been very awkward for him; and Jane  noticed"]]]
