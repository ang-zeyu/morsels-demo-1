Before he reached the age of manhood, Parley had in his native State  (N.Y.) met with reverses in fortune so serious as to change the  purposes of his life.    \"I resolved,\" he says, \"to bid farewell to the civilized world, where  I had met with little else but disappointment, sorrow and unrewarded  toil; and where sectarian divisions disgusted, and ignorance perplexed  me,--and to spend the remainder of my days in the solitudes of the  great West, among the natives of the forest.\"    In October, 1826, he took leave of his friends and started westward,  coming at length to a small settlement about thirty miles west of  Cleveland, in the State of Ohio. The country was covered with a dense  forest, with only here and there a small opening made by the settlers,  and the surface of the earth was one vast scene of mud and mire.    Alone, in a land of strangers, without home or money, and not yet  twenty years of age, he became somewhat discouraged, but concluded to  stop for the winter.    In the spring he resolved to return to his native State, for there was  one at home whom his heart had long loved and from whom he would not  have been separated, except by misfortune.    But with her, as his wife, he returned to Ohio, the following year, and  made a home on the lands which he cleared with his own hands. [1]    Eighteen months thereafter Sidney Rigdon came into the neighborhood,  as a preacher. With this reformer Parley associated himself in the  ministry, and organized a society of disciples.    But Parley was not satisfied with even the ancient _gospel form_  without the power.    At the commencement of 1830, the very time the Mormon Church was  organized, he felt drawn out in an extraordinary manner to search the  prophets, and to pray for an understanding of the same. His prayers  were soon answered, even beyond his expectations. The prophesies were  opened to his view. He began to understand the things which were about  to transpire. The restoration of Israel, the coming of Messiah, and the  glory that should follow.    Being now \"moved upon by the Holy Ghost\" to travel about preaching the  gospel \"without purse or scrip,\" in August, 1830, he closed his worldly  business and bid adieu to his wilderness home, which he never saw  afterwards.    \"Arriving at Rochester,\" he says, \"I informed my wife that,  notwithstanding our passage being paid through the whole distance, yet  I must leave the boat and her to pursue her passage to her friends,  while I would stop awhile in this region. Why, I did not know; but so  it was plainly manifest by the spirit to me.    \"I said to her, we part for a season; go and visit our friends in our  native place; I will come soon, but how soon I know not; for I have  a work to do in this region of country, and what it is, or how long  it will take to perform it, I know not; but I will come when it is  performed.    \"My wife would have objected to this, but she had seen the hand of God  so plainly manifest in his dealings with me many times, that she dared  not oppose the things manifested to me by his spirit. She, therefore,  consented; and I accompanied her as far as Newark, a small town upwards  of one hundred miles from Buffalo, and then took leave of her, and of  the boat.    \"It was early in the morning, just at the dawn of day; I walked ten  miles into the country, and stopped to breakfast with a Mr. Wells.  I proposed to preach in the evening. Mr. Wells readily accompanied  me through the neighborhood to visit the people, and circulate the  appointment.    \"We visited an old Baptist deacon, by the name of Hamlin. After hearing  of our appointment for the evening, he began to tell of a book, a  strange book, a very strange book, in his possession, which had been  just published. This book, he said, purported to have been originally  written on plates, either of gold or brass, by a branch of the tribes  of Israel; and to have been discovered and translated by a young man  near Palmyra, in the State of New York, by the aid of visions, or the  ministry of angels.    \"I inquired of him how or where the book was to be obtained. He  promised me the perusal of it, at his house the next day, if I would  call. I felt a strange interest in the book.    \"Next morning I called at his house, where for the first time my eyes  beheld the Book of Mormon,--that book of books--that record which  reveals the antiquities of the 'new world' back to the remotest ages,  and which unfolds the destiny of its people and the world, for all time  to come.\"    As he read, the spirit of the Lord was upon him, and he knew and  comprehended that the book was true; whereupon he resolved to visit  the young man who was the instrument in bringing forth this \"marvelous  work.\"    Accordingly he visited the village of Palmyra, and inquired for the  residence of Mr. Joseph Smith, which he found some two or three miles  from the village. As he approached the house, at the close of the day,  he overtook a man driving some cows, and inquired of him for \"Mr.  Joseph Smith, the translator of the Book of Mormon.\" This man was none  other than Hyrum, Joseph's brother, who informed him that Joseph then  resided in Pennsylvania, some one hundred miles distant. That night  Parley was entertained by Hyrum, who explained to him much of the great  Israelitish mission just opening to the world.    In the morning he was compelled to take leave of Hyrum, the brother,  who at parting presented him with a copy of the Book of Mormon. He had  not then completed its perusal, and so after traveling on a few miles  he stopped to rest and again commenced to read the book. To his great  joy he found that Jesus Christ, in his glorified resurrected body,  had appeared to the \"remnant of Joseph\" on the continent of America,  soon after his resurrection and ascension into heaven; and that he  also administered, in person, to the ten lost tribes; and that through  his personal ministry in these countries his gospel was revealed and  written in countries and among nations entirely unknown to the Jewish  apostles.    Having rested awhile and perused the sacred book by the roadside, he  again walked on.    After fulfilling his appointments, he resolved to preach no more until  he had duly received a \"commission from on high.\" So he returned to  Hyrum, who journeyed with him some twenty-five miles to the residence  of Mr. Whitmer, in Seneca County, who was one of the \"witnesses\" of the  Book of Mormon, and in whose chamber much of the book was translated.    He found the little branch of the church in that place \"full of joy,  faith, humility and charity.\"    They rested that night, and on the next day (the 1st of September,  1830), Parley was baptized by Oliver Cowdery, who, with the prophet  Joseph, had been ordained \"under the hands\" of the angel John the  Baptist to this ministry,--the same John who baptized Jesus Christ in  the River Jordan.    A meeting of these primitive saints was held the same evening, when  Parley was confirmed with the gift of the Holy Ghost, and ordained an  elder of the church.    Feeling now that he had the true authority to preach, he commenced  his new ministry under the authority and power which the angels had  conferred. \"The Holy Ghost,\" he says, \"came upon me mightily. I spoke  the word of God with power, reasoning out of the scriptures and the  Book of Mormon. The people were convinced, overwhelmed with tears, and  came forward expressing their faith, and were baptized.\"    The mysterious object for which he took leave of his wife was realized,  and so he pursued his journey to the land of his fathers, and of his  boyhood.    He now commenced his labors in good earnest, daily addressing crowded  audiences; and soon he baptized his brother Orson, a youth of nineteen,  but to-day a venerable apostle--the Paul of Mormondom.    It was during his labors in these parts, in the Autumn of 1830, that he  saw a very singular and extraordinary sign in the heavens.    He had been on a visit to the people called Shakers, at New Lebanon,  and was returning on foot, on a beautiful evening of September. The sky  was without a cloud; the stars shone out beautifully, and all nature  seemed reposing in quiet, as he pursued his solitary way, wrapt in deep  meditations on the predictions of the holy prophets; the signs of the  times; the approaching advent of the Messiah to reign on the earth, and  the important revelations of the Book of Mormon, when his attention was  aroused by a sudden appearance of a brilliant light which shone around  him \"above the brightness of the sun.\" He cast his eyes upwards to  inquire from whence the light came, when he perceived a long chain of  light extending in the heavens, very bright and of a deep fiery red. It  at first stood stationary in a horizontal position; at length bending  in the centre, the two ends approached each other with a rapid movement  so as to form an exact square. In this position it again remained  stationary for some time, perhaps a minute, and then again the ends  approached each other with the same rapidity, and again ceased to move,  remaining stationary, for perhaps a minute, in the form of a compass.  It then commenced a third movement in the same manner, and closed like  the closing of a compass, the whole forming a straight line like a  chain doubled. It again remained stationary a minute, and then faded  away.    \"I fell upon my knees in the street,\" he says, \"and thanked the Lord  for so marvelous a sign of the coming of the Son of Man. Some persons  may smile at this, and say that all these exact movements were by  chance; but for my part I could as soon believe that the alphabet would  be formed by chance and be placed so as to spell my name, as to believe  that these signs (known only to the wise) could be formed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54337"],[0,"Reminiscences of Joseph, the Prophet, and the Coming Forth of the Book of Mormon (#9)"],[1,"written by him over the seven lines of characters,  shown in another place in this pamphlet, he afterwards became  proficient as a scholar, and studied the classic languages at the  School of the Prophets in Kirtland, Ohio. This school was established,  by command of the Lord, for the purpose of educating the Elders and  others in the history of nations, countries and people; thus laying up  treasures of knowledge and useful information.    The Prophet, however, was not dependent upon scholastic learning, for  God revealed to him line upon line, here a little and there a little,  enabling him to become efficient in organizing the Church in its  perfect order; so much so, that the learned theologians and others of  the present day are adopting many of the doctrines revealed to him.    The description of the breast-pate, as given by the mother of Joseph,  is very interesting. She was favored with handling it, but it was  covered with a thin muslin cloth, through which she could see the  glittering gold. It was concave on one side and convex on the other.  It would extend from the neck downwards as far as the center of the  stomach of a man of extraordinary size. Attached to it were four straps  of the same material, for the purpose of fastening it to the breast;  two of these ran back so as to fasten over the shoulders, and the other  two were designed to fasten to the waist. Mother Smith said the straps  were the width of her two fingers, for she measured them. They had  holes in the ends for convenience in fastening. Although the Urim and  Thummim and breast-plate go together, it was not necessary for them  always to remain attached to each other. Mother Lucy Smith also saw and  handled the interpreters, and described them as \"two diamonds set in  silver bows, much like old-fashioned spectacles, only much larger.\" She  also said that the breast plate was worth more than $500.    Soon after Joseph received the plates and other articles, the angel  left him to manage the work entrusted to him, which responsibility  he felt very seriously. He first concealed the secret treasure in a  secluded place, excepting the Urim and Thummim, which he kept with  him. Soon after Joseph arrived at home he explained to his parents the  necessity of keeping the sacred relics under lock and key, and until  such time as proper precaution was taken, he had hidden them away  securely. Then said the mother:    \"Order a chest at once.\"    \"But we have not a dollar in the house to pay for it,\" said Joseph.    \"God will provide, my son,\" said the confidential mother. \"Go, promise  part cash and part trade,\" which was done, and the same day Mrs. Wells,  of Macedon, gave Joseph work at digging a well, promising cash for the  work. The mother reminded the son of the Lord's providence, so soon  fulfilled.    While Joseph was working for Mrs. Wells, to supply their daily wants  and to pay for the chest in which the plates were to be secured, a mob  of twelve men, headed by Mr. Willard Chase, a Methodist class leader,  and a certain conjurer whose special business was to divine the hiding  place of the gold plates, were heard to say:    \"We will have that gold Bible in spite of all the devils in hell.\"    Father Smith, knowing that the plates were secreted away from home,  felt deep anxiety concerning their safety, and he induced Emma, the  Prophet's wife, who was living with the family, to go on horseback to  give warning to Joseph of the intentions of the mob. From an impression  Joseph had, he looked with the Urim and Thummim, which he had with  him, after which, meeting his wife with a smile, he informed her that  the plans of the mob would prove futile; that the plates were safe.  However, he returned home with his wife, and in the evening, after  procuring the chest, Joseph started for the plates, but as he was  returning home with them, he was waylaid and attacked three times, but  he finally escaped, although bruised and weary, bringing the plates  home in safety.    This was one of his first lessons and a fulfillment of the angel's  words to him.    Not long after this first experience, the Prophet was warned of a  second attempt to rob him of the treasure.    On this occasion he remembered the angel's charge in regard to using  every precaution, and the promise that if he was prayerful and careful  he should not lose them. A stone of the old-fashioned hearth was  removed and the plates and the breast-plate were concealed in a cavity  under the hearth. The stone had just been replaced, when a large armed  mob came rushing uproariously around the house. The door was thrown  open and were in the house, Joseph at their head, rushed out, when the  mob fled without their booty. A third attempt to obtain the plates was  also unsuccessfully made. This time the treasures were hid in some flax  in the loft of a cooper shop, and an empty box was hidden under the  floor. It was said that a young woman, aided by a peepstone, pointed  out the cooper shop as the repository of the \"Gold Bible.\" During the  night the place was rummaged, the floor torn up and the box broken  to pieces. This was another experience, but the treasures were still  safely preserved. It was manifested to the Prophet that a facsimile  of characters must be copied and sent to the most learned professors  of the country, and that Martin Harris should be the bearer of them.  Before the Prophet could accomplish this desired object, however, he  was compelled to seek peace in Pennsylvania, for the whole country  around seemed determined to give Joseph no peace whatever. While the  servant of God was on his way from his father's house, to seek a  peaceful retreat, he was stopped on the highway twice by a mob of fifty  men, but as the necessary precaution had been observed by hiding the  plates in a barrel of beans, again they were preserved.    The trying scenes which this young man had to pass through, having been  compelled to leave his home and country by reason of the persecutions  heaped upon him in his young married life, were of a heart-rending  character, besides the labor of translating the Book of Mormon, and  organizing the Church, which he was instructed to do. It became all the  more difficult to perform this great work because new revelation came  so much in contact with the traditions of the different religious sects  of the day, each one differing from the other, yet each one claiming  to be the right Church. Just imagine this unlearned youth, possessing  no funds only as he earned them by his daily labor, under these  circumstances, with increasing responsibilities of family, and home.  Without God's aid it would border on insanity to entertain a faint  hope of success in so stupendous an undertaking. Had it not been that  the Lord had promised to help him, his heart would have failed him by  the way. But there was encouragement found in the words of the prophet  Isaiah, 29th chapter, where the prophet, speaking of the very time and  condition surrounding the youth, used these words:    \"Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this  people, even a marvelous work and a wonder; for the wisdom of their  wise men shall perish ... They also that erred in spirit shall come to  understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.\" (Isaiah  29:14, 24)    Tens of thousands have proven those words to be true. I was personally  favored with many conversations with the three witnesses whom God  raised up, one of whom was Martin Harris, a near neighbor of Joseph  Smith. In 1871, while I was emigrating Martin Harris from Kirkland,  Ohio, during our journey of over 2,000 miles, he related many little  incidents which occurred in those early times.    One of the incidents that interested me most was when, on a certain  occasion, Martin's neighbors prevailed upon him to drink some wine with  them with the evident intention of getting him to deny his testimony  to the Book of Mormon. Martin drank but little, while his neighbors  partook more freely. When they were in high glee they asked him if he  really believed that he saw the angel of which he had testified.    \"No,\" said Martin, \"I do not believe it.\"    \"Now,\" said they, \"we know you are an honest man.\"    \"Stop a moment,\" said Martin, \"and properly understand me. My reason  for not believing it is that knowledge surpasses belief. Gentlemen, it  was in open day when I saw the angel and I testify to you that I know  my testimony is true. I do not believe it is true; I know it is.\"    The reader can imagine the chagrin that his neighbors felt at this  unexpected outcome of their efforts to entrap him.    Martin told me that, knowing the indigent circumstances of the Prophet,  he felt it was his duty to aid in the great work by giving Joseph fifty  dollars to help advance the Lord's work. This occurred just prior to  Joseph's leaving Manchester for Harmony, Penn. The Lord raised tip a  friend in time of need. The Lord remembered Martin for the timely aid,  although it was many days afterwards. Martin also stated that he had  hired Joseph to work for him on his farm many times and paid him fifty  cents per day, which was the usual price paid for hired help at that  time. He also said that he had hoed corn with Joseph often, and that  the latter was a good hand to work.    The Prophet found a short season of rest with his father-in-law at  Harmony, Penn., where he succeeded in copying the seven lines of  characters, which, by a previous arrangement, were taken to Professor  Anthon, of New York, as explained in the next chapter.    Soon after Martin Harris returned from New York, he commenced to write  for the Prophet while he translated from the gold plates. Martin often  related to the writer the mode of translation. He said that the Prophet  possessed a seer stone as well as the Urim and Thummim, by means of  which he could translate the characters. On one occasion Martin placed  in a hat"]]]
