Once more the scurvy was defeated; and, without a doubt, owing to the  intelligent action and untiring supervision of the captain. He gives a  full description of the measures adopted, and while giving full  acknowledgment to the anti-scorbutics with which he was supplied, he is  of opinion that the general sanitary precautions formed the best  prevention. Cleanliness of persons, bedding, clothes, and ship, were  continually enforced. All these were foreign to the sailors of the time,  and extraordinary it is that it was a man born in the lower rank of life,  and brought up in a collier, who had the sense to perceive that in these  lay the surest preventatives against this paralysing scourge.    Cook was promoted to captain--a proud position for the collier boy--and  elected a Fellow of the Royal Society; perhaps even a greater distinction  for a man of his bringing up. He contributed papers on his methods of  preventing scurvy, and on the tides of the Pacific.    He also employed himself in publishing the account of his recent voyage,  the only one which he himself edited.    He was not, however, long at rest. The Admiralty wished to send an  expedition to explore the north-western coasts of North America, and to  examine the Polar Sea from the Bering Straits side, with a view of the  discovery of a north-west passage. Cook seems to have volunteered for the  command without being actually asked, and, needless to say, was at once  accepted.    In February he once more received his commission to command the  Resolution, this time accompanied by the Discovery, a vessel very similar  to the Adventure, his consort during the last voyage. Clerke, a master's  mate in the Endeavour, and second lieutenant in the Resolution, was  appointed as commander to the Discovery. He, like Cook, was fated not to  return from this third journey to the great Pacific.    Others who had sailed with Cook before were ready to accompany him, once  more to encounter privations and find new lands.    Cook's orders were long and detailed, but were to the effect that he was  to proceed by way of the Cape of Good Hope to search in the Indian Ocean  for the land recently seen by M. Kerguelen; thence via Tahiti, on to the  coast of North America in about latitude 45 degrees, which he was to  follow to latitude 65 degrees, searching especially for any channel which  might lead to the north-east, as it was supposed there might be a passage  communicating with Hudson's Bay. He was further to look for any passage  north of North America to the Atlantic, and to make such other  explorations as might seem fit to him. A money reward of 20,000 pounds  was also offered in case of success in finding such a passage.    Chronometers were again carried, and more confidence in them being felt,  more use was made of them.    Cook took with him Omai, a young Society islander, who had induced  Captain Furneaux to take him to England, and whom Cook now engaged to  return to his native country.    The ships sailed on July 11th, 1776, and arrived at Table Bay on October  18th.    Sailing thence on November 30th, he passed and roughly mapped Prince  Edward's, Marion, and Croset's Islands, all of which had been discovered  by Marion de Fresne. He then struck Kerguelen's Land, spent Christmas Day  in one of its harbours, and mapped the eastern side of this large but  desolate island. He was unaware that Kerguelen had visited this island a  second time, and had gained much more information about it than he did in  his first voyage.    Cook had taken on board at the Cape as many cattle, horses, bulls, cows,  goats, and sheep as he could stow, with a view of landing them at Tahiti  or elsewhere, and it is without surprise that we learn that after several  weeks in these stormy seas a good many of them had died. When we consider  the size of the ships the wonder is where they found room for these  animals.    On January 26th the ships arrived in Tasmania, and anchored in Adventure  Bay, principally with a view of getting fodder for the remaining cattle.  Pigs were left here, according to Cook's usual custom.    After four days the ships sailed, and arrived in Queen Charlotte's Sound,  New Zealand, on February 12th, 1777. Here Cook learnt the history of the  attack on the Adventure's boat's crew from the chief who led it, but made  no attempt at reprisals, although urged by many other natives to kill  him. He seems to have been guided by the consideration that, as related  by the natives, it was a dishonest act of barter on the part of one of  the sailors which commenced the disturbance; and that occurring so long  before, no good purpose would be served by punishment. It says much for  his humane treatment of natives.    On leaving this, Cook records that he had at different times left about a  dozen pigs in New Zealand. These increased, and stocked the whole island  by the time the English settlers arrived.    On the way to Tahiti Cook fell across several islands belonging to what  was afterwards called after him, the Cook Group. He visited Mangaia,  Atiu, Takutea,* (* Spelt by Cook Mangeea, Wateeo, and Otakootaia.) and  the Hervey Islands. Relations were established with the natives, and Cook  was much interested at finding on Atiu three natives of the Society  Islands, the survivors of twelve, who had been blown away in a canoe, and  landed on this island, five hundred miles distant. As he remarks, this  throws great light on the manner in which the different islands of the  Pacific have been peopled.    Cook now made up his mind that he was too late to prosecute discovery  this year on the American Continent, it being well into April, and being  anxious to save the remaining cattle that he wished to land at Tahiti,  and which had been taken on board especially for this purpose, the island  being still far to windward, he bore away for the Friendly Islands for  fodder and refreshments. He landed on Palmerston on the way--an island  discovered last voyage--and arrived at Namuka* (* Cook's Anamooka.) on  May 1st, with not a sick man in the ships.    The ships remained in the Friendly Group for two months and a half,  visiting and mapping the different islands, and learning much of the  manners of this interesting race, seeing their great concerted dances,  and the ceremonies of coming of age of the heir to the throne. Cook here  first became acquainted with the mysterious rite of Tabu, which was  closely connected with his own death. A selection of useful animals,  including horses, were left at Tongatabu.    While at the Friendly Islands Cook heard of the Fiji Group, and saw some  of the natives, who had come over in a canoe. The intelligence he was  able to gather concerning them was imperfect, and he saw no reason to  justify a long detour to leeward to search for them, when his object was  to stock the Society Islands with the animals he had. Had he known their  size and importance, his course might possibly have been different. As it  was, he sailed for Tahiti, and discovering Tubuai, one of the Austral  Group, on his passage, arrived there on August 13th, 1777.    Six weeks were spent here, and the old friendships further cemented.  Bulls and cows and other animals were presented to the king. Cook also  attended at several ceremonies consequent on war being declared against  Eimeo, which included the offering of the dead body of a man, previously  killed for the purpose, to the war god. He positively refused to aid in  this war, which very shortly came to an end.    Eimeo was next visited, and here the theft of a goat, which Cook intended  to land at Huaheine, induced him to take severe measures to get it back.  Several war canoes and houses were destroyed before it was returned. At  Huaheine, Omai was established, with many valuable European articles in  his possession. Here again Cook acted with considerable severity in the  case of a thief cutting off his ears, and confining him on board. His  action has been questioned, but considering his humane character, and the  judgment that he always displayed in these questions, we are justified in  believing that he had good reason for departing from his ordinary custom  of mild treatment of natives. At Ulietea, or Raiatea, next visited, a  midshipman and a seaman of the Discovery deserted. Cook took his usual  step of confining some natives of importance, and informing their  relatives that they would be retained until the deserters were returned.  In this case he impounded the king's son and daughter, with the desired  effect, as the stragglers were soon brought back from Bolabola, whither  they had gone; but both Cook and Captain Clerke were nearly captured by  the natives when on shore in the interval.    It is only surprising that more of Cook's people did not attempt to  remain in these pleasant islands. The hardships of the sea press much on  certain natures, and the allurements of the easy and careless life of a  tropical island offered such a contrast, that it scarcely required the  desire of the natives to get white men with their superior knowledge, and  above all superior arms, to remain with them, to induce them to desert.  This last, however, made desertion more easy, and had not Cook taken  strong measures, no doubt the epidemic would have spread.    After visiting Bolabola, Cook sailed north, to prosecute the main object  of his voyage, the exploration of the north-west coast of America. On  December 24th he fell in with Christmas Island, which he so named from  the season. After mapping it, and getting many turtle, he continued his  course to the north, and discovered Atooi or Kauai, the western island of  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8107"],[0,"The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the English (#9)"],[1,"with their facions and maners, was the cause of all the  diuersitie that after ensued. For Cham, by the reason of his naughty  demeanour towarde his father, beyng constrayned to departe with his wyfe  and hys chyldren, planted him selfe in that parte of Arabia, that after was  called by his name. And lefte no trade of religion to his posteritie,  because he none had learned of his father. Whereof it came to passe, that  when in processe of tyme they ware encreased to to many for that londe:  beyng sent out as it ware, swarme aftre swarme into other habitations and  skatered at length into sondrie partes of the worlde (for this banysshed  progeny grewe aboue measure) some fel into errours wherout thei could neuer  vnsnarle [Footnote: _To snarle_, to entangle; hence, _to unsnarle_--to  disentangle. \"And from her head ofte rente her snarled heare.\" _Spencer_,  _Faerie Queene_, iii., xii., 17. \"You snarle yourself into so many and  heynouse absurdities, as you shall never be able to wynde yourself  oute.\"--_Cranmer's Answer to Bp. Gardiner_, p. 168. \"Supposed to be formed  from _snare_.\" [Nares].] themselues. The tongue gan to altre and the  knowledge of the true God and all godlie worsshippe vanished out of mind.  Inso muche that some liued so wildely (as aftre thou shalt here) that it  ware harde to discerne a difference betwixte them and the beastes of the  felde. Thei that flieted into Egipt, wonderyng at the beautie and course of  the Sonne, and the Moone, as though there had been in them a power diuine,  began to worship them as Goddes: callyng the lesse, Isis and the bigger  Osiris. To Iupiter also thei Sacrificed, and did honour as to the  principall of life. To Vulcan for fire, to Pallas, as Lady of the skie, to  Ceres as gouerneresse of the arth, and to sondry other for other sondry  considerations. Neyther staied that darkenesse of iniquitie in Egipte  alone, but where so euer the progeny of Cham stepte in from the begynnyng,  there fell true godlines, all oute of minde and abondage to the deuell  entred his place. And there neuer was countrie, mother of moe swarmes of  people, then that part of Arabia, that he, and his, chase to be theirs. So  greate a mischief did the vntymely banishemente of one manne, bring to the  whole. Contrarily the progenie of Iapheth, and Sem, brought vp to full  yeres vndre their elders, and rightly enstructed: contentyng them selues  with a litle circuite, straied not so wide as this brother had doen.  Whereby it chaunced that the zeale of the truthe, (I meane of good liuyng  and true worshippe of one onely God) remained as hidden in one onely  people, vntill the tyme of Messias.      ¶ The seconde Chapitre.    ¶ The false opinion of the Philosophre concernyng the begynnyng of man.    But the aunciente Philosophers, whiche without knowledge of God, and his  truthe, many yeres ago, wrate vpon the natures of thinges, and thistories  of times had another opinion of the originall of man. For certain of them,  belieued the worlde euer to haue been, and that euer it should be, and man  together with it to haue had no beginnyng. Certaine did holde that it had a  beginnyng, and an ende it should haue, and a time to haue been, when man  was not. For saie thei, the begynner of thynges visible, wrapped vp bothe  heauen and earth at one instant, togither in one paterne, and so a  distinction growing on betwixte these meynte bodies, the worlde to haue  begon in suche ordre as we see. The aire by nature to be continually  mouyng, and the moste firie parte of thesame, for the lightenesse thereof,  moste highe to haue climbed. So that sonne and Moone, and the planetes all,  participatyng of the nature of that lighter substaunce: moue so muche the  faster, in how muche thei are of the more subtile parte. But that whiche  was mixed with waterie moisture, to haue rested in the place, for the  heauinesse thereof, and of the watery partes, the sea to haue comen: and  the matier more compacte to haue passed into a clamminesse firste, and so  into earth. This earth then brought by the heate of the sonne into a more  fastenesse. And after by the same power puffed and swollen in the  vppermoste parte, there gathered manye humours in sondry places, which  drawing to ripenesse enclosed them selues in slymes and in filmes, as in  the maresses of Egipt, and other stondynge waters we often se happen. And  seynge the heate of thaier sokynly warmeth the cold ground and heate meint  [Footnote: Mingled.--A word of Chaucer's time. \"And in one vessel both  together meint.\" _Fletcher's Purple Island_, iv., st. 21.] with moisture is  apt to engendre: it came to passe by the gentle moisture of the night aire,  and the comforting heate of the daie sonne, that those humours so riped,  drawyng vp to the rinde of thearth, as though their tyme of childbirthe  ware come, brake out of their filmes, and deliuered vpon the earth all  maner of liuing thinges. Emong whiche those that had in them moste heate,  became foules into the aire: those that ware of nature more earthie, became  wormes and beastes of sondrie kindes: and where water surmounted, thei  drewe to the elemente of their kinde, and had to name fishes. But  afterwarde the earth beyng more parched by the heate of the Sonne, and the  drouthe of the windes, ceased to bring furthe any mo greate beastes: and  those that ware already brought furthe, (saie thei) mainteined, and  encreased by mutualle engendrure, the varietie, and nombre. And they are of  opinion that in the same wise, men ware engendred in the beginning. And as  nature putte them forth emong other beastes, so liued they at the first an  vnknowen lyfe wyldely emong them, vpon the fruictes, and the herbes of the  fieldes. But the beastes aftre a while waxing noysome vnto them, they ware  forced in commune for eche others sauftie to drawe into companies to  resiste their anoyaunce, one helping another, and to sieke places to make  their abiding in. And where at the firste their speache was confuse, by  litle and litle they sayed it drewe to a distinctenesse, and perfeigthe  difference: in sorte that they ware able to gyue name to all thinges. But  for that they ware diuersely sparckled in diuers partes of the worlde, they  holde also that their speache was as diuers and different. And herof to  haue aftreward risen the diuersitie of lettres. And as they firste  assembled into bandes, so euery bande to haue broughte forthe his nation.  But these men at the firste voide of all helpe and experience of liuyng,  ware bittrely pinched with hongre and colde, before thei could learne to  reserue the superfluous plenty of the Somer, to supply the lacke of Winters  barreinesse, whose bitter blastes, and hongrie pinynges, consumed many of  them. Whiche thing when by experience dere bought, thei had learned: thei  soughte bothe for Caues to defende them fro colde, and began to hourde  fruictes. Then happe found out fire, and reason gaue rule of profite, and  disprofite, and necessitie toke in hand to sette witte to schoole. Who  gatheryng knowledge, and perceiuyng hymself to haue a helpe of his sences,  more skilful then he thought, set hande a woorke, and practised connyng, to  supplie all defaultes, whiche tongue and lettres did enlarge and distribute  abrode.    Thei that had this opinion of the originall of manne, and ascribed not the  same to the prouidence of God, affirmed the Etopiens to haue bene the  firste of all menne. For thei coniectured that the ground of that countrie  lyng nierest the heates of the Sonne must needes first of all other waxe  warme. And the earth at that tyme beyng but clammie and softe, through the  attemperaunce of that moysture and heate, man there first to haue bene  fourmed, and there to haue gladlier enhabited (as natiue and naturall vnto  him) then in any other place, when all places ware as yet straunge, and  vnknowen, whiche aftre men soughte. Beginnyng therfore at them, after I  haue shewed how the worlde is deuided into thre partes (as also this  treatise of myne) and haue spoken a litle of Aphrique, I wyll shewe the  situacion of Aethiope, and the maners of that people, and so forthe of al  other regions and peoples, with suche diligence as we can.      ¶ The thirde Chapitre.    ¶ The deuision and limites of the Earthe.    Those that haue bene before our daies, (as Orosius writeth) are of opinion,  that the circuite of the earth, bordered about with the Occean Sea:  disroundyng hym self, shooteth out thre corner wise, and is also deuided  into thre seuerall partes, Afrike, Asie, and Europe. Afrike is parted from  Asie with the floude of Nilus, whiche comyng fro the Southe, ronneth  through Ethiope into Egipte, where gently sheadyng hymself ouer his  bancques, he leaueth in the countrie a marueilous fertilitie, and passeth  into the middle earth sea, with seuen armes. From Europe it is separate  with the middle earth sea, whiche beginnyng fro the Occean aforesaied: at  the Islande of Gades, and the pileurs of Hercules, passeth not tenne miles  ouer. But further entryng in, semeth to haue shooued of the maigne lande on  bothe sides, and so to haue won a more largenesse. Asie is deuided from  Europe, with Tanais the floude, whiche comyng fro the North, ronneth into  the marshe of Meotis almoste midwaie, and there sincking himself, leaueth  the marshe and Pontus Euxinus, for the rest of the bounde. And to retourne  to Afrike again, the same hauyng Nilus as I saied on the Easte, and on all  other partes, bounded with the sea, is shorter then Europe, but broader  towarde the Occean, where it riseth into mounteigne. And shoryng towarde  the Weste, by litle and litle waxeth more streighte, and cometh at thende  to a narowe poincte. Asmuche as is enhabited therof, is a plentuous soile,  but the great parte of it lieth waste, voide of enhabitauntes, either to  whote [Footnote: Too hot.] for menne to abide, or full of noisome and  venemous vermine, and beastes, or elles so"]]]
