Even so, the jury  disagreed, although the case is usually referred to as an acquittal and  a monument to the sentimentality of juries.    The acquittal of Roland B. Molineux is also recalled as a case where a  man, previously proved guilty, managed to escape. The writer, who  was then an assistant district attorney, made a careful study of the  evidence at the time, and feels confident that the great majority of the  legal profession would agree with him in the opinion that the Court of  Appeals had no choice but to reverse the defendant's first conviction on  account of the most prejudicial error committed at the trial, and that  the jury who acquitted him upon the second occasion had equally no  choice when the case was presented with a proper regard to the rules of  evidence and procedure. Indeed, on the second trial the evidence pointed  almost as convincingly toward another person as toward the defendant.    I have mentioned the Patterson, Thaw, and Molineux trials because they  are cases commonly referred to in support of the general contention  that the jury system is a failure. But I am inclined to believe that  any single judge, bench of judges, or board of commissioners would have  reached the same result as the juries did in these instances.    It is quite true that juries, for rather obvious reasons, are more apt  to acquit in murder cases than in others. In the first place, save where  the defendant obviously belongs to the vicious criminal class, a jury  finds it somewhat difficult to believe, unless overwhelming motive be  shown, that he could have deliberately taken another's life. Thus, with  sound reason, they give great weight to the plea of self-defence which  the accused urges upon them. He is generally the only witness. His story  has to be disproved by circumstantial evidence, if indeed there be any.  Frequently it stands alone as the only account of the homicide. Thus  murder cases are almost always weaker than others, since the chief  witness has been removed by death; while at the same time the nature of  the punishment leads the jury unconsciously to require a higher degree  of proof than in cases where the consequences are less abhorrent. All  this is quite natural and inevitable. Moreover, homicide cases as a rule  are better defended than others, a fact which undoubtedly affects the  result. These considerations apply to all trials for homicide, notorious  or otherwise, the results of which in New York County for ten years are  set forth in the following table:         YEAR     CONVICTIONS   ACQUITTALS  CONVICTIONS   ACQUITTALS                                           PER CENT      PER CENT       1901.........25............17..........60............40       1902.........31............11..........74............26       1903.........42.............8..........84............16       1904.........37............14..........72............28       1905.........32............13..........71............29       1906.........53............22..........70............30       1907.........39............10..........78............22       1908.........35............17..........67............33       1909.........43............11..........80............20       1910.........45............15..........75............25       TOTAL.......382...........138......Av. 74........Av. 27      A popular impression exists at the present time that a man convicted of  murder has but to appeal his case on some technical ground in order to  secure a reversal, and thus escape the consequences of his crime. How  wide of the mark such a belief may be, at least so far as one locality  is concerned, is shown by the fact that in New York State, from 1887 to  1907, there were 169 decisions by the Court of Appeals on appeals from  convictions of murder in the first degree, out of which there were only  twenty-nine reversals. Seven of these defendants were again immediately  tried and convicted, and a second time appealed, upon which occasion  only two were successful, while five had their convictions promptly  affirmed. Thus, so far as the ultimate triumph of justice is concerned,  out of 169 cases in that period the appellants finally succeeded in  twenty-two only.    Since 1902 there have been twenty-seven decisions rendered in  first-degree murder cases by the Court of Appeals, with only three  reversals.* (* Written in 1909.) The more important convictions  throughout the State are affirmed with great regularity.    As to the conduct of such cases, the writer's own experience is that  a murder trial is the most solemn proceeding known to the law. He has  prosecuted at least fifty men for murder, and convicted more than he  cares to remember. Such trials are invariably dignified and deliberate  so far as the conduct of the legal side of the case is concerned.  No judge, however unqualified for the bench; no prosecutor, however  light-minded; no lawyer however callous, fails to feel the serious  nature of the transaction or to be affected strongly by the fact that  he is dealing with life, and death. A prosecutor who openly laughed  or sneered at a prisoner charged with murder would severely injure his  cause. The jury, naturally, are overwhelmed with the gravity of the  occasion and the responsibility resting upon them.    In the Patterson, Thaw, and Molineux cases the evidence, unfortunately,  dealt with unpleasant subjects and at times was revolting, but there was  a quiet propriety in the way in which the witnesses were examined  that rendered it as inoffensive as it could possibly be. Outside the  court-room the vulgar crowd may have spat and sworn; and inside no doubt  there were degenerate men and women who eagerly strained their ears to  catch every item of depravity. But the throngs that filled the courtroom  were quiet and well ordered, and the justified interested outnumbered  the morbid.    The writer deprecates the impulse which leads judges, from a feeling  that justice should be publicly administered, to throw wide the doors  of every courtroom, irrespective of the subject-matter of the trial. We  need have no fear of Star Chamber proceedings in America, and no harm  would be done by excluding from the courtroom all persons who have no  business there.    It is, of course, not unnatural that in the course of a trial occupying  weeks or months the tension should occasionally be relieved by a gleam  of humor. After one has been busy trying a case for a couple of weeks  one goes to court and sets to work in much the same frame of mind in  which one would attack any other business. But the fact that a small  boy sometimes sees something funny at a funeral, or a bevy of giggling  shop-girls may be sitting in the gallery at a fashionable wedding,  argues little in respect to the solemnity or beauty of the service  itself.    What are the celebrated cases--the trials that attract the attention  and interest of the public? In the first place, they are the very cases  which contain those elements most likely to arouse the sympathy and  prejudices of a jury--where a girl has taken the life of her supposed  seducer, or a husband has avenged his wife's alleged dishonor. Such  cases arouse the public imagination for the very reason that every  man realizes that there are two sides to every genuine tragedy of  this character--the legal and the natural. Thus, aside from any other  consideration, they are the obvious instances where justice is most  likely to go astray.    In the next place, the defence is usually in the hands of counsel of  adroitness and ability; for even if the prisoner has no money to pay his  lawyer, the latter is willing to take the case for the advertising he  will get out of it.    Third, a trial which lasts for a long time naturally results in creating  in the jury's mind an exaggerated idea of the prisoner's rights, namely,  the presumption of innocence and the benefit of the reasonable doubt.  For every time that the jury will hear these phrases once in a petty  larceny or forgery case, they will hear them in a lengthy murder trial  a hundred times. They see the defendant day after day, and the relation  becomes more personal. Their responsibility seems greater toward him  than toward the defendant in petty cases.    Last, as previously suggested, murder cases are apt to be inherently  weaker than others, and more often depend upon circumstantial evidence.    The results of such cases are therefore an inadequate test of the  efficiency of a jury system. They are, in fact, the precise cases where,  if at all, the jury might be expected to go wrong.    But juries would go astray far less frequently even in such trials were  it not for that most vicious factor in the administration of criminal  justice--the \"yellow\" journal. For the impression that public trials  are the scenes of buffoonery and brutality is due to the manner in which  these trials are exploited by the sensational papers.    The instant that a sensational homicide occurs, the aim of the editors  of these papers is--not to see that a swift and sure retribution is  visited upon the guilty, or that a prompt and unqualified vindication is  accorded to the innocent, but, on the contrary, so to handle the matter  that as many highly colored \"stories\" as possible can be run about it.    Thus, where the case is perfectly clear against the prisoner, the  \"yellow\" press seeks to bolster up the defence and really to justify  the killing by a thinly disguised appeal to the readers' passions. Not  infrequently, while the editorial page is mourning the prevalence of  homicide, the front columns are bristling with sensational accounts of  the home-coming of the injured husband, the heartbreaking confession of  the weak and erring wife, and the sneering nonchalance of the seducer,  until a public sentiment is created which, if it outwardly deprecates  the invocation of the unwritten law, secretly avows that it would have  done the same"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52819"],[0,"Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 2 of 2) (#9)"],[1,"date Mantua Station, O., April 26, 1873,  three years before Rigdon's death, writes this:        \"Soon after this the great Mormon defection came on us      [Disciples]. Sidney Rigdon preached for us, and notwithstanding      his extravagantly wild freaks, he was held in high repute by many.      For a few months before his professed conversion to Mormonism, it      was noticed that his wild, extravagant propensities had been more      marked. That he knew before of the coming of the Book of Mormon is      to me certain from what he said [during] the first of his visits at      my father's some years before. He gave a wonderful description of      the mounds and other antiquities found in some parts of America,      and said that they must have been made by the aborigines. He said      that there was a book to be published containing an account of      those things. He spoke of these in his eloquent, enthusiastic      style, as being a thing most extraordinary. Though a youth then,      I took him to task for expending so much enthusiasm on such a      subject, instead of things of the gospel.\" [80]    [Footnote 80: \"Early History of the Disciples in the Western Reserve,\"  239-240, copied in \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 13. \"Braden-Kelly  Debate,\" 45.]    Of this statement Rigdon never made a denial.    Dr. S. Rosa, under date of Painsville, O., June 3, 1841, writes, among  other things, this:        \"In the early part of the year 1830, when the Book of Mormon      appeared, [and in November of which year Rigdon was converted],      either in May or June, I was in company with Sidney Rigdon, and      rode with him on horseback a few miles. Our conversation was      principally upon the subject of religion, as he was at that time      a very popular preacher of the denomination calling themselves      'Disciples' or Campbellites. He remarked to me that it was time for      a new religion to spring up; that mankind were all rife and ready      for it. I thought he alluded to the Campbellite doctrine. He said      it would not be long before something would make its appearance;      he also said that he thought of leaving Pennsylvania and should      be absent for some months. I asked him how long. He said it would      depend upon circumstances. I began to think a little strange of his      remarks, as he was a minister of the gospel. I left Ohio that fall      and went to the State of New York to visit my friends who lived in      Waterloo, not far from the mine of golden Bibles. In November I was      informed that my old neighbor, E. Partridge, and the Rev. Sidney      Rigdon, were in Waterloo, and that they both had become the dupes      of Joe Smith's necromancies. It then occurred to me that Rigdon's      new religion had made its appearance, and when I became informed      of the Spaulding manuscript, I was confirmed in the opinion that      Rigdon was at least accessory, if not the principal, in getting up      this farce.\" [81]    [Footnote 81: \"Gleanings by the Way,\" 317. \"Prophet of the Nineteenth  Century,\" 58. \"Early Days of Mormonism,\" 172-3.]    This last article was first published in book form in 1842, thirty-four  years before Rigdon's death, but never publicly denied or explained by  him. Whether this particular letter was published in the _Christian  Observer_ and _Episcopal Recorder_ I cannot say, but other portions of  the same book evidently were, and received comment in a Mormon church  organ. [82] This but emphasizes Rigdon's silence upon Dr. Rosa's letter.    [Footnote 82: _Gospel Reflector_, 19.]    In Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" [83] it is said that Rigdon, during the  incubation period of Mormonism between 1827 and 1830, preached new  matters of doctrine which were afterwards found to be inculcated in  the Mormon Bible. The evident purpose of all this was to prepare his  congregation for the acceptance of Mormonism, and the end was most  successfully achieved. Evidently this and the other circumstances  showing Rigdon's foreknowledge of the forthcoming Book of Mormon, all  combined with a guilty conscience, irresistibly impelled the making  of an explanation tending to allay the suspicion that there was a  conscious purpose in all such conduct. This defense is found in a  revelation to Sidney Rigdon, dated December 7, 1830, at the alleged  first meeting between Rigdon and Smith, and within one month after the  former's conversion. The revelation, in part, says:    [Footnote 83: Page 289. \"Braden-Kelly Debate,\" 45.]        \"Behold thou was sent forth, even as John, _To prepare the way_      before me, and before Elijah which should come, _and thou knewest      it not_.\" [84]    [Footnote 84: Section 35, \"Doctrine and Covenants.\" Supplement 14,  _Millennial Star,_ 50. The exact date of this revelation is December  7th. 1830, according to Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 107.]    That Rigdon did prepare the way we knew before the revelation informed  us of it. That it was done unconsciously we cannot even now believe.    Especially in the light of the foregoing evidence, this revelation  must be construed as much more convincing proof of Rigdon's advance  knowledge of the forthcoming Book of Mormon and its contents than even  a tacit admission.    It is practically an admission of guilty knowledge, coupled with a  transparent effort at warding off the inference of complicity in fraud  by veiling the acts constituting the evidence in an assumed mysticism,  which really deceives few aside from the mystic degenerate and the  willing victim who enters the fold for opportunities to \"fleece the  flock of Christ.\"    III.    FROM RIGDON TO SMITH _via_ P. P. PRATT.    When to this evidence already adduced is added, as will be done,  conclusive proof of the identity of the salient features of the Book  of Mormon and Spaulding's rewritten \"Manuscript Found,\" it would seem  that the case of plagiarism through Rigdon's complicity is established  beyond reasonable doubt. The Mormon objector, however, insists that  no possible connection between Rigdon and Smith has ever been shown  to exist prior to 1830, and that, therefore, even if Rigdon did steal  the manuscript, Smith could not have obtained it for use as a help  in preparing the Book of Mormon. It would seem as if the facts above  recited should, even if unaided by more direct evidence, raise an  almost conclusive presumption of the existence of an undiscovered  connection between the two. But we are not confined to an inference  from such evidence alone. There are still more pointed evidentiary  circumstances to which we will now give attention.    Parley Parker Pratt was born at Burlington, Otsego County, N.Y.,  April 12, 1807, of parents who later resided at Canaan, Columbia  County, N.Y. [85] During his sixth year (1813) he went to reside with  his father's sister, named Van Cott, [86] which name afterward became  conspicuous in the early history of Utah. In 1826 Pratt spent a few  months with an uncle in Wayne (formerly Ontario) County, N. Y. [87]    [Footnote 85: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 17.]    [Footnote 86: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 19.]    [Footnote 87: \"Supplement 14, _Millennial Star_,\" 1.]    This, it will be remembered, is the same county in which Smith was at  that time gaining much newspaper notoriety as a \"peep-stone\" money  digger [88] through mention made of him in papers published in several  counties in southern New York and northern Pennsylvania. [89] While  Smith was thus working the gullible of his neighborhood with his  necromancy, Pratt was a peddler, who, it is said, knew almost everybody  in western New York. [90] At that time Ontario County took in all the  territory of several counties as now bounded, and in 1820 had only a  population of 80,267. [91] Pratt, therefore, could hardly have helped  knowing Smith's fame, which was such as at once to have suggested him  as the star actor in any scheme of fraud requiring a prophet. In view  of Pratt's subsequent connection with the Wells family, [92] who were  Smith's neighbors and friends, [93] it is more than probable that he  knew the Smiths personally in or prior to 1826, although, of course,  they would carefully guard the fact of such acquaintance from publicity  as a most important secret.    [Footnote 88: \"Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism,\" 27.]    [Footnote 89: \"Braden-Kelly Debate,\" 47.]    [Footnote 90: \"Hand Book of Mormonism,\" 3.]    [Footnote 91: Compendium, 11th Census.]    [Footnote 92: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 37.]    [Footnote 93: \"Joseph Smith, the Prophet,\" by Lucy Smith, 101-2-3.]    In October of this year Pratt went to Ohio, locating at Amherst, thirty  miles west of Cleveland [94] and was also located fifty miles west of  Kirtland. [95] One of the temptations inducing Pratt's departure from  New York was to get to a country where, as he himself expresses it,  there is \"no law to sweep [away] all the hard earnings of years to pay  a small debt.\" [96] The ethical status of an average country peddler who  is willing to leave his native state to avoid the payment of his \"small  debts\" furnishes a fertile immorality in which to plant the seeds of  religious imposture.    [Footnote 94: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 27.]    [Footnote 95: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 50.]    [Footnote 96: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 26.]    It will be remembered that it was also in 1826 that Rigdon went for a  second time to reside in Ohio, where he became an itinerant \"Disciple\"  preacher, laboring in the vicinity of Bainbridge, Mantua, Kirtland,  Mentor, Chester, New Lisbon, and Warren, [97] at some of which places  Rigdon had an unsavory reputation. [98] Rigdon and Pratt, therefore,  were in the same neighborhood in 1826, and undoubtedly met soon after.  The date of their first meeting is nowhere given, but may reasonably  be inferred from an address delivered by Parley P. Pratt in 1843 or  '4. In this discourse Pratt tells of an"]]]
