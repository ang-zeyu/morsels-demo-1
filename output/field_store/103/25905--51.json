At the end of March there was a Horse Show. The horses did not  get prizes for mere looks and manners in trotting and cantering,  as here. They must all do something, for the horse is considered  primarily as a war horse; such, for instance, as stopping suddenly  and turning at a word of command. The jumping was excellent,  officers riding in all the events. It was not a function of  \"society,\" but all \"society\" was there and most keenly interested;  for in a warlike country, just as in the Middle Ages, the master's  life may depend upon the qualities of his horse.    I have always been fond of horses and horse-racing, and the  race-tracks about Berlin were always an attraction for me.    Many of the drivers and jockeys were Americans. Taral was a  successful jockey for my father-in-law, Marcus Daly. He is the  trainer of one of the best racing stables in Germany, that of  the brothers Weinberg, who made a fortune in dye-stuffs. \"Pop\"  Campbell, who trained Mr. Daly's Ogden, a Futurity winner, is  also a Berlin trainer. The top notch jockey was Archibald of  California. McCreery, who once trained for one of my brothers,  had the stable which rivalled the Weinbergs', that of Baron  Oppenheim, a rich banker of Cologne.    The German officers are splendid riders and take part in many  races. The Crown Prince himself is a successful jockey and racing  stable owner.    On June fifth, at the annual hunt race, the big steeplechase of  the year, the Emperor himself appeared at the Grünewald track,  occupying his private box, a sort of little house beyond the  finish.    Bookmakers are not allowed in Germany. The betting is in mutual  pools. About seventeen per cent of the money paid is taken by the  Jockey Club, the State and charities, so that the bettor, with  this percentage running always against him, has little chance  of ultimate success.    Many of the races are confined to horses bred in Denmark and the  Central Empires.    All of us in the Embassy joined the Red White Tennis Club situated  in the Grünewald about five miles from the centre of Berlin.  The Crown Prince was a member and often played there. He is an  excellent player, not quite up to championship form, but he can  give a good account of himself in any company short of the top  class. He has the advantage of always finding that the best players  are only too glad to have an opportunity to play with him. At  this Tennis Club during all the period of the feeling of hatred  against America we were treated with, extreme courtesy by all  our German fellow members.    We saw a great deal of the two exchange professors in the winter  of 1913-14, Professor Paul Shorey of the University of Chicago  and Professor Archibald Coolidge of Harvard. These exchange  professors give courses and lectures in the universities and  their first appearance is quite an event. On this first day in  1913, they each delivered a lecture in the University of Berlin,  and on this lecture day Prince August Wilhelm, representing the  Kaiser, attended. The Kaiser used invariably to attend, but of  late years I am afraid has rather lost interest in this enterprise  at first so much favoured by him.    The _Cologne Gazette_ at one time after the commencement  of the war, in an article, expressed great surprise that America  should permit the export of munitions of war to the Allies and  said, quite seriously, that Germany had done everything possible  to win the favour of America, that Roosevelt had been offered a  review of German troops, that the Emperor had invited Americans  who came to Kiel on their yachts to dine with him, and that he  had even sat through the lectures given by American exchange  professors.    Before the war there was but one cable direct from Germany to  America. This cable was owned by a German company and reached  America via the Azore Islands. I endeavoured to obtain permission  for the Western Union Company to land a cable in Germany, but  the opposition of the German company, which did not desire to  have its monopoly interfered with, caused the applications of  the Western Union to be definitely pigeon-holed. In August, 1914,  after the outbreak of the war, when I told this to Ballin of  the Hamburg American Line and von Gwinner, head of the Deutsche  Bank, and when they thought of how much they could have saved  for themselves and Germany and their companies if there had been  an American owned cable landing in Germany, their anger at the  delay on the part of official Germany knew no bounds. Within a  very short time I received an answer from the Foreign Office  granting the application of the Western Union Company, providing  the cable went direct to America. This concession, however, came  too late and, naturally, the Western Union did not take up the  matter during the war.          CHAPTER IV    MILITARISM IN GERMANY AND THE ZABERN AFFAIR    In 1913-1914 occurred a series of events known as the \"Zabern  Affair,\" which to my mind decided the \"system\"--the military  autocracy--for a speedy war. In this affair the German people  appeared at last to be opening their eyes, to recover in some  degree from the panic fear of their neighbours which had made them  submit to the arrogance and exactions of the military caste and to  be almost ready to demilitarise themselves, a thing abhorrent to  the upholders of caste, the system, the army and the Hohenzollerns.    This writing on the wall--these letters forming the word  \"Zabern\"--the actions of the Social Democrats and their growing  boldness, all were warnings to the autocracy of its waning power,  and impelled that autocracy towards war as a bloodletting cure  for popular discontent.    Prussia, which has imposed its will, as well as its methods of  thought and life on all the rest of Germany, is undoubtedly a  military nation.    More than one hundred and twenty-five years ago Mirabeau, the great  French orator at the commencement of the Revolution, said, \"War is  the national industry of Prussia.\" Later, Napoleon remarked that  Prussia \"was hatched from a cannon ball,\" and shortly before the  Franco-Prussian war of 1870 the French military _attaché_, in  reporting to his government, wrote that \"other countries possessed  an army, but in Prussia the army possessed the country.\"    In practice the class of nobles in Prussia owns the army. Officers  may enter the army in two ways, either by enlisting in the regiment,  first as private and then being rapidly promoted to the position  of non-commissioned officer, and then probationary ensign, or  _avantageur_; or the young aspirant may come directly from  a two years' course in one of the cadet schools and enter the  regiment as probationary ensign. In both cases the young officer  is observed by the officers during a period of probation and  can become an officer of that regiment only by the consent of  the regimental officers. In other words, each regiment is like  a club, the officers having the right of black-ball.    This system has practically confined the professional officers to  a class of nobles. It is not at all unusual to find in a regiment  officers whose ancestors were officers of the same regiment two  hundred years or more ago.    In addition to these officers who make the army their career,  a certain number of Germans, after undergoing an enlistment in  the army of one year and two periods of training thereafter,  are made reserve officers. These reserve officers are called to  the colours for manoeuvres and also, of course, when the whole  nation is arrayed in war. These reserve officers seldom attain  a rank higher than that of captain. They may, however, while  exercising civil functions, be promoted, and in this manner the  Chancellor, while occupying civil positions, has gradually been  promoted to the rank of General and von Jagow, during the war, to  the rank of Major. As a rule reserve officers are the one-yearers,  or _Einjähriger_, who, because they have attained a certain  standard of education, serve only one year with the army instead  of the two required from others. The Bavarian army is in a sense  independent of Prussia, but is modelled on the same system.    For years officers of the army, both in the discharge of their  duties and outside, have behaved in a very arrogant way toward  the civil population. Time and again, while I was in Germany  waiting in line at some ticket office, an officer has shoved  himself ahead of all others without even a protest from those  waiting. On one occasion, I went to the races in Berlin with my  brother-in-law and bought a box. While we were out looking at  the horses between the races, a Prussian officer and his wife  seated themselves in our box. I called the attention of one of  the ushers to this, but the usher said that he did not dare ask  a Prussian officer to leave, and it was only after sending for  the head usher and showing him my Jockey Club badge and my pass  as Ambassador, that I was able to secure possession of my own  box.    There have been many instances in Germany where officers having  a slight dispute with civilians have instantly cut the civilian  down. Instances of this kind and the harsh treatment of the Germans  by officers and under-officers, while serving in the army,  undoubtedly created in Germany a spirit of antagonism not only  to the army itself but to the whole military system of Prussia.  Affairs were brought to a head by the so-called Zabern Affair. In  this affair the internal antagonism between the civil population  and professional soldiers, which had assumed great proportions  in a period of long peace, seemed to reach its climax. Of course  this antagonism had increased with the increase in 1913-14 of  the effective strength of the standing army, bringing a material  increase in the numbers of officers and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7245"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 4. (#9)"],[1,"of  the nation.    Just here was the wayside shop of a smith; and now arrived a landed  proprietor who had bought this girl a few miles back, deliverable  here where her irons could be taken off.  They were removed; then  there was a squabble between the gentleman and the dealer as to  which should pay the blacksmith.  The moment the girl was delivered  from her irons, she flung herself, all tears and frantic sobbings,  into the arms of the slave who had turned away his face when she  was whipped.  He strained her to his breast, and smothered her  face and the child's with kisses, and washed them with the rain  of his tears.  I suspected.  I inquired.  Yes, I was right; it was  husband and wife.  They had to be torn apart by force; the girl  had to be dragged away, and she struggled and fought and shrieked  like one gone mad till a turn of the road hid her from sight; and  even after that, we could still make out the fading plaint of those  receding shrieks.  And the husband and father, with his wife and  child gone, never to be seen by him again in life?--well, the look  of him one might not bear at all, and so I turned away; but I knew  I should never get his picture out of my mind again, and there  it is to this day, to wring my heartstrings whenever I think of it.    We put up at the inn in a village just at nightfall, and when  I rose next morning and looked abroad, I was ware where a knight  came riding in the golden glory of the new day, and recognized him  for knight of mine--Sir Ozana le Cure Hardy.  He was in the  gentlemen's furnishing line, and his missionarying specialty was  plug hats.  He was clothed all in steel, in the beautifulest armor  of the time--up to where his helmet ought to have been; but he  hadn't any helmet, he wore a shiny stove-pipe hat, and was ridiculous  a spectacle as one might want to see.  It was another of my  surreptitious schemes for extinguishing knighthood by making it  grotesque and absurd.  Sir Ozana's saddle was hung about with  leather hat boxes, and every time he overcame a wandering knight  he swore him into my service and fitted him with a plug and made  him wear it.  I dressed and ran down to welcome Sir Ozana and  get his news.    \"How is trade?\" I asked.    \"Ye will note that I have but these four left; yet were they sixteen  whenas I got me from Camelot.\"    \"Why, you have certainly done nobly, Sir Ozana.  Where have you  been foraging of late?\"    \"I am but now come from the Valley of Holiness, please you sir.\"    \"I am pointed for that place myself.  Is there anything stirring  in the monkery, more than common?\"    \"By the mass ye may not question it!....  Give him good feed,  boy, and stint it not, an thou valuest thy crown; so get ye lightly  to the stable and do even as I bid....  Sir, it is parlous news  I bring, and--be these pilgrims?  Then ye may not do better, good  folk, than gather and hear the tale I have to tell, sith it  concerneth you, forasmuch as ye go to find that ye will not find,  and seek that ye will seek in vain, my life being hostage for my  word, and my word and message being these, namely: That a hap  has happened whereof the like has not been seen no more but once  this two hundred years, which was the first and last time that  that said misfortune strake the holy valley in that form by  commandment of the Most High whereto by reasons just and causes  thereunto contributing, wherein the matter--\"    \"The miraculous fount hath ceased to flow!\"  This shout burst from  twenty pilgrim mouths at once.    \"Ye say well, good people.  I was verging to it, even when ye spake.\"    \"Has somebody been washing again?\"    \"Nay, it is suspected, but none believe it.  It is thought to be  some other sin, but none wit what.\"    \"How are they feeling about the calamity?\"    \"None may describe it in words.  The fount is these nine days dry.  The prayers that did begin then, and the lamentations in sackcloth  and ashes, and the holy processions, none of these have ceased  nor night nor day; and so the monks and the nuns and the foundlings  be all exhausted, and do hang up prayers writ upon parchment,  sith that no strength is left in man to lift up voice.  And at last  they sent for thee, Sir Boss, to try magic and enchantment; and  if you could not come, then was the messenger to fetch Merlin,  and he is there these three days now, and saith he will fetch that  water though he burst the globe and wreck its kingdoms to accomplish  it; and right bravely doth he work his magic and call upon his  hellions to hie them hither and help, but not a whiff of moisture  hath he started yet, even so much as might qualify as mist upon  a copper mirror an ye count not the barrel of sweat he sweateth  betwixt sun and sun over the dire labors of his task; and if ye--\"    Breakfast was ready.  As soon as it was over I showed to Sir Ozana  these words which I had written on the inside of his hat: \"Chemical  Department, Laboratory extension, Section G. Pxxp.  Send two of  first size, two of No. 3, and six of No. 4, together with the proper  complementary details--and two of my trained assistants.\"  And I said:    \"Now get you to Camelot as fast as you can fly, brave knight, and  show the writing to Clarence, and tell him to have these required  matters in the Valley of Holiness with all possible dispatch.\"    \"I will well, Sir Boss,\" and he was off.        CHAPTER XXII    THE HOLY FOUNTAIN    The pilgrims were human beings.  Otherwise they would have acted  differently.  They had come a long and difficult journey, and now  when the journey was nearly finished, and they learned that the main  thing they had come for had ceased to exist, they didn't do as  horses or cats or angle-worms would probably have done--turn back  and get at something profitable--no, anxious as they had before  been to see the miraculous fountain, they were as much as forty  times as anxious now to see the place where it had used to be.  There is no accounting for human beings.    We made good time; and a couple of hours before sunset we stood  upon the high confines of the Valley of Holiness, and our eyes  swept it from end to end and noted its features.  That is, its  large features.  These were the three masses of buildings.  They  were distant and isolated temporalities shrunken to toy constructions  in the lonely waste of what seemed a desert--and was.  Such a scene  is always mournful, it is so impressively still, and looks so  steeped in death.  But there was a sound here which interrupted  the stillness only to add to its mournfulness; this was the faint  far sound of tolling bells which floated fitfully to us on the  passing breeze, and so faintly, so softly, that we hardly knew  whether we heard it with our ears or with our spirits.    We reached the monastery before dark, and there the males were  given lodging, but the women were sent over to the nunnery.  The  bells were close at hand now, and their solemn booming smote  upon the ear like a message of doom.  A superstitious despair  possessed the heart of every monk and published itself in his  ghastly face.  Everywhere, these black-robed, soft-sandaled,  tallow-visaged specters appeared, flitted about and disappeared,  noiseless as the creatures of a troubled dream, and as uncanny.    The old abbot's joy to see me was pathetic.  Even to tears; but  he did the shedding himself.  He said:    \"Delay not, son, but get to thy saving work.  An we bring not  the water back again, and soon, we are ruined, and the good work  of two hundred years must end.  And see thou do it with enchantments  that be holy, for the Church will not endure that work in her cause  be done by devil's magic.\"    \"When I work, Father, be sure there will be no devil's work  connected with it.  I shall use no arts that come of the devil,  and no elements not created by the hand of God.  But is Merlin  working strictly on pious lines?\"    \"Ah, he said he would, my son, he said he would, and took oath  to make his promise good.\"    \"Well, in that case, let him proceed.\"    \"But surely you will not sit idle by, but help?\"    \"It will not answer to mix methods, Father; neither would it be  professional courtesy.  Two of a trade must not underbid each  other.  We might as well cut rates and be done with it; it would  arrive at that in the end.  Merlin has the contract; no other  magician can touch it till he throws it up.\"    \"But I will take it from him; it is a terrible emergency and the  act is thereby justified.  And if it were not so, who will give  law to the Church?  The Church giveth law to all; and what she  wills to do, that she may do, hurt whom it may.  I will take it  from him; you shall begin upon the moment.\"    \"It may not be, Father.  No doubt, as you say, where power is  supreme, one can do as one likes and suffer no injury; but we poor  magicians are not so situated.  Merlin is a very good magician  in a small way, and has quite a neat provincial reputation.  He  is struggling along, doing the best he can, and it would not be  etiquette for me to take his job until he himself abandons it.\"    The abbot's face lighted.    \"Ah, that is simple.  There are ways to persuade him to abandon it.\"    \"No-no, Father, it skills not, as these people say.  If he were  persuaded against his will, he would load that well with a malicious  enchantment which would balk me until I found out its secret.  It might take a month.  I could set up a little enchantment of  mine which I call the telephone, and he could not find out its  secret in a hundred years.  Yes, you perceive, he might block me  for a month.  Would you like to risk a month in a dry time like this?\"    \"A month!  The mere thought of it maketh me to shudder.  Have it  thy way, my son.  But my heart is heavy with this disappointment.  Leave me, and let me wear my spirit with weariness and waiting,  even as I have done these ten long days, counterfeiting thus  the thing that is called rest, the"]]]
