It wanted but a little consultation to resolve now upon our voyage. The  first design was only to coast it round the island, as well to see if we  could seize upon any vessel fit to embark ourselves in, as also to take  hold of any opportunity which might present for our passing over to the  main; and therefore our resolution was to go on the inside or west shore  of the island, where, at least at one point, the land stretching a great  way to the north-west, the distance is not extraordinary great from the  island to the coast of Africa.    Such a voyage, and with such a desperate crew, I believe was never made,  for it is certain we took the worst side of the island to look for any  shipping, especially for shipping of other nations, this being quite out  of the way; however, we put to sea, after taking all our provisions and  ammunition, bag and baggage, on board; we had made both mast and sail  for our two large periaguas, and the other we paddled along as well as  we could; but when a gale sprung up, we took her in tow.    We sailed merrily forward for several days, meeting with nothing to  interrupt us. We saw several of the natives in small canoes catching  fish, and sometimes we endeavoured to come near enough to speak with  them, but they were always shy and afraid of us, making in for the  shore as soon as we attempted it; till one of our company remembered the  signal of friendship which the natives made us from the south part of  the island, viz., of setting up a long pole, and put us in mind that  perhaps it was the same thing to them as a flag of truce to us. So we  resolved to try it; and accordingly the next time we saw any of their  fishing-boats at sea we put up a pole in our canoe that had no sail, and  rowed towards them. As soon as they saw the pole they stayed for us, and  as we came nearer paddled towards us; when they came to us they showed  themselves very much pleased, and gave us some large fish, of which we  did not know the names, but they were very good. It was our misfortune  still that we had nothing to give them in return; but our artist, of  whom I spoke before, gave them two little thin plates of silver, beaten,  as I said before, out of a piece of eight; they were cut in a diamond  square, longer one way than the other, and a hole punched at one of the  longest corners. This they were so fond of that they made us stay till  they had cast their lines and nets again, and gave us as many fish as we  cared to have.    All this while we had our eyes upon their boats, viewed them very  narrowly, and examined whether any of them were fit for our turn, but  they were poor, sorry things; their sail was made of a large mat, only  one that was of a piece of cotton stuff fit for little, and their ropes  were twisted flags of no strength; so we concluded we were better as  we were, and let them alone. We went forward to the north, keeping the  coast close on board for twelve days together, and having the wind at  east and E.S.E., we made very fresh way. We saw no towns on the shore,  but often saw some huts by the water-side upon the rocks, and always  abundance of people about them, who we could perceive run together to  stare at us.    It was as odd a voyage as ever man went; we were a little fleet of three  ships, and an army of between twenty and thirty as dangerous fellows as  ever they had amongst them; and had they known what we were, they would  have compounded to give us everything we desired to be rid of us.    On the other hand, we were as miserable as nature could well make us to  be, for we were upon a voyage and no voyage, we were bound somewhere and  nowhere; for though we knew what we intended to do, we did really not  know what we were doing. We went forward and forward by a northerly  course, and as we advanced the heat increased, which began to be  intolerable to us, who were on the water, without any covering from heat  or wet; besides, we were now in the month of October, or thereabouts,  in a southern latitude; and as we went every day nearer the sun, the sun  came also every day nearer to us, till at last we found ourselves in the  latitude of 20 degrees; and having passed the tropic about five or six  days before that, in a few days more the sun would be in the zenith,  just over our heads.    Upon these considerations we resolved to seek for a good place to go on  shore again, and pitch our tents, till the heat of the weather abated.  We had by this time measured half the length of the island, and were  come to that part where the shore tending away to the north-west,  promised fair to make our passage over to the mainland of Africa much  shorter than we expected. But, notwithstanding that, we had good reason  to believe it was about 120 leagues.    So, the heats considered, we resolved to take harbour; besides, our  provisions were exhausted, and we had not many days' store left.  Accordingly, putting in for the shore early in the morning, as we  usually did once in three or four days for fresh water, we sat down and  considered whether we would go on or take up our standing there; but  upon several considerations, too long to repeat here, we did not like  the place, so we resolved to go on a few days longer.    After sailing on N.W. by N. with a fresh gale at S.E., about six days,  we found, at a great distance, a large promontory or cape of land,  pushing out a long way into the sea, and as we were exceeding fond of  seeing what was beyond the cape, we resolved to double it before we took  into harbour, so we kept on our way, the gale continuing, and yet it  was four days more before we reached the cape. But it is not possible  to express the discouragement and melancholy that seized us all when  we came thither; for when we made the headland of the cape, we were  surprised to see the shore fall away on the other side as much as it had  advanced on this side, and a great deal more; and that, in short, if we  would venture over to the shore of Africa, it must be from hence, for  that if we went further, the breadth of the sea still increased, and to  what breadth it might increase we knew not.    While we mused upon this discovery, we were surprised with very bad  weather, and especially violent rains, with thunder and lightning,  most unusually terrible to us. In this pickle we run for the shore, and  getting under the lee of the cape, run our frigates into a little creek,  where we saw the land overgrown with trees, and made all the haste  possible to get on shore, being exceeding wet, and fatigued with the  heat, the thunder, lightning, and rain.    Here we thought our case was very deplorable indeed, and therefore our  artist, of whom I have spoken so often, set up a great cross of wood on  the hill which was within a mile of the headland, with these words, but  in the Portuguese language:--    \"Point Desperation. Jesus have mercy.\"    We set to work immediately to build us some huts, and to get our clothes  dried; and though I was young and had no skill in such things, yet I  shall never forget the little city we built, for it was no less, and we  fortified it accordingly; and the idea is so fresh in my thought, that I  cannot but give a short description of it.    Our camp was on the south side of a little creek on the sea, and under  the shelter of a steep hill, which lay, though on the other side of  the creek, yet within a quarter of a mile of us, N.W. by N., and very  happily intercepted the heat of the sun all the after part of the day.  The spot we pitched on had a little fresh water brook, or a stream  running into the creek by us; and we saw cattle feeding in the plains  and low ground east and to the south of us a great way.    Here we set up twelve little huts like soldiers' tents, but made of the  boughs of trees stuck in the ground, and bound together on the top  with withies, and such other things as we could get; the creek was our  defence on the north, a little brook on the west, and the south and east  sides were fortified with a bank, which entirely covered our huts; and  being drawn oblique from the north-west to the south-east, made our city  a triangle. Behind the bank or line our huts stood, having three other  huts behind them at a good distance. In one of these, which was a little  one, and stood further off, we put our gunpowder, and nothing else, for  fear of danger; in the other, which was bigger, we dressed our victuals,  and put all our necessaries; and in the third, which was biggest of all,  we ate our dinners, called our councils, and sat and diverted ourselves  with such conversation as we had one with another, which was but  indifferent truly at that time.    Our correspondence with the natives was absolutely necessary, and our  artist the cutler having made abundance of those little diamond-cut  squares of silver, with these we made shift to traffic with the black  people for what we wanted; for indeed they were pleased wonderfully with  them, and thus we got plenty of provisions. At first, and in particular,  we got about fifty head of black cattle and goats, and our cook's mate  took care to cure them and dry them, salt and preserve them for our  grand supply; nor was this hard to do, the salt and saltpetre being very  good, and the sun excessively hot; and here we lived about four months.    The southern solstice was over, and the sun gone back towards the  equinoctial, when we considered of our next adventure, which was to go  over the sea of Zanguebar, as the Portuguese call it, and to land, if  possible, upon the continent of Africa.    We talked"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6440"],[0,"Elsie Dinsmore (#9)"],[1,"had gone down to the kitchen to talk over  the arrival, not doubting that her darling was supremely happy in the  possession of her long looked-for parent.    And so the little girl lay there with her crushed and bleeding heart,  sobbing, mourning, weeping as though she would weep her very life away,  without an earthly friend to speak one word of comfort.    \"O papa, papa!\" she sobbed, \"my own papa, you do not love me; me, your  own little girl. Oh! my heart will break. O mamma, mamma! if I could  only go to you; for there is no one here to love me, and I am so  lonely, oh! _so_ lonely and desolate.\"    And thus Chloe found her, when she came in an hour later, weeping and  sobbing out such broken exclamations of grief and anguish.    She was much surprised, but comprehending at once how her child was  suffering, she raised her up in her strong arms, and laying the little  head lovingly against her bosom, she smoothed the tangled hair, kissed  the tear-swollen eyes, and bathed the throbbing temples, saying, \"My  precious pet, my darlin' chile, your ole mammy loves you better dan  life; an' did my darlin' forget de almighty Friend dat says, _I_ have  loved thee with an everlasting love,' an' 'I will never leave thee, nor  forsake thee'? He sticks closer dan a brudder, precious chile, and  says,'though a woman forget her sucking child, He will not forget _His_  chillen.' Mothers love dere chillens better dan fathers, darlin', and  so you see Jesus' love is better dan all other love; and I _knows_ you  hes got dat.\"    \"O mammy! ask Him to take me to Himself, and to mamma--for oh! I am  very lonely, and I want to die!\"    \"Hush, hush, darlin'; old Chloe nebber could ask dat; dis ole heart  would break for sure. Yous all de world to your old mammy, darlin'; and  you know we must all wait de Lord's time.\"    \"Then ask Him to help me to be patient,\" she said, in a weary tone.  \"And O mammy!\" she added, with a burst of bitter tears, \"ask Him to  make my father love me.\"    \"I will, darlin', I will,\" sobbed Chloe, pressing the little form  closer to her heart; \"an' don't you go for to be discouraged right  away; for I'se sure Massa Horace must love you, fore long.\"    The tea-bell rang, and the family gathered about the table; but one  chair remained unoccupied.    \"Where is Miss Elsie?\" asked Adelaide of one of the servants.    \"Dunno, missus,\" was the reply.    \"Well, then, go and see,\" said Adelaide; \"perhaps she did not hear the  bell.\"    The servant returned in a moment, saying that Miss Elsie had a bad  headache and did not want any supper. Mr. Horace Dinsmore paused in the  conversation he was carrying on with his father, to listen to the  servant's announcement. \"I hope she is not a sickly child,\" said he,  addressing Adelaide; \"is she subject to such attacks?\"    \"Not very,\" replied his sister dryly, for she had seen the meeting, and  felt really sorry for Elsie's evident disappointment; \"I imagine crying  has brought this on.\"    He colored violently, and said in a tone of great displeasure, \"Truly,  the return of a parent _is_ a cause for grief; yet I hardly expected my  presence to be quite so distressing to my only child. I had no idea  that she had already learned to dislike me so thoroughly.\"    \"She doesn't,\" said Adelaide, \"she has been looking and longing for  your return ever since I have known her.\"    \"Then she has certainly been disappointed in me; her grief is not at  all complimentary, explain it as you will.\"    Adelaide made no reply, for she saw that he was determined to put an  unfavorable construction upon Elsie's conduct, and feared that any  defence she could offer would only increase his displeasure.    It was a weary, aching head the little girl laid upon her pillow that  night, and the little heart was sad and sore; yet she was not  altogether comfortless, for she had turned in her sorrow to Him who has  said, \"Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them  not,\" and she had the sweet assurance of _His_ love and favor.    It was with a trembling heart, hoping yet fearing, longing and yet  dreading to see her father, that Elsie descended to the breakfast-room  the next morning. She glanced timidly around, but he was not there.    \"Where is papa, Aunt Adelaide?\" she asked.    \"He is not coming down to breakfast, as he feels quite fatigued with  his journey,\" replied her aunt; \"so you will not see him this morning,  and perhaps not at all to-day, for there will be a good deal of company  here this afternoon and evening.\"    Elsie sighed, and looked sadly disappointed. She found it very  difficult to attend to her lessons that morning, and every time the  door opened she started and looked up, half hoping it might be her papa.    But he did not come; and when the dinner hour arrived, the children  were told that they were to dine in the nursery, on account of the  large number of guests to be entertained in the dining-room. The  company remained until bedtime; she was not called down to the parlor;  and so saw nothing of her father that day.    But the next morning Chloe told her the children were to breakfast with  the family, as all the visitors had left excepting one or two  gentlemen. So Elsie went down to the breakfast-room, where, to her  surprise, she found her papa sitting alone, reading the morning paper.    He looked up as she entered.    \"Good-morning, papa,\" she said, in half-trembling tones.    He started a little--for it was the first time he had ever been  addressed by that title, and it sounded strange to his ears--gave her a  glance of mingled curiosity and interest, half held out his hand, but  drawing it back again, simply said, \"Good-morning, Elsie,\" and returned  to his paper.    Elsie stood irresolutely in the middle of the floor, wanting, yet not  daring to go to him.    But just at that instant the door opened, and Enna, looking rosy and  happy, came running in, and rushing up to her brother, climbed upon his  knee, and put her arms around his neck, saying, \"Good-morning, brother  Horace. I want a kiss.\"    \"You shall have it, little pet,\" said he, throwing down his paper.    Then, kissing her several times and hugging her in his arms, he said,  \"_You_ are not afraid of me, are you? nor sorry that I have come home?\"    \"No, indeed,\" said Enna.    He glanced at Elsie as she stood looking at them, her large soft eyes  full of tears. She could not help feeling that Enna had her place, and  was receiving the caresses that should have been lavished upon herself.    \"Jealous,\" thought her father; \"I cannot bear jealous people;\" and he  gave her a look of displeasure that cut her to the heart, and she  turned quickly away and left the room to hide the tears she could no  longer keep back.    \"I am envious,\" she thought, \"jealous of Enna. Oh! how wicked!\" And she  prayed silently, \"Dear Saviour, help me! take away these sinful  feelings.\"    Young as she was, she was learning to have some control over her  feelings, and in a few moments she had so far recovered her composure  as to be able to return to the breakfast-room and take her place at the  table, where the rest were already seated, her sweet little face sad  indeed and bearing the traces of tears, but quite calm and peaceful.    Her father took no further notice of her, and she did not dare trust  herself to look at him. The servants filled her plate, and she ate in  silence, feeling it a great relief that all were too busily engaged in  talking and eating to pay any attention to her. She scarcely raised her  eyes from her plate, and did not know how often a strange gentleman,  who sat nearly opposite, fixed his upon her.    As she left the room at the conclusion of the meal, he asked, while  following her with his eyes, \"Is that one of your sisters, Dinsmore?\"    \"No,\" said he, coloring slightly; \"she is my daughter.\"    \"Ah, indeed!\" said his friend. \"I remember to have heard that you had a  child, but had forgotten it. Well, you have no reason to be ashamed of  her; she is lovely, perfectly lovely! has the sweetest little face I  ever saw.\"    \"Will you ride, Travilla?\" asked Mr. Dinsmore hastily, as though  anxious to change the subject.    \"I don't care if I do,\" was the reply, and they went out together.    Some hours later in the day Elsie was at the piano in the music-room  practising, when a sudden feeling that some one was in the room caused  her to turn and look behind her.    Mr. Travilla was standing there.    \"Excuse me,\" said he, bowing politely, \"but I heard the sound of the  instrument, and, being very fond of music, I ventured to walk in.\"    Elsie was very modest, and rather timid, too, but also very polite; so  she said, \"No excuse is necessary; but will you not take a seat, sir?  though I fear my music will not afford you any pleasure, for you know I  am only a little girl, and cannot play very well yet.\"    \"Thank you,\" said he, taking a seat by her side. \"And now will you do  me the favor to repeat the song I heard you singing a few moments  since?\"    Elsie immediately complied, though her cheeks burned, and her voice  trembled at first from embarrassment; but it grew stronger as she  proceeded and in the last verse was quite steady and full. She had a  very fine voice for a child of her age; its sweetness was remarkable  both in singing and speaking; and she had also a good deal of musical  talent, which had been well cultivated, for she had had good teachers,  and had practised with great patience and perseverance. Her music was  simple, as suited her years, but her performance of it was very good  indeed.    Mr. Travilla thanked her very heartily, and complimented her singing;  then asked for another and another song, another and another piece,  chatting with her about each, until they grew quite familiar, and Elsie  lost all feeling of embarrassment.    \"Elsie, I think, is your name, is it not?\" he asked after a little.    \"Yes, sir,\" said she, \"Elsie Dinsmore.\"    \"And"]]]
