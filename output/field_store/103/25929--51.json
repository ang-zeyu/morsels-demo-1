Morisseau, will you give orders to the sergeant not to let him out of his  sight and to blow out his brains if he tries to get away? Sergeant, we rely  on you! Put a bullet into him, if necessary!...\"    He hurried up the stairs, followed by Hortense and the chief inspector, who  was protesting rather peevishly:    \"But, I say, look here, it wasn't he who set the place on fire! How do you  make out that he set it on fire, seeing that he never left us?\"    \"Why, he set it on fire beforehand, to be sure!\"    \"How? I ask you, how?\"    \"How do I know? But a fire doesn't break out like that, for no reason at  all, at the very moment when a man wants to burn compromising papers.\"    They heard a commotion upstairs. It was the waiters of the restaurant  trying to burst the door open. An acrid smell filled the well of the  stair-case.    Renine reached the top floor:    \"By your leave, friends. I have the key.\"    He inserted it in the lock and opened the door.    He was met by a gust of smoke so dense that one might well have supposed  the whole floor to be ablaze. Renine at once saw that the fire had gone out  of its own accord, for lack of fuel, and that there were no more flames:    \"M. Morisseau, you won't let any one come in with us, will you? An intruder  might spoil everything. Bolt the door, that will be best.\"    He stepped into the front room, where the fire had obviously had its chief  centre. The furniture, the walls and the ceiling, though blackened by the  smoke, had not been touched. As a matter of fact, the fire was confined to  a blaze of papers which was still burning in the middle of the room, in  front of the window.    Renine struck his forehead:    \"What a fool I am! What an unspeakable ass!\"    \"Why?\" asked the inspector.    \"The hat-box, of course! The cardboard hat-box which was standing on the  table. That's where he hid the notes. They were there all through our  search.\"    \"Impossible!\"    \"Why, yes, we always overlook that particular hiding-place, the one just  under our eyes, within reach of our hands! How could one imagine that a  thief would leave sixty thousand francs in an open cardboard box, in which  he places his hat when he comes in, with an absent-minded air? That's just  the one place we don't look in.... Well played, M. Dutreuil!\"    The inspector, who remained incredulous, repeated:    \"No, no, impossible! We were with him and he could not have started the  fire himself.\"    \"Everything was prepared beforehand on the supposition that there might be  an alarm.... The hat-box ... the tissue paper ... the bank-notes: they must  all have been steeped in some inflammable liquid. He must have thrown a  match, a chemical preparation or what not into it, as we were leaving.\"    \"But we should have seen him, hang it all! And then is it credible that  a man who has committed a murder for the sake of sixty thousand francs  should do away with the money in this way? If the hiding-place was such  a good one--and it was, because we never discovered it--why this useless  destruction?\"    \"He got frightened, M. Morisseau. Remember that his head is at stake  and he knows it. Anything rather than the guillotine; and they--the  bank-notes--were the only proof which we had against him. How could he  have left them where they were?\"    Morisseau was flabbergasted:    \"What! The only proof?\"    \"Why, obviously!\"    \"But your witnesses? Your evidence? All that you were going to tell the  chief?\"    \"Mere bluff.\"    \"Well, upon my word,\" growled the bewildered inspector, \"you're a cool  customer!\"    \"Would you have taken action without my bluff?\"    \"No.\"    \"Then what more do you want?\"    Renine stooped to stir the ashes. But there was nothing left, not even  those remnants of stiff paper which still retain their shape.    \"Nothing,\" he said. \"It's queer, all the same! How the deuce did he manage  to set the thing alight?\"    He stood up, looking attentively about him. Hortense had a feeling that he  was making his supreme effort and that, after this last struggle in the  dark, he would either have devised his plan of victory or admit that he was  beaten.    Faltering with anxiety, she asked:    \"It's all up, isn't it?\"    \"No, no,\" he said, thoughtfully, \"it's not all up. It was, a few seconds  ago. But now there is a gleam of light ... and one that gives me hope.\"    \"God grant that it may be justified!\"    \"We must go slowly,\" he said. \"It is only an attempt, but a fine, a very  fine attempt; and it may succeed.\"    He was silent for a moment; then, with an amused smile and a click of the  tongue, he said:    \"An infernally clever fellow, that Dutreuil! His trick of burning the  notes: what a fertile imagination! And what coolness! A pretty dance the  beggar has led me! He's a master!\"    He fetched a broom from the kitchen and swept a part of the ashes into the  next room, returning with a hat-box of the same size and appearance as the  one which had been burnt. After crumpling the tissue paper with which it  was filled, he placed the hat-box on the little table and set fire to it  with a match.    It burst into flames, which he extinguished when they had consumed half  the cardboard and nearly all the paper. Then he took from an inner pocket  of his waistcoat a bundle of bank-notes and selected six, which he burnt  almost completely, arranging the remains and hiding the rest of the notes  at the bottom of the box, among the ashes and the blackened bits of paper:    \"M. Morisseau,\" he said, when he had done, \"I am asking for your assistance  for the last time. Go and fetch Dutreuil. Tell him just this: 'You are  unmasked. The notes did not catch fire. Come with me.' And bring him up  here.\"    Despite his hesitation and his fear of exceeding his instructions from the  head of the detective service, the chief-inspector was powerless to throw  off the ascendancy which Renine had acquired over him. He left the room.    Renine turned to Hortense:    \"Do you understand my plan of battle?\"    \"Yes,\" she said, \"but it's a dangerous experiment. Do you think that  Dutreuil will fall into the trap?\"    \"Everything depends on the state of his nerves and the degree of  demoralization to which he is reduced. A surprise attack may very well do  for him.\"    \"Nevertheless, suppose he recognizes by some sign that the box has been  changed?\"    \"Oh, of course, he has a few chances in his favour! The fellow is much more  cunning than I thought and quite capable of wriggling out of the trap.  On the other hand, however, how uneasy he must be! How the blood must be  buzzing in his ears and obscuring his sight! No, I don't think that he will  avoid the trap.... He will give in.... He will give in....\"    They exchanged no more words. Renine did not move. Hortense was stirred to  the very depths of her being. The life of an innocent man hung trembling in  the balance. An error of judgment, a little bad luck ... and, twelve hours  later, Jacques Aubrieux would be put to death. And together with a horrible  anguish she experienced, in spite of all, a feeling of eager curiosity.  What was Prince Renine going to do? What would be the outcome of the  experiment on which he was venturing? What resistance would Gaston Dutreuil  offer? She lived through one of those minutes of superhuman tension in  which life becomes intensified until it reaches its utmost value.    They heard footsteps on the stairs, the footsteps of men in a hurry. The  sound drew nearer. They were reaching the top floor.    Hortense looked at her companion. He had stood up and was listening, his  features already transfigured by action. The footsteps were now echoing in  the passage. Then, suddenly, he ran to the door and cried:    \"Quick! Let's make an end of it!\"    Two or three detectives and a couple of waiters entered. He caught hold of  Dutreuil in the midst of the detectives and pulled him by the arm, gaily  exclaiming:    \"Well done, old man! That trick of yours with the table and the  water-bottle was really splendid! A masterpiece, on my word! Only, it  didn't come off!\"    \"What do you mean? What's the matter?\" mumbled Gaston Dutreuil, staggering.    \"What I say: the fire burnt only half the tissue-paper and the hat-box;  and, though some of the bank-notes were destroyed, like the tissue-paper,  the others are there, at the bottom.... You understand? The long-sought  notes, the great proof of the murder: they're there, where you hid them....  As chance would have it, they've escaped burning.... Here, look: there  are the numbers; you can check them.... Oh, you're done for, done for, my  beauty!\"    The young man drew himself up stiffly. His eyelids quivered. He did not  accept Renine's invitation to look; he examined neither the hat-box nor  the bank-notes. From the first moment, without taking the time to reflect  and before his instinct could warn him, he believed what he was told and  collapsed heavily into a chair, weeping.    The surprise attack, to use Renine's expression, had succeeded. On seeing  all his plans baffled and the enemy master of his secrets, the wretched man  had neither the strength nor the perspicacity necessary to defend himself.  He threw up the sponge.    Renine gave him no time to breathe:    \"Capital! You're saving your head; and that's all, my good youth! Write  down your confession and get it off your chest. Here's a fountain-pen....  The luck has been against you, I admit. It was devilishly well thought  out, your trick of the last moment. You had the bank-notes which were in  your way and which you wanted to destroy. Nothing simpler. You take a big,  round-bellied water-bottle and stand it on the window-sill. It acts as  a burning-glass, concentrating the rays of the sun on the cardboard and  tissue-paper, all nicely prepared. Ten minutes later, it bursts into  flames. A splendid idea! And, like all great discoveries, it came quite  by chance,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/792"],[0,"Wieland; Or, The Transformation: An American Tale (#9)"],[1,"as well as I am able. But say not a word to Catharine. Her strength of  mind is inferior to your's. She will, besides, have more reason to be  startled. She is Wieland's angel.\"    Pleyel proceeded to inform me, for the first time, of the scheme which  he had pressed, with so much earnestness, on my brother. He enumerated  the objections which had been made, and the industry with which he  had endeavoured to confute them. He mentioned the effect upon his  resolutions produced by the failure of a letter. \"During our late walk,\"  continued he, \"I introduced the subject that was nearest my heart.  I re-urged all my former arguments, and placed them in more forcible  lights. Wieland was still refractory. He expatiated on the perils of  wealth and power, on the sacredness of conjugal and parental duties, and  the happiness of mediocrity.    \"No wonder that the time passed, unperceived, away. Our whole souls were  engaged in this cause. Several times we came to the foot of the rock;  as soon as we perceived it, we changed our course, but never failed to  terminate our circuitous and devious ramble at this spot. At length your  brother observed, 'We seem to be led hither by a kind of fatality. Since  we are so near, let us ascend and rest ourselves a while. If you are not  weary of this argument we will resume it there.'    \"I tacitly consented. We mounted the stairs, and drawing the sofa in  front of the river, we seated ourselves upon it. I took up the thread of  our discourse where we had dropped it. I ridiculed his dread of the sea,  and his attachment to home. I kept on in this strain, so congenial with  my disposition, for some time, uninterrupted by him. At length, he said  to me, \"Suppose now that I, whom argument has not convinced, should  yield to ridicule, and should agree that your scheme is eligible; what  will you have gained? Nothing. You have other enemies beside myself to  encounter. When you have vanquished me, your toil has scarcely begun.  There are my sister and wife, with whom it will remain for you to  maintain the contest. And trust me, they are adversaries whom all your  force and stratagem will never subdue.\" I insinuated that they would  model themselves by his will: that Catharine would think obedience her  duty. He answered, with some quickness, \"You mistake. Their concurrence  is indispensable. It is not my custom to exact sacrifices of this kind.  I live to be their protector and friend, and not their tyrant and foe.  If my wife shall deem her happiness, and that of her children, most  consulted by remaining where she is, here she shall remain.\" \"But,\" said  I, \"when she knows your pleasure, will she not conform to it?\" Before  my friend had time to answer this question, a negative was clearly and  distinctly uttered from another quarter. It did not come from one side  or the other, from before us or behind. Whence then did it come? By  whose organs was it fashioned?    \"If any uncertainty had existed with regard to these particulars, it  would have been removed by a deliberate and equally distinct repetition  of the same monosyllable, \"No.\" The voice was my sister's. It appeared  to come from the roof. I started from my seat. Catharine, exclaimed I,  where are you? No answer was returned. I searched the room, and the  area before it, but in vain. Your brother was motionless in his seat.  I returned to him, and placed myself again by his side. My astonishment  was not less than his.\"    \"Well,\" said he, at length, \"What think you of this? This is the  self-same voice which I formerly heard; you are now convinced that my  ears were well informed.\"    \"Yes,\" said I, \"this, it is plain, is no fiction of the fancy.\" We again  sunk into mutual and thoughtful silence. A recollection of the hour, and  of the length of our absence, made me at last propose to return. We  rose up for this purpose. In doing this, my mind reverted to the  contemplation of my own condition. \"Yes,\" said I aloud, but without  particularly addressing myself to Wieland, \"my resolution is taken. I  cannot hope to prevail with my friends to accompany me. They may doze  away their days on the banks of Schuylkill, but as to me, I go in the  next vessel; I will fly to her presence, and demand the reason of this  extraordinary silence.\"    \"I had scarcely finished the sentence, when the same mysterious voice  exclaimed, \"You shall not go. The seal of death is on her lips. Her  silence is the silence of the tomb.\" Think of the effects which accents  like these must have had upon me. I shuddered as I listened. As soon as  I recovered from my first amazement, \"Who is it that speaks?\" said I,  \"whence did you procure these dismal tidings?\" I did not wait long for  an answer. \"From a source that cannot fail. Be satisfied. She is dead.\"  You may justly be surprised, that, in the circumstances in which I heard  the tidings, and notwithstanding the mystery which environed him by whom  they were imparted, I could give an undivided attention to the facts,  which were the subject of our dialogue. I eagerly inquired, when and  where did she die? What was the cause of her death? Was her death  absolutely certain? An answer was returned only to the last of these  questions. \"Yes,\" was pronounced by the same voice; but it now sounded  from a greater distance, and the deepest silence was all the return made  to my subsequent interrogatories.    \"It was my sister's voice; but it could not be uttered by her; and yet,  if not by her, by whom was it uttered? When we returned hither, and  discovered you together, the doubt that had previously existed was  removed. It was manifest that the intimation came not from her. Yet if  not from her, from whom could it come? Are the circumstances attending  the imparting of this news proof that the tidings are true? God forbid  that they should be true.\"    Here Pleyel sunk into anxious silence, and gave me leisure to ruminate  on this inexplicable event. I am at a loss to describe the sensations  that affected me. I am not fearful of shadows. The tales of apparitions  and enchantments did not possess that power over my belief which could  even render them interesting. I saw nothing in them but ignorance and  folly, and was a stranger even to that terror which is pleasing. But  this incident was different from any that I had ever before known. Here  were proofs of a sensible and intelligent existence, which could not  be denied. Here was information obtained and imparted by means  unquestionably super-human.    That there are conscious beings, beside ourselves, in existence, whose  modes of activity and information surpass our own, can scarcely be  denied. Is there a glimpse afforded us into a world of these superior  beings? My heart was scarcely large enough to give admittance to  so swelling a thought. An awe, the sweetest and most solemn that  imagination can conceive, pervaded my whole frame. It forsook me not  when I parted from Pleyel and retired to my chamber. An impulse was  given to my spirits utterly incompatible with sleep. I passed the night  wakeful and full of meditation. I was impressed with the belief of  mysterious, but not of malignant agency. Hitherto nothing had occurred  to persuade me that this airy minister was busy to evil rather than to  good purposes. On the contrary, the idea of superior virtue had always  been associated in my mind with that of superior power. The warnings  that had thus been heard appeared to have been prompted by beneficent  intentions. My brother had been hindered by this voice from ascending  the hill. He was told that danger lurked in his path, and his obedience  to the intimation had perhaps saved him from a destiny similar to that  of my father.    Pleyel had been rescued from tormenting uncertainty, and from the  hazards and fatigues of a fruitless voyage, by the same interposition.  It had assured him of the death of his Theresa.    This woman was then dead. A confirmation of the tidings, if true, would  speedily arrive. Was this confirmation to be deprecated or desired?  By her death, the tie that attached him to Europe, was taken away.  Henceforward every motive would combine to retain him in his native  country, and we were rescued from the deep regrets that would accompany  his hopeless absence from us. Propitious was the spirit that imparted  these tidings. Propitious he would perhaps have been, if he had been  instrumental in producing, as well as in communicating the tidings of  her death. Propitious to us, the friends of Pleyel, to whom has thereby  been secured the enjoyment of his society; and not unpropitious to  himself; for though this object of his love be snatched away, is there  not another who is able and willing to console him for her loss?    Twenty days after this, another vessel arrived from the same port. In  this interval, Pleyel, for the most part, estranged himself from his old  companions. He was become the prey of a gloomy and unsociable grief.  His walks were limited to the bank of the Delaware. This bank is an  artificial one. Reeds and the river are on one side, and a watery marsh  on the other, in that part which bounded his lands, and which extended  from the mouth of Hollander's creek to that of Schuylkill. No scene can  be imagined less enticing to a lover of the picturesque than this. The  shore is deformed with mud, and incumbered with a forest of reeds. The  fields, in most seasons, are mire; but when they afford a firm footing,  the ditches by which they are bounded and intersected, are mantled with  stagnating green, and emit the most noxious exhalations. Health is no  less a stranger to those seats than pleasure. Spring and autumn are sure  to be accompanied with agues and bilious remittents.    The scenes which environed our dwellings at Mettingen constituted the  reverse of this. Schuylkill was here a pure and translucid current,  broken into wild and ceaseless music by rocky points, murmuring on a  sandy"]]]
