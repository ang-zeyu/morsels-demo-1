This statement that the Latter-day Saints were endeavoring to get  beyond the jurisdiction of the United States, which is repeated so  often by anti-\"Mormon\" writers and speakers, including many devotees  of the \"Reorganization,\" who vainly attempt to prove the disloyalty of  the Saints, is rather astonishing in the face of the facts of history.  The exodus to the Rocky Mountains was undertaken _of necessity_, as it  was from Missouri to Illinois, because the Saints had been ruthlessly  driven from their homes by armed mobocrats. Notwithstanding this, the  Church came to the Rocky Mountains because the Lord willed it so,  for He permitted the expulsion from Nauvoo that His purposes might  be fulfilled. The Prophet Joseph Smith, as early as 1842, received a  revelation declaring that the Saints would be driven to these valleys.  That revelation is found in the history of the Church for Saturday,  August 6, 1842. Our friends the Reorganites, have themselves testified  in their more sober moments to the truth of this grand prediction. In  a history published by them in 1880, and which they said was \"the aim  of the publishers to place within the reach of those who cared to know,  a more correct standard from which to determine the character and work  of Joseph Smith, the founder, under divine direction, of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,\" \"And is the cheapest book published  by the (Reorganized) Church.\" They record the following:    \"Just at this time (1842) also occurred Joseph's first marked prophecy,  on record, concerning the removal of the Saints to the Rocky Mountains.  Says the Record:    \"Saturday 6th, (August, 1842). Passed over the river to Montrose,  Iowa, in company with General Adams, Colonel Brewer, and others, and  witnessed the installation of the officers of the Rising Sun Lodge of  Ancient York Masons, at Montrose, by General James Adams, Deputy Grand  Master of Illinois. While the Deputy Grand Master was engaged in giving  the requisite instructions to the Master Elect, I had a conversation  with a number of brethren, in the shade of the building, on the subject  of our persecutions in Missouri, and the constant annoyance which has  followed us since we were driven from the State. I prophesied that the  Saints would continue to suffer much affliction, and would be driven  to the Rocky Mountains, many would apostatize, others would be put  to death by our persecutors, or lose their lives in consequence of  exposure or disease, and some would live to go and assist in making  settlements and building cities, and see the Saints become a mighty  people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains.\"    \"The exodus is a great historic fact. It would do violence to history  to expunge this record. The Twelve, however, may have shaped the record  thus to fit their own events. It is not even affirmed that Joseph gave  such a revelation to the Church; but the historical landmark, pointing  to the Rocky Mountains, is this prophecy to his Masonic brethren, on  the 6th of August, 1842, just about five years before the feet of the  pioneers emerged from the last mountain gorge into the beautiful  valley of the Great Salt Lake.\" (Tullidge's Life of Joseph Smith,  Lamoni edition, page 398-9).    In February 1844 a company was selected to go and explore Oregon  and California (Utah then being a portion of what was called \"Upper  California,\") for the purpose of selecting a site where the Saints  could build a city. The minutes of this meeting say: \"At a meeting  of the Twelve, at the Mayor's office, Nauvoo, February 21, 1844,  seven o'clock, p. m., Brigham Young, Parley P. Pratt, Orson Pratt,  Wilford Woodruff, John Taylor, George A. Smith, Willard Richards and  four others being present, called by previous notice, by instruction  of President Joseph Smith on the 20th instant, for the purpose of  selecting a company to explore Oregon and California, and select a site  for a new city for the Saints.\"    Jonathan Dunham, Phineas H. Young, David D. Yearsley and David Fullmer,  volunteered to go; and Alphonzo Young, James Emmett, George D. Watt,  and Daniel Spencer were requested to go. These brethren were requested  to meet with the council on the following Friday evening at the  Assembly Room, and the history of the Prophet continues: \"Met with the  Twelve in the Assembly Room (Friday 23rd) concerning the Oregon and  California Exploring Expedition; Hyrum and Sidney present. I told them  I wanted an exploration of all that mountain country. Perhaps it would  be best to go direct to Santa Fe. Send twenty-five men: let them preach  the Gospel wherever they go. Let that man go that can raise $500, a  good horse and mule, a double-barrel gun, one barrel rifle, and the  other smooth bore, a saddle and bridle, a pair of revolving pistols,  bowie-knife, and a good saber. Appoint a leader, and let him beat up  for volunteers. I want every man that goes to be a king and a priest.  When he gets on the mountains he may want to talk with his God; when  with the savage nations have power to govern, etc. If we don't get  volunteers wait until after the election.\"    On this and other occasions shortly following, these volunteered to go:  George D. Watt, Samuel Bent, Joseph A. Kelting, David Fullmer, James  Emmett, Daniel Spencer, Samuel Rolfe, Daniel Avery, Samuel W. Richards,  Almon L. Fuller, Hosea Stout, Thomas S. Edwards, Moses Smith and Rufus  Beach. There were also others. It is also a fact that on the evening  of June 22, 1844, because of persecution, the Prophet Joseph Smith,  his brother Hyrum and a few others crossed the Mississippi river with  the intention of going to the Rocky Mountains, beyond the persecutions  of their enemies. The following day they were accused of cowardice by  false friends who declared that they were fleeing from the flock in  time of danger. This falsehood so wounded the Prophet who had stood in  the breach from the beginning to protect the Saints, that he returned  to Nauvoo, and gave himself up declaring that if his life was of no  value to his friends, it was of none to himself. Four days later he  suffered martyrdom, sealing his testimony with his blood.    Mr. George Derry, himself a Reorganite, in the Saints' Herald for  January 31, 1906, in reply to the editor who doubted that any such  intention as a settlement in the West was contemplated by Joseph Smith,  wrote the following:    \"In reading the article in Saints' Herald, No. 46, 'The Editor at  Home,' I got the impression that the writer was in doubt as to the  correct statement of S. W. Richards that he was one of twenty-five  men that were selected by Joseph Smith, Jr., to go out west to try to  find a location for the Saints beyond the reach of mobs--a condition  no doubt desirable in those trying times. S. W. Richards was president  of the Church in the British Isles while I lived in London. I was  president of a branch there and I was often brought in contact with  other presiding officers as they met in council every month. The London  conference was composed of forty-two branches, was often visited by  the president of the mission and his counselors. I well remember S. W.  Richards and others making the same statement at one of our monthly  meetings, for they frequently dwelt at considerable length on the  persecutions and trials of the Saints in that day. I believed the  statements then--fifty-three years ago. I have no reason to reject it  now. I have never heard it disproved. The testimony of S. W. Richards  is as true in 1905 [See Era, Vol. 7, 927] as it was in 1853, that the  company was organized. Recording the facts would not add to their  _truthfulness_. I never heard that the company went west, but the  company was _organized_, although conditions were changed.    \"In reading of the wonderful manifestations given in Kirtland, I  find the following vision seen by Joseph Smith: 'I saw Brigham Young  standing in a strange land in the far South and West in a desert place  on a rock in the midst of about a dozen men of color. He was preaching  to them in their own tongue. I saw the twelve apostles of the Lamb that  _now are_ upon the earth standing together in a circle, much fatigued.  I finally saw them in the celestial Kingdom of God.'    \"The conditions here stated very much resemble the conditions existing  in Utah extending four hundred miles south of Salt Lake City. Here is  certainly strong indication, if visions are reliable, that Brigham  Young with the rest of the apostles would go to a strange land  beyond the bounds of civilization. And in view of the mobbings and  drivings they had to endure, is it any wonder that they should seek  a quiet resting-place? Who shall say there was anything dishonorable  in organizing a company by Joseph Smith, Jr., to seek out a quiet  resting-place where they could be free to worship God in peace, none  to make them afraid? The writer seems to have serious doubts as to  the truth of the statements of the two men he met in Salt Lake City,  because we have no record of the preparations made. I never heard it  stated that the company did go west, because conditions changed, but  the fact still remains--the company was formed, firearms and provisions  were agreed upon, but as to what happened to change the program we  have no record. But that the company was formed under the direction  and choice of Joseph Smith is beyond doubt.\" As early as 1831, the  Lord in a revelation (Doc. & Cov. 49:25) declared that \"Zion shall  flourish upon the hills and rejoice upon the mountains, and shall be  assembled together unto the place which I have appointed.\" When Brigham  Young therefore, and the apostles, lead the Church to the valleys  of the mountains, it was in fulfillment of the word of the Lord to  Joseph Smith, uttered first, in March, 1831, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5039"],[0,"State of the Union Addresses (#9)"],[1,"nations have had an  opportunity to harvest another crop. During the next few months the need  for food in the world will be more serious than at any time during the war.  And, despite the large shipments we have already made, and despite what we  shall send, there remain great needs abroad.    Beyond the relief feeding period, there will still be substantial foreign  outlets for our farm commodities. The chief dependence of the farmer,  however, as always, must be upon the buying power of our own people.    The first obligation of the Government to agriculture for the reconversion  period is to make good on its price-support commitments. This we intend to  do, with realistic consideration for the sound patterns of production that  will contribute most to the long-time welfare of agriculture and the whole  Nation. The period during which prices are supported will provide an  opportunity for farmers individually to strengthen their position in  changing over from a wartime to a peacetime basis of production. It will  provide an opportunity for the Congress to review the needs of agriculture  and make changes in national legislation where experience has shown changes  to be needed. In this connection, the Congress will wish to consider  legislation to take the place of the 1937 Sugar Act which expires at the  end of this year. During this period we must do a thorough job of basic  planning to the end that agriculture shall be able to contribute its full  share toward a healthy national economy.    Our long-range agricultural policies should have two main objectives:  First, to assure the people on the farms a fair share of the national  income; and, second, to encourage an agricultural production pattern that  is best fitted to the Nation's needs. To accomplish this second objective  we shall have to take into consideration changes that have taken place and  will continue to take place in the production of farm commodities--changes  that affect costs and efficiency and volume.    What we seek ultimately is a high level of food production and consumption  that will provide good nutrition for everyone. This cannot be accomplished  by agriculture alone. We can be certain of our capacity to produce food,  but we have often failed to distribute it as well as we should and to see  that our people can afford to buy it. The way to get good nutrition for the  whole Nation is to provide employment opportunities and purchasing power  for all groups that will enable them to buy full diets at market prices.    Wherever purchasing power fails to reach this level we should see that they  have some means of getting adequate food at prices in line with their  ability to buy. Therefore, we should have available supplementary programs  that will enable all our people to have enough of the right kind of food.    For example, one of the best possible contributions toward building a  stronger, healthier Nation would be a permanent school-lunch program on a  scale adequate to assure every school child a good lunch at noon. The  Congress, of course, has recognized this need for a continuing school-lunch  program and legislation to that effect has been introduced and hearings  held. The plan contemplates the attainment of this objective with a minimum  of Federal expenditures. I hope that the legislation will be enacted in  time for a permanent program to start with the beginning of the school year  next fall.    We have the technical knowledge and the productive capacity to provide  plenty of good food for every man, woman, and child in the United States.  It is time we made that possibility a reality.    (g) Resource development.    The strength of our Nation and the welfare of the people rest upon the  natural resources of the country. We have learned that proper conservation  of our lands, including our forests and minerals, and wise management of  our waters will add immensely to our national wealth.    The first step in the Government's conservation program must be to find out  just what are our basic resources, and how they should be used. We need to  take, as soon as possible, an inventory of the lands, the minerals, and the  forests of the Nation.    During the war it was necessary to curtail some of our long-range plans for  development of our natural resources, and to emphasize programs vital to  the prosecution of the war. Work was suspended on a number of flood control  and reclamation projects and on the development of our national forests and  parks. This work must now be resumed, and new projects must be undertaken  to provide essential services and to assist in the process of economic  development.    The rivers of America offer a great opportunity to our generation in the  management of the national wealth. By a wise use of Federal funds, most of  which will be repaid into the Treasury, the scourge of floods and drought  can be curbed, water can be brought to arid lands, navigation can be  extended, and cheap power can be brought alike to the farms and to the  industries of our land.    Through the use of the waters of the Columbia River, for example, we are  creating a rich agricultural area as large as the State of Delaware. At the  same time, we are producing power at Grand Coulee and at Bonneville which  played a mighty part in winning the war and which will found a great  peacetime industry in the Northwest. The Tennessee Valley Authority will  resume its peacetime program of promoting full use of the resources of the  Valley. We shall continue our plans for the development of the Missouri  Valley, the Arkansas Valley, and the Central Valley of California.    The Congress has shown itself alive to the practical requirements for a  beneficial use of our water resources by providing that preference in the  sale of power be given to farmers' cooperatives and public agencies. The  public power program thus authorized must continue to be made effective by  building the necessary generating and transmission facilities to furnish  the maximum of firm power needed at the wholesale markets, which are often  distant from the dam sites.    These great developmental projects will open the frontiers of agriculture,  industry, and commerce. The employment opportunities thus offered will also  go far to ease the transition from war to peace.    (h) Public works.    During the war even urgently needed Federal, State, and local construction  projects were deferred in order to release sources for war production. In  resuming public works construction, it is desirable to proceed only at a  moderate rate, since demand for private construction will be abnormally  high for some time. Our public works program should be timed to reach its  peak after demand for private construction has begun to taper off.  Meanwhile, however, plans should be prepared if we are to act promptly when  the present extraordinary private demand begins to run out.    The Congress made money available to Federal agencies for their public  works planning in the fiscal year 1946. I strongly recommend that this  policy be continued and extended in the fiscal year 1947.    State and local governments also have an essential role to play in a  national public works program. In my message of September 6, 1945, I  recommended that the Congress vote such grants to State and local  governments as will insure that each level of government makes its proper  contribution to a balanced public construction program. Specifically, the  Federal Government should aid State and local governments in planning their  own public works programs, in undertaking projects related to Federal  programs of regional development, and in constructing such public works as  are necessary to carry out the various policies of the Federal Government.    Early in 1945 the Congress made available advances to State and local  governments for planning public works projects, and recently made  additional provision to continue these advances through the fiscal year  1946. I believe that further appropriations will be needed for the same  purpose for the fiscal year 1947.    The Congress has already made provision for highway programs. It is now  considering legislation which would expand Federal grants and loans in  several other fields, including construction of airports, hospital and  health centers, housing, water pollution control facilities, and  educational plant facilities. I hope that early action will be taken to  authorize these Federal programs.    With respect to public works of strictly local importance, State and local  governments should proceed without Federal assistance except in planning.  This rule should be subject to review when and if the prospect of highly  adverse general economic developments warrants it.    All loans and grants for public works should be planned and administered in  such a way that they are brought into accord with the other elements of the  Federal Program.    Our long-run objective is to achieve a program of direct Federal and  Federally assisted public works which is planned in advance and  synchronized with business conditions. In this way it can make its greatest  contribution to general economic stability.    (1) National housing program.    Last September I stated in my message to the Congress that housing was high  on the list of matters calling for decisive action.    Since then the housing shortage in countless communities, affecting  millions of families, has magnified this call to action.    Today we face both an immediate emergency and a major postwar problem.    Since VJ-day the wartime housing shortage has been growing steadily worse  and pressure on real estate values has increased. Returning veterans often  cannot find a satisfactory place for their families to live, and many who  buy have to pay exorbitant prices. Rapid demobilization inevitably means  further overcrowding.    A realistic and practical attack on the emergency will require"]]]
