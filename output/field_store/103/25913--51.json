And when he got home he showed his  mother the wonderful hen and said \"Lay,\" to it; and it laid a golden egg  every time he said \"Lay.\"    Well, Jack was not content, and it wasn't very long before he determined  to have another try at his luck up there at the top of the beanstalk. So  one fine morning, he got up early, and went on to the beanstalk, and he  climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed till he got to  the top. But this time he knew better than to go straight to the ogre's  house. And when he got near it he waited behind a bush till he saw the  ogre's wife come out with a pail to get some water, and then he crept  into the house and got into the copper. He hadn't been there long when  he heard thump! thump! thump! as before, and in come the ogre and his  wife.    \"Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman,\" cried out the ogre;  \"I smell him, wife, I smell him.\"    \"Do you, my dearie?\" says the ogre's wife. \"Then if it's that little  rogue that stole your gold and the hen that laid the golden eggs he's  sure to have got into the oven.\" And they both rushed to the oven. But  Jack wasn't there, luckily, and the ogre's wife said: \"There you are  again with your fee-fi-fo-fum. Why of course it's the laddie you caught  last night that I've broiled for your breakfast. How forgetful I am, and  how careless you are not to tell the difference between a live un and a  dead un.\"    So the ogre sat down to the breakfast and ate it, but every now and  then he would mutter: \"Well, I could have sworn----\" and he'd get up  and search the larder and the cupboards, and everything, only luckily he  didn't think of the copper.    After breakfast was over, the ogre called out: \"Wife, wife, bring me my  golden harp.\" So she brought it and put it on the table before him. Then  he said: \"Sing!\" and the golden harp sang most beautifully. And it  went on singing till the ogre fell asleep, and commenced to snore like  thunder.    Then Jack lifted up the copper-lid very quietly and got down like a  mouse and crept on hands and knees till he got to the table when he got  up and caught hold of the golden harp and dashed with it towards the  door. But the harp called out quite loud: \"Master! Master!\" and the ogre  woke up just in time to see Jack running off with his harp.    Jack ran as fast as he could, and the ogre came rushing after, and would  soon have caught him only Jack had a start and dodged him a bit and knew  where he was going. When he got to the beanstalk the ogre was not more  than twenty yards away when suddenly he saw Jack disappear like, and  when he got up to the end of the road he saw Jack underneath climbing  down for dear life. Well, the ogre didn't like trusting himself to such  a ladder, and he stood and waited, so Jack got another start. But just  then the harp cried out: \"Master! master!\" and the ogre swung himself  down on to the beanstalk which shook with his weight. Down climbs Jack,  and after him climbed the ogre. By this time Jack had climbed down and  climbed down and climbed down till he was very nearly home. So he called  out: \"Mother! mother! bring me an axe, bring me an axe.\" And his mother  came rushing out with the axe in her hand, but when she came to the  beanstalk she stood stock still with fright for there she saw the ogre  just coming down below the clouds.    But Jack jumped down and got hold of the axe and gave a chop at the  beanstalk which cut it half in two. The ogre felt the beanstalk shake  and quiver so he stopped to see what was the matter. Then Jack gave  another chop with the axe, and the beanstalk was cut in two and began  to topple over. Then the ogre fell down and broke his crown, and the  beanstalk came toppling after.    Then Jack showed his mother his golden harp, and what with showing that  and selling the golden eggs, Jack and his mother became very rich, and  he married a great princess, and they lived happy ever after.          THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS      Once upon a time when pigs spoke rhyme    And monkeys chewed tobacco,    And hens took snuff to make them tough,    And ducks went quack, quack, quack, O!    There was an old sow with three little pigs, and as she had not enough  to keep them, she sent them out to seek their fortune. The first that  went off met a man with a bundle of straw, and said to him:    \"Please, man, give me that straw to build me a house.\"    Which the man did, and the little pig built a house with it. Presently  came along a wolf, and knocked at the door, and said:    \"Little pig, little pig, let me come in.\"    To which the pig answered:    \"No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.\"    The wolf then answered to that:    \"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in.\"    So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and ate up the  little pig.    The second little pig met a man with a bundle of furze, and said:    \"Please, man, give me that furze to build a house.\"    Which the man did, and the pig built his house. Then along came the  wolf, and said:    \"Little pig, little pig, let me come in.\"    \"No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.\"    \"Then I'll puff, and I'll huff, and I'll blow your house in.\"    So he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and at last  he blew the house down, and he ate up the little pig.    The third little pig met a man with a load of bricks, and said:    \"Please, man, give me those bricks to build a house with.\"    So the man gave him the bricks, and he built his house with them. So the  wolf came, as he did to the other little pigs, and said:    \"Little pig, little pig, let me come in.\"    \"No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.\"    \"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in.\"    Well, he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, and he  puffed and huffed; but he could _not_ get the house down. When he found  that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house  down, he said:    \"Little pig, I know where there is a nice field of turnips.\"    \"Where?\" said the little pig.    \"Oh, in Mr. Smith's Home-field, and if you will be ready tomorrow  morning I will call for you, and we will go together, and get some for  dinner.\"    \"Very well,\" said the little pig, \"I will be ready. What time do you  mean to go?\"    \"Oh, at six o'clock.\"    Well, the little pig got up at five, and got the turnips before the wolf  came (which he did about six) and who said:    \"Little Pig, are you ready?\"    The little pig said: \"Ready! I have been and come back again, and got a  nice potful for dinner.\"    The wolf felt very angry at this, but thought that he would be up to the  little pig somehow or other, so he said:    \"Little pig, I know where there is a nice apple-tree.\"    \"Where?\" said the pig.    \"Down at Merry-garden,\" replied the wolf, \"and if you will not deceive  me I will come for you, at five o'clock tomorrow and get some apples.\"    Well, the little pig bustled up the next morning at four o'clock, and  went off for the apples, hoping to get back before the wolf came; but  he had further to go, and had to climb the tree, so that just as he was  coming down from it, he saw the wolf coming, which, as you may suppose,  frightened him very much. When the wolf came up he said:    \"Little pig, what! are you here before me? Are they nice apples?\"    \"Yes, very,\" said the little pig. \"I will throw you down one.\"    And he threw it so far, that, while the wolf was gone to pick it up, the  little pig jumped down and ran home. The next day the wolf came again,  and said to the little pig:    \"Little pig, there is a fair at Shanklin this afternoon, will you go?\"    \"Oh yes,\" said the pig, \"I will go; what time shall you be ready?\"    \"At three,\" said the wolf. So the little pig went off before the time  as usual, and got to the fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he was  going home with, when he saw the wolf coming. Then he could not tell  what to do. So he got into the churn to hide, and by so doing turned it  round, and it rolled down the hill with the pig in it, which frightened  the wolf so much, that he ran home without going to the fair. He went  to the little pig's house, and told him how frightened he had been by a  great round thing which came down the hill past him. Then the little pig  said:    \"Hah, I frightened you, then. I had been to the fair and bought a  butter-churn, and when I saw you, I got into it, and rolled down the  hill.\"    Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he _would_ eat up the  little pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him. When the  little pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of water, and  made up a blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was coming down, took  off the cover, and in fell the wolf; so the little pig put on the cover  again in an instant, boiled him up, and ate him for supper, and lived  happy ever afterwards.          THE MASTER AND HIS PUPIL    There was once a very learned man in the north-country who knew all the  languages under the sun, and who was acquainted with all the mysteries  of creation. He had one big book bound in black calf and clasped with  iron, and with iron corners, and chained to a table which was made fast  to the floor; and when he read out of this book, he unlocked it with an  iron key, and none but he read from it, for it contained all the secrets  of the spiritual world. It told how many angels there were in heaven,  and how they marched in their ranks, and sang in their quires, and what  were their several functions, and what was the name of each great angel  of might. And it told of the demons, how many of them there were, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7440"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#9)"],[1,"reign of each prince being very  uncertain.     It has been already observed that two kingdoms were founded by those who  left their country on occasion of the inundation of Aram:       1  Poc.

The founders of this kingdom were of the tribe of Azd,  who, settling in Syria Damascena near a water called Ghassân, thence took  their name, and drove out (the Dajaamian Arabs of the tribe of Salîh, who  before possessed the country;4 where they maintained their kingdom 400 years,  as others say 600, or as Abulfeda more exactly computes, 616.  Five of these  princes were named Hâreth, which the Greeks write Aretas: and one of them it  was whose governor ordered the gates of Damascus to be watched to take St.  Paul.5  This tribe were Christians, their last king being Jabalah the son of  al Ayham, who on the Arabs' successes in Syria professed Mohammedism under the  Khalîf Omar; but receiving a disgust from him, returned to his former faith,  and retired to Constantinople.6     The other kingdom was that of Hira, which was founded by Malec, of the  descendants of Cahlân7 in Chaldea or Irâk; but after three descents the throne  came by marriage to the Lakhmians, called also the Mondars (the general name  of those princes), who preserved their dominion, notwithstanding some small  interruption by the Persians, till the Khalîfat of Abubecr, when al Mondar al  Maghrûr, the last of them, lost his life and crown by the arms of Khaled Ebn  al Walîd.  This kingdom lasted 622 years eight months.8  Its princes were  under the protection of the kings of Persia, whose lieutenants they were over  the Arabs of Irâk, as the kings of Ghassân were for the Roman emperors over  those of Syria.9     Jorham the son of Kahtân reigned in Hejâz, where his posterity kept the  throne till the time of Ismael; but on his marrying the daughter of Modad, by  whom he had twelve sons, Kidar, one of them, had the crown resigned to him by  his uncles the Jorhamites,1 though others say the descendants of Ismael  expelled that tribe, who retiring to Johainah, were, after various fortune, at  last all destroyed by an inundation.2     Of the kings of Hamyar, Hira, Ghassân, and Jorham, Dr. Pocock has given us  catalogues tolerably exact, to which I refer the curious.3     After the expulsion of the Jorhamites, the government of Hejâz seems not to  have continued for many centuries in the hands of one prince, but to have been  divided among the heads of tribes, almost in the same manner as the Arabs of  the desert are governed at this day.  At Mecca an aristocracy prevailed, where  the chief management of affairs till the time of Mohammed was in the tribe of  Koreish, especially after they had gotten the custody of the Caaba from the  tribe of Khozâah.4     Besides the kingdoms which have been taken notice of, there were some other  tribes which in latter times had princes of their own, and formed states of  lesser note, particularly the tribe of Kenda:5 but as I am not writing a just  history of the Arabs, and an account of them would be of no great use ot my  present purpose, I shall waive any further mention of them.     After the time of Mohammed, Arabia was for about three centuries under the  Khalîfs his successors.  But in the year 325 of the Hejra,       4  Poc.

Spec. p. 79, &c.            great part of that country was in the hands of the Karmatians,6 a new sect who  had committed great outrages and disorders even in Mecca, and to whom the  Khalîfs were obliged to pay tribute, that the pilgrimage thither might be  performed: of this sect I may have occasion to speak in another place.  Afterwards Yaman was governed by the house of Thabateba, descended from Ali  the son-in-law of Mohammed, whose sovereignty in Arabia some place so high as  the time of Charlemagne.  However, it was the posterity of Ali, or pretenders  to be such, who reigned in Yaman and Egypt so early as the tenth century.  The  present reigning family in Yaman is probably that of Ayub, a branch of which  reigned there in the thirteenth century, and took the title of Khalîf and  Imâm, which they still retain.7  They are not possessed of the whole province  of Yaman,8 there being several other independent kingdoms there, particularly  that of Fartach.  The crown of Yaman descends not regularly from father to  son, but the prince of the blood royal who is most in favour with the great  ones, or has the strongest interest, generally succeeds.9     The governors of Mecca and Medina, who have always been of the race of  Mohammed, also threw off their subjection to the Khalîfs, since which time  four principal families, all descended from Hassan the son of Ali, have  reigned there under the title of Sharîf, which signifies noble, as they reckon  themselves to be on account of their descent.  These are Banu Kâder, Banu Mûsa  Thani, Banu Hashem, and Banu Kitâda;1 which last family now is, or lately was,  in the throne of Mecca, where they have reigned above 500 years.  The reigning  family at Medina are the Banu Hashem, who also reigned at Mecca before those  of Kitâda.2     The kings of Yaman, as well as the princes of Mecca and Medina, are  alsolutely independent3 and not at all subject to the Turk, as some late  authors have imagined.4  These princes often making cruel wars among  themselves, gave an opportunity to Selim I. and his son Solimân, to make  themselves masters of the coasts of Arabia on the Red Sea, and of part of  Yaman, by means of a fleet built at Sues: but their successors have not been  able to maintain their conquests; for, except the port of Jodda, where they  have a Basha whose authority is very small, they possess nothing considerable  in Arabia.5     Thus have the Arabs preserved their liberty, of which few nations can  produce so ancient monuments, with very little interruption, from the very  Deluge; for though very great armies have been sent against them, all attempts  to subdue them were unsuccessful.  The Assyrian or Median empires never got  footing among them.6  The Persian monarchs, though they were their friends,  and so far respected by them as to have an annual present of frankincense,7  yet could never make them tributary;8 and were so far from being their  masters, that Cambyses, on his expedition against Egypt, was obliged to ask  their leave to pass through their territories;9 and when Alexander had subdued  that mighty empire, yet the Arabians had so little apprehension of him, that  they alone, of       6  Vide Elmacin. in vita al Râdi. 7  Voyage de l-Arab. heur. p. 255.   8  Ibid. 153, 273.  9  Ibid. 254. 1  Ibid. 143. 2  Ibid. 145. 3  Ibid. 143, 148.  4  Vide D'Herbel.

And we are told by one author,6 that this prince, marching  against the Agarens who had revolted, met with such a reception that he was  obliged to return without doing anything.     The religion of the Arabs before Mohammed, which they call the state of  ignorance, in opposition to the knowledge of GOD'S true worship revealed to  them by their prophet, was chiefly gross idolatry; the Sabian religion having  almost overrun the whole nation, though there were also great numbers of  Christians, Jews, and Magians among them.     I shall not here transcribe what Dr. Prideaux7 has written of the original  of the Sabian religion; but instead thereof insert a brief account of the  tenets and worship of that sect.  They do not only believe one GOD, but  produce many strong arguments for His unity, though they also pay an adoration  to the stars, or the angels and intelligences which they suppose reside in  them, and govern the world under the Supreme Deity.  They endeavour to perfect  themselves in the four intellectual virtues, and believe the souls of the  wicked men will be punished for nine thousand ages, "]]]
