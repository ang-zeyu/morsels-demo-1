Through the operation of laws obtaining in the spiritual  world man may be reached and lifted; himself he cannot exalt. A  Redeemer and Savior is essential to the accomplishment of the Father's  plan, which is \"to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of  man\" (Pearl of Great Price, p. 7); and that Redeemer and Savior is  Jesus the Christ, beside whom there is and can be no other.        -- 13 --    CHRIST'S UNIQUE STATUS    As Redeemer and Savior of the World    TO hosts of earnest and thoughtful people, comprising many who devoutly  believe in the efficacy of our Lord's atoning death as a means of  redemption from death and salvation from sin, it is a matter of  surpassing wonder that the sacrifice of a single life could be made an  effective means of emancipation for mankind.    Scriptures ante-dating the Savior's earthly life plainly aver that the  Atonement to be made by Him was to be a vicarious sacrifice, voluntary  and love-inspired on His part, and universal in its application so  far as human-kind would avail themselves of its beneficent means.  These conditions were confirmed by the personal affirmations of the  embodied Christ, and are attested by Scriptures post-dating the tragic  consummation on Calvary.    The concept of vicarious service, in which one may act or officiate  for and in behalf of another, is as old as the race. It is, however,  fundamentally opposed to the unscriptural assumption that the merits  of one man may be accounted to the cancellation of another's sins.  Scriptures both ancient and modern, the traditions of the human family,  the rites of altar sacrifice, and even the sacrileges of heathen  idolatry involve the basal conception of vicarious atonement. This  principle, of Divine establishment in its original and uncorrupted  form, was revealed to Adam (Pearl of Great Price, pp. 19-20), who  offered sacrifices in the similitude of the then future death of the  Lamb of God, and was taught and practised by later prophets down to the  time of Christ.    The Scriptures relieve us from the assumption that any ordinary mortal,  by voluntarily giving up his life even as a martyr to the best of  causes, could become a ransom for the sins of his fellows and a victor  over death. Jesus Christ, though He lived and died as one of the human  family, was of unique nature. Never has another such as He walked the  earth. Christ was the only Being among all the embodied spirit-children  of God suited to and acceptable as the great sacrifice of atonement, in  these definite and distinct respects:    1. He was the One chosen and foreordained in the heavens to this  specific service.    2. He was and is the Only Begotten of the Father in the body, and  therefore the only Being ever born to earth who possessed in their  fulness the inherent attributes of both Godhood and manhood.    3. He was and is the one and only sinless Man who has lived in  mortality.    Concerning our Lord's foreordination as the Redeemer and Savior, He  has given us personal testimony with which the utterances of prophets  who lived before His birth and apostles who taught after His death are  in harmony. Twenty-two centuries before the meridian of time, the then  unembodied Christ revealed Himself to a Book of Mormon prophet, saying:  \"Behold I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the world to  redeem my people. Behold I am Jesus Christ.\" (Book of Mormon, Ether  3:14). Unto Moses the Father spake, saying: \"Thou art in the similitude  of mine Only Begotten, and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the  Savior.\" (Pearl of Great Price, p. 2). These Scriptures are in accord  with Peter's testimony of Christ as \"a Lamb without blemish and without  spot, who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world.\"  (1 Peter 1:19-20).    As the Eternal Father's Only Begotten Son in the flesh, Christ  possessed the inborn power to withstand death indefinitely, and this  just as naturally as that He, being the offspring of a mortal mother,  should derive the ability to die. Jesus Christ inherited through  the operation of the natural law of heredity the physical, mental,  and spiritual attributes of His parents--the Father immortal and  glorified, the mother human. He could not be slain until His hour had  come, the hour in which He would voluntarily give up His life, and  permit His own decease as an act of will. How else are His definite  asseverations concerning Himself to be construed? Consider for example  this: \"Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life,  that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down  of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it  again.\" (John 10:17-18). And further: \"For as the Father hath life in  himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.\" (John  5:26).    Christ died, not as other men have died or shall die, because of  inability to escape death, but for a special purpose by voluntary  surrender. Thus, the atoning sacrifice was no usual death of an  ordinary man, but the decease of One who had the power to live. It was  a sacrifice, indeed! [1]    As a sinless Man Christ was exempt from the dominion of Satan; and  was sublimely conscious of His own perfect probity. He challenged  assailants with the pertinent demand \"Which of you convinceth me of  sin?\" (John 8:46); and in the hour of His entrance into Gethsemane  solemnly averred: \"The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in  me.\" (John 14:30).    Had our Lord died as the result of Satan's power over Him through  transgression, His death would have been but an individual experience,  expiatory in no degree of any offenses but His own. His absolute  freedom from spot or blemish of sin made Him eligible, His humility  and willingness rendered Him acceptable as the propitiatory sacrifice  for the sins of the world. In these respects, as in that of His having  life in Himself and therefore power over death, He was of a status  absolutely unique among men. With this knowledge spake the ancient  Hebrew prophet, saying: \"As the Lord God liveth, there is none other  name given under heaven, save it be this Jesus Christ of which I have  spoken, whereby man can be saved.\" (Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 25:20).

That belief if  sustained by works constitutes faith in or acceptance of the Christ as  the Only Begotten Son of God, and is supported by the Holy Scriptures  of all ages. Nevertheless, to most of us, the fact of the Atonement is  a great mystery.    Be it remembered that the effect of the Atonement is two-fold: (1)  Redemption of the human race from physical death, which entered the  world as a result of Adam's transgression; and (2) Salvation, whereby  means of relief from the results of individual sin are provided.    Victory over death and the tomb became manifest in the resurrection  of the crucified Christ. Of all who have lived in the flesh He was  the first to come from the grave with spirit and body reunited, a  resurrected, immortalized Soul. Justly, therefore, is He called \"the  firstfruits of them that slept\" (1 Cor. 15:20); \"the firstborn from the  dead\" (Col. 1:18); and \"the first begotten of the dead.\" (Rev. 1:5).    Immediately following our Lord's resurrection, \"many bodies of the  saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after his  resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.\"  (Matt. 27:52-53).    We learn that in due time everyone who has lived and died on earth  shall be resurrected, \"they that have done good, unto the resurrection  of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of  damnation.\" (John 5:29). However, the order in which we shall be  resurrected is determined by individual conditions of righteousness  or guilt. (See 1 Cor. 15:23; Rev. 20:5-6.) A latter-day Scripture,  describing the general resurrection of the just, incident to the  approaching advent of Christ, embodies the Lord's declaration in these  words: \"The trump of God shall sound both long and loud, and shall say  to the sleeping nations, Ye saints arise and live; ye sinners stay and  sleep until I shall call again.\" (D&C 43:18).    The second effect of the Atonement makes salvation possible to all  men through obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel; and  of these the following are fundamental: (1) Faith in the Lord Jesus  Christ; (2) Repentance; (3) Baptism by immersion for the remission of  sins; (4) Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.    It is evident that but for the Atonement accomplished by the Savior,  there could be no resurrection from the dead (see Book of Mormon, 2  Nephi 9:7-12); and advancement from the disembodied state would be  impossible. And just as plainly the Scriptures declare that without the  Atonement of Christ mankind would be left in their sins, without means  of making amends therefor and receiving remission thereof.    We have learned but little of the eternal laws operative in the  heavens; but that God's purposes are accomplished through and by law  is beyond question. There can be no irregularity, inconsistency,  arbitrariness or caprice in His doings, for such would mean injustice.  Therefore, the Atonement must have been effected in accordance with  law. The self-sacrificing life, the indescribable agony, and the  voluntary death of One who had life in Himself with power to halt His  torturers at any stage, and whom"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47192"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 2 (#9)"],[1,"requires that he      should suffer, yet he will never feel that remorse of conscience      that the other will, and that keen, cutting reflection will never      rise in his breast that otherwise would, had he done the deed, or      committed the offense in full conviction that he was breaking the      law of his country, and having previously acknowledged the same      to be just. It is not our intention by these remarks, to attempt      to place the law of man on a parallel with the law of heaven;      because we do not consider that it is formed in the same wisdom and      propriety; neither do we consider that it is sufficient in itself      to bestow anything on man in comparison with the law of heaven,      even should it promise it. The laws of men may guarantee to a      people protection in the honorable pursuits of this life, and the      temporal happiness arising from a protection against unjust insults      and injuries and when this is said, all is said, that can be in      truth, of the power, extent, and influence of the laws of men,      exclusive of the law of God. The law of heaven is presented to man,      and as such guarantees to all who obey it a reward far beyond any      earthly consideration; though it does not promise that the believer      in every age should be exempt from the afflictions and troubles      arising from different sources in consequence of the acts of wicked      men on earth. Still in the midst of all this {8} there is a promise      predicated upon the fact that it is the law of heaven, which      transcends the law of man, as far as eternal life the temporal; and      as the blessings which God is able to give, are greater than those      which can be given by man. Then, certainly, if the law of man is      binding upon man when acknowledged, how much more must the law of      heaven be! And as much as the law of heaven is more perfect than      the law of man, so much greater must be the reward if obeyed. The      law of man premises safety in temporal life; but the law of God      promises that life which is eternal, even an inheritance at God's      own right hand, secure from all the powers of the wicked one.        We consider that God has created man with a mind capable of      instruction, and a faculty which may be enlarged in proportion to      the heed and diligence given to the light communicated from heaven      to the intellect; and that the nearer man approaches perfection,      the clearer are his views, and the greater his enjoyments, till      he has overcome the evils of his life and lost every desire for      sin; and like the ancients, arrives at that point of faith where      he is wrapped in the power and glory of his Maker, and is caught      up to dwell with Him. But we consider that this is a station to      which no man ever arrived in a moment: he must have been instructed      in the government and laws of that kingdom by proper degrees,      until his mind is capable in some measure of comprehending the      propriety, justice, equality, and consistency of the same. For      further instruction we refer you to Deut. 32, where the Lord says,      that Jacob is the lot of his inheritance. He found him in a desert      land, and in the waste, howling wilderness; He led him about, He      instructed him, He kept him as the apple of His eye, etc.; which      will show the force of the last item advanced, that it is necessary      for men to receive an understanding concerning the laws of the      heavenly kingdom, before they are permitted to enter it: we mean      the celestial glory. So dissimilar are the governments of men,      and so divers are their laws, from the government and laws of      heaven, that a man, for instance, hearing that there was a country      on this globe called the United States of North America, could      take his journey to this place without first learning the laws of      government; but the conditions of God's kingdom are such, that all      who are made partakers of that glory, are under the necessity of      learning something respecting it previous to their entering into      it. But the foreigner can come to this country without knowing a      syllable of its laws, or even subscribing to obey them after he      arrives. Why? Because the government of the United States does not      require it: it only requires an obedience to its laws after the      individual has arrived within its jurisdiction.        As we previously remarked, we do not attempt to place the law      of man on a parallel with the law of heaven; but we will bring      forward {9} another item, to further urge the propriety of yielding      obedience to the law of heaven, after the fact is admitted, that      the laws of man are binding upon man. Were a king to extend his      dominion over the habitable earth, and send forth his laws which      were of the most perfect kind, and command his subjects one and      all to yield obedience to the same, and add as a reward to those      who obeyed them, that at a certain period they should be called      to attend the marriage of his son, who in due time was to receive      the kingdom, and they should be made equal with him in the same;      and fix as a penalty for disobedience that every individual      guilty of it should be cast out at the marriage feast, and have      no part nor portion with his government, what rational mind could      for a moment accuse the king with injustice for punishing such      rebellious subjects? In the first place his laws were just, easy to      be complied with, and perfect: nothing of a tyrannical nature was      required of them; but the very construction of the laws was equity      and beauty; and when obeyed would produce the happiest condition      possible to all who adhered to them, beside the last great benefit      of sitting down with a royal robe in the presence of the king at      the great, grand marriage supper of his son, and be made equal with      him in all the affairs of the kingdom.        When these royal laws were issued, and promulgated throughout      the vast dominion, every subject, when interrogated whether he      believed them to be from his sovereign or not, answered, Yes; I      know they are, I am acquainted with the signature, for it is as      usual. _Thus saith the King!_ This admitted, the subject is bound      by every consideration of honor to his country, his king, and his      own personal character, to observe in the strictest sense every      requisition in the royal edict. Should any escape the search of      the ambassadors of the king and never hear these last laws, giving      his subjects such exalted privileges, an excuse might be urged      in their behalf, and they escape the censure of the king. But      for those who had heard, who had admitted, and who had promised      obedience to these just laws no excuse could be urged; and when      brought into the presence of the king, certainly, justice would      require that they should suffer a penalty. Could that king be just      in admitting these rebellious individuals into the full enjoyment      and privileges with his son, and those who had been obedient to his      commandments? Certainly not. Because they disregarded the voice      of their lawful king; they had no regard for his virtuous laws,      for his dignity, nor for the honor of his name; neither for the      honor of their country, nor their private virtue. They regarded      not his authority enough to obey him, neither did they regard the      immediate advantages and blessings arising from these laws if kept,      so destitute were they of virtue and goodness; and above all, they      regarded so {10} little the joy and satisfaction of a legal seat      in the presence of the king's only son, and to be made equal with      him in all the blessings, honors, comforts, and felicities of his      kingdom, that they turned away from a participation in them, and      considered that they were beneath their present notice though they      had no doubt as to the real authenticity of the royal edict.        We ask, again, would the king be just in admitting these rebels to      all the privileges of the kingdom, with those who had served him      with the perfect integrity? We again answer, No. Such individuals      would be dangerous characters in any government: good and wholesome      laws they despise; just and perfect principles they trample under      their feet as something beneath their notice; and the commands of      their sovereign which they had once acknowledged to be equitable      they entirely disregard. How could a government be conducted with      harmony if its administrators were possessed with such different      dispositions and different principles? Could it prosper? Could it      flourish? Would harmony prevail? Would order be established, and      could justice be executed in righteousness in all branches of its      departments? No! In it were two classes of men as dissimilar as      light and darkness, virtue and vice, justice and injustice, truth      and falsehood, holiness and sin. One class were perfectly harmless      and virtuous: they knew what virtue was for they had lived in the      fullest enjoyment of it, and their fidelity to truth had been      fairly tested by a series of years of faithful obedience to all      its heavenly precepts. They knew what good order was, for they had      been orderly and obedient to the laws imposed on them by their wise      sovereign, and had experienced the benefits arising from a life      spent in his government till he has now seen proper to make them      equal with his son. Such individuals would indeed adorn any court      where perfection was one of its main springs of action, and shine      far more fair than the richest gem in the diadem of the prince.        The other class were a set of individuals who"]]]
