Therefore, I look for the  time when our dear Brother William C. Staines, whom we all knew so  well, and with whom we were familiar for years--I was familiar with  him, all my life, just as I was familiar with Aunt Rachel here all my  life, and do not remember the time when I did not know her--I look for  the time, I say, when Brother Staines will be restored. He will not  remain the crippled and deformed William C. Staines that we knew, but  he will be restored to his perfect frame--every limb, every joint,  every part of his physical being will be restored to its perfect frame.  This is the law and the word of God to us, as it is contained in the  revelations that have come to us, through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The  point in my mind which I desire to speak of particularly is this: When  we shall have the privilege to meet our mother, our aunt, our sister,  this noble woman whose mortal remains lie here now, but whose immortal  spirit has ascended to God from whence it came, when that spirit shall  return to take up this tabernacle again, she will be Aunt Rachel in her  perfection. She will not always remain just as she will appear when  she is restored again to life, but she will go on to perfection. Under  that law of restoration that God has provided, she will regain her  perfection, the perfection of her youth, the perfection of her glory  and of her {30} being, until her resurrected body shall assume the  exact stature of the spirit that possessed it here in its perfection,  and thus we shall see the glorified, redeemed, exalted, perfected Aunt  Rachel, mother, sister, saint and daughter of the living God, her  identity being unchanged, as a child may grow to manhood or womanhood  and still be the same being.    I want to say to my friends, my brethren and sisters, and to the  kindred, that the Lord Almighty has revealed these truths to us in  these days. We not only have it in the written word, we have it in the  testimony of the spirit of God in the heart of every soul who has drunk  from the fountain of truth and light, and that witness bears record of  these words to us. What else would satisfy us? What else would satisfy  the desire of the immortal soul? Would we be satisfied to be imperfect?  Would we be satisfied to be decrepit? Would we be satisfied to remain  forever and ever in the form of infirmity incident to age? No! Would  we be satisfied to see the children we bury in their infancy remain as  children only, throughout the countless ages of eternity? No! Neither  would the spirits that did possess the tabernacles of our children be  satisfied to remain in that condition. But we know our children will  not be compelled to remain as a child in stature always, for it was  revealed from God, the fountain of truth, through Joseph Smith the  prophet, in this dispensation, that in the resurrection of the dead  the child that was buried in its infancy will come up in the form of  the child that it was when it was laid down; then it will begin to  develop. From the day of the resurrection, the body will develop until  it reaches the full measure of the stature of its spirit, whether it be  male or female. If the spirit possessed the intelligence of God and the  aspirations of mortal souls, it could not be satisfied with anything  less than this. You will remember we are told that the spirit of Jesus  Christ visited one of the ancient {31} prophets and revealed himself  to him, and he declared his identity, that he was the same Son of God  that was to come in the meridian of time. He said he would appear in  the flesh just as he appeared to that prophet. He was not an infant; he  was a grown, developed spirit; possessing the form of man and the form  of God, the same form as when he came and took upon him a tabernacle  and developed it to the full stature of his spirit. These are truths  that have been revealed to us. What for? To give us intelligent hope;  to give us intelligent aspiration; to lead us to think, to hope, to  labor and accomplish what God has aimed and does aim and design that we  should accomplish, not only in this life, but in the life to come.    I rejoice exceedingly that I know and have known nearly all my life  such a noble woman. I do not remember the first time that I saw Aunt  Rachel, I can't recall it; it seems to me I always knew her, just as  I knew my mother in my childhood and all the way through life; and I  rejoice exceedingly in this testimony of the Spirit of the Lord that  has come to us through revelation in the latter days. Through this  testimony I am confident that I shall see Aunt Rachel, by and by; and  when I go--and I expect to go, perhaps, long before she shall recover  this tabernacle--I expect to meet her there. I expect to meet the same  individual that I knew here. I expect to be able to recognize her, just  as I could recognize her tomorrow, if she were living. I believe I will  know just exactly who she is and what she is, and I will remember all  I knew about her; and enjoy her association in the spirit as I did in  the flesh; because her identity is fixed and indestructible, just as  fixed and indestructible as the identity of God the Father and Jesus  Christ the Son. They cannot be any other than themselves. They cannot  be changed; they are from everlasting to everlasting, eternally the  same; so it will be with us. We will progress and develop and grow in  wisdom and understanding, but our {32} identity can never change. We  did not spring from spawn. Our spirits existed from the beginning, have  existed always, and will continue forever. We did not pass through  the ordeals of embodiment in the lesser animals in order to reach the  perfection to which we have attained in manhood and womanhood, in the  image and likeness of God. God was and is our Father, and his children  were begotten in the flesh of his own image and likeness, male and  female. There may have been times when they did not possess the same  intelligence that they possessed at other times. There are periods  in the history of the world when men have dwindled into ignorance  and barbarism, and then there were other times when they have grown  in intelligence, developed in understanding, enlarged in spirit and  comprehension, approaching nearer to the condition and likeness of  their Father and God, and then losing faith, losing the love of God,  losing the light of the Spirit and returning again to semi-barbarism.  Then again, they have been restored, by the power and operation of  the Spirit of the Lord upon their minds, until they again reached a  degree of intelligence. We have reached a degree of intelligence in our  dispensation. Will this same degree of intelligence, that now exists  throughout the world, continue to exist? Yes; if the world continue  to abide in the light that has been shed abroad in the world by the  Father of light, with whom there is no variableness nor shadow of  turning. But let them deny God, let them deny truth, let them depart  from righteousness, let them begin again to wallow in wickedness  and transgression of the laws of God, and what will be the result?  They will degenerate; they will again recede possibly into absolute  barbarism, unless they repent, and the power of God will be again  restored to them and they be again lifted up by that light which shines  and is never dim, except to men who shut their hearts and eyes and ears  against it and will not receive it.    {33} I did not expect to enter into any lengthy discourse. I thank God  for my relationship and acquaintance with this noble, good mother. I  expect to be associated with her throughout all the ages to come, if  I can be as faithful as she has been. I desire to be, and that isn't  all--with the help of God, I intend to be faithful, as she has been  faithful, that in the end I may be worthy to dwell where she will  dwell, with the Prophet Joseph Smith, with her husband with whom she  was associated here in the flesh, with her son and her children, from  generation to generation. I expect to be associated with them in the  mansions that are prepared for the righteous, where God and Christ are,  where those shall be who believe in his name, who receive his work and  abide in his law! Oh! that I could be instrumental in the bands of the  Lord in bringing every loved soul unto him, for there are souls that  are still lacking, whom I love, and if it were possible, how I would  love to be instrumental in the band of the Lord in bringing those loved  souls to a knowledge of this truth, that they might receive of its  glory, benefits and blessings, in this life and in the life to come.  From my childhood, I have always tried to be a savior on Mount Zion, a  savior among men. I have that desire in my heart. I may not have been  very successful in my ambition to accomplish this work, but I have  desired it, and I still desire that I may be instrumental in helping to  spread this truth to the earth's remotest bounds and the testimony of  it to the children of men in every land. I know it is true. It appeals  to my judgment, to my desires, and to the aspirations of my soul; I  want my family; I want those the Lord has given to me; I want them  now; I want them forever! I want to be associated with them forever.  I do not want them to change their identity. I do not want them to be  somebody else. This idea of theosophy, which is gaining ground even  among so-called Christians, in these latter days, is a fallacy of the  deepest kind. It is absolutely repugnant {34} to the very soul of man  to think that a civilized, intelligent being might become a dog, a  cow, a cat; that he might be transformed into another shape, another  kind of being. It is absolutely repulsive and so opposed to the great  truth of God, that has been revealed from the beginning, that he is  from the beginning always the same, that he cannot change, and that  his children cannot change.

These escaped by means of the thick bush and dongas, which afforded  them timely cover.    It was now necessary to prevent Scheepers and his Boers from entering  Murraysburg. To circumvent him, Colonel Scobell--commanding a force of  Cape Mounted Rifles, Cape Police, Diamond Fields Horse, and Brabant's  Horse, with some guns--marched hot foot at the rate of fifty-nine  miles in less than twenty-five hours. Meanwhile Captain Colenbrander,  commanding the Fighting Scouts, moved promptly from Richmond towards  Murraysburg, located Scheepers' hordes in an adjacent village, and  attacked them. The enemy were repulsed with the loss of five of their  number, while the British party had no casualties.    Kruitzinger's commando, continuing its depredations, seized Carlisle  Bridge with a view to pressing towards Grahamstown, but the activity  of Colonels De Lisle and Gorringe frustrated all effort to get to the  sea. The invaders gave a vast amount of trouble, however, burning  farms and securing horses, and several encounters took place. In one  of these, a few miles from Adelaide, Captain Rennie and some of the  Bedford detachment of the Colonial Defence Corps gave an excellent  account of themselves. The Boers lost one man killed, one taken  prisoner, and three wounded, together with six horses.    The raiders were routed from Maraisburg, which was reoccupied by the  British on the 8th; but in the interval the magistrate had had a  somewhat uncomfortable experience, having been imprisoned in his own  house. The enemy reaped a certain reward of their exertions in the  form of some horses, saddles, and a revolver. They afterwards broke  into small gangs, and were hunted by Colonel Donald's column.    The 15th found Colonels Scobell and Colenbrander's columns still in  pursuit of Scheepers, who, having caused some commotion by burning the  house of a British scout named Meredith, was now hiding in the  mountains around Graf Reinet. Colonel Gorringe at the same time was  dodging about the neighbourhood of Kruitzinger (who had abandoned the  hope of going south, and was now making for Blinkwater) and keeping  him perpetually on the move. Space does not admit of a detailed  account of these continuous activities, but in an engagement on the  15th some smart work was done by Captain Stewart, assisted by Gunner  Sawyer (5th Field Battery). While the guns were being hauled up a  precipitous slope, and most of the gunners were dismounted, they were  assailed by a furious fire from the ambushed foe. With admirable  presence of mind, Sawyer took in the situation, and, with the  assistance of Captain Stewart, unlimbered one of the guns and gave the  Boers a _quid pro quo_. This considerably damped their ardour, and  afforded time for the rest of the guns to come into action. The  position was finally stormed by the Albany defence force under Captain  Currie. In the engagement nine Boers were killed and nine wounded. On  the 17th, after a sharp action, the Boers, abandoning seventy  excellent horses and saddles, besides losing some forty of their  number, were driven across Elands River. Kruitzinger got across the  Elands River in safety, but, while turning an angle of the main road  towards Tarkastad, on the morning of the 18th, he came suddenly in  collision with Colonel de Lisle, who, by night, was marching--a  memorable march in a terrific storm!--from Magermansberg to Tarkastad.  The British force, as surprised at the sudden encounter as that of the  Boers, promptly sprang to action, and succeeded in shelling the  rearguard, while the Mounted Infantry started off in pursuit. From  ridge to ridge went hunted and hunters, the Irish Yeomanry, under  Captain Moore, with Mounted Infantry, under Colonel Knight, doing  splendid work; but at last the wily quarry, through some of the troops  having lost direction, succeeded in getting away through the loophole  of Elands Poort. Kruitzinger, still maintaining a north-easterly  direction, was next traced across the railway at Hemming Station on  the 21st. Scheepers, Fouche, and Malan, who had growing forces, and  had been beaten, with the loss of nine killed and seven wounded, by  Major Mullins on the 15th, were proceeding east from Marais Siding.  Other detached parties gave trouble elsewhere. Some, on the 16th,  attacked at Yeefontein, near Steymburg, a patrol of Prince Alfred's  Guards under Major Court, but left behind them two killed, three  wounded, and three prisoners, while the Guards lost one killed and two  seriously wounded. Fighting was taking place in various other places  daily. On the 20th and 21st Colonel Scobell's force, increased by  Colonel Grenfell's, skirmished in the region north of Jansenville with  excellent effect. Kitchener's Fighting Scouts, under Captain  Colenbrander, Major Mullins, and Colonel Gorringe converged from their  various positions, while the main body made for Blaankrantz. On the  20th, by 9 A.M., a hammer-and-tongs engagement had begun, Captain  Doune's two guns being met by a blizzard from the foe in the  surrounding ridges. The assailants were, however, rapidly silenced and  forced to retire, the British party taking up the vacated position,  and \"speeding the parting guest\" with a salvo from pom-poms, rifles,  and field-guns. But the enemy could not be entirely netted, for in  ones and twos they squeezed through the bushes and made their escape.  Four, however, were left on the veldt, and four were taken prisoners,  while about one hundred sound horses came in handy at a time when they  were much in demand. The British force lost three killed and four  wounded.    [Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL SIR H. H. SETTLE.    Photo Elliott & Fry, London.]    Kruitzinger at this time was being gradually pressed towards the  Orange River (which was known to be unfordable) by Colonel de Lisle's  column, which formed part of a cordon, composed of the columns of  Colonels Gorringe, Herbert, and Major Crewe on one side, and Colonels  Crabbe, Codrington, and Henniker on the other. Nearly all the  commandos which had invaded the Colony were retracing their sorry  steps after the failure of their expedition. The fact that they had  been able to keep the field so long was attributed to the persistent  way in which they avoided fighting, and their mode of hugging the  sheltering kopjes and bushes, and never emerging from those beneficent  harbours of refuge. According to good authority, the raiders succeeded  in gaining certain recruits among the Colonial Dutch, but not nearly  so many as they had expected. They were amply supplied with food from  the sympathetic rural population, however, and received on all sides  timely information of the movements of the pursuing columns, which  enabled them to double like hares at the very moment when the pursuers  seemed about to pounce on them.    Train-wrecking continued, and of necessity the running of night trains  had to be suspended. Some of the raiders began to drive over the less  known drifts of the Orange and disappear, while certain rebels  contrived to hide themselves in the mountain fastnesses so as to  escape both the Boer bands and the British pursuit. On the 30th of  March a skirmish took place between some of Henniker's troops  (Victorian Bushmen) and a large force of Boers, during which the  Colonials again showed their tenacity and grit. An advanced party of  four only, under a splendid fellow, Sergeant Sandford, were set upon  by the foe in the vicinity of Zuurberg. The enemy succeeded in  wounding a Bushman, who fell beneath his dead horse, and was there  pinned. His companions, under a perpetual sleet from the marauders'  Mausers, with great coolness engaged in the immensely difficult task  of moving the dead animal and drawing out their comrade from his  perilous position. They then managed to mount the rescued man on  Sergeant Sandford's horse and all got away in safety. Reinforcements  arriving now frightened off the Boers, who had lost four of their  number.           *       *       *       *       *    On the whole, things were progressing wonderfully. At the headquarters  of General Baden-Powell's Constabulary at Modderfontein 2000 more  recruits were now expected to join the 1000 already on duty there.  Australian and Canadian drafts were to follow. The clerical staff of  the Rand Mines' Corporation was about to proceed from the Cape to  Johannesburg, a sure sign of approaching settlement. A warning to  colonists was soon published stating that acts of rebellion committed  after April 12 would not be tried under the Special Tribunals Act of  last session, but by the old common law, the penalties under which  include capital punishment or any term of imprisonment or fine which  an ordinary court may impose.    On the 6th of April a post, ten miles north of Aberdeen, consisting of  one hundred men of the 5th Lancers, thirty-two Imperial Yeomanry under  Captain Bretherton, and Brabant's Horse, was assailed by a horde of  400 Boers. After fighting vigorously from dawn till 11 A.M. the force  was overpowered. Twenty-five of the number only escaped--one was  killed and six were wounded.    On the 11th, Colonel Byng surprised a laager near Smithfield, captured  thirteen tatterdemalions, who were not loth to rest, and some horses  and stores.    Colonel Haig, on the 12th, reached Rosmead and took command of all the  columns operating in the midlands, and he soon began the hunting of  Scheepers' and Malan's commandos with his flying columns. According to  Reuter's correspondent, the Boer forces in the midlands at this date  comprised Scheepers, with 180 men, in the Sneeuwberg; Malan, with  forty men, reported to be breaking northward; Swanepoel, with sixty  men, near New Bethseda; and Fouche, with a force estimated variously  at several"]]]
