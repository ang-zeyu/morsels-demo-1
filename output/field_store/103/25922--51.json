With this injunction he  readily complied, and the prisoners were restored without the least  opposition. On the next day they were brought back to the ship, upon  which the chiefs were released from their confinement. Thus ended an  affair which had given the lieutenant a great deal of trouble and  concern. It appears, however, that the measure which he pursued was  the result of an absolute necessity; since it was only by the seizure  of the chiefs that he could have recovered his men. Love was the  seducer of the two marines. So strong was the attachment which they  had formed to a couple of girls, that it was their design to conceal  themselves till the ship had sailed, and to take up their residence in  the island.    Tupia was one of the natives who had so particularly devoted himself  to the English, that he had scarcely ever been absent from them during  the whole of their stay at Otaheite. He had been Oberea's first  minister, while she was in the height of her power; and he was also  chief priest of the country. To his knowledge of the religious  principles and ceremonies of the Indians, he added great experience in  navigation, and a particular acquaintance with the number and  situation of the neighbouring islands. This man had often expressed a  desire to go with our navigators, and when they were ready to depart,  he came on board, with a boy about thirteen years of age, and  entreated that he might be permitted to proceed with them on their  voyage. To have such a person in the Endeavour, was desirable on many  accounts; and therefore, Lieutenant Cook gladly acceded to his  proposal.    On the 13th of July, the English weighed anchor: and as soon as the  ship was under sail, the Indians on board took their leaves, and wept  with a decent and silent sorrow, in which there was something very  striking and tender. Tupia sustained himself in this scene with a  truly admirable firmness and resolution; for, though he wept, the  effort he made to conceal his tears concurred, with them, to do him  honour.    The stay of our voyagers at Otaheite was three months, the greater  part of which time was spent in the most cordial friendship with the  inhabitants, and a perpetual reciprocation of good offices. That any  differences should happen was greatly regretted on the part of  Lieutenant Cook and his friends, who were studious to avoid them as  much as possible. The principal causes of them resulted from the  peculiar situation and circumstances of the English and the Indians,  and especially from the disposition of the latter to theft. The  effects of this disposition could not always be submitted to or  prevented. It was happy, however, that there was only a single  instance in which the differences that arose were attended with any  fatal consequence; and by that accident the lieutenant was instructed  to take the most effectual measures for the future prevention of  similar events. He had nothing so much at heart, as that in no case  the intercourse of his people with the natives should be productive of  bloodshed.    The traffic with the inhabitants for provisions and refreshments,  which was chiefly under the management of Mr. Banks, was carried on  with as much order as in any well regulated market in Europe. Axes,  hatchets, spikes, large nails, looking-glasses, knives, and beads,  were found to be the best articles to deal in; and for some of these,  every thing which the inhabitants possessed might be procured. They  were, indeed, fond of fine linen cloth, whether white or printed; but  an axe worth half-a-crown would fetch more than a piece of cloth of  the value of twenty shillings.    It would deviate from the plan of this narrative, to enter into a  minute account of the nature, productions, inhabitants, customs, and  manners of the countries which were discovered or visited by Mr. Cook;  or to give a particular detail of every nautical, geographical, and  astronomical observation. It will be sufficient here to take notice,  that our commander did not depart from Otaheite without accumulating a  store of information and instruction for the enlargement of knowledge  and the benefit of navigation.    While the Endeavour proceeded on her voyage under an easy sail, Tupia  informed Lieutenant Cook, that, at four of the neighbouring islands,  which he distinguished by the names of Huaheine, Ulietea, Otaha, and  Bolabola, hogs, fowls and other refreshments, which had latterly been  sparingly supplied at Otaheite, might be procured in great plenty. The  lieutenant, however, was desirous of first examining an island that  lay to the northward, and was called Tethuroa. Accordingly, he came  near it; but having found it to be only a small low island and being  told, at the same time, that it had no settled inhabitants, he  determined to drop any further examination of it, and to go in search  of Huaheine and Ulietea, which were described to be well peopled, and  as large as Otaheite.    On the 15th of July, the weather being hazy, with light breezes and  calms succeeding each other, so that no land could be seen, and little  way was made, Tupia afforded an amusing proof, that, in the exercise  of his priestly character, he knew how to unite some degree of art  with his superstition. He often prayed for a wind to his god Tane, and  as often boasted of his success. This, indeed, he took a most  effectual method to secure; for he never began his address to his  divinity, till he perceived the breeze to be so near, that he knew it  must approach the ship before his supplication could well be brought  to a conclusion.    The Endeavour, on the 16th, being close in with the north-west part of  Huaheine, some canoes soon came off, in one of which was the king of  the island and his wife. At first the people seemed afraid; but, upon  seeing Tupia, their apprehensions were in part dispersed, and, at  length, in consequence of frequent and earnestly repeated assurances  of friendship, their majesties, and several others, ventured on board  the ship. Their astonishment at every thing which was shewn them was  very great; and yet their curiosity did not extend to any objects but  what were particularly pointed out to their notice. When they had  become more familiar, Mr. Cook was given to understand, that the king  was called Oree, and that he proposed as a mark of amity, their making  an exchange of their names. To this our commander readily consented;  and, during the remainder of their being together, the lieutenant was  Oree, and his majesty was Cookee. In the afternoon, the Endeavour  having come to an anchor, in a small but excellent harbour on the west  side of the island, the name of which was Owharre, Mr. Cook,  accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Mr. Monkhouse, Tupia, and the  natives who had been on board ever since the morning, immediately went  on shore. The English gentlemen repeated their excursions on the two  following days; in the course of which they found that the people of  Huaheine had a very near resemblance to those of Otaheite, in person,  dress language, and every other circumstance; and that the productions  of the country were exactly similar.    In trafficking with our people, the inhabitants of Huaheine displayed  a caution and hesitation which rendered the dealing with them slow and  tedious. On the 19th, therefore, the English were obliged to bring out  some hatchets, which it was at first hoped there would be no occasion  for, in an island that had never before been visited by any European.  These procured three very large hogs; and as it was proposed to sail  in the afternoon, Oree and several others came on board to take their  leave. To the king Mr. Cook gave a small pewter plate, on which was  stamped this inscription; 'His Britannic Majesty's ship Endeavour,  Lieutenant James Cook, commander, 16th July, 1769, Huaheine.' Among  other presents made to Oree, were some medals or counters, resembling  the coin of England, and struck in the year 1761; all of which, and  particularly the plate he promised carefully and inviolably to  preserve. This the lieutenant thought to be as lasting a testimony as  any he could well provide, that the English had first discovered the  island; and having dismissed his visitors, who were highly pleased  with the treatment they had met with, he sailed for Ulietea, in a good  harbour of which he anchored the next day.    Tupia had expressed his apprehension, that our navigators, if they  landed upon the island, would be exposed to the attacks of the men of  Bolabola, whom he represented as having lately conquered it, and of  whom he entertained a very formidable idea. This, however, did not  deter Mr. Cook, Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander and the other gentlemen, from  going immediately on shore. Tupia, who was of the party, introduced  them by performing some ceremonies which he had practised before at  Huaheine. After this the lieutenant hoisted an English jack, and in  the name of his Britannic majesty, took possession of Ulietea, and the  three neighbouring islands, Huaheine, Otaha, and Bolabola all of which  were in sight.    On the 21st, the master was despatched in the longboat, to examine the  coast of the south part of the island; and one of the mates was sent  in the yawl, to sound the harbour where the Endeavour lay. At the same  time Lieutenant Cook went himself in the pinnace, to survey that part  of Ulietea which lies to the north. Mr. Banks likewise, and the  gentlemen again went on shore, and employed themselves in trading with  the natives, and in examining the productions and curiosities of the  country; but they saw nothing worthy of notice, excepting some human  jaw-bones, which, like scalps among the Indians of North America, were  trophies of war, and had probably been hung up, by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7787"],[0,"A Complete Grammar of Esperanto (#9)"],[1,"vento  auxdis la ventoflagon, kaj baldaux venis.

The demonstrative pronoun \"tiu\", that, is used to indicate a person  or a definitely specified thing. The plural is \"tiuj\", those:       Tiu estas la via, kaj mi volas tiun,        that is yours, and I wish that one.     Tiuj estos koleraj kontraux vi, those will be angry with you.     Li auxdis tiujn, he heard those (persons, or things).    57. The demonstrative pronoun \"tiu\" is also used as a \"pronominal  adjective\", in agreement with a noun:       Tiu vento estos varma, that wind will be warm.     Mi vidas tiun ventoflagon, I see that weathercock.     Tiuj infanoj estas junaj, those children are young.     Mi trovos tiujn librojn, I shall find those books.                           TENSES IN INDIRECT QUOTATIONS.    58. The verb in an indirect statement (53) or an indirect question  remains in the same tense in which it would be if the statement or  question were direct. (In English this is true only if the introductory  verb is present or future, since after an introductory past tense the  tense of the indirect quotation is changed, and \"am, is, are, have,  will\" become \"was, were, had, would,\" etc.)       Mi diras ke li estas bona, I say that he is good.     \"  diris \"  \"    \"    \"  , I said that he was good.     \"  diros \"  \"    \"    \"  , I shall say that he is good.     Li miras cxu mi auxdas, he wonders whether I hear.     \"  miris  \"   \"   \"   , he wondered whether I heard.     \"  miros  \"   \"   \"   , he will wonder whether I hear.     Mi opiniis ke gxi estas bona, I thought that it was good                                         (I thought \"it is good\").     Oni miris cxu li venos, they wondered whether he would come                                         (they wondered \"will he come?\").    [Footnote: An indirect question is introduced by \"cxu\", whether, after  verbs meaning \"ask,\" \"wonder,\" \"know,\" etc.: \"Mi miras cxu li venis\", I  wonder whether he came. \"Oni demandas cxu li estas ricxa\", people ask  whether he is rich.]                            FORMATION OF FEMININE NOUNS.    59. Feminine nouns corresponding to distinctly masculine nouns such as  \"frato\", \"knabo\", \"viro\", may be formed from these by inserting the  suffix \"-in-\" just before the noun-ending \"-o\":       fratino = sister                   patrino = mother        (from frato, brother).             (from patro, father).     knabino = girl                     virino = woman        (from knabo, boy).                 (from viro, man).      [Footnote: Cf. English names similarly formed from masculine names,  as \"Pauline, Josephine, Ernestine, Geraldine,\" etc., also German  \"Koenigin\", queen, from \"Koenig\", king; \"Loewin\", lioness, from \"Loewe\",  lion, etc.]                                     VOCABULARY       almenaux = at least.               paroli = to talk, to speak.     cxapelo = hat.                     parko = park.     cxielo = sky, heaven.              preskaux = almost.     filo = son.                        pri = concerning, about.     konstrui = to build.               promeni = to take a walk.     miri = to wonder.                  super = above.     morgaux = tomorrow.                timi = to fear, to be afraid (of).     nubo = cloud.                      tiu = that (56).     ombrelo = umbrella.                zorga = careful.                                    EN LA PARKO.    Miaj junaj amiko kaj amikino, kaj ankaux ilia patrino, iris hieraux al  la parko. La infanoj diris al la patrino ke la parko estas agrabla,  kaj ke ili volas promeni en gxi. La knabino parolis al sia frato pri  la belaj floroj. Sxi diris al li ke la floroj velkas, kaj ke la herbo  en preskaux la tuta parko bezonas pluvon. La knabo diris hodiaux al  mi ke hieraux li kaj lia fratino auxdis la birdojn en la arboj super  siaj kapoj. Li diris ke li miris pri tiuj birdoj, tamen li opinias ke  la birdoj baldaux konstruos siajn nestojn en tiuj arboj. La infanoj  promenis, kaj baldaux ili vidis ke grizaj nuboj venas sur la cxielon,  kaj mia juna amikino timis ke pluvos. Sxi parolis al la patrino pri la  nuboj kaj la pluvo, montris al sxi la grizajn nubojn, kaj diris ke si  volas iri al la domo. Ili komencis marsxi al la strato, kaj preskaux  kuris, cxar ili ne havis ombrelon. Tra la fenestroj de la domoj oni  rigardis ilin, kaj la knabo miris cxu li kaj liaj patrino kaj fratino  amuzas tiujn virojn kaj virinojn. Tamen la patrino diris ke sxi ne timas  ke sxi amuzos tiujn, sed ke sxi timas la pluvon. Sxi kaj la filino volas  esti zorgaj pri almenaux la novaj cxapeloj. La filo diris al sxi ke li  ankaux estas zorga, sed ke li opinias ke ne pluvos. Baldaux la patro  venis al ili, kaj portis ombrelojn, cxar li ankaux timis la pluvon.  Li miris cxu la infanoj kaj ilia patrino havas ombrelojn. Baldaux  pluvis, sed ili estis sekaj, cxar ili havis la ombrelojn. Morgaux ili ne  promenos en la parko, sed iros al la urbo.                             SENTENCES FOR TRANSLATION.    1. The east wind is dry and the south wind will be too warm. 2. A  west wind blew against the weathercock, but the grain needed a south  wind. 3 A north wind is blowing and I think that it will soon snow. 4.  It (51) will be beautiful weather tomorrow, because a pleasant wind  is now blowing. 5. The flowers will wither because those children  gathered them. 6. They are talking about that park, but I do not wish to  take-a-walk, because there are clouds in (on) the sky. 7. At least we  shall take an umbrella, and my brother will hold it over our heads. 8.  My sister said \"Mother and I are-afraid that it will rain.\" 9. My young  sister will be careful about that new umbrella. 10. I wonder whether  she will take-a-walk tomorrow. 11. That park is pleasant and the grass  is soft and green. 12. The birds are building their nests now, in those  branches above our heads. 13.

She will be careful of (about) that hat. 17. My father's  friend is very careful of his son. 18. One sees that he is not a strong  boy.                                    LESSON XIV.                      THE DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUN \"CXI TIU\".    60. The demonstrative pronoun (and pronominal adjective) meaning \"this\"  is formed by using with \"tiu\" (56) the word \"cxi\", which expresses the  general idea of nearness or proximity. (Consequently the literal meaning  of \"cxi tiu\" is \"that one nearby\", \"that one here\".) The word \"cxi\" may  either precede or follow the pronoun:       Cxi tiu estas la mia, this is mine.     Mi vidis cxi tiun, I saw this one.     Cxu vi volas tiujn cxi? Do you wish these?     Cxi tiu knabino estas mia fratino, this girl is my sister.     Mi vidis cxi tiujn cxapelojn, I saw these hats.     Cxi tiuj amikoj promenos, these friends will take a walk.    61. The words \"tiu\" and \"cxi tiu\" may be used to distinguish between  persons or things \"previously\" mentioned and \"just\" mentioned:       Gertrude kaj Mario estas en la parko.     Tiu rigardas la florojn, cxi tiu kolektas ilin.       Gertrude and Mary are in the park.     The former (that one) looks at the flowers,     the latter (this one) gathers them.                   POSSESSIVE FORM OF THE DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUN.    62. To express possession, the demonstrative pronouns \"tiu\" and \"cxi  tiu\" have the special possessive or genitive forms \"ties\", that one's,  and \"cxi ties\", this one's. The use of \"ties\" and \"cxi ties\" to mean  \"the former\" and \"the latter\" is similar to the use of \"tiu\" and \"cxi  tiu\" shown in 61:         Mi iris al ties domo, I went to that one's"]]]
