[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/871"],[0,"The Golden Sayings of Epictetus, with the Hymn of Cleanthes (#9)"],[1," shall I fly? Can any man cast  me beyond the limits of the World? It may not be! And whithersoever I  go, there shall I still find Sun, Moon, and Stars; there I shall find  dreams, and omens, and converse with the Gods!          CXIII    Furthermore the true Cynic must know that he is sent as a Messenger from  God to men, to show unto them that as touching good and evil they are  in error; looking for these where they are not to be found, nor ever  bethinking themselves where they are. And like Diogenes when brought  before Philip after the battle of Chaeronea, the Cynic must remember  that he is a Spy. For a Spy he really is--to bring back word what things  are on Man's side, and what against him. And when he had diligently  observed all, he must come back with a true report, not terrified into  announcing them to be foes that are no foes, nor otherwise perturbed or  confounded by the things of sense.          CXIV    How can it be that one who hath nothing, neither raiment, nor house,  nor home, nor bodily tendance, nor servant, nor city, should yet live  tranquil and contented? Behold God hath sent you a man to show you in  act and deed that it may be so. Behold me! I have neither house nor  possessions nor servants: the ground is my couch; I have no wife, no  children, no shelter--nothing but earth and sky, and one poor cloak. And  what lack I yet? am I not untouched by sorrow, by fear? am I not free?  . . . when have I laid anything to the charge of God or Man? when have I  accused any? hath any of you seen me with a sorrowful countenance? And  in what wise treat I those of whom you stand in fear and awe? Is it not  as slaves? Who when he seeth me doth not think that he beholdeth his  Master and his King?          CXV    Give thyself more diligently to reflection: know thyself: take counsel  with the Godhead: without God put thine hand unto nothing!          CXVI    \"But to marry and to rear offspring,\" said the young man, \"will the  Cynic hold himself bound to undertake this as a chief duty?\"    Grant me a republic of wise men, answered Epictetus, and perhaps none  will lightly take the Cynic life upon him. For on whose account should  he embrace that method of life? Suppose however that he does, there will  then be nothing to hinder his marrying and rearing offspring. For his  wife will be even such another as himself, and likewise her father; and  in like manner will his children be brought up.    But in the present condition of things, which resembles an Army in  battle array, ought not the Cynic to be free from all distraction and  given wholly to the service of God, so that he can go in and out among  men, neither fettered by the duties nor entangled by the relations of  common life? For if he transgress them, he will forfeit the character of  a good man and true; whereas if he observe them, there is an end to him  as the Messenger, the Spy, the Herald of the Gods!          CXVII    Ask me if you choose if a Cynic shall engage in the administration of  the State. O fool, seek you a nobler administration that that in which  he is engaged? Ask you if a man shall come forward in the Athenian  assembly and talk about revenue and supplies, when his business is to  converse with all men, Athenians, Corinthians, and Romans alike, not  about supplies, not about revenue, nor yet peace and war, but about  Happiness and Misery, Prosperity and Adversity, Slavery and Freedom?    Ask you whether a man shall engage in the administration of the State  who has engaged in such an Administration as this? Ask me too if he  shall govern; and again I will answer, Fool, what greater government  shall he hold than he holds already?          CXVIII    Such a man needs also to have a certain habit of body. If he appears  consumptive, thin and pale, his testimony has no longer the same  authority. He must not only prove to the unlearned by showing them what  his Soul is that it is possible to be a good man apart from all that  they admire; but he must also show them, by his body, that a plain  and simple manner of life under the open sky does no harm to the body  either. \"See, I am proof of this! and my body also.\" As Diogenes used to  do, who went about fresh of look and by the very appearance of his body  drew men's eyes. But if a Cynic is an object of pity, he seems a  mere beggar; all turn away, all are offended at him. Nor should he be  slovenly of look, so as not to scare men from him in this way either; on  the contrary, his very roughness should be clean and attractive.          CXIX    Kings and tyrants have armed guards wherewith to chastise certain  persons, though they themselves be evil. But to the Cynic conscience  gives this power--not arms and guards. When he knows that he has watched  and laboured on behalf of mankind: that sleep hath found him pure,  and left him purer still: that his thoughts have been the thought of  a Friend of the Gods--of a servant, yet one that hath a part in the  government of the Supreme God: that the words are ever on his lips:--    Lead me, O God, and thou, O Destiny!    as well as these:--    If this be God's will, so let it be!    Why should he not speak boldly unto his own brethren, unto his  children--in a word, unto all that are akin to him!          CXX    Does a Philosopher apply to people to come and hear him? does he not  rather, of his own nature, attract those that will be benefited  by him--like the sun that warms, the food that sustains them? What  Physician applies to men to come and be healed? (Though indeed I hear  that the Physicians at Rome do nowadays apply for patients--in my time  they were applied to.) I apply to you to come and hear that you are in  evil case; that what deserves your attention most is the last thing to  gain it; that you know not good from evil, and are in short a hapless  wretch; a fine way to apply! though unless the words of the Philosopher  affect you thus, speaker and speech are alike dead.          CXXI    A Philosopher's school is a Surgery: pain, not pleasure, you should have  felt therein. For on entering none of you is whole. One has a shoulder  out of joint, another an abscess: a third suffers from an issue, a  fourth from pains in the head. And am I then to sit down and treat you  to pretty sentiments and empty flourishes, so that you may applaud me  and depart, with neither shoulder, nor head, nor issue, nor abscess a  whit the better for your visit? Is it then for this that young men are  to quit their homes, and leave parents, friends, kinsmen and substance  to mouth out Bravo to your empty phrases!          CXXII    If any be unhappy, let him remember that he is unhappy by reason of  himself alone. For God hath made all men to enjoy felicity and constancy  of good.          CXXII    Shall we never wean ourselves--shall we never heed the teachings of  Philosophy (unless perchance they have been sounding in our ears like  an enchanter's drone):--    This World is one great City, and one is the substance whereof it is  fashioned: a certain period indeed there needs must be, while these give  place to those; some must perish for others to succeed; some move and  some abide: yet all is full of friends--first God, then Men, whom Nature  hath bound by ties of kindred each to each.          CXXIV    Nor did the hero weep and lament at leaving his children orphans. For he  knew that no man is an orphan, but it is the Father that careth for all  continually and for evermore. Not by mere report had he heard that  the Supreme God is the Father of men: seeing that he called Him Father  believing Him so to be, and in all that he did had ever his eyes fixed  upon Him. Wherefore in whatsoever place he was, there is was given him  to live happily.          CXXV    Know you not that the thing is a warfare? one man's duty is to mount  guard, another must go out to reconnoitre, a third to battle; all cannot  be in one place, nor would it even be expedient. But you, instead of  executing you Commander's orders, complain if aught harsher than usual  is enjoined; not understanding to what condition you are bringing the  army, so far as in you lies. If all were to follow your example, none  would dig a trench, none would cast a rampart around the camp, none  would keep watch, or expose himself to danger; but all turn out useless  for the service of war. . . . Thus it is here also. Every life is a  warfare, and that long and various. You must fulfil a soldier's duty,  and obey each order at your commander's nod: aye, if it be possible,  divine what he would have done; for between that Command and this, there  is no comparison, either in might or in excellence.    CXXVI    Have you again forgotten? Know you not that a good man does nothing for  appearance' sake, but for the sake of having done right? . . .    \"Is there no reward then?\"    Reward! do you seek any greater reward for a good man than doing what is  right and just? Yet at the Great Games you look for nothing else; there  the victor's crown you deem enough. Seems it to you so small a thing and  worthless, to be a good man, and happy therein?          CXXVII    It befits thee not to be unhappy by reason of any, but rather to be  happy by reason of all men, and especially by reason of God, who formed  us to this end.          CXXVIII    What, did Diogenes love no man, he that was so gentle, so true a friend  to men as cheerfully to endure such bodily hardships for the common  weal of all mankind? But how loved he them? As behoved a minister of the  Supreme God, alike caring for men and subject unto God.          CXXIX    I am by Nature made for my own good; not for my own evil.          CXXX    Remind thyself that he whom thou lovest is mortal--that what thou lovest  is not thine own; it is given thee for the present, not irrevocably nor  for ever, but even as a fig or a bunch of grapes at the appointed season  of the year. . . .    \"But these are words of evil omen.\". . .    What, callest"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8713"],[0,"A Man of Means (#9)"],[1,"conjured up a picture of a white-haired elder  with a fatherly manner.    \"Oh, he's old, is he?\"    \"Twenty-four.\"    There was a brief silence. Something in the girl's expression stung  Roland. She wore a rapt look, as if she were dreaming of the absent  Petheram, confound him. He would show her that Petheram was not the only  man worth looking rapt about.    He rose.    \"Would you mind giving me your address?\" he said.    \"Why?\"    \"In order,\" said Roland carefully, \"that I may offer you your former  employment on 'Squibs.' I am going to buy it.\"    After all, your man of dash and enterprise, your Napoleon, does have  his moments. Without looking at her, he perceived that he had bowled  her over completely. Something told him that she was staring at him,  open-mouthed. Meanwhile, a voice within him was muttering anxiously, \"I  wonder how much this is going to cost.\"    \"You're going to buy 'Squibs!'\"    Her voice had fallen away to an awestruck whisper.    \"I am.\"    She gulped.    \"Well, I think you're wonderful.\"    So did Roland.    \"Where will a letter find you?\" he asked.    \"My name is March. Bessie March. I'm living at twenty-seven Guildford  Street.\"    \"Twenty-seven. Thank you. Good morning. I will communicate with you in  due course.\"    He raised his hat and walked away. He had only gone a few steps, when  there was a patter of feet behind him. He turned.    \"I--I just wanted to thank you,\" she said.    \"Not at all,\" said Roland. \"Not at all.\"    He went on his way, tingling with just triumph. Petheram? Who was  Petheram? Who, in the name of goodness, was Petheram? He had put  Petheram in his proper place, he rather fancied. Petheram, forsooth.  Laughable.    A copy of the current number of 'Squibs,' purchased at a book-stall,  informed him, after a minute search to find the editorial page, that the  offices of the paper were in Fetter Lane. It was evidence of his exalted  state of mind that he proceeded thither in a cab.    Fetter Lane is one of those streets in which rooms that have only just  escaped being cupboards by a few feet achieve the dignity of offices.  There might have been space to swing a cat in the editorial sanctum of  'Squibs,' but it would have been a near thing. As for the outer office,  in which a vacant-faced lad of fifteen received Roland and instructed  him to wait while he took his card in to Mr. Petheram, it was a mere  box. Roland was afraid to expand his chest for fear of bruising it.    The boy returned to say that Mr. Petheram would see him.    Mr. Petheram was a young man with a mop of hair, and an air of almost  painful restraint. He was in his shirt-sleeves, and the table before  him was heaped high with papers. Opposite him, evidently in the act of  taking his leave was a comfortable-looking man of middle age with a  red face and a short beard. He left as Roland entered and Roland was  surprized to see Mr. Petheram spring to his feet, shake his fist at  the closing door, and kick the wall with a vehemence which brought down  several inches of discolored plaster.    \"Take a seat,\" he said, when he had finished this performance. \"What can  I do for you?\"    Roland had always imagined that editors in their private offices were  less easily approached and, when approached, more brusk. The fact was  that Mr. Petheram, whose optimism nothing could quench, had mistaken him  for a prospective advertiser.    \"I want to buy the paper,\" said Roland. He was aware that this was an  abrupt way of approaching the subject, but, after all, he did want to  buy the paper, so why not say so?    Mr. Petheram fizzed in his chair. He glowed with excitement.    \"Do you mean to tell me there's a single book-stall in London which has  sold out? Great Scott, perhaps they've all sold out! How many did you  try?\"    \"I mean buy the whole paper. Become proprietor, you know.\"    Roland felt that he was blushing, and hated himself for it. He ought to  be carrying this thing through with an air. Mr. Petheram looked at him  blankly.    \"Why?\" he asked.    \"Oh, I don't know,\" said Roland. He felt the interview was going all  wrong. It lacked a stateliness which this kind of interview should have  had.    \"Honestly?\" said Mr. Petheram. \"You aren't pulling my leg?\"    Roland nodded. Mr. Petheram appeared to struggle with his conscience,  and finally to be worsted by it, for his next remarks were limpidly  honest.    \"Don't you be an ass,\" he said. \"You don't know what you're letting  yourself in for. Did you see that blighter who went out just now? Do you  know who he is? That's the fellow we've got to pay five pounds a week to  for life.\"    \"Why?\"    \"We can't get rid of him. When the paper started, the proprietors--not  the present ones--thought it would give the thing a boom if they had  a football competition with a first prize of a fiver a week for life.  Well, that's the man who won it. He's been handed down as a legacy from  proprietor to proprietor, till now we've got him. Ages ago they tried  to get him to compromise for a lump sum down, but he wouldn't. Said he  would only spend it, and preferred to get it by the week. Well, by the  time we've paid that vampire, there isn't much left out of our profits.  That's why we are at the present moment a little understaffed.\"    A frown clouded Mr. Petheram's brow. Roland wondered if he was thinking  of Bessie March.    \"I know all about that,\" he said.    \"And you still want to buy the thing?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"But what on earth for? Mind you, I ought not to be crabbing my own  paper like this, but you seem a good chap, and I don't want to see you  landed. Why are you doing it?\"    \"Oh, just for fun.\"    \"Ah, now you're talking. If you can afford expensive amusements, go  ahead.\"    He put his feet on the table, and lit a short pipe. His gloomy views on  the subject of 'Squibs' gave way to a wave of optimism.    \"You know,\" he said, \"there's really a lot of life in the old rag yet.  If it were properly run. What has hampered us has been lack of capital.  We haven't been able to advertise. I'm bursting with ideas for booming  the paper, only naturally you can't do it for nothing. As for editing,  what I don't know about editing--but perhaps you had got somebody else  in your mind?\"    \"No, no,\" said Roland, who would not have known an editor from an  office-boy. The thought of interviewing prospective editors appalled  him.    \"Very well, then,\" resumed Mr. Petheram, reassured, kicking over a heap  of papers to give more room for his feet. \"Take it that I continue as  editor. We can discuss terms later. Under the present regime I have been  doing all the work in exchange for a happy home. I suppose you won't  want to spoil the ship for a ha'porth of tar? In other words, you would  sooner have a happy, well-fed editor running about the place than a  broken-down wreck who might swoon from starvation?\"    \"But one moment,\" said Roland. \"Are you sure that the present  proprietors will want to sell?\"    \"Want to sell,\" cried Mr. Petheram enthusiastically. \"Why, if they know  you want to buy, you've as much chance of getting away from them without  the paper as--as--well, I can't think of anything that has such a poor  chance of anything. If you aren't quick on your feet, they'll cry on  your shoulder. Come along, and we'll round them up now.\"    He struggled into his coat, and gave his hair an impatient brush with a  note-book.    \"There's just one other thing,\" said Roland. \"I have been a regular  reader of 'Squibs' for some time, and I particularly admire the way in  which the Woman's Page----\"    \"You mean you want to reengage the editress? Rather. You couldn't do  better. I was going to suggest it myself. Now, come along quick before  you change your mind or wake up.\"    Within a very few days of becoming sole proprietor of 'Squibs,' Roland  began to feel much as a man might who, a novice at the art of steering  cars, should find himself at the wheel of a runaway motor. Young Mr.  Petheram had spoken nothing less than the truth when he had said that  he was full of ideas for booming the paper. The infusion of capital into  the business acted on him like a powerful stimulant. He exuded ideas at  every pore.    Roland's first notion had been to engage a staff of contributors. He was  under the impression that contributors were the life-blood of a weekly  journal. Mr. Petheram corrected this view. He consented to the purchase  of a lurid serial story, but that was the last concession he made.  Nobody could accuse Mr. Petheram of lack of energy. He was willing, even  anxious, to write the whole paper himself, with the exception of the  Woman's Page, now brightly conducted once more by Miss March. What he  wanted Roland to concentrate himself upon was the supplying of capital  for ingenious advertising schemes.    \"How would it be,\" he asked one morning--he always began his remarks  with, \"How would it be?\"--\"if we paid a man to walk down Piccadilly in  white skin-tights with the word 'Squibs' painted in red letters across  his chest?\"    Roland thought it would certainly not be.    \"Good sound advertising stunt,\" urged Mr. Petheram. \"You don't like it?  All right. You're the boss. Well, how would it be to have a squad of  men dressed as Zulus with white shields bearing the legend 'Squibs?' See  what I mean? Have them sprinting along the Strand shouting, 'Wah! Wah!  Wah! Buy it! Buy it!' It would make people talk.\"    Roland emerged from these interviews with his skin crawling with modest  apprehension. His was a retiring nature, and the thought of Zulus  sprinting down the Strand shouting \"Wah! Wah! Wah! Buy it! Buy it!\" with  reference to his personal property appalled him.    He was beginning now heartily to regret having bought the paper, as  he generally regretted every definite step which he took. The glow of  romance which had sustained him during the preliminary negotiations had  faded entirely. A girl has to be possessed of unusual charm to"]]]
