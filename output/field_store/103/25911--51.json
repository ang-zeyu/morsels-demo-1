For in the irrational  world, between the different kinds, there reigns perpetual strife and  bloodshed, the strong devouring the weak and the incapable; and when  failure of life clouds the brightness of that lower soul, which is  theirs, the end is not long delayed. Thus the life that has lasted many  days goes out with a brief pang, and in its going gives new vigor to the  strong that have yet many days to live. Thus also does the ever-living  earth from the dust of dead generations of leaves re-make a fresh  foliage, and for herself a new garment.    \"We only, of all things having life, being like the Father, slay not nor  are slain, and are without enemies in the earth; for even the lower  kinds, which have not reason, know without reason that we are highest on  the earth, and see in us, alone of all his works, the majesty of the  Father, and lose all their rage in our presence. Therefore, when the  night is near, when life is a burden and we remember our mortality, we  hasten the end, that those we love may cease to sorrow at the sight of  our decline; and we know that this is his will who called us into being,  and gave us life and joy on the earth for a season, but not forever.    \"It is better to lay down the life that is ours, to leave all  things--the love of our kindred; the beauty of the world and of the  house; the labor in which we take delight, to go forth and be no more;  but the bitterness endures not, and is scarcely tasted when in our last  moments we remember that our labor has borne fruit; that the letters we  have written perish not with us, but remain as a testimony and a joy to  succeeding generations, and live in the house forever.    \"For the house is the image of the world, and we that live and labor in  it are the image of our Father who made the world; and, like him, we  labor to make for ourselves a worthy habitation, which shall not shame  our teacher. This is his desire; for in all his works, and that  knowledge which is like pure water to one that thirsts, and satisfies  and leaves no taste of bitterness on the palate, we learn the will of  him that called us into life. All the knowledge we seek, the invention  and skill we possess, and the labor of our hands, has this purpose only:  for all knowledge and invention and labor having any other purpose  whatsoever is empty and vain in comparison, and unworthy of those that  are made in the image of the Father of life. For just as the bodily  senses may become perverted, and the taste lose its discrimination, so  that the hungry man will devour acrid fruits and poisonous herbs for  aliment, so is the mind capable of seeking out new paths, and a  knowledge which leads only to misery and destruction.    \"Thus we know that in the past men sought after knowledge of various  kinds, asking not whether it was for good or for evil: but every offense  of the mind and the body has its appropriate reward; and while their  knowledge grew apace, that better knowledge and discrimination which the  Father gives to every living soul, both in man and in beast, was taken  from them. Thus by increasing their riches they were made poorer; and,  like one who, forgetting the limits that are set to his faculties, gazes  steadfastly on the sun, by seeing much they become afflicted with  blindness. But they know not their poverty and blindness, and were not  satisfied; but were like shipwrecked men on a lonely and barren rock in  the midst of the sea, who are consumed with thirst, and drink of no  sweet spring, but of the bitter wave, and thirst, and drink again, until  madness possesses their brains, and death releases them from their  misery. Thus did they thirst, and drink again, and were crazed; being  inflamed with the desire to learn the secrets of nature, hesitating not  to dip their hands in blood, seeking in the living tissues of animals  for the hidden springs of life. For in their madness they hoped by  knowledge to gain absolute dominion over nature, thereby taking from the  Father of the world his prerogative.    \"But their vain ambition lasted not, and the end of it was death. The  madness of their minds preyed on their bodies, and worms were bred in  their corrupted flesh: and these, after feeding on their tissues,  changed their forms; and becoming winged, flew out in the breath of  their nostrils, like clouds of winged ants that issue in the springtime  from their breeding-places; and, flying from body to body, filled the  race of men in all places with corruption and decay; and the Mother of  men was thus avenged of her children for their pride and folly, for they  perished miserably, devoured of worms.    \"Of the human race only a small remnant survived, these being men of an  humble mind, who had lived apart and unknown to their fellows; and after  long centuries they went forth into the wilderness of earth and  repeopled it; but nowhere did they find any trace or record of those  that had passed away; for earth had covered all their ruined works with  her dark mold and green forests, even as a man hides unsightly scars on  his body with a new and beautiful garment. Nor is it known to us when  this destruction fell upon the race of men; we only know that the  history thereof was graven an hundred centuries ago on the granite  pillars of the House of Evor, on the plains between the sea and the  snow-covered mountains of Elf. Thither in past ages some of our pilgrims  journeyed, and have brought a record of these things; nor in our house  only are they known, but in many houses throughout the world have they  been written for the instruction of all men and a warning for all time.    \"But to mankind there shall come no second darkness of error, nor  seeking after vain knowledge; and in the Father's House there shall be  no second desolation, but the sounds of joy and melody, which were  silent, shall be heard everlastingly; since we had now continued long in  this even mind, seeking only to inform ourselves of his will; until as  in a clear crystal without flaw shining with colored light, or as a  glassy lake reflecting within itself the heavens and every cloud and  star, so is he reflected in our minds; and in the house we are his  viceregents, and in the world his co-workers; and for the glory which he  has in his work we have a like glory in ours.    \"He is our teacher. Morning and evening throughout the various world, in  the procession of the seasons, and in the blue heavens powdered with  stars; in mountain and plain and many-toned forest; in the sounding  walls of the ocean, and in the billowy seas through which we pass in  peril from land to land, we read his thoughts and listen to his voice.  Here do we learn with what far-seeing intelligence he has laid the  foundations of his everlasting mansion, how skillfully he has builded  its walls, and with what prodigal richness he has decorated all his  works. For the sunlight and moonlight and the blueness of heaven are  his; the sea with its tides; the blackness and the lightnings of the  tempest, and snow, and changeful winds, and green and yellow leaf; his  are also the silver rain and the rainbow, the shadows and the  many-colored mists, which he flings like a mantle over all the world.  Herein do we learn that he loves a stable building, and that the  foundations and walls shall endure for ever: yet loves not sameness;  thus, from day to day and from season to season do all things change  their aspect, and the walls and floor and roof of his dwelling are  covered with a new glory. But to us it is not given to rise to this  supreme majesty in our works; therefore do we, like him yet unable to  reach so great a height, borrow nothing one from the other, but in each  house learn separately from him alone who has infinite riches; so that  every habitation, changeless and eternal in itself, shall yet differ  from all others, having its own special beauty and splendor: for we  inhabit one house only, but the Father of men inhabits all.    \"These things are written for the refreshment and delight of those who  may no longer journey into distant lands; and they are in the library of  the house in the seven thousand volumes of the Houses of the World which  our pilgrims have visited in past ages. For once in a lifetime is it  ordained that a man shall leave his own place and travel for the space  of ten years, visiting the most famous houses in every land he enters,  and also seeking out those of which no report has reached us.    \"When the time for this chief adventure comes, and we go forth for a  long period, there is compensation for every weariness, with absence of  kindred and the sweet shelter of our own home: for now do we learn the  infinite riches of the Father; for just as the day changes every hour,  from the morning to the evening twilight, so does the aspect of the  world alter as we progress from day to day; and in all places our  fellow-men, learning as we do from him only, and seeing that which is  nearest, give a special color of nature to their lives and their houses;  and every house, with the family which inhabits it, in their  conversation and the arts in which they excel, is like a round lake set  about with hills, wherein may be seen that visible world. And in all the  earth there is no land without inhabitants, whether on wide continents  or islands of the sea; and in all nature there is no grandeur or beauty  or grace which men have not copied; knowing that this is pleasing to the  Father: for we, that are made like him, delight not to work without  witnesses; and we are his witnesses in the earth, taking pleasure in his  works, even as he also does in ours.    \"Thus, at the beginning of our journey to the far south, where we go to  look first on those bright lands, which have hotter suns and a greater  variety than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7413"],[0,"Egyptian Tales, Translated from the Papyri: Second series, XVIIIth to XIXth (#9)"],[1,"of the spells, and saw the sun shining in the sky,  with all the gods, the full moon, and the stars in their shapes; he saw  the fishes of the deep, for a divine power was present that brought them  up from the water. He then read the spell upon the workmen that he had  made, and taken from the haven, and said to them, 'Work for me, back to  the place from which I came.' And they toiled night and day, and so he  came back to the place where I sat by the river of Koptos; I had not  drunk nor eaten anything, and had done nothing on earth, but sat like  one who is gone to the grave.    \"I then told Na-nefer-ka-ptah that I wished to see this book, for which  we had taken so much trouble. He gave the book into my hands; and when I  read a page of the spells in it I also enchanted heaven and earth, the  abyss, the mountains, and the sea; I also knew what the birds of the  sky, the fishes of the deep, and the beasts of the hills all said. I  read another page of the spells, and I saw the sun shining in the sky  with all the gods, the full moon, and the stars in their shapes; I saw  the fishes of the deep, for a divine power was present that brought them  up from the water. As I could not write, I asked Na-nefer-ka-ptah, who  was a good writer, and a very learned one; he called for a new piece of  papyrus, and wrote on it all that was in the book before him. He dipped  it in beer, and washed it off in the liquid; for he knew that if it were  washed off, and he drank it, he would know all that there was in the  writing.    \"We returned back to Koptos the same day, and made a feast before Isis  of Koptos and Harpokrates. We then went to the haven and sailed, and  went northward of Koptos. And as we went on Thoth discovered all that  Na-nefer-ka-ptah had done with the book; and Thoth hastened to tell Ra,  and said, 'Now know that my book and my revelation are with  Na-nefer-ka-ptah, son of the King Mer-neb-ptah. He has forced himself  into my place, and robbed it, and seized my box with the writings, and  killed my guards who protected it.' And Ra replied to him, 'He is before  you, take him and all his kin.'He sent a power from heaven with the  command, 'Do not let Na-nefer-ka-ptah return safe to Memphis with all  his kin.' And after this hour, the little boy Mer-ab, going out from the  awning of the royal boat, fell into the river: he called on Ra, and  everybody who was on the bank raised a cry. Na-nefer-ka-ptah went out of  the cabin, and read the spell over him; he brought his body up because a  divine power brought him to the surface. He read another spell over him,  and made him tell of all what happened to him, and of what Thoth had  said before Ra.    \"We turned back with him to Koptos. We brought him to the Good House, we  fetched the people to him, and made one embalm him; and we buried him in  his coffin in the cemetery of Koptos like a great and noble person.    \"And Na-nefer-ka-ptah, my brother, said, 'Let us go down, let us not  delay, for the king has not yet heard of what has happened to him, and  his heart will be sad about it.' So we went to the haven, we sailed, and  did not stay to the north of Koptos. When we were come to the place  where the little boy Mer-ab had fallen in the water, I went out from the  awning of the royal boat, and I fell into the river. They called  Na-nefer-ka-ptah, and he came out from the cabin of the royal boat; he  read a spell over me, and brought my body up, because a divine power  brought me to the surface. He drew me out, and read the spell over me,  and made me tell him of all that had happened to me, and of what Thoth  had said before Ra.  Then he turned back with me to Koptos, he brought  me to the Good House, he fetched the people to me, and made one embalm  me, as great and noble people are buried, and laid me in the tomb where  Mer-ab my young child was.    \"He turned to the haven, and sailed down, and delayed not in the north  of Koptos. When he was come to the place where we fell into the river,  he said to his heart, 'Shall I not better turn back again to Koptos,  that I may lie by them? For, if not, when I go down to Memphis, and the  king asks after his children, what shall I say to him? Can I tell him,  \"I have taken your children to the Thebaid, and killed them, while I  remained alive, and I have come to Memphis still alive\"?' Then he made  them bring him a linen cloth of striped byssus; he made a band, and  bound the book firmly, and tied it upon him. Na-nefer-ka-ptah then went  out of the awning of the royal boat and fell into the river. He cried on  Ra; and all those who were on the bank made an outcry, saying, 'Great  woe! Sad woe! Is he lost, that good scribe and able man that has no  equal?'    \"The royal boat went on, without any one on earth knowing where  Na-nefer-ka-ptah was. It went on to Memphis, and they told all this to  the king. Then the king went down to the royal boat in mourning, and all  the soldiers and high priests and priests of Ptah were in mourning, and  all the officials and courtiers. And when he saw Na-nefer-ka-ptah, who  was in the inner cabin of the royal boat--from his rank of high  scribe--he lifted him up. And they saw the book by him; and the king  said, 'Let one hide this book that is with him.' And the officers of the  king, the priests of Ptah, and the high priest of Ptah, said to the  king, 'Our Lord, may the king live as long as the sun! Na-nefer-ka-ptah  was a good scribe, and a very skilful man.' And the king had him laid in  his Good House to the sixteenth day, and then had him wrapped to the  thirty-fifth day, and laid him out to the seventieth day, and then had  him put in his grave in his resting-place.    \"I have now told you the sorrow which has come upon us because of this  book for which you ask, saying, 'Let it be given to me.' You have no  claim to it; and, indeed, for the sake of it, we have given up our life  on earth.\"    And Setna said to Ahura, \"Give me the book which I see between you and  Na-nefer-ka-ptah; for if you do not I will take it by force.\" Then  Na-nefer-ka-ptah rose from his seat and said, \"Are you Setna, to whom  my wife has told of all these blows of fate, which you have not  suffered? Can you take this book by your skill as a good scribe? If,  indeed, you can play games with me, let us play a game, then, of 52  points.\" And Setna said, \"I am ready,\" and the board and its pieces were  put before him. And Na-nefer-ka-ptah won a game from Setna; and he put  the spell upon him, and defended himself with the game board that was  before him, and sunk him into the ground above his feet. He did the same  at the second game, and won it from Setna, and sunk him into the ground  to his waist.    He did the same at the third game, and made him sink into the ground up  to his ears. Then Setna struck Na-nefer-ka-ptah a great blow with his  hand. And Setna called his brother An-he-hor-eru and said to him.    \"Make haste and go up upon earth, and tell the king all that has  happened to me, and bring me the talisman of my father Ptah, and my  magic books.\"    And he hurried up upon earth, and told the king all that had happened to  Setna. The king said, \"Bring him the talisman of his father Ptah, and  his magic books.\" And An-he-hor-eru hurried down into the tomb; he laid  the talisman on Setna, and he sprang up again immediately. And then  Setna reached out his hand for the book, and took it. Then--as Setna  went out from the tomb--there went a Light before him, and Darkness  behind him. And Ahura wept at him, and she said, \"Glory to the King of  Darkness! Hail to the King of Light! all power is gone from the tomb.\"  But Na-nefer-ka-ptah said to Ahura, \"Do not let your heart be sad; I  will make him bring back this book, with a forked stick in his hand, and  a fire-pan on his head.\" And Setna went out from the tomb, and it closed  behind him as it was before.    Then Setna went to the king, and told him everything that had happened  to him with the book. And the king said to Setna, \"Take back the book to  the grave of Na-nefer-ka-ptah, like a prudent man, or else he will make  you bring it with a forked stick in your hand, and a fire-pan on your  head.\" But Setna would not listen to him; and when Setna had unrolled  the book he did nothing on earth but read it to everybody.    [Here follows a story of how Setna, walking in the court of the temple  of Ptah, met Tabubua, a fascinating girl, daughter of a priest of Bast,  of Ankhtaui; how she repelled his advances, until she had beguiled him  into giving up all his possessions, and slaying his children. At the  last she gives a fearful cry and vanishes, leaving Setna bereft of even  his clothes. This would seem to be merely a dream, by the disappearance  of Tabubua, and by Setna finding his children alive after it all; but on  the other hand he comes to his senses in an unknown place, and is so  terrified as to be quite ready to make restitution to Na-nefer-ka-ptah.  The episode, which is not creditable to Egyptian society, seems to be  intended for one of the vivid dreams which the credulous readily accept  as half realities.]    So Setna went to Memphis, and embraced his children for that they were  alive. And the king said to him, \"Were you not drunk to do so?\" Then  Setna told all things that had happened with Tabubua and  Na-nefer-ka-ptah. And the king said, \"Setna, I have already lifted up my  hand against you before, and said, 'He will kill you if you do not take  back the book to the place you took it from.' But you have never  listened to me till this hour. Now, then, take the book to  Na-nefer-ka-ptah, with a forked stick in your hand, and a fire-pan on  your head.\"    So Setna went out from before the king, with a forked stick in his hand,  and a fire-pan on his head. He went down to the tomb in which was  Na-nefer-ka-ptah.  And Ahura said to him, \"It is Ptah, the great god,  that has brought you back safe.\" Na-nefer-ka-ptah laughed, and "]]]
