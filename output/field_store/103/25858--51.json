As I reached their side a glance showed me that all but a very few eggs  had hatched, the incubator being fairly alive with the hideous little  devils.  They ranged in height from three to four feet, and were moving  restlessly about the enclosure as though searching for food.    As I came to a halt before him, Tars Tarkas pointed over the incubator  and said, \"Sak.\"  I saw that he wanted me to repeat my performance of  yesterday for the edification of Lorquas Ptomel, and, as I must confess  that my prowess gave me no little satisfaction, I responded quickly,  leaping entirely over the parked chariots on the far side of the  incubator.  As I returned, Lorquas Ptomel grunted something at me, and  turning to his warriors gave a few words of command relative to the  incubator.  They paid no further attention to me and I was thus  permitted to remain close and watch their operations, which consisted  in breaking an opening in the wall of the incubator large enough to  permit of the exit of the young Martians.    On either side of this opening the women and the younger Martians, both  male and female, formed two solid walls leading out through the  chariots and quite away into the plain beyond.  Between these walls the  little Martians scampered, wild as deer; being permitted to run the  full length of the aisle, where they were captured one at a time by the  women and older children; the last in the line capturing the first  little one to reach the end of the gauntlet, her opposite in the line  capturing the second, and so on until all the little fellows had left  the enclosure and been appropriated by some youth or female.  As the  women caught the young they fell out of line and returned to their  respective chariots, while those who fell into the hands of the young  men were later turned over to some of the women.    I saw that the ceremony, if it could be dignified by such a name, was  over, and seeking out Sola I found her in our chariot with a hideous  little creature held tightly in her arms.    The work of rearing young, green Martians consists solely in teaching  them to talk, and to use the weapons of warfare with which they are  loaded down from the very first year of their lives.  Coming from eggs  in which they have lain for five years, the period of incubation, they  step forth into the world perfectly developed except in size.  Entirely  unknown to their mothers, who, in turn, would have difficulty in  pointing out the fathers with any degree of accuracy, they are the  common children of the community, and their education devolves upon the  females who chance to capture them as they leave the incubator.    Their foster mothers may not even have had an egg in the incubator, as  was the case with Sola, who had not commenced to lay, until less than a  year before she became the mother of another woman's offspring.  But  this counts for little among the green Martians, as parental and filial  love is as unknown to them as it is common among us.  I believe this  horrible system which has been carried on for ages is the direct cause  of the loss of all the finer feelings and higher humanitarian instincts  among these poor creatures.  From birth they know no father or mother  love, they know not the meaning of the word home; they are taught that  they are only suffered to live until they can demonstrate by their  physique and ferocity that they are fit to live.  Should they prove  deformed or defective in any way they are promptly shot; nor do they  see a tear shed for a single one of the many cruel hardships they pass  through from earliest infancy.    I do not mean that the adult Martians are unnecessarily or  intentionally cruel to the young, but theirs is a hard and pitiless  struggle for existence upon a dying planet, the natural resources of  which have dwindled to a point where the support of each additional  life means an added tax upon the community into which it is thrown.    By careful selection they rear only the hardiest specimens of each  species, and with almost supernatural foresight they regulate the birth  rate to merely offset the loss by death.    Each adult Martian female brings forth about thirteen eggs each year,  and those which meet the size, weight, and specific gravity tests are  hidden in the recesses of some subterranean vault where the temperature  is too low for incubation.  Every year these eggs are carefully  examined by a council of twenty chieftains, and all but about one  hundred of the most perfect are destroyed out of each yearly supply.  At the end of five years about five hundred almost perfect eggs have  been chosen from the thousands brought forth.  These are then placed in  the almost air-tight incubators to be hatched by the sun's rays after a  period of another five years.  The hatching which we had witnessed  today was a fairly representative event of its kind, all but about one  per cent of the eggs hatching in two days.  If the remaining eggs ever  hatched we knew nothing of the fate of the little Martians.  They were  not wanted, as their offspring might inherit and transmit the tendency  to prolonged incubation, and thus upset the system which has maintained  for ages and which permits the adult Martians to figure the proper time  for return to the incubators, almost to an hour.    The incubators are built in remote fastnesses, where there is little or  no likelihood of their being discovered by other tribes.  The result of  such a catastrophe would mean no children in the community for another  five years.  I was later to witness the results of the discovery of an  alien incubator.    The community of which the green Martians with whom my lot was cast  formed a part was composed of some thirty thousand souls.  They roamed  an enormous tract of arid and semi-arid land between forty and eighty  degrees south latitude, and bounded on the east and west by two large  fertile tracts.  Their headquarters lay in the southwest corner of this  district, near the crossing of two of the so-called Martian canals.    As the incubator had been placed far north of their own territory in a  supposedly uninhabited and unfrequented area, we had before us a  tremendous journey, concerning which I, of course, knew nothing.    After our return to the dead city I passed several days in comparative  idleness.  On the day following our return all the warriors had ridden  forth early in the morning and had not returned until just before  darkness fell.  As I later learned, they had been to the subterranean  vaults in which the eggs were kept and had transported them to the  incubator, which they had then walled up for another five years, and  which, in all probability, would not be visited again during that  period.    The vaults which hid the eggs until they were ready for the incubator  were located many miles south of the incubator, and would be visited  yearly by the council of twenty chieftains.  Why they did not arrange  to build their vaults and incubators nearer home has always been a  mystery to me, and, like many other Martian mysteries, unsolved and  unsolvable by earthly reasoning and customs.    Sola's duties were now doubled, as she was compelled to care for the  young Martian as well as for me, but neither one of us required much  attention, and as we were both about equally advanced in Martian  education, Sola took it upon herself to train us together.    Her prize consisted in a male about four feet tall, very strong and  physically perfect; also, he learned quickly, and we had considerable  amusement, at least I did, over the keen rivalry we displayed.  The  Martian language, as I have said, is extremely simple, and in a week I  could make all my wants known and understand nearly everything that was  said to me.  Likewise, under Sola's tutelage, I developed my telepathic  powers so that I shortly could sense practically everything that went  on around me.    What surprised Sola most in me was that while I could catch telepathic  messages easily from others, and often when they were not intended for  me, no one could read a jot from my mind under any circumstances.  At  first this vexed me, but later I was very glad of it, as it gave me an  undoubted advantage over the Martians.          CHAPTER VIII    A FAIR CAPTIVE FROM THE SKY      The third day after the incubator ceremony we set forth toward home,  but scarcely had the head of the procession debouched into the open  ground before the city than orders were given for an immediate and  hasty return.  As though trained for years in this particular  evolution, the green Martians melted like mist into the spacious  doorways of the nearby buildings, until, in less than three minutes,  the entire cavalcade of chariots, mastodons and mounted warriors was  nowhere to be seen.    Sola and I had entered a building upon the front of the city, in fact,  the same one in which I had had my encounter with the apes, and,  wishing to see what had caused the sudden retreat, I mounted to an  upper floor and peered from the window out over the valley and the  hills beyond; and there I saw the cause of their sudden scurrying to  cover.  A huge craft, long, low, and gray-painted, swung slowly over  the crest of the nearest hill.  Following it came another, and another,  and another, until twenty of them, swinging low above the ground,  sailed slowly and majestically toward us.    Each carried a strange banner swung from stem to stern above the upper  works, and upon the prow of each was painted some odd device that  gleamed in the sunlight and showed plainly even at the distance at  which we were from the vessels.  I could see figures crowding the  forward decks and upper works of the air craft.  Whether they had  discovered us or simply were looking at the deserted city"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/624"],[0,"Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887 (#9)"],[1,"at twenty-one and terminating at forty-five. After  forty-five, while discharged from labor, the citizen still remains  liable to special calls, in case of emergencies causing a sudden great  increase in the demand for labor, till he reaches the age of  fifty-five, but such calls are rarely, in fact almost never, made. The  fifteenth day of October of every year is what we call Muster Day,  because those who have reached the age of twenty-one are then mustered  into the industrial service, and at the same time those who, after  twenty-four years' service, have reached the age of forty-five, are  honorably mustered out. It is the great day of the year with us, whence  we reckon all other events, our Olympiad, save that it is annual.\"        Chapter 7    \"It is after you have mustered your industrial army into service,\" I  said, \"that I should expect the chief difficulty to arise, for there  its analogy with a military army must cease. Soldiers have all the same  thing, and a very simple thing, to do, namely, to practice the manual  of arms, to march and stand guard. But the industrial army must learn  and follow two or three hundred diverse trades and avocations. What  administrative talent can be equal to determining wisely what trade or  business every individual in a great nation shall pursue?\"    \"The administration has nothing to do with determining that point.\"    \"Who does determine it, then?\" I asked.    \"Every man for himself in accordance with his natural aptitude, the  utmost pains being taken to enable him to find out what his natural  aptitude really is. The principle on which our industrial army is  organized is that a man's natural endowments, mental and physical,  determine what he can work at most profitably to the nation and most  satisfactorily to himself. While the obligation of service in some form  is not to be evaded, voluntary election, subject only to necessary  regulation, is depended on to determine the particular sort of service  every man is to render. As an individual's satisfaction during his term  of service depends on his having an occupation to his taste, parents  and teachers watch from early years for indications of special  aptitudes in children. A thorough study of the National industrial  system, with the history and rudiments of all the great trades, is an  essential part of our educational system. While manual training is not  allowed to encroach on the general intellectual culture to which our  schools are devoted, it is carried far enough to give our youth, in  addition to their theoretical knowledge of the national industries,  mechanical and agricultural, a certain familiarity with their tools and  methods. Our schools are constantly visiting our workshops, and often  are taken on long excursions to inspect particular industrial  enterprises. In your day a man was not ashamed to be grossly ignorant  of all trades except his own, but such ignorance would not be  consistent with our idea of placing every one in a position to select  intelligently the occupation for which he has most taste. Usually long  before he is mustered into service a young man has found out the  pursuit he wants to follow, has acquired a great deal of knowledge  about it, and is waiting impatiently the time when he can enlist in its  ranks.\"    \"Surely,\" I said, \"it can hardly be that the number of volunteers for  any trade is exactly the number needed in that trade. It must be  generally either under or over the demand.\"    \"The supply of volunteers is always expected to fully equal the  demand,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"It is the business of the administration  to see that this is the case. The rate of volunteering for each trade  is closely watched. If there be a noticeably greater excess of  volunteers over men needed in any trade, it is inferred that the trade  offers greater attractions than others. On the other hand, if the  number of volunteers for a trade tends to drop below the demand, it is  inferred that it is thought more arduous. It is the business of the  administration to seek constantly to equalize the attractions of the  trades, so far as the conditions of labor in them are concerned, so  that all trades shall be equally attractive to persons having natural  tastes for them. This is done by making the hours of labor in different  trades to differ according to their arduousness. The lighter trades,  prosecuted under the most agreeable circumstances, have in this way the  longest hours, while an arduous trade, such as mining, has very short  hours. There is no theory, no a priori rule, by which the respective  attractiveness of industries is determined. The administration, in  taking burdens off one class of workers and adding them to other  classes, simply follows the fluctuations of opinion among the workers  themselves as indicated by the rate of volunteering. The principle is  that no man's work ought to be, on the whole, harder for him than any  other man's for him, the workers themselves to be the judges. There are  no limits to the application of this rule. If any particular occupation  is in itself so arduous or so oppressive that, in order to induce  volunteers, the day's work in it had to be reduced to ten minutes, it  would be done. If, even then, no man was willing to do it, it would  remain undone. But of course, in point of fact, a moderate reduction in  the hours of labor, or addition of other privileges, suffices to secure  all needed volunteers for any occupation necessary to men. If, indeed,  the unavoidable difficulties and dangers of such a necessary pursuit  were so great that no inducement of compensating advantages would  overcome men's repugnance to it, the administration would only need to  take it out of the common order of occupations by declaring it 'extra  hazardous,' and those who pursued it especially worthy of the national  gratitude, to be overrun with volunteers. Our young men are very greedy  of honor, and do not let slip such opportunities. Of course you will  see that dependence on the purely voluntary choice of avocations  involves the abolition in all of anything like unhygienic conditions or  special peril to life and limb. Health and safety are conditions common  to all industries. The nation does not maim and slaughter its workmen  by thousands, as did the private capitalists and corporations of your  day.\"    \"When there are more who want to enter a particular trade than there is  room for, how do you decide between the applicants?\" I inquired.    \"Preference is given to those who have acquired the most knowledge of  the trade they wish to follow. No man, however, who through successive  years remains persistent in his desire to show what he can do at any  particular trade, is in the end denied an opportunity. Meanwhile, if a  man cannot at first win entrance into the business he prefers, he has  usually one or more alternative preferences, pursuits for which he has  some degree of aptitude, although not the highest. Every one, indeed,  is expected to study his aptitudes so as to have not only a first  choice as to occupation, but a second or third, so that if, either at  the outset of his career or subsequently, owing to the progress of  invention or changes in demand, he is unable to follow his first  vocation, he can still find reasonably congenial employment. This  principle of secondary choices as to occupation is quite important in  our system. I should add, in reference to the counter-possibility of  some sudden failure of volunteers in a particular trade, or some sudden  necessity of an increased force, that the administration, while  depending on the voluntary system for filling up the trades as a rule,  holds always in reserve the power to call for special volunteers, or  draft any force needed from any quarter. Generally, however, all needs  of this sort can be met by details from the class of unskilled or  common laborers.\"    \"How is this class of common laborers recruited?\" I asked. \"Surely  nobody voluntarily enters that.\"    \"It is the grade to which all new recruits belong for the first three  years of their service. It is not till after this period, during which  he is assignable to any work at the discretion of his superiors, that  the young man is allowed to elect a special avocation. These three  years of stringent discipline none are exempt from, and very glad our  young men are to pass from this severe school into the comparative  liberty of the trades. If a man were so stupid as to have no choice as  to occupation, he would simply remain a common laborer; but such cases,  as you may suppose, are not common.\"    \"Having once elected and entered on a trade or occupation,\" I remarked,  \"I suppose he has to stick to it the rest of his life.\"    \"Not necessarily,\" replied Dr. Leete; \"while frequent and merely  capricious changes of occupation are not encouraged or even permitted,  every worker is allowed, of course, under certain regulations and in  accordance with the exigencies of the service, to volunteer for another  industry which he thinks would suit him better than his first choice.  In this case his application is received just as if he were  volunteering for the first time, and on the same terms. Not only this,  but a worker may likewise, under suitable regulations and not too  frequently, obtain a transfer to an establishment of the same industry  in another part of the country which for any reason he may prefer.  Under your system a discontented man could indeed leave his work at  will, but he left his means of support at the same time, and took his  chances as to future livelihood. We find that the number of men who  wish to abandon an accustomed occupation for a new one, and old friends  and associations for strange ones, is small. It is only the poorer sort  of workmen who desire to change even as frequently as our regulations  permit. Of course transfers or discharges, when health demands them,  are"]]]
