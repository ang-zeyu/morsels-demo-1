[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4671"],[0,"The Story of the Pony Express (#9)"],[1," seemed the best means of defending California and  adjacent territory from Confederate attack. To the Unionists of  California, the report that their troops and Sumner were to leave the  state spelt extreme discouragement. They had felt some degree of hope  and security so long as organized forces were in their midst, and the  presence of Sumner everywhere inspired confidence among discouraged  patriots. To be deprived of their soldiers was bad enough; to lose  Sumner was intolerable. Accordingly, a formal petition protesting  against this action, was drawn up, addressed to the War Department, and  signed by important firms and prominent business men of San  Francisco[20].    In this petition they said among other things, that the War Department  probably was not aware of the real state of affairs in California, and  they openly requested that the order, be rescinded. They declared that a  majority of the California State officers were out-and-out secessionists  and that the others were at least hostile to the administration and  would accept a peace policy at any sacrifice. They were suspicious of  the Governor's loyalty and declared that, \"Every appointment made by our  Governor within the last three months, unmistakably indicates his entire  sympathy and cooperation with those plotting to sever California from  her allegiance to the Union, and that, too, at the hazard of Civil  War.\"[21]    Continuing at detailed length, the petitioners spoke of the great effort  being put forth by the secession element to win the forthcoming  election. Whereas their opponents were united, the Union party was  divided into a Douglas and a Republican faction. Should the  anti-Unionists triumph, they declared there were reasons to expect not  merely the loss of California to the Union ranks but internecine strife  and fratricidal murders such as were then ravaging the Missouri and  Kansas border.    The petition then pointed out the truly great importance of California  to the Union, and asserted that no precaution leading to the  preservation of her loyalty should be overlooked. It was a thousand  times easier to retain a state in allegiance than to overcome disloyalty  disguised as state authority. The best way to check treasonable  activities was to convince traitors of their helplessness. The  petitioners further declared that to deprive California of needed United  States military support just then, would be a direct encouragement to  traitors. An ounce of precaution was worth a pound of cure.    The loyalists triumphed in the state election on September 4, 1861, and  on that date the California crisis was safely passed. The contest, to be  sure, had revealed about twenty thousand anti-Union voters in the state,  but the success of the Union faction restored their feeling of  self-confidence. The pendulum had at last swung safely in the right  direction, and henceforth California could be and was reckoned as a  loyal asset to the Union. Such expressions of disloyalty as her  secessionists continued to disclose, were of a sporadic and flimsy  nature, never materializing into a formidable sentiment; and, adding to  their discouragement, the failure of the Confederate invasion of New  Mexico in 1862, was no doubt an important factor in suppressing any  further open desires for secession.    Sumner was not called East until the October following the election. His  removal of course caused keen regret along the coast; but Colonel George  Wright, his successor in charge of the Department of the Pacific, proved  a masterful man and in every way equal to the situation. In the long  run, Colonel Wright probably was as satisfactory to the loyal people of  California as General Sumner had been. The five thousand troops were not  detailed for duty in the South. Like the first detachment of fifteen  hundred, their efforts were directed mainly to protecting the overland  mails and guarding the frontier[22].    Throughout this crisis, news was received twice a week by the Pony  Express, and, be it remembered, in less than half the time required by  the old stage coach. Of its services then, no better words can be used  than those of Hubert Howe Bancroft.    It was the pony to which every one looked for deliverance; men prayed  for the safety of the little beast, and trembled lest the service should  be discontinued. Telegraphic dispatches from Washington and New York  were sent to St. Louis and thence to Fort Kearney, whence the pony  brought them to Sacramento where they were telegraphed to San Francisco.    Great was the relief of the people when Hole's bill for a daily mail  service was passed and the service changed from the Southern to the  Central route, as it was early in the summer. * * * Yet after all, it  was to the flying pony that all eyes and hearts were turned.    The Pony Express was a real factor in the preservation of California to  the Union.        [15] Bancroft.    [16] Ibid.    [17] After the War had started, Gwin deserted California and the Union  and joined the Confederacy. When this power was broken up, he fled to  Mexico and entered the service of Maximilian, then puppet emperor of  that unfortunate country. Maximilian bestowed an abundance of hollow  honors upon the renegade senator, and made him Duke of the Province of  Sonora, which region Gwin and his clique had doubtless coveted as an  integral part of their projected \"Republic of the Pacific.\" Because of  this empty title, the nickname, \"Duke,\" was ever afterward given him.  When Maximilian's soap bubble monarchy had disappeared, Gwin finally  returned to California where he passed his old age in retirement.    [18] Senate documents.

[22] During the War of the Rebellion, California raised 16,231 troops,  more than the whole United States army had been at the commencement of  hostilities. Practically all these soldiers were assigned to routine and  patrol duty in the far West, such as keeping down Indian revolts, and  garrisoning forts, as a defense against any uprising of Indians, or  protection against Confederate invasion. The exceptions were the  California Hundred, and the California Four Hundred, volunteer  detachments who went East of their own accord and won undying honors in  the thick of the struggle.          Chapter VI    Riders and Famous Rides      Bart Riles, the pony rider, died this morning from wounds received at  Cold Springs, May 16.    The men at Dry Creek Station have all been killed and it is thought  those at Robert's Creek have met with the same fate.    Six Pike's Peakers found the body of the station keeper horribly  mutilated, the station burned, and all the stock missing from Simpson's.    Eight horses were stolen from Smith's Creek on last Monday, supposedly  by road agents.    The above are random extracts from frontier newspapers, printed while  the Pony Express was running. The Express could never have existed on  its high plane of efficiency, without an abundance of coolheaded,  hardened men; men who knew not fear and who were expert--though  sometimes in vain--in all the wonderful arts of self-preservation  practiced on the old frontier. That these employees could have performed  even the simplest of their duties, without stirring and almost  incredible adventures, it is needless to assert.    The faithful relation of even a considerable number of the thrilling  experiences to which the \"Pony\" men were subjected would discount  fiction. Yet few of these adventures have been recorded. Today, after a  lapse of over fifty years, nearly all of the heroes who achieved them  have gone out on that last long journey from which no man returns. While  history can pay the tribute of preserving some anecdotes of them and  their collective achievements, it must be forever silent as to many of  their personal acts of heroism.    While lasting praise is due the faithful station men who, in their  isolation, so often bore the murderous attacks of Indians and bandits,  it is, perhaps, to the riders that the seeker of romance is most likely  to turn. It was the riders' skill and fortitude that made the operation  of the line possible. Both riders and hostlers shared the same  privations, often being reduced to the necessity of eating wolf meat"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4675"],[0,"The Sea-Witch; Or, The African Quadroon: A Story of the Slave Coast (#9)"],[1,"cars of those in the boat.    \"I know not what sort of craft she is,\" said the mate; \"and this is a  latitude where pirates intercept the homeward bound ships sometimes,  though according to ny reckoning, we are too well in for the land to be  in that track.\"    \"I trust there is no danger in accepting the assistance that the ship  appears willing to give?\" said the mother anxiously, to the mate.    \"It is not more dangerous than to pass another night in this open boat,  madam, at all events,\" replied the mate, frankly.    \"Stand by, to take this tow-line,\" shouted a voice from the bulwarks of  the ship, as the vessel drifted with a side impetus towards the tiny  craft, while the figure of a man was observed in the mizzen shrouds with  a coil of line ready to heave, at the word of command.    \"Ay, ay,\" answered the mate, steering his boat so as to bring her side  on to the ship, and opening his arms to catch the line, which he saw was  about to be thrown.    \"Heave, heave clear of all,\" shouted a stern, manly voice from the  quarter-deck of the ship at this moment; \"heave with a will.\"    And a stout tow-line rattled through the air with a whizzing sound and  lay between the mate's extended arms. This was instantly seized upon,  and while one of the men took a turn about the stanchion in the bow of  the boat, those on board the ship gathered in the line until the boat  was safely moored under her quarter. No words were exchanged, until the  ladies, first, and the seamen next, were taken on board: the fact of  their being wrecked and in distress being too apparent to require  questioning. The valuables in the boat were quickly transferred to the  ship, and the little craft which had proved an ark of safety to the  adventurers, was then cut adrift, and soon lay a mere speck upon the  waters, unguided and alone.    As the boat drifted for a moment astern of the vessel before the party  were taken on board, the mate rend her name on the stern in golden  letters, \"The Sea Witch.\" The foremast hands who had been saved from  the wreck soon mingled with the crew on the forecastle of the \"Sea  Witch,\" and told their story there, while the mate and the ladies were  received in the most hospitable manner in the cabin, where the captain  endeavored to offer them every comfort the ship afforded, and to place  every resource entirely at their command.    Mrs. Huntington and her daughter were at first too tearful and full of  gratitude for their preservation to converse, and soon took advantage of  the kind offer which placed the captain's private apartments entirely at  their service, while the mate explained their adventures in detail, not  forgetting the phantom ship which passed them in the gale, and which had  caused such consternation on board the wrecked Indiaman. But his story  in this particular was unfortunately spoiled, when Captain Ratlin told  him positively that he was at that moment on board the very craft which  he had designated as the Flying Dutchman. A remark that for a moment  puzzled the honest seaman and led him to look suspiciously about him;  but a few corroborating remarks soon placed the subject at rest in even  the mate's credulous mind.    The fact was, that the same gale which had made a wreck of the Indiaman,  had driven the \"Sea Witch\" two days' sail or more out of her course, and  had thus brought her in sight of the Bengal at that critical moment when  it would have been impossible to have rendered her the least assistance.  The continuance of the gale had carried the ship far to the southward,  from whence she was now returning.    It was early morning upon the day succeeding that auspicious night for  the party in the boat, that Miss Huntington and her mother made their  appearance upon the quarter-deck, and tendered their thanks for the  service rendered. Captain Ratlin received them there with a frank, manly  air, assured them of full protection, and that he would land them at  some port from whence they could take ship for England. A very few hours  placed him on the best of terms with his passengers, for there was that  frank, and open discourse of manner with him, which his countenance  promised, while he felt irresistibly drawn towards the gentle and  beautiful girl whose protector he had thus strangely and suddenly  become. Not one point of her sweet beauty was lost upon the young  commander, and her every word and movement he seemed to dwell upon, and  to consider with a tenacious degree of interest.    On her part, Miss Huntington looked upon him as her preserver, and did  not hesitate to accord him that confidence which the circumstances of  her situation would so naturally lead to, being delighted and  entertained by the sketches he gave her of sea life and wild adventure  upon the ocean, elicited by her suggestion. The mother, too, was  well-pleased with the profound respect and polite attention which  herself and daughter received from him, and accorded him that cordial  countenance in his intercourse with her child which placed him quite at  ease.    \"We have not even asked you, Captain Ratlin, what trade you are in,\"  said the mother, as they sat together, her daughter and the young  commander, upon the quarter-deck beneath an awning which had been rigged  for their comfort.    \"Ahem! madam!\" hesitated the young officer, \"we are, that is, yes, we  are on a trading voyage to the coast--just at the present time.\"    Whether the mother saw that the subject was not one which was of an  agreeable nature to him, or otherwise, she at once changed the subject,  and congenial themes were discussed, to the delight of the daughter, who  dwelt with evident pleasure upon the manly tones of the captain's voice,  which seemed to have some secret charm upon her. Even her mother noticed  this, and seemed to regard her with sensitive watchfulness while the  captain was near, though there was no well defined suspicion or fear in  her mind.    \"Is it customary for traders upon these seas to go so thoroughly armed,  Captain Ratlin?\" asked the daughter, one day, after she had been shown  about the decks, at her own request, where she had marked the heavy  calibre of the gun amidship, its well as the neat and serviceable array  of small arms within the entrance to the cabin.    \"It is a treacherous latitude, lady, and the strong arm often makes the  right,\" he answered again, evasively, as he called her attention to some  distant object in the horizon, while at the same moment there was  shouted from aloft:    \"Land O!\"    \"Land, land!\" repeated the gentle being by his side, \"what land?\"    \"Africa,\" quietly responded the captain, without a token of  satisfaction.    \"Africa? that is indeed an inhospitable shore; can we land there?\"    \"Yes, I shall make sure that you land safely, and can despatch you to  Sierra Leone, from whence you can take ship for England, but--\"    \"Sail O!\" shouted the lookout.    \"Whereaway?\" asked the captain promptly, seizing a deck trumpet and  abruptly turning from her to whom he had been speaking, while his whole  manner changed at once.    \"A couple of points on the larboard beam, sir,\" answered the seaman.    \"All hands, Mr. Faulkner, and 'bout ship; that square rig and the heavy  lift of those topsails tell what there must be below to sustain them.  Lively, sir, the 'Sea Witch' must show her qualities.\"    Miss Huntington had watched with some amazement these orders, and the  result of the same, and as she saw the beautiful craft in which she was  put at once on the opposite tack and steer boldly away from the shore  which had just been made, she could not help for a moment remembering  the words of the mate in the boat, that pirates sometimes were found in  these latitudes!    After a moment's thought she felt that she did Captain Ratlin injustice,  for whatever might cause him to flee from the sight of what she presumed  by his remarks to be a man-of-war, yet she felt that he could not be a  pirate. True, the vessel even to her inexperienced eye was very strongly  manned, and there was a severity of discipline observed on board that  was very different from what she had seen while they were in the  Indiaman, but that man could not be a pirate, she felt that he could  not--she would not do him the injustice to think it possible.    Let the stranger be whom he might, the \"Sea Witch\" seemed to have no  intention of making his acquaintance, and as easily dropped the topsails  of the vessel again as she had made them, while from the manner in which  the stranger steered, it was doubtful whether his lookout had made out  the \"Sea Witch\" at all--and so Captain Ratlin remarked to his first  officer, while he ordered the ship to be kept on her present course for  an hour, then to haul up on the wind and run in shore again.    \"Is it usual, Captain Ratlin,\" asked the young and beautiful girl, \"for  vessels on the coast to so dread meeting each other as to deliberately  alter their course when this seems likely to be the case?\"    \"Trade is peculiar on this coast, and men-of-warsmen take extraordinary  liberties on board such vessels as they happen to overhaul,\" was the  reply. \"I always avoid their company when I can do so conveniently.\"    As Captain Ratlin said this, his eyes met those of his companion for a  moment, which were bent anxiously upon his face, as though she would  read his inmost thoughts. He noted the expression, and replied at once:    \"Whatever suspicion or fear may have entered Miss Huntington's mind, I  beg of her to dispel, as it regards her own and her mother's safety and  comfort. Both shall be my sole care until you are safely landed upon  shore, where I shall at the earliest moment place you in a situation to  reach your homes in England.\"    \"I know you will do this,\" she replied, \"and if my looks betrayed any  anxiety, it was not for our safety, but for your own, Captain Ratlin.\"    \"My safety, lady? do you then consider that worth your"]]]
