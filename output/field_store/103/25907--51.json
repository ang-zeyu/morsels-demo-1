It thus appears that the 'knowing agent,' who is denoted by the 'I,' in  the judgment 'I know,' constitutes no real attribute of the Self, the  nature of which is pure intelligence. This is also the reason why the  consciousness of Egoity does not persist in the states of deep sleep and  final release: in those states this special form of consciousness passes  away, and the Self appears in its true nature, i.e. as pure  consciousness. Hence a person who has risen from deep, dreamless sleep  reflects, 'Just now I was unconscious of myself.'    Summing up of the pûrvapaksha view.    As the outcome of all this, we sum up our view as follows.--Eternal,  absolutely non-changing consciousness, whose nature is pure  non-differenced intelligence, free from all distinction whatever, owing  to error illusorily manifests itself (vivarttate) as broken up into  manifold distinctions--knowing subjects, objects of knowledge, acts of  knowledge. And the purpose for which we enter on the consideration of  the Vedânta-texts is utterly to destroy what is the root of that error,  i.e. Nescience, and thus to obtain a firm knowledge of the oneness of  Brahman, whose nature is mere intelligence--free, pure, eternal.

The distinction is illustrated by the different views  Perception and Inference cause us to take of the nature of the flame of  the lamp. To Perception the flame, as long as it burns, seems one and  the same: but on the ground of the observation that the different  particles of the wick and the oil are consumed in succession, we infer  that there are many distinct flames succeeding one another. And we  accept the Inference as valid, and as sublating or refuting the  immediate perception, because the perceived oneness of the flame admits  of being accounted for 'otherwise,' viz. on the ground of the many  distinct flames originating in such rapid succession that the eye  mistakes them for one. The inference on the other hand does not admit of  being explained in another way.]    [FOOTNOTE 26:1. The reference is to the point discussed Pû. Mî. Sû. VI,  5, 54 (Jaim. Nyâ. Mâlâ Vistara, p. 285).]    [FOOTNOTE 27:1. The texts which deny all qualities of Brahman are later  in order than the texts which refer to Brahman as qualified, because  denial presupposes that which is to be denied.]    [FOOTNOTE 27:2. The unity of purport of the sentence is inferred from  its constituent words having the same case-ending.]    [FOOTNOTE 30:1. The theory here referred to is held by some of the  Mîmâmsakas. The imperative forms of the verb have their primary meaning,  i.e. the power of originating action, only in Vedic sentences which  enjoin the performance of certain actions for the bringing about of  certain ends: no other means of knowledge but the Veda informing us that  such ends can be accomplished by such actions. Nobody, e.g. would offer  a soma sacrifice in order to obtain the heavenly world, were he not told  by the Veda to do so. In ordinary life, on the other hand, no imperative  possesses this entirely unique originative force, since any action which  may be performed in consequence of a command may be prompted by other  motives as well: it is, in technical Indian language, established  already, apart from the command, by other means of knowledge. The man  who, e.g. is told to milk a cow might have proceeded to do so, apart  from the command, for reasons of his own. Imperatives in ordinary speech  are therefore held not to have their primary meaning, and this  conclusion is extended, somewhat unwarrantably one should say, to all  the words entering into an imperative clause.]    [FOOTNOTE 34:1. Being not permanent but occasional, it is an effect only,  and as such must have a cause.]          THE GREAT SIDDHÂNTA.    This entire theory rests on a fictitious foundation of altogether hollow  and vicious arguments, incapable of being stated in definite logical  alternatives, and devised by men who are destitute of those particular  qualities which cause individuals to be chosen by the Supreme Person  revealed in the Upanishads; whose intellects are darkened by the  impression of beginningless evil; and who thus have no insight into the  nature of words and sentences, into the real purport conveyed by them,  and into the procedure of sound argumentation, with all its methods  depending on perception and the other instruments of right knowledge.  The theory therefore must needs be rejected by all those who, through  texts, perception and the other means of knowledge--assisted by sound  reasoning--have an insight into the true nature of things.          There is no proof of non-differenced substance.    To enter into details.--Those who maintain the doctrine of a substance  devoid of all difference have no right to assert that this or that is a  proof of such a substance; for all means of right knowledge have for  their object things affected with difference.--Should any one taking his  stand on the received views of his sect, assert that the theory of a  substance free from all difference (does not require any further means  of proof but) is immediately established by one's own consciousness; we  reply that he also is refuted by the fact, warranted by the witness of  the Self, that all consciousness implies difference: all states of  consciousness have for their object something that is marked by some  difference, as appears in the case of judgments like 'I saw this.' And  should a state of consciousness--although directly apprehended as  implying difference--be determined by some fallacious reasoning to be  devoid of difference, this determination could be effected only by means  of some special attributes additional to the quality of mere Being; and  owing to these special qualities on which the determination depends,  that state of consciousness would clearly again be characterised by  difference. The meaning of the mentioned determination could thus only  be that of a thing affected with certain differences some other  differences are denied; but manifestly this would not prove the  existence of a thing free from all difference. To thought there at any  rate belongs the quality of being thought and self-illuminatedness, for  the knowing principle is observed to have for its essential nature the  illumining (making to shine forth) of objects. And that also in the  states of deep sleep, swoon, &c., consciousness is affected with  difference we shall prove, in its proper place, in greater detail.  Moreover you yourself admit that to consciousness there actually belong  different attributes such as permanency (oneness, self-luminousness, &c.  ), and of these it cannot be shown that they are only Being in general.  And even if the latter point were admitted, we observe that there takes  place a discussion of different views, and you yourself attempt to prove  your theory by means of the differences between those views and your own.  It therefore must be admitted that reality is affected with difference  well established by valid means of proof.          Sabda proves difference.    As to sound (speech; sabda) it is specially apparent that it possesses  the power of denoting only such things as are affected with difference.  Speech operates with words and sentences. Now a word (pada) originates  from the combination of a radical element and a suffix, and as these two  elements have different meanings it necessarily follows that the word  itself can convey only a sense affected with difference. And further,  the plurality of words is based on plurality of meanings; the sentence  therefore which is an aggregate of words expresses some special  combination of things (meanings of words), and hence has no power to  denote a thing devoid of all difference.--The conclusion is that sound  cannot be a means of knowledge for a thing devoid of all difference.          Pratyaksha--even of the nirvikalpaka kind--proves difference.    Perception in the next place--with its two subdivisions of  non-determinate (nirvikalpaka) and determinate (savikalpaka)  perception--also cannot be a means of knowledge for things devoid of  difference. Determinate perception clearly has for its object things  affected with difference; for it relates to that which is distinguished  by generic difference and so on. But also non-determinate perception has  for its object only what is marked with difference; for it is on the  basis of non-determinate perception that the object distinguished by  generic character and so on is recognised in the act of determinate  perception. Non-determinate perception is the apprehension of the object  in so far as destitute of some differences but not of all difference.  Apprehension of the latter kind is in the first place not observed ever  to take place, and is in the second place impossible: for all  apprehension by consciousness takes place by means of some distinction  'This is such and such.' Nothing can be apprehended apart from some  special feature of make or structure, as e.g. the triangularly shaped  dewlap in the case of cows. The true distinction between non-determinate  and determinate perception is that the former is the apprehension of the  first individual among a number of things belonging to the same class,  while the latter is the apprehension of the second, third, and so on,  individuals. On the apprehension of the first individual cow the  perceiving person is not conscious of the fact that the special shape  which constitutes the generic character of the class 'cows' extends to  the present individual also; while this special consciousness arises in  the case of the perception of the second and third cow.

[Illustration: AN EGG FLEW ACROSS THE MEADOW, AND BURST OVER LEUTHOLD'S  SHOULDER]          PLATE IV.           Said William Tell, \"And has this cuss         For conquest such a passion       He needs must set his cap at us         In this exalted fashion?\"       And then the people gave a cry,         'Twixt joy and apprehension,       To see him pass the symbol by         With studied inattention!    [Illustration: \"HERE! HI!\" SHOUTED THE SOLDIERS, \"STOP!\"]          PLATE V.           At first the sentinel, aghast,         Glared like an angry dumb thing;       Then \"Hi!\" he shouted, \"not so fast,         You're overlooking something!\"       The sturdy Tell made no response;         Then through the hills resounded       A mighty thwack upon his sconce--         The people were astounded.    [Illustration: THEY SAW FRIESSHARDT RAISE HIS PIKE, AND BRING IT DOWN  WITH ALL HIS FORCE ON TELL'S HEAD]          PLATE VI.           Could Tell an insult such as this         Ignore or pass? I doubt it!       No, no; that patriotic Swiss         Was very cross about it.       The people, interested now,         Exclaimed, \"Here! Stop a minute       If there's to be a jolly row,         By Jingo! we'll be in it!\"    [Illustration: \"LOOK HERE!\" HE BEGAN. \"LOOK THERE!\" SAID FRIESSHARDT]          PLATE VII.           Said Tell, \"This satrap of the Duke         Is sore in need of gumption;       With my good bow I will rebuke         Such arrow-gant presumption.\"       \"Stand back!\" the soldier says, says he;         \"This roughness is unseemly!\"       The people cried, \"We _will_ be FREE!\"         And so they were--extremely!    [Illustration: FRIESSHARDT RUSHED TO STOP HIM]          PLATE VIII.           They dealt that soldier thump on thump         (He hadn't any notion,       When on Tell's head he raised that bump,         Of raising this commotion);       Tell's arrow sped, the people crowed,         And loudly cheered his action;       While Tell's expressive features showed         A certain satisfaction.    [Illustration: THE CROWD DANCED AND SHOUTED]          PLATE IX.           Now, when the cat's away, the mice         Are very enterprising,       But cats return, and, in a trice--         Well, Gessler nipped that rising.       And when those soldiers lodged complaint         (Which truly didn't lack ground),       The people practised self-restraint         And fell into the background.    [Illustration: \"COME, COME, COME!\" SAID GESSLER, \"TELL ME ALL ABOUT  IT\"]          PLATE X.           And Tell, before the tyrant hailed,         No patriot you'd have guessed him,       For even his stout bosom quailed         When Gessler thus addressed him:--       \"As you're the crack shot of these Swiss         (I've often heard it said so),       Suppose you take a shot at this,         Placed on your youngster's head--so!\"    [Illustration: \"I HAVE HERE AN APPLE\"]          PLATE XI.           \"The bearing,\" as they say, \"of that         Lay in the apple-cation,\"       And nobody will wonder at         A parent's agitation;       That anguish filled Tell's bosom proud         Needs scarcely to be stated,       And, it will be observed, the crowd         Was also agitated.    [Illustration: THERE WAS A STIR OF EXCITEMENT IN THE CROWD]          PLATE XII.           Said Gessler, \"This is all my eye!         Come, hurry up and _buck_ up!       Remember, if you miss, you die--         That ought to keep your pluck up.       The flying arrow may, no doubt,         Your offspring's bosom enter--\"       But here there rose a mighty shout:         \"By George! He's scored a centre!\"    [Illustration: A MOMENT'S SUSPENSE, AND THEN A TERRIFIC CHEER AROSE  FROM THE SPECTATORS]          PLATE XIII.           But, as the arrow cleft the core,         Cried G. with indignation,       \"What was the second arrow for?         Come, no e-quiver-cation!       You had a second in your fist.\"         Said Tell, the missile grippin',       \"This shaft (had I that apple missed)         Was meant for you, my pippin!\"    [Illustration: \"SEIZE THAT MAN!\" HE SHOUTED]          PLATE XIV.           With rage the tyrant said, said he,         \"It's time to stop this prating;       I find your style of repartee         Extremely irritating.       You'll hang for this, be pleased to note.\"         On this they bound and gagged him       (For Gessler's castle booked by boat),         And through the village dragged him.

But slips between the cup and lip,         When least expected, peer through--       A storm arose upon the trip         Which Tell alone could steer through.       Thus, of all hands he quickly got         (As you may see) the upper,       At Gessler took a parting shot,         And hurried home to supper.
