The Wanderer      enters and walks resolutely towards a cavernous      opening in a rock in the foreground, and takes up      his position there, leaning on his spear, while he      calls the following towards the entrance to the      cave._      WANDERER        Waken, Wala!      Wala! Awake!      From thy long sleep,  Slumberer, wake at my call!      I summon thee forth:      Arise! Arise!      From cloud-covered caves  In earth's dim abysses, arise!      Erda! Erda,      Old as the world!      From depths dark and hidden      Rise to the day!      With song I call thee,      I sing to wake thee,      From deep dreams of wisdom      Bid thee arise.      All-knowing one!      Fount of knowledge!      Erda! Erda,      Old as the world!  Waken! Awaken, thou Vala! Awaken!            [_A dim bluish light begins to dawn in the cavern.          In this light Erda, during the following, rises          very gradually from below. She appears to be          covered with hoar-frost, which glitters on her hair          and garments._    ERBA    Loud is the call;  Strong the spell that summons;      I have been roused      From dark and wise dreams:  Who wakes me from my sleep?    WANDERER        'Tis I who awake thee      With song of magic,      That what in slumber  Was folded fast may rise.      The wide earth ranging,      Far I have roamed,      Seeking for knowledge,  Wisdom at fountains primeval.      No one that lives      Is wiser than thou;      Thou knowest all      In the hidden depths,      What moves on hill,  Dale, in water and air.      Where life is found,      There thou art breathing;      And where brains ponder,      There is thy thought.      Men say that all      Knowledge is thine.  That I might ask of thee counsel,  I have called thee from sleep.    ERBA        My sleep is dreaming,      My dreaming brooding,  My brooding wisdom's calm working.      But while I sleep      The Norns are wakeful:      They twine the rope,  And deftly weave what I know.  The Norns thou shouldst have questioned.    WANDERER        In thrall to the world      Sit the Norns weaving;      They cannot alter      What ordained is.      But I would fain      Be taught of thy wisdom  How a wheel on the roll can be stayed.    ERBA        Dark and troubled  My mind grows through men's deeds.      A God once subdued  The Wala's self to his will.      A wish-maiden      I bore to Wotan;      From fields of battle  She brought him slain heroes;      Bold is she      And wise to boot:      Why waken me?      Why seek not counsel  From Erda's and Wotan's child?    WANDERER        The Valkyrie, Brünnhild'?      Meanest thou her?  She flouted the storm-controller,  When, sorely urged, himself he controlled.      What the swayer and lord      Of battles longed for,      What he refrained from      Against his desire,      Brünnhilde, bold,      Rash, over-confident,  When the fight was at fiercest,  Strove for herself to perform.      War-father      Punished the maid:  He pressed slumber into her eyes,  On the flame-girt rock she sleeps.      The hallowed maid      Will waken alone,  That she may love and wed with a man.  Small hope of answer from her.    ERBA        Dazed have I felt      Since I woke;      Wild, confused      Seems the world!      The Valkyrie,      The Wala's child,  Bound lay, fettered by sleep,  While her all-knowing mother slept!      Does revolt's teacher      Chide revolt?      Does the deed he urged to      Anger him, done?      He who guards the right,      To whom vows are sacred,      Hinders the right?--      Reigns through falsehood?  Let me down to the dark,  That my wisdom may slumber!    WANDERER    I will not let thee descend,  For a potent magic I wield.      All-wise one,      Planted by thee      The sting of care was  In Wotan's dauntless heart;      For, through thy wisdom,      Downfall and shameful      Doom were foretold him;  My mind was fettered by fear.      Now let the world's      Wisest of women      Answer and say  How a God may conquer his care.    ERBA    Thou art not  What thou hast said.  Why art thou come, wild and wayward,  To trouble the Wala's sleep?    WANDERER        Thou art not      What thou hast dreamed.      Thy end draws near,      Mother of wisdom;      Thy wisdom at war      With me shall perish.  Knowest thou Wotan's will?            [_A long silence._        I tell thee      That thou mayest sleep  For evermore unvexed by care.      That the Gods are doomed,      No longer dismays me,  Since I will it so.  What, with myself at war, in anguish,  Despairing, once I resolved,      Gaily, gladly,  With delight I now do.  Mad with disgust I decreed once  The world to the Nibelung's hate,      But now to the valiant Wälsung  I leave it with joy.      One who never knew me,      Though chosen by me,      A boy bold and fearless,      Helped not by Wotan,  Has won the Nibelung's ring.      Blest in love,      Void of all envy,      On him shall fall harmless      Alberich's curse,  For no fear does he know.      Soon thy child and mine,      Brünnhild',  Shall be waked by him;      And when waked      Our child shall achieve  A deed to redeem the world.      So slumber again,      Closing thine eyelids;  Dreaming behold my downfall!      Whatever comes after,      The God rejoicing  Yields to youth ever young.      Descend, then, Erda,      Mother of fear!      World-sorrow!      Descend! Descend!      And sleep for aye!            [_Erda, whose eyes are already closed, and who has          gradually been sinking deeper, disappears entirely.          The cavern has become quite dark again._        _Dawn lights up the stage; the storm has ceased.      The Wanderer has gone close to the cave, and leans      with his back against it, facing the wings._    WANDERER    Lo! Yonder Siegfried comes.            [_He remains where he is without changing his          position. Siegfried's wood-bird flutters towards          the foreground. Suddenly the bird stops in his          direct flight, flutters to and fro in alarm, and          disappears quickly towards the back._    SIEGFRIED [_Enters and stops._    My bird has vanished from sight!      With fluttering wings      And lovely song  Blithely he showed me the way,  And then forsook me and fled!      I must discover      The rock for myself:  The path I followed so far  'Twere best still to pursue.            [_He goes towards the back._    WANDERER [_Still in the same position._        Boy, pray tell me,      Whither away?    SIEGFRIED [_Halts and turns round._        Did some one speak?  Perhaps he knows the road.            [_He goes nearer to the Wanderer._        I would find a rock  That by flaming fire is surrounded:      There sleeps a maid      Whom I would awake.    WANDERER        Who bade thee seek      This rock flame-circled?--  Taught thee to yearn for the woman?    SIEGFRIED        It was a singing      Woodland bird;  He gave me welcome tidings.    WANDERER    A wood-bird chatters idly  What no man understands;      How then couldst thou tell      The song's true meaning?    SIEGFRIED        Because of the blood      Of a dragon grim  That fell before me at Neidhöhl'--      The burning blood      Had scarce touched my tongue  When the sense of the singer grew plain.    WANDERER        Who was it urged thee on      To try thy strength,  And slay this dragon so dread?    SIEGFRIED        My guide was Mime,      A faithless dwarf:  What fear is fain he had taught me.      But 'twas the dragon      Roused me himself,  Wrathful, to strike the blow;  For he threatened me with his jaws.    WANDERER        Who forged the sword      So hard and keen  That it slew the daunting foe?    SIEGFRIED        I forged it myself      When the smith was beaten;  Swordless else I should have been still.    WANDERER        But who made      The mighty splinters  From which the sword was welded strong?    SIEGFRIED        What know I of that?      I only know  That the splintered steel was useless  Were not the sword forged anew.    WANDERER            [_Bursts out laughing with gleeful good-humour._       I fully agree.    SIEGFRIED [_Surprised._        At what dost thou laugh?      Prying greybeard!      Prithee have done;  Keep me no longer here talking.      Speak if thou knowest      Whither my way lies;      And hold thy tongue  Unless thou canst tell.    WANDERER        Good boy, have patience!      If I seem old,  More need to show me due honour.    SIEGFRIED        What an odd notion!      My whole life long      A hateful old man      Has blocked my pathway;  Him I at last swept aside.      Standest thou longer      Trying here to stay me,      I warn thee frankly            [_With a significant gesture._    That thou like Mime shalt fare.            [_He goes still nearer to the Wanderer._        But what art thou like?      Why wearest thou      Such a monstrous hat,  And why hangs it so over thy face?    WANDERER [_Still without altering his position._    That is the way I wear it  When against the wind I go.    SIEGFRIED [_Inspecting him still more closely._    But an eye beneath it is wanting.      Perchance by some one      Whose way thou didst      Too boldly bar  It has been struck out.      Take thyself off,      Or else very soon  The other thou shalt lose also!    WANDERER        I see, my son,      Where thou art blind,  And hence thy jaunty assurance.      With the eye that is      Amissing in me  Thou lookest now on the other  That still is left me for sight.    SIEGFRIED            [_Who has been listening thoughtfully, now bursts          involuntarily into hearty laughter._    Thy foolish talk sets me laughing!  But come, this nonsense must finish.  At once show me my way;  Then proceed thou too on thine own;      For me further      Use thou hast none:  So speak, or off thou shalt pack!

He had a panel with about a million meters  and gauges on it; he scanned and measured every individual component  element of my brain. Then he made a pattern, on a milling router  just about as complicated as his panel. From there on, of course, it  was simple--just like a dentist making a set of china choppers or a  metallurgist embedding a test-section. He snapped a couple of sentences  of directions at me, and then said 'Scram!' That's all.\"    \"Sure that was all?\" Costigan asked. \"Didn't he add 'and _stay_  scrammed'?\"    \"He didn't _say_ it, exactly, but the implication was clear enough.\"    \"The one point of similarity,\" Jill commented. \"Now you, Jack. You have  been looking as though we were all candidates for canvas jackets that  lace tightly up the back.\"    \"Uh-uh. As though maybe _I_ am. I didn't see anything at all. Didn't  even land on the planet. Just floated around in an orbit inside that  screen. The thing I talked with was a pattern of pure force. This Lens  simply appeared on my wrist, bracelet and all, out of thin air. He told  me plenty, though, in a very short time--his last word being for me not  to come back or call back.\"    \"Hm ... m ... m.\" This of Jack's was a particularly indigestible bit,  even for Jill Samms.    \"In plain words,\" Costigan volunteered, \"we all saw exactly what we  expected to see.\"    \"Uh-uh,\" Jill denied. \"I certainly did not expect to see a  woman ... no; what each of us saw, I think, was what would do us the  most good--give each of us the highest possible lift. I am wondering  whether or not there was anything at all really there.\"    \"That might be it, at that.\" Jack scowled in concentration. \"But there  must have been _something_ there--these Lenses are real. But what makes  me mad is that they wouldn't give you a Lens. You're just as good a man  as any one of us--if I didn't know it wouldn't do a damn bit of good  I'd go back there right now and....\"    \"Don't pop off so, Jack!\" Jill's eyes, however, were starry. \"I know  you mean it, and I could almost love you, at times--but I don't need a  Lens. As a matter of fact, I'll be much better off without one.\"    \"Jet back, Jill!\" Jack Kinnison stared deeply into the girl's eyes--but  still did not use his Lens. \"Somebody must have done a terrific job of  selling, to make you believe that ... or _are_ you sold, actually?\"    \"Actually. Honestly. That Arisian was a thousand times more of a  woman than I ever will be, and she didn't wear a Lens--never had  worn one. Women's minds and Lenses don't fit. There's a sex-based  incompatibility. Lenses are as masculine as whiskers--and at that, only  a very few men can ever wear them, either. Very special men, like you  three and Dad and Pops Kinnison. Men with tremendous force, drive, and  scope. Pure killers, all of you; each in his own way, of course. No  more to be stopped than a glacier, and twice as hard and ten times as  cold. A woman simply _can't_ have that kind of a mind! There is going  to be a woman Lensman some day--just one--but not for years and years;  and I wouldn't be in her shoes for anything. In this job of mine,  of....\"    \"Well, go on. What is this job you're so sure you are going to do?\"    \"Why, I don't know!\" Jill exclaimed, startled eyes wide. \"I thought I  knew all about it, but I don't! Do you, about yours?\"    They did not, not one of them; and they were all as surprised at that  fact as the girl had been.    \"Well, to get back to this Lady Lensman who is going to appear some  day, I gather that she is going to be some kind of a freak. She'll have  to be, practically, because of the sex-based fundamental nature of the  Lens. Mentor didn't say so, in so many words, but she made it perfectly  clear that....\"    \"Mentor!\" the three men exclaimed.    Each of them had dealt with Mentor!    \"I am beginning to see,\" Jill said, thoughtfully. \"Mentor. Not a real  name at all. To quote the Unabridged verbatim--I had occasion to look  the word up the other day and I am appalled now at the certainty that  there was a connection--quote; Mentor, a wise and faithful counselor;  unquote. Have any of you boys anything to say? I haven't; and I am  beginning to be scared blue.\"    Silence fell; and the more they thought, those three young Lensmen  and the girl who was one of the two human women ever to encounter  knowingly an Arisian mind, the deeper that silence became.          CHAPTER 4      \"So you didn't find anything on Nevia.\" Roderick Kinnison got up,  deposited the inch-long butt of his cigar in an ashtray, lit another,  and prowled about the room; hands jammed deep into breeches pockets.  \"I'm surprised. Nerado struck me as being a B.T.O.... I thought sure  he'd qualify.\"    \"So did I.\" Samms' tone was glum. \"He's Big Time, and an Operator;  but not big enough, by far. I'm--we're both--finding out that Lensman  material is _damned_ scarce stuff. There's none on Nevia, and no  indication whatever that there ever will be any.\"    \"Tough ... and you're right, of course, in your stand that we'll have  to have Lensmen from as many different solar systems as possible on  the Galactic Council or the thing won't work at all. So damned much  jealousy--which is one reason why we're here in New York instead  of out at The Hill, where we belong--we've found that out already,  even in such a small and comparatively homogeneous group as our own  system--the Solarian Council will not only have to be made up mostly  of Lensmen, but each and every inhabited planet of Sol will have to  be represented--even Pluto, I suppose, in time. And by the way, your  Mr. Saunders wasn't any too pleased when you took Knobos of Mars and  DalNalten of Venus away from him and made Lensmen out of them--and put  them miles over his head.\"    \"Oh, I wouldn't say that ... exactly. I convinced him ... but at that,  since Saunders is not Lensman grade himself, it was a trifle difficult  for him to understand the situation completely.\"    \"You say it easy--'difficult' is not the word I would use. But back  to the Lensman hunt.\" Kinnison scowled blackly. \"I agree, as I said  before, that we need non-human Lensmen, the more the better, but I  don't think much of your chance of finding any. What makes you  think ... Oh, I see ... but I don't know whether you're justified or  not in assuming a high positive correlation between a certain kind of  mental ability and technological advancement.\"    \"No such assumption is necessary. Start anywhere you please, Rod, and  take it from there; including Nevia.\"    \"I'll start with known facts, then. Interstellar flight is new to  us. We haven't spread far, or surveyed much territory. But in the  eight solar systems with which we are most familiar there are seven  planets--I'm not counting Valeria--which are very much like Earth in  point of mass, size, climate, atmosphere, and gravity. Five of the  seven did not have any intelligent life and were colonized easily and  quickly. The Tellurian worlds of Procyon and Vega became friendly  neighbors--thank God we learned something on Nevia--because they were  already inhabited by highly advanced races: Procia by people as human  as we are, Vegia by people who would be so if it weren't for their  tails. Many other worlds of these systems are inhabited by more or less  intelligent non-human races. Just how intelligent they are we don't  know, but the Lensmen will soon find out.    \"My point is that no race we have found so far has had either atomic  energy or any form of space-drive. In any contact with races having  space-drives we have not been the discoverers, but the discovered.  _Our_ colonies are all within twenty six light-years of Earth except  Aldebaran II, which is fifty seven, but which drew a lot of people,  in spite of the distance, because it was so nearly identical with  Earth. On the other hand, the Nevians, from a distance of over a  hundred light-years, found _us_ ... implying an older race and a higher  development ... but you just told me that they would _never_ produce a  Lensman!\"    \"That point stopped me, too, at first. Follow through; I want to see if  you arrive at the same conclusion I did.\"    \"Well ... I ... I ...\" Kinnison thought intensely, then went on: \"Of  course, the Nevians were not colonizing; nor, strictly speaking,  exploring. They were merely hunting for iron--a highly organized,  intensively specialized operation to find a raw material they needed  desperately.\"    \"Precisely,\" Samms agreed.    \"The Rigellians, however, were _surveying_, and Rigel is about four  hundred and forty light-years from here. We didn't have a thing they  needed or wanted. They nodded at us in passing and kept on going. I'm  still on your track?\"    \"Dead center. And just where does that put the Palainians?\"    \"I see ... you may have something there, at that. Palain is so  far away that nobody knows even where it is--probably thousands  of light-years. Yet they have not only explored this system; they  colonized Pluto long before our white race colonized America. But damn  it, Virge, I don't like it--any part of it. Rigel Four you may be able  to take, with your Lens ... even one of their damned automobiles, if  you stay solidly en rapport with the driver. But _Palain_, Virge! Pluto  is bad enough, but the home planet! You can't. Nobody can. It simply  can't be done!\"    \"I know it won't be easy,\" Samms admitted, bleakly, \"but if it's got  to be done, I'll do it. And I have a little information that I haven't  had time to tell you yet. We discussed once before, you remember, what  a job it was to get into any kind of communication with the Palainians  on Pluto. You said then that nobody could understand them, and you were  right--then. However, I re-ran those brain-wave tapes, wearing my Lens,  and could understand them--the thoughts, that is--as well as though  they had been recorded in precisionist-grade English.\"    \"_What?_\" Kinnison exclaimed, then fell silent.
