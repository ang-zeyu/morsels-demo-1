Thoughtfully she gazed from her narrow window.  On all  the desert not a living thing was stirring.    Wait, though!  Something surely WAS stirring on the desert--something  her eyes had not observed at first.  Now it seemed like a cloud; now it  seemed like a spot of silver; now it seemed to be a mass of rainbow  colors that moved swiftly toward her.    What COULD it be, she wondered?    Then, gradually, but in a brief space of time nevertheless, the vision  drew near enough to Dorothy to make out what it was.    A broad green carpet was unrolling itself upon the desert, while  advancing across the carpet was a wonderful procession that made the  girl open her eyes in amazement as she gazed.    First came a magnificent golden chariot, drawn by a great Lion and an  immense Tiger, who stood shoulder to shoulder and trotted along as  gracefully as a well-matched team of thoroughbred horses.  And standing  upright within the chariot was a beautiful girl clothed in flowing  robes of silver gauze and wearing a jeweled diadem upon her dainty  head.  She held in one hand the satin ribbons that guided her  astonishing team, and in the other an ivory wand that separated at the  top into two prongs, the prongs being tipped by the letters \"O\" and  \"Z\", made of glistening diamonds set closely together.    The girl seemed neither older nor larger than Dorothy herself, and at  once the prisoner in the tower guessed that the lovely driver of the  chariot must be that Ozma of Oz of whom she had so lately heard from  Tiktok.    Following close behind the chariot Dorothy saw her old friend the  Scarecrow, riding calmly astride a wooden Saw-Horse, which pranced and  trotted as naturally as any meat horse could have done.    And then came Nick Chopper, the Tin Woodman, with his funnel-shaped cap  tipped carelessly over his left ear, his gleaming axe over his right  shoulder, and his whole body sparkling as brightly as it had ever done  in the old days when first she knew him.    The Tin Woodman was on foot, marching at the head of a company of  twenty-seven soldiers, of whom some were lean and some fat, some short  and some tall; but all the twenty-seven were dressed in handsome  uniforms of various designs and colors, no two being alike in any  respect.    Behind the soldiers the green carpet rolled itself up again, so that  there was always just enough of it for the procession to walk upon, in  order that their feet might not come in contact with the deadly,  life-destroying sands of the desert.    Dorothy knew at once it was a magic carpet she beheld, and her heart  beat high with hope and joy as she realized she was soon to be rescued  and allowed to greet her dearly beloved friends of Oz--the Scarecrow,  the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion.    Indeed, the girl felt herself as good as rescued as soon as she  recognized those in the procession, for she well knew the courage and  loyalty of her old comrades, and also believed that any others who came  from their marvelous country would prove to be pleasant and reliable  acquaintances.    As soon as the last bit of desert was passed and all the procession,  from the beautiful and dainty Ozma to the last soldier, had reached the  grassy meadows of the Land of Ev, the magic carpet rolled itself  together and entirely disappeared.    Then the chariot driver turned her Lion and Tiger into a broad roadway  leading up to the palace, and the others followed, while Dorothy still  gazed from her tower window in eager excitement.    They came quite close to the front door of the palace and then halted,  the Scarecrow dismounting from his Saw-Horse to approach the sign  fastened to the door, that he might read what it said.    Dorothy, just above him, could keep silent no longer.    \"Here I am!\" she shouted, as loudly as she could.  \"Here's Dorothy!\"    \"Dorothy who?\" asked the Scarecrow, tipping his head to look upward  until he nearly lost his balance and tumbled over backward.    \"Dorothy Gale, of course.  Your friend from Kansas,\" she answered.    \"Why, hello, Dorothy!\" said the Scarecrow.  \"What in the world are you  doing up there?\"    \"Nothing,\" she called down, \"because there's nothing to do.  Save me,  my friend--save me!\"    \"You seem to be quite safe now,\" replied the Scarecrow.    \"But I'm a prisoner.  I'm locked in, so that I can't get out,\" she  pleaded.    \"That's all right,\" said the Scarecrow.  \"You might be worse off,  little Dorothy.  Just consider the matter.  You can't get drowned, or  be run over by a Wheeler, or fall out of an apple-tree.  Some folks  would think they were lucky to be up there.\"    \"Well, I don't,\" declared the girl, \"and I want to get down immed'i'tly  and see you and the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion.\"    \"Very well,\" said the Scarecrow, nodding.  \"It shall be just as you  say, little friend.  Who locked you up?\"    \"The princess Langwidere, who is a horrid creature,\" she answered.    At this Ozma, who had been listening carefully to the conversation,  called to Dorothy from her chariot, asking:    \"Why did the Princess lock you up, my dear?\"    \"Because,\" exclaimed Dorothy, \"I wouldn't let her have my head for her  collection, and take an old, cast-off head in exchange for it.\"    \"I do not blame you,\" exclaimed Ozma, promptly.  \"I will see the  Princess at once, and oblige her to liberate you.\"    \"Oh, thank you very, very much!\" cried Dorothy, who as soon as she  heard the sweet voice of the girlish Ruler of Oz knew that she would  soon learn to love her dearly.    Ozma now drove her chariot around to the third door of the wing, upon  which the Tin Woodman boldly proceeded to knock.    As soon as the maid opened the door Ozma, bearing in her hand her ivory  wand, stepped into the hall and made her way at once to the  drawing-room, followed by all her company, except the Lion and the  Tiger.  And the twenty-seven soldiers made such a noise and a clatter  that the little maid Nanda ran away screaming to her mistress,  whereupon the Princess Langwidere, roused to great anger by this rude  invasion of her palace, came running into the drawing-room without any  assistance whatever.    There she stood before the slight and delicate form of the little girl  from Oz and cried out;--    \"How dare you enter my palace unbidden?  Leave this room at once, or I  will bind you and all your people in chains, and throw you into my  darkest dungeons!\"    \"What a dangerous lady!\" murmured the Scarecrow, in a soft voice.    \"She seems a little nervous,\" replied the Tin Woodman.    But Ozma only smiled at the angry Princess.    \"Sit down, please,\" she said, quietly.  \"I have traveled a long way to  see you, and you must listen to what I have to say.\"    \"Must!\" screamed the Princess, her black eyes flashing with fury--for  she still wore her No. 17 head.  \"Must, to ME!\"    \"To be sure,\" said Ozma.  \"I am Ruler of the Land of Oz, and I am  powerful enough to destroy all your kingdom, if I so wish.  Yet I did  not come here to do harm, but rather to free the royal family of Ev  from the thrall of the Nome King, the news having reached me that he is  holding the Queen and her children prisoners.\"    Hearing these words, Langwidere suddenly became quiet.    \"I wish you could, indeed, free my aunt and her ten royal children,\"  said she, eagerly.  \"For if they were restored to their proper forms  and station they could rule the Kingdom of Ev themselves, and that  would save me a lot of worry and trouble.  At present there are at  least ten minutes every day that I must devote to affairs of state, and  I would like to be able to spend my whole time in admiring my beautiful  heads.\"    \"Then we will presently discuss this matter,\" said Ozma, \"and try to  find a way to liberate your aunt and cousins.  But first you must  liberate another prisoner--the little girl you have locked up in your  tower.\"    \"Of course,\" said Langwidere, readily.  \"I had forgotten all about her.  That was yesterday, you know, and a Princess cannot be expected to  remember today what she did yesterday.  Come with me, and I will  release the prisoner at once.\"    So Ozma followed her, and they passed up the stairs that led to the  room in the tower.    While they were gone Ozma's followers remained in the drawing-room, and  the Scarecrow was leaning against a form that he had mistaken for a  copper statue when a harsh, metallic voice said suddenly in his ear:    \"Get off my foot, please.  You are scratch-ing my pol-ish.\"    \"Oh, excuse me!\" he replied, hastily drawing back.  \"Are you alive?\"    \"No,\" said Tiktok, \"I am on-ly a ma-chine.  But I can think and speak  and act, when I am pro-per-ly wound up.  Just now my ac-tion is run  down, and Dor-o-thy has the key to it.\"    \"That's all right,\" replied the Scarecrow.  \"Dorothy will soon be free,  and then she'll attend to your works.  But it must be a great  misfortune not to be alive.  I'm sorry for you.\"    \"Why?\" asked Tiktok.    \"Because you have no brains, as I have,\" said the Scarecrow.    \"Oh, yes, I have,\" returned Tiktok.  \"I am fit-ted with Smith &  Tin-ker's Im-proved Com-bi-na-tion Steel Brains.  They are what make me  think.  What sort of brains are you fit-ted with?\"    \"I don't know,\" admitted the Scarecrow.  \"They were given to me by the  great Wizard of Oz, and I didn't get a chance to examine them before he  put them in.  But they work splendidly and my conscience is very  active.  Have you a conscience?\"    \"No,\" said Tiktok.    \"And no heart, I suppose?\" added the Tin Woodman, who had been  listening with interest to this conversation.    \"No,\" said Tiktok.    \"Then,\" continued the Tin Woodman, \"I regret to say that you are  greatly inferior to my friend the Scarecrow, and to myself.  For we are  both alive, and he has brains which do not need to be wound up, while I  have an excellent heart"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48991"],[0,"Leyte: The Return to the Philippines (#9)"],[1,"coastwatcher stations in operation--one in southern Leyte and  the other on Dinagat Island. These furnished MacArthur information  on the activities of the Japanese in the area. Colonel Kangleon also  used the radio set in southern Leyte to maintain contact with Colonel  Fertig on Mindanao. [66]    As a result of information received from the intelligence network,  on Leyte and in other areas, together with information from other  sources, General MacArthur's intelligence officers were able to piece  together a reasonably accurate picture of the Japanese units on Leyte,  their strength, dispositions, and fortifications.    Kangleon's network, however, was not as active as most of the  others in the Philippines that were operated by coastwatchers and  guerrillas. From March 1944, when Kangleon's network was established,  to October 1944, when the American forces returned, the monthly  totals of messages received by General Headquarters from Leyte were  as follows: March, 6; April, 7; May, 7; June, 12; July, 13; August,  13; September, 17; and October, 26. [67]    The guerrillas of the Philippine Islands made far-reaching  contributions to the war effort. They were an extremely valuable source  of intelligence; their activities forced the Japanese to retain in  the Philippines comparatively large forces which would otherwise have  been sent south; it is estimated that they killed from eight thousand  to ten thousand Japanese troops; and, finally, they bolstered the  morale, spirit, and loyalty of the Filipino people. [68] They kept  alive the hope and belief that the forces of the United States would  return and redeem the Islands.                  CHAPTER III    Plans Are Made and Forces Are Readied      Estimate of the Enemy Situation    American knowledge of the Japanese forces on Leyte was derived  from many sources. [69] The guerrillas on Leyte and other islands  in the archipelago sent information to Australia on the movements,  dispositions, fortifications, and defenses of the Japanese. Commander  Parsons, on his submarine trips to the Islands, brought back with  him important intelligence. Just before the invasion an intelligence  officer from Sixth Army and one from the Seventh Fleet secretly went  ashore from a submarine and gathered material on Japanese coastal  fortifications and defenses in the beach area.    Much effort was expended before the invasion in mapping the island,  but this work was based on prewar maps and the results were very  inaccurate. Since much of the island was under heavy fog for long  periods, the photomaps that were produced had little value. They  missed many important terrain features and misplaced others by  thousands of yards. In general, however, the maps of the beachhead  areas were accurate.    In the spring of 1944 General MacArthur's headquarters received  information that the Japanese were starting to reinforce their  Philippine garrisons. An early estimate, made in June, put the  number of enemy troops on the island at 20,000, a sharp increase  over the 5,900 of the previous month. The increase resulted from  the movement to Leyte from Samar of the veteran 16th Division, which  had fought at Bataan, and the arrival of 4,000 naval troops from the  Palau Islands. [70] For the next month reports flowed in to General  Headquarters that the 16th Division was building coastal defenses and  air-raid shelters, and improving the airfields and garrison defenses  of the island. [71]    In July 1944 the Americans received information that all was not  going well in the Japanese homeland. From a radio interception  they learned that Premier Hideki Tojo and his entire cabinet had  resigned on 18 July. The Japanese message stated: \"The situation is  the result of the period of 'sweating blood' and we sincerely regret  causing anxiety to the Emperor. We thank the people at home and at the  front for co-operating with the government....\" [72] The tenor of the  announcement and of subsequent statements made it abundantly clear,  however, that the Japanese were determined to do their utmost toward  prosecuting the war to a successful conclusion.    Meanwhile, all the Japanese garrisons in the Philippines were  reinforced. The senior headquarters in the western Pacific was  transferred from Singapore to Manila, and the brigades in the Islands  were being developed to divisional strength. Of the estimated 180,000  troops, 80,000 were believed to be on Luzon, 50,000 in the Visayan  Islands, and 50,000 on Mindanao. It was also believed that the enemy  air strength on the Islands was being greatly increased. There were  100 to 120 airfields in operation and between 700 and 1,500 aircraft,  of which half were combat planes and the others training aircraft. [73]    In September 1944 Sixth Army G-2 estimated that the Japanese forces  on Leyte consisted mainly of 16th Division units and service troops--a  total of 21,700 troops. The 35th Army had just been activated on Cebu  and was to be charged with the defense of all the Visayan Islands. It  was estimated that the Leyte garrison consisted of the following  combat troops: 20th Infantry Regiment, 3,000; 33d Infantry Regiment,  3,000; 16th Division Reconnaissance Regiment, 1,000; elements of  102d Division, 1,700; 7th Independent Tank Company, 125; and 16th  Division Headquarters troops, 1,800. The total amounted to 10,625  men. In addition there were 1,000 base-defense troops and 10,075  service troops.    It was believed that the Japanese would commit one division on the day  of the landing and the equivalent of another division, assembled from  the tactical reserves on the island, not later than three days after  the landing. For the next ten days, five to eight regiments might be  sent in from neighboring islands. These would constitute the \"maximum  numbers of reinforcements predicated upon the existence of conditions  most favorable to the enemy.\" [74] The enemy had an undetermined  number of tanks and armored cars. The only artillery known to be  available were some coastal defense guns emplaced along the east  coast and some artillery pieces on the hills overlooking Tacloban.    Sixth Army believed that on Leyte there were five operational  airfields; three probably operational or under construction; seven  nonoperational; and one seaplane base. The two most important  operational airstrips were the one at Tacloban with forty-five  hardstandings and the one at Dulag with twenty hardstandings. The  Tacloban airstrip could accommodate both bombers and fighters. At  the time of the invasion, it was estimated that the Japanese could  oppose the amphibious movement and the landing with 442 fighters and  337 bombers from airfields scattered throughout the Philippines.    Although the possibility existed that the Japanese Fleet, which was  based in waters near the home islands, might move to the Philippines,  such a move was considered doubtful. It was believed that the principal  and immediate threats consisted of a strong cruiser-destroyer task  force; submarines; and motor torpedo boats and similar craft.    Sixth Army concluded that the town of Tacloban, with its important  port and airfield, was the key to the Japanese defense of the  island. Consequently, a strong perimeter defense of the town and  the surrounding area was expected. Since it was impossible for the  Japanese, with a limited number of their troops on the island, to  defend all of the east coast, strong forces and emplaced defensive  positions were likely to be concentrated at road junctions and at the  operational airfields. Mobile reserves would almost certainly be held  in readiness at key points in Leyte Valley, ready to be rushed to the  east coast areas under attack. It was assumed that strong defenses  were already established in the Ormoc area and along the northeast  coast of Ormoc Bay, since the port of Ormoc could be used to bring in  reserves from the other islands in the archipelago. A strong garrison  was expected at Carigara to protect the northern approaches to Leyte  Valley and to repel any amphibious landing through Carigara Bay.    The plan for the liberation of Leyte called for more men, guns, ships,  and aircraft than had been required for any previous operation in the  Pacific. For the first time ground troops from the Central Pacific  and Southwest Pacific were to join and fight the foe under a common  commander. General MacArthur, who had left Luzon in a motor torpedo  boat, was to return to the Philippines with a vast armada--the greatest  seen in the Pacific up to that time.          The Tactical Plan    The Southwest Pacific Area was the command responsibility of General  MacArthur. He had under his command Allied Air Forces, Lt. Gen. George  C. Kenney commanding; Allied Naval Forces, Vice Adm. Thomas C. Kinkaid  commanding; Allied Land Forces, Gen. Sir Thomas Blamey commanding;  United States Army Services of Supply (SWPA), Maj. Gen. James  L. Frink commanding; and Alamo Force, which was virtually Sixth Army,  Lt. Gen. Walter Krueger commanding.    On 31 August 1944 General MacArthur issued his first formal  directive covering projected operations in the Philippines. The Leyte  operation was known as King II. The Southwest Pacific forces were to  \"seize objectives in the Mindanao, Leyte and Samar areas in order  to establish air, naval and logistic bases to cover subsequent  operations to complete the reoccupation of the Philippines.\" The  assigned target dates were as follows: southern Mindanao, 15 November  1944; northwestern Mindanao, 7 December; and Leyte Gulf-Surigao Strait  area, 20 December. The Sixth Army, covered by Admiral Halsey's Third  Fleet and supported by the Allied Air and Naval Forces, was directed  to carry out the three operations. [75] On 15 September General  Krueger received word that the Talaud and Mindanao operations had  been canceled and that the target date--designated as \"A Day\"--for  the Leyte operation had"]]]
