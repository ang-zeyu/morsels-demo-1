The visitors to-day are walking where Caius walked so long ago on the  same paving stones. The three stones were set up to keep chariots out of  the forum.    [ILLUSTRATION: _A Vase Store_]            OLYMPIA    TWO WINNERS OF CROWNS    The July sun was blazing over the country of Greece. Dust from the dry  plain hung in the air. But what cared the happy travelers for dust or  heat? They were on their way to Olympia to see the games. Every road  teemed with a chattering crowd of men and boys afoot and on horses. They  wound down from the high mountains to the north. They came along the  valley from the east and out from among the hills to the south. Up from  the sea led the sacred road, the busiest of all. A little caravan of men  and horses was trying to hurry ahead through the throng. The master  rode in front looking anxiously before him as though he did not see the  crowd. After him rode a lad. His eyes were flashing eagerly here and  there over the strange throng. A man walked beside the horse and watched  the boy smilingly. Behind them came a string of pack horses with slaves  to guard the loads of wine and food and tents and blankets for their  master's camp.    \"What a strange-looking man, Glaucon!\" said the boy. \"He has a dark  skin.\"    The boy's own skin was fair, and under his hat his hair was golden. As  he spoke he pointed to a man on the road who was also riding at the head  of a little caravan. His skin was dark. Shining black hair covered his  ears. His garment was gay with colored stripes.    \"He is a merchant from Egypt,\" answered the man. \"He will have curious  things to sell--vases of glass, beads of amber, carved ivory, and  scrolls gay with painted figures. You must see them, Charmides.\"    But already the boy had forgotten the Egyptian.    \"See the chariot!\" he cried.    It was slowly rolling along the stony road. A grave, handsome man stood  in it holding the reins. Beside him stood another man with a staff in  his hand. Behind the chariot walked two bowmen. After them followed a  long line of pack horses led by slaves. \"They are the delegates from  Athens,\" explained Glaucon. \"There are, doubtless, rich gifts for Zeus  on the horses and perhaps some stone tablets engraved with new laws.\"    But the boy was not listening.    \"Jugglers! Jugglers!\" he cried.    And there they were at the side of the road, showing their tricks and  begging for coins. One man was walking on his hands and tossing a ball  about with his feet. Another was swallowing a sword.    \"Stop, Glaucon!\" cried Charmides, \"I must see him. He will kill  himself.\"    \"No, my little master,\" replied the slave. \"You shall see him again at  Olympia. See your father. He would be vexed if we waited.\"    And there was the master ahead, pushing forward rapidly, looking neither  to the right hand nor the left. The boy sighed.    \"He is hurrying to see Creon. He forgets me!\" he thought.    But immediately his eyes were caught by some new thing, and his face  was gay again. So the little company traveled up the sloping road amid  interesting sights. For here were people from all the corners of the  known world--Greeks from Asia in trailing robes, Arabs in white turbans,  black men from Egypt, kings from Sicily, Persians with their curled  beards, half civilized men from the north in garments of skin. \"See!\"  said Glaucon at last as they reached a hilltop, \"the temple!\"    He pointed ahead. There shone the tip of the roof and its gold ornament.  Hovering above was a marble statue with spread wings.    \"And there is Victory!\" whispered Charmides. \"She is waiting for Creon.  She will never wait for me,\" and he sighed.    The crowd broke into a shout when they saw the temple. A company of  young men flew by, singing a song. Charmides passed a sick man. The  slaves had set down his litter, and he had stretched out his hands  toward the temple and was praying. For the sick were sometimes cured  by a visit to Olympia. The boy's father had struck his heels into his  horse's sides and was galloping forward, calling to his followers to  hasten.    In a few moments they reached higher land. Then they saw the sacred  place spread out before them. There was the wall all around it. Inside  it shone a few buildings and a thousand statues. Along one side  stretched a row of little marble treasure houses. At the far corner lay  the stadion with its rows of stone seats. Nearer and outside the wall  was the gymnasium. Even from a distance Charmides could see men running  about in the court.    \"There are the athletes!\" he thought. \"Creon is with them.\"    Behind all these buildings rose a great hill, dark green with trees.  Down from the hill poured a little stream. It met a wide river that  wound far through the valley. In the angle of these rivers lay Olympia.  The temple and walls and gymnasium were all of stone and looked as  though they had been there forever. But in the meadow all around the  sacred place was a city of winged tents. There were little shapeless  ones of skins lying over sticks. There were round huts woven of rushes.  There were sheds of poles with green boughs laid upon them. There were  tall tents of gaily striped canvas. Farther off were horses tethered.  And everywhere were gaily robed men moving about. Menon, Charmides'  father, looking ahead from the high place, turned to a slave.    \"Run on quickly,\" he said. \"Save a camping place for us there on Mount  Kronion, under the trees.\"    The man was off. Menon spoke to the other servants. \"Push forward and  make camp. I will visit the gymnasium. Come, Charmides, we will go to  see Creon.\"    They rode down the slope toward Olympia. As they passed among the tents  they saw friends and exchanged kind greetings.    \"Ah, Menon!\" called one. \"There is good news of Creon. Every one expects  great things of him.\"    \"I have kept room for your camp next my tent, Menon,\" said another.    \"Here are sights for you, Charmides,\" said a kind old man.    Charmides caught a glimpse of gleaming marble among the crowd and  guessed that some sculptor was showing his statues for sale. Yonder was  a barber's tent. Gentlemen were sitting in chairs and men were cutting  their hair or rubbing their faces smooth with stone. In one place a  man was standing on a little platform. A crowd was gathered about him  listening, while he read from a scroll in his hands.    But the boy had only a glimpse of these things, for his father was  hurrying on. In a moment they crossed a bridge over a river and stopped  before a low, wide building. Glaucon helped Charmides off his horse.  Menon spoke a few words to the porter at the gate. The man opened the  door and led the visitors in. Charmides limped along beside his father,  for he was lame. That was what had made him sigh when he had seen  Victory hovering over Olympia. She would never give him the olive  branch. But now he did not think of that. His heart was beating fast.  His eyes were big. For before him lay a great open court baking in the  sun. More than a hundred boys were at work there, leaping, wrestling,  hurling the disk, throwing spears. During the past months they had been  living here, training for the games. The sun had browned their bare  bodies. Now their smooth skins were shining with sweat and oil. As they  bent and twisted they looked like beautiful statues turned brown and  come alive. Among them walked men in long purple robes. They seemed to  be giving commands.    \"They are the judges,\" whispered Glaucon. \"They train the boys.\"    All around the hot court ran a deep, shady portico. Here boys lay on  the tiled floor or on stone benches, resting from their exercise. Near  Charmides stood one with his back turned. He was scraping the oil and  dust from his body with a strigil. Charmides' eyes danced with joy  at the beauty of the firm, round legs and the muscles moving in the  shoulders. Then the athlete turned toward the visitors and Charmides  cried out, \"Creon!\" and ran and threw his arms around him.    Then there was gay talk; Creon asked about the home and mother and  sisters in Athens, for he had been here in training for almost ten  months. Menon and Charmides had a thousand questions about the games.    \"I know I shall win, father,\" said Creon softly. \"Four nights ago Hermes  appeared to me in my sleep and smiled upon me. I awoke suddenly and  there was a strange, sweet perfume in the air.\"    Tears sprang into his father's eyes. \"Now blessed be the gods!\" he  cried, \"and most blessed Hermes, the god of the gymnasium!\"    After a little Menon and Charmides said farewell and went away through  the chattering crowd and up under the cool trees on Mount Kronion to  their camp. The slaves had cut poles and set them up and thrown a wide  linen cover over them. Under it they had put a little table holding  lumps of brown cheese, a flat loaf of bread, a basket of figs, a pile  of crisp lettuce. Just outside the tent grazed a few goats. A man in a  soiled tunic was squatted milking one. Menon's slave stood waiting and,  as his master came up, he took the big red bowl of foaming milk and  carried it to the table. The goatherd picked up his long crook and  started his flock on, calling, \"Milk! Milk to sell!\"    Menon was gay now. His worries were over. His camp was pitched in a  pleasant place. His son was well and sure of victory.    \"Come, little son,\" he called to Charmides. \"You must be as hungry as a  wolf. But first our thanks to the gods.\"    A slave had poured a little wine into a flat cup and stood now offering  it to his master. Menon took it and held it high, looking up into the  blue heavens.    \"O gracious Hermes!\" he cried aloud, \"fulfill thy omen! And to Zeus,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9629"],[0,"Ghost Stories of an Antiquary Part 2: More Ghost Stories (#9)"],[1,"have had the slightest influence on the decision of the Council.    Believe me (_ut supra_).           *       *       *       *       *    _April 20th_    The Secretary of the ---- Association begs respectfully to inform Mr  Karswell that it is impossible for him to communicate the name of any  person or persons to whom the draft of Mr Karswell's paper may have been  submitted; and further desires to intimate that he cannot undertake to  reply to any further letters on this subject.           *       *       *       *       *    'And who _is_ Mr Karswell?' inquired the Secretary's wife. She had called  at his office, and (perhaps unwarrantably) had picked up the last of  these three letters, which the typist had just brought in.    'Why, my dear, just at present Mr Karswell is a very angry man. But I  don't know much about him otherwise, except that he is a person of  wealth, his address is Lufford Abbey, Warwickshire, and he's an  alchemist, apparently, and wants to tell us all about it; and that's  about all--except that I don't want to meet him for the next week or two.  Now, if you're ready to leave this place, I am.'    'What have you been doing to make him angry?' asked Mrs Secretary.    'The usual thing, my dear, the usual thing: he sent in a draft of a paper  he wanted to read at the next meeting, and we referred it to Edward  Dunning--almost the only man in England who knows about these things--and  he said it was perfectly hopeless, so we declined it. So Karswell has  been pelting me with letters ever since. The last thing he wanted was the  name of the man we referred his nonsense to; you saw my answer to that.  But don't you say anything about it, for goodness' sake.'    'I should think not, indeed. Did I ever do such a thing? I do hope,  though, he won't get to know that it was poor Mr Dunning.'    'Poor Mr Dunning? I don't know why you call him that; he's a very happy  man, is Dunning. Lots of hobbies and a comfortable home, and all his time  to himself.'    'I only meant I should be sorry for him if this man got hold of his name,  and came and bothered him.'    'Oh, ah! yes. I dare say he would be poor Mr Dunning then.'    The Secretary and his wife were lunching out, and the friends to whose  house they were bound were Warwickshire people. So Mrs Secretary had  already settled it in her own mind that she would question them  judiciously about Mr Karswell. But she was saved the trouble of leading  up to the subject, for the hostess said to the host, before many minutes  had passed, 'I saw the Abbot of Lufford this morning.' The host whistled.  '_Did_ you? What in the world brings him up to town?' 'Goodness knows; he  was coming out of the British Museum gate as I drove past.' It was not  unnatural that Mrs Secretary should inquire whether this was a real Abbot  who was being spoken of. 'Oh no, my dear: only a neighbour of ours in the  country who bought Lufford Abbey a few years ago. His real name is  Karswell.' 'Is he a friend of yours?' asked Mr Secretary, with a private  wink to his wife. The question let loose a torrent of declamation. There  was really nothing to be said for Mr Karswell. Nobody knew what he did  with himself: his servants were a horrible set of people; he had invented  a new religion for himself, and practised no one could tell what  appalling rites; he was very easily offended, and never forgave anybody;  he had a dreadful face (so the lady insisted, her husband somewhat  demurring); he never did a kind action, and whatever influence he did  exert was mischievous. 'Do the poor man justice, dear,' the husband  interrupted. 'You forget the treat he gave the school children.' 'Forget  it, indeed! But I'm glad you mentioned it, because it gives an idea of  the man. Now, Florence, listen to this. The first winter he was at  Lufford this delightful neighbour of ours wrote to the clergyman of his  parish (he's not ours, but we know him very well) and offered to show the  school children some magic-lantern slides. He said he had some new kinds,  which he thought would interest them. Well, the clergyman was rather  surprised, because Mr Karswell had shown himself inclined to be  unpleasant to the children--complaining of their trespassing, or  something of the sort; but of course he accepted, and the evening was  fixed, and our friend went himself to see that everything went right. He  said he never had been so thankful for anything as that his own children  were all prevented from being there: they were at a children's party at  our house, as a matter of fact. Because this Mr Karswell had evidently  set out with the intention of frightening these poor village children out  of their wits, and I do believe, if he had been allowed to go on, he  would actually have done so. He began with some comparatively mild  things. Red Riding Hood was one, and even then, Mr Farrer said, the wolf  was so dreadful that several of the smaller children had to be taken out:  and he said Mr Karswell began the story by producing a noise like a wolf  howling in the distance, which was the most gruesome thing he had ever  heard. All the slides he showed, Mr Farrer said, were most clever; they  were absolutely realistic, and where he had got them or how he worked  them he could not imagine. Well, the show went on, and the stories kept  on becoming a little more terrifying each time, and the children were  mesmerized into complete silence. At last he produced a series which  represented a little boy passing through his own park--Lufford, I  mean--in the evening. Every child in the room could recognize the place  from the pictures. And this poor boy was followed, and at last pursued  and overtaken, and either torn in  pieces or somehow made away with, by a  horrible hopping creature in white, which you saw first dodging about  among the trees, and gradually it appeared more and more plainly. Mr  Farrer said it gave him one of the worst nightmares he ever remembered,  and what it must have meant to the children doesn't bear thinking of. Of  course this was too much, and he spoke very sharply indeed to Mr  Karswell, and said it couldn't go on. All _he_ said was: \"Oh, you think  it's time to bring our little show to an end and send them home to their  beds? _Very_ well!\" And then, if you please, he switched on another  slide, which showed a great mass of snakes, centipedes, and disgusting  creatures with wings, and somehow or other he made it seem as if they  were climbing out of the picture and getting in amongst the audience; and  this was accompanied by a sort of dry rustling noise which sent the  children nearly mad, and of course they stampeded. A good many of them  were rather hurt in getting out of the room, and I don't suppose one of  them closed an eye that night. There was the most dreadful trouble in the  village afterwards. Of course the mothers threw a good part of the blame  on poor Mr Farrer, and, if they could have got past the gates, I believe  the fathers would have broken every window in the Abbey. Well, now,  that's Mr Karswell: that's the Abbot of Lufford, my dear, and you can  imagine how we covet _his_ society.'    'Yes, I think he has all the possibilities of a distinguished criminal,  has Karswell,' said the host. 'I should be sorry for anyone who got into  his bad books.'    'Is he the man, or am I mixing him up with someone else?' asked the  Secretary (who for some minutes had been wearing the frown of the man who  is trying to recollect something). 'Is he the man who brought out a  _History of Witchcraft_ some time back--ten years or more?'    'That's the man; do you remember the reviews of it?'    'Certainly I do; and what's equally to the point, I knew the author of  the most incisive of the lot. So did you: you must remember John  Harrington; he was at John's in our time.'    'Oh, very well indeed, though I don't think I saw or heard anything of  him between the time I went down and the day I read the account of the  inquest on him.'    'Inquest?' said one of the ladies. 'What has happened to him?'    'Why, what happened was that he fell out of a tree and broke his neck.  But the puzzle was, what could have induced him to get up there. It was a  mysterious business, I must say. Here was this man--not an athletic  fellow, was he? and with no eccentric twist about him that was ever  noticed--walking home along a country road late in the evening--no tramps  about--well known and liked in the place--and he suddenly begins to run  like mad, loses his hat and stick, and finally shins up a tree--quite a  difficult tree--growing in the hedgerow: a dead branch gives way, and he  comes down with it and breaks his neck, and there he's found next morning  with the most dreadful face of fear on him that could be imagined. It was  pretty evident, of course, that he had been chased by something, and  people talked of savage dogs, and beasts escaped out of menageries; but  there was nothing to be made of that. That was in '89, and I believe his  brother Henry (whom I remember as well at Cambridge, but _you_ probably  don't) has been trying to get on the track of an explanation ever since.  He, of course, insists there was malice in it, but I don't know. It's  difficult to see how it could have come in.'    After a time the talk reverted to the _History of Witchcraft_. 'Did you  ever look into it?' asked the host.    'Yes, I did,' said the Secretary. 'I went so far as to read it.'    'Was it as bad as it was made out to be?'    'Oh, in point of style and form, quite hopeless. It deserved all the  pulverizing it got. But, besides that, it was an evil book. The man  believed every word of what he was saying, and I'm very much mistaken if  he hadn't tried the greater part of his receipts.'    'Well, I only remember Harrington's review of it, and I must say if I'd  been the author it would have quenched my literary ambition for good. I  should never have held up my head again.'
