It's  him, you know, that persuades this Franciscan...\"    \"Pause,\" I said, \"what Franciscan?\"    \"Fra Fraliccolo, of course,\" Sinclair said snappishly.  \"You see, Pio tries to...\"    \"Whoa!\" I said, \"who is Pio?\"    \"Oh, hang it all, Pio is Italian, it's short for Pius.  He tries to get Fra Fraliccolo and Carlo Carlotti the  Condottiere to steal the document from...let me see;  what was he called?...Oh, yes...from the Dog of Venice,  so that...or...no, hang it, you put me out, that's all  wrong. It's the other way round. Pio wasn't clever at  all; he's a regular darned fool. It's the Dog that's  crafty. By Jove, he's fine,\" Sinclair went on; warming  up to enthusiasm again, \"he just does anything he wants.  He makes this Demonio (Demonio is one of those hirelings,  you know, he's the tool of the Dog)...makes him steal  the document off Porphirio, and...\"    \"But how does he get him to do that?\" I asked.    \"Oh, the Dog has Demonio pretty well under his thumb, so  he makes Demonio scheme round till he gets old Pio--er--gets  him under his thumb, and then, of course, Pio thinks that  Porphirio--I mean he thinks that he has Porphirio--er--has  him under his thumb.\"    \"Half a minute, Sinclair,\" I said, \"who did you say was  under the Dog's thumb?\"    \"Demonio.\"    \"Thanks. I was mixed in the thumbs.

You see, if it hadn't been for the  domino, the Dog would have spotted her quick as a wink.  Only when he sees her in the domino with this rose in  her hair, he thinks she must be Lucia dell' Esterolla.\"    \"Say, he fools himself, doesn't he? Who's this last girl?\"    \"Lucia? Oh, she's great!\" Sinclair said. \"She's one of  those Southern natures, you know, full of--er--full of...\"    \"Full of fun,\" I suggested.    \"Oh, hang it all, don't make fun of it! Well, anyhow,  she's sister, you understand, to the Contessa Carantarata,  and that's why Fra Fraliccolo, or...hold on, that's not  it, no, no, she's not sister to anybody. She's cousin,  that's it; or, anyway, she thinks she is cousin to Fra  Fraliccolo himself, and that's why Pio tries to stab Fra  Fraliccolo.\"    \"Oh, yes,\" I assented, \"naturally he would.\"    \"Ah,\" Sinclair said hopefully, getting his paper-cutter  ready to cut the next pages, \"you begin to get the thread  now, don't you?\"    \"Oh, fine!\" I said. \"The people in it are the Dog and  Pio, and Carlo Carlotti the Condottiere, and those others  that we spoke of.\"    \"That's right,\" Sinclair said. \"Of course, there are more  still that I can tell you about if...\"    \"Oh, never mind,\" I said, \"I'll work along with those,  they're a pretty representative crowd. Then Porphirio is  under Pio's thumb, and Pio is under Demonio's thumb, and  the Dog is crafty, and Lucia is full of something all  the time. Oh, I've got a mighty clear idea of it,\" I  concluded bitterly.    \"Oh, you've got it,\" Sinclair said, \"I knew you'd like  it. Now we'll go on. I'll just finish to the bottom of  my page and then I'll go on aloud.\"    He ran his eyes rapidly over the lines till he came to  the bottom of the page, then he cut the leaves and turned  over. I saw his eye rest on the half-dozen lines that  confronted him on the next page with an expression of  utter consternation.    \"Well, I will be cursed!\" he said at length.    \"What's the matter?\" I said gently, with a great joy at  my heart.    \"This infernal thing's a serial,\" he gasped, as he pointed  at the words, \"To be continued,\" \"and that's all there  is in this number.\"          Telling His Faults    \"Oh, do, Mr. Sapling,\" said the beautiful girl at the  summer hotel, \"do let me read the palm of your hand! I  can tell you all your faults.\"    Mr. Sapling gave an inarticulate gurgle and a roseate  flush swept over his countenance as he surrendered his  palm to the grasp of the fair enchantress.    \"Oh, you're just full of faults, just full of them, Mr.  Sapling!\" she cried.    Mr. Sapling looked it.    \"To begin with,\" said the beautiful girl, slowly and  reflectingly, \"you are dreadfully cynical: you hardly  believe in anything at all, and you've utterly no faith  in us poor women.\"    The feeble smile that had hitherto kindled the features  of Mr. Sapling into a ray of chastened imbecility, was  distorted in an effort at cynicism.    \"Then your next fault is that you are too determined;  much too determined. When once you have set your will on  any object, you crush every obstacle under your feet.\"    Mr. Sapling looked meekly down at his tennis shoes, but  began to feel calmer, more lifted up. Perhaps he had been  all these things without knowing it.    \"Then you are cold and sarcastic.\"    Mr. Sapling attempted to look cold and sarcastic. He  succeeded in a rude leer.    \"And you're horribly world-weary, you care for nothing.  You have drained philosophy to the dregs, and scoff at  everything.\"    Mr. Sapling's inner feeling was that from now on he would  simply scoff and scoff and scoff.    \"Your only redeeming quality is that you are generous.  You have tried to kill even this, but cannot. Yes,\"  concluded the beautiful girl, \"those are your faults,  generous still, but cold, cynical, and relentless. Good  night, Mr. Sapling.\"    And resisting all entreaties the beautiful girl passed  from the verandah of the hotel and vanished.    And when later in the evening the brother of the beautiful  girl borrowed Mr. Sapling's tennis racket, and his bicycle  for a fortnight, and the father of the beautiful girl  got Sapling to endorse his note for a couple of hundreds,  and her uncle Zephas borrowed his bedroom candle and used  his razor to cut up a plug of tobacco, Mr. Sapling felt  proud to be acquainted with the family.          Winter Pastimes    It is in the depth of winter, when the intense cold  renders it desirable to stay at home, that the really  Pleasant Family is wont to serve invitations upon a few  friends to spend a Quiet Evening.    It is at these gatherings that that gay thing, the indoor  winter game, becomes rampant. It is there that the old  euchre deck and the staring domino become fair and  beautiful things; that the rattle of the Loto counter  rejoices the heart, that the old riddle feels the sap  stirring in its limbs again, and the amusing spilikin  completes the mental ruin of the jaded guest. Then does  the Jolly Maiden Aunt propound the query: What is the  difference between an elephant and a silk hat? Or declare  that her first is a vowel, her second a preposition, and  her third an archipelago. It is to crown such a quiet  evening, and to give the finishing stroke to those of  the visitors who have not escaped early, with a fierce  purpose of getting at the saloons before they have time  to close, that the indoor game or family reservoir of  fun is dragged from its long sleep. It is spread out upon  the table. Its paper of directions is unfolded. Its cards,  its counters, its pointers and its markers are distributed  around the table, and the visitor forces a look of reckless  pleasure upon his face. Then the \"few simple directions\"  are read aloud by the Jolly Aunt, instructing each  player to challenge the player holding the golden letter  corresponding to the digit next in order, to name a dead  author beginning with X, failing which the player must  declare himself in fault, and pay the forfeit of handing  over to the Jolly Aunt his gold watch and all his money,  or having a hot plate put down his neck.    With a view to bringing some relief to the guests at  entertainments of this kind, I have endeavoured to  construct one or two little winter pastimes of a novel  character. They are quite inexpensive, and as they need  no background of higher arithmetic or ancient history,  they are within reach of the humblest intellect. Here is  one of them. It is called Indoor Football, or Football  without a Ball.    In this game any number of players, from fifteen to  thirty, seat themselves in a heap on any one player,  usually the player next to the dealer. They then challenge  him to get up, while one player stands with a stop-watch  in his hand and counts forty seconds. Should the first  player fail to rise before forty seconds are counted,  the player with the watch declares him suffocated. This  is called a \"Down\" and counts one. The player who was  the Down is then leant against the wall; his wind is  supposed to be squeezed out. The player called the referee  then blows a whistle and the players select another player  and score a down off him. While the player is supposed  to be down, all the rest must remain seated as before,  and not rise from him until the referee by counting forty  and blowing his whistle announces that in his opinion  the other player is stifled. He is then leant against  the wall beside the first player. When the whistle again  blows the player nearest the referee strikes him behind  the right ear. This is a \"Touch,\" and counts two.    It is impossible, of course, to give all the rules in  detail. I might add, however, that while it counts TWO  to strike the referee, to kick him counts THREE. To break  his arm or leg counts FOUR, and to kill him outright is  called GRAND SLAM and counts one game.    Here is another little thing that I have worked out,  which is"]]]
