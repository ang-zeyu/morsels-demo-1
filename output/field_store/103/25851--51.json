[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60235"],[0,"The Seventy's Course in Theology, First Year (#9)"],[1," _Organization of the Seventy._ The quorums of Seventy are organized  with special reference to their calling as the foreign ministry of  the Church. It will be observed that their organization is different  from that of every other quorum in the Church, for whereas in all  other quorums of the higher Priesthood the presidency consists of  one president and two counselors, in the quorum of the Seventy  there are seven presidents of equal power and authority. That is to  say, there is not one president and six counselors, but each of the  seven is a president and in power and authority is equal with his  fellow-presidents; but for the sake of order the right of presidency  is recognized as being vested in the senior president by ordination.  \"And it is according to the vision, showing the order of the Seventy,  that they should have seven presidents to preside over them, chosen out  of the number of the Seventy. And the seventh president (counting from  the one last ordained) of these presidents is to preside over the six.\"  In the absence of the senior president the next senior in ordination  becomes the acting president. By this simple arrangement all confusion  as to the right of presiding is obviated, for no sooner does the  council of a quorum or any part thereof convene, than each president  knows at once upon whom the responsibility of presiding rests, let them  meet where they may.    By virtue of having seven presidents a quorum of Seventy is not easily  disorganized, and this doubtless was one of the objects in view in this  arrangement. One, two, three, or even six of the presidents could be  sent abroad upon missions (although that is not likely to be the case  at any one time) and yet the quorum would have a president left, who,  with the quorum, would be competent to transact whatever of business  might be necessary for that quorum.    Other duties and advantages growing out of this organization are  apparent on a little reflection. Suppose, for instance, that a quorum  of Seventy should be sent out bodily to preach the gospel, as the  quorum of the Twelve at times have been. You would then have an  organization which could be broken up into seven groups of ten men  each, with a president for each group. These groups could be broken  up into five pairs, and the Elders travel two and two, as the law of  the gospel requires. It can be readily seen that such a quorum could  be a flying column, capable of being broken up, first into groups and  sent into different districts; and the groups again broken up into  pairs and spread out over a wide area of country. The pairs could be  called together in groups of ten for conference, for adjustment and  rearrangement of traveling companions, and the groups occasionally  brought together in quorum conference, report, or transact whatever  business might be necessary, and again be scattered into fields of  labor. In all of which there appears the very finest adaptation of  means to an end; and also there appears more than mere human wisdom  displayed in this organization of the quorums of the foreign ministry.    4. _Of the First Quorum of the Seventy:_ In the revelation before  quoted it is said: \"And it is according to the vision, showing the  order of the Seventy, that they should have seven presidents to preside  over them, chosen out of the number of the seventy. * * * And these  seven presidents are to choose other Seventy besides the first Seventy,  to whom they belong, and are to preside over them; and also other  Seventy, until seven times seventy, if the labor in the vineyard of  necessity requires it.\"    It must not be understood that this passage limits the number of  quorums to seven times seventy, for the Prophet, at the time the  quorums were being organized, stated that \"If the first Seventy are  all employed and there is a call for more laborers, it will be the  duty of the seven presidents of the first Seventy to call and ordain  other Seventy, and send them forth to labor in the vineyard, until if  needs be, they set apart seven times seventy, and even until there are  144,000 thus set apart for the ministry.\" (See Church History, Vol. II:  221 and Notes.)    It will be observed in the quotation from the Doctrine & Covenants  above that provision is made that the presidents of Seventy are to  be \"chosen out of the number of the Seventy.\" It is because of this  special provision that when inadvertently High Priests have been  selected for presidents of Seventy they have taken their place again  in the quorum of High Priests and others from among the Seventy, as  provided by the law of God, chosen to fill their place. It will also  be observed that the council of the First Seventy, in addition to  presiding over their own quorum (the first), have a general presidency  over all the quorums of the Church. It is this first quorum, members  and presidents together, which constitutes what, by way of explanation,  we may call _the_ quorum of Seventy, the quorum of which it is said  that they are equal in authority to the quorum of the twelve special  witnesses, or Apostles.    5. _Summary._ It may be said by way of recapitulation that the Seventy  hold the Melchisedek Priesthood; that with the Twelve, under whose  directions they labor, they constitute the foreign ministry of the  Church: that their special calling is to travel and preach the gospel  in all nations, first to the Gentiles and then to the Jews; that they  can, on occasion be employed in the work of the ministry at home,  because their Priesthood authorizes them to do good and bring to pass  righteousness wherever they may be, and when acting in order and under  the direction of the Twelve Apostles they may do whatever is necessary  to be done in order to accomplish the purposes of God, whose ministers  they are; but their organization has particular reference to their  special work of preaching the Gospel in all the world.    6. _An Intelligent and Informed Ministry Contemplated in the Church:_  After this brief review of the organization and duties of the  Seventies, it must be clearly manifest that it is the imperative duty  of those holding this office in the Priesthood to make careful and  thorough preparation to discharge the responsibilities of their high  calling as the ambassadors of the Lord Jesus. Being special witnesses  of the name of Christ in all the world, preachers (i. e., teachers)  of the gospel, and authorized under the direction of the Twelve  Apostles to act in the name of the Lord in \"building up the Church and  regulating all the affairs of the same in all nations\" (Doc. & Cov.  Sec. cvii), it behooves them to become witnesses who understand the  truth of which they testify, skilled workman, ambassadors of whom the  Master need not be ashamed. It is evident that the Lord never designed  that his ministry should be an ignorant ministry; for to the early  Elders of his Church, in this last dispensation, when instructing a  number of them to prepare for labor in the vineyard, he said:        \"And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another      the doctrine of the kingdom; teach ye diligently and my grace shall      attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory,      in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things      that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you      to understand. Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and      under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things      which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things      which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations,      and the judgments which are on the land, and a knowledge also of      countries and of kingdoms. That ye may be prepared in all things      when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have      called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you. * *      * Therefore, verily, I say unto you, my friends, call your solemn      assembly, as I have commanded you; and as all have not faith, seek,      ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye      out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning even by study,      and also by faith.\" (Doc. & Cov. Sec. 88:77, 78, 80 and 117, 118.)    The instructions then given to the Elders of the Church are still  applicable to men engaged in the same ministry, and charged with like  responsibility.    Elsewhere I have said, on the foregoing passage from the Doctrine and  Covenants:        \"I think I may safely challenge any one to point out a broader      field of knowledge than is here indicated. It includes      all spiritual truth, all scientific truth, all secular      knowledge--knowledge of the past, of the present, of the      future; of the heavens, and of the earth. A knowledge of all      countries, their geography, languages, history, customs, laws      and governments--everything in fact that pertains to them. There      is nothing in the heights above or the depths below that is not      included in this field of knowledge into which the commandment      of God directs his servants to enter. I may claim for it that      it includes the whole realm of man's intellectual activities.      And the doctrine that whatever principles of intelligence man      attains unto in this life will rise with him in the morning of      the resurrection--this doctrine that nothing acquired in respect      of knowledge is ever lost, must forever form the most powerful      incentive to intellectual effort that possibly can be conjured      up by the wit of man. So that, referring to the acquirement of      knowledge, and intellectual development, Mormonism at once both      indicates the broadest field and furnishes the grandest incentive      to intellectual effort.\" (\"The Mormon Point of View in Education,\"      Improvement Era, Vol. II, p. 119.)

His mind approaches most  closely to that of man, and it carries him farthest upward toward  the human level. He can learn more by training, and learn more  easily, than any other animal.    The Orang-Utan is mentally next to the chimpanzee.    The Indian Elephant in mental capacity is third from man.    The high-class domestic Horse is a very wise and capable animal;  but this is chiefly due to its age-long association with man, and  education by him. Mentally the wild horse is a very different  animal, and in the intellectual scale it ranks with the deer and  antelopes.    The Beaver manifests, in domestic economy, more intelligence,  mechanical skill and reasoning power than any other wild animal.    The Lion is endowed with keen perceptive faculties, reasoning  ability and judgment of a high order, and its mind is  surprisingly receptive.    The Grizzly Bear is believed to be the wisest of all bears.    The Pack Rat (_Neotona_) is the intellectual phenomenon of  the great group of gnawing animals. It is in a class by itself.    The White Mountain Goat seems to be the wisest of all the mountain  summit animals whose habits are known to zoologists and sportsmen.    A high-class Dog is the animal that mentally is in closest touch  with the mind, the feelings and the impulses of man; and it is the  only one that can read a man's feelings from his eyes and his  facial expression.    The Marvelous Beaver. Let us consider this animal as an  illuminating example of high-power intelligence.    In domestic economy the beaver is the most intelligent of all  living mammals. His inherited knowledge, his original thought, his  reasoning power and his engineering and mechanical skill in  constructive works are marvelous and beyond compare. In his  manifold industrial activities, there is no other mammal that is  even a good second to him. He builds dams both great and  small, to provide water in which to live, to store food and to  escape from his enemies. He builds air-tight houses of sticks and  mud, either as islands, or on the shore. When he cannot live as a  pond-beaver with a house he cheerfully becomes a river-beaver.  He lives in a river-bank burrow when house-building in a pond  is impossible; and he will cheerfully tunnel under a stone wall  from one-pond monotony, to go exploring outside.    [Illustration: CHRISTMAS AT THE  PRIMATES' HOUSE Chimpanzees (with large ears) and orang-utans  (small ears). The animal on the extreme right is an orang of the  common caste]    He cuts down trees, both small and large, and he makes them fall  as he wishes them to fall. He trims off all branches, and leaves  no \"slash\" to cumber the ground. He buries green branches, in  great quantity, in the mud at the bottom of his pond, so that in  winter he can get at them under a foot of solid ice. He digs  canals, of any length he pleases, to float logs and billets of  wood from hinterland to pond.    If you are locating beavers in your own zoo, and are wise, you can  induce beavers to build their dam where you wish it to be. This is  how we did it!    We dug out a pond of mud in order that the beavers might have a  pond of water; and we wished the beavers to build a dam forty feet  long, at a point about thirty feet from the iron fence where the  brook ran out. On thinking it over we concluded that we could  manage it by showing the animals where we wished them to go to  work.    We set a l2-inch plank on its edge, all the way across the dam  site, and pegged it down. Above it the water soon formed a little  pool and began to flow over the top edge in a very miniature  waterfall. Then we turned loose four beavers and left them.    The next morning we found a cart-load of sticks and fresh mud  placed like a dam against the iron fence. In beaver language this  said to us:    \"We would rather build our dam here,--if you don't mind. It will  be easier for us, and quicker.\"    We removed all their material; and in our language that action  said: \"No; we would rather have you build over the plank.\"    The next night more mud and sticks piled against the fence said to  us,    \"We really _insist_ upon building it here!\"    We made a second clearance of their materials, saying in effect:    \"You _shall not_ build against the fence! You _must_  build where we tell you!\"    Thereupon, the beavers began to build over the plank, saying,    \"Oh, well, if you are going to make a fuss about it, we will let  you have your way.\"    So they built a beautiful water-tight dam precisely where we  suggested it to them, and after that our only trouble was to keep  them from overdoing the matter, and flooding the whole valley.    I am not going to dwell upon the mind and manners of the beaver.  The animal is well known. Three excellent books have been written  and pictured about him, in the language that the General Reader  understands. They are as follows: \"The American Beaver and His  Works,\" Lewis H. Morgan (1868); \"The Romance of the Beaver,\" A. R.  Dugmore (no date); \"History and Traditions of the Canada Beaver,\"  H. T. Martin (1892).    \"Clever Hans,\" the \"Thinking Horse.\" From 1906 to 1910 the world  read much about a wonderful educated horse owned and educated by  Herr von Osten, in Germany. The German scientists who first came  in touch with \"Hans\" were quite bowled over by the discovery that  that one horse could \"think.\" The _Review of Reviews_ said,  in 1910:    \"It may be recalled that Clever Hans knew figures and letters,  colors and tones, the calendar and the dial, that he could count  and read, deal with decimals and fractions, spell out answers to  questions with his right hoof, and recognize people from having  seen their photographs. In every case his 'replies' were given in  the form of scrapings with his right forehoof.    \"Whether the questioner was von Osten, who had worked with him for  seven years, or a man like Schillings, who was a complete  stranger, seemed immaterial; and this went farthest, perhaps, in  disposing of all talk of 'collusion' between master and beast.\"    Now, by the bald records of the case the fact was fixed for all  time that Hans was the most wonderful mental prodigy that ever  bore the form of a four-footed animal. His learning and his  performances were astounding, and even uncanny. I do not care how  he was trained, nor by what process he received ideas and reacted  to them! He was a phenomenon, and I doubt whether this world ever  sees his like again. His mastery of figures alone, no matter how  it was wrought, was enough to make any animal or trainer  illustrious.    But eventually Clever Hans came to grief. He was ostensibly  thrown off his pedestal, in Germany, by human jealousy and  egotism. Several industrious German scientists deliberately set  to work to discredit him, and they stuck to it until they  accomplished that task. The chief instrument in this was no less a  man than the director of the \"Psychological Institute\" of the  Berlin University, Professor Otto Pfungst. He found that when Hans  was put on the witness stand and subjected to rigid cross  examinations _by strangers_, his answers were due partly to  _telepathy and hypnotic influence_! For example, the  discovery was made that Hans could not always give the correct  answer to a problem in figures unless it was known to the  questioner himself.    To Hans's inquisitors this discovery imparted a terrible shock. It  did not look like \"thinking\" after all! The mental process was  _different_ from the process of the German mind! The  wonderful fact that Hans could remember and recognize and  _reproduce_ the ten digits was entirely lost to view. At once  a shout went up all over Germany,--in the scientific circle, that  Hans was an \"impostor,\" that he could not \"think,\" and that his  mind was nothing much after all.    Poor Hans! The glory that should have been his, and imperishable,  is gone. He was the victim of scientists of one idea, who had no  sense of proportion. He truly WAS a thinking horse; and we are  sure that there are millions of men whose minds could not be  developed to the point that the mind of that \"dumb\" animal  attained,--no, not even with the aid of hypnotism and telepathy.    The bare fact that a horse _can_ be influenced by occult  mental powers proves the close parallelism that exists between the  brains of men and beasts. The Trap-Door Spider. Let no one  suppose for one moment that animal mind and intelligence is  limited to the brain-bearing vertebrates. The scope and activity  of the notochord in some of the invertebrates present phenomena  far more wonderful per capita than many a brain produces.  Interesting books have been written, and more will be written  hereafter, on the minds and doings of ants, bees, wasps, spiders  and other insects.    Consider the ways and means of the ant-lion of the East, and the  trap-door spider of the western desert regions. As one object  lesson from the insect world, I will flash upon the screen, for a  moment only, the trap-door spider. This wonderful insect personage  has been exhaustively studied by Mr. Raymond L."]]]
