A fierce battle ensued, which lasted  from noon till the going down of the sun. The Christians gained and  maintained the advantage, each man fighting as if upon himself alone  had depended the fortune of the day. Hundreds of Turks perished in the  Orontes, and more than two thousand were left dead upon the field of  battle. All the provision was recaptured and brought in safety to the  camp, whither the crusaders returned singing Allelulia! or shouting  Deus adjuva! Deus adjuva!    This relief lasted for some days, and, had it been duly economized,  would have lasted much longer; but the chiefs had no authority, and  were unable to exercise any control over its distribution. Famine again  approached with rapid strides, and Stephen Count of Blois, not liking  the prospect, withdrew from the camp, with four thousand of his  retainers, and established himself at Alexandretta. The moral influence  of this desertion was highly prejudicial upon those who remained; and  Bohemund, the most impatient and ambitious of the chiefs, foresaw that,  unless speedily checked, it would lead to the utter failure of the  expedition. It was necessary to act decisively; the army murmured at  the length of the siege, and the Sultan was collecting his forces to  crush them. Against the efforts of the crusaders Antioch might have  held out for months; but treason within effected that, which courage  without might have striven for in vain.    Baghasihan, the Turkish Prince or Emir of Antioch, had under his  command an Armenian of the name of Phirouz, whom he had intrusted with  the defence of a tower on that part of the city wall which overlooked  the passes of the mountains. Bohemund, by means of a spy who had  embraced the Christian religion, and to whom he had given his own name  at baptism, kept up a daily communication with this captain, and made  him the most magnificent promises of reward, if he would deliver up his  post to the Christian knights. Whether the proposal was first made by  Bohemund or by the Armenian is uncertain, but that a good understanding  soon existed between them, is undoubted; and a night was fixed for the  execution of the project. Bohemund communicated the scheme to Godfrey  and the Count of Toulouse, with the stipulation that, if the city were  won, he, as the soul of the enterprise, should enjoy the dignity of  Prince of Antioch. The other leaders hesitated: ambition and jealousy  prompted them to refuse their aid in furthering the views of the  intriguer. More mature consideration decided them to acquiesce, and  seven hundred of the bravest knights were chosen for the expedition,  the real object of which, for fear of spies, was kept a profound secret  from the rest of the army. When all was ready, a report was  promulgated, that the seven hundred were intended to form an ambuscade  for a division of the Sultan's army, which was stated to be approaching.    Every thing favoured the treacherous project of the Armenian captain,  who, on his solitary watchtower, received due intimation of the  approach of the crusaders. The night was dark and stormy; not a star  was visible above, and the wind howled so furiously as to overpower all  other sounds: the rain fell in torrents, and the watchers on the towers  adjoining to that of Phirouz could not hear the tramp of the armed  knights for the wind, nor see them for the obscurity of the night and  the dismalness of the weather. When within shot of the walls, Bohemund  sent forward an interpreter to confer with the Armenian. The latter  urged them to make haste, and seize the favourable interval, as armed  men, with lighted torches, patrolled the battlements every half hour,  and at that instant they had just passed.  The chiefs were instantly at  the foot of the wall: Phirouz let down a rope; Bohemund attached it to  the end of a ladder of hides, which was then raised by the Armenian,  and held while the knights mounted. A momentary fear came over the  spirits of the adventurers, and every one hesitated. At last Bohemund,  [Vide William of Tyre.] encouraged by Phirouz from above, ascended a  few steps on the ladder, and was followed by Godfrey, Count Robert of  Flanders, and a number of other knights. As they advanced, others  pressed forward, until their weight became too great for the ladder,  which, breaking, precipitated about a dozen of them to the ground,  where they fell one upon the other, making a great clatter with their  heavy coats of mail. For a moment they thought that all was lost; but  the wind made so loud a howling as it swept in fierce gusts through the  mountain gorges--and the Orontes, swollen by the rain, rushed so  noisily along--that the guards heard nothing. The ladder was easily  repaired, and the knights ascended two at a time, and reached the  platform in safety, When sixty of them had thus ascended, the torch of  the coming patrol was seen to gleam at the angle of the wall. Hiding  themselves behind a buttress, they awaited his coming in breathless  silence. As soon as he arrived at arm's length, he was suddenly seized,  and, before he could open his lips to raise an alarm, the silence of  death closed them up for ever.  They next descended rapidly the spiral  staircase of the tower, and, opening the portal, admitted the whole of  their companions. Raymond of Toulouse, who, cognizant of the whole  plan, had been left behind with the main body of the army, heard at  this instant the signal horn, which announced that an entry had been  effected, and, leading on his legions, the town was attacked from  within and without.    Imagination cannot conceive a scene more dreadful than that presented  by the devoted city of Antioch on that night of horror. The crusaders  fought with a blind fury, which fanaticism and suffering alike incited.  Men, women, and children were indiscriminately slaughtered till the  streets ran in gore. Darkness increased the destruction, for when  morning dawned the crusaders found themselves with their swords at the  breasts of their fellow-soldiers, whom they had mistaken for foes. The  Turkish commander fled, first to the citadel, and that becoming  insecure, to the mountains, whither he was pursued and slain, his grey  head brought back to Antioch as a trophy.  At daylight the massacre  ceased, and the crusaders gave themselves up to plunder. They found  gold, and jewels, and silks, and velvets in abundance, but, of  provisions, which were of more importance to them, they found but  little of any kind. Corn was excessively scarce, and they discovered to  their sorrow that in this respect the besieged had been but little  better off than the besiegers.    Before they had time to instal themselves in their new position, and  take the necessary measures for procuring a supply, the city was  invested by the Turks. The Sultan of Persia had raised an immense army,  which he intrusted to the command of Kerbogha, the Emir of Mosul, with  instructions to sweep the Christian locusts from the face of the land.  The Emir effected junction with Kilij Aslaun, and the two armies  surrounded the city. Discouragement took complete possession of the  Christian host, and numbers of them contrived to elude the vigilance of  the besiegers, and escape to Count Stephen of Blots at Alexandretta, to  whom they related the most exaggerated tales of the misery they had  endured, and the utter hopelessness of continuing the war. Stephen  forthwith broke up his camp and retreated towards Constantinople. On  his way he was met by the Emperor Alexius, at the head of a  considerable force, hastening to take possession of the conquests made  by the Christians in Asia. As soon as he heard of their woeful plight,  he turned back, and proceeded with the Count of Blots to  Constantinople, leaving the remnant of the crusaders to shift for  themselves.    The news of this defection increased the discouragement at Antioch. All  the useless horses of the army had been slain and eaten, and dogs,  cats, and rats were sold at enormous prices. Even vermin were becoming  scarce. With increasing famine came a pestilence, so that in a short  time but sixty thousand remained of the three hundred thousand that had  originally invested Antioch. But this bitter extremity, while it  annihilated the energy of the host, only served to knit the leaders  more firmly together; and Bohemund, Godfrey, and Tancred swore never to  desert the cause as long as life lasted. The former strove in vain to  reanimate the courage of his followers. They were weary and sick at  heart, and his menaces and promises were alike thrown away. Some of  them had shut themselves up in the houses, and refused to come forth.  Bohemund, to drive them to their duty, set fire to the whole quarter,  and many of them perished in the flames, while the rest of the army  looked on with the utmost indifference. Bohemund, animated himself by a  worldly spirit, did not know the true character of the crusaders, nor  understand the religious madness which had brought them in such shoals  from Europe. A priest, more clear-sighted, devised a scheme which  restored all their confidence, and inspired them with a courage so  wonderful as to make the poor sixty thousand emaciated, sick, and  starving zealots, put to flight the well-fed and six times as numerous  legions of the Sultan of Persia.    This priest, a native of Provence, was named Peter Barthelemy, and  whether he were a knave or an enthusiast, or both; a principal, or a  tool in the hands of others, will ever remain a matter of doubt.  Certain it is, however, that he was the means of raising the siege of  Antioch, and causing the eventual triumph of the armies of the Cross.  When the strength of the crusaders was completely broken by their  sufferings, and hope had fled from every bosom, Peter came to Count  Raymond of Toulouse, and demanded an interview on matters of serious  moment.

CHAPTER XI    THE LITTLE GARDENERS    When little Ned Prentice put the ten-dollar bill in his mother's hand,  on that pleasant Fourth of July evening, he felt like a man. His mother  could hardly believe the story of Ned's getting the money just for  finding a balloon, but when it was explained how valuable the balloon  was, and how it sometimes takes days of searching in the woods to find  one after the balloonist lets go and drops down with his parachute, she  was finally convinced that the money rightfully belonged to Ned.    \"No one needs it more than I do,\" Mrs. Prentice told Mr. Bobbsey, who  had brought Ned home in the wagon, \"for since the baby was sick we have  hardly been able to meet our bills, it cost so much for medicine.\"    \"We were all glad when Ned got there first,\"    Harry said politely, \"because we knew he deserved the reward most.\"    As Ned was a poor boy, and had to work on farms during vacation, his  father being dead and only one brother being old enough to go to work,  the reward turned out a great blessing, for ten dollars is a good deal  of money for a little boy to earn at one time.    \"Be sure to come up to our fireworks tonight,\" Harry called, as they  drove away, and Ned promptly accepted the invitation.    \"It has certainly been a great Fourth of July!\" Uncle Daniel exclaimed,  later in the evening when the children fired off their Roman candles  and sky rockets and burned the red fire. The little children had  beautiful pinwheels and \"nigger chasers\" that they put off on the  porch. Then Nan had a big fire balloon that she sent up, and they  watched it until it was out of sight, away over the pond and clear out  of Meadow Brook.    It was a very tired lot of children that rolled off to sleep that  night, for indeed it had been a great day for them all.    For a few days after the Fourth it rained, as it always does, on  account of all the noise that goes up in the air to shake the clouds.    \"You can play in the coach house,\" Aunt Sarah told the children, \"but  be careful not to run in and out and get wet.\"  The children promised  to remember, and soon they were all out in the big wagon house playing  merrily. Freddie climbed in the wagon and made believe it was a \"big  fire engine.\" Bert attached a bell on the side for him, and when he  pulled a rope this bell would clang like a chemical apparatus. Nan and  Flossie had all their dolls in the pretty new carriage with the soft  gray cushions, and in this the little girls made believe driving to New  York and doing some wonderful shopping.    \"Freddie, you be coachman,\" coaxed Flossie, \"because we are inside and  have to have someone drive us.\"    \"But who will put out all the fires?\" Freddie asked, as he clanged the  bell vigorously.    \"Make b'lieve they are all out,\" Flossie told him.    \"But you can't make b'lieve about fires,\" argued the little fellow,  \"'cause they're really.\"    \"I tell you,\" Nan suggested. \"We will suppose this is a great big high  tally-ho party, and the ladies always drive them. I'll be away up high  on the box, but we ought to have someone blow a horn!\"    \"I'll blow the horn,\" Freddie finally gave in, \"cause I got that big  fire out now.\"    So Freddie climbed up on the high coach with his sisters, and blew the  horn until Nan told them they had reached New York and were going to  stop for dinner.    There were so many splendid things to play with in the coach house,  tables, chairs, and everything, that the Bobbseys hardly knew it before  it was lunch time, the morning passed so quickly.    It cleared up in the afternoon and John asked the children if they  wanted to help him do some transplanting.    \"Oh! we would love to,\" Nan answered, for she did love gardening.    The ground was just right for transplanting, after the rain, and the  tender little lettuce plants were as easy to take up as they were to  put down again.    \"I say, Nan,\" John told her, \"you can have that little patch over there  for your garden. I'll give you a couple of dozen plants, and we will  see what kind of a farmer you will make.\"    \"Oh, thank you, John,\" Nan answered. \"I'll do just as I have seen you  doing,\" and she began to take the little plants in the pasteboard box  from one bed to the other.    \"Be careful not to shake the dirt off the roots,\" said John, \"and be  sure to put one plant in each place. Put them as far apart here as the  length of this little stick, and when you put them in the ground press  the earth firmly around the roots.\"    Flossie was delighted to help her sister, and the two girls made a very  nice garden indeed.    \"Let's put little stones around the path,\" Flossie suggested, and John  said they could do this if they would be careful not to let the stones  get on the garden.    \"I want to be a planter too,\" called Freddie, running up the path to  John. \"But I want to plant radishes,\" he continued, \"'cause they're the  reddist.\"    \"Well, you just wait a few minutes, sonny,\" said John, \"and I'll show  you how to plant radishes. I'll be through with this lettuce in a few  minutes.\"    Freddie waited with some impatience, running first to Nan's garden then  back to John's. Finally John was ready to put in a late crop of  radishes.    \"Now, you see, we make a long drill like this,\" John explained as he  took the drill and made a furrow in the soft ground.    \"If it rains again that will be a river,\" said Freddie, for he had  often played river at home after a rain.    \"Now, you see this seed is very fine,\" continued John. \"But I am going  to let you plant it if you're careful.\"    \"That ain't redishes!\" exclaimed Freddie \"I want to plant redishes.\"    \"But this is the seed, and that's what makes the radishes,\" John  explained.    \"Nope, that's black and it can't make it red?\" argued Freddie.    \"Wait and see,\" the gardener told him. \"You just take this little paper  of seeds and scatter them in the drill. See, I have mixed them with  sand so they will not grow too thick.\"    Freddie took the small package, and kneeling down on the board that  John used, he dropped the little shower of seeds in the line.    \"They're all gone!\" he told John presently; \"get some more.\"    \"No, that's enough. Now we will see how your crop grows. See, I just  cover the seed very lightly like mamma covers Freddie when he sleeps in  the summer time.\"    \"Do you cover them more in the winter time too, like mamma does?\"  Freddie asked.    \"Yes, indeed I do,\" said the gardener, \"for seeds are just like babies,  they must be kept warm to grow.\"    Freddie stood watching the line he had planted the seed in.    \"They ain't growing yet,\" he said at last. \"Why don't they come up,  John?\"    \"Oh!\" laughed the gardener, \"they won't come up right away. They have  to wake up first. You will see them above the ground in about a week, I  guess.\"    This was rather a disappointment to the little fellow, who never  believed in waiting for anything, but he finally consented to let the  seeds grow and come back again later to pick the radishes.    \"Look at our garden!\" called Nan proudly, from across the path.  \"Doesn't it look straight and pretty?\"    \"You did very well indeed,\" said John, inspecting the new lettuce  patch. \"Now, you'll have to keep it clear of weeds, and if a dry spell  should come you must use the watering can.\"    \"I'll come up and tend to it every morning,\" Nan declared. \"I am going  to see what kind of lettuce I can raise.\"    Nan had brought with her a beautiful string of pearl beads set in gold,  the gift of one of her aunts. She was very proud of the pearls and  loved to wear them whenever her mother would let her.    One afternoon she came to her mother in bitter tears.    \"Oh, mamma!\" she sobbed. \"The the pearls are gone,\"    \"Gone! Did you lose them?\" questioned Mrs. Bobbsey quickly.    \"Yes.\"    \"Where?\"    \"I--I don't know,\" and now Nan cried harder than ever.    The news soon spread that the string of pearls were lost, and everybody  set to work hunting for them.    \"Where do you think you lost 'em?\" asked Bert.    \"I--I don't know. I was down in the garden, and up the lane, and at the  well, and out in the barn, and over to the apple orchard, and feeding  the chickens, and over in the hayfield,--and lots of places.\"    \"Then it will be like looking for a needle in a haystack,\" declared  Aunt Sarah.    All the next day the boys and girls hunted for the string of pearls,  and the older folks helped. But the string could not be found. Nan felt  very bad over her loss, and her mother could do little to console her.    \"I--I sup--suppose I'll never see them again,\" sobbed the girl.    \"Oh, I guess they'll turn up some time,\" said Bert hopefully.    \"They can't be lost so very, very bad,\" lisped Flossie. \"'Cause they  are somewhere on this farm, ain't they?\"    \"Yes, but the farm is so very big!\" sighed poor Nan.    For a few days Freddie went up to the garden every morning to look for  radishes. Then he gave up and declared he knew John had made a mistake  and that he didn't plant radishes at all. Nan and Flossie were very  faithful attending to their garden, and the beautiful light green  lettuce grew splendidly, being grateful for the good care given it.    \"When can we pick it?\" Nan asked John, as the leaves were getting quite  thick.    \"In another week!\" he told the girls, and so they continued to"]]]
