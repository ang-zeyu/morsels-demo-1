And she sat over against him, and lift up             her voice, and wept.    01:021:017 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God             called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth             thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad             where he is.    01:021:018 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will             make him a great nation.    01:021:019 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she             went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad             drink.    01:021:020 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the             wilderness, and became an archer.    01:021:021 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took             him a wife out of the land of Egypt.    01:021:022 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol             the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God             is with thee in all that thou doest:    01:021:023 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not             deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son:             but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou             shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.    01:021:024 And Abraham said, I will swear.    01:021:025 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water,             which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.    01:021:026 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing;             neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to             day.    01:021:027 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;             and both of them made a covenant.    01:021:028 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.    01:021:029 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe             lambs which thou hast set by themselves?    01:021:030 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my             hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged             this well.    01:021:031 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they             sware both of them.    01:021:032 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose             up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they             returned into the land of the Philistines.    01:021:033 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on             the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.    01:021:034 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.    01:022:001 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt             Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here             I am.    01:022:002 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou             lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him             there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I             will tell thee of.    01:022:003 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,             and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and             clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went             unto the place of which God had told him.    01:022:004 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the             place afar off.    01:022:005 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the             ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come             again to you.    01:022:006 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it             upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a             knife; and they went both of them together.    01:022:007 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father:             and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire             and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?    01:022:008 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for             a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.    01:022:009 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and             Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and             bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.    01:022:010 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to             slay his son.    01:022:011 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and             said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.    01:022:012 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou             any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God,             seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.    01:022:013 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind             him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went             and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in             the stead of his son.    01:022:014 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it             is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be             seen.    01:022:015 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven             the second time,    01:022:016 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because             thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,             thine only son:    01:022:017 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will             multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand             which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the             gate of his enemies;    01:022:018 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;             because thou hast obeyed my voice.    01:022:019 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and             went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.    01:022:020 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told             Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children             unto thy brother Nahor;    01:022:021 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father             of Aram,    01:022:022 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.    01:022:023 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to             Nahor, Abraham's brother.    01:022:024 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,             and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.    01:023:001 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these             were the years of the life of Sarah.    01:023:002 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land             of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep             for her.    01:023:003 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the             sons of Heth, saying,    01:023:004 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession             of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8003"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 3: Leviticus (#9)"],[1,"of the bird, and             with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the             cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:    03:014:053 But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the             open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall             be clean.    03:014:054 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and             scall,    03:014:055 And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,    03:014:056 And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:    03:014:057 To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the             law of leprosy.    03:015:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,    03:015:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any             man hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his             issue he is unclean.    03:015:003 And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his             flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his             issue, it is his uncleanness.    03:015:004 Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean:             and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.    03:015:005 And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and             bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.    03:015:006 And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the             issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and             be unclean until the even.    03:015:007 And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue             shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be             unclean until the even.    03:015:008 And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean;

and the priest shall make an             atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her             uncleanness.    03:015:031 Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their             uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they             defile my tabernacle that is among them.    03:015:032 This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose             seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;    03:015:033 And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath             an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth             with her that is unclean.    03:016:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons             of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;

that he die             not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.    03:016:003 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young             bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.    03:016:004 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the             linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a             linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired:             these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in             water, and so put them on.    03:016:005 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of             Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram             for a burnt offering.    03:016:006 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which             is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his             house.    03:016:007 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the             LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.    03:016:008 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the             LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.    03:016:009 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell,             and offer him for a sin offering.    03:016:010 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall             be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with             him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.    03:016:011 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which             is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and             for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering             which is for himself:    03:016:012 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from             off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet             incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail:    03:016:013 And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD,             that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is             upon the testimony, that he die not:    03:016:014 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it             with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the             mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger             seven times.    03:016:015 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for             the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with             that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and             sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:    03:016:016 And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of             the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of             their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do "]]]
