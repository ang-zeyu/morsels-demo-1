There appears to be little  doubt that the faint star, which is situated at the junction of the  bowl and the handle, is a variable of long period, since three hundred  years ago it was as bright as its companions. But however that may be,  its relative faintness at the present time interferes but little with  the perfection of the ``Dipper's'' figure. In order the more readily  to understand the changes which are taking place, it will be well to  mention both the names and the Greek letters which are attached to the  seven stars. Beginning at the star in the upper outer edge of the rim  of the bowl and running in regular order round the bottom and then out  to the end of the handle, the names and letters are as follows: Dubhe  ({\\alpha}), Merak ({\\beta}), Phaed ({\\gamma}), Megrez ({\\delta}),  Alioth ({\\epsilon}), Mizar ({\\zeta}), and Benetnasch ({\\eta}). Megrez  is the faint star already mentioned at the junction of the bowl and  handle, and Mizar, in the middle of the handle, has a close, naked-eye  companion which is named Alcor. The Arabs called this singular pair of  stars ``The Horse and Rider.'' Merak and Duhbe are called ``The  Pointers,'' because an imaginary line drawn northward through them  indicates the Pole Star.    Now it has been found that five of these stars -- viz., Merak, Phaed,  Megrez, Alioth, and Mizar (with its comrade) -- are moving with  practically the same speed in an easterly direction, while the other  two, Dubhe and Benetnasch, are simultaneously moving westward, the  motions of Benetnasch being apparently more rapid. The consequence of  these opposed motions is, of course, that the figure of the ``Dipper''  cannot always have existed and will not continue to exist. In the  accompanying diagrams it has been thought interesting to show the  relative positions of these seven stars, as seen from the point which  the earth now occupies, both in the past and in the future. Arrows  attached to the stars in the figure representing the present  appearance of the ``Dipper'' indicate the directions of the motions  and the distances over which they will carry the stars in a period of  about five hundred centuries. The time, no doubt, seems long, but  remember the vast stretch of ages through which the earth has passed,  and then reflect that no reason is apparent why our globe should not  continue to be a scene of animation for ten thousand centuries yet to  come. The fact that the little star Alcor placed so close to Mizar  should accompany the latter in its flight is not surprising, but that  two of the principal stars of the group should be found moving in a  direction directly opposed to that pursued by the other five is  surprising in the highest degree; and it recalls the strange theory of  a double drift affecting all the stars, to which attention was called  in the preceding chapter. It would appear that Benetnasch and Dubhe  belong to one ``current,'' and Merak, Phaed, Megrez, Alioth, and Mizar  to the other. As far as is known, the motion of the seven stars are  not shared by the smaller stars scattered about them, but on the  theory of currents there should be such a community of motion, and  further investigation may reveal it.    From the ``Great Dipper'' we turn to a constellation hardly less  conspicuous and situated at an equal distance from the pole on the  other side -- Cassiopeia. This famous star-group commemorating the  romantic Queen of Ethiopia whose vain boasting of her beauty was  punished by the exposure of her daughter Andromeda to the ``Sea  Monster,'' is well-marked by five stars which form an irregular letter  ``W'' with its open side toward the pole. Three of these stars are  usually ranked as of the second magnitude, and two of the third; but  to ordinary observation they appear of nearly equal brightness, and  present a very striking picture. They mark out the chair and a part of  the figure of the beautiful queen. Beginning at the right-hand, or  western, end of the ``W,'' their Greek letter designations are: Beta  ({\\beta}), Alpha ({\\alpha}), Gamma ({\\gamma}), Delta ({\\delta}), and  Epsilon ({\\epsilon}). Four of them, Beta, Alpha, Delta, and Epsilon  are traveling eastwardly at various speeds, while the fifth, Gamma,  moves in a westerly direction. The motion of Beta is more rapid than  that of any of the others. It should be said, however, that no little  uncertainty attaches to the estimates of the rate of motion of stars  which are not going very rapidly, and different observers often vary  considerably in their results.    In the beautiful ``Northern Crown,'' one of the most perfect and  charming of all the figures to be found in the stars, the alternate  combining and scattering effects of the stellar motions are shown by  comparing the appearance which the constellation must have had five  hundred centuries ago with that which it has at present and that which  it will have in the future. The seven principle stars of the asterism,  forming a surprisingly perfect coronet, have movements in three  directions at right angles to one another. That in these circumstances  they should ever have arrived at positions giving them so striking an  appearance of definite association is certainly surprising; from its  aspect one would have expected to find a community of movement  governing the brilliants of the ``Crown,'' but instead of that we find  evidence that they will inevitably drift apart and the beautiful  figure will dissolve.    A similar fate awaits such asterisms as the ``Northern Cross'' in  Cygnus; the ``Crow'' (Corvus), which stands on the back of the great  ``Sea Serpent,'' Hydra, and pecks at his scales; ``Job's Coffin''  (Delphinus); the ``Great Square of Pegasus''; the ``Twins'' (Gemini);  the beautiful ``Sickle'' in Leo; and the exquisite group of the Hyades  in Taurus. In the case of the Hyades, two controlling movements are  manifest: one, affecting five of the stars which form the well-known  figure of a letter ``V,'' is directed northerly; the other, which  controls the direction of two stars, has an easterly trend. The chief  star of the group, Aldebaran, one of the finest of all stars both for  its brilliance and its color, is the most affected by the easterly  motion. In time it will drift entirely out of connection with its  present neighbors. Although the Hyades do not form so compact a group  as the Pleiades in the same constellation, yet their appearance of  relationship is sufficient to awaken a feeling of surprise over the  fact that, as with the stars of the ``Dipper,'' their association is  only temporary or apparent.    The great figure of Orion appears to be more lasting, not because its  stars are physically connected, but because of their great distance,  which renders their movements too deliberate to be exactly  ascertained. Two of the greatest of its stars, Betelgeuse and Rigel,  possess, as far as has been ascertained, no perceptible motion across  the line of sight, but there is a little movement perceptible in the  ``Belt.'' At the present time this consists of an almost perfect  straight line, a row of second-magnitude stars about equally spaced  and of the most striking beauty. In the course of time, however, the  two right-hand stars, Mintaka and Alnilam (how fine are these Arabic  star names!) will approach each other and form a naked-eye double, but  the third, Alnita, will drift away eastward, so that the ``Belt'' will  no longer exist.    For one more example, let us go to the southern hemisphere, whose most  celebrated constellation, the ``Southern Cross,'' has found a place in  all modern literatures, although it has no claim to consideration on  account of association with ancient legends. This most attractive  asterism, which has never ceased to fascinate the imagination of  Christendom since it was first devoutly described by the early  explorers of the South, is but a passing collocation of brilliant  stars. Yet even in its transfigurations it has been for hundreds of  centuries, and will continue to be for hundreds of centuries to come,  a most striking object in the sky. Our figures show its appearance in  three successive phases: first, as it was fifty thousand years ago  (viewed from the earth's present location); second, as it is in our  day; and, third, as it will be an equal time in the future. The  nearness of these bright stars to one another -- the length of the  longer beam of the ``Cross'' is only six degrees -- makes this group  very noticeable, whatever the arrangement of its components may be.  The largest star, at the base of the ``Cross,'' is of the first  magnitude, two of the others are of the second magnitude, and the  fourth is of the third. Other stars, not represented in the figures,  increase the effect of a celestial blazonry, although they do not help  the resemblance to a cross.    But since the motion of the solar system itself will, in the course of  so long a period as fifty thousand years, produce a great change in  the perspective of the heavens as seen from the earth, by carrying us  nearly nineteen trillion miles from our present place, why, it may be  asked, seek to represent future appearances of the constellations  which we could not hope to see, even if we could survive so long? The  answer is: Because these things aid the mind to form a picture of the  effects of the mobility of the starry universe. Only by showing the  changes from some definite point of view can we arrive at a due  comprehension of them. The constellations are more or less familiar to  everybody, so that impending changes of their forms must at once  strike the eye and the imagination, and make clearer the significance  of the movements of the stars. If the future history of mankind is to  resemble its past and if our race is destined to survive yet a million  years, then our remote descendents will see a ``new heavens'' if not a  ``new earth,'' and will have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6653"],[0,"Voyages of Samuel De Champlain — Volume 01 (#9)"],[1,"desdites cotes.\"--      Extract of Commission, _Histoire de la Nouvelle-France_, par Lescarbot,      Paris, 1866, Vol. II. p. 416.          CHAPTER III.    DE MONTS LEAVES FOR LA CADIE--THE COASTS OF NOVA SCOTIA.--THE BAY OF FUNDY  --SEARCH FOR COPPER MINE--CHAMPLAIN EXPLORES THE PENOBSCOT--DE MONTS'S  ISLAND--SUFFERINGS OF THE COLONY--EXPLORATION OF THE COAST AS FAR AS  NAUSET, ON CAPE COD    De Monts, with Champlain and the other noblemen, left Havre de Grace on the  7th April, 1604, while Pont Grave, with the other vessel, followed three  days later, to rendezvous at Canseau.    Taking a more southerly course than he had originally intended, De Monts  came in sight of La Heve on the 8th of May, and on the 12th entered  Liverpool harbor, where he found Captain Rossignol, of Havre de Grace,  carrying on a contraband trade in furs with the Indians, whom he arrested,  and confiscated his vessel.    The next day they anchored at Port Mouton, where they lingered three or  four weeks, awaiting news from Pont Grave, who had in the mean time arrived  at Canseau, the rendezvous agreed upon before leaving France. Pont Grave  had there discovered several Basque ships engaged in the fur-trade. Taking  possession of them, he sent their masters to De Monts. The ships were  subsequently confiscated and sent to Rochelle.    Captain Fouques was despatched to Canseau in the vessel which had been  taken from Rossignol, to bring forward the supplies which had been brought  over by Pont Grave. Having transshipped the provisions intended for the  colony, Pont Grave proceeded through the Straits of Canseau up the St.  Lawrence, to trade with the Indians, upon the profits of which the company  relied largely for replenishing their treasury.    In the mean time Champlain was sent in a barque of eight tons, with the  secretary Sieur Ralleau, Mr. Simon, the miner, and ten men, to reconnoitre  the coast towards the west. Sailing along the shore, touching at numerous  points, doubling Cape Sable, he entered the Bay of Fundy, and after  exploring St. Mary's Bay, and discovering several mines of both silver and  iron, returned to Port Mouton and made to De Monts a minute and careful  report.    De Monts immediately weighed anchor and sailed for the Bay of St. Mary,  where he left his vessel, and, with Champlain, the miner, and some others,  proceeded to explore the Bay of Fundy. They entered and examined Annapolis  harbor, coasted along the western shores of Nova Scotia, touching at the  Bay of Mines, passing over to New Brunswick, skirting its whole  southeastern coast, entering the harbor of St. John, and finally  penetrating Passamaquoddy Bay as far as the mouth of the river St. Croix,  and fixed upon De Monts's Island [34] as the seat of their colony. The  vessel at St. Mary's with the colonists was ordered to join them, and  immediately active measures were taken for laying out gardens, erecting  dwellings and storehouses, and all the necessary preparations for the  coming winter. Champlain was commissioned to design and lay out the town,  if so it could be called.    When the work was somewhat advanced, he was sent in a barque of five or six  tons, manned with nine sailors, to search for a mine of pure copper, which  an Indian named Messamoueet had assured them he could point out to them on  the coast towards the river St. John. Some twenty-five miles from the river  St. Croix, they found a mine yielding eighteen per cent, as estimated by  the miner; but they did not discover any pure copper, as they had hoped.    On the last day of August, 1604, the vessel which had brought out the  colony, together with that which had been taken from Rossignol, took their  departure for the shores of France. In it sailed Poutrincourt, Ralleau the  secretary of De Monts, and Captain Rossignol.    From the moment of his arrival on the coast of America, Champlain employed  his leisure hours in making sketches and drawings of the most important  rivers, harbors, and Indian settlements which they had visited.    While the little colony at De Monts's Island was active in getting its  appointments arranged and settled, De Monts wisely determined, though he  could not accompany it himself, nevertheless to send out an expedition  during the mild days of autumn, to explore the region still further to the  south, then called by the Indians Norumbegue. Greatly to the satisfaction  of Champlain, he was personally charged, with this important expedition. He  set out on the 2d of September, in a barque of seventeen or eighteen tons,  with twelve sailors and two Indian guides. The inevitable fogs of that  region detained them nearly a fortnight before they were able to leave the  banks of Passamaquoddy. Passing along the rugged shores of Maine, with its  endless chain of islands rising one after another into view, which they  called the Ranges, they at length came to the ancient Pemetiq, lying close  in to the shore, having the appearance at sea of seven or eight mountains  drawn together and springing from the same base. This Champlain named  _Monts Deserts_, which we have anglicized into Mount Desert, [35] an  appellation which has survived the vicissitudes of two hundred and  seventy-five years, and now that the island, with its salubrious air and  cool shades, its bold and picturesque scenery, is attracting thousands from  the great cities during the heats of summer, the name is likely to abide  far down into a distant and indefinite future.    Leaving Mount Desert, winding their way among numerous islands, taking a  northerly direction, they soon entered the Penobscot, [36] known by the  early navigators as the river Norumbegue. They proceeded up the river as  far as the mouth of an affluent now known as the Kenduskeag, [37] which was  then called, or rather the place where it made a junction with the  Penobscot was called by the natives, _Kadesquit_, situated at the head of  tide-water, near the present site of the city of Bangor. The falls above  the city intercepted their further progress. The river-banks about the  harbor were fringed with a luxurious growth of forest trees. On one side,  lofty pines reared their gray trunks, forming a natural palisade along the  shore. On the other, massive oaks alone were to be seen, lifting their  sturdy branches to the skies, gathered into clumps or stretching out into  long lines, as if a landscape gardener had planted them to please the eye  and gratify the taste. An exploration revealed the whole surrounding region  clothed in a similar wild and primitive beauty.    After a leisurely survey of the country, they returned to the mouth of the  river. Contrary to what might have been expected, Champlain found scarcely  any inhabitants dwelling on the borders of the Penobscot. Here and there  they saw a few deserted wigwams, which were the only marks of human  occupation. At the mouth of the river, on the borders of Penobscot Bay, the  native inhabitants were numerous. They were of a friendly disposition, and  gave their visitors a cordial welcome, readily entered into negotiations  for the sale of beaver-skins, and the two parties mutually agreed to  maintain a friendly intercourse in the future.    Having obtained from the Indians some valuable information as to the source  of the Penobscot, and observed their mode of life, which did not differ  from that which they had seen still further east, Champlain departed on the  20th of September, directing his course towards the Kennebec. But,  encountering bad weather, he found it necessary to take shelter under the  lee of the island of Monhegan.    After sailing three or four leagues farther, finding that his provisions  would not warrant the continuance of the voyage, he determined, on the 23d  of September, to return to the settlement at Saint Croix, or what is now  known as De Monts's Island, where they arrived on the 2d day of October,  1604.    De Monts's Island, having an area of not more than six or seven acres, is  situated in the river Saint Croix, midway between its opposite shores,  directly upon the dividing line between the townships of Calais and  Robinston in the State of Maine. At the northern end of the island, the  buildings of the settlement were clustered together in the form of a  quadrangle with an open court in the centre. First came the magazine and  lodgings of the soldiers, then the mansion of the governor, De Monts,  surmounted by the colors of France. Houses for Champlain and the other  gentlemen, [38] for the cure, the artisans and workmen, filled up and  completed the quadrangle. Below the houses, gardens were laid out for the  several gentlemen, and at the southern extremity of the island cannon were  mounted for protection against a sudden assault.    In the ample forests of Maine or New Brunswick, rich in oak and maple and  pine, abounding in deer, partridge, and other wild game, watered by crystal  fountains springing from every acre of the soil, we naturally picture for  our colonists a winter of robust health, physical comfort, and social  enjoyment. The little island which they had chosen was indeed a charming  spot in a summer's day, but we can hardly comprehend in what view it could  have been regarded as suitable for a colonial plantation. In space it was  wholly inadequate; it was destitute of wood and fresh water, and its soil  was sandy and unproductive. In fixing the location of their settlement and  in the construction of their houses, it is obvious that they had entirely  misapprehended the character of the climate. While the latitude was nearly  the same, the temperature was far more rigorous than that of the sunny  France which they had left. The snow began to fall on the 6th of October.  On the 3d of December the ice was seen floating on the surface of the  water. As the season advanced, and the tide came and went, huge floes of  ice, day after day, swept by the island, rendering it impracticable to  navigate the"]]]
