However, I'll go and interrogate    her, and, in the meantime, may I suggest the absolute propriety    of your regarding yourselves as single young ladies.  Good    evening!                                                         (Exit Don    Alhambra.)         GIA.  Well, here's a pleasant state of things!         MAR.  Delightful.  One of us is married to two young ladies,    and nobody knows which; and the other is married to one young    lady whom nobody can identify!         GIA.  And one of us is married to one of you, and the other    is married to nobody.         TESS.  But which of you is married to which of us, and    what's to become of the other?  (About to cry.)         GIU.  It's quite simple.  Observe.  Two husbands have    managed to acquire three wives.  Three wivestwo husbands.    (Reckoning up.)  That's two-thirds of a husband to each wife.         TESS.  O Mount Vesuvius, here we are in arithmetic!  My good    sir, one can't marry a vulgar fraction!         GIU.  You've no right to call me a vulgar fraction.         MAR.  We are getting rather mixed.  The situation is    entangled.  Let's try and comb it out.                 QUARTETMARCO, GIUSEPPE, GIANETTA, TESSA.                     In a contemplative fashion,                        And a tranquil frame of mind,                   Free from every kind of passion,                        Some solution let us find.                   Let us grasp the situation,                        Solve the complicated plot                   Quiet, calm deliberation                        Disentangles every knot.      TESS.I, no doubt, Giuseppe wedded          THE OTHERS.    In a    contemplative              That's, of course, a slice of luck           fashion,    etc.         He is rather dunder-headed.              Still distinctly, he's a duck.      GIA. I, a victim, too, of Cupid,             THE OTHERS.    Let    us grasp the              Marco married - that is clear.               situation,    etc.         He's particularly stupid,              Still distinctly, he's a dear.      MAR. To Gianetta I was mated;           THE OTHERS.    In a    contemplative              I can prove it in a trice:                   fashion,    etc.         Though her charms are overrated,              Still I own she's rather nice.      GIU. I to Tessa, willy-nilly,           THE OTHERS.    Let us    grasp the              All at once a victim fell.                   situation,    etc.         She is what is called a silly,              Still she answers pretty well.      MAR.           Now when we were pretty babies                        Some one married us, that's clear      GIA.                     And if I can catch her                             I'll pinch her and scratch her                        And send her away with a flea in her ear.      GIU.           He whom that young lady married,                        To receive her can't refuse.      TESS.                    If I overtake her                             I'll warrant I'll make her                        To shake in her aristocratical shoes!      GIA. (to Tess.).    If she married your Giuseppe                        You and he will have to part      TESS. (to Gia.).    If I have to do it                        I'll warrant she'll rue it                   I'll teach her to marry the man of my heart!      TESS. (to Gia.).    If she married Messer Marco                        You're a spinster, that is plain      GIA. (to Tess.).    No matterno matter.                        If I can get at her                   I doubt if her mother will know her again!      ALL.      Quiet, calm deliberation                   Disentangles every knot!                                                           (Exeunt,    pondering.)      (March.  Enter procession of Retainers, heralding approach of    Duke, Duchess, and Casilda.  All three are now dressed with the    utmost magnificence.)                  CHORUS OF MEN, with DUKE and DUCHESS.                     With ducal pomp and ducal pride                        (Announce these comers,                        O ye kettle-drummers!)                   Comes Barataria's high-born bride.                        (Ye sounding cymbals clang!)                   She comes to claim the Royal hand                        (Proclaim their Graces,                        O ye double basses!)                   Of the King who rules this goodly land.                        (Ye brazen brasses bang!)      DUKE and       This polite attention touches    DUCH.          Heart of Duke and heart of Duchess                        Who resign their pet                        With profound regret.                   She of beauty was a model                   When a tiny tiddle-toddle,                        And at twenty-one                        She's excelled by none!      CHORUS.        With ducal pomp and ducal pride, etc.      DUKE (to his attendants).  Be good enough to inform His Majesty    that His Grace the Duke of Plaza-Toro, Limited, has arrived, and    begs         CAS.  Desires         DUCH.  Demands         DUKE.  And demands an audience.  (Exeunt attendants.)  And    now, my child, prepare to receive the husband to whom you were    united under such interesting and romantic circumstances.         CAS.  But which is it?  There are two of them!         DUKE.  It is true that at present His Majesty is a double    gentleman; but as soon as the circumstances of his marriage are    ascertained, he will, ipso facto, boil down to a single    gentlemanthus presenting a unique example of an individual who    becomes a single man and a married man by the same operation.         DUCH. (severely).  I have known instances in which the    characteristics of both conditions existed concurrently in the    same individual.         DUKE.  Ah, he couldn't have been a Plaza-Toro.         DUCH.  Oh! couldn't he, though!         CAS.  Well, whatever happens, I shall, of course, be a    dutiful wife, but I can never love my husband.         DUKE.  I don't know.  It's extraordinary what    unprepossessing people one can love if one gives one's mind to    it.         DUCH.  I loved your father.         DUKE.  My lovethat remark is a little hard, I think?    Rather cruel, perhaps?  Somewhat uncalled-for, I venture to    believe?         DUCH.  It was very difficult, my dear; but I said to myself,    \"That man is a Duke, and I will love him.\"  Several of my    relations bet me I couldn't, but I diddesperately!                               SONGDUCHESS.                     On the day when I was wedded                        To your admirable sire,                   I acknowledge that I dreaded                        An explosion of his ire.                   I was overcome with panic                   For his temper was volcanic,                        And I didn't dare revolt,                        For I feared a thunderbolt!                   I was always very wary,                        For his fury was ecstatic                   His refined vocabulary                        Most unpleasantly emphatic.                             To the thunder                                  Of this Tartar                             I knocked under                                  Like a martyr;                             When intently                                  He was fuming,                             I was gently                                  Unassuming                             When reviling                                  Me completely,                             I was smiling                                  Very sweetly:    Giving him the very best, and getting back the very worst    That is how I tried to tame your great progenitorat first!                   But I found that a reliance                        On my threatening appearance,                   And a resolute defiance                        Of marital interference,                   And a gentle intimation                   Of my firm determination                        To see what I could do                        To be wife and husband too                   Was the only thing required                        For to make his temper supple,                   And you couldn't have desired                        A more reciprocating couple.                             Ever willing                                  To be wooing,                             We were billing                                  We were cooing;                             When I merely                                  From him parted,                             We were nearly                                  Broken-hearted                             When in sequel                                  Reunited,                             We were equal-                                  Ly delighted.    So with double-shotted guns and colours nailed unto the mast,    I tamed your insignificant progenitorat last!           CAS.  My only hope is that when my husband sees what a shady    family he has married into he will repudiate the contract    altogether.         DUKE.  Shady?  A nobleman shady, who is blazing in the    lustre of unaccustomed pocket-money?  A nobleman shady, who can    look back upon ninety-five quarterings?  It is not every nobleman    who is ninety-five quarters in arrearI mean, who can look back    upon ninety-five of them!  And this, just as I have been floated    at a premium!  Oh fie!         DUCH.  Your Majesty is surely unaware that directly your    Majesty's father came before the public he was applied for over    and over again.         DUKE.  My dear, Her Majesty's father was in the habit of    being applied for over and over againand very urgently applied    for, toolong before he was registered under the Limited    Liability Act."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8102"],[0,"The Forme of Cury: A Roll of Ancient English Cookery Compiled, about A.D. 1390 (#9)"],[1,"be not half y nouhz and  hewe hem to gobettes and cast hem in a pot, do þerto clene broth,  seeþ hem þat þey be tendre. take brede and þe self broth and drawe it  up yferer [2], take strong Powdour and Safroun and Salt and cast þer  to. take ayrenn and seeþ hem harde. take out the zolkes and hewe the  whyte þerinne, take the Pot fro þe fyre and cast the whyte þerinne.  messe the disshes þerwith and lay the zolkes hool and flour it with  clowes.
