The Statutes fair, however, came in November, at Bestwood. It happened  that Annie had the Monday night off. It was a drizzling ugly night, yet  she dressed herself up and went to the fair ground. She was alone, but  she expected soon to find a pal of some sort.    The roundabouts were veering round and grinding out their music, the side  shows were making as much commotion as possible. In the coco-nut shies  there were no coco-nuts, but artificial war-time substitutes, which the  lads declared were fastened into the irons. There was a sad decline in  brilliance and luxury. None the less, the ground was muddy as ever, there  was the same crush, the press of faces lighted up by the flares and the  electric lights, the same smell of naphtha and a few fried potatoes, and  of electricity.    Who should be the first to greet Miss Annie on the showground but John  Thomas? He had a black overcoat buttoned up to his chin, and a tweed cap  pulled down over his brows, his face between was ruddy and smiling and  handy as ever. She knew so well the way his mouth moved.    She was very glad to have a 'boy'. To be at the Statutes without a fellow  was no fun. Instantly, like the gallant he was, he took her on the  dragons, grim-toothed, round-about switchbacks. It was not nearly so  exciting as a tram-car actually. But, then, to be seated in a shaking,  green dragon, uplifted above the sea of bubble faces, careering in a  rickety fashion in the lower heavens, whilst John Thomas leaned over her,  his cigarette in his mouth, was after all the right style. She was a  plump, quick, alive little creature. So she was quite excited and happy.    John Thomas made her stay on for the next round. And therefore she could  hardly for shame repulse him when he put his arm round her and drew her a  little nearer to him, in a very warm and cuddly manner. Besides, he was  fairly discreet, he kept his movement as hidden as possible. She looked  down, and saw that his red, clean hand was out of sight of the crowd. And  they knew each other so well. So they warmed up to the fair.    After the dragons they went on the horses. John Thomas paid each time, so  she could but be complaisant. He, of course, sat astride on the outer  horse--named 'Black Bess'--and she sat sideways, towards him, on the  inner horse--named 'Wildfire'. But of course John Thomas was not going to  sit discreetly on 'Black Bess', holding the brass bar. Round they spun  and heaved, in the light. And round he swung on his wooden steed,  flinging one leg across her mount, and perilously tipping up and down,  across the space, half lying back, laughing at her. He was perfectly  happy; she was afraid her hat was on one side, but she was excited.    He threw quoits on a table, and won for her two large, pale-blue  hat-pins. And then, hearing the noise of the cinemas, announcing another  performance, they climbed the boards and went in.    Of course, during these performances pitch darkness falls from time to  time, when the machine goes wrong. Then there is a wild whooping, and a  loud smacking of simulated kisses. In these moments John Thomas drew  Annie towards him. After all, he had a wonderfully warm, cosy way of  holding a girl with his arm, he seemed to make such a nice fit. And,  after all, it was pleasant to be so held: so very comforting and cosy and  nice. He leaned over her and she felt his breath on her hair; she knew he  wanted to kiss her on the lips. And, after all, he was so warm and she  fitted in to him so softly. After all, she wanted him to touch her lips.    But the light sprang up; she also started electrically, and put her hat  straight. He left his arm lying nonchalantly behind her. Well, it was  fun, it was exciting to be at the Statutes with John Thomas.    When the cinema was over they went for a walk across the dark, damp  fields. He had all the arts of love-making. He was especially good at  holding a girl, when he sat with her on a stile in the black, drizzling  darkness. He seemed to be holding her in space, against his own warmth  and gratification. And his kisses were soft and slow and searching.    So Annie walked out with John Thomas, though she kept her own boy  dangling in the distance. Some of the tram-girls chose to be huffy. But  there, you must take things as you find them, in this life.    There was no mistake about it, Annie liked John Thomas a good deal. She  felt so rich and warm in herself whenever he was near. And John Thomas  really liked Annie, more than usual. The soft, melting way in which she  could flow into a fellow, as if she melted into his very bones, was  something rare and good. He fully appreciated this.    But with a developing acquaintance there began a developing intimacy.  Annie wanted to consider him a person, a man; she wanted to take an  intelligent interest in him, and to have an intelligent response. She did  not want a mere nocturnal presence, which was what he was so far. And she  prided herself that he could not leave her.    Here she made a mistake. John Thomas intended to remain a nocturnal  presence; he had no idea of becoming an all-round individual to her. When  she started to take an intelligent interest in him and his life and his  character, he sheered off. He hated intelligent interest. And he knew  that the only way to stop it was to avoid it. The possessive female was  aroused in Annie. So he left her.    It is no use saying she was not surprised. She was at first startled,  thrown out of her count. For she had been so _very_ sure of holding him.  For a while she was staggered, and everything became uncertain to her.  Then she wept with fury, indignation, desolation, and misery. Then she  had a spasm of despair. And then, when he came, still impudently, on to  her car, still familiar, but letting her see by the movement of his head  that he had gone away to somebody else for the time being, and was  enjoying pastures new, then she determined to have her own back.    She had a very shrewd idea what girls John Thomas had taken out. She went  to Nora Purdy. Nora was a tall, rather pale, but well-built girl, with  beautiful yellow hair. She was rather secretive.    'Hey!' said Annie, accosting her; then softly, 'Who's John Thomas on with  now?'    'I don't know,' said Nora.    'Why tha does,' said Annie, ironically lapsing into dialect. 'Tha knows  as well as I do.'    'Well, I do, then,' said Nora. 'It isn't me, so don't bother.'    'It's Cissy Meakin, isn't it?'    'It is, for all I know.'    'Hasn't he got a face on him!' said Annie. 'I don't half like his cheek.  I could knock him off the foot-board when he comes round at me.'    'He'll get dropped-on one of these days,' said Nora.    'Ay, he will, when somebody makes up their mind to drop it on him. I  should like to see him taken down a peg or two, shouldn't you?'    'I shouldn't mind,' said Nora.    'You've got quite as much cause to as I have,' said Annie. 'But we'll  drop on him one of these days, my girl. What? Don't you want to?'    'I don't mind,' said Nora.    But as a matter of fact, Nora was much more vindictive than Annie.    One by one Annie went the round of the old flames. It so happened that  Cissy Meakin left the tramway service in quite a short time. Her mother  made her leave. Then John Thomas was on the _qui-vive_. He cast his eyes  over his old flock. And his eyes lighted on Annie. He thought she would  be safe now. Besides, he liked her.    She arranged to walk home with him on Sunday night. It so happened that  her car would be in the depot at half past nine: the last car would come  in at 10.15. So John Thomas was to wait for her there.    At the depot the girls had a little waiting-room of their own. It was  quite rough, but cosy, with a fire and an oven and a mirror, and table  and wooden chairs. The half dozen girls who knew John Thomas only too  well had arranged to take service this Sunday afternoon. So, as the cars  began to come in, early, the girls dropped into the waiting-room. And  instead of hurrying off home, they sat around the fire and had a cup of  tea. Outside was the darkness and lawlessness of wartime.    John Thomas came on the car after Annie, at about a quarter to ten. He  poked his head easily into the girls' waiting-room.    'Prayer-meeting?' he asked.    'Ay,' said Laura Sharp. 'Ladies only.'    'That's me!' said John Thomas. It was one of his favourite exclamations.    'Shut the door, boy,' said Muriel Baggaley.    'On which side of me?' said John Thomas.    'Which tha likes,' said Polly Birkin.    He had come in and closed the door behind him. The girls moved in their  circle, to make a place for him near the fire. He took off his great-coat  and pushed back his hat.    'Who handles the teapot?' he said.    Nora Purdy silently poured him out a cup of tea.    'Want a bit o' my bread and drippin'?' said Muriel Baggaley to him.    'Ay, give us a bit.'    And he began to eat his piece of bread.    'There's no place like home, girls,' he said.    They all looked at him as he uttered this piece of impudence. He seemed  to be sunning himself in the presence of so many damsels.    'Especially if you're not afraid to go home in the dark,' said Laura  Sharp.    'Me! By myself I am.'    They sat till they heard the last tram come in. In a few minutes Emma  Houselay entered.    'Come on, my old duck!' cried Polly Birkin.    'It _is_ perishing,' said Emma, holding her fingers to the fire.    'But--I'm afraid to, go home in, the dark,' sang Laura Sharp, the tune  having got into her mind.    'Who're you going with tonight, John Thomas?' asked Muriel Baggaley,  coolly.    'Tonight?' said John Thomas. 'Oh, I'm going home by myself tonight--all  on my lonely-O.'    'That's me!' said Nora Purdy, using his own ejaculation.    The girls laughed shrilly.    'Me as well, Nora,' said John Thomas.

The claim is  for the \"cylindrical rubber eraser provided with a wrapper or case, as  herein shown and described\"    In the body of the specification the applicant describes the mode of  making the eraser, and he also enumerates its advantages over erasers of  the ordinary forms.    The Examiner does not object to the application because of the utility  of the eraser, although the Board of Examiners in Chief seem to base  their decision upon that point alone, but he pronounces the form already  old in its application to artists' stumps, and he insists that the mode  of composition or construction can form no element, for the claim for a  design patent.    In the latter statement he is undoubtedly right. These patents are  granted solely for new shapes or forms, and the form being new it is  immaterial by what process that form is attained. The composition of  matter or the mode of construction is neither \"design,\" \"shape,\" nor  \"configuration,\" and must be protected, if at all, under a patent of  another kind. I cannot say that the presence of such matter in the  specification would be objectionable if description merely, but it could  in no way be allowed to enter into, or to modify the claim.    As to the first ground of rejection, I think the Examiner is in error.  This purports to be a new form or shape of a distinct article of  manufacture, to wit: rubber erasers. If it be new, as thus applied, it  is immaterial whether pencils, or stumps, or pen holders, or anything  else may or may not have been made cylindrical. If they are not  substantially the same article of manufacture as erasers, the old form  applied to this new article is unquestionably entitled to protection.    The applicant has not defined his invention with entire accuracy. He  should strike from his claim the words \"provided with a wrapper or  case,\" as those relate to construction and not configuration, and he  should insert the words \"having the ends beveled to an edge\" in lieu  of the phrase erased, or he should adopt the usual form of claim for  designs, viz: \"The design for a rubber eraser, as shown and described.\"    As the claim stands, it ought not to be allowed, and the decision must  be affirmed, but the applicant will be allowed to amend as suggested.

A comprehensive description of this excellent machine was given upon  page 230, Vol. XVIII., of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN. We now present our  readers with an engraving of it and a summary of its important features,  which doubtless render it equal if not superior to any machine of the  kind in market. The frame in which the feed rollers are arranged is so  hung to the frame-work of the molding machine, that it can be raised or  lowered at pleasure, in order to properly adjust the feed rollers for  action upon the \"stuff,\" and it is also so constructed as to permit the  feed rollers to yield in case of variations in the thickness of the  \"stuff\" passing under them. The spindle of the side cutter-heads is hung  in a vertical frame arranged to be moved up and down, and laterally, to  adjust the cutter-head for action, and is provided at its upper end with  a box or bearing, whereby the bearing of the box is always kept upon the  spindle instead of at different points of the same as in other machines,  and this without interfering with the adjustability of the side  cutter-head. Thus uneven wear is avoided.    [Illustration: RUSS' MONITOR MOLDING MACHINE.]    The bed of the machine is formed with a series of slots or openings  provided with bridge bars so that the cutters may act upon the edges of  the stuff without danger of injury from striking the bed. The presser  shoe is also made adjustable for different thicknesses of the \"stuff\"  and self-yielding to variations in thickness, by a peculiar method of  hanging the bar, which carries the presser shoe, to the framework of the  machine.    The clamp which holds the press block which acts upon the \"stuff\" after  it has passed through the cutter, is of novel construction, and the  spindle of the side cutter-heads is so arranged in connection with a  loose pulley and the pulley-drums, that both cutter-heads are driven by  one belt and in the same direction.    The bed plate is provided with springs through which the side  cutter-heads are arranged, to move laterally or transversely with a  bridge-plate or plates, susceptible of adjustment independent of the  cutter-heads, whereby an adjustable support to the \"stuff\" is given as  it passes over the line of the openings in the bed.    Most machines have weighted pressure feed, but this having steel springs  adjustable by a screw and hand wheel, a heavy or light pressure can be  applied according to the work done or size of molding. The cutter-heads  are square and slotted so that any style of molding can be stuck by  putting cutters on all sides of the head, thus equalizing the cost and  lessening the power. The pressure shoe is arranged to hold the \"stuff\"  at the very point of contact with the cutters, and, as we have shown, is  readily adjusted to a long or short cutter, so that a small molding can  be made as smooth as a large one, and so as not to require any finishing  with sandpaper or a hand tool.    The machine has also a bevel track very useful for picture frame  molding, and a patent cap of great value for the cutters, and readily  applied to any slotted head or common head. The wrenches that go with  the machine, and the common malleable iron caps for the top cylinder,  are shown in detail. These machines are now running in Worcester,  Boston, and Fitchburg, Mass.; Chicago, Ill.: Philadelphia, Pa.;  Brattleboro, Vt.; Whitesboro, N. Y.; Charleston, S. C., and other  places, and, it is claimed, are capable of doing better work and more of  it than any machine now in use.    This machine is covered by several patents taken through the Scientific  American Patent Agency. It is manufactured by R. Ball & Co., of  Worcester, Mass, to whom write for further information.           *       *       *       *       *          A Lost Civilization.      At the last regular meeting of the American Geographical and Statistical  Society at its rooms in the Cooper Institute, Professor Newberry,  of Columbia College, delivered an address on the subject of his  explorations in Utah and Arizona Territories. The speaker commenced  by giving a short history of the circumstances under which the two  government expeditions to which he was attached were organized. He then  confined his remarks to the subject of the latter expedition, no account  of which has yet been published. Its aim was principally to explore the  region embraced by what is known as the old Spanish trail from Santa Fe  to California. After giving an interesting account of the topography of  the region traversed, he proceeded to speak of the traces which were  found on every hand of a former occupancy by a numerous population now  extinct. These were most numerous near the course of the San Juan river.  There were found ruins of immense structures, a view of one of which he  exhibited, built regularly of bricks, a foot in thickness, and about  eighteen inches in length, with the joints properly broken, and as  regularly laid and as smooth as any in a Fifth Avenue mansion. This  structure he said was as large as the Croton reservoir. Inside were  rooms nicely plastered as the walls of a modern house. There were also  traces of extensive canals, which had been constructed to bring water to  these towns, which were received into large cisterns. The lecturer also  exhibited pieces of pottery which he said abounded everywhere, showing  that in a former age all this vast region had been inhabited. He gave it  as his opinion that the depopulation of this region was attributable to  the fact that both to the north and the south were warlike hordes, and  from the incursions of one and the other of these, the peaceable Aztecs,  who had been the former denizens of the country, had been gradually  wiped out. The only people left here now were the Mokies, who lived  in towns inclosed within high, thick walls, and who were almost  inaccessible. These people were visited, and the explorers were received  by them with great hospitality. The speaker concluded by giving a"]]]
