Socialists, Agrarians and Democratic Nationalists (_bourgeoisie_), all of  whom will stand behind the programme of full Czecho-Slovak independence.    The most significant demonstration of the Czech national sentiment took  place at Prague on January 6, 1918, at a meeting of all the Czech deputies  of the Reichsrat and of the diets of Bohemia, Moravia and Austrian Silesia,  with which we deal in another chapter, and at which a resolution was  unanimously carried demanding full independence and representation at the  peace conference.    Finally, on July 13, 1918, a National Council or Committee was formed in  Prague on which all the parties are represented and which may rightly be  described as part of the Provisional Government of Bohemia.    The whole Czech nation to-day is unanimously awaiting the victory of the  Entente, from which it expects its long-cherished independence. The  Czecho-Slovaks are only waiting for a favorable opportunity to strike the  death-blow at the Dual Monarchy.        IV    TERRORISM IN BOHEMIA DURING THE WAR    Austria-Hungary declared war not only on her enemies outside her frontiers,  but also on her internal enemies, on her own Slav and Latin subjects. From  the very first day of war terrorism reigned supreme in Bohemia, where the  Austrian Government behaved as in an enemy country. Three political parties  (the National Socialist, Radical and Realist Parties) were dissolved and  their organs suppressed. Fully three-quarters of all Czech journals and all  Slovak journals were suspended. Political leaders were arrested,  imprisoned, and some of them even sentenced to death. Many leaders have  been imprisoned as hostages in case an insurrection should break out. Over  20,000 Czech civilians have been interned merely for being \"politically  suspect,\" and about 5000 were hanged in an arbitrary way by military  tribunals, since juries had been abolished by an imperial decree. Other  Slav districts were no better off: the Polish Socialist deputy Daszynski  stated in the Reichsrat that 30,000 persons were hanged in Galicia alone,  and another deputy stated that the number of Slavs (Austrian subjects) who  were executed by Austria exceeded 80,000. Czech troops were marched to the  trains watched by German soldiers like prisoners of war. Thousands of them  were massacred at the front. The property of those who surrendered was  confiscated, while the families of those Czech leaders who escaped abroad  were brutally persecuted. It is impossible for us to give a detailed  description of all the persecutions committed by Austria on the  Czecho-Slovaks, but the following is a brief summary of them:--    _(a) Czech Deputies and Leaders imprisoned and sentenced to Death_    The most important perhaps was _the case of Dr. Kramar,_ one of the most  moderate of the Czech leaders. Dr. Kramar was arrested on May 21, 1915, on  a charge of high treason as the leader of the Young Czechs; together with  him were also arrested his colleague, deputy Dr. Rasin, Mr. Cervinka, an  editor of the _Narodni Listy_, and Zamazal, an accountant. On June 3, 1916,  all four of them were sentenced to death, although no substantial proofs  were produced against them. Subsequently, however, the sentence was  commuted to long terms of imprisonment, but after the general amnesty of  July, 1917, they were released. Among the reasons for which they were  imprisoned and sentenced to death were the following, as given in the  official announcement, published in the Austrian press on January 4, 1917:    Dr. Kramar before the war was \"the leader of Pan-Slav propaganda and of the  Russophil movement in Bohemia.\" He was also alleged to have kept up a  connection with the pro-Ally propaganda conducted by the Czecho-Slovaks and  their friends abroad during the war, and the Czech military action against  Austria on the side of the Entente. Dr. Kramar was further blamed for the  \"treasonable\" behaviour of Czech regiments who voluntarily surrendered to  Russia and Serbia, and for the anti-German sentiments cherished by the  Czecho-Slovaks for centuries past. Obviously in striking Dr. Kramar Austria  meant to strike at the Czech nation. The \"proofs\" for the high treasonable  activity of Dr. Kramar before and during the war were the following:[1]    (1) Dr. Kramar was (before the war) in communication with Brancianov,  Bobrinski, Denis, Masaryk, Pavlu and others, who now preach the  dismemberment of Austria-Hungary.    (2) In his articles in the _Narodni Listy_, published during the war, Dr.  Kramar advocated the liberation of small nations as proclaimed by the  Entente. His organ, \"the _Narodni Listy_, laid special stress on news  favourable to our enemies and on the state of disruption of Austria, and  indirectly invited Czechs to passive resistance.\"    (3) A copy of _La Nation Tcheque_ was found in Dr. Kramar's pocket at the  time of his arrest.    (4) Dr. Kramar had a conversation with the Italian consul in April, 1915,  which is \"an important cause of suspicion.\"    (5) In a letter to the Governor of Bohemia, Prince Thun, Dr. Kramar  admitted that, always faithful to his political principles, he refrained  from everything that might appear as approval of the war.    This was the evidence brought up against Kramar, on the ground of which he  was to be hanged. These are the \"proofs\" of his responsibility for the  distribution of treasonable Russian proclamations in Bohemia, repeated  manifestations of sympathy with the enemy, and the refusal of Czech  deputies to take part in any declarations or manifestations of loyalty.    Equally characteristic is also _the case of the National Socialist leader,  deputy Klofac_, who was arrested in September, 1914. Owing to lack of  proofs the trial was repeatedly postponed, while Klofac was left in prison.  A formal charge was brought against him only when the Reichsrat was about  to open in May, 1917, so as to prevent him from attending the meeting.  Nevertheless he was released after the amnesty of July, 1917. Writing in  the _Narodni Politika_ about his experience in prison, deputy Klofac says:        \"Many educated and aged political prisoners were not allowed out to      walk in the yard for five months or more, which is contrary to all      regulations. They were also not allowed to read books given to them by      the judge, and they had to do the lowest work. One student who refused      to wash the floor was beaten and confined to a dark cell. No wonder      that many committed suicide. Dr. Vrbensky could tell how he used to get      excited by the cry of the ill-treated prisoners. Even his nerves could      not stand it. It is quite comprehensible, therefore, that Dr. Scheiner      (the president of the 'Sokol' Union) in such an atmosphere was      physically and mentally broken down in two months. Dr. Kramar and Dr.      Rasin also had an opportunity of feeling the brutality of Polatchek and      Teszinski. In the winter we suffered from frosts, for there was no      heating. Some of my friends had frozen hands. We resisted the cold by      drilling according to the Mueller system. This kept us fit and saved us      from going to the prison doctor, Dr. A. Prinz, who was a Magyar and      formerly a doctor in Karlsbad. If a prisoner went to this 'gentleman,'      he did not ask after his illness, but after his nationality, and for      the reason of his remand imprisonment. On hearing that a prisoner was      Czech and on remand for Par. 58_c_ (high treason), he only hissed: 'You      do not want any medicine. It would be wasted, for in any case you will      be hanged.'\"    Besides Klofac, the following four National Socialist deputies were also  imprisoned: Choc, Burival, Vojna and Netolicky. The accused were condemned  on July 30, 1916, for \"failing to denounce Professor Masaryk's  revolutionary propaganda.\"    _Professor Masaryk_, who escaped abroad in 1915, was sentenced to death in  Austria in December, 1916. Unable to reach him, the Austrian Government  revenged themselves on his daughter, Dr. Alice Masaryk, whom they  imprisoned. Only after an energetic press campaign abroad was she released.  A similar fate also met the wife of another Czech leader, Dr. Benes, who  escaped abroad in the autumn of 1915 and became secretary general of the  Czecho-Slovak National Council.    _Dr. Scheiner_, president of the \"Sokol\" Gymnastic Association, was  imprisoned, but was again released owing to lack of proofs. A similar fate  also met the Czech Social Democratic leader _Dr. Soukup_, who was for some  time kept in prison.    _(b) Monster Trials, Arbitrary Executions, Internment of Civilians, etc_.    A notorious reason for imprisonment, and even execution, was the possession  of the so-called Russian Manifesto dropped by Russian aeroplanes, being a  proclamation of the Tsar to the people of Bohemia promising them the  restoration of their independence. Mr. Matejovsky, of the Prague City  Council, and fifteen municipal clerks were sentenced to many years'  imprisonment for this offence in February, 1915. In May, 1915, six persons,  among them two girls, were condemned to death in Kyjov, Moravia, for the  same offence. On the same charge also sixty-nine other persons from Moravia  were brought to Vienna and fifteen of them sentenced to death. One of the  Czech girls who were executed for this offence was a Miss Kotikova, aged  twenty-one, who, according to the _Arbeiter Zeitung_ of September 8, 1917,  refused to say from whom she had received the manifesto, and through her  heroic attitude saved the lives of others.    Without a fair trial and without evidence, the editor of the National  Socialist organ _Pokrok_ in Prostejov, Mr. Joseph Kotek, was sentenced to  death on Christmas Eve of 1914. The sentence was passed at noon, confirmed  at half-past four and carried out at half-past six. As no one could be  found to act as hangman, Kotek was shot."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9662"],[0,"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (#9)"],[1,"depend. Not      to mention, that, to a young beginner, the general observations      and maxims occur not always on the proper occasions, nor can be      immediately applied with due calmness and distinction. The      truth is, an unexperienced reasoner could be no reasoner at      all, were he absolutely unexperienced; and when we assign that      character to any one, we mean it only in a comparative sense,      and suppose him possessed of experience, in a smaller and more      imperfect degree.    Custom, then, is the great guide of human life. It is that principle  alone which renders our experience useful to us, and makes us expect,  for the future, a similar train of events with those which have appeared  in the past.    Without the influence of custom, we should be entirely ignorant of every  matter of fact beyond what is immediately present to the memory and  senses. We should never know how to adjust means to ends, or to employ  our natural powers in the production of any effect. There would be an  end at once of all action, as well as of the chief part of speculation.    37. But here it may be proper to remark, that though our conclusions  from experience carry us beyond our memory and senses, and assure us of  matters of fact which happened in the most distant places and most  remote ages, yet some fact must always be present to the senses or  memory, from which we may first proceed in drawing these conclusions. A  man, who should find in a desert country the remains of pompous  buildings, would conclude that the country had, in ancient times, been  cultivated by civilized inhabitants; but did nothing of this nature  occur to him, he could never form such an inference. We learn the events  of former ages from history; but then we must peruse the volumes in  which this instruction is contained, and thence carry up our inferences  from one testimony to another, till we arrive at the eyewitnesses and  spectators of these distant events. In a word, if we proceed not upon  some fact, present to the memory or senses, our reasonings would be  merely hypothetical; and however the particular links might be connected  with each other, the whole chain of inferences would have nothing to  support it, nor could we ever, by its means, arrive at the knowledge of  any real existence. If I ask why you believe any particular matter of  fact, which you relate, you must tell me some reason; and this reason  will be some other fact, connected with it. But as you cannot proceed  after this manner, _in infinitum_, you must at last terminate in some  fact, which is present to your memory or senses; or must allow that your  belief is entirely without foundation.    38. What, then, is the conclusion of the whole matter? A simple one;  though, it must be confessed, pretty remote from the common theories of  philosophy. All belief of matter of fact or real existence is derived  merely from some object, present to the memory or senses, and a  customary conjunction between that and some other object. Or in other  words; having found, in many instances, that any two kinds of  objects--flame and heat, snow and cold--have always been conjoined  together; if flame or snow be presented anew to the senses, the mind is  carried by custom to expect heat or cold, and to _believe_ that such a  quality does exist, and will discover itself upon a nearer approach.  This belief is the necessary result of placing the mind in such  circumstances. It is an operation of the soul, when we are so situated,  as unavoidable as to feel the passion of love, when we receive benefits;  or hatred, when we meet with injuries. All these operations are a  species of natural instincts, which no reasoning or process of the  thought and understanding is able either to produce or to prevent.    At this point, it would be very allowable for us to stop our  philosophical researches. In most questions we can never make a single  step farther; and in all questions we must terminate here at last, after  our most restless and curious enquiries. But still our curiosity will be  pardonable, perhaps commendable, if it carry us on to still farther  researches, and make us examine more accurately the nature of this  _belief_, and of the _customary conjunction_, whence it is derived. By  this means we may meet with some explications and analogies that will  give satisfaction; at least to such as love the abstract sciences, and  can be entertained with speculations, which, however accurate, may still  retain a degree of doubt and uncertainty. As to readers of a different  taste; the remaining part of this section is not calculated for them,  and the following enquiries may well be understood, though it be  neglected.      PART II.      39. Nothing is more free than the imagination of man; and though it  cannot exceed that original stock of ideas furnished by the internal and  external senses, it has unlimited power of mixing, compounding,  separating, and dividing these ideas, in all the varieties of fiction  and vision. It can feign a train of events, with all the appearance of  reality, ascribe to them a particular time and place, conceive them as  existent, and paint them out to itself with every circumstance, that  belongs to any historical fact, which it believes with the greatest  certainty. Wherein, therefore, consists the difference between such a  fiction and belief? It lies not merely in any peculiar idea, which is  annexed to such a conception as commands our assent, and which is  wanting to every known fiction. For as the mind has authority over all  its ideas, it could voluntarily annex this particular idea to any  fiction, and consequently be able to believe whatever it pleases;  contrary to what we find by daily experience. We can, in our conception,  join the head of a man to the body of a horse; but it is not in our  power to believe that such an animal has ever really existed.    It follows, therefore, that the difference between _fiction_ and  _belief_ lies in some sentiment or feeling, which is annexed to the  latter, not to the former, and which depends not on the will, nor can be  commanded at pleasure. It must be excited by nature, like all other  sentiments; and must arise from the particular situation, in which the  mind is placed at any particular juncture. Whenever any object is  presented to the memory or senses, it immediately, by the force of  custom, carries the imagination to conceive that object, which is  usually conjoined to it; and this conception is attended with a feeling  or sentiment, different from the loose reveries of the fancy. In this  consists the whole nature of belief. For as there is no matter of fact  which we believe so firmly that we cannot conceive the contrary, there  would be no difference between the conception assented to and that which  is rejected, were it not for some sentiment which distinguishes the one  from the other. If I see a billiard-ball moving towards another, on a  smooth table, I can easily conceive it to stop upon contact. This  conception implies no contradiction; but still it feels very differently  from that conception by which I represent to myself the impulse and the  communication of motion from one ball to another.    40. Were we to attempt a _definition_ of this sentiment, we should,  perhaps, find it a very difficult, if not an impossible task; in the  same manner as if we should endeavour to define the feeling of cold or  passion of anger, to a creature who never had any experience of these  sentiments. Belief is the true and proper name of this feeling; and no  one is ever at a loss to know the meaning of that term; because every  man is every moment conscious of the sentiment represented by it. It may  not, however, be improper to attempt a _description_ of this sentiment;  in hopes we may, by that means, arrive at some analogies, which may  afford a more perfect explication of it. I say, then, that belief is  nothing but a more vivid, lively, forcible, firm, steady conception of  an object, than what the imagination alone is ever able to attain. This  variety of terms, which may seem so unphilosophical, is intended only to  express that act of the mind, which renders realities, or what is taken  for such, more present to us than fictions, causes them to weigh more in  the thought, and gives them a superior influence on the passions and  imagination. Provided we agree about the thing, it is needless to  dispute about the terms. The imagination has the command over all its  ideas, and can join and mix and vary them, in all the ways possible. It  may conceive fictitious objects with all the circumstances of place and  time. It may set them, in a manner, before our eyes, in their true  colours, just as they might have existed. But as it is impossible that  this faculty of imagination can ever, of itself, reach belief, it is  evident that belief consists not in the peculiar nature or order of  ideas, but in the _manner_ of their conception, and in their _feeling_  to the mind. I confess, that it is impossible perfectly to explain this  feeling or manner of conception. We may make use of words which express  something near it. But its true and proper name, as we observed before,  is _belief_; which is a term that every one sufficiently understands in  common life. And in philosophy, we can go no farther than assert, that  _belief_ is something felt by the mind, which distinguishes the ideas of  the judgement from the fictions of the imagination. It gives them more  weight and influence; makes them appear of greater importance; enforces  them in the mind; and renders them the governing principle of our  actions. I hear at present, for instance, a person's voice, with whom I  am acquainted; and the sound comes as from the next room. This  impression of my senses immediately conveys my thought to the person,  together with all the surrounding objects. I paint them out to myself as  existing"]]]
