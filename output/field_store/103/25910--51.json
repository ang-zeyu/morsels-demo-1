In Italy, notwithstanding the paucity of  bird life, I believe that the peasants know their birds better. The  reason of this is not far to seek; every bird, not excepting even the  \"temple-haunting martlet\" and nightingale and minute golden-crested  wren, is regarded only as a possible morsel to give a savour to a dish  of polenta, if the shy, little flitting thing can only be enticed within  touching distance of the limed twigs. Thus they take a very strong  interest in, and, in a sense, \"love\" birds. It is their passion for this  kind of flavouring which has drained rural Italy of its songsters, and  will in time have the same effect on Argentina, the country in which the  withering stream of Italian emigration empties itself.          VI      From the date of my arrival at the village in May, until I left it early  in July, the great annual business of pairing, nest-building, and  rearing the young was going on uninterruptedly. The young of some of the  earliest breeders were already strong on the wing when I took my first  walks along the hedgerows, still in their early, vivid green, frequently  observing my bird through a white and rose-tinted cloud of  apple-blossoms; and when I left some species that breed more than once  in the season were rearing second broods or engaged in making new nests.  On my very first day I discovered a nest full of fully fledged blue tits  in a hole in an apple tree; this struck me as a dangerous place for the  young birds; as the tree leaned over towards the lane, and the hole  could almost be reached by a person standing on the ground. On the next  day I went to look at them, and approaching noiselessly along the lane,  spied two small boys with bright clean faces--it was on a  Sunday--standing within three or four yards of the tree, watching the  tits with intense interest. The parent birds were darting up and down,  careless of their presence, finding food so quickly in the gooseberry  bushes growing near the roots of the tree that they visited the hole  every few moments; while the young birds, ever screaming for more, were  gathered in a dense little cluster at the entrance, their yellow breasts  showing very brightly against the rain-wet wood and the dark interior of  the hole. The instant the two little watchers caught sight of me the  excited look vanished from their faces, and they began to move off,  gazing straight ahead in a somewhat vacant manner. This instantaneous  and instinctive display of hypocrisy was highly entertaining, and would  have made me laugh if it had not been for the serious purpose I had in  my mind. \"Now, look here,\" I said, \"I know what you are after, so it's  no use pretending that you are walking about and seeing nothing in  particular. You've been watching the young tits. Well, I've been  watching them, too, and waiting to see them fly. I dare say they will  be out by to-morrow or the next day, and I hope you little fellows won't  try to drag them out before then.\"    They at once protested that they had no such intention. They said that  they never robbed birds' nests; that there were several nests at home in  the garden and orchard, one of a nightingale with three eggs in it, but  that they never took an egg. But some of the boys they knew, they said,  took all the eggs they found; and there was one boy who got into every  orchard and garden in the place, who was so sharp that few nests escaped  him, and every nest he found he destroyed, breaking the eggs if there  were any, and if there were young birds killing them.    Not, perhaps, without first mutilating them, I thought; for I know  something of this kind of young \"human devil,\" to use the phrase which  Canon Wilberforce has made so famous in another connexion. Later on I  heard much more about the exploits of this champion bird-destroyer of  the village from (strange to say) a bird-catcher by trade, a man of a  rather low type of countenance, and who lived, when at home, in a London  slum. On the common where he spread his nets he had found, he told me,  about thirty nests containing eggs or fledglings; but this boy had gone  over the ground after him, and not many of the nests had escaped his  sharp eyes.    I was satisfied that the young tits were quite safe, so far as these  youngsters were concerned, and only regretted that they were such small  Boys, and that the great nest-destroyer, whose evil deeds they spoke of  with an angry colour in their cheeks, was a very strong boy, otherwise I  should have advised them to \"go\" for him.    Oddly enough I heard of another boy who exercised the same kind of  cruelty and destructiveness over another common a few miles distant.  Walking across it I spied two boys among the furze bushes, and at the  same moment they saw me, whereupon one ran away and the other remained  standing. A nice little fellow of about eight, he looked as if he had  been crying. I asked him what it was all about, and he then told me that  the bigger boy who had just run away was always on the common searching  for nests, just to destroy them and kill the young birds; that he, my  informant, had come there where he came every day just to have a peep at  a linnet's nest with four eggs in it on which the bird was sitting; that  the other boy, concealed among the bushes had watched him go to the nest  and had then rushed up and pulled the nest out of the bush.    \"Why didn't you knock him down?\" I asked.    \"That's what I tried to do before he pulled the nest out,\" he said; and  then he added sorrowfully: \"He knocked me down.\"    I am reminded here of a tale of ancient Greece about a boy of this  description--the boy to be found in pretty well every parish in the  land. This was a shepherd boy who followed or led his sheep to a  distance from the village and amused his idle hours by snaring small  birds to put their eyes out with a sharp thorn, then to toss them up  just to see how, and how far, they would fly in the dark. He was seen  doing it and the matter reported to the heads or fathers of the village,  and he was brought before them and, after due consideration of the case,  condemned to death. Such a decision must seem shocking to us and worthy  of a semi-barbarous people. But if cruelty is the worst of all  offences--and this was cruelty in its most horrid form--the offence  which puts men down on a level with the worst of the mythical demons, it  was surely a righteous deed to blot such an existence out lest other  young minds should be contaminated, or even that it should be known that  such a crime was possible.    * * *    All those birds that had finished rearing their young by the sixteenth  of June were fortunate, for on the morning of that day a great and  continuous shouting, with gun-firing, banging on old brass and iron  utensils, with various other loud, unusual noises, were heard at one  extremity of the village, and continued with occasional quiet intervals  until evening. This tempest of rude sounds spread from day to day, until  the entire area of the village and the surrounding orchards was  involved, and the poor birds that were tied to the spots where their  treasures were, must have existed in a state of constant trepidation.  For now the cherries were fast ripening, and the fruit-eating birds,  especially the thrushes and black-birds, were inflamed at the gleam of  crimson colour among the leaves. In the very large orchards men and boys  were stationed all day long yelling and firing off guns to frighten the  marauders. In the smaller orchards the trees were decorated with  whirligigs of coloured paper; ancient hats, among which were some of the  quaintly-shaped chimney-pots of a past generation; old coats and  waistcoats and trousers, and rags of all colours to flutter in the wind;  and these objects were usually considered a sufficient protection. Some  of the birds, wiser than their fellows, were not to be kept back by such  simple means; but so long as they came not in battalions, but singly,  they could have their fill, and no notice was taken of them.    I was surprised to hear that on the large plantations the men employed  were not allowed to use shot, the aim of the fruit grower being only to  scare the birds away. I had a talk with my old friend of the wryneck on  the subject, and told him that I had seen one of the bird-scarers going  home to his cottage very early in the morning, carrying a bunch of about  a dozen blackbirds and thrushes he had just shot.    Yes, he replied, some of the men would buy shot and use it early in the  morning before their master was about; but if the man I had seen had  been detected in the act, he would have been discharged on the spot. It  was not only because the trees would be injured by shot, but this  fruitgrower was friendly to birds.    Most fruit-growers, I said, were dead against the birds, and anxious  only to kill as many of them as possible.    It might be so in some places, he answered, but not in the village. He  himself and most of the villagers depended, in a great measure, on the  fruit they produced for a living, and their belief was that, taking one  bird with another all the year round, the birds did them more good than  harm.    I then imparted to him the views on this bird subject of a well-known  fruit-grower in the north of England, Mr. Joseph Witherspoon, of  Chester-le-Street. He began by persecuting the birds, as he had been  taught to do by his father, a market-gardener; but after years of  careful observation he completely changed his views, and is now so  convinced of the advantage that birds are to the fruit-grower, that he  does all in his power to attract them, and to tempt them to breed in his  grounds."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7386"],[0,"Egyptian Tales, Translated from the Papyri: First series, IVth to XIIth dynasty (#9)"],[1,"is fixed, she is flourishing, she  is enjoying the best in the kingdom of the land, and her children are  in the chambers of the palace.    \"Leave all the riches that thou hast, and that are with thee,  altogether. When thou shalt come into Egypt behold the palace, and when  thou shalt enter the palace, bow thy face to the ground before the Great  House; thou shalt be chief among the companions. And day by day behold  thou growest old; thy vigour is lost, and thou thinkest on the day of  burial. Thou shalt see thyself come to the blessed state, they shall  give thee the bandages from the hand of Tait, the night of applying the  oil of embalming. They shall follow thy funeral, and visit the tomb on  the day of burial, which shall be in a gilded case, the head painted  with blue, a canopy of cypress wood above thee, and oxen shall draw  thee, the singers going before thee, and they shall dance the funeral  dance. The weepers crouching at the door of thy tomb shall cry aloud  the prayers for offerings: they shall slay victims for thee at the  door of thy pit; and thy pyramid shall be carved in white stone, in  the company of the royal children. Thus thou shalt not die in a  strange land, nor be buried by the Amu; thou shalt not be laid in a  sheep-skin when thou art buried; all people shall beat the earth, and  lament on thy body when thou goest to the tomb.\"    When this order came to me, I was in the midst of my tribe. When it was  read unto me, I threw me on the dust, I threw dust in my hair; I went  around my tent rejoicing and saying, \"How may it be that such a thing  is done to the servant, who with a rebellious heart has fled to  strange lands? Now with an excellent deliverance, and mercy delivering  me from death, thou shall cause me to end my days in the palace.\"    _Copy of the answer to this order._    \"The follower Sanehat says: In excellent peace above everything consider  of this flight that he made here in his ignorance; Thou, the Good God,  Lord of both Lands, Loved of Ra, Favourite of Mentu, the lord of Thebes,  and of Amen, lord of thrones of the lands, of Sebek, Ra, Horus, Hathor,  Atmu, and of his fellow-gods, of Sopdu, Neferbiu, Samsetu, Horus, lord  of the east, and of the royal uraeus which rules on thy head, of the  chief gods of the waters, of Min, Horus of the desert, Urrit, mistress  of Punt, Nut, Harnekht, Ra, all the gods of the land of Egypt, and of  the isles of the sea. May they give life and peace to thy nostril, may  they load thee with their gifts, may they give to thee eternity  without end, everlastingness without bound. May the fear of thee be  doubled in the lands of the deserts. Mayest thou subdue the circuit of  the sun's disc. This is the prayer to his master of the humble servant  who is saved from a foreign land.    \"O wise king, the wise words which are pronounced in the wisdom of the  majesty of the sovereign, thy humble servant fears to tell. It is a  great thing to repeat. O great God, like unto Ra in fulfilling that to  which he has set his hand, what am I that he should take thought for me?  Am I among those whom he regards, and for whom he arranges? Thy majesty  is as Horus, and the strength of thy arms extends to all lands.    \"Then let his Majesty bring Maki of Adma, Kenti-au-ush of Khenti-keshu,  and Tenus from the two lands ol the Fenkhu; these are the princes who  bear witness of me as to all that has passed, out of love for thyself.  Does not Tenu believe that it belongs to thee like thy dogs. Behold  this flight that I have made: I did not have it in my heart; it was  like the leading of a dream, as a man of Adehi (Delta) sees himself in  Abu (Elephantine), as a man of the plain of Egypt who sees himself in  the deserts. There was no fear, there was no hastening after me, I did  not listen to an evil plot, my name was not heard in the mouth of the  magistrate; but my limbs went, my feet wandered, my heart drew me; my  god commanded this flight, and drew me on; but I am not stiff-necked.  Does a man fear when he sees his own land? Ra spread thy fear over the  land, thy terrors in every strange land. Behold me now in the palace,  behold me in this place; and lo! thou art he who is over all the  horizon; the sun rises at thy pleasure, the water in the rivers is  drunk at thy will, the wind in heaven is breathed at thy saying.    \"I who speak to thee shall leave my goods to the generations to follow  in this land. And as to this messenger who is come even let thy majesty  do as pleaseth him, for one lives by the breath that thou givest. O thou  who art beloved of Ra, of Horus, and of Hathor; Mentu, lord of Thebes,  desires that thy august nostril should live for ever.\"    I made a feast in Iaa, to pass over my goods to my children. My eldest  son was leading my tribe, all my goods passed to him, and I gave him my  corn and all my cattle, my fruit, and all my pleasant trees. When I had  taken my road to the south, and arrived at the roads of Horus, the  officer who was over the garrison sent a messenger to the palace to give  notice. His majesty sent the good overseer of the peasants of the king's  domains, and boats laden with presents from the king for the Sati who  had come to conduct me to the roads of Horus. I spoke to each one by his  name, and I gave the presents to each as was intended. I received and I  returned the salutation, and I continued thus until I reached the city  of Thetu.    When the land was brightened, and the new day began, four men came with  a summons for me; and the four men went to lead me to the palace. I  saluted with both my hands on the ground; the royal children stood at  the courtyard to conduct me: the courtiers who were to lead me to the  hall brought me on the way to the royal chamber.    I found his Majesty on the great throne in the hall of pale gold. Then I  threw myself on my belly; this god, in whose presence I was, knew me  not. He questioned me graciously, but I was as one seized with  blindness, my spirit fainted, my limbs failed, my heart was no longer in  my bosom, and I knew the difference between life and death. His  majesty said to one of the companions, \"Lift him up, let him speak to  me.\" And his majesty said, \"Behold thou hast come, thou hast trodden  the deserts, thou hast played the wanderer.  Decay falls on thee, old  age has reached thee; it is no small thing that thy body should be  embalmed, that the Pedtiu shall not bury thee. Do not, do not, be  silent and speechless; tell thy name; is it fear that prevents thee?\"  I answered in reply, \"I fear, what is it that my lord has said that I  should answer it? I have not called on me the hand of God, but it is  terror in my body, like that which brings sudden death.  Now behold I  am before thee; thou art life; let thy majesty do what pleaseth him.\"    The royal children were brought in, and his majesty said to the queen,  \"Behold thou Sanehat has come as an Amu, whom the Sati have produced.\"    She cried aloud, and the royal children spake with one voice, saying,  before his majesty, \"Verily it is not so, O king, my lord.\" Said his  majesty, \"It is verily he.\" Then they brought their collars, and their  wands, and their sistra in their hands, and displayed them before his  majesty; and they sang--    \"May thy hands prosper, O king; May the ornaments of the Lady of Heaven  continue. May the goddess Nub give life to thy nostril; May the mistress  of the stars favour thee, when thou sailest south and north. All  wisdom is in the mouth of thy majesty; Thy uraeus is on thy forehead,  thou drivest away the miserable.    \"Thou art pacified, O Ra, lord of the lands; They call on thee as on the  mistress of all. Strong is thy horn, Thou lettest fly thine arrow. Grant  the breath to him who is without it; Grant good things to this  traveller, Samehit the Pedti, born in the land of Egypt, Who fled away  from fear of thee, And fled this land from thy terrors. Does not the  face grow pale, of him who beholds thy countenance; Does not the eye  fear, which looks upon thee.\"    Said his majesty, \"Let him not fear, let him be freed from terror. He  shall be a Royal Friend amongst the nobles; he shall be put within the  circle of the courtiers. Go ye to the chamber of praise to seek wealth  for him.\"    When I went out from the palace, the royal children offered their hands  to me; we walked afterwards to the Great Gates. I was placed in a house  of a king's son, in which were delicate things, a place of coolness,  fruits of the granary, treasures of the White House, clothes of the  king's guardrobe, frankincense, the finest perfumes of the king and the  nobles whom he loves, in every chamber. All the servitors were in their  several offices.    Years were removed from my limbs: I was shaved, and polled my locks of  hair; the foulness was cast to the desert with the garments of the  Nemau-sha. I clothed me in fine linen, and anointed myself with the fine  oil of Egypt; I laid me on a bed. I gave up the sand to those who lie  on it; the oil of wood to him who would anoint himself therewith.  There was given to me the mansion of a lord of serfs, which had  belonged to a royal friend. There many excellent things were in its  buildings; all its wood was renewed. There were brought to me portions  from the palace, thrice and four times each day; besides the gifts of  the royal children, always, without ceasing.  There was built for me a  pyramid of stone amongst the pyramids. The overseer of the architects  measured its ground; the chief treasurer wrote it; the sacred masons  cut the well; the chief of the labourers on the tombs brought the  bricks; all things used to make strong a building were there used.  There were given to me peasants; there were made for me a garden, and  fields in it before my mansion, as is done for the chief royal friend.  My statue was inlayed with gold, its girdle of pale gold; his majesty  caused it to be made.  Such is not done to a man of low "]]]
