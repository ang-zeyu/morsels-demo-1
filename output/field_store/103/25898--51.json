There is not one of the men on the wall who would miss a man whose figure  he could make out at fifty yards' distance, and they would scarce see them  until they were as close as that. No, my lord, I would wager a month's pay  that when morning dawns there is a dead man lying somewhere in front of  the outwork.\"    \"Now, Guy, you had best go up to your room and lie down until daylight,\"  Sir Eustace said. \"There will be naught doing to-night, and unless I am  mistaken, we shall be busy from sunrise till sunset. I shall myself lie  down for a couple of hours presently, and then send John Harpen to rest  till daylight. Long Tom, see that you yourself and all your men take a  short sleep by turns; we shall need your eyes to be open above all others  to-morrow.\"    Guy promptly obeyed the order. Dame Margaret was still up.    \"Is everything quiet, Guy?\" she asked as she entered,    \"So quiet, my lady, that Sir Eustace has ordered me to bed, and he said  that he himself should come down for a short sleep presently. Two spies  who crawled up have been slain by the archers. Sir Eustace is sure that no  attack will be made before morning.\"    Then he went into his little room and threw himself onto his pallet.  During the first few minutes he lifted his head several times fancying  that he heard noises; then he fell into a sound sleep and did not awake  until the day dawned.    In a few minutes Guy was on the wall. The night had passed quietly; so far  as was known no fresh attempt at reconnoitring the works had been made,  and as the moon had risen soon after he had gone to bed there was reason  to believe that the fact that the two spies had not returned was so strong  a proof of the vigilance of the garrison, that the enemy had been content  to wait until morning. Just as the sun rose the three knights who had  summoned the castle on the preceding evening appeared on the brow of the  opposite slope, accompanied by a body of men-at-arms, and rode slowly  round the castle. From time to time they halted, and were evidently  engaged in a discussion as to the point at which it could be best  attacked.    \"Shall I shoot, my lord?\" Long Tom asked. \"They are some two hundred and  fifty yards away, but from this height methinks that I could reach them.\"    \"It would be useless,\" Sir Eustace said; \"you could hit them, I doubt not,  but you would not pierce their armour at this distance, and it is as well  that they should not know how far our bows will carry until we are sure of  doing execution when we shoot; besides I would rather that they began the  fight. The quarrel is not one of my seeking, and I will leave it to them  to open the ball. It is true that they did so last night by sending their  spies here, but we have balanced that account. Moreover, if they are to  attack, the sooner the better. They may have gained news from Sir Hugh of  the coming here of the English archers and the men-at-arms, but if they  have not done so we shall have a rare surprise in store for them.\"    After the knights had made a circuit of the castle they retired, and  presently a dense mass of men appeared from behind the brow on which the  cottages they had burned had stood.    \"They have bundles of faggots, Sir Eustace!\" Guy exclaimed.    \"So they have, Guy! Your eye is a good one. It seemed to me that the  outline was a strange one, but doubtless it is as you say--that each man  has a faggot on his shoulder. It is evident that they intend, in the first  place, to assault the postern, and have brought the faggots to fill up the  ditch.\"    Then he turned to the gunners at the cannon.    \"Lay your pieces so as to bear on them when they come half-way down the  hill,\" he said, \"and shoot when they are fairly in the line of fire. Take  the same orders, Guy, to the men working the ballistas and mangonels on  the wall. Tell them not to loose their machines until after the guns are  fired. If the fellows take to flight, tell them not to waste their  missiles; if they advance, let them be sure that they are well within  range before they shoot.\"    With loud shouts the enemy came down the slope. When they were half-way  down the two guns roared out, and their shot ploughed two lanes in the  crowded body. There was a movement of retreat, but the three knights and  several others threw themselves in front, waving their swords and  shouting, and the Orleanists rallied and moved forward, but at a much  slower pace than before. They had gone but a short distance when the  arrows of the archers in the outwork and the bolts of the cross-bows  worked by the men-at-arms there, began to fall among them. So true was the  aim of the archers that scarce a shaft was wasted. At the distance at  which they were shooting they did not aim at the knights, whose vizors and  coats of mail could not have been pierced, but shot at the commonalty,  whose faces and throats were for the most part unprotected. Man after man  fell, and the cross-bow bolts also told heavily upon the crowd. They had  come down but a short distance farther when Long Tom, and the archers with  him on the wall, began to send their arrows thick and fast, and the  machines hurled heavy stones with tremendous force among them. A moment  later the French broke and fled up the slope again, leaving some fifty of  their number stretched on the ground. The knights followed more slowly.  When they reached the crest a group of them gathered around Sir Clugnet de  Brabant.    \"By my faith,\" the latter said bitterly, \"we have reckoned without our  host, Sir Knights. We came to shear, but in good sooth we seem more likely  to go back shorn. Truly those knaves shoot marvellously; scarce an arrow  went astray.\"    \"As I mentioned to you, Sir Clugnet,\" Sir Hugh de Fruges said, \"Sir  Eustace brought with him from England five-and-twenty bowmen, and I heard  tell from men who had seen them trying their skill at targets that they  were in no wise inferior to those with whom we have before had to deal to  our cost.\"    \"Truly ye did so, Sir Hugh; but the matter made no impression upon my  mind, except as a proof that the knight's inclinations were still with  England, and that it were well that his castle were placed in better  keeping; but in truth these fellows shoot marvellously, both for strength  and trueness of aim. I marked as we came back that of the men we passed  lying there, nigh all those who had been struck with arrows were hit in  the face or throat, and yet the distance must have been over a hundred and  fifty yards.\"    \"I can answer for the force,\" one of the others said, \"for a shaft struck  me fairly on the chest, and hurled me to the ground as if it had been the  shock of a lance, and it is well my mail was of the best work of Milan;  but nevertheless the arrow broke two of the links; if the distance had  been shorter, I doubt not that it would have slain me. Well, what shall we  do next, gentlemen? For very shame we cannot with eight thousand men march  away having accomplished nothing. The question is, where shall our next  attack be delivered?\"    \"Methinks,\" another knight said, \"we delivered our attack too rashly. Had  I known that there were English archers there I should have advised  waiting until nightfall, and I think that it would be best to do so now.  If we take our fellows up while there is light they will suffer so much  from the stings of these wasps that they will soon lose heart. The knaves  shoot not only straight and strong, but they shoot so fast that though, as  you say, there may be but twenty-five of them, the air seemed full of  arrows, and had you told us that there were two hundred archers shooting,  I should have thought the estimate a reasonable one.\"    They stood for some time discussing the best method of attack, and as soon  as they had settled upon it the men were told to scatter. Some were to go  to the farmhouses, and bring up any hides that might be stored there, and  to fetch all the hurdles they could lay hands upon; a portion were to go  to the woods and cut timber for making mantlets and cover, while two  thousand were to remain under arms in case the garrison should make a  sortie.    Within the castle all were in high spirits at the easy repulse of the  first attack.    \"Sir Clugnet must have learned from Sir Hugh of my having English archers  and men-at-arms here,\" Sir Eustace said to his lieutenant, \"and yet he  advanced as carelessly and confidently as if he had been attacking a place  defended only by fat Flemish burghers; however, he has had his lesson, and  as it is said he is a good knight, he will doubtless profit by it, and we  shall hear no more of him till after the sun has set. Run up to the top of  the keep, Guy, and bring me back news what they are doing.\"    In a few minutes the lad returned. \"There are two or three thousand of  them, my lord, drawn up in a body beyond the crest; the rest of them are  scattering in various directions.\"    \"That is as I expected,\" Sir Eustace remarked; \"they have gone to prepare  materials for a regular attack. It may be delivered to-night, or may be  delayed for a day or two; however, we shall be ready for them. Jean  Bouvard, do you go round the walls and tell all, save a few as sentries,  to retire until the watchman blows his horn to warn us if they seem to be  gathering for an attack; and do you, Long Tom, give the same orders to  your archers. There is no use wasting the men's strength till the work  begins in earnest. If Sir Clugnet is wise he will march away at once. He  would need heavy machines and cannon to make a breach in our walls, and  even had he an abundance of them it would take him some time to do so. If  he tries again, you may be sure that it will be the work of Sir Hugh de  Fruges, who has no doubt a lively interest in the matter. He is a clever  fellow, and will no doubt do his best to work on the feelings of the other  knights by representing "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7065"],[0,"Children of the Bush (#9)"],[1,"-hook, and  wasn't aware of the fact till he sat down on the point of it. But that's  got nothing to do with it.    The Imperial Hotel at Bourke was unpopular from the first. It was said  that the very existence of the house was the result of a swindle. It had  been built with money borrowed on certain allotments in the centre  of the town and on the understanding that it should be built on the  mortgaged land, whereas it was erected on a free allotment. Which fact  was discovered, greatly to its surprise, by the building society when it  came to foreclose on the allotments some years later. While the building  was being erected the Bourke people understood, in a vague way, that it  was to be a convent (perhaps the building society thought so, too), and  when certain ornaments in brick and cement in the shape of a bishop's  mitre were placed over the corners of the walls the question seemed  decided. But when the place was finished a bar was fitted up, and up  went the sign, to the disgust of the other publicans, who didn't know a  licence had been taken out--for licensing didn't go by local option in  those days. It was rumoured that the place belonged to, and the whole  business was engineered by, a priest. And priests are men of the world.    The Imperial Hotel was patronized by the pastoralists, the civil  servants, the bank manager and clerks--all the scrub aristocracy; it was  the headquarters of the Pastoralists' Union in Bourke; a barracks for  blacklegs brought up from Sydney to take the place of Union shearers  on strike; and the new Governor, on his inevitable visit to Bourke, was  banqueted at the Imperial Hotel. The editor of the local \"capitalistic  rag\" stayed there; the pastoralists' member was elected mostly by dark  ways and means devised at the Imperial Hotel, and one of its managers  had stood as a dummy candidate to split the Labour vote; the management  of the hotel was his reward. In short, it was there that most of the  plots were hatched to circumvent Freedom, and put away or deliver into  the clutches of law and order certain sons of Light and Liberty who  believed in converting blacklegs into jellies by force of fists when  bribes, gentle persuasion and pure Australian language failed to convert  them to clean Unionism. The Imperial Hotel was called the \"Squatters'  Pub,\" the \"Scabbery,\" and other and more expressive names.    The hotel became still more unpopular after Percy Douglas had managed  it for a while. He was an avowed enemy of Labour Unionists. He employed  Chinese cooks, and that in the height of the anti-Chinese agitation in  Australia, and he was known to have kindly feelings towards the Afghans  who, with their camels, were running white carriers off the roads. If an  excited Unionist called a man a \"blackleg\" or \"scab\" in the Imperial bar  he was run out--sometimes with great difficulty, and occasionally as far  as the lock-up.    Percy Douglas was a fine-looking man, \"wid a chest on him an' well  hung--a fine fee-_gure_ of a man,\" as O'Donohoo pronounced it. He was  tall and erect, he dressed well, wore small side-whiskers, had an eagle  nose, and looked like an aristocrat. Like many of his type, who start  sometimes as billiard-markers and suddenly become hotel managers in  Australia, nothing was known of his past. Jack Mitchell reckoned, by  the way he treated his employees and spoke to workmen, that he was the  educated son of an English farmer--gone wrong and sent out to Australia.  Someone called him \"Lord Douglas,\" and the nickname caught on.    He made himself well hated. He got One-eyed Bogan \"three months' hard\"  for taking a bottle of whisky off the Imperial bar counter because  he (Bogan) was drunk and thirsty and had knocked down his cheque, and  because there was no one minding the bar at the moment.    Lord Douglas dismissed the barmaid, and, as she was leaving, he had  her boxes searched and gave her in charge for stealing certain articles  belonging to the hotel. The chaps subscribed to defend the case, and  subsequently put a few pounds together for the girl. She proved her  gratitude by bringing a charge of a baby against one of the chaps--but  that was only one of the little ways of the world, as Mitchell said. She  joined a Chinese camp later on.    Lord Douglas employed a carpenter to do some work about the hotel, and  because the carpenter left before the job was finished, Lord Douglas  locked his tools in an outhouse and refused to give them up; and when  the carpenter, with the spirit of an Australian workman, broke the  padlock and removed his tool-chest, the landlord gave him in charge for  breaking and entering. The chaps defended the case and won it, and hated  Lord Douglas as much as if he were their elder brother. Mitchell was the  only one to put in a word for him.    \"I've been puzzling it out,\" said Mitchell, as he sat nursing his best  leg in the Union Office, \"and, as far as I can see, it all amounts to  this--we're all mistaken in Lord Douglas. We don't know the man.  He's all right. We don't understand him. He's really a sensitive,  good-hearted man who's been shoved a bit off the track by the world.  It's the world's fault--he's not to blame. You see, when he was a  youngster he was the most good-natured kid in the school; he was always  soft, and, consequently, he was always being imposed upon, and bullied,  and knocked about. Whenever he got a penny to buy lollies he'd count 'em  out carefully and divide 'em round amongst his schoolmates and brothers  and sisters. He was the only one that worked at home, and consequently  they all hated him. His father respected him, but didn't love him,  because he wasn't a younger son, and wasn't bringing his father's grey  hairs down in sorrow to the grave. If it was in Australia, probably Lord  Douglas was an elder son and had to do all the hard graft, and teach  himself at night, and sleep in a bark skillion while his younger  brothers benefited--they were born in the new brick house and went to  boarding-schools. His mother had a contempt for him because he wasn't a  black sheep and a prodigal, and, when the old man died, the rest of the  family got all the stuff and Lord Douglas was kicked out because they  could do without him now. And the family hated him like poison ever  afterwards (especially his mother), and spread lies about him--because  they had treated him shamefully and because his mouth was shut--they  knew he wouldn't speak. Then probably he went in for Democracy and  worked for Freedom, till Freedom trod on him once too often with her  hob-nailed boots. Then the chances are, in the end, he was ruined by  a girl or woman, and driven, against his will, to take refuge in pure  individualism. He's all right, only we don't appreciate him. He's  only fighting against his old ideals--his old self that comes up  sometimes--and that's what makes him sweat his barmaids and servants,  and hate us, and run us in; and perhaps when he cuts up extra rough it's  because his conscience kicks him when he thinks of the damned soft fool  he used to be. He's all right--take my word for it. It's all a mask.  Why, he might be one of the kindest-hearted men in Bourke underneath.\"    Tom Hall rubbed his head and blinked, as if he was worried by an idea  that there might be some facts in Mitchell's theories.    \"You're allers findin' excuses for blacklegs an' scabs, Mitchell,\" said  Barcoo-Rot, who took Mitchell seriously (and who would have taken  a laughing jackass seriously). \"Why, you'd find a white spot on a  squatter. I wouldn't be surprised if you blacklegged yourself in the  end.\"    This was an unpardonable insult, from a Union point of view, and the  chaps half-unconsciously made room on the floor for Barcoo-Rot to  fall after Jack Mitchell hit him. But Mitchell took the insult  philosophically.    \"Well, Barcoo-Rot,\" he said, nursing the other leg, \"for the matter of  that, I did find a white spot on a squatter once. He lent me a quid when  I was hard up. There's white spots on the blackest characters if  you only drop prejudice and look close enough. I suppose even  Jack-the-Ripper's character was speckled. Why, I can even see spots on  your character, sometimes, Barcoo-Rot. I've known white spots to spread  on chaps' characters until they were little short of saints. Sometimes  I even fancy I can feel my own wings sprouting. And as for turning  blackleg--well, I suppose I've got a bit of the crawler in my  composition (most of us have), and a man never knows what might happen  to his principles.\"    \"Well,\" said Barcoo-Rot, \"I beg yer pardon--ain't that enough?\"    \"No,\" said Mitchell, \"you ought to wear a three-bushel bag and ashes for  three months, and drink water; but since the police would send you to  an asylum if you did that, I think the best thing we can do is to go out  and have a drink.\"      Lord Douglas married an Australian girl somewhere, somehow, and brought  her to Bourke, and there were two little girls--regular little fairies.  She was a gentle, kind-hearted little woman, but she didn't seem to  improve him much, save that he was very good to her.    \"It's mostly that way,\" commented Mitchell. \"When a boss gets married  and has children he thinks he's got a greater right to grind his  fellowmen and rob their wives and children. I'd never work for a boss  with a big family--it's hard enough to keep a single boss nowadays in  this country.\"    After one stormy election, at the end of a long and bitter shearing  strike, One-eyed Bogan, his trusty enemy, Barcoo-Rot, and one or two  other enthusiastic reformers were charged with rioting, and got from one  to three months' hard. And they had only smashed three windows of the  Imperial Hotel and chased the Chinese cook into the river.    \"I used to have some hopes for Democracy,\" commented Mitchell, \"but I've  got none now.
