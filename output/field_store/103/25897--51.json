German oaths of indescribable vigour poured from his lips. In a group  some feet away stood six muscular, short-sleeved stage-hands. It was  they who had flung themselves on the general at the fall of the iron  curtain and prevented him dashing round to attack the stalls with his  sabre. At a sign from the stage-manager they were ready to do it again.    The stage-manager was endeavouring to administer balm.    \"Bless you, your Highness,\" he was saying, \"it's nothing. It's what  happens to everyone some time. Ask any of the top-notch pros. Ask 'em  whether they never got the bird when they were starting. Why, even now  some of the biggest stars can't go to some towns because they always  cop it there. Bless you, it----\"    A stage-hand came up with a piece of paper in his hand.    \"Young feller in spectacles and a rum sort o' suit give me this for  your 'Ighness.\"    The Prince snatched it from his hand.    The note was written in a round, boyish hand. It was signed, \"A  Friend.\" It ran:--\"The men who booed you to-night were sent for that  purpose by General Vodkakoff, who is jealous of you because of the  paragraphs in the _Encore_ this week.\"    Prince Otto became suddenly calm.    \"Excuse me, your Highness,\" said the stage-manager anxiously, as he  moved, \"you can't go round to the front. Stand by, Bill.\"    \"Right, sir!\" said the stage-hands.    Prince Otto smiled pleasantly.    \"There is no danger. I do not intend to go to the front. I am going to  look in at the Scotch Stores for a moment.\"    \"Oh, in that case, your Highness, good-night, your Highness! Better  luck to-morrow, your Highness!\"           *       *       *       *       *    It had been the custom of the two generals, since they had joined the  music-hall profession, to go, after their turn, to the Scotch Stores,  where they stood talking and blocking the gangway, as etiquette demands  that a successful artiste shall.    The Prince had little doubt but that he would find Vodkakoff there  to-night.    He was right. The Russian general was there, chatting affably across  the counter about the weather.    He nodded at the Prince with a well-assumed carelessness.    \"Go well to-night?\" he inquired casually.    Prince Otto clenched his fists; but he had had a rigorously diplomatic  up-bringing, and knew how to keep a hold on himself. When he spoke it  was in the familiar language of diplomacy.    \"The rain has stopped,\" he said, \"but the pavements are still wet  underfoot. Has your grace taken the precaution to come out in a good  stout pair of boots?\"    The shaft plainly went home, but the Grand Duke's manner, as he  replied, was unruffled.    \"Rain,\" he said, sipping his vermouth, \"is always wet; but sometimes it  is cold as well.\"    \"But it never falls upwards,\" said the Prince, pointedly.    \"Rarely, I understand. Your powers of observation are keen, my dear  Prince.\"    There was a silence; then the Prince, momentarily baffled, returned to  the attack.    \"The quickest way to get from Charing Cross to Hammersmith Broadway,\"  he said, \"is to go by Underground.\"    \"Men have died in Hammersmith Broadway,\" replied the Grand Duke  suavely.    The Prince gritted his teeth. He was no match for his slippery  adversary in a diplomatic dialogue, and he knew it.    \"The sun rises in the East,\" he cried, half-choking, \"but it sets--it  sets!\"    \"So does a hen,\" was the cynical reply.    The last remnants of the Prince's self-control were slipping away. This  elusive, diplomatic conversation is a terrible strain if one is not in  the mood for it. Its proper setting is the gay, glittering ball-room at  some frivolous court. To a man who has just got the bird at a  music-hall, and who is trying to induce another man to confess that the  thing was his doing, it is little short of maddening.    \"Hen!\" he echoed, clenching and unclenching his fists. \"Have you  studied the habits of hens?\"    The truth seemed very near to him now, but the master-diplomat before  him was used to extracting himself from awkward corners.    \"Pullets with a southern exposure,\" he drawled, \"have yellow legs and  ripen quickest.\"    The Prince was nonplussed. He had no answer.    The girl behind the bar spoke.    \"You do talk silly, you two!\" she said.    It was enough. Trivial as the remark was, it was the last straw. The  Prince brought his fist down with a crash on the counter.    \"Yes,\" he shouted, \"you are right. We do talk silly; but we shall do so  no longer. I am tired of this verbal fencing. A plain answer to a plain  question. Did you or did you not send your troops to give me the bird  to-night?\"    \"My dear Prince!\"    The Grand Duke raised his eyebrows.    \"Did you or did you not?\"    \"The wise man,\" said the Russian, still determined on evasion, \"never  takes sides, unless they are sides of bacon.\"    The Prince smashed a glass.    \"You did!\" he roared. \"I know you did! Listen to me! I'll give you one  chance. I'll give you and your precious soldiers twenty-four hours from  midnight to-night to leave this country. If you are still here  then----\"    He paused dramatically.    The Grand Duke slowly drained his vermouth.    \"Have you seen my professional advertisement in the _Era_, my dear  Prince?\" he asked.    \"I have. What of it?\"    \"You noticed nothing about it?\"    \"I did not.\"    \"Ah. If you had looked more closely, you would have seen the words,  'Permanent address, Hampstead.'\"    \"You mean----\"    \"I mean that I see no occasion to alter that advertisement in any way.\"    There was another tense silence. The two men looked hard at each other.    \"That is your final decision?\" said the German.    The Russian bowed.    \"So be it,\" said the Prince, turning to the door. \"I have the honour to  wish you a very good night.\"    \"The same to you,\" said the Grand Duke. \"Mind the step.\"          Chapter 9    THE GREAT BATTLE      The news that an open rupture had occurred between the Generals of the  two invading armies was not slow in circulating. The early editions of  the evening papers were full of it. A symposium of the opinions of Dr.  Emil Reich, Dr. Saleeby, Sandow, Mr. Chiozza Money, and Lady Grove was  hastily collected. Young men with knobbly and bulging foreheads were  turned on by their editors to write character-sketches of the two  generals. All was stir and activity.    Meanwhile, those who look after London's public amusements were busy  with telephone and telegraph. The quarrel had taken place on Friday  night. It was probable that, unless steps were taken, the battle would  begin early on Saturday. Which, it did not require a man of unusual  intelligence to see, would mean a heavy financial loss to those who  supplied London with its Saturday afternoon amusements. The matinees  would suffer. The battle might not affect the stalls and dress-circle,  perhaps, but there could be no possible doubt that the pit and gallery  receipts would fall off terribly.

You  might have seen us there, side by side, during the greater part of the  Gentlemen's first innings against the Players (who had lost the toss)  on the second Monday in July.  We were to be seen, but not heard, for  Raffles had failed to score, and was uncommonly cross for a player who  cared so little for the game.  Merely taciturn with me, he was  positively rude to more than one member who wanted to know how it had  happened, or who ventured to commiserate him on his luck; there he sat,  with a straw hat tilted over his nose and a cigarette stuck between  lips that curled disagreeably at every advance.  I was therefore much  surprised when a young fellow of the exquisite type came and squeezed  himself in between us, and met with a perfectly civil reception despite  the liberty.  I did not know the boy by sight, nor did Raffles  introduce us; but their conversation proclaimed at once a slightness of  acquaintanceship and a license on the lad's part which combined to  puzzle me.  Mystification reached its height when Raffles was informed  that the other's father was anxious to meet him, and he instantly  consented to gratify that whim.    \"He's in the Ladies' Enclosure.  Will you come round now?\"    \"With pleasure,\" says Raffles.  \"Keep a place for me, Bunny.\"    And they were gone.    \"Young Crowley,\" said some voice further back.  \"Last year's Harrow  Eleven.\"    \"I remember him.  Worst man in the team.\"    \"Keen cricketer, however.  Stopped till he was twenty to get his  colors.  Governor made him.  Keen breed.  Oh, pretty, sir!  Very  pretty!\"    The game was boring me.  I only came to see old Raffles perform.  Soon  I was looking wistfully for his return, and at length I saw him  beckoning me from the palings to the right.    \"Want to introduce you to old Amersteth,\" he whispered, when I joined  him.  \"They've a cricket week next month, when this boy Crowley comes  of age, and we've both got to go down and play.\"    \"Both!\" I echoed.  \"But I'm no cricketer!\"    \"Shut up,\" says Raffles.  \"Leave that to me. I've been lying for all  I'm worth,\" he added sepulchrally as we reached the bottom of the  steps. \"I trust to you not to give the show away.\"    There was a gleam in his eye that I knew well enough elsewhere, but was  unprepared for in those healthy, sane surroundings; and it was with  very definite misgivings and surmises that I followed the Zingari  blazer through the vast flower-bed of hats and bonnets that bloomed  beneath the ladies' awning.    Lord Amersteth was a fine-looking man with a short mustache and a  double chin.  He received me with much dry courtesy, through which,  however, it was not difficult to read a less flattering tale.  I was  accepted as the inevitable appendage of the invaluable Raffles, with  whom I felt deeply incensed as I made my bow.    \"I have been bold enough,\" said Lord Amersteth, \"to ask one of the  Gentlemen of England to come down and play some rustic cricket for us  next month.  He is kind enough to say that he would have liked nothing  better, but for this little fishing expedition of yours, Mr.-----,  Mr.-----,\" and Lord Amersteth succeeded in remembering my name.    It was, of course, the first I had ever heard of that fishing  expedition, but I made haste to say that it could easily, and should  certainly, be put off.  Raffles gleamed approval through his eyelashes.  Lord Amersteth bowed and shrugged.    \"You're very good, I'm sure,\" said he.  \"But I understand you're a  cricketer yourself?\"    \"He was one at school,\" said Raffles, with infamous readiness.    \"Not a real cricketer,\" I was stammering meanwhile.    \"In the eleven?\" said Lord Amersteth.    \"I'm afraid not,\" said I.    \"But only just out of it,\" declared Raffles, to my horror.    \"Well, well, we can't all play for the Gentlemen,\" said Lord Amersteth  slyly.  \"My son Crowley only just scraped into the eleven at Harrow,  and HE'S going to play.  I may even come in myself at a pinch; so you  won't be the only duffer, if you are one, and I shall be very glad if  you will come down and help us too.  You shall flog a stream before  breakfast and after dinner, if you like.\"    \"I should be very proud,\" I was beginning, as the mere prelude to  resolute excuses; but the eye of Raffles opened wide upon me; and I  hesitated weakly, to be duly lost.    \"Then that's settled,\" said Lord Amersteth, with the slightest  suspicion of grimness.  \"It's to be a little week, you know, when my  son comes of age.  We play the Free Foresters, the Dorsetshire  Gentlemen, and probably some local lot as well. But Mr. Raffles will  tell you all about it, and Crowley shall write.  Another wicket!  By  Jove, they're all out!  Then I rely on you both.\" And, with a little  nod, Lord Amersteth rose and sidled to the gangway.    Raffles rose also, but I caught the sleeve of his blazer.    \"What are you thinking of?\" I whispered savagely.  \"I was nowhere near  the eleven.  I'm no sort of cricketer.  I shall have to get out of  this!\"    \"Not you,\" he whispered back.  \"You needn't play, but come you must.  If you wait for me after half-past six I'll tell you why.\"    But I could guess the reason; and I am ashamed to say that it revolted  me much less than did the notion of making a public fool of myself on a  cricket-field.  My gorge rose at this as it no longer rose at crime,  and it was in no tranquil humor that I strolled about the ground while  Raffles disappeared in the pavilion.  Nor was my annoyance lessened by  a little meeting I witnessed between young Crowley and his father, who  shrugged as he stopped and stooped to convey some information which  made the young man look a little blank. It may have been pure  self-consciousness on my part, but I could have sworn that the trouble  was their inability to secure the great Raffles without his  insignificant friend.    Then the bell rang, and I climbed to the top of the pavilion to watch  Raffles bowl.  No subtleties are lost up there; and if ever a bowler  was full of them, it was A. J. Raffles on this day, as, indeed, all the  cricket world remembers.  One had not to be a cricketer oneself to  appreciate his perfect command of pitch and break, his beautifully easy  action, which never varied with the varying pace, his great ball on the  leg-stump--his dropping head-ball--in a word, the infinite ingenuity of  that versatile attack.  It was no mere exhibition of athletic prowess,  it was an intellectual treat, and one with a special significance in my  eyes.  I saw the \"affinity between the two things,\" saw it in that  afternoon's tireless warfare against the flower of professional  cricket.  It was not that Raffles took many wickets for few runs; he  was too fine a bowler to mind being hit; and time was short, and the  wicket good.  What I admired, and what I remember, was the combination  of resource and cunning, of patience and precision, of head-work and  handiwork, which made every over an artistic whole.  It was all so  characteristic of that other Raffles whom I alone knew!    \"I felt like bowling this afternoon,\" he told me later in the hansom.  \"With a pitch to help me, I'd have done something big; as it is, three  for forty-one, out of the four that fell, isn't so bad for a slow  bowler on a plumb wicket against those fellows.  But I felt venomous!  Nothing riles me more than being asked about for my cricket as though I  were a pro. myself.\"    \"Then why on earth go?\"    \"To punish them, and--because we shall be jolly hard up, Bunny, before  the season's over!\"    \"Ah!\" said I.  \"I thought it was that.\"    \"Of course, it was!  It seems they're going to have the very devil of a  week of it--balls--dinner parties--swagger house party--general  junketings--and obviously a houseful of diamonds as well.  Diamonds  galore!  As a general rule nothing would induce me to abuse my position  as a guest.  I've never done it, Bunny.  But in this case we're engaged  like the waiters and the band, and by heaven we'll take our toll!  Let's have a quiet dinner somewhere and talk it over.\"    \"It seems rather a vulgar sort of theft,\" I could not help saying; and  to this, my single protest, Raffles instantly assented.    \"It _is_ a vulgar sort,\" said he; \"but I can't help that.  We're getting  vulgarly hard up again, and there's an end on 't.  Besides, these  people deserve it, and can afford it.  And don't you run away with the  idea that all will be plain sailing; nothing will be easier than  getting some stuff, and nothing harder than avoiding all suspicion, as,  of course, we must.  We may come away with no more than a good working  plan of the premises.  Who knows?  In any case there's weeks of  thinking in it for you and me.\"    But with those weeks I will not weary you further than by remarking  that the \"thinking,\" was done entirely by Raffles, who did not always  trouble to communicate his thoughts to me.  His reticence, however, was  no longer an irritant.  I began to accept it as a necessary convention  of these little enterprises.  And, after our last adventure of the  kind, more especially after its denouement, my trust in Raffles was  much too solid to be shaken by a want of trust in me, which I still  believe to have been more the instinct of the criminal than the  judgment of the man.    It was on Monday, the tenth of August, that we were due at Milchester  Abbey, Dorset; and the beginning of the month found us cruising about  that very county, with fly-rods actually in our hands.  The idea was  that we should acquire at once a local reputation as decent fishermen,  and some knowledge of the countryside, with a view to further and more  deliberate operations in the event of an unprofitable week.  There was  another idea which Raffles kept to himself until he had got me down  there.  Then one day he produced a cricket-ball in a meadow we were  crossing, and threw me catches for an hour together."]]]
