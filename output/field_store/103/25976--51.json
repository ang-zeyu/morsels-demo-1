To see others abject, is a sign of bickerings and false dealings  among your friends.    _Abode_.[5]    To dream that you can't find your abode, you will completely lose  faith in the integrity of others.    If you have no abode in your dreams, you will be unfortunate in your affairs,  and lose by speculation.    To change your abode, signifies hurried tidings and that hasty journeys  will be made by you.    For a young woman to dream that she has left her abode, is significant  of slander and falsehoods being perpetrated against her.    [5] See Home.    _Abortion_.    For a woman to dream that she assents to abortion being committed on her,  is a warning that she is contemplating some enterprise which if carried  out will steep her in disgrace and unhappiness.    For a doctor to dream that he is a party to an abortion,  foretells that his practice will suffer from his inattention  to duty, which will cause much trouble.    _Above_.    To see anything hanging above you, and about to fall, implies danger;  if it falls upon you it may be ruin or sudden disappointment.  If it falls near, but misses you, it is a sign that you will have  a narrow escape from loss of money, or other misfortunes may follow.    Should it be securely fixed above you, so as not to imply danger,  your condition will improve after threatened loss.    _Abroad_.    To dream that you are abroad, or going abroad, foretells that you  will soon, in company with a party, make a pleasant trip, and you  will find it necessary to absent yourself from your native country  for a sojourn in a different climate.    _Absalom_.    To dream of Absalom, is significant of distressing incidents.  You may unconsciously fall a victim to error, and penetrate  some well beloved heart with keen anguish and pain over the  committal of immoral actions and the outraging of innocence.  No flower of purity will ever be too sacred for you to breathe  a passionate breath upon.  To dream of this, or any other  disobedient character, is a warning against immoral tendencies.  A father is warned by this dream to be careful of his children.    _Absence_.    To grieve over the absence of any one in your dreams, denotes that repentance  for some hasty action will be the means of securing you life-long friendships.    If you rejoice over the absence of friends, it denotes that you  will soon be well rid of an enemy.    _Abscess_.    To dream that you have an abscess which seems to have reached a chronic stage,  you will be overwhelmed with misfortune of your own; at the same time your  deepest sympathies will be enlisted for the sorrows of others.    _Absinthe_.    To come under the influence of absinthe in dreams, denotes that you  will lead a merry and foolish pace with innocent companions, and waste  your inheritance in prodigal lavishness on the siren, selfish fancy.    For a young woman to dream that she drinks absinthe with her lover warns  her to resist his persuasions to illicit consummation of their love.  If she  dreams she is drunk, she will yield up her favors without strong persuasion.  (This dream typifies that you are likely to waste your energies in pleasure.)    _Abundance_.    To dream that you are possessed with an abundance;  foretells that you will have no occasion to reproach Fortune,  and that you will be independent of her future favors;  but your domestic happiness may suffer a collapse under the strain  you are likely to put upon it by your infidelity.    _Abuse_.    To dream of abusing a person, means that you will be unfortunate  in your affairs, losing good money through over-bearing persistency  in business relations with others.    To feel yourself abused, you will be molested in your daily pursuits  by the enmity of others.    For a young woman to dream that she hears abusive language, foretells that  she will fall under the ban of some person's jealousy and envy.  If she uses the language herself, she will meet with unexpected rebuffs,  that may fill her with mortification and remorse for her past unworthy  conduct toward friends.    _Abyss_.    To dream of looking into an abyss, means that you will be confronted  by threats of seizure of property, and that there will be quarrels  and reproaches of a personal nature which will unfit you to meet  the problems of life.    For a woman to be looking into an abyss, foretells that she will  burden herself with unwelcome cares.  If she falls into the abyss  her disappointment will be complete; but if she succeeds in crossing,  or avoiding it, she will reinstate herself.    _Academy_.    To visit an academy in your dreams, denotes that you will regret opportunities  that you have let pass through sheer idleness and indifference.    To think you own, or are an inmate of one, you will find that you  are to meet easy defeat of aspirations.  You will take on knowledge,  but be unable to rightly assimilate and apply it.    For a young woman or any person to return to an academy after having  finished there, signifies that demands will be made which the dreamer  may find himself or her self unable to meet.    _Accepted_.[6]    For a business man to dream that his proposition has been accepted,  foretells that he will succeed in making a trade, which heretofore  looked as if it would prove a failure.    For a lover to dream that he has been accepted by his sweetheart,  denotes that he will happily wed the object of his own  and others' admiration.    [6] If this dream has been occasioned by overanxiety and weakness,  the contrary may be expected.  The elementary influences often play  pranks upon weak and credulous minds by lying, and deceptive utterances.  Therefore the dreamer should live a pure life, fortified by a strong will,  thus controlling his destiny by expelling from it involuntary intrusions.    _Accident_.    To dream of an accident is a warning to avoid any mode of travel  for a short period, as you are threatened with loss of life.    For an accident to befall stock, denotes that you will struggle  with all your might to gain some object and then see some friend  lose property of the same value in aiding your cause.    _Accordion_.    To dream of hearing the music of an accordion, denotes that you will  engage in amusement which will win you from sadness and retrospection.  You will by this means be enabled to take up your burden more cheerfully.    For a young woman to dream that she is playing an accordion,  portends that she will win her lover by some sad occurrence;  but, notwithstanding which, the same will confer lasting  happiness upon her union.  If the accordion gets out of tune,  she will be saddened by the illness or trouble of her lover.    _Accounts_.    To dream of having accounts presented to you for payment,  you will be in a dangerous position.  You may have recourse  to law to disentangle yourself.  If you pay the accounts,  you will soon effect a compromise in some serious dispute.    To hold accounts against others, foretells that disagreeable contingencies  will arise in your business, marring the smoothness of its management.    For a young woman book-keeper to dream of footing up accounts,  denotes that she will have trouble in business, and in her love affairs;  but some worthy person will persuade her to account for his happiness.  She will be much respected by her present employers.    _Accuse_.[7]    To dream that you accuse any one of a mean action, denotes that you  will have quarrels with those under you, and your dignity will be thrown  from a high pedestal.    If you are accused, you are in danger of being guilty of distributing  scandal in a sly and malicious way.    [7] See similar words in following chapters.    _Aches_.[8]    To dream that you have aches, denotes that you are halting too  much in your business, and that some other person is profiting  by your ideas.    For a young woman to dream that she has the heartache, foretells that she will  be in sore distress over the laggardly way her lover prosecutes his suit.  If it is the backache, she will encounter illness through careless exposure.  If she has the headache, there will be much disquietude of mind for the risk  she has taken to rid herself of rivalry.    [8] This dream is usually due to physical causes and is  of little significance.    _Acid_.    To drink any acid is an adverse dream, bringing you much anxiety.    For a woman to drink aciduous liquors, denotes that she may ensnare  herself with compromising situations; even health may be involved.    To see poisonous acids, some treachery against you may be discovered.    _Acorn_.    Seeing acorns in dreams, is portent of pleasant things ahead,  and much gain is to be expected.    To pick them from the ground, foretells success after weary labors.    For a woman to eat them, denotes that she will rise from a station of labor  to a position of ease and pleasure.    To shake them from the trees, denotes that you will rapidly attain  your wishes in business or love.    To see green-growing acorns, or to see them scattered over the ground,  affairs will change for the better.  Decayed or blasted acorns have import  of disappointments and reverses.    To pull them green from the trees, you will injure your interests  by haste and indiscretion.    _Acquaintance_.[9]    To meet an acquaintance, and converse pleasantly with him,  foretells that your business will run smoothly, and there  will be but little discord in your domestic affairs.    If you seem to be disputing, or engaged in loud talk, humiliations and  embarrassments will whirl seethingly around you.    If you feel ashamed of meeting an acquaintance, or meet him  at an inopportune time, it denotes that you will be guilty  of illicitly conducting yourself, and other parties will let  the secret out.    For a young woman to think that she has an extensive"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9368"],[0,"Welsh Fairy Tales (#9)"],[1,"another neighborhood. There he lay in wait for a girl to come  along. He then ran away with her, and back to his own daddy's cave.    By and by, when the Cymry came into the land, they had iron tools and  better weapons of war. Then there were many and long battles and the  aborigines were beaten many times.    So the cave people hated everything made of iron. Anyone of the cave  people, girls or boys, who had picked up iron ornaments, and were  found wearing or using iron tools, or buying anything of iron from the  cave people's enemies, was looked upon as a rascal, or a villain, or  even as a traitor and was driven out of the tribe.    However, some of the daughters of the cave men were so pretty and had  such rosy cheeks, and lovely bodies, and beautiful, long hair, that  quite often the Cymric youth fell in love with them.    Many of the cave men's daughters were captured and became wives of the  Cymry and mothers of children. In course of ages, their descendants  helped to make the bright, witty, song-loving Welsh people.    Now the fairies usually like things that are old, and they are very  slow to alter the ancient customs, to which they have been used; for,  in the fairy world, there is no measure of time, nor any clocks,  watches, or bells to strike the hours, and no almanacs or calendars.    The fairies cannot understand why ladies change the fashions so often,  and the men their ways of doing things. They wonder why beards are  fashionable at one time; then, moustaches long or short, at another;  or smooth faces when razors are cheap. Most fairies like to keep on  doing the same thing in the old way. They enjoy being like the  mountains, which stand; or the sea, that rolls; or the sun, that rises  and sets every day and forever. They never get tired of repeating  to-morrow what they did yesterday. They are very different from the  people that are always wanting something else, and even cry if they  cannot have it.    That is the reason why the fairies did not like iron, or to see men  wearing iron hats and clothes, called helmets and armor, when they  went to war. They no more wanted to be touched by iron than by filth,  or foul disease. They hated knives, stirrups, scythes, swords, pots,  pans, kettles, or this metal in any form, whether sheet, barbed wire,  lump or pig iron.    Now there was a long, pretty stretch of water, near which lived a  handsome lad, who loved nothing better than to go out on moonlight  nights and see the fairies dance, or listen to their music. This youth  fell in love with one of these fairies, whose beauty was great beyond  description. At last, unable to control his passion, he rushed into  the midst of the fairy company, seized the beautiful one, and rushed  back to his home, with his prize in his arms. This was in true  cave-man fashion. When the other fairies hurried to rescue her, they  found the man's house shut. They dared not touch the door, for it was  covered over with iron studs and bands, and bolted with the metal  which they most abhorred.    The young man immediately began to make love to the fairy maid, hoping  to win her to be his wife. For a long time she refused, and moped all  day and night. While weeping many salt water tears, she declared that  she was too homesick to live.    Nevertheless the lover persevered. Finding herself locked in with iron  bars, while gratings, bolts and creaking hinges were all about her,  and unable to return to her people, the fairy first thought out a plan  of possible escape. Then she agreed to become the man's wife. She  resolved, at least, that, without touching it, she should oil all the  iron work, and stop the noise.    She was a smart fairy, and was sure she could outwit the man, even if  he were so strong, and had every sort of iron everywhere in order to  keep her as it were in a prison. So, pretending she loved him dearly,  she said: \"I will not be your wife, but, if you can find out my name,  I shall gladly become your servant.\"    \"Easily won,\" thought the lover to himself. Yet the game was a harder  one to play than he supposed. It was like playing Blind Man's Buff, or  Hunt the Slipper. Although he made guesses of every name he could  think of, he was never \"hot\" and got no nearer to the thing sought  than if his eyes were bandaged. All the time, he was deeper and deeper  in love with the lovely fairy maid.    But one night, on returning home, he saw in a turf bog, a group of  fairies sitting on a log. At once, he thought, they might be talking  about their lost sister. So he crept up quite near them, and soon  found that he had guessed right. After a long discussion, finding  themselves still at a loss, as to how to recover her, he heard one of  them sigh and say, \"Oh, Siwsi, my sister, how can you live with a  mortal?\"    \"Enough,\" said the young man to himself. \"I've got it.\" Then, crawling  away noiselessly, he ran back all the way to his house, and unlocked  the door. Once inside the room, he called out his servant's  name--\"Siwsi! Siwsi!\"    Astonished at hearing her name, she cried out, \"What mortal has  betrayed me? For, surely no fairy would tell on me? Alas, my fate, my  fate!\"    But in her own mind, the struggle and the fear were over. She had  bravely striven to keep her fairyhood, and in the battle of wits, had  lost.    She would not be wife, but what a wise, superb and faithful servant  she made!    Everything prospered under her hand. The house and the farm became  models. Not twice, but three times a day, the cows, milked by her,  yielded milk unusually rich in cream. In the market, her butter  excelled, in quality and price, all others.    Meanwhile, the passion of the lover abated not one jot, or for an  instant. His perseverance finally won. She agreed to become his wife;  but only on one condition.    \"You must never strike me with iron,\" she said. \"If you do, I'll feel  free to leave you, and go back to my relatives in the fairy family.\"    A hearty laugh from the happy lover greeted this remark, made by the  lovely creature, once his servant, but now his betrothed. He thought  that the condition was very easy to obey.    So they were married, and no couple in all the land seemed to be  happier. Once, twice, the cradle was filled. It rocked with new  treasures that had life, and were more dear than farm, or home, or  wealth in barns or cattle, cheese and butter. A boy and a girl were  theirs. Then the mother's care was unremitting, day and night.    Even though the happy father grew richer every year, and bought farm  after farm, until he owned five thousand acres, he valued, more than  these possessions, his lovely wife and his beautiful children.    Yet this very delight and affection made him less vigilant; yes, even  less careful concerning the promise he had once given to his fairy  wife, who still held to the ancient ideas of the Fairy Family in  regard to iron.    One of his finest mares had given birth to a filly, which, when the  day of the great fair came, he determined to sell at a high price.    So with a halter on his arm, he went out to catch her.    But she was a lively creature, so frisky that it was much like his  first attempt to win his fairy bride. It almost looked as if she were  a cave girl running away from a lover, who had a lasso in his hand.  The lively and frolicsome beast scampered here and there, grazing as  she stopped, as if she were determined to put off her capture as long  as possible.    So, calling to his wife, the two of them together, tried their skill  to catch the filly. This time, leaving the halter in the house, the  man took bit and bridle, and the two managed to get the pretty  creature into a corner; but, when they had almost captured her, away  she dashed again.    By this time, the man was so vexed that he lost his temper; and he who  does that, usually loses the game, while he who controls the wrath  within, wins. Mad as a flaming fire, he lost his brains also and threw  bit and bridle and the whole harness after the fleet animal.    Alas! alas! the wife had started to run after the filly and the iron  bit struck her on the cheek. It did not hurt, but he had broken his  vow.    Now came the surprise of his life. It was as if, at one moment, a  flash of lightning had made all things bright; and then in another  second was inky darkness. He saw this lovely wife, one moment active  and fleet as a deer. In another, in the twinkling of an eye, nothing  was there. She had vanished. After this, there was a lonely home,  empty of its light and cheer.    But by living with human beings, a new idea and form of life had  transformed this fairy, and a new spell was laid on her. Mother-love  had been awakened in her heart. Henceforth, though the law of the  fairy world would not allow her to touch again the realm of earth,  she, having once been wife and parent, could not forget the babies  born of her body. So, making a sod raft, a floating island, she came  up at night, and often, while these three mortals lived, this fairy  mother would spend hours tenderly talking to her husband and her two  children, who were now big boy and girl, as they stood on the lake  shore.    On his part, the father did not think it \"an ideal arrangement,\" as  some modern married folks do, to be thus separated, wife and husband,  one from the other; but by her coming as near as could be allowed, she  showed her undying love. Even to-day, good people sometimes see a  little island floating on the lake, and this, they point out as the  place where the fairy mother was wont to come and hold converse with  her dear ones. When they merrily eat the pink delicacy, called  \"floating island,\" moving it about with a spoon on its yellow lake of  eggs and cream, they call this \"the Fairy Mother's rocking chair.\"          X      THE MAIDEN OF THE GREEN FOREST      Many a palace lies under the waves that wash Cymric land, for the sea  has swallowed up more than one village, and"]]]
