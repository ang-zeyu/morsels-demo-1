[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46202"],[0,"A New Witness for God (Volume 1 of 3) (#9)"],[1,"and Fox, have sought to  magnify it. The motive on the part of both infidels and Christians is  obvious. The more violent and extensive the persecutions, the more  the martyrs, the more glorious the triumph for the church. While on  the other hand, if the persecutions can be proven to be limited, the  suffering made to appear trifling and the martyrs few in number, the  church is robbed of so much of her glory. Doubtless both parties have  gone to extremes in the contention. Unfortunately for the Christian  side of the controversy, there is much reason for believing that the  account of Christian suffering within the period named has been much  exaggerated. Their chief authority--Eusebius--has thrown more or  less suspicion upon the trustworthiness of all that he has written,  by declaring in the opening chapter of his Ecclesiastical History  and elsewhere that \"Whatsoever, therefore, _we deem likely to be  advantageous to the proposed subject_, we shall endeavor to reduce  to a compact body by historical narration. For this purpose we have  collected the materials that have been scattered by our predecessors,  and culled, as from some intellectual meadows, the appropriate extracts  from ancient authors.\" [2]    On these passages Gibbon remarks: \"The gravest of the ecclesiastical  historians, Eusebius himself, indirectly confesses that he has related  whatever might redound to the glory, and that he has suppressed all  that could tend to the disgrace of religion. Such an acknowledgment  will naturally excite a suspicion that a writer who has so openly  violated one of the fundamental laws of history, has not paid a very  strict regard to the observance of the other.\" [3] Draper also refers  to the same when, commenting upon the inaccuracies of early Christian  writers, he says: \"In historical compositions there was a want of  fair dealing and truthfulness almost incredible to us; thus, Eusebius  naively avows that in his history he shall omit whatever might tend to  the discredit of the church, and magnify whatever might conduce to her  glory.\" [4]    But while it must be conceded that there is much reason for believing  that the Christian fathers exaggerated both the extent and severity  of those early persecutions, it remains clear that both the extent  and severity of them were greater and more baneful to the church than  infidel writers allow; and the truth of it may be proven independent  of the testimonies of the Christian fathers. The proofs I refer to  are the edicts themselves, considered in the light of the well-known  cruelty of the Roman people, intensified by the malice of religious  zeal aroused to suppress an obnoxious society whose doctrines were held  to be destructive of the ancient religion of Rome, and a menace to the  existence of the state itself.    Passing by the persecutions inflicted upon the Christians by the  Jews, an account of which is to be found in the New Testament, I call  attention to the first great pagan persecution under the cruel edict of  the Emperor Nero. For our information in respect to this persecution we  are indebted not to any Christian writer, but to the judicious Tacitus,  whom even \"the most sceptical criticism is obliged to respect.\" [5]  Nero having set on fire the city of Rome, in order that he might  witness a great conflagration, and wishing to divert suspicion from  himself, first accused and then tried to compel the Christians to  confess the great crime--and now Tacitus:    \"With this view he inflicted the most exquisite tortures on those men  who, under the vulgar appellation of Christians, were already branded  with deserved infamy. They derived their name and origin from Christ,  who, in the reign of Tiberius had suffered death by the sentence of  the procurator Pontius Pilate. For awhile this dire superstition was  checked; but it again burst forth; and not only spread itself over  Judea, the first seat of this mischievous sect, but was even introduced  into Rome, the common asylum which receives and protects whatever is  impure, whatever is atrocious. The confessions of those that were  seized discovered a great multitude of their accomplices, and they were  all convicted, not so much for the crime of setting fire to the city,  as for their hatred of human kind. They died in torments, and their  torments were embittered by insults and derision. Some were nailed on  crosses; others sewn up in the skins of wild beasts, and exposed to the  fury of dogs; others, again, smeared over with combustible materials,  were used as torches to illuminate the darkness of the night. The  gardens of Nero were destined for the melancholy spectacle, which was  accompanied with a horse-race, and honored with the presence of the  emperor, who mingled with the populace in the dress and attitude of  a charioteer. The guilt of the Christians deserved indeed the most  exemplary punishments, but the public abhorrence was changed into  commiseration, from the opinion that those unhappy wretches were  sacrificed, not so much to the public welfare as to the cruelty of a  jealous tyrant.\" [6]    Eminent scholars are divided in opinion as to whether this persecution  under Nero extended to the provinces or was confined to the city  of Rome. Gibbon assumes that it was both brief and confined to the  city. According to Milman \"M. Guizot, on the authority of Suplicious  Severus and of Orosius inclines to the opinion of those who extend the  persecution to the provinces. Mosheim rather leans to that side on this  much disputed question. Neander takes the view of Gibbon, which is, in  general, that of the most learned writers.\" [7]    This controversy need not detain us a moment. It matters not to my  purpose whether the edicts of Nero extended to the provinces or were  limited in their operations to the Christians within the capital.  The testimony of Tacitus is sufficient to prove, first, that the  persecution was general within the city; second its terrible cruelty;  and third, the great abhorrence in which the Christians were held by  the Romans.    I submit to the consideration of the reader that a people so greatly  detested as the Christians, were not likely to meet with gentle  treatment from the Romans; and when, as subsequently it came to  pass, the people clamored for the sacrifice of the saints whom they  abhorred as the enemies of mankind, instead of looking upon them with  commiseration as the citizens of Rome did in their persecution under  Nero--when the Roman people, I say, clamored for the sacrifice of  the Christians and the emperors were cruel enough, and unjust enough  to issue edicts for their destruction, the persecutions of those  times were neither so limited nor so free from severity as Gibbon and  others would have us believe. Even in this persecution under Nero, if  no edicts were sent into the provinces commanding the execution of  Christians, it is not unreasonable to believe that the despisers of  the followers of Christ, finding warrant for their conduct by what was  taking place at Rome, under the supervision of the emperor himself,  would not hesitate to inflict hardships upon the saints without the  formality of his proclamation.    It was this unofficial persecution which, without doubt, arose in the  provinces as an indirect result of the persecution in the capital,  that has led a number of prominent writers to believe that Nero's  persecution extended throughout the empire. However that may be, a  \"great multitude\" suffered in the city of Rome, and were subject to  such tortures and cruel modes of death--described, mark you, by the  unfriendly Tacitus--that little is left to be added even by the fervid  imaginations of the Christian fathers. It is reasonable to believe  that the subsequent persecutions were not freer from cruelty than this  one under Nero; and therefore, though some allowance must be made  for exaggeration in the writings of the Christian fathers, it may be  safely concluded that those persecutions which preceded the reign of  Constantine were both widespread and horribly cruel.    What is usually denominated the third persecution of the Christian  Church occurred in the reign of Trajan, 98--117 A. D. Here, as in the  persecution under Nero, we may determine something of the severity and  manner of it from a Roman writer. Trajan intrusted the government of  Bithynia and Pontius to his personal friend, the younger Pliny. The new  governor, in his administration of the affairs of his provinces, found  himself perplexed as to what course he should pursue in regard to the  Christians brought before him for trial. He accordingly wrote to his  master for instruction; and I deem his letter of such importance as  showing the severity to which Christians were subject, the character of  the Christians, and the number of unfaithful members who had evidently  entered the church by that time, that I give it _in extenso_:    \"Health.--It is my usual custom, sir, to refer all things, of which I  harbor any doubts, to you. For who can better direct my judgment in  its hesitation, or instruct my understanding in its ignorance? I never  had the fortune to be present at any examination of Christians, before  I came into this province. I am, therefore, at a loss, to determine  what is the usual object either of inquiry or of punishment, and to  what length either of them is to be carried. It has also been with me  a question very problematical, whether any distinction should be made  between the young and the old, the tender and the robust; whether any  room should be given for repentance, or the guilt of Christianity, once  incurred is not to be expiated by the most unequivocal retraction;  whether the name itself, abstracted from any flagitiousness of conduct,  or the crimes connected with the name, be the object of punishment. In  the meantime, this has been my method, with respect to those who were  brought before me as Christians: If they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46237"],[0,"The Romance of Book-Collecting (#9)"],[1,"in that city, in pamphlet form, under  the title of 'The Queens' Gardens.'  He is also aware that only three  copies of the pamphlet are known to exist, and if he is very well  informed indeed he will know who has them, and where they got them from,  and at what price.  A portion of this information was in the possession  of a member at Bath, who, as he said, had accidentally discovered a copy  of the 'book' in a parcel of odds and ends that was to be sold by  auction the following day.  In his letter he requested a reply by  telegram first thing in the morning saying to what price he was to go,  as he had reason to believe that other persons beside himself were aware  of the circumstance. There was no time for explanations, so the wire was  sent, though the word 'book' came with a very suspicious ring.  It was  as well perhaps that the limit was intentionally put low, or there is no  telling to what absurd price the parcel of miscellanea might not have  been forced by his eagerness.  As it was, it was bought for L2 10s., or  about six or seven times as much as it was worth, for 'The Queens'  Gardens' was not the coveted pamphlet at all, but the book known as  'Sesame and Lilies' (and not even the first edition of that), published  by Smith, Elder and Co. in 1865, which contains the reprints of the two  lectures (1) 'Of Kings' Treasuries,' (2) 'Of Queens' Gardens.'  It was  evident that this sort of thing had only to become general and the  society would be ruined, for all payments came from the common fund.  When the error was pointed out, the member cavilled and argued, but  could not be convinced.  He was certain that he had bought the true and  original 'Queens' Gardens,' and darkly hinted at secession.    On another occasion a member bought 'Friendship's Offering,' for 1840,  merely because it contains 'The Scythian Guest.'  He, too, could not be  persuaded that the error was his rather than that of the bookseller who  sold it him. Times without number one edition was mistaken for another;  over and over again were imperfect or tattered volumes bought at prices  that would have been impossible but for the London treasury of this  secret society.  'No good comes,' says old John Hill Burton, 'no good  comes of gentlemen buying and selling'--a dictum which was manifestly  applicable here.  Had the confident purchaser of 'Queens' Gardens' been  confronted with Nichols's 'Herald and Genealogist,' he would have been  in his element, for he was an adept in the lore of armorials and  pedigrees, and had a fine collection of volumes of that kind.  Outside  these subjects he knew but little, which for all practical purposes is  infinitely worse than knowing nothing at all.    Another grievous error resulted in the purchase of Shakespeare's 'Venus  and Adonis,' 'The Rape of Lucrece,' 'The Passionate Pilgrim,' and  'Sonnets to Sundry Notes of Musick,' at a good round sum.  The pieces  were bound up together in dilapidated calf, and as each had a separate  pagination there may have been just a shadow of excuse for the payment  of L2, which was the price demanded.  But this book was merely Lintott's  first collected edition, a work which might have been manufactured  expressly for the behoof of innocent purchasers, so antiquated and  primitive does it look.  Had it been Cote's collected edition of 1640,  instead of Lintott's comparatively worthless, and certainly very  careless, production, which he took good care not to date, all would  have been well; but this was never at any time likely to be the case,  for the price was dead against a supposition of the kind.  Price is,  indeed, often a most valuable guide to the real worth of a book; though  this is not always the case, as the following anecdote of a circumstance  that happened to myself abundantly proves.  I took the greatest pains to  trace every step in the history I am about to unfold, and know that the  details are true.    It is the custom of many booksellers to send out their catalogues in  alphabetical order, and had only my name been Abbot, or even Abrahams,  this account of an accident which can hardly fade from my memory would  probably have never been written.  The Forgotten Lore Society would have  reaped most of the benefit certainly, but, on the other hand, I should  have been rich in the consciousness of having obtained for a mere trifle  one of the finest known copies of an extremely rare piece, and one of  the few of any quality that have ever come into the market at any price.    The society had not been in working order a month, when one of those  extraordinary strokes of luck which often fall to the share of the  gambler at the commencement of his career, and as certainly desert him  at the end of it, happened to me.  It was brought late one evening by a  bookseller's catalogue which I, being much occupied at the time, threw  aside till a more convenient season.  They say that strange  psychological influences often work out the destiny of men, although  they know it not, and some such influence must have been haunting me  then, for contrary to all custom, and notwithstanding the fact that to  catch the last post was a matter of imperative necessity, I found that  the catalogue had an altogether exceptional if not unique attraction.  Do what I might, I could not forget its existence, nor could I make  satisfactory progress with the work which had, whether I liked it or  not, to be finished and out of the house half an hour before midnight at  the latest.  So the catalogue was opened, curiously enough, at a place  at which there was no reason it should open, for after a while I lost it  and had some difficulty in finding it again.  It had opened, however, at  page 8, and the first entry that caught my eye was this, word for word  exactly:      114. Hornem (Horace) The Waltz: an Apostrophic Hymn.  By Horace Hornem,  Esq.: 410., 1813, unbound. 3s. 6d.      Now, there are, of course, two early editions of 'The Waltz,' one the  quarto above-named, and the other an octavo published in 1821, and it  was quite likely, and indeed more than probable, that the bookseller,  with his mind's eye fixed on the excessively scarce issue of 1813, might  have unconsciously written it down instead of the comparatively common  octavo.  Another hypothesis suggested itself, namely, that the entry was  designed to bring customers to his place of business, and that 'The  Waltz' of 1813 had no existence there in fact.  Such devices for making  trade are not unknown, and this might very well be one of them.  Nevertheless, I determined to test the matter, and though the laugh is  greatly to my discomfort even at this distance of time, I do not mind  admitting that I was, metaphorically speaking, glued to the doorstep  long before the shop opened in the morning.  To sit there in reality I  could not for shame, so I walked about Oxford Street within bowshot,  ready to besiege the door in case any other snapper-up of unconsidered  trifles should show an anxiety to forestall his brethren of the chase.  Even when the shop opened, I did not walk in immediately, nor when there  did I brutally ask point-blank for the coveted treasure.  An uneasy  conscience pointed out that, if there were anything in the matter, too  great an anxiety might give rise to suspicion, and 'The Waltz' would in  that case be difficult to find.  I bought another book, which I did not  want, and not till then suggested number 114.    'Gone,' said the clerk, looking at his copy of the catalogue.    'Gone?' said I.    'Yes,' he replied, 'sold yesterday.'    I thought at the time that a trace of a smile played about the corners  of his mouth as he said this, and I should not wonder if that were so,  for the bookseller afterwards told me that his place had been besieged  for many days by hungry bookworms, who had sauntered in one after the  other in the most careless manner imaginable, and asked for this very  'Waltz.'  'They positively danced on the pavement,' he said, 'when they  found it had gone,' and with this small joke he was fain to mollify  himself, for it was the literal truth that in an evil moment he had sold  a pearl of great price for the beggarly sum of 3s. 6d.  He did not know  to whom; he had never seen the man before, and 'in all probability,' he  added with a sigh, 'I shall never see him again.'    The subsequent history of one of the finest, if not the finest, copies  of Byron's quarto 'Waltz' in existence is as follows: The original  purchaser sold it to a dabbler in books for 10s., and he in his turn  disposed of it for L4 to a man who, though not a bookseller,  occasionally acted as such, and was thoroughly conversant with every  move of the market.  He had no difficulty in selling it by telegram, and  the price paid--L60--was not, under the circumstances, in the least too  high, for the copy was as fresh and clean as when it left the publishing  offices of Sherwood, Neely, and Jones more than eighty years ago, and  had not been tampered with in any way.    The suggestion that the price demanded for a book is often a test of its  real worth is both proved and avoided by this story.  As I did not, as  it happened, secure the 'Waltz,' I feel sorry for the bookseller, and  would point out to him that it is impossible for anyone, bookseller or  not, to be acquainted with every volume and pamphlet that has ever been  published.  He made a mistake of such grave consequences to himself that  he is not at all likely to make another of the same kind.  His sin  merely consisted in either not knowing who 'Horace Hornem, Esq.,' really  was, or more probably in momentarily and yet irrevocably confusing that  pseudonym with some other which he may have had in his mind at the time.  This is a very common source of error, and very probably accounts for  the incident.  On the other hand, the action of the intermediate holder  in selling the book for L4 is inexplicable and inexcusable.  Had he said  "]]]
