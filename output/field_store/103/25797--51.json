In due time Tom and his party found themselves safely housed in the  small hotel at Puerto Cortes, their belongings stored in a convenient  warehouse and themselves, rather weary by reason of the stress of  weather, ready for the start into the interior wilds of Honduras.    \"How are we going to make the trip?\" asked Ned, as they sat at supper,  the first night after their arrival, eating of several dishes, the  red-pepper condiments of which caused frequent trips to the water  pitcher.    \"We can go in two ways, and perhaps we shall find it to our advantage  to use both means,\" said Professor Bumper.  \"To get to this city of  Kurzon,\" he proceeded in a low voice, so that none of the others in the  dining-room would hear them, \"we will have to go either by mule back or  boat to a point near Copan.  As near as I can tell by the ancient maps,  Kurzon is in the Copan valley.    \"Now the Chamelecon river seems to run to within a short distance of  there, but there is no telling how far up it may be navigable.  If we  can go by boat it will be much more comfortable.  Travel by mules and  ox-carts is slow and sure, but the roads are very bad, as I have heard  from friends who have made explorations in Honduras.    \"And, as I said, we may have to use both land and water travel to get  us where we want to go.  We can proceed as far as possible up the  river, and then take to the mules.\"    \"What about arranging for boats and animals?\" asked Tom.  \"I should  think----\"    He suddenly ceased talking and reached for the water, taking several  large swallows.    \"Whew!\" he exclaimed, when he could catch his breath.  \"That was a hot  one.\"    \"What did you do?\" asked Ned.    \"Bit into a nest of red pepper.  Guess I'll have to tell that cook to  scatter his hits.  He's bunching 'em too much in my direction,\" and Tom  wiped the tears from his eyes.    \"To answer your question,\" said Professor Bumper, \"I will say that I  have made partial arrangements for men and animals, and boats if it is  found feasible to use them.  I've been in correspondence with one of  the merchants here, and he promised to make arrangements for us.\"    \"When do we leave?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"As soon as possible.  I am not going to risk anything by delay,\" and  it was evident the professor referred to his young rival whose arrival  might be expected almost any time.    As the party was about to leave the table, they were approached by a  tall, dignified Spaniard who bowed low, rather exaggeratedly low, Ned  thought, and addressed them in fairly good English.    \"Your pardons, Senors,\" he began, \"but if it will please you to avail  yourself of the humble services of myself, I shall have great pleasure  in guiding you into the interior.  I have at my command both mules and  boats.\"    \"How do you know we are going into the interior?\" asked Tom, a bit  sharply, for he did not like the assurance of the man.    \"Pardon, Senor.  I saw that you are from the States.  And those from  the States do not come to Honduras except for two reasons.  To travel  and make explorations or to start trade, and professors do not usually  engage in trade,\" and he bowed to Professor Bumper.    \"I saw your name on the register,\" he proceeded, \"and it was not  difficult to guess your mission,\" and he flashed a smile on the party,  his white teeth showing brilliantly beneath his small, black moustache.    \"I make it my business to outfit traveling parties, either for  business, pleasure or scientific matters.  I am, at your service, Val  Jacinto,\" and he introduced himself with another low bow.    For a moment Tom and his friends hardly knew how to accept this offer.  It might be, as the man had said, that he was a professional tour  conductor, like those who have charge of Egyptian donkey-boys and  guides.  Or might he not be a spy?    This occurred to Tom no less than to Professor Bumper.  They looked at  one another while Val Jacinto bowed again and murmured:    \"At your service!\"    \"Can you provide means for taking us to the Copan valley?\" asked the  professor.  \"You are right in one respect.  I am a scientist and I  purpose doing some exploring near Copan.  Can you get us there?\"    \"Most expensively--I mean, most expeditionlessly,\" said Val Jacinto  eagerly.  \"Pardon my unhappy English.  I forget at times.  The charges  will be most moderate.  I can send you by boat as far as the river  travel is good, and then have mules and ox-carts in waiting.\"    \"How far is it?\" asked Tom.    \"A hundred miles as the vulture flies, Senor, but much farther by river  and road.  We shall be a week going.\"    \"A hundred miles in a week!\" groaned Ned.  \"Say, Tom, if you had your  aeroplane we'd be there in an hour.\"    \"Yes, but we haven't it.  However, we're in no great rush.\"    \"But we must not lose time,\" said Professor Bumper.  \"I shall consider  your offer,\" he added to Val Jacinto.    \"Very good, Senor.  I am sure you will be pleased with the humble  service I may offer you, and my charges will be small.  Adios,\" and he  bowed himself away.    \"What do you think of him?\" asked Ned, as they went up to their rooms  in the hotel, or rather one large room, containing several beds.    \"He's a pretty slick article,\" said Mr. Damon.  \"Bless my check-book!  but he spotted us at once, in spite of our secrecy.\"    \"I guess these guide purveyors are trained for that sort of thing,\"  observed the scientist.  \"I know my friends have often spoken of having  had the same experience.  However, I shall ask my friend, who is in  business here, about this Val Jacinto, and if I find him all right we  may engage him.\"    Inquiries next morning brought the information, from the head of a  rubber exporting firm with whom the professor was acquainted, that the  Spaniard was regularly engaged in transporting parties into the  interior, and was considered efficient, careful and as honest as  possible, considering the men he engaged as workers.    \"So we have decided to engage you,\" Professor Bumper informed Val  Jacinto the afternoon following the meeting.    \"I am more than pleased, Senor.  I shall take you into the wilds of  Honduras.  At your service!\" and he bowed low.    \"Humph! I don't just like the way our friend Val says that,\" observed  Tom to Ned a little later.  \"I'd have been better pleased if he had  said he'd guide us into the wilds and out again.\"    If Tom could have seen the crafty smile on the face of the Spaniard as  the man left the hotel, the young inventor might have felt even less  confidence in the guide.          CHAPTER X    IN THE WILDS      \"All aboard! Step lively now! This boat makes no stops this side of  Boston!\" cried Ned Newton gaily, as he got into one of the several tree  canoes provided for the transportation of the party up the Chamelecon  river, for the first stage of their journey into the wilds of Honduras.  \"All aboard! This reminds me of my old camping days, Tom.\"    It brought those days back, in a measure, to Tom also.  For there were  a number of canoes filled with the goods of the party, while the  members themselves occupied a larger one with their personal baggage.  Strong, half-naked Indian paddlers were in charge of the canoes which  were of sturdy construction and light draft, since the river, like most  tropical streams, was of uncertain depths, choked here and there with  sand bars or tropical growths.    Finding that Val Jacinto was regularly engaged in the business of  taking explorers and mine prospectors into the interior, Professor  Bumper had engaged the man.  He seemed to be efficient.  At the  promised time he had the canoes and paddlers on hand and the goods  safely stowed away while one big craft was fitted up as comfortably as  possible for the men of the party.    As Ned remarked, it did look like a camping party, for in the canoes  were tents, cooking utensils and, most important, mosquito canopies of  heavy netting.    The insect pests of Honduras, as in all tropical countries, are  annoying and dangerous.  Therefore it was imperative to sleep under  mosquito netting.    On the advice of Val Jacinto, who was to accompany them, the travelers  were to go up the river about fifty miles.  This was as far as it would  be convenient to use the canoes, the guide told Tom and his friends,  and from there on the trip to the Copan valley would be made on the  backs of mules, which would carry most of the baggage and equipment.  The heavier portions would be transported in ox-carts.    As Professor Bumper expected to do considerable excavating in order to  locate the buried city, or cities, as the case might be, he had to  contract for a number of Indian diggers and laborers.  These could be  hired in Copan, it was said.    The plan, therefore, was to travel by canoes during the less heated  parts of the day, and tie up at night, making camp on shore in the  net-protected tents.  As for the Indians, they did not seem to mind the  bites of the insects.  They sometimes made a smudge fire, Val Jacinto  had said, but that was all.    \"Well, we haven't seen anything of Beecher and his friends,\" remarked  the young inventor as they were about to start.    \"No, he doesn't seem to have arrived,\" agreed Professor Bumper.  \"We'll  get ahead of him, and so much the better.    \"Well, are we all ready to start?\" he continued, as he looked over the  little flotilla which carried his party and his goods.    \"The sooner the better!\" cried Tom, and Ned fancied his chum was  unusually eager.    \"I guess he wants to make good before Beecher gets the chance to show  Mary Nestor what he can do,\" thought Ned.  \"Tom sure is after that idol  of gold.\"    \"You may start, Senor Jacinto,\" said the professor, and the guide  called something in Indian dialect to the rowers.  Lines were cast off  and the boats moved out into the stream under "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5000"],[0,"The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (#9)"],[1," MS.]    62.    Every point is the termination of an infinite number of lines, which  diverge to form a base, and immediately, from the base the same  lines converge to a pyramid [imaging] both the colour and form. No  sooner is a form created or compounded than suddenly infinite lines  and angles are produced from it; and these lines, distributing  themselves and intersecting each other in the air, give rise to an  infinite number of angles opposite to each other. Given a base, each  opposite angle, will form a triangle having a form and proportion  equal to the larger angle; and if the base goes twice into each of  the 2 lines of the pyramid the smaller triangle will do the same.    63.    Every body in light and shade fills the surrounding air with  infinite images of itself; and these, by infinite pyramids diffused  in the air, represent this body throughout space and on every side.  Each pyramid that is composed of a long assemblage of rays includes  within itself an infinite number of pyramids and each has the same  power as all, and all as each. A circle of equidistant pyramids of  vision will give to their object angles of equal size; and an eye at  each point will see the object of the same size. The body of the  atmosphere is full of infinite pyramids composed of radiating  straight lines, which are produced from the surface of the bodies in  light and shade, existing in the air; and the farther they are from  the object which produces them the more acute they become and  although in their distribution they intersect and cross they never  mingle together, but pass through all the surrounding air,  independently converging, spreading, and diffused. And they are all  of equal power [and value]; all equal to each, and each equal to  all. By these the images of objects are transmitted through all  space and in every direction, and each pyramid, in itself, includes,  in each minutest part, the whole form of the body causing it.    64.    The body of the atmosphere is full of infinite radiating pyramids  produced by the objects existing in it. These intersect and cross  each other with independent convergence without interfering with  each other and pass through all the surrounding atmosphere; and are  of equal force and value--all being equal to each, each to all. And  by means of these, images of the body are transmitted everywhere and  on all sides, and each receives in itself every minutest portion of  the object that produces it.    Proof by experiment (65-66).    65.    PERSPECTIVE.    The air is filled with endless images of the objects distributed in  it; and all are represented in all, and all in one, and all in each,  whence it happens that if two mirrors are placed in such a manner as  to face each other exactly, the first will be reflected in the  second and the second in the first. The first being reflected in the  second takes to it the image of itself with all the images  represented in it, among which is the image of the second mirror,  and so, image within image, they go on to infinity in such a manner  as that each mirror has within it a mirror, each smaller than the  last and one inside the other. Thus, by this example, it is clearly  proved that every object sends its image to every spot whence the  object itself can be seen; and the converse: That the same object  may receive in itself all the images of the objects that are in  front of it. Hence the eye transmits through the atmosphere its own  image to all the objects that are in front of it and receives them  into itself, that is to say on its surface, whence they are taken in  by the common sense, which considers them and if they are pleasing  commits them to the memory. Whence I am of opinion: That the  invisible images in the eyes are produced towards the object, as the  image of the object to the eye. That the images of the objects must  be disseminated through the air. An instance may be seen in several  mirrors placed in a circle, which will reflect each other endlessly.  When one has reached the other it is returned to the object that  produced it, and thence--being diminished--it is returned again to  the object and then comes back once more, and this happens  endlessly. If you put a light between two flat mirrors with a  distance of 1 braccio between them you will see in each of them an  infinite number of lights, one smaller than another, to the last. If  at night you put a light between the walls of a room, all the parts  of that wall will be tinted with the image of that light. And they  will receive the light and the light will fall on them, mutually,  that is to say, when there is no obstacle to interrupt the  transmission of the images. This same example is seen in a greater  degree in the distribution of the solar rays which all together, and  each by itself, convey to the object the image of the body which  causes it. That each body by itself alone fills with its images the  atmosphere around it, and that the same air is able, at the same  time, to receive the images of the endless other objects which are  in it, this is clearly proved by these examples. And every object is  everywhere visible in the whole of the atmosphere, and the whole in  every smallest part of it; and all the objects in the whole, and all  in each smallest part; each in all and all in every part.    66.    The images of objects are all diffused through the atmosphere which  receives them; and all on every side in it. To prove this, let _a c  e_ be objects of which the images are admitted to a dark chamber by  the small holes _n p_ and thrown upon the plane _f i_ opposite to  these holes. As many images will be produced in the chamber on the  plane as the number of the said holes.    67.    General conclusions.    All objects project their whole image and likeness, diffused and  mingled in the whole of the atmosphere, opposite to themselves. The  image of every point of the bodily surface, exists in every part of  the atmosphere. All the images of the objects are in every part of  the atmosphere. The whole, and each part of the image of the  atmosphere is [reflected] in each point of the surface of the bodies  presented to it. Therefore both the part and the whole of the images  of the objects exist, both in the whole and in the parts of the  surface of these visible bodies. Whence we may evidently say that  the image of each object exists, as a whole and in every part, in  each part and in the whole interchangeably in every existing body.  As is seen in two mirrors placed opposite to each other.    68.    That the contrary is impossible.    It is impossible that the eye should project from itself, by visual  rays, the visual virtue, since, as soon as it opens, that front  portion [of the eye] which would give rise to this emanation would  have to go forth to the object and this it could not do without  time. And this being so, it could not travel so high as the sun in a  month's time when the eye wanted to see it. And if it could reach  the sun it would necessarily follow that it should perpetually  remain in a continuous line from the eye to the sun and should  always diverge in such a way as to form between the sun and the eye  the base and the apex of a pyramid. This being the case, if the eye  consisted of a million worlds, it would not prevent its being  consumed in the projection of its virtue; and if this virtue would  have to travel through the air as perfumes do, the winds would bent  it and carry it into another place. But we do [in fact] see the mass  of the sun with the same rapidity as [an object] at the distance of  a braccio, and the power of sight is not disturbed by the blowing of  the winds nor by any other accident.    [Footnote: The view here refuted by Leonardo was maintained among  others by Bramantino, Leonardo's Milanese contemporary. LOMAZZO  writes as follows in his Trattato dell' Arte della pittura &c.  (Milano 1584. Libr. V cp. XXI): Sovviemmi di aver già letto in certi  scritti alcune cose di Bramantino milanese, celebratissimo pittore,  attenente alla prospettiva, le quali ho voluto riferire, e quasi  intessere in questo luogo, affinchè sappiamo qual fosse l'opinione  di cosi chiaro e famoso pittore intorno alla prospettiva . . Scrive  Bramantino che la prospettiva è una cosa che contrafà il naturale, e  che ciò si fa in tre modi    Circa il primo modo che si fa con ragione, per essere la cosa in  poche parole conclusa da Bramantino in maniera che giudico non  potersi dir meglio, contenendovi si tutta Parte del principio al  fine, io riferirò per appunto le proprie parole sue (cp. XXII, Prima  prospettiva di Bramantino). La prima prospettiva fa le cose di  punto, e l'altra non mai, e la terza più appresso. Adunque la prima  si dimanda prospettiva, cioè ragione, la quale fa l'effetto dell'  occhio, facendo crescere e calare secondo gli effetti degli occhi.  Questo crescere e calare non procede della cosa propria, che in se  per esser lontana, ovvero vicina, per quello effetto non può  crescere e sminuire, ma procede dagli effetti degli occhi, i quali  sono piccioli, e perciò volendo vedere tanto gran cosa_, bisogna che  mandino fuora la virtù visiva, _la quale si dilata in tanta  larghezza, che piglia tutto quello che vuoi vedere, ed_ arrivando a  quella cosa la vede dove è: _e da lei agli occhi per quello circuito  fino all' occhio, e tutto quello termine è pieno di quella cosa_.    It is worthy of note that Leonardo had made his memorandum refuting  this view, at Milan in 1492]    69.    A parallel case.    Just as a stone flung into the water becomes the centre and cause of  many circles, and as sound diffuses itself in circles in the air: so  any object, placed in the luminous atmosphere, diffuses itself in  circles, and fills the surrounding air with infinite images of  itself. And is repeated, the whole every-where, and the whole in  every smallest part. This can be proved by experiment, since if you  shut a "]]]
