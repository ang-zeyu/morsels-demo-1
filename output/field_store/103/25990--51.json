Overhead they were quite securely protected by the dense and  interweaving foliage of the two trees, but still the wind whistled in  at either side and over and under the frame of boards. Of one accord  they dropped beside their patient.    She was trembling violently; they heard the light, continuous  chattering of her teeth. After her many hours under the merciless sun,  this sudden change of temperature might bring on the fever against  which they could not fight. They stripped off their shirts and wound  them carefully around her shivering body. McTee lifted her in his arms  and sat down with his back to the wind. Harrigan took a place beside  him, and they caught her close. They seemed to be striving by the force  of their will to drive the heat from their own blood into her trembling  body. But still she moaned in her delirium, and the shivering would not  stop.    Then the great idea came to Harrigan. He rose without a word and ran  out into the rain to a fallen tree which must have been blown down  years before, for now the trunk and the splintered stump were rotten to  the core. He had noticed it that day. There was only a rim of firm wood  left of the wreck. The stump gave readily enough under his pull. He  ripped away long strips of the casing, bark and wood, and carried it  back to the shelter. He made a second trip to secure a great armful of  the powder-dry time-rotted core of the stump.    His third expedition carried him a little farther afield to a small  sapling which he could barely make out through the night. He bent down  the top of the little tree and snapped off about five feet of its  length. This in turn he brought to the shelter. He stopped short here,  frozen with amazement. The girl was raving in her delirium, and to  soothe her, McTee was singing to her horrible sailor chanteys, pieced  out with improvised and foolish words.    Harrigan listened only while his astonishment kept him helpless; then  he took up his work. He first stripped away the twigs from his sapling  top. Then he tied the twine firmly at either end of the stick, leaving  the string loose. Next he fumbled among the mass of rubbish he had  brought in from the rotten trunk and broke off a chunk of hard wood  several inches in length. By rubbing this against the fragment of the  wheelhouse, he managed to reduce one end of the little stick to a rough  point.    He took the largest slab of the rim wood from the stump and knelt upon  it to hold it firm. On this wood he rested his peg, which was wrapped  in several folds of the twine and pressed down by the second fragment  of wood. When he moved the long stick back and forth, the peg revolved  at a tremendous rate of speed, its partially sharpened end digging into  the wood on which it rested. It is a method of starting a fire which  was once familiarly used by Indians.    For half an hour Harrigan sweated and groaned uselessly over his labor.  Once he smelled a taint of smoke and shouted his triumph, but the peg  slipped and the work was undone. He started all over again after a  short rest and the peg creaked against the slab of wood with the speed  of its rotation--a small sound of protest drowned by the bellowing of  the storm and the ringing songs of McTee. Now the smoke rose again and  this time the peg kept firm. The smoke grew pungent; there was a spark,  then a glow, and it spread and widened among the powdery, rotten wood  which Harrigan had heaped around his rotating peg.    He tossed the peg and bow aside and blew softly and steadily on the  glowing point. It spread still more and now a small tongue of flame  rose and flickered. Instantly Harrigan laid small bits of wood  criss-cross on the pile of tinder. The flame licked at them  tentatively, recoiled, rose again and caught hold. The fire was well  started.    With gusts of wind fanning it roughly, the flame rose fast. Harrigan  made other journeys to the rotten stump and wrenched away great chunks  of bark and wood. He came back and piled them on the fire. It towered  high, the upper tongues twisting among the branches of the tree. They  laid Kate Malone between the windbreak and the fire. In a short time  her trembling ceased; she turned her face to the blaze and slept.    They watched her with jealous care all night. In lieu of a pillow they  heaped some of the wood dust from the stump beneath her head. When  their large hands hovered over her to straighten the clothes which the  wind fluttered, she seemed marvelously delicate and fragile. It was  astonishing that so fragile a creature should have lived through the  buffeting of the sea.    Toward morning the storm fell at a breath and the rain died away. They  agreed that it might be safe to leave her alone while they ventured out  to look for food, and at the first hint of light they started out, one  to the north, and one to the south. Harrigan started at an easy run. He  felt a joyous exultation like that of a boy eager for play. He tried to  find shellfish first, but without success. His search carried him far  down the beach to a group of big rocks rolling out to sea. On the  leeward side of these rocks, in little hollows of the stone, he found a  quantity of the eggs of some seafowl. They were quite large, the shells  a dirty, faint blue and apparently very thick. He collected all he  could carry and started back.    As he approached the shelter, he heard voices and stopped short with a  sudden pang; McTee had returned first and awakened the girl. Harrigan  sighed. He knew now how he had wanted to watch her eyes open for the  first time, the cool sea-green eyes lighted by bewilderment, surprise,  and joy. All that delight had been McTee's. It was that dark, handsome  face she had seen leaning over her when she awoke. He was firmly  implanted in her mind by this time as her savior. She opened her eyes,  hungered, and she had seen McTee bringing food. Harrigan drew a long  breath and went on slowly with lowered head.    They sat cross-legged, facing each other. The captain was showing Kate  his prizes, which seemed to consist of a quantity of shellfish. She  clapped her hands at something McTee said, and her laughter,  wonderfully clear, reminded Harrigan of the chiming of faraway church  bells. Blind anger suddenly possessed him as he stood by the fire  glowering down at them.          CHAPTER 11      \"Eggs! How perfectly wonderful, Mr. Harrigan! And I'm starved!\"    She looked up to him, radiant with delight; but the triumphant eye of  Harrigan fell not upon her but on McTee, who had suddenly grown  pensive.    \"But how can we cook them? There's nothing to boil water in--and no pan  for frying them,\" ventured McTee.    \"Roast 'em,\" said Harrigan scornfully. \"Like this.\"    He wrapped several eggs in wet clay and placed them in the glowing  ashes of the fire which had now burned low.    \"While they're cooking,\" said McTee, \"I'm going off. I've an idea.\"    Harrigan watched him with a shade of suspicion while he retreated. He  turned his head to find Kate studying him gravely.    \"Before you came, Mr. Harrigan--\"    \"My name's Dan. That'll save time.\"    \"While you were gone,\" she went on, thanking him with a smile, \"Captain  McTee told me a great many things about you.\"    Harrigan stirred uneasily.    \"Among other things, that you had no such record as he hinted at while  we were on the _Mary Rogers_. So I have to ask you to forgive me--\"    The blue eyes grew bright as he watched her.    \"I've forgotten all that, for the sea washed it away from my mind.\"    \"Really?\"    \"As clean as the wind has washed the sky.\"    Not a cloud stained the broad expanse from horizon to horizon.    \"That's a beautiful way to put it. Now that we are here on the island,  we begin all over again and forget what happened on the ship?\"    \"Aye, all of it.\"    \"Shake on it.\"    He took her hand, but so gingerly that she laughed.    \"We have to be careful of you,\" he explained seriously. \"Here we are,  as McTee puts it, on the rim of the world, two men an' one woman. If  something happens to one of us, a third of our population's gone.\"    \"A third of our population! Then I'm very important?\"    \"You are.\"    He was so serious that it disconcerted her. It suddenly became  impossible for her to meet his eyes, they burned so bright, so eager,  with something like a threat in them. She hailed the returning figure  of McTee with relief.    He came bearing a large gourd, and he knelt before Kate so that she  might look into it. She cried out at what she saw, for he had washed  the inside of the gourd and filled it with cool water from the spring.    \"Look!\" said she to Harrigan. \"It's water--and my throat is fairly  burning.\"    \"Humph,\" growled Harrigan, and he avoided the eye of McTee.    The gourd was too heavy and clumsy for her to handle. The captain had  to raise and tip it so that she might drink, and as she drank, her eyes  went up to his with gratitude.    Harrigan set his teeth and commenced raking the roasted eggs from the  hot ashes. When her thirst was quenched, she looked in amazement at  Harrigan; even his back showed anger. In some mysterious manner it was  plain that she had displeased the big Irishman.    He turned now and offered her an egg, after removing the clay mold. But  when she thanked him with the most flattering of smiles, she became  aware that McTee in turn was vexed, while the Irishman seemed perfectly  happy again.    \"Have an egg, McTee,\" he offered, and rolled a couple toward the big  captain.    \"I will not. I never had a taste for eggs.\"    \"Why, captain,\" murmured Kate, \"you can't live on shellfish?\"    \"Humph! Can't I? Very nutritious, Kate, and very healthful. Have to be  careful what you eat in this climate. Those eggs, for instance. Can you  tell, Harrigan, whether or not they're fresh?\"    Harrigan, his mouth full of egg, paused and glared at the captain.    \"For the captain of a ship, McTee,\" he said coldly, \"your "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9793"],[0,"Josephus (#9)"],[1,"Zealots against the high  priest Ananias, who was directing the Jewish policy towards submission  to Rome. Ananias, who was of the same party as Josephus, seems to have  come to the conclusion that resistance was hopeless, and he was anxious  to make terms. John called in to his aid the half-savage Idumeans, who  had joined the Jewish rebellion against Rome. They entered the city,  and, possessing themselves of the Temple mount, spread havoc. The Temple  itself ran with blood, and 8500 dead bodies, among them that of the high  priest, defiled its precincts.[1] Josephus, who, to suit the Roman  taste, identifies religion and ritual, declares that the fall of the  city and the ruin of the nation are to be dated from that day, and upon  Ananias he passes a eulogy that is likewise written with an eye to Roman  predilections:    \"He was a prodigious lover of liberty and of democracy; he ever  preferred the public welfare before his own advantage, and he was  thoroughly sensible that the Romans were invincible. And I cannot but  think that it was because God had doomed the city to destruction on  account of its pollution, and was resolved to purge His sanctuary with  fire, that He cut off thus its great protector.\"    [Footnote 1: B.J. IV. vi. 1.]    For the better part of a year, according to our historian, the Zealots  maintained a reign of terror, and the various parties fought against one  another in the Holy City as fiercely as the Girondists and Jacobins of  the French Revolution. But on the approach of Titus they abandoned their  strife and united to resist the foe. The Roman general brought with him  four legions, the fifth, tenth, twelfth, and fifteenth, besides a large  following of auxiliaries, and his whole force amounted to 80,000 men. As  head of his staff came Tiberius Alexander, the renegade nephew of Philo  and formerly procurator of Judea. Josephus also was on the besieger's  staff--possibly he was an officer of the body-guard (_praefectus  praetorio_)--and was employed to bring his countrymen to reason. Himself  convinced, almost from the moment when he took up arms, of the certainty  of Rome's ultimate victory, and doubly convinced now, partly from  superstitious fatalism, partly from a need for extenuating his own  submission, he wasted his eloquence in efforts to make them surrender.  He knew that within the besieged city there was a considerable  Romanizing faction (including his own father), and either he believed,  or he had to pretend to believe, that he could bring over the mass to  their way of thinking. On various occasions during the siege he was sent  to the walls to summon the defenders to lay down their arms. He enlarged  each time on the invincible power of Rome, on the hopelessness of  resistance, on the clemency of Titus if they would yield, and on the  terrible fate which would befall them and the Temple if they fought to  the bitter end. What must have specially aroused the fury of the Zealots  was his insistence that the Divine Providence was now on the side of the  Romans, and that in resisting they were sinning against God. It is  little wonder that on one occasion when making these harangues he was  struck by a dart, and that his father was placed in prison by the  Zealots. Indeed it says much for the tolerance of those whom he  constantly reviles as the most abandoned scoundrels and the most cruel  tyrants that they did not do him and his family greater hurt.    Titus, after beating back desperate attacks by the Jews, fixed his camp  on Mount Scopas, by the side of the Mount of Olives, to the north of the  city, and, abandoning the idea of taking the city fortress by storm,  prepared to beleaguer it in regular form. The Jews were not prepared for  a siege. Josephus and the Rabbis[1] agree that the supplies of corn had  been burnt by the Zealots during the civil disturbances; and as the  arrival of Titus coincided with the Passover, myriads of people, who had  come up from all parts of the country and the Diaspora to celebrate the  festival, were crowded within its walls. It is estimated that their  number exceeded two and a half million. The capital was a hard place to  capture. Josephus, following probably a Roman authority, gives an  account of the fortifications of Jerusalem from the point of view of the  besieger, which is confirmed in large part by modern research.[2] On the  southeast and west the city was unapproachable by reason of the sheer  ravines of Kedron and Hinnom, overlooked by almost perpendicular  precipices, which surrounded it. It was vulnerable therefore only on the  north, where the two heights on which it was built were connected with  the main ridge of the Judean hills; and here it was fortified with three  walls. The outermost, which was built by Agrippa I, encompassed the new  quarter of Bezetha, which lay outside the Temple mount to the northeast.  The second wall encompassed the part of the city on the Temple Mount and  reached as far as the Tower of Antonia, which overlooked and protected  the Temple. The third or innermost wall was the oldest, and encompassed  the whole of the ancient city where it was open, including the hill Acra  or Zion on the southeast, which was divided from Mount Moriah by the  cleft known as the Tyropoeon, or cheese-market. Beyond this hill there  was another eminence sloping gradually to the north, till it dropped  into the valley of Jehoshaphat with an escarpment of two hundred feet.    [Footnote 1: Comp. Abot de Rabbi Nathan, vi., ed. Schechter, p. 32.]    [Footnote 2: B.J. V. iv. 1.]    Thus the rampart surrounded the two hills with a continuous line of  defense, and the three quarters of the city were separated from each  other by distinct walls, so that each could hold out when the other had  fallen. The walls were strengthened with several towers, of which the  most important were Psephinus, on the third wall at the northwest  corner, Hippicus, on the old wall, which was opposite Phasaelus, and  Mariamne. But the strongest, largest, and most beautiful fortress in  Jerusalem was the Temple itself. It was not merely the visible center of  Judaism, it was the citadel of Judea. As each successive court rose  higher than the last, the \"Mountain of the House\" itself stood on the  highest point of the inclosure. The Temple was guarded by the tower of  Antonia, situated at the corner of the two cloisters, upon a rock fifty  cubits high, overlooking a precipice. Like the other towers, Antonia was  built by Herod, and manifested his love of largeness and strength.  Within these fortifications there were eleven thousand men under Simon,  and not more than thirty thousand trained soldiers under John, to pit  against eighty thousand Roman veterans; but of the two and a half  million people who, it is calculated, were shut up in the city,  thousands were ready at any moment to sally upon the besiegers and lay  down their lives for their beloved sanctuary.    Within the city, however, there were also a number of persons wavering  in their desire for resistance and anxious to find a favorable  opportunity of going over to the Romans. The leaders of the  high-priestly party had been killed by the Zealots, but their followers  remained to hamper the defense of the city. If Josephus is to be  believed, during the respite of the Passover festival at the beginning  of the siege, while the Romans were preparing their approaches and siege  works, the party strife again broke out. Eleazar opened the gates of the  Temple to admit the people for the festival, but John, taking  treacherous advantage of the opportunity, led his men in with arms  concealed beneath their garments, put his opponents to the sword, and  seized the sanctuary. Josephus further represents that throughout the  siege Simon and John, while resisting the Romans and defending different  parts of the walls, were still engaged in their internecine strife, \"and  did everything that the besiegers could desire them to do.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: B.J. V. vi.]    The story has not the stamp of probability, and it is more likely that  Josephus is distorting the jealousies of the two commanders into the  dimensions of civil strife. Anyhow, the resistance which the Jews  offered to the Romans showed the stubbornness of despair, or what the  historian calls \"their natural endurance in misfortune.\" At every step  the legionaries were checked; in pitching their camp, in making their  earthworks, in bringing up their machines; and frequently desperate  sallies were made by the defenders upon the Roman entrenchments.  Nevertheless, after fifteen days the first wall was captured, and in  five days more the second was taken. By a desperate sally the besieged  recovered it for a little, but were again driven back by superior  numbers and force. Josephus is fond of contrasting the different tempers  of the two armies: on the one side power and skill, on the other  boldness and the courage born of despair; here the habit of conquering,  there intense national ardor.    After the capture of the second wall, he was sent to parley with the  besieged, and urged, as he had done before, the invincible power of his  masters.[1] \"And evident it is,\" he added with his renegade's theology,  \"that fortune is on all hands gone over to them, and that God, who has  shifted dominion from nation to nation, is now settled in Italy.\"[2]  When his address was received with scorn, he proceeded, according to his  account, to lecture the people from their ancient history, in order to  prove that they had never been successful in aggressive warfare. \"Arms  were never given to our nation, but we are always given up to be fought  against and taken.\" The Zealots' desecration of the Temple deprived them  of Divine help, and it was madness to suppose that God would be  well-disposed to the wicked. Had He not shown favor to Titus and  performed miracles in his aid? Did not the springs of Siloam run more  plentifully "]]]
