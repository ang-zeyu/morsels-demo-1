The puma, we have seen,  violently attacks other large carnivores, not to feed on them, but  merely to satisfy its animosity; and, while respecting man, it is,  within the tropics, a great hunter and eater of monkeys, which of all  animals most resemble men. We can only conclude with Humboldt that there  is something mysterious in the hatreds and affections of animals.    The view here taken of the puma's character imparts, I think, a fresh  interest to some things concerning the species, which have appeared in  historical and other works, and which I propose to discuss briefly in  this place.    There is a remarkable passage in Byron's _Narrative of the loss of the  Wager,_ which was quoted by Admiral Fitzroy in his _Voyage of the  Beagle,_ to prove that tho puma inhabits Tierra del Fuego and the  adjacent islands; no other large beast of prey being known in that part  of America. \"I heard,\" he says, \"a growling close by me, which made me  think it advisable to retire as soon as possible: the woods were, so  gloomy I could see nothing; but, as I retired, this noise followed me  close till I got out of them. Some of our men did assure me that they  had seen a very large beast in the woods. . . I proposed to four of the  people to go to the end of the bay, about two miles distant from the  bell tent, to occupy the skeleton of an old Indian wigwam, which I had  discovered in a walk that way on our first landing. This we covered to  windward with seaweed; and, lighting a fire, laid ourselves down in  hopes of finding a remedy for our hunger in sleep; but we had not long  composed ourselves before one of our company was disturbed by the  blowing of some animal at his face; and, upon opening his eyes, was not  a little astonished to see by the glimmering of the fire, a large beast  standing over him. He had presence of mind enough to snatch a brand from  the fire, which was now very low, and thrust it at the nose of tho  animal, which thereupon made off. . . . In the morning we were not a  little anxious to know how our companions had fared; and this anxiety  was increased upon our tracing the footsteps of the beast in the sand,  in a direction towards the bell tent. The impression was deep and plain,  of a large round foot well furnished with claws. Upon acquainting the  people in the tent with the circumstances of our story, we found that  they had been visited by the same unwelcome guest.\"    Mr. Andrew Murray, in his work on the Geographical Distribution of  Mammals, gives the Straits of Magellan as the extreme southern limit of  the puma's range, and in discussing the above passage from Byron he  writes: \"This reference, however, gives no support to the notion of the  animal alluded to having been a puma. . . . The description of the  footprints clearly shows that the animal could not have been a puma.  None of the cat tribe leave any trace of a claw in their footprints. . .  The dogs, on the other hand, leave a very well-defined claw-mark. . . .  Commodore Byron and his party had therefore suffered a false alarm. The  creature which had disturbed them was, doubtless, one of the harmless  domestic dogs of the natives.\"    The assurance that the bold hardy adventurer and his men suffered a  false alarm, and were thrown into a great state of excitement at the  appearance of one of the wretched domestic dogs of the Fuegians, with  which they were familiar, comes charmingly, it must be said, from a  closet naturalist, who surveys the world of savage beasts from his  London study. He apparently forgets that Commodore Byron lived in a time  when the painful accuracy and excessive minuteness we are accustomed to  was not expected from a writer, whenever he happened to touch on any  matters connected with zoology.    This kind of criticism, which seizes on a slight inaccuracy in one  passage, and totally ignores an important statement in another--as, for  instance, that of the \"great beast\" seen in the woods--might be extended  to other portions of the book, and Byron's entire narrative made to  appear as purely a work of the imagination as Peter Wilkin's adventures  in those same antarctic seas.    Mr. J. W. Boddam Whetham, in his work _Across Central America_ (1877),  gives an anecdote of the puma, which he heard at Sacluk, in Guatemala,  and which strangely resembles some of the stories I have heard on the  pampas. He writes: \"The following event, most extraordinary if true, is  said to have occurred in this forest to a mahogany-cutter, who had been  out marking trees. As he was returning to his hut, he suddenly felt a  soft body pressing against him, and on looking down saw a cougar, which,  with tail erect, and purring like a cat, twisted itself in and out of  his legs, and glided round him, turning up its fierce eyes as if with  laughter. Horror-stricken and with faltering steps he kept on, and the  terrible animal still circled about, now rolling over, and now touching  him with a paw like a cat playing with a mouse. At last the suspense  became too great, and with a loud shout he struck desperately at the  creature with his axe. It bounded on one side and crouched snarling and  showing its teeth. Just as it was about to spring, the man's companion,  who had heard his call, appeared in the distance, and with a growl the  beast vanished into the thick bushes.\"    Now, after allowing for exaggeration, if there is no foundation for  stories of this character, it is really a very wonderful coincidence  that they should be met with in countries so widely separated as  Patagonia and Central America. Pumas, doubtless, are scarce in  Guatemala; and, as in other places where they have met with nothing but  persecution from man, they are shy of him; but had this adventure  occurred on the pampas, where they are better known, the person  concerned in it would not have said that the puma played with him as a  cat with a mouse, but rather as a tame cat plays with a child; nor,  probably, would he have been terrified into imagining that the animal,  even after its caresses had met with so rough a return, was about to  spring on him.    In Clavigero's _History of Lower California,_ it is related that a very  extraordinary state of things was discovered to exist in that country by  the first missionaries who settled there at the end of the seventeenth  century, and which was actually owing to the pumas. The author says that  there were no bears or tigers (jaguars); these had most probably been  driven out by their old enemies; but the pumas had increased to a  prodigious extent, so that the whole peninsula was overrun by them; and  this was owing to the superstitious regard in which they were held by  the natives, who not only did not kill them, but never ventured to  disturb them in any way. The Indians were actually to some extent  dependent on the puma's success in hunting for their subsistence; they  watched the movements of the vultures in order to discover the spot in  which the remains of any animal it had captured had been left by the  puma, and whenever the birds were seen circling about persistently over  one place, they hastened to take possession of the carcass, discovered  in this way. The domestic animals, imported by the missionaries, were  quickly destroyed by the virtual masters of the country, and against  these enemies the Jesuits preached a crusade in vain: for although the  Indians readily embraced Christianity and were baptized, they were not  to be shaken in their notions concerning the sacred _Chimbica,_ as the  puma was called. The missions languished in consequence; the priests  existed in a state of semi-starvation, depending on provisions sent to  them at long intervals from the distant Mexican settlements; and for  many years all their efforts to raise the savages from their miserable  condition were thrown away. At length, in 1701, the mission of Loreto  was taken charge of by one Padre Ugarte, described by Clavigero as a  person of indomitable energy, and great physical strength and courage, a  true muscular Christian, who occasionally varied his method of  instruction by administering corporal chastisements to his hearers when  they laughed at his doctrines, or at the mistakes he made in their  language, while preaching to them. Ugarte, like his predecessors, could  not move the Indians to hunt the puma, but he was a man of action, with  a wholesome belief in the efficacy of example, and his opportunity came  at last.    One day, while riding in the wood, he saw at a distance a puma walking  deliberately towards him. Alighting from his mule, he took up a large  stone and advanced to meet the animal, and when sufficiently near hurled  the missile with such precision and force that he knocked ifc down  senseless. After killing it, he found that the heaviest part of his task  remained, as it was necessary for the success of his project to carry  the beast, still warm and bleeding, to the Indian village; but mow his  mule steadfastly refused to approach it. Father Ugarte was not,  however, to be defeated, and partly by stratagem, partly by force, he  finally succeeded in getting the puma on to the mule's back, after which  he rode in triumph to the settlement. The Indians at first thought it  all a trick of their priest, who was so anxious to involve them in a  conflict with the pumas, and standing at a distance they began jeering  at him, and exclaiming that he had found the animal dead! But when they  were induced to approach, and saw that it was still warm and bleeding,  they were astonished beyond measure, and began to watch the priest  narrowly, thinking that he would presently drop down and die in sight of  them all. It was their belief that death would quickly overtake the  slayer of a puma. As this did not happen, the priest gained a great  influence over them, and in the end they were persuaded to turn their  weapons against the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7450"],[0,"Terre Napoleón; a History of French Explorations and Projects in Australia (#9)"],[1,"hoisted out  and went on board, Le Geographe having also hove to.    On the French vessel, meanwhile, similar curiosity had been provoked as  to the identity of the ship sailing east. Captain Baudin's men had been  engaged during the morning in harpooning dolphins, which they desired for  the sake of the flesh. Peron, in his narrative, waxes almost hysterically  joyous about the good fortune that brought along a school of these fish  just as the ship's company were almost perishing for want of fresh food.  They appeared, he says, like a gift from Heaven.* (* \"Cette peche  heureuse nous parut comme un bienfait du ciel. Alors, en effet, le  terrible scorbut avoit commence ses ravages, et les salaisons pourries et  rongees de vers auxquelles nous etions reduits depuis plusieurs mois  precipitoient chaque jour l'affreux developpement de ce fleau.\" Voyage de  Decouvertes 1 323.) Unlike the bronzed and healthy crew of the  Investigator, the company on Le Geographe were suffering severely from  scurvy. The virulence of the disease increased daily. They were rejoicing  at the capture of nine large dolphins, which would supply them with a  feast of fresh meat, when the look-out man signalled that a sail was in  sight.* (* Mr. T. Ward, in his Rambles of an Australian Naturalist (1907)  page 153, relates that in 1889 he harpooned a large dolphin, Grampus  gris, in King George's Sound, and that whalers told him that dolphins  were at one time common in the Bight, in schools of two and three  hundred. As to dolphin flesh as food, the reader may like to be reminded  that Hawkins's men, in 1565, found dolphins \"of very good colour and  proportion to behold, and no less delicate in taste\" (Hakluyt's Voyages  edition of 1904 10 61). So also in 1705 a voyager to Maryland related the  capture of dolphins, \"a beautiful fish to see...it is also a good fish to  eat.\" \"Narrative of a Voyage to Maryland,\" printed from manuscript in  American Historical Review 12 328.)    At first it was considered that the ship was Le Naturaliste, the consort  of Le Geographe, the two vessels having become separated in a storm off  the Tasmanian coast. But as the Investigator steered towards the French  and hoisted her flag, the mistake was corrected.    Flinders took Brown, the naturalist, with him on board, because he was a  good French scholar; but Captain Baudin spoke English \"so as to be  understood,\" and the conversation was therefore conducted for the most  part in that language. Brown was the only person present at the first  interview on the 8th, and at the second on the following morning;* (* \"No  person was present at our conversations except Mr. Brown\" (Flinders,  Voyage 1 190). Robert Brown was a very celebrated botanist. Humboldt  styled him \"botanicorum facile princeps.\" His Prodromus Florae Novae  Hollandiae is a classic of price.) both taking place in the French  captain's cabin. Peron, in the first volume of the Voyage de Decouvertes,  wrote as though he were present and heard what occurred between the two  commanders. \"En nous fournissant tous ces details M. Flinders se montre  d'une grande reserve sur ses operations particulieres,\" he wrote; and  again: \"apres avoir converse plus d'une heure avec nous.\" But his  testimony in this, as in several other respects, is not reliable. Baudin  wrote no detailed account of the conversations, nor did Brown; but  Flinders related what occurred with the minute care that was habitual  with him. Peron's evidence is at best second-hand, and he supplemented it  with such information as could be elicited by \"pumping\" the sailors in  Flinders' boat.* (* \"Nous apprimes toutefois par quelques-uns de ses  matelots qu'il avoit eu beaucoup a souffrir de ces memes vents de la  partie du Sud qui nous avoient ete si favorables.\" The boatmen were not  questioned by Peron himself, who at this time could not speak English  (Freycinet, Voyage de Decouvertes 2 Preface page 17). Freycinet admits  that Peron was not present at the interviews, but says that Baudin  related what took place with \"more or less exactitude.\" But as Freycinet  was not present himself either at the interviews or on the ship when  Baudin related what occurred, how could he know that the version of the  commander--at whom, after Baudin's death, he never missed an opportunity  of sneering--was merely \"more or less\" exact?) Even then he blundered,  for some of the things stated by him were not only contrary to fact, but  could not have been ascertained from Baudin, from Flinders, or from the  sailors.    Peron stated, for example, that Flinders said that he had been  accompanied from England by a second vessel, which had become separated  from him by a violent tempest. There had been no second vessel, and  Flinders could have made no such assertion. Again, Peron wrote that  Flinders said that, hindered by contrary winds, he had not been able to  penetrate behind the islands of St. Peter and St. Francis, in Nuyts  Archipelago. Flinders made no such absurd statement. He had followed the  coast behind those islands with the utmost particularity. His track, with  soundings, is shown on his large chart of the section.* (* On this  statement the Quarterly reviewer of 1810 bluntly wrote: \"Now, we will  venture not only to assert that all this is a direct falsehood (for we  have seen both the journal and charts of Captain Flinders, which are  fortunately arrived safe in this country), but also to pledge ourselves  that no such observations are to be found either in Captain Baudin's  journal or in the logbook of the Geographe.\" Quarterly Review 4 52. It  was a good guess. No such observation is contained in the printed log of  Le Geographe.) Once more, Peron stated that Flinders said that he had  lost a boat and eight men in the same gale as had endangered the French  ships in Bass Strait. Flinders had lost John Thistle, an officer to whom  he was deeply attached, and a crew of eight men off Cape Catastrophe, but  the incident occurred during a sudden squall. Moreover, Thistle and his  companions were drowned on February 21, whilst the storm in the  Strait--as Baudin told Flinders--occurred exactly a month later.    When Flinders got on board Le Geographe, he was received by an officer,  of whom he inquired for the commander. Baudin was pointed out to him, and  conducted him and Brown into the captain's cabin. Flinders then  \"requested Baudin to show me his passport from the Admiralty, and when it  was found, and I had perused it, I offered him mine from the French  marine minister, but he put it back without inspection.\" The incident  serves to remind us that both commanders believed their nations to be at  war at this time. As a matter of fact, just a fortnight before the  meeting in Encounter Bay, diplomacy had patched up the brittle truce  ironically known as the Peace of Amiens (March 25). But neither Flinders  nor Baudin could have known that there was even a prospect of the  cessation of hostilities. Europe, when they last had touch of its  affairs, was still clanging with battle and warlike preparations, and the  red star of the Corsican had not yet reached its zenith. Baudin's  readiness to produce his own passport when \"requested\"--in a style prompt  if not peremptory, it would seem--and his indifference about that of the  English commander, should be noted as the first of a series of facts  which establish the purely peaceful character of the French expedition.    Baudin talked freely about the work upon which he had been engaged in  Tasmanian waters. Flinders inquired concerning a large island said to lie  in the western entrance of Bass Strait--that is, King Island--but Baudin  \"had not seen it and seemed to doubt much of its existence.\" As a matter  of fact, Le Geographe had sailed quite close to the island, as indicated  on the track-chart showing her course, and that it should have been  missed indicated that the look-out was not very vigilant. Curiously  enough, too, Baudin marked down on his chart, presumably as the result of  this inquiry of Flinders, an island \"believed to exist,\" but he put it in  the wrong place.    An incident that appealed to Flinders' dry sense of humour occurred in  reference to a chart of Bass Strait which Baudin had with him. This chart  was one which had been drawn from George Bass's sketch by Flinders  himself, and incorporated with his own more scientific chart of the north  coast of Tasmania and the adjacent islands. Bass had traversed, in his  whale-boat, the southern coast of Victoria as far as Westernport, but not  being a surveyor he had furnished only a rough outline of the lay of the  shore. Up to this time Baudin had not inquired the name of the commander  of the Investigator, and it was from not knowing to whom he was talking  that he fell into a blunder which the politeness, native to a French  gentleman, would certainly have made him wish to avoid. He began to  criticise the chart, finding great fault with the north side, but  commending the drawing of the south--that is, of northern Tasmania and  the islands near it. \"On my pointing out a note upon the chart explaining  that the north side of the Strait was seen only in an open boat by Mr.  Bass, who had no good means of fixing either latitude or longitude, he  appeared surprised, not having before paid attention to it. I told him  that some other and more particular charts of the Strait and its  neighbourhood had since been published, and that if he would keep company  until next morning I would bring him a copy, with a small memoir  belonging to them. This was agreed to, and I returned with Mr. Brown to  the Investigator.\"    On the following morning Flinders and Brown again visited Le Geographe  with the promised chart. At the conclusion of this second interview,  Baudin requested that, should the Investigator fall in with Le  Naturaliste, Flinders would inform her captain that it was his intention  to sail round to Port Jackson as"]]]
