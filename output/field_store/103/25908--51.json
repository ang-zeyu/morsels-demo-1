The youth turned his  head, shaken from his trance by this movement as if the regiment was  leaving him behind.  He saw the few fleeting forms.    He yelled then with fright and swung about.  For a moment, in the great  clamor, he was like a proverbial chicken.  He lost the direction of  safety.  Destruction threatened him from all points.    Directly he began to speed toward the rear in great leaps.  His rifle  and cap were gone.  His unbuttoned coat bulged in the wind.  The flap  of his cartridge box bobbed wildly, and his canteen, by its slender  cord, swung out behind.  On his face was all the horror of those things  which he imagined.    The lieutenant sprang forward bawling.  The youth saw his features  wrathfully red, and saw him make a dab with his sword.  His one thought  of the incident was that the lieutenant was a peculiar creature to feel  interested in such matters upon this occasion.    He ran like a blind man.  Two or three times he fell down.  Once he  knocked his shoulder so heavily against a tree that he went headlong.    Since he had turned his back upon the fight his fears had been  wondrously magnified.  Death about to thrust him between the shoulder  blades was far more dreadful than death about to smite him between the  eyes.  When he thought of it later, he conceived the impression that it  is better to view the appalling than to be merely within hearing.  The  noises of the battle were like stones; he believed himself liable to be  crushed.    As he ran on he mingled with others.  He dimly saw men on his right and  on his left, and he heard footsteps behind him.  He thought that all  the regiment was fleeing, pursued by those ominous crashes.    In his flight the sound of these following footsteps gave him his one  meager relief.  He felt vaguely that death must make a first choice of  the men who were nearest; the initial morsels for the dragons would be  then those who were following him.  So he displayed the zeal of an  insane sprinter in his purpose to keep them in the rear.  There was a  race.    As he, leading, went across a little field, he found himself in a  region of shells.  They hurtled over his head with long wild screams.  As he listened he imagined them to have rows of cruel teeth that  grinned at him.  Once one lit before him and the livid lightning of the  explosion effectually barred the way in his chosen direction.  He  groveled on the ground and then springing up went careering off through  some bushes.    He experienced a thrill of amazement when he came within view of a  battery in action.  The men there seemed to be in conventional moods,  altogether unaware of the impending annihilation.  The battery was  disputing with a distant antagonist and the gunners were wrapped in  admiration of their shooting.  They were continually bending in coaxing  postures over the guns.  They seemed to be patting them on the back and  encouraging them with words.  The guns, stolid and undaunted, spoke  with dogged valor.    The precise gunners were coolly enthusiastic.  They lifted their eyes  every chance to the smoke-wreathed hillock from whence the hostile  battery addressed them.  The youth pitied them as he ran.  Methodical  idiots!  Machine-like fools!  The refined joy of planting shells in the  midst of the other battery's formation would appear a little thing when  the infantry came swooping out of the woods.    The face of a youthful rider, who was jerking his frantic horse with an  abandon of temper he might display in a placid barnyard, was impressed  deeply upon his mind.  He knew that he looked upon a man who would  presently be dead.    Too, he felt a pity for the guns, standing, six good comrades, in a  bold row.    He saw a brigade going to the relief of its pestered fellows.  He  scrambled upon a wee hill and watched it sweeping finely, keeping  formation in difficult places.  The blue of the line was crusted with  steel color, and the brilliant flags projected.  Officers were shouting.    This sight also filled him with wonder.  The brigade was hurrying  briskly to be gulped into the infernal mouths of the war god.  What  manner of men were they, anyhow?  Ah, it was some wondrous breed!  Or  else they didn't comprehend--the fools.    A furious order caused commotion in the artillery.  An officer on a  bounding horse made maniacal motions with his arms.  The teams went  swinging up from the rear, the guns were whirled about, and the battery  scampered away.  The cannon with their noses poked slantingly at the  ground grunted and grumbled like stout men, brave but with objections  to hurry.    The youth went on, moderating his pace since he had left the place of  noises.    Later he came upon a general of division seated upon a horse that  pricked its ears in an interested way at the battle.  There was a great  gleaming of yellow and patent leather about the saddle and bridle.  The  quiet man astride looked mouse-colored upon such a splendid charger.    A jingling staff was galloping hither and thither.  Sometimes the  general was surrounded by horsemen and at other times he was quite  alone.  He looked to be much harassed.  He had the appearance of a  business man whose market is swinging up and down.    The youth went slinking around this spot.  He went as near as he dared  trying to overhear words.  Perhaps the general, unable to comprehend  chaos, might call upon him for information.  And he could tell him.  He  knew all concerning it.  Of a surety the force was in a fix, and any  fool could see that if they did not retreat while they had  opportunity--why--    He felt that he would like to thrash the general, or at least approach  and tell him in plain words exactly what he thought him to be.  It was  criminal to stay calmly in one spot and make no effort to stay  destruction.  He loitered in a fever of eagerness for the division  commander to apply to him.    As he warily moved about, he heard the general call out irritably:  \"Tompkins, go over an' see Taylor, an' tell him not t' be in such an  all-fired hurry; tell him t' halt his brigade in th' edge of th' woods;  tell him t' detach a reg'ment--say I think th' center 'll break if we  don't help it out some; tell him t' hurry up.\"    A slim youth on a fine chestnut horse caught these swift words from the  mouth of his superior.  He made his horse bound into a gallop almost  from a walk in his haste to go upon his mission.  There was a cloud of  dust.    A moment later the youth saw the general bounce excitedly in his saddle.    \"Yes, by heavens, they have!\"  The officer leaned forward.  His face  was aflame with excitement.  \"Yes, by heavens, they 've held 'im!  They  've held 'im!\"    He began to blithely roar at his staff:  \"We 'll wallop 'im now.  We  'll wallop 'im now.  We 've got 'em sure.\"  He turned suddenly upon an  aide:  \"Here--you--Jones--quick--ride after Tompkins--see Taylor--tell  him t' go in--everlastingly--like blazes--anything.\"    As another officer sped his horse after the first messenger, the  general beamed upon the earth like a sun.  In his eyes was a desire to  chant a paean.  He kept repeating, \"They 've held 'em, by heavens!\"    His excitement made his horse plunge, and he merrily kicked and swore  at it.  He held a little carnival of joy on horseback.          Chapter 7      The youth cringed as if discovered in a crime.  By heavens, they had  won after all!  The imbecile line had remained and become victors.  He  could hear cheering.    He lifted himself upon his toes and looked in the direction of the  fight.  A yellow fog lay wallowing on the treetops.  From beneath it  came the clatter of musketry.  Hoarse cries told of an advance.    He turned away amazed and angry.  He felt that he had been wronged.    He had fled, he told himself, because annihilation approached.  He had  done a good part in saving himself, who was a little piece of the army.  He had considered the time, he said, to be one in which it was the duty  of every little piece to rescue itself if possible.  Later the officers  could fit the little pieces together again, and make a battle front.  If none of the little pieces were wise enough to save themselves from  the flurry of death at such a time, why, then, where would be the army?  It was all plain that he had proceeded according to very correct and  commendable rules.  His actions had been sagacious things.  They had  been full of strategy.  They were the work of a master's legs.    Thoughts of his comrades came to him.  The brittle blue line had  withstood the blows and won.  He grew bitter over it.  It seemed that  the blind ignorance and stupidity of those little pieces had betrayed  him.  He had been overturned and crushed by their lack of sense in  holding the position, when intelligent deliberation would have  convinced them that it was impossible.  He, the enlightened man who  looks afar in the dark, had fled because of his superior perceptions  and knowledge.  He felt a great anger against his comrades.  He knew it  could be proved that they had been fools.    He wondered what they would remark when later he appeared in camp.  His  mind heard howls of derision.  Their density would not enable them to  understand his sharper point of view.    He began to pity himself acutely.  He was ill used.  He was trodden  beneath the feet of an iron injustice.  He had proceeded with wisdom  and from the most righteous motives under heaven's blue only to be  frustrated by hateful circumstances.    A dull, animal-like rebellion against his fellows, war in the abstract,  and fate grew within him.  He shambled along with bowed head, his brain  in a tumult of agony and despair.  When he looked loweringly up,  quivering at each sound, his eyes had the expression of those of a  criminal who thinks his guilt little and his punishment great, and  knows that he can find no words.    He went from the fields into a thick woods, as if "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7300"],[0,"Woman and the Republic (#9)"],[1,"majorities, Americans  would quickly see the propriety of doing as some republics that have to  stand with arms more \"at attention\" have done, and exclude them from the  vote.    But, suppose all those mentioned were really exempt, how would that apply  to women? If a like number were counted out, there would still be a goodly  array, from the maiden of twenty-one to the matron of forty-five, from  which to draw. Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony write: \"Women have led armies  in all ages, have held positions in the army and navy for years in  disguise, have fought, bled, and died on the battlefield in our late war.\"  The isolated occasions on which they have done so are not such as to  commend the practice, neither do the Suffragists propose seriously to  commend it. Dr. Jacobi, in her address before the Committee of the  Constitutional Convention, says: \"We do not admit that exemption from  military duty is a concession of courtesy, for which women should be so  grateful as to refrain from asking for anything else. The military  functions performed by men, and so often perverted to most atrocious uses,  have never been more than the equivalent for the function of child-bearing  imposed by nature upon women. It is not a fanciful nor sentimental, it is  an exact and just equivalent. The man who exposes his life in battle, can  do no more than his mother did in the hour she bore him. And the functions  of maternity persist, and will persist, to the end of time,--while the  calls to arms are becoming so faint and rare that three times since the  Revolutionary War, an entire generation of men has grown up without having  heard them.\"    This question of military service is not a question of equivalent at all--  sentimental or otherwise; it is a question of the actual service, and as  to the service to the state given by women in bearing sons, the men work  not only to support those sons but to support also their mothers and  sisters, and that far beyond the child-bearing age of the mother.    As to the rareness of the calls, I read of seven wars since the  Revolution, and three insurrections, not counting the riots and strikes at  Chicago, Homestead, Brooklyn, and in the mountains in the West. Dr. Jacobi  said in an article in the \"New York Sun,\" two years ago, \"We do not vote  for war.\" That appears like a quibble, for we vote for what brings, or may  bring it; but neither is it exact in fact. Three times, at least, in our  history men have deposited their ballots in the box, knowing that the  result meant peace or war. These were at the second election of Madison in  1812, the election of Polk in 1844, and that most solemn of all the acts  of our country-men, the second election of President Lincoln. There have  been other elections in which war issues were linked with the decisions,  but in a less direct way.    The same writer says also, \"The will of the majority rules, for the time  being, not, as has been crudely asserted, because it possesses the power,  by brute force, to compel the minority to obey its behests; but because,  after ages of strife, it has been found more convenient, more equitable,  more conducive to the welfare of the state, that the minority should  submit, until, through argument and persuasion, they shall have been able  to win over the majority. Now that this stage in the evolution of modern  society has been reached, it has become possible for women to demand their  share also in the expression of the public opinion that is to rule. They  could not claim this while it was necessary to defend opinions by arms;  but this is no longer either necessary or expected.\" How long is it since  this comfortable state of things was evolved? Has England consented to it?  In view of Venezuela and the Monroe Doctrine it would be necessary to have  her. Has Spain mentioned her resignation of a right to appeal to arms in  case she was not pleased with the conduct of our Government in regard to  Cuba? Does the Sultan know about it, so that in case we see a good fair  fighting chance to help the Armenians he will understand that the ages of  strife are over, and that persuasion has been found more equitable and  convenient than a resort to arms? And the Czar, and the erratic German  Emperor, are they in the evolutionary agreement? Force is just what men  are able to make it. It is not brutish unless it is brutishly used. There  is as much force in the world to-day as there ever has been, but it is  better applied. It is the object of a Christian civilization to persuade  more and more men to come to the defence of good against evil in forms of  government. Despotism and absolutism are corrupt uses of force.  Republicanism and a constitutional government are its nobler uses. But the  force is still behind them, or there would be no power to continue such  liberal forms. During the first Republic, Marathon and Thermopylae saved  the principle of Western democracy against Oriental despotism, Salamis and  Plataea saved Greek letters and Greek art to the continents that were yet  to be. Christianity changed the motive but not the method in evolution;  and, finally in the last great Republic, the American Revolution  proclaimed liberty of thought, the war of 1812 secured American  independence, while, beside the wandering Antietam and on the field of  Gettysburg \"green regiments went to their graves like beds\" that the Union  might live, and that human slavery might die. Manhood force, led by  intelligence and goodness, is the bulwark of that maternity that must  persist if heroes are to be. Dr. Jacobi's admission that women could not  claim the vote while it was necessary to defend opinions by arms, is a  vital one, for it contravenes her entire argument.    Another plea of the Suffrage leaders is that \"men send substitutes, and so  could women.\" The answer in regard to exempt classes will apply here also,  because in case of need both substitute and substituter are obliged to  serve. During our Civil War the fact that a man had sent a substitute did  not prevent him from being called in the next draft. The state claims both  men as its defenders. But whom do the women propose to substitute? Other  women? No, they propose to substitute men! The Suffragists seriously  suggest that half the population, exempted by nature from military duty,  shall become organic members of a government whose reliance, embodied in  every constitution, is upon the ability and the willingness of its organic  members to do military duty in defence of those constitutions, and that  this exempted half may have it as their sole office, in case of war, to  vote when and where the lives, the fortunes, and the sacred honor of those  other organic members shall be laid down or imperilled. Suffragists seem  to forget, when they boast of Joan of Arc, that the army she led was  masculine.    The English socialist, Mrs. Stanton Blatch, daughter of Elizabeth Cady  Stanton, in her addresses in this country two years ago, said: \"Woman is  not protected through chivalry, but because the men know that to put women  to the front is national suicide. Woman's part in war is not to wail or  weep, but to furnish the army for the future.\" Then there is to be an army  for the future! Was there no \"national suicide\" when over three million  men were \"put to the front\" in the Rebellion, and more than five hundred  thousand, North and South, laid down their lives, so that through the  veins of this generation runs none of the gallant blood they spilled?  Shall the fathers, and possible fathers, be the only ones to die, if the  mothers and betrothed proclaim themselves no longer desirous of being  protected by such high sacrifice? If women cease to \"weep and wail,\" will  men not cease to be willing to be \"furnished by them to the army?\"      \"At any cost one good is cheap--     The soldiers die lest women weep;     And this reward is great and high--     The women weep that soldiers die.\"    Women and soldiers cannot transpose their work. The duty of each to the  Republic is equally \"great and high;\" but in order to be done it must be  kept distinct as now.    But all this is subordinate to the real, vital question. In the passages  just quoted, the writers make an error that is made so persistently by all  Suffragists whenever the argument of force is alluded to, that it seems  necessary to repeat the explanation. They assume that this argument,  briefly stated, is: The men do the fighting, therefore they ought to be  rewarded with the ballot. That is _not_ the argument; it is no matter of  reward. The argument, briefly stated, is this: Stability is one of the  highest virtues that any government can possess, and perhaps the most  necessary. It can have no stability if it issues decrees that it cannot  enforce. The only way to avoid such decrees is, to make sure that behind  every law and every policy adopted stands a power so great that no power  in the land can overthrow it. The only such power possible consists of a  majority of the men. Therefore, the only safe thing for the Government to  do is, to carry out the ascertained will of a majority of the men. This  does not always secure ideally good laws, but it does secure stability and  avoids revolution. The majority may blunder; but they are the only power  that can correct their own blunders.    But war does not call for the only form of public service. There are  others provided for in the National and State constitutions, which are  constant and exacting. They are jury, police and militia duty. When a boy  reaches twenty-one the law says to him, \"You are my servant.\" If a fire  breaks out, the foreman can legally lay his hand on the boy's shoulder,  and say, \"Help to put out this conflagration.\" When the law is broken, the  sheriff can say to him, \"Help me make this arrest.\" When a turn of the  judicial wheel brings out his name, he must serve the state on a jury; if  a riot occurs, he can be"]]]
