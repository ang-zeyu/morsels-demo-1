An estimated 13 million tourists visit annually,   attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter   resorts. The banking sector, with its \"tax haven\" status, also   contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is   limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be   imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising.   Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.   Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union; it is unclear what effect   the European Single Market will have on the advantages Andorra obtains   from its duty-free status.

Sir Munion really did wish it, as he spoke,  for his own words stirred him profoundly; but somehow or other they  did not stir Sergeant Cane. No, he had done his share, and he had a  family to look after.    Sir Munion could not understand him: he went back to the Big House and  said so. He had told him all the advantages he could think of that  were there to be had for the asking, and Sergeant Cane merely  neglected them.    \"Let me have a try,\" said Arthur Smith. \"He soldiered with me  before.\"    Sir Munion shrugged his shoulders. He had all the advantages at his  fingers' ends, from pay to billeting: there was nothing more to be  said. Nevertheless young Smith went.    \"Hullo, Sergeant Cane,\" said Smith.    \"Hello, sir,\" said the sergeant.    \"Do you remember that night at Reit River?\"    \"Don't I, sir,\" said Cane.    \"One blanket each and no ground sheet?\"    \"I remember, sir,\" said Cane.    \"Didn't it rain,\" said Smith.    \"It rained that night, proper.\"    \"Drowned a few of the lice, I suppose.\"    \"Not many,\" said Cane.    \"No, not many,\" Smith reflected. \"The Boers had the range all right  that time.\"    \"Gave it us proper,\" said Cane.    \"We were hungry that night,\" said Smith. \"I could have eaten  biltong.\"    \"I did eat some of it,\" said Cane. \"Not bad stuff, what there was  of it, only not enough.\"    \"I don't think,\" said Smith, \"that I've ever slept on the bare  earth since.\"    \"No, sir?\" said Cane. \"It's hard. You get used to it. But it will  always be hard.\"    \"Yes, it will always be hard,\" said Smith. \"Do you remember the  time we were thirsty?\"    \"Oh, yes, sir,\" said Cane, \"I remember that. One doesn't forget  that.\"    \"No. I still dream of it sometimes,\" said Smith. \"It makes a nasty  dream. I wake with my mouth all dry too, when I dream that.\"    \"Yes,\" said Cane, \"one doesn't forget being thirsty.\"    \"Well,\" said Smith, \"I suppose we're for it all over again?\"    \"I suppose so, sir,\" said Cane.    An Investigation Into the Causes and Origin of the War    The German imperial barber has been called up. He must have been  called up quite early in the war. I have seen photographs in papers  that leave no doubt of that. Who he is I do not know: I once read his  name in an article but have forgotten it; few even know if he still  lives. And yet what harm he has done! What vast evils he has  unwittingly originated! Many years ago he invented a frivolity, a jeu  d'esprit easily forgivable to an artist in the heyday of his youth, to  whom his art was new and even perhaps wonderful. A craft, of course,  rather than an art, and a humble craft at that; but then, the man was  young, and what will not seem wonderful to youth?    He must have taken the craft very seriously, but as youth takes things  seriously, fantastically and with laughter. He must have determined to  outshine rivals: he must have gone away and thought, burning candles  late perhaps, when all the palace was still. But how can youth think  seriously? And there had come to him this absurd, this fantastical  conceit. What else would have come? The more seriously he took the  tonsorial art, the more he studied its tricks and phrases and heard  old barbers lecture, the more sure were the imps of youth to prompt  him to laughter and urge him to something outrageous and ridiculous.  The background of the dull pomp of Potsdam must have made all this  more certain. It was bound to come.    And so one day, or, as I have suggested, suddenly late one night,  there came to the young artist bending over tonsorial books that  quaint, mad, odd, preposterous inspiration. Ah, what pleasure there is  in the madness of youth; it is not like the madness of age, clinging  to outworn formulae; it is the madness of breaking away, of galloping  among precipices, of dallying with the impossible, of courting the  absurd. And this inspiration, it was in none of the books; the  lecturer barbers had not lectured on it, could not dream of it and did  not dare to; there was no tradition for it, no precedent; it was mad;  and to introduce it into the pomp of Potsdam, that was the daring of  madness. And this preposterous inspiration of the absurd young  barber-madman was nothing less than a moustache that without any curve  at all, or any suggestion of sanity, should go suddenly up at the ends  very nearly as high as the eyes!    He must have told his young fellow craftsmen first, for youth goes  first to youth with its hallucinations. And they, what could they have  said? You cannot say of madness that it is mad, you cannot call  absurdity absurd. To have criticized would have revealed jealousy; and  as for praise you could not praise a thing like that. They probably  shrugged, made gestures; and perhaps one friend warned him. But you  cannot warn a man against a madness; if the madness is in possession  it will not be warned away: why should it? And then perhaps he went to  the old barbers of the Court. You can picture their anger. Age does  not learn from youth in any case. But there was the insult to their  ancient craft, bad enough if only imagined, but here openly spoken of.  And what would come of it? They must have feared, on the one hand,  dishonour to their craft if this young barber were treated as his  levity deserved; and, on the other hand, could they have feared his  success? I think they could not have guessed it.    And then the young idiot with his preposterous inspiration must have  looked about to see where he could practise his new absurdity. It  should have been enough to have talked about it among his fellow  barbers; they would have gone with new zest to their work next day for  this delirious interlude, and no harm would have been done. \"Fritz,\"  (or Hans) they would have said, \"was a bit on last night, a bit full  up,\" or whatever phrase they use to touch on drunkenness; and the  thing would have been forgotten. We all have our fancies. But this  young fool wanted to get his fancy mixed up with practice: that's  where he was mad. And in Potsdam, of all places.    He probably tried his friends first, young barbers at the Court and  others of his own standing. None of them were fools enough to be seen  going about like that. They had jobs to lose. A Court barber is one  thing, a man who cuts ordinary hair is quite another. Why should they  become outcasts because their friend chose to be mad?    He probably tried his inferiors then, but they would have been timid  folk; they must have seen the thing was absurd, and of course daren't  risk it. Again, why should they?    Did he try to get some noble then to patronize his invention? Probably  the first refusals he had soon inflamed his madness more, and he threw  caution insanely to the winds, and went straight to the Emperor.    It was probably about the time that the Emperor dismissed Bismarck;  certainly the drawings of that time show him still with a sane  moustache.    The young barber probably chanced on him in this period, finding him  bereft of an adviser, and ready to be swayed by whatever whim should  come. Perhaps he was attracted by the barber's hardihood, perhaps the  absurdity of his inspiration had some fascination for him, perhaps he  merely saw that the thing was new and, feeling jaded, let the barber  have his way. And so the frivolity became a fact, the absurdity became  visible, and honour and riches came the way of the barber.    A small thing, you might say, however fantastical. And yet I believe  the absurdity of that barber to be among the great evils that have  brought death nearer to man; whimsical and farcical as it was, yet a  thing deadlier than Helen's beauty or Tamerlane's love of skulls. For  just as character is outwardly shown so outward things react upon the  character; and who, with that daring barber's ludicrous fancy visible  always on his face, could quite go the sober way of beneficent  monarchs? The fantasy must be mitigated here, set off there; had you  such a figure to dress, say for amateur theatricals, you would realize  the difficulty. The heavy silver eagle to balance it; the glittering  cuirass lower down, preventing the eye from dwelling too long on the  barber's absurdity. And then the pose to go with the cuirass and to  carry off the wild conceit of that mad, mad barber. He has much to  answer for, that eccentric man whose name so few remember. For pose  led to actions; and just when Europe most needed a man of wise  counsels, restraining the passions of great empires, just then she had  ruling over Germany and, unhappily, dominating Austria, a man who  every year grew more akin to the folly of that silly barber's youthful  inspiration.    Let us forgive the barber. For long I have known from pictures that I  have seen of the Kaiser that he has gone to the trenches. Probably he  is dead. Let us forgive the barber. But let us bear in mind that the  futile fancies of youth may be deadly things, and that one of them  falling on a fickle mind may so stir its shallows as to urge it to  disturb and set in motion the avalanches of illimitable grief.    Lost    Describing a visit, say the papers of March 28th, which the Kaiser  paid incognito to Cologne Cathedral on March 18th before the great  battle, the Cologne correspondent of the Tyd says:    There were only a few persons in the building. Under high arches  and in spacious solitude the Kaiser sat, as if in deep thought,  before the priests' choir. Behind him his military staff stood  respectfully at a distance. Still musing as he rose, the monarch  resting both hands on his walking-stick remains standing immovable  for some minutes... I shall never forget this picture of the musing  monarch praying in Cologne Cathedral on the eve of the great  battle.    Probably he won't forget it. The German casualty lists will help to  remind him. But what is more to the point is that this expert  propagandist has presumably received orders that we are"]]]
