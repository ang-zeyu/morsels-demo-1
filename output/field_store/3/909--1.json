The Man in the Iron Mask we're  familiar with today is the last volume of the four-volume edition.  [Not all the editions split them in the same manner, hence some of the  confusion...but wait...there's yet more reason for confusion.]    We intend to do ALL of The Vicomte de Bragelonne, split into four  etexts entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later, Louise de la  Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask; you WILL be getting The Man in  the Iron Mask.    One thing that may be causing confusion is that the etext we have now,  entitled Ten Years Later, says it's the sequel to The Three Musketeers.  While this is technically true, there's another book, Twenty Years  After, that comes between. The confusion is generated by the two facts  that we published Ten Years Later BEFORE we published Twenty Years  After, and that many people see those titles as meaning Ten and Twenty  Years \"After\" the original story...however, this is why the different  words \"After\" and \"Later\"...the Ten Years \"After\" is ten years after  the Twenty Years later.. .as per history. Also, the third book of the  D'Artagnan Romances, while entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, has the  subtitle Ten Years Later. These two titles are also given to different  volumes: The Vicomte de Bragelonne can refer to the whole book, or the  first volume of the three or four-volume editions. Ten Years Later  can, similarly, refer to the whole book, or the second volume of the  four-volume edition. To add to the confusion, in the case of our etexts,  it refers to the first 104 chapters of the whole book, covering material  in the first and second etexts in the new series. Here is a guide to the  series which may prove helpful:    The Three Musketeers: Etext 1257--First book of the D'Artagnan Romances.  Covers the years 1625-1628.    Twenty Years After: Etext 1259--Second book of the D'Artagnan Romances.  Covers the years 1648-1649. [Third in the order that we published, but  second in time sequence!!!]    Ten Years Later: Etext 1258--First 104 chapters of the third book of the  D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the years 1660-1661.    The Vicomte de Bragelonne: Etext 2609 (first in the new series)--First  75 chapters of the third book of the D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the  year 1660.    Ten Years Later: Etext 2681 (second in the new series)--Chapters  76-140 of that third book of the D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the years  1660-1661. [In this particular editing of it]    Louise de la Valliere: Etext 2710 (our new text)--Chapters 141-208 of  the third book of the D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the year 1661.    The Man in the Iron Mask: forthcoming (our next text)--Chapters  209-269 of the third book of the D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the years  1661-1673.    If we've calculated correctly, that fourth text SHOULD correspond to  the modern editions of The Man in the Iron Mask, which is still  widely circulated, and comprises about the last 1/4 of The Vicomte de  Bragelonne.

Introduction: In the months of March-July in 1844, in the magazine Le  Siecle, the first portion of a story appeared, penned by the celebrated  playwright Alexandre Dumas. It was based, he claimed, on some  manuscripts he had found a year earlier in the Bibliotheque Nationale  while researching a history he planned to write on Louis XIV. They  chronicled the adventures of a young man named D'Artagnan who, upon  entering Paris, became almost immediately embroiled in court intrigues,  international politics, and ill-fated affairs between royal lovers. Over  the next six years, readers would enjoy the adventures of this youth and  his three famous friends, Porthos, Athos, and Aramis, as their exploits  unraveled behind the scenes of some of the most momentous events in  French and even English history.    Eventually these serialized adventures were published in novel form,  and became the three D'Artagnan Romances known today. Here is a brief  summary of the first two novels:    The Three Musketeers (serialized March--July, 1844): The year is 1625.  The young D'Artagnan arrives in Paris at the tender age of 18, and  almost immediately offends three musketeers, Porthos, Aramis, and Athos.  Instead of dueling, the four are attacked by five of the Cardinal's  guards, and the courage of the youth is made apparent during the battle.  The four become fast friends, and, when asked by D'Artagnan's landlord  to find his missing wife, embark upon an adventure that takes them  across both France and England in order to thwart the plans of the  Cardinal Richelieu. Along the way, they encounter a beautiful young spy,  named simply Milady, who will stop at nothing to disgrace Queen Anne of  Austria before her husband, Louis XIII, and take her revenge upon the  four friends.    Twenty Years After (serialized January--August, 1845): The year is now  1648, twenty years since the close of the last story. Louis XIII has  died, as has Cardinal Richelieu, and while the crown of France may sit  upon the head of Anne of Austria as Regent for the young Louis XIV,  the real power resides with the Cardinal Mazarin, her secret husband.  D'Artagnan is now a lieutenant of musketeers, and his three friends have  retired to private life. Athos turned out to be a nobleman, the Comte de  la Fere, and has retired to his home with his son, Raoul de Bragelonne.  Aramis, whose real name is D'Herblay, has followed his intention of  shedding the musketeer's cassock for the priest's robes, and Porthos has  married a wealthy woman, who left him her fortune upon her death. But  trouble is stirring in both France and England. Cromwell menaces the  institution of royalty itself while marching against Charles I, and at  home the Fronde is threatening to tear France apart. D'Artagnan brings  his friends out of retirement to save the threatened English monarch,  but Mordaunt, the son of Milady, who seeks to avenge his mother's death  at the musketeers' hands, thwarts their valiant efforts. Undaunted, our  heroes return to France just in time to help save the young Louis XIV,  quiet the Fronde, and tweak the nose of Cardinal Mazarin.    The third novel, The Vicomte de Bragelonne (serialized October,  1847--January, 1850), has enjoyed a strange history in its English  translation. It has been split into three, four, or five volumes at  various points in its history. The five-volume edition generally does  not give titles to the smaller portions, but the others do. In the  three-volume edition, the novels are entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne,  Louise de la Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask. For the purposes of  this etext, I have chosen to split the novel as the four-volume edition  does, with these titles: The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later,  Louise de la Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask. In the first two  etexts:    The Vicomte de Bragelonne (Etext 2609): It is the year 1660, and  D'Artagnan, after thirty-five years of loyal service, has become  disgusted with serving King Louis XIV while the real power resides with  the Cardinal Mazarin, and has tendered his resignation. He embarks on  his own project, that of restoring Charles II to the throne of England,  and, with the help of Athos, succeeds, earning himself quite a fortune  in the process. D'Artagnan returns to Paris to live the life of a rich  citizen, and Athos, after negotiating the marriage of Philip, the king's  brother, to Princess Henrietta of England, likewise retires to his own  estate, La Fere. Meanwhile, Mazarin has finally died, and left Louis to  assume the reigns of power, with the assistance of M. Colbert, formerly  Mazarin's trusted clerk. Colbert has an intense hatred for M. Fouquet,  the king's superintendent of finances, and has resolved to use any  means necessary to bring about his fall. With the new rank of intendant  bestowed on him by Louis, Colbert succeeds in having two of Fouquet's  loyal friends tried and executed. He then brings to the king's attention  that Fouquet is fortifying the island of Belle-Ile-en-Mer, and could  possibly be planning to use it as a base for some military operation  against the king. Louis calls D'Artagnan out of retirement and sends  him to investigate the island, promising him a tremendous salary and his  long-promised promotion to captain of the musketeers upon his return. At  Belle-Isle, D'Artagnan discovers that the engineer of the fortifications  is, in fact, Porthos, now the Baron du Vallon, and that's not all.  The blueprints for the island, although in Porthos's handwriting,  show evidence of another script that has been erased, that of Aramis.  D'Artagnan later discovers that Aramis has become the bishop of Vannes,  which is, coincidentally, a parish belonging to M. Fouquet. Suspecting  that D'Artagnan has arrived on the king's behalf to investigate, Aramis  tricks D'Artagnan into wandering around Vannes in search of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27118"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 2, April 1906 (#1)"],[1,"+-------------------------------------------------+  |Transcriber's note:                              |  |                                                 |  |Obvious typographical errors have been corrected |  +-------------------------------------------------+          MOTHER EARTH      [Illustration]      P.

Whoever severs himself from Mother Earth and her flowing sources of life  goes into exile. A vast part of civilization has ceased to feel the deep  relation with our mother. How they hasten and fall over one another, the  many thousands of the great cities; how they swallow their food,  everlastingly counting the minutes with cold hard faces; how they dwell  packed together, close to one another, above and beneath, in dark gloomy  stuffed holes, with dull hearts and insensitive heads, from the lack of  space and air! Economic necessity causes such hateful pressure. Economic  necessity? Why not economic stupidity? This seems a more appropriate  name for it. Were it not for lack of understanding and knowledge, the  necessity of escaping from the agony of an endless search for profit  would make itself felt more keenly.    Must the Earth forever be arranged like an ocean steamer, with large,  luxurious rooms and luxurious food for a select few, and underneath in  the steerage, where the great mass can barely breathe from dirt and the  poisonous air? Neither unconquerable external nor internal necessity  forces the human race to such life; that which keeps it in such  condition are ignorance and indifference.    [Illustration]    Since Turgenieff wrote his \"Fathers and Sons\" and the \"New Generation,\"  the appearance of the Revolutionary army in Russia has changed features.  At that time only the intellectuals and college youths, a small coterie  of idealists, who knew no distinction between class and caste, took part  in the tremendous work of reconstruction. The revolutionist of those  days had delicate white hands, lots of learning, aestheticism and a good  portion of nervousness. He attempted to go among the people, but the  people understood him not, for he did not speak the people's tongue. It  was a great effort for most of those brave ones to overcome their  disgust at the dirt and dense ignorance they met among the peasants, who  absolutely lacked comprehension of new ideas; therefore, there could be  no understanding between the intellectuals, who wanted to help, and the  sufferers, who needed help. These two elements were brought in closer  touch through industrialism. The Russian peasant, robbed of the means to  remain on his soil, was driven into the large industrial centres, and  there he learned to know those brave and heroic men and women who gave  up their comfort and career in their efforts for the liberation of their  people.    These ideas that have undergone such great changes in Russia within the  last decade should serve as good material for study for those who claim  the Russian Revolution is dead.    Nicholas Tchaykovsky, one of Russia's foremost workers in the  revolutionary movement, and one who, through beauty of character,  simplicity of soul and great strategical ability, has been the idol of  the Russian revolutionary youth for many years, is here as the delegate  of the Russian Revolutionary Socialist party, to raise funds for a new  uprising. He was right when he said, at the meeting in Grand Central  Palace, \"The Russian Revolution will live until the decayed and cowardly  regime of tyranny in Russia is rooted out of existence.\"    [Illustration]    The French have a new President. Loubet was succeeded by Fallieres. The  father of the new one was a great gormandizer of Pantagruelian  dimensions. He died of overloading his stomach. The son made his career  like a cautious upstart. He is well enough acquainted with himself to  know that he is not a Machiavelli. Therefore, he does not boast of his  sagacity, but rather of his integrity. A politician is irresistible to a  crowd when he cries out to them: \"My opponents express the suspicion  that I am a numskull. I do not care to argue the point with them, but  this I will say by the way of explanation, fellow citizens, that I am a  thoroughly honest man to the very roots of my hair.\" By this method one  can attain the presidency of a republic.    As Secretary of the Interior, Fallieres caused the arrest of the  Socialist poet, Clovis Hugues. At another time he declared: \"As long as  I am in office, I will not tolerate the red flag on the open street.\"    The French bourgeois have found in Fallieres their fitting man of straw  for seven years.    [Illustration]    The only genuine Democrat of these times is Death. He does not admit of  any class distinctions. He mows down a proletarian and a Marshall Field  with the same scythe. How imperfectly the world is arranged. It should  be possible to shift the bearing of children and the dying from the rich  to the poor--for good pay, of course.    [Illustration]    Whosoever believes that the law is infallible and can bring about order  in the chaotic social conditions, knows the curative effect of law to  the minutest detail. The question how things might be improved is met  with this reply: \"All criminals should be caught in a net like fish and  put away for safe keeping, so that society remains in the care of the  righteous.\" Hallelujah!    People with a capacity to judge for themselves think differently. Mr.  Charlton T. Lewis, President of the National Prison Association,  maintains:    \"Our county jails everywhere are the schools and colleges of crime. In  the light of social science it were better for the world if every one of  them were destroyed than that this work should be continued. Experience  shows that the system of imprisonment of minor offenders for short terms  is but a gigantic measure for the manufacture of criminals. Freedom, not  confinement, is the natural state of man, and the only condition under  which influences for reformation can have their full efficiency....  Prison life is unnatural at best. Man is a social creature. Confinement  tends to lower his consciousness of dignity and responsibility, to  weaken the motives which govern his relations to his race, to impair the  foundations of character and unfit him for independent life. To consign  a man to prison is commonly to enrol him in the criminal class.... With  all the solemnity and emphasis of which I am capable, I utter the  profound conviction, after twenty years of constant study of our prison  population, that more than nine-tenths of them ought never to have been  confined.\"    Government and authority are responsible for the conditions in the  western mining districts.    Is not the existence of government considered as a necessity on the  grounds that it is here to maintain peace, law and order? This is an  oft-repeated song.    Let us see how the government of Colorado has lived up to its calling  within the last few years. It has permitted that the labor protective  laws that have passed the legislature should be broken and trampled upon  by the mine owners.    The money powers care little for the eight-hour law, and when the mine  workers insisted upon keeping that law, the authorities of Colorado  immediately went to the rescue of the exploiters. Not only were police  and soldiers let loose upon the Western Federation of Miners; but the  government of Colorado permitted the mine owners to recruit an army to  fight the labor organizations. Hirelings were formed into a so-called  citizens' committee, that inaugurated a reign of terror. These legal  lawbreakers invaded peaceful homes during the day and night, and those  that were in the least suspected of belonging to or sympathizing with  the Western"]]]
