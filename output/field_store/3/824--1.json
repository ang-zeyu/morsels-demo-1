Voltaire was born in the year 1694.  He lived until within ten or eleven  years of the outbreak of the Great French Revolution, and was a chief  leader in the movement of thought that preceded the Revolution.  Though  he lived to his eighty-fourth year, Voltaire was born with a weak body.  His brother Armand, eight years his senior, became a Jansenist.  Voltaire  when ten years old was placed with the Jesuits in the College Louis-le-  Grand.  There he was taught during seven years, and his genius was  encouraged in its bent for literature; skill in speaking and in writing  being especially fostered in the system of education which the Jesuits  had planned to produce capable men who by voice and pen could give a  reason for the faith they held.  Verses written for an invalid soldier at  the age of eleven won for young Voltaire the friendship of Ninon  l'Enclos, who encouraged him to go on writing verses.  She died soon  afterwards, and remembered him with a legacy of two thousand livres for  purchase of books.  He wrote in his lively school-days a tragedy that  afterwards he burnt.  At the age of seventeen he left the College Louis-  le-Grand, where he said afterwards that he had been taught nothing but  Latin and the Stupidities.  He was then sent to the law schools, and saw  life in Paris as a gay young poet who, with all his brilliant liveliness,  had an aptitude for looking on the tragic side of things, and one of  whose first poems was an \"Ode on the Misfortunes of Life.\"  His mother  died when he was twenty.  Voltaire's father thought him a fool for his  versifying, and attached him as secretary to the Marquis of Chateauneuf;  when he went as ambassador to the Hague.  In December, 1713, he was  dismissed for his irregularities.  In Paris his unsteadiness and his  addiction to literature caused his father to rejoice in getting him  housed in a country chateau with M. de Caumartin.  M. de Caumartin's  father talked with such enthusiasm of Henri IV. and Sully that Voltaire  planned the writing of what became his _Henriade_, and his \"History of  the Age of Louis XIV.,\" who died on the 1st of September, 1715.    Under the regency that followed, Voltaire got into trouble again and  again through the sharpness of his pen, and at last, accused of verse  that satirised the Regent, he was locked up--on the 17th of May, 1717--in  the Bastille.  There he wrote the first two books of his _Henriade_, and  finished a play on OEdipus, which he had begun at the age of eighteen.  He  did not obtain full liberty until the 12th of April, 1718, and it was at  this time--with a clearly formed design to associate the name he took  with work of high attempt in literature--that Francois Marie Arouet, aged  twenty-four, first called himself Voltaire.    Voltaire's _OEdipe_ was played with success in November, 1718.  A few  months later he was again banished from Paris, and finished the  _Henriade_ in his retirement, as well as another play, _Artemise_, that  was acted in February, 1720.  Other plays followed.  In December, 1721,  Voltaire visited Lord Bolingbroke, who was then an exile from England, at  the Chateau of La Source.  There was now constant literary activity.  From  July to October, 1722, Voltaire visited Holland with Madame de  Rupelmonde.  After a serious attack of small-pox in November, 1723,  Voltaire was active as a poet about the Court.  He was then in receipt of  a pension of two thousand livres from the king, and had inherited more  than twice as much by the death of his father in January, 1722.  But in  December, 1725, a quarrel, fastened upon him by the Chevalier de Rohan,  who had him waylaid and beaten, caused him to send a challenge.  For this  he was arrested and lodged once more, in April, 1726, in the Bastille.  There he was detained a month; and his first act when he was released was  to ask for a passport to England.    Voltaire left France, reached London in August, 1726, went as guest to  the house of a rich merchant at Wandsworth, and remained three years in  this country, from the age of thirty-two to the age of thirty-five.  He  was here when George I. died, and George II. became king.  He published  here his _Henriade_.  He wrote here his \"History of Charles XII.\"  He  read \"Gulliver's Travels\" as a new book, and might have been present at  the first night of _The Beggar's Opera_.  He was here whet Sir Isaac  Newton died.    In 1731 he published at Rouen the _Lettres sur les Anglais_, which  appeared in England in 1733 in the volume from which they are here  reprinted.    H.M.          LETTERS ON ENGLAND      LETTER I.--ON THE QUAKERS      I was of opinion that the doctrine and history of so extraordinary a  people were worthy the attention of the curious.  To acquaint myself with  them I made a visit to one of the most eminent Quakers in England, who,  after having traded thirty years, had the wisdom to prescribe limits to  his fortune and to his desires, and was settled in a little solitude not  far from London.  Being come into it, I perceived a small but regularly  built house, vastly neat, but without the least pomp of furniture.  The  Quaker who owned it was a hale, ruddy-complexioned old man, who had never  been afflicted with sickness because he had always been insensible to  passions, and a perfect stranger to intemperance.  I never in my life saw  a more noble or a more engaging aspect than his.  He was dressed like  those of his persuasion, in a plain coat without pleats in the sides, or  buttons on the pockets and sleeves; and had on a beaver, the brims of  which were horizontal like those of our clergy.  He did not uncover  himself when I appeared, and advanced towards me without once stooping  his body; but there appeared more politeness in the open, humane air of  his countenance, than in the custom of drawing one leg behind the other,  and taking that from the head which is made to cover it.  \"Friend,\" says  he to me, \"I perceive thou art a stranger, but if I can do anything for  thee, only tell me.\"  \"Sir,\" said I to him, bending forwards and  advancing, as is usual with us, one leg towards him, \"I flatter myself  that my just curiosity will not give you the least offence, and that  you'll do me the honour to inform me of the particulars of your  religion.\"  \"The people of thy country,\" replied the Quaker, \"are too  full of their bows and compliments, but I never yet met with one of them  who had so much curiosity as thyself.  Come in, and let us first dine  together.\"  I still continued to make some very unseasonable ceremonies,  it not being easy to disengage one's self at once from habits we have  been long used to; and after taking part in a frugal meal, which began  and ended with a prayer to God, I began to question my courteous host.  I  opened with that which good Catholics have more than once made to  Huguenots.  \"My dear sir,\" said I, \"were you ever baptised?\"  \"I never  was,\" replied the Quaker, \"nor any of my brethren.\"  \"Zounds!\" say I to  him, \"you are not Christians, then.\"  \"Friend,\" replies the old man in a  soft tone of voice, \"swear not; we are Christians, and endeavour to be  good Christians, but we are not of opinion that the sprinkling water on a  child's head makes him a Christian.\"  \"Heavens!\" say I, shocked at his  impiety, \"you have then forgot that Christ was baptised by St. John.\"  \"Friend,\" replies the mild Quaker once again, \"swear not; Christ indeed  was baptised by John, but He himself never baptised anyone.  We are the  disciples of Christ, not of John.\"  I pitied very much the sincerity of  my worthy Quaker, and was absolutely for forcing him to get himself  christened.  \"Were that all,\" replied he very gravely, \"we would submit  cheerfully to baptism, purely in compliance with thy weakness, for we  don't condemn any person who uses it; but then we think that those who  profess a religion of so holy, so spiritual a nature as that of Christ,  ought to abstain to the utmost of their power from the Jewish  ceremonies.\"  \"O unaccountable!\" say I: \"what! baptism a Jewish  ceremony?\"  \"Yes, my friend,\" says he, \"so truly Jewish, that a great  many Jews use the baptism of John to this day.  Look into ancient  authors, and thou wilt find that John only revived this practice; and  that it had been used by the Hebrews, long before his time, in like  manner as the Mahometans imitated the Ishmaelites in their pilgrimages to  Mecca.  Jesus indeed submitted to the baptism of John, as He had suffered  Himself to be circumcised; but circumcision and the washing with water  ought to be abolished by the baptism of Christ, that baptism of the  Spirit, that ablution of the soul, which is the salvation of mankind.  Thus the forerunner said, 'I indeed baptise you with water unto  repentance; but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I  am not worthy to bear: he shall baptise you with the Holy Ghost and with  fire.'  Likewise Paul, the great apostle of the Gentiles, writes as  follows to the Corinthians, 'Christ sent me not to baptise, but to preach  the Gospel;' and indeed Paul never baptised but two persons with water,  and that very much against his inclinations.  He circumcised his disciple  Timothy, and the other disciples likewise circumcised all who were  willing to submit to that carnal ordinance.  But art thou circumcised?\"  added he.  \"I have not the honour to be so,\" say I.  \"Well, friend,\"  continues the Quaker, \"thou art a Christian without being circumcised,  and I am one without being baptised.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24461"],[0,"Third class in Indian railways (#1)"],[1,"was produced from images generously made available  by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)              THIRD CLASS IN INDIAN RAILWAYS      BY  M. K. GANDHI      GANDHI PUBLICATIONS LEAGUE  BHADARKALI-LAHORE          THIRD CLASS IN INDIAN RAILWAYS[1]      I have now been in India for over two years and a half after my return  from South Africa. Over one quarter of that time I have passed on the  Indian trains travelling third class by choice. I have travelled up  north as far as Lahore, down south up to Tranquebar, and from Karachi to  Calcutta. Having resorted to third class travelling, among other  reasons, for the purpose of studying the conditions under which this  class of passengers travel, I have naturally made as critical  observations as I could. I have fairly covered the majority of railway  systems during this period. Now and then I have entered into  correspondence with the management of the different railways about the  defects that have come under my notice. But I think that the time has  come when I should invite the press and the public to join in a crusade  against a grievance which has too long remained unredressed, though much  of it is capable of redress without great difficulty.    On the 12th instant I booked at Bombay for Madras by the mail train and  paid Rs. 13-9. It was labelled to carry 22 passengers. These could only  have seating accommodation. There were no bunks in this carriage whereon  passengers could lie with any degree of safety or comfort. There were  two nights to be passed in this train before reaching Madras. If not  more than 22 passengers found their way into my carriage before we  reached Poona, it was because the bolder ones kept the others at bay.  With the exception of two or three insistent passengers, all had to find  their sleep being seated all the time. After reaching Raichur the  pressure became unbearable. The rush of passengers could not be stayed.  The fighters among us found the task almost beyond them. The guards or  other railway servants came in only to push in more passengers.    A defiant Memon merchant protested against this packing of passengers  like sardines. In vain did he say that this was his fifth night on the  train. The guard insulted him and referred him to the management at the  terminus. There were during this night as many as 35 passengers in the  carriage during the greater part of it. Some lay on the floor in the  midst of dirt and some had to keep standing. A free fight was, at one  time, avoided only by the intervention of some of the older passengers  who did not want to add to the discomfort by an exhibition of temper.    On the way passengers got for tea tannin water with filthy sugar and a  whitish looking liquid mis-called milk which gave this water a muddy  appearance. I can vouch for the appearance, but I cite the testimony of  the passengers as to the taste.    Not during the whole of the journey was the compartment once swept or  cleaned. The result was that every time you walked on the floor or  rather cut your way through the passengers seated on the floor, you  waded through dirt.    The closet was also not cleaned during the journey and there was no  water in the water tank.    Refreshments sold to the passengers were dirty-looking, handed by  dirtier hands, coming out of filthy receptacles and weighed in equally  unattractive scales. These were previously sampled by millions of flies.  I asked some of the passengers who went in for these dainties to give  their opinion. Many of them used choice expressions as to the quality  but were satisfied to state that they were helpless in the matter; they  had to take things as they came.    On reaching the station I found that the ghari-wala would not take me  unless I paid the fare he wanted. I mildly protested and told him I  would pay him the authorised fare. I had to turn passive resister  before I could be taken. I simply told him he would have to pull me out  of the ghari or call the policeman.    The return journey was performed in no better manner. The carriage was  packed already and but for a friend's intervention I could not have been  able to secure even a seat. My admission was certainly beyond the  authorised number. This compartment was constructed to carry 9  passengers but it had constantly 12 in it. At one place an important  railway servant swore at a protestant, threatened to strike him and  locked the door over the passengers whom he had with difficulty squeezed  in. To this compartment there was a closet falsely so called. It was  designed as a European closet but could hardly be used as such. There  was a pipe in it but no water, and I say without fear of challenge that  it was pestilentially dirty.    The compartment itself was evil looking. Dirt was lying thick upon the  wood work and I do not know that it had ever seen soap or water.    The compartment had an exceptional assortment of passengers. There were  three stalwart Punjabi Mahomedans, two refined Tamilians and two  Mahomedan merchants who joined us later. The merchants related the  bribes they had to give to procure comfort. One of the Punjabis had  already travelled three nights and was weary and fatigued. But he could  not stretch himself. He said he had sat the whole day at the Central  Station watching passengers giving bribe to procure their tickets.  Another said he had himself to pay Rs. 5 before he could get his ticket  and his seat. These three men were bound for Ludhiana and had still more  nights of travel in store for them.    What I have described is not exceptional but normal. I have got down at  Raichur, Dhond, Sonepur, Chakradharpur, Purulia, Asansol and other  junction stations and been at the 'Mosafirkhanas' attached to these  stations. They are discreditable-looking places where there is no  order, no cleanliness but utter confusion and horrible din and noise.  Passengers have no benches or not enough to sit on. They squat on dirty  floors and eat dirty food. They are permitted to throw the leavings of  their food and spit where they like, sit how they like and smoke  everywhere. The closets attached to these places defy description. I  have not the power adequately to describe them without committing a  breach of the laws of decent speech. Disinfecting powder, ashes, or  disinfecting fluids are unknown. The army of flies buzzing about them  warns you against their use. But a third-class traveller is dumb and  helpless. He does not want to complain even though to go to these places  may be to court death. I know passengers who fast while they are  travelling just in order to lessen the misery of their life in the  trains. At Sonepur flies having failed, wasps have come forth to warn  the public and the authorities, but yet to no purpose. At the Imperial  Capital a certain third class booking-office is a Black-Hole fit only to  be destroyed.    Is it any wonder that plague has become endemic in India? Any other  result is impossible where passengers always leave some dirt where they  go and take more on leaving.    On Indian trains alone passengers smoke with impunity in all carriages  irrespective of the presence of the fair sex and irrespective of the  protest of non-smokers. And this, notwithstanding a bye-law which  prevents a passenger from smoking without the permission of his fellows  in the compartment which is not allotted to smokers.    The existence of the awful war cannot be allowed to stand in the way of  the removal of this gigantic evil. War can be no warrant for tolerating  dirt and overcrowding. One could understand an entire stoppage of  passenger traffic in a crisis like this, but never a continuation or  accentuation of insanitation and conditions that must undermine health  and morality.    Compare the lot of the first class passengers with that of the third  class. In the Madras case the first class fare is over five times as  much as the third class fare. Does the third class passenger get  one-fifth, even one-tenth, of the comforts of his first class fellow? It  is but simple justice to claim that some relative proportion be observed  between the cost and comfort.    It is a known fact that the third class traffic pays for the  ever-increasing luxuries of first and second class travelling. Surely a  third class passenger is entitled at least to the bare necessities of  life.    In neglecting the third class passengers, opportunity of giving a  splendid education to millions in orderliness, sanitation, decent  composite life and cultivation of simple and clean tastes is being lost.  Instead of receiving an object lesson in these matters third class  passengers have their sense of decency and cleanliness blunted during  their travelling experience.    Among the many suggestions that can be made for dealing with the evil  here described, I would respectfully include this: let the people in  high places, the Viceroy, the Commander-in-Chief, the Rajas, Maharajas,  the Imperial Councillors and others, who generally travel in superior  classes, without previous warning, go through the experiences now and  then of third class travelling. We would then soon see a remarkable  change in the conditions of third class travelling and the uncomplaining  millions will get some return for the fares they pay under the  expectation of being carried from place to place with ordinary creature  comforts.
