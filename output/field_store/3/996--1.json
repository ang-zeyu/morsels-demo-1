MACLEOD MALLOCH              \"As crafty lawyers to acquire applause      Try various arts to get a double cause,      So does an author, rummaging his brain,      By various methods, try to entertain.\"        PASQUIN.          PREFACE      The scope of this volume is indicated by its title--a presentation of  the lighter side of law, as it is exhibited from time to time in the  witty remarks, repartees, and _bon mots_ of the Bench and Bar of Great  Britain, Ireland, and America. The idea of presenting such a collection  of legal _facetiae_ originated with the late Mr. D. Macleod Malloch, and  it is greatly to be regretted that by his untimely death, his share of  the work had reached the stage of selecting only about one-half of the  material included in the book. His knowledge of law, and his wide  reading in legal biography, was such as would have increased  considerably the value of this volume.    In addition to sources which are acknowledged in the text, I have to  mention contributions drawn from the following works: W. D. Adams'  _Modern Anecdotes_; W. Andrews' _The Lawyer in History, Literature and  Humour_; Croake James's _Curiosities of Law_; F. R. O'Flanagan's _The  Irish Bar_; and A. Engelbach's comprehensive and entertaining _Anecdotes  of the Bench and Bar_. I am further indebted to Sir James Balfour Paul,  Lyon King of Arms, for permission to include \"The Circuiteer's Lament,\"  from the privately printed volume _Ballads of the Bench and Bar_, and to  the editor of the _Edinburgh Evening Dispatch_ for a number of the more  recent anecdotes in the Scottish chapters of the book.

MORTON    AND D. MACLEOD MALLOCH          CHAPTER ONE    THE JUDGES OF ENGLAND      Mr. Justice Darling, whose witty remarks from the Bench are so much  appreciated by his audiences in Court, and, it is rumoured, are not  always received with approval by his brother judges, says, in his  amusing book _Scintillae Juris_:    \"It is a common error to suppose that our law has no sense of humour,  because for the most part the judges who expound it have none.\"    But law is, after all, a serious business--at any rate for the  litigants--and it would appear also for the attorneys, for while  witticisms of the Bench and Bar abound, very few are recorded of the  attorney and his client. \"Law is law\" wrote the satirist who decided not  to adopt it as a profession. \"Law is like a country dance; people are  led up and down in it till they are tired. Law is like a book of  surgery--there are a great many terrible cases in it. It is also like  physic--they who take least of it are best off. Law is like a homely  gentlewoman--very well to follow. Law is like a scolding wife--very bad  when it follows us. Law is like a new fashion--people are bewitched to  get into it. It is also like bad weather--most people are glad when they  get out of it.\"    From very early times there have appeared on the Bench expounders of the  law who by the phrase \"for the most part\" must be acquitted of Mr.  Justice Darling's charge of having no sense of humour; judges who, like  himself, have lightened the otherwise dreary routine of duty by  pleasantries which in no way interfered with the course of justice. One  of the earliest of our witty judges, whose brilliant sayings have come  down to us, was Henry VIII's Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas More, who lost  his head because he would not acknowledge his king as head of the  Church. To Sir Thomas Manners, Earl of Rutland, who had made a somewhat  insolent remark, the Lord Chancellor quietly replied, 'Honores mutant  mores'--Honours change manners. Sir Thomas's humour was what may be  called _quiet_, because its effect did not immediately show itself in  boisterous merriment, but would undoubtedly remain long in the  remembrance of those to whom it was addressed. Made with as much  courtesy as irony, is it likely his keeper in the Tower would ever  forget his remark? \"Assure yourself I do not dislike my cheer; but  whenever I do, then spare not to thrust me out of your doors.\" Nor did  his quaint humour desert him at the scaffold: \"Master Lieutenant,\" said  he, \"I pray you see me safe up; for my coming down let me shift for  myself.\" Even with his head on the block he could not resist a humorous  remark, when putting aside his beard he said to the executioner, \"Wait,  my good friend, till I have removed my beard, for it has never offended  his highness.\"    Another judge of the sixteenth century, Sir Nicholas Bacon, who  resembled Sir Thomas More in the gentleness of his happiest speeches,  could also on occasion exhibit an unnecessary coarseness in his jocular  retorts. A circuit story is told of him in which a convicted felon named  Hog appealed for remission of his sentence on the ground that he was  related to his lordship. \"Nay, my friend,\" replied the judge, \"you and I  cannot be kindred except you be hanged, for hog is not bacon until it be  well hung.\" This retort was not quite so coarse as that attributed to  the Scottish judge, Lord Kames, two centuries later, who on sentencing  to death a man with whom he had often played chess and very frequently  been beaten, added after the solemn words of doom, \"And noo, Matthew,  ye'll admit that's checkmate for you.\"    To Lord Chancellor Hatton, also an Elizabethan judge who aimed at  sprightliness on the Bench, a clever _mot_ is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30014"],[0,"Native Son (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration]                      NATIVE SON                       _By                  T. D. Hamm_           Tommy hated Earth, knowing his mother   might go home to Mars without him. Worse,   would a robot secretly take her place?...      Tommy Benton, on his first visit to Earth, found the long-anticipated  wonders of twenty-first-century New York thrilling the first week,  boring and unhappy the second week, and at the end of the third he was  definitely ready to go home.    The never-ending racket of traffic was torture to his abnormally acute  ears. Increased atmospheric pressure did funny things to his chest and  stomach. And quick and sure-footed on Mars, he struggled constantly  against the heavy gravity that made all his movements clumsy and  uncoordinated.    The endless canyons of towering buildings, with their connecting  Skywalks, oppressed and smothered him. Remembering the endless vistas of  _rabbara_ fields beside a canal that was like an inland sea,  homesickness flooded over him.    He hated the people who stared at him with either open or hidden  amusement. His Aunt Bee, for instance, who looked him up and down with  frank disapproval and said loudly, \"For Heavens sake, Helen! Take him to  a _good_ tailor and get those bones covered up!\"    Was it his fault he was six inches taller than Terran boys his age, and  had long, thin arms and legs? Or that his chest was abnormally developed  to compensate for an oxygen-thin atmosphere? I'd like to see _her_, he  thought fiercely, out on the Flatlands; she'd be gasping like a  canal-fish out of water.    Even his parents, happily riding the social merry-go-round of Terra,  after eleven years in the Martian flatlands, didn't seem to understand  how he felt.    \"Don't you _like_ Earth, Tommy?\" queried his mother anxiously.    \"Oh ... it's all right, I guess.\"    \"... 'A nice place to visit' ...\" said his father sardonically.    \"... 'but I wouldn't live here if they gave me the place!' ...\" said his  mother, and they both burst out laughing for no reason that Tommy could  see. Of course, they did that lots of times at home and Tommy laughed  with them just for the warm, secure feeling of belonging. This time he  didn't feel like laughing.    \"When _are_ we going home?\" he repeated stubbornly.    His father pulled Tommy over in the crook of his arm and said gently,  \"Well, not right away, son. As a matter of fact, how would you like to  stay here and go to school?\"    Tommy pulled away and looked at him incredulously.    \"I've _been_ to school!\"    \"Well, yes,\" admitted his father. \"But only to the colony schools. You  don't want to grow up and be an ignorant Martian sandfoot all your life,  do you?\"    \"Yes, I do! I _want_ to be a Martian sandfoot. And I want to go home  where people don't _look_ at me and say, 'So this is your little  Martian!'\"    Benton, Sr., put his arm around Tommy's stiffly resistant shoulders.  \"Look here, old man,\" he said persuasively. \"I thought you wanted to be  a space engineer. You can't do that without an education you know. And  your Aunt Bee will take good care of you.\"    Tommy faced him stubbornly. \"I don't want to be any old spaceman. I want  to be a sandfoot like old Pete. And I want to go home.\"    Helen bit back a smile at the two earnest, stubborn faces so  ridiculously alike, and hastened to avert the gathering storm.    \"Now look, fellows. Tommy's career doesn't have to be decided in the  next five minutes ... after all, he's only ten. He can make up his mind  later on if he wants to be an engineer or a _rabbara_ farmer. Right now,  he's going to stay here and go to school ... _and_ I'm staying with  him.\"    Resolutely avoiding both crestfallen faces, Helen, having shepherded  Tommy to bed, returned to the living room acutely conscious of Big Tom's  bleak, hurt gaze at her back.    \"Helen, you're going to make a sissy out of the boy,\" he said at last.  \"There isn't any reason why he can't stay here at home with Bee.\"    Helen turned to face him.    \"Earth _isn't_ home to Tommy. And your sister Bee told him he ought to  be out playing football with the boys instead of hanging around the  house.\"    \"But she knows the doctor said he'd have to take it easy for a year till  he was accustomed to the change in gravity and air-pressure,\" he  answered incredulously.    \"Exactly. She also asked me,\" Helen went on grimly, \"if I thought he'd  be less of a freak as he got older.\"    Tom Benton swore. \"Bee always did have less sense than the average hen,\"  he gritted. \"My son a freak! Hell's-bells!\"    Tommy, arriving at the hall door in time to hear the tail-end of the  sentence, crept back to bed feeling numb and dazed. So even his father  thought he was a freak.           *       *       *       *       *    The last few days before parting was one of strain for all of them. If  Tommy was unnaturally subdued, no one noticed it; his parents were not  feeling any great impulse toward gaiety either.    They all went dutifully sight-seeing as before; they saw the Zoo, and  went shopping on the Skywalks, and on the last day wound up at the great  showrooms of \"Androids, Inc.\"    Tommy had hated them on sight; they were at once too human and too  inhuman for comfort. The hotel was full of them, and most private homes  had at least one. Now they saw the great incubating vats, and the  processing and finally the showroom where one of the finished products  was on display as a maid, sweeping and dusting.    \"There's one that's a dead-ringer for you, Helen. If you were a little  better looking, that is.\" Tommy's dad pretended to compare them  judicially. Helen laughed, but Tommy looked at him with a resentfulness.  Comparing his mother to an Android....    \"They say for a little extra you can get an exact resemblance. Maybe I'd  better have one fixed up like you to take back with me,\" Big Tom added  teasingly. Then as Helen's face clouded over, \"Oh, hon, you know I was  only kidding. Let's get out of here; this place gives me the  collywobbles. Besides, I've got to pick up my watch.\"    But his mother's face was still unhappy and Tommy glowered sullenly at  his father's back all the way to the watch-shop.    It was a small shop, with an inconspicuous sign down in one corner of  the window that said only, \"KRUMBEIN--watches,\" and was probably the  most famous shop of its kind in the world. Every spaceman landing on  Terra left his watch to be checked by the dusty, little old man who was  the genius of the place. Tommy ranged wide-eyed about the clock and  chronometer crammed interior. He stopped fascinated before the last  case. In it was a watch ... but, _what_ a watch! Besides the regulation  Terran dial, it had a second smaller dial that registered the  corresponding time on Mars. Tommy's whole heart went out to it in an  ecstasy of longing. He thought wistfully that if you could know what  time it was there, you could imagine what everyone was doing and it  wouldn't seem so far away. Haltingly, he tried to explain.    \"Look, Mom,\" he said breathlessly. \"It's almost five o'clock at home.  Douwie will be coming up to the barn to be fed. Gosh, do you suppose old  Pete will remember about her?\"    His mother smiled at him reassuringly. \"Of course he will, silly. Don't  forget he was the one who caught and tamed her for you.\"    Tommy gulped as he thought of Douwie. Scarcely as tall as himself; the  big, rounded, mouselike ears, and the flat, cloven pads that could carry  her so swiftly over the sandy Martian flatlands. One of the last  dwindling herds of native Martian douwies, burden-carriers of a vanished  race, she had been Tommy's particular pride and joy for the last three  years.    Behind him, Tommy heard his mother murmur under her breath, \"Tom ... the  watch; _could_ we?\"    And his Dad regretfully, \"It's a pretty expensive toy for a youngster,  Helen. And even a _rabbara_ raiser's bank account has limits.\"    \"Of course, dear; it was silly of me.\" Helen smiled a little ruefully.  \"And if Mr. Krumbein has your watch ready, we _must_ go. Bee and some of  her friends are coming over, and it's only a few hours 'till you ...  leave.\"    Big Tom squeezed her elbow gently, understandingly, as she blinked back  quick tears. Trailing after them, Tommy saw the little by-play and his  heart ached. The guilt-complex building up in him grew and deepened.    He knew he had only to say, \"Look, I don't mind staying. Aunt Bee and I  will get along swell,\" and everything would be all right again. Then the  terror of this new and complex world--as it would be without a familiar  face--swept over him and kept him silent.    His overwrought feelings expressed themselves in a nervously rebelling  stomach, culminating in a disgraceful moment over the nearest gutter.  The rest of the afternoon he spent in bed recuperating.    In the living room Aunt Bee spoke her mind in her usual, high-pitched  voice.    \"It's disgraceful, Helen. A boy his age.... None of the _Bentons_ ever  had nerves.\"    His mother's reply was inaudible, but on the heels of his father's  deeper tones, Aunt Bee's voice rose in rasping indignation.    \"_Well!_ I never! And from my own brother, too. From now on don't come  to me for help with your spoiled brat. Good-_bye_!\"    The door slammed indignantly, his mother chuckled, and there was a  spontaneous burst of laughter. Tommy relaxed and lay back happily.  Anyway, that was the last of Aunt Bee!           *       *       *       *       *    The next hour or two passed in a flurry of ringing phones, people coming  and going, and last-minute words and reminders. Then suddenly it was  time to leave. Dad burst in for a last quick hug and a promise to send  him pictures of Douwie and her foal, due next month; Mother dropped a  hasty kiss on his hair and promised to hurry back from the Spaceport.  Then Tommy was alone, with a large, painful lump where his heart ought  to be.    The only activity was the almost noiseless"]]]
