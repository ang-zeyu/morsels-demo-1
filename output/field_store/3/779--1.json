I really have other things to engage  me.\"  So spoke Sherlock Holmes and turned back to the great scrapbook  in which he was arranging and indexing some of his recent material.    But the landlady had the pertinacity and also the cunning of her sex.  She held her ground firmly.    \"You arranged an affair for a lodger of mine last year,\" she said--\"Mr.  Fairdale Hobbs.\"    \"Ah, yes--a simple matter.\"    \"But he would never cease talking of it--your kindness, sir, and the  way in which you brought light into the darkness.  I remembered his  words when I was in doubt and darkness myself.  I know you could if you  only would.\"    Holmes was accessible upon the side of flattery, and also, to do him  justice, upon the side of kindliness.  The two forces made him lay down  his gum-brush with a sigh of resignation and push back his chair.    \"Well, well, Mrs. Warren, let us hear about it, then.  You don't object  to tobacco, I take it?  Thank you, Watson--the matches! You are uneasy,  as I understand, because your new lodger remains in his rooms and you  cannot see him.  Why, bless you, Mrs. Warren, if I were your lodger you  often would not see me for weeks on end.\"    \"No doubt, sir; but this is different.  It frightens me, Mr. Holmes.  I  can't sleep for fright.  To hear his quick step moving here and moving  there from early morning to late at night, and yet never to catch so  much as a glimpse of him--it's more than I can stand.  My husband is as  nervous over it as I am, but he is out at his work all day, while I get  no rest from it.  What is he hiding for?  What has he done?  Except for  the girl, I am all alone in the house with him, and it's more than my  nerves can stand.\"    Holmes leaned forward and laid his long, thin fingers upon the woman's  shoulder.  He had an almost hypnotic power of soothing when he wished.  The scared look faded from her eyes, and her agitated features smoothed  into their usual commonplace.  She sat down in the chair which he had  indicated.    \"If I take it up I must understand every detail,\" said he.  \"Take time  to consider.  The smallest point may be the most essential. You say  that the man came ten days ago and paid you for a fortnight's board and  lodging?\"    \"He asked my terms, sir.  I said fifty shillings a week.  There is a  small sitting-room and bedroom, and all complete, at the top of the  house.\"    \"Well?\"    \"He said, 'I'll pay you five pounds a week if I can have it on my own  terms.'  I'm a poor woman, sir, and Mr. Warren earns little, and the  money meant much to me.  He took out a ten-pound note, and he held it  out to me then and there.  'You can have the same every fortnight for a  long time to come if you keep the terms,' he said.  'If not, I'll have  no more to do with you.'    \"What were the terms?\"    \"Well, sir, they were that he was to have a key of the house. That was  all right.  Lodgers often have them.  Also, that he was to be left  entirely to himself and never, upon any excuse, to be disturbed.\"    \"Nothing wonderful in that, surely?\"    \"Not in reason, sir.  But this is out of all reason.  He has been there  for ten days, and neither Mr. Warren, nor I, nor the girl has once set  eyes upon him.  We can hear that quick step of his pacing up and down,  up and down, night, morning, and noon; but except on that first night  he had never once gone out of the house.\"    \"Oh, he went out the first night, did he?\"    \"Yes, sir, and returned very late--after we were all in bed.  He told  me after he had taken the rooms that he would do so and asked me not to  bar the door.  I heard him come up the stair after midnight.\"    \"But his meals?\"    \"It was his particular direction that we should always, when he rang,  leave his meal upon a chair, outside his door.  Then he rings again  when he has finished, and we take it down from the same chair.  If he  wants anything else he prints it on a slip of paper and leaves it.\"    \"Prints it?\"    \"Yes, sir; prints it in pencil.  Just the word, nothing more. Here's  the one I brought to show you--soap.  Here's another--match. This is  one he left the first morning--daily gazette.  I leave that paper with  his breakfast every morning.\"    \"Dear me, Watson,\" said Homes, staring with great curiosity at the  slips of foolscap which the landlady had handed to him, \"this is  certainly a little unusual.  Seclusion I can understand; but why print?  Printing is a clumsy process.  Why not write?  What would it suggest,  Watson?\"    \"That he desired to conceal his handwriting.\"    \"But why?  What can it matter to him that his landlady should have a  word of his writing?  Still, it may be as you say.  Then, again, why  such laconic messages?\"    \"I cannot imagine.\"    \"It opens a pleasing field for intelligent speculation.  The words are  written with a broad-pointed, violet-tinted pencil of a not unusual  pattern.  You will observe that the paper is torn away at the side here  after the printing was done, so that the 's' of 'soap' is partly gone.  Suggestive, Watson, is it not?\"    \"Of caution?\"    \"Exactly.  There was evidently some mark, some thumbprint, something  which might give a clue to the person's identity.  Now. Mrs. Warren,  you say that the man was of middle size, dark, and bearded.  What age  would he be?\"    \"Youngish, sir--not over thirty.\"    \"Well, can you give me no further indications?\"    \"He spoke good English, sir, and yet I thought he was a foreigner by  his accent.\"    \"And he was well dressed?\"    \"Very smartly dressed, sir--quite the gentleman.  Dark clothes--nothing  you would note.\"    \"He gave no name?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"And has had no letters or callers?\"    \"None.\"    \"But surely you or the girl enter his room of a morning?\"    \"No, sir; he looks after himself entirely.\"    \"Dear me! that is certainly remarkable.  What about his luggage?\"    \"He had one big brown bag with him--nothing else.\"    \"Well, we don't seem to have much material to help us.  Do you say  nothing has come out of that room--absolutely nothing?\"    The landlady drew an envelope from her bag; from it she shook out two  burnt matches and a cigarette-end upon the table.    \"They were on his tray this morning.  I brought them because I had  heard that you can read great things out of small ones.\"    Holmes shrugged his shoulders.    \"There is nothing here,\" said he.  \"The matches have, of course, been  used to light cigarettes.  That is obvious from the shortness of the  burnt end.  Half the match is consumed in lighting a pipe or cigar.  But, dear me! this cigarette stub is certainly remarkable.  The  gentleman was bearded and moustached, you say?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"I don't understand that.  I should say that only a clean-shaven man  could have smoked this.  Why, Watson, even your modest moustache would  have been singed.\"    \"A holder?\" I suggested.    \"No, no; the end is matted.  I suppose there could not be two people in  your rooms, Mrs. Warren?\"    \"No, sir.  He eats so little that I often wonder it can keep life in  one.\"    \"Well, I think we must wait for a little more material.  After all, you  have nothing to complain of.  You have received your rent, and he is  not a troublesome lodger, though he is certainly an unusual one.  He  pays you well, and if he chooses to lie concealed it is no direct  business of yours.  We have no excuse for an intrusion upon his privacy  until we have some reason to think that there is a guilty reason for  it.  I've taken up the matter, and I won't lose sight of it.  Report to  me if anything fresh occurs, and rely upon my assistance if it should  be needed.    \"There are certainly some points of interest in this case, Watson,\" he  remarked when the landlady had left us.  \"It may, of course, be  trivial--individual eccentricity; or it may be very much deeper than  appears on the surface.  The first thing that strikes one is the obvious  possibility that the person now in the rooms may be entirely different  from the one who engaged them.\"    \"Why should you think so?\"    \"Well, apart from this cigarette-end, was it not suggestive that the  only time the lodger went out was immediately after his taking the  rooms?  He came back--or someone came back--when all witnesses were out  of the way.  We have no proof that the person who came back was the  person who went out.  Then, again, the man who took the rooms spoke  English well.  This other, however, prints 'match' when it should have  been 'matches.'  I can imagine that the word was taken out of a  dictionary, which would give the noun but not the plural.  The laconic  style may be to conceal the absence of knowledge of English.  Yes,  Watson, there are good reasons to suspect that there has been a  substitution of lodgers.\"    \"But for what possible end?\"    \"Ah! there lies our problem.  There is one rather obvious line of  investigation.\"  He took down the great book in which, day by day, he  filed the agony columns of the various London journals. \"Dear me!\" said  he, turning over the pages, \"what a chorus of groans, cries, and  bleatings!  What a rag-bag of singular happenings!  But surely the most  valuable hunting-ground that ever was given to a student of the  unusual!  This person is alone and cannot be approached by letter  without a breach of that absolute secrecy which is desired.  How is any  news or any message to reach him from without?  Obviously by  advertisement through a newspaper.  There seems no other way, and  fortunately we need concern ourselves with the one paper only.  Here  are the Daily Gazette extracts of the last fortnight.  'Lady with a  black boa at Prince's Skating Club'--that we may pass.

From the Monday to the Thursday I doubt  whether it was ever possible from our windows in Baker Street to see  the loom of the opposite houses.  The first day Holmes had spent in  cross-indexing his huge book of references. The second and third had  been patiently occupied upon a subject which he had recently made his  hobby--the music of the Middle Ages.  But when, for the fourth time,  after pushing back our chairs from breakfast we saw the greasy, heavy  brown swirl still drifting past us and condensing in oily drops upon  the window-panes, my comrade's impatient and active nature could endure  this drab existence no longer.  He paced restlessly about our  sitting-room in a fever of suppressed energy, biting his nails, tapping  the furniture, and chafing against inaction.    \"Nothing of interest in the paper, Watson?\" he said.    I was aware that by anything of interest, Holmes meant anything of  criminal interest.  There was the news of a revolution, of a possible  war, and of an impending change of government; but these did not come  within the horizon of my companion.  I could see nothing recorded in  the shape of crime which was not commonplace and futile.  Holmes  groaned and resumed his restless meanderings.    \"The London criminal is certainly a dull fellow,\" said he in the  querulous voice of the sportsman whose game has failed him. \"Look out  this window, Watson.  See how the figures loom up, are dimly seen, and  then blend once more into the cloud-bank.  The thief or the murderer  could roam London on such a day as the tiger does the jungle, unseen  until he pounces, and then evident only to his victim.\"    \"There have,\" said I, \"been numerous petty thefts.\"    Holmes snorted his contempt.    \"This great and sombre stage is set for something more worthy than  that,\" said he.  \"It is fortunate for this community that I am not a  criminal.\"    \"It is, indeed!\" said I heartily.    \"Suppose that I were Brooks or Woodhouse, or any of the fifty men who  have good reason for taking my life, how long could I survive against  my own pursuit?  A summons, a bogus appointment, and all would be over.  It is well they don't have days of fog in the Latin countries--the  countries of assassination.  By Jove! here comes something at last to  break our dead monotony.\"    It was the maid with a telegram.  Holmes tore it open and burst out  laughing.    \"Well, well!  What next?\" said he.  \"Brother Mycroft is coming round.\"    \"Why not?\" I asked.    \"Why not?  It is as if you met a tram-car coming down a country lane.  Mycroft has his rails and he runs on them.  His Pall Mall lodgings, the  Diogenes Club, Whitehall--that is his cycle.  Once, and only once, he  has been here.  What upheaval can possibly have derailed him?\"    \"Does he not explain?\"    Holmes handed me his brother's telegram.        \"Must see you over Cadogan West.  Coming at once.\"         MYCROFT.    \"Cadogan West?  I have heard the name.\"    \"It recalls nothing to my mind.  But that Mycroft should break out in  this erratic fashion!  A planet might as well leave its orbit.  By the  way, do you know what Mycroft is?\"    I had some vague recollection of an explanation at the time of the  Adventure of the Greek Interpreter.    \"You told me that he had some small office under the British  government.\"    Holmes chuckled.    \"I did not know you quite so well in those days.  One has to be  discreet when one talks of high matters of state.  You are right in  thinking that he is under the British government.  You would also be right  in a sense if you said that occasionally he IS the British government.\"    \"My dear Holmes!\"    \"I thought I might surprise you.  Mycroft draws four hundred and fifty  pounds a year, remains a subordinate, has no ambitions of any kind,  will receive neither honour nor title, but remains the most  indispensable man in the country.\"    \"But how?\"    \"Well, his position is unique.  He has made it for himself. There has  never been anything like it before, nor will be again. He has the  tidiest and most orderly brain, with the greatest capacity for storing  facts, of any man living.  The same great powers which I have turned to  the detection of crime he has used for this particular business.  The  conclusions of every department are passed to him, and he is the  central exchange, the clearinghouse, which makes out the balance.  All  other men are specialists, but his specialism is omniscience.  We will  suppose that a minister needs information as to a point which involves  the Navy, India, Canada and the bimetallic question; he could get his  separate advices from various departments upon each, but only Mycroft  can focus them all, and say offhand how each factor would affect the  other.  They began by using him as a short-cut, a convenience; now he  has made himself an essential.  In that great brain of his everything  is pigeon-holed and can be handed out in an instant.  Again and again  his word has decided the national policy.  He lives in it.  He thinks  of nothing else save when, as an intellectual exercise, he unbends if I  call upon him and ask him to advise me on one of my little problems.  But Jupiter is descending to-day.  What on earth can it mean?  Who is  Cadogan West, and what is he to Mycroft?\"    \"I have it,\" I cried, and plunged among the litter of papers upon the  sofa.  \"Yes, yes, here he is, sure enough!  Cadogan West was the young  man who was found dead on the Underground on Tuesday morning.\"    Holmes sat up at attention, his pipe halfway to his lips.    \"This must be serious, Watson.  A death which has caused my brother to  alter his habits can be no ordinary one.  What in the world can he have  to do with it?  The case was featureless as I remember it.  The young  man had apparently fallen out of the train and killed himself.  He had  not been robbed, and there was no particular reason to suspect  violence.  Is that not so?\"    \"There has been an inquest,\" said I, \"and a good many fresh facts have  come out.  Looked at more closely, I should certainly say that it was a  curious case.\"    \"Judging by its effect upon my brother, I should think it must be a  most extraordinary one.\"  He snuggled down in his armchair. \"Now,  Watson, let us have the facts.\"    \"The man's name was Arthur Cadogan West.  He was twenty-seven years of  age, unmarried, and a clerk at Woolwich Arsenal.\"    \"Government employ.  Behold the link with Brother Mycroft!\"    \"He left Woolwich suddenly on Monday night.  Was last seen by his  fiancee, Miss Violet Westbury, whom he left abruptly in the fog about  7:30 that evening.  There was no quarrel between them and she can give  no motive for his action.  The next thing heard of him was when his  dead body was discovered by a plate-layer named Mason, just outside  Aldgate Station on the Underground system in London.\"    \"When?\"    \"The body was found at six on Tuesday morning.  It was lying wide of  the metals upon the left hand of the track as one goes eastward, at a  point close to the station, where the line emerges from the tunnel in  which it runs.  The head was badly crushed--an injury which might well  have been caused by a fall from the train.  The body could only have  come on the line in that way. Had it been carried down from any  neighbouring street, it must have passed the station barriers, where a  collector is always standing.  This point seems absolutely certain.\"    \"Very good.  The case is definite enough.  The man, dead or alive,  either fell or was precipitated from a train.  So much is clear to me.  Continue.\"    \"The trains which traverse the lines of rail beside which the body was  found are those which run from west to east, some being purely  Metropolitan, and some from Willesden and outlying junctions.  It can  be stated for certain that this young man, when he met his death, was  travelling in this direction at some late hour of the night, but at  what point he entered the train it is impossible to state.\"    \"His ticket, of course, would show that.\"    \"There was no ticket in his pockets.\"    \"No ticket!  Dear me, Watson, this is really very singular. According  to my experience it is not possible to reach the platform of a  Metropolitan train without exhibiting one's ticket. Presumably, then,  the young man had one.  Was it taken from him in order to conceal the  station from which he came?  It is possible.  Or did he drop it in the  carriage?  That is also possible.  But the point is of curious  interest.  I understand that there was no sign of robbery?\"    \"Apparently not.  There is a list here of his possessions.  His purse  contained two pounds fifteen.  He had also a check-book on the Woolwich  branch of the Capital and Counties Bank.  Through this his identity was  established.  There were also two dress-circle tickets for the Woolwich  Theatre, dated for that very evening.  Also a small packet of technical  papers.\"    Holmes gave an exclamation of satisfaction.    \"There we have it at last, Watson!  British government--Woolwich.  Arsenal--technical papers--Brother Mycroft, the chain is complete.  But  here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to speak for himself.\"    A moment later the tall and portly form of Mycroft Holmes was ushered  into the room.  Heavily built and massive, there was a suggestion of  uncouth physical inertia in the figure, but above this unwieldy frame  there was perched a head so masterful in its brow, so alert in its  steel-gray, deep-set eyes, so firm in its lips, and so subtle in its  play of expression, that after the first glance one forgot the gross  body and remembered only the dominant mind.    At his heels came our old friend Lestrade, of Scotland Yard--thin and  austere.  The gravity of both their faces foretold some weighty quest.  The"]]]
