BY WM. P. UPHAM.        PEABODY:    PRESS OF C. H. SHEPARD,    1904.          [Illustration: Map]          HOUSE OF JOHN PROCTER    WITCHCRAFT MARTYR, 1692.      [A paper read by William P. Upham at a meeting of the Peabody  Historical Society at the Needham house, West Peabody, September 2nd.,  1903.]    It is now nearly forty years since I assisted my father, the late  Charles W. Upham, in the preparation of his work on Salem Village and  the Witchcraft tragedy of 1692, by collecting what information could  be obtained from the records as to the people and their homes in  that locality. In doing this I was enabled to construct a map showing  the bounds of the grants and farms at that time. On that map is  represented quite accurately the Downing Farm, so called, owned, in  1638, by Emanuel Downing, father of Sir George Downing, and occupied  as tenant, in 1692, by John Procter, the victim of the witchcraft  delusion. When I made the map I knew that John Procter at his death  owned, as appears by the inventory of his estate, fifteen acres of  land in Salem, but I was not able then to locate it with exactness.  Lately, in making a more complete study of the records relating to the  Downing farm and the surrounding lands I have learned the exact  situation of the fifteen acre lot owned by him, and also that he had a  house upon it as early as 1682 and until his death in 1692. It appears  that this lot is the place where he was buried, according to the  family tradition, although the knowledge as to its being once owned by  him seems to have passed out of the neighborhood for more than a  century.    This lot is indicated, on the accompanying map of the locality which I  have drawn for the purpose, by heavy dark lines. It was on the north  side of Lowell Street in West Peabody, just west of the westernmost  line of the Downing Farm and about one hundred and fifty rods east  from the place of this meeting, which is the Needham homestead on the  Newburyport Turnpike, or Newbury Street as it is now called, marked on  the map as then, in 1692, the home of Anthony Needham, Junior.    The discovery that this was John Procter's land called to mind a  conversation I had with Mrs. Jacobs, an aged lady who lived in the old  Jacobs house, now the Wyman place, and of which I made the following  memorandum about thirty years ago:--    \"Mrs. Jacobs (Munroe) says that it was always said that Procters were  buried near the bars as you go into the Philip H. Saunders place. Mr.  James Marsh says he always heard that John Procter, of witch time, was  buried there.\"    Upon inquiring lately of Mrs. Osborn, the librarian of the Peabody  Historical Society, as to what was the family tradition, I learned  that it was said by Mrs. Hannah B. Mansfield, of Danvers, that John  Procter was buried \"opposite to the Colcord\" (now the Wyman) \"pasture,  amongst the rocks.\" In answer to an inquiry by Mrs. Osborn, Mrs.  Mansfield wrote to her as follows:--\"A great aunt took me, when a  little girl, with her to a spot in a rocky hill where she picked  blackberries, and said there was the place 'among birch trees and  rocks where our ancestor of witchcraft notoriety was buried.' It was  on the north side of Lowell Street in what was then called the Marsh  pasture nearly opposite the Jacobs farm which is on the south side of  Lowell Street.\"    The Marsh pasture from which Mrs. Mansfield's aunt pointed out the  \"birch trees and rocks\" near by where John Procter was buried was, no  doubt, the pasture conveyed by James Marsh to Philip H. Saunders, 11  June, 1863, and then described as \"thirteen acres known by the name of  Bates Pasture.\" I do not know of any other place near there that would  be called the Marsh pasture at the time Mrs. Mansfield mentions. This  thirteen acre pasture was conveyed by Ezekiel Marsh to John Marsh, 15  Oct., 1819, having been devised to him by his father Ezekiel Marsh. It  had a way leading to it from Lowell Street over the eastern end of the  John Procter lot as shown on my map. This way is still used as well as  the bars opening into it on Lowell Street a few rods east of the  westerly way leading southerly to the Jacobs, or Wyman, place. These  are the \"bars as you go into the Philip H. Saunders place\" mentioned  by Mrs. Jacobs as stated above, unless we suppose the expression to  mean bars leading from the John Procter lot where the way enters the  Philip H. Saunders place, or Marsh pasture, as Mrs. Mansfield calls  it. Perhaps the latter locality is the most probable since it is high  rocky ground; but which bars were meant is uncertain.    Mr. Daniel H. Felton, who has an intimate knowledge of the history of  all the lands about Felton's Hill, and is himself a descendant of John  Procter, informs me that Mrs. Hannah B. Mansfield some years since  related to him \"that she went berrying at the Jacobs farm when she was  a child and that older persons said that John Procter was buried on  the opposite side of the way (among the rocks) from where they turned  off from Lowell Street to go to the Jacobs farm.\" Mrs. Mansfield lived  when a child on the Newburyport Turnpike opposite the Needham  homestead. It was, I understand, her \"aunt Betsey Gardner\" who, when  picking blackberries \"on a rocky hill\" pointed out to her the place  \"among birch trees and rocks\" where John Procter was buried.    To reconcile these traditions with the known facts, we may suppose,  as related by Mrs. Jacobs and Mrs. Mansfield, that the place of burial  was pointed out to them from the high land on the Jacobs place south  of Lowell Street, where the \"rocky hill\" and the bars leading into the  Marsh pasture on the north side of Lowell Street could be plainly  seen. Subsequently Mrs. Mansfield's aunt took her to the rocky hill  itself and pointed out the exact spot, probably close to where the  bars lead into the Marsh pasture, now the Saunders place. In going  home from the Jacobs farm they would turn into Lowell Street at the  old way near the house marked \"White\" on my map, and some ten rods  westerly from the way above mentioned leading from the opposite side  of Lowell Street to the Saunders place. This way from the Jacobs place  is a very old way. Mr. Felton tells me: \"I recollect that my father  said over forty years ago that the gate posts of locust were nearly  one hundred years old then.\"    Two hundred years ago the Saunders place, formerly the Marsh pasture,  was part of the large tract of homestead land owned by Anthony  Needham. This Needham land included eight acres of land conveyed by  Anthony Needham to his son-in-law, Thomas Gould, 26 Sept., 1705, and  conveyed to Thomas Gardner 27 Jan., 1743, by George Gould, the son of  Thomas Gould. The eight acre lot descended to John Gardner and from  him to John Gardner Walcott, and is where John G. Walcott, Jun., now  lives.    The land which I find to be identical with the fifteen acre lot owned  by John Procter is on the north side of Lowell Street between the  above mentioned eight acre lot, now the home of John G. Walcott, Jun.,  and the lot marked \"Flint Pasture\" on my map, the Procter lot being  enclosed by heavy black lines. The westerly part of the Flint Pasture  was conveyed, 17 Sept., 1898, to John D. Dennis, who lives there now.    The uniform family tradition that John Procter was buried in the  locality I have thus described, is confirmed in my mind from a  consideration of certain facts, bearing with more or less definiteness  upon the question, which I will endeavor briefly to recite.    It is well known that the victims executed as witches on Gallows Hill  in Salem, in 1692, were thrown into mere shallow graves or crevices in  the ledge under the gallows, where the nature of the ground did not  allow complete burial, so that it was stated at the time that portions  of the bodies were hardly covered at all. It was natural that the  relatives of those thus cruelly put to death and left practically  without burial, should, where they were able and courageous enough for  the dangerous undertaking, remove the bodies to their homes for  interment. It is the tradition that this was done in several cases,  secretly and during the night, that it might not incur the opposition  of the frenzied and deluded people. This removal was made by the  children of Rebecca Nourse, and a beautiful monument now marks the  spot to which her body was removed. There is a similar tradition in  the Procter family, and there is good reason to believe that his body  was removed in a similar manner. But if so, the necessary secrecy with  which the sad duty was performed has caused the place where he was  buried to be known only by the slender thread of tradition which I  have mentioned.    The boulder inscribed to the memory of John Procter, which was  dedicated this past year at the junction of Lowell and Summit Streets  in Peabody, must be considered to have been placed there not as  indicating the locality of his burial, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/274"],[0,"Disputation of Doctor Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences (#1)"],[1,"of Doctor Martin Luther    on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences    by Dr. Martin Luther, 1517      Published in:    Works of Martin Luther    Adolph Spaeth, L.D. Reed, Henry Eyster Jacobs, et Al., Trans. & Eds.    (Philadelphia: A. J. Holman Company, 1915), Vol. 1, pp. 29-38.            DISPUTATION OF DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER    ON THE POWER AND EFFICACY OF    INDULGENCES    OCTOBER 31, 1517    Out of love for the truth and the desire to bring it to light, the  following propositions will be discussed at Wittenberg, under the  presidency of the Reverend Father Martin Luther, Master of Arts and of  Sacred Theology, and Lecturer in Ordinary on the same at that place.  Wherefore he requests that those who are unable to be present and  debate orally with us, may do so by letter.    In the Name our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.    1. Our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, when He said Poenitentiam agite,  willed that the whole life of believers should be repentance.    2. This word cannot be understood to mean sacramental penance, i.e.,  confession and satisfaction, which is administered by the priests.    3. Yet it means not inward repentance only; nay, there is no inward  repentance which does not outwardly work divers mortifications of the  flesh.    4. The penalty [of sin], therefore, continues so long as hatred of self  continues; for this is the true inward repentance, and continues until  our entrance into the kingdom of heaven.    5. The pope does not intend to remit, and cannot remit any penalties  other than those which he has imposed either by his own authority or by  that of the Canons.    6. The pope cannot remit any guilt, except by declaring that it has  been remitted by God and by assenting to God's remission; though, to be  sure, he may grant remission in cases reserved to his judgment. If his  right to grant remission in such cases were despised, the guilt would  remain entirely unforgiven.    7. God remits guilt to no one whom He does not, at the same time,  humble in all things and bring into subjection to His vicar, the  priest.  8. The penitential canons are imposed only on the living, and,  according to them, nothing should be imposed on the dying.    9. Therefore the Holy Spirit in the pope is kind to us, because in his  decrees he always makes exception of the article of death and of  necessity.    10. Ignorant and wicked are the doings of those priests who, in the  case of the dying, reserve canonical penances for purgatory.    11. This changing of the canonical penalty to the penalty of purgatory  is quite evidently one of the tares that were sown while the bishops  slept.    12. In former times the canonical penalties were imposed not after, but  before absolution, as tests of true contrition.    13. The dying are freed by death from all penalties; they are already  dead to canonical rules, and have a right to be released from them.    14. The imperfect health [of soul], that is to say, the imperfect love,  of the dying brings with it, of necessity, great fear; and the smaller  the love, the greater is the fear.    15. This fear and horror is sufficient of itself alone (to say nothing  of other things) to constitute the penalty of purgatory, since it is  very near to the horror of despair.    16. Hell, purgatory, and heaven seem to differ as do despair,  almost-despair, and the assurance of safety.    17. With souls in purgatory it seems necessary that horror should grow  less and love increase.    18. It seems unproved, either by reason or Scripture, that they are  outside the state of merit, that is to say, of increasing love.    19. Again, it seems unproved that they, or at least that all of them,  are certain or assured of their own blessedness, though we may be quite  certain of it.    20. Therefore by \"full remission of all penalties\" the pope means not  actually \"of all,\" but only of those imposed by himself.    21. Therefore those preachers of indulgences are in error, who say that  by the pope's indulgences a man is freed from every penalty, and saved;    22. Whereas he remits to souls in purgatory no penalty which, according  to the canons, they would have had to pay in this life.  23. If it is  at all possible to grant to any one the remission of all penalties  whatsoever, it is certain that this remission can be granted only to  the most perfect, that is, to the very fewest.    24. It must needs be, therefore, that the greater part of the people  are deceived by that indiscriminate and highsounding promise of release  from penalty.    25. The power which the pope has, in a general way, over purgatory, is  just like the power which any bishop or curate has, in a special way,  within his own diocese or parish.    26. The pope does well when he grants remission to souls [in  purgatory], not by the power of the keys (which he does not possess),  but by way of intercession.    27. They preach man who say that so soon as the penny jingles into the  money-box, the soul flies out [of purgatory].    28. It is certain that when the penny jingles into the money-box, gain  and avarice can be increased, but the result of the intercession of the  Church is in the power of God alone.    29. Who knows whether all the souls in purgatory wish to be bought out  of it, as in the legend of Sts. Severinus and Paschal.    30. No one is sure that his own contrition is sincere; much less that  he has attained full remission.    31. Rare as is the man that is truly penitent, so rare is also the man  who truly buys indulgences, i.e., such men are most rare.    32. They will be condemned eternally, together with their teachers, who  believe themselves sure of their salvation because they have letters of  pardon.    33. Men must be on their guard against those who say that the pope's  pardons are that inestimable gift of God by which man is reconciled to  Him;    34. For these \"graces of pardon\" concern only the penalties of  sacramental satisfaction, and these are appointed by man.    35. They preach no Christian doctrine who teach that contrition is not  necessary in those who intend to buy souls out of purgatory or to buy  confessionalia.    36. Every truly repentant Christian has a right to full remission of  penalty and guilt, even without letters of pardon.    37. Every true Christian, whether living or dead, has part in all the  blessings of Christ and the Church; and this is granted him by God,  even without letters of pardon.    38. Nevertheless, the remission and participation [in the blessings of  the Church] which are granted by the pope are in no way to be despised,  for they are, as I have said, the declaration of divine remission.    39. It is most difficult, even for the very keenest theologians, at one  and the same time to commend to the people the abundance of pardons and  [the need of] true contrition.    40. True contrition seeks and loves penalties, but liberal pardons only  relax penalties and cause them to be hated, or at least, furnish an  occasion [for hating them].    41. Apostolic pardons are to be preached with caution, lest the people  may falsely think them preferable to other good works of love.    42. Christians are to be taught that the pope does not intend the  buying of pardons to be compared in any way to works of mercy.    43. Christians are to be taught that he who gives to the poor or lends  to the needy does a better work than buying pardons;    44. Because love grows by works of love, and man becomes better; but by  pardons man does not grow better, only more free from penalty.    45. Christians are to be taught that he who sees a man in need, and  passes him by, and gives [his money] for pardons, purchases not the  indulgences of the pope, but the indignation of God.    46. Christians are to be taught that unless they have more than they  need, they are bound to keep back what is necessary for their own  families, and by no means to squander it on pardons.    47. Christians are to be taught that the buying of pardons is a matter  of free will, and not of commandment.    48. Christians are to be taught that the pope, in granting pardons,  needs, and therefore desires, their devout prayer for him more than the  money they bring.    49. Christians are to be taught that the pope's pardons are useful, if  they do not put their trust in them; but altogether harmful, if through  them they lose their fear of God.    50. Christians are to be taught that if the pope knew the exactions of  the pardon-preachers, he would rather that St.  Peter's church should  go to ashes, than that it should be built up with the skin, flesh and  bones of his sheep.    51. Christians are to be taught that it would be the pope's wish, as it  is his duty, to give of his own money to very many of those from whom  certain hawkers of pardons cajole money, even though the church of St.  Peter might have to be sold.    52. The assurance of salvation by letters of pardon is vain, even  though the commissary, nay, even though the pope himself, were to stake  his soul upon it.    53. They are enemies of Christ and of the pope, who bid the Word of God  be altogether silent in some Churches, in order that pardons may be  preached in others.    54. Injury is done the Word of God when, in the same sermon, an equal  or a longer time is spent on pardons than on this Word.    55. It must be the intention of the pope that if pardons, which are a  very small thing, are celebrated with one bell, with single processions  and ceremonies, then the Gospel, which is the very greatest thing,  should be preached with a hundred bells, a hundred processions, a  hundred ceremonies.    56. The \"treasures of the Church,\" out of which the pope grants  indulgences, are not sufficiently named or known among the people of  Christ.    57. That they are not temporal treasures is certainly evident, for many  of the vendors do not pour out such treasures so easily, but only  gather them.    58. Nor are they the merits of"]]]
