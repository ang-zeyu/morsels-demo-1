[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2284"],[0,"Animal Heroes (#1)"],[1,"Heroes      by    Ernest Thompson Seton          Note to Reader    A hero is an individual of unusual gifts and achievements. Whether it  be man or animal, this definition applies; and it is the histories of  such that appeal to the imagination and to the hearts of those who hear  them.    In this volume every one of the stories, though more or less composite,  is founded on the actual life of a veritable animal hero. The most  composite is the White Reindeer. This story I wrote by Utrovand in  Norway during the summer of 1900, while the Reindeer herds grazed in  sight on the near uplands.    The Lynx is founded on some of my own early experiences in the  backwoods.    It is less than ten years since the 'Jack Warhorse' won his hero-crown.  Thousands of \"Kaskadoans\" will remember him, and by the name Warhorse  his coursing exploits are recorded in several daily papers.    The least composite is Arnaux. It is so nearly historical that several  who knew the bird have supplied additional items of information.    The nest of the destroying Peregrines, with its owners and their young,  is now to be seen in the American Museum of Natural History of New  York. The Museum authorities inform me that Pigeon badges with the  following numbers were found in the nest: 9970-S, 1696, U. 63, 77, J.  F. 52, Ex. 705, 6-1894, C 20900. Perhaps some Pigeon-lover may learn  from these lines the fate of one or other wonderful flier that has long  been recorded \"never returned.\"          CONTENTS      THE SLUM CAT    ARNAUX--The Chronicle of a Homing Pigeon    BADLANDS BILLY--The Wolf that Won    THE BOY AND THE LYNX    LITTLE WARHORSE--The History of a Jack-rabbit    SNAP--The Story of a Bull-Terrier    THE WINNIPEG WOLF    THE LEGEND OF THE WHITE REINDEER          THE SLUM CAT    LIFE I    I    \"M-e-a-t! M-e-a-t!\" came shrilling down Scrimper's Alley. Surely the  Pied Piper of Hamelin was there, for it seemed that all the Cats in the  neighborhood were running toward the sound, though the Dogs, it must be  confessed, looked scornfully indifferent.    \"Meat! Meat!\" and louder; then the centre of attraction came in view--a  rough, dirty little man with a push-cart; while straggling behind him  were a score of Cats that joined in his cry with a sound nearly the  same as his own. Every fifty yards, that is, as soon as a goodly throng  of Cats was gathered, the push-cart stopped. The man with the magic  voice took out of the box in his cart a skewer on which were pieces of  strong-smelling boiled liver. With a long stick he pushed the pieces  off. Each Cat seized on one, and wheeling, with a slight depression of  the ears and a little tiger growl and glare, she rushed away with her  prize to devour it in some safe retreat.    \"Meat! Meat!\" And still they came to get their portions. All were well  known to the meat-man. There was Castiglione's Tiger; this was Jones's  Black; here was Pralitsky's \"Torkershell,\" and this was Madame Danton's  White; there sneaked Blenkinshoff's Maltee, and that climbing on the  barrow was Sawyer's old Orange Billy, an impudent fraud that never had  had any financial backing,--all to be remembered and kept in account.  This one's owner was sure pay, a dime a week; that one's doubtful.  There was John Washee's Cat, that got only a small piece because John  was in arrears. Then there was the saloon-keeper's collared and  ribboned ratter, which got an extra lump because the 'barkeep' was  liberal; and the rounds-man's Cat, that brought no cash, but got  unusual consideration because the meat-man did. But there were others.  A black Cat with a white nose came rushing confidently with the rest,  only to be repulsed savagely. Alas! Pussy did not understand. She had  been a pensioner of the barrow for months. Why this unkind change? It  was beyond her comprehension. But the meat-man knew. Her mistress had  stopped payment. The meat-man kept no books but his memory, and it  never was at fault.    Outside this patrician 'four hundred' about the barrow, were other  Cats, keeping away from the push-cart because they were not on the  list, the Social Register as it were, yet fascinated by the heavenly  smell and the faint possibility of accidental good luck. Among these  hangers-on was a thin gray Slummer, a homeless Cat that lived by her  wits--slab-sided and not over-clean. One could see at a glance that she  was doing her duty by a family in some out-of-the-way corner. She kept  one eye on the barrow circle and the other on the possible Dogs.    She saw a score of happy Cats slink off with their delicious 'daily'  and their tiger-like air, but no opening for her, till a big Tom of her  own class sprang on a little pensioner with intent to rob. The victim  dropped the meat to defend herself against the enemy, and before the  'all-powerful' could intervene, the gray Slummer saw her chance, seized  the prize, and was gone.    She went through the hole in Menzie's side door and over the wall at  the back, then sat down and devoured the lump of liver, licked her  chops, felt absolutely happy, and set out by devious ways to the  rubbish-yard, where, in the bottom of an old cracker-box, her family  was awaiting her. A plaintive mewing reached her ears. She went at  speed and reached the box to see a huge Black Tom-cat calmly destroying  her brood. He was twice as big as she, but she went at him with all her  strength, and he did as most animals will do when caught wrong-doing,  he turned and ran away. Only one was left, a little thing like its  mother, but of more pronounced color--gray with black spots, and a  white touch on nose, ears, and tail-tip. There can be no question of  the mother's grief for a few days; but that wore off, and all her care  was for the survivor. That benevolence was as far as possible from the  motives of the murderous old Tom there can be no doubt; but he proved a  blessing in deep disguise, for both mother and Kit were visibly  bettered in a short time. The daily quest for food continued. The  meat-man rarely proved a success, but the ash-cans were there, and if  they did not afford a meat-supply, at least they were sure to produce  potato-skins that could be used to allay the gripe of hunger for  another day.    One night the mother Cat smelt a wonderful smell that came from the  East River at the end of the alley. A new smell always needs  investigating, and when it is attractive as well as new, there is but  one course open. It led Pussy to the docks a block away, and then out  on a wharf, away from any cover but the night. A sudden noise, a growl  and a rush, were the first notice she had that she was cut off by her  old enemy, the Wharf Dog. There was only one escape. She leaped from  the wharf to the vessel from which the smell came. The Dog could not  follow, so when the fish-boat sailed in the morning Pussy unwillingly  went with her and was seen no more.      II    The Slum Kitten waited in vain for her mother. The morning came and  went. She became very hungry. Toward evening a deep-laid instinct drove  her forth to seek food. She slunk out of the old box, and feeling her  way silently among the rubbish, she smelt everything that seemed  eatable, but without finding food. At length she reached the wooden  steps leading down into Jap Malee's bird-store underground. The door  was open a little. She wandered into a world of rank and curious smells  and a number of living things in cages all about her. A negro was  sitting idly on a box in a corner. He saw the little stranger enter and  watched it curiously. It wandered past some Rabbits. They paid no heed.  It came to a wide-barred cage in which was a Fox. The gentleman with  the bushy tail was in a far corner. He crouched low; his eyes glowed.  The Kitten wandered, sniffing, up to the bars, put its head in, sniffed  again, then made toward the feed-pan, to be seized in a flash by the  crouching Fox. It gave a frightened \"mew,\" but a single shake cut that  short and would have ended Kitty's nine lives at once, had not the  negro come to the rescue. He had no weapon and could not get into the  cage, but he spat with such copious vigor in the Fox's face that he  dropped the Kitten and returned to the corner, there to sit blinking  his eyes in sullen fear.    The negro pulled the Kitten out. The shake of the beast of prey seemed  to have stunned the victim, really to have saved it much suffering. The  Kitten seemed unharmed, but giddy. It tottered in a circle for a time,  then slowly revived, and a few minutes later was purring in the negro's  lap, apparently none the worse, when Jap Malee, the bird-man, came home.    Jap was not an Oriental; he was a full-blooded Cockney, but his eyes  were such little accidental slits aslant in his round, flat face, that  his first name was forgotten in the highly descriptive title of \"Jap.\"  He was not especially unkind to the birds and beasts whose sales were  supposed to furnish his living, but his eye was on the main chance; he  knew what he wanted. He didn't want the Slum Kitten.    The negro gave it all the food it could eat, then carried it to a  distant block and dropped it in a neighboring iron-yard.      III    One full meal is as much as any one needs in two or three days, and  under the influence of this stored-up heat and power, Kitty was very  lively. She walked around the piled-up rubbish, cast curious glances on  far-away Canary-birds in cages that hung from high windows; she peeped  over fences, discovered a large Dog, got quietly down again, and  presently finding a sheltered place in full sunlight, she lay down and  slept for an hour. A slight 'sniff' awakened her, and before her stood  a large Black Cat with glowing green eyes, and the thick neck and  square jaws that distinguish the Tom; a scar marked his cheek, and his  left ear was torn. His look was far from friendly; his ears moved  backward a little, his tail twitched, and a faint, deep sound came from  his throat.

[1643.] At the era of discovery by Tasman, Van Diemen's Land was  inhabited. He heard, or thought he heard, the voices of people and the  sound of a trumpet: he noticed the recently cut notches, five feet  asunder, on the bark of the trees, and he saw the smoke of fires. He  inferred that they possessed some unusual method of climbing, or that  their stature was gigantic. In the sound, the colonist recognises the  vocal _cooey_ of the aborigines, and learns from the steps \"to the  _birds' nests_,\" that they then hunted the opossum, and employed that  method of ascent, which, for agility and daring has never been  surpassed. Thus, during more than 150 years, this country was forgotten;  and such were the limits of European knowledge, when the expedition of  Cook was dispatched by Great Britain to explore this hemisphere. No  navigator brought larger views, and a temper more benevolent, to the  task of discovery. To some nations he opened the path of civilisation  and religion: to this race he was the harbinger of death.    [1773.] Furneaux, Captain Cook's second in command, first visited this  country. He saw the fires of the natives, ten miles off. They had left  their huts, formed but for a day, in which were fragments of fish,  baskets, and spears. The British deposited gun-flints, barrels, and  nails, in payment for the relics they removed; and they left Adventure  Bay, concluding that a "]]]
