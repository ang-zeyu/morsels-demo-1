Sir,    I have the honour to report on the activities of the General Assembly  Library for the year 1957-58.    The year 1958 marks the end of the first century of the Library's  existence, I have thought it a good opportunity to tell briefly the  history of the Library during the period in an appendix to this report.                                 THE YEAR'S WORK    Staff changes have not been as great during the past year, though  Mr C. B. Newick resigned to go overseas and there were four other  resignations and appointments. Fortunately these did not greatly affect  the senior staff.    Routine work has mainly occupied the staff though stock was taken of  class 500 (science) and 600 (useful arts). A few books were missing but  losses are not serious.    During the year the new circulation counter was erected in the lobby  downstairs. Not only does it improve the appearance of the area, but  the change has enabled proper oversight to be given over those leaving  the Library. The new books are now placed in the room next to my office  and are immediately available to members.                                   ACQUISITIONS    Once again the Library has to record its thanks to the many individuals  and organisations for their kindness in presenting large numbers of  books and periodicals. All have received letters of thanks, but once  again we should like to express our thanks to those concerned for so  much material that might otherwise not reach the Library. This year one  donation was of such value and importance that it must be specially  mentioned. It was the gift of 350 books by the Carnegie Corporation of  New York. This collection has been specially selected to portray United  States life and to explain its origins. It has proved exceedingly  popular and has added many fine books on the United States to the  Library. The Library is grateful to the Corporation for its generosity  in presenting the collection.    During the year 8,375 books were catalogued and added to the  collections, compared with 7,650 during 1956-57. They were classed as  follows, the figures in parentheses being those for the previous year:  general works, 370 (420); newspapers, 238 (156); philosophy, 73 (67);  religion, 375 (414); sociology, 2,413 (2,275); parliamentary papers,  332 (423); philology, 56 (47); natural sciences, 393 (331); useful  arts, 1,023 (847); fine arts, 333 (312); literature, 440 (320); history  and travel, 1,099 (1,107); biography, 506 (421); fiction, 724 (510).  Total accessions now number 247,825.    A better guide to the stocks of the Library is the estimate prepared in  connection with the census of libraries being held this year. A quick  count of the books on 1 April 1958 gave a total of 240,450, plus 65,960  pamphlets and 18,860 maps. The figure for pamphlets is, I believe,  slightly exaggerated as many are little more than single sheets and  others now listed as several pamphlets will eventually be made into a  single bound volume.                                COPYRIGHT DEPOSIT    Every attempt continues to be made to ensure that all material coming  within the terms of the Act is deposited and preserved. During the year  an inquiry was held into the Copyright Act and evidence was given on  deposit and on some minor changes of the law that are needed.    Copyright receipts were issued during 1957 for 961 items, that is for  books, pamphlets, and first issues of periodicals other than those  issued by Government Departments, an increase from 778 in 1956. In  addition 193 annual reports, 78 yearbooks and almanacs, 149 bulletins,  163 school magazines, and 260 local body balance sheets were received.  In view of the deposit of this latter material in the Library it is no  longer thought necessary for it to be laid on the table of the House.    Further details relating to publishing in New Zealand are given in the  following table:    --------------+----+--+---+---+----+--+--+---+---+---+---+--+---+-----                |G W |P |R  |S  |P P |P |S |U A|F A|G L|H T|B |M  |T                |e o |h |e  |o  |a a |h |c |s r|i r|e i|i r|i |a  |o                |n r |i |l  |c  |r p |i |i |e t|n t|n t|s a|o |p  |t                |e k |l |i  |i  |l e |l |e |f s|e s|e e|t v|g |s  |a                |r s |o |g  |o  |i r |o |n |u  |   |r r|o e|r |   |l                |a   |s |i  |l  |a s |l |c |l  |   |a a|r l|a |   |                |l   |o |o  |o  |m   |o |e |   |   |l t|y  |p |   |                |    |p |n  |g  |e e |g |  |   |   |  u|   |h |   |                |    |h |   |y  |n t |y |  |   |   |  r|a  |y |   |                |    |y |   |   |t c |  |  |   |   |  e|n  |  |   |                |    |  |   |   |a . |  |  |   |   |   |d  |  |   |                |    |  |   |   |r   |  |  |   |   |   |   |  |   |                |    |  |   |   |y   |  |  |   |   |   |   |  |   |  --------------+----+--+---+---+----+--+--+---+---+---+---+--+---+-----  Commercial--  |    |  |   |   |    |  |  |   |   |   |   |  |   |    Books       | 2  | 5| 28| 74|    | 1| 9| 71|21 |18 |43  10|   |  282    Pamphlets   | 7  | 2|121| 95|    |  |15| 46|13 |15 |19 | 7|   |  340    Maps        |    |  |   |   |    |  |  |   |   |   |   |  | 30|   30                |    |  |   |   |    |  |  |   |   |   |   |  |   |  Government    |    |  |   |   |    |  |  |   |   |   |   |  |   |  publications--|    |  |   |   |    |  |  |   |   |   |   |  |   |    Books       | 4  |  |   | 29|118 | 2|15|13 | 2 |   | 4 |  |   |  187    Pamphlets   |    |  |   | 56|233 | 1|10|72 | 9 | 1 | 3 |  |   |  385    Maps        |    |  |   |   |    |  |  |   |   |   |      |105|  105                +----+--+---+---+----+--+--+---+---+---+---+--+---+-----  Total         |13  | 7|149|254|351 | 4|49|202|45 |34 |69  17|135|1,329  --------------+----+--+---+---+----+--+--+---+---+---+---+--+---+-----    During 1956, 272 books, 284 pamphlets, and 4 maps were issued by  commercial publishers, while 107 books, 312 pamphlets, and 120 maps  were issued by Government Departments. This gave a total of 1,099  items.                                   MICROFILMING    The microfilming of newspapers continues. During the year 31,900 ft of  film were added to the New Zealand newspaper collection and 10,000 ft  to the other series.                                     BINDERY    As in the past the bindery has proved a valuable and economical section  of the Library. The campaign to enforce the deposit provisions of the  Copyright Act has shown in the bindery's work and during the year 4,662  books were bound before being placed on the shelves and 470 volumes  were rebound. Included in the latter were some volumes of newspapers,  for many originally bound in leather have needed repair. They are  rebound in canvas, a material which should wear much better than  today's leather does.                               USE OF THE LIBRARY    Twenty-eight thousand two hundred and nine books were borrowed from  the Library in the year under review, compared with 27,462 in the  previous year. Of these 494 were sent to libraries other than those of  Government Departments through the New Zealand Library Association  interloan scheme. The Library in its turn borrowed 23 books from other  libraries under the same scheme.    In addition to members of Parliament, some thousand people have access  to the Library and enjoy borrowing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25049"],[0,"My Reminiscences of the Anglo-Boer War (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net            [Transcriber's note: Obvious printer's errors have been corrected, all  other inconsistencies are as in the original.

PREFACE.      General Ben Viljoen, while engaged on this work, requested me to write  a short introduction to it. This request I gladly comply with.    General Viljoen was a prisoner-of-war at Broadbottom Camp, St. Helena,  where, after two years' service in South Africa, I was stationed with  my regiment. It was at the General's further request that I conveyed  this work to Europe for publication.    The qualities which particularly endeared this brave and justly-famous  Boer officer to us were his straightforwardness and unostentatious  manner, his truthfulness, and the utter absence of affectation that  distinguishes him. I am certain that he has written his simple  narrative with candour and impartiality, and I feel equally certain,  from what I know of him, that this most popular of our late opponents  has reviewed the exciting episodes of the War with an honesty, an  intelligence, and a humour which many previous publications on the War  have lacked.    During his stay at St. Helena I became deeply attached to General  Viljoen; and in conclusion I trust that this work, which entailed many  hours of labour, will yield him a handsome recompense.

In offering my readers my reminiscences of the late War, I feel that  it is necessary to ask their indulgence and to plead extenuating  circumstances for many obvious shortcomings.    It should be pointed out that the preparation of this work was  attended with many difficulties and disabilities, of which the  following were only a few:--         (1) This is my first attempt at writing a book, and as a       simple Afrikander I lay no claim to any literary ability.         (2) When captured by the British forces I was deprived of       all my notes, and have been compelled to consult and depend       largely upon my memory for my facts and data. I would wish       to add, however, that the notes and minutiae they took from       me referred only to events and incidents covering six months       of the War. Twice before my capture, various diaries I had       compiled fell into British hands; and on a third occasion,       when our camp at Dalmanutha was burned out by a       \"grass-fire,\" other notes were destroyed.         (3) I wrote this book while a prisoner-of-war, fettered, as       it were, by the strong chains with which a British \"parole\"       is circumscribed. I was, so to say, bound hand and foot, and       always made to feel sensibly the humiliating position to       which we, as prisoners-of-war on this island, were reduced.       Our unhappy lot was rendered unnecessarily unpleasant by the       insulting treatment offered us by Colonel Price, who       appeared to me an excellent prototype of Napoleon's       custodian, Sir Hudson Lowe. One has only to read Lord       Rosebery's work, \"The Last Phase of Napoleon,\" to realise       the insults and indignities Sir Hudson Lowe heaped upon a       gallant enemy.    We Boers experienced similar treatment from our custodian, Colonel  Price, who appeared to be possessed with the very demon of distrust  and who conjured up about us the same fantastic and mythical plans of  escape as Sir Hudson Lowe attributed to Napoleon. It is to his absurd  suspicions about our safe custody that I trace the bitterly offensive  regulations enforced on us.    While engaged upon this work, Colonel Price could have pounced down  upon me at any moment, and, having discovered the manuscript, would  certainly have promptly pronounced the writing of it in conflict with  the terms of my \"parole.\"    I have striven as far as possible to refrain from criticism, except  when compelled to do so, and to give a coherent story, so that the  reader may easily follow the episodes I have sketched. I have also  endeavoured to be impartial, or, at least, so impartial as an erring  human being can be who has just quitted the bloody battlefields of a  bitter struggle.    But the sword is still wet, and the wound is not yet healed.    I would assure my readers that it has not been without hesitation that  I launch this work upon the world. There have been many amateur and  professional writers who have preceded me in overloading the reading  public with what purport to be \"true histories\" of the War. But having  been approached by friends to add my little effort to the ponderous  tomes of War literature, I have written down that which I saw with my  own eyes, and that which I personally experienced. If seeing is  believing, the reader may lend credence to my recital of every  incident I have herein recounted.    During the last stages of the struggle, when we were isolated from the  outside world, we read in newspapers and other printed matter captured  from the British so many romantic and fabulous stories about  ourselves, that we were sometimes in doubt whether people in Europe  and elsewhere would really believe that we were ordinary human beings  and not legendary monsters.
