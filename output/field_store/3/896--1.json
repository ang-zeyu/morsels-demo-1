The End of the Middle Ages          PART ONE        Chapter I: The Bertolini    \"The Signora had no business to do it,\" said Miss Bartlett, \"no business  at all. She promised us south rooms with a view close together, instead  of which here are north rooms, looking into a courtyard, and a long way  apart. Oh, Lucy!\"    \"And a Cockney, besides!\" said Lucy, who had been further saddened by  the Signora's unexpected accent. \"It might be London.\" She looked at the  two rows of English people who were sitting at the table; at the row  of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between the  English people; at the portraits of the late Queen and the late Poet  Laureate that hung behind the English people, heavily framed; at the  notice of the English church (Rev. Cuthbert Eager, M. A. Oxon.), that  was the only other decoration of the wall. \"Charlotte, don't you feel,  too, that we might be in London? I can hardly believe that all kinds of  other things are just outside. I suppose it is one's being so tired.\"    \"This meat has surely been used for soup,\" said Miss Bartlett, laying  down her fork.    \"I want so to see the Arno. The rooms the Signora promised us in her  letter would have looked over the Arno. The Signora had no business to  do it at all. Oh, it is a shame!\"    \"Any nook does for me,\" Miss Bartlett continued; \"but it does seem hard  that you shouldn't have a view.\"    Lucy felt that she had been selfish. \"Charlotte, you mustn't spoil me:  of course, you must look over the Arno, too. I meant that. The first  vacant room in the front--\" \"You must have it,\" said Miss Bartlett, part  of whose travelling expenses were paid by Lucy's mother--a piece of  generosity to which she made many a tactful allusion.    \"No, no. You must have it.\"    \"I insist on it. Your mother would never forgive me, Lucy.\"    \"She would never forgive me.\"    The ladies' voices grew animated, and--if the sad truth be owned--a  little peevish. They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness  they wrangled. Some of their neighbours interchanged glances, and one  of them--one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad--leant  forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument. He  said:    \"I have a view, I have a view.\"    Miss Bartlett was startled. Generally at a pension people looked them  over for a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that  they would \"do\" till they had gone. She knew that the intruder was  ill-bred, even before she glanced at him. He was an old man, of heavy  build, with a fair, shaven face and large eyes. There was something  childish in those eyes, though it was not the childishness of senility.  What exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to consider, for her  glance passed on to his clothes. These did not attract her. He was  probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the  swim. So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her, and then  said: \"A view? Oh, a view! How delightful a view is!\"    \"This is my son,\" said the old man; \"his name's George. He has a view  too.\"    \"Ah,\" said Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy, who was about to speak.    \"What I mean,\" he continued, \"is that you can have our rooms, and we'll  have yours. We'll change.\"    The better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with  the new-comers. Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened her mouth as little  as possible, and said \"Thank you very much indeed; that is out of the  question.\"    \"Why?\" said the old man, with both fists on the table.    \"Because it is quite out of the question, thank you.\"    \"You see, we don't like to take--\" began Lucy. Her cousin again  repressed her.    \"But why?\" he persisted. \"Women like looking at a view; men don't.\" And  he thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son,  saying, \"George, persuade them!\"    \"It's so obvious they should have the rooms,\" said the son. \"There's  nothing else to say.\"    He did not look at the ladies as he spoke, but his voice was perplexed  and sorrowful. Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she saw that they were in  for what is known as \"quite a scene,\" and she had an odd feeling that  whenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened  till it dealt, not with rooms and views, but with--well, with something  quite different, whose existence she had not realized before. Now the  old man attacked Miss Bartlett almost violently: Why should she not  change? What possible objection had she? They would clear out in half an  hour.    Miss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was  powerless in the presence of brutality. It was impossible to snub any  one so gross. Her face reddened with displeasure. She looked around as  much as to say, \"Are you all like this?\" And two little old ladies, who  were sitting further up the table, with shawls hanging over the backs  of the chairs, looked back, clearly indicating \"We are not; we are  genteel.\"    \"Eat your dinner, dear,\" she said to Lucy, and began to toy again with  the meat that she had once censured.    Lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite.    \"Eat your dinner, dear. This pension is a failure. To-morrow we will  make a change.\"    Hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it. The  curtains at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout  but attractive, who hurried forward to take his place at the table,  cheerfully apologizing for his lateness. Lucy, who had not yet acquired  decency, at once rose to her feet, exclaiming: \"Oh, oh! Why, it's  Mr. Beebe! Oh, how perfectly lovely! Oh, Charlotte, we must stop now,  however bad the rooms are. Oh!\"    Miss Bartlett said, with more restraint:    \"How do you do, Mr. Beebe? I expect that you have forgotten us: Miss  Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you  helped the Vicar of St. Peter's that very cold Easter.\"    The clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember  the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him. But he came forward  pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by  Lucy.    \"I AM so glad to see you,\" said the girl, who was in a state of  spiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if  her cousin had permitted it. \"Just fancy how small the world is. Summer  Street, too, makes it so specially funny.\"    \"Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street,\" said Miss  Bartlett, filling up the gap, \"and she happened to tell me in the course  of conversation that you have just accepted the living--\"    \"Yes, I heard from mother so last week. She didn't know that I knew you  at Tunbridge Wells; but I wrote back at once, and I said: 'Mr. Beebe  is--'\"    \"Quite right,\" said the clergyman. \"I move into the Rectory at Summer  Street next June. I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming  neighbourhood.\"    \"Oh, how glad I am! The name of our house is Windy Corner.\" Mr. Beebe  bowed.    \"There is mother and me generally, and my brother, though it's not often  we get him to ch---- The church is rather far off, I mean.\"    \"Lucy, dearest, let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner.\"    \"I am eating it, thank you, and enjoying it.\"    He preferred to talk to Lucy, whose playing he remembered, rather than  to Miss Bartlett, who probably remembered his sermons. He asked the girl  whether she knew Florence well, and was informed at some length that she  had never been there before. It is delightful to advise a newcomer, and  he was first in the field. \"Don't neglect the country round,\" his advice  concluded. \"The first fine afternoon drive up to Fiesole, and round by  Settignano, or something of that sort.\"    \"No!\" cried a voice from the top of the table. \"Mr. Beebe, you are  wrong. The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato.\"    \"That lady looks so clever,\" whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin. \"We  are in luck.\"    And, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them. People told  them what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams, how to  get rid of the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter, how  much the place would grow upon them. The Pension Bertolini had decided,  almost enthusiastically, that they would do. Whichever way they looked,  kind ladies smiled and shouted at them. And above all rose the voice of  the clever lady, crying: \"Prato! They must go to Prato. That place is  too sweetly squalid for words. I love it; I revel in shaking off the  trammels of respectability, as you know.\"    The young man named George glanced at the clever lady, and then returned  moodily to his plate. Obviously he and his father did not do. Lucy, in  the midst of her success, found time to wish they did. It gave her no  extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold; and when she  rose to go, she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous little  bow.    The father did not see it; the son acknowledged it, not by another bow,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26457"],[0,"New observations on the natural history of bees (#1)"],[1,"was produced from images produced by Core Historical  Literature in Agriculture (CHLA), Cornell University)            {Transcriber's note    The spelling in the original is sometimes idiosyncratic.

They not only elucidate the history of those industrious  animals, whose nature is the peculiar subject of investigation, but they  present some singular features in physiology which have hitherto been  unknown.    The industry of bees has proved a fertile source of admiration in all  countries and in every age; and mankind have endeavoured to render it  subservient to their gratifications or emolument. Hence innumerable  theories, experiments, and observations have ensued, and uncommon  patience has been displayed in prosecuting the enquiry. But although  many interesting peculiarities have been discovered, they are so much  interwoven with errors, that no subject has given birth to more  absurdities than investigations into the history of bees: and  unfortunately those treatises which are most easily attained, and the  most popular, only serve to give such absurdities a wider range, and  render it infinitely more difficult to eradicate them. A considerable  portion of the following work is devoted to this purpose. The reader  will judge of the success which results from the experiments that have  been employed.    Perhaps this is not the proper place to bestow an encomium on a treatise  from which so much entertainment and instruction will be derived.  However, to testify the estimation in which it is held in other nations,  the remarks upon it by the French philosopher Sue, may be quoted, 'The  observations are so consistent, and the consequences seem so just, that  while perusing this work, it appears as if we had assisted the author  in each experiment, and pursued it with equal zeal and interest. Let us  invite the admirers of nature to read these observations; few are equal  to them in excellence, or so faithfully describe the nature, the habits,  and inclinations of the insects of which they treat.'    It is a remarkable circumstance that the author laboured under a defect  in the organs of vision, which obliged him to employ an assistant in his  experiments. Thus these discoveries may be said to acquire double  authority. But independent of this the experiments are so judiciously  adapted to the purposes in view, and the conclusions so strictly  logical, that there is evidently very little room for error. The talents  of _Francis Burnens_, this philosophic assistant, had long been devoted  to the service of the author, who, after being many successive years in  this manner aided in his researches, was at last deprived of him by some  unfortunate accident.    Whether the author has prosecuted his investigation farther does not  appear, as no other production of his pen is known in this island.    It is vain to attempt a translation of any work without being to a  certain degree skilled in the subject of which it treats. Some parts of  the original of the following treatise, it must be acknowledged, are so  confused, and some so minute, that it is extremely difficult to give an  exact interpretation. But the general tenor, though not elegant, is  plain and perspicuous; and such has it been here retained.          LETTER I.    _ON THE IMPREGNATION OF THE QUEEN BEE._        SIR,    When I had the honour at Genthod of giving you an account of my  principal experiments on bees, you desired me to transmit a written  detail, that you might consider them with greater attention. I hasten,  therefore, to extract the following observations from my journal.--As  nothing can be more flattering to me than the interest you take in my  researches, permit me to remind you of your promise to suggest new  experiments{A}.    After having long studied bees in glass hives constructed on M. de  Reaumur's principle, you have found the form unfavourable to an  observer. The hives being too wide, two parallel combs were made by the  bees, consequently whatever passed between them escaped observation.  From this inconvenience, which I have experienced, you recommended much  thinner hives to naturalists, where the panes should be so near each  other, that only a single row of combs could be erected between them. I  have followed your admonitions, Sir, and provided hives only eighteen  lines in width, in which I have found no difficulty to establish swarms.  However, bees must not be entrusted with the charge of constructing a  single comb: Nature has taught them to make parallel ones, which is a  law they never derogate from, unless when constrained by some particular  arrangement. Therefore, if left to themselves in these thin hives, as  they cannot form two combs parallel to the plane of the hive, they will  form several small ones perpendicular to it, and, in that case, all is  equally lost to the observer. Thus it became essential previously to  arrange the position of the combs. I forced the bees to build them  perpendicular to the horizon, and so that the lateral surfaces were  three or four lines from the panes of the hive. This distance allows the  bees sufficient liberty, but prevents them from collecting in too large  clusters on the surface of the comb. By such precautions, bees are  easily established in very thin hives. There they pursue their labours  with the same assiduity and regularity; and, every cell being exposed,  none of their motions can be concealed.    It is true, that by compelling these insects to a habitation where they  could construct only a single row of combs, I had, in a certain  measure, changed their natural situation, and this circumstance might  possibly have affected their instinct. Therefore, to obviate every  objection, I invented a kind of hives, which, without losing the  advantages of those very thin, at the same time approached the figure of  common hives where bees form several rows of combs.    I took several small fir boxes, a foot square and fifteen lines wide,  and joined them together by hinges, so that they could be opened and  shut like the leaves of a book{B}. When using a hive of this  description, we took care to fix a comb in each frame, and then  introduced all the bees necessary for each particular experiment. By  opening the different divisions successively, we daily inspected both  surfaces of every comb. There was not a single cell where we could not  distinctly see what passed at all times, nor a single bee, I may almost  say, with which we were not particularly acquainted. Indeed, this  construction is nothing more than the union of several very flat hives  which may be separated. Bees, in such habitations, must not be visited  before their combs are securely fixed in the frames, otherwise, by  falling out, they may kill or hurt them, as also irritate them to that  degree that the observer cannot escape stinging, which is always  painful, and sometimes dangerous: but they soon become accustomed to  their situation, and in some measure tamed by it; and, in three days, we  may begin to operate on the hive, to open it, remove part of the combs,  and substitute others, without the bees exhibiting too formidable  symptoms of displeasure. You will remember, Sir, that on visiting my  retreat, I shewed you a hive of this kind that had been a long time in  experiment, and how much you were surprised that the bees so quietly  allowed us to open it.    In these hives, I have repeated all my observations,"]]]
