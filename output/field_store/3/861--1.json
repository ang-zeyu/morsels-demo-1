Dead at the age of thirty-one after a sudden operation, Claud Lovat  Fraser was as surely a victim of the war as though he had fallen in  action. He was full of vigour for his work, but shell-shock had left him  with a heart that could not stand a strain of this kind, and all his own  fine courage could not help the surgeons in a losing fight. We are not  sorry for him--we learn that, not to be sorry for the dead. But for  ourselves? This terror is always so fresh, so unexampled. I had  telephoned to him to ask whether he would help me in a certain  theatrical enterprise. I was told by his servant that he was ill, but  one hears these things so often that one gave but little thought to it  beyond sending a telegram asking for news; and now this. Personal griefs  are of no public interest, but here is as sad a public loss as has  befallen us, if the world can measure truly, in our generation.    But it is not, I think, of our loss that we should speak now. These  desolations, strangely, have a way of bringing their own fortitude.  A few hours after hearing, without any warning, of Lovat Fraser's death,  I was walking among the English landscape that he loved so well, and I  felt there how poor and inadequate a thing death really was, how little  to be feared. This apparent intention to destroy a life and genius so  young, so admirable, and so rich in promise, seemed, for all the hurt,  in some way wholly to have failed. We all knew that, given health, the  next ten years would show a splendid volume of work from the new power  and understanding to which he had been coming in these later days. But  just as it seems to me not the occasion to lament our own loss, so does  it seem idle to speculate with regret upon what art may have lost by  this sudden stroke. It is, rather, well to be glad that so few years  have borne so abundantly. Not only is the work that Lovat Fraser has  left full in volume, it is decisive in character beyond all likelihood  in one of his years. Greatly as he would have added to our delight, and  wider as his influence would have grown, nothing he might have done  could have added to our knowledge of the kind of distinction that was  his and that will always mark his fame.    The man himself had a charm of unusual definition. One might go to his  studio at five o'clock and find him lumbering with his great frame among  a chaos of the rare and curious books that he loved, stacked pell-mell  on to the shelves, littered on tables and the floor, his clothes and  face and fingers streaked with paint. And then an hour or two later he  would come dressed ready for the theatre, an immaculate beau of the  'fifties, his top coat with waist and skirts, his opera hat made to  special order by a Bond Street expert on an 1850 last. And then, before  setting off, he would talk of some fellow-artist who was a little down  and out, and wonder whether some of his drawings might not be bought at  a few guineas apiece. Then to book, as it were, such an order gave salt  to his evening, and if the evening meant contact with some of his own  exquisite work, a word of admiration was taken with that wistful  gratitude that it is now almost unbearable to remember.    The theatre is a complex, co-operative affair, and it is idle to inquire  who gives more than another to it. But on one side of its effort nobody  in these later years has fought for light and beauty more surely and  courageously than Claud Lovat Fraser. Like every fine artist, he was  sometimes a little puzzled, a little hurt, that the critics could not  see the clear motives inspiring his work. But the purpose never  faltered. _As You Like It_, _The Beggar's Opera_, _If_, the exquisite  designs for Madame Karsavina's later ballets--these made it plain enough  that a new genius of extraordinary power and fertility was at work on  the stage. With a knowledge of tradition that combined the widest  learning with profound intuition, Lovat Fraser in his design touched the  life of five hundred years with the English spirit of our own time, with  a certainty that every one of his colleagues, I know, will be proud to  allow was beyond them all. The fertility of which I speak was perhaps  his peculiar distinction, and it had no touch of common facility. He  could not draw a line that was not hard with thought and rooted in  imaginative decision. But he could invent with immense rapidity. It was  the old, though rare, story. Alike in his theatre design and his tender  landscape, beauty of spirit flowed in everything he did into beauty of  execution. He was a man in whose presence everything mean or slipshod  withered.    But perhaps it is most fitting at this time that we should think of our  dead friend in yet another way. We are governed by two influences, our  own character, and example. For each man his own character is for his  meditation apart, but of example we may sometimes speak together in the  open with profit. Those of us who live always striving towards creative  effort believe passionately that the thing towards which we aim makes  for all that is most chivalrous and most intelligent in life, that it is  indeed the one true honesty in the world. And yet we know how easily  that effort is beset by fears and jealousies and failure in generosity,  how lightly we who should together give all our energy to the service of  our art, waste it in little concerns of spite and self-interest. And it  is in just such ways as this that great example may serve us nobly, and  there has surely never lived an artist in whom such example more clearly  shone. Art, which for him embraced and crystallised all that was brave  and adventurous and tender, was the worship of Lovat Fraser's life,  a worship which he kept with an absolute loyalty.    It is my privilege to know most of the best artists, in all kinds, of my  age. One has this distinction, another that. But I think that he had the  loveliest of them all. I have known nobody who brought to his art a  devotion so pure and utterly removed from self-interest. If he could  serve the beauty that he loved, he was eager always to do so with  perfect indifference to his own reward. Nobody could be with him for ten  minutes without feeling that art was a thing far greater than any  artist. He had the lovely, humorous humility that is the one sure sign  of greatness. One felt always that if he should think that another might  do given work better than he, there could be for him nothing but  distress if the best was not done, even though it meant the loss of  personal opportunity. But it is one of the happy things of genius that  this exquisite humility can only live with great creative gifts, so that  Lovat Fraser knew from day to day the supreme joy of mastery. The  humility, however, is our example, and the thought that seems most  worthy to-day is that he stands at this moment, for all he was younger  than most of us, as a challenging leader to us all. It will, I think,  always be impossible to remember him without feeling that anything mean  or grudging in the spirit in which we do our work is a betrayal and an  intolerable thing. With all his gaiety, his fun, his simplicities, and  his powers, he showed us not only what a fine artist can do but what a  fine artist can be. And under his leadership at this moment may we not  go back to our work in the world with renewed courage and faith,      \"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.\"    For his fame none of us have any fear. There is in his public  achievement and his portfolios a solid body of work that more and more  must establish itself. However futile prophecy in these things must be,  one is confident that a hundred years hence his name will be highly  honoured among the little band who helped to bring back some life and  truth to the English theatre of this age. He would wish for nothing  better than that. And idle though it is to ask what his death, at little  more than youth, may mean in the way of loss to the art that he lived  for, his friends know that as dear a life as any of our time has gone  suddenly, inexplicably, taking with it the tenderest love of every one  who knew him. And he leaves with us an example without any stain.    JOHN DRINKWATER.    _London_,    _Midsummer 1921_.

Fletcher_    _Entered at Stationers' Hall_          _To_    MY INDIAN FRIENDS    FROM WHOM I HAVE GATHERED    STORY AND SONG          PREFACE.      _At the Congress of Musicians held in connection with the  Trans-Mississippi Exposition at Omaha in July, 1898, several essays  upon the songs of the North American Indians were read, in  illustration of which a number of Omaha Indians, for the first time,  sang their native melodies to an audience largely composed of trained  musicians._    _This unique presentation not only demonstrated the scientific value  of these aboriginal songs in the study of the development of music,  but suggested their availability as themes, novel and characteristic,  for the American composer. It was felt that this availability would be  greater if the story, or the ceremony which gave rise to the song,  could be known, so that, in developing the theme, all the movements  might be consonant with the circumstances that had inspired the  motive. In response to the expressed desire of many musicians, I have  here given a number of songs in their matrix of story._    _Material like that brought together in these pages has hitherto  appeared only in scientific publications, where it has attracted the  lively interest of specialists both in Europe and America. It is now  offered in a more popular form, that the general public may share  with the student the light shed by these untutored melodies upon the  history of music; for these songs take us back to a stage of  development antecedent to that in which culture music appeared among  the ancients, and reveal to us something of the foundations upon which  rests the art of music as we know it to-day._    _Many of the stories and songs in this little book are now for the  first time published. All have been gathered directly from the people,  in their homes, or as I have listened to the earnest voice of the  native priest explaining the ancient ceremonials of his fathers. The  stories are close translations, losing only a certain picturesqueness  and vigour in their foreign guise; but the melodies are exactly as  sung by the Indians._    _Indian myths embodying cosmic ideas have passages told in song,  tribal legends have their milestones of song, folk-tales at dramatic  points break into song; but into these rich fields I have not here  entered. This collection reveals something of the wealth of musical  and dramatic material that can be gleaned outside of myth, legend, and  folk-lore among the natives of our country._    _Aside from its scientific value, this music possesses a charm of  spontaneity that cannot fail to please those who would come near to  nature and enjoy the expression of emotion untrammelled by the  intellectual control of schools. These songs are like the wild flowers  that have not yet come under the transforming hand of the gardener._    ALICE C. FLETCHER.    PEABODY MUSEUM,    HARVARD UNIVERSITY.

We had partaken of our evening meal beside an outdoor fire. The  mother was busy clearing away the supper dishes, the men had gone off  to look after the horses, the children had fallen asleep, and I lay  watching the shadowy darkness come out of the east and slowly pursue  the glowing trail of the retreating sun, thinking of the Indian's  imagery of night ever haunting and following upon the track of day,  seeking to gain the mastery. I was aroused from my musings by hearing  the mother say, \"It is chilly!\" for the fire had died down, and the  deep blue of twilight was all about us.    She dropped beside the embers, blew them into a feeble blaze, threw on  fresh wood, that crackled and sent up a shower of sparks and soon  bright yellow flames illumined the under side of the branches beneath  which I was swinging.    The call of the fire summoned one tall form after another out of the  dusky surroundings, and around the blazing logs robes were spread here  and there, on which the men reclined. By and by the women came and  dropped down near the fire, and added the treble of their voices to  the deep tones of the men, as the chat of the day's occurrences went  on.    It was a peaceful, picturesque scene upon which I looked; and by very  contrast my thoughts reverted to the preceding evening, when I had  attended a meeting of the He-dhu'-shka, society composed of warriors.  The gathering had been in a large tent; and, as the night was warm,  the bottom of the tent cover had been lifted to let the breeze blow  through. This had given an opportunity for the crowd outside to look  within and watch the ceremony and the dramatic dance. To the right of  the door, in two circles around the drum, sat the choir of men and  women, all in their gala dress. Each member of the society, wrapped in  his robe, with measured steps entered the tent, and silently took his  seat on the ground against the wall. The ceremony had opened by the  choir singing the ritual song which accompanied the act of charring  the elder wood with which the face of the Leader was afterward to be  painted. As memory brought back the scene in vivid colours,--the  blazing fire in the centre of the wide circle of muffled warriors, the  solemn aspect of"]]]
