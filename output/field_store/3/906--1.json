The downpour was incessant and likely to last through the night.  The high hedges on either side of the narrow road were so many leafy  cascades; the road itself was in places ankle deep in mud. He stopped  under the protecting cover of a big tree to fill and light his pipe and  with its bowl turned downwards continued his walk. But for the  driving rain which searched every crevice and found every chink in his  waterproof armor, he preferred, indeed welcomed, the walk.    The road from Beston Tracey to Little Beston was associated in his mind  with some of the finest situations in his novels. It was on this road  that he had conceived \"The Tilbury Mystery.\" Between the station and the  house he had woven the plot which had made \"Gregory Standish\" the most  popular detective story of the year. For John Lexman was a maker of  cunning plots.    If, in the literary world, he was regarded by superior persons as a  writer of \"shockers,\" he had a large and increasing public who were  fascinated by the wholesome and thrilling stories he wrote, and who  held on breathlessly to the skein of mystery until they came to the  denouement he had planned.    But no thought of books, or plots, or stories filled his troubled mind  as he strode along the deserted road to Little Beston. He had had two  interviews in London, one of which under ordinary circumstances would  have filled him with joy: He had seen T. X. and \"T. X.\" was T. X.  Meredith, who would one day be Chief of the Criminal Investigation  Department and was now an Assistant Commissioner of Police, engaged in  the more delicate work of that department.    In his erratic, tempestuous way, T. X. had suggested the greatest idea  for a plot that any author could desire. But it was not of T. X. that  John Lexman thought as he breasted the hill, on the slope of which was  the tiny habitation known by the somewhat magnificent title of Beston  Priory.    It was the interview he had had with the Greek on the previous day which  filled his mind, and he frowned as he recalled it. He opened the little  wicket gate and went through the plantation to the house, doing his  best to shake off the recollection of the remarkable and unedifying  discussion he had had with the moneylender.    Beston Priory was little more than a cottage, though one of its walls  was an indubitable relic of that establishment which a pious Howard had  erected in the thirteenth century. A small and unpretentious building,  built in the Elizabethan style with quaint gables and high chimneys,  its latticed windows and sunken gardens, its rosary and its tiny meadow,  gave it a certain manorial completeness which was a source of great  pride to its owner.    He passed under the thatched porch, and stood for a moment in the broad  hallway as he stripped his drenching mackintosh.    The hall was in darkness. Grace would probably be changing for dinner,  and he decided that in his present mood he would not disturb her. He  passed through the long passage which led to the big study at the back  of the house. A fire burnt redly in the old-fashioned grate and the snug  comfort of the room brought a sense of ease and relief. He changed his  shoes, and lit the table lamp.    The room was obviously a man's den. The leather-covered chairs, the big  and well-filled bookcase which covered one wall of the room, the  huge, solid-oak writing-desk, covered with books and half-finished  manuscripts, spoke unmistakably of its owner's occupation.    After he had changed his shoes, he refilled his pipe, walked over to the  fire, and stood looking down into its glowing heart.    He was a man a little above medium height, slimly built, with a breadth  of shoulder which was suggestive of the athlete. He had indeed rowed 4  in his boat, and had fought his way into the semi-finals of the  amateur boxing championship of England. His face was strong, lean, yet  well-moulded. His eyes were grey and deep, his eyebrows straight and a  little forbidding. The clean-shaven mouth was big and generous, and the  healthy tan of his cheek told of a life lived in the open air.    There was nothing of the recluse or the student in his appearance. He  was in fact a typical, healthy-looking Britisher, very much like any  other man of his class whom one would meet in the mess-room of the  British army, in the wardrooms of the fleet, or in the far-off posts of  the Empire, where the administrative cogs of the great machine are to be  seen at work.    There was a little tap at the door, and before he could say \"Come in\" it  was pushed open and Grace Lexman entered.    If you described her as brave and sweet you might secure from that brief  description both her manner and her charm. He half crossed the room to  meet her, and kissed her tenderly.    \"I didn't know you were back until--\" she said; linking her arm in his.    \"Until you saw the horrible mess my mackintosh has made,\" he smiled. \"I  know your methods, Watson!\"    She laughed, but became serious again.    \"I am very glad you've come back. We have a visitor,\" she said.    He raised his eyebrows.    \"A visitor? Whoever came down on a day like this?\"    She looked at him a little strangely.    \"Mr. Kara,\" she said.    \"Kara? How long has he been here?\"    \"He came at four.\"    There was nothing enthusiastic in her tone.    \"I can't understand why you don't like old Kara,\" rallied her husband.    \"There are very many reasons,\" she replied, a little curtly for her.    \"Anyway,\" said John Lexman, after a moment's thought, \"his arrival is  rather opportune. Where is he?\"    \"He is in the drawing-room.\"    The Priory drawing-room was a low-ceilinged, rambling apartment,  \"all old print and chrysanthemums,\" to use Lexman's description. Cosy  armchairs, a grand piano, an almost medieval open grate, faced with  dull-green tiles, a well-worn but cheerful carpet and two big silver  candelabras were the principal features which attracted the newcomer.    There was in this room a harmony, a quiet order and a soothing quality  which made it a haven of rest to a literary man with jagged nerves. Two  big bronze bowls were filled with early violets, another blazed like a  pale sun with primroses, and the early woodland flowers filled the room  with a faint fragrance.    A man rose to his feet, as John Lexman entered and crossed the room with  an easy carriage. He was a man possessed of singular beauty of face and  of figure. Half a head taller than the author, he carried himself with  such a grace as to conceal his height.    \"I missed you in town,\" he said, \"so I thought I'd run down on the off  chance of seeing you.\"    He spoke in the well-modulated tone of one who had had a long  acquaintance with the public schools and universities of England. There  was no trace of any foreign accent, yet Remington Kara was a Greek and  had been born and partly educated in the more turbulent area of Albania.    The two men shook hands warmly.    \"You'll stay to dinner?\"    Kara glanced round with a smile at Grace Lexman. She sat uncomfortably  upright, her hands loosely folded on her lap, her face devoid of  encouragement.    \"If Mrs. Lexman doesn't object,\" said the Greek.    \"I should be pleased, if you would,\" she said, almost mechanically; \"it  is a horrid night and you won't get anything worth eating this side of  London and I doubt very much,\" she smiled a little, \"if the meal I can  give you will be worthy of that description.\"    \"What you can give me will be more than sufficient,\" he said, with a  little bow, and turned to her husband.    In a few minutes they were deep in a discussion of books and places, and  Grace seized the opportunity to make her escape. From books in general  to Lexman's books in particular the conversation flowed.    \"I've read every one of them, you know,\" said Kara.    John made a little face. \"Poor devil,\" he said sardonically.    \"On the contrary,\" said Kara, \"I am not to be pitied. There is a great  criminal lost in you, Lexman.\"    \"Thank you,\" said John.    \"I am not being uncomplimentary, am I?\" smiled the Greek. \"I am merely  referring to the ingenuity of your plots. Sometimes your books baffle  and annoy me. If I cannot see the solution of your mysteries before the  book is half through, it angers me a little. Of course in the majority  of cases I know the solution before I have reached the fifth chapter.\"    John looked at him in surprise and was somewhat piqued.    \"I flatter myself it is impossible to tell how my stories will end until  the last chapter,\" he said.    Kara nodded.    \"That would be so in the case of the average reader, but you forget that  I am a student. I follow every little thread of the clue which you leave  exposed.\"    \"You should meet T. X.,\" said John, with a laugh, as he rose from his  chair to poke the fire.    \"T. X.?\"    \"T. X. Meredith. He is the most ingenious beggar you could meet. We were  at Caius together, and he is by way of being a great pal of mine. He is  in the Criminal Investigation Department.\"    Kara nodded.

ADVERTISEMENT.      _The Author, in this fifth edition, has endeavoured to give an account  of the principal discoveries which have been made within the last four  years in Chemical Science, and of the various important applications,  such as the gas-lights, and the miner's-lamp, to which they have given  rise. But in regard to doctrines or principles, the work has undergone  no material alteration._    _London_, _July_, 1817.          PREFACE.      In venturing to offer to the public, and more particularly to the female  sex, an Introduction to Chemistry, the author, herself a woman,  conceives that some explanation may be required; and she feels it the  more necessary to apologise for the present undertaking, as her  knowledge of the subject is but recent, and as she can have no real  claims to the title of chemist.    On attending for the first time experimental lectures, the author found  it almost impossible to derive any clear or satisfactory information  from the rapid demonstrations which are usually, and perhaps  necessarily, crowded into popular courses of this kind. But frequent  opportunities having afterwards occurred of conversing with a friend on  the subject of chemistry, and of repeating a variety of experiments, she  became better acquainted with the principles of that science, and began  to feel highly interested in its pursuit. It was then that she  perceived, in attending the excellent lectures delivered at the Royal  Institution, by the present Professor of Chemistry, the great advantage  which her previous knowledge of the subject, slight as it was, gave her  over others who had not enjoyed the same means of private instruction.  Every fact or experiment attracted her attention, and served to explain  some theory to which she was not a total stranger; and she had the  gratification to find that the numerous and elegant illustrations, for  which that school is so much distinguished, seldom failed to produce on  her mind the effect for which they were intended.    Hence it was natural to infer, that familiar conversation was, in  studies of this kind, a most useful auxiliary source of information; and  more especially to the female sex, whose education is seldom calculated  to prepare their minds for abstract ideas, or scientific language.    As, however, there are but few women who have access to this mode of  instruction; and as the author was not acquainted with any book that  could prove a substitute for it, she thought that it might be useful for  beginners, as well as satisfactory to herself, to trace the steps by  which she had acquired her little stock of chemical knowledge, and to  record, in the form of dialogue, those ideas which she had first derived  from conversation.    But to do this with sufficient method, and to fix upon a mode of  arrangement, was an object of some difficulty. After much hesitation,  and a degree of embarrassment, which, probably, the most competent  chemical writers have often felt in common with the most superficial,  a mode of division was adopted, which, though the most natural, does not  always admit of being strictly pursued--it is that of treating first of  the simplest bodies, and then gradually rising to the most intricate  compounds.    It is not the author's intention to enter into a minute vindication of  this plan. But whatever may be its advantages or inconveniences, the  method adopted in this work is such, that a young pupil, who should  occasionally recur to it, with a view to procure information on  particular subjects, might often find it obscure or unintelligible; for  its various parts are so connected with each other as to form an  uninterrupted chain of facts and reasonings, which will appear  sufficiently clear and consistent to those only who may have patience to  go through the whole work, or have previously devoted some attention to  the subject.    It will, no doubt, be observed, that in the course of these  Conversations, remarks are often introduced, which appear much too acute  for the young pupils, by whom they are supposed to be made. Of this  fault the author is fully aware. But, in order to avoid it, it would  have been necessary either to omit a variety of useful illustrations, or  to submit to such minute explanations and frequent repetitions, as would  have rendered the work tedious, and therefore less suited to its  intended purpose.    In writing these pages, the author was more than once checked in her  progress by the apprehension that such an attempt might be considered by  some, either as unsuited to the ordinary pursuits of her sex, or  ill-justified by her own recent and imperfect knowledge of the subject.  But, on the one hand, she felt encouraged by the establishment of those  public institutions, open to both sexes, for the dissemination of  philosophical knowledge, which clearly prove that the general opinion no  longer excludes women from an acquaintance with the elements of science;  and, on the other, she flattered herself that whilst the impressions  made upon her mind, by the wonders of Nature, studied in this new point  of view, were still fresh and strong, she might perhaps succeed the  better in communicating to others the sentiments she herself  experienced.    The reader will soon perceive, in perusing this work, that he is often  supposed to have previously acquired some slight knowledge of natural  philosophy, a circumstance, indeed, which appears very desirable. The  author's original intention was to commence this work by a small tract,  explaining, on a plan analogous to this, the most essential rudiments of  that science. This idea she has since abandoned; but the manuscript was  ready, and might, perhaps, have been printed at some future period, had  not an elementary work of a similar description, under the tide of  \"Scientific Dialogues,\" been pointed out to her, which, on a rapid  perusal, she thought very ingenious, and well calculated to answer its  intended object.
