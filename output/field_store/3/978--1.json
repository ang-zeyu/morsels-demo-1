THE THREE SHIPS SAIL    Elizabeth of England died in 1603. There came to the English throne  James Stuart, King of Scotland, King now of England and Scotland. In  1604 a treaty of peace ended the long war with Spain. Gone was the  sixteenth century; here, though in childhood, was the seventeenth  century.    Now that the wars were over, old colonization schemes were revived  in the English mind. Of the motives, which in the first instance had  prompted these schemes, some with the passing of time had become weaker,  some remained quite as strong as before. Most Englishmen and women knew  now that Spain had clay feet; and that Rome, though she might threaten,  could not always perform what she threatened. To abase the pride of  Spain, to make harbors of refuge for the angel of the Reformation--these  wishes, though they had not vanished, though no man could know how long  the peace with Spain would last, were less fervid than they had been in  the days of Drake. But the old desire for trade remained as strong as  ever. It would be a great boon to have English markets in the New World,  as well as in the Old, to which merchants might send their wares, and  from which might be drawn in bulk, the raw stuffs that were needed  at home. The idea of a surplus population persisted; England of five  million souls still thought that she was crowded and that it would  be well to have a land of younger sons, a land of promise for all not  abundantly provided for at home. It were surely well, for mere pride's  sake, to have due lot and part in the great New World! And wealth like  that which Spain had found was a dazzle and a lure. \"Why, man, all their  dripping-pans are pure gold, and all the chains with which they chain up  their streets are massy gold; all the prisoners they take are fettered  in gold; and for rubies and diamonds they go forth on holidays and  gather 'em by the seashore!\" So the comedy of \"Eastward Ho!\" seen on the  London stage in 1605--\"Eastward Ho!\" because yet they thought of America  as on the road around to China.    In this year Captain George Weymouth sailed across the sea and spent  a summer month in North Virginia--later, New England. Weymouth had  powerful backers, and with him sailed old adventurers who had been  with Raleigh. Coming home to England with five Indians in his company,  Weymouth and his voyage gave to public interest the needed fillip  towards action. Here was the peace with Spain, and here was the new  interest in Virginia. \"Go to!\" said Mother England. \"It is time to place  our children in the world!\"    The old adventurers of the day of Sir Humphrey Gilbert had acted as  individuals. Soon was to come in the idea of cooperative action--the  idea of the joint-stock company, acting under the open permission of the  Crown, attended by the interest and favor of numbers of the people, and  giving to private initiative and personal ambition, a public tone.  Some men of foresight would have had Crown and Country themselves the  adventurers, superseding any smaller bodies. But for the moment the  fortunes of Virginia were furthered by a group within the great group,  by a joint-stock company, a corporation.    In 1600 had come into being the East India Company, prototype of many  companies to follow. Now, six years later, there arose under one royal  charter two companies, generally known as the London and the Plymouth.  The first colony planted by the latter was short-lived. Its letters  patent were for North Virginia. Two ships, the Mary and John and the  Gift of God, sailed with over a hundred settlers. These men, reaching  the coast of what is now Maine, built a fort and a church on the banks  of the Kennebec. Then followed the usual miseries typical of colonial  venture--sickness, starvation, and a freezing winter. With the return of  summer the enterprise was abandoned. The foundation of New England was  delayed awhile, her Pilgrims yet in England, though meditating that  first remove to Holland, her Mayflower only a ship of London port,  staunch, but with no fame above another.    The London Company, soon to become the Virginia Company, therefore  engages our attention. The charter recites that Sir Thomas Gates and  Sir George Somers, Knights, Richard Hakluyt, clerk, Prebendary of  Westminster, Edward-Maria Wingfield, and other knights, gentlemen,  merchants, and adventurers, wish \"to make habitation, plantation, and  to deduce a colony of sundry of our people into that part of America  commonly called Virginia.\" It covenants with them and gives them for  a heritage all America between the thirty-fourth and the forty-first  parallels of latitude.    The thirty-fourth parallel passes through the middle of what is now  South Carolina; the forty-first grazes New York, crosses the northern  tip of New Jersey, divides Pennsylvania, and so westward across to that  Pacific or South Sea that the age thought so near to the Atlantic. All  England might have been placed many times over in what was given to  those knights, gentlemen, merchants, and others.    The King's charter created a great Council of Virginia, sitting in  London, governing from overhead. In the new land itself there should  exist a second and lesser council. The two councils had authority within  the range of Virginian matters, but the Crown retained the power of  veto. The Council in Virginia might coin money for trade with the  Indians, expel invaders, import settlers, punish ill-doers, levy and  collect taxes--should have, in short, dignity and power enough for any  colony. Likewise, acting for the whole, it might give and take orders  \"to dig, mine and search for all manner of mines of gold, silver and  copper... to have and enjoy... yielding to us, our heirs and successors,  the fifth part only of all the same gold and silver, and the fifteenth  part of all the same copper.\"    Now are we ready--it being Christmas-tide of the year 1606--to go to  Virginia. Riding on the Thames, before Blackwall, are three ships, small  enough in all conscience' sake, the Susan Constant, the Goodspeed, and  the Discovery. The Admiral of this fleet is Christopher Newport, an old  seaman of Raleigh's. Bartholomew Gosnold captains the Goodspeed, and  John Ratcliffe the Discovery. The three ships have aboard their crews  and one hundred and twenty colonists, all men. The Council in Virginia  is on board, but it does not yet know itself as such, for the names of  its members have been deposited by the superior home council in a sealed  box, to be opened only on Virginia soil.    The colonists have their paper of instructions. They shall find out a  safe port in the entrance of a navigable river. They shall be prepared  against surprise and attack. They shall observe \"whether the river on  which you plant doth spring out of mountains or out of lakes. If it be  out of any lake the passage to the other sea will be the more easy, and  like enough... you shall find some spring which runs the contrary  way toward the East India sea.\" They must avoid giving offense to the  \"naturals\"--must choose a healthful place for their houses--must  guard their shipping. They are to set down in black and white for the  information of the Council at home all such matters as directions and  distances, the nature of soils and forests and the various commodities  that they may find. And no man is to return from Virginia without leave  from the Council, and none is to write home any discouraging letter. The  instructions end, \"Lastly and chiefly, the way to prosper and to achieve  good success is to make yourselves all of one mind for the good of  your country and your own, and to serve and fear God, the Giver of  all Goodness, for every plantation which our Heavenly Father hath not  planted shall be rooted out.\"    Nor did they lack verses to go by, as their enterprise itself did not  lack poetry. Michael Drayton wrote for them:--         Britons, you stay too long,       Quickly aboard bestow you,          And with a merry gale,          Swell your stretched sail,       With vows as strong       As the winds that blow you.         Your course securely steer,       West and by South forth keep;          Rocks, lee shores nor shoals,          Where Eolus scowls,       You need not fear,         So absolute the deep.       And cheerfully at sea          Success you still entice,          To get the pearl and gold,       And ours to hold       VIRGINIA,       Earth's only paradise!...         And in regions far       Such heroes bring ye forth          As those from whom we came;          And plant our name       Under that star       Not known unto our north.    See the parting upon Thames's side, Englishmen going, English kindred,  friends, and neighbors calling farewell, waving hat and scarf, standing  bare-headed in the gray winter weather! To Virginia--they are going to  Virginia! The sails are made upon the Susan Constant, the Goodspeed, and  the Discovery. The last wherry carries aboard the last adventurer. The  anchors are weighed. Down the river the wind bears the ships toward the  sea. Weather turning against them, they taste long delay in the Downs,  but at last are forth upon the Atlantic.

A bare catalogue of  notable American inventions in the nineteenth century alone could not be  compressed into these pages. Nor is it any part of the purpose of  this book to trespass on the ground of the many mechanical works and  encyclopedias which give technical descriptions and explain in detail  the principle of every invention. All this book seeks to do is to  outline the personalities of some of the outstanding American inventors  and indicate the significance of their achievements.

BENJAMIN FRANKLIN AND HIS TIMES    On Milk Street, in Boston, opposite the Old South Church, lived Josiah  Franklin, a maker of soap and candles. He had come to Boston with his  wife about the year 1682 from the parish of Ecton, Northamptonshire,  England, where his family had lived on a small freehold for about three  hundred years. His English wife had died, leaving him seven children,  and he had married a colonial girl, Abiah Folger, whose father, Peter  Folger, was a man of some note in early Massachusetts.    Josiah Franklin was fifty-one and his wife Abiah thirty-nine, when the  first illustrious American inventor was born in their house on Milk  Street, January 17, 1706. He was their eighth child and Josiah's  tenth son and was baptized Benjamin. What little we know of Benjamin's  childhood is contained in his \"Autobiography\", which the world has  accepted as one of its best books and which was the first American book  to be so accepted. In the crowded household, where thirteen children  grew to manhood and womanhood, there were no luxuries. Benjamin's period  of formal schooling was less than two years, though he could never  remember the time when he could not read, and at the age of ten he was  put to work in his father's shop.    Benjamin was restless and unhappy in the shop. He appeared to have no  aptitude at all for the business of soap making. His parents debated  whether they might not educate him for the ministry, and his father took  him into various shops in Boston, where he might see artisans at work,  in the hope that he would be attracted to some trade. But Benjamin saw  nothing there that he wished to engage in. He was inclined to follow the  sea, as one of his older brothers had done.    His fondness for books finally determined his career. His older brother  James was a printer, and in those days a printer was a literary man as  well as a mechanic. The editor of a newspaper was always a printer and  often composed his articles as he set them in type; so \"composing\" came  to mean typesetting, and one who sets type is a compositor. Now James  needed an apprentice. It happened then that young Benjamin, at the age  of thirteen, was bound over by law to serve his brother.    James Franklin printed the \"New England Courant\", the fourth newspaper  to be established in the colonies. Benjamin soon began to write articles  for this newspaper. Then when his brother was put in jail, because he  had printed matter considered libelous, and forbidden to continue as the  publisher, the newspaper appeared in Benjamin's name.    The young apprentice felt that his brother was unduly severe and, after  serving for about two years, made up his mind to run away. Secretly he  took passage on a sloop and in three days reached New York, there to  find that the one printer in the town, William Bradford, could give him  no work. Benjamin then set out for Philadelphia. By boat to Perth Amboy,  on foot to Burlington, and then by boat to Philadelphia was the course  of his journey, which consumed five days. On a Sunday morning in  October, 1723, the tired, hungry boy landed upon the Market Street  wharf, and at once set out to find food and explore America's  metropolis.    Benjamin found employment with Samuel Keimer, an eccentric printer just  beginning business, and lodgings at the house of Read, whose daughter  Deborah was later to become his wife. The intelligent young printer soon  attracted the notice of Sir William Keith, Governor of Pennsylvania, who  promised to set him up in business. First, however, he must go to London  to buy a printing outfit. On the Governor's promise to send a letter  of credit for his needs in London, Franklin set sail; but the Governor  broke his word, and Franklin was obliged to remain in London nearly two  years working at his trade. It was in London that he printed the  first of his many pamphlets, an attack on revealed religion, called \"A  Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain.\" Though he met  some interesting persons, from each of whom he extracted, according to  his custom, every particle of information possible, no future opened for  him in London, and he accepted an offer to return to Philadelphia with  employment as a clerk. But early in 1727 his employer died, and Benjamin  went back to his trade, as printers always do. He found work again in  Keimer's printing office. Here his mechanical ingenuity and general  ability presently began to appear; he invented a method of casting type,  made ink, and became, in fact, the real manager of the business.    The ability to make friends was one of Franklin's traits, and the number  of his acquaintances grew rapidly, both in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  \"I grew convinced,\" he naively says, \"that TRUTH, SINCERITY, and  INTEGRITY in dealings between man and man were of the utmost importance  to the felicity of life.\" Not long after his return from England he  founded in Philadelphia the Junto, a society which at its regular  meetings argued various questions and criticized the writings of the  members. Through this society he enlarged his reputation as well as his  education.    The father of an apprentice at Keimer's furnished the money to buy a  printing outfit for his son and Franklin, but the son soon sold his  share, and Benjamin Franklin, Printer, was fairly established in  business at the age of twenty-four. The writing of an anonymous pamphlet  on \"The Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency\" called attention to  the need of a further issue of paper money in Pennsylvania, and the  author of the tract was rewarded with the contract to print the money,  \"a very profitable job, and a great help to me.\" Small favors were  thankfully received. And, \"I took care not only to be in REALITY  industrious and frugal, but to avoid all appearances to the contrary. I  drest plainly; I was seen at no places of idle diversion.\" And, \"to show  that I was not above my business, I sometimes brought home the paper I  purchased at the stores thru the streets on a wheelbarrow.\"    \"The Universal Instructor in All Arts and Sciences and Pennsylvania  Gazette\": this was the high-sounding name of a newspaper which  Franklin's old employer, Keimer, had started in Philadelphia. But  bankruptcy shortly overtook Keimer, and Franklin took the newspaper with  its ninety subscribers. The \"Universal Instructor\" feature of the paper  consisted of a page or two weekly of \"Chambers's Encyclopedia\". Franklin  eliminated this feature and dropped the first part of the long name.  \"The Pennsylvania Gazette\" in Franklin's hands soon became profitable.  And it lives today in the fullness of abounding life, though under  another name. \"Founded A.D. 1728 by Benj. Franklin\" is the proud legend  of \"The Saturday Evening Post\", which carries on, in our own times, the  Franklin tradition.    The \"Gazette\" printed bits of local news, extracts from the London  \"Spectator\", jokes, verses, humorous attacks on Bradford's \"Mercury\", a  rival paper, moral essays by the editor, elaborate hoaxes, and pungent  political or social criticism. Often the editor wrote and printed  letters to himself, either to emphasize some truth or to give him the  opportunity to ridicule some folly in a reply to \"Alice Addertongue,\"  \"Anthony Afterwit,\" or other mythical but none the less typical person.    If the countryman did not read a newspaper, or buy books, he was, at  any rate, sure to own an almanac. So in 1732 Franklin brought out \"Poor  Richard's Almanac\". Three editions were sold within a few months. Year  after year the sayings of Richard Saunders, the alleged publisher, and  Bridget, his wife, creations of Franklin's fancy, were printed in the  almanac. Years later the most striking of these sayings were collected  and published. This work has been translated into as many as twenty  languages and is still in circulation today.    Franklin kept a shop in connection with his printing office, where he  sold a strange variety of goods: legal blanks, ink, pens, paper, books,  maps, pictures, chocolate, coffee, cheese, codfish, soap, linseed  oil, broadcloth, Godfrey's cordial, tea, spectacles, rattlesnake root,  lottery tickets, and stoves--to mention only a few of the many articles  he advertised.
