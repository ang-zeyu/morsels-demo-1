For ignorance is the first requisite of the historian--ignorance,  which simplifies and clarifies, which selects and omits, with a placid  perfection unattainable by the highest art. Concerning the Age which has  just passed, our fathers and our grandfathers have poured forth and  accumulated so vast a quantity of information that the industry of a  Ranke would be submerged by it, and the perspicacity of a Gibbon would  quail before it. It is not by the direct method of a scrupulous  narration that the explorer of the past can hope to depict that singular  epoch. If he is wise, he will adopt a subtler strategy. He will attack  his subject in unexpected places; he will fall upon the flank, or the  rear; he will shoot a sudden, revealing searchlight into obscure  recesses, hitherto undivined. He will row out over that great ocean of  material, and lower down into it, here and there, a little bucket, which  will bring up to the light of day some characteristic specimen, from  those far depths, to be examined with a careful curiosity. Guided by  these considerations, I have written the ensuing studies. I have  attempted, through the medium of biography, to present some Victorian  visions to the modern eye. They are, in one sense, haphazard  visions--that is to say, my choice of subjects has been determined by no  desire to construct a system or to prove a theory, but by simple motives  of convenience and of art. It has been my purpose to illustrate rather  than to explain. It would have been futile to hope to tell even a precis  of the truth about the Victorian age, for the shortest precis must fill  innumerable volumes. But, in the lives of an ecclesiastic, an  educational authority, a woman of action, and a man of adventure, I have  sought to examine and elucidate certain fragments of the truth which  took my fancy and lay to my hand.    I hope, however, that the following pages may prove to be of interest  from the strictly biographical, no less than from the historical point  of view. Human beings are too important to be treated as mere symptoms  of the past. They have a value which is independent of any temporal  processes--which is eternal, and must be felt for its own sake. The art  of biography seems to have fallen on evil times in England. We have had,  it is true, a few masterpieces, but we have never had, like the French,  a great biographical tradition; we have had no Fontenelles and  Condorcets, with their incomparable eloges, compressing into a few  shining pages the manifold existences of men. With us, the most delicate  and humane of all the branches of the art of writing has been relegated  to the journeymen of letters; we do not reflect that it is perhaps as  difficult to write a good life as to live one. Those two fat volumes,  with which it is our custom to commemorate the dead--who does not know  them, with their ill-digested masses of material, their slipshod style,  their tone of tedious panegyric, their lamentable lack of selection, of  detachment, of design? They are as familiar as the cortege of the  undertaker, and wear the same air of slow, funereal barbarism. One is  tempted to suppose, of some of them, that they were composed by that  functionary as the final item of his job. The studies in this book are  indebted, in more ways than one, to such works--works which certainly  deserve the name of Standard Biographies. For they have provided me not  only with much indispensable information, but with something even more  precious--an example. How many lessons are to be learned from them! But  it is hardly necessary to particularise. To preserve, for instance, a  becoming brevity--a brevity which excludes everything that is redundant  and nothing that is significant--that, surely, is the first duty of the  biographer. The second, no less surely, is to maintain his own freedom  of spirit. It is not his business to be complimentary; it is his  business to lay bare the facts of the case, as he understands them. That  is what I have aimed at in this book--to lay bare the facts of some  cases, as I understand them, dispassionately, impartially, and without  ulterior intentions. To quote the words of a Master--'Je n'impose rien;  je ne propose rien: j'expose.'    L.S.    A list of the principal sources from which I have drawn is appended to  each Biography. I would indicate, as an honourable exception to the  current commodity, Sir Edward Cook's excellent Life of Florence  Nightingale, without which my own study, though composed on a very  different scale and from a decidedly different angle, could not have  been written.        Cardinal Manning      HENRY EDWARD MANNING was born in 1807 and died in 1892. His life was  extraordinary in many ways, but its interest for the modern inquirer  depends mainly upon two considerations--the light which his career  throws upon the spirit of his age, and the psychological problems  suggested by his inner history. He belonged to that class of eminent  ecclesiastics--and it is by no means a small class--who have been  distinguished less for saintliness and learning than for practical  ability. Had he lived in the Middle Ages he would certainly have been  neither a Francis nor an Aquinas, but he might have been an Innocent. As  it was, born in the England of the nineteenth century, growing up in the  very seed-time of modern progress, coming to maturity with the first  onrush of Liberalism, and living long enough to witness the victories of  Science and Democracy, he yet, by a strange concatenation of  circumstances, seemed almost to revive in his own person that long line  of diplomatic and administrative clerics which, one would have thought,  had come to an end for ever with Cardinal Wolsey.    In Manning, so it appeared, the Middle Ages lived again. The tall gaunt  figure, with the face of smiling asceticism, the robes, and the biretta,  as it passed in triumph from High Mass at the Oratory to philanthropic  gatherings at Exeter Hall, from Strike Committees at the Docks to  Mayfair drawing-rooms where fashionable ladies knelt to the Prince of  the Church, certainly bore witness to a singular condition of affairs.  What had happened? Had a dominating character imposed itself upon a  hostile environment? Or was the nineteenth century, after all, not so  hostile? Was there something in it, scientific and progressive as it  was, which went out to welcome the representative of ancient tradition  and uncompromising faith? Had it, perhaps, a place in its heart for such  as Manning--a soft place, one might almost say? Or, on the other hand,  was it he who had been supple and yielding? He who had won by art what  he would never have won by force, and who had managed, so to speak, to  be one of the leaders of the procession less through merit than through  a superior faculty for gliding adroitly to the front rank? And, in any  case, by what odd chances, what shifts and struggles, what combinations  of circumstance and character, had this old man come to be where he was?  Such questions are easier to ask than to answer; but it may be  instructive, and even amusing, to look a little more closely into the  complexities of so curious a story.      I    UNDOUBTEDLY, what is most obviously striking in the history of Manning's  career is the persistent strength of his innate characteristics. Through  all the changes of his fortunes the powerful spirit of the man worked on  undismayed. It was as if the Fates had laid a wager that they would  daunt him; and in the end they lost their bet.    His father was a rich West Indian merchant, a governor of the Bank of  England, a Member of Parliament, who drove into town every day from his  country seat in a coach and four, and was content with nothing short of  a bishop for the christening of his children. Little Henry, like the  rest, had his bishop; but he was obliged to wait for him--for as long as  eighteen months. In those days, and even a generation later, as Keble  bears witness, there was great laxity in regard to the early baptism of  children. The delay has been noted by Manning's biographer as the first  stumbling-block in the spiritual life of the future Cardinal; but he  surmounted it with success.    His father was more careful in other ways.    'His refinement and delicacy of mind were such,' wrote Manning long  afterwards, 'that I never heard out of his mouth a word which might not  have been spoken in the presence of the most pure and sensitive--except,'  he adds, 'on one occasion. He was then forced by others to repeat a  negro story which, though free from all evil de sexu, was indelicate. He  did it with great resistance. His example gave me a hatred of all such  talk.'    The family lived in an atmosphere of Evangelical piety. One day the  little boy came in from the farmyard, and his mother asked him whether  he had seen the peacock. 'I said yes, and the nurse said no, and my  mother made me kneel down and beg God to forgive me for not speaking the  truth.' At the age of four the child was told by a cousin of the age of  six that 'God had a book in which He wrote down everything we did wrong.  This so terrified me for days that I remember being found by my mother  sitting under a kind of writing-table in great fear. I never forgot this  at any time in my life,' the Cardinal tells us, 'and it has been a great  grace to me.' When he was nine years old he 'devoured the Apocalypse;  and I never all through my life forgot the \"lake that burneth with fire  and brimstone\". That verse has kept me like an audible voice through all  my life, and through worlds of danger in my youth.'    At Harrow the worlds of danger were already around him; but yet he  listened to the audible voice. 'At school and college I never failed to  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24473"],[0,"The Cat and the Mouse: A Book of Persian Fairy Tales (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

For hundreds and hundreds of years the  stories in this book, and many others as well, have been told to the  wondering boys and girls of that country, who, as they hear them,  picture their native land as one of roses and tulips, where beautiful  fairies build their castles in the rosy morn, and black gnomes fly  around in the darkness of midnight.    A land, too, where the sun gleams like a fire above the blue mountains,  and the water lilies are mirrored in the deep lakes. A land where the  eyes of the tigers gleam through the reeds by the riverside, and  dark-eyed, sunburned people are quick to love and quick to hate.    The belief in the \"Ghool,\" or \"Old Man of the Desert,\" is still  prevalent in Persia, which probably accounts for the popularity of the  story of \"The Son of the Soap Seller.\" The other stories selected for  this volume are great favorites, but the story of \"The Cat and the  Mouse\" is perhaps the most popular of all.    The frontispiece to this volume is a reduced facsimile of a whole page  in a Persian book, showing both the pictures and the reading as they  were published in Persia. The other illustrations for \"The Cat and the  Mouse\" are copies of drawings by a Persian artist.    \"Two friends on one carpet may with contentment sleep;    Two monarchs in one kingdom the peace can never keep.    While earth revolves, and little children play,    Cats over mice will always hold the sway.\"                                             H. J.

ACCORDING to the decree of Heaven, there once lived in the Persian city  of Kerman a cat like unto a dragon--a longsighted cat who hunted like a  lion; a cat with fascinating eyes and long whiskers and sharp teeth.  Its body was like a drum, its beautiful fur like ermine skin.    Nobody was happier than this cat, neither the newly-wedded bride, nor  the hospitable master of the house when he looks round on the smiling  faces of his guests.    This cat moved in the midst of friends, boon companions of the  saucepan, the cup, and the milk jug of the court, and of the dinner  table when the cloth is spread.    Perceiving the wine cellar open, one day, the cat ran gleefully into it  to see if he could catch a mouse, and hid himself behind a wine jar. At  that moment a mouse ran out of a hole in the wall, quickly climbed the  jar, and putting his head into it, drank so long and so deeply that he  became drunk, talked very stupidly, and fancied he was as bold as a  lion.    \"Where is the cat?\" shouted he, \"that I may off with his head. I would  cut off his head as if on the battlefield. A cat in front of me would  fare worse than any dog who might happen to cross my path.\"    The cat ground his teeth with rage while hearing this. Quicker than the  eye could follow, he made a spring, seized the mouse in his claws, and  said, \"Oh, little mouse, now will you take off my head?\"    \"I am thy servant,\" replied the mouse; \"forgive my sin. I was drunk. I  am thy slave; a slave whose ear is pierced and on whose shoulder the  yoke is.\"    \"Tell fewer lies,\" replied the cat. \"Was there ever such a liar? I  heard all you said and you shall pay for your sin with your life. I  will make your life less than that of a dead dog.\"    So the cat killed and ate the mouse; but afterwards, being sorry for  what he had done, he ran to the Mosque, and passed his hands over his  face, poured water on his hands, and anointed himself as he had seen  the faithful do at the appointed hours of prayer.    Then he began to recite the beautiful chapter to Allah in the Holy Book  of the Persians, and to make his confession in this wise:    \"I have repented, and will not again tear the body of a mouse with my  teeth. I will give bread to the deserving poor. Forgive my sin, O great  Forgiver, for have I not come to Thee bowed down with sorrow?\"    He repeated this so many times and with so much feeling that he really  thought he meant it, and finally wept for grief.    A little mouse happened to be behind the pulpit, and overhearing the  cat's vows, speedily carried the glad but surprising news to the other  mice. Breathlessly he related how that the cat had become a true  Mussulman; how that he had seen him in the Mosque weeping and  lamenting, and saying:    \"Oh, Creator of the world, put away my sin, for I have offended like a  big fool.\" Then the mouse went on to describe how that the cat had a  rosary of beads, and made pious reflections in the spirit of a true  penitent.    The mice began to make merry when they heard this startling news, for  they were exceedingly glad. Seven chosen mice, each the headman of the  village, arose and gave thanks that the cat should at last have entered  the fold of the true believers.    All danced and shouted, \"Ah! Ah! Hu! Hu!\" and drank red wine and white  wine until they were very merry. Two rang bells, two played castanets,  and two sang. One carried a tray behind his back laden with good  things, so that all could help themselves; some smoked water-pipes;  another acted like a clown; others played various tunes on different  instruments of music.    A few days after the feast, the King of the mice said to them, \"Oh,  friends, all of you bring costly presents worthy of the cat!\" Then the  mice scattered in search of gifts, but soon returned, each bearing  something worthy of presentation, even to a nobleman.    One brought a bottle of wine; another a dish full of raisins; others  came with salted nuts and melon seeds, lumps of cheese, basins of  sugar-candy, pistachio nuts, little cakes iced with sugar, bottles of  lemon juice, Indian shawls, hats, cloaks and many other things.    Discreetly they bore their gifts before the King of the Cats. When in  the royal presence, they made humble obeisances, touching their  foreheads on the ground, and saluting him, said:    \"Oh, master, liberator of the lives of all, we have brought gifts  worthy of thy service. We beseech thee to deign to accept of them.\"    Then the cat thought to himself, \"I am rewarded for becoming a pious  Mussulman. Though I have endured much hunger, yet this day finds me  freely and amply provided for. Not for many days have I broken my fast.  It is clear that Allah is appeased.\"    Then he turned to the mice, and bade them come nearer, calling them his  friends. And they went forward trembling. So frightened were they that  they were hardly aware of what they were doing. When they were close  the cat made a sudden spring upon them.    Five mice he caught, each one the chief of a village; two with his  front paws, two with his hind ones, and one in his mouth. The remaining  mice barely escaped with their lives.    Picking up one of their murdered brothers, they quickly carried the sad  news to the mice, saying: \"Why do ye sit still, oh mice? Throw dust on  your heads, oh young men, for the cruel cat has seized five of our  unsuspecting companions with teeth and claws and has killed them.\"    Then for the space of five days they rent their clothes as do "]]]
