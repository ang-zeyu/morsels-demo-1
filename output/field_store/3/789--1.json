Finding there was a call for such a book I have written the present  volume in order to meet this want, and I trust that this handbook will  prove useful, not only to the expert and to those requiring certain  technical information, but also to the general public, whose interest in  this entrancing subject may be simply that of pleasure in the purchase,  possession, or collection of precious stones, or even in the mere  examination of them through the plate-glass of a jeweller's window.    JOHN MASTIN.    TOTLEY BROOK,  NEAR SHEFFIELD.    _June 1911._          THE CHEMISTRY, PROPERTIES AND TESTS OF PRECIOUS STONES          CHAPTER I.    INTRODUCTORY.      What constitutes a precious stone is the question which, at the onset,  rises in the mind, and this question, simple as it seems, is one by no  means easy to answer, since what may be considered precious at one time,  may cease to be so at another.    There are, however, certain minerals which possess distinctive features  in their qualities of hardness, colour, transparency, refractability or  double refractability to light-beams, which qualities place them in an  entirely different class to the minerals of a metallic nature. These  particular and non-metallic minerals, therefore, because of their  comparative rarity, rise pre-eminently above other minerals, and become  actually \"precious.\"    This is, at the same time, but a comparative term, for it will readily  be understood that in the case of a sudden flooding of the market with  one class of stone, even if it should be one hitherto rare and  precious, there would be an equally sudden drop in the intrinsic value  of the jewel to such an extent as perhaps to wipe it out of the category  of precious stones. For instance, rubies were discovered long before  diamonds; then when diamonds were found these were considered much more  valuable till their abundance made them common, and they became of  little account. Rubies again asserted their position as chief of all  precious stones in value, and in many biblical references rubies are  quoted as being the symbol of the very acme of wealth, such as in  Proverbs, chapter iii., verses 13 and 15, where there are the passages,  \"happy is the man that findeth wisdom ... she is more precious than  rubies\"--and this, notwithstanding the enormous quantity of them at that  time obtained from the ruby mines of Ophir and Nubia, which were then  the chief sources of wealth.    It will also be remembered that Josephus relates how, at the fall of  Jerusalem, the spoil of gold was so great that Syria was inundated with  it, and the value of gold there quickly dropped to one-half; other  historians, also, speaking of this time, record such a glut of gold,  silver, and jewels in Syria, as made them of little value, which state  continued for some considerable period, till the untold wealth became  ruthlessly and wastefully scattered, when the normal values slowly  reasserted themselves.    Amongst so many varieties of these precious minerals, it cannot be  otherwise than that there should be important differences in their  various characteristics, though for a stone to have the slightest claim  to be classed as \"precious\" it must conform to several at least of the  following requirements:--It must withstand the action of light without  deterioration of its beauty, lustre, or substance, and it must be of  sufficient hardness to retain its form, purity and lustre under the  actions of warmth, reasonable wear, and the dust which falls upon it  during use; it must not be subject to chemical change, decomposition,  disintegration, or other alteration of its substance under exposure to  atmospheric air; otherwise it is useless for all practical purposes of  adornment or ornamentation.    There are certain other characteristics of these curious minerals which  may be classified briefly, thus:--Some stones owe their beauty to a  wonderful play of colour or fire, due to the action of light, quite  apart from the colour of the stone itself, and of this series the opal  may be taken as a type. In others, this splendid play of colour is  altogether absent, the colour being associated with the stone itself, in  its substance, the charm lying entirely in the superb transparency, the  ruby being taken as an example of this class of stone. Others, again,  have not only colour, but transparency and lustre, as in the coloured  diamonds, whilst the commoner well-known diamonds are extremely rich in  transparency and lustre, the play of light alone showing a considerable  amount of brilliancy and beauty of colour, though the stone itself is  clear. Still others are opaque, or semi-opaque, or practically free from  play of light and from lustre, owing their value and beauty entirely to  their richness of colour.    In all cases the value of the stone cannot be appreciated fully till the  gem is separated from its matrix and polished, and in some cases, such  as in that of the diamond, cut in variously shaped facets, on and  amongst which the light rays have power to play; other stones, such as  the opal, turquoise and the like, are cut or ground in flat,  dome-shaped, or other form, and then merely polished. It frequently  happens that only a small portion of even a large stone is of supreme  value or purity, the cutter often retaining as his perquisite the  smaller pieces and waste. These, if too small for setting, are ground  into powder and used to cut and polish other stones.    Broadly speaking, the greatest claim which a stone can possess in order  to be classed as precious is its rarity. To this may be added public  opinion, which is led for better or worse by the fashion of the moment.  For if the comparatively common amethyst should chance to be made  extraordinarily conspicuous by some society leader, it would at once  step from its humbler position as semi-precious, and rise to the nobler  classification of a truly precious stone, by reason of the demand  created for it, which would, in all probability, absorb the available  stock to rarity; and this despite the more entrancing beauty of the now  rarer stones.    The study of this section of mineralogy is one of intense interest, and  by understanding the nature, environment, chemical composition and the  properties of the stones, possibility of fraud is altogether precluded,  and there is induced in the mind--even of those with whom the study of  precious stones has no part commercially--an intelligent interest in the  sight or association of what might otherwise excite no more than a mere  glance of admiration or curiosity. There is scarcely any form of matter,  be it liquid, solid, or gaseous, but has yielded or is now yielding up  its secrets with more or less freedom to the scientist.

Burt Company          MARJORIE DEAN, HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN    CHAPTER I    THE PARTING OF THE WAYS      \"What am I going to do without you, Marjorie?\" Mary Raymond's blue eyes  looked suspiciously misty as she solemnly regarded her chum.    \"What am I going to do without _you_, you mean,\" corrected Marjorie  Dean, with a wistful smile. \"Please, please don't let's talk of it. I  simply can't bear it.\"    \"One, two--only two more weeks now,\" sighed Mary. \"You'll surely write  to me, Marjorie?\"    \"Of course, silly girl,\" returned Marjorie, patting her friend's arm  affectionately. \"I'll write at least once a week.\"    Marjorie Dean's merry face looked unusually sober as she walked down the  corridor beside Mary and into the locker room of the Franklin High  School. The two friends put on their wraps almost in silence. The  majority of the girl students of the big city high school had passed out  some little time before. Marjorie had lingered for a last talk with Miss  Fielding, who taught English and was the idol of the school, while Mary  had hung about outside the classroom to wait for her chum. It seemed to  Mary that the greatest sorrow of her sixteen years had come. Marjorie,  her sworn ally and confidante, was going away for good and all.    When, six years before, a brown-eyed little girl of nine, with long  golden-brown curls, had moved into the house next door to the Raymonds,  Mary had lost no time in making her acquaintance. They had begun with  shy little nods and smiles, which soon developed into doorstep  confidences. Within two weeks Mary, whose eyes were very blue, and whose  short yellow curls reminded one of the golden petals of a daffodil, had  become Marjorie's adorer and slave. She it was who had escorted Marjorie  to the Lincoln Grammar School and seen her triumphantly through her  first week there. She had thrilled with unselfish pride to see how  quickly the other little girls of the school had succumbed to Marjorie's  charm. She had felt a most delightful sense of pardonable vanity when,  as the year progressed, Marjorie had preferred her above all the others.  She had clung to Mary, even though Alice Lawton, who rode to school  every day in a shining limousine, had tried her utmost to be best  friends with the brown-eyed little girl whose pretty face and lovable  personality had soon made her the pet of the school.    Year after year Mary and Marjorie had lived side by side and kept their  childish faith. But now, here they were, just beginning their freshman  year in Franklin High School, to which they had so long looked forward,  and about to be separated; for Marjorie's father had been made manager  of the northern branch of his employer's business and Marjorie was going  to live in the little city of Sanford. Instead of being a freshman in  dear old Franklin, she was to enter the freshman class in Sanford High  School, where she didn't know a solitary girl, and where she was sure  she would be too unhappy for words.    During the first days which had followed the dismaying news that  Marjorie Dean was going to leave Franklin High School and go hundreds of  miles away, the two friends had talked of little else. There was so much  to be said, yet now that their parting was but two weeks off they felt  the weight of the coming separation bearing heavily upon them. Both  young faces wore expressions of deepest gloom as they walked slowly down  the steps of the school building and traversed the short space of stone  walk that led to the street.    It was Marjorie who broke the silence.    \"No other girl can ever be as dear to me as you are. You know that,  don't you, Mary?\"    Mary nodded mutely. Her blue eyes had filled with a sudden rush of hot  tears.    \"But it won't do any good,\" continued Marjorie, slowly, \"for us to mourn  over being separated. We know how we feel about each other, and that's  going to be a whole lot of comfort to us after--I'm gone.\" Her girlish  treble faltered slightly. Then she threw her arm across Mary's shoulder  and said with forced steadiness of tone: \"I'm not going to be a silly  and cry. This is one of those 'vicissitudes' of life that Professor  Taylor was talking about in chapel yesterday. We must be very brave.  We'll write lots of letters and visit each other during vacation, and  perhaps, some day I'll come back here to live.\"    \"Of course you will. You must come back,\" nodded Mary, her face  brightening at the prospect of a future reunion, even though remote.    \"Can't you come with me to dinner?\" coaxed Marjorie, as they paused at  the corner where they were accustomed to wait for their respective  street cars. \"You know, you are one of mother's exceptions. I never have  to give notice before bringing you home.\"    \"Not to-night. I'm going out this evening,\" returned Mary, vaguely. \"I  must hurry home.\"    \"Where are you going?\" asked Marjorie, curiously. \"You never said a  word about it this morning.\"    \"Oh, didn't I? Well, I'm going out with----Here comes your car,  Marjorie. You'd better hurry home, too.\"    \"Why?\" Marjorie's brown eyes looked their reproach. \"Do you want to get  rid of me, Mary? I've oceans of time before dinner. You know we never  have it until half-past six. Never mind, I'll take this car. Good-bye.\"    With a proud little nod of her head, Marjorie climbed the steps of the  car which had now stopped at their corner, without giving her friend an  opportunity for reply. Mary looked after the moving car with a rueful  smile that changed to one of glee. Her eyes danced. \"She hasn't the  least idea of what's going to happen,\" thought the little fluffy-haired  girl. \"Won't she be surprised? Now that she's gone, Clark and Ethel and  Seldon ought to be here.\"    A shrill whistle farther up the street caused her to glance quickly in  the direction of the sound. Two young men were hurrying toward her,  their boyish faces alight with enthusiasm and good nature.    \"It's all O.K., Mary,\" called the taller of the two, his black eyes  glowing. \"Every last thing has been thought of. Ethel has the pin.  She'll be along in a minute.\"    \"It's a peach!\" shouted the smaller lad, waving his cap, then jamming  it down on his thick, fair hair. \"We've been waiting up the street for  Marjorie to take her car. Thought she'd never start.\"    \"I am afraid I hurt her feelings,\" deplored Mary. \"I forgot myself and  told her she'd better hurry home. She looked at me in the most  reproachful way.\"    \"Cheer up,\" laughed Clark Grayson, the black-eyed youth. \"To-night'll  fix things. All the fellows are coming.\"    \"So are all the girls,\" returned Mary, happily. \"I do wish Ethel would  hurry. I'm so anxious to see the pin. I know Marjorie will love it. Oh,  here comes Ethel now.\"    Ethel Duval, a tall, slender girl of sixteen, with earnest, gray-blue  eyes and wavy, flaxen hair, joined the trio with: \"I'm so glad we  waited. I wanted you to see the pin, Mary.\" She was fumbling busily in  her shopping bag as she spoke. \"Here it is.\" She held up a small, square  package, which, when divested of its white paper wrapping, disclosed a  blue plush box. A second later Mary was exclaiming over the dainty  beauty of the bit of jewelry lying securely on its white satin bed. The  pin was fashioned in the form of a golden butterfly, the body of which  was set with tiny pearls.    \"Oh-h-h!\" breathed Mary. \"Isn't it wonderful! But do you suppose her  mother will allow her to accept such an expensive gift? It must have  cost a lot of money.\"    \"Fifteen dollars,\" announced Clark, cheerfully, \"but it was a case of  only fifty cents apiece, and besides, it's for Marjorie. Fifteen times  fifteen dollars wouldn't be too much for her. Every fellow and girl that  was invited accepted the invitation and handed over the tax. To make  things sure, Ethel went round to see Marjorie's mother about it and won  her over to our side. So that's settled.\"    \"It's perfectly lovely,\" sighed Mary in rapture, \"and you boys have  worked so hard to make the whole affair a gorgeous success. I'm afraid  we had better be moving on, though. It won't be long now until half-past  seven. I do hope everyone will be on time.\"    \"They've all been warned,\" declared Seldon Ames. \"Good-bye, then, until  to-night.\" The two boys raised their caps and swung down the street,  while Mary and Ethel stopped for one more look at the precious pin that  in later days was to mean far more to their schoolmate, Marjorie Dean,  than they had ever dreamed.          CHAPTER II    GOOD-BYE, MARJORIE DEAN      \"Whatever you do, don't laugh, or speak above a whisper, or fall up the  steps, or do anything else that will give us away before we're ready,\"  lectured Clark Grayson to the little crowd of happy-faced boys and girls  who were gathered round him on the corner above Marjorie Dean's home.  \"We'd better advance by fives. Seldon, you go with the first lot. When I  give the"]]]
