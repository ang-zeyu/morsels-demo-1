Having passed this monument,  and having lingered a moment on the terrace of the church of St. Peter  Montorio, which commands the whole of Rome, you will visit the cloister  of Bramante, in the middle of which, sunk a few feet below the level, is  built, on the identical place where St. Peter was crucified, a little  temple, half Greek, half Christian; you will thence ascend by a side  door into the church itself. There, the attentive cicerone will show  you, in the first chapel to the right, the Christ Scourged, by Sebastian  del Piombo, and in the third chapel to the left, an Entombment by  Fiammingo; having examined these two masterpieces at leisure, he will  take you to each end of the transverse cross, and will show you--on one  side a picture by Salviati, on slate, and on the other a work by Vasari;  then, pointing out in melancholy tones a copy of Guido's Martyrdom of  St. Peter on the high altar, he will relate to you how for three  centuries the divine Raffaelle's Transfiguration was worshipped in that  spot; how it was carried away by the French in 1809, and restored to the  pope by the Allies in 1814. As you have already in all probability  admired this masterpiece in the Vatican, allow him to expatiate, and  search at the foot of the altar for a mortuary slab, which you will  identify by a cross and the single word; Orate; under this gravestone is  buried Beatrice Cenci, whose tragical story cannot but impress you  profoundly.    She was the daughter of Francesco Cenci. Whether or not it be true that  men are born in harmony with their epoch, and that some embody its good  qualities and others its bad ones, it may nevertheless interest our  readers to cast a rapid glance over the period which had just passed  when the events which we are about to relate took place. Francesco Cenci  will then appear to them as the diabolical incarnation of his time.    On the 11th of August, 1492, after the lingering death-agony of Innocent  VIII, during which two hundred and twenty murders were committed in the  streets of Rome, Alexander VI ascended the pontifical throne. Son of a  sister of Pope Calixtus III, Roderigo Lenzuoli Borgia, before being  created cardinal, had five children by Rosa Vanozza, whom he afterwards  caused to be married to a rich Roman. These children were:    Francis, Duke of Gandia;    Caesar, bishop and cardinal, afterwards Duke of Valentinois;    Lucrezia, who was married four times: her first husband was Giovanni  Sforza, lord of Pesaro, whom she left owing to his impotence; the  second, Alfonso, Duke of Bisiglia, whom her brother Caesar caused to be  assassinated; the third, Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, from whom a  second divorce separated her; finally, the fourth, Alfonso of Aragon,  who was stabbed to death on the steps of the basilica of St. Peter, and  afterwards, three weeks later, strangled, because he did not die soon  enough from his wounds, which nevertheless were mortal;    Giofre, Count of Squillace, of whom little is known;    And, finally, a youngest son, of whom nothing at all is known.    The most famous of these three brothers was Caesar Borgia. He had made  every arrangement a plotter could make to be King of Italy at the death  of his father the pope, and his measures were so carefully taken as to  leave no doubt in his own mind as to the success of this vast project.  Every chance was provided against, except one; but Satan himself could  hardly have foreseen this particular one. The reader will judge for  himself.    The pope had invited Cardinal Adrien to supper in his vineyard on the  Belvidere; Cardinal Adrien was very rich, and the pope wished to inherit  his wealth, as he already had acquired that of the Cardinals of Sant'  Angelo, Capua, and Modena. To effect this, Caesar Borgia sent two  bottles of poisoned wine to his father's cup-bearer, without taking him  into his confidence; he only instructed him not to serve this wine till  he himself gave orders to do so; unfortunately, during supper the  cup-bearer left his post for a moment, and in this interval a careless  butler served the poisoned wine to the pope, to Caesar Borgia, and to  Cardinal Corneto.    Alexander VI died some hours afterwards; Caesar Borgia was confined to  bed, and sloughed off his skin; while Cardinal Corneto lost his sight  and his senses, and was brought to death's door.    Pius III succeeded Alexander VI, and reigned twenty-five days; on the  twenty-sixth he was poisoned also.    Caesar Borgia had under his control eighteen Spanish cardinals who owed  to him their places in the Sacred College; these cardinals were entirely  his creatures, and he could command them absolutely. As he was in a  moribund condition and could make no use of them for himself, he sold  them to Giuliano della Rovere, and Giuliano della Rovere was elected  pope, under the name of Julius II. To the Rome of Nero succeeded the  Athens of Pericles.    Leo X succeeded Julius II, and under his pontificate Christianity  assumed a pagan character, which, passing from art into manners, gives  to this epoch a strange complexion. Crimes for the moment disappeared,  to give place to vices; but to charming vices, vices in good taste, such  as those indulged in by Alcibiades and sung by Catullus. Leo X died  after having assembled under his reign, which lasted eight years, eight  months, and nineteen days, Michael Angelo, Raffaelle, Leonardo da Vinci,  Correggio, Titian, Andrea del Sarto, Fra Bartolommeo, Giulio Romano,  Ariosto, Guicciardini, and Macchiavelli.    Giulio di Medici and Pompeo Colonna had equal claims to succeed him. As  both were skilful politicians, experienced courtiers, and moreover of  real and almost equal merit, neither of them could obtain a majority,  and the Conclave was prolonged almost indefinitely, to the great fatigue  of the cardinals. So it happened one day that a cardinal, more tired  than the rest, proposed to elect, instead of either Medici or Colonna,  the son, some say of a weaver, others of a brewer of Utrecht, of whom no  one had ever thought till then, and who was for the moment acting head  of affairs in Spain, in the absence of Charles the Fifth. The jest  prospered in the ears of those who heard it; all the cardinals approved  their colleague's proposal, and Adrien became pope by a mere accident.    He was a perfect specimen of the Flemish type a regular Dutchman, and  could not speak a word of Italian. When he arrived in Rome, and saw the  Greek masterpieces of sculpture collected at vast cost by Leo X, he  wished to break them to pieces, exclaiming, \"Suet idola anticorum.\" His  first act was to despatch a papal nuncio, Francesco Cherigato, to the  Diet of Nuremberg, convened to discuss the reforms of Luther, with  instructions which give a vivid notion of the manners of the time.    \"Candidly confess,\" said he, \"that God has permitted this schism and  this persecution on account of the sins of man, and especially those of  priests and prelates of the Church; for we know that many abominable  things have taken place in the Holy See.\"    Adrien wished to bring the Romans back to the simple and austere manners  of the early Church, and with this object pushed reform to the minutest  details. For instance, of the hundred grooms maintained by Leo X, he  retained only a dozen, in order, he said, to have two more than the  cardinals.    A pope like this could not reign long: he died after a year's  pontificate. The morning after his death his physician's door was found  decorated with garlands of flowers, bearing this inscription: \"To the  liberator of his country.\"    Giulio di Medici and Pompeo Colonna were again rival candidates.  Intrigues recommenced, and the Conclave was once more so divided that at  one time the cardinals thought they could only escape the difficulty in  which they were placed by doing what they had done before, and electing  a third competitor; they were even talking about Cardinal Orsini, when  Giulio di Medici, one of the rival candidates, hit upon a very ingenious  expedient. He wanted only five votes; five of his partisans each offered  to bet five of Colonna's a hundred thousand ducats to ten thousand  against the election of Giulio di Medici. At the very first ballot after  the wager, Giulio di Medici got the five votes he wanted; no objection  could be made, the cardinals had not been bribed; they had made a bet,  that was all.    Thus it happened, on the 18th of November, 1523, Giulio di Medici was  proclaimed pope under the name of Clement VII. The same day, he  generously paid the five hundred thousand ducats which his five  partisans had lost.    It was under this pontificate, and during the seven months in which  Rome, conquered by the Lutheran soldiers of the Constable of Bourbon,  saw holy things subjected to the most frightful profanations, that  Francesco Cenci was born.    He was the son of Monsignor Nicolo Cenci, afterwards apostolic treasurer  during the pontificate of Pius V. Under this venerable prelate, who  occupied himself much more with the spiritual than the temporal  administration of his kingdom, Nicolo Cenci took advantage of his  spiritual head's abstraction of worldly matters to amass a net revenue  of a hundred and sixty thousand piastres, about f32,000 of our money.

In the great political and religious convulsions of the South, the  earthquake-like throes of which were felt even in the capital, Nimes has  always taken the central place; Nimes will therefore be the pivot round  which our story will revolve, and though we may sometimes leave it for a  moment, we shall always return thither without fail.    Nimes was reunited to France by Louis VIII, the government being taken  from its vicomte, Bernard Athon VI, and given to consuls in the year  1207. During the episcopate of Michel Briconnet the relics of St.  Bauzile were discovered, and hardly were the rejoicings over this event  at an end when the new doctrines began to spread over France. It was in  the South that the persecutions began, and in 1551 several persons were  publicly burnt as heretics by order of the Seneschal's Court at Nimes,  amongst whom was Maurice Secenat, a missionary from the Cevennes, who  was taken in the very act of preaching. Thenceforth Nimes rejoiced in  two martyrs and two patron saints, one revered by the Catholics, and one  by the Protestants; St. Bauzile, after reigning as sole protector for  twenty-four years, being forced to share the honours of his guardianship  with his new rival.    Maurice Secenat was followed as preacher by Pierre de Lavau; these two  names being still remembered among the crowd of obscure and forgotten  martyrs. He also was put to death on the Place de la Salamandre, all the  difference being that the former was burnt and the latter hanged.    Pierre de Lavau was attended in his last moments by Dominique Deyron,  Doctor of Theology; but instead of, as is usual, the dying man being  converted by the priest, it was the priest who was converted by de  Lavau, and the teaching which it was desired should be suppressed burst  forth again. Decrees were issued against Dominique Deyron; he was  pursued and tracked down, and only escaped the gibbet by fleeing to the  mountains.    The mountains are the refuge of all rising or decaying sects; God has  given to the powerful on earth city, plain, and sea, but the mountains  are the heritage of the oppressed.    Persecution and proselytism kept pace with each other, but the blood  that was shed produced the usual effect: it rendered the soil on which  it fell fruitful, and after two or three years of struggle, during which  two or three hundred Huguenots had been burnt or hanged, Nimes awoke one  morning with a Protestant majority. In 1556 the consuls received a sharp  reprimand on account of the leaning of the city towards the doctrines of  the Reformation; but in 1557, one short year after this admonition,  Henri II was forced to confer the office of president of the Presidial  Court on William de Calviere, a Protestant. At last a decision of the  senior judge having declared that it was the duty of the consuls to  sanction the execution of heretics by their presence, the magistrates of  the city protested against this decision, and the power of the Crown was  insufficient to carry it out.    Henri II dying, Catherine de Medicis and the Guises took possession of  the throne in the name of Francois II. There is a moment when nations  can always draw a long breath, it is while their kings are awaiting  burial; and Nimes took advantage of this moment on the death of Henri  II, and on September 29th, 1559, Guillaume Moget founded the first  Protestant community.    Guillaume Moget came from Geneva. He was the spiritual son of Calvin,  and came to Nimes with the firm purpose of converting all the remaining  Catholics or of being hanged. As he was eloquent, spirited, and wily,  too wise to be violent, ever ready to give and take in the matter of  concessions, luck was on his side, and Guillaume Moget escaped hanging.    The moment a rising sect ceases to be downtrodden it becomes a queen,  and heresy, already mistress of three-fourths of the city, began to hold  up its head with boldness in the streets. A householder called Guillaume  Raymond opened his house to the Calvinist missionary, and allowed him to  preach in it regularly to all who came, and the wavering were thus  confirmed in the new faith. Soon the house became too narrow to contain  the crowds which flocked thither to imbibe the poison of the  revolutionary doctrine, and impatient glances fell on the churches.    Meanwhile the Vicomte de Joyeuse, who had just been appointed governor  of Languedoc in the place of M. de Villars, grew uneasy at the rapid  progress made by the Protestants, who so far from trying to conceal it  boasted of it; so he summoned the consuls before him, admonished them  sharply in the king's name, and threatened to quarter a garrison in the  town which would soon put an end to these disorders. The consuls  promised to stop the evil without the aid of outside help, and to carry  out their promise doubled the patrol and appointed a captain of the town  whose sole duty was to keep order in the streets. Now this captain whose  office had been created solely for the repression of heresy, happened to  be Captain Bouillargues, the most inveterate Huguenot who ever existed.    The result of this discriminating choice was that Guillaume Moget began  to preach, and once when a great crowd had gathered in a garden to hear  him hold forth, heavy rain came on, and it became necessary for the  people either to disperse or to seek shelter under a roof. As the  preacher had just reached the most interesting part of his sermon, the  congregation did not hesitate an instant to take the latter alternative.  The Church of St. Etienne du Capitole was quite near: someone present  suggested that this building, if not the most suitable, as at least the  most spacious for such a gathering.    The idea was received with acclamation: the rain grew heavier, the crowd  invaded the church, drove out the priests, trampled the Holy Sacrament  under foot, and broke the sacred images. This being accomplished,  Guillaume Moget entered the pulpit, and resumed his sermon with such  eloquence that his hearers' excitement redoubled, and not satisfied with  what had already been done, rushed off to seize on the Franciscan  monastery, where they forthwith installed Moget and the two women, who,  according to Menard the historian of Languedoc, never left him day or  night; all which proceedings were regarded by Captain Bouillargues with  magnificent calm.    The consuls being once more summoned before M. de Villars, who had again  become governor, would gladly have denied the existence of disorder; but  finding this impossible, they threw themselves on his mercy. He being  unable to repose confidence in them any longer, sent a garrison to the  citadel of Nimes, which the municipality was obliged to support,  appointed a governor of the city with four district captains under him,  and formed a body of military police which quite superseded the  municipal constabulary. Moget was expelled from Nimes, and Captain  Bouillargues deprived of office.    Francis II dying in his turn, the usual effect was produced,--that is,  the persecution became less fierce,--and Moget therefore returned to  Nimes. This was a victory, and every victory being a step forward, the  triumphant preacher organised a Consistory, and the deputies of Nimes  demanded from the States-General of Orleans possession of the churches.  No notice was taken of this demand; but the Protestants were at no loss  how to proceed. On the 21st December 1561 the churches of Ste. Eugenie,  St. Augustin, and the Cordeliers were taken by assault, and cleared of  their images in a hand's turn; and this time Captain Bouillargues was  not satisfied with looking on, but directed the operations.    The cathedral was still safe, and in it were entrenched the remnant of  the Catholic clergy; but it was apparent that at the earliest  opportunity it too would be turned into a meeting-house; and this  opportunity was not long in coming.    One Sunday, when Bishop Bernard d'Elbene had celebrated mass, just as  the regular preacher was about to begin his sermon, some children who  were playing in the close began to hoot the 'beguinier' [a name of  contempt for friars]. Some of the faithful being disturbed in their  meditations, came out of the church and chastised the little Huguenots,  whose parents considered themselves in consequence to have been insulted  in the persons of their children. A great commotion ensued, crowds began  to form, and cries of \"To the church! to the church!\" were heard.  Captain Bouillargues happened to be in the neighbourhood, and being very  methodical set about organising the insurrection; then putting himself  at its head, he charged the cathedral, carrying everything before him,  in spite of the barricades which had been"]]]
