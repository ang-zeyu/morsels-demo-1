So      startlingly original was his approach to the dark castles and      haunted woodlands of his own somber creation that he transcended the      literary by the sheer magic of his prose. Something of that same      magic gleams in the darkly-tapestried little fantasy presented here,      beneath Evelyn Smith's eerily enchanted wand._           the   doorway     _by ... Evelyn E. Smith_       A man may wish he'd married his first love and not really mean   it. But an insincere wish may turn ugly in dimensions unknown.      \"It is my theory,\" Professor Falabella said, helping himself to a  cookie, \"that no one ever really makes a decision. What really happens  is that whenever alternative courses of action are called for, the  individuality splits up and continues on two or more divergent planes,  very much like the parthenogenesis of a unicellular animal ... Delicious  cookies these, Mrs. Hughes.\"    \"Thank you, Professor,\" Gloria simpered. \"I made them myself.\"    \"You must give us the recipe,\" said one of the ladies--and the others  murmured agreement, glad to get their individualities on a plane they  could understand.    \"Since most decisions are hardly as momentous as the individual  imagines,\" Professor Falabella continued, \"and since the imagination of  the average individual is very limited, many of these different  planes--or, as they are colloquially known, space-time continuums--may  exist in close, even tangential relationship.\"    Gloria rose unobtrusively and took the teapot to the kitchen for a  refill. Her husband stood by the sink moodily drinking whiskey out of  the bottle so as to avoid having to wash a glass afterward.    \"Bill, you're not being polite to our guests. Why don't you go out and  listen to Professor Falabella?\"    \"I can hear him perfectly well from here,\" Bill muttered--and indeed the  professor's mellifluous tones pervaded every nook and cranny of the  thin-walled house. \"Long-winded cultist! What is he a professor of, I'd  like to know.\"    \"Professor Falabella is _not_ a cultist!\" affirmed Gloria angrily. \"He's  a great philosopher.\"    Bill Hughes said something unprintable. \"If I'd married Lucy Allison,\"  he continued unkindly, \"she'd never have filled the house with  long-haired cultists on my so-called day of rest.\"    Gloria's soft chin trembled, and her blue eyes filled with tears. She  was beginning to put on weight, he noticed. \"I've been hearing nothing  but Lucy Allison, Lucy Allison, Lucy Allison for the past year. Y-you  said yourself she looked like a horse.\"    \"Horses,\" he observed, \"have sense.\"    He was being brutal, but he couldn't help it and didn't want to.  Professor Falabella was only the most long-winded of a long series of  mystics Gloria was forever dragging into the house. _The trouble with  the half-educated_, he thought bitterly, _is that they seek culture in  the most peculiar places_.    \"I'll bet she would have let me have peace on Sunday,\" he said. \"It just  goes to show what happens when you marry a woman solely for her looks.\"  He drained the bottle; then hurled it into the garbage pail with a  resounding crash.    Gloria's shoulders shook as she filled the kettle. \"I wish I'd decided  to be an old maid,\" she sobbed.    A very unlikely possibility, he thought. Even now, shopworn as she was,  Gloria could have a fairly wide range of suitors should something happen  to him. She looked sexy, but how deceiving appearances could be!    Professor Falabella was still talking as Bill and Gloria emerged from  the kitchen. \"I believe that it is possible for an individual who exists  on a limited plane of imagination to transpose from one plane to an  adjacent one without difficulty ... Great Heavens, what was that?\"    Something had whisked past the archway leading into the foyer.    \"Don't pay any attention,\" Gloria smiled nervously. \"The house is  haunted.\"    \"My dear,\" one of the ladies offered, \"I know of the most marvelous  exterminator--\"    \"The house,\" Gloria assured her coldly, \"really _is_ haunted. We've been  seeing things ever since we moved in.\"    And she really believed it, Bill thought. Believed that the house was  haunted, that is. Of course he had seen things too--but he was  enlightened enough to know that ghosts don't exist, even if you do see  them.    Professor Falabella cleared his throat. \"As I was saying, it is possible  to send the individual through another--well, dimension, as some popular  writers would have it, to one of his other spatial existences on the  same temporal plane. It is merely necessary for him to find the Door.\"    \"Nonsense!\" Bill interrupted. \"Holy, unmitigated nonsense!\"    Every head swivelled to look at him. Gloria restrained tears with an  effort.    \"Brute,\" someone muttered.    But ridicule apparently only stimulated the professor. He beamed. \"You  don't believe me. Your imagination cannot extend to the comprehension of  the multifariousness of space.\"    \"Nonsense,\" Bill said again, but less confidently.    \"I believe that I have discovered the Doorway,\" Professor Falabella  continued, \"and the Way is Open. However, most people fear to penetrate  the unknown, even though it is to enter another phase of their own  existence. I do admit that the shock of spatial transference, no matter  how slight, combined with the concrete awareness of a previous spatial  relationship would be perhaps too much for the keenly sensitive  individualism ...\"    Bill opened his mouth.    \"I know what you're about to say, young man!\"    \"You don't have to be a mind reader to know that,\" Bill assured him. His  consonants were already a little slurred and he knew Gloria was ashamed  of him. It served her right. He'd been ashamed of her for years.    Professor Falabella smiled. His teeth were very sharp and white. \"Very  well, Mr. Hughes, since you are a skeptic, perhaps you will not object  to being the subject of our experiment yourself?\"    \"What kind of an experiment?\" Bill asked suspiciously.    \"Merely to go through the Door. Any door can become the Doorway, if it  is transposed into the proper spatial dimension. That door, for  instance.\" Professor Falabella waved his hand toward the doorway of what  Gloria liked to call \"Bill's study.\"    \"You mean you just want me to open the door and go into that room?\" Bill  asked incredulously. \"That's all?\"    \"That is all. Of course, you go with the awareness that it is the  threshold of another plane and that you step voluntarily from this  existence to an adjacent one.\"    \"Sure,\" Bill said. He had just remembered there was a nearly full bottle  of Calvert in the bottom drawer of the desk. \"Sure. Anything to oblige.\"    \"Very well. Go to the door, and keep remembering that of your own free  will you are passing from this plane to the next.\"    \"Look out, everybody!\" Bill called raucously, as he pulled open the  door. \"I'm coming in on the next plane!\"    No one laughed.    He stepped over the threshold, shutting the door firmly behind him. A  wonderful excuse to get away from those blasted women. He'd climb out of  the window as soon as he'd collected the whiskey and give them a nervous  moment thinking he'd really passed into another existence. It would  serve Gloria right.    For a moment, as he crossed, he had a queer sensation. Maybe there was  something in what Professor Falabella said. But no, there he was in the  study. All that mumbo jumbo was getting him down, that was all. He was a  nervous man--only nobody appreciated the fact.    Taking a cigarette out of the pack in his pocket, he reached for the  lighter on his desk. It wasn't there. Time and time again he'd told  Gloria not to touch his things, and always she'd disobeyed him. Company  was coming and she must tidy up. Cooking and cleaning--that was all she  was good for. But this was carrying tidiness too far; she'd even removed  the ashtrays.    And where did that glass block paperweight come from? He'd had a penguin  in a snowstorm and he'd been happy with it. This was too much. He'd tell  Gloria off. Stealing a man's penguin!    He opened the door into the living room and bumped into Lucy Allison.  \"Don't you think you've been in there long enough, Bill?\" she asked  acridly. \"I'm sure your guests would appreciate catching a glimpse of  you.\"    \"Why, hello, Lucy,\" he said, surprised. \"I didn't know Gloria had  invited you--\"    \"Gloria, Gloria, Gloria!\" Lucy cut across his sentence. \"You've been  talking about nothing but that dumb little blonde for months.\" Because  of the people in the room beyond, her voice was pitched low, but her  pale eyes glittered unpleasantly behind her spectacles. \"I wish you had  married her. You'd have made a fine pair.\"    Gently, caressingly, the short hairs on the back of Bill's neck rose.    \"Come back in here,\" Lucy said, hauling him back into the living room  where a number of people who had been enjoying the domestic fracas  suddenly broke into loud and animated chatter. \"Dr. Hildebrand was  telling us all about nuclear fission.\"    \"Can't find an ashtray,\" Bill muttered, seizing on something tangible.  \"Can't find an ashtray in the whole darn place.\"    \"We've been over this millions of times, Bill. You know--\" she smiled at  the guests, a smile that carefully excluded Bill. \"--I'm allergic to  smoke, but I never can get my husband to remember he isn't to smoke  inside the house.\"    \"Now take the neutron, for example,\" Dr. Hildebrand said through a  mouthful of pate. \"What is the neutron? It is only ... What was that?\"    The wraith of Gloria crossed the foyer and disappeared. Bill took a step  forward; then stood still.    Lucy smiled self-consciously. \"That's nothing at all. The house is  merely haunted.\"    Everyone laughed.    \"Forgot something,\" Bill muttered, and dashed back into the study. He  yanked open the bottom drawer of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29205"],[0,"Grove of the Unborn (#1)"],[1,"Lyn Venable of Dallas, Texas, makes a first appearance in      these pages (but by no means her first appearance in this field),      with this sensitive story of a young man who needn't have run.

LYN VENABLE_       Bheel still stood on the patio, transfixed with horror.   He heard the terrified cry \"Dheb Tyn-Dall\"--and then the   vigilant Guardians got him....      Tyndall heard the rockets begin to roar, and it seemed as though the  very blood in his veins pulsated with the surging of those mighty jets.  Going? They couldn't be going. Not yet. Not without him! And he heard  the roaring rise to a mighty crescendo, and he felt the trembling of the  ground beneath the room in which he lay, and then the great sound grew  less, and grew dim, and finally dissipated in a thin hum that dwindled  finally into silence. They were gone.           *       *       *       *       *    Tyndall threw himself face down on his couch, the feel of the slick,  strange fabric cold and unfriendly against his face. He lay there for a  long time, not moving. Tyndall's thoughts during those hours were of  very fundamental things, that beneath him, beneath the structure of the  building in which he was confined, lay a world that was not Earth,  circling a sun that was not Sol, and that the ship had gone and would  never come back. He was alone, abandoned. He thought of the ship, a  silver streak now in the implacable blackness of space, threading its  way homeward through the stars to Sol, to Earth. The utter desolation  which swept over him at the impact of his aloneness was more than he  could endure, and he forced himself to think of something else.    Why was he here then? John Tyndall, 3rd Engineer of the starship  _Polaris_. It had been such a routine trip, ferrying a group of  zoologists and biologists around the galaxy looking for unclassified  life-supporting planets. They had found such a world circling an obscure  sun half way across the galaxy. An ideal world for research expedition,  teeming with life, the scientists were delighted. In a few short months  they discovered and cataloged over a thousand varieties of flora and  fauna peculiar to this planet, called Arrill, after the native name  which sounded something like Ahhrhell. Yes, there were natives,  humanoid, civilized and gracious. They had seemed to welcome the  strangers, as a matter of fact they had seemed to expect them.    The Arrillians had learned English easily, its basic sounds not being  too alien to their own tongue. They had quite a city there on the edge  of the jungle, although, in circling the planet before landing, the  expedition had noted that this was the only city. On a world only a  little smaller than Earth, one city, surrounded completely by the  tropical jungle which covered the rest of the world. A city without  power, without machinery of any kind, and yet a city that was  self-sufficient.    Well-tilled fields stretched to the very edge of the jungle, where high  walls kept out the voracious growth. The fields fed the city well, and  clothed it well. And there were mines to yield up fine metal and  precious gems. The Earthmen had marveled, and yet, it had seemed  strange. On all this planet, just one city with perhaps half a million  people within its walls. But this was not a problem for the expedition.    The crew of the _Polaris_ and the members of the expedition had spent  many an enjoyable evening in the dining hall of the palace-like home of  the Rhal, who was something more than a mayor and something less than a  king. Actually, Arrill seemed to get along with a minimum of government.  All in all, the Earthmen had summed up the Arrillians as being a naive,  mild, and courteous people. They probably still thought so, all of them,  that is, except Tyndall.    Of course, now that he looked back upon it, there has been a few  things ... that business about the Bugs, as the Earthmen had dubbed the  oddly ugly creatures who seemed to occupy something of the position of  a sacred cow in the Arrillian scheme of things. The Bugs came in all  sizes, that is all sizes from a foot or so in length up to the size of  a full human.    The Bugs were not permitted to roam the streets and market places, like  the sacred cows of the Earthly Hindus. The Bugs were kept in huge pens,  which none but a few high-ranking priests were permitted to enter, and  although the Earthmen were not prevented from standing outside the pens  and watching the ugly beasts munching grass or basking in the sun, the  Arrillians always seemed nervous when the strangers were about the pens.  The Earthmen had shrugged and reflected that religion was a complexity  difficult enough at home, needless to probe too deeply into the  Arrillian.    But The Time had been something else again, bringing with it, the first  sign of real Arrillian fanaticism and the first hint of violence.  Tyndall and four companions were strolling in a downtown section of the  city, when all at once a hoarse cry in Arrillian shattered the quiet hum  of street activity.    \"What did he say?\" asked one of Tyndall's companions, who had not  learned much Arrillian.    \"I--I think, 'A Time! A Time!' What could ...\" he never finished the  sentence, all about them Arrillians had prostrated themselves in the  rather dirty street, covering their faces with their hands, lying face  down. The Earthmen hesitated a moment, and a priest of Arrill appeared  as though from nowhere, a wicked scimitar-like weapon in his hand and a  face tense with anger.    \"Dare you,\" he hissed in Arrillian, \"dare you not hide your eyes at A  Time!\" He pushed one of the Earthmen with surprising strength, and the  latter stumbled to his knees. All five men hastened to ape the position  of the prostrate Arrillians; they knew better to risk committing  sacrilege on a strange planet. As Tyndall sank to the ground and covered  his eyes, he heard that priest mutter another sentence, in which his own  name was included. He thought it was \"You, Tyn-Dall ... even you.\"    A few moments later a bell sounded from somewhere, and the buzzing of  conversation began around them, along with the shuffling, scraping sound  of many people getting to their feet at once. A hand touched Tyndall's  shoulder and an Arrillian voice, laughing now, purred, \"Up stranger, up,  The Time is past.\"    The Earthmen got to their feet. Everything about them was the same as  though nothing had happened, people strolling along the street, going  in and out of shops, stopping to chat.    \"I guess that was the all-clear,\" commented one wryly.    The others laughed nervously, but Tyndall was strangely troubled, he was  thinking of the strange words of the priest, \"You, Tyn-Dall, even you.\"  Why should he have known, and not the others? He tried to forget it.  Arrillian was a complex tongue with confusing syntax, perhaps the priest  had said something else. But Tyndall knew one thing for certain, the  mention of his name had been unmistakable.    The mood hung on, and quite suddenly Tyndall had asked, \"I wonder about  the children. Why do you suppose it is?\"    One of the men laughed, \"Maybe they feed them to the Bugs.\" At no time,  during their stay on Arrill, had they seen a single child, or young  person under the age of about twenty-one. The crew had speculated upon  this at great length, coming to the conclusion that the youngsters were  kept secluded for some reason known only to the Arrillians, probably  some part of their religion. One of them had made so bold as to ask one  of the scientists who politely told him that since his group was not  composed of ethnologists or theologists, but of biologists and  zoologists, they were interested neither in the Arrillians, their  offspring nor their religion, but merely in the flora and fauna of the  planet, both of which seemed to be rather deadly. The expedition had had  several close calls in the jungle, and some of the plants seemed as  violently carnivorous as the animals.    It was just a few days after the incident that the Arrillians kidnapped  Tyndall. It had been a simple, old-fashioned sort of job, pulled off  with efficiency and dispatch as he wandered a few hundred feet away from  the ship. It was late, and he had been unable to sleep, so he had  strolled out for a smoke. The nightwatch must have been somewhere about  on patrol, probably only a few hundred feet away, on the other side of  the ship. It happened suddenly and silently, the hand clapped over his  mouth, the forearm constricting his windpipe, his legs jerked out from  under him, and a rag smelling sickly-sweet shoved under his nose,  bringing oblivion.           *       *       *       *       *    When he came to consciousness, he found himself in this room, and he  knew that since then, many days and nights had passed. His wants were  meticulously attended to, his bath prepared, his food brought to him  regularly, delicious and steaming, with a generous supply of full-bodied  Arrillian wine to wash it down. Fresh clothes were brought to him daily,  the loose-flowing, highly ornamented robe of the Arrillian noble.  Tyndall knew he was no ordinary prisoner, and somehow, this fact made  him doubly uneasy.    And then, tonight, the ship had blasted off without him. Tyndall could  easily reconstruct what had happened when his crewmates had inquired  about him, at the palace and in town. \"Tyn-Dall?\" Then, a sorrowful  expression, a shrugging of the shoulders, a pointing toward the  death-infested jungle, and a mournful shaking of the head, sign language  which in any tongue meant, \"Tyn-Dall wanders too far from"]]]
