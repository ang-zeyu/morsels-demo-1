HISTORY      Among the wonderful monuments to which the religious art of the  middle ages has given rise and which will for ever excite the  admiration of men, the church of _Notre-Dame_ or Cathedral of  Strasburg occupies one of the first ranks. By its dimensions, the  richness of the ornaments and figures that adorn its exterior, by  the majesty of its nave, and by its light steeple, which towers  towards Heaven with as much grace as boldness, this house of God  proclaims afar its destination and leaves a deep and indelible  impression on the soul of any one who gazes on it.    Exhibiting in all its different parts models of every epoch of  christian architecture, this Cathedral is for the artist a  subject of serious study and for the inhabitant of Strasburg a  venerable monument, which recalls to his mind the principal  events of the ancient history of our city.    According to some old traditions, the Cathedral is built on a  spot, which, from the remotest times, had been devoted to  worship. Originally this spot formed a hill sloping westward into  a cavity, which was filled up many centuries ago. Around it, the  Celts, the first inhabitants of our country, built their huts:  its summit was covered by the sacred wood, in the midst of which  rose the druidical _dolmen_. It was there that those barbarians  offered sacrifices to Esus, their God of war, sacrifices which,  in times of public calamity, were human victims.    After the conquest of Gaul by the Romans, a regular and fortified  town was very soon founded on the place hitherto occupied by the  scattered habitations of the Celts. The old name of _Argentorat_  was alone preserved; it signified a town where the river is  crossed over. It was there, according to tradition, that a temple  dedicated to Hercules and Mars succeeded the druidical forest.  There is nothing unlikely in these traditions; the high ground on  which the Cathedral stands speaks as much in their favour as the  pagan statues found in the neighbourhood[1].      [1] A brass statue of Hercules, called _Krutzmann_, was found    among the christian statues that decorated the Cathedral; it was    taken down in 1525 and is no longer extant. A Hercules of stone,    found no doubt when digging the foundations, is yet seen in a    niche of the northward tower, where it juts out into the nave. A    small stone figure of Mars, coming also from the Cathedral, was    preserved in the town-library, but it appeared to be modern.    With respect to the first erection of a christian church in this  place, history is destitute of authentic facts. Some old  chronicles report that about the middle of the fourth century,  saint Amand built a church on the ruins of a Roman temple, but  the existence of this supposed first bishop of Strasburg is even  very doubtful. During the first years of the fifth century, the  invasion of barbarians filled the provinces of Gaul with terror  and devastation; the German tribes that crossed the Rhine  plundered the Roman city of Argentorat and its temples. Nobody  knows whether from that time new inhabitants settled in the midst  of these ruins, or whether they served but as temporary abodes to  the hordes successively coming into Gaul.    It was only after the conquest of that extensive country by the  Franks that, about 510, Clovis had a church built at Argentorat,  no doubt on the spot where the Cathedral now stands. The  architecture of that church was as coarse and barbarous as the  spirit of those times; it was built of wood and supported by  earthen walls, extending from East to West; on this latter end  was the front-gate and before it a portico; besides the principal  nave it had two aisles; the western side opening into a yard that  served as a passage to the priest's house.    In proportion as the town, the name of which was by the Franks  changed into Strasburg, increased in importance and population,  the Merovegian kings granted greater favours to the church  founded by one of their predecessors. The valuable donations they  bestowed on the bishopric of Strasburg, enabled the inhabitants  to embellish and enlarge the Cathedral. In 675 Dagobert II  granted to bishop Arbogast the town of Ruffach with the castle of  Isenburg and a vaste domain that he freed from tax and royal  jurisdiction and which on that account was called superior  _Mundat_. A no less important gift was that from Count Rudhart,  who made over to the church of Strasburg, in 748, Ettenheim with  several neighbouring villages on the right bank of the Rhine.  Many other eminent personages of this country increased  successively by their liberality the wealth of the episcopal see.  A great advantage was granted by Charlemain in 775, which was to  exempt the subjects of the bishopric from all tolls and taxes  imposed upon the traders travelling through the empire. At that  time considerable sums had already been employed to adorn the  interior of the Cathedral. In the year 826, the abbot Ermold the  Black, living in exile at Strasburg, speaks with enthusiasm of  the _beautiful temple of the Virgin_ and of the other altars that  decorate it. This ecclesiastic, with great ardour changed the  metal of the antique statues he could yet find into sacred  vases; a bronze Hercules, two cubits high, alone escaped the  pursuit of his pious zeal; after preserving it several centuries  in the Cathedral, it was at last sold, and is now at Issy near  Paris.    A fire, which in 873 destroyed a portion of the church and all  its archives, occasioned, no doubt, important repairs, and this  event was the cause of a new royal confirmation of all the  possessions of the church. In 1002 it was plundered, profaned and  set on fire by the soldiers of Hermann, duke of Suabia and  Alsacia, who was then contending with Henry of Bavaria for the  imperial crown, Strasburg and its bishop Wernher having declared  for the latter. Subdued by Henry II, Hermann was compelled to  repair the damage caused to the church by placing at bishop  Wernher's disposal the income of the abbey of Saint-Stephen of  which he was the patron. With these funds, which the bishop  increased by means of a new levy of taxes and by indulgences,  he was preparing to restore his Cathedral, when in 1007 a  thunderbolt achieved its destruction.    He then formed the project of rebuilding the church on a plan of  much larger dimensions and after the style of architecture that  was then making its first appearance. The revenues of the  bishopric, contributions furnished by the clergy of Alsacia and  large sums of money granted by the head of the empire, afforded  Wernher the necessary resources for the execution of his plan.  This was examined and discussed in the presence of several  master-architects whom he had sent for. The plan once fixed upon,  stones were brought from the fine quarries of free-stone in the  Kronthal. The peasants and bondsmen of the country brought them  to the town where they were cut in the square then called  _Frohnhof_, between the Cathedral and the present palace. It was  during these labours that in 1042 the emperor Henry II came to  Strasburg; the dignified and austere deportment of the clergy of  the high chapter, the tranquillity prevailing under the roof of  the episcopal church, made such an impression on this prince,  that he for a moment resolved to resign the crown and solicit his  admittance among the canons of the Cathedral. The bishop appeared  at first to accede to this wish; but it was only to prescribe to  Henry, henceforth his subordinate, to resume the imperial  authority which Providence had bestowed on him; the emperor  acquiesced and perpetuated the remembrance of his pious wish by  the foundation of a royal prebend.    When, in 1015, a sufficient quantity of materials was collected,  they set to work by digging the ground. At the depth of more than  five fathoms they drove down stakes, filled the space between  them with clay mixed with lime, fragments of bricks and coal; and  on this solid base were laid the foundation stones.    Tradition gives an account of a hundred and even two hundred  thousand men being employed in the construction of this church,  which work, thanks to the religious enthusiasm of that epoch and  the labours performed by vassals and workmen _for the salvation  of their souls_, advanced very rapidly.    In the year 1027 bishop Wernher set out for Constantinople, and  never returned to his native land. From that time we have but  imperfect and uncertain accounts touching the progress of the  building. All we know is, that in 1028 they had built up to the  roof. It seems likely from that account that this monument, built  in the byzantine style, at once so elegant"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22994"],[0,"The Frontier in American History (#1)"],[1,"(https://www.pgdp.net)        Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes images of the original pages.

THE FRONTIER IN AMERICAN HISTORY    by    FREDERICK JACKSON TURNER                [Illustration]      New York  Henry Holt and Company  1921    Copyright, 1920  by  Frederick J. Turner      TO  CAROLINE M. TURNER  MY WIFE          PREFACE      In republishing these essays in collected form, it has seemed best to  issue them as they were originally printed, with the exception of a few  slight corrections of slips in the text and with the omission of  occasional duplication of language in the different essays. A  considerable part of whatever value they may possess arises from the  fact that they are commentaries in different periods on the central  theme of the influence of the frontier in American history. Consequently  they may have some historical significance as contemporaneous attempts  of a student of American history, at successive transitions in our  development during the past quarter century to interpret the relations  of the present to the past. Grateful acknowledgment is made to the  various societies and periodicals which have given permission to reprint  the essays.    Various essays dealing with the connection of diplomatic history and the  frontier and others stressing the significance of the section, or  geographic province, in American history, are not included in the  present collection. Neither the French nor the Spanish frontier is  within the scope of the volume.    The future alone can disclose how far these interpretations are correct  for the age of colonization which came gradually to an end with the  disappearance of the frontier and free land. It alone can reveal how  much of the courageous, creative American spirit, and how large a part  of the historic American ideals are to be carried over into that new age  which is replacing the era of free lands and of measurable isolation by  consolidated and complex industrial development and by increasing  resemblances and connections between the New World and the Old.    But the larger part of what has been distinctive and valuable in  America's contribution to the history of the human spirit has been due  to this nation's peculiar experience in extending its type of frontier  into new regions; and in creating peaceful societies with new ideals in  the successive vast and differing geographic provinces which together  make up the United States. Directly or indirectly these experiences  shaped the life of the Eastern as well as the Western States, and even  reacted upon the Old World and influenced the direction of its thought  and its progress. This experience has been fundamental in the economic,  political and social characteristics of the American people and in their  conceptions of their destiny.    Writing at the close of 1796, the French minister to the United States,  M. Adet, reported to his government that Jefferson could not be relied  on to be devoted to French interests, and he added: \"Jefferson, I say,  is American, and by that name, he cannot be sincerely our friend. An  American is the born enemy of all European peoples.\" Obviously erroneous  as are these words, there was an element of truth in them. If we would  understand this element of truth, we must study the transforming  influence of the American wilderness, remote from Europe, and by its  resources and its free opportunities affording the conditions under  which a new people, with new social and political types and ideals,  could arise to play its own part in the world, and to influence Europe.

In the discussion of its extent, its  westward movement, etc., it can not, therefore, any longer have a place  in the census reports.\" This brief official statement marks the closing  of a great historic movement. Up to our own day American history has  been in a large degree the history of the colonization of the Great  West. The existence of an area of free land, its continuous recession,  and the advance of American settlement westward, explain American  development.    Behind institutions, behind constitutional forms and modifications, lie  the vital forces that call these organs into life and shape them to meet  changing conditions. The peculiarity of American institutions is, the  fact that they have been compelled to adapt themselves to the changes of  an expanding people--to the changes involved in crossing a continent, in  winning a wilderness, and in developing at each area of this progress  out of the primitive economic and political conditions of the frontier  into the complexity of city life. Said Calhoun in 1817, \"We are great,  and rapidly--I was about to say fearfully--growing!\"[2:1] So saying, he  touched the distinguishing feature of American life. All peoples show  development; the germ theory of politics has been sufficiently  emphasized. In the case of most nations, however, the development has  occurred in a limited area; and if the nation has expanded, it has met  other growing peoples whom it has conquered. But in the case of the  United States we have a different phenomenon. Limiting our attention to  the Atlantic coast, we have the familiar phenomenon of the evolution of  institutions in a limited area, such as the rise of representative  government; the differentiation of simple colonial governments into  complex organs; the progress from primitive industrial society, without  division of labor, up to manufacturing civilization. But we have in  addition to this a recurrence of the process of evolution in each  western area reached in the process of expansion. Thus American  development has exhibited not merely advance along a single line, but a  return to primitive conditions on a continually advancing frontier line,  and a new development for that area. American social development has  been continually beginning over again on the frontier. This perennial  rebirth, this fluidity of American life, this expansion westward with  its new opportunities, its continuous touch with the simplicity of  primitive society, furnish the forces dominating American character. The  true point of view in the history of this nation is not the Atlantic  coast, it is the Great West. Even the slavery struggle, which is made so  exclusive an object of attention by writers like Professor von Holst,  occupies its important place in American history because of its relation  to westward expansion.    In this advance, the frontier is the outer edge of the wave--the meeting  point between savagery and civilization. Much has been written about the  frontier from the point of view of border warfare and the chase, but as  a field for the serious study of the economist and the historian it has  been neglected.    The American frontier is sharply distinguished from the European  frontier--a fortified boundary line running through dense populations.  The most significant thing about the American frontier is, that it lies  at the hither edge of free land. In the census reports it is treated as  the margin of that settlement which has a density of two or more to the  square mile. The term is an elastic one, and for our purposes does not  need sharp definition. We shall consider the whole frontier belt,  including the Indian country and the outer margin of the \"settled area\"  of the census reports. This paper will make no attempt to treat the  subject exhaustively; its aim is simply to call attention to the  frontier as a fertile field for investigation, and to suggest some of  the problems which arise in connection with it.    In the settlement of America we have to observe how European life  entered the continent,"]]]
