He ate the starfish and the garfish, and the crab and the  dab, and the plaice and the dace, and the skate and his mate, and the  mackereel and the pickereel, and the really truly twirly-whirly eel. All  the fishes he could find in all the sea he ate with his mouth--so! Till  at last there was only one small fish left in all the sea, and he was a  small 'Stute Fish, and he swam a little behind the Whale's right ear,  so as to be out of harm's way. Then the Whale stood up on his tail and  said, 'I'm hungry.' And the small 'Stute Fish said in a small 'stute  voice, 'Noble and generous Cetacean, have you ever tasted Man?'    'No,' said the Whale. 'What is it like?'    'Nice,' said the small 'Stute Fish. 'Nice but nubbly.'    'Then fetch me some,' said the Whale, and he made the sea froth up with  his tail.    'One at a time is enough,' said the 'Stute Fish. 'If you swim to  latitude Fifty North, longitude Forty West (that is magic), you will  find, sitting _on_ a raft, _in_ the middle of the sea, with nothing on  but a pair of blue canvas breeches, a pair of suspenders (you must _not_  forget the suspenders, Best Beloved), and a jack-knife, one  ship-wrecked Mariner, who, it is only fair to tell you, is a man of  infinite-resource-and-sagacity.'    So the Whale swam and swam to latitude Fifty North, longitude Forty  West, as fast as he could swim, and _on_ a raft, _in_ the middle of the  sea, _with_ nothing to wear except a pair of blue canvas breeches, a  pair of suspenders (you must particularly remember the suspenders, Best  Beloved), _and_ a jack-knife, he found one single, solitary shipwrecked  Mariner, trailing his toes in the water. (He had his mummy's leave to  paddle, or else he would never have done it, because he was a man of  infinite-resource-and-sagacity.)    Then the Whale opened his mouth back and back and back till it nearly  touched his tail, and he swallowed the shipwrecked Mariner, and the  raft he was sitting on, and his blue canvas breeches, and the suspenders  (which you _must_ not forget), _and_ the jack-knife--He swallowed them  all down into his warm, dark, inside cup-boards, and then he smacked his  lips--so, and turned round three times on his tail.    But as soon as the Mariner, who was a man of  infinite-resource-and-sagacity, found himself truly inside the Whale's  warm, dark, inside cup-boards, he stumped and he jumped and he thumped  and he bumped, and he pranced and he danced, and he banged and he  clanged, and he hit and he bit, and he leaped and he creeped, and he  prowled and he howled, and he hopped and he dropped, and he cried and he  sighed, and he crawled and he bawled, and he stepped and he lepped, and  he danced hornpipes where he shouldn't, and the Whale felt most unhappy  indeed. (_Have_ you forgotten the suspenders?)    So he said to the 'Stute Fish, 'This man is very nubbly, and besides he  is making me hiccough. What shall I do?'    'Tell him to come out,' said the 'Stute Fish.    So the Whale called down his own throat to the shipwrecked Mariner,  'Come out and behave yourself. I've got the hiccoughs.'    'Nay, nay!' said the Mariner. 'Not so, but far otherwise. Take me to my  natal-shore and the white-cliffs-of-Albion, and I'll think about it.'  And he began to dance more than ever.     'You had better take him home,' said the 'Stute Fish to the Whale.   'I ought to have warned you that he is a man of infinite-resource-and-sagacity.'    So the Whale swam and swam and swam, with both flippers and his tail,  as hard as he could for the hiccoughs; and at last he saw the Mariner's  natal-shore and the white-cliffs-of-Albion, and he rushed half-way  up the beach, and opened his mouth wide and wide and wide, and said,  'Change here for Winchester, Ashuelot, Nashua, Keene, and stations on  the _Fitch_burg Road;' and just as he said 'Fitch' the Mariner walked  out of his mouth. But while the Whale had been swimming, the Mariner,  who was indeed a person of infinite-resource-and-sagacity, had taken his  jack-knife and cut up the raft into a little square grating all running  criss-cross, and he had tied it firm with his suspenders (_now_, you  know why you were not to forget the suspenders!), and he dragged that  grating good and tight into the Whale's throat, and there it stuck! Then  he recited the following _Sloka_, which, as you have not heard it, I  will now proceed to relate--      By means of a grating    I have stopped your ating.    For the Mariner he was also an Hi-ber-ni-an. And he stepped out on the  shingle, and went home to his mother, who had given him leave to trail  his toes in the water; and he married and lived happily ever afterward.  So did the Whale. But from that day on, the grating in his throat,  which he could neither cough up nor swallow down, prevented him eating  anything except very, very small fish; and that is the reason why whales  nowadays never eat men or boys or little girls.    The small 'Stute Fish went and hid himself in the mud under the  Door-sills of the Equator. He was afraid that the Whale might be angry  with him.    The Sailor took the jack-knife home. He was wearing the blue canvas  breeches when he walked out on the shingle. The suspenders were left  behind, you see, to tie the grating with; and that is the end of _that_  tale.           WHEN the cabin port-holes are dark and green         Because of the seas outside;       When the ship goes _wop_ (with a wiggle between)       And the steward falls into the soup-tureen,         And the trunks begin to slide;       When Nursey lies on the floor in a heap,       And Mummy tells you to let her sleep,       And you aren't waked or washed or dressed,       Why, then you will know (if you haven't guessed)       You're 'Fifty North and Forty West!'          HOW THE CAMEL GOT HIS HUMP    NOW this is the next tale, and it tells how the Camel got his big hump.    In the beginning of years, when the world was so new and all, and the  Animals were just beginning to work for Man, there was a Camel, and he  lived in the middle of a Howling Desert because he did not want to work;  and besides, he was a Howler himself. So he ate sticks and thorns and  tamarisks and milkweed and prickles, most 'scruciating idle; and when  anybody spoke to him he said 'Humph!' Just 'Humph!' and no more.    Presently the Horse came to him on Monday morning, with a saddle on his  back and a bit in his mouth, and said, 'Camel, O Camel, come out and  trot like the rest of us.'    'Humph!' said the Camel; and the Horse went away and told the Man.    Presently the Dog came to him, with a stick in his mouth, and said,  'Camel, O Camel, come and fetch and carry like the rest of us.'    'Humph!' said the Camel; and the Dog went away and told the Man.    Presently the Ox came to him, with the yoke on his neck and said,  'Camel, O Camel, come and plough like the rest of us.'    'Humph!' said the Camel; and the Ox went away and told the Man.    At the end of the day the Man called the Horse and the Dog and the Ox  together, and said, 'Three, O Three, I'm very sorry for you (with the  world so new-and-all); but that Humph-thing in the Desert can't work,  or he would have been here by now, so I am going to leave him alone, and  you must work double-time to make up for it.'    That made the Three very angry (with the world so new-and-all), and they  held a palaver, and an _indaba_, and a _punchayet_, and a pow-wow on  the edge of the Desert; and the Camel came chewing on milkweed _most_  'scruciating idle, and laughed at them. Then he said 'Humph!' and went  away again.    Presently there came along the Djinn in charge of All Deserts, rolling  in a cloud of dust (Djinns always travel that way because it is Magic),  and he stopped to palaver and pow-pow with the Three.    'Djinn of All Deserts,' said the Horse, 'is it right for any one to be  idle, with the world so new-and-all?'    'Certainly not,' said the Djinn.    'Well,' said the Horse, 'there's a thing in the middle of your Howling  Desert (and he's a Howler himself) with a long neck and long legs, and  he hasn't done a stroke of work since Monday morning. He won't trot.'    'Whew!' said the Djinn, whistling, 'that's my Camel, for all the gold in  Arabia! What does he say about it?'    'He says \"Humph!\"' said the Dog; 'and he won't fetch and carry.'    'Does he say anything else?'    'Only \"Humph!\"; and he won't plough,' said the Ox.    'Very good,' said the Djinn. 'I'll humph him if you will kindly wait a  minute.'    The Djinn rolled himself up in his dust-cloak, and took a bearing across  the desert, and found the Camel most 'scruciatingly idle, looking at his  own reflection in a pool of water.    'My long and bubbling friend,' said the Djinn, 'what's this I hear of  your doing no work, with the world so new-and-all?'    'Humph!' said the Camel.    The Djinn sat down, with his chin in his hand, and began to think a  Great Magic, while the Camel looked at his own reflection in the pool of  water.    'You've given the Three extra work ever since Monday morning, all on  account of your 'scruciating idleness,' said the Djinn; and he went on  thinking Magics, with his chin in his hand.    'Humph!' said the Camel.    'I shouldn't say that again if I were you,' said the Djinn; you might  say it once too often. Bubbles, I want you to work.'

IN SEVEN PARTS,       WITH       PREFACE, INTRODUCTION,       AND       CONCLUDING REMARKS.       Reprint:       _Cosmopoli: MDCCCLXXXIII: for the Kama Shastra Society of     London and Benares, and for private circulation only._             DEDICATED       TO THAT SMALL PORTION OF THE BRITISH PUBLIC     WHICH TAKES ENLIGHTENED INTEREST IN     STUDYING THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS     OF THE OLDEN EAST.          PREFACE.      In the literature of all countries there will be found a certain number  of works treating especially of love. Everywhere the subject is dealt  with differently, and from various points of view. In the present  publication it is proposed to give a complete translation of what is  considered the standard work on love in Sanscrit literature, and which  is called the 'Vatsyayana Kama Sutra,' or Aphorisms on Love, by  Vatsyayana.    While the introduction will bear with the evidence concerning the date  of the writing, and the commentaries written upon it, the chapters  following the introduction will give a translation of the work itself.  It is, however, advisable to furnish here a brief analysis of works of  the same nature, prepared by authors who lived and wrote years after  Vatsya had passed away, but who still considered him as a great  authority, and always quoted him as the chief guide to Hindoo erotic  literature.    Besides the treatise of Vatsyayana the following works on the same  subject are procurable in India:--         1. The Ratirahasya, or secrets of love.         2. The Panchasakya, or the five arrows.         3. The Smara Pradipa, or the light of love.         4. The Ratimanjari, or the garland of love.         5. The Rasmanjari, or the sprout of love.         6. The Anunga Runga, or the stage of love; also called            Kamaledhiplava, or a boat in the ocean of love.    The author of the 'Secrets of Love' (No. 1) was a poet named Kukkoka. He  composed his work to please one Venudutta, who was perhaps a king. When  writing his own name at the end of each chapter he calls himself \"Siddha  patiya pandita,\" _i.e._, an ingenious man among learned men. The work  was translated into Hindi years ago, and in this the author's name was  written as Koka. And as the same name crept into all the translations  into other languages in India, the book became generally known, and the  subject was popularly called Koka Shastra, or doctrines of Koka, which  is identical with the Kama Shastra, or doctrines of love, and the words  Koka Shastra and Kama Shastra are used indiscriminately.    The work contains nearly eight hundred verses, and is divided into ten  chapters, which are called Pachivedas. Some of the things treated of in  this work are not to be found in the Vatsyayana, such as the four  classes of women, viz., the Padmini, Chitrini, Shankini and Hastini, as  also the enumeration of the days and hours on which the women of the  different classes become subject to love. The author adds that he wrote  these things from the opinions of Gonikaputra and Nandikeshwara, both of  whom are mentioned by Vatsyayana, but their works are not now extant. It  is difficult to give any approximate idea as to the year in which the  work was composed. It is only to be presumed that it was written after  that of Vatsyayana, and previous to the other works on this subject that  are still extant. Vatsyayana gives the names of ten authors on the  subject, all of whose works he had consulted, but none of which are  extant, and does not mention this one. This would tend to show that  Kukkoka wrote after Vatsya, otherwise Vatsya would assuredly have  mentioned him as an author in this branch of literature along with the  others.    The author of the 'Five Arrows' (No. 2 in the list) was one Jyotirisha.  He is called the chief ornament of poets, the treasure of the sixty-four  arts, and the best teacher of the rules of music. He says that he  composed the work after reflecting on the aphorisms of love as revealed  by the gods, and studying the opinions of Gonikaputra, Muladeva,  Babhravya, Ramtideva, Nundikeshwara and Kshemandra. It is impossible to  say whether he had perused all the works of these authors, or had only  heard about them; anyhow, none of them appear to be in existence now.  This work contains nearly six hundred verses, and is divided into five  chapters, called Sayakas or Arrows.    The author of the 'Light of Love' (No. 3) was the poet Gunakara, the son  of Vechapati. The work contains four hundred verses, and gives only a  short account of the doctrines of love, dealing more with other  matters.    'The Garland of Love' (No. 4) is the work of the famous poet Jayadeva,  who said about himself that he is a writer on all subjects. This  treatise is, however, very short, containing only one hundred and  twenty-five verses.    The author of the 'Sprout of Love' (No. 5) was a poet called Bhanudatta.  It appears from the last verse of the manuscript that he was a resident  of the province of Tirhoot, the son of a Brahman named Ganeshwar, who  was also a poet. The work, written in Sanscrit, gives the descriptions  of different classes of men and women, their classes being made out from  their age, description, conduct, etc. It contains three chapters, and  its date is not known, and cannot be ascertained.    'The Stage of Love' (No. 6) was composed by the poet Kullianmull, for  the amusement of Ladkhan, the son of Ahmed Lodi, the same Ladkhan being  in some places spoken of as Ladana Mull, and in others as Ladanaballa.  He is supposed to have been a relation or connection of the house of  Lodi, which reigned in Hindostan from A.D. 1450-1526. The work would,  therefore, have been written in the fifteenth or sixteenth century. It  contains ten chapters, and has been translated into English, but only  six copies were printed for private circulation. This is supposed to be  the latest of the Sanscrit works on the subject, and the ideas in it  were evidently taken from previous writings of the same nature.    The contents of these works are in themselves a literary curiosity.  There are to be found both in Sanscrit poetry and in the Sanscrit drama  a certain amount of poetical sentiment and romance, which have, in every  country and in every language, thrown an immortal halo round the  subject. But here it is treated in a plain, simple, matter of fact sort  of way. Men and women are divided into classes and divisions in the same  way that Buffon and other writers on natural history have classified and  divided the animal world. As Venus was represented by the Greeks to  stand forth as the type of the beauty of woman, so the Hindoos describe  the Padmini or Lotus woman as the type of most perfect feminine  excellence, as follows:    She in whom the following signs and symptoms appear is called a Padmini.  Her face is pleasing as the full moon; her body, well clothed with  flesh, is soft as the Shiras or mustard flower, her skin is fine,  tender and fair as the yellow lotus, never dark coloured. Her eyes are  bright and beautiful as the orbs of the fawn, well cut, and with reddish  corners. Her bosom is hard, full and high; she has a good neck; her nose  is straight and lovely, and three folds or wrinkles cross her  middle--about the umbilical region. Her yoni resembles the opening lotus  bud, and her love seed (Kama salila) is perfumed like the lily that has  newly burst. She walks with swan-like gait, and her voice is low and  musical as the note of the Kokila bird, she delights in white raiments,  in fine jewels, and in rich dresses. She eats little, sleeps lightly,  and being as respectful and religious as she is clever and courteous,  she is ever anxious to worship the gods, and to enjoy the conversation  of Brahmans. Such, then, is the Padmini or Lotus woman.    Detailed descriptions then follow of the Chitrini or Art woman; the  Shankhini or Conch woman, and the Hastini or Elephant woman, their days  of enjoyment, their various seats of passion, the manner in which they  should be manipulated and treated in sexual intercourse, along with the  characteristics of the men and women of the various countries in  Hindostan. The details are so numerous, and the subjects so seriously  dealt with, and at such length, that neither time nor space will permit  of their being given here.    One work in the English language is somewhat similar to these works of  the Hindoos. It is called 'Kalogynomia: or the Laws of Female Beauty,'  being the elementary principles of that science, by T. Bell, M.D., with  twenty-four plates, and printed in London in 1821. It treats of Beauty,  of Love, of Sexual Intercourse, of the Laws regulating that Intercourse,  of Monogamy and Polygamy, of Prostitution, of Infidelity, ending with a  _catalogue raisonnee_ of the defects of female beauty.    Other works in English also enter into great details of private and  domestic life. 'The Elements of Social Science, or Physical, Sexual and  Natural Religion,' by a Doctor of Medicine, London, 1880, and 'Every  Woman's Book,' by Dr. Waters, 1826. To persons interested in the above  subjects these works will be found to contain such details as have been  seldom before published, and which ought to be thoroughly understood by  all philanthropists and benefactors of society.    After a perusal of the Hindoo work, and of the English books above  mentioned, the reader will understand the subject, at all events from a  materialistic, realistic and practical point of view. If all science is  founded more or less on a stratum of facts, there can be no harm in  making known to mankind generally certain matters intimately "]]]
