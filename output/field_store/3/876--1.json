Time:       midnight.         Strepsiades (sitting up in his bed). Ah me! Ah me! O       King Jupiter, of what a terrible length the nights are!       Will it never be day? And yet long since I heard the       cock. My domestics are snoring; but they would not have       done so heretofore! May you perish then, O war! For many       reasons; because I may not even punish my domestics.       Neither does this excellent youth awake through the       night; but takes his ease, wrapped up in five blankets.       Well, if it is the fashion, let us snore wrapped up.           [Lies down, and then almost immediately starts up       again.]         But I am not able, miserable man, to sleep, being       tormented by my expenses, and my stud of horses, and my       debts, through this son of mine. He with his long hair,       is riding horses and driving curricles, and dreaming of       horses; while I am driven to distraction, as I see the       moon bringing on the twentieths;  for the interest is       running on. Boy! Light a lamp, and bring forth my       tablets, that I may take them and read to how many I am       indebted, and calculate the interest.         [Enter boy with a light and tablets.]         Come, let me see; what do I owe? Twelve minae  to       Pasias. Why twelve minae to Pasias? Why did I borrow       them? When I bought the blood-horse. Ah me, unhappy!       Would that it had had its eye knocked out with a stone       first!         Phidippides (talking in his sleep). You are acting       unfairly, Philo! Drive on your own course.         Strep. This is the bane that has destroyed me; for even       in his sleep he dreams about horsemanship.         Phid. How many courses will the war-chariots run?         Strep. Many courses do you drive me, your father. But       what debt came upon me after Pasias? Three minae to       Amynias for a little chariot and pair of wheels.         Phid. Lead the horse home, after having given him a good       rolling.         Strep. O foolish youth, you have rolled me out of my       possessions; since I have been cast in suits, and others       say that they will have surety given them for the       interest.         Phid. (awakening) Pray, father, why are you peevish, and       toss about the whole night?         Strep. A bailiff out of the bedclothes is biting       me.         Phid. Suffer me, good sir, to sleep a little.         Strep. Then, do you sleep on; but know that all these       debts will turn on your head.         [Phidippides falls asleep again.]         Alas! Would that the match-maker had perished miserably,       who induced me to marry your mother. For a country life       used to be most agreeable to me, dirty, untrimmed,       reclining at random, abounding in bees, and sheep, and       oil-cake. Then I, a rustic, married a niece of Megacles,       the son of Megacles, from the city, haughty, luxurious,       and Coesyrafied. When I married her, I lay with her       redolent of new wine, of the cheese-crate, and abundance       of wool; but she, on the contrary, of ointment, saffron,       wanton-kisses, extravagance, gluttony, and of Colias and       Genetyllis.  I will not indeed say that she was idle;       but she wove. And I used to show her this cloak by way       of a pretext and say \"Wife, you weave at a great       rate.\"         Servant re-enters.         Servant. We have no oil in the lamp.         Strep. Ah me! Why did you light the thirsty lamp? Come       hither that you may weep!         Ser. For what, pray, shall I weep?         Strep. Because you put in one of the thick wicks.         [Servant runs out]         After this, when this son was born to us, to me,       forsooth, and to my excellent wife, we squabbled then       about the name: for she was for adding hippos  to the       name, Xanthippus, or Charippus, or Callipides; but I was       for giving him the name of his grandfather, Phidonides.       For a time therefore we disputed; and then at length we       agreed, and called him Phidippides. She used to take       this son and fondle him, saying, \"When you, being grown       up, shall drive your chariot to the city, like Megacles,       with a xystis.\" But I used to say, \"Nay, rather, when       dressed in a leathern jerkin, you shall drive goats from       Phelleus, like your father.\" He paid no attention to my       words, but poured a horse-fever over my property. Now,       therefore, by meditating the whole night, I have       discovered one path for my course extraordinarily       excellent; to which if I persuade this youth I shall be       saved. But first I wish to awake him. How then can I       awake him in the most agreeable manner? How?       Phidippides, my little Phidippides?         Phid. What, father?         Strep. Kiss me, and give me your right hand!         Phid. There. What's the matter?         Strep. Tell me, do you love me?         Phid. Yes, by this Equestrian Neptune.         Strep. Nay, do not by any means mention this Equestrian       to me, for this god is the author of my misfortunes.       But, if you really love me from your heart, my son, obey       me.         Phid. In what then, pray, shall I obey you?         Strep. Reform your habits as quickly as possible, and go       and learn what I advise.         Phid. Tell me now, what do you prescribe?         Strep. And will you obey me at all?         Phid. By Bacchus,  I will obey you.         Strep. Look this way then! Do you see this little door       and little house?         Phid. I see it. What then, pray, is this, father?         Strep. This is a thinking-shop of wise spirits. There       dwell men who in speaking of the heavens persuade people       that it is an oven, and that it encompasses us, and that       we are the embers. These men teach, if one give them       money, to conquer in speaking, right or wrong.         Phid. Who are they?         Strep. I do not know the name accurately. They are       minute philosophers, noble and excellent.         Phid. Bah! They are rogues; I know them. You mean the       quacks, the pale-faced wretches, the bare-footed       fellows, of whose numbers are the miserable Socrates and       Chaerephon.         Strep. Hold! Hold! Be silent! Do not say anything       foolish. But, if you have any concern for your father's       patrimony, become one of them, having given up your       horsemanship.         Phid. I would not, by Bacchus, even if you were to give       me the pheasants which Leogoras  rears!         Strep. Go, I entreat you, dearest of men, go and be       taught.         Phid. Why, what shall I learn?         Strep. They say that among them are both the two       causes--the better cause, whichever that is, and the       worse: they say that the one of these two causes, the       worse, prevails, though it speaks on the unjust side.       If, therefore you learn for me this unjust cause, I       would not pay any one, not even an obolus of these       debts, which I owe at present on your account.         Phid. I can not comply; for I should not dare to look       upon the knights, having lost all my colour.         Strep. Then, by Ceres,  you shall not eat any of my       good! Neither you, nor your blood-horse; but I will       drive you out of my house to the crows.         Phid. My uncle Megacles will not permit me to be without       a horse. But I'll go in, and pay no heed to you.         [Exit Phidippides.]         Strep. Though fallen, still I will not lie prostrate:       but having prayed to the gods, I will go myself to the       thinking-shop and get taught. How, then, being an old       man, shall I learn the subtleties of refined       disquisitions? I must go. Why thus do I loiter and not       knock at the door?         [Knocks at the door.]         Boy! Little boy!         Disciple (from within). Go to the devil! Who it is that       knocked at the door?         Strep. Strepsiades, the son of Phidon, of Cicynna.         Dis. You are a stupid fellow, by Jove! who have kicked       against the door so very carelessly, and have caused the       miscarriage of an idea which I had conceived.         Strep. Pardon me; for I dwell afar in the country. But       tell me the thing which has been made to miscarry.         Dis. It is not lawful to mention it, except to       disciples.         Strep. Tell it, then, to me without fear; for I here am       come as a disciple to the thinking-shop.         Dis. I will tell you; but you must regard these as       mysteries. Socrates lately asked Chaerephon  about a       flea, how many of its own feet it jumped; for after       having bit the eyebrow of Chaerephon, it leaped away       onto the head of Socrates.         Strep. How then did he measure this?         Dis. Most cleverly. He melted some wax; and then took       the flea and dipped its feet in the wax; and then a pair       of Persian slippers stuck to it when cooled. Having       gently loosened these, he measured back the distance.         Strep. O King Jupiter! What subtlety of thought!         Dis. What then would you say if you heard another       contrivance of Socrates?         Strep. Of what kind? Tell me, I beseech you!         Dis. Chaerephon the Sphettian asked him whether he       thought gnats buzzed through the mouth or the breech.         Strep.

The persona created is that of a woman  who always tells the truth as she sees it, but it is made clear to the  reader that what the narrator sees is very seldom exactly the objective  truth. The author ends as well as begins _in medias res_ (in the middle  of the action), thus creating an illusion of a slice of a journal but  simultaneously giving the reader the uneasy feeling that the first and  last chapters seem to be missing.    The French-style quotation marks have, for ease in typesetting and use,  been changed to American-style quotation marks, and the dot after the  name of Louis XV has been removed to conform to American punctuation.  Captions of illustrations are omitted because the illustrations  themselves cannot be inserted. A few minor editing errors have been  silently corrected. No other changes have been made; the irregularity in  italicizing or not italicizing, in translating or not translating French  words, and in punctuating quotations of letters, is in the text itself.    Notes are identified as coming from author, tr. (translator), editor, or  Gutenberg editor.
