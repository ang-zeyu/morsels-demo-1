Maine, Blackstone, Sandars, all were there,        And Hallam's _Middle Ages_,      And Austin with his style so rare,        And Poste's enticing pages.        We started well: the little inn        Was deadly dull and quiet,      As dull as Mrs. Wood's _East Lynne_,        Or as the verse of Wyatt.        Without distraction thus we read        From nine until eleven,      Then rowed and sailed until we fed        On potted char at seven.        Two hours of work! We could devote        Next day to recreation,      Much illness springs, so doctors note,        From lack of relaxation.        Let him read law on summer days,        Who has a soul that grovels;      Better one tale of Thackeray's        Than all Justinian's novels.        At noon we went upon the lake,        We could not stand the slowness      Of our lone inn, so dined on steak        (They _called_ it steak) at Bowness.        We wrestled with the steak, when lo!        Rose Jack in such a hurry,      He saw a girl he used to know        In Suffolk or in Surrey.        What matter which? to think that she        Should lure him from his duty!      For Jack, I knew, would always be        A very slave to beauty.        And so it proved, alas! for Jack        Grew taciturn and thinner,      Was out all day alone, and back        Too often late for dinner.        What could I do? His walks and rows        All led to one conclusion;      I could not read; our work, heaven knows,        Was nothing but confusion.        Like Jack I went about alone,        Saw Wordsworth's writing-table,      And made the higher by a stone        The \"man\" upon Great Gable.        At last there came a sudden pause        To all his wanderings _solus_,      He learned what writers on the laws        Of Rome had meant by _dolus_.        The Suffolk (was it Surrey?) flirt        Without a pang threw over      Poor Jack and all his works like dirt,        And caught a richer lover.        We read one morning more to say        We had not been quite idle,      And then to end the arduous day        Enjoyed a swim in Rydal.        Next day the hundredweight of books        Was packed once more in cases,      We left the lakes and hills and brooks        And southward turned our faces.        Three months, and then the Oxford Schools;        Our unbelieving college      Saw better than ourselves what fools        Pretend sometimes to knowledge.        Curst questions! Jack did only one,        He gave as his opinion      That of the Roman jurists none        Had lived before Justinian.        I answered two, but all I did        Was lacking in discretion,      I reckoned guardianship amid        The _vitia_ of possession.        My second shot was wider still,        I held that _commodata_      Could not attest a praetor's will        Because of _culpa lata_.        We waited fruitlessly that night,        There came no blue _testamur_,[A]      Nor was Jack's heavy heart made light        By that sweet word _Amamur_.    [A] Since the above was written, the _testamur_, like many other  institutions dear to the old order of Oxford men, has been superseded.          A Vision of Legal Shadows          A case at chambers left for my opinion        Had taxed my brain until the noon of night,      I read old law, and loathed the long dominion                      Of fiction over right.        I had consulted Coke and Cruise and Chitty,        The works where ancient learning reigns supreme,      Until exhausted nature, moved with pity,                      Sent me a bookman's dream.        Six figures, all gigantic as Gargantua,        Floated before my eyes, and all the six      Were shades like those that once the bard of Mantua                      Saw by the shore of Styx.        The first was one with countenance imperious,        His toga dim with centuries of dust;      \"My name,\" quoth he, \"is Aulus and Agerius,[B]                      My voice is hoarse with rust.        \"Yet once I played my part in law proceedings,        And writers wrote of one they never saw,      I gave their point to formulae and pleadings,                      I lived but in the law.\"        The second had a countenance perfidious;        What wonder? Praetors launched their formulae      In vain against Numerius Negidius,                      And not a whit cared he.        With voice of high contempt he greeted Aulus;        \"In interdicts thou wast mine enemy,      Once passed no day that students did not call us                      As parties, me and thee.        \"On paper I was plaintiff or defendant,        On paper thou wast evermore the same;      We lived apart, a life that was transcendant,                      For it was but a name.        \"I hate thee, Aulus, hate thee,\" low he muttered,        \"It was by thee that I was always tricked,      My unsubstantial bread I ate unbuttered                      In dread of interdict.        \"And yet 'twas but the sentiment I hated:        Like thee I ne'er was drunk e'en _vi_ or _clam_,[C]      With wine that was no wine my thirst was sated.                      Like thee I was a sham.\"        Two country hinds in 'broidered smocks next followed,        Each trundled him a cart-wheel by the spokes,      Oblivion now their names hath well-nigh swallowed,                      For they were Stiles and Nokes.        They spake no word, for speech to them was grievous,        With bovine eyes they supplicated me;      \"We wot not what ye will, but prithee leave us,                      Unlettered folk are we.\"        \"Go,\" said I, \"simple ones, and break your fallows,        Crush autumn apples in the cider press,      Law, gaffer Stiles, thy humble name still hallows,                      Contracted to J. S.\"        Another pair of later time succeeded,        With buckles on their shoes and silken hose,      A garb that told it was to them who heeded                      John Doe's and Richard Roe's.        \"Ah me! I was a casual ejector,[D]        In the brave days of old,\" I heard one say;      \"I knew Elizabeth, the Lord Protector                      I spake with yesterday.\"        To whom in contradiction snarled the other,        \"There was no living blood our veins to fill.      Both you and I were nought but shadows, brother,                      And we are shadows still.\"        Room for a lady, room, as at Megiddo        The hosts made way for passage of the king,      For from the darkness crept there forth a widow                      In weeds and wedding ring.        \"I am the widow, I, whereof the singers        Of Scotland sang, their cruel words so smote      My tender heart, that ofttimes itched my fingers                      To take them by the throat.        \"He scoffed at me, dour bachelor of Glasgow,[E]        If I existed not for him, the knave,      'Twas all his fault who let some bonnie lass go                      Unwedded to her grave.\"    [B] Aulus Agerius and Numerius Negidius are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25282"],[0,"The Jewish State (#1)"],[1,"*       *       *       *       *        +-----------------------------------------------------------+      | Transcriber's Note:                                       |      |                                                           |      | Inconsistent hyphenation and spelling in the original     |      | document have been preserved.                             |      |                                                           |      | Obvious typographical errors have been corrected.

In 1882, Leo Pinsker, a Jewish physician of Odessa, disturbed by the  pogroms of 1881, made a keen analysis of the position of the Jews,  declared that anti-Semitism was a psychosis and incurable, that the  cause of it was the abnormal condition of Jewish life, and that the  only remedy for it was the removal of the cause through self-help and  self-liberation. The Jewish people must become an independent nation,  settled on the soil of their own land and leading the life of a normal  people. Moses Hess in his \"Rome and Jerusalem\" classified the Jewish  question as one of the nationalist struggles inspired by the French  Revolution. Perez Smolenskin and E. Ben-Yehuda urged the revival of  Hebrew and the resettlement of Palestine as the foundation for the  rebirth of the Jewish people. Herzl was unaware of the existence of  these works. His eyes were not directed to the problem in the same  manner. When he wrote \"The Jewish State\" he was a journalist, living  in Paris, sending his letters to the leading newspaper of Vienna, the  _Neue Freie Presse_, and writing on a great variety of subjects. He  was led to see Jewish life as a phenomenon in a changing world. He had  adapted himself to a worldly outlook on all life. Through his efforts,  the Jewish problem was raised to the higher level of an international  question which, in his judgment, should be given consideration by  enlightened statesmanship. He was inspired to give his pamphlet a  title that arrested attention.           *       *       *       *       *    He wrote \"The Jewish State\" in a mood of restless agitation. His ideas  were thrown pell-mell into the white heat of a spontaneous revelation.  What was revealed dazzled and blinded him. Alex Bein, in his excellent  biography, gives an intriguing description, drawn from Herzl's  \"Diaries,\" of how \"The Jewish State\" was born. It was the revelation  of a mystic vision with flashes and overtones of prophecy. This is  what Bein says:        \"Then suddenly the storm breaks upon him. The clouds open. The      thunder rolls. The lightning flashes about him. A thousand      impressions beat upon him at the same time--a gigantic vision.      He cannot think; he is unable to move; he can only write;      breathless, unreflecting, unable to control himself or to      exercise his critical faculties lest he dam the eruption, he      dashes down his thoughts on scraps of paper--walking, standing,      lying down, on the street, at the table, in the night--as if      under unceasing command. So furiously did the cataract of his      thoughts rush through him, that he thought he was going out of      his mind. He was not working out the idea. The idea was working      him out. It would have been an hallucination had it not been so      informed by reason from first to last.\"    Not only did the Magic Title evoke a widespread interest among the  intellectuals of the day, but it brought Jews out of the ghettos and  made them conscious of their origin and destiny. It made them feel  that there was a world that might be won for their cause, hitherto  never communicated to strangers. Through Herzl, Jews were taught not  to fear the consequences of an international movement to demand their  national freedom. Thereafter, with freedom, they were to speak of a  Zionist Congress, of national funds, of national schools, of a flag  and a national anthem, and the redemption of their land. Their spirits  were liberated and in thought they no longer lived in ghettos. Herzl  taught them not to hide in corners. At the First Congress he said, \"We  have nothing to do with conspiracy, secret intervention or indirect  methods. We wish to put the question in the arena and under the  control of free public opinion.\" The Jews were to be active factors in  their emancipation and, if they wished it, what was described in \"The  Jewish State\" would not be a dream but a reality.           *       *       *       *       *    The beginnings of the Jewish renaissance preceded the appearance of  \"The Jewish State\" by several decades. In every section of Russian  Jewry and extending to wherever the Jews clung to their Hebraic  heritage, there was an active Zionist life. The reborn Hebrew was  becoming an all-pervading influence. There were scores of Hebrew  schools and academies. Hebrew journals of superior quality had a wide  circulation. Ever since the pogroms of 1881, the ideas of Pinsker and  Smolenskin and Gordon were discussed with great interest and deep  understanding. There were many Zionist societies in Russia, in Poland,  in Rumania, in Galicia and even in the United States. In \"The Jewish  State\" Herzl alludes to the language of The Jewish State and passes  Hebrew by as a manifestation of no great significance. He has a poorer  opinion of Yiddish, the common language of Jews, which he regards as  \"the furtive language of prisoners.\" This was obviously an oversight.  With the advent of Herzl, however, Zionism was no more a matter of  domestic concern only. It was no longer internal Jewish problem only,  not a theme for discussion only at Zionist meetings, not a problem to  heat the spirits of Jewish writers. The problem of Jewish exile now  occupied a place on the agenda of international affairs.           *       *       *       *       *    Herzl was not so distant from his people as many of the Russian  Zionists at first surmised. He was familiar with the social  anti-Semitism of Austria and Germany. He knew of the disabilities of  the Jews in Russia. There are many references in his feuilletons to  matters of Jewish interest. He had read an anti-Semitic book written  by Eugen Duehring called \"The Jewish Problem as a Problem of Race,  Morals and Culture.\" One of his closest friends had gone to Brazil for  a Jewish committee to investigate the possibility of settling Jews in  that part of South America. In 1892 he wrote an article on French  anti-Semitism in which he considered the solution of a return to Zion  and seemed to reject it. He wrote \"The New Ghetto\" two years before  \"The Jewish State\" appeared. He was present at the trial of Alfred  Dreyfus in December, 1894. He witnessed the degradation of Dreyfus and  heard the cries of \"Down with the Jews\" in the streets of Paris. He  read Edouard Drumont's anti-Semitic journal \"La France Juive\" and  said, \"I have to thank Drumont for much of the freedom "]]]
