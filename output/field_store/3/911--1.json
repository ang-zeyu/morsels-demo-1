Welsh is curator, Growth of the United       States, in the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of History and       Technology._    In 1918, PROFESSOR W.M.F. PETRIE concluded a brief article on \"History  in Tools\" with a reminder that the history of this subject \"has yet to  be studied,\" and lamented the survival of so few precisely dated  specimens. What Petrie found so discouraging in studying the implements  of the ancient world has consistently plagued those concerned with tools  of more recent vintage. Anonymity is the chief characteristic of hand  tools of the last three centuries. The reasons are many: first, the tool  is an object of daily use, subjected while in service to hard wear and,  in some cases, ultimate destruction; second, a tool's usefulness is apt  to continue through many years and through the hands of several  generations of craftsmen, with the result that its origins become lost;  third, the achievement of an implement of demonstrated proficiency  dictated against radical, and therefore easily datable, changes in shape  or style; and fourth, dated survivals needed to establish a range of  firm control specimens for the better identification of unknowns,  particularly the wooden elements of tools--handles, moldings, and plane  bodies--are frustratingly few in non-arid archaeological sites. When  tracing the provenance of American tools there is the additional problem  of heterogeneous origins and shapes--that is, what was the appearance  of a given tool prior to its standardization in England and the United  States? The answer requires a brief summary of the origin of selected  tool shapes, particularly those whose form was common to both the  British Isles and the Continent in the 17th century. Beyond this, when  did the shape of English tools begin to differ from the shape of tools  of the Continent? Finally, what tool forms predominated in American  usage and when, if in fact ever, did any of these tools achieve a  distinctly American character? In the process of framing answers to  these questions, one is confronted by a constantly diminishing  literature, coupled with a steadily increasing number of tool types.[1]    [Illustration: Figure 1.--1685: THE PRINCIPAL TOOLS that the carpenter  needed to frame a house, as listed by JOHANN AMOS COMENIUS in his _Orbis  Sensualium Pictus_ were the felling axe (4), wedge and beetle (7 and 8),  chip axe (10), saw (12), trestle (14), and pulley (15). (Charles Hoole  transl., London, 1685. _Courtesy of the Folger Shakespeare Library_.)]    [Illustration: Figure 2.--1685: THE BOXMAKER AND TURNER as pictured by  Comenius required planes (3 and 5), workbench (4), auger (6), knife (7),  and lathe (14). (From Johann Amos Comenius, _Orbis Sensualium Pictus.  Courtesy of the Folger Shakespeare Library_.)]    The literature of the subject, both new and old, is sparse, with  interest always centering upon the object shaped by the craftsman's tool  rather than upon the tool itself. Henry Mercer's _Ancient Carpenters'  Tools_, first published in 1929, is an exception. It remains a rich  source of information based primarily on the marvelous collections  preserved by the Bucks County Historical Society. Since 1933, the Early  American Industries Association, both through collecting and through its  _Chronicle_, has called attention to the vanishing trades, their tools  and techniques; the magazine _Antiques_ has occasionally dealt with this  subject. Historians of economic and industrial development usually  neglect the tools of the woodcrafts, and when considering the  toolmakers, they have reference only to the inventors and producers of  machine tools. The dearth of written material is somewhat compensated  for by the collections of hand tools in American museums and  restorations, notably those at Williamsburg, Cooperstown, Old Sturbridge  Village, Winterthur, the Henry Ford Museum, and Shelburne; at the latter  in particular the extensive collection has been bolstered by Frank H.  Wildung's museum pamphlet, \"Woodworking Tools at Shelburne Museum.\"  The most informative recent American work on the subject is Eric  Sloane's handsomely illustrated _A Museum of Early American Tools_,  published in 1964. Going beyond just the tools of the woodworker,  Sloane's book also includes agricultural implements. It is a delightful  combination of appreciation of early design, nostalgia, and useful fact.    [Illustration: Figure 3.--1703: THE TOOLS OF THE JOINER illustrated by  Moxon are the workbench (A), fore plane (B. 1), jointer (B. 2),  strike-block (B. 3), smoothing plane (B. 4 and B. 7), rabbet plane (B.  5), plow (B. 6), forming chisels (C. 1 and C. 3), paring chisel (C. 2),  skew former (C. 4), mortising chisel (sec. C. 5), gouge (C. 6), square  (D), bevel (F), gauge (G), brace and bit (H), gimlet (I), auger (K),  hatchet (L), pit saw (M), whipsaw (N), frame saw (O), saw set (Q),  handsaw (unmarked), and compass saw (E). (Joseph Moxon, _Mechanick  Exercises_ ..., 3rd ed., London, 1703.

(Moxon,  _Mechanick Exercises_ ..., 1703. Library of Congress.)]    Charles Hummel's forthcoming _With Hammer in Hand: The Dominy Craftsmen  of East Hampton_--to be published by the Yale University Press--will be  a major contribution to the literature dealing with Anglo-American  woodworking tools. Hummel's book will place in perspective Winterthur  Museum's uniquely documented Dominy Woodshop Collection. This extensive  collection of tools--over a thousand in number--is rich in attributed  and dated examples which range from the early 18th through the mid-19th  century. The literature of the subject has been greatly enhanced by the  English writer, W.L. Goodman. Extending a series of articles that first  appeared in the _Journal of The Institute of Handicraft Teachers_,  Goodman has put together a well-researched _History of Woodworking  Tools_ (London, 1964), one particularly useful for its wealth of  illustration from antiquity and the Middle Ages.      Specialization    Given the limitations of precise dating, uncertain provenance, and an  uneven literature, what can be learned about woodworking tools after  1600? In some instances, design change can be noted and documented to  provide at least a general criteria for dating. Frequently, the original  appearance of tools can be documented. For some hand tools,  characteristics can be established that denote a national origin. Not  infrequently a tool's style, decorative motif, or similarity to other  objects that coexisted at a given time can suggest, even in relatively  modern times, the values of the society that produced it. The source of  such information derived from the hand tool is generally visual,  recorded in the tool itself or in pictures of it and supported by  manuscript and printed material.    Survey the principal printed sources of the 17th, 18th, and 19th  centuries. The first thing that is apparent is a remarkable  proliferation of tool types without any significant change in the  definition and description of the carpenter's or joiner's task. Begin in  1685 with Charles Hoole's translation of Johann Amos Comenius' _Orbis  Sensualium Pictus_ for use as a Latin grammar. Among the occupations  chosen to illustrate vocabulary and usage were the carpenter (fig. 1),  the boxmaker (cabinetmaker), and the turner (fig. 2). \"The Carpenter,\"  according to Hoole's text, \"squareth Timber with a Chip ax ... and  saweth it with a Saw\" while the more specialized \"Box-maker, smootheth  hewen-Boards with a Plain upon a Work-board, he maketh them very smooth  with a little plain, he boarth them thorow with an Augre, carveth them  with a Knife, fasteneth them together with Glew, and Cramp-irons, and  maketh Tables, Boards, Chests &c.\" Hoole repeated Comenius' plates with  the result that the craftsman's tools and his work have the same  characteristic medieval flavor as the text.[2]    Joseph Moxon in his well-quoted work on the mechanic arts defined  joinery as \"an Art Manual, whereby several Pieces of Wood are so fitted  and join'd together by Straight-line, Squares, Miters or any Bevel, that  they shall seem one intire Piece.\" Including the workbench, Moxon  described and illustrated 30 tools (fig. 3) needed by the joiner. The  carpenter's tools were less favored by illustration; only 13 were  pictured (fig. 4). The tools that the carpenter used were the same as  those of the joiner except that the carpenter's tools were structurally  stronger.

At least a man must make a double effort of moral humility and  imaginative energy to prevent it from narrowing his mind. Indeed there  is something touching and even tragic about the thought of the  thoughtless tourist, who might have stayed at home loving Laplanders,  embracing Chinamen, and clasping Patagonians to his heart in Hampstead  or Surbiton, but for his blind and suicidal impulse to go and see what  they looked like. This is not meant for nonsense; still less is it meant  for the silliest sort of nonsense, which is cynicism. The human bond  that he feels at home is not an illusion. On the contrary, it is rather  an inner reality. Man is inside all men. In a real sense any man may be  inside any men. But to travel is to leave the inside and draw  dangerously near the outside. So long as he thought of men in the  abstract, like naked toiling figures in some classic frieze, merely as  those who labour and love their children and die, he was thinking the  fundamental truth about them. By going to look at their unfamiliar  manners and customs he is inviting them to disguise themselves in  fantastic masks and costumes. Many modern internationalists talk as if  men of different nationalities had only to meet and mix and understand  each other. In reality that is the moment of supreme danger--the moment  when they meet. We might shiver, as at the old euphemism by which a  meeting meant a duel.    Travel ought to combine amusement with instruction; but most travellers  are so much amused that they refuse to be instructed. I do not blame  them for being amused; it is perfectly natural to be amused at a  Dutchman for being Dutch or a Chinaman for being Chinese. Where they are  wrong is that they take their own amusement seriously. They base on it  their serious ideas of international instruction. It was said that the  Englishman takes his pleasures sadly; and the pleasure of despising  foreigners is one which he takes most sadly of all. He comes to scoff  and does not remain to pray, but rather to excommunicate. Hence in  international relations there is far too little laughing, and far too  much sneering. But I believe that there is a better way which largely  consists of laughter; a form of friendship between nations which is  actually founded on differences. To hint at some such better way is the  only excuse of this book.    Let me begin my American impressions with two impressions I had before I  went to America. One was an incident and the other an idea; and when  taken together they illustrate the attitude I mean. The first principle  is that nobody should be ashamed of thinking a thing funny because it is  foreign; the second is that he should be ashamed of thinking it wrong  because it is funny. The reaction of his senses and superficial habits  of mind against something new, and to him abnormal, is a perfectly  healthy reaction. But the mind which imagines that mere unfamiliarity  can possibly prove anything about inferiority is a very inadequate mind.  It is inadequate even in criticising things that may really be inferior  to the things involved here. It is far better to laugh at a negro for  having a black face than to sneer at him for having a sloping skull. It  is proportionally even more preferable to laugh rather than judge in  dealing with highly civilised peoples. Therefore I put at the beginning  two working examples of what I felt about America before I saw it; the  sort of thing that a man has a right to enjoy as a joke, and the sort of  thing he has a duty to understand and respect, because it is the  explanation of the joke.    When I went to the American consulate to regularise my passports, I was  capable of expecting the American consulate to be American. Embassies  and consulates are by tradition like islands of the soil for which they  stand; and I have often found the tradition corresponding to a truth. I  have seen the unmistakable French official living on omelettes and a  little wine and serving his sacred abstractions under the last  palm-trees fringing a desert. In the heat and noise of quarrelling Turks  and Egyptians, I have come suddenly, as with the cool shock of his own  shower-bath, on the listless amiability of the English gentleman. The  officials I interviewed were very American, especially in being very  polite; for whatever may have been the mood or meaning of Martin  Chuzzlewit, I have always found Americans by far the politest people in  the world. They put in my hands a form to be filled up, to all  appearance like other forms I had filled up in other passport offices.  But in reality it was very different from any form I had ever filled up  in my life. At least it was a little like a freer form of the game  called 'Confessions' which my friends and I invented in our youth; an  examination paper containing questions like, 'If you saw a rhinoceros  in the front garden, what would you do?' One of my friends, I remember,  wrote, 'Take the pledge.' But that is another story, and might bring Mr.  Pussyfoot Johnson on the scene before his time.    One of the questions on the paper was, 'Are you an anarchist?' To which  a detached philosopher would naturally feel inclined to answer, 'What  the devil has that to do with you? Are you an atheist?' along with some  playful efforts to cross-examine the official about what constitutes an  [Greek: arche]. Then there was the question, 'Are you in favour of  subverting the government of the United States by force?' Against this I  should write, 'I prefer to answer that question at the end of my tour  and not the beginning.' The inquisitor, in his more than morbid  curiosity, had then written down, 'Are you a polygamist?' The answer to  this is, 'No such luck' or 'Not such a fool,' according to our  experience of the other sex. But perhaps a better answer would be that  given to W. T. Stead when he circulated the rhetorical question, 'Shall  I slay my brother Boer?'--the answer that ran, 'Never interfere in  family matters.' But among many things that amused me almost to the  point of treating the form thus disrespectfully, the most amusing was  the thought of the ruthless outlaw who should feel compelled to treat it  respectfully. I like to think of the foreign desperado, seeking to slip  into America with official papers under official protection, and sitting  down to write with a beautiful gravity, 'I am an anarchist. I hate you  all and wish to destroy you.' Or, 'I intend to subvert by force the  government of the United States as soon as possible, sticking the long  sheath-knife in my left trouser-pocket into Mr. Harding at the earliest  opportunity.' Or again, 'Yes, I am a polygamist all right, and my  forty-seven wives are accompanying me on the voyage disguised as  secretaries.' There seems to be a certain simplicity of mind about these  answers; and it is reassuring to know that anarchists and polygamists  are so pure and good that the police have only to ask them questions and  they are certain to tell no lies.    Now that is a model of the sort of foreign practice, founded on foreign  problems, at which a man's first impulse is naturally to laugh. Nor have  I any intention of apologising for my laughter. A man is perfectly  entitled to laugh at a thing because he happens to find it  incomprehensible. What he has no right to do is to laugh at it as  incomprehensible, and then criticise it as if he comprehended it. The  very fact of its unfamiliarity and mystery ought to set him thinking  about the deeper causes that make people so different from himself, and  that without merely assuming that they must be inferior to himself.    Superficially this is rather a queer business. It would be easy enough  to suggest that in this America has introduced a quite abnormal spirit  of inquisition; an interference with liberty unknown among all the  ancient despotisms and aristocracies. About that there will be something  to be said later; but superficially it is true that this degree of  officialism is comparatively unique. In a journey which I took only the  year before I had occasion to have my papers passed by governments which  many worthy people in the West would vaguely identify with corsairs and  assassins; I have stood on the other side of Jordan, in the land ruled  by a rude Arab chief, where the police looked so like brigands that one  wondered what the brigands looked like. But they did not ask me whether  I had come to subvert the power of the Shereef; and they did not exhibit  the faintest curiosity about my personal views on the ethical basis of  civil authority.
