Cave, Naturalist and Dealer in Antiquities,\" was inscribed. The  contents of its window were curiously variegated. They comprised some  elephant tusks and an imperfect set of chessmen, beads and weapons, a  box of eyes, two skulls of tigers and one human, several moth-eaten  stuffed monkeys (one holding a lamp), an old-fashioned cabinet, a  flyblown ostrich egg or so, some fishing-tackle, and an extraordinarily  dirty, empty glass fish-tank. There was also, at the moment the story  begins, a mass of crystal, worked into the shape of an egg and  brilliantly polished. And at that two people, who stood outside the  window, were looking, one of them a tall, thin clergyman, the other a  black-bearded young man of dusky complexion and unobtrusive costume. The  dusky young man spoke with eager gesticulation, and seemed anxious for  his companion to purchase the article.    While they were there, Mr. Cave came into his shop, his beard still  wagging with the bread and butter of his tea. When he saw these men and  the object of their regard, his countenance fell. He glanced guiltily  over his shoulder, and softly shut the door. He was a little old man,  with pale face and peculiar watery blue eyes; his hair was a dirty grey,  and he wore a shabby blue frock coat, an ancient silk hat, and carpet  slippers very much down at heel. He remained watching the two men as  they talked. The clergyman went deep into his trouser pocket, examined a  handful of money, and showed his teeth in an agreeable smile. Mr. Cave  seemed still more depressed when they came into the shop.    The clergyman, without any ceremony, asked the price of the crystal egg.  Mr. Cave glanced nervously towards the door leading into the parlour,  and said five pounds. The clergyman protested that the price was high,  to his companion as well as to Mr. Cave--it was, indeed, very much more  than Mr. Cave had intended to ask, when he had stocked the article--and  an attempt at bargaining ensued. Mr. Cave stepped to the shop-door, and  held it open. \"Five pounds is my price,\" he said, as though he wished  to save himself the trouble of unprofitable discussion. As he did so,  the upper portion of a woman's face appeared above the blind in the  glass upper panel of the door leading into the parlour, and stared  curiously at the two customers. \"Five pounds is my price,\" said Mr.  Cave, with a quiver in his voice.    The swarthy young man had so far remained a spectator, watching Cave  keenly. Now he spoke. \"Give him five pounds,\" he said. The clergyman  glanced at him to see if he were in earnest, and, when he looked at Mr.  Cave again, he saw that the latter's face was white. \"It's a lot of  money,\" said the clergyman, and, diving into his pocket, began counting  his resources. He had little more than thirty shillings, and he appealed  to his companion, with whom he seemed to be on terms of considerable  intimacy. This gave Mr. Cave an opportunity of collecting his thoughts,  and he began to explain in an agitated manner that the crystal was not,  as a matter of fact, entirely free for sale. His two customers were  naturally surprised at this, and inquired why he had not thought of that  before he began to bargain. Mr. Cave became confused, but he stuck to  his story, that the crystal was not in the market that afternoon, that  a probable purchaser of it had already appeared. The two, treating this  as an attempt to raise the price still further, made as if they would  leave the shop. But at this point the parlour door opened, and the owner  of the dark fringe and the little eyes appeared.    She was a coarse-featured, corpulent woman, younger and very much larger  than Mr. Cave; she walked heavily, and her face was flushed. \"That  crystal _is_ for sale,\" she said. \"And five pounds is a good enough  price for it. I can't think what you're about, Cave, not to take the  gentleman's offer!\"    Mr. Cave, greatly perturbed by the irruption, looked angrily at her over  the rims of his spectacles, and, without excessive assurance, asserted  his right to manage his business in his own way. An altercation began.  The two customers watched the scene with interest and some amusement,  occasionally assisting Mrs. Cave with suggestions. Mr. Cave, hard  driven, persisted in a confused and impossible story of an enquiry for  the crystal that morning, and his agitation became painful. But he stuck  to his point with extraordinary persistence. It was the young Oriental  who ended this curious controversy. He proposed that they should call  again in the course of two days--so as to give the alleged enquirer a  fair chance. \"And then we must insist,\" said the clergyman, \"Five  pounds.\" Mrs. Cave took it on herself to apologise for her husband,  explaining that he was sometimes \"a little odd,\" and as the two  customers left, the couple prepared for a free discussion of the  incident in all its bearings.    Mrs. Cave talked to her husband with singular directness. The poor  little man, quivering with emotion, muddled himself between his stories,  maintaining on the one hand that he had another customer in view, and on  the other asserting that the crystal was honestly worth ten guineas.  \"Why did you ask five pounds?\" said his wife. \"_Do_ let me manage my  business my own way!\" said Mr. Cave.    Mr. Cave had living with him a step-daughter and a step-son, and at  supper that night the transaction was re-discussed. None of them had a  high opinion of Mr. Cave's business methods, and this action seemed a  culminating folly.    \"It's my opinion he's refused that crystal before,\" said the step-son, a  loose-limbed lout of eighteen.    \"But _Five Pounds_!\" said the step-daughter, an argumentative young  woman of six-and-twenty.    Mr. Cave's answers were wretched; he could only mumble weak assertions  that he knew his own business best. They drove him from his half-eaten  supper into the shop, to close it for the night, his ears aflame and  tears of vexation behind his spectacles. \"Why had he left the crystal in  the window so long? The folly of it!\" That was the trouble closest in  his mind. For a time he could see no way of evading sale.    After supper his step-daughter and step-son smartened themselves up and  went out and his wife retired upstairs to reflect upon the business  aspects of the crystal, over a little sugar and lemon and so forth in  hot water. Mr. Cave went into the shop, and stayed there until late,  ostensibly to make ornamental rockeries for goldfish cases but really  for a private purpose that will be better explained later. The next day  Mrs. Cave found that the crystal had been removed from the window, and  was lying behind some second-hand books on angling. She replaced it in a  conspicuous position. But she did not argue further about it, as a  nervous headache disinclined her from debate. Mr. Cave was always  disinclined. The day passed disagreeably. Mr. Cave was, if anything,  more absent-minded than usual, and uncommonly irritable withal. In the  afternoon, when his wife was taking her customary sleep, he removed the  crystal from the window again.    The next day Mr. Cave had to deliver a consignment of dog-fish at one of  the hospital schools, where they were needed for dissection. In his  absence Mrs. Cave's mind reverted to the topic of the crystal, and the  methods of expenditure suitable to a windfall of five pounds. She had  already devised some very agreeable expedients, among others a dress of  green silk for herself and a trip to Richmond, when a jangling of the  front door bell summoned her into the shop. The customer was an  examination coach who came to complain of the non-delivery of certain  frogs asked for the previous day. Mrs. Cave did not approve of this  particular branch of Mr. Cave's business, and the gentleman, who had  called in a somewhat aggressive mood, retired after a brief exchange of  words--entirely civil so far as he was concerned. Mrs. Cave's eye then  naturally turned to the window; for the sight of the crystal was an  assurance of the five pounds and of her dreams. What was her surprise to  find it gone!    She went to the place behind the locker on the counter, where she had  discovered it the day before. It was not there; and she immediately  began an eager search about the shop.    When Mr. Cave returned from his business with the dog-fish, about a  quarter to two in the afternoon, he found the shop in some confusion,  and his wife, extremely exasperated and on her knees behind the counter,  routing among his taxidermic material. Her face came up hot and angry  over the counter, as the jangling bell announced his return, and she  forthwith accused him of \"hiding it.\"    \"Hid _what_?\" asked Mr. Cave.    \"The crystal!\"    At that Mr. Cave, apparently much surprised,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27378"],[0,"The Story of the Heavens (#1)"],[1,"and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  http://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from images  generously made available by The Internet Archive/American  Libraries.)
