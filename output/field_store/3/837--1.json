NORWAY          CHAPTER I    THE LAND OF THE VIKINGS      Who has not heard of the Vikings--the dauntless sea-rovers, who in the  days of long ago were the dread of Northern Europe? We English should  know something of them, for Viking blood flowed in the veins of many  of our ancestors. And these fierce fighting men came in their ships  across the North Sea from Norway on more than one occasion to invade  England. But they came once too often, and were thoroughly defeated at  the Battle of Stamford Bridge, when, as will be remembered, Harald the  Hard, King of Norway, was killed in attempting to turn his namesake,  King Harold of England, off his throne.    Norwegian historians, however, do not say very much about this  particular invasion. They prefer to dwell on the great deeds of  another King Harald, who was called \"Fairhair,\" and who began his  reign some two hundred years earlier. This Harald was only a boy  of ten years of age when he came to the throne, but he determined  to increase the size of his kingdom, which was then but a small one,  so he trained his men to fight, built grand new ships, and then began  his conquests. Norway was at that time divided up into a number of  districts or small kingdoms, each of which was ruled over by an Earl  or petty King, and it was these rulers whom Harald set to work to  subdue. He intended to make one united kingdom of all Norway, and  he eventually succeeded in doing so. But he had many a hard fight;  and if the Sagas, as the historical records of the North are called,  speak truly, he fought almost continuously during twelve long years  before he had accomplished his task, and even then he was only just  twenty-one years of age.    They say that he did all these wonderful things because a girl, named  Gyda, whom he wanted to marry, refused to have anything to say to him  until he had made himself King of a really big kingdom. He made a vow  that he would not comb or cut his hair until he had conquered the whole  country. He led his men to victory after victory, and at length fought  his last great battle at Hafrsfjord (to the south of Stavanger). The  sea-fight was desperate and long, but Harald's fleet succeeded in  overpowering that of the enemy, and Sulki, King of Rogaland, as well  as Erik, King of Hardanger, were slain. Then Harald cut and dressed  his hair, the skalds composed poems in honour of the event, and for  ever after he was known as Fairhair. He was truly a great Viking,  and he did not rest content with the conquest of Norway alone; for  he brought his ships across the North Sea and conquered the Isle of  Man, the Hebrides, the Shetlands, and the Orkneys, and he lived to  the age of eighty-three.    Then there are the stories of the two Olafs--Olaf Tryggvasson and  Olaf the Saint, each of whom took part in many a fight on British  soil, each of whom was the champion of Christianity in Norway  and fought his way to the throne, and each of whom fell in battle  under heroic circumstances, the one at Svold (A.D. 1000), the other  at Sticklestad (A.D. 1030). To us it is interesting to know that  King Olaf Tryggvasson, on one of his early Viking expeditions, was  baptized in the Scilly Isles, that as his second wife he married an  Irish Princess, and that for some time he lived in Dublin. To the  Norwegians he is a Norse hero of the greatest renown, who during his  short reign of barely five years never ceased to force Christianity  on the heathen population, and who, at the age of thirty-one, came to  an untimely end. His fleet was ambuscaded and surrounded, and when  his men had made their last stand he refused to surrender. Neither  would he suffer the ignominy of capture or death at the hands of  his enemies; so, with shield and sword in hand, and in full armour,  he leaped overboard, and immediately sank. For years afterwards his  faithful people believed that he would appear again, and many fancied  that, on occasions, their hero's spirit visited them.    Everyone knows the old triumphant line, \"London Bridge is broken  down,\" yet few are aware that the words are translated from an old  Norse song, and fewer still could say who broke down the bridge. The  story goes that this was accomplished by the other Olaf, afterwards  known as St. Olaf. He and his Vikings had allied themselves with  Etheldred the Unready against the Danes, who held the Thames above  London Bridge. The bridge itself, which in those days was a rough  wooden structure, was densely packed with armed men, prepared to  resist the advance of the combined fleets. But Olaf drove his stout  ships against it, made them fast to the piers, hoisted all his sail  and got out his oars, and succeeded in upsetting the bridge into  the river, thus securing victory for Etheldred. But that was before  Olaf gained the throne of Norway. What he did as King of that country  would take too long to tell here. Every district of Norway possesses  legends bearing on his visits when engaged in converting the people to  Christianity, and describing his powers of working miracles. Everywhere  the name of St. Olaf still remains engraven on the country. His death,  however, was that of a soldier--on the battle-field; and the lance  which Norway's patron saint carried in his last fight may even now  be seen by the altar in Trondhjem Cathedral.    It was St. Olaf's half-brother, Harald the Hard, who fell, as we have  said, at Stamford Bridge, when attempting the invasion of England in  1066. But all this is history nearly a thousand years old, and the  stirring tales of the Vikings are fully recorded, and may be read  in the Sagas. Ten centuries have changed the order of things. To-day  we have, in our turn, become the invaders, albeit full of peace and  good-will; and over the same seas upon which once danced Long Ship,  Serpent, and Dragon, our great ugly, smoky steamers now plough  their way.            CHAPTER II    MODERN NORWAY      \"Norroway over the Foam,\" as it used to be called, is a good land to  go to and a beautiful land to look upon. It lies less than two days'  journey from our shores, so it is easy enough to reach. Away from  the towns--and they are not many--everything is picturesque, grand,  and majestic, and the country indeed looks (as the people firmly  believed of it long ago) as if it might have been the playground  of countless giants, who amused themselves by pulling up acres of  land, letting the sea into the valleys, and pelting each other with  mountains and islands. Thank goodness the giants have disappeared! But  if they really did have a hand in fashioning Norway, they are to be  congratulated on the result.    One of the first things one likes to know about a foreign country is  its size. Well, Norway is just a little larger than the British Isles,  and that part of it which forms the usual holiday touring ground of  British and other people--_i.e._, from Trondhjem to the south--is no  larger than England. The remainder of the country consists of a long,  narrow strip running up into the Arctic Circle, and ending in Lapland  in the Far North.    On three sides Norway is washed by the sea; on the other side she  has two neighbours--Sweden from the south right away up to Lapland,  and then Russia.    Now let us see what sort of a land it is. First, there are the fjords,  stretching often a hundred miles or more inland from the sea-coast,  sometimes with delightful fertile shores, at other times hemmed in on  either hand by rocky cliffs rising two or three thousand feet"]]]
