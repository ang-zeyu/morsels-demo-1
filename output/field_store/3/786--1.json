These selections  have been made as a result of more than twenty-five years of observation  and study. The text is that of the Bible itself, but in the language of  the child, so that it may easily be read to the younger children and by  those who are older. It is not in words of one syllable, for while the  child is reading the Bible he should gradually learn the meaning of new  words and idioms.    The Bible contains the foundations on which the religious life of the  child must be built. The immortal stories and songs of the Old and New  Testaments are his richest inheritance from the past. To give him this  heritage in language and form that he can understand and enjoy is the  duty and privilege of his parents and teachers.    It is hoped that \"The Children's Bible\" will meet the need and the  demand, which parents and educators alike have long felt and often  expressed, for a simple translation of selections from the Bible most  suited to the needs and the interests of the child. It is also believed  that after the child has learned to appreciate and love these stories  and songs, he will be eager and able to read the Bible as a whole with  genuine interest and understanding.

Boughs of trees, after Titian                  84          PREFACE.      The following Lectures are printed, as far as possible, just as they  were delivered. Here and there a sentence which seemed obscure has been  mended, and the passages which had not been previously written, have  been, of course imperfectly, supplied from memory. But I am well assured  that nothing of any substantial importance which was said in the  lecture-room, is either omitted, or altered in its signification; with  the exception only of a few sentences struck out from the notice of the  works of Turner, in consequence of the impossibility of engraving the  drawings by which they were illustrated, except at a cost which would  have too much raised the price of the volume. Some elucidatory remarks  have, however, been added at the close of the second and fourth  Lectures, which I hope may be of more use than the passages which I was  obliged to omit.    The drawings by which the Lectures on Architecture were illustrated have  been carefully reduced, and well transferred to wood by Mr. Thurston  Thompson. Those which were given in the course of the notices of schools  of painting could not be so transferred, having been drawn in color; and  I have therefore merely had a few lines, absolutely necessary to make  the text intelligible, copied from engravings.    I forgot, in preparing the second Lecture for the press, to quote a  passage from Lord Lindsay's \"Christian Art,\" illustrative of what is  said in that lecture (Sec. 52), respecting the energy of the mediaeval  republics. This passage, describing the circumstances under which the  Campanile of the Duomo of Florence was built, is interesting also as  noticing the universality of talent which was required of architects;  and which, as I have asserted in the Addenda (Sec. 60), always ought to be  required of them. I do not, however, now regret the omission, as I  cannot easily imagine a better preface to an essay on civil architecture  than this simple statement.    \"In 1332, Giotto was chosen to erect it (the Campanile), on the ground,  avowedly, of the _universality_ of his talents, with the appointment of  Capo Maestro, or chief Architect (chief Master I should rather write),  of the Cathedral and its dependencies, a yearly salary of one hundred  gold florins, and the privilege of citizenship, under the special  understanding that he was not to quit Florence. His designs being  approved of, the republic passed a decree in the spring of 1334, that  the Campanile should be built so as to exceed in magnificence, height,  and excellence of workmanship whatever in that time had been achieved by  the Greeks and Romans in the time of their utmost power and greatness.  The first stone was laid, accordingly, with great pomp, on the 18th of  July following, and the work prosecuted with vigor, and with such  costliness and utter disregard of expense, that a citizen of Verona,  looking on, exclaimed that the republic was taxing her strength too far,  that the united resources of two great monarchs would be insufficient to  complete it; a criticism which the Signoria resented by confining him  for two months in prison, and afterwards conducting him through the  public treasury, to teach him that the Florentines could build their  whole city of marble, and not one poor steeple only, were they so  inclined.\"    I see that \"The Builder,\" vol. xi. page 690, has been endeavoring to  inspire the citizens of Leeds with some pride of this kind respecting  their town-hall. The pride would be well, but I sincerely trust that the  tower in question may not be built on the design there proposed. I am  sorry to have to write a special criticism, but it must be remembered  that the best works, by the best men living, are in this age abused  without mercy by nameless critics; and it would be unjust to the public,  if those who have given their names as guarantee for their sincerity  never had the courage to enter a protest against the execution of  designs which appear to them unworthy.    DENMARK HILL, _16th April 1854_.          LECTURES ON ARCHITECTURE AND PAINTING.          LECTURE I.    ARCHITECTURE.    _Delivered November 1, 1853._      1. I think myself peculiarly happy in being permitted to address the  citizens of Edinburgh on the subject of architecture, for it is one  which, they cannot but feel, interests them nearly. Of all the cities in  the British Islands, Edinburgh is the one which presents most advantages  for the display of a noble building; and which, on the other hand,  sustains most injury in the erection of a commonplace or unworthy one.  You are all proud of your city; surely you must feel it a duty in some  sort to justify your pride; that is to say, to give yourselves a _right_  to be proud of it. That you were born under the shadow of its two  fantastic mountains,--that you live where from your room windows you can  trace the shores of its glittering Firth, are no rightful subjects of  pride. You did not raise the mountains, nor shape the shores; and the  historical houses of your Canongate, and the broad battlements of your  castle, reflect honor upon you only through your ancestors. Before you  boast of your city, before even you venture to call it _yours_, ought  you not scrupulously to weigh the exact share you have had in adding to  it or adorning it, to calculate seriously the influence upon its aspect  which the work of your own hands has exercised? I do not say that, even  when you regard your city in this scrupulous and testing spirit, you  have not considerable ground for exultation. As far as I am acquainted  with modern architecture, I am aware of no streets which, in simplicity  and manliness of style, or general breadth and brightness of effect,  equal those of the New Town of Edinburgh. But yet I am well persuaded  that as you traverse those streets, your feelings of pleasure and pride  in them are much complicated with those which are excited entirely by  the surrounding scenery. As you walk up or down George Street, for  instance, do you not look eagerly for every opening to the north and  south, which lets in the luster of the Firth of Forth, or the rugged  outline of the Castle Rock? Take away the sea-waves, and the dark  basalt, and I fear you would find little to interest you in George  Street by itself. Now I remember a city, more nobly placed even than  your Edinburgh, which, instead of the valley that you have now filled by  lines of railroad, has a broad and rushing river of blue water sweeping  through the heart of it; which, for the dark and solitary rock that  bears your castle, has an amphitheater of cliffs crested with cypresses  and olive; which, for the two masses of Arthur's Seat and the ranges of  the Pentlands, has a chain of blue mountains higher than the haughtiest  peaks of your Highlands; and which, for your far-away Ben Ledi and Ben  More, has the great central chain of the St. Gothard Alps: and yet, as  you go out of the gates, and walk in the suburban streets of that  city--I mean Verona--the eye never seeks to rest on that external  scenery, however gorgeous; it does not look for the gaps between the  houses, as you do here; it may for a few moments follow the broken line  of the great Alpine battlements; but it is only where they form a  background for other battlements, built by the hand of man.
