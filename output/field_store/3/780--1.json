A cock was scratching one day in the earth under the wall of a cottage  when he found a bean.    [Illustration]    He tried to swallow it, and choked himself. He choked himself and  stretched himself out, and there he lay, and couldn't even breathe.    [Illustration]    And his mistress saw him, ran up to him, and asked: \"Mr. Cock, what  makes you lie there like that, so that you can't breathe?\"    [Illustration]    \"I've choked myself with a bean,\" he answered. \"Go and ask the cow for  some butter.\"    And his mistress came to the cow and said: \"Mrs. Cow, give me some  butter! My cock is lying there and can't even breathe, he has choked  himself with a bean.\"    [Illustration]    And the cow answered: \"Go and ask the hay-makers for some hay.\"    [Illustration]    And she came to the hay-makers and said: \"Hay-makers, give me some hay!  The hay's for the cow who will give me some butter, and the butter's for  my cock who is lying there and can't breathe, he's choked himself with a  bean.\" And the hay-makers answered: \"Go and ask the oven to give you  some loaves.\"    And she came to the oven and said: \"Oven, oven, give me some loaves! The  loaves are for the hay-makers, who will give me some hay, the hay's for  the cow, who will give me some butter, and the butter's for my cock who  is lying there and can't breathe, he's choked himself with a bean.\"    [Illustration]    And the oven answered: \"Go and ask the wood-cutters for some wood.\"    And she came to the wood cutters and said: \"Give me some wood! The  wood's for the oven, who will give me some loaves, the loaves are for  the hay-cutters, who will give me some hay, the hay's for the cow, who  will give me some butter, the butter's for my cock who is lying there  and can't breathe, he's choked himself with a bean.\"    [Illustration]    And they answered: \"Go and ask the smith for an axe, we've nothing to  cut the wood with.\"    [Illustration]    So she came to the smith and said: \"Smith, smith, give me an axe! The  axe is for the wood-cutters, who will give me some wood, the wood's for  the oven, who will give me some loaves, the loaves are for the  hay-makers, who will give me some hay, the hay's for the cow, who will  give me some butter, and the butter's for my cock who is lying there and  can't breathe, he's choked himself with a bean.\" And he answered: \"Go  into the forest and burn me some charcoal.\"    [Illustration]    So she went into the forest, gathered a bundle of sticks, and burned  some charcoal. Then she took the charcoal to the smith, and he gave her  an axe. She went with the axe to the wood-cutters, and the wood-cutters  gave her some wood. The wood she took to the oven, and the oven gave her  some loaves.    [Illustration]    She took the loaves to the hay-makers, and the hay-makers gave her some  hay. The hay she took to the cow, who gave her some butter. She brought  the butter to the cock, and the cock gulped it down and swallowed the  bean.    [Illustration]    Then he jumped up merrily and started singing \"Cock-a-doodle-doo! I was  sitting under the wall, plaiting shoes, when I lost my awl, but I found  a little coin, and I bought a little scarf, and gave it to a pretty  girl.\"    [Illustration]    And that's all about it.          THE GOAT AND THE RAM.      Once upon a time there lived a man and his wife, and they had a goat and  a ram.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    And one day the man said to his wife: \"Look here, let's get rid of the  ram and the goat; why, they only keep eating our corn, and don't help to  feed us at all!\"    So he told them: \"Be off, goat and ram, and don't dare to show  yourselves at my gate ever again.\"    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    So the goat and the ram made themselves a bag, and went off. And they  went on and on, when suddenly they saw a wolf's head lying in the middle  of the field.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    And they picked up the head, put it in their bag, and went on again. And  they went on and on, when suddenly they saw a fire burning, and they  said: \"Let's go and spend the night there, lest the wolves should eat  us.\" But when they got there, lo and behold! it was the wolves  themselves who were cooking their porridge, and so they said: \"Good  evening, young fellows, and good appetite to you!\" And the wolves  answered: \"Good evening, Mr. Goat and Mr. Ram! We're just boiling our  porridge, come and have some, and then we'll eat you both up.\" At this  the goat took fright, while as for the ram, his legs had been shaking  with fear for some time. Then the goat began to think, and he thought  and thought and at last he said: \"Come now, Mr. Ram, let's have a look  at that wolf's head you've got in your sack!\" And the ram took out the  wolf's head, when the goat said: \"No, not that one. Let's have the other  bigger one!\" And again the ram gave him the same head, but he said: \"No,  not that one either! let's have the largest of all!\"    And the wolves looked, and thought the ram had a whole sackful of  wolves' heads, and each one of them said to himself: \"Well, these are  nice guests to have! I'd better hop off!\" And first one said aloud to  the others: \"I like your company all right, brothers, but somehow, the  porridge doesn't seem to be boiling very well. I'll just run and fetch  some sticks to throw on the fire.\" And as he went off, he thought to  himself: \"You and your company be bothered!\"--and never came back.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Then the second wolf kept thinking how he could get away, and he said:  \"It seems very funny, our brother went to fetch the wood, but he hasn't  brought the wood, and hasn't come back himself. I'll just go and help  him!\" So off he went too, and never came back. And the third wolf was  left sitting there, and at last he said: \"I must really go and hurry  them up. What are they dawdling all this time for!\" And as soon as he  was gone, he set off running and never so much as looked back.    [Illustration]    And at that the ram and the goat were delighted. They ate up all the  porridge and then ran away themselves.    [Illustration]    Meanwhile the wolves had all three met, and they said: \"Look here, why  were we three frightened of the goat and the ram? They're no stronger  than we, after all! Let's go and do them in!\"    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    But when they came back to the fire, there was not so much as a trace of  them left. Then the wolves set off in pursuit, and at last they saw  them, where they had climbed up a tree, the goat on an upper and the ram  on a lower branch. So the eldest wolf lay down under the tree, and  began to show his teeth, looking up at them, and waiting for them to  climb down. And the ram, who was trembling all over from fright,  suddenly fell down right on top of the wolf, and at the same minute the  goat shouted out from up above: \"There, that's the one! get me the  largest of all!\" And the wolf was terrified, because he thought the ram  had jumped down after him, and you should just have seen him run! And  the other two followed after.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    What a lucky boy is Pat, He's got a dog and a cat!          THE HUNGRY WOLF.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]      There was once a wolf, and he got very hungry, and so he went to have a  look to see what he could find for dinner. After a bit he saw a ram  feeding in a meadow, so he went up to him and said: \"Mr. Ram, Mr. Ram,  I'm going to eat you!\" But the ram answered: \"Who are you, I should like  to know, that you mean to eat me?\" \"I'm a wolf, and I'm looking for a  good dinner,\" said the wolf. \"What sort of a wolf do you fancy you are?\"  answered the ram, \"you're not, you're a dog!\" \"No, I'm not a dog,\" said  he, \"I'm a wolf.\" \"Well then,\" answered the ram, \"if you're a wolf,  stand at the bottom of the hill and open your jaws wide. Then I'll run  down the hill and jump straight into your mouth.\" \"All right,\" said the  wolf.    [Illustration]    So he stood at the bottom of the hill and opened his mouth wide, while  the ram climbed to the top of the hill. Then he ran down the hill very  fast, and hit the wolf with his horns as hard as he could.    [Illustration]    The wolf rolled over, knocked senseless with the blow, while the ram ran  off home. And there lay the wolf, till at last he came to himself again,  with all his bones aching.    [Illustration]    \"Well, what a fool I must have been!\" thought he. \"Who ever saw a ram  jump into one's mouth of his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2347"],[0,"The Adventure of the Dying Detective (#1)"],[1,"Adventure of the Dying Detective      By    Sir Arthur Conan Doyle          Mrs. Hudson, the landlady of Sherlock Holmes, was a long-suffering  woman.  Not only was her first-floor flat invaded at all hours by  throngs of singular and often undesirable characters but her remarkable  lodger showed an eccentricity and irregularity in his life which must  have sorely tried her patience. His incredible untidiness, his  addiction to music at strange hours, his occasional revolver practice  within doors, his weird and often malodorous scientific experiments,  and the atmosphere of violence and danger which hung around him made  him the very worst tenant in London.  On the other hand, his payments  were princely. I have no doubt that the house might have been purchased  at the price which Holmes paid for his rooms during the years that I  was with him.    The landlady stood in the deepest awe of him and never dared to  interfere with him, however outrageous his proceedings might seem.  She  was fond of him, too, for he had a remarkable gentleness and courtesy  in his dealings with women.  He disliked and distrusted the sex, but he  was always a chivalrous opponent. Knowing how genuine was her regard  for him, I listened earnestly to her story when she came to my rooms in  the second year of my married life and told me of the sad condition to  which my poor friend was reduced.    \"He's dying, Dr. Watson,\" said she.  \"For three days he has been  sinking, and I doubt if he will last the day.  He would not let me get  a doctor.  This morning when I saw his bones sticking out of his face  and his great bright eyes looking at me I could stand no more of it.  'With your leave or without it, Mr. Holmes, I am going for a doctor  this very hour,' said I.  'Let it be Watson, then,' said he.  I  wouldn't waste an hour in coming to him, sir, or you may not see him  alive.\"    I was horrified for I had heard nothing of his illness.  I need not say  that I rushed for my coat and my hat.  As we drove back I asked for the  details.    \"There is little I can tell you, sir.  He has been working at a case  down at Rotherhithe, in an alley near the river, and he has brought  this illness back with him.  He took to his bed on Wednesday afternoon  and has never moved since.  For these three days neither food nor drink  has passed his lips.\"    \"Good God!  Why did you not call in a doctor?\"    \"He wouldn't have it, sir.  You know how masterful he is.  I didn't  dare to disobey him.  But he's not long for this world, as you'll see  for yourself the moment that you set eyes on him.\"    He was indeed a deplorable spectacle.  In the dim light of a foggy  November day the sick room was a gloomy spot, but it was that gaunt,  wasted face staring at me from the bed which sent a chill to my heart.  His eyes had the brightness of fever, there was a hectic flush upon  either cheek, and dark crusts clung to his lips; the thin hands upon  the coverlet twitched incessantly, his voice was croaking and  spasmodic.  He lay listlessly as I entered the room, but the sight of  me brought a gleam of recognition to his eyes.    \"Well, Watson, we seem to have fallen upon evil days,\" said he in a  feeble voice, but with something of his old carelessness of manner.    \"My dear fellow!\" I cried, approaching him.    \"Stand back!  Stand right back!\" said he with the sharp imperiousness  which I had associated only with moments of crisis. \"If you approach  me, Watson, I shall order you out of the house.\"    \"But why?\"    \"Because it is my desire.  Is that not enough?\"    Yes, Mrs. Hudson was right.  He was more masterful than ever.  It was  pitiful, however, to see his exhaustion.    \"I only wished to help,\" I explained.    \"Exactly!  You will help best by doing what you are told.\"    \"Certainly, Holmes.\"    He relaxed the austerity of his manner.    \"You are not angry?\" he asked, gasping for breath.    Poor devil, how could I be angry when I saw him lying in such a plight  before me?    \"It's for your own sake, Watson,\" he croaked.    \"For MY sake?\"    \"I know what is the matter with me.  It is a coolie disease from  Sumatra--a thing that the Dutch know more about than we, though they  have made little of it up to date.  One thing only is certain.  It is  infallibly deadly, and it is horribly contagious.\"    He spoke now with a feverish energy, the long hands twitching and  jerking as he motioned me away.    \"Contagious by touch, Watson--that's it, by touch.  Keep your distance  and all is well.\"    \"Good heavens, Holmes!  Do you suppose that such a consideration weighs  with me of an instant?  It would not affect me in the case of a  stranger.  Do you imagine it would prevent me from doing my duty to so  old a friend?\"    Again I advanced, but he repulsed me with a look of furious anger.    \"If you will stand there I will talk.  If you do not you must leave the  room.\"    I have so deep a respect for the extraordinary qualities of Holmes that  I have always deferred to his wishes, even when I least understood  them.  But now all my professional instincts were aroused.  Let him be  my master elsewhere, I at least was his in a sick room.    \"Holmes,\" said I, \"you are not yourself.  A sick man is but a child,  and so I will treat you.  Whether you like it or not, I will examine  your symptoms and treat you for them.\"    He looked at me with venomous eyes.    \"If I am to have a doctor whether I will or not, let me at least have  someone in whom I have confidence,\" said he.    \"Then you have none in me?\"    \"In your friendship, certainly.  But facts are facts, Watson, and,  after all, you are only a general practitioner with very limited  experience and mediocre qualifications.  It is painful to have to say  these things, but you leave me no choice.\"    I was bitterly hurt.    \"Such a remark is unworthy of you, Holmes.  It shows me very clearly  the state of your own nerves.  But if you have no confidence in me I  would not intrude my services.  Let me bring Sir Jasper Meek or Penrose  Fisher, or any of the best men in London.  But someone you MUST have,  and that is final.  If you think that I am going to stand here and see  you die without either helping you myself or bringing anyone else to  help you, then you have mistaken your man.\"    \"You mean well, Watson,\" said the sick man with something between a sob  and a groan.  \"Shall I demonstrate your own ignorance? What do you  know, pray, of Tapanuli fever?  What do you know of the black Formosa  corruption?\"    \"I have never heard of either.\"    \"There are many problems of disease, many strange pathological  possibilities, in the East, Watson.\"  He paused after each sentence to  collect his failing strength.  \"I have learned so much during some  recent researches which have a medico-criminal aspect.  It was in the  course of them that I contracted this complaint.  You can do nothing.\"    \"Possibly not.  But I happen to know that Dr. Ainstree, the greatest  living authority upon tropical disease, is now in London.  All  remonstrance is useless, Holmes, I am going this instant to fetch him.\"  I turned resolutely to the door.    Never have I had such a shock!  In an instant, with a tiger-spring, the  dying man had intercepted me.  I heard the sharp snap of a twisted key.  The next moment he had staggered back to his bed, exhausted and panting  after his one tremendous outflame of energy.    \"You won't take the key from me by force, Watson, I've got you, my  friend.  Here you are, and here you will stay until I will otherwise.  But I'll humour you.\"  (All this in little gasps, with terrible  struggles for breath between.)  \"You've only my own good at heart.  Of  course I know that very well.  You shall have your way, but give me  time to get my strength.  Not now, Watson, not now.  It's four o'clock.  At six you can go.\"    \"This is insanity, Holmes.\"    \"Only two hours, Watson.  I promise you will go at six.  Are you  content to wait?\"    \"I seem to have no choice.\"    \"None in the world, Watson.  Thank you, I need no help in arranging the  clothes.  You will please keep your distance.  Now, Watson, there is  one other condition that I would make.  You will seek help, not from  the man you mention, but from the one that I choose.\"    \"By all means.\"    \"The first three sensible words that you have uttered since you entered  this room, Watson.  You will find some books over there. I am somewhat  exhausted; I wonder how a battery feels when it pours electricity into  a non-conductor?  At six, Watson, we resume our conversation.\"    But it was destined to be resumed long before that hour, and in  circumstances which gave me a shock hardly second to that caused by his  spring to the door.  I had stood for some minutes looking at the silent  figure in the bed.  His face was almost covered by the clothes and he  appeared to be asleep.  Then, unable to settle down to reading, I  walked slowly round the room, examining the pictures of celebrated  criminals with which every wall was adorned.  Finally, in my aimless  perambulation, I came to the mantelpiece.  A litter of pipes,  tobacco-pouches, syringes, penknives, revolver-cartridges, and other  debris was scattered over it.  In the midst of these was a small black  and white ivory box with a sliding lid.  It was a neat little thing,  and I had stretched out my hand to examine it more closely, when----    It was a dreadful cry that he gave--a yell which might have been heard  down the street.  My skin went cold and my hair bristled at that  horrible scream.  As I turned I caught a glimpse of a convulsed face  and frantic eyes.  I stood paralyzed, with the little box in my hand.    \"Put it down!  Down, this instant, Watson--this instant, I say!\" His  head sank back upon the pillow and he gave a deep sigh of relief as I  replaced the box upon the mantelpiece.  \"I hate to have my things  touched, Watson.  You know that I hate it.  You fidget me beyond  endurance. You, a doctor-"]]]
