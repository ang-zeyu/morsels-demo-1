The subfields consist of the  name of the capital itself, its geographic coordinates, the time  difference at the capital from coordinated universal time (UTC), and,  if applicable, information on daylight saving time (DST). Where  appropriate, a special note has been added to highlight those  countries that have multiple time zones.    - The Transnational issues category now has a \"Trafficking in persons\"  entry. Human trafficking connotes modern-day slavery and this important  new field will include information on the most egregious countries  (Tier 2 Watch List and Tier 3) as listed in the US State Department's  annual report.    - A new Appendix G lists Weights and Measures. The appendix includes  information on mathematical notation and metric interrelationships, as  well as over 400 examples of standard conversion factors.    -Revision of some individual country maps, first introduced in the 2001  edition, is continued in this edition. Several regional maps have also  been updated to reflect boundary changes and place name spelling changes.        ======================================================================        The World Factbook (2007) - Country Listing      [Transcriber's note: To search on a country in this file, prefix the  country's name with \"@\", e.g. \"@Afghanistan\".  \"Afghanistan\" will find  all occurrences;

(LE CHIEN D'OR.)    By William Kirby          AUTHOR'S PREFATORY NOTE.      TO THE PUBLIC:    In the year 1877 the first edition of \"The Golden Dog\" (Le Chien d'Or)  was brought out in the United States, entirely without my knowledge or  sanction. Owing to the inadequacy of the then existing copyright laws,  I have been powerless to prevent its continued publication, which I  understand to have been a successful and profitable undertaking for  all concerned, except the author, the book having gone through many  editions.    It was, consequently, a source of gratification to me when I was  approached by Messrs. L. C. Page & Company, of Boston, with a request to  revise \"The Golden Dog,\" and re-publish it through them. The result is  the present edition, which I have corrected and revised in the light of  the latest developments in the history of Quebec, and which is the only  edition offered to my readers with the sanction and approval of its  author.

MEN OF THE OLD REGIME.      \"'See Naples, and then die!' That was a proud saying, Count, which we  used to hear as we cruised under lateen sails about the glorious bay  that reflects from its waters the fires of Vesuvius. We believed the  boast then, Count. But I say now, 'See Quebec, and live forever!'  Eternity would be too short to weary me of this lovely scene--this  bright Canadian morning is worthy of Eden, and the glorious landscape  worthy of such a sun-rising.\"    Thus exclaimed a tall, fair Swedish gentleman, his blue eyes sparkling,  and every feature glowing with enthusiasm, Herr Peter Kalm, to His  Excellency Count de la Galissoniere, Governor of New France, as they  stood together on a bastion of the ramparts of Quebec, in the year of  grace 1748.    A group of French and Canadian officers, in the military uniforms  of Louis XV., stood leaning on their swords, as they conversed gaily  together on the broad gravelled walk at the foot of the rampart. They  formed the suite in attendance upon the Governor, who was out by sunrise  this morning to inspect the work done during the night by the citizens  of Quebec and the habitans of the surrounding country, who had been  hastily summoned to labor upon the defences of the city.    A few ecclesiastics, in black cassocks, dignitaries of the Church,  mingled cheerfully in the conversation of the officers. They had  accompanied the Governor, both to show their respect, and to encourage,  by their presence and exhortations, the zeal of the colonists in the  work of fortifying the capital.    War was then raging between old England and old France, and between New  England and New France. The vast region of North America, stretching far  into the interior and southwest from Canada to Louisiana, had for  three years past been the scene of fierce hostilities between the rival  nations, while the savage Indian tribes, ranged on the one side and on  the other, steeped their moccasins in the blood of French and English  colonists, who, in their turn, became as fierce, and carried on the war  as relentlessly, as the savages themselves.    Louisbourg, the bulwark of New France, projecting its mailed arm boldly  into the Atlantic, had been cut off by the English, who now overran  Acadia, and began to threaten Quebec with invasion by sea and land. Busy  rumors of approaching danger were rife in the colony, and the gallant  Governor issued orders, which were enthusiastically obeyed, for the  people to proceed to the walls and place the city in a state of defence,  to bid defiance to the enemy.    Rolland Michel Barrin, Count de la Galissoniere, was remarkable no less  for his philosophical attainments, that ranked him high among the savans  of the French Academy, than for his political abilities and foresight  as a statesman. He felt strongly the vital interests involved in the  present war, and saw clearly what was the sole policy necessary for  France to adopt in order to preserve her magnificent dominion in North  America. His counsels were neither liked nor followed by the Court of  Versailles, then sinking fast into the slough of corruption that marked  the closing years of the reign of Louis XV.    Among the people who admired deeds more than words the Count was  honored as a brave and skilful admiral, who had borne the flag of  France triumphantly over the seas, and in the face of her most powerful  enemies--the English and Dutch. His memorable repulse of Admiral Byng,  eight years after the events here recorded,--which led to the death of  that brave and unfortunate officer, who was shot by sentence of court  martial to atone for that repulse,--was a glory to France, but to the  Count brought after it a manly sorrow for the fate of his opponent,  whose death he regarded as a cruel and unjust act, unworthy of the  English nation, usually as generous and merciful as it is brave and  considerate.    The Governor was already well-advanced in years. He had entered upon the  winter of life, that sprinkles the head with snow that never melts, but  he was still hale, ruddy, and active. Nature had, indeed, moulded him  in an unpropitious hour for personal comeliness, but in compensation had  seated a great heart and a graceful mind in a body low of stature,  and marked by a slight deformity. His piercing eyes, luminous with  intelligence and full of sympathy for everything noble and elevated,  overpowered with their fascination the blemishes that a too curious  scrutiny might discover upon his figure; while his mobile, handsome lips  poured out the natural eloquence of clear thoughts and noble sentiments.  The Count grew great while speaking: his listeners were carried away by  the magic of his voice and the clearness of his intellect.    He was very happy this morning by the side of his old friend, Peter  Kalm, who was paying him a most welcome visit in New France. They had  been fellow-students, both at Upsal and at Paris, and loved each other  with a cordiality that, like good wine, grew richer and more generous  with age.    Herr Kalm, stretching out his arms as if to embrace the lovely landscape  and clasp it to his bosom, exclaimed with fresh enthusiasm, \"See Quebec,  and live forever!\"    \"Dear Kalm,\" said the Governor, catching the fervor of his friend, as he  rested his hand affectionately on his shoulder, \"you are as true a lover  of nature as when we sat together at the feet of Linnaeus, our glorious  young master, and heard him open up for us the arcana of God's works;  and we used to feel like him, too, when he thanked God for permitting  him to look into his treasure-house and see the precious things of  creation which he had made.\"    \"Till men see Quebec,\" replied Kalm, \"they will not fully realize the  meaning of the term, 'God's footstool.' It is a land worth living for!\"    \"Not only a land to live for, but a land to die for, and happy the  man who dies for it! Confess, Kalm,--thou who hast travelled in all  lands,--think'st thou not it is indeed worthy of its proud title of New  France?\"    \"It is indeed worthy,\" replied Kalm; \"I see here a scion of the old  oak of the Gauls, which, if let grow, will shelter the throne of France  itself in an empire wider than Caesar wrested from Ambiotrix.\"    \"Yes,\" replied the Count, kindling at the words of his friend, \"it  is old France transplanted, transfigured, and glorified,--where her  language, religion, and laws shall be handed down to her posterity, the  glory of North America as the mother-land is the glory of Europe!\"    The enthusiastic Galissoniere stretched out his hands and implored a  blessing upon the land entrusted to his keeping.    It was a glorious morning. The sun had just risen over the hilltops of  Lauzon, throwing aside his drapery of gold, purple, and crimson. The  soft haze of the summer morning was floating away into nothingness,  leaving every object fresh with dew and magnified in the limpid purity  of the air.    The broad St. Lawrence, far"]]]
