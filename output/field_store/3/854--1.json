The object of the present work is to offer to the farmer a concise  outline of the general principles of Agricultural Chemistry. It has no  pretensions to be considered a complete treatise on the subject. On the  contrary, its aim is strictly elementary, and with this view I have  endeavoured, as far as possible, to avoid unnecessary technicalities so  as to make it intelligible to those who are unacquainted with the  details of chemical science, although I have not hesitated to discuss  such points as appeared essential to the proper understanding of any  particular subject.    The rapid progress of agricultural chemistry, and the numerous  researches prosecuted under the auspices of agricultural societies and  private experimenters in this and other countries, render it by no means  an easy task to make a proper selection from the mass of facts which is  being daily accumulated. In doing this, however, I have been guided by a  pretty intimate knowledge of the wants of the farmer, which has induced  me to enlarge on those departments of the subject which bear more  immediately on the every-day practice of agriculture; and for this  reason the composition and properties of soils, the nature of manures,  and the principles by which their application ought to be governed, have  been somewhat minutely treated.    In all cases numerical details have been given as fully as is consistent  with the limits of the work; and it may be right to state that a  considerable number of the analyses contained in it have been made in my  own laboratory, and that even when I have preferred to quote the results  of other chemists, they have not unfrequently been confirmed by my own  experiments.

That the phenomena of vegetation are dependent on certain chemical  changes occurring in the plant, by which the various elements of its  food are elaborated and converted into vegetable matter, was very early  recognised by chemists; and long before the correct principles of that  science were established, Van Helmont maintained that plants derived  their nourishment from water, while Sir Kenelm Digby, Hook, Bradley, and  others, attributed an equally exclusive influence to air, and enlarged  on the practical importance of the conclusions to be deduced from their  views. These opinions, which were little better than hypotheses, and  founded on very imperfect chemical data, are mentioned by Jethro Tull,  the father of modern agriculture, only to deny their accuracy; and he  contended that the plants absorb and digest the finer particles of the  earth, and attributed the success of the particular system of husbandry  he advocated to the comminution of the soil, by which a larger number  of its particles are rendered sufficiently small to permit their ready  absorption by the roots. Popular opinion at that time was in favour of  the mechanical rather than the chemical explanation of agricultural  facts, and Tull's work had the effect of confirming this opinion, and  turning attention away from the application of chemistry to agriculture.  Indeed, no good results could have followed its study at that time, for  chemistry, especially in those departments bearing more immediately on  agriculture, was much too"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24951"],[0,"The War in South Africa, Its Cause and Conduct (#1)"],[1,"Transcriber's Note:       Minor typographical errors have been corrected without note.

Bell & Sons, London and Bombay    1902    [All rights reserved]          PREFACE      For some reason, which may be either arrogance or apathy, the British  are very slow to state their case to the world. At present the reasons  for our actions and the methods which we have used are set forth in many  Blue-books, tracts, and leaflets, but have never, so far as I know, been  collected into one small volume. In view of the persistent slanders to  which our politicians and our soldiers have been equally exposed, it  becomes a duty which we owe to our national honour to lay the facts  before the world. I wish someone more competent, and with some official  authority, had undertaken the task, which I have tried to do as best I  might from an independent standpoint.    There was never a war in history in which the right was absolutely on  one side, or in which no incidents of the campaign were open to  criticism. I do not pretend that it was so here. But I do not think that  any unprejudiced man can read the facts without acknowledging that the  British Government has done its best to avoid war, and the British Army  to wage it with humanity.    To my publisher and to myself this work has been its own reward. In this  way we hope to put the price within the reach of all, and yet leave a  profit for the vendor. Our further ambition is, however, to translate it  into all European tongues, and to send a free copy to every deputy and  every newspaper on the Continent and in America. For this work money  will be needed--a considerable sum. We propose to make an appeal to the  public for these funds. Any sums which are sent to me or to my publisher  will be devoted to this work. There cannot be too much, for the more we  get the more we shall do.    I may add that I have not burdened my pages with continual references.  My quotations are reliable and can always, if necessary, be  substantiated.                                                           A. CONAN DOYLE.

To tell the tale one must go back to the  beginning, for there has been complete continuity of history in South  Africa, and every stage has depended upon that which has preceded it. No  one can know or appreciate the Boer who does not know his past, for he  is what his past has made him.    It was about the time when Oliver Cromwell was at his zenith--in 1652,  to be pedantically accurate--that the Dutch made their first lodgment at  the Cape of Good Hope. The Portuguese had been there before them, but,  repelled by the evil weather, and lured forward by rumours of gold, they  had passed the true seat of empire, and had voyaged farther, to settle  along the eastern coast. But the Dutchmen at the Cape prospered and grew  stronger in that robust climate. They did not penetrate far inland, for  they were few in number, and all they wanted was to be found close at  hand. But they built themselves houses, and they supplied the Dutch East  India Company with food and water, gradually budding off little  townlets, Wynberg, Stellenbosch, and pushing their settlements up the  long slopes which lead to that great central plateau which extends for  1,500 miles from the edge of the Karoo to the Valley of the Zambesi.    For a hundred more years the history of the colony was a record of the  gradual spreading of the Africanders over the huge expanse of veldt  which lay to the north of them. Cattle-raising became an industry, but  in a country where six acres can hardly support a sheep, large farms are  necessary for even small herds. Six thousand acres was the usual size,  and 5_l._ a year the rent payable to Government. The diseases which  follow the white man had in Africa, as in America and Australia, been  fatal to the natives, and an epidemic of smallpox cleared the country  for the new-comers. Farther and farther north they pushed, founding  little towns here and there, such as Graaf-Reinet and Swellendam, where  a Dutch Reformed Church and a store for the sale of the bare necessaries  of life formed a nucleus for a few scattered dwellings. Already the  settlers were showing that independence of control and that detachment  from Europe which has been their most prominent characteristic. Even the  mild sway of the Dutch Company had caused them to revolt. The local  rising, however, was hardly noticed in the universal cataclysm which  followed the French Revolution. After twenty years, during which the  world was shaken by the Titanic struggle in the final counting up of the  game and paying of the stakes, the Cape Colony was added in 1814 to the  British Empire.    In all the vast collection of British States there is probably not one  the title-deeds to which are more incontestable than to this. Britain  had it by two rights, the right of conquest and the right of purchase.  In 1806 troops landed, defeated the local forces, and took possession of  Cape Town. In 1814 Britain paid the large sum of six million pounds to  the Stadtholder for the transference of this and some South American  land. It was a bargain which was probably made rapidly and carelessly in  that general redistribution which was going on. As a house of call upon  the way to India the place was seen to be of value, but the country  itself was looked upon as unprofitable and desert. What would  Castlereagh or Liverpool have thought could they have seen the items  which they were buying for six million pounds? The inventory would have  been a mixed one of good and of evil: nine fierce Kaffir wars, the  greatest diamond mines in the world, the wealthiest gold mines, two  costly and humiliating campaigns with men whom we respected even when we  fought with them, and now at last, we hope, a South Africa of peace and  prosperity, with equal rights and equal duties for all men.    The title-deeds to the estate are, as I have said, good ones, but there  is one singular and ominous flaw in their provisions. The ocean has  marked three boundaries to it, but the fourth is undefined. There is no  word of the 'hinterland,' for neither the term nor the idea had then  been thought of. Had Great Britain bought those vast regions which  extended beyond the settlements? Or were the discontented Dutch at  liberty to pass onwards and found fresh nations to bar the path of the  Anglo-Celtic colonists? In that question lay the germ of all the trouble  to come. An American would realise the point at issue if he could  conceive that after the founding of the United States the Dutch  inhabitants of the State of New York had trekked to the westward and  established fresh communities under a new flag. Then, when the American  population overtook these western States, they would be face to face  with the problem which this country has had to solve. If they found  these new States fiercely anti-American and extremely unprogressive,  they would experience that aggravation of their difficulties with which  British statesmen have had to deal.    At the time of their transference to the British flag the  colonists--Dutch, French, and German--numbered some thirty thousand.  They were slaveholders, and the slaves were about as numerous as  themselves. The prospect of complete amalgamation between the British  and the original settlers would have seemed to be a good one, since they  were of much the same stock, and their creeds could only be  distinguished by their varying degrees of bigotry and intolerance. Five  thousand British emigrants were landed in 1820, settling on the Eastern  borders of the colony, and from that time onwards there was a slow but  steady influx of English-speaking colonists. The Government had the  historical faults and the historical virtues of British rule. It was  mild, clean, honest, tactless, and inconsistent. On the whole, it might  have done very well had it been content to leave things as it found  them. But to change the habits of the most conservative of Teutonic  races was a dangerous venture, and one which has led to a long series of  complications, making up the troubled history of South Africa.    The Imperial Government has always taken an honourable and philanthropic  view of the rights of the native and the claim which he has to the  protection of the law. We hold, and rightly, that British justice, if  not blind, should at least be colour-blind. The view is irreproachable  in theory and incontestable in argument, but it is apt to be irritating  when urged by a Boston moralist or a London"]]]
