[Henry] Spalding                London  Macmillan and Co.  1881          PREFACE    Eugene Oneguine, the chief poetical work of Russia's greatest poet,  having been translated into all the principal languages of Europe  except our own, I hope that this version may prove an acceptable  contribution to literature. Tastes are various in matters of poetry,  but the present work possesses a more solid claim to attention in  the series of faithful pictures it offers of Russian life and manners.  If these be compared with Mr. Wallace's book on Russia, it will be  seen that social life in that empire still preserves many of the  characteristics which distinguished it half a century ago--the period  of the first publication of the latter cantos of this poem.    Many references will be found in it to our own country and its  literature. Russian poets have carefully plagiarized the English--  notably Joukovski. Pushkin, however, was no plagiarist, though  undoubtedly his mind was greatly influenced by the genius of Byron--  more especially in the earliest part of his career. Indeed, as will  be remarked in the following pages, he scarcely makes an effort to  disguise this fact.    The biographical sketch is of course a mere outline. I did not think  a longer one advisable, as memoirs do not usually excite much interest  till the subjects of them are pretty well known. In the \"notes\" I  have endeavored to elucidate a somewhat obscure subject. Some of the  poet's allusions remain enigmatical to the present day. The point of  each sarcasm naturally passed out of mind together with the society  against which it was levelled. If some of the versification is rough  and wanting in \"go,\" I must plead in excuse the difficult form of the  stanza, and in many instances the inelastic nature of the subject  matter to be versified. Stanza XXXV Canto II forms a good example  of the latter difficulty, and is omitted in the German and French  versions to which I have had access. The translation of foreign  verse is comparatively easy so long as it is confined to conventional  poetic subjects, but when it embraces abrupt scraps of conversation  and the description of local customs it becomes a much more arduous  affair. I think I may say that I have adhered closely to the text  of the original.    The following foreign translations of this poem have appeared:    1. French prose. Oeuvres choisis de Pouchekine. H.

The accent,  which is very arbitrary in the Russian language, is indicated  unmistakably in a rhythmical composition.          A Short Biographical Notice of Alexander Pushkin.    Alexander Sergevitch Pushkin was born in 1799 at Pskoff, and was  a scion of an ancient Russian family. In one of his letters it is  recorded that no less than six Pushkins signed the Charta declaratory  of the election of the Romanoff family to the throne of Russia, and  that two more affixed their marks from inability to write.    In 1811 he entered the Lyceum, an aristocratic educational  establishment at Tsarskoe Selo, near St. Petersburg, where he was  the friend and schoolmate of Prince Gortchakoff the Russian  Chancellor. As a scholar he displayed no remarkable amount of  capacity, but was fond of general reading and much given to  versification. Whilst yet a schoolboy he wrote many lyrical  compositions and commenced _Ruslan and Liudmila_, his first poem  of any magnitude, and, it is asserted, the first readable one ever  produced in the Russian language. During his boyhood he came much  into contact with the poets Dmitrieff and Joukovski, who were  intimate with his father, and his uncle, Vassili Pushkin, himself  an author of no mean repute. The friendship of the historian  Karamzine must have exercised a still more beneficial influence  upon him.    In 1817 he quitted the Lyceum and obtained an appointment in the  Foreign Office at St. Petersburg. Three years of reckless  dissipation in the capital, where his lyrical talent made him  universally popular, resulted in 1818 in a putrid fever which  was near carrying him off. At this period of his life he scarcely  slept at all; worked all day and dissipated at night. Society was  open to him from the palace of the prince to the officers'  quarters of the Imperial Guard. The reflection of this mode of  life may be noted in the first canto of _Eugene Oneguine_ and the  early dissipations of the \"Philosopher just turned eighteen,\"--  the exact age of Pushkin when he commenced his career in the  Russian capital.    In 1820 he was transferred to the bureau of Lieutenant-General  Inzoff, at Kishineff in Bessarabia. This event was probably due  to his composing and privately circulating an \"Ode to Liberty,\"  though the attendant circumstances have never yet been thoroughly  brought to light. An indiscreet admiration for Byron most likely  involved the young poet in this scrape. The tenor of this  production, especially its audacious allusion to the murder of  the emperor Paul, father of the then reigning Tsar, assuredly  deserved, according to aristocratic ideas, the deportation to  Siberia which was said to have been prepared for the author.  The intercession of Karamzine and Joukovski procured a commutation  of his sentence. Strangely enough, Pushkin appeared anxious to  deceive the public as to the real cause of his sudden disappearance  from the capital; for in an Ode to Ovid composed about this time  he styles himself a \"voluntary exile.\" (See Note 4 to this volume.)    During the four succeeding years he made numerous excursions amid  the beautiful countries which from the basin of the Euxine--and  amongst these the Crimea and the Caucasus. A nomad life passed  amid the beauties of nature acted powerfully in developing his  poetical genius. To this period he refers in the final canto of  _Eugene Oneguine_ (st. v.), when enumerating the various influences  which had contributed to the formation of his Muse:         Then, the far capital forgot,       Its splendour and its blandishments,       In poor Moldavia cast her lot,       She visited the humble tents       Of migratory gipsy hordes.    During these pleasant years of youth he penned some of his most  delightful poetical works: amongst these, _The Prisoner of the  Caucasus, The Fountain of Baktchiserai_, and the _Gipsies_. Of the  two former it may be said that they are in the true style of the  _Giaour_ and the _Corsair_. In fact, just at that point of time  Byron's fame--like the setting sun--shone out with dazzling lustre  and irresistibly charmed the mind of Pushkin amongst many others.  The _Gipsies_ is more original; indeed the poet himself has been  identified with Aleko, the hero of the tale, which may well be  founded on his own personal adventures without involving the guilt  of a double murder. His undisguised admiration for Byron doubtless  exposed him to imputations similar to those commonly levelled  against that poet. But Pushkin's talent was too genuine for him to  remain long subservient to that of another, and in a later period  of his career he broke loose from all trammels and selected a line  peculiarly his own. Before leaving this stage in our narrative we  may point out the fact that during the whole of this period of  comparative seclusion the poet was indefatigably occupied in  study. Not only were the standard works of European literature  perused, but two more languages--namely Italian and Spanish--were  added to his original stock: French, English, Latin and German  having been acquired at the Lyceum. To this happy union of  literary research with the study of nature we must attribute the  sudden bound by which he soon afterwards attained the pinnacle of  poetic fame amongst his own countrymen.    In 1824 he once more fell under the imperial displeasure. A letter  seized in the post, and expressive of atheistical sentiments  (possibly but a transient vagary of his youth) was the ostensible  cause of his banishment from Odessa to his paternal estate of  Mikhailovskoe in the province of Pskoff.

Which puzzles Raja Vikram    Conclusion          PREFACE    The Baital-Pachisi, or Twenty-five Tales of a Baital is the history of  a huge Bat, Vampire, or Evil Spirit which inhabited and animated dead  bodies. It is an old, and thoroughly Hindu, Legend composed in Sanskrit,  and is the germ which culminated in the Arabian Nights, and which  inspired the \"Golden Ass\" of Apuleius, Boccacio's \"Decamerone,\" the  \"Pentamerone,\" and all that class of facetious fictitious literature.    The story turns chiefly on a great king named Vikram, the King Arthur of  the East, who in pursuance of his promise to a Jogi or Magician, brings  to him the Baital (Vampire), who is hanging on a tree. The difficulties  King Vikram and his son have in bringing the Vampire into the presence  of the Jogi are truly laughable; and on this thread is strung a series  of Hindu fairy stories, which contain much interesting information on  Indian customs and manners. It also alludes to that state, which induces  Hindu devotees to allow themselves to be buried alive, and to appear  dead for weeks or months, and then to return to life again; a curious  state of mesmeric catalepsy, into which they work themselves by  concentrating the mind and abstaining from food--a specimen of which I  have given a practical illustration in the Life of Sir Richard Burton.    The following translation is rendered peculiarly; valuable and  interesting by Sir Richard Burton's intimate knowledge of the language.  To all who understand the ways of the East, it is as witty, and as full  of what is popularly called \"chaff\" as it is possible to be. There is  not a dull page in it, and it will especially please those who delight  in the weird and supernatural, the grotesque, and the wild life.    My husband only gives eleven of the best tales, as it was thought the  translation would prove more interesting in its abbreviated form.    ISABEL BURTON.    August 18th, 1893.          PREFACE TO THE FIRST (1870) EDITION.    \"THE genius of Eastern nations,\" says an established and respectable  authority, \"was, from the earliest times, much turned towards invention  and the love of fiction. The Indians, the Persians, and the Arabians,  were all famous for their fables. Amongst the ancient Greeks we hear  of the Ionian and Milesian tales, but they have now perished, and,  from every account we hear of them, appear to have been loose and  indelicate.\" Similarly, the classical dictionaries define \"Milesiae  fabulae\" to be \"licentious themes,\" \"stories of an amatory or mirthful  nature,\" or \"ludicrous and indecent plays.\" M. Deriege seems indeed  to confound them with the \"Moeurs du Temps\" illustrated with artistic  gouaches, when he says, \"une de ces fables milesiennes, rehaussees de  peintures, que la corruption romaine recherchait alors avec une folle  ardeur.\"    My friend, Mr. Richard Charnock, F.A.S.L., more correctly defines  Milesian fables to have been originally \"certain tales or novels,  composed by Aristides of Miletus \"; gay in matter and graceful in  manner. \"They were translated into Latin by the historian Sisenna, the  friend of Atticus, and they had a great success at Rome. Plutarch, in  his life of Crassus, tells us that after the defeat of Carhes (Carrhae?)  some Milesiacs were found in the baggage of the Roman prisoners. The  Greek text; and the Latin translation have long been lost. The only  surviving fable is the tale of Cupid and Psyche,[1] which Apuleius calls  'Milesius sermo,' and it makes us deeply regret the disappearance of the  others.\" Besides this there are the remains of Apollodorus and  Conon, and a few traces to be found in Pausanias, Athenaeus, and the  scholiasts.    I do not, therefore, agree with Blair, with the dictionaries, or with M.  Deriege. Miletus, the great maritime city of Asiatic Ionia, was of old  the meeting-place of the East and the West. Here the Phoenician trader  from the Baltic would meet the Hindu wandering to Intra, from Extra,  Gangem; and the Hyperborean would step on shore side by side with the  Nubian and the Aethiop. Here was produced and published for the use of  the then civilized world, the genuine Oriental apologue, myth and tale  combined, which, by amusing narrative and romantic adventure, insinuates  a lesson in morals or in humanity, of which we often in our days must  fail to perceive the drift. The book of Apuleius, before quoted, is  subject to as many discoveries of recondite meaning as is Rabelais.  As regards the licentiousness of the Milesian fables, this sign of  semi-civilization is still inherent in most Eastern books of the  description which we call \"light literature,\" and the ancestral  tale-teller never collects a larger purse of coppers than when he  relates the worst of his \"aurei.\" But this looseness, resulting from  the separation of the sexes, is accidental, not necessary. The following  collection will show that it can be dispensed with, and that there is  such a thing as comparative purity in Hindu literature. The author,  indeed, almost always takes the trouble to marry his hero and his  heroine, and if he cannot find a priest, he generally adopts  an exceedingly left-hand and Caledonian but legal rite called  \"gandharbavivaha.[2]\"    The work of Apuleius, as ample internal evidence shows, is borrowed from  the East. The groundwork of the tale is the metamorphosis of Lucius  of Corinth into an ass, and the strange accidents which precede his  recovering the human form.    Another old Hindu story-book relates, in the popular fairy-book  style, the wondrous adventures of the hero and demigod, the great  Gandharba-Sena. That son of Indra, who was also the father of  Vikramajit, the subject of this and another collection, offended the  ruler of the firmament by his fondness for a certain nymph, and was  doomed to wander over earth under the form of a donkey. Through the  interposition of the gods, however, he was permitted to become a man  during the hours of darkness, thus comparing with the English legend--              Amundeville is lord by day,            But the monk is lord by night.    Whilst labouring under this curse, Gandharba-Sena persuaded the King  of Dhara to give him a daughter in marriage, but it unfortunately so  happened that at the wedding hour he was unable to show himself in any  but asinine shape. After bathing, however, he proceeded to the assembly,  and, hearing songs and music, he resolved to give them a specimen of his  voice.    The guests were filled with sorrow that so beautiful a virgin should be  married to a donkey. They were afraid to express their feelings to the  king, but they could not refrain from smiling, covering their mouths  with their garments. At length some one interrupted the general silence  and said:    \"O king, is this the son of Indra? You have found a fine bridegroom; you  are indeed happy; don't delay the marriage; delay is improper in doing  good; we never saw so glorious a wedding! It is true that we once heard  of a camel being married to a jenny-ass; when the ass, looking up to the  camel, said, 'Bless me, what a bridegroom!' and the camel, hearing the  voice of the ass, exclaimed, 'Bless me, what a musical voice!' In that  wedding, however, the bride and the bridegroom were equal; but in this  marriage, that such a bride should have such a bridegroom is truly  wonderful.\"    Other Brahmans then present said:    \"O king, at the marriage hour, in sign of joy the sacred shell is blown,  but thou hast no need of that\" (alluding to the donkey's braying).    The women all cried out:    \"O my mother![3] what is this? at the time of marriage to have an ass!  What a miserable thing! What! will he give that angelic girl in wedlock  to a donkey?\"    At length Gandharba-Sena, addressing the king in Sanskrit, urged him to  perform his promise. He reminded his future father-in-law that there is  no act more meritorious than speaking truth; that the mortal frame is  a mere dress, and that wise men never estimate the value of a person by  his clothes. He added that he was in that shape from the curse of his  sire, and that during the night he had the body of a man. Of his being  the son of Indra there could be no doubt.    Hearing the donkey thus speak Sanskrit, for it was never known that an  ass could discourse in that classical tongue, the minds of the people  were changed, and they confessed that, although he had an asinine form  he was unquestionably the son of Indra. The king, therefore, gave him  his daughter in marriage.[4] The metamorphosis brings with it many  misfortunes and strange occurrences, and it lasts till Fate in the  author's hand restores the hero to his former shape and honours."]]]
