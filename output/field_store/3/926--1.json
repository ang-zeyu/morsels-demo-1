Recent confirmation that the United Kingdom Government  administers the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia on Cyprus  as dependencies (and not as lease areas like the US Guantanamo Bay  Naval Station in Cuba) has required a changing of their status and  their addition to the Factbook as new entities. In addition, the  European Union has been included as an \"Other\" entity at the end of the  listing. The European Union continues to accrue more nation-like  characteristics for itself and so a separate listing was deemed  appropriate. A fuller explanation may be found under the European Union  Preliminary statement.    - Along with the new entities and the regular information updates,  The World Factbook now also features six new fields. In the  People category, a Major infectious diseases field has been added  for countries deemed to pose a higher degree of risk for  travelers. In the Economy category, entries have been added for  Current account balance, Investment (gross fixed), Public debt,  and Reserves of foreign exchange and gold. The Transnational  issues category has a new Refugees and internally displaced  persons entry.    - Revision of some individual country maps, first introduced in  the 2001 edition, is continued in this edition. Several regional  maps have also been updated to reflect boundary changes and place  name spelling changes.        =====================================================================        Country Listing      [Transcriber's note: To search on a country name in this file, prefix  the name with \"@\", e.g. \"@Afghanistan\".  \"Afghanistan\" will find all  occurrences;

The first spectators had been attracted by the preparations  which they saw had been made in the middle of the courtyard for  administering torture with the knout. One of the general's serfs, he who  acted as barber, was to be the victim.    Although this kind of punishment was a common enough sight in St.  Petersburg, it nevertheless attracted all passers-by when it was  publicly administered. This was the occurrence which had caused a crowd,  as just mentioned, before General Tchermayloff's house.    The spectators, even had they been in a hurry, would have had no cause  to complain of being kept waiting, for at half-past four a young man of  about five-and-twenty, in the handsome uniform of an aide-de-camp, his  breast covered with decorations, appeared on the steps at the farther  end of the court-yard in front of the house. These steps faced the large  gateway, and led to the general's apartments.    Arrived on the steps, the young aide-de-camp stopped a moment and fixed  his eyes on a window, the closely drawn curtains of which did not allow  him the least chance of satisfying his curiosity, whatever may have been  its cause. Seeing that it was useless and that he was only wasting time  in gazing in that direction, he made a sign to a bearded man who was  standing near a door which led to the servants' quarters. The door was  immediately opened, and the culprit was seen advancing in the middle of  a body of serfs and followed by the executioner. The serfs were forced  to attend the spectacle, that it might serve as an example to them. The  culprit was the general's barber, as we have said, and the executioner  was merely the coachman, who, being used to the handling of a whip, was  raised or degraded, which you will, to the office of executioner every  time punishment with the knout was ordered. This duty did not deprive  him of either the esteem or even the friendship of his comrades, for  they well knew that it was his arm alone that punished them and that his  heart was not in his work. As Ivan's arm as well as the rest of his body  was the property of the general, and the latter could do as he pleased  with it, no one was astonished that it should be used for this purpose.  More than that, correction administered by Ivan was nearly always  gentler than that meted out by another; for it often happened that Ivan,  who was a good-natured fellow, juggled away one or two strokes of the  knout in a dozen, or if he were forced by those assisting at the  punishment to keep a strict calculation, he manoeuvred so that the tip  of the lash struck the deal plank on which the culprit was lying, thus  taking much of the sting out of the stroke. Accordingly, when it was  Ivan's turn to be stretched upon the fatal plank and to receive the  correction he was in the habit of administering, on his own account,  those who momentarily played his part as executioner adopted the same  expedients, remembering only the strokes spared and not the strokes  received. This exchange of mutual benefits, therefore, was productive of  an excellent understanding between Ivan and his comrades, which was  never so firmly knit as at the moment when a fresh execution was about  to take place. It is true that the first hour after the punishment was  generally so full of suffering that the knouted was sometimes unjust to  the knouter, but this feeling seldom out-lasted the evening, and it was  rare when it held out after the first glass of spirits that the operator  drank to the health of his patient.    The serf upon whom Ivan was about to exercise his dexterity was a man of  five or six-and-thirty, red of hair and beard, a little above average  height. His Greek origin might be traced in his countenance, which even  in its expression of terror had preserved its habitual characteristics  of craft and cunning.    When he arrived at the spot where the punishment was to take place, the  culprit stopped and looked up at the window which had already claimed  the young aide-de-camp's attention; it still remained shut. With a  glance round the throng which obstructed the entrance leading to the  street, he ended by gazing, with a horror-stricken shudder upon the  plank on which he was to be stretched. The shudder did not escape his  friend Ivan, who, approaching to remove the striped shirt that covered  his shoulders, took the opportunity to whisper under his breath--    \"Come, Gregory, take courage!\"    \"You remember your promise?\" replied the culprit, with an indefinable  expression of entreaty.    \"Not for the first lashes, Gregory; do not count on that, for during the  first strokes the aide-de-camp will be watching; but among the later  ones be assured I will find means of cheating him of some of them.\"    \"Beyond everything you will take care of the tip of the lash?\"    \"I will do my best, Gregory, I will do my best. Do you not know that I  will?\"    \"Alas! yes,\" replied Gregory.    \"Now, then!\" said the aide-de-camp.    \"We are ready, noble sir,\" replied Ivan.    \"Wait, wait one moment, your high origin,\" cried poor Gregory,  addressing the young captain as though he had been a colonel, \"Vache  Vousso Korodie,\" in order to flatter him. \"I believe that the lady  Vaninka's window is about to open!\"    The young captain glanced eagerly towards the spot which had already  several times claimed his attention, but not a fold of the silken  curtains, which could be seen through the panes of the window, had  moved.    \"You are mistaken, you rascal,\" said the aide-de-camp, unwillingly  removing his eyes from the window, as though he also had hoped to see it  open, \"you are mistaken; and besides, what has your noble mistress to do  with all this?\"    \"Pardon, your excellency,\" continued Gregory, gratifying the  aide-de-camp with yet higher rank,--\"pardon, but it is through her  orders I am about to suffer. Perhaps she might have pity upon a wretched  servant!\"    \"Enough, enough; let us proceed,\" said the captain in an odd voice, as  though he regretted as well as the culprit that Vaninka had not shown  mercy.    \"Immediately, immediately, noble sir,\" said Ivan; then turning to  Gregory, he continued, \"Come, comrade; the time has come.\"    Gregory sighed heavily, threw a last look up at the window, and seeing  that everything remained the same there, he mustered up resolution  enough to lie down on the fatal plank. At the same time two other serfs,  chosen by Ivan for assistants, took him by the arms and attached his  wrists to two stakes, one at either side of him, so that it appeared as  though he were stretched on a cross. Then they clamped his neck into an  iron collar, and seeing that all was in readiness and that no sign  favourable to the culprit had been made from the still closely shut  window, the young aide-de-camp beckoned with his hand, saying, \"Now,  then, begin!\"    \"Patience, my lord, patience,\" said Ivan, still delaying the whipping,  in the hope that some sign might yet be made from the inexorable window.  \"I have a knot in my knout, and if I leave it Gregory will have good  right to complain.\"    The instrument with which the executioner was busying himself, and which  is perhaps unknown to our readers, was a species of whip, with a handle  about two feet long. A plaited leather thong, about four feet long and  two inches broad, was attached to this handle, this thong terminating in  an iron or copper ring, and to this another band of leather was  fastened, two feet long, and at the beginning about one and a half  inches thick: this gradually became thinner, till it ended in a point.  The thong was steeped in milk and then dried in the sun, and on account  of this method of preparation its edge became as keen and cutting as a  knife; further, the thong was generally changed at every sixth stroke,  because contact with blood softened it.    However unwillingly and clumsily Ivan set about untying the knot, it had  to come undone at last. Besides, the bystanders were beginning to  grumble, and their muttering disturbed the reverie into which the young  aide-de-camp had fallen. He raised his head, which had been sunk on his  breast, and cast a last look towards the window; then with a peremptory  sign; and in a voice which admitted of no delay, he ordered the  execution to proceed.    Nothing could put it off any longer: Ivan was obliged to obey, and he  did not attempt to find any new pretext for delay. He drew back two  paces, and with a spring he returned to his place, and standing on  tiptoe, he whirled the knout above his head, and then letting it  suddenly fall, he struck Gregory with such dexterity that the lash  wrapped itself thrice round his victim's body, encircling him like a  serpent, but the tip of the thong struck the plank upon which Gregory  was lying. Nevertheless, in spite of this precaution, Gregory uttered a  loud shriek, and Ivan counted \"One.\"    At the shriek, the young aide-de-camp again turned towards the window;  but it was still shut, and mechanically his eyes went back to the  culprit, and he repeated the word \"One.\"    The knout had traced three blue furrows on Gregory's shoulders. Ivan  took another spring, and with the same skill as"]]]
