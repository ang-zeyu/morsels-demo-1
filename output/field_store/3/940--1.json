INTRODUCTION    THE Koran admittedly occupies an important position among the great religious  books of the world. Though the youngest of the epoch-making works belonging  to this class of literature, it yields to hardly any in the wonderful effect  which it has produced on large masses of men. It has created an all but new  phase of human thought and a fresh type of character. It first transformed a  number of heterogeneous desert tribes of the Arabian peninsula into a nation  of heroes, and then proceeded to create the vast politico-religious  organisations of the Muhammedan world which are one of the great forces with  which Europe and the East have to reckon to-day.    The secret of the power exercised by the book, of course, lay in the mind  which produced it. It was, in fact, at first not a book, but a strong living  voice, a kind of wild authoritative proclamation, a series of admonitions,  promises, threats, and instructions addressed to turbulent and largely  hostile assemblies of untutored Arabs. As a book it was published after the  prophet's death. In Muhammed's life-time there were only disjointed notes,  speeches, and the retentive memories of those who listened to them. To speak  of the Koran is, therefore, practically the same as speaking of Muhammed, and  in trying to appraise the religious value of the book one is at the same time  attempting to form an opinion of the prophet himself. It would indeed be  difficult to find another case in which there is such a complete identity  between the literary work and the mind of the man who produced it.    That widely different estimates have been formed of Muhammed is well-known.  To Moslems he is, of course, the prophet par excellence, and the Koran is  regarded by the orthodox as nothing less than the eternal utterance of Allah.  The eulogy pronounced by Carlyle on Muhammed in Heroes and Hero Worship will  probably be endorsed by not a few at the present day. The extreme contrary  opinion, which in a fresh form has recently been revived1 by an able writer,  is hardly likely to find much lasting support. The correct view very probably  lies between the two extremes. The relative value of any given system of  religious thought must depend on the amount of truth which it embodies as  well as on the ethical standard which its adherents are bidden to follow.  Another important test is the degree of originality that is to be assigned to  it, for it can manifestly only claim credit for that which is new in it, not  for that which it borrowed from other systems.    With regard to the first-named criterion, there is a growing opinion among  students of religious history that Muhammed may in a real sense be regarded  as a prophet of certain truths, though by no means of truth in the absolute  meaning of the term. The shortcomings of the moral teaching contained in the  Koran are striking enough if judged from the highest ethical standpoint with  which we are acquainted; but a much more favourable view is arrived at if a  comparison is made between the ethics of the Koran and the moral tenets of  Arabian and other forms of heathenism which it supplanted.    The method followed by Muhammed in the promulgation of the Koran also  requires to be treated with discrimination. From the first flash of prophetic  inspiration which is clearly discernible in the earlier portions of the book  he, later on, frequently descended to deliberate invention and artful  rhetoric. He, in fact, accommodated his moral sense to the circumstances in  which the r\\oc\\le he had to play involved him.    On the question of originality there can hardly be two opinions now that the  Koran has been thoroughly compared with the Christian and Jewish traditions  of the time; and it is, besides some original Arabian legends, to those only  that the book stands in any close relationship. The matter is for the most  part borrowed, but the manner is all the prophet's own. This is emphatically  a case in which originality consists not so much in the creation of new  materials of thought as in the manner in which existing traditions of various  kinds are utilised and freshly blended to suit the special exigencies of the  occasion. Biblical reminiscences, Rabbinic legends, Christian traditions  mostly drawn from distorted apocryphal sources, and native heathen stories,  all first pass through the prophet's fervid mind, and thence issue in strange  new forms, tinged with poetry and enthusiasm, and well adapted to enforce his  own view of life and duty, to serve as an encouragement to his faithful  adherents, and to strike terror into the hearts of his opponents.    There is, however, apart from its religious value, a more general view from  which the book should be considered. The Koran enjoys the distinction of  having been the starting-point of a new literary and philosophical movement  which has powerfully affected the finest and most cultivated minds among both  Jews and Christians in the Middle Ages. This general progress of the  Muhammedan world has somehow been arrested, but research has shown that what  European scholars knew of Greek philosophy, of mathematics, astronomy, and  like sciences, for several centuries before the Renaissance, was, roughly  speaking, all derived from Latin treatises ultimately based on Arabic  originals; and it was the Koran which, though indirectly, gave the first  impetus to these studies among the Arabs and their allies. Linguistic  investigations, poetry, and other branches of literature, also made their  appearance soon after or simultaneously with the publication of the Koran;  and the literary movement thus initiated has resulted in some of the finest  products of genius and learning.    The style in which the Koran is written requires some special attention in  this introduction. The literary form is for the most part different from  anything else we know. In its finest passages we indeed seem to hear a voice  akin to that of the ancient Hebrew prophets, but there is much in the book  which Europeans usually regard as faulty. The tendency to repetition which is  an inherent characteristic of the Semitic mind appears here in an exaggerated  form, and there is in addition much in the Koran which strikes us as wild and  fantastic. The most unfavourable criticism ever passed on Muhammed's style  has in fact been penned by the prophet's greatest British admirer, Carlyle  himself; and there are probably many now who find themselves in the same  dilemma with that great writer.    The fault appears, however, to lie partly in our difficulty to appreciate the"]]]
