LONDON:  SAMPSON LOW, MARSTON, SEARLE & RIVINGTON,  CROWN BUILDINGS, 188 FLEET STREET.  1887.          Copyright by  JOSHUA ROSE.  1883.    PHILADELPHIA.    COLLINS, PRINTER          PREFACE.      The object of this book is to enable the beginner to learn to make  simple mechanical drawings without the aid of an instructor, and to  create an interest in the subject by giving examples such as the  machinist meets with in his every-day workshop practice. The plan of  representing in many examples the pencil lines, and numbering the order  in which they are marked, the author believes to possess great  advantages for the learner, since it is the producing of the pencil  lines that really proves the study, the inking in being merely a  curtailed repetition of the pencilling. Similarly when the drawing of a  piece, such, for example, as a fully developed screw thread, is shown  fully developed from end to end, even though the pencil lines were all  shown, yet the process of construction will be less clear than if the  process of development be shown gradually along the drawing. Thus  beginning at an end of the example the first pencil lines only may be  shown, and as the pencilling progresses to the right-hand, the  development may progress so that at the other or left-hand end, the  finished inked in and shaded thread may be shown, and between these two  ends will be found a part showing each stage of development of the  thread, all the lines being numbered in the order in which they were  marked. This prevents a confusion of lines, and makes it more easy to  follow or to copy the drawing.    It is the numerous inquiries from working machinists for a book of this  kind that have led the author to its production, which he hopes and  believes will meet the want thus indicated, giving to the learner a  sufficiently practical knowledge of mechanical drawing to enable him to  proceed further by copying such drawings as he may be able to obtain, or  by the aid of some of the more expensive and elaborate books already  published on the subject.    He believes that in learning mechanical drawing without the aid of an  instructor the chief difficulty is overcome when the learner has become  sufficiently familiar with the instruments to be enabled to use them  without hesitation or difficulty, and it is to attain this end that the  chapter on plotting mechanical motions and the succeeding examples have  been introduced; these forming studies that are easily followed by the  beginner; while sufficiently interesting to afford to the student  pleasure as well as profit.

Ltd.          FOREWORD      The story contained herein was written by Charles Dickens in 1867. It is  the second of four stories entitled \"Holiday Romance\" and was published  originally in a children's magazine in America. It purports to be written  by a child aged seven. It was republished in England in \"All the Year  Round\" in 1868. For this and four other Christmas pieces Dickens received  L1,000.    \"Holiday Romance\" was published in book form by Messrs Chapman & Hall in  1874, with \"Edwin Drood\" and other stories.    For this reprint the text of the story as it appeared in \"All the Year  Round\" has been followed.                      *       *       *       *       *      [Illustration: SEVERAL OF THE CHILDREN WERE GROWING OUT OF THEIR CLOTHES]    There was once a King, and he had a Queen; and he was the manliest of  his sex, and she was the loveliest of hers. The King was, in his private  profession, Under Government. The Queen's father had been a medical man  out of town.    They had nineteen children, and were always having more. Seventeen of  these children took care of the baby; and Alicia, the eldest, took care  of them all. Their ages varied from seven years to seven months.    Let us now resume our story.    One day the King was going to the office, when he stopped at the  fishmonger's to buy a pound and a half of salmon not too near the tail,  which the Queen (who was a careful housekeeper) had requested him to send  home. Mr Pickles, the fishmonger, said, \"Certainly, sir, is there any  other article, Good-morning.\"    The King went on towards the office in a melancholy mood, for quarter day  was such a long way off, and several of the dear children were growing out  of their clothes. He had not proceeded far, when Mr Pickles's errand-boy  came running after him, and said, \"Sir, you didn't notice the old lady in  our shop.\"    \"What old lady?\" enquired the King. \"I saw none.\"    Now, the King had not seen any old lady, because this old lady had been  invisible to him, though visible to Mr Pickles's boy. Probably because he  messed and splashed the water about to that degree, and flopped the pairs  of soles down in that violent manner, that, if she had not been visible to  him, he would have spoilt her clothes.    Just then the old lady came trotting up. She was dressed in shot-silk of  the richest quality, smelling of dried lavender.    \"King Watkins the First, I believe?\" said the old lady.    \"Watkins,\" replied the King, \"is my name.\"    \"Papa, if I am not mistaken, of the beautiful Princess Alicia?\" said the  old lady.    \"And of eighteen other darlings,\" replied the King.    \"Listen. You are going to the office,\" said the old lady.    It instantly flashed upon the King that she must be a Fairy, or how could  she know that?    \"You are right,\" said the old lady, answering his thoughts, \"I am the Good  Fairy Grandmarina. Attend. When you return home to dinner, politely invite  the Princess Alicia to have some of the salmon you bought just now.\"    \"It may disagree with her,\" said the King.    The old lady became so very angry at this absurd idea, that the King was  quite alarmed, and humbly begged her pardon.    \"We hear a great deal too much about this thing disagreeing, and that  thing disagreeing,\" said the old lady, with the greatest contempt it was  possible to express. \"Don't be greedy. I think you want it all yourself.\"    The King hung his head under this reproof, and said he wouldn't talk about  things disagreeing, any more.    \"Be good, then,\" said the Fairy Grandmarina, \"and don't! When the  beautiful Princess Alicia consents to partake of the salmon--as I think  she will--you will find she will leave a fish-bone on her plate. Tell  her to dry it, and to rub it, and to polish it till it shines like  mother-of-pearl, and to take care of it as a present from me.\"    \"Is that all?\" asked the King.    \"Don't be impatient, sir,\" returned the Fairy Grandmarina, scolding him  severely. \"Don't catch people short, before they have done speaking. Just  the way with you grown-up persons. You are always doing it.\"    The King again hung his head, and said he wouldn't do so any more.    \"Be good then,\" said the Fairy Grandmarina, \"and don't! Tell the Princess  Alicia, with my love, that the fish-bone is a magic present which can only  be used once; but that it will bring her, that once, whatever she wishes  for, PROVIDED SHE WISHES FOR IT AT THE RIGHT TIME. That is the  message. Take care of it.\"    [Illustration: HOITY TOITY ME!]    The King was beginning, \"Might I ask the reason--?\" when the Fairy became  absolutely furious.    \"_Will_ you be good, sir?\" she exclaimed, stamping her foot on the ground.  \"The reason for this, and the reason for that, indeed! You are always  wanting the reason. No reason. There! Hoity toity me! I am sick of your  grown-up reasons.\"    The King was extremely frightened by the old lady's flying into such a  passion, and said he was very sorry to have offended her, and he wouldn't  ask for reasons any more.    \"Be good then,\" said the old lady, \"and don't!\"    With those words, Grandmarina vanished, and the King went on and on and  on, till he came to the office. There he wrote and wrote and wrote, till  it was time to go home again. Then he politely invited the Princess  Alicia, as the Fairy had directed him, to partake of the salmon. And  when she had enjoyed it very much, he saw the fish-bone on her plate, as  the Fairy had told him he would, and he delivered the Fairy's message, and  the Princess Alicia took care to dry the bone, and to rub it, and to  polish it till it shone like mother-of-pearl.    [Illustration: He saw the Fish-bone on her Plate]    And so when the Queen was going to get up in the morning, she said, \"O,  dear me, dear me; my head, my head!\" and then she fainted away.    The Princess Alicia, who happened to be looking in at the chamber-door,  asking about breakfast, was very much alarmed when she saw her Royal Mamma  in this state, and she rang the bell for Peggy, which was the name of the  Lord Chamberlain. But remembering where the smelling-bottle was, she  climbed on a chair and got it, and after that she climbed on another chair  by the bedside and held the smelling-bottle to the Queen's nose, and after  that she jumped down and got some water, and after that she jumped up  again and wetted the Queen's forehead, and, in short, when the Lord  Chamberlain came in, that dear old woman said to the little Princess,  \"What a Trot you are! I couldn't have done it better myself!\"    [Illustration]    But that was not the worst of the good Queen's illness. O, no! She was  very ill indeed, for a long time. The Princess Alicia kept the seventeen  young Princes and Princesses quiet, and dressed and undressed and danced  the baby, and made the kettle boil, and heated the soup, and swept the  hearth, and poured out the medicine, and nursed the Queen, and did all  that ever she could, and was as busy busy busy, as busy could be. For  there were not many servants at that Palace, for three reasons; because  the King was short of money, because a rise in his office never seemed to  come, and because quarter day was so far off that it looked almost as far  off and as little as one of the stars.    But on the morning when the Queen fainted away, where was the magic  fish-bone? Why, there it was in the Princess Alicia's pocket. She had  almost taken it out to bring the Queen to life again, when she put it  back, and looked for the smelling-bottle.    After the Queen had come out of her swoon that morning, and was dozing,  the Princess Alicia hurried up-stairs to tell a most particular secret to  a most particularly confidential friend of hers, who was a Duchess. People  did suppose her to be a Doll; but she was really a Duchess, though nobody  knew it except the Princess.    [Illustration]    This most particular secret was a secret about the magic fish-bone, the  history of which was well known to the Duchess, because the Princess told  her everything. The Princess kneeled down by the bed on which the Duchess  was lying, full-dressed and wide awake, and whispered the secret to her.  The Duchess smiled and nodded. People might have supposed that she never  smiled and nodded, but she often did, though nobody knew it except the  Princess.    Then the Princess Alicia hurried downstairs again, to keep watch in the  Queen's room. She often kept watch by herself in the Queen's room; but  every evening, while the illness lasted, she sat there watching with the  King. And every evening the King sat looking at her with a cross look,  wondering why she never brought out the magic fish-bone. As often as she  noticed this, she ran up-stairs, whispered the secret to the Duchess over  again, and said to the Duchess besides, \"They think we children never have  a reason or a meaning!\" And the Duchess, though the most fashionable  Duchess that ever was heard of, winked her eye.    \"Alicia,\" said the King, one evening when she wished him Good Night.    \"Yes, Papa.\"    \"What is"]]]
