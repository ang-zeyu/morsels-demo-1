Recent confirmation that the United Kingdom Government  administers the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia on Cyprus  as dependencies (and not as lease areas like the US Guantanamo Bay  Naval Station in Cuba) has required a changing of their status and  their addition to the Factbook as new entities. In addition, the  European Union has been included as an \"Other\" entity at the end of the  listing. The European Union continues to accrue more nation-like  characteristics for itself and so a separate listing was deemed  appropriate. A fuller explanation may be found under the European Union  Preliminary statement.    - Along with the new entities and the regular information updates, The  World Factbook now also features five new fields. In the Economy  category, entries have been added for Current account balance,  Investment (gross fixed), Public debt, and Reserves of foreign exchange  and gold. The Transnational issues category has a new Refugees and  internally displaced persons entry.    - Revision of some individual country maps, first introduced in the  2001 edition, is continued in this edition. Several regional maps have  also been updated to reflect boundary changes and place name spelling  changes.      The World Factbook 2004 printed version provides a \"snapshot\" of the  world as of 1 January, 2004.        =====================================================================        Country Listing      [Transcriber's note: To search on a country name in this file, prefix  the name with \"@\", e.g. \"@Afghanistan\".  \"Afghanistan\" will find all  occurrences;

The object of this crowd and the centre of  attraction was a closely shut, carriage. A police official was trying to  force open the door, and two out of the four sergeants who were with him  were holding the horses back and the other two stopping the driver, who  paid no attention to their commands, but only endeavoured to urge his  horses to a gallop. The struggle had been going on same time, when  suddenly one of the doors violently pushed open, and a young officer in  the uniform of a cavalry captain jumped down, shutting the door as he  did so though not too quickly for the nearest spectators to perceive a  woman sitting at the back of the carriage. She was wrapped in cloak and  veil, and judging by the precautions she, had taken to hide her face  from every eye, she must have had her reasons for avoiding recognition.    \"Sir,\" said the young man, addressing the officer with a haughty air, \"I  presume, till I find myself mistaken, that your business is with me  alone; so I will ask you to inform me what powers you may have for thus  stopping my coach; also, since I have alighted, I desire you to give  your men orders to let the vehicle go on.\"    \"First of all,\" replied the man, by no means intimidated by these lordly  airs, but signing to his men that they must not release the coach or the  horses, \"be so good as to answer my questions.\"    \"I am attending,\" said the young man, controlling his agitation by a  visible effort.    \"Are you the Chevalier Gaudin de Sainte-Croix?\"    \"I am he.\"    \"Captain of the Tracy, regiment?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Then I arrest you in the king's name.\"    \"What powers have you?\"    \"This warrant.\"    Sainte-Croix cast a rapid glance at the paper, and instantly recognised  the signature of the minister of police: he then apparently confined his  attention to the woman who was still in the carriage; then he returned  to his first question.    \"This is all very well, sir,\" he said to the officer, \"but this warrant  contains no other name than mine, and so you have no right to expose  thus to the public gaze the lady with whom I was travelling when you  arrested me. I must beg of you to order your assistants to allow this  carriage to drive on; then take me where you please, for I am ready to  go with you.\"    To the officer this request seemed a just one: he signed to his men to  let the driver and the horses go on; and, they, who had waited only for  this, lost no time in breaking through the crowd, which melted away  before them; thus the woman escaped for whose safety the prisoner seemed  so much concerned.    Sainte-Croix kept his promise and offered no resistance; for some  moments he followed the officer, surrounded by a crowd which seemed to  have transferred all its curiosity to his account; then, at the corner  of the Quai de d'Horloge, a man called up a carriage that had not been  observed before, and Sainte-Croix took his place with the same haughty  and disdainful air that he had shown throughout the scene we have just  described. The officer sat beside him, two of his men got up behind, and  the other two, obeying no doubt their master's orders, retired with a  parting direction to the driver.    \"The Bastille!\"    Our readers will now permit us to make them more fully acquainted with  the man who is to take the first place in the story. The origin of  Gaudin de Sainte-Croix was not known: according to one tale, he was the  natural son of a great lord; another account declared that he was the  offspring of poor people, but that, disgusted with his obscure birth, he  preferred a splendid disgrace, and therefore chose to pass for what he  was not. The only certainty is that he was born at Montauban, and in  actual rank and position he was captain of the Tracy regiment. At the  time when this narrative opens, towards the end of 1665, Sainte-Croix  was about twenty-eight or thirty, a fine young man of cheerful and  lively appearance, a merry comrade at a banquet, and an excellent  captain: he took his pleasure with other men, and was so impressionable  a character that he enjoyed a virtuous project as well as any plan for a  debauch; in love he was most susceptible, and jealous to the point of  madness even about a courtesan, had she once taken his fancy; his  prodigality was princely, although he had no income; further, he was  most sensitive to slights, as all men are who, because they are placed  in an equivocal position, fancy that everyone who makes any reference to  their origin is offering an intentional insult.    We must now see by what a chain of circumstances he had arrived at his  present position. About the year 1660, Sainte-Croix, while in the army,  had made the acquaintance of the Marquis de Brinvilliers, maitre-de-camp  of the Normandy regiment.    Their age was much the same, and so was their manner of life: their  virtues and their vices were similar, and thus it happened that a mere  acquaintance grew into a friendship, and on his return from the field  the marquis introduced Sainte-Croix to his wife, and he became an  intimate of the house. The usual results followed. Madame de  Brinvilliers was then scarcely eight-and-twenty: she had married the  marquis in 1651-that is, nine years before. He enjoyed an income of  30,000 livres, to which she added her dowry of 200,000 livres, exclusive  of her expectations in the future. Her name was Marie-Madeleine; she had  a sister and two brothers: her father, M. de Dreux d'Aubray; was civil  lieutenant at the Chatelet de Paris. At the age of twenty-eight the  marquise was at the height of her beauty: her figure was small but  perfectly proportioned; her rounded face was charmingly pretty; her  features, so regular that no emotion seemed to alter their beauty,  suggested the lines of a statue miraculously endowed with life: it was  easy enough to mistake for the repose of a happy conscience the cold,  cruel calm which served as a mask to cover remorse.    Sainte-Croix and the marquise loved at first sight, and she was soon his  mistress. The marquis, perhaps endowed with the conjugal philosophy  which alone pleased the taste of the period, perhaps too much occupied  with his own pleasure to see what was going on before his eyes, offered  no jealous obstacle to the intimacy, and continued his foolish  extravagances long after they had impaired his fortunes: his affairs  became so entangled that the marquise, who cared for him no longer, and  desired a fuller liberty for the indulgence of her new passion, demanded  and obtained a separation. She then left her husband's house, and  henceforth abandoning all discretion, appeared everywhere in public with  Sainte-Croix. This behaviour, authorised as it was by the example of the  highest nobility, made no impression upon the. Marquis of Brinvilliers,  who merrily pursued the road to ruin, without worrying about his wife's  behaviour. Not so M. de Dreux d'Aubray: he had the scrupulosity of a  legal dignitary. He was scandalised at his daughter's conduct, and  feared a stain upon his own fair name: he procured a warrant for the  arrest of Sainte-Croix wheresoever the bearer might chance to encounter  him. We have seen how it was put in execution when Sainte-Croix was  driving in the carriage of the marquise, whom our readers will doubtless  have recognised as the woman who concealed herself so carefully.    From one's knowledge of the character of Sainte-Croix, it is easy to  imagine that he had to use great self-control to govern the anger he  felt at being arrested in the middle of the street; thus, although  during the whole drive he uttered not a single word, it was plain to see  that a terrible storm was gathering, soon to break. But he preserved the  same impossibility both at the opening and shutting of the fatal gates,  which, like the gates of hell, had so often bidden those who entered  abandon all hope on their threshold, and again when he replied to the  formal questions put to him by the governor. His voice was calm, and  when they gave him they prison register he signed it with a steady hand.  At once a gaoler, taking his orders from the governor, bade him follow:  after traversing various corridors, cold and damp, where the daylight  might sometimes enter but fresh air never, he opened a door, and  Sainte-Croix had no sooner entered than he heard it locked behind him.    At the grating of the lock he turned. The gaoler had left him with no  light but the rays of the moon, which, shining through a barred window  some eight or ten feet from the ground, shed a gleam upon a miserable  truckle-bed and left the rest of the room in deep obscurity. The  prisoner stood still for a moment and listened; then, when he had heard  the steps die away in the distance and knew himself to be alone at last,  he fell upon the bed with a cry more like the roaring of a wild beast  than any human sound: he cursed his fellow-man who had snatched him from  his joyous life to plunge him into a dungeon; he cursed his God who had  let this happen; he cried aloud to whatever powers might be that could  grant him revenge and liberty.    Just at that moment, as though summoned by these words from the bowels  of the earth, a man slowly stepped into the circle of blue light that  fell from the window-a man thin and pale, a man with long hair, in a  black doublet, who approached the foot of the bed where Sainte-Croix  lay. Brave as he was, this apparition so fully answered to his prayers  "]]]
