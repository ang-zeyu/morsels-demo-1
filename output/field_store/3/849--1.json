Maude was moving  briskly about the room, putting it into the beautiful order that  Mother insisted on. It was Nan's week to care for their room, but Nan  had sprained her ankle three days ago and could do nothing but lie on  the sofa ever since. And very tired of it, too, was wide-awake, active  Nan.    \"And the picnic this afternoon, too!\" she sighed. \"I've looked forward  to it all summer. And it's a perfect day--and I've got to stay here  and nurse this foot.\"    Nan looked vindictively at the bandaged member, while Maude leaned out  of the window to pull a pink climbing rose. As she did so she nodded  to someone in the village street below.    \"Who is passing?\" asked Nan.    \"Florrie Hamilton.\"    \"Is she going to the picnic?\" asked Nan indifferently.    \"No. She wasn't asked. Of course, I don't suppose she expected to be.  She knows she isn't in our set. She must feel horribly out of place at  school. A lot of the girls say it is ridiculous of her father to send  her to Miss Braxton's private school--a factory overseer's daughter.\"    \"She ought to have been asked to the picnic all the same,\" said Nan  shortly. \"She is in our class if she isn't in our set. Of course I  don't suppose she would have enjoyed herself--or even gone at all, for  that matter. She certainly doesn't push herself in among us. One would  think she hadn't a tongue in her head.\"    \"She is the best student in the class,\" admitted Maude, arranging her  roses in a vase and putting them on the table at Nan's elbow. \"But  Patty Morrison and Wilhelmina Patterson had the most to say about the  invitations, and they wouldn't have her. There, Nannie dear, aren't  those lovely? I'll leave them here to be company for you.\"    \"I'm going to have more company than that,\" said Nan, thumping her  pillow energetically. \"I'm not going to mope here alone all the  afternoon, with you off having a jolly time at the picnic. Write a  little note for me to Florrie Hastings, will you? I'll do as much for  you when you sprain your foot.\"    \"What shall I put in it?\" said Maude, rummaging out her portfolio  obligingly.    \"Oh, just ask her if she will come down and cheer a poor invalid up  this afternoon. She'll come, I know. And she is such good company. Get  Dickie to run right out and mail it.\"    \"I do wonder if Florrie Hamilton will feel hurt over not being asked  to the picnic,\" speculated Maude absently as she slipped her note into  an envelope and addressed it.    Florrie Hamilton herself could best have answered that question as she  walked along the street in the fresh morning sunshine. She did feel  hurt--much more keenly than she would acknowledge even to herself. It  was not that she cared about the picnic itself: as Nan Wallace had  said, she would not have been likely to enjoy herself if she had gone  among a crowd of girls many of whom looked down on her and ignored  her. But to be left out when every other girl in the school was  invited! Florrie's lip quivered as she thought of it.    \"I'll get Father to let me to go to the public school after vacation,\"  she murmured. \"I hate going to Miss Braxton's.\"    Florrie was a newcomer in Winboro. Her father had recently come to  take a position in the largest factory of the small town. For this  reason Florrie was slighted at school by some of the ruder girls and  severely left alone by most of the others. Some, it is true, tried at  the start to be friends, but Florrie, too keenly sensitive to the  atmosphere around her to respond, was believed to be decidedly dull  and mopy. She retreated further and further into herself and was  almost as solitary at Miss Braxton's as if she had been on a desert  island.    \"They don't like me because I am plainly dressed and because my father  is not a wealthy man,\" thought Florrie bitterly. And there was enough  truth in this in regard to many of Miss Braxton's girls to make a very  uncomfortable state of affairs.    \"Here's a letter for you, Flo,\" said her brother Jack at noon. \"Got it  at the office on my way home. Who is your swell correspondent?\"    Florrie opened the dainty, perfumed note and read it with a face that,  puzzled at first, suddenly grew radiant.    \"Listen, Jack,\" she said excitedly.        \"Dear Florrie:        \"Nan is confined to house, room, and sofa with a sprained      foot. As she will be all alone this afternoon, won't you come      down and spend it with her? She very much wants you to      come--she is so lonesome and thinks you will be just the one      to cheer her up.                                     \"Yours cordially,                                      \"Maude Wallace.\"    \"Are you going?\" asked Jack.    \"Yes--I don't know--I'll think about it,\" said Florrie absently. Then  she hurried upstairs to her room.    \"Shall I go?\" she thought. \"Yes, I will. I dare say Nan has asked me  just out of pity because I was not invited to the picnic. But even so  it was sweet of her. I've always thought I would like those Wallace  girls if I could get really acquainted with them. They've always been  nice to me, too--I don't know why I am always so tongue-tied and  stupid with them. But I'll go anyway.\"    That afternoon Mrs. Wallace came into Nan's room.    \"Nan, dear, Florrie Hamilton is downstairs asking for you.\"    \"Florrie--Hamilton?\"    \"Yes. She said something about a note you sent her this morning. Shall  I ask her to come up?\"    \"Yes, of course,\" said Nan lamely. When her mother had gone out she  fell back on her pillows and thought rapidly.    \"Florrie Hamilton! Maude must have addressed that note to her by  mistake. But she mustn't know it was a mistake--mustn't suspect it.  Oh, dear! What shall I ever find to talk to her about? She is so quiet  and shy.\"    Further reflections were cut short by Florrie's entrance. Nan held out  her hand with a chummy smile.    \"It's good of you to give your afternoon up to visiting a cranky  invalid,\" she said heartily. \"You don't know how lonesome I've been  since Maude went away. Take off your hat and pick out the nicest chair  you can find, and let's be comfy.\"    Somehow, Nan's frank greeting did away with Florrie's embarrassment  and made her feel at home. She sat down in Maude's rocker, then,  glancing over to a vase filled with roses, her eyes kindled with  pleasure. Seeing this, Nan said, \"Aren't they lovely? We Wallaces are  very fond of our climbing roses. Our great-grandmother brought the  roots out from England with her sixty years ago, and they grow nowhere  else in this country.\"    \"I know,\" said Florrie, with a smile. \"I recognized them as soon as I  came into the room. They are the same kind of roses as those which  grow about Grandmother Hamilton's house in England. I used to love  them so.\"    \"In England! Were you ever in England?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" laughed Florrie. \"And I've been in pretty nearly every  other country upon earth--every one that a ship could get to, at  least.\"    \"Why, Florrie Hamilton! Are you in earnest?\"    \"Indeed, yes. Perhaps you don't know that our 'now-mother,' as Jack  says sometimes, is Father's second wife. My own mother died when I was  a baby, and my aunt, who had no children of her own, took me to bring  up. Her husband was a sea-captain, and she always went on his  sea-voyages with him. So I went too. I almost grew up on shipboard. We  had delightful times. I never went to school. Auntie had been a  teacher before her marriage, and she taught me. Two years ago, when I  was fourteen, Father married again, and then he wanted"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24876"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1905 to 1906 (#1)"],[1,"Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1905 to 1906      Lucy Maud Montgomery was born at Clifton (now New London), Prince  Edward Island, Canada, on November 30, 1874.

She had milked eight cows and  pumped water for the milk-cans afterward in the fag-end of a hot  summer day. She did that every night, but tonight she had hurried more  than usual because she wanted to get her letter written before the  early farm bedtime. She had been thinking it out while she milked the  cows in the stuffy little pen behind the barn. This monthly letter was  the only pleasure and stimulant in her life. Existence would have  been, so Sidney thought, a dreary, unbearable blank without it. She  cast aside her milking-dress with a thrill of distaste that tingled to  her rosy fingertips. As she slipped into her blue-print afternoon  dress her aunt called to her from below. Sidney ran out to the dark  little entry and leaned over the stair railing. Below in the kitchen  there was a hubbub of laughing, crying, quarrelling children, and a  reek of bad tobacco smoke drifted up to the girl's disgusted nostrils.    Aunt Jane was standing at the foot of the stairs with a lamp in one  hand and a year-old baby clinging to the other. She was a big  shapeless woman with a round good-natured face--cheerful and vulgar as  a sunflower was Aunt Jane at all times and occasions.    \"I want to run over and see how Mrs. Brixby is this evening, Siddy,  and you must take care of the baby till I get back.\"    Sidney sighed and went downstairs for the baby. It never would have  occurred to her to protest or be petulant about it. She had all her  aunt's sweetness of disposition, if she resembled her in nothing else.  She had not grumbled because she had to rise at four that morning, get  breakfast, milk the cows, bake bread, prepare seven children for  school, get dinner, preserve twenty quarts of strawberries, get tea,  and milk the cows again. All her days were alike as far as hard work  and dullness went, but she accepted them cheerfully and  uncomplainingly. But she did resent having to look after the baby when  she wanted to write her letter.    She carried the baby to her room, spread a quilt on the floor for him  to sit on, and gave him a box of empty spools to play with.  Fortunately he was a phlegmatic infant, fond of staying in one place,  and not given to roaming about in search of adventures; but Sidney  knew she would have to keep an eye on him, and it would be distracting  to literary effort.    She got out her box of paper and sat down by the little table at the  window with a small kerosene lamp at her elbow. The room was small--a  mere box above the kitchen which Sidney shared with two small cousins.  Her bed and the cot where the little girls slept filled up almost all  the available space. The furniture was poor, but everything was  neat--it was the only neat room in the house, indeed, for tidiness was  no besetting virtue of Aunt Jane's.    Opposite Sidney was a small muslined and befrilled toilet-table, above  which hung an eight-by-six-inch mirror, in which Sidney saw herself  reflected as she devoutly hoped other people did not see her. Just at  that particular angle one eye appeared to be as large as an orange,  while the other was the size of a pea, and the mouth zigzagged from  ear to ear. Sidney hated that mirror as virulently as she could hate  anything. It seemed to her to typify all that was unlovely in her  life. The mirror of existence into which her fresh young soul had  looked for twenty years gave back to her wistful gaze just such  distortions of fair hopes and ideals.    Half of the little table by which she sat was piled high with  books--old books, evidently well read and well-bred books, classics of  fiction and verse every one of them, and all bearing on the flyleaf  the name of Sidney Richmond, thereby meaning not the girl at the  table, but her college-bred young father who had died the day before  she was born. Her mother had died the day after, and Sidney thereupon  had come into the hands of good Aunt Jane, with those books for her  dowry, since nothing else was left after the expenses of the double  funeral had been paid.    One of the books had Sidney Richmond's name printed on the title-page  instead of written on the flyleaf. It was a thick little volume of  poems, published in his college days--musical, unsubstantial, pretty  little poems, every one of which the girl Sidney loved and knew by  heart.    Sidney dropped her pointed chin in her hands and looked dreamily out  into the moonlit night, while she thought her letter out a little more  fully before beginning to write. Her big brown eyes were full of  wistfulness and romance; for Sidney was romantic, albeit a faithful  and understanding acquaintance with her father's books had given to  her romance refinement and reason, and the delicacy of her own nature  had imparted to it a self-respecting bias.    Presently she began to write, with a flush of real excitement on her  face. In the middle of things the baby choked on a small twist spool  and Sidney had to catch him up by the heels and hold him head downward  until the trouble was ejected. Then she had to soothe him, and finally  write the rest of her letter holding him on one arm and protecting the  epistle from the grabs of his sticky little fingers. It was certainly  letter-writing under difficulties, but Sidney seemed to deal with them  mechanically. Her soul and understanding were elsewhere.    Four years before, when Sidney was sixteen, still calling herself a  schoolgirl by reason of the fact that she could be spared to attend  school four months in the winter when work was slack, she had been  much interested in the \"Maple Leaf\" department of the Montreal weekly  her uncle took. It was a page given over to youthful Canadians and  filled with their contributions in the way of letters, verses, and  prize essays. Noms de plume were signed to these, badges were sent to  those who joined the Maple Leaf Club, and a general delightful sense  of mystery pervaded the department.    Often a letter concluded with a request to the club members to  correspond with the writer. One such request went from Sidney under  the pen-name of \"Ellen Douglas.\" The girl was lonely in Plainfield;  she had no companions or associates such as she cared for; the Maple  Leaf Club represented all that her life held of outward interest, and  she longed for something more.    Only one answer came to \"Ellen Douglas,\" and that was forwarded to her  by the long-suffering editor of \"The Maple Leaf.\" It was from John  Lincoln of the Bar N Ranch, Alberta. He wrote that, although his age  debarred him from membership in the club (he was twenty, and the limit  was eighteen), he read the letters of the department with much  interest, and often had thought of answering some of the requests for  correspondents.
