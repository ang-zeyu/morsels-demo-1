URBAN      INTRODUCTION      The following account is a summary of the present knowledge of the  birds of Coahuila. Some 500 specimens from Coahuila in the Museum of  Natural History at the University of Kansas are the basis for this  report; these are supplemented by records of birds previously listed  from the State.    In Coahuila, habitats vary from those characteristic near tree-line to  those of the floors of the low deserts. Because of the variety of  habitats, many kinds of birds are present in the State; at least 312  living named kinds of 249 species have been recorded. Possibly another  100 species will be reported after further studies have been made  there. At least 154 of the species listed in this paper probably breed  in Coahuila. The bird fauna in the State includes species characteristic  of eastern North America and of western North America, species that  range from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, and species found only,  or mostly, in Mexico.    I thank Professor E. Raymond Hall, Doctor Richard F. Johnston and  Doctor Robert M. Mengel for their kind help, and Doctor Harrison B.  Tordoff for first suggesting this study to me. Unless otherwise stated,  the nomenclature in this paper is that of the A.O.U. Check-list  Committee (1957). Catalogue numbers are those of the Museum of Natural  History at the University of Kansas. In so far as known to me, all  birds recorded in the literature from Coahuila are listed below. In a  few instances the only support for occurrence is the ascription of a  given kind to Coahuila (without mention of date, catalogue number, or  precise locality) by Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1950), and/or the  A.O.U. Check-list Committee (1957); when this is so the entire entry is  inclosed within brackets. In the accounts beyond, an asterisk indicates  that the kind breeds in Coahuila; two asterisks indicate probable  breeding in the State.

Casting on with Two Needles]    The first thing to be done in knitting is to cast on or, as it is  sometimes called, to \"set up the foundation.\" (Figure 1). There are  several methods for this, the following being that preferred and  generally used by the writer: Leave a spare end of thread, sufficient  for the number of stitches you wish to cast on, lying toward the left,  the spool or ball from which the working-thread is drawn being at the  right. Lay the thread between the little finger and the third of the  left hand; bring the working-thread across the palm of the hand, around  the thumb and back between the forefinger and second finger; bend the  forefinger over this thread (which passes between it and the second  finger), pass it under the thread which crosses the palm of the hand,  and then draw the forefinger back, or straighten it, which will give you  a loop with crossed threads. Put the needle under the lower part of this  loop, which draws from the ball, bring the working-thread (or  ball-thread) around the point of needle from right to left, as in plain  knitting, draw it back through the loop, slip off the latter, and draw  up the left thread. Then proceed to make the crossed loop and knit it  off in the same way for the next and following stitches. The whole  operation is very simple, although the instructions seem long because  explicit. Take your needle and yarn or thread and follow them through  carefully, and you will very soon master the \"crossed casting on.\"    Another method, preferred by many and practically the same in effect,  except that the edge is not quite so firm, is as follows: Loop the  thread around the left forefinger, holding the spare end between thumb  and second finger, pass the needle upward through the loop, pass the  thread around the point, draw back through the loop, slip off the latter  and pull up the spare thread. By passing the needle under the loop, or  lower thread, instead of through it, bringing it back through, and then  knitting off, you will really get the crossed loop, and many find this  method easier than the first. The thread used in casting on may be  doubled, particularly for beginning a stocking, mitten, or any article  where much wear comes.    Casting on may also be done with two needles, and many like this method  when there are many stitches. Twist a loop around the needle held in the  left hand, bring the end of thread, or spare thread, to the front,  crossing the working-thread to hold it in place--or, if preferred,  simply tie a slip-knot and put the loop on the left needle; insert the  right needle through this loop from left to right, put thread around  point of right needle and draw through the loop, bringing the right  needle again in front of left. Thus far, the process is quite like that  of plain knitting. Keeping the right needle still in the new stitch or  loop, transfer the stitch to the left needle by bringing the latter in  front and putting the point through the loop from front to back, leaving  the right needle in place for the next stitch; the loops are not slipped  off, as in knitting plain, but transferred, so that all are kept on the  needle. A little practise will enable one to cast on thus very rapidly  and evenly.    [Illustration: Figure 2. Knitting Plain]    The plain knitting (Figure 2), is done as follows: Having cast on the  requisite number of stitches, insert the right needle through the front  of left needle from left to right, the right needle passing behind the  left; carry the thread around point of right needle and bring it down  between the two needles, then draw the point of right needle back and  through the stitch, forming the new stitch on right needle and letting  the other slip off the left, pushing down the point of left needle to  facilitate this process; repeat until all the stitches are knitted off  and the row is complete. Where there are edges to be joined, as in  knitting back and fronts of a sweater, it is a good plan to slip the  first stitch of each row.    Right here a suggestion about the method of holding the thread may be of  value: By the first method the thread is carried over the little finger  of right hand, under second and third fingers and over the tip of the  forefinger, which should be held close to the work; it is this finger  which passes the thread over point of right needle for the new stitch.  By another method the thread is carried over the left forefinger, under  second and third and over the little finger, exactly as it is held for  crocheting: insert the right needle through 1st stitch on left needle in  usual way, push it over the thread on left forefinger, and draw this  back through the stitch with the point of right needle. Only the needle  is held in the right hand, and many workers claim that the work is much  more rapidly done.    [Illustration: Figure 3. Purling]    The purl- or seam-stitch (Figure 3) is the exact reverse of plain  knitting, both as to method of work and appearance, being in reality the  wrong side of plain knitting. In the latter the thread is kept at the  back of the work; for purling, bring it to the front between the two  needles. Put the point of right needle through the front of 1st stitch  on left needle from right to left, the right needle being thus brought  in front of the left; pass the thread around the front of right needle  from right to left and back between needles, then push down the point  and draw the loop backward through the stitch, instead of forward, as in  plain knitting, the right needle being thus brought behind the left.  Slip off the old stitch as usual, and take care to return the thread to  its place at the back before beginning to knit plain again.    [Illustration: Figure 4. Garter-Stitch, or Ridge-Stitch]    Garter-stitch, so called (Figure 4) is simply plain knitting back and  forth, which gives the effect of ridges, one row knit, the next purled.  This is a stitch much used for sweaters, and other knitted garments. If  one wishes to have the right side appear as in plain knitting, the 1st  row must be knitted plain, the next purled. Since one is the reverse of  the other, the right side will be plain knitting, the wrong side  purled.    [Illustration: Figure 5. The Double Rib]    The rib-stitch is alternately plain and purled. To knit the single rib,  * knit 1, purl 1; repeat. For double rib, (Figure 5,) * knit 2, purl 2;  repeat; and for triple-rib, * knit 3, purl 3; repeat. Any width of rib  may be made that is liked, always taking care--unless knitting in  rounds, as a wristlet, mitten or stocking--to knit the stitches purled  on the preceding row, and purl the knitted ones. There are a large  variety of fancy patterns made by combining plain knitting and purling,  such as the basket-stitch and others, of even or broken \"check.\"    There are many variations of the simplest stitches; for example, the  common garter-stitch gives a particularly good effect if knitted from  the back. Put the needle in from right to left, through the back part of  the stitch to be knitted; leave the thread behind the needle, then pass  it from right to left over the needle and draw it through the stitch,  allowing the latter to slip off as in plain knitting. In this stitch the  two threads of the loop are crossed, instead of lying side by side as in  plain knitting.    [Illustration: Figure 6. Making \"Overs\"]    \"Overs\" (Figure 6) are used in all lace patterns, and many times in  fancy designs for wool knitting. To make an \"over\" bring the thread  before the needle as if to purl, then knit the next stitch plain as  usual. This brings a loop over the needle, which in the next row is to  be knitted as any stitch, thus increasing the number of stitches in the  row. In case it is not desired to increase the stitches, one must  narrow, by knitting two stitches together, once for every \"over.\" If a  larger hole is wanted, the thread is put twice over the needle, and in  the following one of these loops is knitted, the other purled.    To \"purl-narrow,\" or purl two together, bring the thread to the front as  for purling, then to form the extra stitch, carry the thread back over  the needle and to the front again; then insert the right needle through  two stitches instead of one, and knit them as one stitch. \"Fagot\" is an  abbreviation frequently used for this.
