Once more he yawned, and slowly  got to his feet and shook himself. Then he walked over to a big  pine-tree, stood up on his hind legs, reached as high up on the trunk of  the tree as he could, and scratched the bark with his great claws. After  that he yawned until it seemed as if his jaws would crack, and then sat  down to think what he wanted for breakfast.    While he sat there, trying to make up his mind what would taste best, he  was listening to the sounds that told of the waking of all the little  people who live in the Green Forest. He heard Sammy Jay way off in the  distance screaming, \"Thief! Thief!\" and grinned. \"I wonder,\" thought  Buster, \"if some one has stolen Sammy's breakfast, or if he has stolen  the breakfast of some one else. Probably he is the thief himself.\"    He heard Chatterer the Red Squirrel scolding as fast as he could make  his tongue go and working himself into a terrible rage. \"Must be that  Chatterer got out of bed the wrong way this morning,\" thought he.    He heard Blacky the Crow cawing at the top of his lungs, and he knew by  the sound that Blacky was getting into mischief of some kind. He heard  the sweet voices of happy little singers, and they were good to hear.  But most of all he listened to a merry, low, silvery laugh that never  stopped but went on and on, until he just felt as if he must laugh too.  It was the voice of the Laughing Brook. And as Buster listened it  suddenly came to him just what he wanted for breakfast.    \"I'm going fishing,\" said he in his deep grumbly-rumbly voice to no one  in particular. \"Yes, Sir, I'm going fishing. I want some fat trout for  my breakfast.\"    He shuffled along over to the Laughing Brook, and straight to a little  pool of which he knew, and as he drew near he took the greatest care not  to make the teeniest, weeniest bit of noise. Now it just happened that  early as he was, some one was before Buster Bear. When he came in sight  of the little pool, who should he see but another fisherman there, who  had already caught a fine fat trout. Who was it? Why, Little Joe Otter  to be sure. He was just climbing up the bank with the fat trout in his  mouth. Buster Bear's own mouth watered as he saw it. Little Joe sat down  on the bank and prepared to enjoy his breakfast. He hadn't seen Buster  Bear, and he didn't know that he or any one else was anywhere near.    Buster Bear tiptoed up very softly until he was right behind Little Joe  Otter. \"Woof, woof!\" said he in his deepest, most grumbly-rumbly voice.  \"That's a very fine looking trout. I wouldn't mind if I had it myself.\"    Little Joe Otter gave a frightened squeal and without even turning to  see who was speaking dropped his fish and dived headfirst into the  Laughing Brook. Buster Bear sprang forward and with one of his big paws  caught the fat trout just as it was slipping back into the water.    \"Here's your trout, Mr. Otter,\" said he, as Little Joe put his head out  of water to see who had frightened him so. \"Come and get it.\"    [Illustration: \"Here's your trout, Mr. Otter,\" said he. _Page 5._]    But Little Joe wouldn't. The fact is, he was afraid to. He snarled at  Buster Bear and called him a thief and everything bad he could think of.  Buster didn't seem to mind. He chuckled as if he thought it all a great  joke and repeated his invitation to Little Joe to come and get his fish.  But Little Joe just turned his back and went off down the Laughing Brook  in a great rage.    \"It's too bad to waste such a fine fish,\" said Buster thoughtfully. \"I  wonder what I'd better do with it.\" And while he was wondering, he ate  it all up. Then he started down the Laughing Brook to try to catch some  for himself.          II    LITTLE JOE OTTER GETS EVEN WITH BUSTER BEAR      Little Joe Otter was in a terrible rage. It was a bad beginning for a  beautiful day and Little Joe knew it. But who wouldn't be in a rage if  his breakfast was taken from him just as he was about to eat it? Anyway,  that is what Little Joe told Billy Mink. Perhaps he didn't tell it quite  exactly as it was, but you know he was very badly frightened at the  time.    \"I was sitting on the bank of the Laughing Brook beside one of the  little pools,\" he told Billy Mink, \"and was just going to eat a fat  trout I had caught, when who should come along but that great big  bully, Buster Bear. He took that fat trout away from me and ate it just  as if it belonged to him! I hate him! If I live long enough I'm going to  get even with him!\"    Of course that wasn't nice talk and anything but a nice spirit, but  Little Joe Otter's temper is sometimes pretty short, especially when he  is hungry, and this time he had had no breakfast, you know.    Buster Bear hadn't actually taken the fish away from Little Joe. But  looking at the matter as Little Joe did, it amounted to the same thing.  You see, Buster knew perfectly well when he invited Little Joe to come  back and get it that Little Joe wouldn't dare do anything of the kind.    \"Where is he now?\" asked Billy Mink.    \"He's somewhere up the Laughing Brook. I wish he'd fall in and get  drowned!\" snapped Little Joe.    Billy Mink just had to laugh. The idea of great big Buster Bear getting  drowned in the Laughing Brook was too funny. There wasn't water enough  in it anywhere except down in the Smiling Pool, and that was on the  Green Meadows, where Buster had never been known to go. \"Let's go see  what he is doing,\" said Billy Mink.    At first Little Joe didn't want to, but at last his curiosity got the  better of his fear, and he agreed. So the two little brown-coated scamps  turned down the Laughing Brook, taking the greatest care to keep out of  sight themselves. They had gone only a little way when Billy Mink  whispered: \"Sh-h! There he is.\"    Sure enough, there was Buster Bear sitting close beside a little pool  and looking into it very intently.    \"What's he doing?\" asked Little Joe Otter, as Buster Bear sat for the  longest time without moving.    Just then one of Buster's big paws went into the water as quick as a  flash and scooped out a trout that had ventured too near.    \"He's fishing!\" exclaimed Billy Mink.    And that is just what Buster Bear was doing, and it was very plain to  see that he was having great fun. When he had eaten the trout he had  caught, he moved along to the next little pool.    \"They are _our_ fish!\" said Little Joe fiercely. \"He has no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22822"],[0,"The Superstitions of Witchcraft (#1)"],[1,"Transcriber's notes       The \"oe\" ligature is represented as [oe].

London  Printed by Spottiswoode and Co.  New-Street Square      THE SUPERSTITIONS OF WITCHCRAFT.    by    HOWARD WILLIAMS, M.A.    St. John's College, Cambridge.    'Somnia, terrores magicos, miracula, sagas,   Nocturnos lemures, portentaque Thessala rides?'                London:  Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, & Green.  1865.          PREFACE.      'THE SUPERSTITIONS OF WITCHCRAFT' is designed to exhibit a  consecutive review of the characteristic forms and facts of a  creed which (if at present apparently dead, or at least harmless,  in Christendom) in the seventeenth century was a living and  lively faith, and caused thousands of victims to be sent to the  torture-chamber, to the stake, and to the scaffold. At this day,  the remembrance of its superhuman art, in its different  manifestations, is immortalised in the every-day language of the  peoples of Europe.           *       *       *       *       *    The belief in Witchcraft is, indeed, in its full development and  most fearful results, modern still more than mediaeval, Christian  still more than Pagan, and Protestant not less than Catholic.
