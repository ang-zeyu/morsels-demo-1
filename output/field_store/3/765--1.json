DEDICATED, BY PERMISSION,                    TO      MAJOR-GENERAL LORD ROKEBY, K.C.B.,             BY HIS LORDSHIP'S      HUMBLE AND MOST GRATEFUL SERVANT,                          MARY SEACOLE.          TO THE READER.      I should have thought that no preface would have been required to  introduce Mrs. Seacole to the British public, or to recommend a book  which must, from the circumstances in which the subject of it was  placed, be unique in literature.    If singleness of heart, true charity, and Christian works; if trials  and sufferings, dangers and perils, encountered boldly by a helpless  woman on her errand of mercy in the camp and in the battle-field, can  excite sympathy or move curiosity, Mary Seacole will have many friends  and many readers.    She is no Anna Comnena, who presents us with a verbose history, but a  plain truth-speaking woman, who has lived an adventurous life amid  scenes which have never yet found a historian among the actors on the  stage where they passed.    I have witnessed her devotion and her courage; I have already borne  testimony to her services to all who needed them. She is the first who  has redeemed the name of \"sutler\" from the suspicion of worthlessness,  mercenary baseness, and plunder; and I trust that England will not  forget one who nursed her sick, who sought out her wounded to aid and  succour them, and who performed the last offices for some of her  illustrious dead.

SEACOLE  IN MANY LANDS.          CHAPTER I.        MY BIRTH AND PARENTAGE--EARLY TASTES AND      TRAVELS--MARRIAGE, AND WIDOWHOOD.      I was born in the town of Kingston, in the island of Jamaica, some  time in the present century. As a female, and a widow, I may be well  excused giving the precise date of this important event. But I do not  mind confessing that the century and myself were both young together,  and that we have grown side by side into age and consequence. I am a  Creole, and have good Scotch blood coursing in my veins. My father was  a soldier, of an old Scotch family; and to him I often trace my  affection for a camp-life, and my sympathy with what I have heard my  friends call \"the pomp, pride, and circumstance of glorious war.\" Many  people have also traced to my Scotch blood that energy and activity  which are not always found in the Creole race, and which have carried  me to so many varied scenes: and perhaps they are right. I have often  heard the term \"lazy Creole\" applied to my country people; but I am  sure I do not know what it is to be indolent. All my life long I have  followed the impulse which led me to be up and doing; and so far from  resting idle anywhere, I have never wanted inclination to rove, nor  will powerful enough to find a way to carry out my wishes. That these  qualities have led me into many countries, and brought me into some  strange and amusing adventures, the reader, if he or she has the  patience to get through this book, will see. Some people, indeed, have  called me quite a female Ulysses. I believe that they intended it as a  compliment; but from my experience of the Greeks, I do not consider it  a very flattering one.    It is not my intention to dwell at any length upon the recollections  of my childhood. My mother kept a boarding-house in Kingston, and was,  like very many of the Creole women, an admirable doctress; in high  repute with the officers of both services, and their wives, who were  from time to time stationed at Kingston. It was very natural that I  should inherit her tastes; and so I had from early youth a yearning  for medical knowledge and practice which has never deserted me. When I  was a very young child I was taken by an old lady, who brought me up  in her household among her own grandchildren, and who could scarcely  have shown me more kindness had I been one of them; indeed, I was so  spoiled by my kind patroness that, but for being frequently with my  mother, I might very likely have grown up idle and useless. But I saw  so much of her, and of her patients, that the ambition to become a  doctress early took firm root in my mind; and I was very young when I  began to make use of the little knowledge I had acquired from watching  my mother, upon a great sufferer--my doll. I have noticed always what  actors children are. If you leave one alone in a room, how soon it  clears a little stage; and, making an audience out of a few chairs and  stools, proceeds to act its childish griefs and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23033"],[0,"Classic French Course in English (#1)"],[1,"=_THE AFTER-SCHOOL SERIES._=    CLASSIC FRENCH COURSE    IN ENGLISH.

BOSTON.          PREFACE.      The preparation of the present volume proposed to the author a task more  difficult far than that undertaken in any one of the four preceding  volumes of the group, THE AFTER-SCHOOL SERIES, to which it belongs.  Those volumes dealt with literatures limited and finished: this volume  deals with a literature indefinitely vast in extent, and still in vital  process of growth. The selection of material to be used was, in the case  of the earlier volumes, virtually made for the author beforehand, in a  manner greatly to ease his sense of responsibility for the exercise of  individual judgment and taste. Long prescription, joined to the  winnowing effect of wear and waste through time and chance, had left  little doubt what works of what writers, Greek and Roman, best deserved  now to be shown to the general reader. Besides this, the prevalent  custom of the schools of classical learning could then wisely be taken  as a clew of guidance to be implicitly followed, whatever might be the  path through which it should lead. There is here no similar avoidance of  responsibility possible; for the schools have not established a custom,  and French literature is a living body, from which no important members  have ever yet been rent by the ravages of time.    The greater difficulty seen thus to inhere already in the nature itself  of the task proposed for accomplishment, was gravely increased by the  much more severe compression deemed to be in the present instance  desirable. The room placed at the author's disposal for a display of  French literature was less than half the room allowed him for the  display of either the Greek or the Latin.    The plan, therefore, of this volume, imposed the necessity of  establishing from the outset certain limits, to be very strictly  observed. First, it was resolved to restrict the attention bestowed upon  the national history, the national geography, and the national language,  of the French, to such brief occasional notices as, in the course of the  volume, it might seem necessary, for illustration of the particular  author, from time to time to make. The only introductory general matter  here to be found will accordingly consist of a rapid and summary review  of that literature, as a whole, which is the subject of the book. It was  next determined to limit the authors selected for representation to  those of the finished centuries. A third decision was to make the number  of authors small rather than large, choice rather than inclusive. The  principle at this point adopted, was to choose those authors only whose  merit, or whose fame, or whose influence, might be supposed  unquestionably such that their names and their works would certainly be  found surviving, though the language in which they wrote should, like  its parent Latin, have perished from the tongues of men. The proportion  of space severally allotted to the different authors was to be measured  partly according to their relative importance, and partly according to  their estimated relative capacity of interesting in translation the  average intelligent reader of to-day.    In one word, the single inspiring aim of the author has here been to  furnish enlightened readers, versed only in the English language, the  means of acquiring, through the medium of their vernacular, some  proportioned, trustworthy, and effective knowledge and appreciation, in  its chief classics, of the great literature which has been written in  French. This object has been sought, not through narrative and  description, making books and authors the subject, but through the  literature itself, in specimen extracts illuminated by the necessary  explanation and criticism.    It is proposed to follow the present volume with a volume similar in  general character, devoted to German literature.          CONTENTS.

FRENCH LITERATURE.      Of French literature, taken as a whole, it may boldly be said that it  is, not the wisest, not the weightiest, not certainly the purest and  loftiest, but by odds the most brilliant and the most interesting,  literature in the world. Strong at many points, at some points  triumphantly strong, it is conspicuously weak at only one point,--the  important point of poetry. In eloquence, in philosophy, even in  theology; in history, in fiction, in criticism, in epistolary writing,  in what may be called the pamphlet; in another species of composition,  characteristically, peculiarly, almost uniquely, French,--the Thought  and the Maxim; by eminence in comedy, and in all those related modes of  written expression for which there is scarcely any name but a French  name,--the _jeu d'esprit_, the _bon mot_, _persiflage_, the _phrase_; in  social and political speculation; last, but not least, in scientific  exposition elegant enough in form and in style to rise to the rank of  literature proper,--the French language has abundant achievement to  show, that puts it, upon the whole, hardly second in wealth of letters  to any other language whatever, either ancient or modern.    What constitutes the charm--partly a perilous charm--of French  literature is, before all else, its incomparable clearness, its  precision, its neatness, its point; then, added to this, its lightness  of touch, its sureness of aim; its vivacity, sparkle, life; its  inexhaustible gayety; its impulsion toward wit,--impulsion so strong as  often to land it in mockery; the sense of release that it breathes and  inspires; its freedom from prick to the conscience; its exquisite study  and choice of effect; its deference paid to decorum,--decorum, we mean,  in taste, as distinguished from morals; its infinite patience and labor  of art, achieving the perfection of grace and of ease,--in one word, its  style.    We speak, of course, broadly and in the gross. There are plenty of  French authors to whom some of the traits just named could by no means  be attributed, and there is certainly not a single French author to whom  one could truthfully attribute them all. Voltaire insisted that what was  not clear was not French,--so much, to the conception of this typical  Frenchman, was clearness the genius of the national speech. Still,  Montaigne, for example, was sometimes obscure; and even the tragedist  Corneille wrote here and there what his commentator, Voltaire, declared  to be hardly intelligible. So, too, Rabelais, coarsest of humorists,  offending decorum in various ways, offended it most of all exactly in  that article of taste, as distinguished from morals, which, with  first-rate French authors in general, is so capital a point of regard.  On the other hand, Pascal,--not to mention the moralists by profession,  such as Nicole, and the preachers Bourdaloue and Massillon,--Pascal,  quivering himself, like a soul unclad, with sense of responsibility to  God, constantly probes you, reading him, to the inmost quick of your  conscience. Rousseau, notably in the \"Confessions,\" and in the Reveries  supplementary to the \"Confessions;\" Chateaubriand, echoing Rousseau; and  that wayward woman of genius, George Sand, disciple she to both,--were  so far from being always light-heartedly gay, that not seldom they  spread over their page a sombre atmosphere almost of gloom,--gloom  flushed pensively, as with a clouded \"setting sun's pathetic light.\" In  short, when you speak of particular authors, and naturally still more  when you speak of particular works, there are many discriminations to be  made. Such exceptions, however, being duly allowed, the literary product  of the French mind, considered in the"]]]
