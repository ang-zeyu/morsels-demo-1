Twelfth Edition.                Boston:  Perkins and Marvin.  1838.    Entered, according to act of Congress, in the year 1835,  By Perkins & Marvin,  in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the District of  Massachusetts.            TO THE READER.      When I commenced this work, my object was a mere compilation. There  were many excellent books for young men, already in circulation, but  none which I thought unexceptionable; and some of them contained  sentiments which I could not approve. I sat down, therefore, intending  to make selections from the choicest parts of them all, and prepare an  unexceptionable and practical manual; such an one as I should be  willing to see in the hands of any youth in the community.    In the progress of my task, however, I found much less that was wholly  in accordance with my own sentiments, than I had expected. The result  was that the project of _compiling_, was given up; and a work prepared,  which is chiefly _original_. There are, it is true, some quotations  from 'Burgh's Dignity of Human Nature,' 'Cobbett's Advice to Young  Men,' 'Chesterfield's Advice,' and Hawes' Lectures; but in general what  I have derived from other works is re-written, and much modified. On  this account it was thought unnecessary to refer to authorities in the  body of the work.    The object of this book is to _elevate_ and _reform_. That it may prove  useful and acceptable, as a means to these ends, is the hearty wish of    THE AUTHOR    Boston, Dec. 9, 1833.          ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.      The great purpose of the Young Man's Guide, is the formation of such  character in our young men as shall render them the worthy and useful  and happy members of a great republic. To this end, the author enters  largely into the means of improving the _mind_, the _manners_ and the  _morals_;--as well as the proper management of _business_. Something  is also said on _amusements_, and _bad habits_. On the subject of  _marriage_ he has, however, been rather more full than elsewhere. The  importance of this institution to every young man, the means of  rendering it what the Creator intended, together with those incidental  evils which either accompany or follow--some of them in terrible  retribution--the vices which tend to oppose His benevolent purposes,  are faithfully presented, and claim the special attention of every  youthful reader.                         *      *      *      *      *    ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION.      The rapid sale of a large edition of this work, and the general tribute  of public praise which has been awarded to its merits, instead of  closing the eyes of the Publishers or the Author against existing  defects, have, on the contrary, only deepened their sense of obligation  to render the present edition as perfect as possible; and no pains have  been spared to accomplish this end. Several new sections have been  added to the work, and some of the former have been abridged or  extended.                         *      *      *      *      *    ADVERTISEMENT TO THE THIRD EDITION.      An increasing demand for the Young Man's Guide, evinced by the sale of  more than five thousand copies of the work in a few months, have  induced the publishers to give a third edition, with some amendments  and additions by the author; who has also derived important suggestions  from gentlemen of high literary and moral standing, to whom the work  had been submitted for examination.

PREFACE          The proprietors of the _Manchester Guardian_ have kindly allowed me to  make use of their copyright in the letters written by me to that  newspaper during the first half of the year. The substance of the  letters has been reproduced in the hope that home-staying folk may find  in them something of the atmosphere that surrounds the collision of  armed forces. It is a strange and rude atmosphere; yet it pleases me at  this moment to remember not so much the strangeness and rudeness as the  kindness and good-fellowship that made a dreadful business tolerable and  the memory of it pleasant. Many friends of these brave days I may not  see again, but if their eyes should ever light on this page I would have  them know that it contains a greeting.

A four-wheeler clove its way through the  crowd surrounding the gates, and the sentries presented arms to it. It  contained my friend, the paymaster, who presently came upstairs carrying  a bag in which were several hundred pounds sterling--the real sinews of  war. This was the man whose business it was to call up the Reservists,  and he had a very simple way of doing it. He had several books  containing large forms divided by perforation into four parts. The first  was a counterfoil on which was written the Reservist's name and the date  of posting the order; the second was a railway warrant requesting the  railway company to furnish him with a ticket available by the most  direct route from his place of residence to the depot; the third was the  order requiring him to present himself at the barracks on or before a  certain date; and the fourth was a money-order for three shillings,  officially called an advance, but virtually a present from a considerate  Government. On the 11th of the month the paymaster at Bury had signed  about six hundred of these notices, and had seen them posted; on Sunday  and Monday they had begun to fall like bombs on the breakfast tables of  prosperous civilians all over the country; and soon the pieces of blue  paper had made a sad disturbance in several hundreds of cottage homes,  and added several hundred men to the strength of the 2nd Battalion of  the Lancashire Fusiliers. The business of the pay office, or at least my  friend's part of it--a few subalterns rushing up in a hurry to get money  for their various companies; eighty pounds for A, a hundred pounds for  D, and so on--was soon over, and then he told me something of how the  Reserve system works.    All the men in the Reserve have put in at least seven years' service.  They go into the Reserve first for a term of five years at sixpence a  day, and then (if they wish) for a term of four years at fourpence a  day. Of course when the Reserves are called out they receive the same  pay as regular soldiers, and their wives have separation allowances. As  everyone knows, this was the first time that any considerable number of  the Reserves had been called up, and the system has worked admirably.  About 98 per cent, in some districts presented themselves, the small  remainder being either ill or in gaol. A small proportion of those who  came up were rejected by the doctor, but on the whole the men were tough  and fit. In this district they were allowed eight days in which to  settle their affairs and present themselves at the depot, but most of  them did not come until the last minute, and several not until after the  last minute of the time allowed by the order.    The crowd outside the barrack gates was composed chiefly of women and  loafers, but every now and then it opened to admit a handful of  reluctant-looking men, who had probably stayed outside until their money  was exhausted. And many of them were hanging about outside the gates  having nothing to do and no money to spend, but deferring to the last  moment the final step of self-submission to the iron hand of discipline.  For once the Reservist was inside the barrack yard he could have no more  liberty, probably, for many a long month--unless, indeed, he gained an  endless liberty on the battlefield. The scene through the opposite  window looking on to the barrack yard was very different from the  rather sombre picture without. The yard was gay with the wonderful red  that has done so much to make the army popular. For movement there were  a few squads of Militia recruits being drilled by the trumpet-voiced  sergeants; and for music there was the ring of a hundred rifle-butts  striking the ground together, the tramp and click of many feet, and the  clatter of the colonel's horse as he rode across the yard.    But the most interesting people were the Reservists and their friends,  who dotted the yard in many-coloured groups. Here was a party of girls  and women taking a farewell of some engaging blade whose course of  gallantry had been suddenly interrupted. There was a father standing  with his wife and small family grouped round him, no one saying very  much, but everyone feeling a good deal. And another group would be  laughing and singing, not quite recovered from the means they had taken  to drown regrets.    Sitting in the window, one could trace the Reservist's progress from his  entrance at the gate to his disappearance into quarters. The square was  filled with little processions containing six or eight men each; first  from the orderly-room to the hospital, in all kinds of civilian raiment:  black, grey, brown, green, blue, drab--anything but red; hatless,  capless, black-hatted, cloth-capped, shabby, spruce, dirty, soiled,  clean, pretty clean, white-faced, red-faced, unkempt, well-groomed,  hungry, well-fed, thin, fat--every class between clerks and tramps;  every condition between prosperity and destitution. A procession was  also constantly flowing from the hospital to the quartermaster's  stores--the same procession, with one military touch; for this time the  men did not straggle, but were marched single file in charge of a  sergeant.
