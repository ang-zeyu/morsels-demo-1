The apparatus listed in this catalogue is of our own manufacture, excepting  the astronomical regulator clocks, which we have listed for the convenience  of our customers.    All orders will be filled as promptly as possible with due regard to  thorough workmanship and efficient inspection.    Everything that leaves our establishment is carefully tested and inspected  and we can guarantee our apparatus to be, in every respect, fully as  represented. Any piece, which does not come up to the most exacting  requirements will always be promptly replaced within the shortest possible  time.    We shall be glad to satisfy any special requirements of our customers and  will make any desired alterations and additions on the standard designs.          Introduction.      In the following pages we have endeavored to give to our customers an idea  of the line of astronomical instruments of the latest and most improved  types which we have constructed for some of the leading observatories as  mentioned in the text. We feel that this series of illustrations may not  only be of general interest, but also of service in helping to determine  further developments of modern astronomical and astrophysical equipment. We  have not thought it advisable to describe in detail the various instruments  of precision, which we have been called upon to construct from time to time  for the scientists in the astronomical as well as other branches of science  during the last ten years. As a rule every astronomer is interested in some  special line of research, which for a successful investigation requires a  special adaptation of the instrument he proposes to use, and in such cases  we are confident we can fill the requirements and shall be happy to  correspond with interested parties. We are in position to undertake the  design of special apparatus and can furnish sketches and estimates in  accordance with the suggestions of the customer on short notice in such  cases, where the importance of the prospective business will warrant it.  Among the various instruments which we have built, but which are not  included in this catalogue, we wish to mention, spectroheliographs,  planetary cameras, photographic plate holders, domes for observatories,  etc.    The optical parts which we furnish are of the highest degree of excellence  and are made for us by several of the most reliable firms in this line.    Mr. O. L. Petitdidier is closely located to our works, and during the last  ten years has supplied most of our objectives, etc.    It is and has been the aim of our firm to produce apparatus of the highest  grade and the constant growth of our business is a mute but eloquent  testimonial that our efforts have been appreciated by our customers.    We are glad to acknowledge our indebtedness to many of the foremost  astronomers, who have greatly assisted us by suggestions as to their  particular requirements, and by supplying certain of the photographs here  reproduced.    We take this opportunity to thank our customers for the favors rendered us  in the past, and trust that in the future these mutually pleasant relations  may be renewed.

Universal Equatorial Mounting.# This form of mounting can be used  equally well for celestial and terrestrial observations. The mounting is  made to swivel on the tripod head, in order to set the instrument in the  meridian. The polar axis can be set at any latitude and a graduated arc  gives the exact position. The instrument is set level by means of two small  levels attached to the tripod top. The polar axis is fitted with worm wheel  and worm for slow motion. The handle with the universal joint can be  clamped on either side of the worm shaft. Telescope of 3\" aperture and  three eye pieces.

Portable Equatorial Mounting with Driving Clock.# This instrument  was designed to meet the demand for portable low priced telescope suitable  for the study of astronomy in the college, high school or for the amateur  astronomer. Every observer and teacher in astronomy will appreciate the  great usefulness of a driving mechanism, which will keep the star in the  field during observation. After several years of experimenting we have  succeeded in constructing a reliable clock which can easily be attached to  our portable telescope mounting.    The instrument is mounted on strong hardwood tripod fitted with iron shoes.  It is attached to the tripod top by a single screw which holds it firmly  and allows adjustment in azimuth. The clock case carrying the bearing for  the polar axis is made to swivel in the base casting, so that the polar  axis may be easily set and firmly clamped at an angle from horizontal to  vertical. A level is fitted to the tripod top and a graduated arc is  fastened to the clock case. If the polar axis is set vertical and the worm  wheel unclamped, the instrument is transformed into an alt-azimuth  mounting. This feature will be found to be a great convenience especially  for terrestrial observations.    Both the polar and declination axes are carefully fitted to their bearings  and carry finding circles. The right ascension circle reads to 5 min., the  declination circle to single degrees. The declination axis is fitted with  clamp screw which is within convenient reach.    The clock has ample power and is enclosed in a heavy case which protects it  from dust and injury. It is driven by two strong springs and will run about  12 hours without rewinding. A lever for starting or stopping is provided.  Motion from clock to polar axis is transmitted by means of a set of bevel  gears and worm and worm wheel. The worm wheel is held by friction to the  polar axis so that the telescope can be moved without loosening any screw  and without affecting the clock. The clock will give steady and accurate  motion to the telescope and with ordinary care it will keep in good repair  for years. A slow motion adjustment independent of the clock is fitted to  the polar axis.    With the instrument are furnished three celestial eye pieces giving a  magnifying power of about 50, 100 and 150 diameters respectively.    The instrument is easily portable, the total weight of a 3\" telescope being  about 60 lbs. yet it is made heavy enough, and the material well  distributed to insure strength and steadiness. Workmanship and finish of  the instrument are the best. The brass parts are either lacquered yellow or  bronzed. The iron parts are durably enameled and all exposed steel parts  are nickel-plated.    #A120.# Telescope of 3\" aperture.

Price                           #$320.00#    For accessories see page 11.    #Note.#--An iron column can be provided for above telescopes in place of of  the tripod, at an extra cost of $20.00.    [Illustration: A 130]          EQUATORIAL MOUNTINGS ON IRON PILLAR WITH DRIVING CLOCK, ETC.      On page 10 is shown an illustration of our standard high grade type of 6  in. equatorial. A description of the same will apply to practically all  larger and smaller sizes.    The pillar is of rectangular cross section and well proportioned. The clock  case is securely fastened to the top of the pillar but with provision for  adjustment in azimuth. The clock has ample driving power, is very carefully  constructed and regulated by friction governor (Design Prof. Young.)  Maintaining gears are provided on the main shaft which allows the winding  of the clock without retarding motion. Worm wheel and worm are carefully  cut, and protected by brass shields.

The joy of the little troop just escaped from a long and  wearisome captivity was doubly great: a slight accident to one of the  teachers had caused the class to be dismissed half an hour earlier than  usual, and in consequence of the extra work thrown on the teaching staff  the brother whose duty it was to see all the scholars safe home was  compelled to omit that part of his daily task. Therefore not only thirty  or forty minutes were stolen from work, but there was also unexpected,  uncontrolled liberty, free from the surveillance of that black-cassocked  overseer who kept order in their ranks. Thirty minutes! at that age it  is a century, of laughter and prospective games! Each had promised  solemnly, under pain of severe punishment, to return straight to his  paternal nest without delay, but the air was so fresh and pure, the  country smiled all around! The school, or preferably the cage, which had  just opened, lay at the extreme edge of one of the suburbs, and it only  required a few steps to slip under a cluster of trees by a sparkling  brook beyond which rose undulating ground, breaking the monotony of a  vast and fertile plain. Was it possible to be obedient, to refrain from  the desire to spread one's wings? The scent of the meadows mounted to  the heads of the steadiest among them, and intoxicated even the most  timid. It was resolved to betray the confidence of the reverend fathers,  even at the risk of disgrace and punishment next morning, supposing the  escapade were discovered.    A flock of sparrows suddenly released from a cage could not have flown  more wildly into the little wood. They were all about the same age, the  eldest might be nine. They flung off coats and waistcoats, and the grass  became strewn with baskets, copy-books, dictionaries, and catechisms.  While the crowd of fair-haired heads, of fresh and smiling faces,  noisily consulted as to which game should be chosen, a boy who had taken  no part in the general gaiety, and who had been carried away by the rush  without being able to escape sooner, glided slyly away among the trees,  and, thinking himself unseen, was beating a hasty retreat, when one of  his comrades cried out--    \"Antoine is running away!\"    Two of the best runners immediately started in pursuit, and the  fugitive, notwithstanding his start, was speedily overtaken, seized by  his collar, and brought back as a deserter.    \"Where were you going?\" the others demanded.    \"Home to my cousins,\" replied the boy; \"there is no harm in that.\"    \"You canting sneak!\" said another boy, putting his fist under the  captive's chin; \"you were going to the master to tell of us.\"    \"Pierre,\" responded Antoine, \"you know quite well I never tell lies.\"    \"Indeed!--only this morning you pretended I had taken a book you had  lost, and you did it because I kicked you yesterday, and you didn't dare  to kick me back again.\"    Antoine lifted his eyes to heaven, and folding his arms on his breast--    \"Dear Buttel,\" he said, \"you are mistaken; I have always been taught to  forgive injuries.\"    \"Listen, listen! he might be saying his prayers!\" cried the other boys;  and a volley of offensive epithets, enforced by cuffs, was hurled at the  culprit.    Pierre Buttel, whose influence was great, put a stop to this onslaught.    \"Look here, Antoine, you are a bad lot, that we all know; you are a  sneak and a hypocrite. It's time we put a stop to it. Take off your coat  and fight it out. If you like, we will fight every morning and evening  till the end of the month.\"    The proposition was loudly applauded, and Pierre, turning up his sleeves  as far as his elbows, prepared to suit actions to words.    The challenger assuredly did not realise the full meaning, of his words;  had he done so, this chivalrous defiance would simply have been an act  of cowardice on his part, for there could be no doubt as to the victor  in such a conflict. The one was a boy of alert and gallant bearing,  strong upon his legs, supple and muscular, a vigorous man in embryo;  while the other, not quite so old, small, thin, of a sickly leaden  complexion, seemed as if he might be blown away by a strong puff of  wind. His skinny arms and legs hung on to his body like the claws of a  spider, his fair hair inclined to red, his white skin appeared nearly  bloodless, and the consciousness of weakness made him timid, and gave a  shifty, uneasy look to his eyes. His whole expression was uncertain, and  looking only at his face it was difficult at first sight to decide to  which sex he belonged. This confusion of two natures, this indefinable  mixture of feminine weakness without grace, and of abortive boyhood,  seemed to stamp him as something exceptional, unclassable, and once  observed, it was difficult to take one's eyes from him. Had he been  endowed with physical strength he would have been a terror to his  comrades, exercising by fear the ascendancy which Pierre owed to his  joyous temper and unwearied gaiety, for this mean exterior concealed  extraordinary powers of will and dissimulation. Guided by instinct, the  other children hung about Pierre and willingly accepted his leadership;  by instinct also they avoided Antoine, repelled by a feeling of chill,  as if from the neighbourhood of a reptile, and shunning him unless to  profit in some way by their superior strength. Never would he join their  games without compulsion; his thin, colourless lips seldom parted for a  laugh, and even at that tender age his smile had an unpleasantly  sinister expression.    \"Will you fight?\" again demanded Pierre.    Antoine glanced hastily round; there was no chance of escape, a double  ring enclosed him. To accept or refuse seemed about equally risky; he  ran a good chance of a thrashing whichever way he decided. Although his  heart beat loudly, no trace of emotion appeared on his pallid cheek; an  unforeseen danger would have made him shriek, but he had had time to  collect himself, time to shelter behind hypocrisy. As soon as he could  lie and cheat he recovered courage, and the instinct of cunning, once  roused, prevailed over everything else. Instead of answering this second  challenge, he knelt down and said to Pierre--    \"You are much stronger than I am.\"    This submission disarmed his antagonist. \"Get up,\" he replied; \"I won't  touch you, if you can't defend yourself.    \"Pierre,\" continued Antoine, still on his knees, \"I assure you, by God  and the Holy Virgin, I was not going to tell. I was going home to my  cousins to learn my lessons for to-morrow; you know how slow I am. If  you think I have done you any harm, I ask your forgiveness.\"    Pierre held out his hand and made him get up.    \"Will you be a good fellow, Antoine, and play with us?\"    \"Yes, I will.\"    \"All right, then; let us forget all about it.\"    \"What are we to play at?\" asked Antoine, taking off his coat.    \"Thieves and archers,\" cried one of the boys....    \"Splendid!\" said Pierre; and using his acknowledged authority, he  divided them into two sides--ten highwaymen, whom he was to command, and  ten archers of the guard, who were to pursue them; Antoine was among the  latter.    The highwaymen, armed with swords and guns obtained from the willows  which grew along the brook, moved off first, and gained the valleys  between the little hills beyond the wood. The fight was to be serious,  and any prisoner on either side was to be tried immediately. The robbers  divided into twos and threes, and hid themselves in the ravines.    A few minutes later the archers started in pursuit. There were  encounters, surprises, skirmishes; but whenever it came to close  quarters, Pierre's men, skilfully distributed, united on hearing his  whistle, and the Army of justice had to retreat. But there came a time  when this magic signal was no longer heard, and the robbers became  uneasy, and remained crouching in their hiding-places. Pierre,  over-daring, had undertaken to defend alone the entrance of a dangerous  passage and to stop the whole hostile troop there. Whilst he kept them  engaged, half of his men, concealed on the left, were to come round the  foot of the hill and make a rush on hearing his whistle; the other half,  also stationed at some, little distance, were to execute the same  manoeuvre from above. The archers would be caught in a trap, and  attacked both in front and rear, would be obliged to surrender at  discretion. Chance, which not unfrequently decides the fate of a battle,  defeated this excellent stratagem. Watching intently; Pierre failed to  perceive that while his whole attention was given to the ground in  front, the archers had taken an entirely different road from the one  they ought to have followed if his combination were to succeed. They  suddenly fell upon him from behind, and before he could blow his  whistle, they gagged him with a handkerchief and tied his hands. Six  remained to keep the field of battle and disperse the hostile band, now  deprived of its chief; the remaining four conveyed Pierre to the little  wood, while the robbers, hearing no signal, did not venture to stir.  According to agreement, Pierre Buttel was tried by the archers, who  promptly transformed themselves into a court of justice, and as he had  been taken red-handed, and did not condescend to defend himself, the  trial was not a long affair. He was unanimously sentenced to be hung,  and the execution was then and there carried out, at the request of the  criminal himself,"]]]
