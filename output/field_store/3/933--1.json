Many facts have been learned by observation,  but the _why_ of each is frequently shrouded in mystery.    Modern dairying is attempting to build its more accurate knowledge upon  a broader and surer foundation, and in doing this is seeking to  ascertain the cause of well-established processes. In this, bacteriology  is playing an important role. Indeed, it may be safely predicted that  future progress in dairying will, to a large extent, depend upon  bacteriological research. As Fleischmann, the eminent German dairy  scientist, says: \"The gradual abolition of uncertainty surrounding dairy  manufacture is the present important duty which lies before us, and its  solution can only be effected by bacteriology.\"    It is therefore natural that the subject of Dairy Bacteriology has come  to occupy an important place in the curriculum of almost every Dairy  School. An exposition of its principles is now recognized as an integral  part of dairy science, for modern dairy practice is rapidly adopting the  methods that have been developed as the result of bacteriological study.  The rapid development of the subject has necessitated a frequent  revision of this work, and it is gratifying to the writer that the  attempt which has been made to keep these Outlines abreast of  bacteriological advance has been appreciated by students of dairying.    While the text is prepared more especially for the practical dairy  operator who wishes to understand the principles and reasons underlying  his art, numerous references to original investigations have been added  to aid the dairy investigator who wishes to work up the subject more  thoroughly.

STRUCTURE OF THE BACTERIA AND CONDITIONS GOVERNING THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND  DISTRIBUTION.      Before one can gain any intelligent conception of the manner in which  bacteria affect dairying, it is first necessary to know something of the  life history of these organisms in general, how they live, move and  react toward their environment.    ~Nature of Bacteria.~ Toadstools, smuts, rusts and mildews are known to  even the casual observer, because they are of evident size. Their  plant-like nature can be more readily understood from their general  structure and habits of life. The bacteria, however, are so small, that  under ordinary conditions, they only become evident to our unaided  senses by the by-products of their activity.    When Leeuwenhoek (pronounced Lave-en-hake) in 1675 first discovered  these tiny, rapidly-moving organisms he thought they were animals.  Indeed, under a microscope, many of them bear a close resemblance to  those minute worms found in vinegar that are known as \"vinegar-eels.\"  The idea that they belonged to the animal kingdom continued to hold  ground until after the middle of the nineteenth century; but with the  improvement in microscopes, a more thorough study of these tiny  structures was made possible, and their vegetable nature demonstrated.  The bacteria as a class are separated from the fungi mainly by their  method of growth; from the lower algae by the absence of chlorophyll,  the green coloring matter of vegetable organisms.    ~Structure of bacteria.~ So far as structure is concerned the bacteria  stand on the lowest plane of vegetable life. The single individual is  composed of but a single cell, the structure of which does not differ  essentially from that of many of the higher types of plant life. It is  composed of a protoplasmic body which is surrounded by a thin membrane  that separates it from neighboring cells that are alike in form and  size.    ~Form and size.~ When a plant is composed of a single cell but little  difference in form is to be expected. While there are intermediate  stages that grade insensibly into each other, the bacteria may be  grouped into three main types, so far as form is concerned. These are  spherical, elongated, and spiral, and to these different types are given  the names, respectively, _coccus_, _bacillus_ and _spirillum_ (plural,  _cocci_, _bacilli_, _spirilla_) (fig. 1). A ball, a short rod, and a  corkscrew serve as convenient models to illustrate these different  forms.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Different forms of bacteria. _a_, _b_, _c_,  represent different types as to form: _a_, coccus, _b_, bacillus, _c_,  spirillum; _d_, diplococcus or twin coccus; _e_, staphylococcus or  cluster coccus; _f_ and _g_, different forms of bacilli, _g_ shows  internal endospores within cell; _h_ and _i_, bacilli with motile organs  (cilia).]    In size, the bacteria are the smallest organisms that are known to  exist. Relatively there is considerable difference in size between the  different species, yet in absolute amount this is so slight as to  require the highest powers of the microscope to detect it. As an average  diameter, one thirty-thousandth of an inch may be taken. It is difficult  to comprehend such minute measurements, but if a hundred individual  germs could be placed side by side, their total thickness would not  equal that of a single sheet of paper upon which this page is printed.    ~Manner of Growth.~ As the cell increases in size as a result of growth,  it elongates in one direction, and finally a new cell wall is formed,  dividing the so-called mother-cell into two, equal-sized daughter-cells.  This process of cell division, known as _fission_, is continued until  growth ceases and is especially characteristic of bacteria.    ~Cell Arrangement.~ If fission goes on in the same plane continually, it  results in the formation of a cell-row. A coccus forming such a chain of  cells is called _strepto-coccus_ (chain-coccus). If only two cells  cohere, it is called a _diplo-coccus_ (twin-coccus). If the second cell  division plane is formed at right angles to the first, a _cell surface_  or _tetrad_ is formed. If growth takes place in three dimensions of  space, a _cell mass_ or _sarcina_ is produced. Frequently, these cell  aggregates cohere so tenaciously that this arrangement is of value in  distinguishing different species.    ~Spores.~ Some bacteria possess the property of forming _spores_ within  the mother cell (called _endospores_, fig. 1g) that are analogous in  function to the seeds of higher plants and spores of fungi. By means of  these structures which are endowed with greater powers of resistance  than the vegetating cell, the organism is able to protect itself from  the effect of an unfavorable environment. Many of the bacilli form  endospores but the cocci do not. It is these spore forms that make it  so difficult to thoroughly sterilize milk.    ~Movement.~ Many bacteria are unable to move from place to place. They  have, however, a vibrating movement known as the _Brownian_ motion that  is purely physical. Many other kinds are endowed with powers of  locomotion. Motion is produced by means of fine thread-like processes of  protoplasm known as _cilia_ (sing. _cilium_) that are developed on the  outer surface of the cell. By means of the rapid vibration of these  organs, the cell is propelled through the medium. Nearly all cocci are  immotile, while the bacilli may or may not be. These cilia are so  delicate that it requires special treatment to demonstrate their  presence.    ~Classification.~ In classifying or arranging the different members of any  group of living objects, certain similarities and dissimilarities must  be considered. These are usually those that pertain to the structure and  form, as such are regarded as most constant. With the bacteria these  differences are so slight that they alone do not suffice to distinguish  distinctly one species from another.

A law-student of the present day finds it difficult to realize the  brightness and domestic decency which characterized the Inns of Court in  the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. Under existing  circumstances, women of character and social position avoid the gardens  and terraces of Gray's Inn and the Temple.    Attended by men, or protected by circumstances that guard them from  impertinence and scandal, gentlewomen can without discomfort pass and  repass the walls of our legal colleges; but in most cases a lady enters  them under conditions that announce even to casual passers the object of  her visit. In her carriage, during the later hours of the day, a  barrister's wife may drive down the Middle Temple Lane, or through the  gate of Lincoln's Inn, and wait in King's Bench Walk or New Square,  until her husband, putting aside clients and papers, joins her for the  homeward drive. But even thus placed, sitting in her carriage and  guarded by servants, she usually prefers to fence off inquisitive eyes  by a bonnet-veil, or the blinds of her carriage-windows. On Sunday, the  wives and daughters of gentle families brighten the dingy passages of  the Temple, and the sombre courts of Lincoln's Inn: for the musical  services of the grand church and little chapel, are amongst the  religious entertainments of the town. To those choral celebrations  ladies go, just as they are accustomed to enter any metropolitan church;  and after service they can take a turn in the gardens of either Society,  without drawing upon themselves unpleasant attention. So also,  unattended by men, ladies are permitted to inspect the floral  exhibitions with which Mr. Broome, the Temple gardener, annually  entertains London sightseers.    But, save on these and a few similar occasions and conditions,  gentlewomen avoid an Inn of Court as they would a barrack-yard, unless  they have secured the special attendance of at least one member of the  society. The escort of a barrister or student, alters the case. What  barrister, young or old, cannot recall mirthful eyes that, with quick  shyness, have turned away from his momentary notice, as in answer to the  rustling of silk, or stirred by sympathetic consciousness of women's  noiseless presence, he has raised his face from a volume of reports, and  seen two or three timorous girls peering through the golden haze of a  London morning, into the library of his Inn? What man, thus drawn away  for thirty seconds from prosaic toil, has not in that half minute  remembered the faces of happy rural homes,--has not recalled old days  when his young pulses beat cordial welcome to similar intruders upon the  stillness of the Bodleian, or the tranquil seclusion of Trinity library?  What occupant of dreary chambers in the Temple, reading this page,  cannot look back to a bright day, when young, beautiful, and pure as  sanctity, Lilian, or Kate, or Olive, entered his room radiant with  smiles, delicate in attire, and musical with gleesome gossip about  country neighbors, and the life of a joyous home?    Seldom does a Templar of the present generation receive so fair and  innocent a visitor. To him the presence of a gentlewoman in his court,  is an occasion for ingenious conjecture; encountered on his staircase  she is a cause of lively astonishment. His guests are men, more or less  addicted to tobacco; his business callers are solicitors and their  clerks; in his vestibule the masculine emissaries of tradesmen may  sometimes be found--head-waiters from neighboring taverns, pot-boys from  the 'Cock' and the 'Rainbow.' A printer's devil may from time to time  knock at his door. But of women--such women as he would care to mention  to his mother and sisters--he sees literally nothing in his dusty,  ill-ordered, but not comfortless rooms. He has a laundress, one of a  class on whom contemporary satire has been rather too severe.    Feminine life of another sort lurks in the hidden places of the law  colleges, shunning the gaze of strangers by daylight; and even when it  creeps about under cover of night, trembling with a sense of its own  incurable shame. But of this sad life, the bare thought of which sends a  shivering through the frame of every man whom God has blessed with a  peaceful home and wholesome associations, nothing shall be said in this  page.    In past time the life of law-colleges was very different in this  respect. When they ceased to be ecclesiastics, and fixed themselves in  the hospices which soon after the reception of the gowned tenants, were  styled Inns of Courts; our lawyers took unto themselves wives, who were  both fair and discreet. And having so made women flesh of their flesh  and bone of their bone, they brought them to homes within the immediate  vicinity of their collegiate walls, and sometimes within the walls  themselves. Those who would appreciate the life of the Inns in past  centuries, and indeed in times within the memory of living men, should  bear this in mind. When he was not on circuit, many a counsellor learned  in the law, found the pleasures not less than the business of his  existence within the bounds of his 'honorable society.' In the fullest  sense of the words, he took his ease in his Inn; besides being his  workshop, where clients flocked to him for advice, it was his club, his  place of pastime, and the shrine of his domestic affections. In this  generation a successful Chancery barrister, or Equity draftsman, looks  upon Lincoln's Inn merely as a place of business, where at a prodigious  rent he holds a set of rooms in which he labors over cases, and  satisfies the demands of clients and pupils. A century or two centuries  since the case was often widely different. The rising barrister brought  his bride in triumph to his 'chambers,' and in them she received the  friends who hurried to congratulate her on her new honors. In those  rooms she dispensed graceful hospitality, and watched her husband's  toils. The elder of her children first saw the light in those narrow  quarters; and frequently the"]]]
