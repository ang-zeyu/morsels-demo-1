The  materials can be secured from the planing mill dressed and sandpapered  ready to cut the tenons and mortises. The material list can be made up  from the dimensions given in the detail drawing. The front legs or  posts, as well as the back ones, are made from 1-3/4-in. square stock,  the back ones having a slope of 2 in. from the seat to the top. All the  slats are made from 7/8-in. material and of such widths as are shown in  the detail. The three upright slats in the back are 3/4-in. material.  The detail drawing shows the side and back, the front being the same as  the back from the seat down. All joints are mortised in the posts, as  shown. The joints, however, can be made with dowels if desired. If  making dowel joints they must be clamped very tight when glued and put  together. The seat can be made from one piece of 7/8-in. material,  fitted with notches around the posts. This is then upholstered with  leather without using springs. Leather must be selected as to color to  suit the kind of wood used in making the chair. The seat can also be  made with an open center for a cane bottom by making a square of four  pieces of 7/8-in. material about 4 in. wide. These pieces are fitted  neatly to the proper size and dowelled firmly together. After the cane  is put in the opening the cane is covered over and upholstered with  leather in the same manner as with a solid bottom.          HOW TO MAKE A LAMP STAND AND SHADE      A library light stand of pleasing design and easy construction is made  as follows: Square up a piece of white oak so that it shall have a width  and thickness of 1-3/4 in. with a length of 13 in. Square up two pieces  of the same kind of material to the same width and thickness, but with a  length of 12 in. each. Square up two pieces to a width and length of 3  in. each with a thickness of 1-1/8 in.    If a planing mill is near, time and patience will be saved by ordering  one piece 1-3/4 in. square and 40 in. long, two pieces 1-1/8 in. thick  and 3 in. square, all planed and sandpapered on all surfaces. The long  piece can then be cut at home to the lengths specified above.    The 13-in. piece is for the upright and should have a 1/2-in. hole bored  the full length through the center. If the bit is not long enough to  reach entirely through, bore from each end, then use a red-hot iron to  finish. This hole is for the electric wire or gas pipe if gas is used.    The two pieces for the base are alike except the groove of one is cut  from the top and of the other from the under side, as shown. Shape the  under sides first. This can best be done by placing the two pieces in a  vise, under sides together, and boring two holes with a 1-in. bit. The  center of each hole will be 2-1/2 in. from either end and in the crack  between the pieces. The pieces can then be taken out, lines gauged on  each side of each, and the wood between the holes removed with turning  saw and scraper steel.    [Illustration: The Completed Lamp]    The width of the grooves must be determined by laying one piece upon the  other; a try-square should be used to square the lines across the  pieces; however, gauge for depth, gauging both pieces from their top  surfaces. Chisel out the grooves and round off the corners as shown in  the sketch, using a 3/4-in. radius.    These parts may be put together and fastened to the upright by means of  two long screws from the under side, placed to either side of the  1/2-in. hole. This hole must be continued through the pieces forming the  base.    The braces are easiest made by taking the two pieces which were planed  to 1-1/8 in. thick and 3 in. square and drawing a diagonal on each. Find  the middle of this diagonal by drawing the central portion of the other  diagonal; at this point place the spur of the bit and bore a 1-in. hole  in each block.    Saw the two blocks apart, sawing along a diagonal of each. Plane the  surfaces on the saw cut smooth and sandpaper the curve made by the bit.  Fasten the braces in place by means of roundhead blued screws.    To make a shade such as is shown in the illustration is rather  difficult. The shade is made of wood glued up and has art glass fitted  in rabbets cut on the inner edges. Such shades can be purchased ready to  attach. The sketch shows one method of attaching. Four small pieces of  strap iron are bent to the shape shown and fastened to the four sides of  the upright. Electric globes--two, three or four may be attached as  shown.    [Illustration: Construction of Shade]    The kind of wood finish for the stand will depend upon the finish on the  wooden shade, if shade is purchased. Brown Flemish is obtained by first  staining the wood with Flemish water stain diluted by the addition of  two parts water to one part stain. When this is dry, sandpaper the  \"whiskers\" which were raised by the water and fill with a medium dark  filler. Directions will be found on the filler cans. When filler has  hardened, apply two coats of wax.

Page and Company  (Incorporated)  1900    _Copyright, 1900_  BY L.C. PAGE & COMPANY  (INCORPORATED)    _All rights reserved_    Colonial Press  Electrotyped and Printed by C.H. Simonds & Co.  Boston, U.S.A.          TO    James Huneker    MUSICIAN TO THE TIP OF HIS PEN          FOREWORD.      One day there came into Robert Schumann's ken the work of a young  fellow named Brahms, and the master cried aloud in the wilderness,  \"Behold, the new Messiah of music!\" Many have refused to accept Brahms  at this rating, and I confess to being one of the unregenerate, but  the spirit that kept Schumann's heart open to the appeal of any  stranger, that led him into instant enthusiasms of which he was  neither afraid nor ashamed, enthusiasms in which the whole world has  generally followed his leading--that spirit it is that proves his true  musicianship, and makes him a place forever among the great critics  of music,--a small, small crowd they are, too.    It is inevitable that a pioneer like Schumann should make many  mistakes, but he escaped the one great fatal mistake of those who are  not open to conviction, nor alert for new beauty and fresh truth, who  are willing to take art to their affections or respect only when it  has lost its bloom and has been duly appraised and ticketed by other  generations or foreign scholars. And yet, even worse than this  languorous inanition is the active policy of those who despise  everything contemporary or native, and substitute sciolism for  catholicity, contempt for analysis.    While the greater part of the world has stayed aloof, the problem of a  national American music has been solving itself. Aside from  occasional attentions evoked by chance performances, it may be said in  general that the growth of our music has been unloved and unheeded by  anybody except a few plodding composers, their wives, and a retainer  or two. The only thing that inclines me to invade the privacy of the  American composer and publish his secrets, is my hearty belief, lo,  these many years! that some of the best music in the world is being  written here at home, and that it only needs the light to win its meed  of praise.    Owing to the scarcity of printed matter relating to native composers,  and the utter incompleteness and bias of what exists, I have based  this book almost altogether on my own research. I studied the  catalogues of all the respectable music publishers, and selected such  composers as seemed to have any serious intentions. When I heard of a  composer whose work, though earnest, had not been able to find a  publisher, I sought him out and read his manuscripts (a hideous task  which might be substituted for the comparative pastime of breaking  rocks, as punishment for misdemeanors). In every case I secured as  many of each composer's works as could be had in print or in  manuscript, and endeavored to digest them. Thousands of pieces of  music, from short songs to operatic and orchestral scores, I studied  with all available conscience. The fact that after going through at  least a ton of American compositions, I am still an enthusiast, is  surely a proof of some virtue in native music.    A portion of the result of this study was published _au courant_ in a  magazine, awakening so much attention that I have at length decided to  yield to constant requests and publish the articles in more accessible  form. The necessity for revising many of the opinions formed hastily  and published immediately, the possibility now of taking the work of  our musicians in some perspective, and the opportunity of bringing my  information up to date, have meant so much revision, excision, and  addition, that this book is really a new work.    The biographical data have been furnished in practically every case by  the composers themselves, and are, therefore, reliable in everything  except possibly the date of birth. The critical opinions gain their  possibly dogmatic tone rather from a desire for brevity than from any  hope--or wish--that they should be swallowed whole. No attempt to set  up a standard of comparative merit or precedence has been made, though  it is inevitable that certain music-makers should interest one more  than certain others even more worthy in the eyes of eminent judges.    It may be that some inspectors of this book will complain of the  omission of names they had expected to find here. Others will feel a  sense of disproportion. To them there is no reply but a pathetic  allusion to the inevitable incompleteness and asymmetry of all things  human.    Many will look with skepticism at the large number of composers I have  thought worthy of inclusion. I can only say that the fact that an  artist has created one work of high merit makes him a good composer in  my opinion, whether or no he has ever written another, and whether or  no he has afterward fallen into the sere and yellow school of trash.  So Gray's fame is perennial,--one poem among many banalities.    Besides, I do not concur in that most commonplace fallacy of  criticism, the belief that not more than one genius is vouchsafed to  any one period of an art, though this opinion can be justified, of  course, by a very exclusive definition of the word genius. To the  average mind, for instance, the whole literary achievement of the  Elizabethan era is condensed into the name of Shakespeare.  Contemporary with him, however, there were, of course, thirty or forty  writers whose best works the scholar would be most unwilling to let  die. There were, for instance, a dozen playwrights, like Jonson,  Fletcher, Ford, Marlowe, and Greene, in whose works can be found  literary and dramatic touches of the very highest order. There were  poets less prolific than Spenser, and yet to be credited with a few  works of the utmost beauty, minor geniuses like Ralegh, Sidney, Lodge,  Shirley, Lyly, Wotton, Wither, John Donne, Bishop Hall, Drayton,  Drummond, Herbert, Carew, Herrick, Breton, Allison, Byrd, Dowland,  Campion--so one might run on without naming one man who had not  written something the world was better for.    All periods of great art activity are similarly marked by a large  number of geniuses whose ability is not disproved, because  overshadowed by the presence of some titanic contemporary. It would be  a mere impertinence to state such an axiom of art as this, were it not  the plain truth that almost all criticism of contemporaries is based  upon an arrant neglect of it; and if it were not for the fact that I  am about to string out a long, long list of American music-makers  whose ability I think noteworthy,--a list whose length may lead many a  wiseacre to pull a longer face.    Parts of this book have been reprinted from _Godey's Magazine_, the  _Century Magazine_, and the _Criterion_, to whose publishers I am  indebted for permission. For the music reproduced here I have to  thank the publishers whose copyrights were loaned for the occasion.    If the book shall only succeed in arousing in some minds an interest  or a curiosity that shall set them to the study of American music (as  I have studied it, with infinite pleasure), then this fine white paper  and this beautiful black ink will not have been wasted.
