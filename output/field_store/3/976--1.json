News had come to him in Donegal that there were yet people in his  own province who believed in gods that he did not approve of, and the  gods that we do not approve of are treated scurvily, even by saintly  men.    He was told of a powerful gentleman who observed neither Saint's day nor  Sunday.    \"A powerful person!\" said Finnian.    \"All that,\" was the reply.    \"We shall try this person's power,\" said Finnian.    \"He is reputed to be a wise and hardy man,\" said his informant.    \"We shall test his wisdom and his hardihood.\"    \"He is,\" that gossip whispered--\"he is a magician.\"    \"I will magician him,\" cried Finnian angrily. \"Where does that man  live?\"    He was informed, and he proceeded to that direction without delay.    In no great time he came to the stronghold of the gentleman who followed  ancient ways, and he demanded admittance in order that he might preach  and prove the new God, and exorcise and terrify and banish even the  memory of the old one; for to a god grown old Time is as ruthless as to  a beggarman grown old.    But the Ulster gentleman refused Finnian admittance. He barricaded  his house, he shuttered his windows, and in a gloom of indignation and  protest he continued the practices of ten thousand years, and would  not hearken to Finnian calling at the window or to Time knocking at his  door.    But of those adversaries it was the first he redoubted.    Finnian loomed on him as a portent and a terror; but he had no fear of  Time. Indeed he was the foster-brother of Time, and so disdainful of the  bitter god that he did not even disdain him; he leaped over the scythe,  he dodged under it, and the sole occasions on which Time laughs is when  he chances on Tuan, the son of Cairill, the son of Muredac Red-neck.        CHAPTER II    Now Finnian could not abide that any person should resist both the  Gospel and himself, and he proceeded to force the stronghold by peaceful  but powerful methods. He fasted on the gentleman, and he did so to such  purpose that he was admitted to the house; for to an hospitable heart  the idea that a stranger may expire on your doorstep from sheer famine  cannot be tolerated. The gentleman, however, did not give in without a  struggle: he thought that when Finnian had grown sufficiently hungry he  would lift the siege and take himself off to some place where he might  get food. But he did not know Finnian. The great abbot sat down on a  spot just beyond the door, and composed himself to all that might follow  from his action. He bent his gaze on the ground between his feet,  and entered into a meditation from which he would Only be released by  admission or death.    The first day passed quietly.    Often the gentleman would send a servitor to spy if that deserter of the  gods was still before his door, and each time the servant replied that  he was still there.    \"He will be gone in the morning,\" said the hopeful master.    On the morrow the state of siege continued, and through that day the  servants were sent many times to observe through spy-holes.    \"Go,\" he would say, \"and find out if the worshipper of new gods has  taken himself away.\"    But the servants returned each time with the same information.    \"The new druid is still there,\" they said.    All through that day no one could leave the stronghold. And the enforced  seclusion wrought on the minds of the servants, while the cessation  of all work banded them together in small groups that whispered and  discussed and disputed. Then these groups would disperse to peep through  the spy-hole at the patient, immobile figure seated before the door,  wrapped in a meditation that was timeless and unconcerned. They  took fright at the spectacle, and once or twice a woman screamed  hysterically, and was bundled away with a companion's hand clapped on  her mouth, so that the ear of their master should not be affronted.    \"He has his own troubles,\" they said. \"It is a combat of the gods that  is taking place.\"    So much for the women; but the men also were uneasy. They prowled up and  down, tramping from the spy-hole to the kitchen, and from the kitchen  to the turreted roof. And from the roof they would look down on the  motionless figure below, and speculate on many things, including  the staunchness of man, the qualities of their master, and even the  possibility that the new gods might be as powerful as the old.  From these peepings and discussions they would return languid and  discouraged.    \"If,\" said one irritable guard, \"if we buzzed a spear at the persistent  stranger, or if one slung at him with a jagged pebble!\"    \"What!\" his master demanded wrathfully, \"is a spear to be thrown at  an unarmed stranger? And from this house!\" And he soundly cuffed that  indelicate servant.    \"Be at peace all of you,\" he said, \"for hunger has a whip, and he will  drive the stranger away in the night.\"    The household retired to wretched beds; but for the master of the house  there was no sleep. He marched his halls all night, going often to  the spy-hole to see if that shadow was still sitting in the shade, and  pacing thence, tormented, preoccupied, refusing even the nose of his  favourite dog as it pressed lovingly into his closed palm.    On the morrow he gave in.    The great door was swung wide, and two of his servants carried Finnian  into the house, for the saint could no longer walk or stand upright by  reason of the hunger and exposure to which he had submitted. But his  frame was tough as the unconquerable spirit that dwelt within it, and  in no long time he was ready for whatever might come of dispute or  anathema.    Being quite re-established he undertook the conversion of the master of  the house, and the siege he laid against that notable intelligence was  long spoken of among those who are interested in such things.    He had beaten the disease of Mugain; he had beaten his own pupil the  great Colm Cille; he beat Tuan also, and just as the latter's door had  opened to the persistent stranger, so his heart opened, and Finnian  marched there to do the will of God, and his own will.        CHAPTER III    One day they were talking together about the majesty of God and His  love, for although Tuan had now received much instruction on this  subject he yet needed more, and he laid as close a siege on Finnian  as Finnian had before that laid on him. But man works outwardly and  inwardly. After rest he has energy, after energy he needs repose; so,  when we have given instruction for a time, we need instruction, and must  receive it or the spirit faints and wisdom herself grows bitter.    Therefore Finnian said: \"Tell me now about yourself, dear heart.\"    But Tuan was avid of information about the True God. \"No, no,\" he  said, \"the past has nothing more of interest for me, and I do not wish  anything to come between my soul and its instruction; continue to teach  me, dear friend and saintly father.\"    \"I will do that,\" Finnian replied, \"but I must first meditate deeply on  you, and must know you well. Tell me your past, my beloved, for a man is  his past, and is to be known by it.\"    But Tuan pleaded: \"Let the past be content with itself, for man needs  forgetfulness as well as memory.\"    \"My son,\" said Finnian, \"all that has ever been done has been done for  the glory of God, and to confess our good and evil deeds is part of  instruction; for the soul must recall its acts and abide by them, or  renounce them by confession and penitence. Tell me your genealogy first,  and by what descent you occupy these lands and stronghold, and then I  will examine your acts and your conscience.\"    Tuan replied obediently: \"I am known as Tuan, son of Cairill, son of  Muredac Red-neck, and these are the hereditary lands of my father.\"    The saint nodded.    \"I am not as well acquainted with Ulster genealogies as I should be, yet  I know something of them. I am by blood a Leinsterman,\" he continued.    \"Mine is a long pedigree,\" Tuan murmured.    Finnian received that information with respect and interest.    \"I also,\" he said, \"have an honourable record.\"    His host continued: \"I am indeed Tuan, the son of Starn, the son of  Sera, who was brother to Partholon.\"    \"But,\" said Finnian in bewilderment, \"there is an error here, for you  have recited two different genealogies.\"    \"Different genealogies, indeed,\" replied Tuan thoughtfully, \"but they  are my genealogies.\"    \"I do not understand this,\" Finnian declared roundly.    \"I am now known as Tuan mac Cairill,\" the other replied, \"but in the  days of old I was known as Tuan mac Starn, mac Sera.\"    \"The brother of Partholon,\" the saint gasped.    \"That is my pedigree,\" Tuan said.    \"But,\" Finnian objected in bewilderment, \"Partholon came to Ireland not  long after the Flood.\"    \"I came with him,\" said Tuan mildly.    The saint pushed his chair back hastily, and sat staring at his host,  and as he stared the blood grew chill in his veins, and his hair crept  along his scalp and stood on end.        CHAPTER IV    But Finnian was not one who remained long in bewilderment. He thought on  the might of God and he became that might, and was tranquil.    He was one who loved God and Ireland, and to the person who could  instruct him in these great themes he gave all the interest of his mind  and the sympathy of his heart.    \"It is a wonder you tell me, my beloved,\" he said. \"And now you must  tell me more.\"    \"What must I tell?\" asked Tuan resignedly.    \"Tell me of the"]]]
