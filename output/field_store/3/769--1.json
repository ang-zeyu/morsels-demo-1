[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23169"],[0,"The Diamond Lens (#1)"],[1,"DIAMOND LENS    By Fitz-James O'brien          I    FROM a very early period of my life the entire bent of my inclinations  had been toward microscopic investigations. When I was not more than  ten years old, a distant relative of our family, hoping to astonish my  inexperience, constructed a simple microscope for me by drilling in a  disk of copper a small hole in which a drop of pure water was sustained  by capillary attraction. This very primitive apparatus, magnifying some  fifty diameters, presented, it is true, only indistinct and imperfect  forms, but still sufficiently wonderful to work up my imagination to a  preternatural state of excitement.    Seeing me so interested in this rude instrument, my cousin explained to  me all that he knew about the principles of the microscope, related to  me a few of the wonders which had been accomplished through its agency,  and ended by promising to send me one regularly constructed, immediately  on his return to the city. I counted the days, the hours, the minutes  that intervened between that promise and his departure.    Meantime, I was not idle. Every transparent substance that bore the  remotest resemblance to a lens I eagerly seized upon, and employed  in vain attempts to realize that instrument the theory of whose  construction I as yet only vaguely comprehended. All panes of  glass containing those oblate spheroidal knots familiarly known as  \"bull's-eyes\" were ruthlessly destroyed in the hope of obtaining lenses  of marvelous power. I even went so far as to extract the crystalline  humor from the eyes of fishes and animals, and endeavored to press  it into the microscopic service. I plead guilty to having stolen the  glasses from my Aunt Agatha's spectacles, with a dim idea of grinding  them into lenses of wondrous magnifying properties--in which attempt it  is scarcely necessary to say that I totally failed.    At last the promised instrument came. It was of that order known as  Field's simple microscope, and had cost perhaps about fifteen dollars.  As far as educational purposes went, a better apparatus could not  have been selected. Accompanying it was a small treatise on the  microscope--its history, uses, and discoveries. I comprehended then for  the first time the \"Arabian Nights' Entertainments.\" The dull veil of  ordinary existence that hung across the world seemed suddenly to  roll away, and to lay bare a land of enchantments. I felt toward my  companions as the seer might feel toward the ordinary masses of men.  I held conversations with nature in a tongue which they could not  understand. I was in daily communication with living wonders such as  they never imagined in their wildest visions, I penetrated beyond the  external portal of things, and roamed through the sanctuaries. Where  they beheld only a drop of rain slowly rolling down the window-glass,  I saw a universe of beings animated with all the passions common to  physical life, and convulsing their minute sphere with struggles as  fierce and protracted as those of men. In the common spots of mould,  which my mother, good housekeeper that she was, fiercely scooped  away from her jam-pots, there abode for me, under the name of mildew,  enchanted gardens, filled with dells and avenues of the densest foliage  and most astonishing verdure, while from the fantastic boughs of these  microscopic forests hung strange fruits glittering with green and silver  and gold.    It was no scientific thirst that at this time filled my mind. It was the  pure enjoyment of a poet to whom a world of wonders has been disclosed.  I talked of my solitary pleasures to none. Alone with my microscope, I  dimmed my sight, day after day and night after night, poring over the  marvels which it unfolded to me. I was like one who, having discovered  the ancient Eden still existing in all its primitive glory, should  resolve to enjoy it in solitude, and never betray to mortal the secret  of its locality. The rod of my life was bent at this moment. I destined  myself to be a microscopist.    Of course, like every novice, I fancied myself a discoverer. I was  ignorant at the time of the thousands of acute intellects engaged in the  same pursuit as myself, and with the advantage of instruments a thousand  times more powerful than mine. The names of Leeuwenhoek, Williamson,  Spencer, Ehrenberg, Schultz, Dujardin, Schact, and Schleiden were then  entirely unknown to me, or, if known, I was ignorant of their patient  and wonderful researches. In every fresh specimen of cryptogamia which  I placed beneath my instrument I believed that I discovered wonders  of which the world was as yet ignorant. I remember well the thrill  of delight and admiration that shot through me the first time that I  discovered the common wheel animalcule (Rotifera vulgaris) expanding  and contracting its flexible spokes and seemingly rotating through the  water. Alas! as I grew older, and obtained some works treating of my  favorite study, I found that I was only on the threshold of a science  to the investigation of which some of the greatest men of the age were  devoting their lives and intellects.    As I grew up, my parents, who saw but little likelihood of anything  practical resulting from the examination of bits of moss and drops of  water through a brass tube and a piece of glass, were anxious that I  should choose a profession.    It was their desire that I should enter the counting-house of my uncle,  Ethan Blake, a prosperous merchant, who carried on business in New  York. This suggestion I decisively combated. I had no taste for trade; I  should only make a failure; in short, I refused to become a merchant.    But it was necessary for me to select some pursuit. My parents were  staid New England people, who insisted on the necessity of labor, and  therefore, although, thanks to the bequest of my poor Aunt Agatha, I  should, on coming of age, inherit a small fortune sufficient to place me  above want, it was decided that, instead of waiting for this, I should  act the nobler part, and employ the intervening years in rendering  myself independent.    After much cogitation, I complied with the wishes of my family, and  selected a profession. I determined to study medicine at the New York  Academy. This disposition of my future suited me. A removal from my  relatives would enable me to dispose of my time as I pleased without  fear of detection. As long as I paid my Academy fees, I might shirk  attending the lectures if I chose; and, as I never had the remotest  intention of standing an examination, there was no danger of my being  \"plucked.\" Besides, a metropolis was the place for me. There I could  obtain excellent instruments, the newest publications, intimacy with  men of pursuits kindred with my own--in short, all things necessary to  ensure a profitable devotion of my life to my beloved science. I had an  abundance of money, few desires that were not bounded by my illuminating  mirror on one side and my object-glass on the other; what, therefore,  was to prevent my becoming an illustrious investigator of the veiled  worlds? It was with the most buoyant hope that I left my New England  home and established myself in New York.          II    My first step, of course, was to find suitable apartments. These I  obtained, after a couple of days' search, in Fourth Avenue; a very  pretty second floor, unfurnished, containing sitting-room, bedroom,  and a smaller apartment which I intended to fit up as a laboratory. I  furnished my lodgings simply, but rather elegantly, and then devoted  all my energies to the adornment of the temple of my worship. I visited  Pike, the celebrated optician, and passed in review his splendid  collection of microscopes--Field's Compound, Hingham's, Spencer's,  Nachet's Binocular (that founded on the principles of the stereoscope),  and at length fixed upon that form known as Spencer's Trunnion  Microscope, as combining the greatest number of improvements with an  almost perfect freedom from tremor. Along with this I purchased  every possible accessory--draw-tubes, micrometers, a _camera lucida_,  lever-stage, achromatic condensers, white cloud illuminators, prisms,  parabolic condensers, polarizing apparatus, forceps, aquatic boxes,  fishing-tubes, with a host of other articles, all of which would have  been useful in the hands of an experienced microscopist, but, as I  afterward discovered, were not of the slightest present value to me. It  takes years of practice to know how to use a complicated microscope. The  optician looked suspiciously at me as I made these valuable purchases.  He evidently was uncertain whether to set me down as some scientific  celebrity or a madman. I think he was inclined to the latter belief. I  suppose I was mad. Every great genius is mad upon the subject in which  he is greatest. The unsuccessful madman is disgraced and called a  lunatic.    Mad or not, I set myself to work with a zeal which few scientific  students have ever equaled. I had everything to learn relative to the  delicate study upon which I had embarked--a study involving the most  earnest patience, the most rigid analytic powers, the steadiest hand,  the most untiring eye, the most refined and subtle manipulation.    For a long time half my apparatus lay inactively on the shelves of  my laboratory, which was now most amply furnished with every possible  contrivance for facilitating my investigations. The fact was that I did  not know how to use some of my scientific implements--never having been  taught microscopies--and those whose use I understood theoretically were  of little avail until by practice I could attain the necessary delicacy  of handling. Still, such was the fury of my ambition, such the untiring  perseverance of my experiments, that, difficult of credit as it may  be, in the course of one year I became theoretically and practically an  accomplished microscopist.

From \"In the Midst of Life,\" copyright, 1898,  by G. P. Putnam's Sons          I    By THE light of a tallow candle, which had been placed on one end of a  rough table, a man was reading something written in a book. It was an  old account book, greatly worn; and the writing was not, apparently,  very legible, for the man sometimes held the page close to the flame of  the candle to get a stronger light upon it. The shadow of the book would  then throw into obscurity a half of the room, darkening a number of  faces and figures; for besides the reader, eight other men were present.  Seven of them sat against the rough log walls, silent and motionless,  and, the room being small, not very far from the table. By extending an  arm any one of them could have touched the eighth man, who lay on the  table, face upward, partly covered by a sheet, his arms at his sides. He  was dead.    The man with the book was not reading aloud, and no one spoke; all  seemed to be waiting for something to occur; the dead man only was  without expectation. From the blank darkness outside came in, through  the aperture that served for a window, all the ever unfamiliar noises  of night in the wilderness--the long, nameless note of a distant coyote;  the stilly pulsing thrill of tireless insects in trees; strange cries of  night birds, so different from those of the birds of day; the drone of  great blundering beetles, and all that mysterious chorus of small sounds  that seem always to have been but half heard when they have suddenly  ceased, as if conscious of an indiscretion. But nothing of all this was  noted in that company; its members were not overmuch addicted to idle  interest in matters of no practical importance; that was obvious in  every line of their rugged faces--obvious even in the dim light of the  single candle. They were evidently men of the vicinity--farmers and  woodmen.    The person reading was a trifle different; one would have said of him  that he was of the world, worldly, albeit there was that in his  attire which attested a certain fellowship with the organisms of his  environment. His coat would hardly have passed muster in San Francisco:  his footgear was not of urban origin, and the hat that lay by him on  the floor (he was the only one uncovered) was such that if one had  considered it as an article of mere personal adornment he would have  missed its meaning. In countenance the man was rather prepossessing,  with just a hint of sternness; though that he may have assumed or  cultivated, as appropriate to one in authority. For he was a coroner. It  was by virtue of his office that he had possession of the book in which  he was reading; it had been found among the dead man's effects--in his  cabin, where the inquest was now taking place.    When the coroner had finished reading he put the book into his breast  pocket. At that moment the door was pushed open and a young man entered.  He, clearly, was not of mountain birth and breeding: he was clad as  those who dwell in cities. His clothing was dusty, however, as from  travel. He had, in fact, been riding hard to attend the inquest.    The coroner nodded; no one else greeted him.    \"We have waited for you,\" said the coroner. \"It is necessary to have  done with this business to-night.\"    The young man smiled. \"I am sorry to have kept you,\" he said. \"I went  away, not to evade your summons, but to post to my newspaper an account  of what I suppose I am called back to relate.\"    The coroner smiled.    \"The account that you posted to your newspaper,\" he said, \"differs  probably from that which you will give here under oath.\"    \"That,\" replied the other, rather hotly and with a visible flush, \"is as  you choose. I used manifold paper and have a copy of what I sent. It was  not written as news, for it is incredible, but as fiction. It may go as  a part of my testimony under oath.\"    \"But you say it is incredible.\"    \"That is nothing to you, sir, if I also swear that it is true.\"    The coroner was apparently not greatly affected by the young man's  manifest resentment. He was silent for some moments, his eyes upon the  floor. The men about the sides of the cabin talked in whispers, but  seldom withdrew their gaze from the face of the corpse. Presently the  coroner lifted his eyes and said: \"We will resume the inquest.\"    The men removed their hats. The witness was sworn.    \"What is your name?\" the coroner asked.    \"William Harker.\"    \"Age?\"    \"Twenty-seven.\"    \"You knew the deceased, Hugh Morgan?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"You were with him when he died?\"    \"Near him.\"    \"How did that happen--your presence, I mean?\"    \"I was visiting him at this place to shoot and fish. A part of my  purpose, however, was to study him, and his odd, solitary way of life.  He seemed a good model for a character in fiction. I sometimes write  stories.\"    \"I sometimes read them.\"    \"Thank you.\"    \"Stories in general--not yours.\"    Some of the jurors laughed. Against a sombre background humor shows high  lights. Soldiers in the intervals of battle laugh easily, and a jest in  the death chamber conquers by surprise.    \"Relate the circumstances of this man's death,\" said the coroner. \"You  may use any notes or memoranda that you please.\"    The witness understood. Pulling a manuscript from his breast pocket  he held it near the candle, and turning the leaves until he found the  passage that he wanted, began to read.          II    \"...The sun had hardly risen when we left the house. We were looking for  quail, each with a shotgun, but we had only one dog. Morgan said that  our best ground was beyond a certain ridge that he pointed out, and we  crossed it by a trail through the _chaparral_. On the other side was  comparatively level ground, thickly covered with wild oats. As we  emerged from the _chaparral_, Morgan was but a few yards in advance.  Suddenly, we heard, at a little distance to our right, and partly in  front, a noise as of some animal thrashing about in the bushes, which we  could see were violently agitated.    \"'We've started a deer,' said. 'I wish we had brought a rifle.'    \"Morgan, who had stopped and was intently watching the agitated  chaparral, said nothing, but had cocked both barrels of his gun, and was  holding it in readiness to aim. I thought him a trifle excited, which  surprised me, for he had a reputation for exceptional coolness, even in  moments of sudden and imminent peril.    \"'O, come!' I said. 'You are not going to fill up a deer with  quail-shot, are you?'    \"Still he did not reply; but, catching a sight of his face as he  turned it slightly toward me, I was struck by the pallor of it. Then I  understood that we had serious business on hand, and my first conjecture  was that we had 'jumped' a grizzly. I advanced to Morgan's side, cocking  my piece as I moved.    \"The bushes were now quiet, and the sounds had ceased, but Morgan was as  attentive to the place as before.    \"'What is it? What the devil is it?' I asked.    \"'That Damned Thing!' he replied, without turning his head. His voice  was husky and unnatural. He trembled visibly.    \"I was about to speak further, when I observed the wild oats near the  place of the disturbance moving in the most inexplicable way. I can  hardly describe it. It seemed as if stirred by a streak of wind, which  not only bent it, but pressed it down--crushed it so that it did not  rise, and this movement was slowly prolonging itself directly toward us.    \"Nothing that I had ever seen had affected me so strangely as this  unfamiliar and unaccountable phenomenon, yet I am unable to recall any  sense of fear. I remember--and tell it here because, singularly enough,  I recollected it then--that once, in looking carelessly out of an open  window, I momentarily mistook a small tree close at hand for one of a  group of larger trees at a little distance away. It looked the same size  as the others, but, being more distinctly and sharply defined in mass  and detail, seemed out of harmony with them. It was a mere falsification  of the law of aerial perspective, but it startled, almost terrified me.  We so rely upon the orderly operation of familiar natural laws that any  seeming suspension of them is noted as a menace to our safety, a warning  of unthinkable calamity. So now the apparently causeless movement of the  herbage, and the slow, undeviating approach of the line of disturbance  were distinctly disquieting. My companion appeared actually frightened,  and I could hardly credit my senses when I saw him suddenly throw his  gun to his shoulders and fire both barrels at the agitated grass! Before  the smoke of the discharge had cleared away I heard a loud savage  cry--a scream like that of a wild animal--and, flinging his gun upon the  ground, Morgan sprang away and ran swiftly from the spot. At the same  instant I was thrown violently to the ground by the impact of something  unseen in the smoke--some soft, heavy substance that seemed thrown  against me with great force.    \"Before I could get upon my feet and recover my gun, which seemed to  have been struck from my hands, I heard Morgan crying out as if in  mortal agony, and mingling with his cries were such hoarse savage sounds  as one hears from fighting dogs. Inexpressibly terrified, I struggled to  my feet and looked in the direction of Morgan's retreat; and may heaven  in mercy spare me from another sight like that! At a distance of less  than thirty yards was my friend, down upon one knee, his head thrown  back at a frightful angle, hatless, his long hair in disorder and his  whole body in violent movement from side to side, backward and forward.  His right arm was lifted and seemed to lack the hand--at least, I  could see none. The other arm was invisible. At times, as my memory  now reports this extraordinary scene, I could discern but a part of his  body; it was as if he had been partly"]]]
