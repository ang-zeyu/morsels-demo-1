He drove to the opera with the idea of paying  them a visit in their box after the easy Italian fashion; and when  he had obtained his admittance--it was one of the secondary  theatres--looked about the large, bare, ill-lighted house. An act  had just terminated and he was at liberty to pursue his quest. After  scanning two or three tiers of boxes he perceived in one of the largest  of these receptacles a lady whom he easily recognised. Miss Archer was  seated facing the stage and partly screened by the curtain of the box;  and beside her, leaning back in his chair, was Mr. Gilbert Osmond. They  appeared to have the place to themselves, and Warburton supposed their  companions had taken advantage of the recess to enjoy the relative  coolness of the lobby. He stood a while with his eyes on the interesting  pair; he asked himself if he should go up and interrupt the harmony. At  last he judged that Isabel had seen him, and this accident determined  him. There should be no marked holding off. He took his way to the upper  regions and on the staircase met Ralph Touchett slowly descending, his  hat at the inclination of ennui and his hands where they usually were.    \"I saw you below a moment since and was going down to you. I feel lonely  and want company,\" was Ralph's greeting.    \"You've some that's very good which you've yet deserted.\"    \"Do you mean my cousin? Oh, she has a visitor and doesn't want me. Then  Miss Stackpole and Bantling have gone out to a cafe to eat an ice--Miss  Stackpole delights in an ice. I didn't think they wanted me either.  The opera's very bad; the women look like laundresses and sing like  peacocks. I feel very low.\"    \"You had better go home,\" Lord Warburton said without affectation.    \"And leave my young lady in this sad place? Ah no, I must watch over  her.\"    \"She seems to have plenty of friends.\"    \"Yes, that's why I must watch,\" said Ralph with the same large  mock-melancholy.    \"If she doesn't want you it's probable she doesn't want me.\"    \"No, you're different. Go to the box and stay there while I walk about.\"    Lord Warburton went to the box, where Isabel's welcome was as to a  friend so honourably old that he vaguely asked himself what queer  temporal province she was annexing. He exchanged greetings with Mr.  Osmond, to whom he had been introduced the day before and who, after he  came in, sat blandly apart and silent, as if repudiating competence in  the subjects of allusion now probable. It struck her second visitor  that Miss Archer had, in operatic conditions, a radiance, even a  slight exaltation; as she was, however, at all times a keenly-glancing,  quickly-moving, completely animated young woman, he may have been  mistaken on this point. Her talk with him moreover pointed to presence  of mind; it expressed a kindness so ingenious and deliberate as to  indicate that she was in undisturbed possession of her faculties. Poor  Lord Warburton had moments of bewilderment. She had discouraged him,  formally, as much as a woman could; what business had she then with  such arts and such felicities, above all with such tones of  reparation--preparation? Her voice had tricks of sweetness, but why play  them on HIM? The others came back; the bare, familiar, trivial opera  began again. The box was large, and there was room for him to remain  if he would sit a little behind and in the dark. He did so for half an  hour, while Mr. Osmond remained in front, leaning forward, his elbows  on his knees, just behind Isabel. Lord Warburton heard nothing, and from  his gloomy corner saw nothing but the clear profile of this young  lady defined against the dim illumination of the house. When there was  another interval no one moved. Mr. Osmond talked to Isabel, and Lord  Warburton kept his corner. He did so but for a short time, however;  after which he got up and bade good-night to the ladies. Isabel said  nothing to detain him, but it didn't prevent his being puzzled again.  Why should she mark so one of his values--quite the wrong one--when she  would have nothing to do with another, which was quite the right? He was  angry with himself for being puzzled, and then angry for being angry.  Verdi's music did little to comfort him, and he left the theatre and  walked homeward, without knowing his way, through the tortuous, tragic  streets of Rome, where heavier sorrows than his had been carried under  the stars.    \"What's the character of that gentleman?\" Osmond asked of Isabel after  he had retired.    \"Irreproachable--don't you see it?\"    \"He owns about half England; that's his character,\" Henrietta remarked.  \"That's what they call a free country!\"    \"Ah, he's a great proprietor? Happy man!\" said Gilbert Osmond.    \"Do you call that happiness--the ownership of wretched human beings?\"  cried Miss Stackpole. \"He owns his tenants and has thousands of them.  It's pleasant to own something, but inanimate objects are enough for me.  I don't insist on flesh and blood and minds and consciences.\"    \"It seems to me you own a human being or two,\" Mr. Bantling suggested  jocosely. \"I wonder if Warburton orders his tenants about as you do me.\"    \"Lord Warburton's a great radical,\" Isabel said. \"He has very advanced  opinions.\"    \"He has very advanced stone walls. His park's enclosed by a gigantic  iron fence, some thirty miles round,\" Henrietta announced for the  information of Mr. Osmond. \"I should like him to converse with a few of  our Boston radicals.\"    \"Don't they approve of iron fences?\" asked Mr. Bantling.    \"Only to shut up wicked conservatives. I always feel as if I were  talking to YOU over something with a neat top-finish of broken glass.\"    \"Do you know him well, this unreformed reformer?\" Osmond went on,  questioning Isabel.    \"Well enough for all the use I have for him.\"    \"And how much of a use is that?\"    \"Well, I like to like him.\"    \"'Liking to like'--why, it makes a passion!\" said Osmond.    \"No\"--she considered--\"keep that for liking to DISlike.\"    \"Do you wish to provoke me then,\" Osmond laughed, \"to a passion for  HIM?\"    She said nothing for a moment, but then met the light question with a  disproportionate gravity. \"No, Mr. Osmond; I don't think I should ever  dare to provoke you. Lord Warburton, at any rate,\" she more easily  added, \"is a very nice man.\"    \"Of great ability?\" her friend enquired.    \"Of excellent ability, and as good as he looks.\"    \"As good as he's good-looking do you mean? He's very good-looking. How  detestably fortunate!--to be a great English magnate, to be clever and  handsome into the bargain, and, by way of finishing off, to enjoy your  high favour! That's a man I could envy.\"    Isabel considered him with interest. \"You seem to me to be always  envying some one. Yesterday it was the Pope; to-day it's poor Lord  Warburton.\"    \"My envy's not dangerous; it wouldn't hurt a mouse. I don't want to  destroy the people--I only want to BE them. You see it would destroy  only myself.\"    \"You'd like to be the Pope?\" said Isabel.    \"I should love it--but I should have gone in for it earlier. But  why\"--Osmond reverted--\"do you speak of your friend as poor?\"    \"Women--when they are very, very good sometimes pity men after they've  hurt them; that's their great way of showing kindness,\" said Ralph,  joining in the conversation for the first time and with a cynicism so  transparently ingenious as to be virtually innocent.    \"Pray, have I hurt Lord Warburton?\" Isabel asked, raising her eyebrows  as if the idea were perfectly fresh.    \"It serves him right if you have,\" said Henrietta while the curtain rose  for the ballet.    Isabel saw no more of her attributive victim for the next twenty-four  hours, but on the second day after the visit to the opera she  encountered him in the gallery of the Capitol, where he stood before the  lion of the collection, the statue of the Dying Gladiator. She had come  in with her companions, among whom, on this occasion again, Gilbert  Osmond had his place, and the party, having ascended the staircase,  entered the first and finest of the rooms. Lord Warburton addressed her  alertly enough, but said in a moment that he was leaving the gallery.  \"And I'm leaving Rome,\" he added. \"I must bid you goodbye.\" Isabel,  inconsequently enough, was now sorry to hear it. This was perhaps  because she had ceased to be afraid of his renewing his suit; she was  thinking of something else. She was on the point of naming her regret,  but she checked herself and simply wished him a happy journey; which  made him look at her rather unlightedly. \"I'm afraid you'll think me  very 'volatile.' I told you the other day I wanted so much to stop.\"    \"Oh no; you could easily change your mind.\"    \"That's what I have done.\"    \"Bon voyage then.\"    \"You're in a great hurry to get rid of me,\" said his lordship quite  dismally.    \"Not in the least. But I hate partings.\"    \"You don't care what I do,\" he went on pitifully.    Isabel looked at him a moment. \"Ah,\" she said, \"you're not keeping your  promise!\"    He coloured like a boy of fifteen. \"If I'm not, then it's because I  can't; and that's why I'm going.\"    \"Good-bye then.\"    \"Good-bye.\" He lingered still, however. \"When shall I see you again?\"    Isabel hesitated, but soon, as if she had had a happy inspiration: \"Some  day after you're married.\"    \"That will never be. It will be after you are.\"    \"That will do as well,\" she smiled.    \"Yes, quite as well. Good-bye.\"    They shook hands, and he left her alone in the glorious room, among the  shining antique marbles. She sat down in the centre of the circle of  these presences, regarding them vaguely, resting her eyes on their  beautiful blank faces; listening, as it were,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28346"],[0,"Deathworld (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  https://www.pgdp.net                    [Illustration]      DEATHWORLD    BY HARRY HARRISON    Illustrated by van Dongen          _Some planet in the galaxy must--by definition--be the toughest,      meanest, nastiest of all. If Pyrrus wasn't it ... it was an awfully      good approximation!_      Jason dinAlt sprawled in soft luxury on the couch, a large frosty stein  held limply in one hand. His other hand rested casually on a pillow. The  gun behind the pillow was within easy reach of his fingers. In his line  of work he never took chances.    It was all highly suspicious. Jason didn't know a soul on this planet.  Yet the card sent by service tube from the hotel desk had read: _Kerk  Pyrrus would like to see Jason dinAlt_. Blunt and to the point. He  signaled the desk to send the man up, then lowered his fingers a bit  until they brushed the gun butt. The door slid open and his visitor  stepped through.    _A retired wrestler._ That was Jason's first thought. Kerk Pyrrus was a  gray-haired rock of a man. His body seemingly chiseled out of flat slabs  of muscle. Then Jason saw the gun strapped to the inside of the other  man's forearm, and he let his fingers drop casually behind the pillow.    \"I'd appreciate it,\" Jason said, \"if you'd take off your gun while  you're in here.\" The other man stopped and scowled down at the gun as if  he was seeing it for the first time.    \"No, I never take it off.\" He seemed mildly annoyed by the suggestion.    Jason had his fingers on his own gun when he said, \"I'm afraid I'll have  to insist. I always feel a little uncomfortable around people who wear  guns.\" He kept talking to distract attention while he pulled out his  gun. Fast and smooth.    He could have been moving in slow motion for all the difference it made.  Kerk Pyrrus stood rock still while the gun came out, while it swung in  his direction. Not until the very last instant did he act. When he did,  the motion wasn't visible. First his gun was in the arm holster--then it  was aimed between Jason's eyes. It was an ugly, heavy weapon with a  pitted front orifice that showed plenty of use.    And Jason knew if he swung his own weapon up a fraction of an inch more  he would be dead. He dropped his arm carefully and Kerk flipped his own  gun back in the holster with the same ease he had drawn it.    \"Now,\" the stranger said, \"if we're through playing, let's get down to  business. I have a proposition for you.\"    Jason downed a large mouthful from the mug and bridled his temper. He  was fast with a gun--his life had depended on it more than once--and  this was the first time he had been outdrawn. It was the offhand,  unimportant manner it had been done that irritated him.    \"I'm not prepared to do business,\" he said acidly. \"I've come to  Cassylia for a vacation, get away from work.\"    \"Let's not fool each other, dinAlt,\" Kerk said impatiently. \"You've  never worked at an honest job in your entire life. You're a professional  gambler and that's why I'm here to see you.\"    Jason forced down his anger and threw the gun to the other end of the  couch so he wouldn't be tempted to commit suicide. He _had_ hoped no  one knew him on Cassylia and was looking forward to a big kill at the  Casino. He would worry about that later. This weight-lifter type seemed  to know all the answers. Let him plot the course for a while and see  where it led.    \"All right, what do you want?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Kerk dropped into a chair that creaked ominously under his weight, and  dug an envelope out of one pocket. He flipped through it quickly and  dropped a handful of gleaming Galactic Exchange notes onto the table.  Jason glanced at them--then sat up suddenly.    \"What are they--forgeries?\" he asked, holding one up to the light.    \"They're real enough,\" Kerk told him, \"I picked them up at the bank.  Exactly twenty-seven bills--or twenty-seven million credits. I want you  to use them as a bankroll when you go to the Casino tonight. Gamble with  them and win.\"    They looked real enough--and they could be checked. Jason fingered them  thoughtfully while he examined the other man.    \"I don't know what you have in mind,\" he said. \"But you realize I can't  make any guarantees. I gamble--but I don't always win ...\"    \"You gamble--and you win when you want to,\" Kerk said grimly. \"We looked  into that quite carefully before I came to you.\"    \"If you mean to say that I cheat--\" Carefully, Jason grabbed his temper  again and held it down. There was no future in getting annoyed.    Kerk continued in the same level voice, ignoring Jason's growing anger.  \"Maybe you don't call it cheating, frankly I don't care. As far as I'm  concerned you could have your suit lined with aces and electromagnets in  your boots. As long as you _won_. I'm not here to discuss moral points  with you. I said I had a proposition.    \"We have worked hard for that money--but it still isn't enough. To be  precise, we need three billion credits. The only way to get that sum is  by gambling--with these twenty-seven million as bankroll.\"    \"And what do I get out of it?\" Jason asked the question coolly, as if  any bit of the fantastic proposition made sense.    \"Everything above the three billion you can keep, that should be fair  enough. You're not risking your own money, but you stand to make enough  to keep you for life if you win.\"    \"And if I lose--?\"    Kerk thought for a moment, not liking the taste of the idea. \"Yes--there  is the chance you might lose, I hadn't thought about that.\"    He reached a decision. \"If you lose--well I suppose that is just a risk  we will have to take. Though I think I would kill you then. The ones who  died to get the twenty-seven million deserve at least that.\" He said it  quietly, without malice, and it was more of a promise than a threat.    Stamping to his feet Jason refilled his stein and offered one to Kerk  who took it with a nod of thanks. He paced back and forth, unable to  sit. The whole proposition made him angry--yet at the same time had a  fatal fascination. He was a gambler and this talk was like the taste of  drugs to an addict.    Stopping suddenly, he realized that his mind had been made up for some  time. Win or lose--live or die--how could he say no to the chance to  gamble with money like that! He turned suddenly and jabbed his finger at  the big man in the chair.    \"I'll do it--you probably knew I would from the time you came in here.  There are some terms of my own, though. I want to know who you are, and  who _they_ are you keep talking about. And where did the money come  from. Is it stolen?\"    Kerk drained his own stein and pushed it away from him.    \"Stolen money? No, quite the opposite. Two years' work mining and  refining ore to get it. It was mined on Pyrrus and sold here on  Cassylia. You can check on that very easily. I sold it. I'm the Pyrric  ambassador to this planet.\" He smiled at the thought. \"Not that that  means much, I'm ambassador to at least six other planets as well. Comes  in handy when you want to do business.\"    Jason looked at the muscular man with his gray hair and worn,  military-cut clothes, and decided not to laugh. You heard of strange  things out in the frontier planets and every word could be true. He had  never heard of Pyrrus either, though that didn't mean anything. There  were over thirty-thousand known planets in the inhabited universe.    \"I'll check on what you have told me,\" Jason said. \"If it's true, we can  do business. Call me tomorrow--\"    \"No,\" Kerk said. \"The money has to be won tonight. I've already issued a  check for this twenty-seven million, it will bounce as high as the  Pleiades unless we deposit the money in the morning, so that's our time  limit.\"    With each moment the whole affair became more fantastic--and more  intriguing for Jason. He looked at his watch. There was still enough  time to find out if Kerk was lying or not.    \"All right, we'll do it tonight,\" he said. \"Only I'll have to have one  of those bills to check.\"    Kerk stood up to go. \"Take them all, I won't be seeing you again until  after you've won. I'll be at the Casino of course, but don't recognize  me. It would be much better if they didn't know where your money was  coming from or how much you had.\"    Then he was gone, after a bone-crushing handclasp that closed on Jason's  hand like vise jaws. Jason was alone with the money. Fanning the bills  out like a hand of cards he stared at their sepia and gold faces, trying  to get the reality through his head. Twenty-seven million credits. What  was to stop him from just walking out the door with them and vanishing.  Nothing really, except his own sense of honor.    Kerk Pyrrus, the man with the same last name as the planet he came  from, was the universe's biggest fool. Or he knew just what he was  doing. From the way the interview had gone the latter seemed the better  bet.    \"He _knows_ I would much rather gamble with the money than steal it,\" he  said wryly.    Slipping a small gun into his waistband holster and pocketing the money  he went out.          II.      The robot teller at the bank just pinged with electronic shock when he  presented one of the bills and flashed a panel that directed him to see  Vice President Wain. Wain was a smooth customer who bugged his eyes and  lost some of his tan when he saw the sheaf of bills.    \"You ... wish to deposit these with us?\" he asked while his fingers  unconsciously stroked them.    \"Not today,\" Jason said. \"They were paid to me as a debt. Would you  please check that they are authentic and change them? I'd like five  hundred thousand credit notes.\"    Both of his inner chest pockets were packed tight when he left the bank.  The bills were good and he felt like a walking mint. This was the first  time in his entire life that carrying a large sum of money made him  uncomfortable. Waving to a passing helicab he"]]]
