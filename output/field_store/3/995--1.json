Order I. PYGOPODES    GREBES. Family COLYMBIDAE    Grebes are birds having a ducklike body, but with pointed bills. Their  feet, too, are unlike those of the Ducks, each toe having its separate  web, and having a broad flat nail. Their wings are very small for the  size of the body, making it impossible for them to rise in flight from  the land. They rise from the water by running a few yards along the  surface until they have secured sufficient headway to allow them to  launch themselves into the air. After having risen from the water their  flight is very swift and strong. On land they are very awkward and can  only progress by a series of awkward hops; they generally lie flat on  their breasts, but occasionally stand up, supporting themselves upon  their whole tarsus. Grebes, together with the Loons, are the most expert  aquatic birds that we have, diving like a flash and swimming for an  incredible distance under water.    Page 11    1. WESTERN GREBE. _Aechmophorus occidentalis_.    Range.--Western parts of North America, from southern Alaska southward;  east to Minnesota and south in winter to the southern parts of the  United States and Mexico. Breeds from the Dakotas and northern  California northward. These are the largest of the American Grebes;  owing to their unusually long necks, they are frequently called \"Swan  Grebes.\" They are very timid birds and conceal themselves in the rushes  on the least suspicion of danger. At times, to escape observation, they  will entirely submerge their body, leaving only their head and part of  the long neck visible above the water. This Grebe cannot be mistaken for  any other because of the long slender neck and the long pointed bill,  which has a slight upward turn. They nest abundantly in the marshes of  North Dakota and central Canada. Their nests are made of decayed rushes,  and are built over the water, being fastened to the rushes so that the  bottom of the nest rests in the water. The nesting season is at its  height during the latter part of May. They lay from three to five eggs,  the ground color of which is a pale blue; this color is, however, always  concealed by a thin chalky deposit, and this latter is frequently  stained to a dirty white.

Actually these devices represent two different approaches to  the problem of time-keeping. True ancestor of the clock is to be found  among the highly complex astronomical machines which man has been  building since Hellenic times to illustrate the relative motions of the  heavenly bodies._    _This study--its findings will be used in preparing the Museum's new  hall on the history of time-keeping--traces this ancestry back through  2,000 years of history on three continents._    THE AUTHOR: _Derek J. de Solla Price wrote this paper while serving as  consultant to the Museum of History and Technology of the Smithsonian  Institution's United States National Museum._        In each successive age this construction, having become    lost, is, by the Sun's favour, again revealed to some one    or other at his pleasure. (_S[=u]rya Siddh[=a]nta_, ed.    Burgess, xiii, 18-19.)      THE HISTORIES of the mechanical clock and the magnetic compass must be  accounted amongst the most tortured of all our efforts to understand the  origins of man's important inventions. Ignorance has too often been  replaced by conjecture, and conjecture by misquotation and the false  authority of \"common knowledge\" engendered by the repetition of  legendary histories from one generation of textbooks to the next. In  what follows, I can only hope that the adding of a strong new trail and  the eradication of several false and weaker ones will lead us nearer to  a balanced and integrated understanding of medieval invention and the  intercultural transmission of ideas.    For the mechanical clock, perhaps the greatest hindrance has been its  treatment within a self-contained \"history of time measurement\" in which  sundials, water-clocks and similar devices assume the natural role of  ancestors to the weight-driven escapement clock in the early 14th  century.[1] This view must presume that a generally sophisticated  knowledge of gearing antedates the invention of the clock and extends  back to the Classical period of Hero and Vitruvius and such authors  well-known for their mechanical ingenuities.    Furthermore, even if one admits the use of clocklike gearing before the  existence of the clock, it is still necessary to look for the  independent inventions of the weight-drive and of the mechanical  escapement. The first of these may seem comparatively trivial; anyone  familiar with the raising of heavy loads by means of ropes and pulley  could surely recognize the possibility of using such an arrangement in  reverse as a source of steady power. Nevertheless, the use of this  device is not recorded before its association with hydraulic and  perpetual motion machines in the manuscripts of Ri[d.]w[=a]n, _ca._ 1200,  and its use in a clock using such a perpetual motion wheel (mercury  filled) as a clock escapement, in the astronomical codices of Alfonso  the Wise, King of Castile, _ca._ 1272.    The second invention, that of the mechanical escapement, has presented  one of the most tantalizing of problems. Without doubt, the crown and  foliot type of escapement appears to be the first complicated mechanical  invention known to the European Middle Ages; it heralds our whole age of  machine-making. Yet no trace has been found either of a steady evolution  of such escapements or of their invention in Europe, though the  astronomical clock powered by a water wheel and governed by an  escapement-like device had been elaborated in China for several  centuries before the first appearance of our clocks. We must now  rehearse a revised story of the origin of the clock as it has been  suggested by recent researches on the history of gearing and on Chinese  and other astronomical machines. After this we shall for the first time  present evidence to show that this story is curiously related to that of  the _Perpetuum Mobile_, one of the great chimeras of science, that came  from its medieval origin to play an important part in more recent  developments of energetics and the foundations of thermodynamics.[2] It  is a curious mixture, all the more so because, tangled inextricably in  it, we shall find the most important and earliest references to the use  of the magnetic compass in the West. It seems that in revising the  histories of clockwork and the magnetic compass, these considerations  of perpetual motion devices may provide some much needed evidence.    [Illustration: Figure 1.--FRAMEWORK STRUCTURE OF THE ASTRONOMICAL CLOCK  of Giovanni de Dondi of Padua, A.D. 1364.]          Power and Motion Gearing    It may be readily accepted that the use of toothed wheels to transmit  power or turn it through an angle was widespread in all cultures several  centuries before the beginning of our era. Certainly, in classical times  they were already familiar to Archimedes (born 287 B.C.),[3] and in  China actual examples of wheels and moulds for wheels dating from the  4th century B.C. have been preserved.[4] It might be remarked that  these \"machine\" gear wheels are characterized by having a \"round number\"  of teeth (examples with 16, 24 and 40 teeth are known) and a shank with  a square hole which fits without turning on a squared shaft. Another  remarkable feature in these early gears is the use of ratchet-shaped  teeth, sometimes even twisted helically so that the gears resemble worms  intermeshing on parallel axles.[5] The existence of windmills and  watermills testifies to the general familiarity, from classical times  and through the middle ages, with the use of gears to turn power through  a right angle.    [Illustration: Figure 2.--ASTRONOMICAL CLOCK of de Dondi, showing  gearing on the dial for Mercury and escapement crown wheel. Each of the  seven side walls of the structure shown in figure 1 was fitted with a  dial.]    Granted, then, this use of gears, one must guard against any conclusion  that the fine-mechanical use of gears to provide special ratios of  angular movement was similarly general and widespread. It is customary  to adduce here the evidence of the hodometer (taximeter) described by  Vitruvius (1st century B.C.) and by Hero of Alexandria (1st century  A.D.) and the ingenious automata also described by this latter author  and his Islamic followers.[6] One may also cite the use of the reduction  gear chain in power machinery as used in the geared windlass of  Archimedes and Hero.    Unfortunately, even the most complex automata described by Hero and by  such authors as Ri[d.]w[=a]n contain gearing in no more extensive context  than as a means of transmitting action around a right angle. As for the  windlass and hodometer, they do, it is true, contain whole series of  gears used in steps as a reduction mechanism, usually for an  extraordinarily high ratio, but here the technical details are so  etherial that one must doubt whether such devices were actually realized  in practice. Thus Vitruvius writes of a wheel 4 feet in diameter and  having 400 teeth being turned by a 1-toothed pinion on a cart axle, but  it is very doubtful whether such small teeth, necessarily separated by  about 3/8 inch, would have the requisite ruggedness. Again, Hero  mentions a wheel of 30 teeth which, because of imperfections, might need  only 20 turns of a single helix worm to turn it! Such statements behove  caution and one must consider whether we have been misled by the  16th- and 17th-century editions of these authors, containing  reconstructions now often cited as authoritative but then serving as  working diagrams for practical use in that age when the clock was  already a familiar and complex mechanism. At all events, even if one  admits without substantial evidence that such gear reduction devices  were familiar from Hellenistic times onwards, they can hardly serve as  more than very distant ancestors of the earliest mechanical clocks.          Mechanical Clocks    Before proceeding to a discussion of the controversial evidence which  may be used to bridge this gap between the first use of gears and the  fully-developed mechanical clock we must examine the other side of this  gap. Recent research on the history of early mechanical clocks has  demonstrated certain peculiarities most relevant to our present  argument.      THE EUROPEAN TRADITION    If one is to establish a _terminus ante quem_ for the appearance of the  mechanical clock in Europe, it would appear that 1364 is a most  reasonable date. At that time we have the very full mechanical and  historical material concerning the horological masterpiece built by  Giovanni de Dondi of Padua,[7] and probably started as early as 1348. It  might well be possible to set a date a few decades earlier, but in  general as one"]]]
