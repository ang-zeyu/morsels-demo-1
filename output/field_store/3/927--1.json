A lackey at once got down to open the carriage door;  but a sweet, though rather tremulous voice stopped him, saying, \"Wait,  while I see whether this is the place.\"    Then a head, muffled so closely in a black satin mantle that no feature  could be distinguished, was thrust from one of the carriage windows, and  looking around, seemed to seek for some decisive sign on the house  front. The unknown lady appeared to be satisfied by her inspection, for  she turned back to her companion.    \"It is here,\" said she. \"There is the sign.\"    As a result of this certainty, the carriage door was opened, the two  women alighted, and after having once more raised their eyes to a strip  of wood, some six or eight feet long by two broad, which was nailed  above the windows of the second storey, and bore the inscription,  \"Madame Voison, midwife,\" stole quickly into a passage, the door of  which was unfastened, and in which there was just so much light as  enabled persons passing in or out to find their way along the narrow  winding stair that led from the ground floor to the fifth story.    The two strangers, one of whom appeared to be of far higher rank than  the other, did not stop, as might have been expected, at the door  corresponding with the inscription that had guided them, but, on the  contrary, went on to the next floor.    Here, upon the landing, was a kind of dwarf, oddly dressed after the  fashion of sixteenth-century Venetian buffoons, who, when he saw the two  women coming, stretched out a wand, as though to prevent them from going  farther, and asked what they wanted.    \"To consult the spirit,\" replied the woman of the sweet and tremulous  voice.    \"Come in and wait,\" returned the dwarf, lifting a panel of tapestry and  ushering the two women into a waiting-room.    The women obeyed, and remained for about half an hour, seeing and  hearing nothing. At last a door, concealed by the tapestry, was suddenly  opened; a voice uttered the word \"Enter,\" and the two women were  introduced into a second room, hung with black, and lighted solely by a  three-branched lamp that hung from the ceiling. The door closed behind  them, and the clients found themselves face to face with the sibyl.    She was a woman of about twenty-five or twenty-six, who, unlike other  women, evidently desired to appear older than she was. She was dressed  in black; her hair hung in plaits; her neck, arms, and feet were bare;  the belt at her waist was clasped by a large garnet which threw out  sombre fires. In her hand she held a wand, and she was raised on a sort  of platform which stood for the tripod of the ancients, and from which  came acrid and penetrating fumes; she was, moreover, fairly handsome,  although her features were common, the eyes only excepted, and these, by  some trick of the toilet, no doubt, looked inordinately large, and, like  the garnet in her belt, emitted strange lights.    When the two visitors came in, they found the soothsayer leaning her  forehead on her hand, as though absorbed in thought. Fearing to rouse  her from her ecstasy, they waited in silence until it should please her  to change her position. At the end of ten minutes she raised her head,  and seemed only now to become aware that two persons were standing  before her.    \"What is wanted of me again?\" she asked, \"and shall I have rest only in  the grave?\"    \"Forgive me, madame,\" said the sweet-voiced unknown, \"but I am wishing  to know----\"    \"Silence!\" said the sibyl, in a solemn voice. \"I will not know your  affairs. It is to the spirit that you must address yourself; he is a  jealous spirit, who forbids his secrets to be shared; I can but pray to  him for you, and obey his will.\"    At these words, she left her tripod, passed into an adjoining room, and  soon returned, looking even paler and more anxious than before, and  carrying in one hand a burning chafing dish, in the other a red paper.  The three flames of the lamp grew fainter at the same moment, and the  room was left lighted up only by the chafing dish; every object now  assumed a fantastic air that did not fail to disquiet the two visitors,  but it was too late to draw back.    The soothsayer placed the chafing dish in the middle of the room,  presented the paper to the young woman who had spoken, and said to her--    \"Write down what you wish to know.\"    The woman took the paper with a steadier hand than might have been  expected, seated herself at a table, and wrote:--    \"Am I young? Am I beautiful? Am I maid, wife, or widow? This is for the  past.    \"Shall I marry, or marry again? Shall I live long, or shall I die young?  This is for the future.\"    Then, stretching out her hand to the soothsayer, she asked--    \"What am I to do now with this?\"    \"Roll that letter around this ball,\" answered the other, handing to the  unknown a little ball of virgin wax. \"Both ball and letter will be  consumed in the flame before your eyes; the spirit knows your secrets  already. In three days you will have the answer.\"    The unknown did as the sibyl bade her; then the latter took from her  hands the ball and the paper in which it was wrapped, and went and threw  both into the chafing pan.    \"And now all is done as it should be,\" said the soothsayer. \"Comus!\"    The dwarf came in.    \"See the lady to her coach.\"    The stranger left a purse upon the table, and followed Comus. He  conducted her and her companion, who was only a confidential maid, down  a back staircase, used as an exit, and leading into a different street  from that by which the two women had come in; but the coachman, who had  been told beforehand of this circumstance, was awaiting them at the  door, and they had only to step into their carriage, which bore them  rapidly away in the direction of the rue Dauphine.    Three days later, according to the promise given her, the fair unknown,  when she awakened, found on the table beside her a letter in an  unfamiliar handwriting; it was addressed \"To the beautiful Provencale,\"  and contained these words--    \"You are young; you are beautiful; you are a widow. This is for the  present.    \"You will marry again; you will die young, and by a violent death. This  is for the future.    \"THE SPIRIT.\"    The answer was written upon a paper like that upon which the questions  had been set down.    The marquise turned pale and uttered a faint cry of terror; the answer  was so perfectly correct in regard to the past as to call up a fear that  it might be equally accurate in regard to the future.    The truth is that the unknown lady wrapped in a mantle whom we have  escorted into the modern sibyl's cavern was no other than the beautiful  Marie de Rossan, who before her marriage had borne the name of  Mademoiselle de Chateaublanc, from that of an estate belonging to her  maternal grandfather, M. Joannis de Nocheres, who owned a fortune of  five to six hundred thousand livres. At the age of thirteen--that is to  say, in 1649--she had married the Marquis de Castellane, a gentleman of  very high birth, who claimed to be descended from John of Castille, the  son of Pedro the Cruel, and from Juana de Castro, his mistress. Proud of  his young wife's beauty, the Marquis de Castellane, who was an officer  of the king's galleys, had hastened to present her at court. Louis XIV,  who at the time of her presentation was barely twenty years old, was  struck by her enchanting face, and to the great despair of the famous  beauties of the day danced with her three times in one evening. Finally,  as a crowning touch to her reputation, the famous Christina of Sweden,  who was then at the French court, said of her that she had never, in any  of the kingdoms through which she had passed, seen anything equal to  \"the beautiful Provencale.\" This praise had been so well received, that  the name of \"the beautiful Provencale\" had clung to Madame de  Castellane, and she was everywhere known by it.    This favour of Louis XIV and this summing up of Christina's had been  enough to bring the Marquise de Castellane instantly into fashion; and  Mignard, who had just received a patent of nobility and been made  painter to the king, put the seal to her celebrity by asking leave to  paint her portrait. That portrait still exists, and gives a perfect  notion of the beauty which it represents; but as the portrait is far  from our readers' eyes, we will content ourselves by repeating, in its  own original words, the one given in 1667 by the author of a pamphlet  published at Rouen under the following title: True and Principal  Circumstances of the Deplorable Death of Madame the Marquise de Ganges:    [Note: It is from this pamphlet, and from the Account of the Death of  Madame the Marquise de Ganges, formerly Marquise de Castellane, that we  have borrowed the principal circumstances of this tragic story. To these  documents we must add--that we may not be constantly referring our  readers to original sources--the Celebrated Trials by Guyot de Pitaval,  the Life of Marie de Rossan, and the Lettres galantes of Madame  Desnoyers.]    \"Her complexion, which was of a dazzling whiteness, was illumined by not  too brilliant a red, and art itself could not have arranged more  skilfully the gradations by which this red joined and merged into the  whiteness of the complexion.

The Man in the Iron Mask we're  familiar with today is the last volume of the four-volume edition.  [Not all the editions split them in the same manner, hence some of the  confusion...but wait...there's yet more reason for confusion.]    We intend to do ALL of The Vicomte de Bragelonne, split into four  etexts entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later, Louise de la  Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask.    One thing that may be causing confusion is that the etext we have now,  entitled Ten Years Later, says it's the sequel to The Three Musketeers.  While this is technically true, there's another book, Twenty Years  After, that comes between. The confusion is generated by the two facts  that we published Ten Years Later BEFORE we published Twenty Years  After, and that many people see those titles as meaning Ten and Twenty  Years \"After\" the original story...however, this is why the different  words \"After\" and \"Later\"...the Ten Years \"After\" is ten years after  the Twenty Years later...as per history. Also, the third book of the  D'Artagnan Romances, while entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, has the  subtitle Ten Years Later. These two titles are also given to different  volumes: The Vicomte de Bragelonne can refer to the whole book, or the  first volume of the three or four-volume editions. Ten Years Later  can, similarly, refer to the whole book, or the second volume of the  four-volume edition. To add to the confusion, in the case of our etexts,  it refers to the first 104 chapters of the whole book, covering material  in the first and second etexts in the new series. Here is a guide to the  series which may prove helpful:    The Three Musketeers: Etext 1257--First book of the D'Artagnan Romances.  Covers the years 1625-1628.    Twenty Years After: Etext 1259--Second book of the D'Artagnan Romances.  Covers the years 1648-1649. [Third in the order that we published, but  second in time sequence!!!]    Ten Years Later: Etext 1258--First 104 chapters of the third book of the  D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the years 1660-1661.    The Vicomte de Bragelonne: Etext 2609 (first in the new series)--First  75 chapters of the third book of the D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the  year 1660.    Ten Years Later: Etext 2681 (second in the new series)--Chapters  76-140 of that third book of the D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the years  1660-1661.

The Man in the Iron Mask: Etext 2759 (our next text)--Chapters  209-269 of the third book of the D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the years  1661-1673.

Introduction:    In the months of March-July in 1844, in the magazine Le Siecle, the  first portion of a story appeared, penned by the celebrated playwright  Alexandre Dumas. It was based, he claimed, on some manuscripts he had  found a year earlier in the Bibliotheque Nationale while researching a  history he planned to write on Louis XIV. They chronicled the adventures  of a young man named D'Artagnan who, upon entering Paris, became almost  immediately embroiled in court intrigues, international politics, and  ill-fated affairs between royal lovers. Over the next six years, readers  would enjoy the adventures of this youth and his three famous friends,  Porthos, Athos, and Aramis, as their exploits unraveled behind the  scenes of some of the most momentous events in French and even English  history.    Eventually these serialized adventures were published in novel form,  and became the three D'Artagnan Romances known today. Here is a brief  summary of the first two novels:    The Three Musketeers (serialized March--July, 1844): The year is 1625.  The young D'Artagnan arrives in Paris at the tender age of 18, and  almost immediately offends three musketeers, Porthos, Aramis, and Athos.  Instead of dueling, the four are attacked by five of the Cardinal's  guards, and the courage of the youth is made apparent during the battle.  The four become fast friends, and, when asked by D'Artagnan's landlord  to find his missing wife, embark upon an adventure that takes them  across both France and England in order to thwart the plans of the  Cardinal Richelieu. Along the way, they encounter a beautiful young spy,  named simply Milady, who will stop at nothing to disgrace Queen Anne of  Austria before her husband, Louis XIII, and take her revenge upon the  four friends.    Twenty Years After (serialized January--August, 1845): The year is now  1648, twenty years since the close of the last story. Louis XIII has  died, as has Cardinal Richelieu, and while the crown of France may sit  upon the head of Anne of Austria as Regent for the young Louis XIV,  the real power resides with the Cardinal Mazarin, her secret husband.  D'Artagnan is now a lieutenant of musketeers, and his three friends have  retired to private life. Athos turned out to be a nobleman, the Comte de  la Fere, and has retired to his home with his son, Raoul de Bragelonne.  Aramis, whose real name is D'Herblay, has followed his intention of  shedding the musketeer's cassock for the priest's robes, and Porthos has  married a wealthy woman, who left him her fortune upon her death. But  trouble is stirring in both France and England. Cromwell menaces the  institution of royalty itself while marching against Charles I, and at  home the Fronde is threatening to tear France apart. D'Artagnan brings  his friends out of retirement to save the threatened English monarch,  but Mordaunt, the son of Milady, who seeks to avenge his mother's death  at the musketeers' hands, thwarts their valiant efforts. Undaunted, our  heroes return to France just in time to help save the young Louis XIV,  quiet the Fronde, and tweak the nose of Cardinal Mazarin.    The third novel, The Vicomte de Bragelonne (serialized October,  1847--January, 1850), has enjoyed a strange history in its English  translation. It has been split into three, four, or five volumes at  various points in its history. The five-volume edition generally does  not give titles to the smaller portions, but the others do. In the  three-volume edition, the novels are entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne,  Louise de la Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask. For the purposes of  this etext, I have chosen to split the novel as the four-volume edition  does, with these titles: The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later,  Louise de la Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask. In the first three  etexts:    The Vicomte de Bragelonne (Etext 2609): It is the year 1660, and  D'Artagnan, after thirty-five years of loyal service, has become  disgusted with serving King Louis XIV while the real power resides with  the Cardinal Mazarin, and has tendered his resignation. He embarks on  his own project, that of restoring Charles II to the throne of England,  and, with the help of Athos, succeeds, earning himself quite a fortune  in the process. D'Artagnan returns to Paris to live the life of a rich  citizen, and Athos, after negotiating the marriage of Philip, the king's  brother, to Princess Henrietta of England, likewise retires to his own  estate, La Fere. Meanwhile, Mazarin has finally died, and left Louis to  assume the reigns of power, with the assistance of M. Colbert, formerly  Mazarin's trusted clerk. Colbert has an intense hatred for M. Fouquet,  the king's superintendent of finances, and has resolved to use any  means necessary to bring about his fall. With the new rank of intendant  bestowed on him by Louis, Colbert succeeds in having two of Fouquet's  loyal friends tried and executed. He then brings to the king's attention  that Fouquet is fortifying the island of Belle-Ile-en-Mer, and could  possibly be planning to use it as a base for some military operation  against the king. Louis calls D'Artagnan out of retirement and sends  him to investigate the island, promising him a tremendous salary and his  long-promised promotion to captain of the musketeers upon his return. At  Belle-Isle, D'Artagnan discovers that the engineer of the fortifications  is, in fact, Porthos, now the Baron du Vallon, and that's not all.  The blueprints for the island, although in Porthos's handwriting,  show evidence of another script that has been erased, that of Aramis.  D'Artagnan later discovers that Aramis has become the bishop of Vannes,  which is, coincidentally, a parish belonging to M. Fouquet. Suspecting  that D'Artagnan has arrived on the king's behalf to investigate, Aramis  tricks D'Artagnan into wandering around Vannes in search of Porthos,  and sends Porthos on an heroic ride back to Paris to warn Fouquet of  the danger. Fouquet rushes to the king, and gives him Belle-Isle as a  present, thus allaying any suspicion, and at the same time humiliating  Colbert, just minutes before"]]]
