WATSON, M.D., _late  of the Army Medical Department._) [2]          CHAPTER I. MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.      IN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the  University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course  prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,  I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant  Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before  I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at  Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and  was already deep in the enemy's country. I followed, however, with many  other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded  in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once  entered upon my new duties.    The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had  nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and  attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of  Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which  shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have  fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the  devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a  pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.    Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had  undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to  the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved  so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little  upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse  of our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and  when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and  emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost  in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the  troopship \"Orontes,\" and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with  my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal  government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.    I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as  air--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will  permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to  London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of  the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at  a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless  existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely  than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that  I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate  somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in  my style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making  up my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less  pretentious and less expensive domicile.    On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at  the Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning  round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at  Barts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is  a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never  been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm,  and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the  exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and  we started off together in a hansom.    \"Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?\" he asked in  undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.  \"You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.\"    I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it  by the time that we reached our destination.    \"Poor devil!\" he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my  misfortunes. \"What are you up to now?\"    \"Looking for lodgings.\" [3] I answered. \"Trying to solve the problem  as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable  price.\"    \"That's a strange thing,\" remarked my companion; \"you are the second man  to-day that has used that expression to me.\"    \"And who was the first?\" I asked.    \"A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.  He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone  to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which  were too much for his purse.\"    \"By Jove!\" I cried, \"if he really wants someone to share the rooms and  the expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner  to being alone.\"    Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. \"You  don't know Sherlock Holmes yet,\" he said; \"perhaps you would not care  for him as a constant companion.\"    \"Why, what is there against him?\"    \"Oh, I didn't say there was anything against him. He is a little queer  in his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I  know he is a decent fellow enough.\"    \"A medical student, I suppose?\" said I.    \"No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well  up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,  he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are  very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way  knowledge which would astonish his professors.\"    \"Did you never ask him what he was going in for?\" I asked.    \"No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be  communicative enough when the fancy seizes him.\"    \"I should like to meet him,\" I said. \"If I am to lodge with anyone, I  should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong  enough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in  Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How  could I meet this friend of yours?\"    \"He is sure to be at the laboratory,\" returned my companion. \"He either  avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to  night. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.\"    \"Certainly,\" I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other  channels.    As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford  gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to  take as a fellow-lodger.    \"You mustn't blame me if you don't get on with him,\" he said; \"I know  nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in  the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me  responsible.\"    \"If we don't get on it will be easy to part company,\" I answered. \"It  seems to me, Stamford,\" I added, looking hard at my companion, \"that you  have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow's  temper so formidable, or what is it? Don't be mealy-mouthed about it.\"    \"It is not easy to express the inexpressible,\" he answered with a laugh.  \"Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes--it approaches to  cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of  the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand,  but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea  of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself  with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite and  exact knowledge.\"    \"Very right too.\"    \"Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the  subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking  rather a bizarre shape.\"    \"Beating the subjects!\"    \"Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him  at it with my own eyes.\"    \"And yet you say he is not a medical student?\"    \"No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we  are, and you must form your own impressions about him.\" As he spoke, we  turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which  opened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me,  and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and  made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed  wall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage  branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.    This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.

MARIA GENTILE      ITALIAN BOOK CO.    NEW YORK      COPYRIGHT 1919    BY    ITALIAN BOOK CO.          PREFACE      One of the beneficial results of the Great War has been the teaching of  thrift to the American housewife. For patriotic reasons and for reasons  of economy, more attention has been bestowed upon the preparing and  cooking of food that is to be at once palatable, nourishing and  economical.    In the Italian =cuisine= we find in the highest degree these three  qualities. That it is palatable, all those who have partaken of food in  an Italian =trattoria= or at the home of an Italian family can testify,  that it is healthy the splendid manhood and womanhood of Italy is a  proof more than sufficient. And who could deny, knowing the thriftiness  of the Italian race, that it is economical?    It has therefore been thought that a book of PRACTICAL RECIPES OF THE  ITALIAN CUISINE could be offered to the American public with hope of  success. It is not a pretentious book, and the recipes have been made as  clear and simple as possible. Some of the dishes described are not  peculiar to Italy. All, however, are representative of the =Cucina  Casalinga= of the peninsular Kingdom, which is not the least product  of a lovable and simple people, among whom the art of living well and  getting the most out of life at a moderate expense has been attained to  a very high degree.          1    BROTH OR SOUP STOCK    (Brodo)    To obtain good broth the meat must be put in cold water, and then  allowed to boil slowly. Add to the meat some pieces of bones and \"soup  greens\" as, for instance, celery, carrots and parsley. To give a brown  color to the broth, some sugar, first browned at the fire, then diluted  in cold water, may be added.    While it is not considered that the broth has much nutritive power, it  is excellent to promote the digestion. Nearly all the Italian soups are  made on a basis of broth.    A good recipe for substantial broth to be used for invalids is the  following: Cut some beef in thin slices and place them in a large  saucepan; add some salt. Pour cold water upon them, so that they are  entirely covered. Cover the saucepan so that it is hermetically closed  and place on the cover a receptacle containing water, which must be  constantly renewed. Keep on a low fire for six hours, then on a strong  fire for ten minutes. Strain the liquid in cheese cloth.    The soup stock, besides being used for soups, is a necessary ingredient  in hundreds of Italian dishes.      2    SOUP OF \"CAPPELLETTI\"    This Soup is called of \"=Cappelletti=\" or \"little hats\" on account of  the shape of the \"=Cappelletti=\".    First a thin sheet of paste is made according to the following  directions:    The best and most tender paste is made simply of eggs, flour and salt,  water may be substituted for part of the eggs, for economy, or when a  less rich paste is needed. Allow about a cup of flour to an egg. Put the  flour on a bread board, make a hollow in the middle and break in the  egg. Use any extra whites that are on hand. Knead it thoroughly, adding  more flour if necessary, until you have a paste you can roll out. Roll  it as thin as an eighth of an inch. A long rolling pin is necessary, but  any stick, well scrubbed and sand papered, will serve in lieu of the  long Italian rolling pin.    Cut from this sheet of paste rounds measuring about three inches in  diameter. In the middle of each circle place a spoonful of filling that  must be made beforehand, composed of cooked meat (chicken, pork or veal)  ground very fine and seasoned with grated cheese, grated lemon peel,  nutmeg, allspice, salt. The ground meat is to be mixed with an equal  amount of curds or cottage cheese.    When the filling is placed in the circle of paste, fold the latter over  and moisten the edge of the paste with the finger dipped in water to  make it stay securely closed.    These =cappelletti= should be cooked in chicken or beef broth until the  paste is tender, and served with this broth as a soup.      3    BREAD SOUP    (Panata)    This excellent and nutritious soup is a godsend for using the stale  bread that must never again be thrown away. It is composed of bread  crumbs and grated bread, eggs, grated cheese, nutmeg (in very small  quantity) and salt, all mixed together and put in broth previously  prepared, which must be warm at the moment of the immersion, but not at  the boiling point. Then place it on a low fire and stir gently. Any  vegetable left over may be added.      4    GNOCCHI    This is an excellent soup, but as it requires boiled or roast breast of  chicken or turkey it is well to make it only when these ingredients are  handy.    Prepare a certain quantity of boiled potatoes, the mealy kind being  preferred. Mash the potatoes and mix them with chicken or turkey breast  well ground, grated cheese (Parmesan or Swiss), two or more yolks of  eggs, salt and a small quantity of nutmeg. Pour the compound on the  bread board with a quantity of flour sufficient to make a paste and roll  it in little sticks as thick as the small finger. Cut the sticks in  little pieces about half an inch long and put them in boiling water.  Five or six minutes' cooking will be sufficient.      5    VEGETABLE SOUP    (Zuppa Sante)    Any kind of vegetables may be used for this soup: carrots, celery,  cabbage, turnips, onions, potatoes, spinach, the outside leaves of  lettuce or greens of any variety.    Select three or four kind of vegetables, shred or chop coarsely cabbage  or greens, and slice or cut in cubes the root vegetables. Put them over  the fire with a small quantity of cooking oil or butter substitute, and  let them fry until they have absorbed the fat. Then add broth and cook  until the vegetables are very tender. Fry croutons of stale bread in oil  and serve them in the soup.      6    QUEEN'S SOUP    (Zuppa Regina)    This is made with the white meat of chicken, which is to be ground in a  meat grinder together with blanched almonds (5 or 6) for one quart of  chicken stock. To the meat and almond add some bread crumbs, first  soaked in milk or broth, in the proportion of about one fifth of the  quantity of the meat. All these ingredients are to be rubbed to a very  smooth paste and hot broth is to be added to them. If you wish the soup  to be richer and have a more milky consistency, use the yolk of an egg,  which should be beaten, and have a few tablespoonfuls of hot broth  stirred into it before adding to the soup. Do not let the soup boil  after the egg is added or it will curdle.    One slice of stale bread may be cut into cubes, fried in deep fat, and  the croutons put in the soup. Send it to the table with a dish of grated  cheese.      7    BEAN SOUP    (Zuppa di fagiuoli)    One cup of dried beans, kidney, navy or lima is to be soaked over night.  Then boil until tender. It is preferable to put the beans to cook in  cold water with a pinch of soda. When they come to boil, pour off this  water and add fresh.    Chop fine 1/4 onion, one clove of garlic, one sprig of parsley and one  piece of celery and put them to fry in 1/4 cup of oil with salt and a  generous amount of pepper. When the vegetables are a delicate brown add  to them two cups of the broth from the beans and 1 cup of tomatoes  (canned or fresh). Let all come to a boil and pour the mixture into the  kettle of beans from which some of the water has been drained, if they  are very liquid. This soup may be served as it is or rubbed through a  sieve before serving. Croutons or triangles of dry toast make an  excellent addition.    The bean soup is made without meat or chicken broth, and it belongs  consequently to that class of soup called by the Italians \"=Minestra di  Magro=\" or \"lean soup,\" to be served preferably on Friday and other days  in which the Roman Catholic Church prohibits the use of meats.      8    LENTIL SOUP    (Zuppa di lenticchie)    The lentil soup is prepared in the same way as the bean soup, only  substituting lentils for beans. A good combination is that of lentils  and rice. The nutritive qualities of the lentils are not sufficiently  known in this country, but all books on dietetics speak very highly of  them.      9    VEGETABLE CHOWDER    (Minestrone alla Milanese)    Cut off the rind of 1/2 lb. salt pork and put it into two quarts of  water to boil. Cut off a small slice of the pork and beat it to a paste  with two or three sprigs of parsley, a little celery and one kernel of  garlic. Add this paste to the pork and water. Slice two carrots, cut the  rib out of the leaves of 1/4 medium sized cabbage. Add the carrots,  cabbage leaves, other vegetables, seasoning and butter to the soup, and  let it boil slowly for 2-1/2 hours. The last 1/2 hour add one small  handful of rice for each person.    When the pork is very soft, remove and slice in little ribbons and put  it back.    The minestrone is equally good eaten cold.      10    RAVIOLI    Put on the bread board about two pounds of flour in a heap; make a  hollow in the middle and put in it a piece of butter, three egg-yolks,  salt and three or four tablespoonfuls of lukewarm water. Make a paste  and knead it well, then let it stand for an hour, wrapped or covered  with a linen cloth. Then spread the paste to a thin sheet, as thin as a  ten-cent piece.    Chop and grind pieces of roast or boiled chicken meat: add to it an  equal part of marrow from the bones of beef and pieces of brains, three  yolks, some crumbs of bread soaked in milk or broth and some grated  cheese (Parmesan or Swiss). Rub through a sieve and make"]]]
