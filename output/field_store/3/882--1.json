LOLA    or    The Thought and Speech of Animals        BY    HENNY KINDERMANN        TRANSLATED BY AGNES BLAKE      WITH A CHAPTER ON THINKING ANIMALS BY    DR. WILLIAM MACKENZIE        METHUEN & CO.

Numerals that are printed as superscript are indicated by being  preceeded by a caret (^).        PREFACE      It is hoped that this little work may assist in the search along the  dark path upon which many a poet and--in later times--many an  investigator has set his feet. It would not be worthy of us, whom  science and technical ability has raised to so high an intellectual  position as explorers of Nature in every field--should we neglect  anything however trivial, deeming it as beneath our notice.    We know so much about all that lies around us: the manner in which the  cells build our bodies; how the juices circulate within the plant. We  feel Nature to be ensouled, to be a spiritual entity--and yet--it is  only her corporeal life with which we are intimate. Therefore let us  now turn our eyes to new horizons, so that the human spirit may be  in a position to extend its search, doing so with knowledge and  understanding. What is imperative is that we should investigate to  what degree the higher animals have been dowered with sensibility, and  to what extent this can be utilized: whether it can crystallize--so  to speak--into what is known to us as _thought_. My own work of  investigation was undertaken in a spirit entirely devoid of prejudice;  and what I have so far discovered I now place in the hands of the  reader, asking him to bring the same unbiased and objective attitude of  mind to bear when reading these pages. It is my hope that they may  arouse his interest and instil that broader attitude of thought which  should lead to further investigation, since a question so serious and  important does not permit of being lightly set aside.    I have given a short preliminary account of earlier investigations  undertaken in this field of research, before inviting the reader to  accompany me along the path I myself pursued into this New Land.

WILLIAM MACKENZIE)            157          In recording the remarks made and answers given by these dogs I  have--wherever it seemed possible to do so without loss of a certain  distinctive charm--inserted the English translation _only_; here  and there, however, where, for instance, the conversation between  mistress and dog has turned on the spelling of a word it has been  necessary to give the entire sentence in German. There are also some  quaint remarks of which I have been loth to omit the original, these  being sure to appeal to anyone acquainted with idiomatic German.    THE TRANSLATOR          LOLA    THOUGHT CAPACITY IN ANIMALS      It was in the year 1904 that the first experiments towards  understanding an animal's ability to think were brought into public  light. Wilhelm von Osten then introduced his stallion Hans II to all  who seemed interested in the subject, and the most diametrically  opposed opinions were soon rife with regard to the abilities of this  horse, to which von Osten maintained he had succeeded in teaching both  spelling and arithmetic.    The animal's mental activity was said to lie in a simple form of  thinking, called into being and intensified by means of a certain  amount of instruction. Von Osten, who had been a schoolmaster, had  previously spent some fourteen years in testing the intelligence of two  other horses before he ventured to make his experiences public, and the  performances of these animals were not only remarkable, but of  far-reaching importance.    Hans I, aged twelve, died in 1905. He had never appeared in public,  since his abilities had been relatively modest. He had, nevertheless,  been able to count up to five, as well as carry out quite a number of  verbal instructions. It was Hans II, however, that convinced his  master--as early as 1902--of his ability to comprehend a far greater  range of the German alphabet (when written), as well as to recognize a  certain number of colours.    Instances, denoting signs of evident reflection and memory, had led to  Wilhelm von Osten turning his thoughts towards this work of animal  tuition. Public opinion was divided; there were some who took the  subject seriously and who were grateful to this innovator for thus  opening a new path of inquiry; yet many were sceptical--and the  scientific commission called together in 1904 to investigate the  subject, finally knew no better than to heap their ridicule on the  careful and patient labours of a lifetime. \"Der kluge Hans\" (\"wise\" or  \"clever Hans\")--by that time already a public character--now evoked  supercilious smiles and stood disgraced in the eyes of the majority.  Only a few, capable of delving more deeply into the subject, continued  to follow these performances with ever-increasing interest and  amazement and kept their faith whole.    Von Osten--though now embittered and pathetically silent--quietly  continued his experiments up to his death, which took place in 1909. At  first he had gone about his work alone, but he was joined subsequently  by Karl Krall, who then became known in connexion with this work for  the first time.    Many were the attempts made in certain quarters of the Press to account  for the facts of the case; the very simple means of procedure employed  by von Osten were scouted and the whole thing proclaimed to be based  upon trickery, influence, secret signs, an abnormal degree of training,  and what not--anything and everything was seized upon in order to come  into line with ordinary opinion.    Then, in the year 1905, Karl Krall, of Elberfeld, began his experiments  with Hans II, encouraging, as a foundation for the furtherance of his  theories, the abilities already developed in this horse, while devoting  a more profound measure of insight to the entire problem.    Karl Krall, who lavished an untold amount of time and money on the  question, has also raised it to an immeasurably higher plane. He has,  indeed, placed a remarkable collection of carefully selected material  at the service of the scientific world. With an unusual amount of  devotion, backed by patience and a genuine affection for his charges,  Karl Krall has carried on a work of investigation to which he assigns  no narrow limits; pursuing his labours with a cheerful energy, fully  convinced of the sacredness of his task.    Anyone who has come into contact with Krall must feel respect for this  man, whatever doubts he may harbour as to the results obtained.    In 1908 Krall started work with two Arab stallions, Zarif and Mohammed.  Both these animals learnt to count by means of rapping out the numbers  with their hoofs on a board. One rap with the left fore-hoof always  counted as \"ten,\" while each rap with the right fore-hoof counted as  \"one\" only. The number twenty-five was, therefore, composed of two left  raps and five right ones. Spelling was similarly indicated by a system  of raps meant to express separate letters of the alphabet. A pause  followed after each number and the answers, being displayed to sight in  the form of rows of numbers, it sufficed to place the letter thus  indicated beneath its respective number in order to work out the reply.  In the course of time these animals learnt the most varied forms of  "]]]
