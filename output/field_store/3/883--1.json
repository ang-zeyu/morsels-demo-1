COMPILED AND SELECTED BY       ADAM WHITE,     LATE ASSISTANT IN THE ZOOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT, BRITISH MUSEUM.       Second Edition.       LONDON:     JAMES NISBET & CO., 21 BERNERS STREET.     MDCCCLXX.          PREFACE.      In this work, a part of which is, so far as it extends, a careful  compilation from an extensive series of books, the great order mammalia,  or, rather, a few of its subjects, is treated anecdotically. The  connexion of certain animals with man, and the readiness with which man  can subdue even the largest of the mammalia, are very curious subjects  of thought. The dog and horse are our special friends and associates;  they seem to understand us, and we get very much attached to them. The  cat or the cow, again, possess a different degree of attachment, and  have \"heads and hearts\" less susceptible of this education than the  first mentioned. The anecdotes in this book will clearly show facts of  this nature. In the Letter of the Gorilla, under an appearance of  exaggeration, will be found many facts of its history. We have a strong  belief that natural history, written as White of Selborne did his Letter  of Timothy the Tortoise, would be very enticing and interesting to young  people. To make birds and other animals relate their stories has been  done sometimes, and generally with success. There are anecdotes hinging,  however, on animals which have more to do with man than the other  mammals referred to in the little story. These stories we have felt to  be very interesting when they occur in biographies of great men. Cowper  and his Hares, Huygens and his Sparrow, are tales--at least the  former--full of interesting matter on the history of the lower animal,  but are of most value as showing the influence on the man who amused  himself by taming them. We like to know that the great Duke, after  getting down from his horse Copenhagen, which carried him through the  whole battle of Waterloo, clapped him on the neck, when the war-charger  kicked out, as if untired.    We could have added greatly to this book, especially in the part of  jests, puns, or cases of _double entendre_. The few selected may  suffice. The so-called conversations of \"the Ettrick Shepherd\" are full  of matter of this kind, treated by \"Christopher North\" with a happy  combination of rare power of description and apt exaggeration of detail,  often highly amusing. One or two instances are given here, such as the  Fox-hunt and the Whale. The intention of this book is primarily to be  amusing; but it will be strange if it do not instruct as well. There is  much in it that is _true_ of the habits of mammalia. These, with birds,  are likely to interest young people generally, more than anecdotes of  members of orders like fish, insects, or molluscs, lower in the scale,  though often possessing marvellous instincts, the accounts of which form  intensely interesting reading to those who are fond of seeing or hearing  of \"the works of the Lord,\" and who \"take pleasure\" in them.

BRIEF FOREWORD      With sincere pleasure the author would acknowledge the uniform courtesy  of editors and publishers in permitting him to reprint many of the  articles comprised in this volume, from the various periodicals in which  they first appeared.    He also desires to express his special indebtedness to Mr. Charles E.  Aiken, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, whose contributions to the  ornithology of the West have been of great scientific value, and to  whose large and varied collection of bird-skins the author had frequent  access for the purpose of settling difficult points in bird  identification. This obliging gentleman also spent many hours in  conversation with the writer, answering his numerous questions with the  intelligence of the scientifically trained observer. Lastly, he kindly  corrected some errors into which the author had inadvertently fallen.    While the area covered by the writer's personal observations may be  somewhat restricted, yet the scientific bird-list at the close of the  volume widens the field so as to include the entire avi-fauna of  Colorado so far as known to systematic students. Besides, constant  comparison has been made between the birds of the West and the allied  species and genera of our Central and Eastern States. For this reason  the range of the volume really extends from the Atlantic seaboard to the  parks, valleys, and plateaus beyond the Continental Divide.    L. S. K.          All are needed by each one;      Nothing is fair or good alone.      I thought the sparrow's note from heaven,      Singing at dawn on the alder bough;      I brought him home, in his nest, at even;      He sings the song, but it cheers not now,      For I did not bring home the river and sky;--      He sang to my ear,--they sang to my eye.    RALPH WALDO EMERSON: _Each and All_.        Not from his fellows only man may learn      Rights to compare and duties to discern;      All creatures and all objects, in degree,      Are friends and patrons of humanity.      There are to whom the garden, grove, and field      Perpetual lessons of forbearance yield;      Who would not lightly violate the grace      The lowliest flower possesses in its place;      Nor shorten the sweet life, too fugitive,      Which nothing less than infinite Power could give.    WILLIAM WORDSWORTH: _Humanity_.        Sounds drop in visiting from everywhere--      The bluebird's and the robin's trill are there,      Their sweet liquidity diluted some      By dewy orchard spaces they have come.    JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY: _A Child World_.        Even in the city, I      Am ever conscious of the sky;      A portion of its frame no less      Than in the open wilderness.      The stars are in my heart by night,      I sing beneath the opening light,      As "]]]
