Preface To The Third Edition  The Case Of Wagner: A Musician's Problem  Nietzsche _contra_ Wagner  Selected Aphorisms from Nietzsche's Retrospect of his Years of Friendship  with Wagner.  Footnotes              TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.      Nietzsche wrote the rough draft of \"The Case of Wagner\" in Turin, during  the month of May 1888; he completed it in Sils Maria towards the end of  June of the same year, and it was published in the following autumn.  \"Nietzsche _contra_ Wagner\" was written about the middle of December 1888;  but, although it was printed and corrected before the New Year, it was not  published until long afterwards owing to Nietzsche's complete breakdown in  the first days of 1889.    In reading these two essays we are apt to be deceived, by their virulent  and forcible tone, into believing that the whole matter is a mere cover  for hidden fire,--a mere blind of aesthetic discussion concealing a deep and  implacable personal feud which demands and will have vengeance. In spite  of all that has been said to the contrary, many people still hold this  view of the two little works before us; and, as the actual facts are not  accessible to every one, and rumours are more easily believed than  verified, the error of supposing that these pamphlets were dictated by  personal animosity, and even by Nietzsche's envy of Wagner in his glory,  seems to be a pretty common one. Another very general error is to suppose  that the point at issue here is not one concerning music at all, but  concerning religion. It is taken for granted that the aspirations, the  particular quality, the influence, and the method of an art like music,  are matters quite distinct from the values and the conditions prevailing  in the culture with which it is in harmony, and that however many  Christian elements may be discovered in Wagnerian texts, Nietzsche had no  right to raise aesthetic objections because he happened to entertain the  extraordinary view that these Christian elements had also found their way  into Wagnerian music.    To both of these views there is but one reply:--they are absolutely false.    In the \"Ecce Homo,\" Nietzsche's autobiography,--a book which from cover to  cover and line for line is sincerity itself--we learn what Wagner actually  meant to Nietzsche. On pages 41, 44, 84, 122, 129, &c, we cannot doubt  that Nietzsche is speaking from his heart,--and what does he say?--In  impassioned tones he admits his profound indebtedness to the great  musician, his love for him, his gratitude to him,--how Wagner was the only  German who had ever been anything to him--how his friendship with Wagner  constituted the happiest and most valuable experience of his life,--how his  breach with Wagner almost killed him. And, when we remember, too, that  Wagner on his part also declared that he was \"alone\" after he had lost  \"that man\" (Nietzsche), we begin to perceive that personal bitterness and  animosity are out of the question here. We feel we are on a higher plane,  and that we must not judge these two men as if they were a couple of  little business people who had had a suburban squabble.    Nietzsche declares (\"Ecce Homo,\" p. 24) that he never attacked persons as  persons. If he used a name at all, it was merely as a means to an end,  just as one might use a magnifying glass in order to make a general, but  elusive and intricate fact more clear and more apparent, and if he used  the name of David Strauss, without bitterness or spite (for he did not  even know the man), when he wished to personify Culture-Philistinism, so,  in the same spirit, did he use the name of Wagner, when he wished to  personify the general decadence of modern ideas, values, aspirations and  Art.    Nietzsche's ambition, throughout his life, was to regenerate European  culture. In the first period of his relationship with Wagner, he thought  that he had found the man who was prepared to lead in this direction. For  a long while he regarded his master as the Saviour of Germany, as the  innovator and renovator who was going to arrest the decadent current of  his time and lead men to a greatness which had died with antiquity. And so  thoroughly did he understand his duties as a disciple, so wholly was he  devoted to this cause, that, in spite of all his unquestioned gifts and  the excellence of his original achievements, he was for a long while  regarded as a mere \"literary lackey\" in Wagner's service, in all those  circles where the rising musician was most disliked.    Gradually, however, as the young Nietzsche developed and began to gain an  independent view of life and humanity, it seemed to him extremely doubtful  whether Wagner actually was pulling the same way with him. Whereas,  theretofore, he had identified Wagner's ideals with his own, it now dawned  upon him slowly that the regeneration of German culture, of European  culture, and the transvaluation of values which would be necessary for  this regeneration, really lay off the track of Wagnerism. He saw that he  had endowed Wagner with a good deal that was more his own than Wagner's.  In his love he had transfigured the friend, and the composer of \"Parsifal\"  and the man of his imagination were not one. The fact was realised step by  step; disappointment upon disappointment, revelation after revelation,  ultimately brought it home to him, and though his best instincts at first  opposed it, the revulsion of feeling at last became too strong to be  scouted, and Nietzsche was plunged into the blackest despair. Had he  followed his own human inclinations, he would probably have remained  Wagner's friend until the end. As it was, however, he remained loyal to  his cause, and this meant denouncing his former idol.    \"Joyful Wisdom,\" \"Thus Spake Zarathustra,\" \"Beyond Good and Evil,\" \"The  Genealogy of Morals,\" \"The Twilight of the Idols,\" \"The Antichrist\"--all  these books were but so many exhortations to mankind to step aside from  the general track now trodden by Europeans. And what happened? Wagner  began to write some hard things about Nietzsche; the world assumed that  Nietzsche and Wagner had engaged in a paltry personal quarrel in the  press, and the whole importance of the real issue was buried beneath the  human, all-too-human interpretations which were heaped upon it.    Nietzsche was a musician of no mean attainments. For a long while, in his  youth, his superiors had been doubtful whether he should not be educated  for a musical career, so great were his gifts in this art; and if his  mother had not been offered a six-years' scholarship for her son at the  famous school of Pforta, Nietzsche, the scholar and philologist, would  probably have been an able composer. When he speaks about music,  therefore, he knows what he is talking about, and when he refers to  Wagner's music in particular, the simple fact of his long intimacy with  Wagner during the years at Tribschen, is a sufficient guarantee of his  deep knowledge of the subject. Now Nietzsche was one of the first to  recognise that the principles of art are inextricably bound up with the  laws of life, that an aesthetic dogma may therefore promote or depress all  vital force, and that a picture, a symphony, a poem or a statue, is just  as capable of being pessimistic, anarchic, Christian or revolutionary, as  a philosophy or a science is. To speak of a certain class of music as  being compatible with the decline of culture, therefore, was to Nietzsche  a perfectly warrantable association of ideas, and that is why, throughout  his philosophy, so much stress is laid upon aesthetic considerations.    But if in England and America Nietzsche's attack on Wagner's art may still  seem a little incomprehensible, let it be remembered that the Continent  has long known that Nietzsche was actually in the right. Every year  thousands are now added to the large party abroad who have ceased from  believing in the great musical revolutionary of the seventies; that he was  one with the French Romanticists and rebels has long since been  acknowledged a fact in select circles, both in France and Germany, and if  we still have Wagner with us in England, if we still consider Nietzsche as  a heretic, when he declares that \"Wagner was a musician for unmusical  people,\" it is only because we are more removed than we imagine, from all  the great movements, intellectual and otherwise, which take place on the  Continent.    In Wagner's music, in his doctrine, in his whole concept of art, Nietzsche  saw the confirmation, the promotion--aye, even the encouragement, of that  decadence and degeneration which is now rampant in Europe; and it is for  this reason, although to the end of his life he still loved Wagner, the  man and the friend, that we find him, on the very eve of his spiritual  death, exhorting us to abjure Wagner the musician and the artist.

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION(1)      In spite of the adverse criticism with which the above preface has met at  the hands of many reviewers since the summer of last year, I cannot say  that I should feel justified, even after mature consideration, in altering  a single word or sentence it contains. If I felt inclined to make any  changes at all, these would take the form of extensive additions, tending  to confirm rather than to modify the general argument it advances; but,  any omissions of which I may have been "]]]
