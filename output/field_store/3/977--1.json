THE AFTERMATH OF WAR    When the armies of the Union and of the Confederacy were disbanded in  1865, two matters had been settled beyond further dispute: the Negro was  to be free, and the Union was to be perpetuated. But, though slavery  and state sovereignty were no longer at issue, there were still many  problems which pressed for solution. The huge task of reconstruction  must be faced. The nature of the situation required that the measures of  reconstruction be first formulated in Washington by the victors and then  worked out in the conquered South. Since the success of these policies  would depend in a large measure upon their acceptability to both  sections of the country, it was expected that the North would be  influenced to some extent by the attitude of the Southern people, which  in turn would be determined largely by local conditions in the South.  The situation in the South at the close of the Civil War is, therefore,  the point at which this narrative of the reconstruction naturally takes  its beginning.    The surviving Confederate soldiers came straggling back to communities,  which were now far from being satisfactory dwelling places for civilized  people. Everywhere they found missing many of the best of their former  neighbors. They found property destroyed, the labor system disorganized,  and the inhabitants in many places suffering from want. They found the  white people demoralized and sometimes divided among themselves and the  Negroes free, bewildered, and disorderly, for organized government had  lapsed with the surrender of the Confederate armies.    Beneath a disorganized society lay a devastated land. The destruction of  property affected all classes of the population. The accumulated capital  of the South had disappeared in worthless Confederate stocks, bonds,  and currency. The banks had failed early in the war. Two billion dollars  invested in slaves had been wiped out. Factories, which had been running  before the war or were developed after 1861 in order to supply the  blockaded country, had been destroyed by Federal raiders or seized  and sold or dismantled because they had furnished supplies to the  Confederacy. Mining industries were paralyzed. Public buildings which  had been used for war purposes were destroyed or confiscated for the  uses of the army or for the new freedmen's schools. It was months before  courthouses, state capitols, school and college buildings were again  made available for normal uses. The military school buildings had been  destroyed by the Federal forces. Among the schools which suffered  were the Virginia Military Institute, the University of Alabama, the  Louisiana State Seminary, and many smaller institutions. Nearly all  these had been used in some way for war purposes and were therefore  subject to destruction or confiscation.    The farmers and planters found themselves \"land poor.\" The soil  remained, but there was a prevalent lack of labor, of agricultural  equipment, of farm stock, of seeds, and of money with which to make good  the deficiency. As a result, a man with hundreds of acres might be as  poor as a Negro refugee. The desolation is thus described by a Virginia  farmer:    \"From Harper's Ferry to New Market, which is about eighty miles... the  country was almost a desert.... We had no cattle, hogs, sheep, or horse  or anything else. The fences were all gone. Some of the orchards were  very much injured, but the fruit trees had not been destroyed. The barns  were all burned; chimneys standing without houses, and houses standing  without roof, or door, or window.\"    Much land was thrown on the market at low prices--three to five dollars  an acre for land worth fifty dollars. The poorer lands could not be sold  at all, and thousands of farms were deserted by their owners. Everywhere  recovery from this agricultural depression was slow. Five years after  the war Robert Somers, an English traveler, said of the Tennessee  Valley:    \"It consists for the most part of plantations in a state of semi-ruin  and plantations of which the ruin is for the present total and  complete.... The trail of war is visible throughout the valley in  burnt-up gin-houses, ruined bridges, mills, and factories... and in  large tracts of once cultivated land stripped of every vestige of  fencing. The roads, long neglected, are in disorder, and having in many  places become impassable, new tracks have been made through the woods  and fields without much respect to boundaries.\"    Similar conditions existed wherever the armies had passed, and not  in the country districts alone. Many of the cities, such as Richmond,  Charleston, Columbia, Jackson, Atlanta, and Mobile had suffered from  fire or bombardment.    There were few stocks of merchandise in the South when the war ended,  and Northern creditors had lost so heavily through the failure of  Southern merchants that they were cautious about extending credit again.  Long before 1865 all coin had been sent out in contraband trade through  the blockade. That there was a great need of supplies from the outside  world is shown by the following statement of General Boynton:    \"Window-glass has given way to thin boards, in railway coaches and in  the cities. Furniture is marred and broken, and none has been replaced  for four years. Dishes are cemented in various styles, and half the  pitchers have tin handles. A complete set of crockery is never seen, and  in very few families is there enough to set a table.... A set of forks  with whole tines is a curiosity. Clocks and watches have nearly all  stopped.... Hairbrushes and toothbrushes have all worn out; combs are  broken.... Pins, needles, and thread, and a thousand such articles,  which seem indispensable to housekeeping, are very scarce. Even in  weaving on the looms, corncobs have been substituted for spindles.  Few have pocketknives. In fact, everything that has heretofore been an  article of sale in the South is wanting now. At the tables of those  who were once esteemed luxurious providers you will find neither tea,  coffee, sugar, nor spices of any kind. Even candles, in some cases, have  been replaced by a cup of grease in which a piece of cloth is plunged  for a wick.\"    This poverty was prolonged and rendered more acute by the lack of  transportation. Horses, mules, wagons, and carriages were scarce, the  country roads were nearly impassable, and bridges were in bad repair or  had been burned or washed away. Steamboats had almost disappeared from  the rivers. Those which had escaped capture as blockade runners had been  subsequently destroyed or were worn out.. Postal facilities, which had  been poor enough during the last year of the Confederacy, were entirely  lacking for several months after the surrender.    The railways were in a state of physical dilapidation little removed  from destruction, save for those that had been captured and kept in  partial repair by the Federal troops. The rolling stock had been lost  by capture, by destruction to prevent capture, in wrecks, which were  frequent, or had been worn out. The railroad companies possessed large  sums in Confederate currency and in securities which were now valueless.  About two-thirds of all the lines were hopelessly bankrupt. Fortunately,  the United States War Department took over the control of the railway  lines and in some cases effected a temporary reorganization which could  not have been accomplished by the bankrupt companies. During the summer  and fall of 1865, \"loyal\" boards of directors were appointed for most  of the railroads, and the army withdrew its control. But repairs  and reconstruction were accomplished with difficulty because of the  demoralization of labor and the lack of funds or credit. Freight was  scarce and, had it not been for government shipments, some of the  railroads would have been abandoned. Not many people were able to  travel. It is recorded that on one trip from Montgomery to Mobile  and return, a distance of 360 miles, the railroad which is now the  Louisville and Nashville collected only thirteen dollars in fares.    Had there been unrestricted commercial freedom in the South in 1865-66,  the distress of the people would have been somewhat lessened, for here  and there were to be found public and private stores of cotton, tobacco,  rice, and other farm products, all of which were bringing high prices  in the market. But for several months the operation of wartime laws  and regulations hindered the distribution of even these scanty stores.  Property upon which the Confederate Government had a claim was, of  course, subject to Confiscation, and private property offered for sale,  even that of Unionists, was subject to a 25 percent tax on sales, a  shipping tax, and a revenue tax. The revenue tax on cotton, ranging from  two to three cents a pound during the three years after the war, brought  in over $68,000,000. This tax, with other Federal revenues, yielded much  more than the entire expenses of reconstruction from 1865 to 1868 and  of all relief measures for the South, both public and private. After  May 1865, the 25 percent tax was imposed only upon the produce of slave  labor. None of the war taxes, except that on cotton, was levied upon the  crops of 1866, but while these taxes lasted, they seriously impeded the  resumption of trade.    Even these restrictions, however, might have been borne if only they  had been honestly applied. Unfortunately, some of the most spectacular  frauds ever perpetrated were carried through in connection with the  attempt of the United States Treasury Department to collect and sell the  confiscable property in the South. The property to be sold consisted  of what had been captured and seized by the army and the navy, of  \"abandoned\" property, as such was called"]]]
