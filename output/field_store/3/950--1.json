PREFACE TO NEW IMPRESSION.      When this book first appeared (1886), the philological school of  interpretation of religion and myth, being then still powerful in  England, was criticised and opposed by the author. In Science, as on the  Turkish throne of old, \"Amurath to Amurath succeeds\"; the philological  theories of religion and myth have now yielded to anthropological  methods. The centre of the anthropological position was the \"ghost  theory\" of Mr. Herbert Spencer, the \"Animistic\" theory of Mr. E. R.  Tylor, according to whom the propitiation of ancestral and other spirits  leads to polytheism, and thence to monotheism. In the second edition  (1901) of this work the author argued that the belief in a \"relatively  supreme being,\" anthropomorphic was as old as, and might be even older,  than animistic religion. This theory he exhibited at greater length, and  with a larger collection of evidence, in his Making of Religion.    Since 1901, a great deal of fresh testimony as to what Mr. Howitt  styles the \"All Father\" in savage and barbaric religions has accrued. As  regards this being in Africa, the reader may consult the volumes of the  New Series of the Journal of the Anthropological Institute, which are  full of African evidence, not, as yet, discussed, to my knowledge, by  any writer on the History of Religion. As late as Man, for July, 1906,  No. 66, Mr. Parkinson published interesting Yoruba legends about Oleron,  the maker and father of men, and Oro, the Master of the Bull Roarer.    From Australia, we have Mr. Howitt's account of the All Father in his  Native Tribes of South-East Australia, with the account of the All  Father of the Central Australian tribe, the Kaitish, in North Central  Tribes of Australia, by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen (1904), also The  Euahlayi Tribe, by Mrs. Langley Parker (1906). These masterly books are  indispensable to all students of the subject, while, in Messrs. Spencer  and Gillen's work cited, and in their earlier Native Tribes of Central  Australia, we are introduced to savages who offer an elaborate animistic  theory, and are said to show no traces of the All Father belief.    The books of Messrs. Spencer and Gillen also present much evidence as  to a previously unknown form of totemism, in which the totem is not  hereditary, and does not regulate marriage. This prevails among the  Arunta \"nation,\" and the Kaitish tribe. In the opinion of Mr. Spencer  (Report Australian Association for Advancement of Science, 1904) and  of Mr. J. G. Frazer (Fortnightly Review, September, 1905), this is  the earliest surviving form of totemism, and Mr. Frazer suggests an  animistic origin for the institution. I have criticised these views in  The Secret of the Totem (1905), and proposed a different solution of the  problem. (See also \"Primitive and Advanced Totemism\" in Journal of the  Anthropological Institute, July, 1906.) In the works mentioned will be  found references to other sources of information as to these questions,  which are still sub judice.

Like \"Roderick\"  and like \"The American,\" it had been designed for publication in \"The  Atlantic Monthly,\" where it began to appear in 1880. It differed from  its two predecessors, however, in finding a course also open to it, from  month to month, in \"Macmillan's Magazine\"; which was to be for me one of  the last occasions of simultaneous \"serialisation\" in the two countries  that the changing conditions of literary intercourse between England and  the United States had up to then left unaltered. It is a long novel, and  I was long in writing it; I remember being again much occupied with it,  the following year, during a stay of several weeks made in Venice. I had  rooms on Riva Schiavoni, at the top of a house near the passage leading  off to San Zaccaria; the waterside life, the wondrous lagoon spread  before me, and the ceaseless human chatter of Venice came in at my  windows, to which I seem to myself to have been constantly driven, in  the fruitless fidget of composition, as if to see whether, out in the  blue channel, the ship of some right suggestion, of some better phrase,  of the next happy twist of my subject, the next true touch for my  canvas, mightn't come into sight. But I recall vividly enough that the  response most elicited, in general, to these restless appeals was the  rather grim admonition that romantic and historic sites, such as  the land of Italy abounds in, offer the artist a questionable aid to  concentration when they themselves are not to be the subject of it. They  are too rich in their own life and too charged with their own meanings  merely to help him out with a lame phrase; they draw him away from his  small question to their own greater ones; so that, after a little, he  feels, while thus yearning toward them in his difficulty, as if he were  asking an army of glorious veterans to help him to arrest a peddler who  has given him the wrong change.    There are pages of the book which, in the reading over, have seemed  to make me see again the bristling curve of the wide Riva, the large  colour-spots of the balconied houses and the repeated undulation of the  little hunchbacked bridges, marked by the rise and drop again, with the  wave, of foreshortened clicking pedestrians. The Venetian footfall and  the Venetian cry--all talk there, wherever uttered, having the pitch of  a call across the water--come in once more at the window, renewing one's  old impression of the delighted senses and the divided, frustrated mind.  How can places that speak IN GENERAL so to the imagination not give  it, at the moment, the particular thing it wants? I recollect again  and again, in beautiful places, dropping into that wonderment. The  real truth is, I think, that they express, under this appeal, only too  much--more than, in the given case, one has use for; so that one  finds one's self working less congruously, after all, so far as the  surrounding picture is concerned, than in presence of the moderate and  the neutral, to which we may lend something of the light of our vision.  Such a place as Venice is too proud for such charities; Venice doesn't  borrow, she but all magnificently gives. We profit by that enormously,  but to do so we must either be quite off duty or be on it in her service  alone. Such, and so rueful, are these reminiscences; though on the  whole, no doubt, one's book, and one's \"literary effort\" at large, were  to be the better for them. Strangely fertilising, in the long run, does  a wasted effort of attention often prove. It all depends on HOW the  attention has been cheated, has been squandered. There are high-handed  insolent frauds, and there are insidious sneaking ones. And there is,  I fear, even on the most designing artist's part, always witless enough  good faith, always anxious enough desire, to fail to guard him against  their deceits.    Trying to recover here, for recognition, the germ of my idea, I see that  it must have consisted not at all in any conceit of a \"plot,\" nefarious  name, in any flash, upon the fancy, of a set of relations, or in any one  of those situations that, by a logic of their own, immediately fall, for  the fabulist, into movement, into a march or a rush, a patter of quick  steps; but altogether in the sense of a single character, the character  and aspect of a particular engaging young woman, to which all the usual  elements of a \"subject,\" certainly of a setting, were to need to be  super added. Quite as interesting as the young woman herself at her  best, do I find, I must again repeat, this projection of memory upon the  whole matter of the growth, in one's imagination, of some such apology  for a motive. These are the fascinations of the fabulist's art, these  lurking forces of expansion, these necessities of upspringing in  the seed, these beautiful determinations, on the part of the idea  entertained, to grow as tall as possible, to push into the light and  the air and thickly flower there; and, quite as much, these fine  possibilities of recovering, from some good standpoint on the ground  gained, the intimate history of the business--of retracing and  reconstructing its steps and stages. I have always fondly remembered a  remark that I heard fall years ago from the lips of Ivan Turgenieff in  regard to his own experience of the usual origin of the fictive picture.  It began for him almost always with the vision of some person or  persons, who hovered before him, soliciting him, as the active or  passive figure, interesting him and appealing to him just as they were  and by what they were. He saw them, in that fashion, as disponibles,  saw them subject to the chances, the complications of existence, and saw  them vividly, but then had to find for them the right relations, those  that would most bring them out; to imagine, to invent and select and  piece together the situations most useful and favourable to the sense of  the creatures themselves, the complications they would be most likely to  produce and to feel.    \"To arrive at these things is to arrive at my story,\" he said, \"and  that's the way I look for it. The result is that I'm often accused  of not having 'story' enough. I seem to myself to have as much as I  need--to show my people, to exhibit their relations with each other;  for that is all my measure. If I watch them long enough I see them come  together, I see them PLACED, I see them engaged in this or that act and  in this or that difficulty. How they look and move and speak and behave,  always in the setting I have found for them, is my account of them--of  which I dare say, alas, que cela manque souvent d'architecture. But I  would rather, I think, have too little architecture than too much--when  there's danger of its interfering with my measure of the truth. The  French of course like more of it than I give--having by their own genius  such a hand for it; and indeed one must give all one can. As for the  origin of one's wind-blown germs themselves, who shall say, as you ask,  where THEY come from? We have to go too far back, too far behind,  to say. Isn't it all we can say that they come from every quarter  of heaven, that they are THERE at almost any turn of the road? They  accumulate, and we are always picking them over, selecting among them.  They are the breath of life--by which I mean that life, in its own  way, breathes them upon us. They are so, in a manner prescribed and  imposed--floated into our minds by the current of life. That reduces to  imbecility the vain critic's quarrel, so often, with one's subject, when  he hasn't the wit to accept it. Will he point out then which other it  should properly have been?--his office being, essentially to point out.  Il en serait bien embarrasse. Ah, when he points out what I've done or  failed to do with it, that's another matter: there he's on his ground. I  give him up my 'sarchitecture,'\" my distinguished friend concluded, \"as  much as he will.\"    So this beautiful genius, and I recall with comfort the gratitude I drew  from his reference to the intensity of suggestion that may reside in the  stray figure, the unattached character, the image en disponibilite.  It gave me higher warrant than I seemed then to have met for just  that blest habit of one's own imagination, the trick of investing some  conceived or encountered individual, some brace or group of individuals,  with the germinal property and authority. I was myself so much more  antecedently conscious of my figures than of their setting--a too  preliminary, a preferential interest in which struck me as in general  such a putting of the cart before the horse. I might envy, though I  couldn't emulate, the imaginative writer so constituted as to see his  fable first and to make out its agents afterwards. I could think so  little of any fable that didn't need its agents positively to launch  it; I could think so little of any situation that didn't depend for its  interest on the nature of the persons situated, and thereby on their  way of taking it. There are methods of so-called presentation, I believe  among novelists who have appeared to flourish--that offer the situation  as indifferent to that support; but I have not lost the sense of the  value for me, at the time, of the admirable Russian's testimony to my  not needing, all superstitiously, to try and perform any such gymnastic.  Other echoes from the same source linger with me, I confess, as  unfadingly--if it be not all indeed one much-embracing echo. It was  impossible after that not to read, for one's uses, high lucidity into  the tormented and disfigured and bemuddled question of the objective  value, and even quite into that of the critical appreciation, of  \"subject\" in the novel.    One had had from an early time, for that matter, the"]]]
