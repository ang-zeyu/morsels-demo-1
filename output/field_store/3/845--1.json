The following notes on text format  apply to all texts and will not be repeated in full.    _Italics and other text markings:_    Italicized letters within words, representing expanded abbreviations,  are shown in the e-text with braces (\"curly brackets\"): co{n}nyng{e}.  Readers who find this added information distracting may globally delete  all braces; they are not used for any other purpose. Whole-word italics  are shown in the usual way with _lines_. Superscripts are shown with ^,  and boldface or blackletter type with +marks+.    _Page Layout:_    In the original book, each text page contained several types of  secondary material printed in all four margins. The HTML version of  this e-text offers a closer approximation of the original appearance.    _Headnotes_ appeared at the top of alternate pages, like subsidiary  chapter headings. In longer selections they have been retained and  moved to the beginning of the most appropriate paragraph; some are  also grouped at the beginning of a selection to act as a detailed  table of contents.    _Footnotes_ were numbered separately for each page. In this e-text,  general footnotes are numbered sequentially and grouped at the end of  the selection. In some selections, text notes (glosses or variant  readings) are marked with capital letters [A] and are kept in small  groups near each passage. Footnotes in the form [[10a]] are additional  notes from the editor's Corrigenda. Footnotes with symbols [10*] are  _footnotes to footnotes_.    _Sidenotes_ were generally added by the editor to give translations  or summaries. In this e-text, they are always collected into full  sentences. In some verse selections, sidenotes appear immediately  _before_ their original location, with no further marking. In other  selections-- including all prose passages-- sidenotes are collected  into longer paragraphs and placed _after_ the text they refer to. These  will be identified either by line number or by lower-case letters [a]  showing their original location.    Sidenotes in the form [Fol. 10b] or [Page 27] are shown inline, within  the body text. Numbered notes printed in the side margin were generally  treated as footnotes or text notes.]             *       *       *       *       *             *       *       *       *         *       *       *       *       *        Early English Text Society.

The Early English Text Society was started by Dr. Furnivall in 1864 for  the purpose of bringing the mass of Old English Literature within the  reach of the ordinary student, and of wiping away the reproach under  which England had long rested, of having felt little interest in the  monuments of her early language and life.    On the starting of the Society, so many Texts of importance were at once  taken in hand by its Editors, that it became necessary in 1867 to open,  besides the _Original Series_ with which the Society began, an _Extra  Series_ which should be mainly devoted to fresh editions of all that is  most valuable in printed MSS. and Caxton's and other black-letter books,  though first editions of MSS. will not be excluded when the convenience  of issuing them demands their inclusion in the Extra Series.    During the thirty-nine years of the Society's existence, it has  produced, with whatever shortcomings, an amount of good solid work for  which all students of our Language, and some of our Literature, must be  grateful, and which has rendered possible the beginnings (at least) of  proper Histories and Dictionaries of that Language and Literature, and  has illustrated the thoughts, the life, the manners and customs of our  forefathers and foremothers.    But the Society's experience has shown the very small number of those  inheritors of the speech of Cynewulf, Chaucer, and Shakspere, who care  two guineas a year for the records of that speech: 'Let the dead past  bury its dead' is still the cry of Great Britain and her Colonies, and  of America, in the matter of language. The Society has never had money  enough to produce the Texts that could easily have been got ready for  it; and many Editors are now anxious to send to press the work they have  prepared. The necessity has therefore arisen for trying to increase the  number of the Society's members, and to induce its well-wishers to help  it by gifts of money, either in one sum or by instalments. The Committee  trust that every Member will bring before his or her friends and  acquaintances the Society's claims for liberal support. Until all Early  English MSS. are printed, no proper History of our Language or Social  Life is possible.    The Subscription to the Society, which constitutes membership, is £1 1s.  a year for the ORIGINAL SERIES, and £1 1s. for the EXTRA SERIES, due in  advance on the 1st of JANUARY, and should be paid by Cheque, Postal  Order, or Money-Order, crost 'Union Bank of London,' to the Hon.  Secretary, W. A. DALZIEL, Esq., 67, Victoria Rd., Finsbury Park,  London, N. Members who want their Texts posted to them, must add to  their prepaid Subscriptions 1s. for the Original Series, and 1s. for the  Extra Series, yearly. The Society's Texts are also sold separately at  the prices put after them in the Lists; but Members can get back-Texts  at one-third less than the List-prices by sending the cash for them in  advance to the Hon. Secretary.      -> The Society intends to complete, as soon as its funds will allow, the  Reprints of its out-of-print Texts of the year 1866, and also of nos.  20, 26 and 33. Prof. Skeat has finisht _Partenay_; Dr. McKnight of Ohio  _King Horn_ and _Floris and Blancheflour_; and Dr. Furnivall his  _Political, Religious and Love Poems_ and _Myrc's Duties of a Parish  Priest_. Dr. Otto Glauning has undertaken _Seinte Marherete_; and Dr.  Furnivall has _Hali Meidenhad_ in type. As the cost of these Reprints,  if they were not needed, would have been devoted to fresh Texts, the  Reprints will be sent to all Members in lieu of such Texts. Though  called 'Reprints,' these books are new editions, generally with valuable  additions, a fact not noticed by a few careless receivers of them, who  have complained that they already had the volumes. As the Society's  copies of the _Facsimile of the Epinal MS._ issued as an Extra Volume  in 1883 are exhausted, Mr. J. H. Hessels, M.A., of St. John's Coll.,  Cambridge, has kindly undertaken an edition of the MS. for the Society.

Men found it and  went there to live more than a thousand years ago. During the warm  season they used to fish and make fish-oil and hunt sea-birds and gather  feathers and tend their sheep and make hay. But the winters were long  and dark and cold. Men and women and children stayed in the house and  carded and spun and wove and knit. A whole family sat for hours around  the fire in the middle of the room. That fire gave the only light.  Shadows flitted in the dark corners. Smoke curled along the high beams  in the ceiling. The children sat on the dirt floor close by the fire.  The grown people were on a long narrow bench that they had pulled up to  the light and warmth. Everybody's hands were busy with wool. The work  left their minds free to think and their lips to talk. What was there to  talk about? The summer's fishing, the killing of a fox, a voyage to  Norway. But the people grew tired of this little gossip. Fathers looked  at their children and thought:    \"They are not learning much. What will make them brave and wise? What  will teach them to love their country and old Norway? Will not the  stories of battles, of brave deeds, of mighty men, do this?\"    So, as the family worked in the red fire-light, the father told of the  kings of Norway, of long voyages to strange lands, of good fights. And  in farmhouses all through Iceland these old tales were told over and  over until everybody knew them and loved them. Some men could sing and  play the harp. This made the stories all the more interesting. People  called such men \"skalds,\" and they called their songs \"sagas.\"    Every midsummer there was a great meeting. Men from all over Iceland  came to it and made laws. During the day there were rest times, when no  business was going on. Then some skald would take his harp and walk to a  large stone or a knoll and stand on it and begin a song of some brave  deed of an old Norse hero. At the first sound of the harp and the  voice, men came running from all directions, crying out:    \"The skald! The skald! A saga!\"    They stood about for hours and listened. They shouted applause. When the  skald was tired, some other man would come up from the crowd and sing or  tell a story. As the skald stepped down from his high position, some  rich man would rush up to him and say:    \"Come and spend next winter at my house. Our ears are thirsty for song.\"    So the best skalds traveled much and visited many people. Their songs  made them welcome everywhere. They were always honored with good seats  at a feast. They were given many rich gifts. Even the King of Norway  would sometimes send across the water to Iceland, saying to some famous  skald:    \"Come and visit me. You shall not go away empty-handed. Men say that the  sweetest songs are in Iceland. I wish to hear them.\"    These tales were not written. Few men wrote or read in those days.  Skalds learned songs from hearing them sung. At last people began to  write more easily. Then they said:    \"These stories are very precious. We must write them down to save them  from being forgotten.\"    After that many men in Iceland spent their winters in writing books.  They wrote on sheepskin; vellum, we call it. Many of these old vellum  books have been saved for hundreds of years, and are now in museums in  Norway. Some leaves are lost, some are torn, all are yellow and  crumpled. But they are precious. They tell us all that we know about  that olden time. There are the very words that the men of Iceland wrote  so long ago--stories of kings and of battles and of ship-sailing. Some  of those old stories I have told in this book.          _PART I_    [Illustration]    _IN_ NORWAY      [Decoration]          [Illustration]    The Baby      King Halfdan lived in Norway long ago. One morning his queen said to  him:    \"I had a strange dream last night. I thought that I stood in the grass  before my bower.[1] I pulled a thorn from my dress. As I held it in my  fingers, it grew into a tall tree. The trunk was thick and red as blood,  but the lower limbs were fair and green, and the highest ones were  white. I thought that the branches of this great tree spread so far that  they covered all Norway and even more.\"    \"A strange dream,\" said King Halfdan. \"Dreams are the messengers of the  gods. I wonder what they would tell us,\" and he stroked his beard in  thought.    Some time after that a serving-woman came into the feast hall where King  Halfdan was. She carried a little white bundle in her arms.    \"My lord,\" she said, \"a little son is just born to you.\"    \"Ha!\" cried the king, and he jumped up from the high seat and hastened  forward until he stood before the woman.    \"Show him to me!\" he shouted, and there was joy in his voice.    The serving-woman put down her bundle on the ground and turned back the  cloth. There was a little naked baby. The king looked at it carefully.    \"It is a goodly youngster,\" he said, and smiled. \"Bring Ivar and  Thorstein.\"[2]    They were captains of the king's soldiers. Soon they came.    \"Stand as witnesses,\" Halfdan said.    Then he lifted the baby in his arms, while the old serving-woman brought  a silver bowl of water. The king dipped his hand into it and sprinkled  the baby, saying:    \"I own this baby for my son. He shall be called Harald. My naming gift  to him is ten pounds of gold.\"    Then the woman carried the baby back to the queen's room.    [Illustration: \"_I own this baby for my son. He shall be called  Harald_\"]    \"My lord owns him for his son,\" she said. \"And no wonder! He is perfect  in every limb.\"    The queen looked at him and smiled and remembered her dream and thought:    \"That great tree! Can it be this little baby of mine?\"    [Decoration]      FOOTNOTES:    [1] See note about house on page 194.    [2] See note about names on page 194.
