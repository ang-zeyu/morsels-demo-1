CHAPTER ONE.    THE SETTLER'S EARLY DAYS.    From my earliest days to the present time I have been gradually climbing  up the ladder towards a comfortable berth on the top; and if a ratlin  has given way beneath my feet, I always have had a firm hold above my  head.  The first step I took was off the mud on to dry ground.  I can  recollect nothing clearly before that time.  I was born on board a river  barge, and never left it, winter nor summer, till I was fully six years  old.  One day the barge took the mud, which is not surprising,  considering that I was the only person on deck.  I ran to the helm to  turn her head off the shore, but it was too late--there she stuck hard  and fast.  My mother was below, tending my father, and he lay dying.  It  was the barge's last voyage, and his too.  Both had seen much service.  The barge never moved again, but went on rotting and rotting till the  owner sold her and she was broken up.    Father died that night, and a boat came and took mother and me on shore,  with father's body, and such property as we possessed--not much, I  fancy,--a kettle and pot, some plates, and knives, and cups, and a few  clothes,--we hadn't wanted furniture, and with these mother and I had to  begin the world.  She said things might have been worse, for she might  have had a dozen children instead of one, and debts to pay--and she  didn't owe a farthing, which was a great comfort in her affliction.    My mother was indeed, while she lived, a very good mother to me, for she  taught me to distinguish right from wrong, to love the former and to  hate the latter.  As may be supposed, she was very poor, and I was often  without a meal.  I know, too, that she frequently stinted herself to  give me food.  She lived on the banks of the Thames somewhere below  London, and I very soon found my way down to the mud, where I now and  then used to pick up odds and ends, bits of iron and copper, and  sometimes even coin, and chips of wood.  The first my mother used to  sell, and I often got enough in the week to buy us a hearty meal; the  last served to boil our kettle when we had any food to cook in it.  Few  rich people know how the poor live; our way was a strange one.  My poor  mother used to work with her needle, and go out as a charwoman, and to  wash, when she could get any one to wash for, but that was seldom; and  toil as hard as she might, a difficult matter she had to pay the rent of  the little room in which we lived.  She felt sorely the struggle she had  to endure with poverty, for she had seen better days--far better, I  suspect,--and was not accustomed to it.  She was, I have reason to  believe, well educated--at all events, much above most persons in the  station in life she then occupied; and, young as I was, she taught me to  read, and to repeat poetry, and to sing psalms; and though I forget  nearly all the events of my life at that time, I remember many of the  verses she taught me; they have been a wonderful comfort to me through  life.  My mother had married unwisely, I have no doubt, and if she ever  had any relations, they discarded her; so she was very soon reduced to  the condition I have described, aided by an illness which at length  terminated in her death.    I was about eight years old when I became an orphan; but my intellects  were sharpened by exercise, and I was as precocious as many children  double my age.  As I was able to do something to gain my own livelihood,  the people of the house where we lodged took compassion on me, and,  instead of sending me to the workhouse, gave me the corner of a garret  to sleep in.  I understood the compact, and worked harder than ever.    Young as I was I felt my mother's loss most bitterly.  We had been all  in all to each other, and I should have broken down altogether with  grief, had not my kind host roused me up and advised me to go out and  try and do something to gain my livelihood.  Hunger is a severe  taskmaster; it makes many an idle man work.    I now became a regular mudlark, though I got employment when I could by  running on errands and in assisting the boatmen on the river.  I was one  summer's day, with a number of other boys, wading up to my knees in the  water, when a boat with several gentlemen on a pleasure excursion came  down the river, and pulled into the shore near where we were.  Some of  the gentlemen landed, while the others who remained in the boat amused  themselves by throwing halfpence into the water for us to dive after.  They scattered them about in every direction, so that many coins were  altogether lost; for as the boys rushed after them they drove them into  the mud.    At last, as I was standing some way from the other boys, a gentleman  threw a penny towards me; but it passed over my head and fell into deep  water, and directly afterwards I heard him exclaim--    \"Dear me!  I've lost my ring--my diamond ring, too.  I would not have  lost it for a hundred pounds.\"    As he had been throwing pence in various directions, he had no notion  where it had fallen, though he naturally concluded that it had come off  at one of those times.  As I saw that he was very much annoyed at his  loss I felt sorry for him; so I went up to him, and told him that I  would hunt about for his ring, and that if I found it I would gladly  bring it to him, provided he would tell me where he lived.    \"But don't you bargain for a reward?\" asked one of his companions.    \"That depends upon how far off the gentleman lives,\" I replied.  \"If  near at hand this errand may be only worth a sixpence; but if far off,  perhaps he won't think a shilling too much to give me.\"    \"I'll tell you what, my man; I'll gladly give you ten shillings if you  find it; but I fear there is little chance of your so doing,\" replied  the gentleman, smiling.    \"There's nothing like trying, sir,\" I replied; \"and if you'll tell me  your name and where you live, if I pick it up you shall have it again.\"    \"Well, then, you must inquire for Mr Wells, -- Street, -- Square,  London,\" said the gentleman.    \"If you write it down I shall have less chance of forgetting it,\" I  replied.    \"That would be little use to you, my man,\" he observed; \"you cannot  read, I should suppose.\"    \"But I can, though,\" I replied.  \"Give me your card, and you will see I  speak the truth.\"    On this one of the gentlemen drew out a card from his pocket, and wrote  some words on it with a pencil, while I washed my hands and dried them  in my shirt-sleeves.  He then handed me the card.  I looked at it and  saw that it was in a language I could not understand.    \"Those are Latin words, and I did not say I could read any language,\" I  observed, handing him back his card.    \"You are right, my boy,\" said the gentleman who had lost his ring; \"but  here are some lines in English: let us hear if you can read them.\"    I looked at the lines attentively: they were at the commencement of a  poem my mother had taught me; so I not only read them off fluently, but,  to the great surprise of all present, went on repeating the succeeding  ones.    \"Bravo! bravo!\" exclaimed the gentlemen, highly delighted.  \"You're a  genius, my lad--a perfect marvel.  A mudlark spout poetry!  Truly the  schoolmaster is abroad.\"    \"Who taught you your learning, my boy?\" asked another.    \"My mother, sir,\" I replied, calmly, and rather surprised at their  expressions, for I saw nothing wonderful in my performance.    \"I should like to see this mother of yours; she must be out of the  common way too,\" observed the same person.    \"Mother is dead, sir,\" I answered, crying; for the very mention of her  name wrung my young heart with grief.    \"There is something more here than meets the eye,\" said Mr Wells.  \"My  poor boy, don't cry.  Come to-morrow to my house, whether you find my  ring or not.  In the meantime here is half a crown; your poetry deserves  it.\"    I took the money almost mechanically; for I was thinking of my mother,  and was scarcely aware of the amount of wealth I was receiving.    On seeing Mr Wells give me money, the other gentlemen did the same, and  some even gave me as much as five shillings; so that I felt as if coin  was raining down on me from the skies.  My tears dried up, and, for a  minute, I felt supremely happy; but on a sudden the thought occurred to  me, that if my mother had been alive how happy it would have made her,  and I burst forth into tears again.    Mr Wells on this asked me why I cried;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23058"],[0,"The Queen Of Spades (#1)"],[1,"QUEEN OF SPADES    By Alexander Sergeievitch Poushkin    Translated by H. Twitchell    Copyright, 1901, by The Current Literature Publishing Company      AT the house of Naroumov, a cavalry officer, the long winter night had  been passed in gambling. At five in the morning breakfast was served  to the weary players. The winners ate with relish; the losers, on the  contrary, pushed back their plates and sat brooding gloomily. Under  the influence of the good wine, however, the conversation then became  general.    \"Well, Sourine?\" said the host inquiringly.    \"Oh, I lost as usual. My luck is abominable. No matter how cool I keep,  I never win.\"    \"How is it, Herman, that you never touch a card?\" remarked one of the  men, addressing a young officer of the Engineering Corps. \"Here you are  with the rest of us at five o'clock in the morning, and you have neither  played nor bet all night.\"    \"Play interests me greatly,\" replied the person addressed, \"but I hardly  care to sacrifice the necessaries of life for uncertain superfluities.\"    \"Herman is a German, therefore economical; that explains it,\" said  Tomsky. \"But the person I can't quite understand is my grandmother, the  Countess Anna Fedorovna.\"    \"Why?\" inquired a chorus of voices.    \"I can't understand why my grandmother never gambles.\"    \"I don't see anything very striking in the fact that a woman of eighty  refuses to gamble,\" objected Naroumov.    \"Have you never heard her story?\"    \"No--\"    \"Well, then, listen to it. To begin with, sixty years ago my grandmother  went to Paris, where she was all the fashion. People crowded each other  in the streets to get a chance to see the 'Muscovite Venus,' as she was  called. All the great ladies played faro, then. On one occasion, while  playing with the Duke of Orleans, she lost an enormous sum. She told her  husband of the debt, but he refused outright to pay it. Nothing could  induce him to change his mind on the subject, and grandmother was at  her wits' ends. Finally, she remembered a friend of hers, Count  Saint-Germain. You must have heard of him, as many wonderful stories  have been told about him. He is said to have discovered the elixir of  life, the philosopher's stone, and many other equally marvelous things.  He had money at his disposal, and my grandmother knew it. She sent him a  note asking him to come to see her. He obeyed her summons and found her  in great distress. She painted the cruelty of her husband in the darkest  colors, and ended by telling the Count that she depended upon his  friendship and generosity.    \"'I could lend you the money,' replied the Count, after a moment of  thoughtfulness, 'but I know that you would not enjoy a moment's rest  until you had returned it; it would only add to your embarrassment.  There is another way of freeing yourself.'    \"'But I have no money at all,' insisted my grandmother.    \"'There is no need of money. Listen to me.'    \"The Count then told her a secret which any of us would give a good deal  to know.\"    The young gamesters were all attention. Tomsky lit his pipe, took a few  whiffs, then continued:    \"The next evening, grandmother appeared at Versailles at the Queen's  gaming-table. The Duke of Orleans was the dealer. Grandmother made some  excuse for not having brought any money, and began to punt. She chose  three cards in succession, again and again, winning every time, and was  soon out of debt.\"    \"A fable,\" remarked Herman; \"perhaps the cards were marked.\"    \"I hardly think so,\" replied Tomsky, with an air of importance.    \"So you have a grandmother who knows three winning cards, and you  haven't found out the magic secret.\"    \"I must say I have not. She had four sons, one of them being my father,  all of whom are devoted to play; she never told the secret to one of  them. But my uncle told me this much, on his word of honor. Tchaplitzky,  who died in poverty after having squandered millions, lost at one time,  at play, nearly three hundred thousand rubles. He was desperate and  grandmother took pity on him. She told him the three cards, making him  swear never to use them again. He returned to the game, staked fifty  thousand rubles on each card, and came out ahead, after paying his  debts.\"    As day was dawning the party now broke up, each one draining his glass  and taking his leave.    The Countess Anna Fedorovna was seated before her mirror in her  dressing-room. Three women were assisting at her toilet. The old  Countess no longer made the slightest pretensions to beauty, but she  still clung to all the habits of her youth, and spent as much time at  her toilet as she had done sixty years before. At the window a young  girl, her ward, sat at her needlework.    \"Good afternoon, grandmother,\" cried a young officer, who had just  entered the room. \"I have come to ask a favor of you.\"    \"What, Pavel?\"    \"I want to be allowed to present one of my friends to you, and to take  you to the ball on Tuesday night.\"    \"Take me to the ball and present him to me there.\"    After a few more remarks the officer walked up to the window where  Lisaveta Ivanovna sat.    \"Whom do you wish to present?\" asked the girl.    \"Naroumov; do you know him?\"    \"No; is he a soldier?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"An engineer?\"    \"No; why do you ask?\"    The girl smiled and made no reply.    Pavel Tomsky took his leave, and, left to herself, Lisaveta glanced  out of the window. Soon, a young officer appeared at the corner of the  street; the girl blushed and bent her head low over her canvas.    This appearance of the officer had become a daily occurrence. The man  was totally unknown to her, and as she was not accustomed to coquetting  with the soldiers she saw on the street, she hardly knew how to explain  his presence. His persistence finally roused an interest entirely  strange to her. One day, she even ventured to smile upon her admirer,  for such he seemed to be.    The reader need hardly be told that the officer was no other than  Herman, the would-be gambler, whose imagination had been strongly  excited by the story told by Tomsky of the three magic cards.    \"Ah,\" he thought, \"if the old Countess would only reveal the secret to  me. Why not try to win her good-will and appeal to her sympathy?\"    With this idea in mind, he took up his daily station before the house,  watching the pretty face at the window, and trusting to fate to bring  about the desired acquaintance.    One day, as Lisaveta was standing on the pavement about to enter the  carriage after the Countess, she felt herself jostled and a note was  thrust into her hand. Turning, she saw the young officer at her elbow.  As quick as thought, she put the note in her glove and entered the  carriage. On her return from the drive, she hastened to her chamber to  read the missive, in a state of excitement mingled with fear. It was  a tender and respectful declaration of affection, copied word for word  from a German novel. Of this fact, Lisa was, of course, ignorant.    The young girl was much impressed by the missive, but she felt that  the writer must not be encouraged. She therefore wrote a few lines of  explanation and, at the first opportunity, dropped it, with the letter,  out of the window. The officer hastily crossed the street, picked up the  papers and entered a shop to read them.    In no wise daunted by this rebuff, he found the opportunity to send  her another note in a few days. He received no reply, but, evidently  understanding the female heart, he presevered, begging for an interview.  He was rewarded at last by the following:    \"To-night we go to the ambassador's ball. We shall remain until two  o'clock. I can arrange for a meeting in this way. After our departure,  the servants will probably all go out, or go to sleep. At half-past  eleven enter the vestibule boldly, and if you see any one, inquire for  the Countess; if not, ascend the stairs, turn to the left and go on  until you come to a door, which opens into her bedchamber. Enter  this room and behind a screen you will find another door leading to a  corridor; from this a spiral staircase leads to my sitting-room. I shall  expect to find you there on my return.\"    Herman trembled like a leaf as the appointed hour drew near. He obeyed  instructions fully, and, as he met no one, he reached the old lady's  bedchamber without difficulty. Instead of going out of the small door  behind the screen, however, he concealed himself in a closet to await  the return of the old Countess.    The hours dragged slowly by; at last he heard the sound of wheels.  Immediately lamps were lighted and servants began moving about. Finally  the old woman tottered into the room, completely exhausted. Her women  removed her wraps and proceeded to get her in readiness for the night.  Herman watched the proceedings with a curiosity not unmingled with  superstitious fear. When at last she was attired in cap and gown, the  old woman looked less uncanny than when she wore her ball-dress of blue  brocade.    She sat down in an easy chair beside a table, as she was in the habit  of doing before retiring, and her women withdrew. As the old lady sat  swaying to and fro, seemingly oblivious to her surroundings, Herman  crept out of his hiding-place.    At the slight noise the old woman opened her eyes, and gazed at the  intruder with a half-dazed expression.    \"Have no fear, I beg of you,\" said Herman, in a calm voice. \"I have not  come to harm you, but to ask a favor of you instead.\"    The Countess looked at him in silence, seemingly without comprehending  him. Herman thought she might be deaf, so he put his lips close to her  ear and repeated his remark. The listener remained perfectly mute.    \"You could make my fortune without its costing you anything,\" pleaded  the young man; \"only tell me the three cards which are sure to win,  and--\"    Herman paused as the old woman opened her lips as if about to speak.    \"It was only a jest; I swear to you, it "]]]
