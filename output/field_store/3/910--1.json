Carding is thus the       important first step. For processing short-length wool fibers its       mechanization proved most difficult to achieve._         _To the United States in 1793 came John and Arthur Scholfield,       bringing with them the knowledge of how to build a successful       wool-carding machine. From this contribution to the technology of       our then infant country developed another new industry._         THE AUTHOR: _Grace L. Rogers is curator of textiles, Museum of       History and Technology, in the Smithsonian Institution's United       States National Museum._    Carding is the necessary preliminary step by which individual short  fibers of wool or cotton are separated and cleaned of foreign materials  so they can be spun into yarn. The thoroughness of the carding  determines the quality of the yarn, while the position in which the  carded fibers are laid determines its type. The fibers are laid parallel  in order to spin a smooth compact yarn, or they are crossed and  intermingled to produce a soft bulky yarn.      Primitive Carding    The earliest method of carding wool was probably one in which, by use of  the fingers alone, the tufts were pulled apart, the foreign particles  loosened and extracted, and the fibers blended. Fuller's teasels  (thistles with hooked points, _Dispasacus fullonum_), now better known  for raising the nap on woven woolens, were also used at a very early  date for carding. The teasels were mounted on a pair of small  rectangular frames with handles; and from this device developed the  familiar small hand card (see fig. 2), measuring about 8 inches by 5  inches, in which card clothing (wire teeth embedded in leather) was  mounted on a board with the wire teeth bent and angled toward the  handle. The wool was placed on one card and a second card was dragged  across it, the two hands pulling away from each other. This action  separated the fibers and laid them parallel to the handle, in a thin  film. After the fibers had been carded in this way several times, the  cards were turned so that the handles were together and once again they  were pulled across each other. With the wire teeth now angled in the  same direction, the action rolled the carded fibers into a sliver (a  loose roll of untwisted fibers) that was the length of the hand card and  about the diameter of the finger. This placed the wool fibers crosswise  in relation to the length of the sliver, their best position for  spinning.[1] Until the mid-18th century hand cards were the only type of  implement available for carding.    [Illustration: Figure 2.--HAND CARDS \"USED ON PLANTATION OF MARY C.  PURVIS,\" NELSON COUNTY, VIRGINIA, during early 1800's and now in U.S.  National Museum (_cat. no._ T2848; _Smithsonian photo_ 37258).]    [Illustration: Figure 3.--THE FIRST MACHINE IN LEWIS PAUL'S BRITISH  PATENT 636, ISSUED AUGUST 30, 1748. The treadle moved the card-covered  board _B1_, in a horizontal direction as necessary to perform the  carding operation. With the aid of the needlestick the fibers were  removed separately from each of the 16 cards _N_. The carded fibers were  placed on a narrow cloth band, which unrolled from the small cylinder  _G_, on the left, and was rolled up with the fibers on the cylinder _I_,  at the right.]      First Mechanical Cards    The earliest mechanical device for carding fibers was invented by Lewis  Paul in England in 1738 but not patented until August 30, 1748. The  patent described two machines. The first, and less important, machine  consisted of 16 narrow cards mounted on a board; a single card held in  the hand performed the actual carding operation (see fig. 3). The second  machine utilized a horizontal cylinder covered with parallel rows of  card clothing. Under the cylinder was a concave frame lined with similar  card clothing. As the cylinder was turned, the cards on it worked  against those on the concave frame, separating and straightening the  fibers (see fig. 4). After the fibers were carded, the concave section  was lowered and the fibers were stripped off by hand with a needle  stick, an implement resembling a comb with very fine needlelike metal  teeth. Though his machine was far from perfect. Lewis Paul had invented  the carding cylinder working with stationary cards and the stripping  comb.    [Illustration: Figure 4.--THE PATENT DESCRIPTION OF PAUL'S SECOND  MACHINE suggested that the fibers be carded by a cylinder action, but be  removed in the same manner as directed in the first patent.]    [Illustration: Figure 5.--ILLUSTRATIONS FROM BRITISH PATENT 628, ISSUED  JANUARY 20, 1748, to Daniel Bourn for a roller card machine.]    [Illustration: Figure 6.--THE MOST IMPORTANT SINGLE FEATURE Illustrated  in Richard Arkwright's British patent 1111 of December 16, 1775,  provided \"a crank and a frame of iron with teeth\" to remove the carded  fibers from the cylinder.]    Another important British patent was granted in 1748 to Daniel Bourn,  who invented a machine with four carding rollers set close together, the  first of the roller-card type (see fig. 5). To produce a practical  carding machine, however, several additional mechanical improvements  were necessary. The first of these did not appear until more than two  decades later, in 1772, when John Lees of Manchester is reported to have  invented a machine featuring \"a perpetual revolving cloth, called a  feeder,\" that fed the fibers into the machine.[2] Shortly afterward, the  stripper rollers[3] and the doffer comb[4] (a mechanical utilization of  Paul's hand device) were added. Both James Hargreaves and Richard  Arkwright claimed to be the inventor of these improvements, but it was  Arkwright who, in 1775, first patented these ideas. His comb and crank  (see fig. 6) provided a mechanical means by which the carded fibers  could be removed from the cylinder. With this, the cylinder card became  a practical machine. Arkwright continued the modification of the doffing  end by drawing the carded fibers through a funnel and then passing them  through two rollers. This produced a continuous sliver, a narrow ribbon  of fibers ready to be spun into yarn. However, it was soon realized that  the bulk characteristic desired in woolen yarns (but not desired in the  compact types such as worsted yarns or cotton yarns) required that the  wool be carded in a machine that would help produce this.    [Illustration: Figure 7.--NEWBURYPORT, MASSACHUSETTS, in 1796, AN  ENGRAVING FROM JOHN J. CURRIER'S _History of Newburyport,  Massachusetts_, 1764-1909, vol. 2, Newburyport, 1906-09.]    In carding wool it was found more effective to omit the flat stationary  cards and to use only rollers to work the fibers. The method of  preparing the sliver also had to be changed. Since it was necessary to  remove the wool fibers crosswise in the sliver, a fluted wooden cylinder  called a roller-bowl was used in conjunction with an under board or  shell. As a given section of the carded wool was fed between the fluted  cylinder and the board, the action of the cylinder rolled the fibers  into a sliver about the diameter of the finger and the length of the  cylinder. Although these were only 24-inch lengths as compared to the  continuous sliver produced by the Arkwright cotton-carding machine,[5]  wool could still be carded with much more speed and thoroughness than  with the small hand cards. This then was the state of mechanical wool  carding in England in the 1790's as two experienced wool manufacturers,  John and Arthur Scholfield, planned their trip to America.      John and Arthur Scholfield    The Scholfields, however, were not to be the first to introduce  mechanical wool carding into America. Several attempts had been made  prior to their arrival. In East Hartford, Connecticut, \"about 1770  Elisha Pitkin had built a mill on the east side of Main Street near the  old meeting-house and Hockanum Bridge, which was run by water-power,  supplied by damming the Hockanum River. Here, beside grinding grain and  plaster, was set up the first wool-carding machine in the state, and, it  is believed, in the country.\"[6] Samual Mayall in Boston, about 1788 or  1789, set up a carding machine operated by horse power. In 1791 he moved  to Gray, Maine, where he operated a shop for wool carding and cloth  dressing.[7] Of the machines used at the Hartford Woolen Manufactory,  organized in 1788, a viewer reported he saw \"two carding-engines,  working by water, of a very inferior construction.\" They were further  described as having \"two large center cylinders in each, with two  doffers, and only two working cylinders, of the breadth of bare sixteen  inches, said to be invented by some person there.\"[8] But these were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27190"],[0,"Pussy and Doggy Tales (#1)"],[1,"and Doggy Tales            Pussy      and Doggy            Tales             By      E.

Did you ever hear a  cat laugh? People say that cats often have occasion to do it.    \"I do know one story,\" she said; \"but I'm not sure that it's true,  though it was told me by a most respectable brindled gentleman, a great  friend of my dear mother's. He said he was a second cousin twenty-nine  times removed of Mrs. Tabby White, the lady the story is about.\"    \"Oh, do tell it,\" said all the kittens, sitting up very straight and  looking at their mother with green anxious eyes.    \"Very well,\" she said kindly; \"only if you interrupt I shall leave off.\"    So there was silence in the barn, except for Mrs. Buff's voice and the  soft sound of pleased purring which the kittens made as they listened to  the enchanting tale.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Mrs. Tabby White seems to have been as clever a cat as ever went  rat-catching in a pair of soft-soled shoes. She always knew just where a  mouse would peep out of the wainscot, and she had her soft-sharp paw on  him before he had time to know that he was not alone in the room. She  knew how to catch nice breakfasts for herself and her children, a trick  I will teach you, my dears, when the spring comes; she used to lie quite  quietly among the ivy on the wall, and then take the baby birds out of  the nest when the grown-up birds had gone to the grub-shop. Mrs. Tabby  White was very clever, as I said--so clever that presently she was not  satisfied with being at the very top of the cat profession.    \"'Cat-people have more sense than human people, of course,' she said to  herself; 'but still there are some things one might learn from them. I  must watch and see how they do things.'    \"So next morning when the cook gave Mrs. Tabby White her breakfast, she  noticed that cook poured the milk out of a jug into a saucer. That  afternoon Tabby felt thirsty, but instead of putting her head into the  jug and drinking in the usual way,--you know--she tilted up the jug to  pour the milk out as she had seen the cook do. But cats' paws, though  they are so strong to catch rats and mice and birds, are too weak to  hold big brown jugs. The nasty deceitful jug fell off the dresser and  broke itself. 'Just to spite me, I do believe,' said Mrs. Tabby. And the  milk was all spilled.    \"'Now how on earth could that jug have been broken?' said cook, when she  came in.    \"'It must have been the cat,' said the kitchenmaid; and she was quite  right, but nobody believed her.    \"Then Mrs. Tabby White noticed that human people slept in big  soft-cushioned white beds, instead of sleeping on the kitchen  hearth-rug, or in the barn, like cat people. So she said to her children  one evening--    \"'My dears, we are going to move into a new house.'    \"And the kittens were delighted, and they all went upstairs very  quietly, and crept into the very best human bed. But unfortunately that  bed had been got ready for a human uncle to sleep in; and when he found  the cats there he turned them out, not gently, and threw boots at them  till they fled, pale with fright to the ends of their pretty tails. And  next morning he told the Mistress of the house that horrid CATS had been  in his bed, and he vowed that he would never pass another night under a  roof where such things were possible. Mrs. Tabby White was very  glad--because no lady can wish for the visits of a person who throws  boots at her. But the Mistress of the house said sadly, 'Oh, Tabby!--you  have lost us a fortune!' And Tabby for all her cleverness didn't  understand what the Mistress meant, but went on purring proudly, and  wondering what clever thing she could do next. And _I_ don't know what  it meant either, so don't you interrupt with silly questions.    \"'I think we ought to wear shoes,' was the next thing Mrs. Tabby White  said; but all the human shoes were too big for her. However, there was a  nice pair of salmon-coloured kid shoes, quite new, belonging to the  human child's big doll--and Mrs. Tabby White put them on her eldest  kitten's little browny feet.    \"'Now, Brindle,' she said (he was named after the gentleman who told me  the story), 'you are grander than any kitten ever was before.' And at  first Brindle felt pleased--then he tried to feel pleased--then he knew  he wasn't pleased at all. Then the shoes began to hurt him horribly, so  he mewed sadly; and Mrs. Tabby White boxed his ears softly--as mother  cats do; _you_ know how I mean! But when she was asleep he took off the  pink shoes and bit them to pieces. And Nurse slapped him for it. Poor  Mrs. Tabby White was very miserable when she saw her son being slapped:  for it is one thing to box your son's ears (softly, as mother cats do;  _you_ know how I mean), and quite another to see another person do  it--heavily, as is the way with nursemaids.    \"But the last and greatest effort Mrs. Tabby White made to imitate human  manners was one Saturday night.    \"She saw the human child have its bath before the nursery fire, with hot  water, pink soap, dry towels, and much fussing, and she said to herself,  'Why should I waste hours every day in washing my children with my  little white paws and my little pink tongue, when this human child can  be made clean in ten minutes with this big bath. If I had more time I  could learn to be cleverer, and I should end by being the most  wonderful Cat in all the world.' So she sat, and watched, and waited.    \"When the human child was in bed and asleep, Nurse went down to her  supper, leaving the bath to be cleared away later, for it was a hot  supper of baked onions and toasted cheese, and if you don't go to that  supper directly it is ready, you may as well not go at all, for it won't  be worth eating--at least so I have heard the kitchenmaid say.    \"Mrs. Tabby White waited till she heard the last of Nurse's steps on the  stairs below, and then she put both her cat-children into the tub, and  washed them with rose-scented soap and a Turkey sponge. At first they  thought it very good fun, but presently the soap got in their eyes and  they were frightened of the sponge, and they cried, mewing piteously, to  be taken out. I don't know how she could have done it, I couldn't  have treated a kitten of _mine_ like that.    \"When she took them out, Mrs. Tabby tried to dry them with the soft  towel, but somehow catskin is not so easy to dry as child-skin, and the  little cats began to shiver, and moan: 'Oh, mother, we were so nice and  warm, and now we are so cold! Why is it? What have we done? Were we  naughty?'    \"'Drat the cats!' said Nurse, when she came up from supper, and found  Mrs. Tabby White trying to warm her kittens against her own comfortable  fur; 'if they haven't tumbled in the bath!'    \"Nurse dried the poor, dear, cruelly-used kittens a little (her hands  were bigger than Mrs. Tabby's, so she could do it better), and put them  in a basket with flannel, and next day Tabby-Kit was quite well, though  rather ragged looking; but Brindle had taken a chill, and for days he  hung between life and death.
