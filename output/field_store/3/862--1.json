THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECT OF MORAL EDUCATION         OUTLINE          INTRODUCTION      _Education as a public business_    It is one of the complaints of the schoolmaster that the public does not  defer to his professional opinion as completely as it does to that of  practitioners in other professions. At first sight it might seem as  though this indicated a defect either in the public or in the  profession; and yet a wider view of the situation would suggest that  such a conclusion is not a necessary one. The relations of education to  the public are different from those of any other professional work.  Education is a public business with us, in a sense that the protection  and restoration of personal health or legal rights are not. To an extent  characteristic of no other institution, save that of the state itself,  the school has power to modify the social order. And under our political  system, it is the right of each individual to have a voice in the making  of social policies as, indeed, he has a vote in the determination of  political affairs. If this be true, education is primarily a public  business, and only secondarily a specialized vocation. The layman, then,  will always have his right to some utterance on the operation of the  public schools.      _Education as expert service_    I have said \"some utterance,\" but not \"all\"; for school-mastering has  its own special mysteries, its own knowledge and skill into which the  untrained layman cannot penetrate. We are just beginning to recognize  that the school and the government have a common problem in this  respect. Education and politics are two functions fundamentally  controlled by public opinion. Yet the conspicuous lack of efficiency and  economy in the school and in the state has quickened our recognition of  a larger need for expert service. But just where shall public opinion  justly express itself, and what shall properly be left to expert  judgment?      _The relations of expert opinion and public opinion_    In so far as broad policies and ultimate ends affecting the welfare of  all are to be determined, the public may well claim its right to settle  issues by the vote or voice of majorities. But the selection and  prosecution of the detailed ways and means by which the public will is  to be executed efficiently must remain largely a matter of specialized  and expert service. To the superior knowledge and technique required  here, the public may well defer.    In the conduct of the schools, it is well for the citizens to determine  the ends proper to them, and it is their privilege to judge of the  efficacy of results. Upon questions that concern all the manifold  details by which children are to be converted into desirable types of  men and women, the expert schoolmaster should be authoritative, at least  to a degree commensurate with his superior knowledge of this very  complex problem. The administration of the schools, the making of the  course of study, the selection of texts, the prescription of methods of  teaching, these are matters with which the people, or their  representatives upon boards of education, cannot deal save with danger  of becoming mere meddlers.      _The discussion of moral education an illustration of mistaken views of  laymen_    Nowhere is the validity of this distinction between education as a  public business and education as an expert professional service brought  out more clearly than in an analysis of the public discussion of the  moral work of the school. How frequently of late have those unacquainted  with the special nature of the school proclaimed the moral ends of  education and at the same time demanded direct ethical instruction as  the particular method by which they were to be realized! This, too, in  spite of the fact that those who know best the powers and limitations of  instruction as an instrument have repeatedly pointed out the futility of  assuming that knowledge of right constitutes a guarantee of right doing.  How common it is for those who assert that education is for social  efficiency to assume that the school should return to the barren  discipline of the traditional formal subjects, reading, writing, and the  rest! This, too, regardless of the fact that it has taken a century of  educational evolution to make the course of study varied and rich enough  to call for those impulses and activities of social life which need  training in the child. And how many who speak glowingly of the large  services of the public schools to a democracy of free and self-reliant  men affect a cynical and even vehement opposition to the  \"self-government of schools\"! These would not have the children learn to  govern themselves and one another, but would have the masters rule them,  ignoring the fact that this common practice in childhood may be a  foundation for that evil condition in adult society where the citizens  are arbitrarily ruled by political bosses.    One need not cite further cases of the incompetence of the lay public to  deal with technical questions of school methods. Instances are plentiful  to show that well-meaning people, competent enough to judge of the aims  and results of school work, make a mistake in insisting upon the  prerogative of directing the technical aspects of education with a  dogmatism that would not characterize their statements regarding any  other special field of knowledge or action.      _A fundamental understanding of moral principles in education_    Nothing can be more useful than for the public and the teaching  profession to understand their respective functions. The teacher needs  to understand public opinion and the social order, as much as the public  needs to comprehend the nature of expert educational service. It will  take time to draw the boundary lines that will be conducive to respect,  restraint, and efficiency in those concerned; but a beginning can be  made upon fundamental matters, and nothing so touches the foundations of  our educational thought as a discussion of the moral principles in  education.    It is our pleasure to present a treatment of them by a thinker whose  vital influence upon the reform of school methods is greater than that  of any of his contemporaries. In his discussion of the social and  psychological factors in moral education, there is much that will  suggest what social opinion should determine, and much that will  indicate what must be left to the trained teacher and school official.          THE MORAL PURPOSE OF THE SCHOOL          I    THE MORAL PURPOSE OF THE SCHOOL      An English contemporary philosopher has called attention to the  difference between moral ideas and ideas about morality. \"Moral ideas\"  are ideas of any sort whatsoever which take effect in conduct and  improve it, make it better than it otherwise would be. Similarly, one  may say, immoral ideas are ideas of whatever sort (whether arithmetical  or geographical or physiological) which show themselves in making  behavior worse than it would otherwise be; and non-moral ideas, one may  say, are such ideas and pieces of information as leave conduct  uninfluenced for either the better or the worse. Now \"ideas about  morality\" may be morally indifferent or immoral or moral. There is  nothing in the nature of ideas _about_ morality, of information _about_  honesty or purity or kindness which automatically transmutes such ideas  into good character or good conduct.    This distinction between moral ideas, ideas of any sort whatsoever that  have become a part of character and hence a part of the working motives  of behavior, and ideas _about_ moral action that may remain as inert and  ineffective as if they were so much knowledge about Egyptian archaeology,  is fundamental to the discussion of moral education. The business of the  educator--whether parent or teacher--is to see to it that the greatest  possible number of ideas acquired by children and youth are acquired in  such a vital way that they become _moving_ ideas, motive-forces in the  guidance of conduct. This demand and this opportunity make the moral  purpose universal and dominant in all instruction--whatsoever the topic.  Were it not for this possibility, the familiar statement that the  ultimate purpose of all education is character-forming would be  hypocritical pretense; for as every one knows, the direct and immediate  attention of teachers and pupils must be, for the greater part of the  time, upon intellectual matters. It is out of the question to keep  direct moral considerations constantly uppermost. But it is not out of  the question to aim at making the methods of learning, of acquiring  intellectual power, and of assimilating subject-matter, such that they  will render behavior more enlightened, more consistent, more vigorous  than it otherwise would be.    The same distinction between \"moral ideas\" and \"ideas about morality\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2520"],[0,"The Man (#1)"],[1,"from the 1897 Robert Hayes edition by David Price, email  ccx074@pglaf.org            THE MAN      BY  BRAM STOKER    AUTHOR OF \"DRACULA,\" ETC.    LONDON: ROBERT HAYES, LTD.  SIXTY-ONE FLEET STREET, E.C.    Copyright, 1897, in the United States of America, according to Act of  Congress, by Bram Stoker.    [_All rights reserved_]          FORE-GLIMPSE      'I would rather be an angel than God!'    The voice of the speaker sounded clearly through the hawthorn tree.  The  young man and the young girl who sat together on the low tombstone looked  at each other.  They had heard the voices of the two children talking,  but had not noticed what they said; it was the sentiment, not the sound,  which roused their attention.    The girl put her finger to her lips to impress silence, and the man  nodded; they sat as still as mice whilst the two children went on  talking.    * * * * *    The scene would have gladdened a painter's heart.  An old churchyard.  The  church low and square-towered, with long mullioned windows, the yellow-  grey stone roughened by age and tender-hued with lichens.  Round it  clustered many tombstones tilted in all directions.  Behind the church a  line of gnarled and twisted yews.    The churchyard was full of fine trees.  On one side a magnificent cedar;  on the other a great copper beech.  Here and there among the tombs and  headstones many beautiful blossoming trees rose from the long green  grass.  The laburnum glowed in the June afternoon sunlight; the lilac,  the hawthorn and the clustering meadowsweet which fringed the edge of the  lazy stream mingled their heavy sweetness in sleepy fragrance.  The  yellow-grey crumbling walls were green in places with wrinkled  harts-tongues, and were topped with sweet-williams and spreading house-  leek and stone-crop and wild-flowers whose delicious sweetness made for  the drowsy repose of perfect summer.    But amid all that mass of glowing colour the two young figures seated on  the grey old tomb stood out conspicuously.  The man was in conventional  hunting-dress: red coat, white stock, black hat, white breeches, and top-  boots.  The girl was one of the richest, most glowing, and yet withal  daintiest figures the eye of man could linger on.  She was in  riding-habit of hunting scarlet cloth; her black hat was tipped forward  by piled-up masses red-golden hair.  Round her neck was a white lawn  scarf in the fashion of a man's hunting-stock, close fitting, and sinking  into a gold-buttoned waistcoat of snowy twill.  As she sat with the long  skirt across her left arm her tiny black top-boots appeared underneath.  Her gauntleted gloves were of white buckskin; her riding-whip was plaited  of white leather, topped with ivory and banded with gold.    Even in her fourteenth year Miss Stephen Norman gave promise of striking  beauty; beauty of a rarely composite character.  In her the various  elements of her race seemed to have cropped out.  The firm-set jaw, with  chin broader and more square than is usual in a woman, and the wide fine  forehead and aquiline nose marked the high descent from Saxon through  Norman.  The glorious mass of red hair, of the true flame colour, showed  the blood of another ancient ancestor of Northern race, and suited well  with the voluptuous curves of the full, crimson lips.  The purple-black  eyes, the raven eyebrows and eyelashes, and the fine curve of the  nostrils spoke of the Eastern blood of the far-back wife of the Crusader.  Already she was tall for her age, with something of that lankiness which  marks the early development of a really fine figure.  Long-legged, long-  necked, as straight as a lance, with head poised on the proud neck like a  lily on its stem.    Stephen Norman certainly gave promise of a splendid womanhood.  Pride,  self-reliance and dominance were marked in every feature; in her bearing  and in her lightest movement.    Her companion, Harold An Wolf, was some five years her senior, and by  means of those five years and certain qualities had long stood in the  position of her mentor.  He was more than six feet two in height, deep-  chested, broad-shouldered, lean-flanked, long-armed and big-handed.  He  had that appearance strength, with well-poised neck and forward set of  the head, which marks the successful athlete.    The two sat quiet, listening.  Through the quiet hum of afternoon came  the voices of the two children.  Outside the lich-gate, under the shade  of the spreading cedar, the horses stamped occasionally as the flies  troubled them.  The grooms were mounted; one held the delicate-limbed  white Arab, the other the great black horse.    'I would rather be an angel than God!'    The little girl who made the remark was an ideal specimen of the village  Sunday-school child.  Blue-eyed, rosy-cheeked, thick-legged, with her  straight brown hair tied into a hard bunch with a much-creased, cherry-  coloured ribbon.  A glance at the girl would have satisfied the most  sceptical as to her goodness.  Without being in any way smug she was  radiant with self-satisfaction and well-doing.  A child of the people; an  early riser; a help to her mother; a good angel to her father; a little  mother to her brothers and sisters; cleanly in mind and body;  self-reliant, full of faith, cheerful.    The other little girl was prettier, but of a more stubborn type; more  passionate, less organised, and infinitely more assertive.  Black-haired,  black-eyed, swarthy, large-mouthed, snub-nosed; the very type and essence  of unrestrained, impulsive, emotional, sensual nature.  A seeing eye  would have noted inevitable danger for the early years of her womanhood.  She seemed amazed by the self-abnegation implied by her companion's  statement; after a pause she replied:    'I wouldn't!  I'd rather be up at the top of everything and give orders  to the angels if I chose.  I can't think, Marjorie, why you'd rather take  orders than give them.'    'That's just it, Susan.  I don't want to give orders; I'd rather obey  them.  It must be very terrible to have to think of things so much, that  you want everything done your own way.  And besides, I shouldn't like to  have to be just!'    'Why not?' the voice was truculent, though there was wistfulness in it  also.    'Oh Susan.  Just fancy having to punish; for of course justice needs  punishing as well as praising.  Now an angel has such a nice time,  helping people and comforting them, and bringing sunshine into dark  places.  Putting down fresh dew every morning; making the flowers grow,  and bringing babies and taking care of them till their mothers find them.  Of course God is very good and very sweet and very merciful, but oh, He  must be very terrible.'    'All the same I would rather be God and able to do things!'    Then the children moved off out of earshot.  The two seated on the  tombstone looked after them.  The first to speak was the girl, who said:    'That's very sweet and good of Marjorie; but do you know, Harold, I like  Susie's idea better.'    'Which idea was that, Stephen?'    'Why, didn't you notice what she said: \"I'd like to be God and be able to  do things\"?'    'Yes,' he said after a moment's reflection.  'That's a fine idea in the  abstract; but I doubt of its happiness in the long-run.'    'Doubt of its happiness?  Come now? what could there be better, after  all?  Isn't it good enough to be God?  What more do you want?'    The girl's tone was quizzical, but her great black eyes blazed with some  thought of sincerity which lay behind the fun.  The young man shook his  head with a smile of kindly tolerance as he answered:    'It isn't that--surely you must know it.  I'm ambitious enough, goodness  knows; but there are bounds to satisfy even me.  But I'm not sure that  the good little thing isn't right.  She seemed, somehow, to hit a bigger  truth than she knew: \"fancy having to be just.\"'    'I don't see much difficulty in that.  Anyone can be just!'    'Pardon me,' he answered, 'there is perhaps nothing so difficult in the  whole range of a man's work.'  There was distinct defiance in the girl's  eyes as she asked:    'A man's work!  Why a man's work?  Isn't it a woman's work also?'    'Well, I suppose it ought to be, theoretically; practically it isn't.'    'And why not, pray?'  The mere suggestion of any disability of woman as  such aroused immediate antagonism.  Her companion suppressed a smile as  he answered deliberately:    'Because, my dear Stephen, the Almighty has ordained that justice is not  a virtue women can practise.  Mind, I do not say women are unjust.  Far  from it, where there are no interests of those dear to them they can be  of a sincerity of justice that can make a man's blood run cold.  But  justice in the abstract is not an ordinary virtue: it has to be  considerate as well as stern, and above all interest of all kinds and of  every one--'  The girl interrupted hotly:    'I don't agree with you at all.  You can't give an instance where women  are unjust.  I don't mean of course individual instances, but classes of  cases where injustice is habitual.'  The suppressed smile cropped out now  unconsciously round the man's lips in a way which was intensely  aggravating to the girl.    'I'll give you a few,' he said.  'Did you ever know a mother just to a  boy who beat her own boy at school?'  The girl replied quietly:    'Ill-treatment and bullying are subjects for punishment, not justice.'    'Oh, I don't mean that kind of beating.  I mean getting the prizes their  own boys contended for; getting above them in class; showing superior  powers in running or cricket or swimming, or in any of the forms of  effort in which boys vie with each other.'  The girl reflected, then she  spoke:    'Well, you may be right.  I don't altogether admit it, but I accept it as  not on my side.  But this is only one case.'    'A pretty common one.
