To his sombre  and cynical spirit all popular applause was always abhorrent, and  nothing amused him more at the end of a successful case than to hand  over the actual exposure to some orthodox official, and to listen with  a mocking smile to the general chorus of misplaced congratulation.  It  was indeed this attitude upon the part of my friend and certainly not  any lack of interesting material which has caused me of late years to  lay very few of my records before the public.  My participation in some  of his adventures was always a privilege which entailed discretion and  reticence upon me.    It was, then, with considerable surprise that I received a telegram  from Holmes last Tuesday--he has never been known to write where a  telegram would serve--in the following terms:    Why not tell them of the Cornish horror--strangest case I have handled.    I have no idea what backward sweep of memory had brought the matter  fresh to his mind, or what freak had caused him to desire that I should  recount it; but I hasten, before another cancelling telegram may  arrive, to hunt out the notes which give me the exact details of the  case and to lay the narrative before my readers.    It was, then, in the spring of the year 1897 that Holmes's iron  constitution showed some symptoms of giving way in the face of constant  hard work of a most exacting kind, aggravated, perhaps, by occasional  indiscretions of his own.  In March of that year Dr. Moore Agar, of  Harley Street, whose dramatic introduction to Holmes I may some day  recount, gave positive injunctions that the famous private agent lay  aside all his cases and surrender himself to complete rest if he wished  to avert an absolute breakdown.  The state of his health was not a  matter in which he himself took the faintest interest, for his mental  detachment was absolute, but he was induced at last, on the threat of  being permanently disqualified from work, to give himself a complete  change of scene and air.  Thus it was that in the early spring of that  year we found ourselves together in a small cottage near Poldhu Bay, at  the further extremity of the Cornish peninsula.    It was a singular spot, and one peculiarly well suited to the grim  humour of my patient.  From the windows of our little whitewashed  house, which stood high upon a grassy headland, we looked down upon the  whole sinister semicircle of Mounts Bay, that old death trap of sailing  vessels, with its fringe of black cliffs and surge-swept reefs on which  innumerable seamen have met their end.  With a northerly breeze it lies  placid and sheltered, inviting the storm-tossed craft to tack into it  for rest and protection.    Then come the sudden swirl round of the wind, the blistering gale from  the south-west, the dragging anchor, the lee shore, and the last battle  in the creaming breakers.  The wise mariner stands far out from that  evil place.    On the land side our surroundings were as sombre as on the sea. It was  a country of rolling moors, lonely and dun-colored, with an occasional  church tower to mark the site of some old-world village.  In every  direction upon these moors there were traces of some vanished race  which had passed utterly away, and left as its sole record strange  monuments of stone, irregular mounds which contained the burned ashes  of the dead, and curious earthworks which hinted at prehistoric strife.  The glamour and mystery of the place, with its sinister atmosphere of  forgotten nations, appealed to the imagination of my friend, and he  spent much of his time in long walks and solitary meditations upon the  moor. The ancient Cornish language had also arrested his attention, and  he had, I remember, conceived the idea that it was akin to the  Chaldean, and had been largely derived from the Phoenician traders in  tin.  He had received a consignment of books upon philology and was  settling down to develop this thesis when suddenly, to my sorrow and to  his unfeigned delight, we found ourselves, even in that land of dreams,  plunged into a problem at our very doors which was more intense, more  engrossing, and infinitely more mysterious than any of those which had  driven us from London.  Our simple life and peaceful, healthy routine  were violently interrupted, and we were precipitated into the midst of  a series of events which caused the utmost excitement not only in  Cornwall but throughout the whole west of England. Many of my readers  may retain some recollection of what was called at the time \"The  Cornish Horror,\" though a most imperfect account of the matter reached  the London press. Now, after thirteen years, I will give the true  details of this inconceivable affair to the public.    I have said that scattered towers marked the villages which dotted this  part of Cornwall.  The nearest of these was the hamlet of Tredannick  Wollas, where the cottages of a couple of hundred inhabitants clustered  round an ancient, moss-grown church.  The vicar of the parish, Mr.  Roundhay, was something of an archaeologist, and as such Holmes had  made his acquaintance. He was a middle-aged man, portly and affable,  with a considerable fund of local lore.  At his invitation we had taken  tea at the vicarage and had come to know, also, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis,  an independent gentleman, who increased the clergyman's scanty  resources by taking rooms in his large, straggling house.  The vicar,  being a bachelor, was glad to come to such an arrangement, though he  had little in common with his lodger, who was a thin, dark, spectacled  man, with a stoop which gave the impression of actual, physical  deformity.  I remember that during our short visit we found the vicar  garrulous, but his lodger strangely reticent, a sad-faced,  introspective man, sitting with averted eyes, brooding apparently upon  his own affairs.    These were the two men who entered abruptly into our little  sitting-room on Tuesday, March the 16th, shortly after our breakfast  hour, as we were smoking together, preparatory to our daily excursion  upon the moors.    \"Mr. Holmes,\" said the vicar in an agitated voice, \"the most  extraordinary and tragic affair has occurred during the night. It is  the most unheard-of business.  We can only regard it as a special  Providence that you should chance to be here at the time, for in all  England you are the one man we need.\"    I glared at the intrusive vicar with no very friendly eyes; but Holmes  took his pipe from his lips and sat up in his chair like an old hound  who hears the view-halloa.  He waved his hand to the sofa, and our  palpitating visitor with his agitated companion sat side by side upon  it.  Mr. Mortimer Tregennis was more self-contained than the clergyman,  but the twitching of his thin hands and the brightness of his dark eyes  showed that they shared a common emotion.    \"Shall I speak or you?\" he asked of the vicar.    \"Well, as you seem to have made the discovery, whatever it may be, and  the vicar to have had it second-hand, perhaps you had better do the  speaking,\" said Holmes.    I glanced at the hastily clad clergyman, with the formally dressed  lodger seated beside him, and was amused at the surprise which Holmes's  simple deduction had brought to their faces.    \"Perhaps I had best say a few words first,\" said the vicar, \"and then  you can judge if you will listen to the details from Mr. Tregennis, or  whether we should not hasten at once to the scene of this mysterious  affair.  I may explain, then, that our friend here spent last evening  in the company of his two brothers, Owen and George, and of his sister  Brenda, at their house of Tredannick Wartha, which is near the old  stone cross upon the moor.  He left them shortly after ten o'clock,  playing cards round the dining-room table, in excellent health and  spirits. This morning, being an early riser, he walked in that  direction before breakfast and was overtaken by the carriage of Dr.  Richards, who explained that he had just been sent for on a most urgent  call to Tredannick Wartha.  Mr. Mortimer Tregennis naturally went with  him.  When he arrived at Tredannick Wartha he found an extraordinary  state of things.  His two brothers and his sister were seated round the  table exactly as he had left them, the cards still spread in front of  them and the candles burned down to their sockets.  The sister lay back  stone-dead in her chair, while the two brothers sat on each side of her  laughing, shouting, and singing, the senses stricken clean out of them.  All three of them, the dead woman and the two demented men, retained  upon their faces an expression of the utmost horror--a convulsion of  terror which was dreadful to look upon.  There was no sign of the  presence of anyone in the house, except Mrs. Porter, the old cook and  housekeeper, who declared that she had slept deeply and heard no sound  during the night.  Nothing had been stolen or disarranged, and there is  absolutely no explanation of what the horror can be which has  frightened a woman to death and two strong men out of their senses.  There is the situation, Mr. Holmes, in a nutshell, and if you can help  us to clear it up you will have done a great work.\"    I had hoped that in some way I could coax my companion back into the  quiet which had been the object of our journey; but one glance at his  intense face and contracted eyebrows told me how vain was now the  expectation.  He sat for some little time in silence, absorbed in the  strange drama which had broken in upon our peace.    \"I will look into this matter,\" he said at last.  \"On the face of it,  it would appear to be a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23494"],[0,"Notable Voyagers, From Columbus to Nordenskiold (#1)"],[1,"Voyagers, From Columbus to Nordenskiold, by W.H.G.

It was interesting, too, to be told the real story of Alexander Selkirk,  the original of the famous \"Robinson Crusoe\" book.    The story of some of the adventurers who looked for the North-West  passage were most interesting, as well.

In the year 1486 a council of learned professors of geography,  mathematics, and all branches of science, erudite friars, accomplished  bishops, and other dignitaries of the Church, were seated in the vast  arched hall of the old Dominican convent of Saint Stephen in Salamanca,  then the great seat of learning in Spain.  They had met to hear a simple  mariner, then standing in their midst, propound and defend certain  conclusions at which he had arrived regarding the form and geography of  the earth, and the possibility, nay, the certainty, that by sailing  west, the unknown shores of Eastern India could be reached.  Some of his  hearers declared it to be grossly presumptuous in an ordinary man to  suppose, after so many profound philosophers and mathematicians had been  studying the world, and so many able navigators had been sailing about  it for years past, that there remained so vast a discovery for him to  make.  Some cited the books of the Old Testament to prove that he was  wrong, others the explanations of various reverend commentators.  Doctrinal points were mixed up with philosophical discussions, and a  mathematical demonstration was allowed no weight if it appeared to clash  with a text of Scripture or comment of one of the fathers.    Although Pliny and the wisest of the ancients had maintained the  possibility of an antipodes in the southern hemisphere, these learned  gentlemen made out that it was altogether a novel theory.    Others declared that to assert there were inhabited lands on the  opposite side of the globe would be to maintain that there were nations  not descended from Adam, as it would have been impossible for them to  have passed the intervening ocean, and therefore discredit would be  thrown on the Bible.    Again, some of the council more versed in science, though admitting the  globular form of the earth, and the possibility of an opposite habitable  hemisphere, maintained that it would be impossible to arrive there on  account of the insupportable heat of the torrid zone; besides which, if  the circumference of the earth was as great as they supposed, it would  require three years to make the voyage.    Several, with still greater absurdity, advanced as an objection that  should a ship succeed in reaching the extremity of India, she could  never get back again, as the rotundity of the globe would present a kind  of mountain up which it would be impossible for her to sail even with  the most favourable wind.    The mariner replied in answer to the scriptural objection that the  inspired writers were not speaking technically as cosmographers, but  figuratively, in language addressed to all comprehensions, and that the  commentaries of the fathers were not to be considered as philosophical  propoundings, which it was necessary either to admit or refute.    In regard to the impossibility of passing the torrid zone, he himself  stated that he had voyaged as far as Guinea under the equinoxial line,  and had found that region not only traversable, but abounding in  population, fruits, and pasturage.    Who was this simple mariner who could thus dare to differ from so many  learned sages?  His person was commanding; his demeanour elevated; his  eye kindling; his manner that of one who had a right to be heard, while  a rich flow of eloquence carried his hearers with him.  His countenance  was handsome; his hair already blanched by thought, toil, and privation.    He was no other than Columbus, who, after his proposals had been  rejected by the Court of Portugal, had addressed himself to that of  Spain, and had, year after year, waited patiently to obtain a hearing  from Ferdinand and Isabella, then occupied in their wars against the  Moors.    He had been a seaman from the age of fourteen.  He was born in the city  of Genoa about the year 1435, where his father, Dominico Colombo,  carried on the business of a wool comber, which his ancestors had  followed for several generations.  He was the eldest of three brothers,  the others being Bartholomew and Diego.  He had at an early age evinced  a desire for the sea, and accordingly his education had been mainly  directed to fit him for maritime life.    His first voyages were made with a distant relative named Colombo, a  hardy veteran of the seas, who had risen to some distinction by his  bravery.    Under this relative young Christopher saw much service, both warlike and  in trading voyages, until he gained command of a war ship of good size.  When serving in the squadron of his cousin information was brought that  four richly-laden Venetian galleys were on their return voyage from  Flanders.  The squadron lay in wait for them off the Portuguese coast,  between Lisbon and Cape Saint Vincent.  A desperate engagement ensued;  the vessels grappled each other.  That commanded by Columbus was engaged  with a huge Venetian galley.  Hand-grenades and other fiery missiles  were thrown on board her, and the galley was wrapped in flames.  So  closely were the vessels fastened together, that both were involved in  one conflagration.  The crews threw themselves into the sea.  Columbus  seized an oar, and being an expert swimmer, reached the shore, though  fully two leagues distant.  On recovering he made his way to Lisbon.  Possibly he may have resided there previously; certain it is that he  there married a lady, the daughter of a distinguished navigator, from  whose widow he obtained much information regarding the voyages and  expeditions of her late husband, as well as from his papers, charts,  journals, and memoranda.    Having become naturalised in Portugal, he sailed occasionally on voyages  to the coast of Guinea, and when on shore supported his family by making  maps and charts, which in those days required a degree of knowledge and  experience sufficient to entitle the possessor to distinction.    He associated with various navigators, and he noted down all he heard.  It was said by some that islands had been seen far away to the west when  they had been driven in that direction.  Whatever credit might have been  given to these reports by Columbus, he had far stronger reasons for  believing that, by sailing across the ocean to the west, he should reach  land.  He was of opinion that about one-third of the circumference of  the earth was unknown and unexplored.  A great portion of this might be  filled up by the eastern regions of Asia, while the tract of water  intervening between these countries might be less than at first  supposed.    In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, two great travellers, Marco  Polo and Sir John Mandeville, journeyed eastward over a large portion of  Asia, and had given vivid descriptions of the magnificence of its cities  and scenery.  Marco Polo especially had described two large islands,  Ontilla and Cipango, the latter undoubtedly Japan, which it was expected  would be the first reached by a navigator sailing westward.    A Portuguese pilot, Martin Vicenti, after sailing four hundred and  fifty-two leagues to the west of Cape Saint Vincent, had found a piece  of carved wood evidently laboured with an iron instrument, and as  probably the wind had drifted it from the west, it might have come from  some unknown land in that direction.  A brother-in-law of Columbus had  likewise found a similar piece of wood drifted from the same quarter.  Reeds of enormous size, such as were described by Ptolemy to grow in  India, had been picked up, and trunks of huge pine-trees had been driven  on the shores of the Azores, such as did not grow on any of those  islands.  The bodies of two dead men, whose features differed from those  of any known race of people, had been cast on the island of Flores.  There were"]]]
