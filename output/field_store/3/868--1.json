 I    ANIMAL CONCERTS      An abbot, a man of wit, and skilled in the making of new musical  instruments, was ordered by Louis XI., king of France, more in jest than  earnest, to procure him a concert of swines' voices. The abbot said that  the thing could doubtless be done, but it would cost a good deal of  money. The king ordered that he should have as much as he required for  the purpose. The abbot then contrived as strange a thing as ever was  seen. Out of a great number of hogs of various ages, which he got  together under a tent, or pavilion, covered with velvet, and before  which he had a table of wood painted with a certain number of keys, he  made an organical instrument, and as he played upon the keys with little  spikes which pricked the hogs, he made them cry in such order and  consonance that he highly delighted the king and all his company.          II    A NEWFOUNDLAND DOG      One of the magistrates in Harbor Grace, in Newfoundland, had an old dog  of the regular web-footed species peculiar to that island, who was in  the habit of carrying a lantern before his master at night, as steadily  as the most attentive servant could do, stopping short when his master  made a stop, and going ahead when he was ready to follow.    If his master was away from home, and the command was given \"Go fetch  thy master,\" he would at once pick up the lantern, hold it fast between  his teeth, and start for the town, which was more than a mile away from  the home of his master. He would stop at the door of every house which  he knew his master was in the habit of visiting, and laying down his  lantern, growl and strike the door making all the noise in his power,  until it was opened. If his master was not in the house, he would go on  farther in the same way, till he found him. If he had gone with him only  once to a house, this was enough to make him take in that house in his  rounds.

Ltd.,  Watford, Herts._          PREFACE      The following essays have been written and published at various times,  and my thanks are due to the previous publishers for the permission to  reprint them.    The essay on \"Mysticism and Logic\" appeared in the _Hibbert Journal_  for July, 1914. \"The Place of Science in a Liberal Education\" appeared  in two numbers of _The New Statesman_, May 24 and 31, 1913. \"The Free  Man's Worship\" and \"The Study of Mathematics\" were included in a  former collection (now out of print), _Philosophical Essays_, also  published by Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co. Both were written in 1902;  the first appeared originally in the _Independent Review_ for 1903,  the second in the _New Quarterly_, November, 1907. In theoretical  Ethics, the position advocated in \"The Free Man's Worship\" is not  quite identical with that which I hold now: I feel less convinced than  I did then of the objectivity of good and evil. But the general  attitude towards life which is suggested in that essay still seems to  me, in the main, the one which must be adopted in times of stress and  difficulty by those who have no dogmatic religious beliefs, if inward  defeat is to be avoided.    The essay on \"Mathematics and the Metaphysicians\" was written in 1901,  and appeared in an American magazine, _The International Monthly_,  under the title \"Recent Work in the Philosophy of Mathematics.\" Some  points in this essay require modification in view of later work.  These are indicated in footnotes. Its tone is partly explained by the  fact that the editor begged me to make the article \"as romantic as  possible.\"    All the above essays are entirely popular, but those that follow are  somewhat more technical. \"On Scientific Method in Philosophy\" was the  Herbert Spencer lecture at Oxford in 1914, and was published by the  Clarendon Press, which has kindly allowed me to include it in this  collection. \"The Ultimate Constituents of Matter\" was an address to  the Manchester Philosophical Society, early in 1915, and was published  in the _Monist_ in July of that year. The essay on \"The Relation of  Sense-data to Physics\" was written in January, 1914, and first  appeared in No. 4 of that year's volume of _Scientia_, an  International Review of Scientific Synthesis, edited by M. Eugenio  Rignano, published monthly by Messrs. Williams and Norgate, London,  Nicola Zanichelli, Bologna, and Félix Alcan, Paris. The essay \"On the  Notion of Cause\" was the presidential address to the Aristotelian  Society in November, 1912, and was published in their _Proceedings_  for 1912-13. \"Knowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by Description\"  was also a paper read before the Aristotelian Society, and published  in their _Proceedings_ for 1910-11.

Some men  have achieved greatness through one of these impulses alone, others  through the other alone: in Hume, for example, the scientific impulse  reigns quite unchecked, while in Blake a strong hostility to science  co-exists with profound mystic insight. But the greatest men who have  been philosophers have felt the need both of science and of mysticism:  the attempt to harmonise the two was what made their life, and what  always must, for all its arduous uncertainty, make philosophy, to some  minds, a greater thing than either science or religion.    Before attempting an explicit characterisation of the scientific and  the mystical impulses, I will illustrate them by examples from two  philosophers whose greatness lies in the very intimate blending which  they achieved. The two philosophers I mean are Heraclitus and Plato.    Heraclitus, as every one knows, was a believer in universal flux: time  builds and destroys all things. From the few fragments that remain, it  is not easy to discover how he arrived at his opinions, but there are  some sayings that strongly suggest scientific observation as the  source.    \"The things that can be seen, heard, and learned,\" he says, \"are what  I prize the most.\" This is the language of the empiricist, to whom  observation is the sole guarantee of truth. \"The sun is new every  day,\" is another fragment; and this opinion, in spite of its  paradoxical character, is obviously inspired by scientific reflection,  and no doubt seemed to him to obviate the difficulty of understanding  how the sun can work its way underground from west to east during the  night. Actual observation must also have suggested to him his central  doctrine, that Fire is the one permanent substance, of which all  visible things are passing phases. In combustion we see things change  utterly, while their flame and heat rise up into the air and vanish.    \"This world, which is the same for all,\" he says, \"no one of gods or  men has made; but it was ever, is now, and ever shall be, an  ever-living Fire, with measures kindling, and measures"]]]
