SUMMARY: A collection of forty-seven poems about subjects and  experiences familiar to children.    [1. English poetry]  I. Title.  II. Series.  [PR6007.E3S6 1976]   821'.9'12  75-32200  ISBN 0-8240-2310-2    _Printed in the United States of America_          _Preface_      The Romantic poets rediscovered a pastoral and Biblical dream: that a  child was the most innocent and the wisest of us all. Wordsworth  hailed him as \"Mighty Prophet! Seer blest!\" And in the next generation  Victorian novelists took that dream seriously enough to make children  the heroes and heroines of their most searching fictions. There had  been no \"children's literature\" to speak of before, except for the  oral and \"popular\" tradition, including lullabies and _Mother Goose_,  some of which go back as far as Tudor and even medieval times.    Children's literature today is an immense and complex domain; and  leaving aside for the present the works composed by children  themselves, what remains varies tremendously in skill and delight, as  well as in subtlety and intention. So I shall also set aside those  minimal \"vocabulary-building\" tales and verses whose small virtues are  rarely more than therapeutic, and direct myself only to that  specialized but most important category--poems written by a skilled  and adult poet but addressed to an audience of children who are likely  to be read to until they are skillful enough to read the same verses  for themselves.    The dangers for the poet in addressing so composite an audience are  enormous: cuteness, coyness, archness and condescension are only the  most obvious ones. Some great writers of children's verse--Lewis  Carroll and Edward Lear--have successfully hedged themselves against  these dangers by insistent comedy and parody (Carroll's \"serious\"  children's verse is maudlin and embarrassing). By this means they have  contrived what the child will take as lovely, unintimidating,  mysterious, rational nonsense, and what the adult will recognize as a  travesty or burlesque of something very edgy indeed. Thus, Lear's \"The  Dong with the Luminous Nose\" and Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\" are,  respectively, bright and disguised versions of gothic terror and  misery on the one hand, and medieval knightly exploit on the other,  both rendered innocuous for the nursery and ridiculous for the adult.  The risks of seriousness have been successfully avoided.    The poetry of Walter de la Mare sings boldly and beautifully without  any of these hedges and condescensions. His work has the honest candor  of the border ballads and the fairy tales: as well as unmitigated  joys, they are full of the dangers and horrors and sorrows that every  child soon knows to be part of the world, however vainly parents try  to veil them. A child's curiosity about the forbidden will insist on  being satisfied; and better by verse than otherwise. This poetry is  also musically astute and demanding; it may surprise and alert the  parental reader; and it has its share of archaisms and poeticisms,  which, contrary to adult surmise, bemuse and fascinate children. And  it must be admitted that it is also relentlessly British; but then, so  is much good children's literature.    As a poet (he was also a gifted novelist and short-story writer) de la  Mare was praised by T. S. Eliot (\"the delicate, invisible web you  wove\") and by W. H. Auden (\"there are no good poems which are only for  children\"). His technical and linguistic skills are not, as Auden  rightly points out, a matter of indifference to children, who are in  the very business of learning language, as well as other facts of  life, and who are particularly sensitive to verbal rhythms, as Iona  and Peter Opie have splendidly demonstrated in _The Lore and Language  of Schoolchildren_.    Just as important, this is a poetry of charms and spells, witches and  dwarfs, ogres and fairies, full of dangers, omens, riddles and  triumphs. In \"The Ogre,\" for example, two sleeping children are about  to be plucked by an enormous ogre from their home:        Into their dreams no shadow fell        Of his disastrous thumb      Groping discreet, and gradual,        Across the quiet room.    But he is stopped, spellbound, abashed and defeated by the mother of  the children, who is in another room and, all unaware of the danger,  is singing a version of the Coventry Carol (which, in its original, is  addressed to the Christ Child) as a lullaby to her new-born baby.    I would guess that any child fortunate enough to grow up with these  poems ringing in memory's ear might have a remarkable reservoir of  music and excitement available to him. That is not a small gift.    Anthony Hecht      _ANTHONY HECHT teaches in the English Department of the University of  Rochester.

A jolly party of boys visit the circus.    =FATHER BROWN'S INDIAN TALE=    Dad's story is followed by an unexpected visitor who at first startles  then interests all of the little party gathered around the fireside.    =THE PICNIC AT MERRYVALE=    Did you ever go to a picnic in a large farm wagon, filled with boys and  girls? Then did you catch a fine lot of trout and broil them before a  camp-fire? \"Toad\" and \"Reddy\" did these very things and had a day long  to be remembered.    =CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS IN MERRYVALE=    Daddy Williams' Toy Shop is the center of interest to \"Toad\" and his  friends long before Christmas arrives. They plan a surprise that brings  joy to a poor family. The boys erect snow forts and the two sides have a  battle royal.    =MERRYVALE BOYS ON THE FARM=    \"Toad's\" grandmother invites him and \"Reddy\" to spend a month in the  country. Their experiences at Sunnyside farm, with its horses, cows,  pigs and chickens, are most entertainingly told, and they have the time  of their lives boating, swimming and fishing in the creek.    =HALLOWE'EN AT MERRYVALE=    For many days the boys had been looking forward to the party to be held  at Toad Brown's house, but the evening finally arrived and a number of  new games were played, although a few things happened which were not on  the program.    _Illustrations in Color 12mo.

Then we could get all the boys together and  have a battle.\"    \"It's the best fun I know of, next to swimming in the creek,\" was the  answer.    \"Here we are,\" he cried a few minutes later and both boys stopped in  front of a small shop window that looked very gay with a wonderful  display of Christmas toys.    \"See those skates hanging up by that sled. That's the kind I want,\"  pointed out Reddy. \"You screw them right into the heels of your shoes  and you bet they can't ever come off.\"    \"They're fine,\" agreed Toad, \"but look at that engine and train. It  goes right through the tunnel and up over the bridge. I wonder how fast  it can run.\"    \"That's a dandy mitt there,\" said the other, pointing to a baseball  outfit. \"I wouldn't be afraid to stop any kind of a ball with that on.\"    \"Wish my dad would get me a new sled like that flyer,\" sighed Toad. \"I  finished mine last winter when I ran into that tree with you and Herbie  on board.\"    \"You surely did,\" was the laughing answer. \"I remember how we all went  flying head first into a snow drift.\"    \"There's a nice pocket knife,\" was Toad's next remark. \"I mean the one  with the pearl handle, just next to that doll with the pink dress on.\"    \"Oh!\" exclaimed Reddy, \"here's what just suits me,\" catching sight, for  the first time, of a punching bag.    \"How do you work it?\"    \"Why, you see there's an elastic rope on each end of it, and one of them  you tie to a ring in the floor and the other to something overhead. Then  when you give it a punch it comes back to you with a bang.\"    \"Well, I'd rather have a football; then maybe we could get up a regular  team,\" remarked Toad.    \"I'll bet all those reals would cost about ten dollars,\" ventured the  other, pointing to a box of marbles toward the front of the window. \"If  I was rich I'd buy them.\"    \"What for? You have plenty. You won nearly all mine away from me.  Look!\" he added in a low voice, \"there goes Herbie's mother into the  store. Let's see what she buys.\"    \"Hello, Daddy,\" greeted both the boys, as old Mr. Williams, with his  white hair, red cheeks and dancing blue eyes, came to the doorway of the  shop and smiled at them.    \"Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas!\" he replied. \"Have you been good  boys?\"    \"I should say we have,\" cried Toad. \"Everybody's good before Christmas.\"    \"Well, run along home then, and I'll tell your mas just what you want,\"  promised Daddy. \"Herbie's ma's in here now and she doesn't want you boys  to know what she buys.\"    \"All right,\" answered Reddy. \"Don't forget to say I want a punching bag  and a pair of skates.\"    \"And I want a new sled,\" chimed in Toad, as they both started off.    \"Shucks, I didn't see half the things, did you?\" protested Reddy.    \"Oh, well, we can come down again this afternoon,\" was the cheering  answer. \"Come on over to my house, anyway,\" he called as they parted.          CHAPTER II    THE SNOW FIGHT      By evening the snow that Toad and Reddy had so eagerly awaited had come,  and by morning many inches had fallen. A crowd of boys had gathered on  the Brown's lawn, for the news of a snow battle had carried far.    \"First chooser!\" cried Charley Brown, a happy-faced boy who bore the  name of \"Chuck\" among his friends.    \"Second,\" shouted Reddy, and when the sides were chosen Toad found  himself with Herbie, a boy with whom he played very often, and four  others on Reddy's side.    It was then decided by the choosers, who were also the captains, to  build two forts, ten yards apart, and a half hour was agreed upon as  time enough in which to do the work.    \"We must hurry,\" Reddy told the boys he had chosen, \"and I think,\" he  added in a low voice, \"three of us had better build the fort while the  other three make snowballs, as we want a lot on hand so we wont have to  stop firing to make them.    \"Work fast,\" he ordered as he selected two of them to help him build the  fort.    Toad piled up great heaps of snow while Reddy and Herbie packed it down  with wooden spades into a wall which curved like a new moon.    \"How are the snowballs getting on, boys?\" asked Toad of the three boys  who were working hard making them.    \"We're stacking them up so they'll be easy to get at,\" answered one.    \"They're good hard ones,\" said another. \"It's fine packing snow.\"    \"We're going to have plenty, too,\" laughed the third.    \"Wonder what Fat's doing?\" cried Reddy. \"He's bringing a pail of water  from the house.\"    Frank, called \"Fat\" by the other boys, because of his size, was Reddy's  older brother.    \"I wonder,\" mused Toad. \"He's pouring it on the walls of their fort. Oh,  don't you see,\" he added a moment later, \"it's to make it freeze.\"    \"Let's do that too,\" proposed Herbie. \"I'll get the water,\" and he  started for the house.    Ten minutes later the walls of the fort were like a solid mass of ice,  and the snowballs were inside in four heaps so all were anxious for the  fun to begin.    [Illustration: \"Charge!\" shouted Reddy, on the run, the others close  upon his heels.]          CHAPTER III    THE VICTORY      \"Hey, Captain of the enemy!\" shouted Chuck from the other fort, \"are you  ready?\"    \"All ready,\" came the answer. \"Fire!\"    A storm of snowballs flew through the air and Reddy barely had time to  duck his head as they whizzed by.    \"Looks as though they had plenty of balls, too,\" exclaimed Toad, hastily  picking up an armful and running outside to get within closer range.    \"I don't think so,\" protested Herbie. \"I could see all of them working  on the fort. We have lots more, I'm sure.\"    \"Well,\" cried the Captain, \"let everybody take a pile of snowballs and  we'll run out together and maybe we can drive them from their fort.\"    Each boy carried as many as he could in one arm, this leaving the other  one free to throw with.    \"We'll have to make a quick run for it and throw just as fast and hard  as we can,\" said Herbie, as Toad, who had at that moment returned to the  fort in a great hurry, his hat covered with snow, exclaimed:    \"They got me, but I hit two or three of them!\"    \"All ready!\" shouted the Captain, and the others, following close on his  heels, dashed out.    Such a hail of snowballs met them that they halted for a moment, then  dashed onward right up to the enemy's"]]]
