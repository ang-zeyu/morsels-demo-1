The first is entitled _The  Sacred Beetle and Others_; the second and the third will be known as  _The Life of the Weevil_ and _More Beetles_ respectively.    _The Glow-worm_, which gives its name to the present book, did not  form part of the _Souvenirs entomologiques_ as originally published.  It is one of two essays written specially, at my request, for  translation into English, towards the close of Henri Fabre's life; in  fact, this and _The Ant-lion_, a short essay for children, were the  last works that came from the veteran author's pen. _The Glow-worm_  appeared first in the _Century Magazine_. Of the remaining chapters,  several have appeared in various periodicals, notably the _English  Review_ and in _Land and Water_, the editor and proprietors of which  admirable weekly have shown the most enlightened interest in Fabre's  work.    A part of the chapter entitled _The Dung-beetles of the Pampas_  figures in Messrs. Adam & Charles Black's volume, _The Life and Love  of the Insect_ (New York: the Macmillan Co.), translated by myself;  and the chapters on the Capricorn and Burying-beetles will be found in  Mr. T. Fisher Unwin's volume, _The Wonders of Instinct_ (New York: the  Century Co.), translated by myself and Mr. Bernard Miall, which also  contains _The Glow-worm_. These chapters are included in the present  edition by consent of and arrangement with the publishers named.    Lastly, Mr. Bernard Miall has earned my gratitude by the valuable  assistance which he has given me in preparing the translation of the  greater part of this volume.    ALEXANDER TEIXEIRA DE MATTOS.    CHELSEA, _5 September_, 1919.          CHAPTER I  THE GLOW-WORM      Few insects in our climes vie in popular fame with the Glow-worm, that  curious little animal which, to celebrate the little joys of life,  kindles a beacon at its tail-end. Who does not know it, at least by  name? Who has not seen it roam amid the grass, like a spark fallen  from the moon at its full? The Greeks of old called it [Greek:  lampouris], meaning, the bright-tailed. Science employs the same term:  it calls the lantern-bearer, _Lampyris noctiluca_, LIN. In this case,  the common name is inferior to the scientific phrase, which, when  translated, becomes both expressive and accurate.    In fact, we might easily cavil at the word \"worm.\" The Lampyris is not  a worm at all, not even in general appearance. He has six short legs,  which he well knows how to use; he is a gad-about, a trot-about. In  the adult state, the male is correctly garbed in wing-cases, like the  true Beetle that he is. The female is an ill-favoured thing who knows  naught of the delights of flying: all her life long, she retains the  larval shape, which, for the rest, is similar to that of the male, who  himself is imperfect so long as he has not achieved the maturity that  comes with pairing-time. Even in this initial stage, the word \"worm\"  is out of place. We French have the expression \"Naked as a worm,\" to  point to the lack of any defensive covering. Now the Lampyris is  clothed, that is to say, he wears an epidermis of some consistency;  moreover, he is rather richly coloured: his body is dark brown all  over, set off with pale pink on the thorax, especially on the lower  surface. Finally, each segment is decked at the hinder edge with two  spots of a fairly bright red. A costume like this was never worn by a  worm.    Let us leave this ill-chosen denomination and ask ourselves what the  Lampyris feeds upon. That master of the art of gastronomy,  Brillat-Savarin,[1] said:    \"Show me what you eat and I will tell you what you are.\"    [Footnote 1: Anthelme Brillat-Savarin (1755-1826), author of _La  Psychologie du gout_.--_Translator's Note_.]    A similar question should be addressed, by way of a preliminary, to  every insect whose habits we propose to study, for, from the least to  the greatest in the zoological progression, the stomach sways the  world; the data supplied by food are the chief of all the documents of  life. Well, in spite of his innocent appearance, the Lampyris is an  eater of flesh, a hunter of game; and he follows his calling with rare  villainy. His regular prey is the Snail.    This detail has long been known to entomologists. What is not so  well-known, what is not known at all yet, to judge by what I have  read, is the curious method of attack, of which I have seen no other  instance anywhere.    Before he begins to feast, the Glow-worm administers an anaesthetic:  he chloroforms his victim, rivalling in the process the wonders of our  modern surgery, which renders the patient insensible before operating  on him. The usual game is a small Snail hardly the size of a cherry,  such as, for instance, _Helix variabilis_, DRAP., who, in the hot  weather, collects in clusters on the stiff stubble and on other long,  dry stalks, by the roadside, and there remains motionless, in profound  meditation, throughout the scorching summer days. It is in some such  resting-place as this that I have often been privileged to light upon  the Lampyris banqueting on the prey which he had just paralyzed on its  shaky support by his surgical artifices.    But he is familiar with other preserves. He frequents the edges of the  irrigating-ditches, with their cool soil, their varied vegetation, a  favourite haunt of the mollusc. Here, he treats the game on the  ground; and, under these conditions, it is easy for me to rear him at  home and to follow the operator's performance down to the smallest  detail.    I will try to make the reader a witness of the strange sight. I place  a little grass in a wide glass jar. In this I install a few Glow-worms  and a provision of Snails of a suitable size, neither too large nor  too small, chiefly _Helix variabilis_. We must be patient and wait.  Above all, we must keep an assiduous watch, for the desired events  come unexpectedly and do not last long.    Here we are at last. The Glow-worm for a moment investigates the prey,  which, according to its habit, is wholly withdrawn in the shell,  except the edge of the mantle, which projects slightly. Then the  hunter's weapon is drawn, a very simple weapon, but one that cannot be  plainly perceived without the aid of a lens. It consists of two  mandibles bent back powerfully into a hook, very sharp and as thin as  a hair. The microscope reveals the presence of a slender groove  running throughout the length. And that is all.    The insect repeatedly taps the Snail's mantle with its instrument. It  all happens with such gentleness as to suggest kisses rather than  bites. As children, teasing one another, we used to talk of  \"tweaksies\" to express a slight squeeze of the finger-tips, something  more like a tickling than a serious pinch. Let us use that word. In  conversing with animals, language loses nothing by remaining juvenile.  It is the right way for the simple to understand one another.    The Lampyris doles out his tweaks. He distributes them methodically,  without hurrying, and takes a brief rest after each of them, as though  he wished to ascertain the effect produced. Their number is not great:  half-a-dozen, at most, to subdue the prey and deprive it of all power  of movement. That other pinches are administered later, at the time of  eating, seems very likely, but I cannot say anything for certain,  because the sequel escapes me. The first few, however--there are never  many--are enough to impart inertia and loss of all feeling to the  mollusc, thanks to the prompt, I might almost say, lightning methods  of the Lampyris, who, beyond a doubt, instils some poison or other by  means of his grooved hooks.    Here is the proof of the sudden efficacity of those twitches, so mild  in appearance: I take the Snail from the Lampyris, who has operated on  the edge of the mantle some four or five times. I prick him with a  fine needle in the fore-part, which the animal, shrunk into its shell,  still leaves exposed. There is no quiver of the wounded tissues, no  reaction against the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2788"],[0,"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boys (#1)"],[1,"MEN: LIFE AT PLUMFIELD WITH JO'S BOYS    By Louisa May Alcott           TO       FREDDY AND JOHNNY,       THE LITTLE MEN       TO WHOM SHE OWES SOME OF THE BEST AND HAPPIEST       HOURS OF HER LIFE,       THIS BOOK IS GRATEFULLY DEDICATED       BY THEIR LOVING       \"AUNT WEEDY\"        Contents         CHAPTER I.

NAT    \"Please, sir, is this Plumfield?\" asked a ragged boy of the man who  opened the great gate at which the omnibus left him.    \"Yes. Who sent you?\"    \"Mr. Laurence. I have got a letter for the lady.\"    \"All right; go up to the house, and give it to her; she'll see to you,  little chap.\"    The man spoke pleasantly, and the boy went on, feeling much cheered by  the words. Through the soft spring rain that fell on sprouting grass  and budding trees, Nat saw a large square house before him, a  hospitable-looking house, with an old-fashioned porch, wide steps, and  lights shining in many windows. Neither curtains nor shutters hid the  cheerful glimmer; and, pausing a moment before he rang, Nat saw many  little shadows dancing on the walls, heard the pleasant hum of young  voices, and felt that it was hardly possible that the light and warmth  and comfort within could be for a homeless \"little chap\" like him.    \"I hope the lady will see to me,\" he thought, and gave a timid rap with  the great bronze knocker, which was a jovial griffin's head.    A rosy-faced servant-maid opened the door, and smiled as she took the  letter which he silently offered. She seemed used to receiving strange  boys, for she pointed to a seat in the hall, and said, with a nod:    \"Sit there and drip on the mat a bit, while I take this in to missis.\"    Nat found plenty to amuse him while he waited, and stared about him  curiously, enjoying the view, yet glad to do so unobserved in the dusky  recess by the door.    The house seemed swarming with boys, who were beguiling the rainy  twilight with all sorts of amusements. There were boys everywhere,  \"up-stairs and down-stairs and in the lady's chamber,\" apparently, for  various open doors showed pleasant groups of big boys, little boys,  and middle-sized boys in all stages of evening relaxation, not to say  effervescence. Two large rooms on the right were evidently schoolrooms,  for desks, maps, blackboards, and books were scattered about. An open  fire burned on the hearth, and several indolent lads lay on their backs  before it, discussing a new cricket-ground, with such animation that  their boots waved in the air. A tall youth was practising on the flute  in one corner, quite undisturbed by the racket all about him. Two or  three others were jumping over the desks, pausing, now and then, to get  their breath and laugh at the droll sketches of a little wag who was  caricaturing the whole household on a blackboard.    In the room on the left a long supper-table was seen, set forth with  great pitchers of new milk, piles of brown and white bread, and perfect  stacks of the shiny gingerbread so dear to boyish souls. A flavor of  toast was in the air, also suggestions of baked apples, very tantalizing  to one hungry little nose and stomach.    The hall, however, presented the most inviting prospect of all, for  a brisk game of tag was going on in the upper entry. One landing  was devoted to marbles, the other to checkers, while the stairs were  occupied by a boy reading, a girl singing a lullaby to her doll, two  puppies, a kitten, and a constant succession of small boys sliding down  the banisters, to the great detriment of their clothes and danger to  their limbs.    So absorbed did Nat become in this exciting race, that he ventured  farther and farther out of his corner; and when one very lively boy  came down so swiftly that he could not stop himself, but fell off the  banisters, with a crash that would have broken any head but one rendered  nearly as hard as a cannon-ball by eleven years of constant bumping, Nat  forgot himself, and ran up to the fallen rider, expecting to find him  half-dead. The boy, however, only winked rapidly for a second, then lay  calmly looking up at the new face with a surprised, \"Hullo!\"    \"Hullo!\" returned Nat, not knowing what else to say, and thinking that  form of reply both brief and easy.    \"Are you a new boy?\" asked the recumbent youth, without stirring.    \"Don't know yet.\"    \"What's your name?\"    \"Nat Blake.\"    \"Mine's Tommy Bangs. Come up and have a go, will you?\" and Tommy got  upon his legs like one suddenly remembering the duties of hospitality.    \"Guess I won't, till I see whether I'm going to stay or not,\" returned  Nat, feeling the desire to stay increase every moment.    \"I say, Demi, here's a new one. Come and see to him;\" and the lively  Thomas returned to his sport with unabated relish.    At his call, the boy reading on the stairs looked up with a pair of big  brown eyes, and after an instant's pause, as if a little shy, he put the  book under his arm, and came soberly down to greet the new-comer, who  found something very attractive in the pleasant face of this slender,  mild-eyed boy.    \"Have you seen Aunt Jo?\" he asked, as if that was some sort of important  ceremony.    \"I haven't seen anybody yet but you boys; I'm waiting,\" answered Nat.    \"Did Uncle Laurie send you?\" proceeded Demi, politely, but gravely.    \"Mr. Laurence did.\"    \"He is Uncle Laurie; and he always sends nice boys.\"    Nat looked gratified at the remark, and smiled, in a way that made his  thin face very pleasant. He did not know what to say next, so the two  stood staring at one another in friendly silence, till the little girl  came up with her doll in her arms. She was very like Demi, only not so  tall, and had a rounder, rosier face, and blue eyes.    \"This is my sister, Daisy,\" announced Demi, as if presenting a rare and  precious creature.    The children nodded to one another; and the little girl's face dimpled  with pleasure, as she said affably:    \"I hope you'll stay. We have such good times here; don't we, Demi?\"    \"Of course, we do: that's what Aunt Jo has Plumfield for.\"    \"It seems a very nice place indeed,\" observed Nat, feeling that he must  respond to these amiable young persons.    \"It's the nicest place in the world, isn't it, Demi?\" said Daisy, who  evidently regarded her brother as authority on all subjects.    \"No, I think Greenland, where the icebergs and seals are, is more  interesting. But I'm fond of Plumfield, and it is a very nice place  to be in,\" returned Demi, who was interested just now in a book on  Greenland. He was about to offer to show Nat the pictures and  explain them, when the servant returned, saying with a nod toward the  parlor-door:    \"All right; you are to stop.\"    \"I'm glad; now come to Aunt Jo.\" And Daisy took him by the hand with a  pretty protecting air, which made Nat feel at home at once.    Demi returned to his beloved book, while his sister led the new-comer  into a back room, where a stout gentleman was frolicking with two little  boys on the sofa, and a thin lady was just finishing the letter which  she seemed to have been re-reading.    \"Here he is, aunty!\" cried Daisy.    \"So this is my new boy? I am glad to see you, my dear, and hope you'll  be happy here,\" said the lady, drawing him to her, and stroking back the  hair from his forehead with a kind hand and a motherly look, which made  Nat's lonely little heart yearn toward her.    She was not at all handsome, but she had a merry sort of face that never  seemed to have forgotten certain childish ways and looks, any more than  her voice and manner had; and these things, hard to describe but very  plain to see and feel, made her a genial, comfortable kind of person,  easy to get on with, and generally \"jolly,\" as boys would say. She saw  the little tremble of Nat's lips as she smoothed his hair, and her keen  eyes grew softer, but she only drew the shabby figure nearer and said,  laughing:    \"I am Mother Bhaer, that gentleman is Father Bhaer, and these are the  two little Bhaers. Come here, boys, and see Nat.\"    The three wrestlers obeyed at once; and the stout man, with a chubby  child on each shoulder, came up to welcome the new boy. Rob and Teddy  merely grinned at him, but Mr. Bhaer shook hands, and pointing to a low  chair near the fire, said, in a cordial voice:    \"There is a place all ready for thee, my son; sit down and dry thy wet  feet at once.\"    \"Wet? So they are! My dear, off with your shoes this minute, and I'll  have some dry things ready for you in a jiffy,\" cried Mrs. Bhaer,  bustling about so energetically that Nat found himself in the cosy  little chair, with dry socks and warm slippers on his feet, before he  would have had time to say Jack Robinson, if he had wanted to try. He  said \"Thank you, ma'am,\" instead; and said it so gratefully that Mrs.  Bhaer's eyes grew soft again, and she said something merry, because she  felt so tender, which was a way she had.    \"There are Tommy Bangs' slippers; but he never will remember to put them  on in the house; so he shall not have them. They are too big; but that's  all the better; you can't run away from us so fast as if they fitted.\"    \"I don't want to run away, ma'am.\" And Nat spread his grimy little hands  before the comfortable blaze, with a long sigh of"]]]
