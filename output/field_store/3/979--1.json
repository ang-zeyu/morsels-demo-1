PRESS OF J. J. LITTLE & CO.,    NOS. 10 TO 20 ASTOR PLACE, NEW YORK.          Please see the end of the text for TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES          PREFACE.      In the following account of the life and works of Sir WILLIAM HERSCHEL,  I have been obliged to depend strictly upon data already in print--the  _Memoir_ of his sister, his own scientific writings and the memoirs and  diaries of his cotemporaries. The review of his published works will, I  trust, be of use. It is based upon a careful study of all his papers in  the _Philosophical Transactions_ and elsewhere.    A life of HERSCHEL which shall be satisfactory in every particular can  only be written after a full examination of the materials which are  preserved at the family seat in England; but as two generations have  passed since his death, and as no biography yet exists which approaches  to completeness, no apology seems to me to be needed for a  conscientious attempt to make the best use of the scanty material which  we do possess.    This study will, I trust, serve to exhibit so much of his life as  belongs to the whole public. His private life belongs to his family,  until the time is come to let the world know more of the greatest of  practical astronomers and of the inner life of one of its most profound  philosophers,--of a great and ardent mind, whose achievements are and  will remain the glory of England.

CHAPTER I.    EARLY YEARS; 1738-1772.      Of the great modern philosophers, that one of whom least is known, is  WILLIAM HERSCHEL. We may appropriate the words which escaped him when  the barren region of the sky near the body of _Scorpio_ was passing  slowly through the field of his great reflector, during one of his  sweeps, to express our own sense of absence of light and knowledge:  _Hier ist wahrhaftig ein Loch im Himmel._    HERSCHEL prepared, about the year 1818, a biographical memorandum, which  his sister CAROLINA placed among his papers.    This has never been made public. The only thoroughly authentic sources  of information in possession of the world, are a letter written by  HERSCHEL himself, in answer to a pressing request for a sketch of his  life, and the _Memoir and Correspondence of CAROLINE HERSCHEL_ (London,  1876), a precious memorial not only of his life, but of one which  otherwise would have remained almost unknown, and one, too, which the  world could ill afford to lose. The latter, which has been ably edited  by Mrs. MARY CORNWALLIS HERSCHEL,[1] is the only source of knowledge in  regard to the early years of the great astronomer, and together with the  all too scanty materials to be gained from a diligent search through the  biography of the time, affords the data for those personal details of  his life, habits, and character, which seem to complete the distinct,  though partial conception of him which the student of his philosophical  writings acquires.    The letter referred to was published in the Goettingen Magazine of  Science and Literature, III., 4, shortly after the name of HERSCHEL had  become familiar to every ear through his discovery of _Uranus_, but  while the circumstances of the discovery, and the condition of the  amateur who made it, were still entirely unknown.    The editor (LICHTENBERG) says:        \"Herr HERSCHEL was good enough to send me, some time since, through      Herr MAGELLAN, copies of his Dissertations on Double Stars, on the      Parallax of the Fixed Stars, and on a new Micrometer. In the letter      which conveyed to him my thanks for his gift, I requested him to      note down a few facts in regard to his life, for publication in this      magazine, since various accounts, more or less incorrect, had      appeared in several journals. In answer, I received a very obliging      letter from him and what follows is that portion of it relating to      my request, which was sent me with full permission to make it      public.\"                                                      \"DATCHET, NEAR WINDSOR,                                                  _Nov. 15, 1783._        \"I was born in Hanover, November, 1738. My father, who was a      musician, destined me to the same profession, hence I was      instructed betimes in his art. That I might acquire a perfect      knowledge of the theory as well as of the practice of music, I was      set at an early age to study mathematics in all its      branches--algebra, conic sections, infinitesimal analysis, and the      rest.        \"The insatiable desire for knowledge thus awakened resulted next in      a course of languages; I learned French, English, and Latin, and      steadfastly resolved henceforth to devote myself wholly to those      sciences from the pursuit of which I alone looked for all my future      happiness and enjoyment. I have never been either necessitated or      disposed to alter this resolve. My father, whose means were limited,      and who consequently could not be as liberal to his children as he      would have desired, was compelled to dispose of them in one way or      another at an early age; consequently in my fifteenth year I      enlisted in military service, only remaining in the army, however,      until I reached my nineteenth year, when I resigned and went over to      England.        \"My familiarity with the organ, which I had carefully mastered      previously, soon procured for me the position of organist in      Yorkshire, which I finally exchanged for a similar situation at Bath      in 1766, and while here the peculiar circumstances of my post, as      agreeable as it was lucrative, made it possible for me to occupy      myself once more with my studies, especially with mathematics. When,      in the course of time, I took up astronomy, I determined to accept      nothing on faith, but to see with my own eyes everything which      others had seen before me. Having already some knowledge of the      science of optics, I resolved to manufacture my own telescopes, and      after many continuous, determined trials, I finally succeeded in      completing a so-called Newtonian instrument, seven feet in length.      From this I advanced to one of ten feet, and at last to one of      twenty, for I had fully made up my mind to carry on the improvement      of my telescopes as far as it could possibly be done. When I had      carefully and thoroughly perfected the great instrument in all its      parts, I made systematic use of it in my observations of the      heavens, first forming a determination never to pass by any, the      smallest, portion of them without due investigation. This habit,      persisted in, led to the discovery of the new planet (_Georgium      Sidus_). This was by no means the result of chance, but a simple      consequence of the position of the planet on that particular      evening, since it occupied precisely that spot in the heavens which      came in the order of the minute observations that I had previously      mapped out for myself. Had I not seen it just when I did, I must      inevitably have come upon it soon after, since my telescope was so      perfect that I was able to distinguish it from a fixed star in the      first minute of observation.        \"Now to bring this sketch to a close. As the king had expressed a      desire to see my telescope, I took it by his command to Greenwich,      where it was compared with the instruments of my excellent friend,      Dr. MASKELYNE, not only by himself, but by other experts, who      pronounced it as their opinion that my instrument was superior to      all the rest. Thereupon the king ordered that the instrument be      brought to Windsor, and since it there met with marked approval, his      majesty graciously awarded me a yearly pension, that I might be      enabled to relinquish my profession of music, and devote my whole      time to astronomy and the improvement of the telescope. Gratitude,      as well as other considerations specified by me in a paper presented      to the Royal Society, of which I am a member, has induced me to call      the new planet _Georgium Sidus_.            \"'Georgium Sidus.--jam nunc assuesce vocari.'--(_Virgil._)        And I hope it will retain the name.\"    We know but little of the family of HERSCHEL. The name is undoubtedly  Jewish, and is found in Poland, Germany, and England. We learn that the  ancestors of the present branch left Moravia about the beginning of the  XVIIth century, on account of their change of religion to Protestantism.  They became possessors of land in Saxony. HANS HERSCHEL, the  great-grandfather of WILLIAM, was a brewer in Pirna (a small town near  Dresden). Of the two sons of HANS, one, ABRAHAM (born in 1651, died  1718), was employed in the royal gardens at Dresden, and seems to have  been a man of taste and skill in his calling. Of his eldest son,  EUSEBIUS, there appears to be little trace in the records of the family.

Two lads had crossed the sunny meadow-land of childhood and stood by the  gate, at the entrance to the rougher paths of youth leading up to the  grander heights of maturity. They glanced backward, but not with regret,  for their eyes shone with eagerness to climb the upward way. As they  waited, an angel came bearing a gift for each, which he gave them,  saying: \"I have brought you a wondrous gift, not for yourselves but for  others. Listen.\"    And they bent their heads and listened. And one said: \"I hear most  entrancing music. It thrills my very being. It is for me, for me.\"    But the angel said: \"Listen again. Shut your ears to those bewildering  tones and you will hear a deeper, holier strain.\"    But the youth said: \"No, I hear only that melody which speaks to my own  heart. I can hear nothing else.\"    The other youth too took the gift and, bending his head at the command  of the angel, said: \"I hear that sweet entrancing strain which speaks to  myself, and which promises me pleasure; but deeper than all that I hear  a tone soft, sweet and low, that sounds like the voices of happy  children, and of a mother singing to her babe.\"    The angel smiled. \"It is for them,\" he said, \"that you must keep your  gift. And in the years to come that music will be to you the sweetest in  the world.\"    So the youths started on their devious ways through the hilly land of  youth. There were bird-songs and flowers; there were bright paths, and  dark ones; there were sunny by-paths, which ended in dreamy forests;  there were pitfalls in unexpected places; there was often sorrow where  they looked for joy, and failure where they expected success. And the  one listened oft to the entrancing music of his angelic gift, and was  led to think only of himself, and his eye lost its fire, his feet often  stumbled, and the days and nights had no pleasure for him. As he reached  the heights of maturity he was met by a bright creature who laughed with  great joy when he offered her his love and said exultantly: \"I have kept  myself pure for you,\" and he, knowing his own dark secrets, could make  no reply but hung his head and was silent. And, thus silent, he heard no  more the bewildering music of his youth, but instead there came to his  ears the sound of a broken-hearted woman's sobs, and the weeping of  children mourning the birthright that had been lost for them in their  father's wayward youth. And the man said sighingly:        \"O that I had my innocence again      My untouched honor. But I wish in vain.\"    But the other lad turned a deaf ear to the brain-bewildering music and  listened with his soul for the happy melodies of the future. And his eye  grew brighter and his strength increased and his paths were straight and  clean, and as he neared the heights of maturity he was met by one whose  robe was shining in its brightness and who whispered: \"I have kept  myself pure for you.\"    And gladly he answered: \"And I for you;\" and so their lives became one,  and the melody of happy children's voices drew nearer and nearer, and  listening to the sweet voice of the mother singing to her babe, and  looking into the bright and rosy faces that with every glance and motion  thanked him for their dower of health and honor, he blessed the great  Creator from whom he had received the wondrous gift of potential  fatherhood, and gave thanks that he had wisely listened to the angel's  voice bidding him keep his gift for those whose life, in the years to  come, was to be his holiest possession.          ALMOST A MAN.    By Mary Wood-Allen, M. D.      \"Let me take your book of quotations, please.\"    \"Certainly, if I can find it. O, I remember. I let Susie Glenn take it.  No doubt I can find it in her desk.\"    As she spoke Miss Bell walked to the desk and, finding the desired book,  took possession of it. An open note dropped from it and fell upon the  floor. Picking it up Miss Bell read: \"My darling little sweetheart,\" and  glancing at the close saw the signature, \"Carl.\" Sending of notes in  school was forbidden, therefore Miss Bell had no compunction of  conscience in taking possession of this one, and, on the impulse of the  moment, read it aloud to Miss Lane, her fellow-teacher. It was not only  sentimental in tone but there were mysterious phrases which seemed to  hold a deep and sinful significance. The women looked at each other with  sorrowful faces.    \"What shall I do about it?\" asked Miss Bell.    \"What a depth of wickedness it reveals!\" exclaimed Miss Lane. \"Who would  have imagined that such a nice appearing boy as Carl Woodford could be  so base? And Susie Glenn too, such a shy, modest little creature as she  seems.\"    \"Do you suppose it is really as bad as it seems to us? Those expressions  which appear to indicate such--such almost criminal intimacy perhaps  they do not understand fully.\"    \"Don't you believe it,\" said Miss Lane. \"I tell you these children are  wiser in sin than we older people can imagine. That boy needs to be  whipped within an inch of his life, the little reprobate! I'd give him  such a lecture as would make his eyes open wide for once. I'd make him  understand that he'd better not let me catch him in such mischief again.  And I'd tell Mrs. Glenn about it so that she could punish Susie.\"    \"I really am afraid that the result would not be what we wish. Suppose  we go and talk it over with Dr. Barrett. Maybe she can tell us what to  do.\"    Dr. Barrett received the ladies with cordiality and professed herself  willing to aid them in the solution of their problem. She did not appear  as shocked as they did, and even smiled a little as Miss Lane, in  indignant tones, read aloud the offending note.    \"Don't you think that little rascal should be nearly annihilated?\" she  asked, turning to the Doctor.    \"I think he should be instructed,\" replied the latter. \"Will you send  him to me, Miss Bell?\"    \"Most gladly, but I don't believe he will come.\"    \"Yes he will, if you don't frighten him beforehand. Don't say a word to  him about the affair, but send him with a note to me and tell him to  wait for an answer.\"    The next evening Carl appeared at the Doctor's residence with the note  from Miss Bell. \"I am to wait for an answer,\" he said.    Dr. Barrett only nodded as she wrote on steadily for a moment, seeming  too much engrossed in her work to notice him. Then she read the note,  thought a moment, excused herself and left the room. Returning  immediately she said, \"It will be half an hour before the answer is  ready. Can you wait?\"    \"O certainly.\"    \"Then sit down here and look over the Youth's Companion while I finish  my letter.\"    For some moments there was silence and then the Doctor, laying down her  pen, turned to the boy and said, pleasantly; \"You are Carl Woodford, are  you not?\"    \"Yes, ma'am.\"    \"It has been so long since I saw you that you have almost grown out of  my knowledge. You are getting to be almost a man. You must be fifteen  years old.\"    \"Not quite. I will be next June.\"    \"Almost a man,\" said Dr. Barrett softly as she looked thoughtfully into  the fire. After a moment's silence she asked, \"Carl, what is it to be a  man?\"    The boy drew himself up with a self-conscious air as he replied.    \"Why, to have your growth, and get into business for yourself.\"    \"Well, that is not quite it,\" said the Doctor smiling, \"for I have my  growth and am in business for myself, and yet I am not a man.\"    \"Maybe it means having a mustache,\" said Carl, with a slight flush.    \"That has something to do with it certainly, but Mrs. Flynn has a  mustache, and she is not a man.\"    \"Well, I don't know how to explain it then,\" said Carl.    \"You have studied grammar, will you parse the word man?\"    \"Man is a common noun, masculine gender, third----\"    \"What does masculine gender mean?\"    \"It means male.\"    \"Then to be a man means to be a male. How does the grammar define  gender?\"    \"The distinction of nouns with regard to sex.\"    \"Have you studied physiology?\"    \"Yes'm.\"    \"Was it the physiology of man or woman?\"    \"Why, it didn't say anything but physiology.\"    \"You studied, then, only those organs in which men and women are alike,  as in their muscular and nervous systems, and in the organs of  digestion; in fact you learned only of the organs which are for the  preservation of the individual. You learned nothing of them in regard to  sex, which is termed special physiology.\"    A wave of color was creeping over Carl's face, seeing which the Doctor  said:    \"As you have never studied this special physiology supposing you try to  forget that any one has ever told you anything about it, and let us for  a few minutes talk of it as of God's laws. We believe God to be pure,  and we cannot believe that he would make a "]]]
