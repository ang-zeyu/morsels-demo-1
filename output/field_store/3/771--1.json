INTRODUCTORY MEMOIR.      If Toru Dutt were alive, she would still be younger than any recognized  European writer, and yet her fame, which is already considerable, has  been entirely posthumous. Within the brief space of four years which now  divides us from the date of her decease, her genius has been revealed to  the world under many phases, and has been recognized throughout France  and England. Her name, at least, is no longer unfamiliar in the ear of  any well-read man or woman. But at the hour of her death she had  published but one book, and that book had found but two reviewers in  Europe. One of these, M. Andre Theuriet, the well-known poet and  novelist, gave the \"Sheaf gleaned in French Fields\" adequate praise in  the \"Revue des Deux Mondes;\" but the other, the writer of the present  notice, has a melancholy satisfaction in having been a little earlier  still in sounding the only note of welcome which reached the dying  poetess from England. It was while Professor W. Minto was editor of the  \"Examiner,\" that one day in August, 1876, in the very heart of the dead  season for books, I happened to be in the office of that newspaper, and  was upbraiding the whole body of publishers for issuing no books worth  reviewing. At that moment the postman brought in a thin and sallow  packet with a wonderful Indian postmark on it, and containing a most  unattractive orange pamphlet of verse, printed at Bhowanipore, and  entitled \"A Sheaf gleaned in French Fields, by Toru Dutt.\" This shabby  little book of some two hundred pages, without preface or introduction,  seemed specially destined by its particular providence to find its way  hastily into the waste-paper basket. I remember that Mr. Minto thrust it  into my unwilling hands, and said \"There! see whether you can't make  something of that.\" A hopeless volume it seemed, with its queer type,  published at Bhowanipore, printed at the Saptahiksambad Press! But when  at last I took it out of my pocket, what was my surprise and almost  rapture to open at such verse as this:--        Still barred thy doors! The far east glows,        The morning wind blows fresh and free      Should not the hour that wakes the rose                Awaken also thee?        All look for thee, Love, Light, and Song,        Light in the sky deep red above,      Song, in the lark of pinions strong,                And in my heart, true Love.        Apart we miss our nature's goal,        Why strive to cheat our destinies?      Was not my love made for thy soul?        Thy beauty for mine eyes?              No longer sleep,                Oh, listen now!              I wait and weep,                But where art thou?    When poetry is as good as this it does not much matter whether Rouveyre  prints it upon Whatman paper, or whether it steals to light in blurred  type from some press in Bhowanipore.    Toru Dutt was the youngest of the three children of a high-caste Hindu  couple in Bengal. Her father, who survives them all, the Baboo Govin  Chunder Dutt, is himself distinguished among his countrymen for the  width of his views and the vigour of his intelligence. His only son,  Abju, died in 1865, at the age of fourteen, and left his two younger  sisters to console their parents. Aru, the elder daughter, born in 1854,  was eighteen months senior to Toru, the subject of this memoir, who was  born in Calcutta on the 4th of March, 1856. With the exception of one  year's visit to Bombay, the childhood of these girls was spent in  Calcutta, at their father's garden-house. In a poem now printed for the  first time, Toru refers to the scene of her earliest memories, the  circling wilderness of foliage, the shining tank with the round leaves  of the lilies, the murmuring dusk under the vast branches of the central  casuarina-tree. Here, in a mystical retirement more irksome to an  European in fancy than to an Oriental in reality, the brain of this  wonderful child was moulded. She was pure Hindu, full of the typical  qualities of her race and blood, and, as the present volume shows us for  the first time, preserving to the last her appreciation of the poetic  side of her ancient religion, though faith itself in Vishnu and Siva had  been cast aside with childish things and been replaced by a purer  faith. Her mother fed her imagination with the old songs and legends of  their people, stories which it was the last labour of her life to weave  into English verse; but it would seem that the marvellous faculties of  Toru's mind still slumbered, when, in her thirteenth year, her father  decided to take his daughters to Europe to learn English and French. To  the end of her days Toru was a better French than English scholar. She  loved France best, she knew its literature best, she wrote its language  with more perfect elegance. The Dutts arrived in Europe at the close of  1869, and the girls went to school, for the first and last time, at a  French pension. They did not remain there very many months; their father  took them to Italy and England with him, and finally they attended for a  short time, but with great zeal and application, the lectures for women  at Cambridge. In November, 1873, they went back again to Bengal, and  the four remaining years of Toru's life were spent in the old  garden-house at Calcutta, in a feverish dream of intellectual effort and  imaginative production. When we consider what she achieved in these  forty-five months of seclusion, it is impossible to wonder that the  frail and hectic body succumbed under so excessive a strain.    She brought with her from Europe a store of knowledge that would have  sufficed to make an English or French girl seem learned, but which in  her case was simply miraculous. Immediately on her return she began to  study Sanskrit with the same intense application which she gave to all  her work, and mastering the language with extraordinary swiftness, she  plunged into its mysterious literature. But she was born to write, and  despairing of an audience in her own language, she began to adopt ours  as a medium for her thought. Her first essay, published when she was  eighteen, was a monograph, in the \"Bengal Magazine,\" on Leconte de  Lisle, a writer with whom she had a sympathy which is very easy to  comprehend. The austere poet of \"La Mort de Valmiki\" was, obviously, a  figure to whom the poet of \"Sindhu\" must needs be attracted on  approaching European literature. This study, which was illustrated by  translations into English verse, was followed by another on Josephin  Soulary, in whom she saw more than her maturer judgment might have  justified. There is something very interesting and now, alas! still more  pathetic in these sturdy and workmanlike essays in unaided criticism.  Still more solitary her work became, in July, 1874, when her only  sister, Aru, died, at the age of twenty. She seems to have been no less  amiable than her sister, and if gifted with less originality and a less  forcible ambition, to have been finely accomplished. Both sisters were  well-trained musicians, with full contralto voices, and Aru had a  faculty for design which promised well. The romance of \"Mlle. D'Arvers\"  was originally projected for Aru to illustrate, but no page of this book  did Aru ever see.    In 1876, as we have said, appeared that obscure first volume at  Bhowanipore. The \"Sheaf gleaned in French Fields\" is certainly the most  imperfect of Toru's writings, but it is not the least interesting. It is  a wonderful mixture of strength and weakness, of genius overriding great  obstacles and of talent succumbing to ignorance and inexperience. That  it should have been performed at all is so extraordinary that we forget  to be surprised at its inequality. The English verse is sometimes  exquisite; at other times the rules of our prosody are absolutely  ignored, and it is obvious that the Hindu poetess was chanting to  herself a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23259"],[0,"Home Taxidermy for Pleasure and Profit (#1)"],[1,"(https://www.pgdp.net)        Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.
