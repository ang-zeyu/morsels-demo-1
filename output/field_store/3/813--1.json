FUNERAL AND BURIAL CUSTOMS,            364          I    CHILD LIFE      From the hour when the Puritan baby opened his eyes in bleak New England  he had a Spartan struggle for life. In summer-time he fared  comparatively well, but in winter the ill-heated houses of the colonists  gave to him a most chilling and benumbing welcome. Within the great open  fireplace, when fairly scorched in the face by the glowing flames of the  roaring wood fire, he might be bathed and dressed, and he might be  cuddled and nursed in warmth and comfort; but all his baby hours could  not be spent in the ingleside, and were he carried four feet away from  the chimney on a raw winter's day he found in his new home a temperature  that would make a modern infant scream with indignant discomfort, or lie  stupefied with cold.    Nor was he permitted even in the first dismal days of his life to stay  peacefully within-doors. On the Sunday following his birth he was  carried to the meeting-house to be baptized. When we consider the chill  and gloom of those unheated, freezing churches, growing colder and  damper and deadlier with every wintry blast--we wonder that grown  persons even could bear the exposure. Still more do we marvel that  tender babes ever lived through their cruel winter christenings when it  is recorded that the ice had to be broken in the christening bowl. In  villages and towns where the houses were all clustered around the  meeting-house the baby Puritans did not have to be carried far to be  baptized; but in country parishes, where the dwelling-houses were widely  scattered, it might be truthfully recorded of many a chrisom-child:  \"Died of being baptized.\" One cruel parson believed in and practised  infant immersion, fairly a Puritan torture, until his own child nearly  lost its life thereby.    Dressed in fine linen and wrapped in a hand-woven christening blanket--a  \"bearing-cloth\"--the unfortunate young Puritan was carried to church in  the arms of the midwife, who was a person of vast importance and dignity  as well as of service in early colonial days, when families of from  fifteen to twenty children were quite the common quota. At the altar the  baby was placed in his proud father's arms, and received his first cold  and disheartening reception into the Puritan Church. In the pages of  Judge Samuel Sewall's diary, to which alone we can turn for any definite  or extended contemporary picture of colonial life in Puritan New  England, as for knowledge of England of that date we turn to the diaries  of Evelyn and Pepys, we find abundant proof that inclemency of weather  was little heeded when religious customs and duties were in question.  On January 22d, 1694, Judge Sewall thus records:         \"A very extraordinary Storm by reason of the falling and driving of       the Snow. Few women could get to Meeting. A child named Alexander       was baptized in the afternoon.\"    He does not record Alexander's death in sequence. He writes thus of the  baptism of a four days' old child of his own on February 6th, 1656:         \"Between 3 & 4 P.M. Mr. Willard baptizeth my Son whom I named       Stephen. Day was louring after the storm but not freezing. Child       shrank at the water but Cry'd not. His brother Sam shew'd the       Midwife who carried him the way to the Pew. I held him up.\"    And still again on April 8th, 1677, of another of his children when but  six days old:         \"Sabbath day, rainy and stormy in the morning but in the afternoon       fair and sunshine though with a Blustering Wind. So Eliz. Weeden       the Midwife brought the Infant to the Third Church when Sermon was       about half done in the Afternoon.\"    Poor little Stephen and Hull and Joseph, shrinking away from the icy  water, but too benumbed to cry! Small wonder that they quickly yielded  up their souls after the short struggle for life so gloomily and so  coldly begun. Of Judge Sewall's fourteen children but three survived  him, a majority dying in infancy; and of fifteen children of his friend  Cotton Mather but two survived their father.    This religious ordeal was but the initial step in the rigid system of  selection enforced by every detail of the manner of life in early New  England. The mortality among infants was appallingly large; and the  natural result--the survival of the fittest--may account for the present  tough endurance of the New England people.    Nor was the christening day the only Lord's Day when the baby graced the  meeting-house. Puritan mothers were all church lovers and strict  church-goers, and all the members of the household were equally  church-attending; and if the mother went to meeting the baby had to go  also. I have heard of a little wooden cage or frame in the meeting-house  to hold Puritan babies who were too young, or feeble, or sleepy to sit  upright.    Of the dress of these Puritan infants we know but little. Linen formed  the chilling substructure of their attire--little, thin, linen,  short-sleeved, low-necked shirts. Some of them have been preserved, and  with their tiny rows of hemstitching and drawn work and the narrow edges  of thread-lace are pretty and dainty even at the present day. At the  rooms of the Essex Institute in Salem may be seen the shirt and mittens  of Governor Bradford's infancy. The ends of the stiff, little, linen  mittens have evidently been worn off by the active friction of baby  fingers and then been replaced by patches of red and white cheney or  calico. The gowns are generally rather shapeless, large-necked sacks of  linen or dimity, made and embroidered, of course, entirely by hand, and  drawn into shape by narrow, cotton ferret or linen bobbin. In summer and  winter the baby's head was always closely covered with a cap, or  \"biggin\" often warmly wadded, which was more comforting in winter than  comfortable in summer.    The seventeenth century baby slept, as does his nineteenth century  descendant, in a cradle, frequently made of heavy panelled or carved  wood, and always deeply hooded to protect him from the constant drafts.  Twins had cradles with hoods at both ends. Judge Sewall paid sixteen  shillings for a wicker cradle for one of his many children. The baby was  carried upstairs, when first moved, with silver and gold in his hand to  bring him wealth and cause him always to rise in the world, just as  babies are carried upstairs by superstitious nurses nowadays, and he had  \"scarlet laid on his head to keep him from harm.\" He was dosed with  various nostrums that held full sway in the nursery even until Federal  days, \"Daffy's Elixir\" being perhaps the most widely known, and hence  the most widely harmful. It was valuable enough (in one sense of the  word) to be sharply fought over in old England in Queen Anne's time, and  to have its disputed ownership the cause of many lawsuits.  Advertisements of it frequently appear in the _Boston News Letter_ and  other New England newspapers of early date.    The most common and largely dosed diseases of early infancy were, I  judge from contemporary records, to use the plain terms of the times,  worms, rickets, and fits. Curiously enough, Sir Thomas Browne, in the  latter part of the seventeenth century, wrote of the rickets as a new  disease, scarce so old as to afford good observation, and wondered  whether it existed in the American plantations. In old medical books  which were used by the New England colonists I find manifold receipts  for the cure of these infantile diseases. Snails form the basis, or  rather the chief ingredient, of many of these medicines. Indeed, I  should fancy that snails must have been almost exterminated in the near  vicinity of towns, so largely were they sought for and employed  medicinally. There are several receipts for making snail-water, or  snail-pottage; here is one of the most pleasing ones:         \"The admirable and most famous Snail water.--Take a peck of garden       Shel Snails, wash them well in Small Beer, and put them in an oven       till they have done making a Noise, then take them out and wipe       them well from the green froth that is upon them, and bruise them       shels and all in a Stone Mortar, then take a Quart of Earthworms,       scowre them with salt, slit them, and wash well with water from       their filth, and in a stone Mortar beat them in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24186"],[0,"Zionism and Anti-Semitism (#1)"],[1,"was produced from scanned images of public domain  material from the Google Print project.)

People are generally aware that it describes an idea and a movement  that in the last years has found numerous adherents among the Jews of  all countries, but especially among those of the East. Comparatively  few, however, both among the Gentiles and the Jews themselves, have a  perfectly clear notion of the aims and ways of Zionism; the Gentiles,  because they do not care sufficiently for Jewish affairs to take the  trouble to inform themselves at first hand as to the particulars; the  Jews, because they are intentionally led astray by the enemies of  Zionism, by lies and calumnies, or because even among the fervent  Zionists there are not many who have probed the whole Zionist idea to  the bottom, and are willing or able to present it in a clear and  comprehensible fashion, without exaggeration and polemical heat.    I will endeavor to furnish readers of good faith, who are not biased,  and have no other interest than that of gaining authentic information  about a phenomenon in contemporary history, as concisely and soberly  as possible with all the facts, as they really are, not as they are  reflected in muddled brains, or distorted and falsified by  calumniators.      I.    Zionism is a new word for a very old object, in so far as it merely  expresses the yearning of the Jewish people for Zion. Since the  destruction of the second temple by Titus, since the dispersion of the  Jewish nation in all countries, this people has not ceased to long  intensely, and hope fervently, for the return to the lost land of  their fathers. This yearning for, and hope in, Zion on the part of the  Jews was the concrete, I might say, the geographical, aspect of their  Messianic faith, which in its turn forms an essential part of their  religion.    Messianism and Zionism were really, for nearly two thousand years,  identical conceptions, and without caviling and hair-splitting  interpretation, it would not be easy to make a distinction between the  prayers for the appearance of the promised Messiah, and those for the  not less promised return to the historical home,--both of which stand  side by side on every page of the Jewish liturgy. These prayers were,  until a few generations ago, meant literally by every Jew, as they  still are by the simple believing Jews. The Jews had no other idea  than that they were a people which as a punishment for its sins had  lost the land of its forefathers, which was condemned to live as  strangers in strange lands, and whose great sufferings would first  cease when it was again assembled on the consecrated soil of the Holy  Land.    This gradually changed about the middle of the eighteenth century,  when enlightenment first began to find its way into Jewdom, in the  person of its first herald, Moses Mendelssohn, the popular  philosopher. The faith of the Jews became more lukewarm; the educated  classes, where they did not simply convert themselves to Christianism,  began to regard the doctrines of their religion in a rationalist  manner; for them the dispersion of the Jewish people was a final and  unalterable fact; they emptied the conception of the Messiah and of  Zion of every concrete meaning, and arranged for themselves a singular  doctrine, according to which the Zion promised to the Jews was to be  understood only in a spiritual sense, as the setting up of the Jewish  monotheism in the whole world, as the future triumph of Jewish ethics  over the less sublime and less noble moral teaching of the other  nations. An American rabbi reduced this conception to the striking  formula, \"Our Zion is in Washington.\" The Mendelssohn teaching  logically developed in the first half of the nineteenth century into  the \"Reform,\" which deliberately broke with Zionism. For the Reform  Jew, the word Zion had just as little meaning as the word dispersion.  He does not feel himself in any diaspora. He denies that there is a  Jewish people and that he is a member of it. He desires only to belong  to the people in whose midst he lives. For him Judaism is a purely  religious conception which has nothing whatever to do with  nationality. The land of his birth is his fatherland, and he will know  of no other. The idea of a return to Palestine excites him either to  indignation or to laughter. He answers it with the well-known, silly,  would-be witticism, \"If the Jewish state is again set up in Palestine,  I will ask to be its ambassador in Paris.\"    The thinking Jew did not fail, however, to perceive, in the course of  time, that Reform Judaism is a half measure, a compromise, which like  every compromise, contains the germ of destruction, as it cannot for  one instant resist logical criticism. Whom shall the Reform Judaism  satisfy? The believing Jew? He rejects it with the greatest  abhorrence. The unbelieving Jew? He despises it as hypocrisy and  phrase-mongering. The Jew who really desires to break with his  national past and to be absorbed by his Christian surroundings? For  that Jew, Reform Judaism does not suffice; he goes a step farther, the  step that leads to the baptismal font. Still less does it satisfy the  Jew who desires to guard Jewdom against destruction and to preserve it  as an ethnical individuality. For to him an openly expressed  abandonment of all national aspirations is synonymous with a  self-condemnation of the Jewish people to a perhaps slow, but sure,  death. Reform Judaism without Zionism, that is to say, without the  wish and the hope for a reassembling of the Jewish people, has no  future. At the best, it can only be regarded as a somewhat crooked  path that leads to Christianity. He who desires to reach that goal can  find straighter and shorter routes.      II.    And so it has come about that the generations which had been under the  influence of the Mendelssohnian rhetoric and enlightenment, of reform  and assimilation, have, in the last twenty years of the nineteenth  century, been followed by a new generation which seeks to take up a  standpoint other than the traditional towards the question of Zion.  These new Jews shrug their shoulders at that twaddle which has been  the fashion among rabbis and _literati_ for the last hundred years,  and which boasts of a \"Mission of Jewdom,\" said to consist in this,  that the Jews must live forever in dispersion among the peoples in  order to act as their teachers and models of morality, and to educate  them gradually to pure rationalism, to a general brotherhood of  mankind, and to an ideal cosmopolitanism. They declare the mission  swagger to be either presumption or foolishness. They, more modest and  more practical, demand only the right for the Jewish people to live  and to develop itself, according to its abilities, up to the natural  limits of its type. They have become convinced that this is not  possible in dispersion, as, under that condition, prejudice, hatred,  and contempt continually follow and oppress them, and either stint  their development, or force them to an ethnical mimicry which  necessarily makes of them, instead of original types with a right to  existence, mediocre or bad copies of foreign models. They therefore  work methodically with a view to rendering the Jewish people once more  a normal one, which lives on its own soil, and accomplishes all  economical, intellectual, moral, and political functions of a  civilized nation.    The goal cannot be reached at once. It lies in a future more or less  near. It is an ideal, a desire, a hope, as the Messianic Zionism was  and is. The new Zionism, which has been called the political one,  differs, however, from the old, the religious, the Messianic one, in  this,--that it disavows all mysticism, no longer identifies itself  with Messianism, and does not expect the return to Palestine to be  brought about by a miracle, but desires to prepare the way by its own  efforts.    The new Zionism has grown in part only out of the internal impulsions  of Judaism itself, out of the enthusiasm of modern educated Jews for  their history and martyrology, out of the awakened consciousness of  their racial qualities, out of their ambition to save the ancient  blood, in view of the farthest possible future, and to add to the  achievements of their forefathers the achievements of their posterity.    On the other hand, Zionism is the effect of two impulses which came  from without,--first, the principle of nationality, which for half a  century ruled thought and feeling in Europe, and governed the politics  of the world; secondly, Anti-Semitism, from which the Jews of all  countries have more or less to suffer.    The principle of nationality has awakened self-consciousness in all  the peoples; it teaches them to regard their peculiarities as  qualities, and gives them a passionate desire for independence. It  could not, therefore, pass over the educated Jews without leaving a  trace. It induced them to remember who and what they are; to feel  themselves, what they had unlearned, a people apart; and to demand for  themselves a normal national destiny.
