A quarter of a century's experience in frontier life, a great portion  of which has been occupied in exploring the interior of our continent,  and in long marches where I have been thrown exclusively upon my own  resources, far beyond the bounds of the populated districts, and where  the traveler must vary his expedients to surmount the numerous  obstacles which the nature of the country continually reproduces, has  shown me under what great disadvantages the \"_voyageur_\" labors for  want of a timely initiation into those minor details of prairie-craft,  which, however apparently unimportant in the abstract, are sure, upon  the plains, to turn the balance of success for or against an  enterprise.    This information is so varied, and is derived from so many different  sources, that I still find every new expedition adds substantially to  my practical knowledge, and am satisfied that a good Prairie Manual  will be for the young traveler an addition to his equipment of  inappreciable value.    With such a book in his hand, he will be able, in difficult circumstances,  to avail himself of the matured experience of veteran travelers, and  thereby avoid many otherwise unforeseen disasters; while, during the  ordinary routine of marching, he will greatly augment the sum of his  comforts, avoid many serious losses, and enjoy a comparative exemption  from doubts and anxieties. He will feel himself a master spirit in the  wilderness he traverses, and not the victim of every _new_ combination  of circumstances which nature affords or fate allots, as if to try his  skill and prowess.    I have waited for several years, with the confident expectation that  some one more competent than myself would assume the task, and give the  public the desired information; but it seems that no one has taken  sufficient interest in the subject to disseminate the benefits of his  experience in this way. Our frontier-men, although brave in council and  action, and possessing an intelligence that quickens in the face of  danger, are apt to feel shy of the pen. They shun the atmosphere of the  student's closet; their sphere is in the free and open wilderness. It  is not to be wondered at, therefore, that to our veteran borderer the  field of literature should remain a \"_terra incognita_.\" It is our  army that unites the chasm between the culture of civilization in the  aspect of science, art, and social refinement, and the powerful  simplicity of nature. On leaving the Military Academy, a majority of  our officers are attached to the line of the army, and forthwith  assigned to duty upon our remote and extended frontier, where the  restless and warlike habits of the nomadic tribes render the soldier's  life almost as unsettled as that of the savages themselves.    A regiment is stationed to-day on the borders of tropical Mexico;  to-morrow, the war-whoop, borne on a gale from the northwest, compels  its presence in the frozen latitudes of Puget's Sound. The very limited  numerical strength of our army, scattered as it is over a vast area of  territory, necessitates constant changes of stations, long and toilsome  marches, a promptitude of action, and a tireless energy and  self-reliance, that can only be acquired through an intimate  acquaintance with the sphere in which we act and move.    The education of our officers at the Military Academy is doubtless well  adapted to the art of civilized warfare, but can not familiarize them  with the diversified details of border service; and they often, at the  outset of their military career, find themselves compelled to improvise  new expedients to meet novel emergences.    The life of the wilderness is an _art_ as well as that of the city  or court, and every art subjects its votaries to discipline in  preparing them for a successful career in its pursuit. The Military  Art, as enlarged to meet all the requirements of border service, the  savage in his wiles or the elements in their caprices, embraces many  other special arts which have hitherto been almost ignored, and results  which experience and calculation should have guaranteed have been  improvidently staked upon favorable chances.    The main object at which I have aimed in the following pages has been  to explain and illustrate, as clearly and succinctly as possible, the  best methods of performing the duties devolving upon the prairie  traveler, so as to meet their contingencies under all circumstances,  and thereby to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23104"],[0,"The Blue Tower (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net              THE    BLUE    TOWER        By EVELYN E. SMITH        _As the vastly advanced guardians  of mankind, the Belphins knew how  to make a lesson stick--but whom?_        Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS          Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy, February,  1958.

Ludovick Eversole sat in the golden sunshine outside his house, writing  a poem as he watched the street flow gently past him. There were very  few people on it, for he lived in a slow part of town, and those who  went in for travel generally preferred streets where the pace was  quicker.    Moreover, on a sultry spring afternoon like this one, there would be  few people wandering abroad. Most would be lying on sun-kissed white  beaches or in sun-drenched parks, or, for those who did not fancy being  either kissed or drenched by the sun, basking in the comfort of their  own air-conditioned villas.    Some would, like Ludovick, be writing poems; others composing  symphonies; still others painting pictures. Those who were without  creative talent or the inclination to indulge it would be relaxing  their well-kept golden bodies in whatever surroundings they had chosen  to spend this particular one of the perfect days that stretched in an  unbroken line before every member of the human race from the cradle to  the crematorium.    Only the Belphins were much in evidence. Only the Belphins had duties  to perform. Only the Belphins worked.    Ludovick stretched his own well-kept golden body and rejoiced in the  knowing that he was a man and not a Belphin. Immediately afterward,  he was sorry for the heartless thought. Didn't the Belphins work only  to serve humanity? How ungrateful, then, it was to gloat over them!  Besides, he comforted himself, probably, if the truth were known, the  Belphins _liked_ to work. He hailed a passing Belphin for assurance on  this point.    Courteous, like all members of his species, the creature leaped from  the street and listened attentively to the young man's question. \"We  Belphins have but one like and one dislike,\" he replied. \"We like what  is right and we dislike what is wrong.\"    \"But how can you tell what is right and what is wrong?\" Ludovick  persisted.    \"We _know_,\" the Belphin said, gazing reverently across the city to  the blue spire of the tower where The Belphin of Belphins dwelt, in  constant communication with every member of his race at all times,  or so they said. \"That is why we were placed in charge of humanity.  Someday you, too, may advance to the point where you _know_, and we  shall return whence we came.\"    \"But _who_ placed you in charge,\" Ludovick asked, \"and whence _did_  you come?\" Fearing he might seem motivated by vulgar curiosity, he  explained, \"I am doing research for an epic poem.\"                         *      *      *      *      *    A lifetime spent under their gentle guardianship had made Ludovick  able to interpret the expression that flitted across this Belphin's  frontispiece as a sad, sweet smile.    \"We come from beyond the stars,\" he said. Ludovick already knew that;  he had hoped for something a little more specific. \"We were placed in  power by those who had the right. And the power through which we rule  is the power of love! Be happy!\"    And with that conventional farewell (which also served as a greeting),  he stepped onto the sidewalk and was borne off. Ludovick looked after  him pensively for a moment, then shrugged. Why _should_ the Belphins  surrender their secrets to gratify the idle curiosity of a poet?    Ludovick packed his portable scriptwriter in its case and went to call  on the girl next door, whom he loved with a deep and intermittently  requited passion.    As he passed between the tall columns leading into the Flockhart  courtyard, he noted with regret that there were quite a number of  Corisande's relatives present, lying about sunning themselves and  sipping beverages which probably touched the legal limit of  intoxicatability.    Much as he hated to think harshly of anyone, he did not like Corisande  Flockhart's relatives. He had never known anybody who had as many  relatives as she did, and sometimes he suspected they were not all  related to her. Then he would dismiss the thought as unworthy of him or  any right-thinking human being. He loved Corisande for herself alone  and not for her family. Whether they were actually her family or not  was none of his business.    \"Be happy!\" he greeted the assemblage cordially, sitting down beside  Corisande on the tessellated pavement.    \"Bah!\" said old Osmond Flockhart, Corisande's grandfather. Ludovick was  sure that, underneath his crustiness, the gnarled patriarch hid a heart  of gold. Although he had been mining assiduously, the young man had not  yet been able to strike that vein; however, he did not give up hope,  for not giving up hope was one of the principles that his wise old  Belphin teacher had inculcated in him. Other principles were to lead  the good life and keep healthy.    \"Now, Grandfather,\" Corisande said, \"no matter what your politics, that  does not excuse impoliteness.\"    Ludovick wished she would not allude so blatantly to politics, because  he had a lurking notion that Corisande's \"family\" was, in fact, a band  of conspirators ... such as still dotted the green and pleasant planet  and proved by their existence that Man was not advancing anywhere  within measurable distance of that totality of knowledge implied by  the Belphin.    You could tell malcontents, even if they did not voice their  dissatisfactions, by their faces. The vast majority of the human race,  living good and happy lives, had smooth and pleasant faces. Malcontents'  faces were lined and sometimes, in extreme cases, furrowed. Everyone  could easily tell who they were by looking at them, and most people  avoided them.                         *      *      *      *      *    It was not that griping was illegal, for the Belphins permitted free  speech and reasonable conspiracy; it was that such behavior was  considered ungenteel. Ludovick would never have dreamed of associating  with this set of neighbors, once he had discovered their tendencies,  had he not lost his heart to the purple-eyed Corisande at their first  meeting.    \"Politeness, bah!\" old Osmond said. \"To see a healthy young man  simply--simply accepting the status quo!\"    \"If the status quo is a good status quo,\" Ludovick said uneasily, for  he did not like to discuss such subjects, \"why should I not accept it?  We have everything we could possibly want. What do we lack?\"    \"Our freedom,\" Osmond retorted.    \"But we _are_ free,\" Ludovick said, perplexed. \"We can say what we  like, do what we like, so long as it is consonant with the public  good.\"    \"Ah, but who determines what is consonant with the public good?\"    Ludovick could no longer temporize with truth, even for Corisande's  sake. \"Look here, old man, I have read books. I know about the old days  before the Belphins came from the stars. Men were destroying themselves  quickly through wars, or slowly through want. There is none of that any  more.\"    \"All lies and exaggeration,\" old Osmond said. \"_My_ grandfather told me  that, when the Belphins took over Earth, they rewrote all the textbooks  to suit their own purposes. Now nothing but Belphin propaganda is  taught in the schools.\"    \"But surely some of what they teach about the past must be true,\"  Ludovick insisted. \"And today every one of us has enough to eat and  drink, a place to live, beautiful garments to wear, and all the time in  the world to utilize as he chooses in all sorts of pleasant activities.  What is missing?\"    \"They've taken away our frontiers!\"    Behind his back, Corisande made a little filial face at Ludovick.    Ludovick tried to make the old man see reason. \"But I'm happy. And  everybody is happy, except--except a few _killjoys_ like you.\"    \"They certainly did a good job of brainwashing you, boy,\" Osmond  sighed. \"And of most of the young ones,\" he added mournfully. \"With  each succeeding generation, more of our heritage is lost.\" He patted  the girl's hand. \"You're a good girl, Corrie. You don't hold with this  being cared for like some damn pet poodle.\"    \"Never mind Osmond, Eversole,\" one of Corisande's alleged uncles  grinned. \"He talks a lot, but of course he doesn't mean a quarter of  what he says. Come, have some wine.\"                         *      *      *      *      *    He handed a glass to Ludovick. Ludovick sipped and coughed. It tasted  as if it were well above the legal alcohol limit, but he didn't like to  say anything. They were taking an awful risk, though, doing a thing  like that. If they got caught, they might receive a public  scolding--which was, of course, no more than they deserved--but he  could not bear to think of Corisande exposed to such an ordeal.    \"It's only reasonable,\" the uncle went on, \"that older people should  have a--a thing about being governed by foreigners.\"    Ludovick smiled and set his nearly full glass down on a plinth. \"You  could hardly call the Belphins foreigners; they've been on Earth longer  than even the oldest of us.\"    \"You seem to be pretty chummy with 'em,\" the uncle said, looking  narrow-eyed at Ludovick.    \"No more so than any other loyal citizen,\" Ludovick replied.    The uncle sat up and wrapped his arms around his thick bare legs. He  was a powerful, hairy brute of a creature who had not taken advantage  of the numerous cosmetic techniques offered by the benevolent Belphins.  \"Don't you think it's funny they can breathe our air so easily?\"    \"Why shouldn't they?\" Ludovick bit into an apple that Corisande handed  him from one of the dishes of fruit and other delicacies strewn about  the courtyard. \"It's"]]]
