If I had been guided by my judgment alone it is not probable that  these notes of the debates in the Conference, held upon the invitation  of Virginia, at Washington, in the month of February, 1861, would have  been made public. From the commencement of its sessions, a portion of  the members were in favor of the daily publication of the proceedings.  I was disposed to go farther and have the sessions open to the public;  but this proposition was opposed by a large majority. Strong reasons  were urged for excluding the multitude which in the excitement of the  time would have thronged the hall wherein the Conference held its  sessions. But these reasons did not apply to the publication of the  debates, and a considerable minority were strongly of opinion that the  people should be informed daily, of the votes and remarks of their  representatives in that body.    I commenced taking notes on the first day of the session. For the  first few days, and until the reports were presented from the general  committee, there was but little discussion, and that related to  questions incidental to the general subject. On the 15th of February,  and before the committee reported, Mr. ORTH offered a resolution  authorizing the admission of reporters, which, after some discussion,  by a close vote was laid upon the table. On the 18th, finding the  labor of taking notes greater than I had anticipated, and desiring  that a complete record should be preserved; I introduced a resolution  providing for the appointment of an official stenographer, who should  report the proceedings and hold them subject to the order of the  Conference. I urged the adoption of this resolution as strenuously as  was proper, but the feeling of the majority appeared to be still  adverse to its passage, and it shared the fate of its predecessor. I  then revised the notes already taken, and finding them more complete  than I had anticipated, determined to make as accurate a report as I  was able of the general discussion. I could not then anticipate  whether such a report would be useful to the country or not; but I  thought if the Conference should propose amendments to the  Constitution, and these should be ultimately submitted to the States  for adoption, a knowledge of the motives and reasons which influenced  the action of the Conference as well as the construction which the  members gave to the propositions themselves, might become of as great  importance as the same subjects were in the convention which framed  the present Constitution. I attended every session of the Conference,  and, so far as my strength would permit, made as full and accurate  notes as I could, both of the action of the Conference and the  observations of its members.    These notes were carefully examined and revised immediately after the  close of each daily session. After the passage of the resolution  introduced by Mr. BARRINGER, removing the injunction of secrecy and  authorizing their publication, I determined to write them out for the  press. I was engaged in this work when the rebellion commenced, and  was shortly after called to the performance of the duties of an  official position, which for many months left me no leisure for other  employments.    My notes were then laid aside. As it was known by every member of the  Conference that I had taken them, I was often pressed to permit  selections from them to be made. These requests I invariably declined,  as I desired the publication, if made at all, to be entire, as well as  accurate. As time passed, these appeals became more frequent and  pressing, and claims were made in relation to the course of several of  the members which could only be sustained or refuted by a publication  of their remarks. At length I was earnestly requested to write out one  of these speeches, and after some weeks of delay consented to do so.    After the publication of this speech, which took place about the time  of the fall elections of 1863, previous to which the action of the  Conference had been much discussed, the desire to see a full report of  the proceedings of that body appeared to be excited anew. Letters and  personal interviews upon this subject became very numerous. I finally  determined to take the advice of a number of gentlemen who were  prominent in the convention and the country, as to the propriety of  yielding to this desire, and to be guided by it. I did so, and found  among them a remarkable unanimity of expression in favor of making the  history of the Conference public.    When this question was settled, I desired to avail myself of every  opportunity to secure the highest degree of accuracy and fidelity. I  addressed notes to such of the members as were accessible, asking them  to transmit to me such memoranda of the proceedings of the Conference  as they had preserved. The response to these letters was very  gratifying; not because the materials furnished were very full, but  because so general a purpose was shown by all the members thus  addressed, to furnish me every facility and aid in their power.    I have found much difficulty in determining what control each member  ought to be permitted to exercise over his own remarks. The most  agreeable course to me would have been, to have written out each  speech and submitted it to its author for correction or revision; but  to this there was a decisive objection. It would have depreciated, if  not destroyed, the accuracy of the report. Although I do not believe  that any gentleman would have been tempted to change the tenor of his  remarks by subsequent events, the view of the public might not have  been so charitable.    I have therefore made my own notes the standard of authority, and have  admitted nothing into the report which has not been justified by them  aided by my own recollection. The manuscript has not been changed or  added to, except by my own hands. The few instances in which I have  availed myself of the materials furnished by others, are distinctly  stated either in the notes or the appendix.    During the sessions of the Conference I was able to secure but little  practical assistance from the members. Although many of them desired  that my purpose should be accomplished, and some were taking brief and  general notes, I soon discovered that an accurate report of a speech  required an amount of labor and a degree of attention to the subject,  which few gentlemen were inclined to give. The work, therefore, was  thrown almost exclusively upon myself. Some idea of its amount and  severity may be formed when it is stated, that the sessions usually  commenced at about ten o'clock in the morning, and with a brief  intermission were continued late in the evening, in one instance as  late as the hour of two o'clock, A.M. The necessity of these long  daily sessions, arose from the fact, that the Congress then in  existence terminated on the fourth of March, and but few days  remained in which to discuss and perfect the report, and to submit it  to that body for its action.    I do not claim to have furnished a _verbatim_ report of the speeches  delivered in the Conference of 1861, but I insist that I have given an  accurate account of all its official proceedings, and the substance of  the remarks made in the course of those proceedings. I think, also,  that I have preserved nearly all the propositions made in the course  of the debate, and generally have presented the ideas in the very  language used. The gentlemen who have critically examined the report,  all concur upon the question of its general accuracy, and I am content  in this respect to rely upon their testimony.    I have suggested these considerations simply by way of explanation,  and not for the purpose of avoiding criticism. I have endeavored to  follow, so far as was in my power, the example of the illustrious  Reporter of the Constitutional Convention of 1787; and while my notes  lack the beauty and felicity which characterize his, I trust they are  not less full and accurate. I submit them to the country as the best  contribution which I can make to its history, at a most important and  interesting period of our national existence.    The three short years which have passed since the Conference of 1861,  have witnessed singular vicissitudes among its members. Many of them  have entered into the military or civil service of the country, or of  the rebellion which it was the avowed purpose of some members of that  Conference to nourish into vigorous life. Death, also, has been busy  with the roll. BALDWIN, BRONSON, SMITH, WOLCOTT, TYLER, and CLAY, are  no more. ZOLLICOFFER fell at the head of a rebel army.

First Indian Edition 1974    Printed in India at Deluxe Offset Press, Daya Basti, Delhi-110035 and  Published by Seema Publications, Delhi-110007.          EDITOR'S PREFACE      In his opening chapter Sir James Douie refers to the fact that the area  treated in this volume--just one quarter of a million square miles--is  comparable to that of Austria-Hungary. The comparison might be extended;  for on ethnographical, linguistic and physical grounds, the geographical  unit now treated is just as homogeneous in composition as the Dual  Monarchy. It is only in the political sense and by force of the ruling  classes, temporarily united in one monarch, that the term  _Osterreichisch_ could be used to include the Poles of Galicia, the  Czechs of Bohemia and Moravia, the Szeklers, Saxons and more numerous  Rumanians of Transylvania, the Croats, Slovenes and Italians of  \"Illyria,\" with the Magyars of the Hungarian plain.    The term _Punjabi_ much more nearly, but still imperfectly, covers the  people of the Panjab, the North-West Frontier Province, Kashmir and the  associated smaller Native States. The Sikh, Muhammadan and Hindu Jats,  the Kashmiris and the Rajputs all belong to the tall, fair, leptorrhine  Indo-Aryan main stock of the area, merging on the west and south-west  into the Biluch and Pathan Turko-Iranian, and fringed in the hill  districts on the north with what have been described as products of the  \"contact metamorphism\" with the Mongoloid tribes of Central Asia. Thus,  in spite of the inevitable blurring of boundary lines, the political  divisions treated together in this volume, form a fairly clean-cut  geographical unit.    Sir James Douie, in this work, is obviously living over again the happy  thirty-five years which he devoted to the service of North-West India:  his accounts of the physiography, the flora and fauna, the people and  the administration are essentially the personal recollections of one who  has first studied the details as a District Officer and has afterwards  corrected his perspective, stage by stage, from the successively higher  view-point of a Commissioner, the Chief Secretary, Financial  Commissioner, and finally as Officiating Lieut.-Governor. No one could  more appropriately undertake the task of an accurate and  well-proportioned thumb-nail sketch of North-West India and, what is  equally important to the earnest reader, no author could more obviously  delight in his subject.

Except where otherwise  stated the numerous maps included in the volume are derived from this  source. My obligations to provincial and district gazetteers have been  endless. Sir Thomas Holdich kindly allowed me to reproduce some of the  charts in his excellent book on _India_. The accuracy of the sections on  geology and coins may be relied on, as they were written by masters of  these subjects, Sir Thomas Holland and Mr R. B. Whitehead, I.C.S.  Chapter XVII could not have been written at all without the help  afforded by Mr Vincent Smith's _Early History of India_.
