It is all settled at last, and in another week I shall have left  Thrush Hill. I am a little bit sorry and a great bit glad. I am going  to Montreal to spend the winter with Alicia.    Alicia--it used to be plain Alice when she lived at Thrush Hill and  made her own dresses and trimmed her own hats--is my half-sister. She  is eight years older than I am. We are both orphans, and Aunt  Elizabeth brought us up here at Thrush Hill, the most delightful old  country place in the world, half smothered in big willows and poplars,  every one of which I have climbed in the early tomboy days of gingham  pinafores and sun-bonnets.    When Alicia was eighteen she married Roger Gresham, a man of forty.  The world said that she married him for his money. I dare say she did.  Alicia was tired of poverty.    I don't blame her. Very likely I shall do the same thing one of these  days, if I get the chance--for I too am tired of poverty.    When Alicia went to Montreal she wanted to take me with her, but I  wanted to be outdoors, romping in the hay or running wild in the woods  with Jack.    Jack Willoughby--Dr. John H. Willoughby, it reads on his office  door--was the son of our nearest neighbour. We were chums always, and  when he went away to college I was heartbroken.    The vacations were the only joy of my life then.    I don't know just when I began to notice a change in Jack, but when he  came home two years ago, a full-fledged M.D.--a great, tall,  broad-shouldered fellow, with the sweetest moustache, and lovely thick  black hair, just made for poking one's fingers through--I realized it  to the full. Jack was grown up. The dear old days of bird-nesting and  nutting and coasting and fishing and general delightful goings-on were  over forever.    I was sorry at first. I wanted \"Jack.\" \"Dr. Willoughby\" seemed too  distinguished and far away.    I suppose he found a change in me, too. I had put on long skirts and  wore my hair up. I had also found out that I had a complexion, and  that sunburn was not becoming. I honestly thought I looked pretty, but  Jack surveyed me with decided disapprobation.    \"What have you done to yourself? You don't look like the same girl.  I'd never know you in that rig-out, with all those flippery-trippery  curls all over your head. Why don't you comb your hair straight back,  and let it hang in a braided tail, like you used to?\"    This didn't suit me at all. When I expect a compliment and get  something quite different I always get snippy. So I said, with what I  intended to be crushing dignity, \"that I supposed I wasn't the same  girl; I had grown up, and if he didn't like my curls he needn't look  at them. For my part, I thought them infinitely preferable to that  horrid, conceited-looking moustache he had grown.\"    \"I'll shave it off if it doesn't suit you,\" said Jack amiably.    Jack is always so provokingly good-humoured. When you've taken pains  and put yourself out--even to the extent of fibbing about a  moustache--to exasperate a person, there is nothing more annoying than  to have him keep perfectly angelic.    But after a while Jack and I adjusted ourselves to the change in each  other and became very good friends again. It was quite a different  friendship from the old, but it was very pleasant. Yes, it was; I  _will_ admit that much.    I was provoked at Jack's determination to settle down for life in  Valleyfield, a horrible, humdrum, little country village.    \"You'll never make your fortune there, Jack,\" I said spitefully.  \"You'll just be a poor, struggling country doctor all your life, and  you'll be grey at forty.\"    \"I don't expect to make a fortune, Kitty,\" said Jack quietly. \"Do you  think that is the one desirable thing? I shall never be a rich man.  But riches are not the only thing that makes life pleasant.\"    \"Well, I think they have a good deal to do with it, anyhow,\" I  retorted. \"It's all very well to pretend to despise wealth, but it's  generally a case of sour grapes. _I_ will own up honestly that I'd  _love_ to be rich.\"    It always seems to make Jack blue and grumpy when I talk like that. I  suppose that is one reason why he never asked me to settle down in  life as a country doctor's wife. Another was, no doubt, that I always  nipped his sentimental sproutings religiously in the bud.    Three weeks ago Alicia wrote to me, asking me to spend the winter with  her. Her letters always make me just gasp with longing for the life  they describe.    Jack's face, when I told him about it, was so woebegone that I felt a  stab of remorse, even in the heyday of my delight.    \"Do you really mean it, Kitty? Are you going away to leave me?\"    \"You won't miss me much,\" I said flippantly--I had a creepy, crawly  presentiment that a scene of some kind was threatening--\"and I'm  awfully tired of Thrush Hill and country life, Jack. I suppose it is  horribly ungrateful of me to say so, but it is the truth.\"    \"I shall miss you,\" he said soberly.    Somehow he had my hands in his. _How_ did he ever get them? I was sure  I had them safely tucked out of harm's way behind me. \"You know,  Kitty, that I love you. I am a poor man--perhaps I may never be  anything else--and this may seem to you very presumptuous. But I  cannot let you go like this. Will you be my wife, dear?\"    Wasn't it horribly straightforward and direct? So like Jack! I tried  to pull my hands away, but he held them fast. There was nothing to do  but answer him. That \"no\" I had determined to say must be said, but,  oh! how woefully it did stick in my throat!    And I honestly believe that by the time I got it out it would have  been transformed into a \"yes,\" in spite of me, had it not been for a  certain paragraph in Alicia's letter which came providentially to my  mind:        Not to flatter you, Katherine, you are a beauty, my dear--if      your photo is to be trusted. If you have not discovered that      fact before--how should you, indeed, in a place like Thrush      Hill?--you soon will in Montreal. With your face and figure      you will make a sensation.        There is to be a nephew of the Sinclairs here this winter. He      is an American, immensely wealthy, and will be the catch of      the season. A word to the wise, etc. Don't get into any      foolish entanglement down there. I have heard some gossip of      you and our old playfellow, Jack Willoughby. I hope it is      nothing but gossip. You can do better than that, Katherine.    That settled Jack's fate, if there ever had been any doubt.    \"Don't talk like that, Jack,\" I said hurriedly. \"It is all nonsense. I  think a great deal of you as a friend and--and--all that, you know.  But I can never marry you.\"    \"Are you sure, Kitty?\" said Jack earnestly. \"Don't you care for me at  all?\"    It was horrid of Jack to ask that question!    \"No,\" I said miserably, \"not--not in that way, Jack. Oh, don't ever  say anything like this to me again.\"    He let go of my hands then, white to the lips.    \"Oh, don't look like that, Jack,\" I entreated.    \"I can't help it,\" he said in a low voice. \"But I won't bother you  again, dear. It was foolish of me to expect--to hope for anything of  the sort. You are a thousand times too good for me, I know.\"    \"Oh, indeed I'm not, Jack,\" I protested."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24878"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1909 to 1922 (#1)"],[1,"Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1909 to 1922      Lucy Maud Montgomery was born at Clifton (now New London), Prince  Edward Island, Canada, on November 30, 1874.

This was why the young man who opened the sagging gate  could not see that it was boarded up, and did not cease his cheerful  whistling until he had pressed through the crowding trees and found  himself almost on the sunken stone doorstep over which in olden days  honeysuckle had been wont to arch. Now only a few straggling,  uncared-for vines clung forlornly to the shingles, and the windows  were, as has been said, all boarded up.    The whistle died on the young man's lips and an expression of blank  astonishment and dismay settled down on his face--a good, kindly,  honest face it was, although perhaps it did not betoken any pronounced  mental gifts on the part of its owner.    \"What can have happened?\" he said to himself. \"Uncle Tom and Aunt  Sally can't be dead--I'd have seen their deaths in the paper if they  was. And I'd a-thought if they'd moved away it'd been printed too.  They can't have been gone long--that flower-bed must have been made up  last spring. Well, this is a kind of setback for a fellow. Here I've  been tramping all the way from the station, a-thinking how good it  would be to see Aunt Sally's sweet old face again, and hear Uncle  Tom's laugh, and all I find is a boarded-up house going to seed.  S'pose I might as well toddle over to Stetsons' and inquire if they  haven't disappeared, too.\"    He went through the old firs back of the lot and across the field to a  rather shabby house beyond. A cheery-faced woman answered his knock  and looked at him in a puzzled fashion. \"Have you forgot me, Mrs.  Stetson? Don't you remember Lovell Stevens and how you used to give  him plum tarts when he'd bring your turkeys home?\"    Mrs. Stetson caught both his hands in a hearty clasp.    \"I guess I haven't forgotten!\" she declared. \"Well, well, and you're  Lovell! I think I ought to know your face, though you've changed a  lot. Fifteen years have made a big difference in you. Come right in.  Pa, this is Lovell--you mind Lovell, the boy Aunt Sally and Uncle Tom  had for years?\"    \"Reckon I do,\" drawled Jonah Stetson with a friendly grin. \"Ain't  likely to forget some of the capers you used to be cutting up. You've  filled out considerable. Where have you been for the last ten years?  Aunt Sally fretted a lot over you, thinking you was dead or gone to  the bad.\"    Lovell's face clouded.    \"I know I ought to have written,\" he said repentantly, \"but you know  I'm a terrible poor scholar, and I'd do most anything than try to  write a letter. But where's Uncle Tom and Aunt Sally gone? Surely they  ain't dead?\"    \"No,\" said Jonah Stetson slowly, \"no--but I guess they'd rather be.  They're in the poorhouse.\"    \"The poorhouse! Aunt Sally in the poorhouse!\" exclaimed Lovell.    \"Yes, and it's a burning shame,\" declared Mrs. Stetson. \"Aunt Sally's  just breaking her heart from the disgrace of it. But it didn't seem as  if it could be helped. Uncle Tom got so crippled with rheumatism he  couldn't work and Aunt Sally was too frail to do anything. They hadn't  any relations and there was a mortgage on the house.\"    \"There wasn't any when I went away.\"    \"No; they had to borrow money six years ago when Uncle Tom had his  first spell of rheumatic fever. This spring it was clear that there  was nothing for them but the poorhouse. They went three months ago and  terrible hard they took it, especially Aunt Sally, I felt awful about  it myself. Jonah and I would have took them if we could, but we just  couldn't--we've nothing but Jonah's wages and we have eight children  and not a bit of spare room. I go over to see Aunt Sally as often as I  can and take her some little thing, but I dunno's she wouldn't rather  not see anybody than see them in the poorhouse.\"    Lovell weighed his hat in his hands and frowned over it reflectively.    \"Who owns the house now?\"    \"Peter Townley. He held the mortgage. And all the old furniture was  sold too, and that most killed Aunt Sally. But do you know what she's  fretting over most of all? She and Uncle Tom will have been married  fifty years in a fortnight's time and Aunt Sally thinks it's awful to  have to spend their golden wedding anniversary in the poorhouse. She  talks about it all the time. You're not going, Lovell\"--for Lovell had  risen--\"you must stop with us, since your old home is closed up. We'll  scare you up a shakedown to sleep on and you're welcome as welcome. I  haven't forgot the time you caught Mary Ellen just as she was tumbling  into the well.\"    \"Thank you, I'll stay to tea,\" said Lovell, sitting down again, \"but I  guess I'll make my headquarters up at the station hotel as long as I  stay round here. It's kind of more central.\"    \"Got on pretty well out west, hey?\" queried Jonah.    \"Pretty well for a fellow who had nothing but his two hands to depend  on when he went out,\" said Lovell cautiously. \"I've only been a  labouring man, of course, but I've saved up enough to start a little  store when I go back. That's why I came east for a trip now--before  I'd be tied down to business. I was hankering to see Aunt Sally and  Uncle Tom once more. I'll never forget how kind and good they was to  me. There I was, when Dad died, a little sinner of eleven, just  heading for destruction. They give me a home and all the schooling I  ever had and all the love I ever got. It was Aunt Sally's teachings  made as much a man of me as I am. I never forgot 'em and I've tried to  live up to 'em.\"    After tea Lovell said he thought he'd stroll up the road and pay Peter  Townley a call. Jonah Stetson and his wife looked at each other when  he had gone.    \"Got something in his eye,\" nodded Jonah. \"Him and Peter weren't never  much of friends.\"    \"Maybe Aunt Sally's bread is coming back to her after all,\" said his  wife. \"People used to be hard on Lovell. But I always liked him and  I'm real glad he's turned out so well.\"    Lovell came back to the Stetsons' the next evening. In the interval he  had seen Aunt Sally and Uncle Tom. The meeting had been both glad and  sad. Lovell had also seen other people.    \"I've bought Uncle Tom's old house from Peter Townley,\" he said  quietly, \"and I want you folks to help me out with my plans. Uncle Tom  and Aunt Sally ain't going to spend their golden wedding in the  poorhouse--no, sir. They'll spend it in their own home with their old  friends about them. But they're not to know anything about it till the  very night. Do you s'pose any of the old furniture could be got back?\"    \"I believe every stick of it could,\" said Mrs. Stetson excitedly.  \"Most of it was bought by folks living handy and I don't believe one  of them would refuse to sell it back. Uncle Tom's old chair is here to  begin with--Aunt Sally give me that herself. She said she couldn't  bear to have it sold. Mrs. Isaac Appleby at the station bought the set  of pink-sprigged china and James Parker bought the grandfather's clock  and the whatnot is at the Stanton Grays'.\"    For the next fortnight Lovell and Mrs. Stetson did so"]]]
