Shuckburgh          INTRODUCTORY NOTE    MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO, the greatest of Roman orators and the chief  master of Latin prose style, was born at Arpinum, Jan. 3, 106 B.C.  His father, who was a man of property and belonged to the class of  the \"Knights,\" moved to Rome when Cicero was a child; and the future  statesman received an elaborate education in rhetoric, law, and  philosophy, studying and practising under some of the most noted  teachers of the time. He began his career as an advocate at the age of  twenty-five, and almost immediately came to be recognized not only as a  man of brilliant talents but also as a courageous upholder of justice in  the face of grave political danger. After two years of practice he left  Rome to travel in Greece and Asia, taking all the opportunities that  offered to study his art under distinguished masters. He returned to  Rome greatly improved in health and in professional skill, and in 76  B. C. was elected to the office of quaestor. He was assigned to the  province of Lilybaeum in Sicily, and the vigor and justice of his  administration earned him the gratitude of the inhabitants. It was at  their request that he undertook in 70 B. C. the Prosecution of Verres,  who as Praetor had subjected the Sicilians to incredible extortion and  oppression; and his successful conduct of this case, which ended in the  conviction and banishment of Verres, may be said to have launched him  on his political career. He became aedile in the same year, in 67 B.C.  praetor, and in 64 B. C. was elected consul by a large majority. The  most important event of the year of his consulship was the conspiracy of  Catiline. This notorious criminal of patrician rank had conspired with  a number of others, many of them young men of high birth but dissipated  character, to seize the chief offices of the state, and to extricate  themselves from the pecuniary and other difficulties that had resulted  from their excesses, by the wholesale plunder of the city. The plot was  unmasked by the vigilance of Cicero, five of the traitors were summarily  executed, and in the overthrow of the army that had been gathered in  their support Catiline himself perished. Cicero regarded himself as the  savior of his country, and his country for the moment seemed to give  grateful assent.    But reverses were at hand. During the existence of the political  combination of Pompey, Caesar, and Crassus, known as the first  triumvirate, P. Clodius, an enemy of Cicero's, proposed a law banishing  \"any one who had put Roman citizens to death without trial.\" This was  aimed at Cicero on account of his share in the Catiline affair, and in  March, 58 B. C., he left Rome. The same day a law was passed by which  he was banished by name, and his property was plundered and destroyed,  a temple to Liberty being erected on the site of his house in the city.  During his exile Cicero's manliness to some extent deserted him. He  drifted from place to place, seeking the protection of officials against  assassination, writing letters urging his supporters to agitate for  his recall, sometimes accusing them of lukewarmness and even treachery,  bemoaning the ingratitude of his country or regretting the course  of action that had led to his outlawry, and suffering from extreme  depression over his separation from his wife and children and the wreck  of his political ambitions. Finally in August, 57 B. C., the decree  for his restoration was passed, and he returned to Rome the next month,  being received with immense popular enthusiasm. During the next few  years the renewal of the understanding among the triumvirs shut Cicero  out from any leading part in politics, and he resumed his activity in  the law-courts, his most important case being, perhaps, the defence of  Milo for the murder of Clodius, Cicero's most troublesome enemy. This  oration, in the revised form in which it has come down to us, is ranked  as among the finest specimens of the art of the orator, though in its  original form it failed to secure Milo's acquittal. Meantime, Cicero was  also devoting much time to literary composition, and his letters show  great dejection over the political situation, and a somewhat wavering  attitude towards the various parties in the state. In 55 B. C. he went  to Cilicia in Asia Minor as proconsul, an office which he administered  with efficiency and integrity in civil affairs and with success in  military. He returned to Italy in the end of the following year, and he  was publicly thanked by the senate for his services, but disappointed in  his hopes for a triumph. The war for supremacy between Caesar and Pompey  which had for some time been gradually growing more certain, broke out  in 49 B.C., when Caesar led his army across the Rubicon, and Cicero  after much irresolution threw in his lot with Pompey, who was overthrown  the next year in the battle of Pharsalus and later murdered in Egypt.  Cicero returned to Italy, where Caesar treated him magnanimously,  and for some time he devoted himself to philosophical and rhetorical  writing. In 46 B.C. he divorced his wife Terentia, to whom he had been  married for thirty years and married the young and wealthy Publilia in  order to relieve himself from financial difficulties; but her also  he shortly divorced. Caesar, who had now become supreme in Rome, was  assassinated in 44 B.C., and though Cicero was not a sharer in the  conspiracy, he seems to have approved the deed. In the confusion which  followed he supported the cause of the conspirators against Antony;  and when finally the triumvirate of Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus was  established, Cicero was included among the proscribed, and on December  7, 43 B.C., he was killed by agents of Antony. His head and hand were  cut off and exhibited at Rome.    The most important orations of the last months of his life were the  fourteen \"Philippics\" delivered against Antony, and the price of this  enmity he paid with his life.    To his contemporaries Cicero was primarily the great forensic and  political orator of his time, and the fifty-eight speeches which have  come down to us bear testimony to the skill, wit, eloquence, and passion  which gave him his pre-eminence. But these speeches of necessity deal  with the minute details of the occasions which called them forth, and  so require for their appreciation a full knowledge of the history,  political and personal, of the time. The letters, on the other hand,  are less elaborate both in style and in the handling of current events,  while they serve to reveal his personality, and to throw light upon  Roman life in the last days of the Republic in an extremely vivid  fashion. Cicero as a man, in spite of his self-importance, the  vacillation of his political conduct in desperate crises, and the  whining despondency of his times of adversity, stands out as at bottom  a patriotic Roman of substantial honesty, who gave his life to check the  inevitable fall of the commonwealth to which he was devoted. The evils  which were undermining the Republic bear so many striking resemblances  to those which threaten the civic and national life of America to-day  that the interest of the period is by no means merely historical.    As a philosopher, Cicero's most important function was to make his  countrymen familiar with the main schools of Greek thought. Much of  this writing is thus of secondary interest to us in comparison with his  originals, but in the fields of religious theory and of the application  of philosophy to life he made important first-hand contributions. From  these works have been selected the two treatises, on Old Age and on  Friendship, which have proved of most permanent and widespread interest  to posterity, and which give a clear impression of the way in which  a high-minded Roman thought about some of the main problems of human  life.          ON FRIENDSHIP      THE augur Quintus Mucius Scaevola used to recount a number of stories  about his father-in-law Galus Laelius, accurately remembered and  charmingly told; and whenever he talked about him always gave him the  title of \"the wise\" without any hesitation. I had been introduced by my  father to Scaevola as soon as I had assumed the _toga virilis_, and I  took advantage of the introduction never to quit the venerable man's  side as long as I was able to stay and he was spared to us. The  consequence was that I committed to memory many disquisitions of his,  as well as many short pointed apophthegms, and, in short, took as much  advantage of his wisdom as I could. When he died, I attached myself  to Scaevola the Pontifex, whom I may venture to call quite the most  distinguished of our countrymen for ability and uprightness. But of this  latter I shall take other occasions to speak. To return to Scaevola the  augur. Among many other occasions I particularly remember one. He was  sitting on a semicircular garden-bench, as was his custom, when I and  a very few intimate friends were there, and he chanced to turn the  conversation upon a subject which about that time was in many people's  mouths. You must remember, Atticus, for you were very intimate  with Publius Sulpicius, what expressions of astonishment, or even  indignation, were called forth by his mortal quarrel, as tribune, with  the consul Quintus Pompeius, with whom he had formerly lived on terms of  the closest intimacy and affection. Well, on this occasion, happening  to mention this particular circumstance, Scaevola detailed to us a  discourse of Laelius on friendship delivered to himself and Laelius's  other son-in-law Galus Fannius, son of Marcus Fannius, a few days after  the death of Africanus. The points of that discussion I committed to  memory, and have arranged them in this book at my own discretion.

My object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious  and fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable  you to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible  is of mythical origin. _Myths_ are fictitious narratives, having an  analogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you  discover that a myth is _always_ a counterfeit, and as such always appears  in evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,  if the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something  found in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the  gods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a  counterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin  of the myths from which \"Bible myths\" have descended? Is it found in the  true God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,  as well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible  that we have many counterfeits _without a genuine_? Many myths sustaining  no analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,  destructive of the term employed, because _myths_ cease to be _myths_  without some near or remote relation to realities. They _must_ sustain  some analogy to something real. And _counterfeits_ also cease to be  _counterfeits_ when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through  analogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems  of olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful  narrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme  God presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many  things which belonged to the province of the \"Almighty One,\" with many  degrading, vile and corrupting habits.    A letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \"Now,  that there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without  having begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father  and the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to  doubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power  extending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by  different sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we  adore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose  names, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of  gods and men.\" In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical  system concerning the ancient gods, and also the \"analagous relation\" to  the \"Master God.\" Each god having his particular dominion over place or  passion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \"Master  God;\" and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely  the \"common Father of gods and men.\" Augustin answers, In your public  square there are _two statues_ of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and  close by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards  Mars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With  regard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \"true God,\"  I take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a  sacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is  acknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the  ancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say  that Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion  of that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a  subordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part  of that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples  consecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the  twelve greater gods prevented \"Deus Optimus Maximus,\" God most good, most  great, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \"In  spite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and  ridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality  acknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and  wise adored one sovereign God.\" Secondary gods were _myths_, counterfeits,  sustaining the _relation_ of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their  own passions to the \"Master God,\" and had subordinate gods representing  passions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these  gods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by  worshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was  the god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The  ancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the  \"true God,\" for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the  universe among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and  ridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of  the great mythical system.    Now, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of  mythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was  written this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it  is necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;  neither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in  this connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \"Of  all your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or  law-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was  Moses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets  have supposed to have been earth-born--that is, to have sprung from the  soil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants--_the aborigines_, Moses is  mentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\" He is mentioned  as a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and  Grecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses  as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolemaeus, in his history of  Egypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book  against the Jews, says \"Moses led them.\" Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says  the inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this  day preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel  from their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,  who employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over  Asia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of  history, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an  ancient law-giver.    It seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient  mythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical  descent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all  mythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.    Voltaire says \"the character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\" we will  add, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen--Hesiod, in his theogony,  says: \"Chronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the  beginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being  seized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred  devouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed  Jupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and  divided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and  Pluto Hades.\"    Pros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth  in the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more  frequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many  instances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and  proved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits  of the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung  by the poets for his successful labors.    The son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was  able to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the  three-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from  its refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew  the poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-lo-us. The guest-slaying Bu-si-ris  was delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be  conquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the  cloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are  specimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an  impassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our  religion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the  old mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad  as the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these  counterfeits or myths and the \"true God,\" save that remote power of God  which is"]]]
