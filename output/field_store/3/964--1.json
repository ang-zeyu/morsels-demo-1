LACEY, M.A.    VICAR OF MADINGLEY        RIVINGTONS    34, _KING STREET, COVENT GARDEN_    LONDON    1900    _Price One Shilling: net_        NOTE      The following paper, read at Oxford  before certain members of the University,  in November, 1899, is published at the  request of some who heard it.        THE ACTS OF UNIFORMITY      The Acts of Uniformity are incidents in a great  movement. They are far from being the most important  of its incidents. Their importance has perhaps  been exaggerated, and their purport is commonly  misunderstood. My object is to place them in their  true relation to other incidents. It is useless to study  them apart; they cannot be understood except as  details of a connected history. I shall confine myself,  however, to a narrow, question: assuming the general  history, I shall ask how the several Acts of Uniformity  come into it, with what purpose and with what ultimate  effect. To study immediate effects would be to  engage in too wide an inquiry.    We owe thanks to the men who drafted the  statutes of the sixteenth century for their long argumentative  preambles. These are invaluable as showing  the occasion and purpose of the Acts. We shall not  go to them for an uncoloured record of facts--their  unsupported assertions will hardly, indeed, be taken as  evidence for facts at all; but they tell us to what facts  the legislator wished to call attention, and in what  light he would have them regarded. The preamble  of the first Act of Uniformity is among the most  illuminating, and with its help we can assemble the  facts in relation to which the purport of the Act must  be determined.    We are in the year 1548. Important changes in  matters of religion had taken place; greater changes  were in prospect. The processions before High Mass  on Sundays and Festivals, conspicuous and popular  ceremonies, had been stopped on rather flimsy grounds,  and a Litany in English substituted--the \"English  Procession,\" as it was called. Many images in the  churches had been destroyed, as superstitious; the  censing of those remaining had ceased. The peculiar  ceremonies of Candlemas, Ash Wednesday, and Palm  Sunday had been omitted in many places. A chapter  of the Bible in English was being read after the  lessons at Mattins, and at Evensong after _Magnificat_.    It was not very clear by what authority these  innovations had been made. There had been royal  proclamations and injunctions; episcopal injunctions  and orders on visitation. There was another change,  perhaps the most striking of all, in which Parliament  had intervened. The first Act of the first Parliament  of Edward VI. required the administration of the Holy  Sacrament of the Altar in both kinds. No penalties  were annexed, though elsewhere in the same statute  severe penalties were appointed for depravers of the  Sacrament. Convocation had concurred, adopting on  December 2, 1547, a resolution of some sort in favour  of communion in both kinds. [1] The records are too  scanty to show exactly what was done. An _Order of  the Communion_ with English prayers, to be inserted  in the usual order of the Mass, was afterwards published,  and brought into general use, on the command  apparently of the King and his Council. Nothing  was said in the Act of Parliament about the mode of  giving communion, and therefore,      lest every man phantasing and devising a sundry way by    himself, in the use of this most blessed Sacrament of    unity, there might thereby arise any unseemly and ungodly    diversity,    the King put forth this Order to be exclusively  followed. [2] A letter from the Council to the bishops  of the realm explains the source of the Order. It was  drawn up at the King's desire, by      sundry of his majesty's most grave and well learned    prelates, and other learned men in the scripture. [3]    This, then, was commanded by public authority. But  there were other innovations of more doubtful origin.  On May 12, 1548, at the commemoration of Henry  VII. in Westminster Abbey, Wriothesley tells us of      the masse song all in English, with the consecration of the    sacrament also spoken in English,    the priest afterwards \"ministering the communion  after the Kinges booke.\" In September, at the consecration  of Fernir by Cranmer, Holbeach and Ridley,  something of the same kind was done. The account  in Cranmer's Register is confused, but it says distinctly  that the Holy Eucharist was _consecrata in lingua vernacula_.  The churchwardens of St. Michael's, Cornhill,  this same year paid five shillings      to the Scolle Mr of Polles, for wrytyng of the masse in    Englysh & ye benedicites;    doubtless for use in church. [4] In May, again, according  to Wriothesley,      Poules quire and dyvers other parishes in London song all    the service in English, both mattens, masse, and evensonge.    At St. Michael's, \"viii Sawtters in Englyshe\" were  bought. [5] In September, Somerset, as Chancellor,  wrote to the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge that in all  the Colleges they should      use one uniform order, rite, and ceremonies in the mass,    mattins and evensong, and all divine service in the same    to be said or sung, such as is presently used in the king's    Majesty's chapel, and none other. [6]    There is nothing to show what was specially intended  here, but a copy of the order in question was sent with  the letter for more information.    Meanwhile steps were being taken for a thorough  reform of the customary services. A committee of  Convocation had been appointed for \"examining, reforming,  and publishing the divine service.\" In  November, 1547, the clergy of the lower house of Convocation  petitioned to have the result submitted to them,  with what success is not known. [7] The _Order of Communion_  was not improbably the work of this committee.  During the year 1548 we know that several divines--probably  the same committee still continuing [8]--were  engaged in the task of drawing up an order of service,  which at a meeting of the bishops held in October  or November was subscribed by all, with the single  exception of Day of Chichester. This was the order  afterwards brought into use, apparently with some  verbal alterations, as the Book of Common Prayer. [9]    Here we see things in great confusion. The cause  of the confusion is not far to seek. The services of  the Church were regulated by custom, and custom  was crumbling to pieces. Uniform in the main, the  services in different places had varied in detail. The  tradition of each place had been maintained partly  by conservative instinct, partly by the pressure of  ecclesiastical discipline. The conservative instinct  was now giving-way to a temper of innovation;  ecclesiastical discipline was paralyzed by the interference  of the Crown. Men could see no reason why  they should not innovate, and the authorities of the  Church were powerless to restrain them. England  was threatened with the state of things prevailing in  Germany, where the clergy and magistrates of every  free town took it upon themselves to revise the order  of divine service; where the bishop of Strassburg, for  example, even in his own city and his own cathedral,  could not prevent the introduction of a strange and  novel ritual. [10]    Into this environment the first Act of Uniformity  was projected. In the preamble of the Act we find  the state of things not unfairly described, with a  discreet avoidance, however, of all reference to the  causes of confusion. Mention is made of the old  diversity of use, and then of the new and far greater  diversity that was coming in. The godly care of the  King, the Protector and the Council, in setting the  bishops and divines to work at reforming the service  of the Church, is gratefully acknowledged. This work  was now concluded \"by the aid of the Holy Ghost,  with one uniform agreement.\" The title of the book  so prepared is recited: _The Book of Common Prayer,  and Administration of the Sacraments, and other Rites  and Ceremonies of the Church, after the Use of the  Church of England_. The enactment then proceeds:    \"All and singular ministers in any Cathedral or  Parish Church, or other place within this realm of  England, Wales, Calice, and Marches of the same,  or other the King's dominions, shall from and after  the Feast of Pentecost next coming, be bounden to  say and use the Mattins, Evensong, celebration of  the Lord's Supper, commonly called the Mass, and  administration of each the Sacraments, and all their  common and open prayer, in such order and form as  is mentioned in the same Book, and none other, or  otherwise.\"    Then follow the penalties. Any minister refusing  to use the Book, or using any other, or  speaking in derogation of the Book, for the first  offence is to forfeit to the King one year's profits  of some one of his spiritual promotions, if he have  any, and to suffer six months' imprisonment. For a  second offence he is to lose all his promotions and  suffer one year's imprisonment. For a third offence  the penalty is imprisonment for life. If he have no  promotion, he is for the first offence to suffer six  months' imprisonment; and for a second, imprisonment  for life. There are penalties for laymen also.  Any person speaking in derogation of the Book, or  interrupting its use, or causing a minister to use any  other form, is for the first offence to forfeit ten pounds,  for a second offence twenty pounds; on a third  occasion he is to forfeit all his goods and chattels and  suffer imprisonment for life. These penalties are to  be enforced by judges of assize, proceeding in the  manner customary on indictment for trespass.    What have we here? A purely penal statute,  imposing the crushing penalties usual at the time.  My purpose is to show the relation of the statute to  the Book of Common Prayer.

The source and fullness of created good is the knowledge and enjoyment  of God. \"Give what thou wilt, without thee we are poor; and with thee  rich, take what thou wilt away.\" The wicked are like a ship's crew at  sea, carried by the winds upon unknown waters, without peace or safety  until they can renew communications with the shore. A man alienated from  his God is without his proper relations, and separated from the fountain  of happiness, is like a child unconscious of his father--an orphan,  forced along, the sport of accident, with no hope for the future, but  darkness that may overshadow his pathway to the tomb. If we were at once  deprived of all knowledge of God where would we find hopes for support  in the gloomy hours of adversity? What sadness would reign over the  world! What black despair! O, what a chasm it would make to strike the  Infinite One out of existence! \"The angels might retire in silence and  weep, or fly through infinite space seeking some token of the Father  they had lost. With unbounded grief and despair they might wing their  way farther and farther, with their harps all unstrung, and every song  silent, and the soul-harrowing words, 'We have no Father, no God, a  blind chance rules,' might be all that would break the awful silence of  heaven. Let the glorious words once more be heard, 'God reigns, he  lives, he reigns,' and what joy would fill the heavens and the earth.\"  The child of sorrow would lift up his head and say, \"Our Father who art  in heaven.\" The heavenly songsters would string anew their harps, and  send the good news far and wide, \"He lives, he reigns, God over all,  blessed forever.\"    \"We are not able to estimate the effect it would produce to blot the  knowledge of God from the universe. We can not appreciate the state of  that mind which labors under the impression that God is retiring.  Perhaps we have one momentary example of the sad gloom that takes  possession of the man under such circumstances. It is seen in the  Savior's dying words, 'My God! my God! why hast thou forsaken me?'\"    In our nature and condition there are two sources of misery--the mind,  or conscience, disturbed by sin, and the body affected by disease and  death. Sinful emotions cause disquietude, uneasiness, sorrow and misery,  bitterness, recrimination, reciprocated treachery, infuriated rage,  malignant and stormy passions; envy, jealousy, suspicion and unlawful  desires distract the mind and quench its joys. Who can be happy in such  a condition? Disquieted and corrupted affections cause the greater part  of the unhappiness or misery of the race. The angels of light could not  be happy in such a murky sea. Our great ancestors were doomed to toil in  a world of disappointment and sorrow for yielding to such a guide. Haman  occupied a high position at the court of Persia, yet he made himself  miserable because \"Mordecai the Jew sat at the king's gate.\" And Ahab,  on the throne of Israel, \"refused to eat bread\" because he could not get  possession of the vineyard of Naboth. Men can not be happy with such  passions reigning in the mind, and yet they are found in almost every  bosom, unless it has been purified by the influence of the gospel of  Jesus the Christ. The great idols of this world are fame, pleasure and  wealth, and the love of these is the strong passion of the heart. But it  is the most prolific source of individual, social and public misfortune,  the most mischievous, contentious and demoralizing passion. The  ambitious, the voluptuous, the rich and the great are not necessarily  happy. Alexander wept upon the throne of the world because there was not  another world for him to conquer.    In the midst of seminal pleasures and corrupt passions men are always  miserable. The influence of the Gospel of Christ is the only remedy for  such diseases. It saves men from aggravating selfishness and holds in  check their fierce passions until they are extinguished. Virtuous  affections are invariably the great sources of human happiness. They are  fountains of living waters, which purify the mind and make their  possessors happy. They are as rivers of water in a thirsty land.    In the teachings of Christ we learn all that pertains to true happiness,  in what it consists and how to obtain it. There we are admonished of  mere worldly blessings, because the desire for them is generally so  intense that it becomes a source of corruption, and in our successes we  often forget our highest interests. The Savior left in the background  the commonly received notions of men touching the sources of true  happiness. He said: \"Blessed are the poor in spirit,\" referring not to  those who are temporally poor. The wicked are poor as well as the  righteous. O, how dreadfully miserable are the wicked poor! a miserable  life here, followed by a miserable hereafter. Many poor persons are  haughty, ungodly, dishonest, profligate and unhappy. Neither does it  mean voluntary poverty, or to turn mendicant monks and friars. It means  the humble, those who are deeply sensible of their spiritual or mental  and moral wants; in other words, those who feel that there is a place in  their spiritual nature for the blessings of the Gospel of Christ. It is  opposed to self-righteousness. The poor in spirit come to God through  Christ, and, putting all their trust in him, submit to the divine will  under all the trying dispensations of his providence.    The poor in spirit are always sensible of their need of salvation, but  the proud in spirit are \"clean in their own eyes.\" Their goodness is  like the morning cloud and the early dew, yet they say, Stand by  thyself; I am holier than thou. \"Blessed are the poor in spirit. Blessed  are the meek. Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after  righteousness. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\"  What a sublime rebuke to the spirit of this world! It is a grand  contrast to the uneasy desires of greedy covetousness; to the  disposition of the gay; to the degradation of the impure; to the  senseless pleasures of the ambitious, when new fires ignite their hopes  only to plunge them into deeper darkness. The Bible's happiest soul is  he who has most of its peculiar mind and character. Not on account of  earthly riches, for he may be one of the Lord's poor, who, like his  blessed Master, has \"no place to lay his head.\" Not because he has  sought and obtained honor from men, but because he sought and \"seeks the  honor which cometh from God only.\" Not because he has much of this  world, but because he is a Christian. He may not have the greatest  capacity, but he has a state of mind that prepares him to rightly  estimate and enjoy all that is worth enjoying. \"To the upright there  ariseth light in the darkness.\" They are wisely guided, comforted and  encouraged in the most gloomy wilderness. They are not oppressed with  doubts; sorrow does not crush them. Darkness gives place to light, and  the seeming evil turns to good. They often sip honey from the most  bitter flowers. They yield not to fear, for they believe in God, and are  assured, by a thousand contrasts, that \"all things work together for  good to those who love God.\" One of the never-failing sources of  happiness for which we are under obligations to Jesus the Christ is the  mind and character which he requires of us. \"A good man shall be  satisfied from himself.\"    \"Man was created for an active life. Effort is the true element of a  well regulated mind. Undisturbed soil becomes hard and unproductive. Its  bosom is shut up against the dews and the rains, and also against the  warm rays of the sun. So it is with the mind when it is closed up and  deprived of healthy action; this man lives for himself alone, and only  the baser passions spring up in his breast. His soul is too narrow for  Christian benevolence; sympathy and emotion are disabled and all his  nobler faculties languish. Action, from intelligent and benevolent  principles, is a great fountain of happiness. Few streams of bliss equal  those which flow from charitable exertions. Benevolence and well-doing  are great inducements to future exertions, because of the fact that they  are their own reward in a thousand different ways. The seed thus sown  brings back an hundred fold, and a rich harvest to others, which adds to  the abundance of our own happiness. But where shall we go for those  principles of action? Shall we search for them in nature? Can reason  alone discover them? Are they found in the teachings of philosophy? Are  they gathered from observation? Does not our world need Revelation to  make known the true aim and end of our being?\" Cicero said, \"Those who  do not agree in stating what is the chief end, or good, must of course  differ in the whole system of precepts for the conduct of human life.\"  He also says there was so great a dissention among the philosophers,  upon this subject, that it was almost impossible to enumerate their  different sentiments. So it came to pass that exertions for benevolent  ends were seldom, if ever, put forth by pagans in pagan lands--they knew  nothing of the happiness springing from such a source.    Great efforts from great motives are the glory and blessedness of our  nature. In the Bible only men have learned what great motives and  efforts are. There we find food to sustain them and wisdom to guide  them. Nowhere in the pages of infidel philosophy can we find such an  injunction as this: \"Whether, therefore, ye eat or drink, do all to the  glory of God.\" Where else do we find this Christian maxim: \"None of us  liveth to himself, and none of us dieth to himself; but whether we live,  we live unto the Lord, and whether we die, we die unto the Lord.\" He or  she alone is"]]]
