TO WHICH ARE ADDED  RULES FOR DETERMINING  THE PRECISE FIGURE, THE DEGREE OF BEAUTY,  THE HABITS, AND THE AGE  OF WOMEN,    NOTWITHSTANDING THE AIDS AND DISGUISE  OF DRESS.      BOSTON:  THEODORE ABBOT,  388 WASHINGTON ST.    1841.          Entered according to act of congress, in the year 1841, by      THEODORE ABBOT,    in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of Massachusetts.          In the following Pages,      It is our design to present a pleasing and interesting miscellany, which  will serve to beguile the leisure hour, and will at the same time couple  instruction with amusement. We have used but little method in the  arrangement: Choosing rather to furnish the reader with a rich profusion  of narratives and anecdotes, all tending to illustrate the      FEMALE CHARACTER,    to display its delicacy, its sweetness, its gentle or sometimes heroic  virtues, its amiable weaknesses, and strange defects--than to attempt an  accurate analysis of the hardest subject man ever attempted to master,  viz--WOMAN.    It will be seen that we do not set down Woman as a cipher in the account  of human beings. We accord to her her full share of importance in the  world, and we have not attempted to relieve her from a sense of her  responsibility as an accountable being. Above all, we have not failed to  impress upon her the obligations she is under to CHRISTIANITY, whose  benign influences have raised her to be the companion and bosom-friend  of man, instead of his mere handmaid and dependant. It is religion that  must form such a character as the following, which though applied by  Pope to one of the most accomplished women of his time, is that of a  CHRISTIAN WIFE in every age and station,--      \"Oh! blest with temper whose unclouded ray    Can make tomorrow cheerful as to-day:    She who can love a sister's charms, or hear    Sighs for a daughter with unwounded ear;    She who ne'er answers till a husband cools,    Or, if she rules him, never shows she rules;    Charms by accepting--by submitting sways,    Yet has her humor most, when she obeys.\"    By causing the character of woman to be more thoroughly discussed and  better understood;--by making it more frequently the theme of rational  meditation to the young and ardent, who, from the force of defective  education, are apt to regard all \"the sex,\" beyond a very limited  circle, as mere accessaries to animal enjoyment,--whose peace they may  wound without compunction, and whose happiness they may peril without  reflection,--we feel that we shall do both sexes a good service, and one  for which as they advance in life, and in their turn become husbands,  wives and parents, they will thank our little book, as having helped  them to know themselves and each other.

I fain would trace    Its brightness and its blackness.\"          SKETCHES OF \"THE SEX.\"    THE FIRST WOMAN, AND HER ANTEDILUVIAN  DESCENDANTS.      The great Creator, having formed man of the dust of the earth, \"made a  deep sleep to fall upon him, and took one of his ribs, and closed up the  flesh instead thereof. And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from  man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.\" Hence the fair sex,  in the opinion of some authors, being formed of matter doubly refined,  derive their superior beauty and excellence.    Not long after the creation, the first woman was tempted by the serpent  to eat of the fruit of a certain tree, in the midst of the garden of  Eden, with regard to which God had said, \"Ye shall not eat of it,  neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.\"    This deception, and the fatal consequences arising from it, furnish the  most interesting story in the whole history of the sex.    On the offerings being brought, and that of Abel accepted, Cain's  jealousy and resentment rose to such a pitch, that, as soon as they came  down from the mount where they had been sacrificing, he fell upon his  brother and slew him.    For this cruel and barbarous action, Cain and his posterity, being  banished from the rest of the human race, indulged themselves in every  species of wickedness. On this account, it is supposed, they were called  the _Sons and Daughters of Men_. The posterity of Seth, on the other  hand, became eminent for virtue, and a regard to the divine precepts. By  their regular and amiable conduct, they acquired the appellation of  _Sons and Daughters of God_.    After the deluge there is a chasm in the history of women, until the  time of the patriarch Abraham. They then begin to be introduced into the  sacred story. Several of their actions are recorded. The laws, customs,  and usages, by which they were governed, are frequently exhibited.      WOMAN IN THE PATRIARCHAL AGES.    The condition of women among the ancient patriarchs, appears to have  been but extremely indifferent. When Abraham entertained the angels,  sent to denounce the destruction of Sodom, he seems to have treated his  wife as a menial servant: \"Make ready quickly,\" said he to her, \"three  measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes on the hearth.\"    In many parts of the east, water is only to be met with deep in the  earth, and to draw it from the wells is, consequently, fatiguing and  laborious.
