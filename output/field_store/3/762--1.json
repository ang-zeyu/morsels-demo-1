The title might have  claimed fourteen or fifteen thousand miles instead of ten, for the book  was projected and the title adopted some years ago, and the journeys  have continued. But ten thousand is a good round titular number, and is  none the worse for being well within the mark.    So far as mere distance is concerned, anyway, there is nothing  noteworthy in this record. There are many men in Alaska who have done  much more. A mail-carrier on one of the longer dog routes will cover  four thousand miles in a winter, while the writer's average is less than  two thousand. But his sled has gone far off the beaten track, across the  arctic wilderness, into many remote corners; wherever, indeed, white men  or natives were to be found in all the great interior.    These journeys were connected primarily with the administration of the  extensive work of the Episcopal Church in the interior of Alaska, under  the bishop of the diocese; but that feature of them has been fully set  forth from time to time in the church publications, and finds only  incidental reference here.    It is a great, wild country, little known save along accustomed routes  of travel; a country with a beauty and a fascination all its own; mere  arctic wilderness, indeed, and nine tenths of it probably destined  always to remain such, yet full of interest and charm.    Common opinion \"outside\" about Alaska seems to be veering from the view  that it is a land of perpetual snow and ice to the other extreme of  holding it to be a \"world's treasure-house\" of mineral wealth and  agricultural possibility. The world's treasure is deposited in many  houses, and Alaska has its share; its mineral wealth is very great, and  \"hidden doors of opulence\" may open at any time, but its agricultural  possibilities, in the ordinary sense in which the phrase is used, are  confined to very small areas in proportion to the enormous whole, and in  very limited degree.    It is no new thing for those who would build railways to write in  high-flown style about the regions they would penetrate, and, indeed, to  speak of \"millions of acres waiting for the plough\" is not necessarily a  misrepresentation; they are waiting. Nor is it altogether unnatural that  professional agricultural experimenters at the stations established by  the government should make the most of their experiments. When Dean  Stanley spoke disdainfully of dogma, Lord Beaconsfield replied; \"Ah! but  you must always remember, no dogmas, no deans.\"    Besides the physical attractions of this country, it has a gentle  aboriginal population that arouses in many ways the respect and the  sympathy of all kindly people; and it has some of the hardiest and most  adventurous white men in the world. The reader will come into contact  with both in these pages.    So much for the book's scope; a word of its limitations. It is confined  to the interior of Alaska; confined in the main to the great valley of  the Yukon and its tributaries; being a record of sled journeys, it is  confined to the winter.    There is no man living who knows the whole of Alaska or who has any  right to speak about the whole of Alaska. Bishop Rowe knows more about  Alaska, in all probability, than any other living man, and there are  large areas of the country in which he has never set foot. There is  probably no man living, save Bishop Rowe, who has visited even the  localities of all the missions of the Episcopal Church in Alaska. If one  were to travel continuously for a whole year, using the most expeditious  means at his command, and not wasting a day anywhere, it is doubtful  whether, summer and winter, by sea and land, squeezing the last mile out  of the seasons, travelling on the \"last ice\" and the \"first water,\" he  could even touch at all the mission stations. So, when a man from Nome  speaks of Alaska he means his part of Alaska, the Seward Peninsula. When  a man from Valdez or Cordova speaks of Alaska he means the Prince  William Sound country. When a man from Juneau speaks of Alaska he means  the southeastern coast. Alaska is not one country but many, with  different climates, different resources, different problems, different  populations, different interests; and what is true of one part of it is  often grotesquely untrue of other parts. This is the reason why so many  contradictory things have been written about the country. Not only do  these various parts of Alaska differ radically from one another, but  they are separated from one another by almost insuperable natural  obstacles, so that they are in reality different countries.    When Alaska is spoken of in this book the interior is meant, in which  the writer has travelled almost continuously for the past eight years.  The Seward Peninsula is the only other part of the country that the book  touches. And as regards summer travel and the summer aspect of the  country, there is material for another book should the reception of this  one warrant its preparation.           *       *       *       *       *    The problems of the civil government of the country will be found  touched upon somewhat freely as they rise from time to time in the  course of these journeys, and some faint hope is entertained that  drawing attention to evils may hasten a remedy.    Alaska is not now, and never has been, a lawless country in the old,  Wild Western sense of unpunished homicides and crimes of violence. It  has been, on the whole, singularly free from bloodshed--a record due in  no small part to the fact that it is not the custom of the country to  carry pistols, for which again there is climatic and geographic reason;  due also in part to the very peaceable and even timid character of its  native people.    But as regards the stringent laws enacted by Congress for the protection  of these native people, and especially in the essential particular of  protecting them from the fatal effects of intoxicating liquor, the  country is not law-abiding, for these laws are virtually a dead letter.    Justices of the peace who must live wholly upon fees in regions where  fees will not furnish a living, and United States deputy marshals  appointed for political reasons, constitute a very feeble staff against  law-breakers. When it is remembered that on the whole fifteen hundred  miles of the American Yukon there are but six of these deputy marshals,  and that these six men, with another five or six on the tributary  rivers, form all the police of the country, it will be seen that  Congress must do something more than pass stringent laws if those laws  are to be of any effect.    A body of stipendiary magistrates, a police force wholly removed from  politics and modelled somewhat upon the Canadian Northwest Mounted  Police--these are two of the great needs of the country if the liquor  laws are to be enforced and the native people are to survive.    That the danger of the extermination of the natives is a real one all  vital statistics kept at Yukon River points in the last five years show,  and that there are powerful influences in the country opposed to the  execution of the liquor laws some recent trials at Fairbanks would leave  no room for doubt if there had been any room before. Indeed, at this  writing, when the pages of this book are closed and there remains no  place save the preface where the matter can be referred to, an impudent  attempt is on foot, with large commercial backing, to secure the  removal of a zealous and fearless United States district attorney, who  has been too active in prosecuting liquor-peddlers to suit the wholesale  dealers in liquor.    There are, of course, those who view with perfect equanimity the  destruction of the natives that is now going on, and look forward with  complacency to the time when the Alaskan Indian shall have ceased to  exist. But to men of thought and feeling such cynicism is abhorrent, and  the duty of the government towards its simple and kindly wards is clear.    A measure of real protection must be given the native communities  against the low-down whites who seek to intrude into them and build  habitations for convenient resort upon occasions of drunkenness and  debauchery, and some adequate machinery set up for suppressing the  contemptible traffic in adulterated spirits they subsist largely upon."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22976"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was  produced from images generously made available by the  Library of Congress, Manuscript Division)                    SLAVE NARRATIVES      _A Folk History of Slavery in the United States  From Interviews with Former Slaves_      TYPEWRITTEN RECORDS PREPARED BY  THE FEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT  1936-1938  ASSEMBLED BY  THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS PROJECT  WORK PROJECTS ADMINISTRATION  FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  SPONSORED BY THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS      _Illustrated with Photographs_    WASHINGTON 1941      [Transcriber's Note: Obvious printer errors have been corrected.

I wuz bawned in Rockingham, Richmond County,  North Carolina. I wuz eight years old when the Yankees come through. I  belonged to Marster Tom A. Covington, Sir. My mother wuz named Easter,  and my father wuz named Jacob. We were all Covingtons. No Sir, I don't  know whur my mother and father come from. Soloman wuz brother number  one, then Luke, Josh, Stephen, Asbury. My sisters were Jane, Frances,  Wincy, and I wuz nex'. I 'members grandmother. She wuz named Lovie Wall.  They brought her here from same place. My aunts were named, one wuz  named Nicey, and one wuz named Jane. I picked feed for the white folks.  They sent many of the chillun to work at the salt mines, where we went  to git salt. My brother Soloman wuz sent to the salt mines. Luke looked  atter the sheep. He knocked down china berries for 'em. Dad and mammie  had their own gardens and hogs. We were compelled to walk about at night  to live. We were so hongry we were bound to steal or parish. This trait  seems to be handed down from slavery days. Sometimes I thinks dis might  be so. Our food wuz bad. Marster worked us hard and gave us nuthin. We  had to use what we made in the garden to eat. We also et our hogs. Our  clothes were bad, and beds were sorry. We went barefooted in a way.  What I mean by that is, that we had shoes part of the time. We got one  pair o' shoes a year. When dey wored out we went barefooted. Sometimes  we tied them up with strings, and they were so ragged de tracks looked  like bird tracks, where we walked in the road. We lived in log houses  daubed with mud. They called 'em the slaves houses. My old daddy partly  raised his chilluns on game. He caught rabbits, coons, an' possums. We  would work all day and hunt at night. We had no holidays. They did not  give us any fun as I know. I could eat anything I could git. I tell you  de truth, slave time wuz slave time wid us. My brother wore his shoes  out, and had none all thu winter. His feet cracked open and bled so bad  you could track him by the blood. When the Yankees come through, he got  shoes.    I wuz married in Rockingham. I don't 'member when Mr. Jimmie  Covington, a preacher, a white man, married us. I married James Adams  who lived on a plantation near Rockingham. I had a nice blue wedding  dress. My husband wuz dressed in kinder light clothes, best I  rickerlect. It's been a good long time, since deen [HW: den] tho'.    I sho do 'member my Marster Tom Covington and his wife too, Emma. Da  old man wuz the very nick.[HW correction: Nick] He would take what we  made and lowance us, dat is lowance it out to my daddy after he had  made it. My father went to Steven Covington, Marster Tom's brother, and  told him about it, and his brother Stephen made him gib father his meat  back to us.    My missus wuz kind to me, but Mars. Tom wuz the buger. It wuz a mighty  bit plantation. I don't know how many slaves wuz on it, there were a lot  of dem do'. Dere were overseers two of 'em. One wuz named Bob Covington  and the other Charles Covington. They were colored men. I rode with  them. I rode wid 'em in the carriage sometimes. De carriage had seats  dat folded up. Bob wuz overseer in de field, and Charles wuz carriage  driver. All de plantation wuz fenced in, dat is all de fields, wid  rails; de rails wuz ten feet long. We drawed water wid a sweep and pail.  De well wuz in the yard. De mules for the slaves wuz in town, dere were  none on the plantation. Dey had 'em in town; dey waked us time de  chicken crowed, and we went to work just as soon as we could see how to  make a lick wid a hoe.    Lawd, you better not be caught wid a book in yor han'. If you did, you  were sold. Dey didn't 'low dat. I kin read a little, but I can't write.  I went to school after slavery and learned to read. We didn't go to  school but three or four week a year, and learned to read.    Dere wuz no church on the plantation, and we were not lowed to have  prayer meetings. No parties, no candy pullings, nor dances, no sir, not  a bit. I 'member goin' one time to the white folkses church, no  baptizing dat I 'member. Lawd have mercy, ha! ha! No. De pateroller were  on de place at night. You couldn't travel without a pas.    We got few possums. I have greased my daddy's back after he had been  whupped until his back wuz cut to pieces. He had to work jis the same.  When we went to our houses at night, we cooked our suppers at night, et  and then went to bed. If fire wuz out or any work needed doin' around de  house we had to work on Sundays. They did not gib us Christmas or any  other holidays. We had corn shuckings. I herd 'em talkin' of cuttin de  corn pile right square in two. One wud git on one side, another on the  other side and see"]]]
