Articles of Christian Doctrine       which were to have been presented on our part       to the Council, if any had been assembled at Mantua       or elsewhere, indicating what we could accept       or yield, and what we could not._         by Dr. Martin Luther, 1537         Translated by F. Bente and  W. H. T. Dau         Published in:       _Triglot Concordia: The Symbolical Books       of the Ev. Lutheran Church_.       (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1921),       pp. 453-529.          Preface of Dr. Martin Luther.    Since Pope Paul III convoked a Council last year, to assemble  at Mantua about Whitsuntide, and afterwards transferred it  from Mantua, so that it is not yet known where he will or can  fix it, and we on our part either had to expect that we would  be summoned also to the Council or [to fear that we would] be  condemned unsummoned, I was directed to compile and collect  the articles of our doctrine [in order that it might be plain]  in case of deliberation as to what and how far we would be  both willing and able to yield to the Papists, and in what  points we intended to persevere and abide to the end.    I have accordingly compiled these articles and presented them  to our side. They have also been accepted and unanimously  confessed by our side, and it has been resolved that, in case  the Pope with his adherents should ever be so bold as  seriously and in good faith, without lying and cheating, to  hold a truly free [legitimate] Christian Council (as, indeed,  he would be in duty bound to do), they be publicly delivered  in order to set forth the Confession of our Faith.    But though the Romish court is so dreadfully afraid of a free  Christian Council, and shuns the light so shamefully, that it  has [entirely] removed, even from those who are on its side,  the hope that it will ever permit a free Council, much less  that it will itself hold one, whereat, as is just, they [many  Papists] are greatly offended and have no little trouble on  that account [are disgusted with this negligence of the Pope],  since they notice thereby that the Pope would rather see all  Christendom perish and all souls damned than suffer either  himself or his adherents to be reformed even a little, and his  [their] tyranny to be limited, nevertheless I have determined  meanwhile to publish these articles in plain print, so that,  should I die before there would be a Council (as I fully  expect and hope, because the knaves who flee the light and  shun the day take such wretched pains to delay and hinder the  Council), those who live and remain after me may have my  testimony and confession to produce, in addition to the  Confession which I have issued previously, whereby up to this  time I have abided, and, by God's grace, will abide.    For what shall I say? How shall I complain? I am still living,  writing, preaching, and lecturing daily; [and] yet there are  found such spiteful men, not only among the adversaries, but  also false brethren that profess to be on our side, as dare to  cite my writings and doctrine directly against myself, and let  me look on and listen, although they know well that I teach  otherwise, and as wish to adorn their venom with my labor, and  under my name to [deceive and] mislead the poor people. [Good  God!] Alas! what first will happen when I am dead?    Indeed, I ought to reply to everything while I am still  living. But, again, how can I alone stop all the mouths of the  devil? especially of those (as they all are poisoned) who will  not hear or notice what we write, but solely exercise  themselves with all diligence how they may most shamefully  pervert and corrupt our word in every letter. These I let the  devil answer, or at last Gods wrath, as they deserve. I often  think of the good Gerson who doubts whether anything good  should be [written and] published. If it is not done, many  souls are neglected who could be delivered: but if it is done,  the devil is there with malignant, villainous tongues without  number which envenom and pervert everything, so that  nevertheless the fruit [the usefulness of the writings] is  prevented. Yet what they gain thereby is manifest. For while  they have lied so shamefully against us and by means of lies  wished to retain the people, God has constantly advanced His  work, and been making their following ever smaller and ours  greater, and by their lies has caused and still causes them to  be brought to shame.    I must tell a story. There was a doctor sent here to  Wittenberg from France, who said publicly before us that his  king was sure and more than sure, that among us there is no  church, no magistrate, no married life, but all live  promiscuously as cattle, and each one does as he pleases.  Imagine now, how will those who by their writings have  instilled such gross lies into the king and other countries as  the pure truth, look at us on that day before the  judgment-seat of Christ? Christ, the Lord and Judge of us all,  knows well that they lie and have [always] lied, His sentence  they in turn, must hear; that I know certainly. God convert to  repentance those who can be converted! Regarding the rest it  will be said, Woe, and, alas! eternally.    But to return to the subject. I verily desire to see a truly  Christian Council [assembled some time], in order that many  matters and persons might be helped. Not that we need It, for  our churches are now, through God's grace, so enlightened and  equipped with the pure Word and right use of the Sacraments,  with knowledge of the various callings and of right works,  that we on our part ask for no Council, and on such points  have nothing better to hope or expect from a Council. But we  see in the bishoprics everywhere so many parishes vacant and  desolate that one's heart would break, and yet neither the  bishops nor canons care how the poor people live or die, for  whom nevertheless Christ has died, and who are not permitted  to hear Him speak with them as the true Shepherd with His  sheep. This causes me to shudder and fear that at some time He  may send a council of angels upon Germany utterly destroying  us, like Sodom and Gomorrah, because we so wantonly mock Him  with the Council.    Besides such necessary ecclesiastical affairs, there would be  also in the political estate innumerable matters of great  importance to improve. There is the disagreement between the  princes and the states; usury and avarice have burst in like a  flood, and have become lawful [are defended with a show of  right]; wantonness, lewdness, extravagance in dress, gluttony,  gambling, idle display, with all kinds of bad habits and  wickedness, insubordination of subjects, of domestics and  laborers of every trade, also the exactions [and most  exorbitant selling prices] of the peasants (and who can  enumerate all?) have so increased that they cannot be  rectified by ten Councils and twenty Diets. If such chief  matters of the spiritual and worldly estates as are contrary  to God would be considered in the Council, they would have all  hands so full that the child's play and absurdity of long  gowns [official insignia], large tonsures, broad cinctures [or  sashes], bishops' or cardinals' hats or maces, and like  jugglery would in the mean time be forgotten. If we first had  performed God's command and order in the spiritual and secular  estate we would find time enough to reform food, clothing,  tonsures, and surplices. But if we want to swallow such  camels, and, instead, strain at gnats, let the beams stand and  judge the motes, we also might indeed be satisfied with the  Council.    Therefore I have presented few articles; for we have without  this so many commands of God to observe in the Church, the  state and the family that we can never fulfil them. What,  then, is the use, or what does it profit that many decrees and  statutes thereon are made in the Council, especially when  these chief matters commanded of God are neither regarded nor  observed? Just as though He were bound to honor our jugglery  as a reward of our treading His solemn commandments under  foot. But our sins weigh upon us and cause God not to be  gracious to us; for we do not repent, and, besides, wish to  defend every abomination.    O Lord Jesus Christ, do Thou Thyself convoke a Council, and  deliver Thy servants by Thy glorious advent! The Pope and his  adherents are done for; they will have none of Thee. Do Thou,  then, help us, who are poor and needy, who sigh to Thee, and  beseech Thee earnestly, according to the grace which Thou hast  given us, through Thy Holy Ghost who liveth and reigneth with  Thee and the Father, blessed forever. Amen.          THE FIRST PART    Treats of the Sublime Articles Concerning the Divine Majesty,  as:    I.  That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three distinct persons in  one divine essence and nature, are one God, who has created  heaven and earth.    II.  That the Father is begotten of no one; the Son of the Father;  the Holy Ghost proceeds from Father and Son.    III.  That not the Father nor the Holy Ghost but the Son became man.    IV.  That the Son became man in this manner, that He was conceived,  without the cooperation of man, by the Holy Ghost, and was  born of the pure, holy [and always] Virgin Mary. Afterwards He  suffered, died, was buried, descended to hell, rose from the  dead, ascended to heaven, sits at the right hand of God, will  come to judge the quick and the dead, etc. as the Creed of the  Apostles, as well as that of St. Athanasius, and the Catechism  in common use for children, teach.    Concerning these articles there is no contention or dispute,  since we on both sides confess them. Therefore it is not  necessary now to treat further of them.          THE SECOND PART    Treats of the Articles which Refer to  the Office and Work of Jesus Christ,  or Our Redemption.

Her wont has been to show the narrow way       Wherein must tread the world, the bright, the brave,       From infancy to dotard's gloomy grave._         _\"Obey! Obey!\" with sternness she commands       The high, the low, in great or little lands.       She folds us all within her ample gown.       A forward act is met with angry frown._         _The lisping babes are taught her local speech;       Her gait to walk; her blessings to beseech.       They laugh or cry, as Mistress says they may,--       In everything the little tots obey._         _The youth know naught save Mrs. Grundy's whims.       They play her games. They sing her holy hymns.       They question not; accept both truth and fiction,_       _(The_ OLD _is right, within her jurisdiction!)._         _Maid, matron, man unto her meekly bow.       She with contempt or ridicule may cow.       They dare not speak, or dress, or love, or hate,       At variance with the program on her slate._         _Her subtle smile, e'en men to thinkers grown,       Are loath to lose; before its charm they're prone.       With great ado, they publicly conform--       Vain, cowards, vain; revolt_ MUST _raise a storm!_         _The \"indiscreet,\" when hidden from her sight,       Attempt to live as they consider \"right.\"       Lo! Walls have ears! The loyal everywhere       The searchlight turn, and loudly shout, \"Beware!\"_         _In tyranny the Mistress is supreme.       \"Obedience,\" that is her endless theme.       Al countries o'er, in city, town and glen,       Her aid is sought by bosses over men._         _Of Greed, her brain is cunningly devised.       From Ignorance, her bulky body's sized.       When at her ease, she acts as judge and jury.       But she's the Mob when 'roused to fighting fury._         _Dame Grundy is, by far, the fiercest foe       To ev'ry kind of progress, that we know.       So Freedom is, to her, a poison thing.       Who heralds it, he must her death knell ring._      [Illustration]          A GREETING.    By ALEXANDER BERKMAN.      Dear Friends:--    I am happy, inexpressibly happy to be in your midst again, after an  absence of fourteen long years, passed amid the horrors and darkness of  my Pennsylvania nightmare. * * * Methinks the days of miracles are not  past. They say that nineteen hundred years ago a man was raised from the  dead after having been buried for three days. They call it a great  miracle. But I think the resurrection from the peaceful slumber of a  three days' grave is not nearly so miraculous as the actual coming back  to life from a living death of fourteen years duration;--'tis the  twentieth century resurrection, not based on ignorant credulity, nor  assisted by any Oriental jugglery. No travelers ever return, the poets  say, from the Land of Shades beyond the river Styx--and may be it is a  good thing for them that they don't--but you can see that there is an  occasional exception even to that rule, for I have just returned from a  hell, the like of which, for human brutality and fiendish barbarity, is  not to be found even in the fire-and-brimstone creeds of our loving  Christians.    It was a moment of supreme joy when I felt the heavy chains, that had  bound me so long, give way with the final clang of the iron doors behind  me and I suddenly found myself transported, as it were, from the dreary  night of my prison-existence into the warm sunshine of the living day;  and then, as I breathed the free air of the beautiful May morning--my  first breath of freedom in fourteen years--it seemed to me as if a  beautiful nature had waved her magic wand and marshalled her most  alluring charms to welcome me into the world again; the sun, bathed in a  sea of sapphire, seemed to shed his golden-winged caresses upon me;  beautiful birds were intoning a sweet paean of joyful welcome;  green-clad trees on the banks of the Allegheny were stretching out to me  a hundred emerald arms, and every little blade of grass seemed to lift  its head and nod to me, and all Nature whispered sweetly \"Welcome Home!\"  It was Nature's beautiful Springtime, the reawakening of Life, and Joy,  and Hope, and the spirit of Springtime dwelt in my heart.    I had been told before I left the prison that the world had changed so  much during my long confinement that I would practically come back into  a new and different world. I hoped it were true. For at the time when I  retired from the world, or rather when I _was_ retired from the  world--that was a hundred years ago, for it happened in the nineteenth  century--at that time, I say, the footsteps of the world were faltering  under the heavy cross of oppression, injustice and misery, and I could  hear the anguish-cry of the suffering multitudes, even above the  clanking of my own heavy chains. * * * But all that is different now--I  thought as I left the prison--for have I not been told that the world  had changed, changed so much that, as they put it, \"its own mother  wouldn't know it again.\" And that thought made me _doubly_ happy: happy  at the recovery of my own liberty, and happy in the fond hope that I  should find my own great joy mirrored in, and heightened by the  happiness of my fellow-men.    Then I began to look around, and indeed, I found the world changed; so  changed, in fact, that I am now afraid to cross the street, lest  lightning, in the shape of a horseless car, overtake me and strike me  down; I also found a new race of beings, a race of red  devils--automobiles you call them--and I have been told about the winged  children of thought flying above our heads--talking through the air, you  know, and sometimes also through the hat, perhaps--and here in New York  you can ride on the ground, overground, above ground, underground, and  without any ground at all.    These and a thousand and one other inventions and discoveries have  considerably changed the face of the world. But alas! its face _only_.  For as I looked further, past the outer trappings, down into the heart  of the world, I beheld the old, familiar, yet no less revolting sight of  Mammon, enthroned upon a dais of bleeding hearts, and I saw the ruthless  wheels of the social Juggernaut slowly crushing the beautiful form of  liberty lying prostrate on the ground. * * * I saw men, women and  children, without number, sacrificed on the altar of the capitalistic  Moloch, and I beheld a race of pitiful creatures, stricken with the  modern St. Vitus's dance at the shrine of the Golden Calf.    With an aching heart I realized what I had been told in prison about  the changed condition of the world was but a miserable myth, and my fond  hope of returning into a new, regenerated world lay shattered at my  feet....    No, the world has not changed during my absence; I can find no  improvement in the twentieth-century society over that of the  nineteenth, and in truth, it is not capable of any real improvement, for  this society is the product of a civilization so self-contradictory in  its essential qualities, so stupendously absurd in its results, that the  more we advance in this would-be civilization the less rational, the  less human we become. Your twentieth-century civilization is fitly  characterized by the fact that, paradoxical as it may seem, the more we  produce, the less we have, and the richer we get, the poorer we are.  Your pseudo-civilization is of that quality which defeats its own ends,  so that notwithstanding the prodigious mechanical aids we possess in the  production of all forms of wealth, the struggle for existence is more  savage, more ferocious to-day than it has been ever since the dawn of  our civilization.    But what is the cause of all this, what is wrong with our society and  our civilization?    Simply this:--a lie can not prosper. Our whole social fabric, our  boasted civilization rests on the foundations of a lie, a most gigantic  lie--the religious, political and"]]]
