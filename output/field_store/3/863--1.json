Yet they contain the  essence of practical wisdom, set forth in admirable order and detail.  The theme, if the present interpreter be right, is the great regeneration,  the birth of the spiritual from the psychical man: the same theme  which Paul so wisely and eloquently set forth in writing to his disciples  in Corinth, the theme of all mystics in all lands.    We think of ourselves as living a purely physical life, in these material  bodies of ours. In reality, we have gone far indeed from pure physical  life; for ages, our life has been psychical, we have been centred and  immersed in the psychic nature. Some of the schools of India say that  the psychic nature is, as it were, a looking-glass, wherein are mirrored  the things seen by the physical eyes, and heard by the physical ears.  But this is a magic mirror; the images remain, and take a certain life  of their own. Thus within the psychic realm of our life there grows up  an imaged world wherein we dwell; a world of the images of things  seen and heard, and therefore a world of memories; a world also of  hopes and desires, of fears and regrets. Mental life grows up among  these images, built on a measuring and comparing, on the massing of  images together into general ideas; on the abstraction of new notions  and images from these; till a new world is built up within, full of  desires and hates, ambition, envy, longing, speculation, curiosity,  self-will, self-interest.    The teaching of the East is, that all these are true powers overlaid by  false desires; that though in manifestation psychical, they are in  essence spiritual; that the psychical man is the veil and prophecy of the  spiritual man.    The purpose of life, therefore, is the realizing of that prophecy; the  unveiling of the immortal man; the birth of the spiritual from the  psychical, whereby we enter our divine inheritance and come to  inhabit Eternity. This is, indeed, salvation, the purpose of all true  religion, in all times.    Patanjali has in mind the spiritual man, to be born from the psychical.  His purpose is, to set in order the practical means for the unveiling  and regeneration, and to indicate the fruit, the glory and the power, of  that new birth.    Through the Sutras of the first book, Patanjali is concerned with the  first great problem, the emergence of the spiritual man from the veils  and meshes of the psychic nature, the moods and vestures of the  mental and emotional man. Later will come the consideration of the  nature and powers of the spiritual man, once he stands clear of the  psychic veils and trammels, and a view of the realms in which these  new spiritual powers are to be revealed.    At this point may come a word of explanation. I have been asked why  I use the word Sutras, for these rules of Patanjali's system, when the  word Aphorism has been connected with them in our minds for a  generation. The reason is this: the name Aphorism suggests, to me at  least, a pithy sentence of very general application; a piece of  proverbial wisdom that may be quoted in a good many sets of  circumstance, and which will almost bear on its face the evidence of  its truth. But with a Sutra the case is different. It comes from the same  root as the word \"sew,\" and means, indeed, a thread, suggesting,  therefore, a close knit, consecutive chain of argument. Not only has  each Sutra a definite place in the system, but further, taken out of this  place, it will be almost meaningless, and will by no means be  self-evident. So I have thought best to adhere to the original word.  The Sutras of Patanjali are as closely knit together, as dependent on  each other, as the propositions of Euclid, and can no more be taken  out of their proper setting.    In the second part of the first book, the problem of the emergence of  the spiritual man is further dealt with. We are led to the consideration  of the barriers to his emergence, of the overcoming of the barriers,  and of certain steps and stages in the ascent from the ordinary  consciousness of practical life, to the finer, deeper, radiant  consciousness of the spiritual man.        BOOK I    1. OM: Here follows Instruction in Union.    Union, here as always in the Scriptures of India, means union of the  individual soul with the Oversoul; of the personal consciousness with  the Divine Consciousness, whereby the mortal becomes immortal, and  enters the Eternal. Therefore, salvation is, first, freedom from sin and  the sorrow which comes from sin, and then a divine and eternal  well-being, wherein the soul partakes of the being, the wisdom and  glory of God.    2. Union, spiritual consciousness, is gained through control of the  versatile psychic nature.    The goal is the full consciousness of the spiritual man, illumined by the  Divine Light. Nothing except the obdurate resistance of the psychic  nature keeps us back from the goal. The psychical powers are spiritual  powers run wild, perverted, drawn from their proper channel.  Therefore our first task is, to regain control of this perverted nature,  to chasten, purify and restore the misplaced powers.    3. Then the Seer comes to consciousness in his proper nature.    Egotism is but the perversion of spiritual being. Ambition is the  inversion of spiritual power. Passion is the distortion of love. The  mortal is the limitation of the immortal. When these false images give  place to true, then the spiritual man stands forth luminous, as the sun,  when the clouds disperse.    4. Heretofore the Seer has been enmeshed in the activities of the  psychic nature.    The power and life which are the heritage of the spiritual man have  been caught and enmeshed in psychical activities. Instead of pure  being in the Divine, there has been fretful, combative, egotism, its  hand against every man. Instead of the light of pure vision, there have  been restless senses nave been re and imaginings. Instead of spiritual  joy, the undivided joy of pure being, there has been self-indulgence of  body and mind. These are all real forces, but distorted from their true  nature and goal. They must be extricated, like gems from the matrix,  like the pith from the reed, steadily, without destructive violence.  Spiritual powers are to be drawn forth from the psychic meshes.    5. The psychic activities are five; they are either subject or not subject  to the five hindrances (Book II, 3).    The psychic nature is built up through the image-making power, the  power which lies behind and dwells in mind-pictures. These pictures  do not remain quiescent in the mind; they are kinetic, restless,  stimulating to new acts. Thus the mind-image of an indulgence  suggests and invites to a new indulgence; the picture of past joy is  framed in regrets or hopes. And there is the ceaseless play of the  desire to know, to penetrate to the essence of things, to classify. This,  too, busies itself ceaselessly with the mind-images. So that we may  classify the activities of the psychic nature thus:    6. These activities are: Sound intellection, unsound intellection,  predication, sleep, memory.    We have here a list of mental and emotional powers; of powers that  picture and observe, and of powers that picture and feel. But the  power to know and feel is spiritual and immortal. What is needed is,  not to destroy it, but to raise it from the psychical to the spiritual  realm.    7. The elements of sound intellection are: direct observation, inductive  reason, and trustworthy testimony.    Each of these is a spiritual power, thinly veiled. Direct observation is  the outermost form of the Soul's pure vision. Inductive reason rests on  the great principles of continuity and correspondence; and these, on  the supreme truth that all life is of the One. Trustworthy testimony,  the sharing of one soul in the wisdom of another, rests on the ultimate  oneness of all souls.    8. Unsound intellection is false understanding, not resting on a  perception of the true nature of things.    When the object is not truly perceived, when the observation is  inaccurate and faulty, thought or reasoning based on that mistaken  perception is of necessity false and unsound.    9. Predication is carried on through words or thoughts not resting on  an object perceived.    The purpose of this Sutra is, to distinguish between the mental process  of predication, and observation, induction or testimony. Predication  is the attribution of a quality or action to a subject, by adding to it a  predicate. In the sentence, \"the man is wise,\" \"the man\" is the subject;  \"is wise\" is the predicate. This may be simply an interplay of thoughts,  without the presence of the object thought of; or the things thought  of may be imaginary or unreal; while observation, induction and  testimony always go back to an object.    10. Sleep is the psychic condition which rests on mind states, all  material things being absent.    In waking life, we have two currents of perception; an outer current  of physical things seen and heard and perceived; an inner current of  mind-images and thoughts. The outer current ceases in sleep; the inner  current continues, and watching the mind-images float before the field  of consciousness, we \"dream.\"  Even when there are no dreams, there is  still a certain consciousness in sleep, so that, on waking, one says, \"I  have slept well,\" or \"I have slept badly.\"    11. Memory is holding to mind-images of things perceived, without  modifying them.

ARTHUR DIMOCK, M.A.    Rector of Wetherden, Suffolk                   [Illustration: _Photochrom Co. Ltd. Photo._     ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL, FROM THE SOUTH BANK OF THE THAMES.]       [Illustration: (Arms of the See)]    With XXXIX Illustrations      London George Bell & Sons 1900          PREFACE.      The MSS. relating to St. Paul's are deficient in regard to the earlier  periods, but become gradually more complete as time progresses. They  have been published or quoted, probably, more extensively than those  belonging to any other religious foundation in this country, unless it  be such communities as St. Alban's, which have attracted the continued  attention of the editors working under the Master of the Rolls. In  consequence, although our knowledge, not only of the Romano-British  period but of many succeeding centuries, is defective or altogether  wanting, yet as time advances after the Norman Conquest the merely  printed material at our disposal becomes gradually almost  embarrassing. When we come to the present Cathedral, we know not only  exactly _when_ it was built, but to a great extent _how_ and _why_.    In the _Parentalia_ Wren's grandson, Stephen, partly in his own words,  partly in those of his famous grandfather, lifting the curtain,  discloses the personal history and inner self of the architect at his  work.    Among the leading authorities are the following, giving the place of  honour to the--    _Parentalia or Memoirs. Completed by his_ [Sir Christopher's] _son,  Christopher. Now published by his grandson, Stephen Wren, Esq._  (London, 1858).    _The History of St. Paul's_, by Sir William Dugdale (Ellis' edition,  1818).    _Repertorium_, by Richard Newcourt (London, 1708).    _Radulfi de Diceto, Decani, Lundoniensis Opera Historica_ (vols. i.  and ii., edited for the Master of the Rolls by the Bishop of Oxford).    I have to thank the Dean for permission to consult the Chapter copy of  the _Registrum Statutorum_, edited for private circulation (1873) by  that enthusiastic and accurate St. Paul's scholar, the late Dr.  Sparrow-Simpson, one of the last of the Minor Canons on the old  foundation, Librarian and Sub-dean. There is a supplement (1897).    Dr. Sparrow-Simpson also wrote or edited the following--    _Documents Illustrating the History of St. Paul's Cathedral_ (Camden  Society, 1880).    _Chapters in the History of Old St. Paul's_ (1881).    _Visitation of Churches_ (Camden Society, 1885).    _Gleanings from Old St. Paul's_ (1889).    _St. Paul's and Old City Life_ (1894).    His remaining work, the Catalogue of the Library, I have not  consulted.    _Annals of St. Paul's_, by Dean Milman (1868).    The learned and talented historian did not live to see this his last  work through the press. In consequence there are printer's errors as  to dates, &c., which I have not thought it necessary to point out.    _Domesday of St. Paul's_, by Archdeacon Hale (Camden Society, 1858).    _The Three Cathedrals dedicated to St. Paul_, by William Longman  (Longmans, 1873).    Amongst other sources of information are the lectures delivered in St.  Paul's by Bishop Browne when a residentiary, and published by the  S.P.C.K. The value of these to the students of early Church History is  in an inverse ratio to their size. The origin of our secular colleges  yet remains to be written; but I am again indebted to Mr. Arthur  Francis Leach for the Introduction to the _Visitations of Southwell_  (Camden Society, 1891), for valuable information on this subject.    In regard to the efforts to complete Wren's designs by mosaic  decorations, I have carefully observed all that has been done, and  have attentively followed much that has been said and written. In  particular I have been interested by a statement that has gone the  round of the press. Certain young ladies and gentlemen of the Slade  School of Art and elsewhere are reported to have protested that even  good and appropriate decoration would be contrary to the wishes of Sir  Christopher Wren.    My thanks are due to the Dean for his courtesy and trouble in  rendering me all the assistance I asked for; to the Bishop of Oxford  (like the Bishop of Bristol, a former residentiary) for providing me  with a list of authorities at the commencement of my task; to the  librarians of All Souls' College, Oxford, and their committee, and  particularly to Mr. George Holden, assistant librarian, for permission  to use their invaluable collection of Wren's designs and drawings; to  the Archdeacon of Middlesex for information concerning the  inscriptions on the stalls; to Canon Milford, successor to Wren's  father as Rector of Bishop-Knoyle, for communicating to me the  irregularity about the registration of Wren's baptism, and for the  loan of Mrs. Lucy Phillimore's _Life and Times of Wren_, a work out of  print and not to be procured at the London Library; to Mr. Peter  Cazalet for kind assistance in drawing one of the arches and also in  describing the monuments; and if last, certainly not least, to the  ever courteous officials of the Cathedral, who have rendered me every  facility in my study of Wren's building.
