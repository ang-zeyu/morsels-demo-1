Foreword      These sketches are, I fear, very unscientific and unsystematic. They  record the growth of my own interest and information, as I have recently  observed and enjoyed the trees among which I had walked unseeing far too  many years. To pass on, as well as I can, some of the benefit that has  come into my own life from this wakened interest in the trees provided  by the Creator for the resting of tired brains and the healing of  ruffled spirits, as well as for utility, is the reason for gathering  together and somewhat extending the papers that have brought me, as they  have appeared in the pages of \"The Outlook,\" so many letters of  fellowship and appreciation from others who have often seen more clearly  and deeply into the woods than I may hope to.    Driven out from my desk by weariness sometimes--and as often, I confess,  by a rasped temper I would fain hide from display--I have never failed  to find rest, and peace, and much to see and to love, among the common  and familiar trees, to which I hope these mere hints of some of their  features not always seen may send others who also need their silent and  beneficent message.

          234             *       *       *       *       *      A Story of Some Maples      This is not a botanical disquisition; it is not a complete account of  all the members of the important tree family of maples. I am not a  botanist, nor a true scientific observer, but only a plain tree-lover,  and I have been watching some trees bloom and bud and grow and fruit for  a few years, using a camera now and then to record what I see--and much  more than I see, usually!    In the sweet springtime, when the rising of the sap incites some to  poetry, some to making maple sugar, and some to watching for the first  flowers, it is well to look at a few tree-blooms, and to consider the  possibilities and the pleasures of a peaceful hunt that can be made with  profit in city street or park, as well as along country roadsides and in  the meadows and the woods.    Who does not know of the maples that are all around us? Yet who has  seen the commonest of them bloom in very early spring, or watched the  course of the peculiar winged seed-pods or \"keys\" that follow the  flowers? The white or \"silver\" maple of streets or roadsides, the soft  maple of the woods, is one of the most familiar of American trees. Its  rapid and vigorous growth endears it to the man who is in a hurry for  shade, and its sturdy limbs are the joy of the tree-butcher who \"trims\"  them short in later years.    [Illustration: Silver maple flowers]    Watch this maple in very early spring--even before spring is any more  than a calendar probability--and a singular bloom will be found along  the slender twigs. Like little loose-haired brushes these flowers are,  coming often bravely in sleet and snow, and seemingly able to \"set\" and  fertilize regardless of the weather. They hurry through the bloom-time,  as they must do to carry out the life-round, for the graceful  two-winged seeds that follow them are picked up and whirled about by  April winds, and, if they lodge in the warming earth, are fully able to  grow into fine little trees the same season.

DICK    Illustrated by EMSH          _No weapon has ever been frightful enough to put a stop to      war--perhaps because we never before had any that thought for      themselves!_      [Illustration]      Taylor sat back in his chair reading the morning newspaper. The warm  kitchen and the smell of coffee blended with the comfort of not having  to go to work. This was his Rest Period, the first for a long time, and  he was glad of it. He folded the second section back, sighing with  contentment.    \"What is it?\" Mary said, from the stove.    \"They pasted Moscow again last night.\" Taylor nodded his head in  approval. \"Gave it a real pounding. One of those R-H bombs. It's about  time.\"    He nodded again, feeling the full comfort of the kitchen, the presence  of his plump, attractive wife, the breakfast dishes and coffee. This was  relaxation. And the war news was good, good and satisfying. He could  feel a justifiable glow at the news, a sense of pride and personal  accomplishment. After all, he was an integral part of the war program,  not just another factory worker lugging a cart of scrap, but a  technician, one of those who designed and planned the nerve-trunk of the  war.    \"It says they have the new subs almost perfected. Wait until they get  _those_ going.\" He smacked his lips with anticipation. \"When they start  shelling from underwater, the Soviets are sure going to be surprised.\"    \"They're doing a wonderful job,\" Mary agreed vaguely. \"Do you know what  we saw today? Our team is getting a leady to show to the school  children. I saw the leady, but only for a moment. It's good for the  children to see what their contributions are going for, don't you  think?\"    She looked around at him.    \"A leady,\" Taylor murmured. He put the newspaper slowly down. \"Well,  make sure it's decontaminated properly. We don't want to take any  chances.\"    \"Oh, they always bathe them when they're brought down from the surface,\"  Mary said. \"They wouldn't think of letting them down without the bath.  Would they?\" She hesitated, thinking back. \"Don, you know, it makes me  remember--\"    He nodded. \"I know.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He knew what she was thinking. Once in the very first weeks of the war,  before everyone had been evacuated from the surface, they had seen a  hospital train discharging the wounded, people who had been showered  with sleet. He remembered the way they had looked, the expression on  their faces, or as much of their faces as was left. It had not been a  pleasant sight.    There had been a lot of that at first, in the early days before the  transfer to undersurface was complete. There had been a lot, and it  hadn't been very difficult to come across it.    Taylor looked up at his wife. She was thinking too much about it, the  last few months. They all were.    \"Forget it,\" he said. \"It's all in the past. There isn't anybody up  there now but the leadys, and they don't mind.\"    \"But just the same, I hope they're careful when they let one of them  down here. If one were still hot--\"    He laughed, pushing himself away from the table. \"Forget it. This is a  wonderful moment; I'll be home for the next two shifts. Nothing to do  but sit around and take things easy. Maybe we can take in a show. Okay?\"    \"A show? Do we have to? I don't like to look at all the destruction, the  ruins. Sometimes I see some place I remember, like San Francisco. They  showed a shot of San Francisco, the bridge broken and fallen in the  water, and I got upset. I don't like to watch.\"    \"But don't you want to know what's going on? No human beings are getting  hurt, you know.\"    \"But it's so awful!\" Her face was set and strained. \"Please, no, Don.\"    Don Taylor picked up his newspaper sullenly. \"All right, but there  isn't a hell of a lot else to do. And don't forget, _their_ cities are  getting it even worse.\"    She nodded. Taylor turned the rough, thin sheets of newspaper. His good  mood had soured on him. Why did she have to fret all the time? They were  pretty well off, as things went. You couldn't expect to have everything  perfect, living undersurface, with an artificial sun and artificial  food. Naturally it was a strain, not seeing the sky or being able to go  any place or see anything other than metal walls, great roaring  factories, the plant-yards, barracks. But it was better than being on  surface. And some day it would end and they could return. Nobody  _wanted_ to live this way, but it was necessary.    He turned the page angrily and the poor paper ripped. Damn it, the paper  was getting worse quality all the time, bad print, yellow tint--    Well, they needed everything for the war program. He ought to know that.  Wasn't he one of the planners?    He excused himself and went into the other room. The bed was still  unmade. They had better get it in shape before the seventh hour  inspection. There was a one unit fine--    The vidphone rang. He halted. Who would it be? He went over and clicked  it on.    \"Taylor?\" the face said, forming into place. It was an old face, gray  and grim. \"This is Moss. I'm sorry to bother you during Rest Period, but  this thing has come up.\" He rattled papers. \"I want you to hurry over  here.\"    Taylor stiffened. \"What is it? There's no chance it could wait?\" The  calm gray eyes were studying him, expressionless, unjudging. \"If you  want me to come down to the lab,\" Taylor grumbled, \"I suppose I can.  I'll get my uniform--\"    \"No. Come as you are. And not to the lab. Meet me at second stage as  soon as possible. It'll take you about a half hour, using the fast car  up. I'll see you there.\"    The picture broke and Moss disappeared.           *       *       *       *       *    \"What was it?\" Mary said, at the door.    \"Moss. He wants me for something.\"    \"I knew this would happen.\"    \"Well, you didn't want to do anything, anyhow. What does it matter?\" His  voice was bitter. \"It's all the same, every day. I'll bring you back  something. I'm going up to second stage. Maybe I'll be close enough to  the surface to--\"    \"Don't! Don't bring me anything! Not from the surface!\"    \"All right, I won't. But of all the irrational nonsense--\"    She watched him put on his boots without answering.           *       *       *       *       *    Moss nodded and Taylor fell in step with him, as the older man strode  along. A series of loads were going up to the surface, blind cars  clanking like ore-trucks up the ramp, disappearing through the stage  trap above them. Taylor watched the cars, heavy with tubular machinery  of some sort, weapons new to him. Workers were everywhere, in the dark  gray uniforms of the labor corps, loading, lifting, shouting back and  forth. The stage was deafening with noise.    \"We'll go up a way,\" Moss said, \"where we can talk. This is no place to  give you details.\"    They took an escalator up. The commercial lift fell behind them, and  with it most of the crashing and booming. Soon they emerged on an  observation platform, suspended on the side of the Tube, the vast tunnel  leading to the surface, not more than half a mile above them now.    \"My God!\" Taylor said, looking down the Tube involuntarily. \"It's a long  way down.\"    Moss laughed. \"Don't look.\"    They opened a door and entered an office. Behind the desk, an officer  was sitting, an officer of Internal Security. He looked up.    \"I'll be right with you, Moss.\" He gazed at Taylor studying him. \"You're  a little ahead of time.\"    \"This is Commander Franks,\" Moss said to Taylor. \"He was the first to  make the discovery. I was notified last night.\" He tapped a parcel he  carried. \"I was let in because of this.\"    Franks frowned at him and stood up. \"We're going up to first stage. We  can discuss it there.\"    \"First stage?\" Taylor repeated nervously. The three of them went down a  side passage to a small lift. \"I've never been up there. Is it all  right? It's not radioactive, is it?\"    \"You're like everyone else,\" Franks said. \"Old women afraid of burglars.  No radiation leaks down to first stage. There's lead and rock, and what  comes down the Tube is bathed.\"    \"What's the nature of the problem?\" Taylor asked. \"I'd like to know  something about it.\"    \"In a moment.\"    They entered the lift and ascended. When they stepped out, they were in  a hall of soldiers, weapons and uniforms everywhere. Taylor blinked in  surprise. So this was first stage, the closest undersurface level to the  top!
