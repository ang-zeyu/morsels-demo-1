For, hitherto, I had been, as it were, wearing costume in  literature. The rich, figured English of the earlier part of the  seventeenth century had always had a peculiar attraction for me. I  accustomed myself to write in it, to think in it; I kept a diary in that  manner, and half-unconsciously dressed up my every day thoughts and  common experiences in the habit of the Cavalier or of the Caroline  Divine. Thus, when in 1884 I got a commission to translate the  Heptameron, I wrote quite naturally in the language of my favourite  period, and, as some critics declare, made my English version somewhat  more antique and stiff than the original. And so \"The Anatomy of  Tobacco\" was an exercise in the antique of a different kind; and \"The  Chronicle of Clemendy\" was a volume of tales that tried their hardest to  be mediaeval; and the translation of the \"Moyen de Parvenir\" was still a  thing in the ancient mode._    _It seemed, in fine, to be settled that in literature I was to be a  hanger on of the past ages; and I don't quite know how I managed to get  away from them. I had finished translating \"Casanova\"--more modern, but  not thoroughly up to date--and I had nothing particular on hand, and,  somehow or other, it struck me that I might try a little writing for the  papers. I began with a \"turnover\" as it was called, for the old vanished  Globe, a harmless little article on old English proverbs; and I shall  never forget my pride and delight when one day, being at Dover, with a  fresh autumn wind blowing from the sea, I bought a chance copy of the  paper and saw my essay on the front page. Naturally, I was encouraged to  persevere, and I wrote more turnovers for the Globe and then tried the  St. James's Gazette and found that they paid two pounds instead of the  guinea of the Globe, and again, naturally enough, devoted most of my  attention to the St. James's Gazette. From the essay or literary paper,  I somehow got into the habit of the short story, and did a good many of  these, still for the St. James's, till in the autumn of 1890, I wrote a  tale called \"The Double Return.\" Well, Oscar Wilde asked: \"Are you the  author of that story that fluttered the dovecotes? I thought it was very  good.\" But: it did flutter the dovecotes, and the St. James's Gazette  and I parted._    _But I still wrote short stories, now chiefly for what were called  \"society\" papers, which have become extinct. And one of these appeared  in a paper, the name of which I have long forgotten. I had called the  tale \"Resurrectio Mortuorum,\" and the editor had very sensibly rendered  the title into \"The Resurrection of the Dead.\"_    _I do not clearly remember how the story began. I am inclined to think  something in this way:_    _\"Old Mr. Llewellyn, the Welsh antiquary, threw his copy of the morning  paper on the floor and banged the breakfast-table, exclaiming: 'Good  God! Here's the last of the Caradocs of the Garth, has been married in  a Baptist Chapel by a dissenting preacher; somewhere in Peckham.'\" Or,  did I take up the tale a few years after this happy event and shew the  perfectly cheerful contented young commercial clerk running somewhat too  fast to catch the bus one morning, and feeling dazed all day long over  the office work, and going home in a sort of dimness, and then at his  very doorstep, recovering as it were, his ancestral consciousness. I  think it was the sight of his wife and the tones of her voice that  suddenly announced to him with the sound of a trumpet that he had  nothing to do with this woman with the Cockney accent, or the pastor who  was coming to supper, or the red brick villa, or Peckham or the City of  London. Though the old place on the banks of the Usk had been sold fifty  years before, still, he was Caradoc of the Garth. I forget how I ended  the story: but here was one of the sources of \"A Fragment of Life.\"_    _And somehow, though the tale was written and printed and paid for; it  stayed with me as a tale half told in the years from 1890 to 1899. I was  in love with the notion: this contrast between the raw London suburb and  its mean limited life and its daily journeys to the City; its utter  banality and lack of significance; between all this and the old, grey  mullioned house under the forest near the river, the armorial bearings  on the Jacobean porch, and noble old traditions: all this captivated me  and I thought of my mistold tale at intervals, while I was writing \"The  Great God Pan,\" \"The Red Hand,\" \"The Three Impostors,\" \"The Hill of  Dreams,\" \"The White People,\" and \"Hieroglyphics.\" It was at the back of  my head, I suppose, all the time, and at last in '99 I began to write  it all over again from a somewhat different standpoint._    _The fact was that one grey Sunday afternoon in the March of that year,  I went for a long walk with a friend. I was living in Gray's Inn in  those days, and we stravaged up Gray's Inn Road on one of those queer,  unscientific explorations of the odd corners of London in which I have  always delighted. I don't think that there was any definite scheme laid  down; but we resisted manifold temptations. For on the right of Gray's  Inn Road is one of the oddest quarters of London--to those, that is,  with the unsealed eyes. Here are streets of 1800-1820 that go down into  a valley--Flora in \"Little Dorrit\" lived in one of them--and then  crossing King's Cross Road climb very steeply up to heights which always  suggest to me that I am in the hinder and poorer quarter of some big  seaside place, and that there is a fine view of the sea from the attic  windows. This place was once called Spa Fields, and has very properly an  old meeting house of the Countess of Huntingdon's Connection as one of  its attractions. It is one of the parts of London which would attract me  if I wished to hide; not to escape arrest, perhaps, but rather to escape  the possibility of ever meeting anybody who had ever seen me before._    _But: my friend and I resisted it all. We strolled along to the parting  of many ways at King's Cross Station, and struck boldly up Pentonville.  Again: on our left was Barnsbury, which is like Africa. In Barnsbury  semper aliquid novi, but our course was laid for us by some occult  influence, and we came to Islington and chose the right hand side of the  way. So far, we were tolerably in the region of the known, since every  year there is the great Cattle Show at Islington, and many men go there.  But, trending to the right, we got into Canonbury, of which there are  only Travellers' Tales. Now and then, perhaps, as one sits about the  winter fire, while the storm howls without and the snow falls fast, the  silent man in the corner has told how he had a great aunt who lived in  Canonbury in 1860; so in the fourteenth century you might meet men who  had talked with those who had been in Cathay and had seen the splendours  of the Grand Cham. Such is Canonbury; I hardly dare speak of its dim  squares, of the deep, leafy back-gardens behind the houses, running down  into obscure alleyways with discreet, mysterious postern doors: as I  say, \"Travellers' Tales\"; things not much credited._    _But, he who adventures in London has a foretaste of infinity. There is  a region beyond Ultima Thule. I know not how it was, but on this famous  Sunday afternoon, my friend and I, passing through Canonbury came into  something called the Balls Pond Road--Mr. Perch, the messenger of Dombey  & Son, lived somewhere in this region--and so I think by Dalston down  into Hackney where caravans, or trams, or, as I think you say in  America, trolley cars set out at stated intervals to the limits of the  western world._    _But in the course of that walk which had become an exploration of the  unknown, I had seen two common things which had made a profound  impression upon me. One of these things was a street, the other a small  family party. The street was somewhere in that vague, uncharted, Balls  Pond-Dalston region. It was a long street and a grey street. Each house  was exactly like every other house. Each house had a basement, the sort  of story which house-agents have grown to call of late a \"lower ground  floor.\" The front windows of these basements were half above the patch  of black, soot-smeared soil and coarse grass that named itself a garden,  and so, passing along at the hour of four o'clock or four-thirty, I  could see that in everyone of these \"breakfast rooms\"--their technical  name--the tea tray and the tea cups were set out in readiness. I  received from this trivial and natural circumstance an impression of a  dull life, laid out in dreadful lines of patterned uniformity, of a life  without adventure of body or soul._    _Then, the family party. It got into the tram down Hackney way. There  were father, mother and baby; and I should think that they came from a  small shop, probably from a small draper's shop. The parents were young  people of twenty-five to thirty-five. He wore a black shiny frock  coat--an \"Albert\" in America?--a high hat,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25023"],[0,"The Biography of a Grizzly (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  https://www.pgdp.net                Transcriber's Note:      Inconsistent spelling used in the original has been retained.

[Illustration]              THE GRIZZLY      Nearly half a century has gone since I lived among these scenes and made my  observations on the grand Old Bear of the Mountains.    Many new conditions have in that time developed, have changed the course of  history. But the biggest, saddest change of all is that the Grizzly Bear,  the most magnificent, dignified, and powerful beast of the wild, heroic  West, is gone.    There may be a few individuals about Yellowstone Park or other great  havens, but the Grizzly Bear as the wide-wandering monarch of the hills has  gone the way of the Dodo.    It is just possible that in this last and latest time a newborn strong and  growing sentiment will come to the rescue, will prompt us to seek out and  preserve the last remnant, just as long-belated appreciation came at final  stance to save for later generations the Great Sequoia Tree, when man's  blind avarice had all but wiped it out. Good men are now at work with  better thoughts, and reverence for the masterpieces, the giants of  creation's world. It may be that this newer thought may come in force and  save the grand old Bear while yet it curbs his power for harm. This is my  hope and prayer; this is the sentiment unwritten, but expressed, in my  Story of the Grizzly.

His Mother was just an ordinary Silvertip, living the quiet life that all  Bears prefer, minding her own business and doing her duty by her family,  asking no favors of any one excepting to let her alone.    It was July before she took her remarkable family down the Little Piney to  the Graybull, and showed them what strawberries were, and where to find  them.    Notwithstanding their Mother's deep conviction, the cubs were not  remarkably big or bright; yet they were a remarkable family, for there were  four of them, and it is not often a Grizzly Mother can boast of more than  two.        [Illustration]    The woolly-coated little creatures were having a fine time, and reveled in  the lovely mountain summer and the abundance of good things. Their Mother  turned over each log and flat stone they came to, and the moment it was  lifted they all rushed under it like a lot of little pigs to lick up the  ants and grubs there hidden.        [Illustration: \"THEY ALL RUSHED UNDER IT LIKE A LOT OF LITTLE PIGS.\"]    It never once occurred to them that Mammy's strength might fail sometime,  and let the great rock drop just as they got under it; nor would any one  have thought so that might have chanced to see that huge arm and that  shoulder sliding about under the great yellow robe she wore. No, no; that  arm could never fail. The little ones were quite right. So they hustled and  tumbled one another at each fresh log in their haste to be first, and  squealed little squeals, and growled little growls, as if each was a pig, a  pup, and a kitten all rolled into one.    They were well acquainted with the common little brown ants that harbor  under logs in the uplands, but now they came for the first time on one of  the hills of the great, fat, luscious Wood-ant, and they all crowded around  to lick up those that ran out. But they soon found that they were licking  up more cactus-prickles and sand than ants, till their Mother said in  Grizzly, \"Let me show you how.\"    She knocked off the top of the hill, then laid her great paw flat on it for  a few moments, and as the angry ants swarmed on to it she licked them up  with one lick, and got a good rich mouthful to crunch without a grain of  sand or a cactus-stinger in it. The cubs soon learned. Each put up both his  little brown paws, so that there was a ring of paws all around the  ant-hill, and there they sat, like children playing \"hands,\" and each  licked first the right and then the left paw, or one cuffed his brother's  ears for licking a paw that was not his own, till the ant-hill was cleared  out and they were ready for a change.        [Illustration: \"LIKE CHILDREN PLAYING 'HANDS.'\"]    Ants are sour food and made the Bears thirsty, so the old one led down to  the river. After they had drunk as much as they wanted, and dabbled their  feet, they walked down the bank to a pool, where the old one's keen eye  caught sight of a number of Buffalo-fish basking on the bottom. The water  was very low, mere pebbly rapids between these deep holes, so Mammy said to  the little ones:    \"Now you all sit there on the bank and learn something new.\"        [Illustration]    First she went to the lower end of the pool and stirred up a cloud of mud  which hung in the still water, and sent a long tail floating like a curtain  over the rapids just below. Then she went quietly round by land, and sprang  into the upper end of the pool with all the noise she could. The fish had  crowded to that end, but this sudden attack sent them off in a panic, and  they dashed blindly into the mud-cloud. Out of fifty fish there is always a  good chance of some being fools, and half a dozen of these dashed through  the darkened water into the current, and before they knew it they were  struggling over the shingly shallow. The old Grizzly jerked them out to the  bank, and the little ones rushed noisily on these funny, short snakes that  could not get away, and gobbled and gorged till their little bellies looked  like balloons.    They had eaten so much now, and the sun was so hot, that all were quite  sleepy. So the Mother-bear led them to a quiet little nook, and as soon as  she lay down, though they were puffing with heat, they all snuggled around  her and went to sleep, with their little brown paws curled in, and their  little black noses tucked into their wool as though it were a very cold  day.        [Illustration]    After an hour or two they began to yawn and stretch themselves, except  little Fuzz, the smallest; she poked out her sharp nose for a moment, then  snuggled back between her Mother's great arms, for she was a gentle,  petted little thing. The largest, the one afterward known as Wahb, sprawled  over on his back and began to worry a root that stuck up, grumbling to  himself as he chewed it, or slapped it with his paw for not staying where  he wanted it. Presently Mooney, the mischief, began tugging at Frizzle's  ears, and got his own well boxed. They clenched for a tussle; then, locked  in a tight, little grizzly yellow ball, they sprawled over and over on the  grass, and, before they knew it, down a bank, and away out of sight toward  the river.        [Illustration]    Almost immediately there was an outcry of yells for help from the little  wrestlers. There could be no mistaking the real terror in their voices.  Some dreadful danger was threatening.    Up jumped the gentle Mother, changed into a perfect demon, and over the  bank in time to see a huge Range-bull make a deadly charge at what he  doubtless took for a yellow dog. In a moment all would have been over with  Frizzle, for he had missed his footing on the bank; but there was a  thumping of heavy feet, a roar that startled even the great Bull, and, like  a huge bounding ball of yellow fur, Mother Grizzly was upon him. Him! the  monarch of the herd, the master of all these plains, what had he to fear?  He bellowed his deep war-cry, and charged to pin the old one to the bank;  but as he bent to tear her with his shining horns, she dealt him a stunning  blow, and before he could recover she was on his shoulders, raking the  flesh from his ribs with sweep after sweep of her terrific claws.
