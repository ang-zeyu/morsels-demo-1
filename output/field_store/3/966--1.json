Scientific and Religious Journal.    VOL. 1. OCTOBER, 1880. NO. 10.          LAW AND ATONEMENT.         \"The soul that sinneth it shall die,\" and it \"shall not die.\"      The first quotation, \"The soul that sinneth it shall die,\" is often  produced in support of the scholastic idea that the law of God was  inexorable, that is absolute or unconditional, not to be moved or its  penalty escaped by reformation or petition.    The language of the text is very definite, and, when viewed aside from  its context as an inexorable law, it certainly follows that every  sinning soul must pay its penalty. Neither can I see how it can be  satisfied by punishing an innocent person in the room of the guilty, for  the innocent one was not the \"soul that sinned.\" Yet this quality of law  is claimed in order to make out the theory of a vicarious punishment  endured by the Savior, that is, that He took the sinner's \"law place.\"  This idea was necessitated by the theory that we all sinned when Adam  transgressed, and lost all ability to do anything for ourselves. So we  must be redeemed by satisfaction to justice, rather than by mercy. This  old Calvinistic system of error lays the penalty of the inexorable law  upon Christ. But Calvinists are not alone in this theory of a \"vicarious  punishment,\" in order to a vicarious atonement. Neither are they alone  in the abuse of the phrase \"the law,\" for our Sabbatarian friends are  constantly asserting that the law of God was, and is, simply the ten  commandments given, they say, to Adam in Eden, and authoritatively  published on Sinai. They assert that all the balance of the five books  of Moses was his law, written by him, but the record justifies us in  saying, that the ten precepts were not the tenth part of the words given  to Moses upon Sinai; neither were they all the words that were written  upon the tables of stone. The tables begin with the sixth verse of the  fifth chapter of the book of Deuteronomy, in these words, \"I am the Lord  thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of  bondage,\" and end with the twenty-first verse. But as the sixth verse is  fatal to the Sabbatarian theory it is clipped off along with the  fifteenth verse, which is cut out of the middle of the matter written  upon the tables, and both are gravely divorced from God and handed over  to Moses. Both, however, are in perfect harmony with the second and  third verses, which read thus: \"The Lord our God made a covenant with us  in Horeb. The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us,  even us, who are all of us here alive this day.\" That the sixth and  fifteenth verses were upon the tables of stone is evident from the  reading of the twenty-second verse, which reads thus: \"These words the  Lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the  fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice. And  He wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto you.\"    Many persons who claim that the import of the term die, in the sentence  \"The soul that sinneth it shall die,\" was experienced by the Savior upon  the cross dying as a substitute in the law-place of sinners, overlook  several things of first importance. First, infants were not included in  the provisions of a vicarious punishment and atonement unless it can be  shown that they sinned--were sinners. Second, no innocent person can  justly suffer in the law-place of the guilty. In all such cases justice  is dishonored and law violated, for just law limits its penalties to the  guilty.    Our salvation \"is not of the law,\" but \"by grace\" or favor. Law had  nothing to do with the death of Christ. He, \"BY THE GRACE OF GOD, tasted  death for every man.\" \"If it be of the law it is not of grace.\" Again,  the simple sentence, \"The soul that sinneth it shall die,\" never was  _the law_ of God in any age, but simply a fraction of the law. Did  Christ ever sin? No! Then He never honored this law, or satisfied its  penalty by dying; for if, as our friends say, the inexorable quality of  the law will forever hold the guilty to its claims, it will forever keep  the innocent from its penalty. But I aver that the inexorable quality  _that is claimed_ for the law of God never belonged to it. No, not even  to the simple sentence, \"The soul that sinneth it shall die.\" The Lord  authorizes us to supply the condition in every instance where it is not  expressed, thus: \"When I shall say unto the wicked, thou shalt surely  die; if he turn from his sin and do that which is lawful and right; if  the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in  the statutes of life, without committing iniquity, he shall surely live,  _he shall not die_.\" So the prophet gives us the second quotation at the  head of this article, \"_Shall not die._\" It would be just as proper to  make this last scrap of the law inexorable as its opposite. Such  teachings do violence to the truth by overlooking the merciful  provisions that are found in the laws of God, by holding inexorable law  before us as a streak of justice clothed with _black vengeance_.    The gospel of Jesus Christ knows no law in connection with Christians,  or any others, except, first, the laws of nature. Secondly, the laws of  the state or government in which we reside. Third, the law of Christ. We  are under law to Christ in common with all men, for the Father had put  all things under Him. We were never under the law given to Adam. We were  not in the garden of Eden. We believe with Paul that the first offense  in the history of mankind was the \"_offense of one_,\" that it was \"_one  that sinned_,\" that \"_by one man's offense_ death reigned,\" that it was  \"one man's disobedience.\" When men talk to me as an individual, and of  my relations to law, sin and death, I wish them to recollect that I was  never in the garden of Eden. So I claim an alibi. Adam sinned thousands  of years before I, as a man, had my existence; and as it is true that,  where there is no law there is no transgression, so it is equally true  that, where the man is not, he does not transgress. I was not in the  garden of Eden, so there I did not sin.    But we are told that the Father of mercies, by a decree of law, imputed  Adam's offense to all his children, and that he, by the vicarious  punishment endured by the Savior, took Adam's offense off from Adam's  children.    Admit it, and three things follow: First, we did not sin in fact when  Adam sinned. Second, from Adam to Christ all the innocents upon earth  were sinners by the arbitrary decree of Jehovah. Third, the Father put  this _decree-load_ of guilt upon an innocent one, and executed the real  penalty upon him. How is this? Suppose a legislative body legislates a  man a murderer because his great great grand-father killed a man, should  it not also legislate him free from the penalty of murder and never in  cruel injustice inflict it upon him or any other innocent one simply as  a satisfaction to justice? Law ought to always place us where we are in  fact, otherwise it is detestably unjust. Why should any sensible man  attribute such dealings to the Father of Spirits? The fallacy of such  teaching is seen in the fact that the penalty of the Adamic law was  executed _in the day of the transgression_, and not nine hundred nor  thousands of years afterwards. The phrase, \"Dying thou shalt die\" does  not help the case, for the phrase \"In the day\" limits the penalty as  respects the time of its fulfillment.    Adam lost citizen life in the Garden of Eden in the very day of his  offense. The full penalty was executed when he was driven out. Physical  death was an after result, growing out of the fact that Adam's posterity  was unborn when he was driven from his Eden home. The Lord did not say  to Adam, in the day thou eatest thereof you shall die and not live  again, if he had the way of redemption would have been forever closed  against him. Adam's first sons appear before us with a law of faith,  embracing typical and sacrificial duties, through which they were  brought into the way of life with reference to an ultimate arrival at  the tree of life in the midst of the paradise of God.    This law of faith was given to Adam's family outside of the Garden; and  the law of Sinai was not given to Adam, nor to his immediate posterity,  for in that case Cain would have been put to death for killing his  brother Abel. It was given to Abraham's family after the exodus from  Egypt. It was a political law, because it pertained to a community.    Next in order follows the law of Christ. Beside these we know of no  revealed law, excepting those of which we have spoken. So this vicarious  punishment system of things, with all its consequences, rests upon a  something that men call the inexorable law of God, which a man can not  find in the annals of creation, providence or redemption. The prophet,  in the language of our quotation, \"The soul that sinneth it shall die,\"  is grappling with the system of things which we are endeavoring to  overthrow. The children of Israel fell into the sentiments of our modern  Calvinists, and claimed that \"The fathers had eaten sour grapes, and the  children's teeth were set on edge.\" By this proverb they understood that  the son was to bear the iniquity of the father. The Lord rebuked them in  the language of our topic, and more severely in the context. [See  Ezekiel, eighteenth chapter.]    The Lord said to them, \"Behold, all souls are mine. * * * The soul that  sinneth it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father,  neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son.\"    The prophet also describes a righteous man, and then adds, \"If he begets  a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doth the like to  any one of these things, and doth none of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28677"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume I, No. (#1)"],[1,"was produced from scanned images of public domain  material from the Google Print project.)                Scientific and Religious Journal.    VOL. I.    NOVEMBER, 1880.    NO. 11.          THE LIFE AND CHARACTER OF OUR RELIGION.      The character which the gospel of Christ requires is made up of all that  is lovely, is formed upon the highest model, but it is not composed of  the insensibility, the anger, the pride, the egotism, the worldliness,  which is so common among men. It is not the cold indifference of modern  moralists; it is not the rank and scepticism of modern doubters, nor yet  the intellectual rashness and moral phantoms of modern scientists. These  have done all they could to take possession of the human heart, and have  left it more miserable than it was before. The great author of our holy  religion, through the instrumentality of our blessed Savior, brings us  into the possession of his own spirit; imparts to us the elements of his  own divine excellence; forms us anew in his own image. The idea of  \"Emanuel, God with us,\" is composed of the richest elements. It embraces  all that is venerable in wisdom, wonderful in authority, and touching in  goodness. Human greatness, blended with imperfections and many  limitations, is seen only in detached and separate parts; never appears  in any one character whole and entire; but in our Lord Jesus Christ  these conceptions, or scattered rays of an ideal excellence, are brought  together and constitute the real attributes of that Savior whom we  worship, who stands in the nearest relation to us, who is the \"head of  all principality and power,\" and who pervades all nature with his  presence. The object of the Christian religion is to recover man from  his degraded, miserable condition, elevate him above his debasement, and  reinvest him with the character of Christ, that he may eventually dwell  with the angels in the perfections of the Infinite One.    The views and spirit transfused into the soul of the Christian are very  different from the views and spirit of the world. The spirit of the  world is pride and selfishness, the pride of rank and office, the pride  of wealth and worldly accomplishments, which lives for the praise of  men. On the contrary, the Savior imparts to all his worshipers the  loveliest of all the graces, a heaven-born humility, a modest estimate  of one's own worth, and a deep sense of unworthiness on account of human  weakness. As Christians we learn to humble ourselves in view of the  majesty and perfections of our heavenly Master. \"Before honor is  humility.\" The Savior commands an humble religion; its love is humble,  its faith is humble; its repentance, its baptism, its hopes, its joys,  its raptures are all humble. True greatness is not found except in an  humble mind; never is an archangel more exalted, more truly great, than  when he bows before the throne of Christ. The spirit of the world is  self-will and insubordination, hard-heartedness and impenitence, or  inflexible perseverance in sin. The spirit of the world is one of  self-indulgence and guilty pleasure. Sinners are lovers of pleasure more  than lovers of God. They are eager for enjoyment and obtain it in  dissipated behavior, thought and feeling. Lawless pleasure is the idol  of the sinner's heart and the rule of his life; it often leads him to  shame, infamy and ruin. The religion of Christ gives, in the place of  this, the love of God and duty. The pleasures of the Christian are much  broader and brighter than the pleasures of the disobedient; they are far  superior to the sinner's day dreams and pleasures of sense. The spirit  of the world rejects the truth of God; distrusts his word; has not  sufficient confidence in his declarations, or, it may be, love for his  praises, and so leans upon self, having no wants, fears, or despondency  which it does not presume to relieve for itself. And often it happens  when corruptions, doubts and disobedience have kept rule until the poor  man is ruined and the hope of a better day is literally exhausted, that  the soul under the dominion of sin cries, \"Lord, save, or I perish.\"  Have you faith in God and in his word? then let unshaken confidence in  Jesus Christ his son and our Savior become the great principle and  impulse of action, rise up in the dignity of true manhood or womanhood  and obey the gospel and live. It is hard to conceive of a darker, deeper  chasm than that which would be made by the absence of this great  principle and impulse of action which has formed thousands of characters  in the image of the Redeemer.    Let no one suppose that the obligation to live a Christian life is a  light one. Holiness is the highest attainment of a rational soul; it is  the greatest good within the reach of man; it is the greatest good in  the universe. Seek this, it is most sublime and excellent; seek to be  virtuous and holy that your hearts may be won and subdued by the power  of His own word. \"Purify your souls in obeying the truth.\" There is  nothing in the universe that can be a substitute for purity or holiness,  it is an indispensable qualification for the heavenly world. O, when  will men _understand_ and _realize_ that nothing possesses importance  compared with this which relates to God and eternity. Never was there  stronger evidence of folly than that man presents who chooses this world  for his portion. If tears could quench the fires of torment they would  be quenched at the remembrance of the folly which preferred this world's  goods to the salvation of the soul. There is nothing upon earth that  hurts the true-hearted, energetic Christian like the indifference with  which those who have hope toward God are directing their way toward that  \"exceeding and eternal weight of glory.\"    In a short time we shall pass through the tomb. To-day we are floating  upon the stream, to-morrow we may be floating upon the ocean of  eternity. Another step and we have entered on the world of retribution,  but what retribution is it? Is it the world of peace and joy? or is it  the region of tribulation and anguish? \"To those who by patient  continuance in _well-doing_, seek for glory and honor and  immortality--eternal life. But to those who are contentious and obey not  the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, tribulation  and anguish, upon every soul of man that doth evil.\" Is it not a  melancholy state of being to be gliding down the stream of time under  the fearful uncertainty whether we will land in the realms of bliss or  the regions of anguish? You may be happy without power above your  fellows, without influence over them, without great learning, without  wealth, but you can not be happy without God. Give man all of this world  that he desires, multiply around him the gratifications of sense and the  pleasures of thought, and if God is not his joy and refuge the day is  not far distant when he will feel as did the poor prodigal in a far  country feeding upon husks in nakedness and want; but if you are a  Christian you dwell with God in Christ, for \"God is in Christ  reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing unto them their  trespasses,\" and if any man be in Christ he is a new creature. Whosoever  abideth in him sinneth not--doth not serve sin. Nothing can make you  _miserable_ while you enjoy the presence of God. If you have accepted  the Savior as \"Emanuel, God with us,\" as \"God manifested in the flesh,\"  and have entered into him, you are at home with God--with the Father of  your spirit--and why should you not be happy? \"In him (Christ) all  fullness dwells.\" God is there. Paul says, \"All the promise of God in  him are yea, and in him amen unto the glory of God by us.\" \"It pleased  the Father that _in him_ all fullness should dwell.\" Are you in him? He  says, \"I am the door, by me if any man enter the same shall be saved,\"  but the door was never known to be of any use to the man who passes by  it. It is only of importance to those who enter. Have you no interest in  this open door? It was said to a very needy people, \"See, I have set  before thee an open door, and no man can shut it.\" God is in Christ,  Christ is the great doorway to the Father's house. He says, \"I am the  way; no man cometh unto the Father but by me.\" Do you ask how shall I  enter the door? Well, do you really believe that it is your own duty to  enter the door, or do you wait to be thrown into it by some unknown  spiritual convulsion that you never have as yet experienced? How is  this? Let us see. When the Savior was in the world he gathered about him  a great many disciples. John the Baptist also gathered a great many more  and prepared them for the Lord. These all received the \"baptism of  repentance for the remission of sins,\" were converted and saved. Jesus  said to them, \"Now, ye are clean through the word which I have spoken  unto you\"--John xv, 3. All this was accomplished before these disciples  were baptized at Pentecost or any where else with the Holy Spirit. It  was not given until Jesus was glorified, and when it was given it was  not given to sinners to make them saints, but to the disciples who were  already converted and pardoned, to guide them into all truth, to endow  them with apostolic authority.    Jesus said to them, \"Ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come  upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all  Judea and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.\" Acts i,  8. So these disciples were converted and cleansed--saved before they  were baptized with the Holy Spirit.    There is no case in all the world's history of a sinner being baptized  with the Holy Spirit in order to his conversion from sin, or in order to  put him into Christ. These disciples who were baptized with the Holy  Spirit were by the same means qualified to fill the offices of apostles  and prophets--were guided into all truth--preached the gospel with the  Holy"]]]
