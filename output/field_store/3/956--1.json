Proper dinners mean so much--good blood, good health,  good judgment, good conduct. The fact makes tragic a truth too little  regarded; namely, that while bad cooking can ruin the very best of raw  foodstuffs, all the arts of all the cooks in the world can do no more  than palliate things stale, flat and unprofitable. To buy such things is  waste, instead of economy. Food must satisfy the palate else it will  never truly satisfy the stomach. An unsatisfied stomach, or one  overworked by having to wrestle with food which has bulk out of all  proportion to flavor, too often makes its vengeful protest in dyspepsia.  It is said underdone mutton cost Napoleon the battle of Leipsic, and  eventually his crown. I wonder, now and then, if the prevalence of  divorce has any connection with the decline of home cooking?    A far cry, and heretical, do you say, gentle reader? Not so far after  all--these be sociologic days. I am but leading up to the theory with  facts behind it, that it was through being the best fed people in the  world, we of the South Country were able to put up the best fight in  history, and after the ravages and ruin of civil war, come again to our  own. We might have been utterly crushed but for our proud and pampered  stomachs, which in turn gave the bone, brain and brawn for the conquests  of peace. So here's to our Mammys--God bless them! God rest them! This  imperfect chronicle of the nurture wherewith they fed us is inscribed  with love to their memory.    Almost my earliest memory is of Mammy's kitchen. Permission to loiter  there was a Reward of Merit--a sort of domestic Victoria Cross. If, when  company came to spend the day, I made my manners prettily, I might see  all the delightful hurley-burley of dinner-cooking. My seat was the  biscuit block, a section of tree-trunk at least three feet across, and  waist-high. Mammy set me upon it, but first covered it with her clean  apron--it was almost the only use she ever made of the apron. The block  stood well out of the way--next the meal barrel in the corner behind the  door, and hard by the Short Shelf, sacred to cake and piemaking, as the  Long Shelf beneath the window was given over to the three water  buckets--cedar with brass hoops always shining like gold--the piggin,  also of cedar, the corn-bread tray, and the cup-noggin. Above, the log  wall bristled with knives of varying edge, stuck in the cracks; with  nails whereon hung flesh-forks, spoons, ladles, skimmers. These were for  the most part hand-wrought, by the local blacksmith. The forks in  particular were of a classic grace--so much so that when, in looking  through my big sister's mythology I came upon a picture of Neptune with  his trident, I called it his flesh-fork, and asked if he were about to  take up meat with it, from the waves boiling about his feet.    The kitchen proper would give Domestic Science heart failure, yet it  must have been altogether sanitary. Nothing about it was tight enough to  harbor a self-respecting germ. It was the rise of twenty feet square,  built stoutly of hewn logs, with a sharply pitched board roof, a movable  loft, a plank floor boasting inch-wide cracks, a door, two windows and a  fireplace that took up a full half of one end. In front of the fireplace  stretched a rough stone hearth, a yard in depth. Sundry and several  cranes swung against the chimney-breast. When fully in commission they  held pots enough to cook for a regiment. The pots themselves, of cast  iron, with close-fitting tops, ran from two to ten gallons in capacity,  had rounded bottoms with three pertly outstanding legs, and ears either  side for the iron pot-hooks, which varied in size even as did the pots  themselves.    Additionally there were ovens, deep and shallow, spiders, skillets, a  couple of tea-kettles, a stew kettle, a broiler with a long  spider-legged trivet to rest on, a hoe-baker, a biscuit-baker, and  waffle-irons with legs like tongs. Each piece of hollow ware had its  lid, with eye on top for lifting off with the hooks. Live coals, spread  on hearth and lids, did the cooking. To furnish them there was a wrought  iron shovel, so big and heavy nobody but Mammy herself could wield it  properly. Emptied vessels were turned upside down on the floor under the  Long Shelf--grease kept away rust. But before one was used it had to be  scoured with soap and sand rock, rinsed and scalded. Periodically every  piece was burned out--turned upside down over a roaring fire and left  there until red hot, then slowly cooled. This burning out left a fine  smooth surface after scouring. Cast iron, being in a degree porous,  necessarily took up traces of food when it had been used for cooking a  month or so.    Ah me! What savors, what flavors came out of the pots! Years on years I  was laughed at for maintaining that no range ever turned out things to  equal open-hearth cookery. But it took paper bags to prove beyond cavil  the truth of my contention. Even paper-bagging does not quite match the  open-hearth process, though there is the same secret of superiority,  namely, cooking things in their own essence by the agency of hot air.  The sealed and loaded bag needs must be laid on a grate-shelf in a hot  oven--touch of solid hot iron is fatal to it.    Iron vessels set above smoothly spread coals got hot, but not  red-hot--red heat belonged to the lids. They were swung over the fire  and heated before setting them in place--then the blanket of coals and  embers held in heat which, radiating downward, made the cooking even.  Scorching of course was possible unless the cook knew her business, and  minded it well. Our Mammys not only knew their business but loved  it--often with a devotion that raised it to the rank of Art. Add the  palate of a _gourmet_ born, a free hand at the fat, the sweet, strong  waters and high flavors--what wonder it is to envy those of us they fed!    My individual Mammy was in figure an oblate spheroid--she stood five  feet, one inch high, weighed two hundred and fifty pounds, had a head so  flat buckets sat on it as of right, was as light on her feet, in number  twelve shoes, as the slimmest of her children and foster children, could  shame the best man on the place at lifting with the hand-stick, or chop  him to a standstill--if her axe exactly suited her. She loved her work,  her mistress, her children black and white--even me, though I was  something of a trial--her garden and her God. All these she served  fondly, faithfully, with rare good humor and the nicest judgment. Fall  soft upon her, rain and snow! Sunshine and green grass, make happy  always the slope where she rests!    She put on a clean white frock every morning--by breakfast time it was  a sickly gray along the front--the thick of the dinner-battle was writ  large on it in black smudges. She herself explained: \"I ain't sech er  dirty 'ooman--hit's dest I'se so big, dirt ketches me comin' and gwine.\"  Air and more air she would have, regardless of weather. The big  board-window had its shutter up all day long--the glass window was a  vexation, since it opened only halfway. By way of evening things,  daubing and chinking got knocked out of at least half the cracks between  the wall logs as sure as Easter came--not to be replaced until the week  before Christmas. I doubt if they would have been put back even then,  but that Mammy dreaded criticism, from maids and carriage drivers  visiting kinfolk brought with them. Big yawning cracks in cold weather  were in a way the hall-mark of poor-white cabins. It would have half  broken Mammy's heart to give anybody room to say she belonged to less  than real quality.    She was autocratic; a benevolent despot; withal severe. If I displeased  her by meddling, putting small grimy fingers into pies they should not  touch, she set me to shelling black-eyed peas--a task my soul loathed,  likewise the meddlesome fingers--still I knew better than to sulk or  whine over it. For that I would have been sent back into the house. The  kitchen stood thirty yards away from the back door, with a branchy oak  in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28497"],[0,"Myths of the Norsemen: From the Eddas and Sagas (#1)"],[1,"https://www.pgdp.net/                                               Myths of the Norsemen                                From the Eddas and Sagas                                           By                                     H.

The long neglect of these precious records of our heathen ancestors  is not the fault of the material in which all that survives of  their religious beliefs is enshrined, for it may safely be asserted  that the Edda is as rich in the essentials of national romance  and race-imagination, rugged though it be, as the more graceful  and idyllic mythology of the South. Neither is it due to anything  weak in the conception of the deities themselves, for although  they may not rise to great spiritual heights, foremost students of  Icelandic literature agree that they stand out rude and massive as the  Scandinavian mountains. They exhibit \"a spirit of victory, superior  to brute force, superior to mere matter, a spirit that fights and  overcomes.\" [1] \"Even were some part of the matter of their myths  taken from others, yet the Norsemen have given their gods a noble,  upright, great spirit, and placed them upon a high level that is all  their own.\" [2] \"In fact these old Norse songs have a truth in them,  an inward perennial truth and greatness. It is a greatness not of  mere body and gigantic bulk, but a rude greatness of soul.\" [3]    The introduction of Christianity into the North brought with it the  influence of the Classical races, and this eventually supplanted the  native genius, so that the alien mythology and literature of Greece  and Rome have formed an increasing part of the mental equipment of the  northern peoples in proportion as the native literature and tradition  have been neglected.    Undoubtedly Northern mythology has exercised a deep influence upon  our customs, laws, and language, and there has been, therefore,  a great unconscious inspiration flowing from these into English  literature. The most distinctive traits of this mythology are a  peculiar grim humour, to be found in the religion of no other race,  and a dark thread of tragedy which runs throughout the whole woof,  and these characteristics, touching both extremes, are writ large  over English literature.
