WITH AN INTRODUCTORY NOTE  BY SIR WILLIAM MUIR, K.C.S.I., LL.D., D.C.L.  Late Lieutenant-Governor North Western Provinces of India    ILLUSTRATED    CASSELL AND COMPANY, LIMITED  NEW YORK  1885          PREFACE.      The history of this volume can be given in a few words. Months ago I  said to a beloved relative that during the greater part of my life I had  more to do than I could well accomplish, and that now, with health and  strength in a measure restored, I sometimes thought I had not enough to  do. He said: \"Why not write the reminiscences of your Indian life?\" The  counsel struck me as good, and I have acted on it.    My theme has not the advantage of novelty: I cannot tell of a new  country explored, and a new people brought within the knowledge of the  world; but it has the advantage of greatness and variety. I am not aware  that any book on Indian Missions has achieved signal success. I do not  think, however, a single one has been written in vain. That must have  been a singularly poor book on so great a subject which has not had  something in it fitted to interest and inform readers. That must have  been a very solitary, lonely missionary, who has had no friends ready to  listen to what he has had to say. These books may have received little  general attention; but here and there, as the result of their perusal,  there has been a more intelligent apprehension of our work, deeper  sympathy with us, and heartier support rendered to us. I have ventured  to add a volume to those already published in the hope that it may do  some good before it passes into the oblivion which necessarily awaits  most of the productions of the press.    A glance at the contents of this volume will show it takes up a number  of subjects, some of which are merely touched in most books on Missions,  and others not at all. Reminiscences, especially when they spread over  many years, and embrace great events, admit of very discursive  treatment. They leave the writer unfettered to take up any subject  within his wide scope which he may deem fitted to interest his readers.  I have allowed myself the freedom thus afforded me. My aim has been to  take my readers with me to our Indian home, to see us at our work, to  hear us conversing with the people, to accompany us on our journeys, to  surround them in thought with our surroundings, so that they may realize  our position, trials, difficulties, and joys. I have throughout  maintained the standpoint of one whose Indian life has been devoted to  Mission work. My two spheres of labour--Benares during the greater part  of my course, and Ranee Khet, in the Hill Province of Kumaon, in later  years--have come in for extended remark.    My attention has not, however, been confined to Missions. I have  endeavoured to write as one interested in everything which ought to  interest a resident in the land. I have given some account of the  climate, aspect of the country, condition and character of the people,  changes which have taken place, modes of travelling, and the British  Government. I have again and again travelled in the North-West, and some  account of these journeys has been given. On one occasion I spent the  greater part of two months in Ceylon, and to that beautiful island a  chapter is devoted.    I have recorded at some length my experiences of the Indian Mutiny of  1857. No one who was in that terrible storm can ever forget it; and the  European inhabitants of Benares at that time have special reason for  thankfulness for their marvellous escape.    I have found it convenient to follow, as a rule, the chronological  order, but I have not kept closely to it. When recording the more remote  past, the nearer past has been continually coming into view, and the  contrast has found expression.    Indian names are written as ordinary English readers would pronounce  them, in preference to using the diacritical marks with which I have  been long familiar in the writing of Hindustanee in the Roman character.  The term \"Hindu\" is so established that I have used it in preference to  \"Hindoo.\"    At the end of this book the reader will find statistics fraught with  interest to all who wish to understand the great Indian problem in its  many aspects.    It is impossible to keep one's self out of view in a work like this; but  I hope the candid reader will give me credit for saying as little of  myself, family, and doings as is compatible with the conditions under  which I have written.    I beg to dedicate this book to the friends of Christian Missions, in the  hope it may increase the interest of some in that great Continent, with  its teeming population, which has in God's providence come under the  rule of our land, and has special claims on our prayers, sympathy, and  efforts. I cannot doubt that my Indian friends, both those who have come  back to England and those who are still in India, will give a kindly  reception to the volume. They will, I believe, confirm the general  accuracy of my statements, and to a large extent acquiesce in my views.  With them so long as my heart beats it will go forth in heartiest wishes  and fervent prayer for the land with which our past has so inseparably  bound us.

Ross    Burt Franklin Research & Source Works Series #94          PREFACE.    Little is now known to the general public of the history of the attempt  to remove President Andrew Johnson in 1868, on his impeachment by the  House of Representatives and trial by the Senate for alleged high crimes  and misdemeanors in office, or of the causes that led to it. Yet it was  one of the most important and critical events, involving possibly the  gravest consequences, in the entire history of the country.    The constitutional power to impeach and remove the President had lain  dormant since the organization of the Government, and apparently had  never been thought of as a means for the satisfaction of political  enmities or for the punishment of alleged executive misdemeanors, even  in the many heated controversies between the President and Congress that  had theretofore arisen. Nor would any attempt at impeachment have been  made at that time but for the great numerical disparity then existing  between the respective representatives in Congress of the two political  parties of the country.    One-half the members of that Congress, both House and Senate, are now  dead, and with them have also gone substantially the same proportion  of the people at large, but many of the actors therein who have passed  away, lived long enough to see, and were candid enough to admit, that  the failure of the impeachment had brought no harm to the country, while  the general judgment practically of all has come to be that a grave and  threatening danger was thereby averted.    A new generation is now in control of public affairs and the destinies  of the Nation have fallen to new hands. New issues have developed and  will continue to develop from time to time; and new dangers will arise,  with increasing numbers and changing conditions, demanding in their turn  the same careful scrutiny, wisdom and patriotism in adjustment. But  the principles that underlie and constitute the basis of our political  organism, are and will remain the same; and will never cease to demand  constant vigilance for their perpetuation as the rock of safety upon  which our federative system is founded.    To those who in the study of the country's past seek a broader and  higher conception of the duties of American citizenship, the facts  pertaining to the controversy between the Executive and Congress as to  the restoration and preservation of the Union, set out in the following  pages, will be interesting and instructive. No one is better fitted than  the author of this volume to discuss the period of reconstruction  in which, as a member of the Federal senate, he played so potent and  patriotic a part, and it is a pleasure to find that he has discharged  his task with so much ability and care. But it is profoundly hoped that  no coming generation will be called upon to utilize the experiences  of the past in facing in their day, in field or forum, the dangers of  disruption and anarchy, mortal strife and desolation, between those of  one race, and blood, and nationality, that marked the history of America  thirty years ago.    DAVID B. HILL.        CHAPTER 1. -- THE PROBLEM OF RECONSTRUCTION.    MR. LINCOLN'S PLAN    The close of the War of the Rebellion, in 1865, found the country  confronted by a civil problem quite as grave as the contest of arms that  had been composed. It was that of reconstruction, or the restoration of  the States lately in revolt, to their constitutional relations to the  Union.    The country had just emerged from a gigantic struggle of physical force  of four years duration between the two great Northern and Southern  sections. That struggle had been from its inception to its close, a  continuing exhibition, on both sides, of stubborn devotion to a cause,  and its annals had been crowned with illustrations of the grandest  race and personal courage the history of the world records. Out of a  population of thirty million people, four million men were under arms,  from first to last, and sums of money quite beyond the limit of ordinary  comprehension, were expended in its prosecution. There was bloodshed  without stint. Both sides to the conflict fought for an idea--on the one  side for so-called State Rights and local self-government--on the other  for national autonomy as the surest guaranty of all rights--personal,  local, and general.    The institution of negro slavery, the basis of the productive industries  of the States of the South, which had from the organization of the  Government been a source of friction between the slave-holding and  nonslave-holding sections, and was in fact the underlying and potent  cause of the war, went under in the strife and was by national edict  forever prohibited.    The struggle being ended by the exhaustion of the insurgents, two  conspicuous problems demanding immediate solution were developed: The  status of the now ex-slaves, or freedmen--and the methods to be adopted  for the rehabilitation of the revolted States, including the status of  the revolted States themselves. The sword had declared that they had  no constitutional power to withdraw from the Union, and the result  demonstrated that they had not the physical power--and therefore that  they were in the anomalous condition of States of though not States  technically in the Union--and hence properly subject to the jurisdiction  of the General Government, and bound by its judgment in any measures  to be instituted by it for their future restoration to their former  condition of co-equal States.    The now ex-slaves had been liberated, not with the consent of their  former owners, but by the power of the conqueror as a war measure, who  not unnaturally insisted upon the right to declare absolutely the future  status of these persons without consultation with or in any way by the  intervention of their late owners. The majority of the gentlemen in  Congress representing the Northern States demanded the instant and  complete enfranchisement of these persons, as the natural and logical  sequence of their enfreedment. The people of the late slave States, as  was to have been foreseen, and not without reason, objected--especially  where, as was the case in many localities, the late slaves largely  out-numbered the people of the white race: and it is apparent from  subsequent developments that they had the sympathy of President Lincoln,  at least so far as to refuse his sanction to the earlier action of  Congress relative to restoration.    To add to the gravity of the situation and of the problem of  reconstruction, the people of the States lately in rebellion were  disfranchised in a mass, regardless of the fact that many of them  refused to sanction the rebellion only so far as was necessary to their  personal safety.    It was insisted by the dominant element of the party in control of  Congress, that these States were dead as political entities, having  committed political suicide, and their people without rights or the  protection of law, as malcontents.    It is of record that Mr. Lincoln objected to this doctrine, and to all  propositions that contemplated the treatment of the late rebellious  States simply as conquered provinces and their people as having  forfeited all rights under a common government, and under the laws of  Nations entitled to no concessions, or even to consideration, in any  proposed measures of restoration. That he had no sympathy with that  theory is evidenced by the plan of restoration he attempted to establish  in Louisiana.    It was at this point that differences arose between Mr. Lincoln and his  party in Congress, which became more or less acute prior to his death  and continued between Congress and Mr. Johnson on his attempt to carry  out Mr. Lincoln's plans for restoration.    The cessation of hostilities in the field thus developed a  politico-economic problem which had never before confronted any  nation in such magnitude and gravity. The situation was at once novel,  unprecedented, and in more senses than one, alarming. Without its due  and timely solution there was danger of still farther disturbance of a  far different and more alarming character than that of arms but lately  ceased; and of a vastly more insidious and dangerous complexion. The war  had been fought in the open. The record of the more than two thousand  field and naval engagements that had marked its progress and the march  of the Union armies to success, were heralded day by day to every  household, and all could forecast its trend and its results. But the  controversy now developed was insidious--its influences, its weapons,  its designs, and its possible end, were in a measure hidden from the  public--public opinion was divided, and its results, for good or  ill, problematical. The wisest political sagacity and the broadest  statesmanship possible were needed, and in their application no time was  to be lost.    In his annual message to Congress, December 8th, 1863, Mr. Lincoln  had to a considerable extent outlined his plan of Reconstruction;  principally by a recital of what he had already done in that direction.  That part of his message pertinent to this connection is reproduced here  to illustrate the broad, humane, national and patriotic purpose that  actuated him, quite as well as his lack of sympathy with the extreme  partisan aims and methods that characterized the measures afterward  adopted by Congress in opposition to his well-known wishes and views,  and, also, as an important incident to the history of that controversy  and of the time, and its bearing upon the frictions that followed  between Congress and Mr. Lincoln's successor on that subject.
