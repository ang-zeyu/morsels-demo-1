EDWIN ARNOLD          PREFACE    This famous and marvellous Sanskrit poem occurs as an episode of the  Mahabharata, in the sixth--or \"Bhishma\"--Parva of the great Hindoo  epic. It enjoys immense popularity and authority in India, where it is  reckoned as one of the ``Five Jewels,\"--pancharatnani--of Devanagiri  literature. In plain but noble language it unfolds a philosophical system  which remains to this day the prevailing Brahmanic belief, blending as it  does the doctrines of Kapila, Patanjali, and the Vedas. So lofty are many  of its declarations, so sublime its aspirations, so pure and tender its  piety, that Schlegel, after his study of the poem, breaks forth into this  outburst of delight and praise towards its unknown author:  \"Magistrorum reverentia a Brachmanis inter sanctissima pietatis officia  refertur. Ergo te primum, Vates sanctissime, Numinisque hypopheta!  quisquis tandem inter mortales dictus tu fueris, carminis bujus auctor,,  cujus oraculis mens ad excelsa quaeque,quaeque,, aeterna atque divina,  cum inenarraoih quddam delectatione rapitur-te primum, inquam,  salvere jubeo, et vestigia tua semper adore.\" Lassen re-echoes this  splendid tribute; and indeed, so striking are some of the moralities here  inculcated, and so close the parallelism--ofttimes actually verbal--  between its teachings and those of the New Testament, that a  controversy has arisen between Pandits and Missionaries on the point  whether the author borrowed from Christian sources, or the Evangelists  and Apostles from him.    This raises the question of its date, which cannot be positively settled. It  must have been inlaid into the ancient epic at a period later than that of  the original Mahabharata, but Mr Kasinath Telang has offered some fair  arguments to prove it anterior to the Christian era. The weight of  evidence, however, tends to place its composition at about the third  century after Christ; and perhaps there are really echoes in this  Brahmanic poem of the lessons of Galilee, and of the Syrian incarnation.    Its scene is the level country between the Jumna and the Sarsooti  rivers-now Kurnul and Jheend. Its simple plot consists of a dialogue held  by Prince Arjuna, the brother of King Yudhisthira, with Krishna, the  Supreme Deity, wearing the disguise of a charioteer. A great battle is  impending between the armies of the Kauravas and Pandavas, and this  conversation is maintained in a war-chariot drawn up between the  opposing hosts.    The poem has been turned into French by Burnouf, into Latin by Lassen,  into Italian by Stanislav Gatti, into Greek by Galanos, and into English  by Mr. Thomson and Mr Davies, the prose transcript of the last-named  being truly beyond praise for its fidelity and clearness. Mr Telang has  also published at Bombay a version in colloquial rhythm, eminently  learned and intelligent, but not conveying the dignity or grace of the  original. If I venture to offer a translation of the wonderful poem after  so many superior scholars, it is in grateful recognition of the help  derived from their labours, and because English literature would  certainly be incomplete without possessing in popular form a poetical  and philosophical work so dear to India.    There is little else to say which the \"Song Celestial\" does not explain for  itself. The Sanskrit original is written in the Anushtubh metre, which  cannot be successfully reproduced for Western ears. I have therefore  cast it into our flexible blank verse, changing into lyrical measures  where the text itself similarly breaks. For the most part, I believe the  sense to be faithfully preserved in the following pages; but Schlegel  himself had to say: \"In reconditioribus me semper poetafoster mentem  recte divinasse affirmare non ausim.\" Those who would read more upon  the philosophy of the poem may find an admirable introduction in the  volume of Mr Davies, printed by Messrs Trubner & Co.

Sanjaya:    When he beheld the host of Pandavas,    Raja Duryodhana to Drona drew,    And spake these words: \"Ah, Guru! see this line,    How vast it is of Pandu fighting-men,    Embattled by the son of Drupada,    Thy scholar in the war! Therein stand ranked    Chiefs like Arjuna, like to Bhima chiefs,    Benders of bows; Virata, Yuyudhan,    Drupada, eminent upon his car,    Dhrishtaket, Chekitan, Kasi's stout lord,    Purujit, Kuntibhoj, and Saivya,    With Yudhamanyu, and Uttamauj    Subhadra's child; and Drupadi's;-all famed!    All mounted on their shining chariots!    On our side, too,--thou best of Brahmans! see    Excellent chiefs, commanders of my line,    Whose names I joy to count: thyself the first,    Then Bhishma, Karna, Kripa fierce in fight,    Vikarna, Aswatthaman; next to these    Strong Saumadatti, with full many more    Valiant and tried, ready this day to die    For me their king, each with his weapon grasped,    Each skilful in the field. Weakest-meseems-    Our battle shows where Bhishma holds command,    And Bhima, fronting him, something too strong!    Have care our captains nigh to Bhishma's ranks    Prepare what help they may! Now, blow my shell!\"      Then, at the signal of the aged king,    With blare to wake the blood, rolling around    Like to a lion's roar, the trumpeter    Blew the great Conch; and, at the noise of it,    Trumpets and drums, cymbals and gongs and horns    Burst into sudden clamour; as the blasts    Of loosened tempest, such the tumult seemed!    Then might be seen, upon their car of gold    Yoked with white steeds, blowing their battle-shells,    Krishna the God, Arjuna at his side:    Krishna, with knotted locks, blew his great conch    Carved of the \"Giant's bone;\" Arjuna blew    Indra's loud gift; Bhima the terrible--    Wolf-bellied Bhima-blew a long reed-conch;    And Yudhisthira, Kunti's blameless son,    Winded a mighty shell, \"Victory's Voice;\"    And Nakula blew shrill upon his conch    Named the \"Sweet-sounding,\" Sahadev on his    Called\"Gem-bedecked,\" and Kasi's Prince on his.    Sikhandi on his car, Dhrishtadyumn,    Virata, Satyaki the Unsubdued,    Drupada, with his sons, (O Lord of Earth!)    Long-armed Subhadra's children, all blew loud,    So that the clangour shook their foemen's hearts,    With quaking earth and thundering heav'n.      Then 'twas-    Beholding Dhritirashtra's battle set,    Weapons unsheathing, bows drawn forth, the war    Instant to break-Arjun, whose ensign-badge    Was Hanuman the monkey, spake this thing    To Krishna the Divine, his charioteer:    \"Drive, Dauntless One! to yonder open ground    Betwixt the armies; I would see more nigh    These who will fight with us, those we must slay    To-day, in war's arbitrament; for, sure,    On bloodshed all are bent who throng this plain,    Obeying Dhritirashtra's sinful son.\"      Thus, by Arjuna prayed, (O Bharata!)    Between the hosts that heavenly Charioteer    Drove the bright car, reining its milk-white steeds    Where Bhishma led,and Drona,and their Lords.    \"See!\" spake he to Arjuna, \"where they stand,    Thy kindred of the Kurus:\" and the Prince    Marked on each hand the kinsmen of his house,    Grandsires and sires, uncles and brothers and sons,    Cousins and sons-in-law and nephews, mixed    With friends and honoured elders; some this side,    Some that side ranged: and, seeing those opposed,    Such kith grown enemies-Arjuna's heart    Melted with pity, while he uttered this:      Arjuna.    Krishna! as I behold, come here to shed    Their common blood, yon concourse of our kin,    My members fail, my tongue dries in my mouth,    A shudder thrills my body, and my hair    Bristles with horror; from my weak hand slips    Gandiv, the goodly bow; a fever burns    My skin to parching; hardly may I stand;    The life within me seems to swim and faint;    Nothing do I foresee save woe and wail!    It is not good, O Keshav! nought of good    Can spring from mutual slaughter! Lo, I hate    Triumph and domination, wealth and ease,    Thus sadly won! Aho! what victory    Can bring delight, Govinda! what rich spoils    Could profit; what rule recompense; what span    Of life itself seem sweet, bought with such blood?    Seeing that these stand here, ready to die,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2391"],[0,"Bruce (#1)"],[1,"by    Albert Payson Terhune          TO MY TEN BEST FRIENDS:    Who are far wiser in their way and far better in every way, than I; and  yet who have not the wisdom to know it    Who do not merely think I am perfect, but who are calmly and  permanently convinced of my perfection;--and this in spite of fifty  disillusions a day    Who are frantically happy at my coming and bitterly woebegone in my  absence    Who never bore me and never are bored by me    Who never talk about themselves and who always listen with rapturous  interest to anything I may say    Who, having no conventional standards, have no respectability; and who,  having no conventional consciences, have no sins    Who teach me finer lessons in loyalty, in patience, in true courtesy,  in unselfishness, in divine forgiveness, in pluck and in abiding good  spirits than do all the books I have ever read and all the other models  I have studied    Who have not deigned to waste time and eyesight in reading a word of  mine and who will not bother to read this verbose tribute to themselves    In short, to the most gloriously satisfactory chums who ever appealed  to human vanity and to human desire for companionship    TO OUR TEN SUNNYBANK COLLIES MY STORY IS GRATEFULLY AND AFFECTIONATELY  DEDICATED        BRUCE    by    Albert Payson Terhune          CONTENTS       I.

And she had a heart and a soul--which were a curse.  For without such a heart and soul, she might have found the tough  life-battle less bitterly hard to fight.    But the world does queer things--damnable things--to hearts that are so  tenderly all-loving and to souls that are so trustfully and forgivingly  friendly as hers.    Her \"pedigree name\" was Rothsay Lass. She was a collie--daintily  fragile of build, sensitive of nostril, furrily tawny of coat. Her  ancestry was as flawless as any in Burke's Peerage.    If God had sent her into the world with a pair of tulip ears and with a  shade less width of brain-space she might have been cherished and  coddled as a potential bench-show winner, and in time might even have  won immortality by the title of \"CHAMPION Rothsay Lass.\"    But her ears pricked rebelliously upward, like those of her earliest  ancestors, the wolves. Nor could manipulation lure their stiff  cartilages into drooping as bench-show fashion demands. The average  show-collie's ears have a tendency to prick. By weights and plasters,  and often by torture, this tendency is overcome. But never when the  cartilage is as unyielding as was Lass's.    Her graceful head harked back in shape to the days when collies had to  do much independent thinking, as sheep-guards, and when they needed  more brainroom than is afforded by the borzoi skull sought after by  modern bench-show experts.    Wherefore, Lass had no hope whatever of winning laurels in the  show-ring or of attracting a high price from some rich fancier. She was  tabulated, from babyhood, as a \"second\"--in other words, as a faulty  specimen in a litter that should have been faultless.    These \"seconds\" are as good to look at, from a layman's view, as is any  international champion. And their offspring are sometimes as perfect as  are those of the finest specimens. But, lacking the arbitrary \"points\"  demanded by show-judges, the \"seconds\" are condemned to obscurity, and  to sell as pets.    If Lass had been a male dog, her beauty and sense and lovableness would  have found a ready purchaser for her. For nine pet collies out of ten  are \"seconds\"; and splendid pets they make for the most part.    But Lass, at the very start, had committed the unforgivable sin of  being born a female. Therefore, no pet-seeker wanted to buy her. Even  when she was offered for sale at half the sum asked for her less  handsome brothers, no one wanted her.    A mare--or the female of nearly any species except the canine--brings  as high and as ready a price as does the male. But never the female  dog. Except for breeding, she is not wanted.    This prejudice had its start in Crusader days, some thousand years ago.  Up to that time, all through the civilized world, a female dog had been  more popular as a pet than a male. The Mohammedans (to whom, by creed,  all dogs are unclean) gave their European foes the first hint that a  female dog was the lowest thing on earth.    The Saracens despised her, as the potential mother of future dogs. And  they loathed her accordingly. Back to Europe came the Crusaders,  bearing only three lasting memorials of their contact with the Moslems.  One of the three was a sneering contempt for all female dogs.    There is no other pet as loving, as quick of wit, as loyal, as  staunchly brave and as companionable as the female collie. She has all  the male's best traits and none of his worst. She has more in common,  too, with the highest type of woman than has any other animal alive.  (This, with all due respect to womanhood.)    Prejudice has robbed countless dog-lovers of the joy of owning such a  pal. In England the female pet dog has at last begun to come into her  own. Here she has not. The loss is ours.    And so back to Lass.    When would-be purchasers were conducted to the puppy-run at the Rothsay  kennels, Lass and her six brethren and sisters were wont to come  galloping to the gate to welcome the strangers. For the pups were only  three months old--an age when every event is thrillingly interesting,  and everybody is a friend. Three times out of five, the buyer's eye  would single Lass from the rollicking and fluffy mass of puppyhood.    She was so pretty, so wistfully appealing, so free from fear (and from  bumptiousness as well) and carried herself so daintily, that one's  heart warmed to her. The visitor would point her out. The kennel-man  would reply, flatteringly--    \"Yes, she sure is one fine pup!\"    The purchaser never waited to hear the end of the sentence, before  turning to some other puppy. The pronoun, \"she,\" had killed forever his  dawning fancy for the little beauty.    The four males of the litter were soon sold; for there is a brisk and a  steady market for good collie pups. One of the two other females died.  Lass's remaining sister began to \"shape up\" with show-possibilities,  and was bought by the owner of another kennel. Thus, by the time she  was five months old, Lass was left alone in the puppy-run.    She mourned her playmates. It was cold, at night, with no other cuddly  little fur-ball to snuggle down to. It was stupid, with no one to help  her work off her five-months spirits in a romp. And Lass missed the  dozens of visitors that of old had come to the run.    The kennel-men felt not the slightest interest in her. Lass meant  nothing to them, except the work of feeding her and of keeping an extra  run in order. She was a liability, a nuisance.    Lass used to watch with pitiful eagerness for the attendants'  duty-visits to the run. She would gallop joyously up to them, begging  for a word or a caress, trying to tempt them into a romp, bringing them  peaceofferings in the shape of treasured bones she had buried for her  own future use. But all this gained her nothing.    A careless word at best--a grunt or a shove at worst were her only  rewards. For the most part, the men with the feed-trough or the  water-pail ignored her bounding and wrigglingly eager welcome as  completely as though she were a part of the kennel furnishings. Her  short daily \"exercise scamper\" in the open was her nearest approach to  a good time.    Then came a day when again a visitor stopped in front of Lass's run. He  was not much of a visitor, being a pallid and rather shabbily dressed  lad of twelve, with a brand-new chain and collar in his hand.    \"You see,\" he was confiding to the bored kennel-man who had been  detailed by the foreman to take him around the kennels, \"when I got the  check from Uncle Dick this morning, I made up my mind, first thing, to  buy a dog with it, even if it took every cent. But then I got to  thinking I'd need something to fasten him with, so he wouldn't run away  before he learned to like me and want to stay with me. So when I got  the check cashed at the store, I got this collar and chain.\"    \"Are you a friend of the boss?\" asked the kennel-man.    \"The boss?\" echoed the boy. \"You mean the man who owns this place? No,  sir. But when I've walked past, on the road, I've seen his 'Collies for  Sale' sign, lots of times. Once I saw some of them being exercised.  They were the wonderfulest dogs I ever saw. So the minute I got the  money for the check, I came here. I told the man in the front yard I  wanted to buy a dog. He's the one who turned me over to you. I  wish--OH!\" he broke off in rapture, coming to a halt in front of Lass's  run. \"Look! Isn't he a dandy?\"    Lass had trotted hospitably forward to greet the guest. Now she was  standing on her hind legs, her front paws alternately supporting her  fragile weight on the wire of the fence and waving welcomingly toward  the boy. Unknowingly, she was bidding for a master. And her wistful  friendliness struck a note of response in the little fellow's heart.  For he, too, was lonesome, much of the time, as is the fate of a sickly  only child in an overbusy home. And he had the true craving of the  lonely for dog comradeship.    He thrust his none-too-clean hand through the wire mesh and patted the  puppy's silky head. Lass wiggled ecstatically under the unfamiliar  caress. All at once, in the boy's eyes, she became quite the most  wonderful animal and the very most desirable pet on earth.    \"He's great!\" sighed the youngster in admiration; adding naively: \"Is  he Champion Rothsay Chief--the one whose picture was in The Bulletin  last Sunday?\"    The kennel-man laughed noisily. Then he checked his mirth, for  professional "]]]
