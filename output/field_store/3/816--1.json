THE NEW ATLANTIS      BY    SIR FRANCIS BACON          INTRODUCTORY NOTE    Bacon's literary executor, Dr. Rowley, published \"The New Atlantis\" in  1627, the year after the author's death.  It seems to have been written  about 1623, during that period of literary activity which followed  Bacon's political fall.  None of Bacon's writings gives in short apace  so vivid a picture of his tastes and aspirations as this fragment of  the plan of an ideal commonwealth.  The generosity and enlightenment,  the dignity and splendor, the piety and public spirit, of the  inhabitants of Bensalem represent the ideal qualities which Bacon the  statesman desired rather than hoped to see characteristic of his own  country; and in Solomon's House we have Bacon the scientist indulging  without restriction his prophetic vision of the future of human  knowledge.  No reader acquainted in any degree with the processes and  results of modern scientific inquiry can fail to be struck by the  numerous approximations made by Bacon's imagination to the actual  achievements of modern times.  The plan and organization of his great  college lay down the main lines of the modern research university; and  both in pure and applied science he anticipates a strikingly large  number of recent inventions and discoveries.  In still another way is  \"The New Atlantis\" typical of Bacon's attitude. In spite of the  enthusiastic and broad-minded schemes he laid down for the pursuit of  truth, Bacon always had an eye to utility.  The advancement of science  which he sought was conceived by him as a means to a practical end the  increase of man's control over nature, and the comfort and convenience  of humanity.  For pure metaphysics, or any form of abstract thinking  that yielded no \"fruit,\" he had little interest; and this leaning to  the useful is shown in the practical applications of the discoveries  made by the scholars of Solomon's House.  Nor does the interest of the  work stop here.  It contains much, both in its political and in its  scientific ideals, that we have as yet by no means achieved, but which  contain valuable elements of suggestion and stimulus for the future.            THE NEW ATLANTIS    We sailed from Peru, (where we had continued for the space of one whole  year) for China and Japan, by the South Sea; taking with us victuals  for twelve months; and had good winds from the east, though soft and  weak, for five months space, and more.  But the wind came about, and  settled in the west for many days, so as we could make little or no  way, and were sometime in purpose to turn back.  But then again there  arose strong and great winds from the south, with a point east, which  carried us up (for all that we could do) towards the north; by which  time our victuals failed us, though we had made good spare of them.  So  that finding ourselves, in the midst of the greatest wilderness of  waters in the world, without victuals, we gave ourselves for lost men  and prepared for death.  Yet we did lift up our hearts and voices to  God above, who showeth his wonders in the deep, beseeching him of his  mercy, that as in the beginning he discovered the face of the deep, and  brought forth dry land, so he would now discover land to us, that we  might not perish.    And it came to pass that the next day about evening we saw within a  kenning before us, towards the north, as it were thick clouds, which  did put us in some hope of land; knowing how that part of the South Sea  was utterly unknown; and might have islands, or continents, that  hitherto were not come to light.  Wherefore we bent our course thither,  where we saw the appearance of land, all that night; and in the dawning  of the next day, we might plainly discern that it was a land; flat to  our sight, and full of boscage; which made it show the more dark.  And  after an hour and a half's sailing, we entered into a good haven, being  the port of a fair city; not great indeed, but well built, and that  gave a pleasant view from the sea: and we thinking every minute long,  till we were on land, came close to the shore, and offered to land.  But straightways we saw divers of the people, with bastons in their  hands (as it were) forbidding us to land; yet without any cries of  fierceness, but only as warning us off, by signs that they made.  Whereupon being not a little discomforted, we were advising with  ourselves, what we should do.    During which time, there made forth to us a small boat, with about  eight persons in it; whereof one of them had in his hand a tipstaff of  a yellow cane, tipped at both ends with blue, who came aboard our ship,  without any show of distrust at all.  And when he saw one of our  number, present himself somewhat before the rest, he drew forth a  little scroll of parchment (somewhat yellower than our parchment, and  shining like the leaves of writing tables, but otherwise soft and  flexible,) and delivered it to our foremost man.  In which scroll were  written in ancient Hebrew, and in ancient Greek, and in good Latin of  the school, and in Spanish, these words: Land ye not, none of you; and  provide to be gone from this coast, within sixteen days, except you  have further time given you.  Meanwhile, if you want fresh water or  victuals, or help for your sick, or that your ship needeth repairs,  write down your wants, and you shall have that, which belongeth to  mercy.  This scroll was signed with a stamp of cherubim: wings, not  spread, but hanging downwards; and by them a cross.  This being  delivered, the officer returned, and left only a servant with us to  receive our answer.    Consulting hereupon amongst ourselves, we were much perplexed.  The  denial of landing and hasty warning us away troubled us much; on the  other side, to find that the people had languages, and were so full of  humanity, did comfort us not a little.  And above all, the sign of the  cross to that instrument was to us a great rejoicing, and as it were a  certain presage of good.  Our answer was in the Spanish tongue; that  for our ship, it was well; for we had rather met with calms and  contrary winds than any tempests.  For our sick, they were many, and in  very ill case; so that if they were not permitted to land, they ran  danger of their lives.  Our other wants we set down in particular;  adding, That we had some little store of merchandise, which if it  pleased them to deal for, it might supply our wants, without being  chargeable unto them.  We offered some reward in pistolets unto the  servant, and a piece of crimson velvet to be presented to the officer;  but the servant took them not, nor would scarce look upon them; and so  left us, and went back in another little boat, which was sent for him.    About three hours after we had dispatched our answer, there came  towards us a person (as it seemed) of place.  He had on him a gown with  wide sleeves, of a kind of water chamolet, of an excellent azure  colour, fair more glossy than ours; his under apparel was green; and so  was his hat, being in the form of a turban, daintily made, and not so  huge as the Turkish turbans; and the locks of his hair came down below  the brims of it.  A reverend man was he to behold.  He came in a boat,  gilt in some part of it, with four persons more only in that boat; and  was followed by another boat, wherein were some twenty. When he was  come within a flightshot of our ship, signs were made to us, that we  should send forth some to meet him upon the water; which we presently  did in our ship-boat, sending the principal man amongst us save one,  and four of our number with him.    When we were come within six yards of their boat, they called to us to  stay, and not to approach farther; which we did.  And thereupon the  man, whom I before described, stood up, and with a loud voice, in  Spanish, asked, \"Are ye Christians?\"  We answered, \"We were;\" fearing  the less, because of the cross we had seen in the subscription.  At  which answer the said person lifted up his right hand towards Heaven,  and drew it softly to his mouth (which is the gesture they use, when  they thank God;) and then said: \"If ye will swear (all of you) by the  merits of the Saviour, that ye are no pirates, nor have shed blood,  lawfully, nor unlawfully within forty days past, you may have licence  to come on land.\"  We said, \"We were all ready to take that oath.\"  Whereupon one of those that were with him, being (as it seemed) a  notary, made an entry of this act.  Which done, another of the  attendants of the great person which was with him in the same boat,  after his Lord had spoken a little to him, said aloud: \"My Lord would  have you know, that it is not of pride, or greatness, that he cometh  not aboard your ship; but for that in your answer you declare that you  have many sick amongst you, he was warned by the Conservator of Health  of the city that he should keep a distance.\"  We bowed ourselves  towards him, and answered, \"We were his humble servants; and accounted  for great honour, and singular humanity towards us, that which was  already done; but hoped well, that the nature of the sickness of our  men was not infectious.\"  So he returned; and a while after came the  Notary to us aboard our ship; holding in his hand a fruit of that  country, like an orange, but of color between orange-tawney and  scarlet; which cast a most excellent odour.  He used it (as it seemeth)  for a preservative against infection.  He gave us our oath; \"By the  name of Jesus, and his merits:\" and after told us, that the next day,  by six of the Clock, in the Morning, we should be sent to, and brought  to the Strangers' House, (so he called it,) where we should be  accommodated of things, both for our whole, and for our sick. So he  left us; and when we offered him some pistolets, he smiling said, \"He  must not be twice paid for one labour:\" meaning (as I take it) that he  had salary sufficient of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24350"],[0,"Kerfol (#1)"],[1,"By Edith Wharton    Copyright, 1916, By Charles Scribner's Sons            I    \"You ought to buy it,\" said my host; \"its Just the place for a  solitary-minded devil like you. And it would be rather worth while to  own the most romantic house in Brittany. The present people are dead  broke, and it's going for a song--you ought to buy it.\"    It was not with the least idea of living up to the character my friend  Lanrivain ascribed to me (as a matter of fact, under my unsociable  exterior I have always had secret yearnings for domesticity) that I took  his hint one autumn afternoon and went to Kerfol. My friend was motoring  over to Quimper on business: he dropped me on the way, at a cross-road  on a heath, and said: \"First turn to the right and second to the left.  Then straight ahead till you see an avenue. If you meet any peasants,  don't ask your way. They don't understand French, and they would pretend  they did and mix you up. I'll be back for you here by sunset--and don't  forget the tombs in the chapel.\"    I followed Lanrivain's directions with the hesitation occasioned by the  usual difficulty of remembering whether he had said the first turn  to the right and second to the left, or the contrary. If I had met a  peasant I should certainly have asked, and probably been sent astray;  but I had the desert landscape to myself, and so stumbled on the right  turn and walked across the heath till I came to an avenue. It was so  unlike any other avenue I have ever seen that I instantly knew it must  be _the_ avenue. The grey-trunked trees sprang up straight to a great  height and then interwove their pale-grey branches in a long tunnel  through which the autumn light fell faintly. I know most trees by name,  but I haven't to this day been able to decide what those trees were.  They had the tall curve of elms, the tenuity of poplars, the ashen  colour of olives under a rainy sky; and they stretched ahead of me for  half a mile or more without a break in their arch. If ever I saw an  avenue that unmistakably led to something, it was the avenue at Kerfol.  My heart beat a little as I began to walk down it.    Presently the trees ended and I came to a fortified gate in a long wall.  Between me and the wall was an open space of grass, with other grey  avenues radiating from it. Behind the wall were tall slate roofs mossed  with silver, a chapel belfry, the top of a keep. A moat filled with  wild shrubs and brambles surrounded the place; the drawbridge had been  replaced by a stone arch, and the portcullis by an iron gate. I stood  for a long time on the hither side of the moat, gazing about me, and  letting the influence of the place sink in. I said to myself: \"If I wait  long enough, the guardian will turn up and show me the tombs--\" and I  rather hoped he wouldn't turn up too soon.    I sat down on a stone and lit a cigarette. As soon as I had done it, it  struck me as a puerile and portentous thing to do, with that great blind  house looking down at me, and all the empty avenues converging on me. It  may have been the depth of the silence that made me so conscious of my  gesture. The squeak of my match sounded as loud as the scraping of a  brake, and I almost fancied I heard it fall when I tossed it onto  the grass. But there was more than that: a sense of irrelevance,  of littleness, of futile bravado, in sitting there puffing my  cigarette-smoke into the face of such a past.    I knew nothing of the history of Kerfol--I was new to Brittany, and  Lanrivain had never mentioned the name to me till the day before--but  one couldn't as much as glance at that pile without feeling in it a  long accumulation of history. What kind of history I was not prepared  to guess: perhaps only that sheer weight of many associated lives and  deaths which gives a majesty to all old houses. But the aspect of Kerfol  suggested something more--a perspective of stern and cruel memories  stretching away, like its own grey avenues, into a blur of darkness.    Certainly no house had ever more completely and finally broken with the  present. As it stood there, lifting its proud roofs and gables to the  sky, it might have been its own funeral monument. \"Tombs in the chapel?  The whole place is a tomb!\" I reflected. I hoped more and more that the  guardian would not come. The details of the place, however striking,  would seem trivial compared with its collective impressiveness; and I  wanted only to sit there and be penetrated by the weight of its silence.    \"It's the very place for you!\" Lanrivain had said; and I was overcome by  the almost blasphemous frivolity of suggesting to any living being that  Kerfol was the place for him. \"Is it possible that any one could _not_  See--?\" I wondered. I did not finish the thought: what I meant was  undefinable. I stood up and wandered toward the gate. I was beginning to  want to know more; not to _see_ more--I was by now so sure it was not  a question of seeing--but to feel more: feel all the place had to  communicate. \"But to get in one will have to rout out the keeper,\" I  thought reluctantly, and hesitated. Finally I crossed the bridge and  tried the iron gate. It yielded, and I walked through the tunnel formed  by the thickness of the _chemin de ronde_. At the farther end, a wooden  barricade had been laid across the entrance, and beyond it was a court  enclosed in noble architecture. The main building faced me; and I now  saw that one half was a mere ruined front, with gaping windows through  which the wild growths of the moat and the trees of the park were  visible. The rest of the house was still in its robust beauty. One end  abutted on the round tower, the other on the small traceried chapel,  and in an angle of the building stood a graceful well-head crowned  with mossy urns. A few roses grew against the walls, and on an upper  window-sill I remember noticing a pot of fuchsias.    My sense of the pressure of the invisible began to yield to my  architectural interest. The building was so fine that I felt a desire  to explore it for its own sake. I looked about the court, wondering in  which corner the guardian lodged. Then I pushed open the barrier and  went in. As I did so, a dog barred my way. He was such a remarkably  beautiful little dog that for a moment he made me forget the splendid  place he was defending. I was not sure of his breed at the time, but  have since learned that it was Chinese, and that he was of a rare  variety called the \"Sleeve-dog.\" He was very small and golden brown,  with large brown eyes and a ruffled throat: he looked like a large tawny  chrysanthemum. I said to myself: \"These little beasts always snap and  scream, and somebody will be out in a minute.\"    The little animal stood before me, forbidding, almost menacing: there  was anger in his large brown eyes. But he made no sound, he came no  nearer. Instead, as I advanced, he gradually fell back, and I noticed  that another dog, a vague rough brindled thing, had limped up on a lame  leg. \"There'll be a hubbub now,\" I thought; for at the same moment a  third dog, a long-haired white mongrel, slipped out of a doorway and  joined the others. All three stood looking at me with grave eyes; but  not a sound came from them. As I advanced they continued to fall back on  muffled paws, still watching me. \"At a given point, they'll all charge  at my ankles: it's one of the jokes that dogs who live together put up  on one,\" I thought. I was not alarmed, for they were neither large  nor formidable. But they let me wander about the court as I pleased,  following me at a little distance--always the same distance--and always  keeping their eyes on me. Presently I looked across at the ruined  facade, and saw that in one of its empty window-frames another dog  stood: a white pointer with one brown ear. He was an old grave dog, much  more experienced than the others; and he seemed to be observing me with  a deeper intentness. \"I'll hear from _him_,\" I said to myself; but he  stood in the window-frame, against the trees of the park, and continued  to watch me without moving. I stared back at him for a time, to see if  the sense that he was being watched would not rouse him. Half the width  of the court lay between us, and we gazed at each other silently across  it. But he did not stir, and at last I turned away. Behind me I found  the rest of the pack, with a newcomer added: a small black greyhound  with pale agate-coloured eyes. He was shivering a little, and his  expression was more timid than that of the others. I noticed that he  kept a little behind them. And still there was not a sound.    I stood there for fully five minutes, the circle about me--waiting, as  they seemed to be waiting. At last I went up to the little golden-brown  dog and stooped to pat him. As I did so, I heard myself give a nervous  laugh. The little dog did not start, or growl, or take his eyes from  me--he simply slipped back about a yard, and then paused and continued  to look at me. \"Oh, hang it!\" I exclaimed, and walked across the court  toward the well.    As I advanced, the dogs separated and slid away into different corners  of the court. I examined the urns on the well, tried a locked door or  two, and looked up and down the dumb facade; then I faced about toward  the chapel. When I turned I perceived that all the dogs had disappeared  except the old pointer, who still watched me from the window. It was  rather a relief to be rid of that cloud of witnesses; and I began to  look about me for a way to the back of the house. \"Perhaps there'll  be somebody in the garden,\" I thought. I found a way across the moat,  scrambled over a wall smothered in brambles, and got into the garden.  A few lean hydrangeas and geraniums pined in the flower-beds, and the  ancient house looked down on them indifferently. Its garden side was  plainer and severer than the other: the long granite front, with its few  windows and steep roof, looked like a"]]]
