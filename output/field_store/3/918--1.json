Henry I was poisoned, Henry II was killed in a tournament,  Henry III and Henry IV were assassinated. As to Henry V, for whom the  past is so fatal already, God alone knows what the future has in store  for him.    In Scotland, the unlucky name is \"Stuart\". Robert I, founder of the  race, died at twenty-eight of a lingering illness. Robert II, the most  fortunate of the family, was obliged to pass a part of his life, not  merely in retirement, but also in the dark, on account of inflammation  of the eyes, which made them blood-red. Robert III succumbed to grief,  the death of one son and the captivity of other. James I was stabbed by  Graham in the abbey of the Black Monks of Perth. James II was killed at  the siege of Roxburgh, by a splinter from a burst cannon. James III was  assassinated by an unknown hand in a mill, where he had taken refuge  during the battle of Sauchie. James IV, wounded by two arrows and a blow  from a halberd, fell amidst his nobles on the battlefield of Flodden.  James V died of grief at the loss of his two sons, and of remorse for  the execution of Hamilton. James VI, destined to unite on his head the  two crowns of Scotland and England, son of a father who had been  assassinated, led a melancholy and timorous existence, between the  scaffold of his mother, Mary Stuart, and that of his son, Charles I.  Charles II spent a portion of his life in exile. James II died in it.  The Chevalier Saint-George, after having been proclaimed King of  Scotland as James VIII, and of England and Ireland as James III, was  forced to flee, without having been able to give his arms even the  lustre of a defeat. His son, Charles Edward, after the skirmish at Derby  and the battle of Culloden, hunted from mountain to mountain, pursued  from rock to rock, swimming from shore to shore, picked up half naked by  a French vessel, betook himself to Florence to die there, without the  European courts having ever consented to recognise him as a sovereign.  Finally, his brother, Henry Benedict, the last heir of the Stuarts,  having lived on a pension of three thousand pounds sterling, granted him  by George III, died completely forgotten, bequeathing to the House of  Hanover all the crown jewels which James II had carried off when he  passed over to the Continent in 1688--a tardy but complete recognition  of the legitimacy of the family which had succeeded his.    In the midst of this unlucky race, Mary Stuart was the favourite of  misfortune. As Brantome has said of her, \"Whoever desires to write about  this illustrious queen of Scotland has, in her, two very, large  subjects, the one her life, the other her death,\" Brantome had known her  on one of the most mournful occasions of her life--at the moment when  she was quitting France for Scotland.    It was on the 9th of August, 1561, after having lost her mother and her  husband in the same year, that Mary Stuart, Dowager of France and Queen  of Scotland at nineteen, escorted by her uncles, Cardinals Guise and  Lorraine, by the Duke and Duchess of Guise, by the Duc d'Aumale and M.  de Nemours, arrived at Calais, where two galleys were waiting to take  her to Scotland, one commanded by M. de Mevillon and the other by  Captain Albize. She remained six days in the town. At last, on the 15th  of the month, after the saddest adieus to her family, accompanied by  Messieurs d'Aumale, d'Elboeuf, and Damville, with many nobles, among  whom were Brantome and Chatelard, she embarked in M. Mevillon's galley,  which was immediately ordered to put out to sea, which it did with the  aid of oars, there not being sufficient wind to make use of the sails.    Mary Stuart was then in the full bloom of her beauty, beauty even more  brilliant in its mourning garb--a beauty so wonderful that it shed  around her a charm which no one whom she wished to please could escape,  and which was fatal to almost everyone. About this time, too, someone  made her the subject of a song, which, as even her rivals confessed,  contained no more than the truth. It was, so it was said, by M. de  Maison-Fleur, a cavalier equally accomplished in arms and letters: Here  it is:--    \"In robes of whiteness, lo, Full sad and mournfully, Went pacing to and  fro Beauty's divinity; A shaft in hand she bore From Cupid's cruel  store, And he, who fluttered round, Bore, o'er his blindfold eyes And  o'er his head uncrowned, A veil of mournful guise, Whereon the words  were wrought: 'You perish or are caught.'\"    Yes, at this moment, Mary Stuart, in her deep mourning of white, was  more lovely than ever; for great tears were trickling down her cheeks,  as, weaving a handkerchief, standing on the quarterdeck, she who was so  grieved to set out, bowed farewell to those who were so grieved to  remain.    At last, in half an hour's time, the harbour was left behind; the vessel  was out at sea. Suddenly, Mary heard loud cries behind her: a boat  coming in under press of sail, through her pilot's ignorance had struck  upon a rock in such a manner that it was split open, and after having  trembled and groaned for a moment like someone wounded, began to be  swallowed up, amid the terrified screams of all the crew. Mary,  horror-stricken, pale, dumb, and motionless, watched her gradually sink,  while her unfortunate crew, as the keel disappeared, climbed into the  yards and shrouds, to delay their death-agony a few minutes; finally,  keel, yards, masts, all were engulfed in the ocean's gaping jaws. For a  moment there remained some black specks, which in turn disappeared one  after another; then wave followed upon wave, and the spectators of this  horrible tragedy, seeing the sea calm and solitary as if nothing had  happened, asked themselves if it was not a vision that had appeared to  them and vanished.    \"Alas!\" cried Mary, falling on a seat and leaning both arms an the  vessel's stern, \"what a sad omen for such a sad voyage!\" Then, once more  fixing on the receding harbour her eyes, dried for a moment by terror,  and beginning to moisten anew, \"Adieu, France!\" she murmured, \"adieu,  France!\" and for five hours she remained thus, weeping and murmuring,  \"Adieu, France! adieu, France!\"    Darkness fell while she was still lamenting; and then, as the view was  blotted out and she was summoned to supper, \"It is indeed now, dear  France,\" said she, rising, \"that I really lose you, since jealous night  heaps mourning upon mourning, casting a black veil before my sight.  Adieu then, one last time, dear France; for never shall I see you more.\"    With these words, she went below, saying that she was the very opposite  of Dido, who, after the departure of AEneas, had done nothing but look  at the waves, while she, Mary, could not take her eyes off the land.  Then everyone gathered round her to try to divert and console her. But  she, growing sadder, and not being able to respond, so overcome was she  with tears, could hardly eat; and, having had a bed got ready on the  stern deck, she sent for the steersman, and ordered him if he still saw  land at daybreak, to come and wake her immediately. On this point Mary  was favoured; for the wind having dropped, when daybreak came the vessel  was still within sight of France.    It was a great joy when, awakened by the steersman, who had not  forgotten the order he had received, Mary raised herself on her couch,  and through the window that she had had opened, saw once more the  beloved shore. But at five o'clock in the morning, the wind having  freshened, the vessel rapidly drew farther away, so that soon the land  completely disappeared. Then Mary fell back upon her bed, pale as death,  murmuring yet once again--\"Adieu, France! I shall see thee no more.\"    Indeed, the happiest years of her life had just passed away in this  France that she so much regretted. Born amid the first religious  troubles, near the bedside of her dying father, the cradle mourning was  to stretch for her to the grave, and her stay in France had been a ray  of sunshine in her night. Slandered from her birth, the report was so  generally spread abroad that she was malformed, and that she could not  live to grow up, that one day her mother, Mary of Guise, tired of these  false rumours, undressed her and showed her naked to the English  ambassador, who had come, on the part of Henry VIII, to ask her in  marriage for the Prince of Wales, himself only five years old. Crowned  at nine months by Cardinal Beaton, archbishop of St. Andrews, she was  immediately hidden by her mother, who was afraid of treacherous dealing  in the King of England, in Stirling Castle. Two years later, not finding  even this fortress safe enough, she removed her to an island in the  middle of the Lake of Menteith, where a priory, the only building in the  place, provided an asylum for the royal child and for four young girls  born in the same year as herself, having like her the sweet name which  is an anagram of the word \"aimer,\" and who, quitting her neither in her  good nor in her evil fortune, were called the \"Queen's Marys\". They were  Mary Livingston, Mary Fleming, Mary Seyton, and Mary Beaton. Mary stayed  in this priory till Parliament, having approved her marriage with the  French dauphin, son of Henry II, she was taken to Dumbarton Castle, to  await the moment of departure. There she was entrusted to M. de Breze,  sent by Henry II to fetch her.

Mannheim is seen rising calm and smiling amid gardens  which once were ramparts, and which now surround and embrace it like a  girdle of foliage and flowers. Having reached this spot, he lifted his  cap, above the peak of which were embroidered three interlaced oak  leaves in silver, and uncovering his brow, stood bareheaded for a moment  to feel the fresh air that rose from the valley of the Neckar. At first  sight his irregular features produced a strange impression; but before  long the pallor of his face, deeply marked by smallpox, the infinite  gentleness of his eyes, and the elegant framework of his long and  flowing black hair, which grew in an admirable curve around a broad,  high forehead, attracted towards him that emotion of sad sympathy to  which we yield without inquiring its reason or dreaming of resistance.  Though it was still early, he seemed already to have come some distance,  for his boots were covered with dust; but no doubt he was nearing his  destination, for, letting his cap drop, and hooking into his belt his  long pipe, that inseparable companion of the German Borsch, he drew from  his pocket a little note-book, and wrote in it with a pencil: \"Left  Wanheim at five in the morning, came in sight of Mannheim at a  quarter-past nine.\" Then putting his note-book back into his pocket, he  stood motionless for a moment, his lips moving as though in mental  prayer, picked up his hat, and walked on again with a firm step towards  Mannheim.    This young Student was Karl-Ludwig Sand, who was coming from Jena, by  way of Frankfort aid Darmstadt, in order to assassinate Kotzebue.    Now, as we are about to set before our readers one of those terrible  actions for the true appreciation of which the conscience is the sole  judge, they must allow us to make them fully acquainted with him whom  kings regarded as an assassin, judges as a fanatic, and the youth of  Germany as a hero. Charles Louis Sand was born on the 5th of October,  1795, at Wonsiedel, in the Fichtel Wald; he was the youngest son of  Godfrey Christopher Sand, first president and councillor of justice to  the King of Prussia, and of Dorothea Jane Wilheltmina Schapf, his wife.  Besides two elder brothers, George, who entered upon a commercial career  at St, Gall, and Fritz, who was an advocate in the Berlin court of  appeal, he had an elder sister named Caroline, and a younger sister  called Julia.    While still in the cradle he had been attacked by smallpox of the most  malignant type. The virus having spread through all his body, laid bare  his ribs, and almost ate away his skull. For several months he lay  between life and death; but life at last gained the upper hand. He  remained weak and sickly, however, up to his seventh year, at which time  a brain fever attacked him; and again put his life in danger. As a  compensation, however, this fever, when it left him, seemed to carry  away with it all vestiges of his former illness. From that moment his  health and strength came into existence; but during these two long  illnesses his education had remained very backward, and it was not until  the age of eight that he could begin his elementary studies; moreover,  his physical sufferings having retarded his intellectual development, he  needed to work twice as hard as others to reach the same result.    Seeing the efforts that young Sand made, even while still quite a child,  to conquer the defects of his organisation, Professor Salfranck, a  learned and distinguished man, rector of the Hof gymnasium [college],  conceived such an affection for him, that when, at a later time, he was  appointed director of the gymnasium at Ratisbon, he could not part from  his pupil, and took him with him. In this town, and at the age of eleven  years, he gave the first proof of his courage and humanity. One day,  when he was walking with some young friends, he heard cries for help,  and ran in that direction: a little boy, eight or nine years old, had  just fallen into a pond. Sand immediately, without regarding his best  clothes, of which, however, he was very proud, sprang into the water,  and, after unheard-of efforts for a child of his age, succeeded in  bringing the drowning boy to land.    At the age of twelve or thirteen, Sand, who had become more active,  skilful, and determined than many of his elders, often amused himself by  giving battle to the lads of the town and of the neighbouring villages.  The theatre of these childish conflicts, which in their pale innocence  reflected the great battles that were at that time steeping Germany in  blood, was generally a plain extending from the town of Wonsiedel to the  mountain of St. Catherine, which had ruins at its top, and amid the  ruins a tower in excellent preservation. Sand, who was one of the most  eager fighters, seeing that his side had several times been defeated on  account of its numerical inferiority, resolved, in order to make up for  this drawback, to fortify the tower of St. Catherine, and to retire into  it at the next battle if its issue proved unfavourable to him. He  communicated this plan to his companions, who received it with  enthusiasm. A week was spent, accordingly, in collecting all possible  weapons of defence in the tower and in repairing its doors and stairs.  These preparations were made so secretly that the army of the enemy had  no knowledge of them.    Sunday came: the holidays were the days of battle. Whether because the  boys were ashamed of having been beaten last time, or for some other  reason, the band to which Sand belonged was even weaker than usual.  Sure, however, of a means of retreat, he accepted battle,  notwithstanding. The struggle was not a long one; the one party was too  weak in numbers to make a prolonged resistance, and began to retire in  the best order that could be maintained to St. Catherine's tower, which  was reached before much damage had been felt. Having arrived there, some  of the combatants ascended to the ramparts, and while the others  defended themselves at the foot of the wall, began to shower stones and  pebbles upon the conquerors. The latter, surprised at the new method of  defence which was now for the first time adopted, retreated a little;  the rest of the defenders took advantage of the moment to retire into  the fortress and shut the door. Great was the astonishment an the part  of the besiegers: they had always seen that door broken down, and lo!  all at once it was presenting to them a barrier which preserved the  besieged from their blows. Three or four went off to find instruments  with which to break it down and meanwhile the rest of the attacking  farce kept the garrison blockaded.    At the end of half an hour the messengers returned not only with levers  and picks, but also with a considerable reinforcement composed of lads  from, the village to which they had been to fetch tools.    Then began the assault: Sand and his companions defended themselves  desperately; but it was soon evident that, unless help came, the  garrison would be forced to capitulate. It was proposed that they should  draw lots, and that one of the besieged should be chosen, who in spite  of the danger should leave the tower, make his way as best he might  through the enemy's army, and go to summon the other lads of Wonsiedel,  who had faint-heartedly remained at home. The tale of the peril in which  their Comrades actually were, the disgrace of a surrender, which would  fall upon all of them, would no doubt overcome their indolence and  induce them to make a diversion that would allow the garrison to attempt  sortie. This suggestion was adopted; but instead of leaving the decision  to chance, Sand proposed himself as the messenger. As everybody knew his  courage, his skill, and his lightness of foot, the proposition was  unanimously accepted, and the new Decius prepared to execute his act of  devotion. The deed was not free from danger: there were but two means of  egress, one by way of the door, which would lead to the fugitive's  falling immediately into the hands of the enemy; the other by jumping  from a rampart so high that the enemy had not set a guard there. Sand  without a moment's hesitation went to the rampart, where, always  religious, even in his childish pleasures, he made a short prayer; then,  without fear, without hesitation, with a confidence that was almost  superhuman, he sprang to the ground: the distance was twenty-two feet.  Sand flew instantly to Wonsiedel, and reached it, although the enemy had  despatched their best runners in pursuit. Then the garrison, seeing the  success of their enterprise, took fresh courage, and united their  efforts against the besiegers, hoping everything from Sand's eloquence,  which gave him a great influence over his young companions. And, indeed,  in half an hour he was seen reappearing at the head of some thirty boys  of his own age, armed with slings and crossbows. The besiegers, on the  point of being attacked before and behind, recognised the disadvantage  of their position and retreated. The victory remained with Sand's party,  and all the honours of the day were his.    We have related this anecdote in detail, that our readers may understand"]]]
