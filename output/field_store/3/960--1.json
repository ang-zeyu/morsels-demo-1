MASSACHUSETTS    U . S . A          PREFACE      The four books of this series have been written not merely to provide  agreeable reading matter for children, but to give them information.  When a child can look at a steel pen not simply as an article  furnished by the city for his use, but rather as the result of many  interesting processes, he has made a distinct growth in intelligence.  When he has begun to apprehend the fruitfulness of the earth, both  above ground and below, and the best way in which its products may be  utilized and carried to the places where they are needed, he has not  only acquired a knowledge of many kinds of industrial life which may  help him to choose his life-work wisely from among them, but he has  learned the dependence of one person upon other persons, of one  part of the world upon other parts, and the necessity of peaceful  intercourse. Best of all, he has learned to see. Wordsworth's familiar  lines say of a man whose eyes had not been opened,--      \"A primrose by a river's brim    A yellow primrose was to him,    And it was nothing more.\"    These books are planned to show the children that there is \"something  more\"; to broaden their horizon; to reveal to them what invention has  accomplished and what wide room for invention still remains; to teach  them that reward comes to the man who improves his output beyond the  task of the moment; and that success is waiting, not for him who works  because he must, but for him who works because he may.

We had no flint and steel. We were neither  Indians nor Boy Scouts, and we did not know how to make a fire by  twirling a stick. There was nothing to do but to trudge off through  the snow to the neighbor a mile away and beg some matches. Then was  the time when we appreciated the little match and thought with  profound respect of the men who invented and perfected it.    It is a long way from the safe and reliable match of to-day back to  the splinters that were soaked in chemicals and sold together with  little bottles of sulphuric acid. The splinter was expected to blaze  when dipped into the acid. Sometimes it did blaze, and sometimes it  did not; but it was reasonably certain how the acid would behave, for  it would always sputter and do its best to spoil some one's clothes.  Nevertheless, even such matches as these were regarded as a wonderful  convenience, and were sold at five dollars a hundred. With the next  kind of match that appeared, a piece of folded sandpaper was sold, and  the buyer was told to pinch it hard and draw the match through the  fold. These matches were amazingly cheap--eighty-four of them for only  twenty-five cents! There have been all sorts of odd matches. One kind  actually had a tiny glass ball at the end full of sulphuric acid. To  light this, you had to pinch the ball and the acid that was thus let  out acted upon the other chemicals on the match and kindled it--or was  expected to kindle it, which was not always the same thing.    Making matches is a big business, even if one hundred of them are  sold for a cent. It is estimated that on an average each person uses  seven matches every day. To provide so many would require some seven  hundred million matches a day in this country alone. It seems like  a very simple matter to cut a splinter of wood, dip it into some  chemicals, and pack it into a box for sale; and it would be simple  if it were all done by hand, but the matches would also be irregular  and extremely expensive. The way to make anything cheap and uniform  is to manufacture it by machinery.    [Illustration: THE ENDLESS MATCH MACHINE    The match splints are set in tiny holes like pins in a pincushion, and  the belt revolves, passing their heads through various chemicals.]    The first step in making matches is to select some white-pine plank of  good quality and cut it into blocks of the proper size. These are fed  into a machine which sends sharp dies through them and thus cuts the  match splints. Over the splint cutter a carrier chain is continuously  moving, and into holes in this chain the ends of the match splints  are forced at the rate of ten or twelve thousand a minute.    The splints remain in the chain for about an hour, and during this  hour all sorts of things happen to them. First, they are dipped into  hot paraffin wax, because this will light even more easily than wood.  As soon as the wax is dry, the industrious chain carries them over a  dipping-roll covered with a layer consisting partly of glue and rosin.  Currents of air now play upon the splint, and in about ten minutes the  glue and rosin on one end of it have hardened into a hard bulb. It is  not a match yet by any means, for scratching it would not make it  light. The phosphorus which is to make it into a match is on another  dipping-roll. This is sesqui-sulphide of phosphorus. The common yellow  phosphorus is poisonous, and workmen in match factories where it was  used were in danger of suffering from a terrible disease of the jaw  bone. At length it was discovered that sesqui-sulphide of phosphorus  would make just as good matches and was harmless. Our largest match  company held the patent giving them the exclusive right to certain  processes by which the sesqui-sulphide was made; and this patent they  generously gave up to the people of the United States.    After the splints have been dipped into the preparation of phosphorus,  they are carried about on the chain vertically, horizontally, on the  outside of some wheels and the inside of others, and through currents  of air. Then they are turned over to a chain divided into sections  which carries them to a packing-machine. This machine packs them into  boxes, a certain number in each box, and they are slid down to girls  who make the boxes into packages. These are put into wooden containers  and are ready for sale.    As in most manufactures, these processes must be carried on with  great care and exactness. The wood must be carefully selected and of  straight grain, the dipping-rolls must be kept covered with a fresh  supply of composition, and its depth must be always uniform. Even the  currents of air in which the splints are dried must be just warm  enough to dry them and just moist enough not to dry them too rapidly.    The old sulphur matches made in \"card and block\" can no longer be  bought in this country; the safety match has taken their place. One  kind of safety match has the phosphorus on the box and the other  igniting substances on the match, so that the match will not light  unless it is scratched on the box; but this kind has never been a  favorite in the United States. The second kind, the one generally  used, may be struck anywhere, but these matches are safe because  even stepping upon one will not light it; it must be scratched.    A match is a little thing, but nothing else can do its work.          II    ABOUT INDIA RUBBER      When you pick a dandelion or a milkweed, a white sticky \"milk\" oozes  out; and this looks just like the juice of the various sorts of trees,  shrubs, and vines from which India rubber is made. The \"rubber plant\"  which has been such a favorite in houses is one of these; in India it  becomes a large tree which has the peculiar habit of dropping down  from its branches \"bush-ropes,\" as they are called. These take root  and become stout trunks. There is literally a \"rubber belt\" around the  world, for nearly all rubber comes from the countries lying between  the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. More than half of  all that is brought to market is produced in the valley of the Amazon  River; and some of this \"Para rubber,\" as it is called, from the  seaport whence it is shipped, is the best in the world.

Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society; Member of    the British Astronomical Association; Member of    the Astronomical Society of the Pacific; Membre    de la Societe Astronomique de France;    Membre de la Societe Belge    d'Astronomie          With a Frontispiece in Colour    and 45 Illustrations & Diagrams        _THIRD EDITION_        LONDON    SEELEY AND CO. LIMITED    38 GREAT RUSSELL STREET    1910          PREFACE      The object of this book is to give an account of the science of  Astronomy, as it is known at the present day, in a manner acceptable to  the _general reader_.    It is too often supposed that it is impossible to acquire any useful  knowledge of Astronomy without much laborious study, and without  adventuring into quite a new world of thought. The reasoning applied to  the study of the celestial orbs is, however, of no different order from  that which is employed in the affairs of everyday life. The science of  mathematics is perhaps responsible for the idea that some kind of  difference does exist; but mathematical processes are, in effect, no  more than ordinary logic in concentrated form, the _shorthand of  reasoning_, so to speak. I have attempted in the following pages to take  the main facts and theories of Astronomy out of those mathematical forms  which repel the general reader, and to present them in the _ordinary  language of our workaday world_.    The few diagrams introduced are altogether supplementary, and are not  connected with the text by any wearying cross-references. Each diagram  is complete in itself, being intended to serve as a pictorial aid, in  case the wording of the text should not have perfectly conveyed the  desired meaning. The full page illustrations are also described as  adequately as possible at the foot of each.    As to the coloured frontispiece, this must be placed in a category by  itself. It is the work of the _artist_ as distinct from the scientist.    The book itself contains incidentally a good deal of matter concerned  with the Astronomy of the past, the introduction of which has been found  necessary in order to make clearer the Astronomy of our time.    It would be quite impossible for me to enumerate here the many sources  from which information has been drawn. But I acknowledge my especial  indebtedness to Professor F.R. Moulton's _Introduction to Astronomy_  (Macmillan, 1906), to the works on Eclipses of the late Rev. S.J.  Johnson and of Mr. W.T. Lynn, and to the excellent _Journals of the  British Astronomical Association_. Further, for those grand questions  concerned with the Stellar Universe at large, I owe a very deep debt to  the writings of the famous American astronomer, Professor Simon Newcomb,  and of our own countryman, Mr. John Ellard Gore; to the latter of whom I  am under an additional obligation for much valuable information  privately rendered.    In my search for suitable illustrations, I have been greatly aided by  the kindly advice of Mr. W. H. Wesley, the Assistant Secretary of the  Royal Astronomical Society. To those who have been so good as to permit  me to reproduce pictures and photographs, I desire to record my best  thanks as follows:--To the French Artist, Mdlle. Andree Moch; to the  Astronomer Royal; to Sir David Gill, K.C.B., LL.D., F.R.S.; to the  Council of the Royal Astronomical Society; to Professor E.B. Frost,  Director of the Yerkes Observatory; to M.P. Puiseux, of the Paris  Observatory; to Dr. Max Wolf, of Heidelberg; to Professor Percival  Lowell; to the Rev. Theodore E.R. Phillips, M.A., F.R.A.S.; to Mr. W.H.  Wesley; to the Warner and Swasey Co., of Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.; to the  publishers of _Knowledge_, and to Messrs. Sampson, Low & Co. For  permission to reproduce the beautiful photograph of the Spiral Nebula in  Canes Venatici (Plate XXII.), I am indebted to the distinguished  astronomer, the late Dr. W.E. Wilson, D.Sc., F.R.S., whose untimely  death, I regret to state, occurred in the early part of this year.    Finally, my best thanks are due to Mr. John Ellard Gore, F.R.A.S.,  M.R.I.A., to Mr. W.H. Wesley, and to Mr. John Butler Burke, M.A., of  Cambridge, for their kindness in reading the proof-sheets.    CECIL G. DOLMAGE.
