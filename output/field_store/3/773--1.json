RELIGIONS OF ANCIENT CHINA        CHAPTER I -- THE ANCIENT FAITH    Philosophical Theory of the Universe.--The problem of the universe has  never offered the slightest difficulty to Chinese philosophers. Before  the beginning of all things, there was Nothing. In the lapse of ages  Nothing coalesced into Unity, the Great Monad. After more ages, the  Great Monad separated into Duality, the Male and Female Principles in  nature; and then, by a process of biogenesis, the visible universe was  produced.    Popular Cosmogeny.--An addition, however, to this simple system had to  be made, in deference to, and on a plane with, the intelligence of the  masses. According to this, the Male and Female Principles were each  subdivided into Greater and Lesser, and then from the interaction of  these four agencies a being, named P'an Ku, came into existence. He  seems to have come into life endowed with perfect knowledge, and his  function was to set the economy of the universe in order. He is often  depicted as wielding a huge adze, and engaged in constructing the world.  With his death the details of creation began. His breath became the  wind; his voice, the thunder; his left eye, the sun; his right eye, the  moon; his blood flowed in rivers; his hair grew into trees and plants;  his flesh became the soil; his sweat descended as rain; while the  parasites which infested his body were the origin of the human race.    Recognition and Worship of Spirits.--Early Chinese writers tell us that  Fu Hsi, B.C. 2953-2838, was the first Emperor to organize sacrifices to,  and worship of, spirits. In this he was followed by the Yellow Emperor,  B.C. 2698-2598, who built a temple for the worship of God, in which  incense was used, and first sacrificed to the Mountains and Rivers. He  is also said to have established the worship of the sun, moon, and five  planets, and to have elaborated the ceremonial of ancestral worship.    God the Father, Earth the Mother.--The Yellow Emperor was followed by  the Emperor Shao Hao, B.C. 2598-2514, \"who instituted the music of the  Great Abyss in order to bring spirits and men into harmony.\" Then  came the Emperor Chuan Hsu, B.C. 2514-2436, of whom it is said that he  appointed an officer \"to preside over the worship of God and Earth,  in order to form a link between the spirits and man,\" and also \"caused  music to be played for the enjoyment of God.\" Music, by the way, is said  to have been introduced into worship in imitation of thunder, and was  therefore supposed to be pleasing to the Almighty. After him followed  the Emperor Ti K'u, B.C. 2436-2366, who dabbled in astronomy, and \"came  to a knowledge of spiritual beings, which he respectfully worshipped.\"  The Emperor Yao, B.C. 2357-2255, built a temple for the worship of  God, and also caused dances to be performed for the enjoyment of God  on occasions of special sacrifice and communication with the spiritual  world. After him, we reach the Emperor Shun, B.C. 2255-2205, in whose  favour Yao abdicated.    Additional Deities.--Before, however, Shun ventured to mount the throne,  he consulted the stars, in order to find out if the unseen Powers were  favourable to his elevation; and on receiving a satisfactory reply, \"he  proceeded to sacrifice to God, to the Six Honoured Ones (unknown), to  the Mountains and Rivers, and to Spirits in general. . . . In the second  month of the year, he made a tour of inspection eastwards, as far as  Mount T'ai (in modern Shantung), where he presented a burnt offering to  God, and sacrificed to the Mountains and Rivers.\"    God punishes the wicked and rewards the good.--The Great Yu, who drained  the empire, and came to the throne in B.C. 2205 as first Emperor of the  Hsia dynasty, followed in the lines of his pious predecessors. But the  Emperor K'ung Chia, B.C. 1879-1848, who at first had treated the Spirits  with all due reverence, fell into evil ways, and was abandoned by God.  This was the beginning of the end. In B.C. 1766 T'ang the Completer,  founder of the Shang dynasty, set to work to overthrow Chieh Kuei, the  last ruler of the Hsia dynasty. He began by sacrificing to Almighty  God, and asked for a blessing on his undertaking. And in his subsequent  proclamation to the empire, he spoke of that God as follows: \"God has  given to every man a conscience; and if all men acted in accordance with  its dictates, they would not stray from the right path. . . . The way of  God is to bless the good and punish the bad. He has sent down calamities  on the House of Hsia, to make manifest its crimes.\"    God manifests displeasure.--In B.C. 1637 the Emperor T'ai Mou succeeded.  His reign was marked by the supernatural appearance in the palace of two  mulberry-trees, which in a single night grew to such a size that  they could hardly be spanned by two hands. The Emperor was terrified;  whereupon a Minister said, \"No prodigy is a match for virtue. Your  Majesty's government is no doubt at fault, and some reform of conduct  is necessary.\" Accordingly, the Emperor began to act more circumspectly;  after which the mulberry-trees soon withered and died.    Revelation in a dream.--The Emperor Wu Ting, B.C. 1324-1264, began his  reign by not speaking for three years, leaving all State affairs to be  decided by his Prime Minister, while he himself gained experience.  Later on, the features of a sage were revealed to him in a dream; and  on waking, he caused a portrait of the apparition to be prepared and  circulated throughout the empire. The sage was found, and for a long  time aided the Emperor in the right administration of government. On the  occasion of a sacrifice, a pheasant perched upon the handle of the great  sacrificial tripod, and crowed, at which the Emperor was much alarmed.  \"Be not afraid,\" cried a Minister; \"but begin by reforming your  government. God looks down upon mortals, and in accordance with their  deserts grants them many years or few. God does not shorten men's  lives; they do that themselves. Some are wanting in virtue, and will not  acknowledge their transgressions; only when God chastens them do they  cry, What are we to do?\"    Anthropomorphism and Fetishism.--One of the last Emperors of the Shang  dynasty, Wu I, who reigned B.C. 1198-1194, even went so far as \"to make  an image in human form, which he called God. With this image he used  to play at dice, causing some one to throw for the image; and if 'God'  lost, he would overwhelm the image with insult. He also made a bag of  leather, which he filled with blood and hung up. Then he would shoot at  it, saying that he was shooting God. By and by, when he was out hunting,  he was struck down by a violent thunderclap, and killed.\"    God indignant.--Finally, when the Shang dynasty sank into the lowest  depths of moral abasement, King Wu, who charged himself with its  overthrow, and who subsequently became the first sovereign of the Chou  dynasty, offered sacrifices to Almighty God, and also to Mother Earth.  \"The King of Shang,\" he said in his address to the high officers who  collected around him, \"does not reverence God above, and inflicts  calamities on the people below. Almighty God is moved with indignation.\"  On the day of the final battle he declared that he was acting in the  matter of punishment merely as the instrument of God; and after his  great victory and the establishment of his own line, it was to God that  he rendered thanks.    No Devil, No Hell.--In this primitive monotheism, of which only scanty,  but no doubt genuine, records remain, no place was found for any being  such as the Buddhist Mara or the Devil of the Old and New Testaments.  God inflicted His own punishments by visiting calamities on mankind,  just as He bestowed His own rewards by sending bounteous harvests in due  season. Evil spirits were a later invention, and their operations were  even then confined chiefly to tearing people's hearts out, and so forth,  for their own particular pleasure; we certainly meet no cases of evil  spirits wishing to undermine man's allegiance to God, or desiring to  make people wicked in order to secure their everlasting punishment.

But when I look at  Maria's picture on my desk, I realize it couldn't have been a dream.  Actually, it was only six months ago that I sat at this same desk,  looking at her picture, wondering what could have happened to her. It  had been six weeks since there had been any word from her, and she had  promised to write as soon as she arrived in Europe. Considering that my  future rested in her small hands, I had every right to be apprehensive.    We had grown up together, had lost our folks within a few years of each  other and had been fond of each other the way kids are apt to be. Then  the change came: It seemed I loved her, and she was still just \"fond\" of  me. During our early college days I sort of let things ride, but once we  went on to graduate school, I began to crowd her.    The next thing I knew, she had signed up with a student tour destined  for Central Europe, and told me she would give me my answer when she  returned. I had to be content with that, but couldn't help worrying.  Maria was a strange girl--withdrawn, dreamy and soft-hearted. Knowing  the section she was going to, I was inclined to be uneasy, since it is  the realm of gypsies, fortune tellers and the like. It is also the  birthplace of many strange legends, and Maria claimed to be strongly  psychic. As a matter of fact, she had foretold one or two things which  were probably coincidental, like the death of our parents, and which  even made an impression on me--and you'd hardly call me a \"believer.\"    This so-called talent of hers led her into trouble on more than one  occasion. I remember in her senior year at college she fell under the  spell of a short, fat, greasy spook-reader with a strictly phony accent  and all but gave her eye teeth away, until I realized something was  amiss, got to the bottom of it, and dispatched friend spook-reader  _pronto_. If she should meet some unscrupulous person now, with no one  around to get her out of the scrape--but I didn't want to think of that.  I was sure this time everything would be all right.    When she didn't write at first, I let it go that she was busy. Finally,  six weeks' silent treatment aroused my curiosity. It also aroused my  nasty temper, and the next thing I knew I was on a plane bound for the  Continent. Within two hours after landing, I found her at a little inn  in Transylvania, a quaint little place that looked as if it were made of  gingerbread, and was surrounded by the huge, craggy Transylvania  Mountain range. I also found Tod Hunter.    \"What's wrong, Maria? Why didn't you write?\" I asked.    Her usually gay, shining brown eyes flashed angrily. \"Why couldn't you  leave me alone? I told you not to come after me. I came here so I could  think this out. For God's sake, Bill, can't you see I wanted to think?  To be by myself?\"    \"But you promised to write,\" I persisted, wondering at this change in  her, this impatience. Wondered, too, at her wraithlike slimness. She'd  always been curved in the right places.    \"Maria has been studying much too diligently,\" Tod said slowly. \"She's  always tired lately. She hasn't been too well, either. Her throat  bothers her.\"           *       *       *       *       *    I wanted to punch his head in. For some reason I didn't like him. Not  because I sensed his rivalry; I was above that. God knows I wanted her  to be happy, above everything. It was just something about him that  irritated me. An attitude. Not supercilious; I could have coped with  that. Rather, it was a calm imperturbability that seemed to speak his  faith in his eventual success, regardless of any effort on my part.    I don't know how to fight that sort of strategy. I look like I am: blunt  and obvious. Suddenly I didn't care if he was there.    \"Maria. Ria, darling. This guy's no good for you, can't you see that?  What do you know about him?\"    She looked at me, her eyes surprised and a little hurt. Then she looked  at him, seemed to be looking _through_ him and into herself, if you know  what I mean. A slow flush spread from the base of her throat, that thin,  almost transparent throat.    \"All I have to know,\" she said softly. \"I love him.\"    She looked out the window. \"I'm going up into _Konigstein Mountain_, to  a small sanitarium for my health shortly; the doctor has told me I must  go away, and Tod has suggested this place. There Tod and I shall be  married.\"    I knew then how it felt to be on the receiving end of a monkey-punch.  That she had come to this decision because of my objections, I had not  the slightest doubt. She was going to marry someone about whom she knew  absolutely nothing. She was much more ill than she knew. Hunter was  undoubtedly after her money; she was considerably well-off. Obviously  she was once more being influenced in the wrong direction.    \"I won't let you!\" I warned. \"Give it some more time, if for nothing  else, then for old times' sake.\"    \"How about me, Morris?\" Tod interrupted. \"You haven't asked me my  feelings on the subject. I happen to love Maria dearly. Have I no say  just because you're a childhood friend of hers?\"    \"Childhood friend! I was her whole family for years before she ever  heard of you! I'll see you in hell before I let her marry you!\" I  shouted. Looking back, I'm sure that had he said anything else, I would  have killed him, if Ria hadn't come between us.    \"That's enough, Bill Morris! I've heard all I want to from you. I'm  twenty-three, and if I choose to marry Tod, I'll do so and there's  nothing you can do about it. Now, please go.\"    \"Okay, Ria,\" I said, \"if that's the way you want it. But I'm not  through. If you won't protect yourself, I'll do it for you. I'd like to  know more about the mysterious Mr. Tod Hunter, American, and I do wish,  for your own sake, you'd do the same. I wouldn't care if you married  King Tut, so long as you knew all about him. People just don't marry  strangers; not if they're smart. For God's sake, ask him about himself!\"    \"All right, Bill,\" she replied, smiling patiently. \"I'll ask him. Now,  do stop being childish.\"    \"Okay, darling,\" I said sheepishly. \"But do me one more favor. Don't  marry him until I get back. Only a little while; give me a week. Just  wait a little longer.\"    As I closed the door, I could still feel his smile, mocking--yet a  little sad.    But Maria didn't wait. I was gone a week. I had walked my legs off  trying to track down the elusive Mister Hunter and discovered  exactly--nothing. All his landlady could tell me was that he was an  American who had come to this climate for his health, and that he slept  late mornings. I was licked and I knew it. If I had been a pup, I would  have fitted my tail neatly between my legs and made for home. But I  wasn't a pup, so I headed straight for Ria's flat to face the music.           *       *       *       *       *    They were waiting for me, she and Tod. When I saw her, I wished I were  dead.    She lay in Tod's arms, her body a mere whisper of a body. White and cold  she was, like frozen milk on a cold winter's day. They were both dead.    You know how it is when at a wake someone views the deceased and says  kindly, \"She's beautiful,\" and \"she\" isn't beautiful at all; just a  made-up, lifeless handful of clay. Dead as dead, and frightening. Well,  it wasn't that way this time. Their fair skins were faintly pink-tinted  and their blonde heads, hers ashen and his a reddish cast, gleamed  brightly. And they sat so close in the sofa before the fire, his head  resting in the hollow of her throat. They looked--peaceful; no line  marred their faces. I almost fancied I saw them breathe. And on her  third finger, left hand, was the ring--a thin, platinum band. He had  won, and in winning somehow he had lost. How they had died and why they  found each other and death at the same time, I would probably never  know. I only knew one thing: I had to get away from there--quickly. I  almost ran the distance to my flat. Stumbled into the place and poured a  triple Scotch which I could scarcely hold. The Scotch seared my throat  and tasted bitter; someone must have poured salt in it. Then I realized  that it was tears--my tears. I, Bill Morris, who hadn't cried since my  fifth birthday--I was sobbing like a baby.    I didn't call the police. That would mean I would have to go back and  watch them cover that lovely body, carry it away and submit it to untold  indignities in order to ascertain the cause of death. The cleaning girl  would find them in the morning and would notify the police.    But it wasn't so simple as that. In the morning I found I couldn't shake  off the guilt which possessed me. Even two bottles of Scotch hadn't  helped me to forget. I was dead drunk and cold sober at the same time.    I phoned Ria's landlady and told her I had failed to reach the Hunters  by phone, that I was sure something was amiss. Would she please go to  their flat and see if anything was wrong.    She was amused. \"Really, Mr. Morris, you must be mistaken. Miss Maria  went out just an hour ago with her new husband. Surely you are jesting.  Why she has never looked better. So happy. They have left for  _Konigstein_. They have also left you a note.    I told her I would be right over, and hopped a cab. I began to think I  was losing my mind. I had seen them both--dead. The landlady had seen  them this morning--_alive!_\"    When I arrived, the landlady looked at me for a long moment, taking in  my rough, dark-blue complexion, unpressed clothes, red-rimmed eyes, then  wagged a finger playfully.    \"You are playing a joke, no? A wedding joke, maybe."]]]
