His mother escaped with Trotter and his  brother via the Underground Railroad, and they settled in Cincinnati,  where Trotter became a teacher. He moved to Boston and fought in the  Civil War, becoming the first African-American to achieve the rank of  Second Lieutenant in the Union Army. He later became the first  African-American to be employed by the U.S. Post Office, but resigned  in protest when discrimination prevented his promotion. His _Music and  Some Highly Musical People,_ written in 1878, is said to be the first  comprehensive study of music written in the United States. In 1887,  President Cleveland appointed Trotter to the office of Recorder of  Deeds for the District of Columbia, succeeding the great  African-American statesman Frederick Douglass in what was then the  highest government position to be attained by an African-American.

[signature] Jas. M. Trotter]          PREFACE.      The purposes of this volume will be so very apparent to even the most  casual observer, as to render an extended explanation here  unnecessary. The author will therefore only say, that he has  endeavored faithfully to perform what he was convinced was a  much-needed service, not so much, perhaps, to the cause of music  itself, as to some of its noblest devotees and the race to which the  latter belong.    The inseparable relationship existing between music and its worthy  exponents gives, it is believed, full showing of propriety to the  course hereinafter pursued,--that of mingling the praises of both.  But, in truth, there was little need to speak in praise of music. Its  tones of melody and harmony require only to be heard in order to  awaken in the breast emotions the most delightful. And yet who can  speak at all of an agency so charming in other than words of warmest  praise? Again: if music be a thing of such consummate beauty, what  else can be done but to tender an offering of praise, and even of  gratitude, to those, who, by the invention of most pleasing  combinations of tones, melodies, and harmonies, or by great skill in  vocal or instrumental performance, so signally help us to the fullest  understanding and enjoyment of it?    As will be seen by a reference to the introductory chapters, in which  the subject of music is separately considered, an attempt has been  made not only to form by them a proper setting for the personal  sketches that follow, but also to render the book entertaining to  lovers of the art in general.    While grouping, as has here been done, the musical celebrities of a  single race; while gathering from near and far these many fragments of  musical history, and recording them in one book,--the writer yet  earnestly disavows all motives of a distinctively clannish nature. But  the haze of complexional prejudice has so much obscured the vision of  many persons, that they cannot see (at least, there are many who  affect not to see) that musical faculties, and power for their  _artistic_ development, are not in the exclusive possession of the  fairer-skinned race, but are alike the beneficent gifts of the Creator  to all his children. Besides, there are some well-meaning persons who  have formed, for lack of the information which is here afforded,  erroneous and unfavorable estimates of the art-capabilities of the  colored race. In the hope, then, of contributing to the formation of a  more just opinion, of inducing a cheerful admission of its existence,  and of aiding to establish between both races relations of mutual  respect and good feeling; of inspiring the people most concerned (if  that be necessary) with a greater pride in their own achievements, and  confidence in their own resources, as a basis for other and even  greater acquirements, as a landmark, a partial guide, for a future and  better chronicler; and, finally, as a sincere tribute to the winning  power, the noble beauty, of music, a contemplation of whose own divine  harmony should ever serve to promote harmony between man and  man,--with these purposes in view, this humble volume is hopefully  issued.

First Edition, 1908  Reprinted, 1909          PREFACE      A preface ought not to contain an apology. But mine must contain at  least an explanation, if only of omissions. The Highways and Byways of  Surrey belong not to one county or to one period of time, but to two  different ages, and, to-day, to two counties. London has made the  difference. What was Surrey country a hundred years ago has been  gathered into the network of London streets, and belongs, in the mind  and on the map, to London. Almost for ten miles south of the London  Thames the old Surrey countryside has disappeared, and the disappearance  has left the writer of a book of Surrey Highways a difficult choice. It  would have been easy to fill a large part of the book with the Surrey of  the past, the Surrey of Southwark, and the great church of St. Mary  Overie, and of Lambeth Palace and the Archbishops, of Vauxhall, and the  Paris Gardens, and the Bankside where Shakespeare brought out his plays.  But it is not easy to write anything new of any part of Surrey, and of  that part I could have written nothing new at all. So that it seemed  best to leave the Surrey that has disappeared to writers who have dealt  with its history far more adequately than I could, and to choose for the  Highways and Byways of this book only those which still run through open  country and through country villages and towns. That is the Surrey of  to-day.    The general plan of the book is simple. I have entered the county from  the west at Farnham, with the old Way along the chalk ridge, and I leave  it by Titsey on the east. Of course, not all the Surrey villages belong  to the ridge, though the chief towns lie along it. Other villages set  themselves along the banks of the two Surrey rivers, the Wey and the  Mole, and there are separate little groups like the villages of the Fold  country, or on the plateaux of the Downs round Epsom, or between  Chertsey and Windsor on the Thames. These group themselves in their own  chapters. But the main progress of the book is the trend of the great  Surrey highway. As to following the book through its chapters from west  to east, Surrey is threaded by such a net of railways that the  deliberate choosing of a route, with definite centres and points of  departure, is unnecessary. But those who believe that the best way to  see any country is to walk through it will find that, as a general rule,  the book and its chapters are divided, sometimes naturally, sometimes  perhaps a little perversely, into the compass of a day's walking. My own  plan has been simple enough: it has been to set out in the morning and  walk till it was dark, and then take the train back to where I came  from. Others will be able to plan far more comprehensive journeys by  motor-car, or by bicycling, or on horseback--though not many, perhaps,  ride horses by Surrey roads to-day. But only by walking would it be  possible to explore much of the country. You would never, except by  walking, come at the meaning or read the story of the ancient Way, or  the Pilgrims' Road that follows it; only on foot can you climb the hills  as you please, or follow the path where it chooses to take you. It is  only by walking that you will get to the best of the Thursley heather,  or the Bagshot pines and gorse, or the whortleberries in the wind on  Leith Hill, or the primroses of the Fold country, or the birds that call  through the quiet of the Wey Canal--though there, too, you may take a  boat; it is one of the prettiest of the byways. The walker through  Surrey sees the best; the others see not much more than the road and  what stands on the road.    The omission, or rather neglect, of Surrey in London is deliberate.  There must be many other omissions, I fear, which are not. For pointing  out some of them, and for suggesting alterations and additions, I have  to thank my friend Mr. Anthony Collett, who has kindly looked through my  proofs. I should like also to be the first to thank Mr. Hugh Thomson for  the pleasure and the help of his charming sketches.         WEYBRIDGE, _October, 1908_           ERIC PARKER.      NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION    I have made several additions to the second edition of this book, and, I  hope, have corrected some mistakes. I am greatly indebted to reviewers  who have pointed out errors and omissions, and to correspondents who  have kindly written to me.
