Owing to  exigencies of space, much of what I then said has been omitted here,  especially with regard to the worship of Siva; but enough remains to  make clear my general view, which is that the religion of the Aryans  of India was essentially a worship of spirits--sometimes spirits of  real persons, sometimes imaginary spirits--and that, although in early  days it provisionally found room for personifications of natural  forces, it could not digest them into Great Gods, and therefore they  have either disappeared or, if surviving, remain as mere Struldbrugs.  Thus I am a heretic in relation to both the Solar Theory and the  Vegetation Theory, as everyone must be who takes the trouble to study  Hindu nature without prejudice.    L. D.

They  desire above all things that, in their humble way, these books shall  be the ambassadors of goodwill and understanding between East and  West--the old world of Thought and the new of Action. In this  endeavour, and in their own sphere, they are but followers of the  highest example in the land. They are confident that a deeper  knowledge of the great ideals and lofty philosophy of Oriental thought  may help to a revival of that true spirit of Charity which neither  despises nor fears the nations of another creed and colour.

It is made up of a  few large huts, round which cluster smaller ones, all of them rudely  built, mostly of bamboo; in the other larger ones dwell the heads of  families, while the smaller ones shelter their kinsfolk and followers,  for this is a patriarchal world, and the housefather gives the law to  his household. The people are mostly a comely folk, tall and  clean-limbed, and rather fair of skin, with well-cut features and  straight noses; but among them are not a few squat and ugly men and  women, flat-nosed and nearly black in colour, who were once the free  dwellers in this land, and now have become slaves or serfs to their  Aryan conquerors. Around the village are fields where bullocks are  dragging rough ploughs; and beyond these are woods and moors in which  lurk wild men, and beyond these are the lands of other Aryan tribes.  Life in the village is simple and rude, but not uneventful, for the  village is part of a tribe, and tribes are constantly fighting with  one another, as well as with the dark-skinned men who often try to  drive back the Aryans, sometimes in small forays and sometimes in  massed hordes. But the world in which the village is interested is a  small one, and hardly extends beyond the bounds of the land where its  tribe dwells. It knows something of the land of the Five Rivers, in  one corner of which it lives, and something even of the lands to the  north of it, and to the west as far as the mountains and deserts,  where live men of its own kind and tongue; but beyond these limits it  has no knowledge. Only a few bold spirits have travelled eastward  across the high slope that divides the land of the Five Rivers from  the strange and mysterious countries around the great rivers Ganga and  Yamuna, the unknown land of deep forests and swarming dark-skinned  men.    In the matter of religion these Aryans care a good deal about charms  and spells, black and white magic, for preventing or curing all kinds  of diseases or mishaps, for winning success in love and war and trade  and husbandry, for bringing harm upon enemies or rivals--charms which  a few centuries later will be dressed up in Rigvedic style, stuffed  out with imitations of Rigvedic hymns, and published under the name of  Atharva veda, \"the lore of the Atharvans,\" by wizards who claim to  belong to the old priestly clans of Atharvan and Angiras. But we have  not yet come so far, and as yet all that these people can tell us is a  great deal about their black and white magic, in which they are hugely  interested, and a fair amount about certain valiant men of olden times  who are now worshipped by them as helpful spirits, and a little about  some vague spirits who are in the sun and the air and the fire and  other places, and are very high and great, but are not interesting at  all.    This popular religion seems to be a hopeless one, without ideals and  symbols of love and hope. Is there nothing better to be found in this  place? Yes, there is a priestly religion also; and if we would know  something about it we must listen to the chanting of the priests, the  _brahmans_ or men of the \"holy spirit,\" as they are called, who are  holding a sacrifice now on behalf of the rich lord who lives in the  largest house in the village--a service for which they expect to be  paid with a handsome fee of oxen and gold. They are priests by  heredity, wise in the knowledge of the ways of the gods; some of them  understand how to compose _riks_, or hymns, in the fine speech dear to  their order, hymns which are almost sure to win the gods' favour, and  all of them know how the sacrifices shall be performed with perfect  exactness so that no slip or imperfection may mar their efficacy.  Their psalms are called _Rig-veda_, \"lore of the verses,\" and they set  themselves to find grace in the ears of the many gods whom these  priests worship, sometimes by open praise and sometimes by riddling  description of the exploits and nature of the gods. Often they are  very fine; but always they are the work of priests, artists in ritual.  And if you look heedfully into it you will also mark that these  priests are inclined to think that the act of sacrifice, the offering  of, say, certain oblations in a particular manner with particular  words accompanying them, is in itself potent, quite apart from the  psalms which they sing over it, that it has a magic power of its own  over the machinery of nature.[1] Really this is no new idea of our  Vedic priests; ten thousand years before them their remote forefathers  believed it and acted upon it, and if for example they wanted rain  they would sprinkle drops of water and utter magic words. Our Vedic  priests have now a different kind of symbols, but all the same they  still have the notion that ceremony, _rita_ as they call it, has a  magic potency of its own. Let us mark this well, for we shall see much  issuing from it.    [Footnote 1: Cf. e.g. RV. III. xxxii. 12.]    Who are the gods to whom these priests offer their prayers and psalms?  They are many, and of various kinds. Most of them are taken from the  religion of the people, and dressed in new garb according to the  imagination of the priest; and a few are priestly inventions  altogether. There is Dyaush-pita, the Sky-father, with Prithivi Mata,  the Earth-mother; there are Vayu the Wind-spirit, Parjanya the  Rain-god, Surya the Sun-god, and other spirits of the sky such as  Savita; there is the Dawn-goddess, Ushas. All these are or were  originally deified powers of nature: the people, though their  imagination created them, have never felt any deep interest in them,  and the priests who have taken them into their charge, though they  treat them very courteously and sing to them elegant hymns full of  figures of speech, have not been able to cover"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22886"],[0,"Cinderella in the South: Twenty-Five South African Tales (#1)"],[1,"IN THE SOUTH      New York Agents  Longmans, Green & Co.

But her youth confers  A charm on her they've lost these many years.          THE THING THAT HATH BEEN    What's the good of him?' said the bar-tender to me. 'If he could  tell us how the Ruins came he might be worth a forty-pound cheque  every month, or at least a twenty one. But he can't.'    We were discussing the new appointment of a Government Curator at  the Mabgwe Ruins. I approved it, the bar-tender did not. I  pleaded that he was a bit exacting, that the Curator had a very  cold scent to puzzle out, and that he had tried plodding about  from ruins to ruins, moling and sapping and mining, not to speak  of writing to the Rhodesian Press. Afterwards I shouldered my  knapsack, sought counsel with my carriers as to ways and means,  crossed the river and took the Ruins road. A motor-car hurtled  past me when I was within two miles. Its driver had been pointed  out to me as a Jo'burg magnate; his passengers I did not know,  but I was soon to know them. I was the first to reach the Ruins  after all; for their arrival time being one o'clock, and their  halting-place a hotel. Civilization demanded that they should  lunch there.    I drank from the fair water by the temple's western approach, and  sat down to smoke under a tree in the precincts. The big cone of  the main tower was just in sight. I had seen the walls before,  and was in no analytical mood; synthesis was enough for me. I  took in with my delighted eyes a roofless dome worthy to be a  temple of some sort, even if it were not, a blue roof that  bettered mere human aspiration, debris testifying to earthly  incompleteness, a broken column with its memento mori all these  were simmering in my vision and my judgment. I half dozed until  the voices of the lunchers began to interest me. They were doing  the rounds rather hastily, lunch having cut into their time, so  short at its very best.    A Church dignitary from our own territory was with them. He  introduced himself to me, and he also introduced an engineer. He  was a patriotic Rhodesian, that dignitary, and denounced McIver,  who had dared to assign to the Ruins a native origin.    'Such nonsense!' he said. 'Believe me, my dear sir, I know the  natives, and I know the natives never built these walls. Poor  creatures; they want firm handling, don't they? They're always in  want of bossing-up. But as for this display of art, they haven't  it in them, and they never had.'    The engineer did not seem interested in what was said, or in what  I answered. He was a man of few words. He went off to the eastern  wall, whither we followed him. I found him poking about there  with a stick. The Jo'burg charioteer was soon fussing along,  hurrying on tea-time. 'He didn't want to get a dose of fever this  trip,' he said. He had heard about our unhealthy season up north,  and the month was now April. He wanted to be back by sunset. So  it came to pass that his party went off to tea with but side-glances  at the hill-fastness.    'I'm neither a baboon nor a nigger,' said their host, when I  proposed that he should go up. After all, it was good-natured of  him to motor the dignitary out, I considered. He himself affected  no sort of interest in antiquities, and the dignified antiquarian  under his care was so wearily keen. I went to tea with them,  postponing my reveries to camping time and night. It was not  until we were eating guavas at the end of our meal that the  engineer came in. Then the Jo'burger told him to hurry up, and  went off to cherish his car. As to the engineer, his scanty  tea-time was not left in peace. The dignitary lectured him on the  true and patriotic theory of Ophir, on Astarte's worship, and  Solomon's gold. He answered very little, but he hinted that there  were difficulties. His lecturer glowed, and appealed to the  Curator, who had just come in, bent and shaken with fever.  Unhappily, yet happily for me, he trod on one of the curator's  archaeological corns and involved himself in an apology. Before  he was out of the wood I had asked the engineer a question or  two.    'No time to talk now,' he said, 'too much cackle. Come and see me  in the town. Or, if I miss you there, I may see you on the road,  mayn't I? I'm due out your way in three days.'    Soon after he was petroled away. I went to camp in a clearing, to  sup, to smoke, to read my guidebook. At last the night aged, and  the moon rose. My carriers slept. I looked up in the night's  starred face and beheld 'Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance'  there. But would I ever live to trace them by 'the magic hand of  chance,' as Keats called the grace of God? I began again to  mumble the lines of my guide-book, and found them rather bare and  dry. I looked up at the vast tapering walls. Why was there no  script there? After all, that trenchant argument outweighed a  many arguments; it scaled up like Brennus's sword, and made for a  clear issue. I looked at the sleeping carriers. Did they hold the  secret, not in tradition, not in history, but in the fleshy  tables of the heart and brain and aspiration of their race? I  went to sleep and dreamed of men building, building, building.  They were building stone kraals for their sacred trusts of kine,  chipping and carving away at their totem hawks and their  crocodiles, breaking limbs and necks over a sky-high tower, with  stones for their bricks, and no slime to make them mortar. How  they sang over their work, and how it grew! Talk of Troy's walls;  if only Kaffirs would start building a Troy, or a Palace of Art,  or a Spiritual City, how the work would go forward to the music  of them! I could hear all the parts in their melodies the  checking and countering and refrains and responses of them. But,  before I woke, the parts were merged in full chorus. With that  unison music in my ears I rose and knelt and rose again hastily.  Then I ran round to the eastern wall under the zig-zag patterns.  I came only just in time to see the sunrise by so doing.    It was three days after that I caught up Spenser, the Government  engineer.    'I have seen buildings in North Africa,' he told me. 'They  weren't much like those at Mabgwe. In the north, if they built  with stones they built with great slabs. But those granite flakes  at Mabgwe were easy for a primitive people to manage a very  primitive people. Very primitive, or why did they build on sand  when, six inches deeper, they might have founded on bed-rock?  They didn't understand arches, seemingly. They weren't very  careful about bond in building, were they? Nor were they very  careful to break joint outside, much less inside, so far as I can  judge. And the script; where is it? And the graves; where are  they? If they were Semites, why didn't they write? If they were  Semites, why didn't they bury? . . . But it isn't as easy as it  looks, the riddle. There are one or two jagged ends that conical  tower, for instance.'    We camped that evening near a Mission. I admired the oblong  iron-roofed church there. It wasn't my style of art, but it seemed  to me fair of its kind.    'Quite good,' growled my expert friend, and he said no more at  the time. He spoke more freely over a last pipe.    'I'm sorry,' he said, 'not to take more interest in this sort of  thing. Only, after all, it's African-built, and Europeans could  do the thing a bit better, couldn't they? This sort of thing  seems rather a wrong line of advance. If I hadn't seen Mabgwe so  lately I mightn't mind so much.'    They showed us to a hut, a very clean one. 'That's better; that's  ever so much better,' he said. On the wall was a rude frieze in  Bushman painting style, but white, not red. I enlightened him as  to tsenza work, as to how you could use the cool watery roots  like crayons.    'Why, that's surely Jezebel looking out of that grain-bin,' he  hazarded. 'But what are those?'    'The dogs to eat her,' I answered.    They were horrid little whelps with human heads. I told him about  certain night-fe"]]]
