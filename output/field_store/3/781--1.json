The original work contained a few phrases  or lines of Greek text. These are represented here as Beta-code  transliterations, for example [Greek: tragos]. The original text used a  few other characters not found in the Latin-1 character set. These have  been represented using bracket notation, as follows: [)a], [)e], [)s]  and [)z] represent letters with a breve (curved line) above; [=a] and  [=u] represent letters with a macron (straight line) above. In a few  places, a single superscript is shown by a caret, and two superscript  letters by carets, as in J^n 10^th^.    An important feature of this edition is its copious footnotes. Footnotes  indexed with arabic numbers (as [17], [221]) are informational. Note  text in square brackets is the work of editor E. H. Coleridge.  Unbracketed note text is from earlier editions and is by a preceding  editor or Byron himself. Footnotes indexed with letters (as [c], [bf])  document variant forms of the text from manuscripts and other sources.    In the original, footnotes are printed at the foot of the page on which  they are referenced, and their indices start over on each page. Here,  footnotes are collected at the ends of each play or poem, and are  numbered consecutively throughout. Within the blocks of footnotes are  numbers in braces: {321}. These represent the page number on which  following notes originally appeared. To find a note that was originally  printed on page 27, search for {27}.

LONDON:                        JOHN MURRAY, ALBEMARLE STREET.                      NEW YORK: CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS.                                    1901.                                 PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.    The plays and poems contained in this volume were written within the  space of two years--the last two years of Byron's career as a poet. But  that was not all. Cantos VI.-XV. of _Don Juan_, _The Vision of  Judgment_, _The Blues_, _The Irish Avatar_, and other minor poems,  belong to the same period. The end was near, and, as though he had  received a warning, he hastened to make the roll complete.    Proof is impossible, but the impression remains that the greater part of  this volume has been passed over and left unread by at least two  generations of readers. Old play-goers recall Macready as \"Werner,\" and  many persons have read _Cain_; but apart from students of literature,  readers of _Sardanapalus_ and of _The Two Foscari_ are rare; of _The Age  of Bronze_ and _The Island_ rarer still. A few of Byron's later poems  have shared the fate of Southey's epics; and, yet, with something of  Southey's persistence, Byron believed that posterity would weigh his  \"regular dramas\" in a fresh balance, and that his heedless critics  would kick the beam. But \"can these bones live\"? Can dramas which  excited the wondering admiration of Goethe and Lamartine and Sir Walter  Scott touch or lay hold of the more adventurous reader of the present  day? It is certain that even the half-forgotten works of a great and  still popular poet, which have left their mark on the creative  imagination of the poets and playwrights of three quarters of a century,  will always be studied by the few from motives of curiosity, or for  purposes of reference; but it is improbable, though not impossible, that  in the revolution of taste and sentiment, moribund or extinct poetry  will be born again into the land of the living. Poetry which has never  had its day, such as Blake's _Songs of Innocence_, the _Lyrical  Ballads_, or Fitzgerald's _Omar Khayyam_, may come, in due time, to be  recognized at its full worth; but it is a harder matter for a poem which  has lost its vogue to recapture the interest and enthusiasm of the many.    Byron is only an instance in point. Bygone poetry has little or no  attraction for modern readers. This poem or that drama may be referred  to, and occasionally examined in the interests of general culture, or in  support of a particular belief or line of conduct, as a classical or  quasi-scriptural authority; but, with the rarest exceptions, plays and  narrative poems are not read spontaneously or with any genuine  satisfaction or delight. An old-world poem which will not yield up its  secret to the idle _reader_ \"of an empty day\" is more or less \"rudely  dismissed,\" without even a show of favour or hospitality.    And yet these forgotten works of the imagination are full of hidden  treasures! There is not one of Byron's \"impressionist studies\" of  striking episodes of history or historical legend, flung, as it were,  with a \"Take it or leave it\" in the face of friend or foe, which does  not transform names and shadows into persons and substance, which does  not contain lines and passages of unquestionable beauty and distinction.    But some would have it that Byron's plays, as a whole, are dull and  uninspiring, monotonous harpings on worn-out themes, which every one has  mastered or wishes to forget. A close study of the text, together with  some knowledge of the subject as it presented itself to the author and  arrested _his_ attention, may compel these impatient critics to a  different conclusion. Byron did not scruple to refer the reader to his  \"sources,\" and was at pains to publish, in the notes and appendices to  his dramas and poems, long extracts from old chronicles, from Plutarch's  _Lives_, from French and Italian histories, which he had read himself,  and, as he fondly believed, would be read by others, who were willing to  submit themselves to his guidance. He expected his readers to take some  trouble and to display some intelligence.    Poetry is successful only so far as it is intelligible. To a clear cry  an answer comes, but not to a muffled call. The reader who comes within  speaking distance of his author can hear him, and to bring the living  within speaking distance of the dead, the living must know the facts,  and understand the ideas which informed and inspired the dead. Thought  and attention are scarcely to be reckoned among necromantic arts, but  thought and knowledge \"can make these bones live,\" and stand upon their  feet, if they do not leap and sing.    I desire to renew my acknowledgments of the generous assistance of the  officials of the British Museum, and, more especially, of Mr. Ernest  Wallis Budge, Litt.D., M.A., _Keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian  Antiquities_; of Mr. Leonard W. King, M.A., of the same department; and  of Mr. George F. Barwick, _Superintendent of the Reading Room_.    To Dr. Garnett, C.B., I am greatly indebted for invaluable hints and  suggestions with regard to the interpretation of some obscure passages  in _The Age of Bronze_ and other parts of the volume, and for reading  the proofs of the \"Introduction\" and \"Note to the Introduction to  _Werner_.\"    I have also to acknowledge the assistance and advice of Mr. W. Hale  White, and of my friend Mr. Frank E. Taylor, of Chertsey.    For assistance during the preparation of the volume, and more especially  in the revision of proofs, I desire to express my cordial thanks to Mr.  John Murray.

Introduction to _The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2348"],[0,"The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax (#1)"],[1,"Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax      By    Sir Arthur Conan Doyle          \"But why Turkish?\" asked Mr. Sherlock Holmes, gazing fixedly at my  boots.  I was reclining in a cane-backed chair at the moment, and my  protruded feet had attracted his ever-active attention.    \"English,\" I answered in some surprise.  \"I got them at Latimer's, in  Oxford Street.\"    Holmes smiled with an expression of weary patience.    \"The bath!\" he said; \"the bath!  Why the relaxing and expensive Turkish  rather than the invigorating home-made article?\"    \"Because for the last few days I have been feeling rheumatic and old. A  Turkish bath is what we call an alterative in medicine--a fresh  starting-point, a cleanser of the system.    \"By the way, Holmes,\" I added, \"I have no doubt the connection between  my boots and a Turkish bath is a perfectly self-evident one to a  logical mind, and yet I should be obliged to you if you would indicate  it.\"    \"The train of reasoning is not very obscure, Watson,\" said Holmes with  a mischievous twinkle.  \"It belongs to the same elementary class of  deduction which I should illustrate if I were to ask you who shared  your cab in your drive this morning.\"    \"I don't admit that a fresh illustration is an explanation,\" said I  with some asperity.    \"Bravo, Watson!  A very dignified and logical remonstrance.  Let me  see, what were the points?  Take the last one first--the cab. You  observe that you have some splashes on the left sleeve and shoulder of  your coat.  Had you sat in the centre of a hansom you would probably  have had no splashes, and if you had they would certainly have been  symmetrical.  Therefore it is clear that you sat at the side.  Therefore it is equally clear that you had a companion.\"    \"That is very evident.\"    \"Absurdly commonplace, is it not?\"    \"But the boots and the bath?\"    \"Equally childish.  You are in the habit of doing up your boots in a  certain way.  I see them on this occasion fastened with an elaborate  double bow, which is not your usual method of tying them.  You have,  therefore, had them off.  Who has tied them?  A bootmaker--or the boy  at the bath.  It is unlikely that it is the bootmaker, since your boots  are nearly new.  Well, what remains? The bath.  Absurd, is it not?  But, for all that, the Turkish bath has served a purpose.\"    \"What is that?\"    \"You say that you have had it because you need a change.  Let me  suggest that you take one.  How would Lausanne do, my dear  Watson--first-class tickets and all expenses paid on a princely scale?\"    \"Splendid!  But why?\"    Holmes leaned back in his armchair and took his notebook from his  pocket.    \"One of the most dangerous classes in the world,\" said he, \"is the  drifting and friendless woman.  She is the most harmless and often the  most useful of mortals, but she is the inevitable inciter of crime in  others.  She is helpless.  She is migratory. She has sufficient means  to take her from country to country and from hotel to hotel.  She is  lost, as often as not, in a maze of obscure pensions and  boardinghouses.  She is a stray chicken in a world of foxes.  When she  is gobbled up she is hardly missed. I much fear that some evil has come  to the Lady Frances Carfax.\"    I was relieved at this sudden descent from the general to the  particular.  Holmes consulted his notes.    \"Lady Frances,\" he continued, \"is the sole survivor of the direct  family of the late Earl of Rufton.  The estates went, as you may  remember, in the male line.  She was left with limited means, but with  some very remarkable old Spanish jewellery of silver and curiously cut  diamonds to which she was fondly attached--too attached, for she  refused to leave them with her banker and always carried them about  with her.  A rather pathetic figure, the Lady Frances, a beautiful  woman, still in fresh middle age, and yet, by a strange change, the  last derelict of what only twenty years ago was a goodly fleet.\"    \"What has happened to her, then?\"    \"Ah, what has happened to the Lady Frances?  Is she alive or dead?  There is our problem.  She is a lady of precise habits, and for four  years it has been her invariable custom to write every second week to  Miss Dobney, her old governess, who has long retired and lives in  Camberwell. It is this Miss Dobney who has consulted me.  Nearly five  weeks have passed without a word.  The last letter was from the Hotel  National at Lausanne. Lady Frances seems to have left there and given  no address.  The family are anxious, and as they are exceedingly  wealthy no sum will be spared if we can clear the matter up.\"    \"Is Miss Dobney the only source of information?  Surely she had other  correspondents?\"    \"There is one correspondent who is a sure draw, Watson.  That is the  bank.  Single ladies must live, and their passbooks are compressed  diaries.  She banks at Silvester's.  I have glanced over her account.  The last check but one paid her bill at Lausanne, but it was a large  one and probably left her with cash in hand.  Only one check has been  drawn since.\"    \"To whom, and where?\"    \"To Miss Marie Devine.  There is nothing to show where the check was  drawn.  It was cashed at the Credit Lyonnais at Montpellier less than  three weeks ago.  The sum was fifty pounds.\"    \"And who is Miss Marie Devine?\"    \"That also I have been able to discover.  Miss Marie Devine was the  maid of Lady Frances Carfax.  Why she should have paid her this check  we have not yet determined. I have no doubt, however, that your  researches will soon clear the matter up.\"    \"MY researches!\"    \"Hence the health-giving expedition to Lausanne.  You know that I  cannot possibly leave London while old Abrahams is in such mortal  terror of his life.  Besides, on general principles it is best that I  should not leave the country.  Scotland Yard feels lonely without me,  and it causes an unhealthy excitement among the criminal classes.  Go,  then, my dear Watson, and if my humble counsel can ever be valued at so  extravagant a rate as two pence a word, it waits your disposal night  and day at the end of the Continental wire.\"    Two days later found me at the Hotel National at Lausanne, where I  received every courtesy at the hands of M. Moser, the well-known  manager.  Lady Frances, as he informed me, had stayed there for several  weeks.  She had been much liked by all who met her. Her age was not  more than forty.  She was still handsome and bore every sign of having  in her youth been a very lovely woman.  M. Moser knew nothing of any  valuable jewellery, but it had been remarked by the servants that the  heavy trunk in the lady's bedroom was always scrupulously locked.  Marie Devine, the maid, was as popular as her mistress.  She was  actually engaged to one of the head waiters in the hotel, and there was  no difficulty in getting her address.  It was 11 Rue de Trajan,  Montpellier.  All this I jotted down and felt that Holmes himself could  not have been more adroit in collecting his facts.    Only one corner still remained in the shadow.  No light which I  possessed could clear up the cause for the lady's sudden departure.  She was very happy at Lausanne.  There was every reason to believe that  she intended to remain for the season in her luxurious rooms  overlooking the lake.  And yet she had left at a single day's notice,  which involved her in the useless payment of a week's rent.  Only Jules  Vibart, the lover of the maid, had any suggestion to offer.  He  connected the sudden departure with the visit to the hotel a day or two  before of a tall, dark, bearded man.  \"Un sauvage--un veritable  sauvage!\" cried Jules Vibart.  The man had rooms somewhere in the town.  He had been seen talking earnestly to Madame on the promenade by the  lake.  Then he had called.  She had refused to see him.  He was  English, but of his name there was no record.  Madame had left the  place immediately afterwards.  Jules Vibart, and, what was of more  importance, Jules Vibart's sweetheart, thought that this call and the  departure were cause and effect.  Only one thing Jules would not  discuss.  That was the reason why Marie had left her mistress.  Of that  he could or would say nothing.  If I wished to know, I must go to  Montpellier and ask her.    So ended the first chapter of my inquiry.  The second was devoted to  the place which Lady Frances Carfax had sought when she left Lausanne.  Concerning this there had been some secrecy, which confirmed the idea  that she had gone with the intention of throwing someone off her track.  Otherwise why should not her luggage have been openly labelled for  Baden?  Both she and it reached the Rhenish spa by some circuitous  route.  This much I gathered from the manager of Cook's local office.  So to Baden I went, after dispatching to Holmes an account of all my  proceedings and receiving in reply a telegram of half-humorous  commendation.    At Baden the track was not difficult to follow.  Lady Frances had  stayed at the Englischer Hof for a fortnight.  While there she had made  the acquaintance of a Dr. Shlessinger and his wife, a missionary from  South America.  Like most lonely ladies, Lady Frances found her comfort  and occupation in religion.  Dr. Shlessinger's remarkable personality,  his whole hearted devotion, and the fact that he was recovering from a  disease contracted in the exercise of his apostolic duties affected her  deeply.  She had helped Mrs. Shlessinger in the nursing of the  convalescent saint.  He spent his day, as the manager described it to  me, upon a lounge-chair on the veranda, with an attendant lady upon  either side of him.  He was preparing a map of the Holy Land, with  special reference to the kingdom of the Midianites, upon which he was  writing a monograph.  Finally, having improved much in health, he and  his wife had returned to London, and Lady Frances had started thither  in their company.  This was just three weeks before, and the"]]]
