Carleton & Co., Publishers.  M DCCC LXVIII.             *       *       *       *       *      PREFACE      I have often been asked to write my life, as those who know me know that  it has been an eventful one. At last I have acceded to the importunities  of my friends, and have hastily sketched some of the striking incidents  that go to make up my history. My life, so full of romance, may sound  like a dream to the matter-of-fact reader, nevertheless everything I  have written is strictly true; much has been omitted, but nothing has  been exaggerated. In writing as I have done, I am well aware that I have  invited criticism; but before the critic judges harshly, let my  explanation be carefully read and weighed. If I have portrayed the dark  side of slavery, I also have painted the bright side. The good that I  have said of human servitude should be thrown into the scales with the  evil that I have said of it. I have kind, true-hearted friends in the  South as well as in the North, and I would not wound those Southern  friends by sweeping condemnation, simply because I was once a slave.  They were not so much responsible for the curse under which I was born,  as the God of nature and the fathers who framed the Constitution for the  United States. The law descended to them, and it was but natural that  they should recognize it, since it manifestly was their interest to do  so. And yet a wrong was inflicted upon me; a cruel custom deprived me of  my liberty, and since I was robbed of my dearest right, I would not have  been human had I not rebelled against the robbery. God rules the  Universe. I was a feeble instrument in His hands, and through me and the  enslaved millions of my race, one of the problems was solved that  belongs to the great problem of human destiny; and the solution was  developed so gradually that there was no great convulsion of the  harmonies of natural laws. A solemn truth was thrown to the surface, and  what is better still, it was recognized as a truth by those who give  force to moral laws. An act may be wrong, but unless the ruling power  recognizes the wrong, it is useless to hope for a correction of it.  Principles may be right, but they are not established within an hour.  The masses are slow to reason, and each principle, to acquire moral  force, must come to us from the fire of the crucible; the fire may  inflict unjust punishment, but then it purifies and renders stronger the  principle, not in itself, but in the eyes of those who arrogate judgment  to themselves. When the war of the Revolution established the  independence of the American colonies, an evil was perpetuated, slavery  was more firmly established; and since the evil had been planted, it  must pass through certain stages before it could be eradicated. In fact,  we give but little thought to the plant of evil until it grows to such  monstrous proportions that it overshadows important interests; then the  efforts to destroy it become earnest. As one of the victims of slavery I  drank of the bitter water; but then, since destiny willed it so, and  since I aided in bringing a solemn truth to the surface _as a truth_,  perhaps I have no right to complain. Here, as in all things pertaining  to life, I can afford to be charitable.    It may be charged that I have written too freely on some questions,  especially in regard to Mrs. Lincoln. I do not think so; at least I have  been prompted by the purest motive. Mrs. Lincoln, by her own acts,  forced herself into notoriety. She stepped beyond the formal lines which  hedge about a private life, and invited public criticism. The people  have judged her harshly, and no woman was ever more traduced in the  public prints of the country. The people knew nothing of the secret  history of her transactions, therefore they judged her by what was  thrown to the surface. For an act may be wrong judged purely by itself,  but when the motive that prompted the act is understood, it is construed  differently. I lay it down as an axiom, that only that is criminal in  the sight of God where crime is meditated. Mrs. Lincoln may have been  imprudent, but since her intentions were good, she should be judged more  kindly than she has been. But the world do not know what her intentions  were; they have only been made acquainted with her acts without knowing  what feeling guided her actions. If the world are to judge her as I have  judged her, they must be introduced to the secret history of her  transactions. The veil of mystery must be drawn aside; the origin of a  fact must be brought to light with the naked fact itself. If I have  betrayed confidence in anything I have published, it has been to place  Mrs. Lincoln in a better light before the world. A breach of trust--if  breach it can be called--of this kind is always excusable. My own  character, as well as the character of Mrs. Lincoln, is at stake, since  I have been intimately associated with that lady in the most eventful  periods of her life. I have been her confidante, and if evil charges are  laid at her door, they also must be laid at mine, since I have been a  party to all her movements. To defend myself I must defend the lady that  I have served. The world have judged Mrs. Lincoln by the facts which  float upon the surface, and through her have partially judged me, and  the only way to convince them that wrong was not meditated is to explain  the motives that actuated us. I have written nothing that can place Mrs.  Lincoln in a worse light before the world than the light in which she  now stands, therefore the secret history that I publish can do her no  harm. I have excluded everything of a personal character from her  letters; the extracts introduced only refer to public men, and are such  as to throw light upon her unfortunate adventure in New York. These  letters were not written for publication, for which reason they are all  the more valuable; they are the frank overflowings of the heart, the  outcropping of impulse, the key to genuine motives. They prove the  motive to have been pure, and if they shall help to stifle the voice of  calumny, I am content. I do not forget, before the public journals  vilified Mrs. Lincoln, that ladies who moved in the Washington circle in  which she moved, freely canvassed her character among themselves. They  gloated over many a tale of scandal that grew out of gossip in their own  circle. If these ladies, could say everything bad of the wife of the  President, why should I not be permitted to lay her secret history bare,  especially when that history plainly shows that her life, like all  lives, has its good side as well as its bad side! None of us are  perfect, for which reason we should heed the voice of charity when it  whispers in our ears, \"Do not magnify the imperfections of others.\" Had  Mrs. Lincoln's acts never become public property, I should not have  published to the world the secret chapters of her life. I am not the  special champion of the widow of our lamented President; the reader of  the pages which follow will discover that I have written with the utmost  frankness in regard to her--have exposed her faults as well as given her  credit for honest motives. I wish the world to judge her as she is, free  from the exaggerations of praise or scandal, since I have been  associated with her in so many things that have provoked hostile  criticism; and the judgment that the world may pass upon her, I flatter  myself, will present my own actions in a better light.        ELIZABETH KECKLEY.      14 Carroll Place, New York,      March 14, 1868.          CHAPTER I    WHERE I WAS BORN      My life has been an eventful one. I was born a slave--was the child of  slave parents--therefore I came upon the earth free in God-like thought,  but fettered in action. My birthplace was Dinwiddie Court-House, in  Virginia. My recollections of childhood are distinct, perhaps for the  reason that many stirring incidents are associated with that period. I  am now on the shady side of forty, and as I sit alone in my room the  brain is busy, and a rapidly moving"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24989"],[0,"A Short Method Of Prayer (#1)"],[1,"was produced from scanned images of public domain  material from the Google Print project.)                      +--------------------------------------------------------------+    |                                                              |    | Transcriber's note:                                          |    |                                                              |    | This eBook contains the front matter from a combined edition |    | of _A Short Method of Prayer_ and _Spiritual Torrents_, but  |    | only contains the text of _A Short Method of Prayer_.        |    |                                                              |    +--------------------------------------------------------------+          A SHORT METHOD OF PRAYER    and    SPIRITUAL TORRENTS.    BY  J. M. B. DE LA MOTHE GUYON.      Translated from the Paris Edition of 1790  BY  A. W. MARSTON.      LONDON:  SAMPSON LOW, MARSTON, LOW, & SEARLE,  CROWN BUILDINGS, 188 FLEET STREET.  1875.    [_All rights reserved._]          PRINTED BY BALLANTYNE AND COMPANY  EDINBURGH AND LONDON          _PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH PROTESTANT EDITION._      Some apology is perhaps needed when a Protestant thus brings before  Protestant readers the works of a consistent Roman Catholic author. The  plea must be, that the doctrine and experience described are essentially  Protestant; and so far from their receiving the assent of the Roman  Catholic Church, their author was persecuted for holding and  disseminating them.    Of the experience of Madame Guyon, it should be borne in mind, that  though the glorious heights of communion with God to which she attained  may be scaled by the feeblest of God's chosen ones, yet it is by no  means necessary that they should be reached by the same apparently  arduous and protracted path along which she was led.    The \"Torrents\" especially needs to be regarded rather as an account of  the personal experience of the author, than as the plan which God  invariably, or even usually, adopts in bringing the soul into a state of  union with Himself. It is true that, in order that we may \"live unto  righteousness,\" we must be \"dead indeed unto sin;\" and that there must  be a crucifixion of self before the life of Christ can be made manifest  in us. It is only when we can say, \"I am crucified with Christ,\" that we  are able to add, \"Nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in  me.\" But it does not follow that this inward death must always be as  lingering as in the case of Madame Guyon. She tells us herself that the  reason was, that she was not wholly resigned to the Divine will, and  willing to be deprived of the gifts of God, that she might enjoy the  possession of the Giver. This resistance to the will of God implies  suffering on the part of the creature, and chastisement on the part of  God, in order that He may subdue to Himself what is not voluntarily  yielded to Him.    Of the joy of a complete surrender to God, it is not necessary to speak  here: thousands of God's children are realising its blessedness for  themselves, and proving that it is no hardship, but a joy unspeakable,  to present themselves a living sacrifice to God, to live no longer to  themselves, but to Him that died for them, and rose again.    A simple trust in a living, personal Saviour; a putting away by His  grace of all that is known to be in opposition to His will; and an  entire self-abandonment to Him, that His designs may be worked out in  and through us; such is the simple key to the hidden sanctuary of  communion.          _A SHORT METHOD OF PRAYER._    CONTENTS.

It was prepared for the help of a few Christians who were  desirous of loving God with the whole heart. But so many have requested  copies of it, because of the benefit they have derived from its perusal,  that I have been asked to publish it.    I have left it in its natural simplicity. I do not condemn the opinions  of any: on the contrary, I esteem those which are held by others, and  submit all that I have written to the censure of persons of experience  and learning. I only ask of all that they will not be content with  examining the outside, but that they will penetrate the design of the  writer, which is only to lead others to LOVE GOD, and to serve Him with  greater happiness and success, by enabling them to do it in a simple and  easy way, fit for the little ones who are not capable of extraordinary  things, but who truly desire to _give themselves to God_.    I ask all who may read it, to read without prejudice; and they will  discover, under common expressions, a hidden unction, which will lead  them to seek for a happiness which all ought to expect to possess.    I use the word _facility_, saying that perfection is easy, because it is  easy to find God, _when we seek Him within ourselves_. The passage may  be quoted which says, \"Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me\" (John  vii. 34). Yet this need not occasion any difficulty; because the same  God, who cannot contradict Himself, has said, \"He that seeketh findeth\"  (Matt. vii. 8). _He who seeks God, and who yet is unwilling to forsake  sin, will not find Him, because he is seeking Him where He cannot be  found_; therefore it is added, \"Ye shall die in your sins.\" _But he who  sincerely desires to forsake sin, that he may draw near to God, will  find Him infallibly_.    Many people imagine religion so frightful, and prayer so extraordinary,  that they are not willing to strive after them, never expecting to  attain to them. But as the difficulty which we see in a thing causes us  to despair of succeeding in it, and at the same time removes the desire  to undertake it; and as, when a thing appears both desirable and easy to  be attained, we give ourselves to it with pleasure, and pursue it  boldly; I have been constrained to set forth the advantage and the  _facility_ of this way.    Oh! if we were persuaded of the goodness of God toward His poor  creatures, and of the desire which He has to communicate Himself to  them, we should not imagine so many obstacles, and despair so easily of  obtaining a good which He is so infinitely desirous of imparting to us.    And if He has not spared His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all,  is there anything He can refuse us? Assuredly not. We only need a little  courage and perseverance. We have so much of both for trifling temporal  interests, and we have none for the \"_one thing needful_.\"    As for "]]]
