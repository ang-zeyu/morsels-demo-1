They decide to leave dear old England for a  while, and pay a visit to Africa.  Here all sorts of adventures befall  them, some pleasurable, but many of them not so.  There is one  particularly awkward moment when one of the boys is pounced on by a  lion.  However, they get out of that one.  As always with Fenn's books,  there are numerous tight situations, many of which appear to have no  solution, but they do get out of them, perhaps with the loss of one of  their bullocks.    But by the end of the tale they are only too happy to get back to  England and home.    ________________________________________________________________________  DEAD MAN'S LAND, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.        CHAPTER ONE.    JUST BEFORE DINNER.    Mark jumped up.    \"You there, father!  I did not hear you come in.\"    Doctor Robertson, tutor, half rose from his seat by the glowing library  fire.    \"No, my boy, and I did not hear you come in.\"    \"Why, uncle, you have been sitting there listening!\" cried Dean.    \"To be sure I have.  How could I help it, sir?  I came in tired, and  thought I would have a nap in my own chair till it was time to change  for dinner, and you woke me up out of a pleasant dream which somehow  shaped itself into climbing with an ice axe and nearly losing it.  It  was some time before I could make out whether I was really awake or  dreaming still, and I lay listening and getting more and more interested  in what the doctor described to you two stupid boys.\"    \"Oh, father, you shouldn't have listened!\" said Mark.    \"What, sir!\" cried Sir James Roche hotly.  \"And pray why shouldn't I  have listened?\"    \"Because--because--\"    \"Because--because!  Well, go on, sir.\"    \"Well, Dr Robertson said something to us boys one day about what he  called eavesdropping.\"    \"Tut, tut, sir!\" cried the boy's father irascibly.  \"You dare to tell me  I was eavesdropping, when you three come in from your walk, and plump  yourselves down at the end of the room and go on talking till you wake  me up?  How could I help being interested and sitting back listening to  the doctor's travels?  Don't I pay him to teach you boys a lot of his  knowledge, and if by accident I hear some of what he says, haven't I a  right to it?\"    \"And you have heard all I have said, sir?\" said the doctor, speaking as  if he were moved.    \"Yes, my dear sir, everything when once I was well awake, and very fine  it was.  Why, Mark--Dean--didn't I suggest that I should like to hear  some more?\"    \"Yes, uncle, you did,\" said Dean; \"but--\"    \"What, sir?  Are you siding with Mark, and going to accuse your uncle of  being an eavesdropper?\"    \"No, uncle, but--\"    \"Hang your buts, you impudent young dog!  But--but--\"    \"You said hang buts, uncle.\"    \"Bah!  Pooh!  Well, really, doctor, I suppose I ought to have spoken  when I woke up, and put you all on your guard in case you might have--  Here, what does the old proverb say?  `Listeners never hear any good of  themselves.'  Of course you might have said--you, Mark, boy, I mean--  said that I was a stingy old fellow and didn't allow you enough pocket  money.\"    \"Well, I don't think you do, father,\" cried Mark; \"but I shouldn't have  said so.\"    \"Good boy!  But I do allow you, sir, twice as much as my father used to  allow me when I was your age.  And then Dean might have followed it up  by talking about my temper.\"    \"I shouldn't, uncle.\"    \"Ah, I don't know, sir.  I am what Mrs Blinks calls a bit trying when  my gout's bad.  And then I might have heard the doctor say--oh, no, he  would say nothing but what would come from a gentleman.\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" said the doctor, as he stood erect now, and his words  were followed by a low sigh as if of satisfaction.    \"Yes, I ought to have spoken, boys,\" continued the baronet, \"but you  mustn't set it down as being dishonourable.  Why, you ought to have  heard me chuckling softly as I lay back there in the darkness,  listening.  Why, Robertson, this isn't flattery; you have a most  astounding memory, and I must compliment you upon the way in which you  retain things and then give them out again so that they seem to be  life-like and real.  And so you have always had a great desire to be a  traveller?\"    \"Always, sir,\" said the doctor gravely.    \"Hah!  And fate has so arranged it that you were to be a student  instead, and doomed you to pass your existence drumming learning into  the brains of a couple of the stupidest, wooden-headed boys I know.\"    \"Oh, I say, dad, only one!  I am sharp enough; you said so yourself; and  poor old Dozey can't help being such a sleepy-headed fellow.\"    \"Eh?  What's that?\" cried Sir James.  \"You will show him whether you are  sleepy-headed when you get up into your room!\"    \"Then he shouldn't say such things, uncle.\"    \"Ha, ha!\" laughed Sir James.  \"But really, my dear Robertson, you have  taken me quite by surprise.  You would like to travel?\"    \"I must confess I should, Sir James; but pray don't give me the credit  of being discontented with my lot.  The three years that I have passed  at the manor, gladdened as they have been by your consideration and  perfect trust, have been happy ones to me.\"    \"Oh, tut, nonsense, my dear sir!  When you came here I laid down the law  to myself that for the first month I would lie low, as the Yankees call  it, and see what sort of a fellow you were; and at the end of that time  I was perfectly satisfied with my good fortune in obtaining your  services.  I said to myself, `The doctor's a high-class University man,  and he can turn those two boys into English gentlemen--manly gentlemen--  far better than I can.  He will have a terribly hard job to lick the  young cubs and shape them properly, so don't interfere.'  And I haven't,  have I, doctor?  No--no, don't say anything.  I know what it would be,  so hold your tongue.  I will say, though, here in the darkness so as to  spare the boys, doctor, that I think it's a pity that besides the  metaphorical licking that the old bears are said to use to shape their  cubs, I did not begin by giving you the power to give them now and then  what schoolboys call `the real' licking.\"    \"You don't, father,\" said Mark, laughing merrily.  \"You have always said  that boys can be well brought up without blows.\"    \"Hear, hear,\" said the doctor softly.    \"But I am afraid it was very weak of me,\" said Sir James.  \"A good  thrashing, sir, now and then, would have made you less impudent.\"    \"You mean Dean, father,\" said the boy mischievously.    \"No, I do not, sir.\"    \"Hear, hear!  Hooray!\" shouted Dean.    \"But I believe,\" continued Sir James, \"that it would have woke him up a  bit, for he's nearly as bad as the Fat Boy in Pickwick.\"    \"Oh, what a shame!\" cried the boy.    \"And one word more,\" continued Sir James, speaking earnestly now.  \"Do  you know, Robertson, this is very odd?\"    \"What is, sir?\" said the doctor, for Sir James had ceased speaking.    \"Why, that several times lately I have sat there in that chair thinking  about these two fellows and their education, and that though I don't  believe in what people call the Grand Tour, it would be a fine thing for  them if they were to travel and see a bit of the world.  I mean real  travelling, into out-of-the-way places where they could shoot, and hunt,  and fish, and collect.  I don't mean to go murdering about, seeing how  many poor animals they could slaughter, and calling it sport, but to go  out into the wilds getting their livings by their guns or rifles, and  learning at the same time the wonders of animated nature, and seeing  generally what there is to be found in life.  Of course I know that you  could impart all this to the boys by means of books of travel, but how  would it be if you were to pick out some interesting country and teach  them by genuine travel?  Much better than nailing you down to a table  with a pile of books.  Why, doctor--boys--Bah!  Bless my heart!  There's  the dinner-bell!  No dressing to-day.  Come along.  We must talk more of  this another time.\"        CHAPTER TWO.    HOW MARK ROCHE GAINED THE DAY.    The idea of travelling was not allowed to cool.  A few days passed,  during which the project was discussed, and one morning during breakfast  the baronet broke out with, \"I don't want to get rid of you boys, but I  lie awake of a night now, thinking of you going on such an expedition  with the doctor, then growl and grumble at myself with envy.\"    \"Then you really mean us to go, father?\"    \"Mean it, yes.  But it comes hard that you two should have father and  uncle who is ready to lay down the money--the bank notes to pay for it  all, and here am I going to be left at home longing for letters that can  only possibly come at very long intervals.\"    \"Oh, father, but we shall write regularly,\" cried Mark.    \"Of course!\" said Sir James sarcastically.  \"Sit down at the end of a  day's tramp, when you are tired out, at a comfortable library table,  with a light of a shaded lamp, and write me a good long letter?  Rubbish, sir!  You will neither of you be in the humour for writing  right away there in some forest.\"    \"Oh, of course, uncle,\" cried Dean, \"we shan't have a chance to sit down  at a table to write, but we shall take each of us a writing case.\"    \"Humph!  Will you?  I doubt it, boy; and even if you did you wouldn't be  able to get at it when you were in the humour to write; and then if you  did scrawl something with a pencil on a scrap of paper, where would you  post your letter?  In some hollow tree, or tuck it in a bladder and send  it floating down a river with a direction scratched on a tin label?  Bah!  The doctor will take you right away into some wilds, and I shall  get no letter for months, and months, and months.\"    \"Oh,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2393"],[0,"His Dog (#1)"],[1,"DOG      by    ALBERT PAYSON TERHUNE      1922          CONTENTS        I.  The Derelict     II.  The Battle    III.  The Ordeal     IV.  The Choice          CHAPTER I.    The Derelict    Link Ferris was a fighter. Not by nature, nor by choice, but to keep  alive.    His battleground covered an area of forty acres--broken, scrubby,  uncertain side-hill acres, at that. In brief, a worked-out farm among  the mountain slopes of the North Jersey hinterland; six miles from the  nearest railroad.    The farm was Ferris's, by right of sole heritage from his father, a  Civil-War veteran, who had taken up the wilderness land in 1865 and  who, for thirty years thereafter, had wrought to make it pay. At best  the elder Ferris had wrenched only a meager living from the light and  rock-infested soil.    The first-growth timber on the west woodlot for some time had staved  off the need of a mortgage; its veteran oaks and hickories grimly  giving up their lives, in hundreds, to keep the wolf from the door of  their owner. When the last of the salable timber was gone Old Man  Ferris tried his hand at truck farming, and sold his wares from a wagon  to the denizens of Craigswold, the new colony of rich folk, four miles  to northward.    But to raise such vegetables and fruits as would tempt the eyes and the  purses of Craigswold people it was necessary to have more than mere  zeal and industry. Sour ground will not readily yield sweet abundance,  be the toiler ever so industrious. Moreover, there was large and  growing competition, in the form of other huckster routes.    And presently the old veteran wearied of the eternal uphill struggle.  He mortgaged the farm, dying soon afterward. And Link, his son, was  left to carry on the thankless task.    Link Ferris was as much a part of the Ferris farm as was the giant  bowlder in the south mowing. He had been born in the paintless shack  which his father had built with his own rheumatic hands. He had worked  for more than a quarter century, in and out of the hill fields and the  ramshackle barns. From babyhood he had toiled there. Scant had been the  chances for schooling, and more scant had been the opportunities for  outside influence.    Wherefore, Link had grown to a wirily weedy and slouching manhood,  almost as ignorant of the world beyond his mountain walls as were any  of his own \"critters.\" His life was bounded by fruitless labor, varied  only by such sleep and food as might fit him to labor the harder.    He ate and slept, that he might be able to work. And he worked, that he  might be able to eat and sleep. Beyond that, his life was as barren as  a rainy sea.    If he dreamed of other and wider things, the workaday grind speedily  set such dreams to rout. When the gnawing of lonely unrest was too  acute for bovine endurance--and when he could spare the time or the  money--he was wont to go to the mile-off hamlet of Hampton and there  get as nearly drunk as his funds would permit.    It was his only surcease. And as a rule, it was a poor one. For seldom  did he have enough ready money to buy wholesale forgetfulness. More  often he was able to purchase only enough hard cider or fuseloil whisky  to make him dull and vaguely miserable.    It was on his way home one Saturday night from such a rudimentary  debauch at Hampton that his Adventure had its small beginning.    For a half mile or so of Link's homeward pilgrimage--before he turned  off into the grass-grown, rutted hill trail which led to his farm--his  way led along a spur of the state road which linked New York City with  the Ramapo hill country.    And here, as Link swung glumly along through the springtide dusk, his  ears were assailed by a sound that was something between a sigh and a  sob--a sound as of one who tries valiantly to stifle a whimper of sharp  pain.    Ferris halted, uncertain, at the road edge; and peered about him. Again  he heard the sound. And this time he located it in the long grass of  the wayside ditch. The grass was stirring spasmodically, too, as with  the half-restrained writhings of something lying close to earth there.    Link struck a match. Shielding the flame, he pushed the tangle of grass  to one side with his foot.    There, exposed in the narrow space thus cleared and by the narrower  radius of match flare, crouched a dog.    The brute was huddled in a crumpled heap, with one foreleg stuck  awkwardly out in front of him at an impossible angle. His tawny mass of  coat was mired and oil streaked. In his deep-set brown eyes burned the  fires of agony.    Yet, as he looked up at the man who bent above him, the dog's gaze was  neither fierce nor cringing. It held rather such an expression as,  Dumas tells us, the wounded Athos turned to D'Artagnan--the aspect of  one in sore need of aid, and too proud to plead for it.    Link Ferris had never heard of Dumas, nor of the immortal musketeer.  None the less, he could read that look. And it appealed to him, as no  howl of anguish could have appealed. He knelt beside the suffering dog  and fell to examining his hurts.    The dog was a collie--beautiful of head, sweepingly graceful of line,  powerful and heavy coated. The mud on his expanse of snowy chest frill  and the grease on his dark brown back were easy to account for, even to  Link Ferris's none-too-keen imagination.    Link, in his own occasional trudges along this bit of state road, had  often seen costly dogs in the tonneaus of passing cars. He had seen  several of them scramble frantically to maintain their footing on the  slippery seats of such cars; when chauffeurs took the sharp curve, just  ahead, at too high speed. He had even seen one Airedale flung bodily  from a car's rear seat at that curve, and out into the roadway; where a  close-following motor had run over and killed it.    This collie, doubtless, had had such a fall; and, unseen by the front  seat's occupants, had struck ground with terrific force--a force that  had sent him whirling through mud and grease into the ditch, with a  broken front leg.    How long the beast had lain there Link had no way of guessing. But the  dog was in mortal agony. And the kindest thing to do was to put him out  of his pain.    Ferris groped around through the gloom until, in the ditch, his fingers  closed over a ten-pound stone. One smashing blow on the head, with this  missile, would bring a swift and merciful end to the sufferer's  troubles.    Poising the stone aloft, Link turned back to where the dog lay.  Standing over the victim, he balanced the rock and tensed his muscles  for the blow. The match had long since gone out, but Link's  dusk-accustomed vision could readily discern the outlines of the  collie. And he made ready to strike.    Then--perhaps it was the drink playing tricks with Ferris's mind--it  seemed to him that he could still see those deep-set dark eyes staring  up at him through the murk, with that same fearless and yet piteous  look in their depths. It was a look that the brief sputter of  match-light had photographed on Link's brain.    \"I--I ain't got the heart to swat you while you keep lookin' that way  at me,\" he muttered half-aloud, as if to a human companion. \"Jes' you  turn your head the other way, pup! It'll be over quick, an' easy.\"    By the faint light Link could see the dog had not obeyed the order to  turn his head.  But at the man's tone of compassion the great plumy  tail began to thump the ground in feeble response.    \"H'm!\" grunted Link, letting the stone drop to the road, \"got nerve,  too, ain't you, friend? 'Tain't every cuss that can wag his tail when  his leg's bust.\"    Kneeling down again he examined the broken foreleg more carefully.  Gentle as was his touch, yet Link knew it must cause infinite torture.  But the dog did not flinch. He seemed to understand that Ferris meant  kindly, for he moved his magnificent head far enough to lick the man's  hand softly and in gratitude.    The caress had an odd effect on the loveless Ferris. It was the first  voluntary mark of affection he had encountered for longer than he liked  to remember. It set old memories to working.    The Ferris farm, since Link's birth, had been perhaps the only home in  all that wild region which did not boast a dog of some kind. Link's  father had had an inborn hatred of dogs. He would not allow one on the  place. His overt excuse was that they killed sheep and worried cattle,  and that he could not afford to risk the well-being of his scanty hoard  of stock.    Thus, Link had grown to manhood with no dog at his heels, and without  knowing the normal human's love for canine chumship.    The primal instinct, long buried, stirred within him now; at touch of  the warm tongue on his calloused hand and at sound of that friendly  tail wagging in the dry grass. Ashamed of the stirrings in him, he  sought to explain them by reminding himself that this was probably a  valuable animal and that a reward might be offered for his return. In  which case Link Ferris might as well profit by the cash windfall as  anyone else.    Taking off his coat, Ferris spread it on the ground. Then, lifting the  stricken collie as gently as he could, he deposited him on the coat and  rolled its frayed edges about him. After which he picked up the swathed  invalid and bore him home.    During the mile trudge the collie's sixty pounds grew unbearably heavy,  to the half-drunk Ferris. More than once he was minded to set down his  burden and leave the brute to his fate.    But always the tardy realization that the journey was more painful to  the dog than to himself gave Link a fresh grip on his determination.  And at last,--a long and tiring last,--they reached the tumble-down  farmhouse where Link Ferris kept bachelor's hall.    Laying his patient on the kitchen table, Link lighted a candle and went  in  search of such rude appliances as his father had been wont to keep  in store  for any of the farm's animals that might be injured.
